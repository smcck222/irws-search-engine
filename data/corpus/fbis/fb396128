  [Text] In a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi today, the Council of Ministers discussed a report 
presented by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa on the developments of 
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the efforts of 
President Muhammad Husni Mubarak and Egyptian diplomacy to bring 
the viewpoints of the two sides closer. These efforts ended 
with the initialing last Wednesday of a document on one of the 
phases of the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
President Mubarak attended the signing. 
  This was stated by Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif. He 
said the Palestinian-Israeli talks brought the two sides' views 
on the size of Jericho and Gaza closer together. The Jericho 
area is 60 square kilometers in area and Gaza 300 square 
kilometers. The information minister said the Council of 
Ministers stressed the need for Egypt to continue its efforts 
until the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho takes place 
in April. It also emphasized Egypt's continued role in 
advancing the peace process on all negotiating tracks with a 
view to achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace in the 
Middle East. 
  The information minister said the foreign minister's report 
also dealt with the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
Council of Ministers stressed Egypt's adherence to the Security 
Council resolution authorizing NATO to use force against the 
Serbs if they fail to withdraw their heavy weapons from around 
Sarajevo. The Council of Ministers condemned the Serbs' 
massacres and criminal acts against Muslims in Bosnia. It 
called on the world community to deal a decisive blow to Serbian 
aggression and to coordinate with the Islamic countries to lift 
the arms embargo against Bosnia and support the Bosnian people 
in attaining their legitimate rights. 
  The information minister said the Council of Ministers 
approved the draft agreement between Egypt and the PLO on 
economic and technical cooperation. It also approved a number 
of draft agreements on exploration for oil in various regions in 
Egypt. 
  The information minister said the Council of Ministers also 
discussed a report presented by Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi 
on the efforts of the security agencies against criminal 
terrorists. In the report, the interior minister stressed that 
the security services are chasing the criminals who have 
perpetrated terrorist acts at home and abroad. He said the 
capture of these criminals and the details of their abortive 
schemes will be announced. 
  The Council of Ministers stressed its support for the 
security services in their all-out confrontation with terrorists 
within the framework of the law and the Constitution. The 
information minister said the interior minister's report also 
explained many activities for maintaining security and pursuing 
outlaws.

<F P=106> [Report by Ashraf Khalil] </F>
  [Text] The security forces managed by sheer chance to foil 
a new attempt to assassinate President Husni Mubarak when they 
raided hideouts of the Islamic groups in al-Ma'sarah, Hulwan, 
and al- Zawiyah al-Hamra' over the past three weeks. Nine 
members of the groups were charged with the attempt and have 
been referred to the military court in criminal case no. 2 of 
1994 in Sidi Barrani, Marsa Matruh, where the attempt was to 
have taken place when President Mubarak intended to visit Libya. 
The defendants managed to plant explosive charges in two 
important places: the airport and the VIP lounge where President 
Mubarak is used to staying. 
  One of the casualties in the raid on al-Ma'sarah-Hulwan made 
detailed confessions under the influence of drugs while he was 
in surgery. Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi Abd-al-Baqi, one of the 
defendants in the attempt, was killed when the security forces 
raided the al- Zawiyah al-Hamra' hideout last week. 
  It is worth noting that the Sidi Barrani court held its 
first 
hearing on this case on 30 January. It will hold another 
hearing next week. A retired judge has been summoned to chair 
the trial. He previously passed a verdict in a military case.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 14 (AFP) -- A bomb planted by suspected 
militants seriously wounded four people in a shopping centre in 
a town north of here on Monday, police said. 
  The bomb, which went off outside a shop and wounded passers 
by in the town of Tanta, was similar to those seized during a 
police raid here two weeks ago in which seven members of the 
outlawed Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] were killed. 
  Two of the group's gunmen also fired on a bus carrying 
Romanian and Egyptian engineers in the southern city of Asyut on 
Monday, shattering windows but caused no injuries. 
  The Jama'ah said it carried out the shooting attack as part 
of its "campaign against foreign investors and tourists" and to 
avenge seven members killed in a February 1 police raid in 
Cairo, the group said in a statement to AFP. 
  The gunmen opened fire as the bus drove through Asyut, 380 
kilometers (230 miles) south of Cairo, on its way to a cement 
factory, police said. The engineers hit the floor when the 
shooting started and escaped injury. 
  The Jama'ah has warned foreigners to leave Egypt as part of 
a 
violent campaign against President Husni Mubarak's government 
which has killed almost 300 people. 
  The group said the shooting was the fifth attack it has 
carried out to "avenge the seven martyrs of al-Zawiyah 
al-Hamra'," a poor Cairo neighborhood. Jama'ah has accused the 
police of gunning down the seven militants in cold blood.

  [Text] Pakistan has strongly supported solid and effective 
action in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the use of force, 
especially air strikes, to implement the UN Security Council 
decisions on Bosnia. In his speech during the debate on Bonsia, 
which began at the UN Security Council last night, Pakistan's 
deputy ambassador at the United Nations, Sher Afghan, said in 
effective terms that those who do not fulfill their 
responsibility to prevent the aggression against Bosnia will be 
remembered in history as supporters of the aggressive Serb 
forces. He said only by complete use of force, especially by 
air strikes, can the Serbs be forced to implement the Security 
Council resolutions. In this regard, significant moral, 
political, and legal responsibility rest with those powers, who 
have the necessary resources to get the relevant Security 
Council resolutions implemented. 
  Sher Afghan said Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish 
Prime Minister Madam Tansu Ciller visited Sarajevo on 2 
February, which reflects their concern about the struggle of the 
people and the government in Bosnia. On this occasion, both the 
prime ministers urged the international community to protect the 
sovereignty, solidarity, regional security, and political 
independence of Bosnia and to take effective steps to prevent 
genocide. He said Pakistan strongly believes that inaction 
against the aggressors is tantamount to justifying aggression 
and hence in Pakistan's view, the establishment of peace in the 
besieged country is the combined responsibility of the entire 
international community. The Pakistani representative said the 
massacres and annihilation, along with the destruction and 
devastation committed by the Serbian forces in Bosnia has 
reached such an extent that now, there is no other choice than 
to take joint action at a global level. The Pakistani 
representative added that the arms embargo against Bosnia is 
against the UN Charter which has deprived the country, which has 
been the victim of aggression, of its legitimate right to its 
own defense. 
  Sher Afghan expressed the hope that the international 
tribunal will soon begin its hearing on the cases against the 
perpetrators of brutal crimes in the former Yugoslavia. 
Pakistan's Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has already 
pledged $1 million for the expenses of the tribunal. Sher 
Afghan said the international community should pay similar 
attention to the security of the civilian population in all the 
safe havens declared by the United Nations and other cities and 
towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Voicing full support once again 
for the principled stand of the Bosnian Government, the 
Pakistani representative said its constructive and flexible 
tendency at the talks are praiseworthy.

  [Text] Information Minister Hojjat ol-Eslam who was 
speaking in an exclusive interview with HAMSHAHRI, revealed some 
facts about the foiled assassination attempt against the 
president on 1 February in the shrine of Imam Khomeyni, may his 
soul be sanctified. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam Fallahian said: The person who intended to 
assassinate the president was Kurosh Nik-Akhtar whose surname 
used to be Kamare'i in the past. 
  The information minister said: In addition to arresting 
Kurosh Nik-Akhtar, who was apprehended because of the full 
awareness and prompt action of our courageous people on 1 
February, a large network of his accomplices and cohorts have 
been identified and arrested. 
  According to the information minister, more than 20 members 
of this network's nucleus who were either aware of the 
assassination plan or who cooperated with the terrorist have 
been arrested. The information minister added: During the 
preliminary questionings, all the people who were arrested 
confessed their ominous and counterrevolutionary objectives. 
These confessions have shown that most members of the group 
were involved in many immoral and corrupt acts. 
  The general decision of the terrorists was to start shouting 
antistate and apparently revolutionary slogans in order to 
attract the attention of public opinion and to justify their 
counterrevolutionary movement by distracting the people. They 
intended to propagate their blind ideas in order to impress the 
Muslim nation with their terrorist act and to spread public 
mistrust toward high-ranking pious, revolutionary, and 
hardworking elements. 
  The information minister also stated that in order to ensure 
that the assassination plot would be as successful as possible, 
the suspects had held a coordination meeting the night before 
the attempt and had discussed the details of the plan. 
  The information minister said: There are persons among those 
who were arrested who were affiliated with atheist leftist 
groups and have a criminal record. 
  The criminal records and confessions by the suspects have 
shown to also have a record of drunkenness, moral corruption, 
and addiction.

  [Text] French Foreign Affairs Minister Alain Juppe has 
said Jordanian-French relations are distinguished, constantly 
growing, and getting deeper. He said he is satisfied with the 
move to allow French firms to invest in Jordan. 
  Upon arrival in Amman today, Juppe said that France is 
looking forward to the establishment of a comprehensive peace in 
the region and that his visit to Jordan is based on France's 
concern for supporting the peace process. He added: France has 
a role to play in the peace process, particularly in the 
framework of the multilateral talks and the committees in which 
it is involved, such as economic development, water, and refugee 
committees. 
  Juppe said France is seeking to help Jordan reschedule its 
foreign debt; the amount of which is a burden to the Jordanian 
economy. 
  He said France is working through NATO to put an end to the 
suffering of people in Bosnia and is determined not to miss any 
opportunity to achieve peace there. The recent NATO decision, 
he said, has restored confidence and there are encouraging signs 
now from the parties to the conflict that they will listen to 
the voice of logic, including the handing over of some heavy 
weapons to the United Nations. 
  Juppe was received at Amman civilian airport by Dr. Fawwaz 
Abu-al-Ghanam, acting minister of state for foreign affairs; the 
French ambassador in Amman; and senior Foreign Ministry and 
French Embassy staff.

  [Text] The president of the Republic, Lieutenant General 
'Umar al-Bashir, has confirmed the revolution's adherence to the 
cultural course accepted by the Sudanese people of making god's 
law their arbiter. He said that the dogfight of the enemies and 
those lying in wait for us would only make us more determined to 
move forward to establish a good society, a society of values 
and decent morals. 
  Lieutenant General al-Bashir made it clear in his speech 
before the masses during the holding of god's table [ma'idat 
al-rahman ayt -- breaking the fast for the poor] at Umm Baddah 
that the conspiracy of the West will not frighten us, because we 
know that power belongs to god alone. The shortage of funds, 
men and fruits [koranic quote] to which we have been subjected 
is no more than a trial from god to test the extent of our 
adherence to his course and the extent of our turning towards 
him. 
  He stated: We once again declare our rejection of all 
resolutions and charters of the security council and the United 
Nations which contradict god's law.

  [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed political 
sources said in Cairo yesterday that Damascus is currently 
preparing to make a new move toward Tehran in the framework of 
what was termed as a Syrian move to mediate between Cairo and 
Tehran after an interruption of several months. 
  The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad will visit Tehran this month. Meanwhile, it has 
been reported that al-Asad will meet with Egyptian President 
Husni Mubarak this month as well. The political circles said 
that there is a link between the next Syrian move at this level 
and the escalation in Hizballah's activities against Israel via 
southern Lebanon. 
  The sources said that al-Asad will offer new proposals which 
could bring views closer between Cairo and Tehran in a renewal 
of the Syrian endeavor -- which was suspended before the end of 
last year -- to correct positions and ease recent factors of 
tension between them. 
  The sources also said that the Syrian president will submit 
to Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani a report on the 
development of the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, the results 
of his talks in Geneva last month with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, and the future of peace in the light of the new factors 
and changes. The sources said that the Syrian move requires 
regional coordination and support in the framework of strategic 
interests.

Disputed security issues were settled by the agreement the two 
sides signed in Cairo last week. 
  Ahmad Quray', Fatah Central Committee member and a key 
Palestinian negotiator, said the Cairo agreement is a genuine 
translation of the Oslo accord. What we have reached on the 
border crossings, he said, was even better than what was reached 
in Oslo. He noted that the Israelis agreed that the Palestinian 
flag be raised over the crossings.

Taba talks with the Palestinians, has said that the recently

Taba. He said that a number of security issues were discussed, 
including the formation, responsibilities, and mission of the 
Palestinian police force. He said this subject will be 
discussed further during the negotiations, which will continue 
for a week. 
  Shahaq said the Palestinian-Israeli Civilian Affairs 
Committee will begin meeting tomorrow, Tuesday, until Thursday. 
  He said the committee will discuss Palestinian detainees in 
Israeli prisons. This subject, he added, was discussed in the 
early rounds of the Taba talks, and will be completed in the 
current round. 
  Shahaq said the negotiations agenda was changed because of 
the month of Ramadan. 
  MENA has learned that tomorrow's session will be held from 
0800 to 1400, and will resume from 2000 to 2200 Cairo time. 
  General Shahaq and Palestinian chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th 
first held a private meeting. The two delegations then held an 
expanded meeting. Absent from the talks today were lawyer Jamil 
al-Tarifi, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Civilian 
Affairs Committee, and Gadi Zohar, head of the Israeli 
delegation to the same committee. Al-Tarifi will arrive in Taba 
this evening. 
  The Palestinian and Israeli delegations held a second 
session 
of talks in Taba this afternoon; it is expected to continue 
until just before iftar [breaking of the fast], when the Israeli 
delegation will leave Taba for Israel.

  [Excerpts] Taba, 14 Feb (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of 
the Palestinian delegation in the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations regarding the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, described the first day of negotiations as positive. 
He said that the Cairo agreement of 9 February helped to make 
today's negotiations positive. 
  In statements he made to correspondents at the conclusion of 
the second negotiating session today, Dr. Sha'th said that they 
discussed the tasks, number, and deployment of the Palestinian 
police in the areas from which the Israeli forces will withdraw. 
Sha'th refused to specify the size of the Palestinian force that 
the Palestinian delegation is asking to be deployed in Gaza and 
Jericho, noting that the Palestinian delegation had submitted a 
number of questions to the Israeli delegation and it is waiting 
for answers to them. The Israeli delegation also submitted a 
number of questions and is waiting to receive the answers to 
them. 
  Official Palestinian sources said that these questions 
pertain to the types of weapons that will be supplied to the 
police forces, the [words indistinct] in the various areas, and 
everything pertaining to the maintenance of security in the 
Palestinian self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho. 
  Dr. Sha'th emphasized the need to reach agreement on the 
structure and number of the Palestinian police force, because 
there are many issues that must be dealt with. He noted that 
the entry of the Palestinian police into the Palestinian 
self-rule areas must precede the Israeli withdrawal and not come 
after it in order not to create a security vacuum in these areas. 
  The head of the Palestinian delegation said that they also 
discussed issues pertaining to Palestinian-Israeli coordination 
and cooperation in the security sphere. 
  Sha'th added that the two delegations have began drafting 
the 
general agreement that will be signed by Palestinian president 
Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo. 
He affirmed that no specific problems emerged during today's 
two sessions, and that there was general progress. 
  Regarding the issue of the Palestinian detainees, Sha'th 
said 
that this issue was not discussed today because not all the 
members of the Palestinian delegation were present. He 
indicated that it will be discussed at tomorrow's session. 
  Asked about a timetable for the release of the Palestinian 
detainees from Israeli prisons, Sha'th emphasized that a final 
agreement will not be signed before a timetable is prepared for 
the release of all the detainees, including those who belong to 
Hamas. The head of the Palestinian delegation explained that all 
the detainees will be released in stages until next July. 
[passage omitted] 
  Sha'th said that the final size of the Jericho area will be 
discussed at the next meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin, noting 
that the Palestinians expressed reservations regarding the maps 
pertaining to the Jericho area when they were signed in Cairo. 
  The head of the Palestinian delegation added that an era of 
peace has begun, and all the problems pertaining to Israel's 
security fears must end, because when war ends, peace must 
begin. [passage omitted] 
  Sha'th expressed the hope that the negotiations will be 
concluded during the month of Ramadan, noting that the delay 
that occurred in the past two weeks was political and not 
procedural. 
  Asked whether the negotiations will be held in Cairo or Taba 
next week, Sha'th said that they have not discussed this issue 
yet. 
  It has been learned that the Palestinian delegation wants 
the 
meetings to be held alternatively in Taba and Cairo while the 
Israeli delegation wants the negotiations to take place either 
in Taba or Alexandria, but not in Cairo.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, Feb 11 (AFP) -- Arab states should map 
out a strategy to prepare for economic cooperation with Israel 
when they reach a comprehensive peace settlement, a top Arab 
economic official said in a magazine interview Friday [11 
February]. 
  Jassim al-Manai, chairman-designate of the Arab Monetary 
Fund 
(AMF), said economic ties hinged on the political relationship 
between the two sides after they end hostility. 
  "It is difficult now to speculate about the role which 
Israel 
will play or how Arab countries will build their relations with 
Israel and what is the shape of this relationship. But such a 
relationship should be satisfactory for all parties," he told 
the United Arab Emirates magazine Al-Shuruq. 
  "All this depends on the strategy of Arab countries after 
the 
establishment of peace and their ability to benefit from that 
relationship," he added. "There should be a new Arab concept to 
work from now to benefit from the coming stage in coordination 
with the Arab League." 
  Arabs have voiced fears economic integration with Israel 
will 
enable it to dominate their economies given its superior 
industrial power at a time when they are striving to boost their 
industries to tackle their economic woes. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has proposed a Middle 
East common market as a measure to boost confidence among the 
parties involved and achieve prosperity in the volatile but rich 
region. 
  Talk about a common market intensified after Israel and 
Palestinians signed an autonomy agreement in Washington on 
September 13. Syria and Jordan have also been involved in peace 
negoitations with the Israelis. 
  But despite the progress, Arab governments have resisted 
pressure from the United States and its western allies to end a 
40-year old economic boycott against the Jewish State, arguing 
the ban would be lifted only when Israel withdraws from the 
occupied territories. 
  Egypt, tied with Israel in a 15-year old peace treaty, is 
the 
only Arab nation to have officially lifted the boycott, which 
has cost Israel nearly 50 billion dollars in addition to large 
losses by world companies blacklisted by Arab states for dealing 
with it. 
  "The establishment of a comprehensive peace will have a 
great 
impact on the region," said Manai, whose Abu Dhabi-based AMF is 
one of the Arab League's biggest financial organisations. 
  "It will boost investors' confidence and the region will 
become an attractive centre for foreign capital. This will 
benefit Arab states, especially those which need foreign 
investment." 
  Egyptian economist Said al-Najjar, one of the best-known 
economic experts in the Arab world, said he believed a Middle 
East common market would see light although in the long-run. 
  "Such a market is not an inevitable result of peace but a 
higher degree of economic cooperation which could be realised in 
the far future," he told Al-Shuruq. "Arabs should concentrate in 
the first stage on cooperation with Israel in joint projects in 
the fields of water, energy and environment."

  [Text] G.G. Kumar Ponnambalam (Junior), the leader of the 
All Ceylon Tamil Congress [ACTC], has appealed to the voters in 
Eastern Province and Vavuniya District to go to the polling 
stations in the morning and to cast invalid ballots. In a 
statement he says: 
  For various reasons, the ACTC does not welcome the scheduled 
local elections in the north and the east. The northeastern 
region is still a war zone. Many voters have deserted their 
homes and are living as refugees outside the Northern and 
Eastern Provinces. The list of voters is incomplete as a 
result. Proclaiming themselves members of parties and 
independent groups, the pro-government Tamil groups are still 
living in those areas. They have been harassing innocent Tamil 
citizens. All of these factors will impede the holding of free 
and fair elections. 
  The ACTC strongly believes that the government's stubborn 
insistence on holding elections in spite of all these objections 
does not reflect its good intentions to establish a 
representative government. This is an insidious attempt to tell 
the world that the situation has become normal and that peace 
has returned to the north and east, in order to hold a 
referendum there. 
  Every Tamil citizen knows that the situation in the 
northeast 
is not conducive to elections. Therefore, if any Tamil citizen 
extends any assistance toward this venture, he should be 
considered an accessory to the government conspiracy. 
  For these reasons, the ACTC has decided not to be a party to 
the disinformation campaign. We appeal to the Tamil people in 
the north and east to go to the polling stations early in the 
morning to present their indignation, protests, and objections. 
We make this appeal in order to prevent the impersonation of 
genuine Tamil voters and the creation of a wrong impression for 
the rest of the world. 
  The ACTC strongly condemns any Tamil party that makes an 
appeal for support of candidates favoring the merger of the 
north and east, as that would be contrary to the goal of 
opposing the elections. Besides, such a move would also justify 
a referendum on the merger of the north and east.

  [Text] A key LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] base 
in Trincomalee area was overrun by the security forces in a 
major offensive. The base identified as the wing base of the 
terrorists and situated north of Trincomalee and to the west of 
Nilaveli area was overrun and destroyed without much resistance 
from the terrorists, according to a senior military officer in 
the East. The terrorists put up a token resistance and withdrew 
at the approach of our troops supported by the Air Force, the 
officer said. 
  Several soldiers, including Special Forces personnel, were 
involved in the offensive codenamed (Wale Sumana), named after 
one of the giants in the army of Sri Lanka's ancient King 
(Vettigamono), which was launched late last week amidst much 
secrecy. The number of casualties incurred by the terrorists 
before their withdrawal from the area was not known, but the 
Army had a single casualty from an antipersonnel mine. Soldiers 
recovered mines, about 100 kilos of explosives, food, and other 
items from the terrorist base which comprised about 15 bunkers, 
10 huts, a lecture room, a (?sewing) center, stores, and a 
dental clinic. (Wale Sumana) is the first major combined 
offensive to be launched by the security forces since the 
assuming of command by the Army commander, Lieutenant General 
Gerry de Silva, and also the first in 1994.

  [Text] The external affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, has 
underlined the need for India and the United States to cooperate 
against terrorism for promoting peace. Mr. Dinesh Singh told 
the U.S. senator, Mr. Moynihan, who called on him in New Delhi 
today, that it is also necessary for Pakistan to desist from 
supporting terrorism if it is serious about normalizing 
relations. Both also discussed Indo-U.S. relations and felt 
that the economic relationship is picking up day by day. Mr. 
Moynihan said substantial increase in the U.S. economic 
engagement in India augurs well for the future. 
  The Janata Dal has strongly criticized the U.S. interference 
in India's internal affairs. The national executive of the 
party, in a resolution adopted at its meeting in New Delhi 
today, said that the U.S. attempt to use the Kashmir issue to 
violate Indian sovereignty and Washington's comments on Punjab 
amount to rank interference.

<F P=106> [By 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Excerpt] 'Abdallah Hurani, PLO Executive Committee 
member, says any Executive Committee session to which fewer than 
10 members turn up is illegal. 
  In statements to AL-RA'Y, Hurani observed that the PLO's 
bylaws state that the Executive Committee quorums are met by the 
attendance of two thirds of its membership -- 12 out of 18 
members. Six members have boycotted its meetings since last 
September over the Oslo agreement. He indicated that the bylaws 
also provide that if the 12-member quorum failed to materialize, 
a meeting may be set for the following day, with the attendance 
of half the committee members of nine plus one. Accordingly, 
any session to which fewer than 10 members report is deemed 
illegal. 
  I suggested to him that this had been practice even before 
the Oslo agreement and was nothing new to the Executive 
Committee meetings. Hurani agreed, but noted that the decisions 
under consideration by the Executive Committee this time are 
crucial. 
  He called the Cairo agreement an offspring of the Oslo 
accord, and contended that it yielded further ground to the 
Israelis. An assertive and vigorous popular action in the 
occupied territories, rather than smartness and skill at the 
negotiating table, can call a halt to these concessions, Hurani 
maintained. 
  The PLO Executive Committee member, who is viewed as an 
independent, said he was not surprised by the Cairo agreement, 
seeing that it is substantially covered by the Oslo accord. The 
Cairo agreement simply spelled out certain details. 
  The series of Palestinian concessions also did not come as a 
surprise to me, Hurani added. Criticisms and opposition, he 
said, must focus mainly on the root of the problem and that is 
the Oslo accord. Unless the Palestinian leadership rethinks the 
core of its position, the string of concessions seems unlikely 
to stop there. It has made a series of retreats on the 
boundaries, the crossings, the area of the Jericho enclave, 
Jewish settlements, and security. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Damascus, 15 Feb (SANA)--The Palestinian National 
Salvation Front [PNSF] has warned against the seriousness of the 
Cairo agreement signed by Israel and the PLO. It pointed out 
that this agreement has clearly disclosed the extent of the 
concessions 'Arafat made in the Oslo agreement. 
  In a statement issued today, the PNSF said the articles and 
terms of reference of the Cairo agreement violate national and 
pan-Arab principles. This agreement is a coordinative approach 
with the enemy and an attempt to end our people's intifadah, 
tamper with their security, and liquidate their cause and 
rights, which will threaten our people's existence and national 
destiny. 
  In another development, brother Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa 
Muragha], secretary of the Fatah Central Committee, said the 
Fatah Movement rejects the Cairo agreement which bestows full 
legitimacy on Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip and Jericho 
and entrenches the Zionist settlements. 
  In a press statement today, Abu-Musa added: We see in this 
agreement an additional step in a plan hostile to our people and 
nation. This step is intended to generalize the phenomenon of 
the Oslo agreement in the region and penetrate deeper into Arab 
ranks by peddling partial and separate agreements, he noted.

  [Excerpts] Jerusalem, QUDS PRESS -- Fatah, the principal 
faction in the PLO, has accused the Israeli intelligence 
services of launching a "grave and systematic war" with the aim 
of undermining the movement's internal front which supports the 
peace process and the self-rule agreement. [passage omitted] 
  The Fatah statement warned against a war being waged by the 
Shin Bet in a bid to "prepare the climate for a prolonged civil 
war." The statement said that "the Shin Bet aims to create 
suspect bodies that raise the national slogan and operate under 
different names within Fatah." It called on the movement's 
supporters "to act with alertness and high responsibility and 
not deal with these unofficial and illegitimate organizations." 
  The statement stressed that "organizational statements" 
signed by Fatah in the West Bank and Gaza Strip "are approved 
officially by Fatah's supreme organizational committee in the 
occupied territories." Other statements are considered 
"unofficial," including those by "Fatah's organizational offices 
in the territories."

  [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 15 (AFP) -- The PLO has worked out a 
first budget of 600 million dollars to cover the running of the 
autonomous authority in the occupied territories this year, 
Palestinian economist Samir 'Abdallah told AFP. 
  The figures, calculated on the assumption that autonomy will 
be launched in March, allow for a 158 million dollar deficit. 
  Some 280 million dollars should be raised from direct 
taxation, said 'Abdallah, a member of the Palestinian Economic 
Council for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR), set up by 
PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat to oversee the two billion dollars 
aid promised by donor countries for the five years of autonomy. 
  He noted that most of the deficit should be covered by 120 
million promised by donors for administrative affairs. 
  "This budget does not cover infrastructure or any 
development 
projects. This will be dealt with elsewhere," he noted. 
  PECDAR advertized in Tuesday's [15 February] Palestinian 
press 16 management jobs for the tax and finance departments in 
the future authority which is to run daily life in the Gaza 
Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
  Israel and the PLO resumed negotiations in Egypt this week 
in 
a bid to seal an overall agreement to launch autonomy.

  [Text] A four-day cease-fire between forces of the Islamic 
state forces and Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party] came into force 
beginning at 0500 on 15 February. 
  A high authority of the Islamic State of Afghanistan told 
BAKHTAR that, as demanded by peace councils, for the purpose of 
opening supply routes and in respect for the sacred month of 
Ramadan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan has agreed to 
implement a cease-fire with the forces of Hezb-e Eslami in Kabul 
alone. During this period, peace delegations will observe the 
opening of highways to Kabul and the free flow of transport 
along these highways. 
  The source said the jehad declared against the Dostam looter 
militia by the president of our country is continuing. Dostam 
is in no way a party to the current cease-fire. The Islamic 
state will observe a complete cease-fire during these four days, 
provided that the opposition side also observes it.

<F P=106> [Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan report: "Hekmatyar and Rabbani Accept </F>
Four-day Truce Beginning Today"] 
  [Excerpts] Peshawar from Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan; Geneva 
(United Nations), REUTER -- After six weeks of fierce fighting, 
the two warring parties in Kabul have agreed on a four-day truce 
to make way for a study of the causes of the war and ways of 
resolving the crisis between President Borhanoddin Rabbani and 
Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar. 
  Afghan Reconcilian Committee Chairman Jalaloddin Haqqani 
told 
AL-HAYAH yesterday that the truce in Kabul "will begin at 0500 
Tuesday [15 February] and will last for four days." 
  Haqqani, who heads a committee consisting of some 100 
commanders and ulema, added: "We have, from both sides, written 
assurances of adherence to the cease-fire and cooperation for 
the sake of probing the main causes of the crisis." 
  Asked by AL-HAYAH if the cease-fire would also apply to the 
Uzbek forces against whom the Afghan president declared jihad 
and refused to agree a cease-fire with, Haqqani said: "There 
will be a cease-fire between the camps of Rabbani and 
Hekmatyar." He reaffirmed that both parties to the conflict had 
agreed to a truce. 
  Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar told AL-HAYAH that "the 
Higher Coordination Council has agreed to a cease-fire provided 
it is used to find a mechanism for the settlement of the current 
crisis, as follows: Unconditional resignation of the president 
(Rabbani), declaration of Kabul a demilitarized zone, removal of 
the armed units from it within a week, and the formation of a 
provisional government within two weeks." [passage omitted] 
  Haqqani made an appeal through AL-HAYAH to the Islamic 
governments and organizations to provide urgent aid for the 
Afghan capital. Emotionally, he said: "The situation is 
extremely tragic, with scores of families without shelter, 
clothes, or food. The Muslims must help in this critical period."

  [Text] Islamabad, Feb 15 (AFP) -- The Hezb-e Eslami 
[Islamic Party] faction of Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin 
Hekmatyar has decided to block humanitarian aid convoys to parts 
of Kabul controlled by its opponents, sources said Tuesday. 
  Ustad Saeed [name as received], who represents the Hezb in 
Peshawar, Pakistan, said no convoy would be allowed "to travel 
to military bases," but three markets had been opened for 
civilians in those parts of the capital controlled by the 
faction or its allies. 
  The decision to stop aid going to areas controlled by former 
defence minister Ahmed Shah Masood follows a warning by the 
United Nations that some 200,000 people in the capital face 
famine after weeks of fighting. 
  Saeed said the move came after accusations that supplies 
recently brought in by an International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC) convoy were distributed to Masood troops. 
  The ICRC has denied the claim saying that the distribution 
of 
supplies to the population remained at all times under its 
control. 
  An ICRC convoy carrying medical supplies was turned away 
from 
Kabul Sunday and had to return to Jalalabad in the east, 
according to a journalist from the French newspaper, LE FIGARO, 
who was travelling with the convoy. 
  The journalist also said that Hekmatyar had told him in an 
interview that he was determined to set up a complete blockade 
of the capital. 
  Analysts said the blockade was aimed at either causing a 
mass 
evacuation of the centre of Kabul by civilians or to push the 
population into a revolt against President Borhanoddin Rabbani 
and Masood. 
  Several UN trucks are waiting in Jalalabad for permission to 
travel, a UN source said. 
  The Hezb controls the main road between Pakistan and Kabul 
as 
well as the southern approach to the city along the Logar 
highway.

<F P=106> [By BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY commentator -- read by </F>
announcer] 
  [Text] On the fifth anniversary of the escape of the 
occupying Soviet forces from Afghanistan, events in the country 
are moving in two different ways. The Islamic State of 
Afghanistan, as the center of the gathering of real mojahedin, 
is defending the results of the jihad. And the mojahedin 
continue to sacrifice themselves in continuing their holy jihad 
to eliminate the last remnants of the foreigners' hirelings like 
the infamous Karmal-Dostam group. But Golboddin Hekmatyar, the 
known wheeler-dealer of the period of jihad, has, in alliance 
with Parcham and Khalq, the two factions of the Communist Party, 
started a rebellion against the mojahedin of Afghanistan and the 
Islamic State. Golboddin, on the one hand by his coalition with 
the so-called National Movement, which is headed by 
nation-seller Karmal, has embarked on the killing of the people 
of Kabul. On the other hand with the atheist Tanay [exiled 
former defense minister under Najibollah] he gathered around him 
the band of Khalqis and instructed him to embark on the 
establishment of the so-called peace movement outside 
Afghanistan. 
  It is not without a reason that at the time of the attack by 
Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam and on the occasion of the fifth 
anniversary of the escape of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan, 
once again the communist Shahnawaz Tanay raises his voice, and 
in cooperation with Golboddin he expresses his opposition to all 
jihadi leaders and Afghan mojahedin. This shows that to reach 
his sinister goals, Golboddin is serving as an instrument for 
the reunion of Khalqis and Parchamis. But for the mojahedin the 
fifth anniversary of the escape of the Soviet occupier from 
Afghanistan serves as a strong motive for the consolidation of 
the jihad's trenches against the defeated communists of Khalq 
and Parcham and their ill-nature. The heroic affirmative 
response of all jihadi organizations to the holy jihad against 
the Karmal-Dostam militia reflects this fact. The situation of 
the country and the coordination of the jihadi organizations to 
crush the Karmal-Dostum militia show that the mojahed Afghan 
nation is determined to completely eliminate from the Islamic 
State the twin movements of Tanay and Dostam on the sixth 
anniversary of the escape of the Soviet forces. And Golboddin 
who against the wishes of all mojahedin of the Hezb-e Eslami 
[Islamic Party] has formed an unholy alliance with them will not 
have a better fate than them.

  [Excerpts] London, Amman, Beirut, Tripoli, Political 
Studies Center, news agencies -- Lebanese security authorities 
announced yesterday the names of the Palestinians held in 
custody on charges of assassinating the Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 
'Imran al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut. Meanwhile Jordan announced the 
arrest of the members of six "Afghan Arabs" cells in the context 
of its investigations to uncover those who carried out the 
bombing operations in Amman and to determine the extent of their 
link with al-Ma'ayitah's assassination. 
  Sources have said that members of the Fatah-Revolutionary 
Council who are said to be responsible for al-Ma'ayitah's 
assassination, are living normally in Jordan. Libya has denied 
any link with al-Ma'ayitah's assassination as reported in Amman. 
However, reports that Libya was behind the assassination have 
started a crisis in Jordanian-Libyan relations. [passage 
omitted] 
  Reports in Amman linked Libya's support of the 
Fatah-Revolutionary Council to the extent of its involvement in 
al-Ma'ayitah's assassination, especially as the Jordanian 
monarch, King Husayn, pointed to the role of an Arab capital in 
the incident. But Libya hastened to deny any link with the 
incident, stressing its good relations with Jordan. A Libyan 
source said that these reports are designed to harm these 
relations. 
  Some observers believe that Syria is currently trying to 
resolve matters between Jordan and Libya. The Syrians believe 
that any Jordanian pressure on Tripoli in this connection would 
weaken the latter's position in the worsening Lockerbie crisis. 
At any rate, it seems that Jordan is trying to identify the 
clues to this issue outside Jordanian territory, as the 
information available has not indicated that Jordanian security 
services have taken any actions against members of the 
Fatah-Revolutionary Council or made any arrests in this 
connection. It seems that it is seeking to get hold of all 
clues in the light of the investigations with those suspected of 
carrying out the assassination operation in question in Lebanon, 
and to determine whether they have any link with members of this 
organization in Jordan.

  [Text] Meetings of the higher Jordanian-Palestinian 
political committee will begin in Amman today to discuss 
bilateral cooperation. The committee, which is chaired on the 
Jordanian side by Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and 
minister of higher education, and on the Palestinian side by 
Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, will also 
discuss all living aspects in the wake of the security agreement 
the PLO signed with Israel on Wednesday [9 February] on the 
implementation of the Palestinian autonomy agreement. 
  In a statement to reporters on arrival in Amman yesterday 
evening, Qaddumi said: The Middle East is witnessing momentous 
events and there is no doubt that the joint higher committee 
meetings are for cooperation and not coordination in order to 
chart a future concept for the sons of the one homeland who are 
living on the two banks of the Jordan River. It is imperative 
that we explore this future, he added. 
  Asked about the most important topics on the agenda of the 
higher committee, he said: It will discuss all living aspects 
of our people on the two banks and in Gaza. It will also 
discuss all proposed issues out of our desire to build a just 
peace while maintaining our full rights in the bilateral and 
multilateral negotiations. He stressed the need for Arab 
coordination. 
  He said: We as a joint delegation must assess our 
coordination on clear bases for the sake of serving the pan-Arab 
causes and our joint issues. Qaddumi said all topics of 
discussion will be identified and passed on to subcommittees. 
He added that a suitable program will also be drawn up so that 
these subcommittees will continue their work without 
interruption. 
  He indicated that the Palestinians went to Madrid on the 
basis of the land-for-peace formula. If Israel does not 
withdraw immediately, he said, then that means it has violated 
the agreement and there will be no peace. He said Israel does 
not want peace. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has not 
abided by the agreement. This, he added, shows that Rabin has 
violated the agreement when he said dates are not sacred 
although they are an article in the agreement signed by Israel 
and the PLO. Therefore, every article in the agreement is, in 
his opinion, not sacred. 
  Addressing the states sponsoring the negotiations, Qaddumi 
said: Rabin does not want peace in the region. He emphasized 
the need for Jordanian-Palestinian coordination firstly and 
Jordanian-Palestinian-Arab coordination secondly in order to try 
to overcome the obstacles placed by Israel. 
  Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign 
affairs; 
al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, Palestinian ambassador in Amman; and 
several officials received Qaddumi and his delegation on their 
arrival. 
  The Palestinian delegation comprises PLO Executive Committee 
members Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO Information 
Department; Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, head of the Economic 
Department; and Ahmad Quray', director general of the Economic 
Department; and Akram Haniyah, special adviser to the 
Palestinian president. 
  It is noteworthy that the joint higher committee supervises 
seven committees formed a year ago to coordinate the 
Jordanian-Palestinian positions in all fields.

  [Text] The higher Jordanian-Palestinian political committee 
has just opened cooperation meetings here in Amman. The 
committee will discuss various areas of future cooperation 
between Jordan and the Palestinians following the security 
agreement on self-rule that the PLO signed with Israel last 
Wednesday [9 February]. 
  The committee, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Sa'id 
al-Tall 
and the head of the PLO's Political Department Faruq Qaddumi, is 
discussing cooperation in the areas of economy, security, and 
issues tackled by the multilateral Middle East peace talks. 
  Mr. Qaddumi told reporters on arrival in Amman last night 
that the committee would debate a wide range of issues which 
would later be referred to specialized subcommittees which would 
meet regularly. He accused Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
of reneging on the peace accord by repeatedly stating that dates 
were not sacred. Mr. Qaddumi called for closer strategy 
coordination between Jordan and the PLO.

  [Text] Meetings of the higher Jordanian-Palestinian joint 
committee began at the Foreign Ministry today. The committee is 
led by Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of 
higher education, and Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO's Political 
Department. The meetings were attended by committee members of 
the Jordanian and Palestinians sides. 
  The meetings will discuss various issues regarding 
economics, 
security, and development, as well as the issues tackled by the 
multilateral talks. 
  Following the first session of higher Jordanian-Palestinian 
joint political committee meetings, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, 
minister of information and minister of state for cabinet 
affairs, and Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, PLO Executive Committee member 
and head of the Information Department, held a joint news 
conference. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said: 
  [Begin al-'Anani recording] Today's meeting was very 
fruitful 
and beneficial. Agreement was reached on several issues. First 
of all, we discussed the mechanism of coordination, and our 
evaluation of the coordination that has been conducted so far. 
We decided to adopt policies that provide a clear mechanism for 
this coordination, based on clear timetables, specific 
committees, and fixed dates of meetings so we can coordinate our 
positions from now on, especially because the negotiations 
process and the peace process have begun to move from the 
negotiations halls to practical implementation on the ground. 
This affects the interest of the Jordanian and Palestinian 
peoples on the two banks. 
  Likewise, we discussed the basic issues that are of an 
urgent 
and current nature. We know that Palestinian-Israeli economic 
talks will begin in Paris. Therefore, we appreciate the 
understanding of the brothers on the Palestinian side for the 
need for coordination with us, particularly in the field of 
trade cooperation and trade exchange. At present, this point 
has special importance. 
  We discussed the stage of what are called security 
arrangements and borders. We agreed to activate the committee 
assigned with this subject and to exchange expertise and 
information in this field. We also agreed to coordinate the 
traffic of passengers on both sides, and to make sure that the 
opening of the bridges after the implementation of self-rule 
will be in the interests of the people, in term of their 
movement and their return to their land -- not to empty the land 
but to entrench the people there. 
  As for the two other issues, which are the refugees and 
Jerusalem, we agreed to form two committees, a specialized 
committee for each subject, in order to agree on the frameworks 
within which we should deal with these two basic and sensitive 
topics. You know, for the Palestinian side, these two subjects 
are delayed until the negotiations on the final stage, but we 
can coordinate our positions now on negotiations concerning 
these subjects in a manner that secures for the Palestinian 
people, and the Arab people in general, their rights in their 
land in Palestine and Jerusalem, and the same applies to the 
basic rights of the refugees. [end recording] 
  For his part, 'Abd-Rabbuh Said: 
  [Begin 'Abd-Rabbuh recording] The meeting discussed almost 
all issues on the agenda in the areas that Dr. Jawad al-'Anani 
mentioned. I believe this meeting was practical, and allows us 
to go ahead with substantial steps, whether in bilateral 
Jordanian- Palestinian coordination or in supporting the 
position of the two parties within the framework of the 
negotiations process. 
  There are issues that are still under discussion, such as 
the 
evacuees. Also under discussion is the idea of forming a 
quadruple committee, preceded by a 
Jordanian-Egyptian-Palestinian meeting to coordinate stands 
between these parties. This subject is of primary concern and 
is among the issues that are supposed to be settled during the 
transitional stage. [end recording]

  [Text] The Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Committee has 
concluded the meetings it held in Amman yesterday and today. 
The Jordanian side to the talks was headed by Dr. Sa'id 
al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of higher education, 
while the Palestinian side was led by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the 
PLO Political Department. 
  During its meetings, the committee reviewed issues of 
bilateral and Arab concern to promote the overall bilateral 
cooperation and coordination to the required level in all areas. 
The committee also reviewed recent developments in the peace 
process, including the agreement the PLO and Israel signed in 
Cairo on 9 February, which constitutes a major step toward the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord, which is the first 
part of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  The two sides expressed satisfaction with the climate of 
understanding that permeated the talks, something which promotes 
bilateral coordination. This climate also demonstrates the need 
to promote and enhance this coordination in all areas, given 
that it is a realistic response to the special, historical, and 
fateful relationship between the two peoples, as well as a 
response to the common challenges facing them.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Remarks on the Minister's Statements Across </F>
the River"] 
  [Text] The momentum and new course of French-Israeli 
relations as announced by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe in 
occupied Jerusalem included the revival and activation of the 
military and security cooperation that eroded during late French 
President de Gaulle's era, in the aftermath of the 1967 
aggression. 
  Although we realize that the illegitimate son that is the 
product of Western states' relations with Jewish leaders, the 
birth of Israel, will continue to be the object of Western care 
and attention, new talk about the peace required in our region 
dictates striking a balance -- which does not yet exist -- 
between the special relations the West is establishing with 
Israel and the new relations the West hopes to establish with 
the Arabs, who call for justice, restoration of usurped rights, 
and compensation at a stage when durable peace can be concluded. 
  The French minister's talk about reactivating military and 
security cooperation between Paris and Tel Aviv, after crossing 
the river from a recent visit to Amman, is surprising. We 
question the timing and aims of this reactivation, especially 
since France was neutral rather than supportive of Israeli 
aggression and the acts of persecution and oppression practiced 
under occupation. 
  During the current peace talks Tel Aviv has presented 
nothing, on any track, that proves it is ready to abandon the 
logic of occupation and aggression. It continues daily 
violations of the simplest human rights in Palestine and the 
occupied Arab territories. Still, the French minister talks 
about more cooperation with Israel in various fields amid 
reports that the French defense minister will shortly arrive in 
Tel Aviv to bolster military cooperation that was severed in 
1967. 
  We hope the French interest in reactivating relations with 
Tel Aviv will not place more hurdles on the path of the peace 
process -- a process further complicated and slowed down by the 
unlimited U.S. support for this entity. Israel will be 
reassured that this economic, political, and military aid will 
continue, even if it perpetuates the state of war and 
instability in this sensitive region by its obstruction of the 
peace talks. Development and construction energies in this 
region have been exhausted over the past decades as a result of 
the losses caused by the establishment of Israel.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Settlements vs. Dollars"] </F>
  [Text] The recent decision of the Clinton administration to 
penalise Israel by deducting $437 million from this year's U.S. 
loan guarantees because of its illegal settlement activity in 
the occupied Arab territories appears to be less serious than it 
really is. What this penalty means in the final analysis is 
that instead of the full $2 billion in U.S. guarantees Israel 
would receive in 1994, it can now expect a maximum of $1.563 
billion. 
  On the surface of things, Washington's "punitive" move is 
predicated on its appraisal of Israeli spending on settlements 
in 1993 in excess of what was originally expected and agreed 
upon between the American and Israeli governments in 1992. The 
catch is that any penalty against continued Israeli building of 
settlements does not affect the $3 billion a year aid package to 
Israel. Had the White House been really serious about punishing 
Israel for its illegal settlement activity in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, it would have opted to cut drastically its direct 
financial, economical and military support programmes to the 
Rabin government instead of relying solely on reducing its loan 
guarantees. 
  Still, the U.S.' reaction, ineffective as it may be, 
confirms 
Arab suspicions that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is 
still bent on populating Palestinian territories with Israeli 
settlers at a time when he pretends to be suing for peace with 
the Arab side, especially the Palestinians. This is the newest 
evidence yet that the Israeli pious pleas for a just and durable 
peace in the region are cynical and hypocritical at best. At 
the rate the Israeli colonisation programme is developing, there 
would not be much Palestinian territory left to talk about at 
the end of the 5-year transitional period. 
  This is where the U.S. can be expected to do more by way of 
frustrating the Israeli settlement plans by cutting deeply into 
its concrete aid to the Jewish state. It could be the only 
language that Rabin understands, given the failure of all other 
methods of persuastion. 
  What adds insult to injury, though, is the reaction of 
pro-Israel activists in Washington who have expressed their 
dismay at the announcement of the so-called penalty. Now Israel 
and its supporters are pinning hopes on the U.S. Congress to 
reverse the administration's decision. If congressmen end up 
accommodating Israeli lobbyists on this score, then there is no 
escape from the conclusion that what the executive branch in 
Washington offers in support of the peace process on the one 
hand, Capitol Hill readily takes away on the other.

<F P=106> [Article by Walid Sa'di: "Human Rights File"] </F>
  [Text] The annual U.S. State Department reports on human 
rights worldwide is an effort to show Washington's concern over 
governments' human rights records by chronicling positive and 
negative developments on yearly basis. Presumably, the 
information supplied by the U.S. diplomatic missions abroad 
serves as the basis of these reports. 
  Seldom is there reliance on independent submissions in 
preparing the State Department's views on this subject. In a 
sense, therefore, Washington's judgment is subjective to a great 
extent that may or may not reflect the fact of the matter. 
  Against this backdrop, the message of the State Department's 
1993 report on Jordan appeared to be garbled, lacking a central 
theme. I have some years of experience in human rights 
endeavours, ever since I joined the U.N. Commission on Human 
Rights in 1975, so I can say that I found the reports of the 
international system of human rights remarkably different from 
those prepared by the State Department in content and style. 
Whereas United Nations efforts consist of documented 
information, the Washington ones appear to be a list of 
conclusions and judgments based on interpretations of laws and 
practices. 
  This is not to suggest that the U.S. report on Jordan has no 
redeeming value. On the contrary, the report contains some 
observations and comments that are serious and true to the best 
of my knowledge. My concern, however, is about the overall 
assessment and tone of the report which may give rise to 
speculations about Jordan's commitment to democracy and human 
rights. 
  By way of example, I hasten to cite a few samples of remarks 
contained in the 1993 report which could be misleading instead 
of being informative, as I am sure they were originally intended 
to be. When the first paragraph states categorically that "in 
practice the King sets the broad parameters of foreign and 
domestic policy while the prime minister exercises management of 
daily affairs," one gets the distinct impression that the 
Monarch governs in absolute terms without any constraints or 
guidelines and that the executive branch of government under the 
prime minister is nothing but a municipal council dealing with 
such state matters as the collection of garbage or the supply of 
electricity and water. The picture is further distorted when 
the report goes on to say that Parliament is "subordinate to the 
executive branch." 
  A more realistic and faithful appraisal of the political 
structure in the Kingdom would reveal that for all intents and 
purposes His Majesty King Husayn does not exercise more 
prerogatives than for example the president of the U.S. or any 
other chief executive in many developed countries, not to 
mention developing nations. If the authority of the Monarch to 
dissolve Parliament under special conditions is what bothers the 
U.S., then it is fair to say that the exercises of this power 
has been carried out with maximum discretion and in a manner 
that is echoed in many democratic states. 
  Besides, a Jordanian prime minister is anything but a 
"mayor" 
of sorts. All of us who are privy to the political scene in the 
Kingdom know only too well that the King hands over nearly 90 
per cent of the rein if not more to the prime minister and his 
team of ministers. Some of us are dismayed by such an excessive 
transfer of power and wish that the King involved himself a bit 
more in the management of the country. 
  This line of analysis leads the State Department to the 
equally invalid allegation that Parliament is subordinate to the 
executive branch. I presume that the prime minister and his 
cabinet are viewed as part and parcel of the executive branch. 
If this is the case, as it should be, then the impression left 
by the remark that the legislature plays second fiddle to the 
cabinet needs to be corrected, especially if the current phase 
of Jordanian democracy is taken into consideration. Surely it 
is acknowledged and appreciated that the contemporary and 
ancient history of the country is full of precedents where 
governments were voted out of office by the Lower House of 
Parliament. 
  In the second paragraph of the report, there is also a 
submission that "whereas the government has revoked martial law 
directives, important elements of martial law remain operative." 
  By way of example, the report refers to the "broad scope of 
police powers," as evidence of the continuation of the spirit of 
a martial law regime in the country. To begin with, martial law 
as such is a different subject from police powers per se. The 
former suspends constitutional rights while the latter reflects 
as policy issue on crime and punishment that is not necessarily 
related to martial law regimes. 
  Without suggesting for a moment that policy can have a 
license to arrest and detain people without any legal guidelines 
or constraints, many of us in Jordan do not wish to curtail the 
power of the police to the extent that many western nations have 
done at the expense of internal law and order. No nation would 
want to have criminals loose in the streets and witness the 
commission of crimes that can be preventable. U.S. President 
Bill Clinton has made this very issue the theme of his annual 
address to the Congress earlier this year and called for a more 
effective policy and judicial measures to combat rampant crime 
in his country. The most recent U.S. statistics on crime 
releaved that the prison population in the U.S. has risen 
threefolded since 1974. No one can deny that the increase of 
crime in the U.S. is related, inter alia, to the 
disproportionate increase in legal safeguards offered to 
suspects. For many of us in Jordan, the choice in favour of a 
crime-free society is also a priority and we are not prepared to 
allow marginal legal technicalities stand in the way of keeping 
criminals off the streets. 
  In this vein, Jordanians do not wish to condone torture or 
the ill treatment of detainees or prisoners. As a matter of 
fact, Jordan has ratified the Convention against Torture in 1992 
as evidence of its policy against mistreatment of suspects and 
prisoners. It is also a fitting reminder that Jordan had 
ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (ICCPR) as far back as 1977. (As a footnote, the U.S. 
acceded to the ICCPR only two years ago!). So when the report 
states that "physical abuse of prisoners during interrogation 
and detention continues to occur," one can only say that this is 
probably true on limited occasions and needs therefore to be 
combated. Yet suggesting that such police excesses, when they 
occur reflect a state policy, makes the report in need of 
correction. Many nations, including some of the most advanced 
ones, suffer from police brutality. Most probably, the extent 
of the problem in Jordan is greater than that in the West. Yet 
it is also fair to say that this phenomenon in Jordan has more 
to do with police training and discipline than with any current 
state policy. 
  What puzzled me most about the report in question, however, 
is the statement in the fourth paragraph to the effect that 
"citizens do not have the right to change their government." 
How absurd can one be! Where in the world do citizens have the 
inalienable and absolute right to change their governments by 
any means? Do the Americans, for example, have the right to 
change the republican form of their government? Nations have 
constitutions which draw the parameters of their respective 
systems of political structure. Jordan is no different and 
enjoys a written constitution that deserves also to be respected 
and upheld. 
  On the issue of freedom of speech and press, there was also 
a 
mention of the view that the "government in Jordan continues to 
exercise limited censorship of local media." Without suggesting 
that we in Jordan have reached perfection in the exercise of 
free press, the Malhas affair and its wide and unimpeded 
coverage is a vivid example of how much press is free in Jordan. 
When the shocking disclosure about the state of food and 
medicine was freely aired by the media, then there is no cause 
for alarm about freedom of thought in Jordan. We certainly have 
more to go before we attain the level of free press that some 
western nations enjoy, but we are certainly well on our way in 
that direction. The only constraint that Jordan insists on in 
this context is to exercise this right in a responsible way, 
something that most nations would insist on, undoubtedly. In 
this vein, the call for making Jordan television more 
independent is increasinly gaining more currency and could very 
well be in the pipeline. 
  To sum it up, Jordan is not perfect in its human rights 
record, but which country is? Moreover, Jordan stands out among 
the other states of the region as indeed examplary in its 
efforts to spring new roots for its democratic process. This 
much was not reflected in the State Department's report on 
Jordan for 1993.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA)--An official security source in 
the Interior Ministry today denied a report carried last night 
by the French news agency AFP about four persons seriously 
wounded in an explosion yesterday in a commercial district in 
the city of Tanta in al-Gharbiyah Governorate on the central 
Delta. 
  The official also denied information the agency attributed 
to 
the police: that the bomb, which was planted in a shop, was the 
same type found in terrorist dens in the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' 
neighborhood of Cairo early this month. The official pointed 
out that the French agency said that the Islamic Group has 
decided to avenge the death of its seven members in al-Zawiyah 
al-Hamra' and that the group has carried out five operations, 
the last of which was an attack on a bus carrying Romanians and 
Egyptians in Asyut yesterday. He remarked that certain foreign 
news agencies tried to portray the operation as an attack 
against a tourist bus to blow the incident out of proportion and 
misrepresent the state of security and stability. 
  The official noted that the agencies carried the distorted 
report in spite of the fact that a security source in the 
Interior Ministry had issued a statement refuting it. The 
source said in his statement that preliminary inspection 
affirmed that the person who fired at the bus had no intention 
of hurting anyone and that he only wanted to get back at the 
company that owns the bus for dismissing some of its workers. 
  The official affirmed that the AFP report is groundless and 
that the truth was spelled out in a detailed Interior Ministry 
statement. That statement explained that as merchant Sa'id Ahmad 
'Ali, a junkyard owner, was loading a truck with junk from his 
shop bound for the Iron and Steel Factory in Musturud a piece of 
junk exploded. Seven passersby sustained superficial wounds, 
were taken to the hospital for first aid, and were later 
released. The statement added that the explosion resulted from 
an artillery shell, a leftover from the war. 
  The source noted that AFP added to its report what other 
foreign news agencies called "a statement by terrorist groups," 
as though it wanted to arouse threats by terrorist groups. It 
did so despite earlier announcements by the Interior Ministry on 
various occasions that terrorist elements are being hit, that 
the security agencies now have the initiative, and that the 
agencies will not hesitate in waging a deterrent confrontation 
until the last terrorist is eliminated in Egypt. 
  The security official warned that the Interior Ministry will 
take legal measures against these reports, which are even more 
serious than the criminal acts committed by terrorists because 
they aim to hurt Egypt and its status and civilization. 
  The official added that the Egyptian press and the Egyptian 
news agency, MENA, realized AFP's ill-willed lies and attached 
no significance to them. 
  He concluded that the Interior Ministry can only reiterate 
the credibility and esteem attributed to the honest men of the 
media in Egypt, who stand in the same trench with the security 
organs and all the nationalist and political powers to defend 
Egypt's security. The ministry expresses its appreciation of 
foreign and world news agency correspondents in Egypt who are 
bound by objectivity and honesty and reiterates that it will 
maintain cooperation with them.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA)--The security agencies have 
delivered a good preemptive strike at the elements of terrorism 
and subversion based on a security strategy of taking the 
initiative in all security operations, which has evolved into a 
pattern of dealing with fugitive terrorists to foil their 
criminal plots. 
  Yesterday's preemptive strike against a number of terrorists 
has confirmed that all branches of the security authorities are 
working within a framework of complete coordination and 
cooperation to confront these terrorists and place them under 
constant attack. The strike was also a message to other 
fugitive terrorists, warning them that any acts they might 
commit are doomed to fail, especially in light of the prevailing 
national unity and the complete popular support for the security 
agencies and all their actions. 
  This preemptive strike is the fourth of its kind to take 
place in the center of a heavily populated poor neighborhood, in 
which no citizen or policeman was hit. 
  The first blow was the arrest of nine terrorists who carried 
out the failed attempt to assassinate the prime minister on 25 
November, during which not a single shot was fired. They are 
currently being tried by a military tribunal. 
  The second blow was in the al-Ma'sarah incident during 
security sweeps in the area where two terrorists were killed and 
two others, one of whom was a Palestinian, were arrested. In 
this incident a dangerous terrorist named Tharwat Hajjaj managed 
to escape, only to meet his death yesterday along with two 
others in a clash in the al- Sayyidah Zaynab neighborhood. 
  The third blow was delivered in the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' 
area 
late in January against terrorist hideouts, in which seven 
dangerous terrorists, known as the Asyut group, were killed and 
no civilians or security men were hit.

  [Raghib] How do you explain the president's nonrecognition 
of 
the Brotherhood? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] I do not know yet on what basis the president 
denies our existence. He always stresses that he will never 
recognize us, now or in the future. There is no way or 
opportunity to meet him and discuss this issue and, at least, to 
find out his reasons for not recognizing us. 
  [Raghib] Is there any hope that the Brotherhood will 
participate in the national dialogue? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Various and differing statements have been 
issued by the Presidential Office. All of them call for the 
political forces to participate in the dialogue. When Dr. 
Usamah al-Baz, Foreign Ministry first under secretary and 
director of the President's Office for political affairs, was 
asked whether the Islamic groups will be invited to the 
dialogue, he said it is a political and social necessity to 
invite them and that all groups will be invited as long as they 
adhere to the Constitution and the law and not to violence. 
Ibrahim Nafi', chairman of the board and chief editor of 
AL-AHRAM, also referred to this point in several articles he 
wrote. We deduced from these articles that he had received 
political instructions to emphasize the participation of the 
political forces in the dialogue. 
  [Raghib] Do we understand from this that the optimistic 
statements that came out at the beginning prompted you to 
prepare to participate in the dialogue? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We did in fact begin to prepare for the 
dialogue. We participated with all the other opposition parties 
in all the meetings that were held specifically to prepare for 
this dialogue. We signed the opposition parties' statement 
addressed to the regime. 
  [Raghib] Putting aside the nonrecognition, what is 
preventing 
you from submitting whatever action programs you have to the 
dialogue if you are not able to participate in it? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Like any active force in the nation, we could 
contribute our ideas, cultural views, and capabilities on the 
issues that will be raised in the dialogue, just like any 
popular force that is active in issues that are of concern to 
the people. 
  [Raghib] What is the reaction inside the Muslim Brotherhood 
to your exclusion from the dialogue? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We definitely regret this stand. We were hoping 
that the dialogue would be a genuine national one, because such 
a dialogue would embrace all the active forces in the homeland. 
If you exclude one active force, you are contradicting the 
principles of the democratic system. It would also mean that 
the dialogue would encompass just a part of the homeland, not 
all of it. 
  [Raghib] What has your group decided since the recent stand? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We have no choice now but to obtain a license 
to 
register the Muslim Brotherhood Party. Issuing a license is not 
in the hands of the Parties Committee [in the People's 
Assembly], but is well within the powers of the president of the 
republic himself. 
  [Raghib] But the regime opposes the establishment of an 
Islamic party, so that the Copts will not ask to establish a 
Christian party. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] The regime's justification is weak and 
politically motivated. I believe there is no harm in 
establishing a Christian party vis-a-vis an Islamic party. In 
1948, and before the parties law was issued, the Muslim 
Brotherhood was religiously and politically active without the 
Copts demonstrating against it. On the contrary, relations with 
them were very good, and they still are. 
  [Raghib] We all know about the Muslim Brotherhood's activity 
before the revolution and until it clashed with the regime in 
1954, when an edict dissolving it was issued. Why does the 
group insist on engaging in political activity? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Political action has always been part of the 
Muslim Brotherhood's policy. We have no choice here; passages 
in the Koran and Sunnah [Prophet Muhammad's sayings and deeds] 
contain many provisions concerning government and politics. 
Since the group was established in 1928, those of our religion 
have proved their patriotism at all times. 
  [Raghib] Are you seeking to gain power? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] All political forces and parties seek power; 
this right is not exclusive to a certain party or group. But 
this should be done in a legitimate way through genuine 
democracy and free elections. It is the right of every Egyptian 
political force to seek power, and we are one of them. 
  [Raghib] The current Muslim Brotherhood is accused of being 
an extension of the group's prerevolution military wing. What 
about this? What about the linkage between the Muslim 
Brotherhood and the acts of violence? 
  [AL-WAFD] Al-Hudaybi forcefully denied this accusation, 
saying it is intended to discredit the Muslim Brotherhood. He 
said the current leaders of the group have nothing to do with 
anything related to a military or underground organization. He 
added: 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We work publicly, and I reject any linkage 
between violence and the Brotherhood. It is well known that we 
condemn terrorism and violence. 
  [Raghib] What about internal differences within the Muslim 
Brotherhood? 
  [AL-WAFD] Al-Hudaybi denied the existence of any blocs or 
trends within the group, but he stressed that there is freedom 
of opinion. He said it is impossible for the whole group to 
have the same opinion. 
  [Raghib] What about your relations with Muslim Brotherhood 
groups abroad? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] The Islamic Brotherhood emerged in Egypt. 
People in various Arab and non-Arab countries then accepted its 
principles either through books or immigration. They shared the 
group's thought and policy and established groups in their own 
countries. Here, we find great similarity in thought and way of 
acting, but every group adapts according to the circumstances of 
its country.

  [Text] According to a senior Egyptian official, the U.S. 
ambassador in Cairo told the Egyptian prime minister: "The U.S. 
Administration has received information that terrorist groups 
are planning to carry out attacks against U.S. tourists in 
Egypt." 
  The official says this information was behind an alert the 
United States issued to its citizens concerning the possibility 
of attacks against them. The Egyptian prime minister told the 
U.S. ambassador that Egypt's competent authorities have no 
information or evidence in this regard. The prime minister 
asked the ambassador to provide the Egyptian Government with any 
information that Washington has on this so that the two 
countries might cooperate in facing any possible threat to 
tourists. Washington and Cairo are holding consultations on 
this issue.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA)--Somalia's Mohamed Abdoh Hashi, 
leader of the United Somali Party [name and title as received], 
praised Egypt's support for the efforts being made to solve the 
Somali problem and implement the Addis Ababa Agreement. 
  In a statement he made today following his meeting with 
Ambassador Sa'id Ramadan, assistant foreign minister for African 
affairs, he said he briefed the Egyptian official on the latest 
developments in the Somali problem and exchanged views with him 
on the means to solve the Somali crisis. 
  Asked about incidents in the Somali town of Kismaayo, he 
said 
they were regrettable incidents, resulting from attempts by 
Aidid's people to create tension, especially as the parties in 
Kismaayo were on the verge of achieving national reconciliation. 
He added that Somalia is enjoying stability in most of its 18 
provinces with the exception of some places where there is 
tension. 
  Hashi said he will meet tomorrow with Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid and discuss the role the Arab 
League can play to help the Somali people and in achieving 
national reconciliation. 
  Hashi is the first Somali leader to arrive in Cairo 
following 
the Egyptian Foreign Ministry's invitation to all the Somali 
leaders to unite their positions and start implementing the 
Addis Ababa agreement to solve the Somali problem.

  [Text] President 'Umar al-Bashir signed Constitutional 
Decree No. 10 relating to the division of Sudan into 26 states 
at the Republican Palace yesterday evening. He said in a speech 
he delivered at the official ceremony held to mark the occasion 
that the country is entering a unique constitutional phase as 
Sudan will be administered by 26 state governments in addition 
to the federal government. He pointed out that each government 
will enjoy executive and legislative powers which the citizens 
have never experienced in the remote areas. He said that the 
powers and jurisdictions of the governors and ministers have 
been defined in a clearer and more comprehensive form. 
  President al-Bashir said that the Bureau of Federal 
Governance must be regarded as responsible for following up the 
implementation of federal governance in the states as well as 
linking the states with one another, and linking them to the 
federal government to facilitate proceedings and to save the 
time of officials in the states. 
  Lt. Gen. al-Bashir said that measures will be taken in the 
coming days to regulate the work of the legislative councils and 
to define their powers to complete the effective consultative 
framework. He confirmed the role of the Transitional National 
Assembly which will take part in legislation and the 
introduction of amendments and endorsements. His Excellency 
stressed that Sudan will continue its march toward the 
implementation of the revolutionary slogans despite the 
conspiracies of the enemies of the nation to torpedo the 
cultural scheme. 
  His Excellency appealed to the citizens to support their new 
state governments by working continuously to arouse everybody's 
energies and to utilize their capabilities to strengthen the 
march toward stability and development. President al-Bashir 
recommended to the governments of the new states the need to 
take care of the weak, the elderly, the widowed, and orphaned in 
line with social assistance objectives because it is through 
them that God showers his mercy and removes the people's plight.

  [Text] Nairobi, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Sudan's Islamic 
fundamentalist military government is allegedly massing child 
soldiers in neighbouring Zaire and the Central African Republic 
[CAR] to attack southern rebels, relief officials said Monday 
[14 February]. 
  A major government offensive against the black and mainly 
Christian rebels, weakened by internal divisions, has driven 
more than 100,000 southerners towards the Ugandan border. "We 
have had reports of a massive military buildup along the border 
with the Central African Republic, and there are similar reports 
from Zaire," Michael Semmler of the German relief agency Action 
Africa in Need told a news conference in the Kenyan capital 
Nairobi after a two-day visit to rebel-held territory in 
southern Sudan. 
  Justin arop Yac of the relief wing of the rebel Sudan 
People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said Khartoum had "bribed local 
officials" to turn a blind eye to the massing of Sudanese troops 
in remote, notoriously lawless areas of Zaire and the Central 
African Republic bordering Sudan. "Most of the soldiers are 
just young boys, aged 12 to 15," Yac told AFP. Several foreign 
relief agencies said they had also received persistent reports 
of child soldiers grouped just over the borders ready to attack 
the rebels from behind. The number of troops reportedly poised 
to attack was unknown. 
  UN officials said aid to millions of Sudanese verging on 
starvation in the drought-hit south has been disrupted by a 
recent government ban on relief flights to key areas along the 
border. The ban was apparently timed to cut off food to 
southerners as the government offensive gathered momentum, 
private relief officials said. 
  The onslaught by government warplanes and tens of thousands 
of troops could be Khartoum's final push to crush the southern 
rebellion, diplomats and aid workers said. 
  The United Nations has warned foreign aid workers and 
missionaries around Yambio, near the southern border with Zaire, 
that they may be endangered by fighting as the government 
presses on with a major offensive against the rebels. Most aid 
workers have already withdrawn from areas near the Ugandan 
border. 
  Four nuns and three priests of the Comboni order have been 
told to leave Nzara, a few kilometres (miles) west of Yambio, 
Semmler said. 
  He confirmed a claim by John Garang's mainstream SPLA 
faction 
to have recaptured the southern town of Mundri, near the Zairean 
border, last weekend, only hours after it fell to government 
troops. 
  Semmler appealed to the UN security council to enforce a 
"no-fly zone" over southern Sudan to stop the government bombing 
civilians and force it to allow in food aid. "The war is no 
longer a military war where armies fight each other," Semmler 
said. "It is a war where the government of Sudan fights the 
civilian population in the south. This war is an ongoing human 
rights violation." 
  The US government has protested against the bombing of 
civilians in rebel-held areas by government warplanes, and UN 
secretary-general Butros Butros-Ghali has also expressed concern. 
  Khartoum denies the offensive and blames unrest in the south 
on fighting between Garang's faction and an SPLA splinter group 
led by Riak Machar who broke with Garang in 1991. 
  An AFP correspondent, however, witnessed a government 
bombing 
raid last week on Pageri village, near the town of Nimule on the 
Ugandan border, that killed seven people. 
  Yac said the Arabic-speaking northerners were waging "a 
genocidal war, a war of ethnic cleansing" against the black 
southerners, and were deliberately trying to starve civilians. 
  He backed Mashar's recent accusation that the government was 
organising slave raids on southern villages, and settling 
Arabic- speaking northerners on land seized from the largely 
Christian and animist Africans. 
  Relief officials said dozens of Sudanese boys had recently 
returned to Sudan from a refugee camp in northern Kenya 
sheltering more than 10,000 boys separated from their families 
by the decade-old war. There was speculation that they had gone 
to join rebel fighters, the officials said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General 'Abd-al-Rahman Sa'id, </F>
deputy leader of the Legitimate Command of the Sudanese Army, by 
Talhah Jibril in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [Jibril] You were in charge of the Army's command. 
Why did you not fight al-Bashir's coup? 
  [Sa'id] I will go back a little to talk about the memorandum 
handed to al-Sadiq al-Mahdi's government. In this memorandum we 
spoke about the neglect suffered by the Armed Forces. We asked 
the government to pay attention to our Armed Forces, and to 
achieve that we demanded that all parties participate in 
government and that a solution to the problem of the south 
should be found. 
  The memorandum was signed by all officers of the Armed 
Forces 
command. And everyone pledged not to embark on any coup 
attempt. Because we believed that some officers might seize the 
opportunity to seize power. At the same time the National 
Islamic Front [led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi] began to criticize 
the Army's command on the pretext that the Armed Forces command 
was working to remove the Front from government -- which was 
untrue, because we did not speak about one party in particular. 
Actually we broached Sudan's problem and the civil war in the 
south. Even though some officers spoke openly about the need to 
seize power, our position as a command was the need to safeguard 
democracy and protect the democratic experiment. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Jibril] As the Legitimate Command, what are your means to 
restore legitimacy? 
  [Sa'id] In September 1990 we issued the political 
declaration, through which we addressed every member of the 
Armed Forces. We told them that what had happened was a trick 
aimed at the Armed Forces. So now that matters have become 
clear, the Army elements must work with us to get rid of this 
situation so that the Armed Forces' dignity can be restored. 
The statement encountered a great response inside the Armed 
Forces. We pointed out in the statement that we as the 
Legitimate Command favor changing the regime from within the 
Armed Forces, not from abroad or with foreign assistance. And 
indeed a large number of officers and noncommissioned officers 
responded to us. We were about to finish the regime off, but 
some mistakes caused the plan to be foiled and aborted. So the 
first option remains to change the regime through the Armed 
Forces. As for the second option, it is to work with the 
Democratic National Grouping to restore democracy. This is why 
we spoke to the officers inside the Armed Forces or those 
officers who have been dismissed about the need to remove the 
regime through mass action and military action. We did not say 
which should happen first. 
  [Jibril] Do you take into account the possibility of the 
popular defense militias' aborting any move designed to change 
the regime? 
  [Sa'id] True, it will not be easy to change it, and the 
Popular Defense Forces must be taken into account. But you 
should also know that the forces trained by the regime are not 
all loyal to the National Islamic Front. Independent elements 
have also joined the Popular Defense Forces. We have all the 
details relating to the popular defense forces, whether with 
regard to their camps or armament. And when the change process 
begins, we will work to neutralize these forces. But we must 
expect losses and casualties, because we are aware of the 
regime's viciousness. We will confront them with the same 
viciousness. [passage omitted] 
  [Jibril] There is talk about the existence of camps inside 
Sudan to train fundamentalist groups from various parts of the 
Arab and Islamic worlds. What is your information in this 
connection? 
  [Sa'id] We have comprehensive information about this issue. 
We warned about the existence of such camps a long time ago. We 
submitted maps showing the places where these extremist groups 
receive their training. We have our sources inside the country 
and inside the Armed Forces. They supply us with this 
information. We have handed this information to the quarters 
concerned. But some of these quarters have concealed this 
information. When the regime discovered the accuracy of our 
information, it moved the camps to other places. [passage 
omitted]

Liberation Army-United, by unidentified correspondent; place and 
date not given: "No to Islam" -- first paragraph is PANORAMA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Before breaking away from the SPLA [Sudanese 
People's Liberation Army] and founding SPLA-United in 1991, Riek 
Mashar, the "Commander," was one of the most feared military 
leaders in Colonel John Garang's entourage. PANORAMA 
interviewed him. 
  [PANORAMA] Your movement is mostly Nuer. Garang is a Dinka. 
Was this the reason for your dispute? 
  [Mashar] No. The reasons are political. Garang is a 
despotic and autocratic dictator who recruits kids from the 
refugee camps and violates human rights. In addition, he wants 
a federal state while I think that there is no alternative to a 
completely independent south: The unification imposed by the 
English in 1946 has no historical basis. The Khartoum regime 
has massacred and starved the population there for years, and 
now it wants to impose the laws of Islam and the Arabic language 
on the south. But it will not succeed. The Muslims are 
entitled to claim membership of the Arab nation, but we claim 
our right to assert our Christian and African roots. We will 
fight until we win independence. 
  [PANORAMA] Your divisions favor Khartoum's strategy. Is it 
impossible for you to reach an agreement with Col. Garang? 
  [Mashar] On 6 January we met and identified some common 
aims. 
A global accord is still a long way off, but we cannot lose more 
time. The Sudanese Army has launched a new offensive and the 
civilian population is at the end of its strength. We have to 
stop the genocide of our people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, secretary general of </F>
the Islamic Arab People's Congress, by Yusuf Khazim in Khartoum; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Khazim] What is the status of the National 
Islamic Front [NIF] in Sudan? Could it be described as the 
government's party or is it indeed the government itself? If 
not, what is its relationship with the regime? 
  [Al-Turabi] Observers of the dominant aspects of general 
political life in Sudan should talk about the Islamic trend 
because that trend is growing and developing in the fields of 
education and all walks of civilized life, including the 
cultural, economic, technical, and other aspects. That trend 
has assumed several names but not as a traditional party 
inheriting the same positions within the same structures. The 
NIF did not only end when it was officially dissolved along with 
all the Sudanese parties, but its own people also put an end to 
it because after every political development in Sudan they 
usually finished their political movement even when it took the 
form of a party or a movement with a different name and 
structure, fully different in its regional, class, and social 
structure from the previous movement. 
  Truly, the NIF does not exist publicly or secretly, but the 
majority of the trend which used to be the NIF supports the 
current regime. But there are many waves of the Islamic trend 
which the salvation government upholds, and many trends from 
other parties which had a religious base have transformed their 
traditional sectarian and partisan religious character into a 
religious character that is now called fundamentalism abroad. 
  [Khazim] Is there a constituent framework embodying that 
trend? 
  [Al-Turabi] The current political system does not represent 
one political party. The NIF never believed in a one-party 
government because that would not be in line with Islamic 
principles. The political system consists of frameworks, not 
parties. They are frameworks for consultation and free public 
opinion. But if you look at the structure of the regime you 
would find frameworks from known parties which, although they 
were in disagreement in the past, are all Islamists in their 
general outlook, with the exception of the Christians. Even the 
Christians are aware of this general trend and they react to it. 
  The truth is that the NIF does not exist but political 
observers always try to see a secret plot behind the apparent 
signs and try to attribute that to one or several individuals. 
A large number of the NIF leaders now play no part in the 
general policy. The government and the new political regime are 
endeavoring to present themselves as a general national Islamic 
trend, a trend that is more comprehensive for the south and the 
north than any former party. [passage omitted] 
  [Khazim] You were the NIF's leader and now you are 
emphasizing that it does not exist in Sudan. How do we identify 
you now? 
  [Al-Turabi] I am the secretary general of the Islamic Arab 
People's Congress [IAPC] but I am also known worldwide as a 
representative, in the general Islamic ideology, of a certain 
trend in all the world and not just in Sudan. I respond to the 
Islamic trend in Central and Southern Asia, Africa, and the Arab 
world and I prefer to be associated with that trend 
historically. [passage omitted] 
  [Khazim] Does the IAPC seek to bring all the Islamic 
trends together within a particular constituent framework? 
  [Al-Turabi] We do not want to bring them together within an 
organizational leadership-linked framework because every Islamic 
reality has its own history and its own particular and different 
issues, but the general Islamic trend also has a common cause 
with trends in other cultures now upheld in the West, for 
instance. There are now very close worldwide links. A human 
being now is not confined to a certain nationality or region. 
The various parts of the world are now open to one another in 
their media, economies, alliances, security, and other 
relations. That is why I want this trend to focus its vision, 
which is derived from Islamic values, on the world challenges 
and to address all the world and all its perceived historical 
realities. [passage omitted] 
  We want to lay the foundation as to how this trend, as one 
nation, should deal with other trends, hold a dialogue with 
rational moderate Christianity, answer the sometimes fanatical 
crusade campaigns which sometimes attack Islam without knowing 
much about it, protect against the many tragedies Muslims are 
currently suffering in all continents, and defend the Muslims in 
these places in the media or supply them with the means of jihad 
in defense of their rights. We want this Islamic trend to 
provide defense against human injustice and address humanitarian 
issues in general. The trend is now developing from its old 
structure into these wider horizons. 
  [Khazim] In that context does the IAPC seek to change any 
particular political situations? 
  [Al-Turabi] In its endeavor to reach all Islamic peoples, 
the IAPC does not intend to attack any particular governments 
because it does not want tense relations (with these 
governments) that would put a barrier between it and the Islamic 
peoples. Often governments isolate their people and do not 
really represent their people. We want the Islamic peoples to 
be open to one another but at the same time we do not want the 
IAPC to have any tense relations because we do not want it to 
represent an opposition to any particular regime. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Khazim] How does the IAPC view the recourse to violence by 
some Islamic groups in Egypt and other countries as a way of 
changing the regimes in these countries? 
  [Al-Turabi] I do not wish to talk about any country in 
particular, but I know that the current Islamic awakening is 
throughout the Islamic world, certainly in the Arab world 
because the Arabs have led the Islamic movement historically and 
they are closer to the origins of Islam than non-Arab Muslims. 
That is what I notice in North Africa generally and also in 
other countries. 
  The new phenomena in the course of historical change might 
be 
acceptable to some old regimes and might be given freedom, in 
which case they come cleanly and gradually contribute to the 
positive evolution of realities, and perhaps resort to dialogue 
about, say, the negative aspects of their views. But if they 
collide with advocates of old realities seeking to maintain 
their domination, concepts, and economic interests, pressures 
might push them underground into secret and private activity 
that would erupt in a form of jihad or something else, for a 
government's violence and pressure is met with counterviolence 
and pressure. I regret to say that most signs of mutual 
pressures and conflicts were started by old ruling regimes 
seeking to maintain their power. World events were all like 
that, in France, Russia, China, America, and Britain. 
Sometimes, however, the new movements hastily resort to 
violence to the advantage of nobody or are forced to use 
violence for lack of other means. That is a mistake. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Khazim] Does the IAPC advocate dialogue in this connection? 
  [Al-Turabi] One of the IAPC's important characteristics is 
that it has mostly advocated dialogue and recommended dialogue 
between the various Islamic countries and between various forces 
within Islamic countries such as Afghanistan and Yemen, and also 
between regimes and groups seeking change, as in Algeria. It 
recommended dialogue and tolerence. [passage omitted] 
  [Khazim] Isayas Afewerki, head of the Eritrean provisional 
government, has accused you as NIF leader of forming the 
Eritrean Islamic Jihad Movement and has accused you of trying to 
destabilize his country. He held Sudan responsible for the 
infiltration of foreign gunmen across the borders to carry out 
military operations against his forces. What is your reply to 
these charges? 
  [Al-Turabi] First, Afewerki only left Sudan a few years 
ago. Perhaps he was talking about the past when Sudan had 
parties and the NIF and before that. The Islamic trends 
supported the Eritrean liberation movement for dozens of years. 
Afewerki himself used to visit it (the NIF) and get media 
coverage from it. 
  True, the NIF tried to bring together the various (Eritrean) 
Islamic trends and in fact did so in the Eritrean Islamic Jihad 
Movement at a time when the Eritreans were forming movements for 
the liberation of their country. 
  [Khazim] Why does he accuse you? 
  [Al-Turabi] Because he was talking about Sudan's old 
history. The NIF hadsdone him very great services, which he 
knows very well. I visited him in his home town after he 
achieved independence and he visited me more than once in my 
home after becoming president. Perhaps he got angry with the 
Jihad Movement and judged it on the basis of what he knew about 
Sudan. Now the Sudanese Government bans all activities of all 
the Eritrean movements and fronts except the ruling "Popular 
Front." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Indian Designs -- The Need for Caution"] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister Aftab Shaban Mirani has said that 
there is no danger of war with India, but our Armed Forces are 
fully vigilant and are keeping a close watch on the situation 
along the border. When asked about the Indian threat of a 
limited war on the Line of Control, the defense minister 
observed that wars are never limited, but I am confident that 
there is no real danger of an India-Pakistan war at this time. 
  The defense minister also expressed his view on 
Pakistan-U.S. 
relations and expressed the hope that some ways and means will 
be found to repeal the Pressler Amendment. We have paid $658 
million for F-16 aircraft and $1 billion in total and we are 
still hopeful that a way will be found to supply these aircraft. 
We are, however, also considering acquiring aircraft from other 
sources to strengthen our Air Force, the defense minister added. 
  The defense minister's view that there is no danger of an 
India-Pakistan war at the moment is encouraging. Pakistan, 
nonetheless, needs to be more vigilant in view of Indian 
designs. Just the other day, Indian Home Minister S.B. Chavan 
told a news conference in New Delhi that if the law and order 
situation in Kashmir does not improve, it will lead to serious 
consequences. He ruled out any negotiations with the Kashmiris 
to resolve the struggle. The fact is that the Indian attitude 
is becoming more and more aggressive, with an increase in 
tension in Kashmir. Recently, Indian President Shankar Dayal 
Sharma made a personal attack on Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, 
ignoring all diplomatic protocol. Two members of the Indian 
Cabinet have also attacked Bhutto personally. These incidents 
can help one easily assess India's thinking and attitude. Under 
these circumstances, Pakistan cannot overlook its defense even 
for a moment. 
  Pakistan has been continuously striving to resolve its core 
dispute with India peacefully. Foreign Minister Sardar Asif 
Ahmad Ali also said today that he wants to resolve the Kashmir 
dispute with India through peaceful means. He disclosed that 
during the recent meeting of the Nonaligned Movement, he met 
Indonesian President Suharto and proposed that the Nonaligned 
Movement play the role of mediator to resolve the Kashmir 
dispute. He also told Suharto that if India were to nominate 
him as mediator or agreed to set up a committee, either of the 
above would be acceptable to Pakistan. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali 
said that even though bilateral disputes cannot be discussed at 
the platform of the Nonaligned Movement, he has suggested that 
the organization find a way to help resolve the basic dispute 
between the two member-states -- India and Pakistan. The 
Pakistan foreign minister's observations make it amply clear 
that we are ready to go to any possible extent to resolve all 
our differences with India peacefully. 
  In her recent interview with the BBC, Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto revealed that she helped Rajiv Gandhi contain the 
insurgency in Punjab and she did this because she did not 
consider interference in internal affairs of any other country 
appropriate. At that time, the movement of the Sikhs was 
continuing with all its intensity and it could have resulted in 
anything. An independent Khalistan state could have also come 
into being in east Punjab. It is possible that certain circles 
inside Pakistan may make Benazir Bhutto a target of their 
criticism in the wake of her aforementioned revelation, but it 
reflects that Pakistan is always willing to go to every possible 
extent to normalize relations with India and to eliminate the 
causes of tension. Unfortunately, the Indian Government has 
never responded to Pakistan's gesture of goodwill with goodwill 
and has rejected all Pakistani proposals to resolve the Kashmir 
dispute through peaceful means. 
  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali has done well to declare that Pakistan 
will not withdraw its resolution on Kashmir from the UN Human 
Rights Commission; and if the resolution is not approved there, 
Islamabad will not desist from taking it to UN General Assembly. 
The foreign minister's declaration makes it clear that while 
Pakistan will continue to do everything possible to achieve a 
peaceful settlement, it will also remain firm on its principled 
stand and will not show any slackness in raising the Kashmir 
issue in international forums. Pakistan is not indulging in a 
confrontation with India, but in view of our bitter experiences 
of the past, we should remain vigilant and cautious against 
Indian designs and run our foreign policy in a manner in which 
the veracity of our stand is revealed to more and more nations 
and international public opinion continues to support our 
legitimate stand.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali </F>
by Randah Taqi-al-Din in Paris on 5 February: "Pakistan Foreign 
Minister to AL-HAYAH: We Do Not Understand the European and U.S. 
Position on Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Paris--Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali 
has said that his country does not understand Europe's position, 
which does not permit Bosnia to defend itself. He accused the 
Americns of doing nothing to stop the war there. He added, in an 
interview with AL-HAYAH conducted in Paris yesterday, that the 
United States had not behaved reasonably towards an important 
partner such as Pakistan, and that the sanctions it imposed have 
hurt his country. 
  The Pakistani foreign minister touched on the Afghan 
question 
in his interview, saying that the reason for the failure of the 
peace accords there was the disqualification of the military 
sides from the solution and opining that there had to be a broad 
solution including all sides. Regarding the Egyptian "Afghans" 
who say that Pakistan expelled them from its territory, he said, 
"It was hard for us to distinguish between Egyptians and 
Sudanese, because they all carried Sudanese passports." 
  Asif Ali further confirmed that his country had made a 
decision to remain in Somalia for as long as its people required 
the presence of Pakistani forces. He also reaffirmed his demand 
that a referendum be held in Kashmir to grant its population the 
freedom of self-determination, and denied that his country had 
any intention to annex this region. The text of the interview 
follows. 
<H5>  Kashmir </H5>
  Regarding the bases upon which, in Pakistan's view, a 
Kashmir 
settlement should rest, he said, "Our view is simple in this 
regard; there must be coexistence between the civilized entities 
of the world, and in accordance with Islamic principles, and 
with what United Nations law stipulates. There are the Security 
Council resolutions on Kashmir that must be implemented, chiefly 
the holding of a referendum by which the residents of Kashmir 
may decide whether they want to join the Indians, or Pakistan." 
  Addressing the likelihood of a Turkish-Pakistani solution in 
Bosnia after the visit of the two countries' prime ministers to 
Sarajevo, he said, "Our position on this crisis is one with that 
of the 52 countries of the Islamic Conference Organization. It 
stipulates the sovereignty of nations and respect for human 
rights. If the sovereignty of one country is destroyed, and that 
is accepted in principle, then the sovereignty of the other 
nations comes into question." 
  He believes that it is essential not to legitimize 
aggression 
through hasty solutions, saying that "a veiled peace will never 
lead to lasting peace; the two world wars are the best proof of 
that. Therefore we do not understand Europe's position. We do 
not understand how Europe made this costly mistake. The results 
of this mistake will be serious and dangerous for the future of 
Europe, the Atlantic alliance, and the UN. My view is that 
depriving a country of the right of self-defense is immoral, and 
we condemn it vigorously. Nor do we understand the reason why 
Europe does not take responsibility for the war going on in the 
middle of the continent. It holds to the principle of 
coexistence among religions and peoples, so why does Europe not 
do so in this matter?" 
  He discussed his belief that the United States has not taken 
a well-defined position on the war in Bosnia; he said that the 
Americans "are not doing a thing." 
<H5>  Relations With Washington </H5>
  On another front, the foreign minister commented on the U.S. 
decision to freeze its aid to Pakistan because of doubts about 
its development of a nuclear bomb. "Traditionally we have had 
excellent relations with the United States, and we hope that 
they will return and resume in order to remove the 
misunderstanding arising primarily from the nuclear issue. The 
American law, known as the Pressler Amendment, forbids us from 
getting weapons systems for which we have paid more than $1 
billion in cash. This harms us and has made us feel that there 
is an anti-Pakistan bias." He added that Islamabad considers 
that the United States "has not behaved reasonably, especially 
towards one of its important partners." As to his nuclear 
policy, he said that he had explained to the three senators who 
visited his country recently that Pakistan had maintained to the 
international community that it will not develop an atomic bomb. 
He confirmed that Islamabad refused to sign the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty because India had not signed it and 
thus the problem was a regional one. He pointed out that his 
country had submitted very significant proposals in this regard. 
"We are ready to sign the treaty as soon as India signs it." 
<H5>  Neighboring Countries </H5>
  Speaking of Pakistan's efforts, with Saudi Arabia, to 
mediate 
between the two warring sides in Afghanistan, he said, "I 
believe that the major groups have not taken part. This is my 
personal view, not as a foreign minister but as a political 
analyst. Now, our inclination is to reach an accord between all 
the neighboring countries of Afghanistan. We all agree on the 
solution, and we say that it must be a broad one embracing all 
sides, from the military men to the jihad factions and others. 
Only then will we be able to achieve a lasting solution, because 
historically, and over two and a half centuries, Afghanistan has 
been a country whose unity was based on a wide-ranging 
alliance." AL-HAYAH asked him whether Pakistan's rapprochement 
with Turkey, was aimed against Iran, and whether it was linked 
to his country's excellent relations with the Gulf states. He 
said, "Our relations with Turkey are not aimed at Iran. Iran is 
a friendly country and very close to us; it is a neighbor, bound 
to us by great understanding, just as with Afghanistan. Our 
relations are aimed at strengthening these ties. Regarding the 
Gulf, unfortunately Iran does not have excellent relations with 
the Gulf states, and some Gulf states are uneasy to some extent, 
especially after Iran seized some islands." 
  Addressing Egypt's request to have the Arab Afghans handed 
over, he said, "There are a number of Egyptian fighters who came 
to Afghanistan and had headquarters in Peshawar; they were 
fighting in Afghanistan and used Peshawar as a base. Some of 
them are charged with acts of terrorism in Egypt. We were 
recently asked to turn them over. It is very hard for us to 
distinguish between who is Egyptian and who is Sudanese, because 
the routes by which they came all passed through Khartoum, and 
their passports with visas from our embassy were Sudanese. The 
Egyptian interior minister and chief of intelligence visited us, 
and our chief of intelligence visited Egypt; I think that they 
can distinguish between an Egyptian for themselves, and a number 
of those were prevented from entering Pakistan." He explained 
that he thought these numbered between 20 and 30, "but we cannot 
hand over citizens with Sudanese passports to Egypt." 
  In response to a question on whether the withdrawal of the 
Europeans and the United States from Somalia would affect the 
mission of the Pakistani forces there, he said, "We do not make 
our decisions based on what the United States and Europe decide. 
We have decided to remain in Somalia for as long as the Somali 
people need us."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Iraq's Expression of Goodwill for Pakistan"] </F>
  [Text] The gesture of goodwill shown by the Iraqi 
Government in releasing Pakistani prisoners in response to a 
letter from Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is praiseworthy. Asif 
Ali Zardari went to Iraq as a special emissary of the prime 
minister with a consignment of medicines and a letter for 
President Saddam Husayn, where he was accorded an enthusiastic 
welcome. He went to seek the release of three Pakistani 
prisoners, but he found out in Baghdad that 24 Pakistanis were 
serving jail terms on various charges in that country. The 
Iraqi authorities, on Zardari's request, tracked down all 
Pakistani prisoners and released them immediately. Now, only 
one Pakistani remains in an Iraqi jail. He is accused of being 
involved in political activities. When Asif Ali Zardari 
returned to Islamabad with eight of the released prisoners, the 
prime minister received them at the airport, thanked the Iraqi 
Government, and noted that the purpose of sending a special 
emissary to Baghdad has been fulfilled. The release of the 
Pakistanis and their return at the beginning of the holy month 
of Ramadan is a source of happiness and joy for the country. 
Efforts will be made to ensure early release of the lone 
Pakistani now held in Iraq. She said we are doing all this for 
the sake of Pakistan's glory and honor at the international 
level and to raise our voice in support of truth and justice. 
We hope the opposition will also cooperate with the government 
in this regard. The prime minister has rightly said that the 
return of the eight released Pakistanis will bring happiness to 
their homes and that a man feels especially happy when he puts 
his feet on the soil of his motherland. 
  In reply to a question about whether Pakistan will help Iraq 
restore its contacts with the rest of the world, the prime 
minister said Pakistan and other countries should work to ensure 
the territorial integrity and independence of Kuwait, so that 
post-Gulf War conditions can reach a logical conclusion. 
Pakistan has maintained traditional relations with Iraq, and we 
want to restore our ties in accordance with the UN resolutions 
and the international situation that emerged after the Gulf War. 
We will do all this within the limits set by the United 
Nations. Vital nations always take care of their nationals no 
matter which part of the world they live in. They provide 
assistance to their nationals whenever they find themselves 
surrounded by difficulties or problems and do not rest until 
their problems are solved. They consider this a matter of 
national ego and honor and are ready to place everything at 
stake to mitigate their suffering. It is not possible for them 
to ignore their citizens. There are numerous examples to show 
that a nation has either declared war against or severed all 
ties with other countries in order to have one or two of its 
citizens released. The present government has set a good 
example in this respect. It has enhanced the prestige of the 
country and the nation at the international level. Within the 
country, it has brought relief and comfort to the families whose 
relatives had been separated from them and nobody had ever 
thought of their release and repatriation. 
  We already had diplomatic ties with Iraq and now an element 
of warmth has been added to them. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
has referred to the limitations and restrictions imposed by the 
United Nations, which we need to observe in view of our 
commitment to the world body. Nonetheless, Pakistan can 
certainly play an effective role in restoring Iraq's ties with 
the rest of the world and it must do so. Normalization of 
Iraq's ties with the international community will create a sort 
of stability in the entire region and will help establish and 
promote international contacts on the basis of mutual respect. 
Iraq's participation will prove particularly useful in efforts 
toward achieving the collective objectives of the Islamic 
countries. 
  Addressing a news conference on his return from Baghdad, 
Asif 
Ali Zardari disclosed that the Iraqi Government is pleased with 
our humanitarian gesture. Iraq was in great need of the 
medicines we provided. Several people have died in Iraq because 
of a shortage and nonavailability of medicines and the common 
people are facing serious difficulties finding food and 
medicines as a result of restrictions imposed by the United 
Nations. Asif Ali Zardari said that he had the impression that 
Iraq would have been destroyed, like Bosnia, as a result of 
120,000 tons of bombs that were dropped on that country during 
the Gulf War, but the Iraqis have rebuilt everything in just two 
years. It has been confirmed from other sources as well that 
Iraq has erased all signs of destruction just one year after the 
war, intentionally leaving a few places in their ruined state as 
war memorials. No other areas bear any sign of destruction 
caused by the war. Zardari said that the Government of Iraq has 
requested that Pakistan send medicines. The request should be 
considered sympathetically and an appeal should be made to the 
United Nations to lift restrictions on the supply of medicines 
and foodstuffs to Iraq on humanitarian grounds. Pakistan's 
efforts in this context will certainly bear fruit. As for the 
dispatch of medicines, there is no restriction in this regard. 
  Pakistan and Iraq enjoy age-old ties. They have interacted 
and cooperated with each other under various agreements and, 
hence, a close and harmonious relationship must be established 
between them. Iraq is full of oil wealth and can provide oil to 
Pakistan on concessional terms. Trade between the two countries 
can also prove mutually beneficial. Anyhow, as stated by the 
prime minister, Pakistan's ties with Iraq can be restored only 
within the limits set by the United Nations. Iraq appreciates 
Pakistan's humanitarian gesture. Pakistan should also 
appreciate Iraq's goodwill gesture and thus the two countries 
should once again become each other's helper and supporter and 
prove a source of strength for the Islamic world.

<F P=106> [Report by Riyad 'Alam-al-Din in Beirut and Nayil Mukhaybar </F>
in Paris] 
  [Text] A few days ago, several West European intelligence 
agencies received a top-secret report warning of armed squads 
arriving in some countries and preparing to carry out armed 
operations in coordination with fundamentalist cells and 
Iranian-supervised and -financed underground organizations. The 
report urged the countries concerned to adopt the most stringent 
precautionary measures in anticipation of an international plot 
with many scenarios that could be implemented by citizens of 
different nationalities and cover a large number of European 
states, headed by Germany and France. 
  The report noted that crucial meetings were held several 
weeks ago in Tehran for this purpose at the Iranian foreign 
intelligence headquarters in Firuzi Palace. The meetings were 
attended by representatives of the world's most dangerous armed 
factions and movements, including the Fatah-Revolutionary 
Council led by Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna]; the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Japanese Red 
Army; the Irish Republican Army; the Armenian Secret Army, 
represented by a woman close to its leader, Hakopian, who was 
assassinated in Athens in 1986; the Lebanese Revolutionary 
Organization established by Murshid Shabu; and the Lebanese 
Hizballah. 
  These organizations were represented by senior officials who 
were responding to an invitation by a high-ranking Iranian 
authority eager to gather in Tehran an assortment of the world's 
most prominent armed networks. It has been learned that Mohsen 
Reza'i, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards 
(Pasdaran); Mohammad Musavi, the information official at the 
Iranian Embassy in Beirut; other leaders of the Iranian hardline 
trend; and coordinators of international armed squads 
participated in these meetings. 
<H5>  A Unified Command and Commandos </H5>
  The report, abridged copies of which were received by 
several 
West European intelligence agencies that follow Iranian moves 
closely, revealed that the meetings focused on the establishment 
of a unified command by Iran for these factions and the 
preparation of a plan to disperse these networks in most 
countries of the world, where they would be ready to strike at 
U.S. and European interests and assassinate politicians and 
diplomats upon receiving a codeword from Iran. This would 
happen if Iran were to be exposed to any attack or international 
blockade or threats seeking to tighten the stranglehold on it, 
increase its political and economic isolation, and provoke 
disturbances and internal strife that endanger its security and 
order. 
  In fact, many intelligence agencies had been following 
Iranian secret moves with great concern since the signing of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord in Washington on 13 September. Since that 
time, these agencies have noticed suspicious activities by 
international networks, Palestinian factions, and fundamentalist 
organizations and movements opposed to the accord. The thread 
of all these activities led to Iran. Then the meetings and 
visits began to intensify. At these meetings, hosted by Tehran, 
plans were drawn up to establish a front opposed to the 
Gaza-Jericho accord that would seek to thwart the accord by 
force. Information indicates that a reward of several million 
dollars was set for anyone who would assassinate Abu-'Ammar 
[Yasir 'Arafat] and that Iran utilized all its ties and contacts 
with the international networks to have them participate in a 
plot starting at the Arab level and ending at the international 
level. Even mercenaries of various nationalities were recruited 
to facilitate this mission and divert suspicion. 
  In recent weeks European intelligence organs have become 
convinced that armed operations will be carried out at a growing 
pace. These organs received information that acts of opposition 
to the Palestinian-Israeli accord, which have begun in the 
occupied territories, will gradually evolve into operations 
covering the entire Palestinian arena, then Lebanon, and later 
will shift to other locations in the world, specifically Europe. 
  This information adds that Iran has opened its Army camps, 
especially (Karnaji) near Qom, to commandos from the General 
Command, Hizballah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. They received 
special training by Iranian Revolutionary Guards officers. At 
the same time, Tehran has asked Sudan to open its camps for 
training special units of "Afghan Arabs" and fundamentalist 
exiles living in European countries. In Lebanon, increasing 
activity has been observed in Hizballah camps in the western 
al-Biqa' where Iranian military advisers have been training 
fundamentalist elements who arrived recently from several Arab 
states in guerrilla warfare, the use of explosives, and car 
bombings. Intelligence reports have emphasized the presence of 
elements from the Japanese Red Army in al-Biqa' and Beirut. 
Those elements have been dispersed in Popular Front-General 
Command centers and camps in al-Biqa'. These reports say that 
the Japanese Red Army elements entered Lebanon witht he 
assistance of the Iranian Embassy and under the supervision of 
"N.N." who works in the foreign operations branch of the Iranian 
foreign intelligence service, headed by 'Ali Fallahian. 
Meanwhile, Asadollah Reza 'Asaker, the Revolutionary Guard 
official in Lebanon, has intensified his secret meetings with 
the commanders of Hizballah's internal and external operations 
units. 
<H5>  Activating the European Networks </H5>
  About two weeks ago Western intelligence organs that 
coordinate antiterrorist operations within the framework of a 
special secret plan codenamed "Kilowatt," which covers more than 
20 Western countries, received reports from their agents in the 
Middle East -- who work in full coordination with their 
counterparts in the region -- urging them to forestall 
derailment of the peace process. Those reports stated that the 
codeword was sent out at the recent meeting in Firuzi Palace and 
that the dispersal of armed networks' elements throughout the 
world had begun, accompanied by "important orders." Apparently, 
the uncovering of a plot prepared by a group affiliated with the 
Abu-Nidal Organization to assassinate an Arab official during 
his participation at the Nonaligned summit in India in the 
middle of this month is part of the international terrorist 
conspiracy hatched in Tehran. The disclosure of the arrival in 
India at the end of last month of Fatah-Revolutionary Council 
groups induced most Western countries, which received 
information about the Tehran mobilization meetings of armed 
fundamentalist, radical, leftist, and separatist movements from 
different countries, to declare a state of maximum alert in 
their security and intelligence organs. In fact, reports from 
several European countries, including France and Germany, 
indicated that suspicious movements by radical networks and 
elements had been observed in their territory and that work had 
begun to reorganize, revive, and activate existing Iranian 
networks in preparation for implementing fresh missions and 
operations. 
  It has been learned that al-Haj "'A.J.," who is Lebanese and 
a Hizballah security official, moved three weeks ago to Iran and 
held intensive meetings with Iranian security officials aimed at 
forming and organizing terrorist networks in a number of 
European countries, especially Germany, a country that is 
well-known to him and in which he had participated in organizing 
several operations. Many meetings have reportedly been held in 
Tehran between this security official and 'Imad Maghniyah, one 
of Hizballah's most prominent elements, whose name was mentioned 
in the kidnapping of Western hostages in Beirut alongside that 
of "'A.J." 
  It is common knowledge that Maghniyah lives in Tehran and 
holds an Iranian diplomatic passport. Western intelligence 
reports mention him as general coordinator of the recently 
reorganized networks in Europe.

  [Text] Under conditions that are reported to be very tense 
in the occupied regions of Palestine because many towns have 
been surrounded by Zionist troops, the Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators have resumed talks in the coastal Egyptian city of 
Taba. Under an agreement concluded between the two sides last 
week, the Palestinian team eventually agreed to jointly man with 
Israel border passages linking the autonomous regions with Egypt 
and Jordan. It has also consented to assign the security of 
Jewish townships and movement of their residents in the occupied 
Palestine to the Zionist army. 
  Of course, conclusion of the agreement last week led to a 
series of protests and objections by various Palestinian parties 
and the Syrian press. According to those opposing the 
agreement, what has actually taken place is the transfer of 
total control of the border check posts to the Zionist regime. 
[Word indistinct] the Israeli troops will have veto power 
concerning movement in the autonomous regions. The Zionist 
regime has even opposed the hoisting of the Palestinian flag on 
the common border check posts. 
  In fact, insistence of the Zionist regime and the United 
States on the conclusion of such an agreement has once again 
proved the reality to the world people that the Israeli claim on 
a just and broad-based peace is totally false. From the outset 
of the negotiations with the Arab delegation, the Zionist regime 
clearly proved the point that it wants peace outside the 
framework of the Security Council resolutions, and with minimum 
concessions to the Arabs. The obstacles which Israel has 
created in the negotiations from the very beginning, either 
during the rightist government's rule or the rule of the present 
leftist faction, clearly showed the point that in the deal what 
cannot be included is the restoration of the lost rights of the 
Arabs. 
  The Zionist regime not only does not honor the agreement 
that 
it has itself signed, but its prime minister clearly announces 
that the timetable for the withdrawal was a mistake right from 
the beginning, and that at least one month is required to reach 
an agreement with the Palestinians. 
  Set against this, the Palestinian nation, with no confidence 
in the Israeli promises and paying no attention to the U.S. 
support -- the main backer of the Zionist regime's attacks -- is 
continuing the struggle by hoisting the flag of the Palestinian 
nation's oppression and taking its just cry on the intifadah 
scene [as heard] to the world people.

  [Text] The Arab-Israeli talks in Washington to resolve the 
long-lasting Middle East problem resumed yesterday after a 
two-week recess. This is the second round of talks in the U.S. 
capital after U.S. President Bill Clinton's meeting with his 
Syrian counterpart, Hafiz al-Asad. 
  These two rounds of talks are significantly different from 
the discussions during the past 11 rounds because of the 
semiopen nature that has been granted to these two rounds of 
talks. A State Department spokesman has also described the 
Arab-Israeli talks as unofficial. This shows that the nature of 
the current talks is actually midway between Israel's persistent 
call for unofficial and closed talks with Syria and Syria's 
insistence on official and open talks within the framework of 
international regulations. Israel is seeking to repeat the 
experience of the secret PLO-Israeli talks with Syria as well. 
However, Damascus, which has strongly criticized this behavior 
by the PLO and Israel, does not want to give in. 
  The second round of the semiovert talks in Washington has 
started away from the limelight at a time when a suitable 
political atmosphere for compromise is not discernible. Syria, 
which had described the signing of the Gaza-Jericho self-rule 
accord in Washington between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv as a blow to 
the Middle East peace process, has described the recent 
PLO-Israeli agreement as a new tragedy. Damascus has also 
stated in advance that any expectation for progress in the 
current talks is useless. The Zionist regime too has called for 
a postponement of the talks or raising the level of the talks. 
  Shim'on Peres, foreign minister of the occupying regime, has 
called for a meeting between the heads of Tel Aviv and Damascus. 
But Syria's political officials say that with this request, 
Israel is trying to escape from the content of the talks and to 
stick only to the form of the talks. 
  The Washington talks concerning Jordan and Palestine are at 
a 
standstill because of the signing of agreements, while the parts 
concerning Syria and Lebanon do not present a very hopeful 
outlook because of Israel's stances, especially when the 
experience of the PLO-Israeli accord has not been able to gain 
much popularity either.

  [Text] A bill for foreign aid in 1994 amounting to $20.861 
billion has been submitted to Congress. The Zionist regime is 
to receive more than $3 billion, while Egypt is to receive 
$2.116 billion of this amount. 
  Political observers believe that such so-called financial 
aid 
is to pursue objectives that are 100-percent political in 
nature. The six-point criteria of the U.S. State Department, 
which is in charge of distributing this aid, does not fully 
justify the method of distribution, and this signals the 
existence of other covert motives. 
  The allocation of more than $6 billion of this aid to boost 
the U.S. economy by expanding commercial ties with East European 
countries and countries of the former Soviet Union shows that 
the major objective of the United States behind such aid is to 
expand its foreign markets by creating dependence. Also, the 
allocation of about $3 billion of this aid to the defense of 
democracy on the international scene reveals another truth. The 
use of this aid by Israel, whose hands are stained with the 
blood of the Palestinian people, as well as by the Egyptian 
regime, which imprisons or murders dozens of combatant Muslims 
on charges of fundamentalism, shows what kind of democracy the 
United States supports. 
  The allocation of $5.225 billion, or in other words, 
one-fourth of U.S. foreign aid, to Middle East peace reveals how 
important the success of the current talks on solving the Middle 
East crisis is for Washington and the White House rulers. Until 
now, the Zionist regime has successfully played its role of 
middleman between the West and part of the Third World and has 
been able to increase the dependence of these countries on the 
West. Extensive U.S. investment in making the so-called Middle 
East peace process successful will decrease the regional 
differences that Israel and the United States are facing and 
will pave the way for the infiltration of the Zionist regime in 
the Arab and Islamic world. 
  Even though U.S. plans for extending financial aid are based 
on political realities and the extent of cooperation among 
governments, there are other variants that upset these plans. 
When the Camp David compromise deal was signed, various 
agreements in the field of political and economic cooperation 
and especially in the field of tourism, industry, and 
agriculture were signed. However, the steely determination of 
the Egyptian people prevented the implementation of most of 
these agreements. Now the Zionist regime's industrial and 
agricultural cooperation with Egypt, as well as tourist 
exchanges between the two countries, are at the zero level. 
This reality shows how effective the people are in the outcome 
of decisions.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 16, IRNA--Foreign ministers of Iran and 
Georgia held their first round of talks here Tuesday [15 
February] evening and discussed Tehran-Tbilisi ties, key 
regional issues and the current crisis in Caucasus. 
  Georgian Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze, heading a ranking 
delegation, arrived here earlier Tuesday. 
  Chikvaidze briefed his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati on the latest political and economic developments in 
his country as well as Tbilisi ties with its neighbors. 
  The Georgian official considered as "indispensable" the 
settlement of conflicts in Caucasus with the aim to establish 
peace and stability in the region. 
  He said Tehran-Tbilisi ties are at a "very high level." He 
also underlined the need to exchange ranking delegations between 
the two countries with the aim to perpatuate mutual consultation 
and exchange of views. 
  Terming as "important" the recent visit by Georgian 
President 
Eduard Shevardnadze to Iran and the agreements reached between 
the two countries during the visit, Chikvaidze said the ground 
is prepared for upgrading bilateral cooperation. 
  He also thanked Iran for the humanitarian aid the Islamic 
republic sent to his country at one of the most crucial 
junctures. 
  In response, Velayati expressed hope that the outcome of the 
talks between the two countries would be "constructive" and 
"fruitful". 
  Voicing concern over continuation of the existing crisis in 
Caucasus, he referred to the complexity and sensitiveness of the 
situation in the area and underlined the need for restoration of 
an honorable and just peace and tranquility while taking into 
account the rights and views of all the interested parties. 
  The Iranian minister also referred to the political, 
geographical and ethnical structure of the region and said that 
cooperation among all the neighboring countries is the most 
important factor for the establishment of a political balance in 
the region. 
  The two also discussed Iran-Georgia economic cooperation and 
underscored the need for expanded cooperation in all domains. 
  Velayati called for further activation of the joint 
commission and exchange of delegations in agriculture and 
transportation fields.

  [Text] The Georgian foreign minister arrived in Tehran 
yesterday at the head of a political-economic committee and was 
welcomed by our Foreign Minister Dr. Velayati. The objective 
behind this visit is said to be the expansion and consolidation 
of Iranian-Georgian relations and cooperation in all fields. In 
the talks that were held between the officials of Tehran and 
Tbilisi, the expansion of the two countries' relations, 
important regional problems, the current crises in the Caucasus, 
and other topics were discussed. 
  Iranian-Georgian relations are rooted in the two countries' 
history. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, historic 
and cultural ties have linked these two countries more than ever 
before. 
  From the political aspect, the Islamic Republic of Iran 
supports a peaceful solution of the problems in the Caucasus. 
Tehran has always stated its readiness to mediate between the 
conflicting sides in the various areas of the Caucasus. From 
Tehran's point of view, the continuation of diplomatic efforts 
between the conflicting sides and the neighboring countries 
which are playing the role of mediators is necessary in order to 
end the crises in the Caucasus, especially when the region's 
political, geographic, and ethnic fabric makes cooperation among 
neighboring countries for the creation of a political balance 
necessary. 
  On the level of economic and cultural relations, eight 
agreements in various fields were signed during past visits by 
the two countries' officials, and the recent visit by the 
Georgian foreign minister to our country is actually a 
continuation of earlier bilateral talks and the implementation 
of agreements that have been reached. 
  Currently, Iran and Georgia have started extensive 
cooperation in the field of light industries, machine-building, 
and mine and metal- ore explorations. Moreover, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has extended humanitarian assistance to Georgia 
at the most sensitive junctures, and this shows the extent of 
the affection that the Iranian nation and government feel toward 
the Georgian people. 
  Cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Georgia 
as well as among other countries in the Caucasus will be better 
implemented when regional conflicts are solved and when 
tranquility and stability are reestablished. Moreover, the two 
countries' joint commissions as well as the joint commissions of 
other regional countries should become more active, and 
delegations in various fields be exchanged among the countries. 
  At any rate, with the opening of the Georgian Embassy in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and with the upcoming visit of our 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to Tbilisi, fundamental changes are 
expected in the two countries' relations and the way is expected 
to be further paved for expanded relations between the two 
countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Safa Ha'iri: "Nation of Iran Party Leader Urges </F>
Clergy To Abandon Power"] 
  [Excerpts] Paris--Iran yesterday celebrated the 15th 
anniversary of the Islamic revolution amid calls by its leaders 
for mobilization against "foreign aggression" and the "economic 
blockade" imposed on the country. Meanwhile, a prominent 
Iranian opposition leader has revealed that "new forces and a 
popular movement in the country are prepared to surge forward to 
end the repressive dictatorship and replace it with a democratic 
regime capable of saving Iran from catastrophe." 
  Tens of thousands of people poured onto Tehran's streets in 
the direction of the great Freedom Square carrying placards 
proclaiming "No Settlement With Enemies of Revolution," and 
shouting such slogans as "Death to America" and "Death to 
Israel." [passage omitted] 
  In an exclusive interview with AL-HAYAH from Tehran, Daryush 
Foruhar (65 years old), leader of the Nation of Iran Party (the 
oldest secular organization in the country), painted a gloomy 
picture of the economic, political, and social situation. He 
urged the clergy ruling Iran to "to vacate the place quietly and 
let a democratic popular regime take over power and rescue the 
country from the abyss it has been in since those who were 
hungry for power wrested that power, isolated the country, and 
cast it into the darkest reigns." 
  Foruhar accused the regime of deviating "from the 
revolution's noble objectives" of turning Iran into a strong, 
prosperous, and developing country taking its special place in 
the world. He said that the dictatorial rulers "who have 
savagely crushed the people's rights to happiness, civil 
liberties, democracy for the parties and the press, and freedom 
of publication and expression, have isolated themselves from the 
people. History will show that a repressive regime rejected by 
the people cannot survive." 
  Contrary to the claim by Hashemi-Rafsanjani and other 
Iranian 
leaders that Iran has made "unparalleled progress in all 
fields," Foruhar described the situation as "catastrophic." He 
spoke of "massive unemployment, shortages in almost everything 
including such fields as health, medicine, and education, 
corruption, bureacracy, high prices, and an increasing gap 
between the poor and the new rich, while the authorities turn a 
deaf ear to the people's grievances." He underscored the "social 
disturbances and the destruction of industry and agriculture." 
[passage omitted] 
  Foruhar refused to comment on the alleged assassination 
attempt [on Hashemi-Rafsanjani], but he warned against "the 
dangerous game" played by the regime in pitting the Sunnis 
against the Shiites, as was recently the case in Zahedan, which 
witnessed bloody clashes at the beginning of this month between 
the town's population (mostly Sunnis) and the security forces.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Changes in Some Key Posts in the </F>
Clerics' Regime"] 
  [Text] Following differences and prolonged rivalry between 
the supporters and opponents of clerical President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani in the Islamic Majles, and after numerous 
attacks on the director general of the regime's radio and 
television who is also brother of the president, Mohammad 
Hashemi has been forced to resign from his post. Culture and 
Islamic Guidance Minister 'Ali Larijani has been appointed to 
replace him. 
  It has been decided to appoint Mohammad Hashemi as the UN 
envoy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in place of Kamal 
Kharrazi, while the latter is to assume office as the Culture 
and Islamic Guidance minister. Mohammad Hashemi has been the 
head of the largest propaganda apparatus of the regime, the 
radio and television, for the past 12 years. During the past two 
years, he has been subjected to the taunts of those in the 
regime who have been displeased with Hashemi-Rafsanjani's 
policies. They have objected that the radio and television has 
exceeded the boundaries specified by the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and their activities have not conformed to Islamic criteria. 
  Until now, the radio and television apparatus has been 
accused of seeking to propagate a non-Islamic culture and to 
induct non-Islamic personnel. In reaction to the criticism of 
the radio and television by the Majles deputies and individuals 
affiliated with what is known as the hardline faction, the 
Majles set up a special panel. The results of this panel's 
investigations mostly affirmed the views of the critics and 
those who were displeased with the radio's and television's 
performance. 
  The ruling faction in the clerics' regime did not wish to 
magnify this issue and, to give the impression that it takes 
notice of the criticism of opponents, finally removed Mohammad 
Hashemi from this post. At the same time, to maintain his 
official status and to prove that the government had not been 
influenced by the views and beliefs of Hashemi-Rafsanjani's 
critics, he was appointed the regime's UN representative. 
  In view of the fact that these critics had also intensified 
their objections against the former culture and Islamic guidance 
minister and had forced him to resign and that recently they did 
not have much to say about 'Ali Larijani, the Minister for 
Islamic Guidance and Culture who has taken Mohammad Hashemi's 
place, it indicates that the stronger faction inside the regime 
has taken into account the views of the people known as the 
hardline faction and has sought their approval. 
  It is likely that the appointment of Mohammad Hashemi, the 
brother of President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, as the 
regime's ambassador to the United Nations may be designed to 
divert Western opinion about the president. The appointment of 
Mohammad Hashemi to the United Nations gives the impression that 
certain developments have taken place showing flexibility and 
leniency toward the West. 
  The main question about this reshuffle of the regime's pawns 
is: Will the internal critics of the regime be pleased with the 
actions of Kamal Kharrazi, who is being considered for Islamic 
Guidance minister? In general, regardless of whether they 
conform to public interest, these changes seem to be aimed at 
placating the opponents and supporters of Hashemi-Rafsanjani and 
eliciting their concurrence in the form of a deal between the 
two sides, while the hardline faction considers it a kind of 
victory.

  [Text] Prime Minister Rabin yesterday disclosed that there 
have been U.S. efforts to ease tensions in southern Lebanon. 
But the premier said Israel reserves the right to protect her 
interests. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] There were American talks with the 
Syrians, with the Lebanese, and with the Israelis. I will not 
elaborate what were in this talks. Israel has explained its 
position: We will continue to act in accordance to our 
decisions what is good, what is needed to achieve peace to the 
Galilee and security to our forces and to the SLA [South 
Lebanese Army] forces in the security zone. I am fully aware 
that Syria could restrain Hizballah, but Syria did it for 10 
days before the Geneva summit meeting between Presidents Clinton 
and al-Asad. Since then we see escalation in the activities by 
Hizballah against our forces in the security zone. [end

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told the Knesset 
plenum that Israel did not forfeit its right to supervise the 
Palestinians' efforts to encourage illegal immigration in the 
territories. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that Peres 
was responding to queries by several Knesset members claiming 
that the arrangements on the border crossings would allow the 
Palestinians to carry out the right of return. Peres said that 
if the Palestinian leadership violates the agreements Israel 
will implement sanctions, including summarily preventing 
Palestinian entrance by resorting to the right of veto Israel 
was given in the agreement. 
  The foreign minister said that last year approximately 
300,000 Palestinians entered the territories for summer visits. 
He admitted that supervision of their exit at the end of their 
visits is not perfect.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe yesterday held political meetings with Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, President 
'Ezer Weizman, and Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu. In his 
meetings with the Israeli leaders, Juppe expressed France's 
intention to strengthen bilateral relations and also discussed 
the peace process. [passage omitted] 
  Juppe stressed in his meeting with Rabin the tightening of 
defense ties between the two countries. He said that the visit 
by French Defense Minister Francois Leotard next month "would 
spur cooperation in the fields of research, development, and 
technology. There are many contingency plans, and the time has 
come to look to air them out, and begin to consider their 
implementation." Prior to Leotard's visit, the director of 
France's defense procurement agency (DGA) will arrive in Israel. 
  Peres, who fathered the defense ties with France when they 
peaked in the '50's, welcomed France's intention to renew the 
security dialogue "which was severed for many years." Juppe 
also expressed support for setting up a political-strategic 
dialogue in joint Foreign Ministry working groups. [passage 
omitted] 
  Peres told his guest that Israel will not compromise in the 
talks with the Palestinians on issues linked to the security of 
its citizens, and that the latest terrorist acts only sharpen 
the need to be more careful about the security aspects of the 
agreement. Referring to the Syrian track, Peres said that he 
returned less optimistic from his trip to the United States. 
"It is our feeling that the Syrian president did not hand down 
new guidelines to the head of his delegation to the Washington 
talks," Peres said. 
  Juppe agreed with Peres that the Syrians need to make more 
progress in the negotiations. He said that France's message to 
his Arab interlocutors is clear: encourage progress in the 
negotiations. "France is leading the efforts to expand economic 
aid to the territories and the entire region," Juppe said, and 
stressed that his country attaches a great deal of importance to 
the multilateral track and will continue to play a leading role 
there. Peres expressed satisfaction with the French 
contribution to the multilaterals and said that the private 
sector must be encouraged to join the inter-government activity. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 15 February in a page 2 report 
by Moti Bassok, Dan Avidan, and Mikhal Sela' adds that "Juppe 
yesterday noted that France expanded its financial aid to the 
Palestinians. The scope of the permanent aid via the EC is 20 
percent of the EC's total aid to the Palestinians. In addition, 
France helps public institutions and volunteer organizations. 
Last year total direct French aid to the Palestinians reached 
12 million francs, or $ 2.5 million. France last year also 
handed out 18 million francs to the UN Relief and Works Agency.]

  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe met today with 
Palestinian representatives at Orient House in East Jerusalem. 
Following the meeting, Juppe told reporters that France would 
continue to support the peace process. In particular, the 
foreign minister said, France would contribute funds to the 
Palestinians, in addition to the 500 million ECU's already 
pledged by the European Committee. 
  [Begin recording] [Juppe] Yes, we have decided to implement 
a new protocol of 60 million francs in 1994 for the occupied 
territories. [end recording] 
  Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni, who attended the 
meeting, told reporters he believed the recent spate of terror 
attacks could be better handled if the Palestinians controlled 
the areas. Al-Husayni agreed that support among Palestinians 
for the peace process had dwindled, but was convinced that 
things could change. 
  [Al-Husayni] There is less support because nothing is 
implemented on the ground. In the moment that there will be 
implementation on the ground, I believe that the Palestinian 
people will support. The Palestinian people stopped to believe 
words and sentences; they would like to see something on the 
ground. [end recording]

  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has met with an 
East Jerusalem delegation led by Faysal al-Husayni. Talks dealt 
with the French aid to Palestinians during the forthcoming 
self-rule period. Our correspondent Ahmad 'Ubaydat reports on 
this meeting: 
  [Begin recording] ['Ubaydat] The French Government is 
committed to supporting the peace process and helping the 
Palestinians in all domains in order to successfully establish 
their self-rule. This was stated by French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe during his meeting with some Palestinian figures at 
the Palestinian delegation's headquarters today. Juppe said: 
Today's meeting was cordial and positive. As you know, the 
French Government has for long been calling for and supporting 
the idea of direct dialogue between Israel and the PLO. This 
has actually been achieved following the signing of the 
principles agreement and the mutual recognition. The minister 
also discussed France's efforts in this regard, particularly its 
contribution to economic development in the territories. 
  Faysal al-Husayni voiced optimism over this meeting. He 
said: 
  [Al-Husayni] In fact, the meeting was very positive. They 
talked about their clear political position on the peace process 
as a whole and on the issue of Jerusalem. They also expressed 
their readiness to develop the aid extended to us, whether it is 
financial aid or training assistance. 
  ['Ubaydat] The French foreign minister left for the Gaza 
Strip to acquaint himself with the situation there. He will 
then return to Jerusalem. [end recording]

  [Text] Alain Juppe today ended his tour in the Middle East. 
Juppe toured the Gaza Strip under a very hot sun today. He 
visited Palestinian camps where living conditions shocked him. 
  [Begin Juppe recording] When one walks through these camps, 
such as the Shati camp, when one sees this school, one realises 
how much should be done. The living conditions in these camps 
are not as required by human dignity. We should change them if 
we want the population to believe in the peace process now under 
way. There is some kind of race against time at the moment. 
France has for so many years been present and helping in the 
occupied territories. We have decided in 1994 to intensify this 
aid. However, the mobilization of the entire international 
community is needed. 
  I hope that what was announced in Washington a few months 
ago 
will be implemented in the field. I have repeatedly stated 
France's message regarding the right of the Palestinians to 
their land and self-determination, as well as dialogue. We 
should help all those who are involved in this peace process and 
believe in it. From my talks here I have gathered that things 
will of course be difficult, but there is no other way. This 
[peace process] is irreversible and we have to go forward. [end

  [Text] Alain Juppe spoke about peace at the end of his 
three-day visit to Israel. The French foreign minister would 
like the Israeli Government and the PLO to keep to the schedule 
of the agreement signed in Washington on 13 September of last 
year. Otherwise, Juppe said, the supporters of war may have the 
last word: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] A failure would be a tragedy; 
everyone agrees about that. Everything must be done in order to 
have every chance of succeeding. I have already said that time 
does not work for those who want peace; it works for those 
against it. We believe that the announced schedule must be kept 
to as much as possible. I hope that a global agreement on 
Palestinian autonomy and its implementation will be reached in 
the near future. 
  I believe that the global atmosphere must be changed, that 
measures of detente and trust must be developed. This is why, 
when I went to Gaza, I advocated the freezing of settlements in 
the occupied territories, as well as the imminent release and 
rehabilitation of prisoners. I would like to add, however, that 
I also understand Israel's concern after the historic leap that 
was made last September. I understand the concern of the people 
for their security. [end recording] 
  That was Alain Juppe speaking in Jerusalem last night during 
his news conference recorded by Pierre Weill.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mordekhay Drori, Israeli ambassador to the </F>
European Communities, by Olivier Gosset; place and date not 
given: "Mideast: Development Must Go Hand in Hand With Peace 
Process" -- first two paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] A few days after the agreement on security signed 
last Wednesday [9 February] in Cairo by PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat 
and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, Israelis and 
Palestinians started a new session of negotiations in Taba 
(Sinai) yesterday to draw up a comprehensive agreement on the 
methods of implementing autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. These 
preliminary talks relate to the composition of the Palestinian 
police force which will be deployed in the area following the 
Israeli withdrawal. Other discussions relating in particular to 
the transfer of civilian powers and the release of the 
Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons (almost 9,000 according 
to the PLO, more according to the United Nations), are also due 
to start shortly. 
  Mordekhay Drori, ambassador at the Israeli Mission to the 
European Communities, assesses the development of the peace 
process in the region. While the impetus of reconciliation does 
not seem to be waning between the Palestinians and Israelis, he 
reaffirmed the enormity of the task still to be accomplished. 
  [Gosset] Are you still optimistic about the peace process as 
a whole? 
  [Drori] Optimistic, but also cautious. People underestimate 
the difficulty, especially the practical difficulty, of the 
solutions to be found for the many problems between us and the 
Arab world. Moreover, it is much more complicated with the 
Palestinians than with the Syrians. With the Palestinians, we 
are intertwined with each other, there are no borders. And, in 
addition to that, there are economic problems. 
  With Syria, the problems are less complicated because there 
are borders. But the solution to these problems is extremely 
complicated because we do not really know what the Syrians' real 
intentions are, whether they agree to sign a peace agreement 
with all that that involves: Diplomatic and cultural relations, 
trade. Or whether they just want one agreement without any other 
purpose. When we have the answer to this very complex question, 
we can move forward. 
  [Gosset] With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad finally had to abandon his dreams of 
strategic parity with Israel. And he probably realized that he 
could be seriously outclassed... 
  [Drori] That did have a decisive influence. It is one of the 
keys to the Near East affair. Whether willingly or unwillingly, 
the Arab countries relied militarily, economically, and 
politically on the Soviet Union. Because of its collapse, they 
no longer have that support. If a new conflict arose, they 
could no longer count on that unconditional aid. This fear has 
virtually abolished the risk of a military attack by the Arab 
countries on Israel. In addition, there is only one superpower 
left in the world -- the United States. The Syrians have clearly 
understood that if they wish to be integrated into the 
international world and develop their economy, they must find a 
means of reconciliation with Washington. And this 
reconciliation depends on the peace agreement with Israel. 
  [Gosset] Many economic development projects have been 
mentioned. Which are those which can really be implemented? 
  [Drori] For a European, it is very difficult to appreciate 
the lack of multiregional infrastructure in the Middle East. 
  For you, it is perfectly natural to take your car and drive 
from Brussels to Paris, or to telephone from one country to 
another, and to watch foreign television channels. All that is 
desperately lacking in the Middle East because the countries in 
the region -- especially Israel -- have been cut off from each 
other. I therefore do not see any regional development and 
development among countries unless there are regional activities. 
  Several fundamental projects ought to remain: Road and 
railroad communications, telecommunications, joint projects in 
the energy sphere. One problem has a very marked political 
character, and that is water: Because there is an overall 
shortage, and a fair distribution of this resource in the region 
is needed. 
  It is clear that all this can only develop if there is an 
agreement in the region. But we must not expect the peace 
agreement to be signed in order to make preparations. We must 
start now. 
  [Gosset] Following the peace agreement between Egypt and 
Israel in 1979, did this kind of development take place 
subsequently, even on a limited scale? 
  [Drori] No, unfortunately not, aside from a few exceptions. 
We bought and still buy Egyptian oil. But that did not go 
further, mainly for political reasons: Egypt being the only 
Arab country to have signed a peace agreement with Israel, there 
were reservations about giving too obvious a character to that 
agreement. Also, it was not possible to launch a real regional 
project if the other countries stayed away. 
  [Gosset] What is the impact of the economic boycott by Arab 
countries on the Israeli economy? 
  [Drori] There are no figures and I think that those who give 
figures are mistaken (the figure of $3 million has sometimes 
been mentioned -- L'ECHO editor's note), because it is 
impossible to cost deals which have never been made for fear of 
the boycott. 
  Let us not talk about the "primary" boycott, in other words 
the boycott between Israel and the Arab countries. The main 
problem is the "secondary" boycott, in other words all the 
entrepreneurs and all the companies which have been threatened 
with not being able to do business if they did business with 
Israel. In view of the size of the Arab countries, the choice 
has mainly been made in favor of the Arab countries. Examining 
the present trend, I think that this kind of boycott is being 
weakened. It has not stopped but should vanish if there is a 
general agreement. 
  [Gosset] How does Israel manage to handle the arrival of new 
immigrants? 
  [Drori] An immigrant who arrives in Israel receives housing 
from the government. Or he is helped to pay his rent for one or 
two years. He receives an allowance during the period in which 
he is looking for work. It is a huge burden, but we are used to 
it because we have always faced immigration and the country is 
organized accordingly. 
  Around 500,000 people have arrived and several hundred 
thousand more are expected. In the long term, it is an 
extraordinary source of wealth, because many of them are highly 
qualified: Engineers, doctors... Professions which require 
years of training. In the short term, when you see, for 
instance, 5,000 doctors arriving, which will double the number 
of practitioners in the country, there has to be retraining -- 
which is sometimes tragic in the personal sphere, but necessary 
at national level -- and work has to be created for others. 
This all requires an enormous amount of work, which has borne 
fruit because unemployment resulting from immigration has fallen.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" Program] </F>
  [Text] The Congolese authorities' plans to restore security 
in the capital after months of bloody communal clashes have hit 
another obstacle, and it is all because of an Israeli 
connection. The Knesset is due to debate the sending of dozens 
of Israeli soldiers to Congo on the invitation of President 
Lissouba's government but the idea has not gone down too well 
particularly because it is being put together by a private 
company. From Jerusalem, John David reports: 
  [Begin recording] [David] Leftwing Israeli politicians were 
alerted to the affair when parents complained that their sons 
were being sent to Africa to a conflict they knew nothing about. 
A private Israeli company, Levdan, has been recruiting some 60 
former Israeli servicemen to go to Congo. Their leader is said 
to be a retired brigadier general who was commander of the 
Israeli forces in Southern Lebanon. 
  Twenty-five Israelis are already said to be in Congo with a 
further 40 due to join them later this week. Some Israeli 
weaponry may be included in the deal as well. When politicians 
investigated the matter they were assured that Levdan had been 
given all the correct permits by the Israeli Foreign and Defense 
Ministries. The permits are apparently only given if Israelis 
are working for the host government and won't be directly 
involved in combat. 
  Naomi Hazan of the leftist center Meretz Party, which is in 
the ruling coalition, is not happy with the way the matter is 
being handled. Ms. Hazan said Israel should not become 
embroiled in the domestic affairs of other states, especially on 
the side of potentially unstable governments. If Israel wants 
to undertake military cooperation, she said, it should be done 
formally and not through a private company. Ms. Hazan believes 
that the permits were issued through what she described as the 
old boy network with the main incentives being economics. 
  Other politicians belonging to the Meretz Party have 
objected 
that Israeli foreign policy should be driven by financial 
instead of political objectives. Even the critics are avoiding 
branding the former Israeli servicemen mercenaries. They seem 
to have accepted the government's assurances that they won't be 
involved in combat. Israel is particularly sensitive to 
accusations that it is supporting mercenaries. In the 1980's, 
so-called Israeli security companies were accused of supplying 
mercenaries to help train Colombian death squads on behalf of 
drug dealers. [end recording]

  [Text] Israel agrees in principle to join the UN's 
peacekeeping forces. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz 
reports this has been decided in a session chaired by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Beilin on a UN request that Israel send a 
Medical Corp unit to Angola. Later this week Deputy Minister 
Beilin will meet UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali for 
discussing the location to which the IDF's [Israel Defense 
Forces] representatives are to be sent. The place will be one of 
the conflict ridden areas in Africa. Our correspondent notes 
that Israel prefers to send soldiers to areas in which it has 
strategic interests, such as the Horn of Africa.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, Feb 15 (AFP) -- 
Israeli troops shot dead a 17-year-old Palestinian on Tuesday 
[15 February] and wounded four more in a series of clashes on 
the Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources said. 
  Ihab Tawfiq Barakat was hit by a bullet in the head during a 
demonstration in Rafah which followed Monday's death in the 
border town of a wanted member of the Red Eagles, the armed wing 
of George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 
  Another Palestinian was wounded in the shooting as troops 
riposted to stone-throwing and injured two Palestinians in the 
Dayr al-Balah refugee camp and another in Gaza City. 
  The latest death brought to 1,177 the number of Palestinians 
killed by Israeli bullets since the intifada or uprising began 
in December 1987, according to an AFP toll. 
  Meanwhile, a young Palestinian from Gaza wounded a 
Russian-Israeli immigrant with an axe at Ashdod on Tuesday 
morning, police said. 
  On the West Bank, the army closed a mosque near Ramallah 
saying it had been a propaganda centre for 'Izz-al-din 
al-Qassam, the armed wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement 
(Hamas). 
  'Izz-al-din announced Tuesday that it was carrying out a 
"Ramadan plan" for the Moslem fasting month to avenge the 
killing of Palestinian militants by Israeli soldiers. 
  "Vengeance will be taken anywhere. The blood of our 
militants will not flow unpunished and the Ramadan plan has 
begun," the armed wing said in a statement sent to AFP. 
  Hamas claimed responsibility for murdering an Israeli secret 
service agent and wounding two more near Ramallah on Sunday. A 
Palestinian double agent, who had collaborated with the 
authorities, led the Israelis into a trap, military officials 
said.

uniforms, head coverings, and instigative material were found. 
The order was approved after it was learned that the mosque 
served as a Hamas base. 
  Students from two Bethlehem schools stoned IDF [Israel

students hurled the stones because they failed in their 
matriculation examinations. 
  Police Commissioner Rafi Peled said that the police plan to 
increase supervision of residents from the territories crossing

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Peace talks will resume in Washington 
today amid growing Israeli skepticism and feverish maneuvers 
designed to circumvent the basis of a just and comprehensive 
solution in the region. Shim'on Peres has openly announced his 
conviction that these talks are useless. 
  Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin has stressed the 
need 
to initiate collateral negotiations and to hold a referendum on 
the Golan. He has urged Syria to convince the Israelis of its 
desire for peace. An observer following Middle East events will 
find nothing surprising in Rabin's call. It is an Israeli habit 
to falsify facts and distort events. 
  Anyone who listens to Rabin will come away with the 
impression that Syria is the aggressor and that Israel is a 
patient and peaceful lamb subject to repeated attack. 
Naturally, Rabin ignores the fact of Israel's attacks on Arab 
countries after 1948, and the fact that the Golan is Syrian 
territory occupied by Israel in 1967 after the UN Security 
Council's cease-fire resolution. Rabin ignores the woes, 
disasters, and catastrophes that befell the Palestinian people 
at the hands of Israeli forces and as a result of expansionist 
settlement schemes. Rabin ignores the incessant Israeli attacks 
on Lebanon. 
  Everything has been distorted. The sinful executioner has 
been converted into a victim, while the victim is presented with 
demands to prove its peaceful intentions. 
  Experience unquestionably demonstrates that secret 
negotiations are just an Israeli technique designed for 
blackmail. It has always been a futile policy. The Palestinian 
side, which held secret collateral negotiations with the 
Israelis in Oslo, has gathered only bitter fruit and 
disappointment. This side was dragged into positions that are 
outside international legitimacy and its resolutions; the 
outcome is an agreement that gives Israel a free hand in all 
basic Palestinian affairs, while it gives trifles to the the 
Palestinians. 
  Despite lengthy and complex negotiations in several 
international capitals and cities in order to interpret this 
agreement, the results are even worse than many people expected. 
Israeli officials did not hide their satisfaction with the 
substantive concessions they have obtained from the 
Palestinians. Some Israeli officials even expressed sadness 
over the state of affairs on the Palestinian side. Naturally, 
this would not have happened if the Palestinian side was 
committed to the constants of the meetings held in Damascus, 
Beirut, and Amman, and if it had not stopped the coordination 
with the Arab brethren. 
  Now that the Israeli rulers have gained a lot from the 
Palestinian side's violation of the Arab consensus, these rulers 
want to play the same game with other Arab parties. They are 
urging them to hold secret negotiations on the pretext that it 
will speed up the peace process. 
  The Washington talks are the most appropriate framework for 
promoting the peace process -- if Israel really wants peace and 
looks forward to a just and comprehensive solution to the 
vehement conflict in the region. Israel, however, has no 
intention of withdrawing from occupied Arab territories or of 
ending the policy of continued settlement building. Israel has 
mired the Washington talks in futile arguments and problems, 
avoiding the substance of the peace process. 
  In more than two years, no Arab side has received any answer 
to the question of whether or not Israel intends to implement 
Security Council resolutions and withdraw from occupied Arab 
territories. Instead of translating the land-for-peace principle 
into a tangible reality, Israel has raised dozens of security 
problems in order to conceal its expansionist ambitions. Today, 
Israel demands that the talks be shunted off their track and 
away from their framework, as it has done with the Palestinian 
side, and that secret negotiations be held at higher levels. 
This is intended to ignore the Security Council resolutions 
that structure the peace process, dragging the Arab sides into 
positions where they will lose the cover of international 
legitimacy. 
  The following questions should be posed to the Israeli 
rulers: Why should secret talks bear fruit? Why can't the 
Washington talks reach a breakthrough, since we know these talks 
are held away from media clamor? Why does Israel refuse to 
announce at the Washington talks what it can announce in secret 
talks? Or, is it indeed a matter of fostering delusions among 
Arab parties --delusions which, in the secret talks, will turn 
into time bombs? 
  Peace cannot be established in vestibules and cellars. It 
can only be established by serious and objective negotiations 
under the banner of international legitimacy. 
  If Israel is really serious about achieving peace, the 
Washington talks are the most appropriate framework, especially 
because they are held under U.S. and Russian sponsorship, close 
to the United Nations. These talks will definitely bear fruit 
and achieve remarkable progress if Israel commits itself to 
withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon. 
  Instead of casting doubts and creating confusion, it would 
be 
better for the Israeli rulers to comply with the principles of 
the Madrid conference. By so doing, these rulers will see that 
peace is at hand.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN addresses the resumption of 
the bilateral talks in Washington yesterday amidst unencouraging 
Israeli developments. This shows, the paper says, that Israel 
wants these talks to continue to revolve in a vicious circle and 
to remain monotonous and futile. 
  TISHRIN also notes the encouraging U.S. position. It says 
the United States has renewed its full commitment to just and 
comprehensive peace, and underscored Syria's leading role in the 
peace process. 
  TISHRIN adds: It is interesting that U.S. news reports have 
spoken of a new tour of the region in early March by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. This means that the 
United States will be awaiting the outcome of the second round 
of talks held at the chief delegates' level in Washington. Once 
this round is concluded, Secretary of State Christopher will 
make moves within the context of a regional tour. 
  TISHRIN goes on to say: Israel has not thus far shown any 
concern over possible regional developments if the second round 
of the Washington chief delegates' talks fail and the peace 
process reaches a dead end. Israel alone has continued to 
oppose compliance with international legitimacy resolutions. 
That is why it is making strenuous attempts to render the U.S. 
role void of any meaningful content. As a matter of fact, 
Israel is casting doubts on the usefulness of this role. 
  TISHRIN says: Israeli skepticism over the possible 
achievement of progress in the Washington bilateral talks is 
part of the Israeli procrastination and prevarication policy. 
It aims to frustrate all peace efforts. This has been 
corroborated by Israel's decision to ignore the outcome of the 
Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton, and its 
disregard for all peace efforts. 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: The peace process could be 
redeemed if the United States plays a constructive and positive 
role as a full partner and an honest broker. This is necessary 
to make Israel meet the requirements of just and comprehensive 
peace. 
  The newspaper AL-BA'TH comments on the impossible conditions 
Rabin has raised anew, saying: The articulation of these 
conditions coincides with the resumption of the Washington 
bilateral talks. These conditions are designed to circumvent the 
true requirements of peace. Rabin resorts to these tunes 
whenever he experiences an increasing isolation with regard to 
peace efforts. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Since the convocation of the Madrid 
conference, Israel has continued to speak about the kind of 
peace we are offering, not because it is unaware of that, but 
because it deliberately seeks to circumvent the peace process 
unleashed by the Madrid conference, and promoted by the Geneva 
summit, which produced remarkable results. Israel alone does 
not want to acknowledge many facts pertaining to peace efforts, 
primarily those related to the need to achieve just and 
comprehensive peace. One of these facts concerns the need for 
the Zionist occupation troops to withdraw from all occupied Arab 
territories, as provided for in the U.S. peace initiative and 
the relevant international resolutions. 
  AL-BA'TH goes on to say: Rabin's renewed refusal to address 
the question of withdrawal from the Golan or southern Lebanon 
before he knows the kind of peace advocated by Syria is a 
flagrant attempt at circumvention. There is no alternative to 
rehabilitating the Madrid conference formula and the Geneva 
summit outcome, which provided a definition of peace that is 
acceptable not only to Syria, but also to the entire world 
community, which is supposed to accord due respect to 
international legitimacy resolutions. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Rabin, who must have been 
familiar with the U.S. peace initiative and the outcome of the 
Geneva summit, is well aware that the achievement of just and 
comprehensive peace in the region is contingent upon compliance 
with the provisions enshrined in this initiative, and also with 
the consensus of the entire world community. Consequently, 
attempts to evade the requirements of peace will not last long. 
  In a commentary today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The 
statements made by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on the 
eve of the resumption of the Washington bilateral talks on the 
chief delegates' level, in which he reiterated Israel's refusal 
to withdraw to the pre-1967 borders, are not designed for 
domestic consumption. As a matter of fact, these statements 
enjoy the support of Zionist parties of all colors and hues. 
They reflect a desire to consecrate occupation and promote the 
Israeli scheme and strategy, which are grounded in aggression 
and expansion. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Rabin's statements do not only reflect 
political oneupmanship. These statements, coupled with the 
Israeli conduct in the ongoing peace talks, show that Israel 
only seeks to consecrate the occupation, build biblical Israel, 
and subjugate the Arab region. Since the convocation of the 
Madrid conference, Israeli politicians and generals have been 
lending half-hearted support for the peace process. They are 
not sincere in their handling of the international and U.S. 
efforts to achieve peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The world has continued to feel a 
deliberate Israeli determination to scuttle the peace process 
and overlook the relevant international legitimacy resolutions. 
Israel is making feverish attempts to circumvent these 
resolutions, undermine them, and give them interpretations that 
would enable the aggressors to retain the gains of aggression 
and occupation. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH wonders: Given all 
these international resolutions, which are the terms of 
reference of the peace process, this Israeli determination to 
defy the international community's wishes, and these constant 
Israeli human rights abuses, should the international community 
not act to render Israel accountable to the this community, 
particularly since less dangerous situations have resulted in 
the punishment of entire peoples and nations?

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwan: "Syria Not Optimistic, Accuses </F>
Israel of Confusing Issues"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus -- On the eve of the resumption of the 
Washington talks, which begin today among leaders of the Arab 
delegations and Israel in the framework of the Middle East peace 
process, Israel continues to adopt fluctuating and unfixed 
positions vis-a-vis the foundations of the peace process and the 
achievement of progress on the tracks involving it and the Arab 
parties. In fact it preempted the negotiations by casting doubt 
on their results, describing them as futile. 
  Syria yesterday expressed a kind of pessimism about the 
possibility of achieving any progress. A Syrian official has 
told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Israel continues to confuse the 
issues as a result of its position rejecting peace and the 
separation policy it is pursuing, which has resulted in the Oslo 
and Cairo agreements with the PLO. Through this policy it is 
seeking to infiltrate Arab ranks. The official pointed out that 
Israel's request to raise the level of representation in the 
negotiations on the Syrian track centers on its reliance on the 
concessions offered to it by the Palestinian side, since this 
request came immediately after the Cairo agreement. He said: 
No matter how many agreements of that kind are concluded, they 
cannot lead to a solution in the Middle East, especially as the 
U.S. Administration and the world are committed to the 
foundations of the peace process and a comprehensive and just 
peace is an international demand just as it is an Arab and 
regional demand. 
  The Syrian official described the new Washington round of 
negotiations as sensitive and delicate. He said they are bound 
to reveal the new Israeli orientation, even though nothing has 
yet been issued by Israel to indicate that it is offering 
something new through its delegation to Washington. 
  The official said that Syria continues to receive from 
Washington assurances about the U.S. commitment to the 
foundations of the peace process. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kuwait City, Feb 16 (AFP) -- Kuwait is ready to cut 
oil production as part of a collective agreement to prop up 
sagging prices, Oil Minister 'Ali al-Baghli said Wednesday [16 
February]. 
  Al-Baghli also confirmed that oil ministers of the 
six-nation 
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) would meet in the Saudi port of 
Jeddah next month to discuss prices ahead of OPEC's talks on 
March 25. 
  "Kuwait is ready to lower its oil output if other producers 
commit themselves to reductions," he told AFP in an interview. 
"Kuwait is willing to abide by any agreement or decision at the 
March 25 meeting." 
  The emirate produces two million barrels per day (b/d) under 
a six-month quota agreement by the Organisation of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries. 
  Since the end of the Iraqi occupation of the emirate in 
February 1991, it had previously violated its quota to press the 
12-nation cartel for a higher share. 
  OPEC oil ministers are due to discuss cutting the official 
production ceiling of 24.5 million b/d for the second quarter to 
support prices, which have remained nearly seven dollars below 
its benchmark of 21 dollars. 
  The GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, 
Kuwait, 
and the United Arab Emirates -- have offered to trim production 
if other oil exporters agree to do the same. 
  Omani Oil minister Sa'id Bin-Ahmad al-Shanfari said last 
week 
that most of the countries he had visited to seek their support 
for OPEC were willing to cut production. 
  But he did not specify how much they were ready to cut. 
  During talks in Doha last week, OPEC president 'Abdallah 
Bin-Hamad al-'Atiyah of Qatar and Nigerian Oil Minister Don 
Etiebet proposed a five to 10 percent reduction in the 
organisation's October-March ceiling. 
  Etiebet also had talks with Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazir 
but it was not clear if the kingdom backed the proposed cut. 
  "I am optimistic that oil prices will improve in the next 
stage," Baghli said, declining to elaborate. 
  "Oil prices will be on top of the subjects to be discussed 
by 
the GCC oil ministers in Jeddah," he added. "But so far, there 
is no specific agenda." 
  GCC states produce more than half of OPEC's oil output and 
one fifth of the world's. The price fall has hit them hardest 
as crude accounts for more than 80 percent of their total 
exports.

<F P=106> [Report by Husayn 'Abd-al-Rahman: "Kuwaiti Information </F>
Minister Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: We Are Seeking To Reorganize 
Our Gulf Priorities and Working for Posterity"] 
  [Text] Kuwait -- Kuwaiti Information Minister Shaykh Sa'ud 
Nasir al-Sabah has stressed in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
that he "has never contemplated closing any Kuwaiti newspaper or 
magazine by an Information Ministry decision." He said that 
that "falls under the powers of the court, to which all 
publication issues are referred." 
  Expressing his eagerness not to disturb relations between 
Kuwait and Arab states by publishing reports insulting them, 
Shaykh Sa'ud al-Sabah, who is visiting London today, said: 
"Just as we do not accept the publication of articles or topics 
insulting Kuwait and its people, it is natural for us to 
appreciate the position of the states which are not satisfied 
with what our newspapers are publishing about them." 
  Shaykh Sa'id, who was Kuwait's ambassador to London and 
Washington before his appointment as information minister in the 
current Kuwaiti Government, said that "the Gulf region is 
experiencing critical conditions caused by the Iraqi regime." 
He stressed "the need to reorganize our Gulf priorities and 
seek to unite the Gulf Cooperation Council states, including the 
military strategy." 
  Speaking about Iran's role, the Kuwaiti information minister 
said that Iran is one of the states which should "join us in 
safeguarding Gulf security and stability." 
  Shaykh Sa'ud stressed that "we are thinking about the 
region's conditions now but are working and planning for 
posterity." He emphasized that "Kuwait is ready for all 
possibilities that may arise from a change of conditions in Iraq 
and the downfall of Saddam Husayn's regime."

<F P=106> [Reports by Faysal Makram in Sanaa and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah </F>
in Aden: "Aden: Socialist Party Talks About Foiling Attempt To 
Shoot Down al-Bid's Plane"] 
  [Excerpts] Military sources in Aden have confirmed that 
the city's military intelligence (which is controlled by the 
Yemeni Socialist Party) [YSP] recently "uncovered a plot to 
shoot down the civilian aircraft scheduled to take Presidential 
Council Vice Chairman and YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid and his party's delegation from Aden to Amman in the next 
few days to sign the Pledge and Accord Document." 
  They accused some central security elements attached to the 
northern governorates and working at the Radfan Camp overlooking 
Aden airport of preparing to carry out the mission of attacking 
al-Bid's plane with "shoulder-fired RPG shells" when it takes 
off from the airport. 
  They said that "Brigadier General Salih Munsir al-Suyayli, 
governor of Aden and member of the YSP Political Bureau, ordered 
the expulsion of the northern members of central security from 
Aden to the north and the arrest of those who were planning to 
carry out the attack on al-Bid's aircraft." 
  Furthermore, military sources in Aden say that "the forces 
deployed in al-'Anad camp (80 km north of Aden) arrested two 
Iraqis in the evening of the day before yesterday as they tried 
to infiltrate the camp, which has a military airfield and some 
installations." They added that "The Iraqis, who came from the 
northern governorates, confessed that their mission was to 
damage a number of military aircraft belonging to the army in 
the south and to hijack two planes to Iraq." 
  These developments coincided with the republic decree issued 
by Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih revoking Prime Minister and YSP Political Bureau 
Member Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas's decision the day 
before yesterday appointing Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad governor of the 
southern governorate of Abyan in succession to Colonel Yahya 
al-Ra'i, who was elected member of the House of Representatives. 
[passage omitted] 
  The General Committee (Political Bureau) of the General 
People's Congress [GPC] issued a press statement yesterday 
citing an official source as saying that "At a time when our 
masses and all the sincere people who care about unity and 
democracy were looking forward to 10 Ramadan [20 February] for 
the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document to end the 
country's plight resulting from the political crisis, our people 
were surprised by the report carried on Yemeni television's 
channel two about the divisive decision signed by Prime Minister 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas appointing Brother Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad 
as governor of Abyan, ignoring the constitution and the local 
administration law. That decision runs contrary to the 
principle of the state of law and order and undermines the 
homeland's higher interests." It appealed to all the political 
forces to "condemn that attitude" which it described as being "a 
violation of the Constitution and the law with negative and 
dangerous consequences harmful to the homeland's stability and 
democracy." [passage omitted]

  [Text] At a meeting yesterday in the capital, Sanaa, the 
Political Forces Dialogue Committee concluded its agenda 
regarding preparations for the signing of the accord document 
and guarantees for immediate implementation. 
  In two meetings on Saturday and Sunday [12, 13 February], 
the 
Political Forces Dialogue Committee approved the formation of a 
committee to consider views regarding the necessary security 
guarantees to begin implementation. 
  The Political Forces Dialogue Committee also approved the 
formation of another committee to prepare the necessary 
appendices to the document and draft a statement announcing the 
signing of the document. A third committee will take care of 
protocol arrangements for the signing ceremony, which will be 
held in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on 10 Ramadan, 
corresponding to 20 February, per consultations with the 
brothers in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. 
  The Political Forces Dialogue Committee agreed to meet next 
Thursday to see what these committees will come up with and make 
appropriate decisions. 
  The Political Forces Dialogue Committee has said it will 
continue to be in session, in line with the constitutional, 
legal, and procedural guarantees approved by the committee late 
last week.

  [Text] It appears that differences between the Yemeni 
president and his deputy have not been completely solved. The 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] yesterday issued a statement 
broadcast over Aden radio protesting President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's order to annul Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas' 
decision to appoint a new governor of the southern (?Abyan) 
Governorate. 
  The YSP, which is led by Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
said that al-'Attas' decision does not contravene the 
constitution as long as it aims to prevent corruption in the 
governorate. 
  The Yemeni presidency regarded the decision as a violation 
of 
both the constitution and the law because appointing governors 
must be effected by joint decisions of the president and the 
vice president. 
  It goes without saying that this issue is within the 
differences which seem to be continuing between the northerners 
and southerners, between the president and the vice president, 
or between the two main political parties, the YSP and General 
People's Congress.

  [Text] Sanaa, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT--Yemeni military 
sources have confirmed that a state of mutiny has spread among 
the personnel of the 5th Brigade, which is stationed in the 
'Umran area, north of Sanaa, as a result of a decision to 
replace their commander in a manner incompatible with the 
Defense Ministry's regulations, in the context of the 
complications of the current political crisis in Yemen. 
  The sources said that the brigade's commander, Colonel 
'Abdallah 'Ali Shulayl, had left the camp to finalize some 
matters. In his absence a decision was issued, appointing 
Colonel Taymas as his replacement. It is worth mentioning that 
both officers come from Abyan Governorate (in the south). The 
5th Brigade is also one of the military units belonging to 
former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, whose elements emigrated 
to the north in the wake of the 13 January 1986 incidents. 
  The sources said that Col. 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander 
of 
the 1st tank Division and the Yemeni president's half brother, 
is behind the replacement process, because of his fear of 
possible contacts between the brigade and Socialist Party 
leaders, while northern units (loyal to the General People's 
Congress) see 'Ali Nasir's forces as "friendly units." 
  Observers believe that the decision to replace the 5th 
Brigade's commander is an attempt to foment sedition among the 
sons of Abyan Governorate, to which President 'Ali Nasir belong. 
But it has resulted in nothing except skirmishes between the 
brigade's personnel and the tank battalion belonging to the 1st 
Division, which is stationed in the same camp. As a result, one 
of the brigade's soldiers was wounded. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that a military committee 
comprised of Col. 'Abdallah 'Ali 'Ulaywah, Col. 'Abd-Rabbuh 
Mansur, and Commander Muzahim went to Sanaa to the 5th Brigade's 
command to discuss the issue. They discovered that another 
military delegation had arrived from Aden. An argument took 
place between the "committee" and the "delegation." It ended up 
with an agreement to freeze the situation and keep Col. Sulayl 
in his position, after the brigade's personnel warned against 
replacing their commander "covertly." They stressed that any 
decision in this connection should come from Yemeni Defense 
Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir. 
  Tribal sources in the 'Umran area have said that the people 
of the area sympathize with the 5th Brigade's personnel and 
command, because they are performing their duty in an area 
deprived of services, even though they are exposed to an 
undeclared blockade from the military supply organ. Some people 
describe them as "third-rate military men" -- which has caused 
them to support Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Haytham and consider 
him their leader in the circumstances of the blockade they are 
experiencing. 
  In another development, officials in Sanaa have confirmed 
the 
occurrence of a clash between a group of tribesmen who wanted to 
seize a convoy of [cooking] gas tankers that were heading for 
the capital and the police forces guarding them. Despite the 
intensity of the exchange of fire, the authorities have not 
revealed the number of victims.

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 14 (AFP)--The Yemeni Government is trying 
to win the release of three Chinese technicians who were 
kidnapped while helping to build a road in Yemen's rugged 
northeast, Chinese Embassy officials said here Monday [14 
February]. 
  "We hope they will be freed in the next few days," a Chinese 
diplomat said. "The Yemeni Government is working hard for their 
release." 
  The three were kidnapped Saturday morning while working on a 
road between Hija, 127 kilometers (75 miles) north of Sanaa and 
Ma'rib, 173 kilometers (100 miles) east of the capital, embassy 
officials said. 
  Yemeni sources meanwhile said the Chinese were kidnapped by 
three people wanted by the police for various murders. 
  There were no details on what the kidnappers wanted and 
where 
they were holding the technicians. 
  The three were working under the terms of a Yemen-Chinese 
cooperation accord. In the 1980s China helped the former north 
Yemen build several roads, including one between Sanaa and Hija. 
  The Chinese were kidnapped the same day that Ahnum tribesmen 
in the country's northwest freed three French tourists they had 
held for 20 days in a bid to force the government to build a 
road through their region.

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Three kidnapped Chinese 
engineers are in the hands of wanted murderers who are demanding 
that the authorities drop death sentences against them, a 
Chinese Embassy official said here Tuesday [15 February]. 
  "To free the Chinese, the three Yemeni kidnappers want the 
government to cancel death sentences pronounced against them in 
absentia," early in January, second secretary at the embassy Luo 
Xiao Guang told AFP. 
  The kidnappers are wanted for several murders, Yemeni 
sources 
said Monday. 
  "No progress was made by the authorities in their talks with 
the kidnappers," he said. 
  One of the hostages is chief engineer Yang Yi [name as 
received], 55, according to the diplomat, who did not name the 
two others. 
  The hostages are held by members of the Khawlan tribe in 
Hajana region, 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Sanaa, he added. 
  To win their release, the embassy is in contact with the 
Ministries of Interior and Planning, and with influential 
Khalwan tribesmen as well, he said. 
  The engineers were kidnapped Saturday while working on a 
road 
project financed by China to link Hajana and Ma'rib, 173 
kilometers (100 miles) east of the capital, in the rugged and 
tribal northeast. 
  The kidnappers also said they wanted the road construction 
to 
stop but they did not explain why, the Chinese diplomat said. 
Almost the third of the road has already been built, he added. 
  The Chinese were kidnapped the same day that Ahnum tribesmen 
in the country's northwest freed three French tourists they had 
held for 20 days in a bid to force the government to build a 
road through their region.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with President Ilyas al-Hirawi by </F>
Muhammad Shuqayr "on the way back to Beirut from Abidjan"; date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] Lebanese concerns -- and they are numerous -- 
did not prevent President Ilyas al-Hirawi from paying attention 
to Lebanese expatriates in Cote d'Ivoire. He went there at an 
invitation from the community's leaders, who had decided -- at 
his wish -- to stop the ongoing competition among themselves. 
They all went to receive and welcome him. [passage omitted] 
  President al-Hirawi said that during all his meetings he 
stressed Lebanon's future role and its people's ability to 
occupy the forefront in the competition with Israel, which is 
planning to invade the region. "I do not believe that we are 
going to face any problem with Syria, contrary to what some 
Lebanese allege. The statements I heard during one of my 
meetings with President Hafiz al-Asad were frank. He said once 
that Lebanon is in the forefront of the states capable of 
competing with Israel. You have the qualities and conditions 
that enable you to make it the Hong Kong of the Middle East." 
  Al-Hirawi adds: "We in Lebanon are not afraid of Syria, 
which sincerely sees us as the lung through which it breathes. 
It is helping us to maintain security. Our success in 
uncovering the series of explosions that occurred in the north 
and in east Sidon is attributable to Syrian security assistance. 
Had it not been for it, we would not have been able to arrest 
one of the network. Syria -- according to President al-Asad -- 
wants nothing from Lebanon. Let everyone be assured about that, 
especially those constantly talking about fears and concerns. 
All it wants is to protect its security rear and not to exploit 
Lebanon or turn it into an arena harmful to its national 
security. This is what we firmly believe. It has confidence in 
Lebanon's future role in the region when peace is established. 
And it sincerely believes that it cannot replace Lebanon, for 
reasons attributable primarily to the system we have." 
  President al-Hirawi stresses that President al-Asad "talks 
about Lebanon's future and praises its capabilities and the 
services it can offer, not only to the Lebanese, but to all the 
Arab states. He calls for safeguarding and protecting them." 
  The Lebanese president reiterates his position "not to allow 
Lebanon to be turned into an arena for settling accounts." He 
says that this position "is derived from the government's and 
people's position. Southern Lebanon and west al-Biqa' can only 
be recovered and liberated from the Israeli occupation on the 
basis of the land-for-a-halt-to-resistance principle, since 
resistance remains a legitimate right for the Lebanese as long 
as the occupier is still on our territory. We did not go to the 
peace talks except to achieve this Lebanese unanimity of 
recovering every occupied inch." 
  On the fate of the negotiations, al-Hirawi says: "We attach 
importance to the U.S.-Syrian summit between Presidents Bill 
Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad. We went to Washington only after the 
assurances vis-a-vis ending the occupation and implementing 
international resolutions. We had hoped that the EC would exert 
pressure on Israel, but it seems that France is currently busy 
organizing its internal situations. This is what I sensed 
during the talks I held with senior French officials who 
attended the Ivorian president's funeral." 
  With regard to Pope John Paul II's upcoming to Lebanon, 
President al-Hirawi stresses that "it is welcomed, and we expect 
good from it." He revealed that Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac 
visited the Vatican recently and urged that it take place. 
  Concluding, he stressed the "need to vigorously safeguard 
security and confront anyone who tries to return the situation 
to what it was." He emphasized that his call to the central 
security council to convene under him in B'abda recently "was 
designed to intercept anyone planning to tamper with security, 
especially after the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 
al-Ma'ayitah, and to stress the need to pursue and punish the 
perpetrators." [passage omitted]

  [Text] An informed political source has revealed that a 
large U.S. delegation of military and political officials 
arrived recently at the U.S. Embassy in 'Awkar. 
  The U.S. delegation's visit at this time has particular 
political connotations because it coincides with the resumption 
of the talks between Lebanon and "Israel." And there have been 
reports of repeated U.S. attempts to breach the Lebanese and 
Syrian positions and encourage Lebanon to join the multilateral 
talks. 
  Other reports have stated that a U.S. delegation visited the 
"occupied zone" a few days ago. This is a signal that the 
current bilateral talks in Washington have begun to discuss the 
details after drawing up the outlines of the agreement between 
Lebanon and "Israel." 
  The same source said U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley, who 
formed 
a new political and media team when he assumed his duties in 
Beirut, personally asked for the large U.S. delegation to come 
to Beirut and stay at the U.S. Embassy for a few days far from 
the limelight to help prepare the U.S. Embassy's plan of action 
and give "advice" to Lebanese officials on how to deal with 
anticipated developments. 
  The political source has monitored [rasada] U.S. Ambassador 
Mark Hambley recently intensifying his contacts and meetings 
with the Lebanese officials within the framework of following up 
the bilateral talks in Washington. 
  According to the same political source, this month or next 
at 
most will witness the "ceremony" of the signing of the 
declaration of principles between Lebanon and "Israel." The 
large U.S. delegation has carried this information from the U.S. 
Administration in Washington. 
  The political source noted that a U.S. military helicopter 
has recently been making frequent trips between the U.S. Embassy 
in 'Awkar and Cyprus carrying U.S. military and political 
officials each time.

  [Text] Beirut, Feb 15 (AFP)--Pakistan wants to buy 10 
Mirage III-C fighter-bombers which have been grounded in Lebanon 
for nearly two decades, the first secretary at the Pakistani 
embassy here said Tuesday [15 February]. 
  Abbas Raza Kazmi told AFP that the embassy's military 
attache 
had visited the planes at the northern base of al-Qulay'at and 
informed the authorities that Pakistan was interested in buying 
them. 
  "We are now waiting for a response from the Lebanese 
authorities. We need a price range and details because as you 
know these are old planes which need maintenance," he said. 
  On Monday, the government decided to sell the 10 French-made 
planes, which have been grounded since the early days of 
Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war and for which there are no spare 
parts. 
  Former prime minister 'Umar Karami, during a visit to France 
in 1992, tried in vain to trade them in for spare parts to equip 
the army or for military helicopters, officials here said. 
  Three Hawker Hunters make up Lebanon's current air force, 
according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

  [Text] Nabih Birri, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, 
went to the south this morning to follow up developments there 
in light of the continuing Israeli military escalation. He 
listened to security briefings about the attacks and telephoned 
Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz and Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul. 
  Israeli occupation forces continue to make the security 
situation in the south and western al-Biqa' worse, amid mounting 
fears of renewed Israeli attacks on the liberated areas. Since 
morning, the Israelis have shelled Frun, al-Ghanduriyah, Zawtar 
al-Sharqiyah, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, Bra'shit, and Haddathah. 
Israeli reinforcements continue to pour into the occupied 
border strip. 
  In the past few hours, the Lebanese Army reinforced its 
positions in Marj al-Zahur, Mimis, and western al-Biqa' with men 
and weapons in anticipation of any eventuality. 
  Elsewhere today, Timor Goksel, spokesman for the UN Interim 
Force in Lebanon, said five Nepalese soldiers were wounded, one 
of them seriously, when their military vehicle overturned 
yesterday near al-Ghanduriyah in Tyre.

Shama' road in the security strip a few minutes after 0900 
today. The occupation forces shelled Wadi al-Nafkhah and (Wadi 
Hinn) from their position in Tayr Harfa. The shelling continued 
intermittently until 1030. 
  The Resistance also claimed the detonation of another charge 
at 1230 today as a patrol of the militia [South Lebanese Army, 
SLA] passed along the Shama'-Tayr Harfa road. The blast 
destroyed a red Mercedes 280 in which the militia's official in

  [Excerpt] Sidon, Lebanon, Feb 15 (AFP)--Israeli warplanes 
blasted positions of the pro-Iranian Hizballah movement in two 
waves of air strikes Tuesday [15 February] in south Lebanon, 
killing one guerrilla and wounding two others, security sources 
said. 
  Plumes of smoke billowed into the air after warplanes 
swooped 
over the Iqlim al-Tuffah ridge east of the port of Sidon, firing 
missiles and dropping several delayed action and cluster bombs, 
the sources said. 
  One Hizballah guerrilla was killed and two others were 
wounded in the raids, they said. 
  A spokesman for Hizballah in Beirut said earlier there were 
no casualties in the attacks, which coincided with the 
resumption in Washington of Arab-Israeli peace talks. 
  In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman confirmed the raid 
saying all aircraft returned safely to base. 
  "All the targets, which were in a zone entirely controlled 
by 
the Hizballah, were destroyed," he said. The Hizballah 
positions were used for training and launching attacks on 
Israeli targets, he added. 
  The raids came three days after Hizballah's secretary 
general 
Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah warned his group would step up attacks 
against Israel in south Lebanon. 
  The Iranian-backed movement killed four Israeli soldiers and 
wounded five others on February 7 in the bloodiest attack since 
August, triggering Israeli air strikes and artillery attacks and 
threats of further reprisals. 
  Israel has lost 30 soldiers in Lebanon since January 1993. 
  In Tuesday's raids two warplanes fired missiles on 
al-Luwayzah, a Hizballah stronghold in the Iqlim al-Tuffah, and 
minutes later, warplanes struck again at Hizballah hideouts in 
nearby Jarju'. 
  A Hizballah source in the port of Tyre said guerrillas fired 
four shoulder-launched SAM-7 missiles at the planes. A security 
source said up to seven missiles were fired at the aircraft.

  [Text] According to our military correspondent, villages in 
the Bint Jubayl area came under a rocket attack from the 
saboteurs' positions in Yatar and the outskirts of Haddathah 
this morning. 
  The al-Hamra' position came under attack from machine-gun 
and 
rocket fire at dawn today. There were no casualties among the 
personnel manning the position, who returned fire. 
  All this happened in the western sector of the security 
strip. In the eastern sector, a South Lebanese Army [SLA] patrol 
in Zummarayya was the target of gunfire and rocket fire from the 
Hirbaya Hill north of the Zummarayya crossing. The 
Zummarayya-Hasbayya-'Ayn Qinya axis was bombarded with 120-mm 
guns from the saboteurs' position in Libbaya. There were no 
casualties. SLA and Israeli artillery returned the fire. 
  In the Jazzin area, the Taw'amat Niha position came under 
artillery fire from hostile positions in Mashgharah. Again 
there were no casualties. 
  Yesterday our correspondent was informed by official 
military 
sources that the Israeli army and the SLA forces in the border 
area have been placed on a higher level of alert during the past 
few days. This follows expectations that the Nayif 
Hawatimah-led Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[DFLP] will escalate its activities and attempt acts of sabotage 
in the border area on 28 February, the anniversary of its 
founding. The sources added that the DFLP has in the past few 
years tried to intensify its activities on this occasion.

men, on one hand, and Israeli troops and the agent Lahd militia 
[South Lebanese Army] on the other, along the Zummarayya combat 
line since 0800 today. Artillery and rockets are being used in 
the clashes. 
  A group of resistance men attacked a Lahdist patrol on the 
Hasbani-Zummarayya road this morning. Resistance men also 
pounded Lahdist posts in 'Ayn Qinya. 
  Israeli forces bombarded several southern areas at 0700 
today, including the Mimas axis, Marj al-Zuhur, Mazra'at 'Ayn 
Jabbur, Jabal al-Zahr, and Dallafah. A column of 12 Israeli 
armored vehicles escorted by some 50 troops advanced toward the 
Zummarayya crossing point. 
  Meanwhile, the area between al-Hamra' and Haddathah came 
under fierce attacks amid Israeli overflights today.

  [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, Feb 15 (AFP) -- The Israeli navy 
abducted at dawn Tuesday five fishermen in Lebanese territorial 
waters and towed their boats towards Israel, fishermen here said. 
  The five were on board two boats just south of the port of 
Tyre when an Israeli gunboat intercepted them, a fisherman who 
was in the vicinity said. 
  He charged that members of Israel's proxy militia manning a 
position overlooking Tyre opened fire at the fishermen at the 
same time but there were no casualties. 
  The Israeli navy patrols the waters of south Lebanon, 
intercepting boats and seizing travelers or fishermen for 
questioning as part of operations to check for anti-Israeli 
guerrillas.

made to the U.S. television Cable News Network [CNN], yesterday, 
Tuesday, 15 February. 
  In a statement to INA, Lt. Gen. Rashid added that in his 
statements, Ekeus gave the impression that Iraq continues to 
withhold information on chemical weapons. 
  The MIO director urged the chairman of the UN Special 
Commission to shoulder his responsibilities fairly, to confine 
himself to the tasks of the UN Special Commission as spelled out 
in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and to steer 
clear of the U.S. anti-Iraq political maneuvers and pressures, 
which have nothing to do with the UN security Council 
resolutions. 
  The following is the text of the statement: 
  MIO Director General Lt. Gen. 'Amir Muhammad Rashid has 
said: 
We have received with extreme amazement the statements 
Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman of the UN Special 
Commission, made to CNN on 15 February 1994. 
  In these statements, Ekeus gave the impression that Iraq 
continues to withhold part of the information pertaining to 
chemical weapons. As a matter of fact, Ekeus has made it clear 
in letters addressed to me that Iraq has provided the required 
information regarding its previous programs, that this 
information is credible and comprehensive, and that it is 
sufficient for the purposes of the UN Special Commission, as 
enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. 
Hence, his recent pronouncements and statements to CNN 
misrepresent facts, and contradict the documents he himself has 
submitted to the UN Security Council. 
  Lt. Gen. Rashid said: It has become clear to us, 
particularly after Iraq accepted Resolution 715 in November 
1993, that Ambassador Ekeus makes himself part of the U.S. 
political maneuvers which seek to prolong the unjust blockade 
imposed on Iraq. Therefore, he makes contradictory statements 
serving in fact the purpose of U.S. maneuvers. 
  Rashid continued: We ask the chairman of the Special 
Commission to shoulder his responsibilities in an objective 
manner, adhere to the Commission's tasks as defined by the UN 
Security Council resolutions, and dissociate himself from the 
U.S. anti-Iraq maneuvers and political pressure which has 
nothing to do with the Security Council resolutions. 
  On Ekeus statements on the effects of the blockade on the 
Iraqi people and his arbitrary criticism of Iraq for not 
implementing what he called a mechanism presented to it by the 
United Nations to sell a fixed amount of oil to buy food and 
medicine under international supervision, Rashid said: First, 
this subject is not within the jurisdiction of the chairman of 
the Special Commission. It is within the jurisdiction of the UN 
general secretariat. Second, Ekeus wants to dissociate himself 
from being largely responsible for continuing the blockade 
imposed on Iraq and hence the continuation of the Iraqi people's 
suffering. This is because under U.S. pressure, Ekeus is 
reluctant to tell the truth which he knows only too well; 
namely, that Iraq has abided by UN resolutions. Had he 
possessed the courage and objectivity required from an 
international official, he would have presented his report on 
this issue to the Security Council, thus, leading to the 
implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and ending the 
Iraqi peoples suffering. The blame he levels at Iraq because it 
rejects arrangements that infringe on its sovereignty and 
dignity is blatantly ridiculous.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Nasrallah al-Dawudi: "The Accursed, </F>
Self-Contradictory One"] 
  [Text] The Iraqis have dealt with the accursed Ekeus with 
honesty and good will, avoiding the tricks of politics and the 
encroachments of the four big powers in the UN corridors. This 
has been intended to draw attention to the fact that we have 
frequently stressed, namely, that Iraq has fulfilled its 
commitments toward the Security Council resolutions. 
  This fact was confirmed in the statements made by the 
accursed Ekeus. These statements usually begin positively, and 
those concerned with politics and its secrets clearly understand 
such positive statements. Thus, the Security Council and its 
Special Commission should also clearly fulfill their commitments 
toward Iraq, lift the total embargo of its oil exports, and end 
the unjust blockade without resorting to a test period. This is 
because positiveness in international dealings means 
credibility. Throughout the joint work with the UN Special 
Commission, Iraq has been credible, particularly within the 
framework of building confidence, stemming from Iraq's 
international commitments and the maintenance of independent 
political and national decisionmaking. 
  Has the accursed Ekeus managed to move one step forward on 
the path of this positiveness, which remained the common 
denominator of all his statements before and after each round of 
talks held in Baghdad or at the UN headquarters? One who 
follows events sees the contrary and even senses a contradiction 
that evokes wonder and astonishment. Days after the talks 
ended, the accursed one ignored positiviteness and said 
something that satisfied the four big powers and stimulated the 
appetite of the agents, the defeatists, and their hired media 
trumpets run by Zionism. 
  The accursed Ekeus went back on his recent statements when 
he 
was received by the slaves of the Americans in the [Iraqi] 
governorate of Kuwait. Thus, positiveness turned into 
differences, and the tears he shed at the al-Rashid Hotel turned 
into greed for a handful of dollars. Ekeus wanted to ignite a 
fire and undermine Iraqi steadfastness. But, he did not realize 
that an Iraqi palm tree will not bow to storms. History will 
note that Ekeus has sold only the honor of his job, lost 
himself, and deserves a new nickname in addition to his previous 
nicknames. Mankind will recall Ekeus as an accursed and 
self-contradictory one. How bad are his nicknames and his loss 
of conscience!

  [Text] To hide them from the eyes of international 
inspectors, the regime of tyrant Saddam Husayn has been 
transferring its remaining chemical and biological weapons from 
one place to another. According to people who recently arrived 
in Amman, the dictatorial regime began using the oil 
pipelines--out of operation because of the international 
embargo--in one last attempt to hide its banned weapons.

  [Text] Baghdad, 14 Feb (INA) -- President Saddam Husayn has 
received a cable from the Interim Regional Command of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party in Syria on the third anniversary of the 
imperialist-Zionist military aggression. 
  The cable says: The immortal epic of the Mother of Battles, 
fought by great Iraq, has charted a course for the Arab nation 
to prove its cultural and historical presence and safeguard its 
rights and dignity in a changing world dominated by forces of 
evil, falsehood, and serfdom, led by the United States and its 
ally, world Zionism. 
  The cable adds: By virtue of your God-given faith, 
leadership, and wisdom and the people's deep love and true 
allegiance, you, the inspired knight, were qualified to lead 
this major, historic confrontation. Tyranny and aggression were 
defeated at your own hands. In your sacred name, strugglers and 
fighters uttered the biggest "No" in the history of mankind, and 
through you the voice of human justice rose above all other 
voices and the banner of God is Great fluttered over all other 
banners.

<F P=106> ["AL-THAWRAH Diary" column by Munir 'Abd-al-Karim: "When </F>
Words Lose Their Sense"] 
  [Text] Indeed, Prophet Muhammad uttered the truth when he 
said: "Astrologers are liars, even if their predictions turn 
out to be true." 
  Even if their predictions are true, astrologers do not mean 
to tell the truth. Their predictions are lies based on 
probability, which could, by sheer coincidence, be true on 
certain occasions. 
  By the same token, traitors are also liars, even if they 
tell 
the truth. One might hear nice words and admire them. However, 
once one finds out who uttered these words, their sense is lost 
and their beauty turns into insults and vulgar expressions. 
  "We have fought honorably, and we make peace honorably." 
Beautiful words, right? You will laugh when you find out who 
said these words and when. The speaker is Hafiz al-Asad and the 
occasion is his meeting with his new lord, Clinton. 
  It is common knowledge that Hafiz al-Asad had no honor on 
two 
occasions during which fighting was truly honorable. The first 
is the June war, when al-Asad was defense minister, and gave the 
Golan as a gift to the Zionist entity. The second is the 
October war when Damascus was about to be captured had it not 
been for the chivalrous Iraqi leadership and its heroic army 
that came to the rescue. The Iraqi army removed the enemy and 
drew up a plan for attack and infiltration into the enemy's 
defenses. However, only hours before carrying out the plan, it 
was surprised that the "honorable fighter" had accepted a 
cease-fire, because its premeditated objective was "provocation" 
rather than liberation. 
  We do not want to do injustice to the man. Therefore, we 
testify that he displayed "honor" on many occasions in which 
fighting was not honorable. 
  He had the "honor" of destroying the city of Hamah and 
killing 25,000 of its people and supervising the massacre of the 
Tadmur desert prison. 
  He had the "honor" of killing Palestinians and the national 
movement in Lebanon since the 'Ayn al-Rummanah events in 1975 
and up until now. 
  He had the "honor" of watching, and sometimes assisting in, 
the Zionist army's attacks on Lebanon. 
  He had the "honor" of watching the massacre of the 
Palestinians in Sabra and Shatila. 
  The highest order of "honor" won by Hafiz al-Asad was 
through 
two stands in which he expressed his "national honor" which he 
brags about more than extremist nationalist leaders. 
  The first, when he "honorably" sided by the Iranian 
aggression against Iraq for eight years. The second, when he 
had the "honor" of participating, along with the allied forces, 
in the 30-state aggression against Iraq. 
  A person displaying all this "honor" in his fights will 
definitely have the "honor" of throwing himself into the lap of 
the cousins (Rabin and Peres). Even if the Golan returns 
through a disgraceful settlement, al-Asad still bears the 
disgrace of surrendering it and leaving it for 27 years without 
liberation. We are here talking about usurped Syrian Arab 
territory, and not Jerusalem, Baysan, or Nazareth. 
  Indeed, traitors are liars, even if they tell the truth.

  [Text] Baghdad, 15 Feb (INA) -- The Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party and the Yemeni Revolutionary Democratic Party today signed 
a program of action and cooperation to enhance and cement 
relations of brotherliness, steadfastness, and friendship 
between the two friendly parties and peoples. 
  The program was signed for the Ba'th Party by 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
al-Hashimi, chief of the Ba'th Party's Foreign Relations Bureau, 
and for the Yemeni party by Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Dughaysh, the 
party's secretary general. The program urges coordinating 
efforts at Arab and international forums and conferences and 
educating Arab and world public opinion about the serious, 
tragic effects of the crime of the unjust embargo against the 
Iraqi people and using all means to lift it. 
  The program provides for exchanging visits and expertise to 
ensure continued communication between the two parties in the 
interest of common pan-Arab struggle and the Arab nation's 
objectives of liberation and progress. The program provides for 
supporting the Arab Popular Forces Conference and contributing 
to its activities and decisions.

  [Text] On 16 February 1989, the Arab Cooperation Council 
[ACC], grouping Iraq, Egypt, Jordan, and Yemen, was launched in 
Baghdad. The ACC set a good example for promoting joint Arab 
action in the interest of the Arab nation and its fateful causes. 
  The launching of the ACC was an enlightened and rational 
response to the challenges and dangers facing the nation, 
particularly after the intensification of military conflicts in 
the region and after the pan-Arab and national security of ACC 
members was jeopardized, not to mention the growing inclination 
of world states to establish economic groupings to protect their 
national interests. 
  The announcement launching the ACC was widely welcomed and 
supported by the Arabs. People maintained that Iraq's ACC 
membership, given its powerful national and pan-Arab weight, 
would prompt the ACC to take a serious course in joint Arab 
action. That is why the obstruction of the ACC work was one of 
the objectives of the U.S.-Atlantic-Zionist conspiracy, to which 
Iraq was exposed. The Egyptian regime's announcement to suspend 
Egypt's ACC membership has confirmed the U.S. desire to thwart 
the ACC's noble pan-Arab objectives. The Egyptian regime's 
decision was met with extensive and broad opposition in Egypt. 
This opposition was reflected in the arguments exchanged by the 
Egyptian People's Assembly members when they debated the future 
of the ACC on 8 February 1994. The Assembly's debate on the 
issue showed a massive support for Iraq. The deputies condemned 
the embargo, and urged Arab states to lift the embargo on Iraq. 
  A large number of Egyptian parliamentarians urged support 
for 
Iraq so that it may confront plots, and so that it may become, 
once again, the mainstay of pan-Arab resurgence. The National 
Progressive Unionist Grouping [NPUG] is one of the parties that 
expressed support for Iraq. NPUG representative Khalid 
Muhyi-al-Din asserted that the embargo is aimed at destroying 
Iraq and destabilizing the Arabs. 
  For his part, Fikri al-Jazzar, speaking for independents at 
the People's Assembly, urged the Arab states to shoulder their 
pan-Arab responsibilities, and to wage a battle to lift the 
embargo imposed on Iraq. 
  Hence, the positions of the people's representatives were 
made clear when they debated the future of the ACC. They 
emphasized that the role of the ACC must be rehabilitated at the 
current phase, particularly since it constitutes a nucleus for 
Arab unity. They added that foreign pressures must be shunned, 
because foreigners deem any Arab grouping a threat to their 
interests and evil objectives. This was explained by 
Diya'-al-Din Dawud, secretary general of the Nasirite Party, who 
asserted that if it revokes its ACC membership, Egypt will 
confirm that this will be in response to foreign and colonialist 
dictates, which aim to isolate Egypt from the Arab homeland.

  [Text] National Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih, today 
received Hugh Stevens, of the British committee investigating 
international war crimes, who is on a visit to Iraq. 
  Sa'di Mahdi Salih told him the West must understand that the 
Iraqi people, who stood up to the largest aggressive force in 
history, are solidly behind their wise leadership. The Iraqis, 
he emphasized, are determined to defend their country's 
sovereignty, and have confidence in their political choices. 
The Iraqis will not stand for any interference in their own 
affairs. 
  Sa'di Mahdi Salih said the United States is working to 
perpetuate its control over the international community to 
advance its own and Western strategic ambitions in the Arab 
world. He urged the international community to work hard to 
promote better international relations. 
  Mr. Stevens indicated that his visit to Iraq was useful in 
that he was able to see firsthand the Iraqi people's distress 
caused by the relentless sanctions. He was also impressed by 
Iraq's rehabilitation effort to repair the damage wrought by the 
aggression. He will use the information gleaned from his visit 
to Iraq in a political file geared toward British public opinion.

  [Text] Baghdad, 11 Feb (INA) -- An official spokesman 
stated in Baghdad today that, since the news blackout it has 
sought to impose on the mysterious disease that afflicted U.S. 
troops in the Gulf war, the U.S. Administration has, for some 
time, been engaged in a drive to mislead the American public and 
come up with fantastic explanations to ward off legal and 
criminal responsibility. 
  The spokesman said scientific U.S. and European circles 
emphasize that the mysterious disease that U.S. and British 
servicemen caught in the Gulf war could be traced to the 
intensive use by American forces of uranium-coated projectiles 
mounted on tanks and antitank aircraft. 
  An official spokesman for the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health 
recently admitted nuclear radiation was detected in tank and 
truck chassis north of Kuwait City, the Iraqi spokesman noted. 
This is in addition to reports published by U.S. circles, like 
the Nevada-based RURAL ALLIANCE [name as received] about 
attempts by the U.S. Department of Defense to suppress the side 
effects of these substances on the crews manning U.S. tanks and 
aircraft to avert insubordination. 
  The Iraqi spokesman's statements are in reaction to an 
allegation made by Senator Donald Riegle before the Senate 
yesterday that, in the late '80's, a U.S. firm sold Iraq the 
biological substances that it might have used in the war. 
  The U.S. senator's contentions are yet another silly and 
pointless attempted whitewash to deflect attention and influence 
the course of investigations. The senator, the spokesman added, 
might have sought to bring the real explanations to light and 
used his legal powers to bear instead of lying to Congress and 
the U.S. public.

  [Text] New York, 15 Feb (INA) -- Iraq has informed the 
general secretariat of the United Nations of further violations 
of its airspace by U.S. aircraft for purposes of surveillance 
and provocation and dropping thermal flares. 
  Iraq's permanent UN delegate, in a letter to Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali, said that from 1 to 10 February, 841 
sorties were conducted over large areas of northern and southern 
Iraq. 
  Two T.S.R.S1 [as received] American reconnaissance planes 
violated Iraq's airspace on 3 and 6 February, flew over 
al-Nasiriyah, al-'Amarah, al-Samawah, al-Jalibah, al-Ratawi, 
Qal'at Sukkar, and (?al-Busayyah), and then headed to Saudi 
Arabia. 
  A hostile plane on 7 February dropped three thermal flares 
over the Ba'shiqah district in the Governorate of Ninawa.

<F P=106> ["Good Morning" column by Ahmad 'Abd-al-Majid] </F>
  [Text] Turkey has the right to move in many directions to 
save its eroding economy as a result of the economic blockade on 
Iraq. Among the neighborly countries, Turkey benefited the most 
from the exportation of Iraqi oil. Furthermore, it was more 
secure than the other countries because its borders with Iraq 
were under the control of the central government [in Baghdad]. 
Such security does not exist at all now because of the 
miserable situation in northern Iraq. Turkey's attempts to 
coordinate with the so-called Kurdistan Front as well as its 
relations with al-Talabani and Barzani did not save it from 
terrorist operations, explosions, and assassinations. These acts 
are U.S. and Western commodities that are exported to the 
closest friends, not out of revenge, but to maintain their 
subservience. 
  Diplomatic sources said that the Turkish prime minister was 
serious in presenting its country's problem to the leaders of 
the UN Security Council permanent states. In fact, she 
presented Turkey's economic problems and damage resulting from 
the sanctions on Iraqi oil exportation. It seems, however, that 
the efforts of the prime minister either cooled down or were 
confronted by U.S.- Gulf obstacles. 
  Turkish journalists, whom we met in Baghdad, ask the 
following question: How long will Turkey's hand remain extended 
to the Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the rulers of Kuwait? 
Can these emirates feed Turkish citizens and provide them with 
basic needs and a secure life? 
  The violence that prevails in Turkey, particularly in 
Anatolia, demonstrates the feeling of humiliation, poverty, and 
subservience. The Turks, who live along the international 
highway that leads to the Iraqi borders, are now regretting the 
time when they were their own masters. They planted their lands 
and sold their commodities and agricultural products to the 
neighborly country with dignity and a feeling of reassurance 
about their future. 
  The Turkish citizens know full well that their country's 
future lies in a firm trade exchange with Iraq and in common 
historical interests between the two countries. No donor state 
can resolve the problem of a country like Turkey because it is 
an economic-security issue to which Iraq is a direct party. 
Turkish officials know well that Iraq spares no effort to 
promote its relations with its neighbors, provided that those 
neighbors are free in adopting their decisions and take into 
consideration the interests of their own people, not other 
objectives that are dictated to them from outside. 
  Mrs. Ciller raised Turkey's suppressed cry regarding the 
effects of the economic blockade. Others should understand that 
the entire Turkish people will raise a louder cry if the 
disregard of Turkey's relations and historical relations with 
Iraq continues.

  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Western diplomatic 
sources in Amman announced yesterday that the French Government 
has rejected the Iraqi Government's request to grant Lieutenant 
General Husayn Kamil Hasan al-Majid, son-in-law of Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn, an entry visa to France. Paris 
attributed this to political and security reasons. Meanwhile 
other reports said that Lt. Gen. al-Majid underwent brain 
surgery in the al-Husayn Medical Center in Amman. Iraqis in 
Amman said that the Iraqi president's son-in-law and cousin went 
into a coma and was partially paralyzed last week. Urgent 
medical tests were conducted and he was immediately moved to 
Amman to be treated by Jordanian doctors. Attempts were made for 
five days to cure him but all failed and the deep coma 
continued. As a result, doctors had to operate on him the day 
before yesterday to remove a brain tumor. The Iraqi president's 
son-in-law is accompanied by a large security team which has 
been joined by the Iraqi ambassador to Amman and a number of his 
aides in the Industry Ministry and the Military 
Industrialization Organization, which al-Majid heads. 
  Lt. Gen. al-Majid is a special adviser to the Iraqi 
president 
with the rank of minister. He was appointed defense minister in 
1991. He has been chairman of the Military Industrialization 
Organization since 5 September 1993. He has been in charge of 
the Military Industrialization Organization and is considered 
responsible for the programs for the chemical, bacterial, 
nuclear, and missile weapons the United Nations is dismantling.

  [Text] Desertions have been on the increase lately. More 
soldiers are refusing to continue their military service, 
particularly in southern and northern Iraq. Saddam's regime has 
tried frantically to contain this phenomenon. It has allocated 
a reward of 3,000 dinars to anyone who provides information 
about a deserter from military service. If the informer guides 
the authorities to the deserter's location the reward becomes 
10,000 dinars. The regime's measures follow attempts to control 
desertion that failed despite its seizing the movable and 
immovable properties of deserters and punishing the families 
that give them refuge.

  [Text] The Islamic revolution mujahidin have confronted a 
special unit of the regime's security forces known as the 
emergency company. The company was trying to arrest an innocent 
citizen from the area of (al-Sajiyah), which belongs to the 
district of (al-Shifayij) in the governorate of al-Nasiriyah. 
The operation resulted in the killing of the captain who 
commanded the company and two mercenaries. Other people were 
hurt in the operation. One of the vehicles used by the 
attacking force was burned. 
  A group of mujahidin fighters dealt a punitive military blow 
to the headquarters of Saddam's forces in (al-Mudaynah) district 
in the governorate of al-Basrah using 60-mm mortars, hitting 
military locations and the (al-Fathiyah) checkpoint. It also 
killed or wounded regime men.

  [Text] Thousands of leaflets opposing the regime have been 
distributed during the past few days in the governorates of 
al-Basrah and al-'Amarah and the districts and subdistricts 
belonging to them. These leaflets contain instructions and 
calls to the Iraqi people and Army to rebel against tyrant 
Saddam's regime and to cut off the road before the cliques of 
terrorism and crime that want to destroy Iraq and humiliate its 
people through starvation and oppression. 
  This was revealed by our sources in south Iraq in a report 
in 
which they said that groups of Islamic Resistance men 
distributed revolutionary leaflets in the city of al-Basrah and 
the district of al-Qurnah. The sources added that the biggest 
drop took place at the end of last week. It included the 
district of al-Majarr al-Kabir, Qal'at Salih, al-Maymunah, the 
city of al-'Amarah, and the subdistricts of al-Salam and Nahr 
'Udayl, which belong to the governorate of al-'Amarah. 
  The antiregime leaflets were also distributed in the 
districts of (al-Mudaynah), al-Qurnah, and al-Dayr, the 
subdistricts of al-'Uzayr, (Salhah), and al-Huwayr, and the city 
of al-Basrah, all of which belong to al-Basrah Governorate. 
  Our sources affirmed that the distribution has caused a big 
uproar among the regime's circles. It has forced it to place 
its forces on alert and carry out large-scale search operations 
in these areas and arrest citizens.

  [Text] The residents of the Birah Makrun complex have 
staged a large demonstration in al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate in 
front of the offices of the agent and sabotage cliques. The 
residents demanded redressing their living conditions and daily 
suffering, noting that they have not received food supplies for 
months. In addition, electricity and other basic services are 
absent. 
  Another demonstration was staged at the Shawrash complex in 
Chamchamal District, during which demonstrators demanded 
ensuring food supplies to them. An exchange of fire ensued with 
the demonstrators, prompting the sabotage cliques to close the 
Chamchamal-al-Sulaymaniyah road. 
  Agent and sabotage cliques receive food supplies and then 
sell them on the black market. They are also stealing electric 
wires and transformers and smuggling them across the border, 
thus causing a blanket power cutoff in the region.

enabled the security services to find a quantity of weapons and 
various items which were hidden in an Algerian freighter by the 
sailor Hacene Mialet. His confessions and other clues indicated 
that this equipment was to be delivered to him in the German 
port of Hamburg by Djamel Lounici who is wanted for involvement 
in a number of terrorist activities. 
  An unforeseen event happened and prevented the delivery of 
the equipment at the German harbor, but in the end the weapons 
were delivered to Hacene Mialet in the Belgian port of Antwerp. 
Investigations are continuing and have led to the arrest of 
several people involved including the above-mentioned sailor. 
  The weapons seized are: 20 rifles, 15 automatic pistols, a 
considerable quantity of ammunition, two-way radios, and optical 
equipment.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir </F>
'Arafat by Ghassan Shirbil in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] [Shirbil] What were the negotiations like before 
the Cairo Agreement? 
  ['Arafat] I had wished that an initial agreement would be 
made, as I had agreed with Mr. Peres, in the presence of my 
brother, Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. I had also wished 
that this initial agreement would be followed by a final 
agreement in the presence of Mr. Rabin in Cairo. We covered a 
considerable distance in Davos during the world economic 
conference, and before that in Oslo during the funeral of our 
friend Holst, the former Norwegian foreign minister. However, 
we were surprised recently by Israel's request for a further 
delay of one week, after the Israeli delegation received several 
telephone calls from Tel Aviv, under the pretext that they need 
more time to study the draft that is under discussion. 
  Apparently, as has been reported by several Israeli 
newspapers, primarily YEDI'OT AHARONOT, the military command has 
an intransigent stand against the agreement. As a matter of 
fact, the question will become one of international 
responsibility rather than Palestinian responsibility. The 
agreement was under President Clinton's auspices at the White 
House and bears the signatures of the two cosponsors of the 
conference. There was also an international blessing of the 
agreement. What is happening reflects new, hard-line Israeli 
positions that try to demolish the very foundations of the 
agreement. These stands are being fabricated and are related to 
issues that are foreign to the agreement, in letter and spirit. 
International law says that the withdrawal of any occupying 
power from any territory means that this territory is liberated. 
This applies to Gaza and Jericho. 
  The current attempts to add as many texts as possible is 
meant to undermine this concept in the September agreement in 
Washington. It is now clear, after all that has happened in 
Oslo, Paris, Davos, and Cairo, that there is an ongoing Israeli 
attempt not to honor the deadlines they have agreed to, or not 
to honestly implement the agreement. This is now the 
responsibility of the entire international community. 
  [Shirbil] Do you feel that after the U.S.-Syrian Geneva 
summit, Israel is no longer interested in quick progress on the 
Palestinian track? 
  ['Arafat] No. The evidence is that there was no concrete 
progress in the recent negotiations in Washington. Anyway, any 
progress on any Arab track is progress on all other tracks. 
  [Shirbil] There has been recently more talk about 
differences between Rabin and Peres. 
  ['Arafat] I do not take things at face value. The bottom 
line is that I am facing the Israeli government, whether it is 
represented by Rabin, Peres, or Baraq. 
  [Shirbil] It is said that arms are being distributed in Gaza 
and elsewhere. What do you think? 
  ['Arafat] The most serious thing about this issue is that 
Israeli intelligence officers, with the full knowledge of the 
government, are carrying out a huge arms sales in the occupied 
territories, as part of a malicious plan to ignite 
inter-Palestinian fighting after their departure. Israeli Army 
officers are behind the arms sales. However, I have great 
confidence in our people and their awareness, struggle, faith, 
and power. 
  [Shirbil] This means that your taking over power in Gaza and 
Jericho will bring up the possibility of a confrontation with 
some of the population? 
  ['Arafat] No. The issues is not that of some people. The 
public selling of arms, in this huge quantity, is meant to 
create a security problem in all of our occupied territory. I 
hold the cosponsors of the conference responsible for this 
serious action, and I have raised this question with U.S., 
Russian, European, and Chinese officials, since they are among 
the permanent members of the Security Council. 
  [Shirbil] What will happen if Israel pursues its current 
approach? 
  ['Arafat] The result is that the agreement will not be 
implemented. Israel, and all its supporters on the 
international scene -- Israel does not act without the support 
of some international forces -- should understand that peace is 
not only a Palestinian and Arab demand; it is a Palestinian, 
Arab, international, Israeli, U.S., and European demand. 
Everybody should understand that the alternative is 
comprehensive anarchy in the region, whose scope only God knows, 
and that will definitely Balkanize the region. Any Israeli or 
international official who supports Israel in this stand is 
mistaken if he believes that Israel can quietly swallow up any 
Arab territory. 
  [Shirbil] Can we say the agreement is in danger? 
  ['Arafat] There is no doubt about this. It is obvious that 
Israel procrastinates and tries to evade implementing it. It 
suffices for Rabin to announce that dates are not sacrosanct to 
show how false their approach to peace is. 
  [Shirbil] Are you preparing yourself for its possible 
collapse? 
  ['Arafat] I am a practical man and I do not live in dreams. 
Things will be tackled as they come. For every action, there is 
a reaction equal to it, according to engineering theories. 
  [Shirbil] For example, resuming armed operations? 
  ['Arafat] Not only armed operations, but there will be total 
confusion in the region. 
  [Shirbil] Are there contacts with the Hamas Movement to 
contain any eventual deterioration? 
  ['Arafat] Contacts are under way with all the brother 
officials in the factions in the Palestinian arena. 
  [Shirbil] What about dialogue with Hamas? Are there new 
attempts in this respect? 
  ['Arafat] We never suspend contacts with any Palestinian 
faction. 
  [Shirbil] How do you assess the results of your visit to 
Saudi Arabia and your talks with King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, 
custodian of the two holy mosques? 
  ['Arafat] The truth is that it was a blessed visit. Tne 
meeting was cordial, brotherly, and positive, as is the case 
when his majesty the king meets us and with all of Palestine. As 
you know, I used to put his majesty in the picture, whether 
directly through letters or indirectly, about all the details of 
developments in the Palestinian arena, and he supported us. This 
support was expressed in the statement the Saudi council of 
ministers issued at the end of the visit. We thank his majesty 
for this, particularly his stand on the question of Jerusalem 
and the interest he shows in this issue, toward the Palestinian 
cause, and the Palestinian people. I thank him from the bottom 
of my heart. Let us hope we will meet soon, God willing, to pray 
in Jerusalem. 
  [Shirbil] From King Husayn's statement, one understands that 
the Jordanian authorities wish to stop speaking about the 
confederation issue? 
  ['Arafat] I read this statement. Of course, for us, the 
issue 
of confederation is a political decision made by the Palestine 
Nationl Council [PNC] in 1983 and which it reconfirmed in every 
session that followed. This decision calls for a confederal 
union with Jordan in accordance with the voluntary and free 
choice of the two fraternal Jordanian and Palestinian people. 
This decision is binding on all the Palestinian command and all 
the Palestinian factions. However, at the same time, we respect 
and appreciate any free Jordanian option as mentioned in our PNC 
decision. 
  [Shirbil] It seems that since last August Jordan and the PLO 
have been speaking different languages, or at least there has 
not been an agreement on interpretation? 
  ['Arafat] I do agree on this specific topic. As I have said, 
the talk about a confederation has come within the framework of 
the voluntary and free choice of the two fraternal people. We 
do not want to impose our political decision on anyone. You 
surely remember that one of the decisions was made at the PNC 
session in Amman in 1984 and in two agreements, one of which I 
and his majesty the king signed in 1985, dealing with a 
confederation. After this came the disengagement decision that 
his majesty the king announced and the 1985 agreement was 
suspended. Then we went to Madrid as a joint delegation in 
accordance with a Palestinian-Jordanian agreement the two 
parties signed. 
  [Shirbil] Some say you are intentionally postponing settling 
some matters until after you leave for Gaza and Jericho 
  ['Arafat] Like what? 
  [ Shirbil] The relationship with Jordan and issues 
concerning 
the Palestinian arena? 
  ['Arafat] This is untrue. We signed two agreements with 
Jordan, an economic agreement and a security agreement. We 
signed with Egypt an economic agreement, and we are in the 
process of signing a security agreement. At my recent meeting 
with His Majesty King Husayn we agreed that the joint 
committees' work will continue. 
  [Shirbil] Do you plan to visit Syria again after your 
recent meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad to offer condolences 
on the death of his son Basil? 
  ['Arafat] I was dutybound to go to Syria to offer sympathies 
after his profound loss, considering the longstanding, strong 
relationship I have with President al-Asad. I had known the 
departed since he was a little boy. It is a brotherly relation 
between us that developed 30 years ago. May God help my brother 
President al-Asad to overcome this profound calamity, which is a 
loss for Syria, myself, and all of us. I welcome any 
opportunity to visit the brothers in Syria. I want to proudly 
note the meeting of the heads of negotiating teams in Washington 
as a beginning of the restoration of this cohesion to the talks. 
  [Shirbil] Do you expect imminent progress on the 
Syrian-Israeli track, for example, reaching a declaration of 
principles? 
  ['Arafat] It was supposed and expected that something will 
happen in Washington. However, according to what the brothers 
in Syria said, no progress was made on the Syrian track, nor on 
the Jordanian, Lebanese, and Palestinian tracks. This reveals 
the size of the maneuver by which Israel is trying to buy time. 
  [Shirbil] The question of democracy has once again surfaced 
in the Palestinian arena. What is the scope of the problem? 
  ['Arafat] The very fact that this question has surfaced in 
the arena gives an indication of the scope of democracy in this 
arena. I want to ask: Can this problem surface in other arenas 
with the same candor and clarity that we see in the Palestinian 
arena? We are democratic. We are proud that we have achieved a 
democracy of the jungle of rifles since the launching of the 
Palestinian revolution and up until now. The revolution and the 
people take pride in this achievement. 
  [Shirbil] I meant charges that you have a monopoly over 
decisionmaking? 
  ['Arafat] Do you know the saying: They could not find 
anything wrong with the rose, so they told it: You have red 
cheeks? I am a businessman for 18 hours a day, and I follow 
everything, small and important. I have been this way since the 
launching of the revolution. Is there anything wrong with that? 
I am proud, at the same time, that I do not make any decision 
without seeking the advice of my comrades. I also take pride in 
different views and criticism. I always remember the famous 
saying: May God have mercy on anyone who corrects [Caliph] 
'Umar. I also remember Voltaire's saying: I might disagree 
with you, but I am willing to fight for your freedom of 
expression. No doubt, I am there in the serious, important, and 
major junctures that face our cause, people, and destiny. I am 
a man who does not hide. I do not bury my head in the sand. 
But the truth is that there has been a campaign, since we 
signed the agreement, by some brothers and friends and some 
international quarters, to try to strangle this new baby, 
Palestine, which is experiencing a rebirth. 
  There are many forces against this baby and against this 
rebirth. This event will change the map of the Middle East. 
They say that we are incapable of running a state. This is one 
of the stupid questions that are being raised. Right from the 
outset, we have been a state within a revolution. Has any 
revolution paid as much attention as we did to education and 
medical services? Lebanon bears witness to this, through our 
hospitals and dispensaries. 
  Has any revolution paid as much attention as we did to 
universities, social care, sports, and exporting agricultural 
products? I want to know why those questions were not asked to 
Mandela, Mugabe, Samora Machel, Ben Bella, and why they did not 
ask all the revolutionaries who liberated their countries? 
  [Shirbil] When did you first think of peace with the 
Israelis? Were the first contacts with them like the ones 'Isam 
al-Sartawi held after obtaining your agreement? 
  ['Arafat] Since 1974, I have been thinking of negotiations 
with Israel. The PNC decided to establish a national authority 
on any inch of land we liberated or from which Israel pulled 
out. In the same year, the Palestinian revolution accepted a 
joint Arab delegation to the Geneva talks. In 1977, we accepted 
the Egyptian-U.S. statement in which they proposed a joint Arab 
delegation, including a low-level PLO representation. We then 
decided to deliver our approval of Resolution No. 242 to 
Gromyko. I also want to recall our approval of King Fahd's 
initiative in Fes in 1981. 'Isam al-Sartawi won my agreement to 
meet with the Israelis. I was the first to meet with members 
of the Israeli Communist Party, Rakah, in Berlin in 1983. What 
is strange is that some Rakah members, like Mahmud Darwish, 
later became members of the PLO Executive Committee. Such 
meetings were regarded at that time as a crime. We were also 
the first to support the "Peace Now Movement" in Israel and the 
first to call for a democratic state in which people can coexist. 
  You have asked me about fears regarding our current 
decisions 
and steps. I do not feel I have made a mistake. I have carried 
out the PNC resolutions, as well as the Palestinian peace 
initiative. Did we go to Madrid to dance or to make peace? 
  [Shirbil] Did you wish you would enter Palestinian territory 
with a machine gun? 
  ['Arafat] I entered it with a machine gun. The last time was 
in 1968. 
  [Shirbil] How many people betrayed you and abandoned you in 
delicate situations? 
  ['Arafat] Many fell in every stage of the revolution, but 
they were few compared to those who joined the revolution, more 
determined and resolute. 
  [Shirbil] With whom had you wished that you would enter 
Palestinian territory? 
  ['Arafat] I wish all martyrs had been with me, led by my 
brother Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir] and Abu-Iyad [Salah Khalaf] 
  [Shirbil] When are you supposed to go to Gaza and Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] I am supposed to go there this month, February. 
  [Shirbil] When did you first know that the Soviet Union had 
ended and that you could no longer depend on it? 
  ['Arafat] During a meeting of the socialist countries in 
Berlin attended by Gorbachev. I and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni 
vice president and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party, were also sitting at the main table. I said to al-Bid: 
This is not the Soviet Union we knew. What is happening is 
completely different. 
  [Shirbil] What were the most difficult moments in your life, 
negotiating with enemies or with others? 
  ['Arafat] Was there any moment in my life that was not 
difficult? I live with difficulties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Habbuni and al-Shaykhi: Haftar </F>
Loses His Leadership Status in the Opposition Army"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The (opposition) National Front 
for the Salvation of Libya [NFSL] has issued a statement saying 
that its leadership met and studied the "statement issued by 15 
members (the day before yesterday) announcing their decision to 
leave the NFSL." It wished them all "every success in serving 
the national cause in the context of their new options." 
Meanwhile, Colonel Salih al-Habbuni, deputy commander in chief 
of the "Libyan National Army" [LNA] (the NFSL's military arm), 
and Lieutenant Colonel 'Abdallah Ahmad al-Shaykhi, that army's 
chief of operations, have issued a statement criticizing LNA 
Commander Colonel Khalifah Haftar, saying that he "has no right 
to speak on behalf of the LNA" and that his statement was full 
of "fabrications, prevarications, and false claims." They 
stressed that the LNA "is a part of the NFSL's institutions." 
  The day before yesterday 15 NFSL members announced that they 
were seceding from it. They included some leading members such 
as Burayk Suwaysi, Col. Haftar, 'Abd-al-Majid al-Saghir, 'Umar 
al-Fathali, and Yunis al-Fannush, and fund raisers such as 
al-Hajj al-Sabir Majid and Husayn Sufraki. In a separate 
detailed statement "in the name of the LNA's officers, warrant 
officers, and soldiers," Haftar announced his withdrawal from 
the NFSL and attacked its leadership "which has failed to rise 
to the level of the challenge." 
  Al-Habbuni and al-Shaykhi issued a statement yesterday in 
which they said: "The press carried (the day before yesterday) 
a statement in the name of Col. Haftar on behalf of the LNA's 
officers and soldiers making numerous claims and accusations 
against the NFSL's leadership and in conclusion announcing his 
withdrawal from the NFSL.... In view of the fabrications, 
prevarications, and false allegations contained in that 
statement, we have decided that it is our struggle duty as well 
as our military and moral duty to disclose a number of things to 
the public." 
  The statement added: "Col. Haftar has no right to speak on 
behalf of the LNA which is one of the NFSL's institutions 
founded by the joint will of all the officers, warrant officers, 
soldiers, and fedayeen and by a decision of the NFSL's Permanent 
Bureau on 21 June 1988." 
  It continued: "The characterizations and charges made by 
Haftar against the NFSL and its leadership are unjust, 
offensive, and unfounded.... By announcing his withdrawal from 
the NFSL, Col. Haftar has lost his leadership status in the LNA 
which represents the NFSL's armed forces and is one of its 
institutions." 
  In conclusion, the statement emphasized "pride in the NFSL, 
its role in the struggle, and its great and continuous efforts 
in manifestation of the national will seeking to overthrow the 
Libya regime and to replace it with a national, constitutional, 
and democratic alternative..., and pride in being a part of it 
and linked to its objectives, march, leadership, and legitimate 
institutions." 
  It should be recalled that that those who split from the 
NFSL 
had issued two internal memoranda last August and November, the 
first focusing on the need for internal reforms, criticizing the 
internal and external methods of work, and calling for a 
revision of the organizational frameworks. The second strongly 
criticized NFSL Secretary General Dr. Muhammad al-Muqaryif for 
claiming responsibility for the military mutiny which occurred 
in Bani-Walid in Libya last October as a result of which, it 
said, NFSL members at home were hunted down and arrested. 
  In December the NFSL's Permanent Bureau held a meeting 
attended by some of those who announced their secession the day 
before yesterday. It was agreed at that meeting that all the 
observerations, criticisms, and differences would be referred to 
the NFSL's National Council (the highest authority), which was 
due to convene in a matter of months, but the continuation of 
differences made it impossible to wait for that National 
Council's meeting and has led to the present state of affairs.

in Return for Aozou Strip"] 
  [Excerpts] London, AL-HAYAH -- A Chadian diplomatic source 
in Tripoli has confirmed that Libya is asking Chad to hand over 
500 Libyan POW's, who are now in the United States, in return 
for the Aozou strip. Meanwhile, the opposition's National Front 
for the Salvation of Libya [NFSL], which these POW's 
subsequently joined, has decided to appoint Colonel Salih 
Muhammad al-Habbuni commander in chief of the Libyan National 
Army [LNA] (the NFSL's military arm) in place of Colonel 
Khalifah Haftar. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday the NFSL leadership issued a statement saying it 
had decided to appoint al-Habbuni commander in chief of the 
opposition army and Staff Lieutenant Colonel 'Abdallah 
al-Shaykhi deputy commander in chief. The statement said that 
the army represented the "NFSL's armed forces and was 
established by a decision of the Permanent Bureau 21 June 1988 
after a large number of Libyan senior officers, warrant 
officers, and soldiers deployed in Chad announced that they were 
joining the NFSL." The statement also said that "Col. Haftar 
had held the post of commander in chief of that army by a 
decision of the NFSL's Executive Committee, until he announced 
his withdrawal from the NFSL" on 11 February 1994.

  [Text] Taba, 15 Feb (MENA)--Hasan 'Asfur, deputy head of 
the Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli Security 
Committee, has stated that the two sides have narrowed the gap 
in their viewpoints and are now close to reaching an agreement 
on the Palestinian Police Force. He said he hoped such an 
agreement would be signed in the next 24 hours. 
  Following two rounds of talks in Taba today, 'Asfur said the 
differences between the two delegations concern numbers more 
than principles. They are differences about the size of the 
police force and the type of weapons. He stressed that these 
differences are not substantial. He added: We will continue to 
discuss these issues and we hope we will reach agreement in the 
next 24 hours. 
  'Asfur said that a timetable for the gradual release of 
Palestinian detainees is expected to be discussed this evening. 
  General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation, said 
the talks have made progress. He hinted that an agreement might 
be signed by the end of the week and added: I believe we can 
give details in this regard by the end of the week. [passage 
omitted] 
  'Asfur said the arming of the Palestinian police force is 
still under discussion. He added that the Israeli side has 
agreed in principle for the Palestinian police to use armored 
cars, noting that the number of these vehicles and armored 
personnel carriers is currently being discussed with the Israeli 
delegation. 
  He pointed out that the current controversy over the size of 
the Palestinian police force is whether the number should be 
10,000 or 6,000. He said there is a possibility of resolving 
this issue, which is primarily technical. 
  He said that the issue of joint patrols will be discussed 
within the Joint Coordination and Cooperation Committee as of 
tomorrow morning, Wednesday. He added that the Palestinian 
delegation requested the institution of coastal guard patrols, 
noting that the Israeli side does not object to this in 
principle. He added that the dispute is over the number of the 
patrol members and stressed the need for Palestinian police on 
the Mediterranean coast. 
  'Asfur, deputy head of the Palestinian side of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Security Committee, said the Palestinian 
detainees in the Golan and in Israeli prisons will be discussed 
this evening. He expressed his hope that all issues concerning 
the release of Palestinian detainees according to a clear 
timetable will be addressed. 
  He added: We already have an Israeli stand [mawqif] on the 
release of the detainees. He affirmed the need to reach 
agreement on a timetable for the release of all detainees by 
July, in time for the Palestinian council elections due that 
month. 
  He pointed out that the Palestinian side had previously 
proposed a complete timetable for the detainees' release in 
groups, on condition that all the detainees, who number over 
9,000, be freed without exception. He stressed the need to free 
all the detainees, including those arrested after the signing of 
the Palestinian-Israeli accord on 13 September. 
  It is noteworthy that the Palestinian side demands that 
there 
be 9,000 in the Palestinian police force. It also demands that 
this force be divided up after civilian authority is transferred 
to the Palestinians into a police unit belonging to the 
Palestinian Public Security Department--a unit that will provide 
security for personnel and property--plus a national security 
force to be stationed on the borders with Israel, and a 
Palestinian civil defense unit that will include first aid, fire 
department, and rescue squads.

  [Text] Taba, 15 Feb (MENA)--The head of the Palestinian 
negotiating delegation, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, said the Palestinian 
and Israeli delegations are working continuously, positively, 
and successfully but are not ready to announce agreement on the 
Palestinian police force. He added that the delegation reached 
agreement on joint security coordination and cooperation. 
  In statements to journalists at the conclusion of the second 
day of negotiations in the current round of talks in Taba, he 
announced that the two sides revised a draft joint agreement 
based on Palestinian and Israeli draft papers and that the joint 
draft had been sent to the leadership in Jerusalem and Tunis. 
  Sha'th affirmed that genuine progress was made in the past 
two days of talks but denied that the two sides would sign an 
agreement tomorrow or in the next hours. He noted that they 
achieved great progress. 
  He said: The talks are progressing continuously but nothing 
more; in other words, there are no problems blocking agreement. 
He added: At the same time, we have not reached the stage of 
making the pleasant announcement that all our difficulties are 
now behind us. 
  He explained that the two sides are awaiting answers from 
their leadership and that a spirit of optimism prevails over the 
negotiations on the Palestinian and the Israeli side. 
  He noted that work has been completed on security 
cooperation 
and coordination between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. He 
remarked that numerous issues remain unresolved, such as 
security measures on land, at sea, and on coasts as well as a 
timetable for a phased Israeli withdrawal on specific dates. He 
said that these issues include the transfer of civilian 
authority that must be concluded and a (?general amnesty) for 
the Palestinian detainees. He affirmed that if things proceed 
the way they did today, these issues will not take much time. 
  He said the Palestinian and Israeli delegations, through the 
Security Affairs Committee, held a preliminary discussion of the 
Palestinian detainees issue and that a meeting will be held 
tomorrow morning between General (Admon Ahjon) and Muhammad 
Ramlan to continue the discussion. He affirmed the importance 
of a timetable to release the detainees, which should include in 
principle all those who contributed to the struggle against 
occupation. 
  He said: We reached agreement to halt violence between the 
two sides. A general amnesty should cover both the Palestinians 
and Israelis. He noted that there are also Israeli soldiers who 
have been punished for acts of murder they committed without 
permission from the Israeli authorities and who were imprisoned. 
They too must be freed, he remarked. He explained that the 
general amnesty must cover all those who participated in 
violence. 
  He said that most Palestinian detainees are those who took 
part in the intifadah and stressed that the timetable for their 
release should not go beyond 13 July. 
  Sha'th denied that cooperation and coordination between the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides will be at the expense of the 
Hamas Movement. He said this kind of talk destroys confidence 
and that we need a country where we can spread peace among the 
people of the same homeland and the enemies of yesterday. He 
added that you cannot make peace with the enemies of yesterday 
only to establish animosity with the brothers of today and 
tomorrow. 
  Negotiations between the two sides are scheduled to resume 
tomorrow, Wednesday.

  [Text] Taba, 16 Feb (MENA)-- The Security and Civilian 
Affairs Committees for the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to 
implement the Gaza-Jericho agreement resumed meetings in Taba 
today in an atmosphere of optimism among members of both 
delegations. 
  General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff and chairman of 
the Israeli delegation to the talks, has stated that the two 
sides are discussing the items on the agenda to reach an 
integrated agreement on the various issues pertaining to the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  After arriving in Taba this morning, Shahaq said that no 
agreement will be signed regarding the Palestinian police force 
but an exhaustive agreement will be signed once negotiations are 
concluded. 
  MENA has learned that the Civilian Affairs Committee has 
been 
divided into two subcommittees. The basic committee is 
cochaired by the lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi and General Gadi Zohar, 
the official in charge of the civilian administration in the 
West Bank. It is discussing the transfer of authority over 
electricity and civilian planning. 
  The subcommittee on communications is cochaired by Radwan 
Abu-'Ayyash, head of the Palestinian radio and television 
authority, and Shlomo Fax, head of the Israeli 
telecommunications authority [name and title as received]. This 
subcommittee is discussing all the issues pertaining to the 
establishment of a Palestinian radio and television, radio and 
television research, telephone communications, and an 
international code number for the future Palestinian telephone 
exchange authority. 
  The Security Committee has held a meeting in the residence 
of 
the Palestinian delegation cochaired by Nabil Sha'th, adviser to 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and General Amnon Shahaq. 
  MENA has learned that the two delegations are carrying their 
leaderships' reply to the joint draft reached last night on the 
Palestinian police force and on security cooperation and 
coordination. 
  At its meeting today, the committee will discuss the 
timetable for the release of all Palestinians jailed in Israeli 
prisons in accordance with the provisions of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement.

  [Text] In Washington the bilateral talks will resume this 
afternoon with discussions on economic issues. Representatives 
of the United States and Jordan will participate. At the same 
time negotiations between Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and 
the Palestinians will continue. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says in 
the meeting with Syria, Israeli delegation head Itamar 
Rabinovich requested that security arrangements on the Golan be 
discussed. However, the Syrians, as in the past, said 
discussions had to first focus on an Israeli withdrawal. 
  Israeli delegation head to the talks with Jordan, Elyaqim 
Rubinstein, says only after a peace accord is made between the 
two countries will the issue of refugees be discussed. 
Rubinstein said he believes the issue is too vast to be 
negotiated only between Israel and Jordan, but rather should be 
dealt with in the multilaterals. Rubinstein's comments were 
made in response to King Husayn's remarks on Monday [14 
February] that the problem of Palestinian refugees should be 
solved prior to her making peace with Israel. 
  In Taba the discussions on security and civilian issues 
continue today. Qol Yisra'el's special correspondent at the 
talks, Karmela Menashe, says Israel has agreed to the deployment 
of 6,000 Palestinian policemen in the autonomous areas, but 
Palestinians are insisting on 10,000. The mood remains 
optimistic, but cautious, as we hear in this comment made last 
night by the head of the Palestinian delegation, Nabil Sha'th: 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] I learned from experience that the 
less we talk about the substance the better is the chance of 
reaching an agreement. And unless there are problems -- if 
there are problems everybody will have to explain to the press 
that it's not his problems, but the other side's. But I don't 
see there is any problem. And maybe this time we will make this 
agreement. I hope we have made benefit from all the traveling 
we made before and the agreement in Cairo. It might have really 
improved the credibility of the two parties. So maybe there was 
some good that came out of this long touristic negotiating round 
between Davos and [word indistinct], between Versailles and 
Oslo, and finally Cairo. But we have come back where we 
started, and I hope that's where we will complete everything.

  [Text] Kathmandu, Feb 15 (AFP) -- Nepal's main political 
opposition party has appealed to King Birendra to call an 
emergency session of parliament in a bid to stall the prime 
minister's plans to dissolve the legislative body, a party 
source said Tuesday. 
  The Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist 
(NCP-UML) has appealed to the king in a letter signed by 25 
percent of its MPs. 
  Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala hopes his ruling Nepali 
Congress (NC) will win a comfortable majority if mid-term polls 
are held, an NC source said. 
  The NCP (UML) in its letter maintained that the monarch 
should not dissolve parliament more than two years before its 
term expires nor should he call for mid-term polls on the advice 
of the prime minister alone. 
  "We think sensitive national issues like the dissolution of 
parliament and calling of the mid-term polls should be publicly 
debated in parliament itself before Koirala advises the king," 
the communist source said. 
  The king in the meantime is believed to have asked Koirala 
if 
he enjoys support for his plan from his parliamentary party. 
  Koirala Tuesday held a meeting of NC MPs at his residence 
but 
more than 50 parliamentarians, who support party President 
Krishna Prasad Bhattarai and supreme leader of the NC Ganesh Man 
Singh, stayed away. 
  They will however, be attending at crucial meeting of the NC 
Central Working Committee (NCCWC) Wednesday at Singh's residence 
to decide the fate of the prime minister. 
  Pro-democracy students, NC MPs and party activists turned 
against Koirala after Bhattarai's defeat earlier this month in a 
by-election. 
  They blamed a statement by Koirala critical of Bhattarai for 
the polls defeat. 
  A source close to the Koirala camp said party MPs have 
suggested not holding mid-term polls and have called for unity 
between Singh, Bhattarai and Koirala, with the prime minister 
staying in office. 
  Political observers here said the king should oppose 
mid-term 
polls as elections would hamper his country's economy which has 
already suffered from devastating floods and landslides in July 
which killed more than 2,000 people.

  [Text] Amman, AKHIR KHABAR -- The Libyan ambassador in 
Amman has denied Libya had any connection with the killing of 
the diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah. 
  The ambassador told AKHIR KHABAR that Libyan-Jordanian 
relations are extremely good. He said there is a plot that is 
intended to harm Libyan-Jordanian ties, saying that the plot 
that is being hatched is bigger than the Arab people. He said 
colonialist nations seek to create problems and sow discord in 
order to preoccupy the Arab people with bilateral and trilateral 
problems, in order to peddle their solutions and policies in the 
region. 
  Answering a question about any official contacts between the 
Libyans and the Jordanian Government, the ambassador said: The 
Jordanian Government knows the truth. There is no need for any 
contacts. It is difficult to discuss denial and confirmation 
between brothers. 
  Regarding the party that leaked the information to AFP, the 
ambassador said: We do not know who is behind this. But 
imagine that the United States has recently said that Libya is 
conspiring against its security. Who would believe that? 
Imagine a Third World nation conspiring against the security of 
a superpower? 
  The ambassador concluded: Reason must prevail in this 
region. The United States and the colonialist countries should 
know that we are not little children anymore. We should analyze 
things. Dialogue is not a bad approach.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA)--An official security source at 
the Interior Ministry has stated that a primitive device placed 
outside one of the International Kuwaiti Alexandria Bank windows 
in Suriya Street in al-Jizah went off at 2015 today. The 
explosion shattered the window and the windshields of two cars 
parked opposite it; there was no other damage or casualties. 
  The security source said the device was primitively made and 
was similar to those made by children to make popping sounds. 
The source added that this proves that the act was only meant 
to attract media attention, which remnants of the deviants are 
trying hard to do to show that they still exist. 
  The source said that the security services are warning the 
deviants that they will face a strong and decisive 
confrontation. The security services will not hesitate to 
confront these attempts decisively. At the same time, the 
source said, all security services sense the people's confidence 
that the police will put an end to these petty criminal 
attempts, which show how weak the deviant terrorist groups are. 
  The security source said that Egypt's nationalist forces 
stand behind the security forces, defending by all means the 
culture and history of the nation. They will never allow a 
stray criminal group to sabotage the homeland.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, today 
refuted a statement attributed to her and said during her 
interview with BBC, she was making comparison between the 
situation in Indian-held Kashmir and the Indian Punjab. In an 
informal talk with newsmen in Islamabad today, the prime 
minister said what she had told BBC was that Kashmir was a 
disputed territory and if Pakistan had not interfered in India's 
internal affairs when it was facing problems in east Punjab, 
then how could it do so now. India, the prime minister said, is 
trying to mislead its own people and the international community 
by putting the blame on Pakistan for the situation in held 
Kashmir. Pakistan's policy of noninterference in the internal 
affairs of its neighbors, she added, proves Pakistan's respect 
for international law. Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto said 
India has launched a propaganda campaign that Pakistan is 
fanning trouble in occupied Kashmir. She said the indigenous 
movement in occupied Kashmir is being nurtured by the Kashmiris 
themselves and it is their spirit to render every sacrifice for 
their right of self-determination. She said Indian allegations 
were false and baseless and Pakistan has exposed Indian human 
rights violations in held Kashmir. 
  The prime minister regretted that the opposition tried to 
distort her every statement, but it would not deter her from 
serving the country. She urged the leader of the opposition to 
give up the negative attitude and work for promotion of 
consensus on national issues. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the 
government and opposition may have political differences, but 
there should be consensus on issues of national importance. The 
prime minister said it was during Nawaz Sharif's tenure that 
Pakistan was blamed for terrorism despite the fact that India 
itself was indulging in human rights violations in held Kashmir.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today appeared before 
the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Rabin said 
he did not believe that the government's policy in the political 
process was leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. 
Our Knesset affairs correspondent Tamar Asalem reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Asalem] Strident tones were heard at 
today's meeting of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee. For the first time, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
presented the agreed upon map of the Gaza Strip, with the main 
roads clearly marked out, to the committee members. Knesset 
Member [MK] Beni Begin complained that although he had asked to 
see the map at an earlier date, his request was been turned 
down. MK Begin asserted that if Nabil Sha'th could view the 
map, the committee members should at least have the same right. 
This is the map that was signed in Cairo, the prime minister 
explained. Rabin nevertheless said he believed that the 
Palestinians would still make an attempt to change several 
details. I do not feel that what we are doing must necessarily 
lead to a Palestinian state, Rabin said. We are trying to let 
the Palestinians run their own lives without harming the 
security of the Israeli settlements. 
  As for Syria, Rabin said that all Israel's attempts to 
launch 
either public or secret talks had been rejected. The Syrians 
must demonstrate their desire and readiness to reach an 
agreement. 
  [Rabin] Syria's leadership is not doing what is necessary in 
order to demonstrate its sincere desire for peace to the Israeli 
public. I do not expect al-Asad to be as daring as the late 
Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat who visited Jerusalem; 
however, there are still many ways that the Syrian Government 
can show its desire for peace. 
  [Asalem] Rabin nevertheless added that he had reason to 
believe that once an agreement was reached with the Syrians, it 
would be signed independently of the negotiations with the 
Palestinians or Jordanians. I will not divulge the reasons for 
my assessment, Rabin said. Against the background of the talks 
which are resuming today, the prime minister reviewed 
developments on the various negotiating tracks. 
  [Rabin] As for Jordan, I believe there are practical issues 
on which we can make progress with the Jordanians, and I am sure 
that the fact that we sent water and environmental experts 
indicates that there are areas in which we can make progress. 
With Syria we shall wait and see. We can of course exchange 
views with the Lebanese, but I find it hard to believe that 
Lebanon will move forward without Syria. 
  [Asalem] The prime minister also addressed the recent spate 
of terrorist attacks. He reiterated that Israel would continue 
to wage a ruthless war against the perpetrators of terrorist 
attacks while continuing to negotiate with those elements that 
had abandoned terrorism. As for the release of Palestinian 
prisoners, Rabin said that such a step would be implemented in 
accordance with yet to be defined categories and would be linked 
to progress in the negotiations. All previous defense ministers 
made goodwill gestures on national holidays, Rabin said, noting 
that he did not remember any holiday when prisoners were not 
released as a goodwill gesture. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 15 February 
reports that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said today that if 
the PLO attempts to conduct an independent foreign policy, he 
would regard this a violation of the agreement with Israel just 
as he would if the PLO announced the establishment of a 
Palestinian state. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that 
Rabin made the remark in an appearance before the Knesset 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 
  ["Upon emerging from the session, the prime minister said 
that Syria is not even trying to show the Israeli public that it 
is interested in peace. According to him, the Israeli public 
would have considered it a sign of a Syrian desire for peace had 
Damascus accepted the request of Knesset Member Darawshah to 
head a delegation of Israeli Arabs who wished to convey their 
condolences to the Syrian president over the death of his son. 
  ["Our correspondent notes that during the committee session 
there were sharp verbal exchanges between the Likud members and 
the prime minister over the affair of the settlements of Dugit 
and Netzarim."] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 15 February 
further cites Rabin as telling the Knesset committee that "those 
wishing to leave Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip and return 
to live within the boundaries of the State of Israel will not 
receive any compensation because the government is not 
interested in encouraging them to leave. Our correspondent 
Yo'el Nir reports that the prime minister noted that recently, 
some 110 million shekels had been allocated for defense measures 
for the Jewish settlements in Judaea and Samaria."]

<F P=106> [Report by Ghunaym Muhammad al-Mutayri: "Inclination in </F>
Kuwait To Reshuffle Cabinet; Denial of Speculations About 
Government Resignation"] 
  [Excerpt] Kuwait -- Dr. Ya'qub Hayati, member of the 
Kuwaiti National Assembly Legislation and Legal Committee, has 
confirmed that there is an inclination to change some 
ministerial posts, including some ministers who are National 
Assembly members and others appointed by the prime minister. He 
added that these changes comes in response to requests submitted 
by a number of ministers recently. They asked to be relieved of 
their ministerial responsibilities. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he pointed out that 
these requests have not been accepted because the country is 
going through a critical phase requiring complete cooperation 
among its members to return the situation to what it was before 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
  He said that the picture has not yet become clear with 
regard 
to the ministers who are going to move to other posts inside the 
government. He stressed that the change will not include the 
Interior, Information, and Foreign Ministries. 
  Dr. Hayati said that "some ministers have not kept pace with 
the aspirations of the government, the people, and the National 
Assembly, thus new faces are needed -- faces capable of making 
decisions to reinforce the Kuwaiti citizens' confidence in the 
government." 
  However, Deputy Ahmad Baqir, secretary of the National 
Assembly, has denied recent media reports about a cabinet 
reshuffle. He told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that this is "absolutely 
baseless." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri has affirmed that real preparedness to confront 
developments in the region lies in two basic fields. The first 
is to strengthen and fortify our internal front using all the 
elements needed to destroy divisions among Lebanese. The second 
is to build the establishments of the state in the vital and 
industrial fields and try to develop and confront the 
requirements of the coming stage. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri's speech came during a seminar held 
in Juniyah yesterday evening. Answering questions from people 
attending the seminar, the prime minister said he supports the 
implementation of al-Ta'if, but the Syrian forces will be 
staying for the time being because they are helping the Lebanese 
security forces preserve internal security. He stressed that 
Lebanon came to the negotiations with Syria and will leave them 
when Syria does. [passage omitted] 
  On relations among the three leaders, the prime minister 
said: We do not differ over the essence, but over the form. 
Differences are natural in a democratic system. On the absence 
of balance in national decision-making due to the absence of 
Christian representation, al-Hariri said the Chamber of Deputies 
was elected within an election law. The current government is 
not responsible for the elections that have already taken place. 
He affirmed that when the time comes to hold new parliamentary 
elections, which will not be soon, then we can rectify the 
representation proportions.

Bureau, has said: Our adherence to basic national and pan-Arab 
values and principles has safeguarded Iraq, despite the 
ferocious, large-scale brutal aggression and the continued 
unjust embargo. 
  In a meeting today with a delegation from the Yemeni 
Revolutionary Democratic Party, led by Muhammad al-Dughaysh, the 
party's secretary general, Tariq 'Aziz added: Our conflict with 
imperialism and Zionism is a a long cultural conflict. It will 
inevitably end in victory for the forces of freedom, justice, 
and progress. 
  Al-Dughaysh praised the Iraqi people's steadfastness, 
courage 
and cohesion behind their leader, President Saddam Husayn, in 
the face of the aggressors. He praised Iraq's reconstruction of 
what had been destroyed by the sinful aggression. 
  The two officials discussed relations between the two 
parties 
and ways of promoting them to serve common Arab objectives.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih affirmed 
the Sudanese Government's eagerness to achieve a peaceful 
solution to the southern problem. He stated that the government 
supports a ceasefire, provided that it is not used by the outlaw 
troops as camouflage for launching military offensives and 
subsequently hampering the peace endeavors. 
  Addressing the regular weekly forum of the Foreign Ministry 
yesterday, Dr. Abu-Salih said that many messages and statements 
recently had been issued by French, American, and UN 
personalities in relation to battles taking place in the south, 
noting that these messages and statements espoused that the 
Sudan Government was determined to end the southern question 
militarily. The foreign minister said that the miscarriage of 
the round of peace talks in Abuja two days ago was due to the 
interference of western circles, which are against the 
achievement of peace in Sudan. Dr. Abu-Salih described 
allegations of miltiary offensives by the government on 
civilians in the south as completely false and baseless. He 
added that John Garang and his companions are using civilians as 
human shields, referring to the outlaws' determination to keep 
ammunition stores and military at [words indistinct] and more 
civilian areas. Dr. Abu-Salih reiterated the government's 
commitment to cooperate with regard to delivering relief 
materials to war-affected citizens through Operation Lifeline, 
Sudan.

<F P=106> [From the "Brothers" page] </F>
  [Text] Kosti, Sudan--The "Brothers" [al-Ashiqqa'] page has 
exclusively obtained the text of the speech delivered by Ibrahim 
al-Sanusi, one of the leaders of the military wing of the 
Islamic Front, to the popular defense battalions in Kosti, a 
town on the White Nile. In his address to these forces, 
al-Sanusi unleashed a scathing attack on the so-called global 
arrogant forces and their Arab and African satellites. 
  One of the Islamic Front militia recruits asked whether the 
Islamic regime can stand fast to the end in the face of the 
blockade and its harmful effects on society. The recruit said 
society is not yet sufficiently conditioned culturally to 
prevent an all-out popular rebellion, which the opposition 
forces might exploit to overthrow the regime. Ibrahim al-Sanusi 
answered: We know very well the strength of the Sudanese 
opposition and the limits of its strength. In the first days of 
the "revolution," we offered them samples of the "Islamic" 
state's methods of dealing with the opponents of the Islamic 
regime. We hit them hard while we were strong! We then opened 
the borders to them. They left and became isolated from the 
society that we are now restructuring according to our Islamic 
concept. We have not failed in this objective. But we are 
surprised by a "handful of agents" who are hitting us inside our 
borders through various forms of conspiracy that threaten to 
open the door wide to apostasy!! 
  Al-Sanusi added: If the worst happens, as the brother who 
asked the question warned, it will come as no surprise to us. 
We have prepared ourselves and have the ability to fire in all 
arenas. If the signs of this apostasy begin to appear on our 
land, they must consider their ambassadors and nationals as our 
"hostages" while we consider that all our brothers residing in 
their countries are offering sacrifices to God. These brothers 
know they were born for this purpose, that is, either to be 
God's servants or strugglers. 
  This speech, which was printed and distributed by the 
culture 
and information branch of the popular defense command, has 
provoked sharp controversy and a crisis between the security 
departments and the military intelligence department over 
whether this speech should be withdrawn and the videotape 
destroyed. The political command was asked to intervene to 
implement the decision. Minister of Presidential Affairs Ghazi 
Salah-al-Din intervened and insisted on keeping this speech in 
the archives of al-Jihad, belittling the possibility of foreign 
reaction in the event that it is leaked out. In a telephone 
conversation with the director of military intelligence, 
Salah-al-Din said: Let them withdraw their nationals and 
ambassadors. Have they left any relations requiring the 
presence of these ambassadors and nationals?

  [Text] In their (?focal) efforts to destabilize the 
tranquillity in the Sudan, the British House of Commons is 
holding a meeting today with the so-called Sudanese opposition 
groups approved in the rebel factions. The meeting was called 
by Christian Solidarity, at their national agency in London, 
under the auspices of Baroness Cox. The theme of the meeting is 
to unite all Sudanese opposition abroad, with the aim of 
overthrowing the legitimate government of the transitional 
revolution in the Sudan. The organizers of the meeting have 
rejected the participation of neutral Sudanese and Islamic 
institutions in the meetings, which are being kept secret. In a 
separate development, reliable sources disclosed that a meeting 
of rebel factions earlier had taken place in London, under the 
patronage of the anti-Islam christian association.

  [Text] Taba, Egypt, Feb 16 (AFP)--PLO and Israeli 
negotiators worked here Wednesday [16 February] to draw up a 
timetable for the release of Palestinian prisoners after making 
headway on plans for Gaza and Jericho to have their own police 
force. 
  The chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'th said he was 
optimistic that an overall accord on the implementation of the 
September 13 autonomy accord was within sight. 
  "If the negotiations go on at the same rhythm as the last 
two 
days, we will not take long," he said. 
  On the third day of negotiations in Egypt's Red Sea resort 
of 
Taba, his Israeli counterpart General Amnon Shahaq said: "The 
paper on the police is almost completed. There are some things 
that can wait a few more days." 
  Israel and the PLO drafted two documents on Tuesday, one on 
the size and strength of the force and the other on coordination 
with the Israeli army, Sha'th told reporters. 
  However, differences remain over "how large the force should 
be and how many weapons it should have," said Hasan 'Asfur, 
another PLO negotiator. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organisation wants a force of 9,000 
police for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank district of Jericho, 
while Israel has set a ceiling of 6,000. 
  Israel's Police Minister Moshe Shahal said the Palestinians 
would be allowed to use the same light weapons and armoured cars 
as their Israeli counterparts, but a request for tanks was 
rejected. 
  The PLO also wants speed boats to patrol parts of the 
Mediterranean coast. 
  The negotiators turned Wednesday to the key issue of 
prisoners, with the Palestinians seeking the phased release of 
all 11,000 detainees within four or five months. 
  Colonel David Agmon, an adviser on the intifada to the 
Israeli army command, and Palestinian deportee Muhammad Dahlan 
headed the sub-committee in charge of drawing up a timetable for 
the releases. 
  Israel has said it would not pardon Palestinians who carried 
out attacks since the autonomy accord was signed in Washington. 
  A separate timetable is under discussion for the withdrawal 
of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho, the launch of which is 
already two months behind schedule because of a deadlock on 
security issues. 
  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on 
Peres finally signed a security agreement last week in Cairo. 
Economic talks are to resume next Monday in Paris. A committee 
on the hand-over of civilian powers also met Wednesday to hammer 
out deals on electricity, archaeology and communications, 
including the launch of Palestinian television and radio 
stations. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin insists his country 
will 
take as much time as necessary for a detailed, overall agreement 
on autonomy. 
  In Washington, the wider Middle East peace talks resumed on 
Tuesday with the heads of Israeli, Palestinian, Jordanian, 
Syrian and Lebanese delegations meeting away from the cameras 
after a two-week break. 
  The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations were focused on 
elections in the self-rule areas set for July. 
  US State Department officials said privately that Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher was planning to return to the Middle 
East in late March to try and advance the Israeli-Syrian track 
of the peace process.

<F P=106> [Interview with Khalid al-Qidrah, member of the Palestinian </F>
negotiating delegation and the Civilian Affairs Committee, by 
reporter Iyal 'Alima in Taba on 16 February; from the "With the 
Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Qidrah] I believe that we are now in the final 
stages. The process of formulation will begin as soon as 
possible and will be followed by signature and implementation. 
I also believe that this will take place within a few weeks, or 
rather in some days before the end of this month. What is 
important, however, is that there is a real breakthrough, 
seriousness, and a desire for quick accomplishment in order to 
implement the Declaration of Principles as soon as possible. I 
do not believe that there are significant problems on any topic 
now. 
  ['Alima] Mr. Khalid al-Qidrah, member of the Palestinian 
delegation and the Civilian Affairs Committee: Apparently there 
is a breakthrough in some matters being discussed by this 
committee. Could you give us an idea in this regard? 
  [Al-Qidrah] In fact, the Civilian Affairs Committee began 
its work in this round of talks yesterday. Negotiations in all 
fields, even in the Security Committee, are proceeding in an 
intensive and serious manner and with a clear breakthrough and a 
real desire to achieve a full agreement in order to implement 
the Declaration of Principles as quickly as possible. 
  Yesterday and today, a review was made of all civil 
departments and issues which were not finalized in the previous 
rounds of negotiations. I believe that we have ended 
discussions on the public works department and electricity, and 
we are in the process of discussing the department of 
antiquities, population, and other issues. I also believe that 
these discussions will end because, as I said, work is taking 
place positively and with a desire to make an achievement and a 
breakthrough.

<F P=106> [Report by Cairo correspondent Smadar Peri] </F>
  [Text] Speaking to a special, closed session of the senior 
Egyptian military command, President Husni Mubarak said: "We 
are now moving toward full peace and normal relations with 
Israel." 
  The meeting took place at the beginning of the week. It is 
worth noting that the Egyptian regime relies on the military's 
support and President Mubarak is the supreme commander of the 
Egyptian Armed Forces. Emergency military law is still in 
effect in Egypt. 
  Mubarak told the forum of the supreme military command that 
he wanted to update them on his intention to encourage Egyptian 
business to cooperate in full with their Israeli counterparts, 
to permit Egyptian nationals to visit Israel, and to permit all 
forms of normal relations. 
  At the meeting, Mubarak stressed: "The era of cold peace is 
over -- we are moving toward full normalization." In the 
discussion with the senior army commanders, Mubarak brought 
Israel's impending natural gas deals as an example. "There is 
no reason," the Egyptian president said, "why Arab countries 
which do not have official relations with Israel (referring to 
Qatar) can sell it natural gas, while we have surpluses that we 
do not know what to do with. If we do not sell, these surpluses 
will be wasted." 
  Within the framework of changing Egypt's policy toward 
Israel 
and moving from a "cold peace" to a "full peace," Mubarak met 
with Egyptian newspaper editors several days ago in order to 
explain the shift in Egypt's position. This meeting led to two 
editorials -- published simultaneously in AL-AHRAM and 
AL-'AKHBAR, Cairo's official newspapers -- about the "new 
honeymoon." 
  It has been learned that Egypt is preparing to open an 
Egyptian academic center in Israel and an AL-AHRAM office in Tel 
Aviv.

<F P=106> [Interview with Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, official </F>
spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood group in Egypt, by 
unidentified correspondent in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] The Egyptian leadership has 
called for a national dialogue among political parties. How do 
you view this call, and do you expect this dialogue to succeed 
in resolving the issues currently raised on the scene? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] The picture is not yet clear, nor are the 
features of that call or the truth or nature of that dialogue. 
At any rate, the success of such a dialogue depends primarily 
on those participating in it, the issues included on its agenda, 
and the way it is run. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] What would be your opinion if the 
dialogue were held among the official political parties without 
the Muslim Brotherhood group? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] I do not believe that holding a dialogue in 
such a manner and ignoring an important group of the people can 
bring any benefit or succeed in discussing the issues included 
on the agenda. Anyhow, the start is not reassuring and is 
incompatible with the reform wish or the democratic spirit. 
Because for such a dialogue to succeed, all parties and 
tendencies without exception must be invited to it and 
participate in it. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Egypt and some Arab states are currently 
suffering from the growing violence and terrorism phenomenon. 
In your view, what are the causes of this phenomenon, 
especially as many victims have died as a result of it among the 
police and foreign tourists? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We condemn all forms of terrorism and violence. 
We have stated this position in the past. We said that violence 
and counterviolence would not solve the problem and that the 
problem must be tackled carefully, as agreed among the majority 
of writers and thinkers. 
  We reject political violence, whether it is committed by 
groups or the authorities. Our position on how this issue 
should be tackled and handled differs from the government's. We 
insist -- and writers and thinkers share our view -- on the need 
to tackle this phenomenon and its causes. There is no way or 
urgent solution to this crisis except through political reforms 
and the establishment of a true democratic system. That road 
would completely close the door to violence and terrorism. 
Because the most dangerous thing is escalation and 
confrontation. The general agreement among thinkers is that 
relying solely on the security method is not a good remedy for 
the problem, whether now or in the future. 
  We believe that terrorism is illegal, and we urge everyone 
to 
comply with the law and the Constitution. And I believe that 
the government should hasten to make comprehensive political and 
democratic reform. If any violence takes place after that, we 
can severely punish those who deviate from the consensus. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] How would you assess the agreement 
signed last month between the Vatican and Israel, and what is 
its effect on Arab rights and the status of Jerusalem and 
al-Aqsa Mosque? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] That agreement reflects and is the result of 
current international orientations and courses. It is the 
result of policies aimed against Muslims' interests. These 
policies are driven by the ambitions and aims of big powers 
aiming to bolster the Zionist entity's domination of the region 
and to provide it with all factors of power. At the same time 
these powers are opposing the Arab and Islamic will and 
tirelessly and actively working to obstruct its growth and 
progress. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you believe that the agreement is a 
Jewish-Christian alliance against Islam and Muslims? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] That agreement is part of an integrated policy 
aimed against our nation, religion, and region. These states 
have politically agreed to impose certain conditions and to 
enable the Zionist entity to take control of the region and to 
provide it with all factors of power. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] What is your assessment of the current 
negotiations between Israel and some Arab states to secure peace 
agreements to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict, especially as 
two years have elapsed since their launch? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] I believe that these negotiations will not 
change existing Zionist ambitions in the region. We believe 
that the Zionist entity is working to achieve its ambitions and 
aims sometimes by force, wars, and murder and at other times by 
deception in the name of the peace negotiations. These 
negotiations will not change its ambitions, aims, and schemes. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] The Islamic world is afflicted by a 
state of concern and sadness over the ongoing fighting in 
Afghanistan and the tragedy and massacres committed by some 
leaders. There is a struggle over power. How do you explain 
these incidents? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Without doubt conditions in Afghanistan have 
deteriorated badly, and we regret and are saddened by these 
conditions and believe that they completely contravene any 
thought, religion, or ethics. And the Afghan mojahedin must 
realize the danger of that and their damaged image, especially 
as they achieved victory against the occupation forces and the 
communist regime. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Some people believe that the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina tragedy and the savage massacres committed by 
the Serb criminals there are a reflection of the current 
international situation. They also hold the United Nations 
responsible for the continuation of this crime there. 
  [Al-Hudaybi] Without doubt, the United Nations is fully 
responsible for the tragedy and its continuation. It is a crime 
against humanity and in its name. 
  We believe that -- as usual -- the UN role has not changed. 
The United Nations with its so-called Security Council has 
become a tool in the hands of the big powers, especially the 
United States and the European states, to implement the policies 
and aims of these states. And without doubt, the United Nations 
is currently working for these states, hence it does not fulfill 
or express the interests of Muslims. The UN secretary general 
is merely an employee and a tool to implement these policies.

  [Text] Bucharest, Feb 16 (AFP)--A group of Romanian 
engineers who survived a gun attack are to quit southern Egypt 
after receiving threats from the main Muslim fundamentalist 
group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, the Foreign Ministry said 
Wednesday. 
  The 20 Romanians working for a cement factory are to move 
from the southern Asyut region to the northern city of 
Alexandria until the situation calms down, ministry spokesman 
Mircea Geoana [name as received] said. 
  The engineers were on board a bus that was hit by gunfire on 
Monday near Asyut. They were unhurt, but the next day they 
received threats from the al-Jama'ah saying the shooting was 
only a warning. 
  The Egyptian authorities and the Romanian Embassy in Cairo 
were studying ways of protecting the 200 Romanians working in 
"sensitive" parts of the country, Geoana added. 
  Al-Jama'ah has warned foreigners to leave the country in its 
violent campaign against the government, which has claimed more 
than 300 lives.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 16 (AFP)--AFP has rejected an Egyptian 
Interior Ministry accusation of bias in its coverage of attacks 
by Islamic militants. 
  The ministry had threatened AFP with legal action for not 
publishing the government's version of two incidents on 
Monday--an attack on a bus carrying Romanian engineers in south 
Egypt, and an explosion in a northern town. 
  The ministry summoned bureau chief David Daure on Tuesday 
who 
rejected accusations that AFP was giving a lopsided version of 
events in its coverage of the Muslim fundamentalist campaign 
against the government. 
  Officials accepted his comments and said they considered the 
matter closed. 
  The bus attack, which caused no injuries, was claimed by the 
underground al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah in a statement sent to AFP. 
  The ministry, in comments carried by AFP, said the attack 
was 
aimed at the bus company because it had recently laid off staff 
and thus had nothing to do with the campaign against foreigners. 
  In the explosion in the town of Tanta, which wounded seven 
people, police originally said it was caused by a bomb, but the 
ministry later said it was a leftover wartime shell, which AFP 
also reported. 
  Relations between the government and foreign press have been 
strained since fundamentalists launched a campaign two years ago 
which has killed 301 people. 
  The much-publicised campaign has frightened away foreign 
tourists, costing the government billions of dollars in lost 
revenue.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] As was reported and was foreseeable, a Saudi bid for 
the purchase of dozens of passenger planes was handed to the 
U.S. company, Boeing. Saudi Arabia announced some months ago 
that it intended to purchase 60 planes to complete its 
passenger-plane fleet. Thus, it began talks with the U.S. 
companies Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, as well as with the 
European Airbus Consortium. 
  Political analysts believe that handing this bid over to the 
United States is more for political rather than commercial 
reasons, and that various elements were involved in this 
decision. The agreement of U.S. arms manufacturers one month 
ago to accept installment repayments of the military loans of 
Saudi Arabia, which was unable to repay its debts because of the 
drop in oil prices, is one of the most important elements. 
Also, the U.S. aircraft-manufacturing companies offered more 
benefits than their European competitors in an effort to 
maintain their world markets, especially under current 
conditions when White House officials are trying to help the 
U.S. economy emerge from its recession by expanding foreign 
markets. 
  Bill Clinton's contacts with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia may 
have been the most important reason why the bid for the purchase 
of dozens of passenger planes went to an American company. This 
contact--especially during the newly commenced economic war 
between the United States and Japan--is of great significance. 
Even though economic sanctions on Tokyo, which Clinton has 
threatened, would deprive Japan from the large U.S. market, it 
would also limit U.S. access to the Japanese market; this has 
set a new priority for U.S. economic policy of expanding its 
international markets as much as possible.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Iran Invites Gulf States To </F>
Participate in `Security Alliance'"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iran yesterday 
invited the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] to join it to set up 
a security committee to ease the severity of the tension and 
prevent the eruption of new disputes in the region. 
  This invitation was made by Iranian Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary Mohammad Javad Zarif, who did not rule out that this 
committee could become a nucleus for a security alliance 
grouping all states situated on the Gulf. Well-informed sources 
have said that the Iranian invitation is addressed for the time 
being to the six GCC member states but could include Iraq later, 
specifically after its present problems are settled. 
  The Iranian official said that such a committee would enable 
the region's states to discuss all their problems and analyze 
the threats to their joint security. 
  Diplomats believe that the Iranian proposal is aimed at 
splitting the "Damascus Declaration," which includes the GCC 
states, Egypt, and Syria. 
  Iran proposed the idea in the past but the proposal 
collapsed 
because of the Iranian-Iraqi dispute. 
  Observers believe that this proposal may face the same fate 
as a result of the disputes between Iran and a number of states 
in the region, especially the United Arab Emirates, which claims 
sovereignty over three islands currently occupied by Iran.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani today received 
Professor (Andikhan), the special envoy of Pakistan's prime 
minister. The special envoy carries a written message from Mrs. 
Benazir Bhutto for our country's president. 
  In this meeting, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed concern 
over the present situation in Kashmir, and said: The Islamic 
Republic of Iran believes that the officials of Pakistan and 
India should act wisely and not allow the present situation in 
Kashmir to cause tension and insecurity in the region. This is 
because the continuation of tension and conflict in that region 
will not be in the interest of any party. 
  The president said: In their numerous negotiations with the 
officials of Pakistan and India, the Iranian officials have 
emphasized this important point during their discussions about 
ways to resolve the Kashmir problem. He added: The Islamic 
Republic of Iran is still ready to continue its efforts to help 
resolve the Kashmir problem with the aim of realizing the rights 
of the oppressed people of that region. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani then thanked the nation and the 
government of Pakistan, and said that strengthening of 
cooperation and friendship between the two neighboring countries 
was important for the region and the world. Moreover, he 
welcomed the further deepening of bilateral relations. 
  According to the Central News Unit's correspondent, at the 
beginning of this meeting, Pakistan's special envoy first 
conveyed the greetings of the nation and the government of 
Pakistan to the Iranian nation and government. He then said 
that the visits to Tehran and Islamabad by high-ranking 
delegations from both countries during the recent years were 
highly conducive to strengthening and consolidating bilateral 
cooperation amid a friendly and sincere atmosphere. He added: 
Millions of Pakistani Muslims have never forgotten the 
meaningful address of the Iranian president to the Pakistani 
parliament. They have etched those remarks in their heart. He 
added: The prime minister of Pakistan is also very happy about 
her recent visit to Tehran and the very positive outcome of her 
negotiations during the visit. 
  In addition, the special envoy of Pakistan presented a 
report 
about the status of the Muslim people of his country.

  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev left Turkey at the end of 
his four-day visit last Wednesday. The most important outcome 
of his visit was the signing of a defense agreement between 
Turkey and Azerbaijan. 
  Aliyev said that an agreement will also be signed on the 
laying of a pipeline between the two countries to transport 
Azerbaijan's oil to the Mediterranean Sea. President Suleyman 
Demirel responded by saying that Turkey will support Azerbaijan 
in its war with Armenia. However, he stressed that Turkey is 
not obliged to give direct military support to Azerbaijan within 
the framework of the defense agreement between the two countries. 
  It seems that the officials of the two sides are making an 
effort to reactivate relations between Baku and Ankara, which 
have been damaged by a chilled atmosphere for some time. It 
will be recalled that the ousting of former President Ebulfaz 
Elchibey, who was known to have close relations with Ankara, 
caused a significant setback in relations between the two 
countries. Meanwhile, Turkey's approach to the war between 
Azerbaijan and Armenia and its failure to give the necessary 
financial support to Baku at the time weakened relations between 
the two sides and caused dissatisfaction in Azerbaijan. 
  Undoubtedly, similar developments weakened diplomatic 
contacts between Baku and Ankara in 1993. Considering Ankara's 
long-standing Pan-Turkic approach and the strategic importance 
of the Caucasus, that state of affairs caused anxiety in the 
Western countries, which planned to influence the republics in 
the region through Turkey and the Turkish Government. 
Meanwhile, Moscow's disclosure that it regards Central Asia and 
the Caucasus as a security zone for Russia worried the Turkish 
Government. In view of that, Turkey made several initiatives to 
improve its relations with the Baku Government and dispel the 
dark clouds between the two countries. In fact, it made an 
effort to persuade Baku to maintain a policy in Ankara's favor 
by promising political and economic aid to Azerbaijan. 
  Several news agencies have reported that Ankara informed 
Baku 
a few hours before Aliyev arrived in Turkey that it will give a 
credit of $15 billion to the Azerbaijani Government, construct a 
center for foreign diplomats in Baku, and help Azerbaijan open 
diplomatic missions in foreign countries. 
  Meanwhile, Baku has planned to improve its relations with 
Ankara and use its close links to the Western countries to 
create a favorable atmosphere for the resolution of the dispute 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Nevertheless, several observers 
are convinced that Moscow can condone the improvement of 
relations between Ankara and Baku as long as they do not pose a 
threat to Russia's interests.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 16, IRNA -- A spokesman for the Atomic 
Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Ali Shirzadian, here 
Wednesday strongly denied the recent allegations by London-based 
Arabic daily 'AL-SHARQ-AL-OWSAT' on Tehran-Madrid nuclear 
cooperation for military purposes. 
  Interviewed by IRNA, Shirzadian stressed that Iran's nuclear 
program aims at peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and its 
activities are within the framework of the rules and regulations 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The daily which is simultaneously published in London and 
Beirut, in its Monday edition alleged that a Spanish nuclear 
firm is to provide Iran with necessary technology to transform 
its two nuclear installations for peaceful utilization of that 
energy into plants with military purposes. 
  The daily claimed that the Spanish company is to sell 
diversion technology to IRAN under a 80 million dlrs [dollars] 
contract signed by an Iranian nuclear delegation in Madrid last 
month. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear 
Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and has repeatedly announced its 
firm adherence to it. 
  The official noted that Iran has always proclaimed that its 
nuclear facilites are open to the IAEA and the agency's 
inspection teams have repeatedly confirmed that Iran's nuclear 
program is for peaceful purposes. 
  Despite the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
repeatedly rejected such wild reports, some segments of the 
western media are trying to portray Iran as a country which is 
in quest for nuclear arms, regretted Shirzadian. 
  In a separate statement today, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs also rejected rumours circulated by 'AL-SHRAQ-UL-OWSAT' 
daily accusing Iran of seeking nuclear weapons. 
  The statment dismissed as "baseless" the daily's allegations 
and called it part of the psychological war against Iran by the 
arrogant countries and the zionist regime. 
  Certain media often lauch such fabrications of Iran's 
cooperation with a third party, in a bid to poison world public 
opinion against Iran's peaceful nuclear program and the peaceful 
ends of its foreign policy and they want to undermine its 
friendly relations with Spain, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  On December 2, Iran's permanent representative at the United 
Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, announced at the general assembly 
meeting that Iran is firmly committed to the establishment of 
the Middle East as a nuclear free zone (NFZ).

<F P=106> [By Wafa' 'Amr in Tunis] </F>
  [Text] Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat accused the 
Israelis on Wednesday [16 February] of planning to spark a 
Palestinian civil war and to "turn the occupied territories into 
another Afghanistan" by facilitating arms trade. 
  Mr. 'Arafat expressed worry about arms pouring in the 
occupied territories and grave concern over the possible 
repetition of the "Afghan scenario" inside the occupied 
territories after Israeli troops pull out from the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho. 
  Contending that the Palestine Liberation Organisation's 
(PLO) 
takeover from Israel in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of 
Jericho will be fielded with mines, Mr. 'Arafat said Israel was 
trying to spill oil on fire by facilitating the purchase of arms 
by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, which have already 
been used against Palestinians to disrupt stability. 
  "There is a very terrible trade of arms going on under the 
auspices of some Israeli officers in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip, smuggling and trading," Mr. 'Arafat said in a joint 
interview with the JORDAN TIMES and the London-based GUARDIAN. 
  "In my opinion, this is being seriously and wickedly 
planned. 
They know that these weapons, while they are withdrawing, will 
not be used against them... then against whom will they be 
used?" Mr. 'Arafat asked in the interview conducted at his 
office here. 
  Leaning closer to a desk covered by huge stacks of files and 
papers, with a serious and worried look in his tired eyes, the 
PLO chairman, raising his voice to a pitch, asked: "Are they 
imagining there will be another Afghanistan amongst the 
Palestinians? This is a very dangerous game they are playing." 
  PLO officials have privately expressed fear of a civil war 
if 
Palestinians did not restrain themselves and continued to 
purchase arms and solve their political differences through 
violence. The PLO-Israeli accord signed in September has caused 
serious rifts among Palestinians. 
  Mr. 'Arafat was also challenged by his own Fatah group, the 
backbone of the PLO, which is also divided over the accord. 
Immediately after the accord, three Fatah leaders were 
assassinated in Gaza. As'ad Saftawi, Fatah leader in Gaza, 
assassinated in October, was 'Arafat's aide and personal friend. 
The assassinations, especially Saftawi's, alarmed Mr. 'Arafat 
and caused him great sorrow. He vowed to do his utmost to put 
an end to inter-Palestinian fighting. PLO officials believed 
Palestinians working as agents to the Israeli intelligence were 
behind the assassinations. The recent distribution of arms in 
the occupied territories, they fear, might lead Palestinians to 
settle political and personal disputes through bloodshed and 
violence. 
  "Some of these weapons have been used against stability in 
the occupied territories, and I have received many complaints 
from our citizens, from the masses against what is happening," 
Mr. 'Arafat said. 
  He said the arms "are falling into the hands of everybody 
(collaborators, Hamas, the PLO), they are being made available 
to everybody, and at different prices. The price is not 
important, it is the policy behind it that is dangerous." 
  The PLO leader said his organisation discovered the Israeli 
role in facilitating arms sales immediately after the signing of 
the September self-rule accord. "The sales have accelerated in 
recent weeks," he said. 
  Asked whether he was sure Israeli officers were actually 
involved in the affairs, he said firmly: "Do you think there is 
a mutiny among Israeli officers? This game is going on with 
their help, and this is not a joke." 
  The PLO chairman was obviously unhappy with what he sees as 
the passive role of the United States and the permanent members 
of the U.N. Security Council, particularly concerning this 
issue. He said he had officially informed them and the Israelis 
of the situation and cautioned them against the consequences. 
  Mr. 'Arafat dismissed the possibility that any Arab state 
opposing the self-rule accord would threaten his life or attempt 
to sabotage the deal, saying: "Only the Palestinans and the 
Israelis, the two partners who signed the agreement in 
Washington, can damage it." 
  He said Israel's policy of delaying implementation of the 
agreement "will sabotage the peace process and reflect 
negatively on the whole process. It will backfire 
dangerously... not only on Palestinians, but on the whole area 
because confusion is contagious and will spread throughout the 
region... it will lead to balkanisation as well." 
  "The Israeli government is not in a hurry to implement 
anything," he said. "We are late anyway because implementation 
of the agreement, the beginning of withdrawal should have been 
on Dec. 13." 
  According to the self-rule agreement, Israeli troops should 
have started withdrawing from Gaza Strip and Jericho on Dec. 13 
to be finalised on April 13. Disputes over security on border 
crossings between Jordan and Jericho and between Egypt and the 
Gaza Strip, as well as the size of Jericho and the area of 
Jewish settlements in Gaza Strip delayed implementation. The 
two sides succeeded in initialling a security agreement in Cairo 
on Feb. 9, but many issues remained unresolved. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said another month 
was needed to resolve pending issues. 
  "We have to remember what Rabin had said about having no 
sacred dates: How can this be accepted internationally, and 
from the American administration, and from U.S. President 
Clinton, since the agreement was signed under his auspices?" 
Mr. 'Arafat said. 
  "Especially the dates are the main part of the agreement. 
But until now, two months have passed and nothing has been 
implemented on the ground." 
  The 65-year-old PLO leader switched from Arabic to English 
when he spoke in a soft voice. His body rocked in his chair in 
a sign of nervousness. He sought help in English from two press 
advisers attending the interview. 
  "This is the first time I speak to the press after the Cairo 
agreement. Even in Cairo I did not speak about it," he said. 
  Fumbling with his files on his desk, he picked up a 
document, 
put on his looking glasses and started reading out the remaining 
"difficult issues and problems" which needed further 
negotiations in Cairo, Taba and in a meeting between him and Mr. 
Rabin before a final agreement. 
  "The Palestinian security forces and the police force are 
still one of the problems that still have to be settled. The 
size of Jericho area has not been settled. Other main issues 
concerning the security zone for the settlements in Gaza Strip." 
  "They (Israelis) are asking more than what they had asked 
before in the beginning they asked for 170 square kilometres in 
the Gaza Strip, half the area of the strip, and then 32 square 
kilometres and about 20 the zoning." [sentence as published] 
  He said Israelis had not given the Palestinians the size of 
the police force they want deployed in the self-rule areas after 
Israeli withdrawal. "But in developed countries it is known for 
the security forces and police force that for every 200 people 
there should be one policeman. In our case, especially that we 
are facing many problems, it should be one policeman for every 
hundred people, since we won't have an army to call in cases of 
emergency." 
  He added among the unresolved issues were the differences in 
security arrangements between the bridges over the Jordan River 
and Rafah entrances. 
  "There is no electronic line on the Egyptian-Palestinian 
border as it is now the case all along the Jordan River border. 
Between Jordan's border and the Palestinian territory at the 
other side of the river there is an electronic line with a depth 
between 2-3 kilometres... Israel wants to keep this electronic 
security line during the interim period." 
  Other details, he said, include the administration of the 
border crossings and security and liaison bureaus on crossings. 
"All these are still under discussion." 
  The 12-page detailed Cairo agreement included eight pages on 
border crossings' security arrangements. 
  Mr. 'Arafat said the most important thing about the Feb. 9 
Cairo accord was that "it was the first agreement for the 
implementation of the declaration of principles which we signed 
in Washington." 
  He described his three-day negotiations in Cairo with 
Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres as "very difficult." 
  The Cairo meeting was on the verge of failure even during 
the 
last minutes before the signing "because of Israeli insistence 
to adhere to certain conditions and certain demands, that is why 
it is clear that many issues in the agreement were left for 
further negotiations and agreement in Taba," he said. 
  "There were many surprises in Cairo, I don't want to enter 
into that again now." 
  Reflecting back on the Cairo meetings, the PLO chairman said 
"all the Israelis are very difficult in negotiations." 
  Refusing to assess his negotiating experience with both Mr. 
Rabin and Mr. Peres, he said: "I don't want to interfere. This 
is an Israeli internal affair and I have no right to speak about 
it. Peres was representing the Israeli government and was 
mandated by Rabin and the Israeli government, as he had 
mentioned to the Egyptians and to me before our arrival in 
Cairo." 
  However, Mr. 'Arafat said, since he founded Fatah in 1964 
with his companions, most of whom had been assassinated, "I have 
become used to difficult times. I don't remember any period of 
my life without difficulties... it is what I had chosen right 
from the beginning. I had no illusions."

  [Excerpt] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Meetings of the 
Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint Committee began at the 
Jordanian Foreign Ministry yesterday, five days after the 
meeting held between King Husayn of Jordan and Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat in Amman following the signing of the 
Cairo agreement between the PLO and Israel. 
  Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, arrived 
in Amman the day before yesterday evening at the head of a large 
official delegation to attend the joint committee's meetings. 
  Qaddumi told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday: The meetings 
between the Jordanian and Palestinian sides are the most 
important central link in our current political moves because 
they are linked to crucial issues. 
  He added: As for the complete agreement with Jordan, as far 
as I am concerned, it is more important than the Cairo agreement 
signed with Israel. Because progress in bilateral agreements 
with the brothers will produce other agreements until we reach a 
formula for organizing future relations in all spheres. 
  Qaddumi said: The meetings will deal with the agreements 
issue, the political agreement, and details of the economic 
agreement we signed in Amman last month, which includes banks, 
trade, workers, customs, individuals' movement, crossing points, 
and borders. Another committee, namely the Emigrants and 
Refugees Committee, will also convene. As is well known, it is 
a sensitive and important committee for the Jordanian brothers, 
and we will provide information and figures. 
  He stressed that with regard to the numbers and categories 
of 
emigrants and refugees, we will draw up a joint view in this 
connection in preparation for a tripartite meeting with Egypt 
and then a quadripartite meeting which will include Israel as 
well. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 16 (AFP)--The Commercial Bank of 
Palestine, the first all-Palestinian bank on the occupied West 
Bank, will begin trading on March 15 with capital of 14 million 
dollars, businessman Suhayl Jad'awn told AFP on Wednesday [16 
February]. 
  The headquarters will be in Ramallah, with branches in Gaza 
and Jericho to open once autonomy begins, said Jad'awn, one of a 
dozen Palestinian investors in the venture, which has Israeli 
approval. 
  The 38-year-old from Ramallah, who has just married PLO 
chairman Yasir 'Arafat's adopted daughter, said the bank has 
obtained a four-million-dollar loan from the French government 
for private sector industrial projects. 
  About 70 people will be employed by the Commercial Bank, 
most 
of whom have worked in Israeli establishments. 
  Until December last year, when the Israelis gave their 
blessing, only the Arab-Cairo Bank, a Jordanian body, was 
authorized to operate on the West Bank. 
  On the Gaza Strip, the Palestine Bank, set up by 
Palestinians 
in 1964 but closed in 1967, resumed operations in 1985. 
  Another new project, the International Palestine Bank, is 
underway with a 40-million-dollar investment put up by Israeli, 
Spanish and Moroccan banks and a group of Palestinians. 
  Last December, Israel and Jordan agreed that Jordanian banks 
which worked in the occupied territories before the 1967 Middle 
East war could resume trading.

  [Excerpts] Taba, 16 Feb (MENA)--Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, the 
head of the Palestinian radio and television authority, has said 
that Palestinian television faces three main obstacles while it 
is being established. 
  He told MENA that the first problem concerns the scope, 
power, and frequencies of transmission. A solution is left to 
the current negotiations in Taba, he said, hoping that positive 
results will be achieved in the talks. 
  The second problem, Abu-'Ayyash said, is securing the 
finance 
needed to put studies into practice. 
  He said the third problem is the financing of educational 
and 
other films and programs with which the television is scheduled 
to begin its transmission. [passage omitted] 
  Abu-'Ayyash said that many studios are being set up in the 
occupied territories. The Germans have begun building a radio 
studio for training, France will provide a television studio 
with a grant, and Britain will do the same, he said. 
  These donations, he explained, constitute what we call "the 
basis of Palestinian radio and television." 
  The Palestinian official said that many issues relating to 
radio and television transmission are being discussed in Taba 
within the work of the Civilian Affairs Committee. 
  Abu-'Ayyash said Israel understands the pressing need for 
Palestinian television. The translation of this understanding 
into something tangible is being discussed, he said. 
  On the budget of the Palestinian radio and television 
authority, Abu-'Ayyash said he conducted studies on establishing 
a modern television. The proposed budget, he said, ranges from 
$30-50 million. 
  He said donations from the European Union amounted to $6 
million. 
  He said he will make a Gulf tour after Ramadan to continue 
discussing donations with some Gulf states like Qatar and others. 
  Asked if radio and television transmission will be confined 
to Gaza and Jericho or will extend to all occupied Palestinian 
territories, Abu-'Ayyash said: When we discuss communications, 
we speak about the Palestinian people and Palestinians 
everywhere. Communications are not confined to Gaza and Jericho; 
we want to spread out throughout Palestine first, the world 
second. This is the aim of communications.

  [Text] Da'ud Talhami, member of the political bureau of 
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] and 
its principal spokesman, has stated the following: 
  The extensive negative reaction among various circles of the 
Palestinian people, inside and outside the occupied territories, 
to the Cairo agreement shows a broad popular and political 
dissociation from the administrative self-rule plan and its 
backers. It also shows the extent of popular resentment to the 
concessions that were made and to full compliance with Israel's 
"security" conditions and requirements. 
  While the Cairo agreement's content proves the veracity of 
the Palestinian democratic forces' analysis of the 
Oslo-Washington accord and its substance, represented in the 
redeployment of the occupation--not its withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho--it also clarifies the dimensions of the Oslo accord and 
the ensuing dangers for the future of the land, the cause, and 
Palestinian rights. Moreover, it removes all the wrapping from 
demagogic statements that have sought to present the accord in 
favorable light and convey the opposite of its content. 
  In return, this grave development in a series of retreats 
before Israeli conditions opens the way to expanding and 
organizing the popular movement opposed to the accord through 
the inclusion of new forces and figures in the ranks of this 
movement. After the announcement by some forces and 
personalities, especially the People's Party and Dr. Haydar 
'Abd-al-Shafi, of their opposition to the Cairo agreement, the 
DFLP's invitation to them to join the ranks of Palestinian 
democratic forces and the large national opposition force 
derives renewed credibility. This invitation aims at 
establishing the broadest alignment to defend Palestinian 
national rights and the future of the land, of Jerusalem, and of 
the people in the homeland and the diaspora. It also has to 
confront, isolate, and foil the Oslo-Cairo agreement in 
preparation for providing alternative conditions ensuring a 
comprehensive solution that responds to the resolutions of 
Palestinian, Arab, and international legitimacy.

  [Text] Brothers: The Palestinian arena is rife with 
fabricated defects and contradictions, as if those who paint 
these pictures of future disputes are trying to depict in 
advance the situation that will prevail in the territory from 
which the Israeli enemy will withdraw. 
  The Mosad has begun to assassinate nationalist symbols and 
strugglers in the occupied territories, just like the racist 
regime did in the South Africa by assassinating the struggler 
(?Hanker), and by sparking bloody confrontations that claimed 
the lives of thousands of blacks. 
  The same experience is being repeated on Palestinian 
territory. The occupation could not spark bloody disputes 
between the resistance factions, so it resorted to 
assassinations. Thus, Palestinian strugglers of all the 
revolution's factions were subjected to killing and detention, 
as happened in Gaza and the West Bank against the strugglers of 
Fatah, Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, 
and other factions. The Israeli occupation also aimed at 
creating chaos and lack of security on the eve of the supposed 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip and Jericho on 13 December. 
  However, when these attempts failed, it postponed withdrawal 
and started to maliciously sow disputes and provoke 
sensitivities, blowing them out of proportion. Some of us have 
fallen victim to this black propaganda. Also, international and 
hostile press contributed to the great exaggeration of 
Palestinian developments, thus predicting an imminent, 
devastating explosion in the territory from which the enemy will 
withdraw. Thus, this propaganda has robbed many people of their 
feelings of joy and created a black cloud of fear and anxiety 
hanging over their heads. This led to internal developments and 
nationalist and factional disputes, using the media and press as 
an arena to spread these unjustifiable differences. 
  The people's fears of a possible loss of security and safety 
were doubled. Thus, we heard more outcries and warnings of what 
is to come. Newspapers became full of articles, and the 
Palestinian leadership was severely criticized, without anything 
happening so far. 
  The awareness of the masses is required, so that the masses 
will get prepared for a national self-reconciliation after a 
long expatriation during the occupation. Also, the leadership 
cadres will prepare for this mission through their deep 
understanding of the nature of the next stage, which requires 
disciplined conduct, calmness, and a show of self-confidence and 
satisfaction with the future mission. This way the masses will 
be satisfied and feel safe and secure. 
  We are all aware that the Israeli occupation is [words 
indistinct] and caused us to starve and robbed us of the freedom 
of expression and speech. Its removal means the end of these 
diseases that spread because of the occupation on our 
Palestinian territory for many years. The removal of the 
occupation from part of our territory must restore us to our 
natural situation and prompt us to work seriously and freely to 
build a free Palestinian society in the future. 
  This assured conduct is a test of the awareness of the 
factions, cadres, and masses, which should not now run after 
authority, but after enhancing cooperation between everybody to 
launch reconstruction. This is because the authority has not 
yet come. The traces of occupation are still visible before our 
own eyes. We advise every policeman and security officer to be 
a faithful servant of the people's security and to safeguard 
their property and protect their freedom of expression. The 
masses, through the conduct of the policemen and the security, 
should remove from their heads the notion that those people are 
coming to impose a coercive order. They should know, right from 
the very beginning, that those people have come to maintain 
humanitarian relations between the people and to provide a 
suitable climate to help the masses return to their normal life, 
which they have been denied for a long time. Thus, the people 
will cooperate and start holding celebrations, meetings, 
seminars, set up social, cultural and economic institutions, and 
do everything that one does in a stable community. 
  This is the responsibility of every member of any faction, 
movement, or political party, because democracy cannot thrive, 
as an expression of human rights and freedom, unless all 
Palestinian organizations have good relations between each other 
and with the masses in general. The factions should not cause 
disputes, create chaos, or dig up the past that causes 
factional, family, or religious disputes. This will make every 
citizen feel that the liberated homeland is his to live in, in 
freedom, security, and stability. 
  We are now facing an experiment. The world is watching and 
will judge it by our good or bad performance and administration 
of the liberated territory. The reaction of the friendly world, 
or that which gives aid, will be good or bad in line with our 
good administration and the national relations that we weave 
between the citizens and the resistance factions in their 
relations between each other and their performance of national 
duties on the ground. 
  No community is free of social, political, or economic 
problems. However, advanced communities study these problems 
objectively and try to resolve them through collective work 
after identifying successful solutions. Rival groups steer 
clear of disputes and clashes and provoking regional problems so 
that the national authority agencies and the resistance factions 
can perform their duties satisfactorily without clashing with 
the masses and serve the masses' daily interests faithfully and 
honestly. 
  Our past hard experience has disheartened us. In spite of 
the many negative manifestations that have surfaced in 
Palestinian society, it would be better for us if we go back to 
what is part of our nature, in terms of national cohesion, 
collective action, and the care we give to serve the masses and 
offer them all they need during this transition period where an 
atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety prevails, an atmopshere the 
enemy seeks to spread throughout the entire Arab region. 
  The success of the Palestinian experiment is a success for 
the entire Arab region. The Palestinian cause is the core of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict, and its developments directly reflect on 
the Arab state of affairs. We should be a good example in the 
way we behave and perform when building our future society. 
  We recommend, as of now, the formation of voluntary groups 
for building in every walk of life. Let us also give women a 
major part in social and economic work. Women should learn in 
economic, social, and cultural institutions. We should also 
open for them training schools so that they become qualified to 
work, participate, and share. 
  Had there been groups in the camps and quarters to carry out 
a comprehensive survey of the people's needs and requirements, 
it would have been possible to expedite economic development. 
We also must teach young people, find jobs for them, and train 
them in all cultural, social, and economic fields. Let a school 
be opened every day so these young people can join to make our 
society one that is replete with qualified people who can build. 
As the saying goes: The voice of work is stronger than the 
vociferation of words. 
  We must take into consideration that this stage is a 
transition stage, during which we will notice some confusion 
between criticism and the freedom of speech, slander, and 
defamation; between chauvinism and mature political affiliation; 
and between those who are content with just raising national 
unity slogans and those who work to translate these slogan into 
facts. We also note that confusion will take place between what 
is possible, now, in the transition period and what is not, 
between the phased objectives and the general strategic 
objectives. 
  We do not have a magic wand that achieves for us all that we 
want. We must constantly struggle to realize small achievements 
which add up day after day and one year after the other. We 
must not search for positions now. We should resort to work, as 
it is what will lead us to the positions and locations that 
befit us. We are not now at the stage of dividing the bounty, 
as some who have little experience imagine. We now are in the 
process of taking stock of our capabilities, of developing them, 
and having them assume their practical tasks within the 
framework of an arduous struggle where means and methods will 
differ to attain our national objectives. 
  The enemy, with all the evil it represents, is still present 
among us with all the sufferings, the signs of backwardness, and 
social ills it has left behind. We should eliminate all these 
in time through our persistent work and our social and political 
maturity. We must not punish those who committed mistakes. We 
must seek to rehabilitate and redress them, and make them become 
good citizens. We also must nurture the spirit of cooperation 
among all the militant forces, without exception, and act as 
tutors and counsellors, forgive mistakes, and tackle them with 
peaceful means, devoid of hatred and rancor. The homeland is for 
all and all have participated in its liberation. Therefore, they 
should participate in building it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, </F>
chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council, by unidentified 
Voice of America reporter; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Ladies and gentlemen, it gives us 
pleasure to meet with His Excellency Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council in the 
Republic of Yemen. Your Excellency: Can we say that the 
distress is about to be removed, that the cloud is about to 
dissolve, and that the crisis is about to be resolved, now that 
there has been agreement on signing the pledge and accord 
document in Amman on Sunday [20 February]? 
  [Salih] Thank you very much. God willing, this cloud will 
dissolve. It has damaged Yemen's reputation on the 
international level and also on the level of the Arab family and 
the Yemeni homeland. God willing, this cloud will dissolve by 
signing the pledge and accord document in Amman, perhaps on 
Sunday. God willing, we will then address another concern: 
implementing the articles of this accord. These articles are 
not difficult; they are rather very simple indeed. This 
agreement was basically part of the government's policy 
statement on whose basis the government won the House of 
Representatives' vote of confidence. The only new thing in this 
accord is that the Political Forces Dialogue Committee signed 
it. One who follows up the government's political program, 
according to which it won the confidence, will find that most 
articles were already included in this accord. 
  [Reporter] Specialists say that unity does not require a 
search for points of convergence, but for differences in order 
to avoid them and fill the gaps in them. Is this what is 
actually taking place in the united Yemen? 
  [Salih] The unity was actually achieved. However, each 
crisis has its own negative and positive aspects. Thus, there 
is nothing new. The pledge and accord document has been 
finalized. We will move to the phase of implementing it. God 
willing, the Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, and 
other state organs and institutions will reunite. We believe 
that reuniting these institutions will end the crisis. However, 
if other state institutions do not reunite, the crisis will not 
indeed end. 
  [Reporter] It was reported that former Yemeni presidents and 
some Arab leaders will attend the signing ceremony in Amman. 
How true is this report? 
  [Salih] This issue concerns the hosting state, and does not 
concern us as Yemenis. This is because we will sign the pledge 
document outside Yemen, so this matter concerns the hosting 
state. 
  [Reporter] The world viewed Yemen with much admiration and 
appreciation for your democratic and unionist steps. Are there 
subsequent steps to enhance unity and democracy? 
  [Salih] I believe that the steps will involve implementing 
the pledge and accord document, enacting the constitution, 
benefiting from the crises that happened, and assessing the 
negative and positive aspects of our democratic experience. We 
will also do our best, within the framework of solidarity of the 
whole leadership, to tackle the repercussions of the crisis. In 
fact, the crisis has produced bad repercussions. 
  [Reporter] Do you plan to add a Constitutional amendment 
that would only allow two presidential terms for the president 
of the republic? 
  [Salih] Within the framework of the peaceful handling of 
authority and not monopolizing the authority -- and in order to 
give hope for anyone who aspires for leadership, and also to 
prevent coups and conspiracies -- I earlier announced that a 
president's tenure should be confined to only two terms. 
  [Reporter] Your Excellency the President: May I move to 
another issue, namely, Yemen's relationship with foreign 
countries? What is the nature of Yemen's relationship with the 
Gulf states? 
  [Salih] During a certain period of time, this relationship 
slowed down as a result of the Gulf crisis repercussions. 
Intensive and mutual efforts are being exerted with some 
brothers in the Gulf states to return matters to normal. 
Relations are now good with the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar, and 
the United Arab Emirates. Relations with Saudi Arabia are 
somewhat good, and are improving day after day. They are also 
good with Kuwait and Bahrain. In other words, there is a new 
start on returning matters to their previous situation. 
  [Reporter] Yemen has had known positions on the Palestine 
question. Does the recent agreement between 'Arafat and Peres 
on implementing the Gaza-Jericho First accord agree with your 
positions? 
  [Salih] In fact, we support the well-being of the 
Palestinian Arab people. We, however, were aspiring for 
something more than what was reached in the Gaza-Jericho First 
peace agreement. Our aspiration was larger than this agreement. 
However, as a result of the rift that befell the Arab family, 
we accepted these results. We were aspiring for something 
greater. Had the Arab nation experienced solidarity and closed 
its ranks as part of both the new world order and the economic 
and political blocs and groupings, results would have been 
better. However, we support the well-being of the brothers in 
Palestine. 
  [Reporter] Your Excellency the President, the last question 
is: What is your assessment of Yemeni relations with the United 
States at present? 
  [Salih] Our relationship with the United States is excellent 
and advanced. I believe that my visit to the United States in 
1990 produced a positive outcome. These relations are advancing 
and growing. We are satisfied with the level of relations with 
the United States. 
  [Reporter] Your Excellency President Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih: We thank you for this meeting, and I wish you success in 
your endeavors.

  [Text] A responsible source in the General People's 
Congress [GPC] has made the following statement to the Yemeni 
News Agency SABA': The GPC voices deep regret and anxiety over 
the provocative and premeditated actions by the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] leadership seeking to exacerbate the atmosphere, and 
fabricate problems so that the political crisis may take a 
violent turn, particularly with the approach of 10 Ramadan [20 
February], the date set for the leadership of the coalition and 
the representatives of the political forces to sign the document 
of pledge and accord in Amman, the capital of fraternal Jordan. 
  While the leadership of the coalition has and continues to 
exert intensive efforts to contain the negative impact of the 
partitioning decision Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, member of the 
YSP Political Bureau and prime minister, made appointing a 
governor for the Abyan governorate, thus exceeding the 
constitutional prerogatives that are granted to the Presidential 
Council and the Council of ministers in this respect, the YSP 
and the influential people within it in the Aden governorate 
today further exacerbated the crisis. Salih Munassir al-Siyali, 
Aden governor, and member of the political bureau, summoned the 
commander of the Central Security Units in Aden and informed him 
that the party leadership has decided to quickly move the 
Central Security Units from their locations in the Radfan camp 
in (Kurmaksal) to the al-Mashari' area in Dar Sa'd, thus 
violating the military security committee's decision and the 
decisions of the dialogue committee of not carrying out any 
transfer or change in any of the forces, giving a 12-hour 
ultimatum to carry out the order. Otherwise, deterring measures 
will be taken to force them to move. 
  Contacts were made to convince the YSP to avoid such an 
escalation. However, the contacts were unsuccessful, and water 
and electricity were cut from the camp today as a prelude to a 
bloody confrontation. 
  Denouncing these provocations by the YSP and its military 
command, the GPC holds the YSP responsible for the consequences 
of this measure. It appeals to the brothers in the YSP 
leadership to show deference for their people and their unity. 
  The GPC also urges all political organizations and forces, 
at 
the forefront of which is the dialogue committee, to denounce 
and condemn such measures. The GPC also affirms that these 
provocations will not weaken its determination to sign the 
pledge and accord document, which is the only way out of the 
political crisis. Nor will such measures weaken the GPC 
determination to reunite the coalition to implement the articles 
of the document, since this is a joint responsibility. 
  It is God who grants success.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemeni Planning </F>
and Development Minister and member of the National Dialogue 
Committee, by Ahmad Birru; from the "Today's Guest" program; 
place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemeni minister 
of planning and development and member of the National Dialogue 
Committee, the dialogue committee adopted the document of pledge 
and accord to settle the political crisis in Yemen. As yet, and 
after nearly one month, this document remains unsigned. When 
will it be signed and where.? 
  [Al-Iryani] Really, it is regrettable that one month has 
passed and the document is still unsigned. The reason is that 
some wish to sign it abroad. This principle is welcomed. But, 
unfortunately, it has delayed the signing of the document more 
than needed. We thank God that we reached a final agreement 
that it will be signed on 20 of this month in the capital of the 
fraternal Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. 
  Personally, I had hoped that this document would be signed 
24 
hours after it was adopted. 
  [Birru] Will President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice 
President 'Ali salim al-Bid leave for Amman to sign the document? 
  [Al-Iryani] This is what has been agreed. I believe this 
will 
take place. 
  [Birru] After this, will Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
return to Sanaa? 
  [Al-Iryani] First of all, the document of pledge and accord 
is a document to end a crisis. The crisis with all its 
manifestations and consequences is known to all, specifically by 
the Yemeni people. Thus, the signing should end this crisis that 
has disturbed the people. One of the most important 
manifestations as to the end of the crisis, or the most 
important obligation resulting from the signing is that the 
state institutions, the Presidential Council, the Council of 
Ministers, and the House of Representatives should meet with all 
their members. If any of the present partitioning manifestations 
remains, this means a violation of the document and an evasion 
of its implementation. 
  [Birru] The Yemeni Socialist Party has asked for security 
guarantees before signing the document and before Vice President 
'Ali Salim al-Bid returns to Sanaa. What are these guarantees? 
  [Al-Iryani] These are arrangements on which agreement will 
be 
reached, God willing, before the departure. In my opinion, 
these will be specific arrangements that will be immediately 
implemented upon the signature of the competent official 
quarters. These quarrters, of course, cannot start 
implementation, except after the state bodies meet to give them 
instructions for implementing them. There is no dispute about 
the adoption of security arrangements and implementing them. 
However, the present division obstructs the implementaton of 
these guarantees. God willing, agreement will be reached on the 
measures that will lead to implementation. All of this, in the 
end, depends on signing the document and on the state officials 
reassuming their duties to implement these guarantees. 
  [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, it is noted that the 
Socialist Party and all its officials, including the prime 
minister, have moved to Aden. They are making decisions and 
appointing officials in south Yemen, the last of which was 
appointing a governor for Abyan area. How do you interpret this 
escalation? 
  [Al-Iryani] I do not consider it as evidence of goodwill. 
But let us assume that the crisis atmosphere imposes some 
inappropriate and unacceptable behaviors. The signing of the 
document is sure to end all these practices, otherwise, all 
efforts made to conclude this document will be useless. The 
document now belongs to the whole Yemeni people, and no one can 
claim that he possesses it or that he is authorized to implement 
it by himself. Likewise, no executive authority party can avoid 
implementing it. Let us view all the regrettable developments 
and all the practices that are going on with good intentions. 
Let us consider them as imposed by the atmosphere of crisis 
although these practices are unconstitutional. 
  What is important is the implementation after signing of the 
document. The first and most important test is the unity of the 
political leadership in words and deeds as stipulated by the 
document of pledge and accord. If this was not realized, I say 
that from now that the responsibility will be shouldered by 
those who did not commit themselves to its text. 
  [Birru] You mean that the current escalation is a temporary 
one and, in your view, will be over after the signing of the 
document of pledge and accord? 
  [Al-Iryani] This is true if we consider good intentions for 
bad behaviors. 
  [Birru] Dr. al-Iryani, how do you view the situation? What 
is on the horizon? 
  [Al-Iryani] I believe the signing of this national document, 
that belongs to the Yemeni people now, will be the test of 
commitment to the implementation and to adherence to unity and 
democracy. Any action that prevents the state's establishments 
from implementing the text of the accord will be a hostile 
action toward the Yemeni people as a whole. 
  [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Thank you.

  [Text] India has said it is unfortunate that the U.S. 
President, Mr. Bill Clinton, had made common cause with Pakistan 
in his remarks on human rights in Jammu and Kashmir. An 
External Affairs Ministry statement issued last night said that 
Mr. Clinton has not taken into account the proven role of 
Pakistan as a state sponsoring terrorism, and no concern has 
been expressed for the human rights of the victims of the 
terrorists armed, trained, and sent into Jammu and Kashmir by 
Pakistan. The statement said that India is committed to uphold 
human rights as a part of its heritage and as enshrined in its 
Constitution and laws. 
  On the nuclear front, the statement said India neither had 
nor intended to acquire weapons of mass destruction. But 
Pakistan's nuclear intentions are well known and had been 
confirmed time and again. It said the real danger is not of an 
India-Pakistan nuclear exchange, but of nuclear adventurism on 
the part of Pakistan.

Stevens, member of the British international war crimes 
commission. 
  During the meeting, Hammudi asserted that the continued 
enforcement of the unfair embargo clamped on the Iraqi people is 
a crime against a people who opposed aggression, injustice, and 
slavery. 
  For his part, Stevens condemned the unfair embargo imposed 
on 
Iraq, because it is a violation of all international conventions 
and norms, particularly since Iraq has honored all its 
commitments as enshrined in the relevant international 
resolutions. He noted the unethical conduct practiced against 
Iraq during the war of aggression.

  During the meeting, Jasim reviewed the effects of the unjust 
blockade imposed on the Iraqi people in contravention of 
international and humanitarian laws and norms. He reviewed the 
Iraqi people's extensive efforts under the leadership of 
struggler President Saddam Husayn to reconstruct what the evil 
ones have destroyed and to launch the new construction campaign. 
  Latif Nusayyif Jasim urged international organizations and 
honorable individuals in the world to continue their protests 
against the crime of the unjust blockade through activities that 
enhance the Iraqi people's steadfastness in the face of the 
unjust blockade. 
  Praising Iraq's reconstruction of what the aggressors have 
destroyed, Hugh Stevens expressed great admiration for Iraq's 
achievements under the leadership of President Saddam Husayn in 
the face of the aggression. He indicated that such achievements 
would not have been realized had it not for the Iraqi people's 
rallying around their national leadership and love for their 
historic leader.

<F P=106> ["Lecture" by Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, secretary general of the </F>
Arab Popular Forces Conference, delivered during a study course 
at the Party Preparation School for members of party branch 
leaderships; date not given: "Dangers of the Gaza-Jericho 
Agreement to Arab Future"] 
  [Text] When speaking about the agreement concerning the 
Declaration of Principles on the Arrangements for Self-Rule, one 
must bear in mind the national, pan-Arab, and international 
dangers inherent in this agreement, which was initialed on 
19/8/1993 and signed at the White House in the presence of the 
PLO chairman and the Zionist enemy prime minister and with the 
blessing of President Bill Clinton on 13/9/1993. 
  Of course, the Gaza-Jericho First agreement is not the first 
imperialist Zionist plan designed to liquidate the Palestine 
question and the Arab-Israeli conflict, but it certainly is the 
most dangerous development, not only to the rights of the 
Palestinian people, but also to the very existence of the Arab 
nation, its future, rights, and higher interests. 
  The conspiracy against the Arabism of Palestine began with 
the first organized Zionist emigration in 1882. Its chapters 
then unfolded one after the other. At the first Zionist 
conference in Basle, Switzerland, a decision was made to 
establish "a Jewish state" in Palestine, which Herzel claimed 
was a land without people, and people without land! 
  The ominous Balfour Declaration followed on 2/11/1917, 
expressing Britain's symnpathy with "the establishment of a 
national homeland for the Jewish people." Under the declaration, 
Britain promised to do all it could to facilitate the 
achievement of this objective. This promise was reinforced by 
the agreement establishing the British mandate in Palestine in 
September 1923. 
  Under the British British mandate, Zionist emigration to 
Palestine intensified in an organized and militant manner. On 
29/11/1947, the UN General Assembly approved under Resolution 
181 the "partition of Palestine into two independent states; an 
Arab state and a Jewish state" and "a special international 
status for the City of Jerusalem." 
  The Arabs in Palestine and other parts of the Arab World 
rejected this plan, and so the armed resistance intensified. On 
14/5/1948, the Zionist entity was established with the departure 
of the British high commissioner and the termination of the 
colonial British mandate in Palestine. 
  However, the Palestinian people's struggle to regain their 
land, freedom, and honour did not stop. Throughout the past 
decades, there were uprisings; foremost, was the ['Izz al-Din] 
al-Qassam Uprising of 1936. There were also upheavals, the 
latest of which was the Intifada of 7 December 1987 which 
crowned the Palestinian Arabs' struggle experience and showed 
their full readiness for struggle and sacrifice, using stones 
and knives in order to resist the invader Zionists. The 
aggressions of 1948, 1956, and 1967 resulted in the complete 
occupation of the Palestinian homeland, the Syrian Golan, 
southern Lebanon, and the Egyptian Sinai. This honorable Arab 
struggle was also the target of continuous plots and suspicious 
plans which were hatched during or after every Arab setback. 
  The most serious conspiratorial plan followed al-Sadat's 
visit to occupied Jerusalem, when on 17/9/1978 the Egyptian 
regime and the Zionist entity reached an agreement under U.S. 
patronage, namely, the treasonous Camp David Accord and the 
Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, which excluded Arab Egypt from 
the circle of the conflict against Zionism. 
  The initiative of the Iraqi leadership to convene an Arab 
summit in Baghdad on 1/18/1978 came as an important step toward 
isolating al-Sadat's regime and circumventing the Camp David 
Accord in order to prevent its application to the other Arabs. 
Leader President Saddam Husayn played a significant role in 
this regard. 
  After the cease-fire in the immortal Mother of Battles 
against the U.S.-NATO-Zionist coalition, war criminal Bush 
declared his initiative before the U.S. Congress on 6/3/1991 -- 
one week after the end of the hostile 30-state aggression 
against Iraq -- to avoid the mounting Arab and international 
pressure resulting from the initiative, which leader President 
Saddam Husayn declared on 12 August 1990 calling for settling 
all problems of our region on common bases and principles and in 
accordance with the so-called international legitimacy, whose 
falsehood, hypocrisy, and bias had been exposed. Thus the 
Madrid talks took place under a clear disequilibrium in the 
balance of powers, especially following the treacherous 
aggression against Iraq and its strategic capabilities, the 
divisions of official Arab ranks, and the assertion of U.S. 
monopoly in the absence of an effective Soviet and European role. 
  The timing of the Madrid talks and their terms of reference 
as well as the failure to seek a comprehensive solution of the 
Palestine question and the Arab-Israeli conflict are all gross 
mistakes, into which the official Arab negotiators and the PLO 
have fallen. Even under this rejected peaceful settlement, the 
representatives of the Arab parties ceded their best pressure 
cards in advance. They gave up all the gains which have been 
achieved by pan-Arab struggle on international levels, including 
the resolutions issued by the UN General Assembly and the 
Security Council. 
  Let us now go back to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which was 
hatched in the dark and which surprised the legitimate 
Palestinian leadership and stunned the Arab nation, causing its 
frustration and indignation. 
  We do not want to judge the Declaration of Principles on 
administrative self-rule on the basis of a capitulatory 
settlement, but on the basis of liberating and asserting the 
Arabism of Palestine, all of Palestine. (With regard to the 
Palestine question, it is essential in all phases, and under all 
circumstances, to take into consideration the nature of the 
conflict with the Zionist enemy. As leader and founder comrade 
Michel 'Aflaq said: "This is a crucial and cultural conflict." 
The Ba'th Party has affirmed right from the start that 
confrontation with the Zionist enemy is inevitable, and that 
popular struggle is the best method for this inevitable 
confrontation. It was on this basis that the Ba'th Party 
rejected the peaceful settlements propagated by some people 
because they serve the Zionist entity.) 
  Leader President Saddam Husayn has pointed out that "when 
the 
conflict is crucial and cultural, then it is a long, continuous 
conflict, and it must cover all aspects of pan-Arab development." 
  (As stated in the National Command statement issued on 
1/10/1978, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party which, throughout its 
pan-Arab struggle history, has made the question of liberating 
the usurped land of Palestine the pivot of the entire Arab 
liberation cause, cannot consider the conflict with Zionism as a 
geographical one depending on the liberation of a few kilometers 
here and a few kilometers there. This stand stems from its 
awareness that Zionism, which has usurped a dear part of the 
Arab homeland that forms a link between the Arab East and the 
Arab Maghreb and displaced its people, is also an aggressive 
racist, sectarian, fanatic, malicious, and expansionist colonial 
movement. The conflict between Zionism and the Arab revolution 
movement cannot be settled through negotiation, bargaining, or 
attempts at compromise solutions, but through full and allout 
confrontation until the pan-Arab objectives are achieved. 
  (The party has been aware that the Zionist movement does not 
derive its strength from within itself, but from enormous 
imperialist support, and the fact that it is a forward 
imperialist stronghold, which imperialism preserves and provides 
with the means of strength in order to use it as a bridgehead 
for achieving its exploitative, monopolist interests in the 
region, and as a sharp tool for keeping the Arab homeland 
divided and dominated by reaactionary Arab forces, and the huge 
monopolist exploitation of its resources and wealth.) 
  (On the basis of this awareness, the Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party has always believed that confrontation, not surrender and 
negotiation, is the means to counter the dangers of Zionism. 
Confrontation of the Zionist enemy cannot also be separated from 
confrontation of the imperialist enemy.) 
  In light of this firm, principled pan-Arab stand, we find 
that the signatories of the Gaza-Jericho agreement have acted to 
the contrary and have given the right, without being authorized 
by anyone, to put an immediate and unjust end to the Arab 
conflict with Zionism and imperialism. The agreement's preamble 
calls for: "an end to decades of confrontations and conflicts, 
mutual recognition of political and legitimate rights, and 
achievement of an honorable peaceful coexistence, mutual 
security, and a historic reconciliation." 
  Just as al-Sadat committed the sin of talking, negotiating, 
and signing on behalf of the Palestinian people in the second 
part of the Camp David Accords, the Palestinian side also 
behaved as a trustee for the Arab nation by signing in Oslo and 
Washington an agreement prejudicing all its rights, without any 
approval or authorization from legitimate Palestinian 
constitutional institutions. In fact, the Oslo-Washington 
signatories forced the Governments of Jordan and Egypt to 
participate in establishing closer cooperation and liaison 
arrangments with the government of Tel Aviv and the 
representatives of the Palestinian self-rule. (Clause 12 of the 
agreement) 
  The danger is not just in the provisions of the agreement, 
but also in the letter recognizing "Israel." This recognition 
has been the most important objective sought by the Zionists 
since the first Zionist congress. It means accepting the 
historical Zionist plan regarding the establishment of "Greater 
Israel" from the Euphrates to the Nile. 
  Thus, the signatories of the agreement have abandoned the 
liberation of all of Palestine as stipulated in the PLO charter. 
They also conceded the rights of their people in exchange for 
mere administrative responsibilities within the framework of the 
usurper Zionist state. 
  This is because the Oslo-Washington agreement does not at 
all 
entail any concept of national sovereignty or right of self- 
determination. Therefore, this agreement cannot lead to the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state, as the 
signatories and their supporters are trying to delude us. Their 
delusions are refuted by the clear provisions of the agreement 
and the rejection of the racist Zionist enemy and its strategic 
ally the United States of America, the leader of terrorism and 
evil in the world. 
  Someone tried to justify the signing of the agreement by 
saying: "True, the agreement has not achieved all our 
aspirations, but it is the best available in the present Arab 
circumstances and the new world order." 
  Palestinian opposition to the agreement is based on the 
following considerations: 
  1. It is a recognition of the legitimacy of the Zionist 
entity in Palestine. It also means that the rightful owners 
have conceded their rights and acknowledged the legitimacy of 
the vicious aggressions, crimes, and violations which have been 
committed against them. 
  2. It is an abandonment of Jerusalem, including al-Aqsa 
Mosque and the other holy places, although UN Security Council 
Resolution 552 considers them occupied territory. That 
resolution neither recognizes the annexation of Jerusalem to the 
Zionist enity, nor does it consider it the eternal capital of 
this entity. The current population of Jerusalem shows that 55 
percent are Zionists and 45 percent Palestinian Arabs. The 
Jewish percentage will increase with the building of more 
settlements in the so-called Greater Jerusalem. 
  3. It does not include withdrawal of the Zionist occupation 
forces, but only speaks about redeployment and relocation of 
these forces. The Zionist negotiators held firmly to this 
concept in the Cairo and Taba talks, saying their security comes 
first. 
  4. It is a shaky self-rule under the hegemony of Zionist 
occupation. It does not at all mean the creation of a sovereign 
national authority. There is no reference to a Palestinian 
state in the agreement, which also keeps the crossings and the 
borders under enemy control. 
  5. It entrenches the existence of the settlements which have 
swallowed up more than 50 percent of the lands of the West Bank 
and Gaza. The enemy refuses to dismantle any of these 
settlements. In fact, it encourages settlers to hold on to 
these settlements, expand them, and build more. It also places 
the security of the settlements under the control of the Zionist 
forces. The enemy has confiscated 46,000 donums since the 
signing of the agreement. 
  6. It does not guarantee repatriation under Resolution 194; 
neither to the refugees of 1948, nor to the deportees of 1967. 
The PLO chairman has acknowledged that. 
  7. Its price is stopping the blessed intifadah and any kind 
of resistance despite the continuation of the occupation. Armed 
struggle is described terrorism and violence despite the rivers 
of pure Arab and Palestinian blood which the righteous martyrs 
have shed for the sake of liberating Arab Palestine. 
  8. It makes the self-rule authority a tool of oppression in 
the hand of the Palestinian police, which has pledged to 
maintain security, law, and public order under Clause (9) of the 
agreement. Therefore, they will be sparing the Zionist 
occupation authority any further burdens and sacrifices. 
  9. It deepens differences within the one people, exacerbates 
internal conflict, and weakens the resistance against the 
occupiers by turning Palestinians against each another despite 
the talk about democracy and respecting the right of those 
opposing the agreement. The implementation of the agreement 
necessitates the suppression of any opposition voice by every 
method, including physical and moral pressure. 
  As for the dangers resulting from the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
on the Arab level, they can be summed up as follows: 
  1. The agreement is a basic contradiction to the cultural 
pan- Arab plan to achieve the unified socialist democratic Arab 
society. It is also a deviation from the Arab League Charter, 
the Arab summit resolutions, and all pan-Arab principles. 
  2. The agreement torpedoes the idea of greater Arab unity 
by reecognizing the expansionist Zionist enemy and entrenching 
the existing regional divisions in accordance with the map of 
the Sykes- Picot Agreement of 1916 which divided the Arab 
homneland and the one nation into weak small states; in fact, 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement wwould lead to further 
imperialist-Zionist disintegration of the Arab states into 
ethnic and sectarian cantons and regions. 
  3. The agreement replaces the existing official Arab order 
represented by the Arab League by a new Middle East order, which 
would include Israel in security and political arrangements as 
well as economic agreements, in addition to other non-Arab 
states. Thus, the pan-Arab bond would be replaced by regional 
economic and development interests of mixed nationalities, in 
favor of Zionism, imperialism and their agents. This is 
referred to in Annex No. 4 which is attached to the agreement. 
  4. The formation of a Palestinian-"Israeli" liaison 
committee referred to in Clause (10) of the agreement which will 
deal with issues of cooperation and common interest, constitutes 
a threat to Arab national security. It is also considered a 
blatant violation of the Pact of Collective Arab Defense and 
Economic Cooperation signed by the Arab states and attached to 
the League Charter. 
  5. The agreement is a Zionist "Trojan Horse" which is openly 
and directly infiltrating Arab society through a new Palestinian 
channel without the need for maneuvering. It paves the way for 
full normalization with the Zionist enemy on the political, 
economic, and cultural level. 
  6. The agreement torpedoes the institutions of joint Arab 
action, especially economic ones, such as the Economic Unity 
Council. It disrupts the implementation of the economic 
instruments approved at the 1980 summit in Amman which are 
concerned with achieving Arab development and separating 
economic cooperation from political differences. 
  7. The agreement ends the Zionist entity's isolation and 
cancels the Arab economic boycott of the enemy that has gravely 
affected an economy burdened with problems and dependent on U.S. 
and Western aid and international loans and the provision of 
investment opportunities, raw materials, cheap labor, and large 
markets for its prosperity. 
  8. The agreement lifts all Arab, Islamic, and international 
barriers to cooperation with the Zionist enemy and recognition 
of its usurper entity after the rightful Palestinian owners have 
themselves recognized the enemy. The collapse is already 
evident in the new attitudes of several Arab regimes, as well as 
China, the Vatican, African states, and others. 
  9. The agreement will lead to giving up all positive gains 
and the resolutions issued in the interests of the Palestinian 
people and the Arab nation by the Islamic Congress Organization, 
the Nonaligned Movement, the OAU, the UN General Assembly and 
the Security Council and other specialized agencies and 
organizations. 
  10. The agreement has led and will lead to a further split 
in the Arab ranks by dividing these ranks into those supporting 
and those opposing the agreement, after the Palestine question 
had been a rallying factor and a source of strength and 
unification for the nation throughout the great Arab homeland. 
  11. The split will spread to the Arab masses, where the 
popular organizations and federations as well as the 
professional unions will be in a real dilemma about how to deal 
with the Palestinian organizations supporting the agreement, 
especially since the resolutions of the popular Arab federations 
have previously blacklisted whoever called for the support of 
the Camp David Accords or recognition of and normalization with 
the Zionist enemy and its institutions. 
  And now, three months after Gaza-Jericho First, and last, 
stumbling and failure are still pervading the negotiation 
situation due to Zionist procrastination and exploitation of 
every weak point in the opposite party. So the Palestinian 
negotiator has no choice but to retreat further and make more 
concessions. 
  U.S. imperialism and its ally world Zionism are now seeking 
to liquidate the Palestine question and the Arab nation's rights 
as rapidly as possible by using the pressure of blackmail on the 
PLO and the broken-down agent Arab regimes. 
  At the same time, however, the numbers of those supporting 
this humiliating agreement is receding, the brave Palestinian 
intifadah operations are escalating, and the objectives of the 
enemies of Palestine and Arabism are being exposed more and more. 
  Our party has already declared its rejection of this 
capitulatory settlement which is being led by Washington, and 
affirmed the nation's rejection of these conspiratorial formulas 
and its insistence on regaining its usurped rights, especially 
the Palestinian people's right to their homeland. 
  Awakening the Arab nation's forces through struggle 
sacrifices, escalating the Palestinian intifadah, adhering to 
the spirit and message of the Mother of Battles epic, and 
strengthening the cause of common struggle, aim, and national 
destiny is the correct way to preserve the Arabism of Palestine 
and guarantee its liberation from the yoke of 
imperialist-Zionist occupation. 
  The Gaza-Jericho agreement is bound to fail despite all the 
foreign support and protection. 
  Finally, victory shall be for Arabism and Palestine under 
the 
flag of the faithful, courageous leader Saddam Husayn, may God 
preserve and protect him.

  [Excerpts] The Cabinet met in the Presidential Palace this 
morning. It approved several bills on its agenda and referred 
an urgent bill to the Chamber of Deputies to amend the salaries 
of teaching staff at the Lebanese University. 
  Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz advised the Cabinet on the 
content of a message he received from U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher warning against the resumption of violence in 
south Lebanon and western al-Biqa'. The message considers 
violence to be very dangerous and potentially harmful for the 
peace process. We will now hear the Cabinet's resolutions as 
announced by acting Information Minister Muhsin Dallul. 
  [Begin recording] [Dallul] Upon the invitation of Prime 
Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, the Cabinet held its weekly session 
this morning chaired by His Excellency President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi. At the outset, his excellency spoke of the recent 
crime perpetrated in Ba'labakk [killing of a woman and her two 
sons by a young boy, who was later executed by Hizballah 
according to Islamic shari'ah] 
and the messages addressed to the government demanding that it 
protect the Constitution. The prime minister said that the 
justice minister did his duty as best he could and that the 
Public Prosecution Office has been notified to apply the law. 
  Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz advised the Cabinet that he 
received a message from the U.S. secretary of state warning 
against a resumption of violence in south Lebanon and western 
al-Biqa'. The message considers that an escalation of the 
situation would be very serious and could harm the peace talks. 
The message also said there is a need for self-restraint 
because violence runs counter to the positive atmosphere that 
prevailed at the Geneva summit conference. Christopher concluded 
his message by saying the continuing military escalation can't 
be accepted because it might torpedo the peace process. 
  In line with the justice minister's proposal, the crime of 
the killing of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah has been 
referred to the Judicial Council. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified Correspondent] What about the Lebanese stance 
on the U.S. message? How will the government respond to the 
Israeli escalation in the south? 
  [Dallul] The discussions at the Cabinet meeting noted that 
it 
is Israel that constantly escalates the situation, that the 
fedayeen operation that targeted Israeli soldiers was carried 
out in the border strip and on Lebanese territory, and that as 
long the Israeli occupation continues, the government cannot 
halt any Lebanese group that wants to confront the occupation by 
any available means. 
  [Correspondent] How do you view the timing of the U.S. 
message, especially as it coincides with talk about Israel 
proposing to the Lebanese negotiating delegation in Washington 
the formation of joint military committees? 
  [Dallul] We have rejected the formation of any committees 
that do not stem from a program for Israeli withdrawal and we 
hold on to this stance because we are dutybound to defend our 
rights as people and as a homeland. 
  [Correspondent] Do you expect a large-scale Israeli military 
operation? 
  [Dallul] We expect anything from Israel, but everything has 
a 
price. Israel will pay for any action it may take. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] the General Labor 
Federation? 
  [Dallul] No, no one proposed it. 
  [Correspondent] Did the prime minister brief you about [word 
indistinct] meeting? 
  [Dallul] No. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] your request tasking the 
Internal Security Forces with supervising soccer matches? 
  [Dallul] He rejected the request and insisted that the Army 
continue this task. 
  [Correspondent] Given the Israeli threats and aggression in 
the south, [words indistinct] the U.S. [words indistinct] to 
stop resistance, what is the fate of the peace talks? 
  [Dallul] The peace talks will continue and as long as the 
Israeli forces occupy Lebanon the resistance will continue.

  [Excerpt] With the Hizballah organization marking the 
second anniversary of an Israel Air Force attack that killed 
local leader Shaykh 'Abbas Musawi, fierce fighting raged in the 
area this morning. The offense began when Hizballah launched 
katyusha rockets at targets in the eastern sector of the south 
Lebanon security zone. Most landed in open areas without causing 
either injuries or damage, with Hizballah continuing the attack 
with RPG antitank rockets. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and 
SLA [South Lebanese Army] hit back with tank fire, and according 
to Lebanese radio reports battle helicopters strafed the area of 
Kafr Shuba in the security zone, while war planes patrolled the 
skies. 
  Other areas hit by RPG, machine-gun fire, and light weapons 
fire were al-Hamra' bridge in the western sector, and around 
Marj 'Uyun. Shaykh Musawi, one of the most prominent Hizballah 
leaders in the south, died when his car was hit by Israeli 
helicopter fire near his home in Jibshit. [passage omitted]

and carried out a large-scale sweep in the fields and valleys 
near the village, causing material damage. The resistance 
responded by firing Katyusha rockets at the al-Bayyadah position.

<F P=106> [By Muhammad Dalbah] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- Suspicion about a Libyan connection 
in the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in 
Beirut last month has been reinforced by reports that the 
Jordanian Government rejected a Libyan request to hand over two 
Libyan officers who had reportedly fled to Jordan in the wake of 
a failed coup attempt against Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi last 
October. 
  These reports state that two Libyan officers and a third 
person left for Jordan following the failure of this attempt and 
contacted the U.S. Embassy in Amman. 
  The two officers escaped across Libya's borders with a 
neighboring country on their way to Amman where they were joined 
by a civilian who was outside Libya when the detentions that 
followed the failed attempt were carried out. Two of the 
escapees belong to the al-Wa'ir clan, one of the most 
influential clans in the Libyan Warfalah tribe. 
  Libya demanded that the two officers be handed over, but the 
Jordanian authorities informed it that they were not in Amman. 
Actually, they had been transferred to a U.S. base in Germany 
where they were subjected to intense interrogation by U.S. 
agencies before being allowed to contact their friends in the 
Libyan opposition. 
  Libya, however, has denied any connection with the 
assassination of the Jordanian diplomat and has described 
reports linking it with the incident as an attempt to undermine 
its relations with Jordan.

<F P=106> [Report by radio correspondent Murshid Dandash in Ba'labakk </F>
on 16 February--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] Hizballah Secretary General Sayyid Hasan 
Nasrallah has reacted to the Israeli threats, saying: Our 
response is that all this is futile and a waste of time. Our 
option is resistance, and we will maintain it and not retreat 
one step. He maintained that the method of threats, 
exaggerations, destruction of homes, and shelling of peaceful 
areas will be useless. Hundreds of operations have taken place. 
Hizballah has not been destroyed and the resistance has not 
ended. Nasrallah spoke this evening at a ceremony marking the 
second anniversary of the martyrdom of former Hizballah 
Secretary General 'Abbas al-Musawi in al-Nabi Shit. After 
praising recent operations against Israel, Nasrallah affirmed 
that negotiations have achieved no success by the end of 1993. 
Referring to the domestic situation, he criticized the 
government's policy until now. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that Israel 
views with deep gravity yesterday's katyusha shelling of the 
Galilee. This was a violation of a valid agreement in the 
region, Peres said. The appropriate authorities are now 
checking whether it was an isolated incident, and Israel will 
decide on its moves based on the outcome of the investigation. 
Mr. Peres spoke with correspondents after meeting with 
Portugal's foreign minister. 
  Police Minister Moshe Shahal said that Israel will respond 
with its full might against anybody who harms the Galilee 
residents. Minister Shahal rejected the charges that there was 
an attempt to hide the shelling from the public. He said he is 
convinced that the news was withheld for operational reasons. 
Our correspondent Nati Silberman reports that the police 
minister addressed a ceremony inaugurating a new police station 
in Tirat Karmel.

  [Text] Israel has called on the United States to look into 
the extent of Syria's involvement in the latest katyusha 
shelling. In its appeal to Washington, Israel is asking that 
the U.S. Administration guarantee that the understandings 
reached with Syria, which ended Operation Accountability, are 
upheld. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports: 
  [Begin Raz recording] Last night, Israel signaled -- which 
may be an understatement -- the gravity with which it regards 
the katyusha shelling early Wednesday [16 February]. In 
addition to the sharply worded announcement, which I will read 
out in a minute, Israel called on the United States to guarantee 
what it called the understandings that led to the conclusion of 
Operation Accountability and attempted to convey through 
Washington the gravity with which it regards the violation of 
the understandings. The Israeli request was sent to the highest 
echelons in Washington through several channels. 
  According to what is known, the katyusha was fired by a 
Palestinian organization called 13 Black September, but Israel 
says the shelling could not have been carried out without an 
understanding with Hizballah, thereby pointing an accusing 
finger at other elements. Operation Accountability ended in 
response to a U.S. effort to bring about a cease-fire. U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher intervened personally with 
Israel and Syria to achieve the agreement. Israel's 
interpretation, therefore, is that the understandings were 
achieved with Syria, which is responsible for maintaining them. 
  The Jerusalem statement says: The highest security elements 
take a grave view of the katyusha shelling at Israeli soil, 
which violates the understandings that led to the conclusion of 
Operation Accountability. 
  That is the signal and that is the Israeli position in the 
wake of the katyusha fired before dawn on Wednesday. [end 
recording] 
  Israeli delegates also relayed a similar protest to the 
Syrian and Lebanese representatives to the Washington peace 
talks. Our Washington correspondent Arye Golan reports: 
  [Begin Golan recording] Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, head 
of the Israeli delegation, reminded his Syrian counterpart, 
Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, that although Syria is not directly 
responsible for the incident, it was a party to the August 1993 
agreement between Israel and Lebanon, signed under U.S. auspices 
following Warren Christopher's mediation. Uri Lubrani, head of 
the delegation to the talks with Lebanon, demanded from his 
counterpart, Suhayl Shammas, that Lebanon restrain Hizballah in 
order to prevent a deterioration in the situation along the 
northern border. 
  Professor Rabinovich explained to the head of the Syrian 
delegation the importance of public diplomacy. He said that we 
know that in its Hebrew-language broadcasts, Damascus Radio uses 
the term normal peace relations, but that is not enough because 
these broadcasts do not have many listeners in Israel. On the 
other hand, he criticized Damascus' refusal to permit Knesset 
Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah to pay a condolence visit to 
Syria following the death of President al-Asad's son. Had he 
been permitted entry, Amb. Rabinovich said, it would have been a 
true gesture, but the Syrians did not use the opportunity to 
show their good intentions. 
  Al-'Allaf complained about Israeli charges that Syria is 
making do with a powerless and relatively unimportant pensioner 
like himself as its representative at the talks. The day, 
therefore, passed in an exchange of recriminations. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq said the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] will continue to defend the security zone in 
south Lebanon and will use all the means at its disposal against 
Hizballah. Part of the struggle is taking place inside the 
security zone and part beyond it, the chief of staff said. He 
added that the war in Lebanon is against both Shiites and the 
Lebanese, which makes it more difficult for SLA [South Lebanese 
Army] soldiers. Lieutenant General Baraq made his remarks in an 
address to Jerusalem high school students. These remarks were 
brought to us by correspondent Ya'el Ben-Yehuda. 
  Gen. Baraq also said that the defense burden imposed on 
reserve soldiers this year is similar to that prior to the 
intifadah. The IDF decided to impose an additional defense 
burden in Judaea, Samaria, the Gaza Strip, and the Lebanese 
border on the 19 and 20-year-olds draftees and not their older 
brothers and fathers, who as civilians are at the peak of their 
careers.

Golan Yokhpaz reports that the soldiers, who were stationed at a 
roadblock in the village, detained the man in order to carry out 
a routine check of his papers. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
is currently investigating why one of the soldiers shot the 
local resident. 
  A young Arab was slightly wounded in the leg this morning 
when shot by soldiers in Halhul after he stoned an IDF patrol. 
Halhul and Hebron residents rioted following yesterday's 
killing of a Halhul resident by soldiers. 
  Our correspondent reports that there is a general strike 
today in most major towns in Judaea and Samaria in solidarity 
with Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.

<F P=106> [Report by Doron Me'iri] </F>
  [Text] The number of terrorist attacks in Jerusalem fell 
sharply in 1993 compared with 1992. This emerges from data 
released by Yehuda Wilk, commander of the Israel Police 
Jerusalem District, summing up the 1993 work year. 
  The severity of the attacks, however, did not change: three 
people were killed and 17 wounded in 1993 compared with three 
killed and 12 wounded in 1992. 
  The number of car torchings dropped significantly: 267 cars 
were set ablaze in 1993 compared with 448 in 1992. Stone 
throwing also decreased sharply: 2,731 incidents in 1993 as 
opposed to 3,640 in 1992. The same applies to firebomb attacks: 
64 in 1993 as opposed to 91 in 1992. 
  There were 24 stabbings and attempted stabbings in 1993 
compared with 27 in 1992. Three bombs were planted in 1993 
compared with 14 in 1992. The number of shooting incidents 
remained unchanged: five instances in both 1992 and 1993. 
  Commander Wilk attributed the drop in terrorist attacks to 
"aggressive intelligence methods adopted by the Jerusalem 
police." According to him, "terror-related problems cannot be 
solved by deploying huge numbers of policemen and are best 
handled by small intelligence teams." 
  In 1993, the Jerusalem police arrested 350 Arabs suspected 
of 
having participated in disturbances, including stone-throwing 
incidents; 15 suspected of hurling firebombs; and 60 suspected 
of torching cars.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres </F>
by Debora Berlinck in Geneva "before addressing the UN Human 
Rights Commission"] 
  [Text] [Berlinck] Is what you achieved with this agreement 
what was missing? 
  [Peres] We had serious difficulties reaching this agreement. 
We reached a 68-point agreement, arguing over each phrase, each 
expression, but without going to war, without being pressured. 
It is an unprecedented agreement, a goodwill trial. There are 
still some obstacles, some details about daily activities in the 
occupied territories to be settled. This will take time. I am 
aware there is still a lot to be negotiated. But if we were 
able to reach an agreement with Egypt, a country with which we 
had been at war for the past 15 years, we also will do so now. 
  [Berlinck] Do you think this agreement will mark the 
beginning of a Palestinian state? 
  [Peres] That is not important. People must understand that 
the first negotiation took place among ourselves, the Israelis, 
not with the Palestinians. Israel had to choose what it wanted 
to be. I believe the best solution would be to create a 
confederation with the Jordanians, Palestinians...[pauses] 
'Arafat told me he thought the same. And I do not think it 
will be hard to find a solution that will satisfy all parties. 
The situation merits a confederation because most Jordanians 
are of Palestinian origin and most Palestinians are Jordanian 
citizens. Therefore, it would be completely unreal to establish 
two countries. 
  [Berlinck] 'Arafat was never criticized as much as now by 
the Palestinians, who now accuse him of having made too many 
concessions to Israel. Don't you think this agreement is at 
stake? 
  [Peres] I am certain that most Palestinians, like us, want 
peace. We are all sick of war, violence, and terror. A century 
ago the Palestinians tried to solve their problems with weapons. 
But they made no progress; quite the contrary, they only 
hindered economic and social development. The Palestinians' 
support for the PLO and for the peace-seeking negotiations is of 
a political and not a personal nature. I am certain this 
support represents most Palestinians. 
  [Berlinck] Why does Israel insist on controlling the 
borders. Is it for safety reasons or does it fear it will lose 
sovereignty over the occupied territory? 
  [Peres] The negotiations were carried out when terrorism 
still existed. I told 'Arafat: "I am aware you cannot wipe out 
terrorism. The territories are under our responsibility. 
Moreover, it must be clearly established that there is a single 
border. It is an autonomy; therefore, there is no border 
between Israel and the neighboring countries, and another 
between Israel and the autonomous territories. Every person who 
crosses the border has a right to circulate throughout the 
country -- to go to Jerusalem, Tel-Aviv. And what if that person 
is a terrorist?" 'Arafat answered: "But I am a terrorist." I 
then refuted: "No, you are a former terrorist. You were fired 
from that job. We are the only ones who have weapons and 
policemen to fight terrorism. Moreover, you know we are not at 
peace with Jordan." Israel is going to insist that it remain in 
charge of safety in the territories. A clear difference between 
dignity and safety must be established. The Palestinians may 
have the dignity but the Israelis must be in charge of the 
safety. 
  [Berlinck] The Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement continues 
at war with Israel, but its leaders now are trying to find a way 
to assume a leading role as soon as elections are held in the 
territories. 
  [Peres] That is a problem, but Israel is not willing to act 
as the Palestinians' police. The Palestinians must elect their 
own leader and take care of their safety. It is not up to us to 
choose. We will negotiate with the leader who represents the 
majority. 
  [Berlinck] When does Israel intend to extend autonomy to 
the entire occupied territories and when does it intend to 
withdraw from these territories? 
  [Peres] I do not like to give deadlines or dates. All I can 
say is that we are really trying to speed up negotiations. As 
for our withdrawal from the occupied territories, we are trying 
to do so as soon as possible but that is not only up to us. 
Some problems we did not expect have surfaced, and this will 
delay things more than we expected. One of the problems is the 
border: A person crossing it has to be checked. 
  [Berlinck] Do you believe in 'Arafat now? 
  [Peres] It is not up to me to decide. 'Arafat represents a 
country that believes in him. To tell you the truth, I am 
certain the world is changing and that is not up to me or 
'Arafat. The Palestinians have changed; 'Arafat has changed; we 
have changed. The world today is a new world without an arms 
race, without Saudi Arabia to replace others with its money. 
The important thing today is not the size of a country but 
rather how fertile its land is. 
  [Berlinck] What does Israel intend to do with the demand for 
the release of hundreds of prisoners? 
  [Peres] If they promise they will stop their terrorist 
activities, great; then they will have a right to request their 
release. If not, what right do they have to ask us to stop 
defending ourselves? 
  [Berlinck] After the Palestinians, another difficult 
negotiation within the framework of the peace-seeking process 
will be Syria. After the Clinton-al-Asad meeting have you 
received any indication from the Syrians regarding al-Asad's 
desire to normalize relations? 
  [Peres] Nothing. What there is is not enough. They do not 
clearly understand what peace means; they do not understand it 
entails embassies, open borders, free trade. The Syrian media 
states: "We support peace but without embassies." They comment 
that Syria does not have an embassy with Kazakhstan. But, of 
course, the Syrians do not have to ask Kazakhstan permission to 
withdraw from the Golan Heights. The third issue is safety: We 
are not in the Golan Heights for biblical reasons. We are there 
for safety reasons, because we were attacked three times. The 
fourth point is Lebanon. There is a link between Lebanon's 
future and Syria's policy that must be settled. 
  [Berlinck] The latest poll shows 70 percent of the Israelis 
are not in favor of giving the Golan Heights back to Syria in 
exchange for peace. Is your government willing to become 
unpopular? 
  [Peres] The poll results are changing. The differences 
between poll results are like perfume: nice to smell but bitter 
to swallow. A government is not a hospital where physicians 
must take the patients' temperature every day. If we are 
successful in achieving peace, the people will be on our side. 
If not, they must not elect us, and for very good reasons. We 
are not going to use makeup to look better.

<F P=106> [Article by Pascal Lacorie in Jerusalem: "Middle East -- </F>
France Backs Palestinians"] 
  [Text] France will help the future Palestinian economy as 
it takes its first steps. This is especially necessary as the 
first year may well be the most hazardous. The Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO), which is practically bankrupt, 
will need to set up a civil service and to launch industrial 
projects in order to create jobs. Today, Alain Juppe will be 
able to see firsthand the huge task that lies ahead during his 
visit to the Gaza strip -- the first such visit by a French 
foreign minister. 
  "The international aid which has been pledged must reach 
Gaza 
as soon as possible," Alain Juppe has said repeatedly. As for 
France, it is already taking action: A delegation from the 
Finance Ministry spent some time in the West Bank and the Gaza 
strip last week and is scheduled to go to the PLO's Tunis 
headquarters within the next few days. Its goal: To identify 
projects to be funded by a Fr60 million aid package. Use of the 
funds should include training of experts, technical assistance, 
and purchase of French equipment. Another Fr20 million [francs] 
will be allocated for low-interest loans to Palestinian firms. 
<H5>  Market Marginal So Far </H5>
  France has also pledged to provide almost one quarter of the 
Fr3.6 billion the European Union has said it will grant the PLO 
for the next five years. In total, international aid will 
amount to over Fr12 billion, enough to attract French firms. 
Indeed, CNPF [National Council of French Employers] President 
Francois Perigot stated at the end of last year -- on the 
occasion of a meeting with Yasir 'Arafat -- that French firms 
did wish to be present. 
  French firms interested in the new market include France 
Telecom, Bouygues, Spic-Batignolles, and Lyonnaise des Eaux. 
France-2 has been chosen to set up the future Palestinian 
television network. 
  So far, the Palestinian market has been marginal. French 
exports there did not exceed Fr200 million in sectors such as 
home appliances, medical equipment, and textile and chemical 
products. 
  Alain Juppe did not seek to minimize the hurdles that remain 
to be overcome. According to the French minister, the 
Palestinians must organize themselves in order to channel and 
manage the flow of aid. "The PLO is a political organization 
which is unfamiliar with such tasks," he explained in an 
interview with the Israeli daily HAARETZ. This comment referred 
to the reservations expressed by the World Bank, the European 
Union, and the United States as to the high proportion of 
"political" officials among the members of the Palestinian 
Economic Council set up by the PLO and chaired by Yasir 'Arafat 
himself.

<F P=106> [Report by Pierre Rousselin: "France-Israel: Resumption of </F>
Political and Military Dialogue"] 
  [Text] Jerusalem -- How can French diplomacy best play a 
role in the new Near East context? One method depends on the 
restoration of relations of trust with Israel in the defense and 
security spheres which have been virtually frozen since 1967. 
  During his first visit to Israel, [French Foreign Minister] 
Alain Juppe yesterday announced France's intention of "resuming 
a fuller political and military dialogue, especially in the 
sphere of research cooperation in the security sphere." 
  After the break which followed the Six Day War, and the 
embargo on arms supplies to the Jewish state, this dialogue is 
resuming. This is one aspect of the "new impetus, the new 
course," which Alain Juppe intends to give to Franco-Israeli 
relations now that the mutual disagreements have vanished, 
washed away by the current peace process. 
  So, it is official. Defense Minister Francois Leotard will 
come to Israel next month to open a new chapter in relations 
which enjoyed their golden age well before the 1967 war, when 
France was the main ally of the young Jewish state. 
  Already, Tsahal Chief of Staff General Ehud Barak has 
recently made a visit to France lasting several days, the first 
at this level for around 30 years. The head of the General 
Directorate of Armaments (DGA) and Armed Forces Chief of Staff 
Admiral Lanxade are also expected in Israel soon. 
  Although the resumption of high-level contacts is 
spectacular, their aim is at present to explore the 
opportunities for cooperation between the two countries' 
military industries. 
<H5>  Paris' Peace Efforts </H5>
  Joint development projects could emerge. For instance, the 
Israeli Aeronautical Industries, wishing to move over to 
civilian activities, are seeking a partner to develop a small 
satellite launcher. The French minister also announced the 
signing, in the near future, of a cooperation agreement between 
the CNES [National Center for Space Studies] and the Israeli 
Space Agency. A few weeks ago, the Americans granted the 
Israelis the right to participate in joint projects in the space 
sphere. 
  But the resumption of "political and military" dialogue with 
Israel can also be explained by the new regional security 
situation emerging in the framework of the peace negotiations. 
France is anxious to have a presence and fears that the United 
States will try to impose a "preserve" in this strategic sphere 
extended to the whole of the post-Gulf War Middle East. 
  Participating in the "security guarantees" which should 
accompany a peace agreement, safeguarding the interests of 
French military industry in the region is the issue of the 
current battle. It is reflected in Paris' efforts to play a 
full part, not only as a member of the European Union, in the 
multilateral negotiations group on disarmament and security 
questions. "We see only advantages in becoming more involved in 
that," Alain Juppe said in Jerusalem. According to a French 
source, the obstacle no longer comes so much from Jerusalem, but 
rather from Washington.... 
  Franco-Israeli relations are undergoing a spectacular 
improvement, and Alain Juppe's visit has taken place in an 
atmosphere of great cordiality. A greatly appreciated gesture 
further warmed the atmosphere: the lifting of the visa 
requirement imposed on the Israelis and the nationals of other 
countries in the region, since the violent attacks of 1986 in 
Paris. 
  Today, the French foreign minister is starting the 
Palestinian part of his visit. He is due to visit the Gaza 
strip, without Israeli escort, and to have talks with the local 
PLO officials. 
  "France wants to do all it can to ensure that autonomy 
succeeds," Alain Juppe said yesterday, while stressing that it 
was a "difficult challenge." For this purpose, new funds have 
been announced to help the establishment of the Palestinian 
administration and to train the cadres of autonomy. An 
agreement on Fr60 million will be devoted to investment in the 
territories in the course of this year. 
  Unlike his predecessors at the head of French diplomacy, 
Alain Juppe has had an easy task in Jerusalem: Since the Oslo 
agreement, supporting the Palestinians and strengthening ties 
with Israel are no longer antinomic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gonen Segev, ex-Tzomet Party member, by </F>
Ari'ela Ringel-Hoffman on 3 February; place not given -- first 
five paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] The new faction established by Gonen Segev is 
called YA'AD--Independent and Democratic Israel. [name later 
changed to YI'UD, also an acronym for Independent and Democratic 
Israel] The name was the idea of Yoram Pomerantz, once Refa'el 
Eytan's very close spokesman who found himself in the street 
after years of working side by side with Raful [Eytan's 
nickname]. The breakaways later recalled that the name had 
belonged to Lova Eli'av's movement in the elections. Gonen 
Segev said he could live with the name. He did not think it 
sounded pompous, and he did not think bad luck was passed on 
with the name. 
  A name takes getting used to, he says, just as one gets used 
to the name of a new baby. 
  On Wednesday [2 February] morning, there was still Tzomet; 
on 
Wednesday afternoon, there was YA'AD. The same Wednesday, mock 
elections were held at Blich High--the school whose voting 
patterns have become almost equal to a political forecast, to a 
nationwide poll. In those elections, Tzomet received 30 percent 
of the votes--about 37 seats--with the Labor party leading by a 
mere five seats. 
  Tiny YA'AD did not participate in the elections at all, and 
its electoral power as of now is a matter for speculation. 
  On Wednesday night, six hours after the faction's 
establishment, Gonen Segev had to be optimistic. He still 
maintained his optimism on Thursday morning. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] I understand you are still fully satisfied 
with your decision. 
  [Segev] I certainly am. The odd sheet by some accountant 
which Tzomet waved at the Central Committee meeting in 
Ari'el--which was supposed to satisfy everyone--will not change 
our minds. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Can you and should you break up a party 
which has such important tasks in such a critical period--not to 
mention the very flattering polls--over some paperwork 
irregularities? 
  [Segev] They are not just irregularities. This is a party 
which prevented the audit committee's work for a whole year, 
which operated without a budget, in which funds were thrown 
every which way, a movement which has become wasteful and 
splashy... 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Wasteful and splashy? 
  [Segev] You should see the new Tzomet offices on Derekh 
Petah Tiqva. They look like bank offices. What luxury and 
elegance. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Do you use these offices? 
  [Segev] No. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Who sits there? 
  [Segev] I do not know, all kinds of functionaries I don't 
even know. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] There must be some people you do know 
there. 
  [Segev] Doron Shmu'eli and other Doron Shmu'elis. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Are you referring to the director general 
of Tzomet, who is the butt of most of your criticism? 
  [Segev] Yes. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Back to my question: Irregularities exist 
in every party. 
  [Segev] Tzomet is not just another party. It is a movement 
whose main issue was integrity and proper administration. And 
that is not what happened. A whole party has been operating 
without a budget for a year and a half, and when someone 
suggested checking what was going on there, the chairman 
dismissed the matter. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] I thought the fate of Eretz Yisra'el, for 
instance, was the main issue. 
  [Segev] Breaking up the party was not my objective, but when 
I ran into a stone wall, when information on irregularities kept 
piling up, I had no choice. As for Eretz Yisra'el, I am not 
abandoning the struggle for it, but a depraved Tzomet can cause 
more damage than a split Tzomet. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] That is a hypothesis. What is certain is 
that Tzomet has been damaged. 
  [Segev] When I made the decision, I meant to rectify, not to 
ruin. I think that instead of asking me whether Tzomet should 
have been broken up, you should ask why the movement chairman is 
prepared to allow it the break up just to prevent a probe of 
irregularities. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] How do you explain it? Why do you think 
Raful is backing Doron Shmu'eli? 
  [Segev] I do not know. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Can you speculate? 
  [Segev] Perhaps Shmu'eli's failure would be seen as his own. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Perhaps he is truly convinced that you are 
exaggerating. Anyway, he claims he made a probe possible. 
  [Segev] Really? And why did half of the audit committee 
members quit? What made me quit? What made them doctor things 
for three weeks? 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] What things are being doctored? 
  [Segev] All kinds. When they say there is a deficit, and 
then they say there is no deficit, paperwork should be made to 
suit the statement. When they say that a certain branch -- let 
us say, the Or Yehuda branch -- received 30,000 shekels, and 
then it transpires that it received 90,000 shekels, things need 
to be fixed, some secretariat resolution has to be arranged, 
because someone had to approve the money. And all this is being 
done with funds which do not belong to me, or to Raful, or to 
Shmu'eli. These are public funds. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] You are not the first to argue against 
Raful. Tzomet has a history of those who leveled criticism at 
the chairman. You yourself said on one occasion that no one will 
suspect you of being unintelligent. Then how come it took you 
so long to find out what your predecessors said years ago? 
  [Segev] As long as the criticism was about questions such as 
"whether or not he got himself a Volvo, whether or not he got 
himself a car phone," it seemed nonsense. He was a cabinet 
minister, there were work constraints, and that was it. The 
distance between that and the other irregularities is very big. 
And I was not aware of those irregularities earlier. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Eight months ago you noticed that something 
was wrong. 
  [Segev] Raful is an electoral asset. He stands for many 
things to many people. As long as things I saw did not clash 
with my conscience, it was very convenient for me. What 
happened now was that Raful crossed the red line, as far as I 
was concerned. The outer limit of my conscience's ability to 
bend. A major part of Tzomet's votes had been granted because 
of its clean image. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Perhaps because, as Raful says, you are in 
a hurry? 
  [Segev] I repeat what you cited me as saying: No one has 
ever accused me of being a moron. What is easier than sitting 
quietly, shutting up until the next elections, and letting Raful 
go on and do my work for me? So maybe I would not be No. 2, but 
I would certainly be placed in the first slots on the party 
list, and I would definitely make it to the next Knesset. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Perhaps now you have loftier ambitions, 
something beyond a mere Knesset member. 
  [Segev] But that is precisely what I am now. I am still 
just a Knesset member, and in a small faction to boot. 
Furthermore: I am not the electoral asset Raful is, and I will 
have to work much harder. What do people think? That having 
quit, I will be deputy Knesset speaker? A cabinet minister? 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Perhaps you will be really minister. 
  [Segev] I have heard about the idea, and my qualifications 
are no worse than at least of some of today's ministers. But to 
be minister, I have to join the coalition, and to join, I have 
to accept certain guidelines. I do not think that is going to 
happen. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] What is your problem? What keeps you 
from joining the government? Was it what you thought should 
have been done when this government was composed? 
  [Segev] First, the Golan Heights question. The announcement 
that the question will be resolved through a referendum is a 
delusion. What matters here is the timing. A referendum held 
today, before an agreement with Syria is signed, will most 
probably reject the concept of withdrawal from the Golan in 
return for peace. The outcome of a referendum held in order to 
ratify a signed agreement will be different. I know no mother 
or father who will vote against an agreement that presents the 
question as either ratification or war. 
  As for Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, I am against a Palestinian 
state, and hence, also against creating the infrastructure for 
the establishment of such a state at a later stage. I believe 
that construction in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza should be 
accelerated, and it should be understood that these settlements 
on the confrontation line bodily block terrorism. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] You are not getting carried away? Bodily 
blocking terror? 
  [Segev] If Jews in these settlements are attacked, Jews in 
Tel Aviv are not. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Jews are attacked there and Jews are 
attacked in Tel Aviv, Bat Yam, Jerusalem. 
  [Segev] I am not talking about knifings. That was a unique 
phenomenon. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Let us go back to the possible coalition 
between you and Labor. 
  [Segev] A political party should check the extent of its 
impact. Tzomet with its eight Knesset members could have made a 
difference, and the negotiations with the Palestinians would not 
look as they do today. YA'AD, with three Knesset members, 
cannot make a difference. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] So what? 
  [Segev] So the chances of my joining the coalition are 
almost nil. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] And the contacts with Nisim Zvili? 
  [Segev] There have been no contacts, except for a friendly 
chat at the 'Erev Hadash [afternoon TV program] table. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] And what about Rafi Elul? 
  [Segev] If a "shalom" in the Knesset cafeteria means 
contacts, then there have been contacts. And there are still 
contacts. What can I do if every two words in a corridor on one 
of the Knesset floors turns into "contacts" right away. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] It is a sensitive issue that interests the 
public. The health portfolio, for instance? 
  [Segev] Not true. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] One last question on this matter: If the 
faction joins the government despite everything, is it 
self-evident that of the three of you, you will be the one to 
receive a portfolio? 
  [Segev] Does it look self-evident to you? 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] It looks that way. 
  [Segev] Then I think it is self-evident to them, too. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Rumor has it that Raful is going to meet 
with Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  [Segev] If it is in line with his policy, he is welcome. It 
can be another example of his integrity. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Now Rabin can play with both of you. 
  [Segev] He will not play with me, because as I have already 
told you, I am not on the court. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] It is believed that outside the coalition, 
YA'AD will very soon become a passing episode in Israeli 
politics. On the other hand, it may be the movement's fate even 
if you do join the coalition. 
  [Segev] We have two and a half more years before the 
elections. Why should I look into the future? I believe a lot 
can be done in that time. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Do you believe in the faction's survival? 
  [Segev] It has been just six hours since we quit. We are 
one-third of the Tzomet Secretariat, and in addition, there have 
been whole branches, or nearly whole, such as the Jerusalem 
branch, the Rishon Leziyyon branch, which expressed support for 
our move. We will hold a founding convention, and then we will 
be wiser. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] When? 
  [Segev] By the end of the month. I hope more people will 
join us then. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Knesset Member Modi [Eli'ezer] Sandberg 
will definitely not join you. He has worked with you for quite 
a while, and he ended up staying in Tzomet. What happened to 
him? 
  [Segev] I cannot answer for him. I can tell you that before 
he went away, he deposited a letter with me saying that if my 
allegations are proven to be true, I have his support. What he 
decided afterward is his own business. Everyone has a different 
makeup. Both physical and mental. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Does your saying "physically different 
makeup" refer to the elasticity of his spinal column? 
  [Segev] I have not examined his spinal column. I meant that 
everyone has his own reasons. I know he came under a lot of 
pressure. I did not pressure him, I do not think pressure is 
necessary. In any event, I remain his friend. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Are you holy or what? 
  [Segev] No. But I am not mad with him. I am disappointed 
in him. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Remaining his friend? 
  [Segev] Beyond work, there is also friendship on a personal 
basis. I do not think Modi has betrayed me. I think things 
will be very tough for him in Tzomet, and if he changes his 
mind, he will have to enlist at least one more Knesset member to 
secede and move over to us. When we talked this morning I told 
him that his reconciliation attempts are pathetic. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] I was told he is a sharp lawyer with an 
ability to plan several moves in advance. Perhaps his pathetic 
reconciliation attempts are the result of his belief that you 
don't stand a chance without Raful? He even came on television 
and said that Tzomet was going to look into the matter. 
  [Segev] I heard him. Appearing on television the way he did 
and saying the things he did shows either a politician's art or 
a lawyer's craft. I just think that lying in front of the 
nation like that is a bit too early for such a young politician. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] And you remain his friend. 
  [Segev] Unless he does what he did on television that will 
change my mind about our friendship. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Is Tzomet a one man's movement? 
  [Segev] Raful's administrative techniques have caused and 
will cause it to be a one man's movement, even if the party has 
other worthy people. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] The relations between you and Raful used to 
be amicable. 
  [Segev] No. They were correct working relations. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Did he encourage your growth? 
  [Segev] I had a good position, but I did the work by myself. 
I don't know what you mean by encourage. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] I was referring to the stage when Yo'ash 
Tzidon left Tzomet and you replaced him as No. 2. 
  [Segev] He did not help me. I waged the struggle by myself. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] People in Tzomet are saying you cannot be 
No. 2 unless Raful helps you. 
  [Segev] I do not know. He may have directed some moves in 
the secretariat about which I had no knowledge. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] When did your relations begin to 
deteriorate? 
  [Segev] About a year ago, when elections to the secretariat 
were held. I received 180 out of about 230 votes. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] And then? 
  [Segev] And then people close to him claimed it is a sign 
Modi Sandberg and I wanted to take over the secretariat and 
later the movement. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] And Raful panicked? 
  [Segev] I do not know. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Then why do you think something happened at 
that time? 
  [Segev] A certain line in Raful's behavior could be detected 
then. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] What do you mean? 
  [Segev] I mean there is Raful and there are the other 
Knesset members. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] And Raful, the party leader, envied their 
success? Can you cite an example? 
  [Segev] For instance, the Gaza plan. It was an idea I 
conceived and worked on for a long time. At that time, there 
was talk about three autonomies -- Gaza, Khan Yunus, and Rafah 
-- and about increasing the Jewish population among them, plus a 
comprehensive economic plan. I presented this plan to Raful, I 
presented it to Tzomet, I even presented it to Rabin. And then 
one day I heard Raful discuss it on television, presenting the 
plan and not saying a word about who had conceived and 
formulated it. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Listen, one last question: What about the 
members of Tel 'Adashim [moshav in which both Eytan and Segev 
live]? What are they saying there? 
  [Segev] I do not know yet. So far I only had one phone call 
from there, from a man who votes Labor; he congratulated me. 
  [Ringel-Hoffman] Will there be a split? Will there be a Tel 
'Adashim B? 
  [Segev] No, it will not happen.

  [Excerpt] In the wake of Labor Secretary General Nisim 
Zvili's remarks about a Palestinian state, NRP [National 
Religious Party] and Tzomet officials said today that it is 
preferable to influence the government policy from within the 
government, rather than through demonstrations and protests. 
There is talk in these parties about joining the government 
following the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho. Minister Ya'aqov Tzur is liaising between the 
Labor and these parties. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Coalition sources say that the possibility of 
Tzomet's and the National Religious Party's [NRP] joining the 
government is not on the agenda. Minister Yosi Sarid told our 
correspondent Yo'el Nir that this is a standard ritual we go 
through whenever there are problems in the opposition or one of 
its factions. 
  Our correspondent notes that according to one of the clauses 
in the coalition agreement, Meretz is entitled to veto the 
admission of any faction into the government. 
  SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] leader Arye Der'i says he 
will examine whether the possibility of Tzomet's and the NRP's 
joining the government is serious in order to determine whether 
it is time for SHAS to rejoin the coalition.

political move to prepare in various fields for the historic 
reconciliation meeting to be held in Amman on Sunday, 20 
February, which will bring together Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. During 
the meeting, the Yemeni document of pledge and accord will be 
signed to mark the end of the political crisis and entrenchment 
of Yemeni unity. 
  Within the framework of the signing ceremony, Mujahid 
Abu-Shawarib, Yemeni deputy prime minister and head of the 
Yemeni reconciliation meeting team, arrived in Amman yesterday. 
  A high-level Yemeni media and political delegation is 
scheduled to arrive in Amman early this morning in order to 
prepare for Sunday's reconciliation meeting to be held under the 
auspices of His Majesty King Husayn. 
  The delegation is led by Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the 
Yemeni Presidential Council, and comprises members of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party's Central Committee and Political Bureau. 
  Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, head of the Yemeni Political Forces 
Dialogue Committee said that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, members of the Dialogue 
Committee, and top political and social figures representing the 
main Yemeni parties are expected to arrive in Amman on Sunday, 
20 February, in preparation for signing the accord document in 
Amman of the Arabs. 
  In a telephone conversation with AL-DUSTUR, 'Afif said that 
everything on the Yemeni side is ready, that all matters are 
proceeding in the right direction, and that all efforts are 
being made to travel to Amman on 10 Ramadan, corresponding to 20 
February, to meet with His Majesty King Husayn and to sign the 
document. 
  'Afif reiterated the Yemeni people's eagerness to maintain 
their unity, stability, and security. He noted that unity 
exists and that it is the right of the Yemeni people, who insist 
on maintaining this unity whatever the circumstances. 
  'Afif said that His Majesty King Husayn's role has greatly 
helped reconcile the parties and restore amity due to the great 
respect and appreciation the Yemeni president, vice president, 
and all the Yemeni people have for his majesty. [passage

  [Text] The Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Committee has 
concluded its two-day meeting in Amman. The Jordanian side was 
led by Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of 
higher education, while the Palestinian side was led by Faruq 
Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department. Following the 
end of the talks, the two sides issued a press statement 
reviewing the subjects the committee discussed. Details are in 
the following report from our correspondent Khalil al-Qaryuti: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Qaryuti] The two sides expressed their 
satisfaction with the atmosphere of understanding that prevailed 
in the meetings -- an atmosphere that will enhance coordination 
between the two sides, as well as efforts to improve it in 
various areas, because such coordination represents a realistic 
response to the special historic and fated relationship of the 
two peoples. Following the meetings, a press statement was read 
by Yasir 'Abd- Rabbuh, member of the PLO Executive Committee and 
head of the PLO's Information Department. 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] The committee reviewed the points listed on 
its 
agenda. These covered issues of bilateral and Arab concern in 
order to promote overall cooperation and coordination between 
the Jordanian and Palestinian sides to the required level in all 
areas. The committee reviewed recent overall developments 
pertaining to the peace process, including the agreement signed 
by the PLO and Israel in Cairo on 9 February, which is a basic 
step toward implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement that 
represents the first part of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration 
of Principles. 
  The committee discussed future prospects and the concept of 
joint action in light of expected developments in order to 
formulate a unified Arab vision and to take the initiative in 
the service of the Arab nation's goals and its aspirations for a 
comprehensive, just, and lasting peace, based on the resolutions 
of international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace. 
This should guarantee Israel's total withdrawal from all 
occupied Arab territories and secure the Palestinian people's 
legitimate national rights on their national soil. 
  The committee attached special importance to the status of 
Jerusalem. It stressed the need to carry out programs to 
reinforce the Arabic and Islamic character of the city, to 
confront Israel's attempts to Judaize and devour it, and to 
protect its sanctities. The committee studied the 
recommendations of its working teams on economic, security, and 
administrative issues. It stressed the need to draw up specific 
mechanisms to enable cooperation and coordination in the peace 
process by making preparations, exchanging information, and 
continuing consultations on all tracks of the bilateral and 
multilateral negotiations, within the framework of the 
directives of the Jordanian and Palestinian political leaders in 
order to serve the interests of the Jordanian and Palestinian 
peoples and their distinguished relationship. 
  The committee adopted an agenda for the meetings of its 
subcommittees, including the Jerusalem committee, the economic 
committee, the security and borders committee, the committee on 
refugees and displaced people, and the legal committee, and also 
for the meetings of some specialized technical committees, which 
were stipulated in the economic agreement signed by the 
Jordanian Government and the PLO Executive Committee on 7 
January 1994. The two sides decided to form an administrative 
affairs committee. They stressed the need to coordinate Arab 
positions, particularly those between the cordon states, 
regarding bilateral negotiations. 
  [Al-Qaryuti] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for 
cabinet affairs and information minister, then responded to 
questions from a number of journalists: 
  [Al-'Anani] We have agreed to coordinate our positions. We 
stressed the need for each side to respect what is taking place 
on any other fraternal Arab track of negotiations because we, in 
the final analysis, are seeking a comprehensive peace solution. 
What takes place on one negotiating track will certainly affect 
the other negotiating tracks. 
  [Al-Qaryuti] Responding to a question on the economic 
agreement, the Jordanian-Palestinian economic committee, and the 
issue of reopening Jordanian banks in Gaza Strip and Jericho, 
Dr. al-'Anani said: 
  [Al-'Anani] You know that the economic agreement stipulates 
the formation of a technical economic committee and a joint 
banking committee, which we also call a joint monetary banking 
committee. The Jordanian side named the committee members. We 
expect the brothers to name their members, too. We expect the 
committee to begin its meetings next week. We, in Jordan, are 
ready for the process. I believe the Palestinian side is also 
ready to reopen the Jordanian banks' branches in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. [end recording]

Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, a member of the Jordanian team, 
responded to questions from journalists on the committee 
meetings. Responding to a question on a Jerusalem committee, 
al-'Anani said: 
  [Al-'Anani] We had to confront what is taking place in 
Jerusalem and to discuss the Palestinian side's ability to 
negotiate it. Therefore, we agreed that the issue of Jerusalem 
is a major and sensitive one. It deserves a specialized 
committee to follow up all aspects of this subject and to try to 
prevent what is taking place inside the city, such as the 
erosion of property inside the walls and the growing settlement 
process in and around it. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Jordanian-Palestinian Talks Are </F>
Successful"] 
  [Text] The multilateral Jordanian-Palestinian talks 
witnessed in Amman during the past three days have revived 
coordination between the two sides. This is due to the fact 
that these talks dealt with practical issues and outlined the 
features of future relations between Jordan and the Palestinian 
self-rule during the interim period. 
  It seems that the high level Jordanian-Palestinian talks 
went 
beyond headlines and into details. This is a wide practical 
step toward reinforcing coordination between the two fraternal 
peoples. 
  These talks and their results acquire their importance from 
the fact that they coincided with the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations and came after the signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli security agreement. 
  We hope that these talks tackled vital political, economic, 
trade, and security issues in a manner that forms the basis for 
frank and clear future relations between Jordan and the 
Palestinian self-rule. 
  Based on statements by Jordanian and Palestinian officials 
taking part in the talks, it is clear that these talks were 
crowned with success. This affirms that the two sides enjoy a 
spirit of responsibility and believe in a joint future of 
brotherly relations between the two fraternal people. 
  It is noteworthy that the emphasis placed on the need to 
implement programs to enhance the Arab Islamic character of holy 
Jerusalem is an important practical step and an accomplishment 
that deserves to be appreciated 
  Moreover, agreement to continue serious coordination and 
cooperation on the level of the peace process shows how aware 
the two sides are of the need to reinforce the Palestinian 
negotiating position. 
  In any case, the brotherly talks between Jordan and the 
Palestinian delegation within the higher committee were 
successful. If coordination and cooperation between the two 
parties continues throughout the course of the peace process, 
this will be useful to both parties and to national and pan-Arab 
issues as well.

  [Text] The formation of a Jordanian popular committee for 
the resistance of submission to and normalization with the 
Zionist enemy was announced yesterday. The decision to form the 
committee was announced at the end of a meeting held at the 
headquarters of the Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party on 27 
January 1994. Seventy-five political, party, and independent 
key figures attended the meeting at the invitation of the 
nationalist Jordanian political parties. After several 
meetings, the temporary committee agreed on the final draft of 
regulations and bylaws. These will be presented to the general 
committee for approval and implementation. 
  In a statement issued yesterday, the temporary committee 
demanded the formation of a broad Jordanian popular movement, 
including all those who stand against the agreements of 
submission and normalization with the Zionist enemy, to work as 
one team to secure the success of the confrontation plan which 
expresses the Arab Jordanian people's rejection of capitulation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali </F>
by Philip Finnigan of Washington DEFENSE NEWS; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Finnigan] What was your reaction when you learned 
that the United States will allow Israel to purchase the 
advanced F-15E aircraft? 
  [Al-Majali] Very regrettably and unfortunately Israel has 
succeeded in convincing the U.S. decisionmakers that the only 
road to peace lies in giving it the upper hand. This is wrong. 
When you give people more power they become obstinate in the 
quest for peace. The balance is currently largely tilted in 
favor of Israel. We feel uneasy when Israel obtains 
sophisticated weapons at a time when we do not have even the 
basic requirements to defend ourselves. Peace is for all and 
not for one single state. 
  [Finnigan] Do you think Israel is still the main danger 
threatening Jordan? 
  [Al-Majali] Yes, indeed, only because it forced out all 
those 
Palestinian refugees and evacuees and imposed them on us. 
Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have not at all felt that way. 
  [Finnigan] You mean that Israel's threat to Jordan stems 
from 
the activities which might lead to instability in Jordan rather 
than from a direct attack on Jordan. 
  [Al-Majali] Quite right. I do not think the world will allow 
any state to attack Jordan, but there are no guarantees and you 
do not know everything. 
  [Finnigan] I know that Israel raised one issue at the peace 
talks, that is, holding joint exercises with Jordan. 
  [Al-Majali] How can we hold joint exercises with them while 
they are still occupying our land? What shall I do if I have 
problems regarding water resources that were seized by Israel? 
This is premature. You have to be very friendly with another 
state before you can conduct exercises, and exercises with 
Israel against who, Saudi Arabia or Egypt? One has to be 
realistic. Time will come, as was the case with France and 
Germany, when we can work together for the creation of one army. 
However, one should not jump to this subject all of a sudden. 
  [Finnigan] What about confidence-building measures like 
aerial reconnaissance sorties? 
  [Al-Majali] Why should we fly over Israel or vice versa? 
Trust should come first. When the basic problems are solved, 
normalization will follow. The basic problems should first be 
solved. 
  [Finnigan] What will peace mean for Jordan militarily? 
  [Al-Majali] The number of our Armed Forces personnel, 
compared with the population, is one of the highest in the world 
due to our location. This creates financial problems and 
burdens. This is partly due to the fact that we have not only 
protected Jordan, but maintained stability in the region for a 
long time. Peace does not mean that you get rid of the army; 
peace requires guards and people to protect it. 
  [Finnigan] Obviously you will need to purchase or procure 
new 
capabilities designed specifically to improve your ability to 
combat terrorism. Does this mean you will be forced to spend 
more on armament? 
  [Al-Majali] Dangers after peace are not less than the 
post-war dangers. People's expectations will rise and will have 
an impact on security. Therefore, you have to have a strong and 
well-trained army to deal with this situation. Some tasks 
should be changed as necessary, and this does not last for ever. 
When peace prevails and is firmly entrenched in the region, 
there will be no need for large armed forces. 
  [Finnigan] What should the United States do to support your 
armed forces? 
  [Al-Majali] I hope the United States will care for us as it 
does for other states and create a sound balance of power. We 
need the United States' assistance to refurbish the armed forces 
and provide training as it is doing for other states. 
  [Finnigan] What sort of military hardware does Jordan need 
from the United States? 
  [Al-Majali] Basic things to defend ourselves like ammunition 
for training and spare parts. 
  [Finnigan] What is the importance of relieving Jordan of 
its debts, particularly the military debts? 
  [Al-Majali] We owe debts, mostly military, to the United 
States, Britain, France, and other European countries. We hope 
to be treated in the same way as other states. We expect a 
balanced consideration of these matters in order to write off 
these debts. We do not conceive a stable peace between Israel 
and Jordan or Israel and the neighboring states in the presence 
of debts. 
  [Finnigan] Should Jordan be treated the way Israel and Egypt 
are treated? 
  [Al-Majali] I think so. We are peace partners. The matter 
is not one of size, but geographic location. It is a matter of 
confidence. Jordan has built confidence throughout the past 
years. 
  [Finnigan] How can the U.S. reponse be described thus far? 
  [Al-Majali] Unfortunately, what is given to Jordan is a drop 
in the ocean when compared with what is given to Israel. It is 
very little, less than 5 percent of what is given to Israel. 
  [Finnigan] Is there a relaxation in ties with some Gulf 
states? 
  [Al-Majali] Yes, there has been a change in ties with the 
United Arab Emirates and Qatar although such a change is still 
difficult with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. We still say we were 
misunderstood during the Gulf crisis. We are against occupation 
by any party, but we sought to end this occupation through the 
Arabs themselves without any foreign assistance. We were 
misunderstood and were depicted as if we stood beside the 
attacking forces although we did not do so. 
  [Finnigan] Saudi Arabia has asked for a public apology. Is 
this acceptable to Jordan? 
  [Al-Majali] The Jordanian Government would have to make a 
mistake before it could apologize. We did not undertake any 
action to harm Saudi Arabia or the other Gulf states. 
  [Finnigan] The Kuwaiti officials say Jordan has not accepted 
the Kuwait-Iraq borders as delineated by the United Nations. 
  [Al-Majali] We have not at all accepted borders between any 
other two states. The issue of borders is their own affair. 
Have we recognized the old borders? This is an issue between 
two neighbors. 
  [Finnigan] Do the cool relations with Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait 
place considerable hurdles in the way of creating Jordanian 
rapid deployment forces? 
  [Al-Majali] Yes, indeed. How can rapid deployment forces 
operate if these two states are closed to them. We believe that 
Arab reconciliation should come as soon as possible. The 
absence of reconciliation will harm us all. If Jordan was 
unstable, the entire region would be unstable. 
  [Finnigan] This means the formation of Jordanian rapid 
forces 
will need more years? 
  [Al-Majali] Yes, we are prepared and we continue to train 
our 
forces. We hope that these forces will be formed in good time 
once reconciliation is realized.

  [Text] Gentlemen: No sooner had the negotiators returned 
to the bilateral negotiating halls in Washington than Israel 
began to replay its broken record, reiterating its repetitive 
demands. These demands have either obstructed or provoked a 
stalemate in the negotiations since they began as a series of 
rounds more than two years ago. This is also happening in the 
new format, which is meant to serve as a prelude for more rounds 
and is confined to the heads of the delegations. 
  Negotiations in the new format stopped for two weeks at 
Israel's request. This gave the impression that Israel might 
change its negative position. But no sooner had the 
negotiations resumed than Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
began to play the same old tune -- played earlier by Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres -- of calling for secret talks, upgrading 
the level of the talks, and spelling out the concept of peace. 
This confirms in advance that Israel does not have any serious 
desire to see the Washington talks reach positive results. 
  Rabin knows all attempts to hold public or secret talks with 
Syria will fail. His recent insistence on this confirms that 
Israel is still determined to defeat the formula that is the 
basis of the Madrid peace conference and the peace talks, 
evading the foundations of a just, comprehensive solution in the 
region. Israel plans to do this by taking on the Arab parties 
one at a time, as it did with the secret Oslo talks. 
  The Arab parties went to the Madrid conference and the 
Washington talks in order to achieve a just, comprehensive peace 
in the region, based on the implementation of Security Council 
resolutions. Throughout the past 12 rounds, the Arab parties 
have emphasized that peace cannot be achieved without Israeli 
withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories. 
  On the eve of the resumption of the bilateral talks in 
Washington, Rabin has reiterated his preconditions about what he 
calls Syria's spelling out the concept of peace. Obviously, 
Rabin's aim behind this is to obstruct and prolong the talks, 
keeping them spinning in a vicious circle to deflect them from 
their desired goal. 
  Since the Madrid conference, Syria has emphasized its desire 
for, and efforts to achieve, a firm, lasting peace in the Middle 
East. This peace is founded on the exchange of land for peace. 
During the sixth round of the Washington talks, Syria presented 
a paper based on the relevant resolutions of international 
legitimacy. Israel, however, is still evading the Madrid 
formula and the comprehensiveness of the solution. Israel 
refuses to declare its willingness to withdraw from the occupied 
Arab territories. 
  Syria, through President Hafiz al-Asad, said in Geneva that 
peace is not a transitional aim, but a strategic option. This 
clear, unequivocal Syrian position was welcomed and appreciated 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the world at large. Israel 
alone is still trying to circumvent the results of the Geneva 
summit. 
  Israel is mistaken if it thinks that it can impose its 
conditions and continue to adopt a hard-line, inflexible 
approach, maneuvering, casting doubts, and double-dealing. 
These methods are now exposed to the whole world and will only 
pass up the current peace opportunity, on which the Arabs and 
the world pin great hopes for a just, comprehensive peace in the 
region.

  [Text] Under the headline "The Israeli Illusion," 
AL-THAWRAH writes: The Washington talks have resumed on the 
level of the heads of delegations amid discouraging atmospheres. 
Israel is still barricading itself behind its futile ideas and 
continues to put spokes in the wheel of the peace process. 
  The paper stresses that Israel is not only avoiding decisive 
answers on the substance of the peace process regarding the 
question of complete withdrawal, but also proposes absurd ideas, 
which constitute an attempt to escape forward. This is 
especially the case after it was pushed into a difficult dilemma 
by the Syrian position and the Geneva summit. Israel now does 
not have the chance to avoid, for very long, these answers. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Despite the ability it was 
provided by the Oslo and Cairo agreements with the PLO to 
promote separate solutions, Israel will be very mistaken if it 
thinks it can subjugate Syria and the other tracks to separate 
deals which it can tailor to fit its economic, military, 
political, and security interests. Peace, as Syria has always 
said, must be just and comprehensive or else there will be no 
peace.

  [Text] Under the headline "Where Does Israeli Rulers' 
Problem Lie?," AL-BA'TH says: Ironically, the Israeli rulers 
continue to compete in talking about peace and in devising 
words, terms, and slogans on peace without this meaning any real 
thing related to working for the sake of peace. Regardless of 
their various party or other affiliations, the Israeli rulers -- 
starting with Ben-Gurion and up to Yitzhaq Rabin -- have always 
talked about peace while launching wars and embarking on 
invasions, aggressions, and occupation. For many years, and 
while committing some of the ugliest massacres and expelling 
hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, they were always talking 
about peace. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Under the pretext of deterring the alleged 
threat, the Israeli rulers expanded in land and usurped all the 
territory set by the UN resolution of 1947 to the Palestinian 
state. Their occupation extended to cover territory from three 
Arab states -- Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria. 
  The paper adds: Under the pretext of deterring the alleged 
threat, the Israeli rulers also attempted to realize their 
aggressive dream to set up a greater Israel that would control 
the Middle East. 
  The paper says: Syria has exposed the true Israeli rulers' 
negative attitudes toward the peace process. Syria proposed 
complete peace for complete withdrawal. It followed that with 
President al-Asad's initiative in Geneva on Syria's readiness to 
respond favorably to all requirements of the complete peace. 
  The paper stresses that Syria wants the just and 
comprehensive peace that carries within it the elements for its 
continuity and survival. Such a peace is not based on 
injustice, occupation, and violation of international 
legitimacy. Any one who wants such a peace will undoubtedly 
meet with Syria. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Those who do not want peace 
can fabricate excuses and allegations every day to escape peace. 
The Israeli rulers are doing just that. Their problem lies in 
themselves. They think they can continue to escape the 
requirements of the peace process and continue both with the 
occupation and settlements activities.

  [Text] Under the headline "The Deal of Concessions and 
Relinquishment," TISHRIN writes: The Cairo deal reveals further 
concessions by the Palestinian party. It also reveals that 
Israel made further gains as a result of this deal, which 
threatens the conditions of our Palestinian Arab people inside 
and outside the occupied homeland. 
  The paper adds: This, of course, did not come as a surprise. 
What is founded on wrong will lead to wrong, and what branches 
from mistakes will lead to further damage and harm. 
  The paper stresses that the Oslo agreement was a stab in the 
back of the Palestine question, constituted a major violation of 
the Palestinian people's rights, and dealt a strong blow to the 
ingredients of the just and comprehensive peace. 
  The paper says: Events and developments have confirmed these 
facts beyond any doubt. The Cairo deal, which discussed the 
measures and details of the Oslo Agreement, clearly gave Israel 
full control of the occupied territories and gave the occupation 
troops the right to absolute control over the security issues, 
passages, and roads in Gaza and Jericho. The Cairo deal allowed 
Israel to achieve its aggressive objective; that is, not to 
return land to its Palestinian owners. Israel also guaranteed 
that no Palestinian will be allowed to return to his land and 
property. 
  The paper wonders: What kind of peace is that which the 
signatories of the Cairo agreement claim is approaching, when, 
according to that peace, the owners of the land are denied the 
right to return to their land and those who were expelled and 
deported from their land will be denied the right to enjoy 
living on it in tranquility and security. 
  The paper says: The kind of peace which Israel is trying to 
promote is the peace of occupation and occupiers that is made at 
the expense of Arab lands and rights. 
  The paper concludes by saying: Agreements such as the Oslo 
and Cairo agreements will not achieve the desired peace because 
they constitute a surrender, a concession, and a relinquishment. 
The Palestinian people will never accept that.

  [Text] At 1200 today, the Central Command of the National 
Progressive Front [NPF] held a meeting under Dr. Muhammad Zuhayr 
Mashariqah, vice president and vice chairman of the NPF. 
  At the outset, the Central Command members observed a minute 
of silence in honor of the departed son of the homeland and the 
people, Staff Major Basil al-Asad. 
  Dr. Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah then spoke about Basil 
al-Asad's noble traits and good character. The Central Command 
members also praised Basil al-Asad's traits, which made the 
people love him. They noted that the people are sad on the 
departure of the knight, who embodied, during his lifetime, the 
genuine values upheld by President al-Asad. 
  The Central Command also listened to a political report 
presented by Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. The foreign 
minister reviewed the latest political developments in the Arab, 
regional, and international arenas, as well as contacts made on 
several issues related to these developments. 
  The Central Command discussed the current political 
situation 
and Israel's attempts to circumvent the important political 
results of the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton, especially with regard to the peace 
process. It viewed such attempts as a continuation of Israel's 
policy that is based on undermining the peace process by 
violating the principles and rules of this process, primarily 
implementing UN resolutions, adopting the principles of 
international legitimacy, and Israeli withdrawal from all 
occupied Arab territories.

  [Text] Gentlemen: Israel continues to play southern 
Lebanon like a card in a game of extortion. Sometimes, it 
offers to bargain over its occupation of this part of Lebanese 
territory in return for imposing its terms on Lebanon. At other 
times, it meets the Lebanese rejection of its terms with 
occasional, unwarranted military escalations. Today's and 
recent threats by military and political Israeli leaders to 
launch a large-scale aggression against southern Lebanon on the 
pretext of retaliating for the acts of Lebanese resistance are 
no exception to this rule. The latest threats are linked to a 
katyusha rocket which Israel claims fell in northern Galilee. 
According to Israeli allegations, that incident constituted a 
violation of an implicit agreement that followed its aggression 
against southern Lebanon nearly six months ago. 
  We do not believe that there is any need to pause to refute 
Israel's allegations about the existence or nonexistence of 
implicit agreements or anything of the sort. However, in this 
regard, it is ironic that while Israel claims that it views the 
incident as a grave violation of an alleged implicit agreement, 
it pays no attention to the basic and existing violation of a 
resolution issued by the highest international legitimate 
institution condemning Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon 
and demanding an immediate end to this occasion. Specifically, 
this resolution is UN Security Council Resolution No. 425. The 
alleged katyusha rocket incident is now being blown out of 
proportion in a manner that heralds the possibility of having 
this incident turn into a pretext to launch a comprehensive 
aggression. This would follow the example of previous incidents 
which were used as pretexts for launching large-scale Israeli 
attacks against Lebanon. 
  Israel's motives behind exploding the situation in southern 
Lebanon are clear. After its apparent failure to politically 
circumvent the results of the Geneva summit--which brought about 
a Syrian-U.S. understanding that stresses the constants of 
peace--Israel is now resorting to military means, hoping it 
would be more effective in producing such a result. In other 
words, Israel wants a way out from the bottleneck into which it 
has been pushed after that summit and to evade the requirements 
that it has to meet in view of the continued negotiations in 
Washington, even at the level of chief delegates. Israel is 
also engaged in repeated attempts to shirk the Madrid formula 
and calls for secret negotiations and other known Israeli 
demands. 
  Therefore, the Israeli media's exaggeration of the katyusha 
incident speaks of serious aggressive intentions that threaten 
to torpedo not only the political achievements of the Geneva 
summit, but also the peace process as a whole. We do not 
believe that anyone in the world doubts Israel's responsibility 
for the current escalation in the south. This escalation is a 
result of its continued occupation of that part of the Lebanese 
territory and of its recent escalation of artillery and air 
strikes against various Lebanese villages and townships. The 
real danger does not lie in a katyusha rocket falling in 
northern Galilee, but in the continued occupation and the 
continued Israeli attacks on Lebanese lives and property. 
  If Israel really wishes to put an end to the bloody cycle of 
violence in southern Lebanon, this can be achieved through the 
current negotiations in Washington. These negotiations provide 
the best means to find a solution to the situation not only in 
the south, but also on all fronts of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
This will be possible only if Israel decides to abide by the 
principles and bases without which no just, comprehensive peace 
can be established; namely, the land-for-peace principle and 
compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  Military escalation cannot be curbed by threatening to blow 
up the situation and turn matters upside down, but by exploiting 
the chance provided by the Washington negotiations to establish 
peace. Whoever wants to see things explode evidently wants to 
bury the negotiations, irrespective of any empty talk about 
peace, and does not want peace to prevail in this turbulent and 
war-torn region.

<F P=106> [Address by "brother leader of the revolution" Colonel </F>
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi to preachers, teachers, and students of 
Arabic and Islamic studies on 15 February; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We have told them that it was 
impossible for someone to hand over his sons to his enemy. 
However, there is a condition: should there be an Islamic 
court, with an Islamic jury, before which Libyans could stand, 
then, as far as I am concerned, whether this court is set up in 
Britain, America, France, Egypt, or Malta, the venue would not 
matter any longer. As long as we have put a condition that an 
Islamic court would be better, whether it is in the center of 
Britain or America, this would be better. If the judges are 
Muslims, and prosecution is Muslim, and where the court opens 
its session with Koran recitation, then we would accept it. 
[cheers] Should there be a court like this which meets this 
condition, then, I will consider it an historical action, and we 
will not mind whether they [the suspects] be given a capital 
punishment. This would not matter; what matters is that an 
historical event, a historical turning point would have taken 
place. 
  As Muslims, our condition, regardless of Scotland or Britain 
because this is an international issue, is that the court is a 
Muslim one. We do not mind the venue of the trial as long as 
the judges are Muslim and as long as the court opens session 
with Koran recitation. [passage omitted] Let us expose them and 
confirm their hostility to Islam by letting them face this test 
and this court. [passage omitted] 
  Libya is flying the flag of Islam and the flag of struggle 
and the holy war. It is inconceivable that the position of 
Libya should be similar to that of any submissive state, which 
receives orders from Paris, Washington, London, and Tel Aviv. 
No way. 
  I would like to set up a significant group that should bear 
this burden and put up with this holy war in the month of 
Ramadan. You should go and meet Shah Mas`ud, Rabbani, and 
Hekmatyar. Libya should be the one to end this fighting between 
Muslims. Anybody who refuses to halt the war, Libya should send 
forces to fight him in accordance with the Koran. [passage 
omitted] 
  We should implement this verse and announce that anybody who 
disobeys, we should fight him in accordance to what God has 
decreed. Either I select a group from you, or you choose one, to 
go, with my permission, to meet those brothers of ours. Libya 
should be the one responsible for finding a solution to the 
issue of Afghanistan. These are Muslims who are killing one 
another during this holy month of Ramadan; children and women 
are killed; mosques are being destroyed and cities demolished, 
torture is everywhere, it is Satan who now rules Afghanistan. 
  It is the Christians, nonbelievers, and Jews who are behind 
this war. This situation is similar to the one when Iraq and 
Iran declared war against one another. The United States used 
to supply Iraq with arms, exactly as did Israel with Iran. You 
have seen this; and this has been proven in full view of the 
whole world. Can you imagine this? The United States and the 
Israelis, who are two heads of the same spear, decided to arm 
Iraq and Iran. What is important to them is that Muslims should 
be annihilated. Even these days, they are plotting against 
Afghanistan, and they are arming each side. 
  We should not arm each side; we should bring reconciliation 
against them, and anybody who refuses to do so, we should send 
forces to fight them. This is what the Koran decreed, and we 
should implement what the Koran says; this has been tried before. 
  Even the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina should not be left to 
the Christians. There is a republic called Bosnia-Herzegovina 
that should become independent. The talk about 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is but a political issue, the real issue is 
the annihilation of Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which 
represents a crusading war. We should expose this war. We are 
friends of the Yugoslavs, the Serbs. The Orthodox doctrine of 
Russia and Serbia is close in nature to Islam. 
  It is anti-Catholic and anti-protestant. However, now there 
is an agreement and a plot in which the Orthodox doctrine finds 
itself in opposition to Islam. There is an anti-Islamic plot 
which, in addition to Bosnia-Herzegovina, will also affect 
Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Turkey, and then the Arab world. 
Consequently, a new crusading war will be declared. 
  We Libyans should also send delegations to Yugoslavia. We 
should tell them that you Serbs have been our friends since 
Tito's days, the Orthodox doctrine is similar to Islam; you 
should not fall into the plot of the Catholics, the Protestants, 
the Christians, and the Israelis. The issue of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is one thing, where as the annihilation of 
Muslims in Bosnia is another thing. We are against the 
annihilation of Muslims; we should stand by them in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. As for the political war, i.e the 
independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, border demarcation, etc., 
this is another issue that relates to all republics of the 
former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] 
  A delegation should go to Somalia to meet Aydid, Ali Mahdi, 
and the president of the Somali land in the north. We must 
reach a solution. We should implement on them what has been 
implemented in Afghanistan. We should send forces, not America. 
Libya should send forces which fight against the side which 
rejects reconciliation. [passage omitted] 
  Britain and America are taking revenge against Egypt by 
dividing it into two or more countries. Where do you think this 
trend came from? Who told Iraq to invade Kuwait? It was 
America. America told Iraq that because Iraq waged war against 
Khomeyni, we [the United States] would give you Kuwait. He 
[Saddam Husayn] believed this and invaded Kuwait. Once this was 
done, they came and destroyed Iraq. 
  Who set fire to 100 oil wells? It was not Iraq. It was the 
West and America, which for imperialist reasons, set fire to the 
Kuwaiti wells. Because Iraq was defeated, it admitted it did 
so. He [Saddam Husayn] did not do this. It was America which 
burned the Kuwaiti oil. 
  We are saying that should the Kuwaiti and the Saudi 
independence depend on the American forces, then this is a false 
independence. They would be better off uniting with Iraq, which 
they are fearing, or Yemen, rather than having their 
independence dependent on the presence of foreign forces. 
[passage omitted] 
  We hope that our brothers in Saudi Arabia recover their 
senses and do not prevent the Libyan pilgrims to go by air to 
Mecca. This would be a disaster. Last year, the Libyan 
pilgrims defied them and went to Jerusalem as long as Mecca is 
occupied. It would have been the same, Jerusalem is occupied 
and so is Mecca. I am worried a delegation of Libyan pilgrims, 
if prevented from going to Mecca, would go to the Vatican in 
defiance of Saudi Arabia or the Arabs. This could happen. 
[passage omitted] 
  We must announce our sympathy to the Kurdish nation. It has 
got the right to unity and liberation. We want it to be a 
sister nation which has got its position in the near east along 
the other Islamic nations, the Arab, Turkish, and Persian ones. 
[passage omitted] 
  How come the Christian interfere in the business of the Shia 
and the sunnis? How can the U.S. ambassador reconcile between 
Sanaa and Aden? Is it logical to see a Christian reconcile 
among the Muslims, solve their problems, send their forces, 
protect Muslims and their mosques. For us this is unacceptable. 
This is our revolution, this is the true holy war for which we 
were born and for which we are prepared to die. [passage omitted] 
  Libya defies the Christians and the Jews will which harm 
Islamic sanctities, the dignity and honor of Islam. We defy 
them even if we have to sacrifice millions of people; it will 
not matter because this is a historic battle.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 10 February 
issue of Cairo AL-USRAH AL-`ARABIYAH summarizes articles that 
are Islamic in nature. 
<H5>  National Dialogue Conditions Given </H5>
  Engineer Abu-al-'Ula Madi Abu-al-'Ula, moderator of the 
professional associations Coordinating Committee, has reportedly 
affirmed that the Muslim Brothers must be able to represent 
themselves at the national dialogue conference due to be held in 
April. He said that the associations that belong to the Islamic 
trend will participate in the national dialogue. Meanwhile, a 
recommendation from the professional associations' fifth annual 
conference on the national dialogue has reportedly stipulated 
that all political forces, such as other national parties and 
trends, must participate in the dialogue and that participation 
should not be limited to political parties alone, because they 
do not represent all the political forces in Egypt. 
  Demands from the conference included: guarantees of fair 
elections and amendments to the Constitution or a new 
constitution within the context of preserving the "nation's 
identity," direct elections for president of the republic, the 
restoration of the Committee of al-Azhar's senior ulema, the 
setting up an Islamic market to counter world economic blocs, 
and the rejection of the Middle East market suggested by Israel. 
It was also recommended that: the Egyptian Government adhere to 
a political policy committed to Islam, the government's 
political decision making both internally and abroad be 
independent of the new world order, the Palestinian issue be 
regarded as an Islamic cause, and that the Arab boycott of 
Israel continue. The conference also called for: confrontation 
of "attempts" to separate southern Sudan from the north, 
abrogation of treaties signed with countries that "persecute 
their Muslim citizens," and denying that there is a threat to 
Sudan from neighboring Islamic countries Libya and Iran. 
<H5>  Anti-Islam Campaign in Italy Claimed </H5>
  The Egyptian community in Italy has reportedly denounced the 
"malicious campaign against Islam" launched by an Italian mayor. 
The mayor, in a television interview, allegedly launched a 
"malicious attack on Islam, the Koran, and the Prophet, accusing 
Islam of being against coexistence with other religions." The 
Islamic community denounced this "aggression" and [said] that 
Arab and Islamic embassies and Islamic personalities have been 
requested to complain about that mayor. 
<H5>  Minister Attacks Extremists </H5>
  Education Minister Dr. Husayn Kamil Baha'-al-Din reportedly 
remarked at the International Book Fair that most of the experts 
at the Egyptian Education Curricula Development Center are 
Americans, who may include American Jews, but that they entered 
Egypt as U.S. citizens. The minister noted that it is 
unimportant whether an expert is a Jew or not. The education 
minister "launched a fierce attack on the Islamists who had 
exposed the methods used in developing the curricula and 
obliterating the Islamic identity from the curricula." The 
minister reportedly threatened to kick "all those who are 
extremists" out of the education system and to transfer them to 
administrative jobs. 
<H5>  Book Fair Described as "Attack on Islam" </H5>
  The Cairo International Book Fair was noted to have ended 
with a "blatant attack by secularists on Islam and the Muslims 
through its books and periodicals." The Books Committee 
reportedly displayed books banned by "judicial decrees, reports 
from al-Azhar, and the State Prosecutor." It was also noted: 
"What is strange is that the committee chairman insisted on 
displaying obscene and prohibited books under the guise of 
freedom of thought and enlightenment." The "Islamic role was 
downplayed" in the fair's seminars and the fair's guests "were 
full of hatred and abused Islam and defamed its shari'ah, 
especially the wearing of the veil and religiousness, and 
accused the Islamists of extremism and terrorism." Jamal 
al-Ghitani was quoted, saying: "The danger to Egyptian culture 
is not from abroad; it emanates from the present Islamic trend, 
which must be uprooted." ROSE AL-YUSUF writer 'Abd-al-Sattar 
al-Tawilah reportedly raised the serious point that Egypt will 
not be "religious and will forever remain secular." Prominent 
writer Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal was also cited as acknowledging 
that the Islamic trend is "popular everywhere" and that this 
confirms the success of its propagation. 
<H5>  Muslim Marital Relations Treated </H5>
  Writer Dr. Ahmad al-Majdub discussed husband-wife relations 
and criticized divorced Muslm women who blame their "backward" 
husbands for the divorce in an article entitled "What Are They 
Plotting for the Muslim Family?" He said: "Secular and 
communist men do not waste the chances of the women who fail in 
their marital life, not because of Islam's divorce system but 
because of their claim to be liberal and conduct that runs 
against values and traditions." He also said that he has often 
asked such women what religion has to do with the failure of 
their family life, telling them: "Disputes broke out between you 
and your husband because of reasons that, from your point of 
view, make it hard to continue the marriage, such as your 
insistence on having male friends with whom you deal as if you 
were male or as if they were female. When your husbands 
protest, you revolt against them and accuse them of being 
reactionary, inflexible, backward, suspicious, and unconfident." 
<H5>  Can Islam and Development Coexist? </H5>
  The National Planning Institute's fifth seminar on "the 
international and regional challenges that will face the Arab 
world in the next century" reportedly ended last week with its 
most heated of the seminar's five sessions in which Dr. Mustafa 
al-Faqi, head of the Diplomatic Institute in Cairo, gave a 
lecture on the "Islamic culture and its failure to bring about a 
minimum measure of development" and demanded that Arab 
constitutions apply "secularism" to confront the impending 
challenges in the 21st Century "by excluding Islamic tenets and 
sanctities [al- muqaddasat]" from these debates. At one point, 
Al-Faqi said that Islam is the "historic event that led to 
Egypt's Arabism" and that, had it not been for Islam, 
civilization would not have emerged. Al-Faqi reportedly 
transformed the hall's gloomy atmosphere when he said: "I do 
not hold the Koran unless I sense a danger. For example, when I 
am flying in an airplane and feel it shaking, I hurry to open 
the Koran to the al-Waqi'ah chapter, because I cannot fool 
myself." 
  Dr. al-Faqi admitted that religion in Egypt and the Arab 
world is "seasonal" and is like the weather, running cold and 
hot, calm and then stormy, leading to "extremism and terrorism," 
which is what we are suffering now. He also said: "Islam is 
like a historical myth that we use to explain the unknown and it 
no longer has the required role in our life and problems." 
  Dr. Milad Hanna, an Egyptian Christian college professor, 
was 
cited as saying that Egyptians -- both Muslims and Copts -- must 
unite to confront the "impending challenges, because they are 
more dangerous than those of any other stage." He added that 
Pope Shinudah memorizes the Koran and that al-Azhar's shaykh 
knows a great deal about the Bible. Hanna reportedly blamed al- 
Azhar's shaykh for not memorizing the Bible, saying: "Muslims 
cannot face such challenges on their own. What would happen if 
the Muslim and the Copts cooperated and the so-called faith was 
abrogated? For we are facing an industrial, economic war, not 
an ideological or an interdenominational war." 
  The conference reportedly concluded as usual with 
resolutions 
and recommendations, but with the remaining questions: "Is it 
possible to have development without political and religious 
factors having a role in it?" "Is religion, as Dr. al-Faqi 
indicates, no longer fit for modern life and the serious changes 
it is experiencing?" It is also asked: If communism has 
collapsed at the hands of its people and capitalism is "fighting 
its fiercest battles for survival now that it is plagued with a 
moral breakup and chaos, why does Islam have no chance to have 
its say?" "Does shari'ah hamper progress and advancement?" 
<H5>  Islamic Education Discussed </H5>
  Muhammad Mahdi 'Akif, chairman of the Islamic Educational 
Society, was interviewed, saying that the society's main goal is 
to examine educational issues from an "Islamic perspective that 
believes in God as the Lord, in Islam as our religion, and in 
the Holy Koran as a system and constitution." Proceeding from 
this premise, he added, we are trying to deal with ideas that 
deviate from such an approach. He said that an Islamic school 
should focus on preparing "faithful generations who have a sound 
understanding of Islam and act accordingly." He noted: "What 
makes me suspicious of the general secondary education law is 
that the Education Ministry's philosophy is based on relegating 
the Islamic educational philosophy in favor of an ambiguous 
philosophy aimed at eventually absorbing the Islamic identity 
into the education curricula." He pointed out that the 
Education Ministry's policy to cut down on the number of books 
is not out of concern for the students but is intended as a 
pretext for deleting Islamic history and "everything related to 
values and virtue." He said that the latest judicial verdict in 
favor of the girls of al-Hilmiyah School is an "honorable" stand 
for the Egyptian judiciary and a "slap" to the "enemies of Islam 
and democracy," noting that every girl is free to wear a veil if 
she pleases. He concluded, saying that university students are 
the leaders of tomorrow and that caring for and preparing them 
is "an Islamic, national duty." 
<H5>  Muslim Propriety Stressed </H5>
  Major General Dr. Fawzi Tayil, in an article entitled "The 
Nation's Security," cited Koranic verses and the Prophet's 
sayings that urge men and women to "protect their honor and 
reputation." He noted in detail the proper code of conduct 
among family members, Islamic rules to punish adulterers, the 
need to avoid all suspicious behavior, and the duty of jihad "in 
the cause of God and in defense of religion and to ward off 
sedition." 
<H5>  More Rules for National Dialogue </H5>
  Dr. al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Sattar discussed at length the "bases" 
for a proposed national dialogue in an article entitled "The 
Dialogue's Priorities and Ways of Handling It." He noted that 
on more than one occasion Egypt has defined its overall 
direction and clearly chosen an Islamic approach through several 
"referendums." The "clearest evidence" of that, he said, is the 
victory of the candidates from the Islamic trend in local 
elections. 
  He added that the principles of the national dialogue should 
include work within the context of the "broad Islamic 
legitimacy," which will impart to the dialogue the 
characteristics of a "sound nationalism." He said that the 
dialogue should address political issues such as the assumption 
of power, relations between the ruler and people, parliament; 
and al-Azhar, social issues such women and their role, and the 
roles of mosques and schools, and Egypt's "Arab and Islamic 
affiliation." He concluded, saying that all members of the 
Egyptian nation, regardless of their inclination, and primarily 
the Muslim Brothers, other Islamic organizations, and Orthodox 
and other Christians, should take part in the dialogue. 
<H5>  Students Reject Anti-Islamic Literature </H5>
  The president of the Cairo University Students Union has 
reportedly affirmed that the students denounce the campaign 
against al-Azhar launched by "mercenary writers" because 
al-Azhar played its "legitimate historic Egyptian, Arab, and 
Islamic duty to ward off destructive ideas that harm the 
religious Egyptian people's ethics and faith." The students' 
spokesman repudiated publication in "one of the yellow magazines 
of faith-destroying articles and obscene pictures" on the 
pretext of freedom of expression, which has turned into freedom 
to "attack Islam."

<F P=106> ["The Memory of History" column by Zakariyah Nil: "The Laws </F>
of Boycott: Between Doubt and Certainty"] 
  [Text] The Arab boycott of Israel will remain the only 
issue regarding which no Arab country can take any unilateral 
steps. The companies that deal with Israel or help it in its 
war effort will remain on the boycott file and will make no 
unilateral decision to stop or cancel these dealings. The 
strange thing about this boycott is that the moods felt about it 
fluctuate. Those who used to dismiss the effectiveness of the 
boycott and claim that it had no real influence are now 
wondering about and revising their positions. 
  Why all the fuss about the boycott? 
  Why does the United States always take the initiative and 
ask 
that it be lifted? 
  If this Arab boycott of Israel does not harm Israel's 
economy, why are there so many threats being issued by Zionist 
pressure groups? 
  Those who used to underestimate and belittle the 
effectiveness of the boycott are suddenly waking up and 
monitoring the debate about it in the Arab and American arenas. 
They finally realize there is something to it. As the popular 
saying goes: There is no smoke without fire. The clouds of 
smoke are shielding the boycott. There is a fire--the 
boycott--to which the smoke led. Those who used to dismiss the 
effects of the boycott are now worried and acting to lift it. 
They insist that it be lifted. The conclusion is that the 
truth about the effectiveness of the boycott laws has not 
changed. Otherwise, what is the meaning of this action? 
  First, a group of U.S. congressmen or members of parliament 
have rallied support for a draft project that asks the U.S. 
Administration to stop the contracts of any U.S. arms deals with 
any Arab country that fails to end its boycott of Israel. They 
are trying through every means of pressure to gain the support 
of other congressmen so that a majority will pass the draft 
project. They mean Saudi Arabia first, which has contracts with 
the United States to buy developed planes and missile launching 
pads plus many other things on the list that it needs to develop 
its Armed Forces, especially after the lessons it learned from 
the catastrophic Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and after the bitter 
experience of Desert Storm. 
  The question is: If these people thought the boycott was 
useless, why do they have this aggressive stance on the Arab 
countries, most of which have distinguished relations with the 
United States? 
  Why is Saudi Arabia the primary target of this threat? Is it 
because it encourages a just peace in the region? Or because, 
thanks to it, it has revived the U.S. weapons factories and 
prevented millions of workers and employees from losing their 
jobs so that they do not end up in the cesspits of unemployment 
and homelessness? 
  Second, there is a saying that some U.S. Administration 
officials always repeat but that has become hollow and empty of 
any practical content. This saying is that taking such a step 
encourages Israel to assume positive positions in the course of 
the peace negotiations and to speed up the implementation of 
autonomy for Gaza and Jericho. Undoubtedly, time has proven the 
falsity and treachery behind this logic and that Israeli 
positions regarding the peace process remain governed by 
belligerence. 
  Third, when Israel's friends found the Arabs were reluctant 
to speed up taking such a step before the aggressor forces ended 
their occupation of the Arab territories, they rallied around 
this issue from another angle using the pretext that the boycott 
has started to hamper and paralyze projects to build up the 
autonomy areas. When U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown 
arrived in Cairo as part of his visit to countries in the 
region, he made a point of visiting the Arab League and meeting 
its secretary general, Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al- Majid. This visit 
resulted in the start of a dialogue on ending the boycott. When 
the secretary general affirmed that the decision to boycott 
Israel was an Arab League Council decision, the U.S. commerce 
secretary took Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid's pulse on whether this issue 
could be discussed anew during a coming Arab League Council 
session. 
  The secretary general wondered about the motives behind the 
question. The U.S. secretary replied that there are American 
companies that want to participate in implementing the 
reconstruction projects in the Gaza Strip. But the Arab boycott 
laws prevent them from carrying out this urgent mission--a 
pretext with logic. The response from the secretary general 
was: This issue is always on the Arab League Council's agenda. 
It automatically moves from one council to the other. It is 
listed on the agenda, naturally. 

<H5>    Time bombs and fuses: </H5>
  Indeed, not all of these are the parties involved in the 
game 
of pressure to revoke the boycott laws. There are also the 
parties that hold the threads and play on the nerves of the 
Palestinian team in the talks to implement the self-government 
principles. The Jewish campaigns of pressure on U.S. President 
Clinton and his men are continuing. These pressures have two 
objectives. The first is to tell the world in general and the 
Arabs in particular: The solution for all crises is not in the 
hands of the U.S. Administration; it is in our own hands. The 
second is to hint to the same U.S. Administration that it stop 
making statements it cannot implement. 
  Signs of this are: Following the working meetings between 
Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in the 
Swiss city of Davos, Peres' declaration that progress was made 
in this round of talks, and the U.S. reactions praising Peres 
when he arrived in Washington after the Davos talks, Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin made remarks from which one 
understands that Peres did not have full authority during these 
talks and that concluding them requires several months, not one 
or two weeks. He then summoned the top officials in "the ruling 
military establishment in Tel Aviv," that is, the Israeli army's 
commanders, to solicit their views. He stated: We want first 
to ascertain three issues that require study. These are: 
  The security issues. 
  The border crossing points. 
  The size of Jericho. 
  From this, it appears that Israel has not spent almost three 
months arguing these three points. Clearly, and despite what is 
being said, Rabin stands by his word that he is seeking more 
from the Palestinian self-government principles than he is 
giving. By claiming the need to be assured of "Israel's 
security" guarantees, he wants to turn the border crossing 
points in Gaza and Jericho into outlets for tightening his grip 
on the Palestinians through search posts that enable Israel to 
tighten its police grip. And he wants to expand his presence in 
the self-government areas under the slogan of his right to 
provide all possible security means for the Jewish settlements 
in these areas. Israel thus wants to return to the old policy 
of occupation to make itself the government at the heart of the 
self-government authority. These are the real mines buried in 
the body of the Palestinian agreement. They will be like fuses 
that threaten all the self-government projects and interfere in 
its legitimate sovereignty over its national soil. 
  The nearer the U.S. Administration moves toward taking 
positive steps to boost the negotiations on the peace tracks, 
the more intense the Jewish organizations' pressure on it 
become. Such campaigns have frequently forced the U.S. 
President to retract some of his decisions. Pressure was 
exerted to withdraw his nomination of Admiral Bobby Inman for 
the post of defense secretary on the pretext of his hostility to 
Israel. Nobody knows yet how successful the new campaigns to 
force the U.S. President to abandon his nomination of Strobe 
Talbot as assistant secretary of state on the pretext of his 
hostility to the Jews will be. 
  Maintaining the boycott's rules has become an inevitable 
need 
until the Israeli Government complies with and implements the 
resolutions of international legitimacy, makes the resumption of 
the peace negotiations in Washington on 15 February the starting 
point for a solution to all the points of difference, and agrees 
with a joint timetable for the stages of its withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories. The security guarantees for the 
various countries of the region lie in the implementation of 
Resolution 242, which enjoys the unanimous support of all 
countries, including Israel. Will it do so? I doubt it can join 
the "peace of the brave."

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive Committee </F>
member and head of the Palestinian side at the Refugee 
Subcommittee of the Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Political 
Committee, by Tawfiq al-'Abid; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-'Abid] A few days ago, a 
senior PLO official said the Cairo agreement is not ideal. Do 
you agree with this assessment? 
  [Ghawshah] That is correct. The agreement is not ideal. We 
view what took place in Cairo as an incomplete step. It is not 
a positive start for the resumption of negotiations on various 
issues. We view what happened in Cairo as a new indicator, as 
Rabin has resumed the policy of procrastination, extortion, and 
imposition of the status quo. He went beyond that to ridicule 
the entire [Oslo] agreement. Things got worse when Rabin said 
there are no sacred dates. This is despite the fact that the 
only issue that will not tolerate various interpretations or 
double-dealing is the dates of 13 January and 13 April. 
However, even this clear issue has been considered not sacred 
by Rabin. Therefore, I say that what ttook place in Cairo is a 
possible step. But it is not a step that responds to the 
minimum level of our demands. 
  We see the negotiations as a long and arduous process. There 
will be negotiating battles. Rabin and his generals will try to 
impose their concept of the agreement and to delay the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. 
  [Al-'Abid] Can I understand from what you have said that the 
Palestinian negotiating team was subjected to extortion during 
the Cairo negotiations? Were specific pressures put on the 
delegation? 
  [Ghawshah] We can say the extortions were tremendous. 
However, the Palestinian delegation did not accept all 
extortions. It resisted some of them. If the Palestinian had 
given in to extortions, the matter would not have required 
rounds of negotiations in Oslo, Davos, Versailles, and Cairo. 
  On the contrary, extortions were even greater. Still, we 
have to admit that the Palestinian delegation could not impose 
its concept of the agreement in a manner that meets the minimum 
[Palestinian] demands. 
  [Al-'Abid] Some of those who attacked the Cairo agreement 
said President Yasir 'Arafat is not authorized to sign the 
agreement, and that the PLO Executive Committee has not 
authorized him do so. What is your comment? 
  [Ghawshah] I attended the PLO Executive Committee meeting 
[prior to the Cairo agreement]. Many arguments took place. It 
is known that it was an incomplete PLO Executive Committee 
meeting and that arrangements had been for a liaison committee 
delegation rather that brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] to 
travel to Cairo. It was originally planned that brother 
Abu-'Ammar would travel to the Egyptian capital only to meet 
with President Muhammad Husni Mubarak. However, a host of 
circumstances led to the participation of President 'Arafat, 
including the Israeli insistence not to participate unless 
brother Abu-'Ammar attended in person. Eventually, this issue 
was discussed during a meeting of PLO Executive Committee 
members who agreed to attend. A last-minute decision was taken 
concerning brother Abu-'Ammar's travel. Still, it should be 
noted that the PLO Executive Committee should be briefed on any 
steps during its subsequent meetings. Its members have the right 
to express their views. This actually took place during a 
subsequent meeting on the nature of the Cairo agreement. Various 
views were expressed. We should not forget that there are 
various views. We express our views in a democratic way. What I 
have said has been officially announced in a Palestinian Popular 
Struggle Front's statement in which we discussed the meeting. I 
believe that any faction is entitled to debate issues and 
express their views within the framework of the Palestinian 
institutions. 
  [Al-'Abid] What were the most prominent developments that 
took place a short time before President 'Arafat decided to 
participate in the Cairo negotiations? 
  [Ghawshah] Intensive international and Arab contacts were 
held with President 'Arafat to remove the obstacles. The United 
States was the most active country in this respect. The strange 
thing is that the United States exercises its role only when 
there is a need to bring pressure to bear on us, and not as an 
honest and faithful mediator and sponsor. What was achieved in 
Cairo could have been better had the sponsors of the conference, 
specifically the United States, assumed the role of an honest 
partner and mediator. 
  As yet, the U.S. Administration has not adopted a balanced 
or 
equitable stand. It tilts toward the Israeli concept and 
viewpoint, irrespective of the justifications and the preambles. 
We can say that up to this moment, the United States has not 
adopted a balanced stand, and has not exercised the required 
role. On the contrary, the role that is being exercised is to 
bring pressure to bear on the Palestinian side and not the 
Israeli side. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-'Abid] Many believe Israel will not abide by the 13 
April 
deadline and that it will put forth excuses. What can the 
Palestinian side do to force Israel to respect timetables? 
  [Ghawshah] Those who believe that all barriers and obstacles 
between us and Israel have been removed will reap disappointment 
and failure. Israel is still an enemy which carries out a 
policy of land confiscation, repression, and extermination. It 
is only natural that it tries to maneuver and procrastinate to 
empty the agreement of substance. From this premise, we are not 
surprised by any Israeli stand. We expect the worst. However, 
this does not mean that we keep silent. We should confront it. 
But this depends on the balance of powers from which the Arabs 
and the Palestinians are suffering. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-'Abid] There is a weapons-acquiring wave in the West 
Bank 
and the Gaza Strip. Most of it is not for militant purposes. 
This heralds internecine fighting in the future. What do you 
have to say about this? 
  [Ghawshah] The question of weapons-acquiring in the occupied 
homeland is eye-catching. What is taking place is an increase 
in the activities of weapons smugglers. This has taken place 
recently. It seems that the Israeli security bodies facilitate 
the possession of weapons so that the Palestinian people may 
kill one another. 
  However, we say that the Palestinian people are so mature 
and 
have learned from past experience and will not fall victim to 
the enemy's schemes. We are studying measures and arrangements 
to prevent the shedding of any Palestinian blood by Palestinian 
hands. 
  [Al-'Abid] What about the meeting of the committee on the 
refugees and the displaced which met yesterday, and what about 
the agenda of the negotiations with the Jordanian side? 
  [Ghawshah] We agreed on a draft agenda. We discussed at 
length the issue of refugees, which we reviewed in all its 
aspects, particularly from its strategic aspect based on the 
fact that a just solution consists of their repatriation and not 
their compensation, and forcing Israel to implement 
international legitimacy resolution No. 194. We also discussed 
various other issues, particularly the role of the United 
Nations Relief and Works Agency. 
  We emphasized the need to effectively carry out coordination 
and cooperation and reject the principle of resettlement. 
  Wuth respect to the displaced, there is UN Security Council 
Resolution 237 which calls for their repatriation, and special 
clause 13 in the DOP on the modalities of their return. This 
will be studied through a four-way 
Jordanian-Palestinian-Egyptian-Israeli committee. 
  There was also a Jordanian and Palestinian understanding on 
the various issues slated on the agenda.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 16, (IRNA) -- Secretary General of the 
Lebanese Hizbollah Seyyed Hassan Nasrollah said that the last 
year operations of the Islamic Jihad against the Zionist regime 
has forced Tel Aviv to admit that 1993 was one of the toughest 
years for its military forces. 
  Nasrollah made the remark in an exclusive interview 
published 
in Wednesday issue of the English daily `TEHRAN TIMES'. 
  Turning to political activities of Hizbollah, he said the 
Islamic movement in Lebanon has been fully active in the 
political scene for the past year and had sent 12 deputies to 
the parliament. 
  "The importance of this approach is that it shows 
Hizbollah's 
popularity and proves that Western and regional propaganda 
against us are totally baseless." 
  He described Hizbollah's social and cultural activities over 
this period as spectacular but voiced its opposition with the 
so-called peace process from the very beginning. 
  "We have particularly rejected Lebanon's entry into these 
treacherous talks, because they are against our country's 
political and national interests and we feel it is illogical for 
Lebanon to participate in them." 
  Asked about Hizbollah's reaction in case Lebanon joins the 
peace process and signs a peace treaty, Nasrollah said that such 
a peace may create obgligatinos for governments but not for 
people. 
  Stressing that people were after a real peace and not the 
one 
on the process, he said "when a peace treaty is finalized we 
will then announce our stand according to the realities of the 
time." 
  On the possibility of Hizbollah laying down its weapons, he 
declined to give any comments in this connection or the 
consequences of regional changes resulting from the peace 
accord. However, he said, "we will address both issues when 
positive changes occure in the area." 
  He called the existing relations between Hizbollah and the 
Lebanese Government "severely tense, negative and confused". 
  Nasrollah described the present policies of Lebanon as 
dangerous for the Lebanese people and for the future of the 
country. 
  Referring to Hizbollah's relations with the Lebanese 
Government as very disappointing, he said that not only the 
government of Rafiq Harari was not able to solve the existing 
problems but it created new difficulties. 
  "What deteriorated our relations with Rafiq Harari's 
administration was the army's attack on our peaceful September 
13 demonstration protesting the Gaza-Jericho partial authonomy 
treaty," he said and called for Harari's resignation. 
  "Generally speaking, establishment of an Islamic government 
seems to be ideally suited for all Islamic countries, yet, we 
are against forced solutions." 
  Turning to the recent Geneva meeting of the Syrian and U.S. 
presidents, he said that according to the media they disagreed 
on the issues related to Hizbollah. Reportedly, U.S. President 
Bill Clinton considered all liberation movements as terrorists 
while syria regarded them, specially those in Lebanon and 
Palestine, as legal and natural. 
  "People whose lands are occupied by foreigners have the 
right 
to fight for the return of their territorial sovereignty and no 
one can deprive them of this right," he stressed.

  [Text] Informed political sources have said Kuwait is most 
likely the Arab capital to which his majesty the king referred 
in his speech to the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  The sources base this conclusion on information which said 
that the killers of late Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah belong to Fatah-the 
Revolutionary Council organization, led by Abu-Nidal [Sabri 
al-Banna]. Abu-Nidal left Libya after the Gulf war and decided 
to settle in Kuwait after he established new links with the Gulf 
states. 
  Libya officially rejected suggestions that it is responsible 
for the assassination. A statement reminded that relations 
between Amman and Tripoli are good and untarnished. 
Additionally, the statement adds, Libya is interested these 
days in strengthening its relations with all Arab states in view 
of the conspiracies hatched against it and the blockade which 
the United States and some European countries imposed through 
the United Nations under the pretext of the Lockerbie plane 
incident. 
  Information published on the assassination of late 
al-Ma'ayitah is still ambiguous and led to conclusions that 
perplexed the Jordanian citizen. 
  Following the statement issued by the Lebanese security 
authorities on the arrest of four Palestinians, who, according 
to the statement, belong to a Palestinian organization, the 
official Jordanian media, as well as the "undeclared official 
media" began to emphasize the fact that the killers are 
Palestinians. The average Jordanian citizen was dismayed by the 
language, which, in the end, does not serve the national unity 
between the two peoples. A former House of Representative 
member said that certain parties are fuelling regionalism in 
this country, especially after certain analyses and conclusions 
made in certain political salons went as far as saying there is 
a Palestinian interest in al-Ma'ayitah's assassination. [three 
blank lines follow] 
  Fatah-the Revolutionary Council issued an official statement 
in which it said it is not responsible for the attack. The 
statement said the arrest of a group of the organization's 
members in Lebanon falls within the framework of the unending 
campaign against it.

<F P=106> [Report by Ashraf al-Faqiyy: "Fahimah al-Miqrahi Tells </F>
AL-HAYAH: Lockerbie Is a Settling of Scores"] 
  [Text] Tripoli -- Al-Amin Khalifah Fahimah and 
'Abd-al-Basit al-Miqrahi, the two Libyans suspected of 
involvement in blowing up the PanAm plane over Scotland five 
years ago, have said that they are tired of waiting to stand 
trial for a "crime we did not commit and knew nothing about" 
until after they were accused of it. 
  In an interview in Tripoli, Fahimah and al-Miqrahi told 
AL-HAYAH that they are tired of the restrictions imposed on 
their movement. They stressed their wish to live a normal life, 
"instead of being stared at wherever we go and instead of our 
news dominating all world news bulletins." 
  Al-Miqrahi said: "Our only crime is that we hold Libyan 
nationality.... We are victims of the West's desire to 
politicize the case and try Libya for a crime it did not commit 
in the context of settling scores in other issues." 
  It appeared from the interview that al-Amin Fahimah and 
al-Miqrahi were in a bad mental state, but they tried to look 
composed. Al-Miqrahi pointed out that he was not in Malta 
during the period in which the accusation was leveled at Libya, 
and that he never met the owner of the timing device (timer) 
factory. 
  Al-Miqrahi added that he and al-Amin Fahimah placed their 
full confidence in lawyer Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl the moment he was 
assigned to defend them, and that they support any decision he 
takes. He pointed out that they were not subjected to any 
pressures to hand themselves over, that the decision is theirs, 
and that they are willing to appear before "any court that 
enjoys the elements of fairness, not one that convicts people 
before the trial begins." 
  He said that "the accusations have affected all my 
relatives, 
especially my children, who used to convey to me questions from 
their colleagues about this incident. I had to move them to 
another school...and change their family name to their mother's 
in order to alleviate their suffering." 
  Having stressed that he does not fear for himself, he said 
that he now wants "the days to pass quickly so that I can get 
the innocent verdict." He stressed that "I will never sell 
myself to any quarter in the world, whatever the reward." And 
"I have never been an officer in the Libyan intelligence 
service." 
  He added that "I am willing to hand myself over if the case 
is going to end at that point and if the sanctions imposed on 
Libya are going to be lifted." He added: "However, from my 
protracted discussions with the lawyer, they (the Western 
states) do not want to bring an end to this case, because its 
continuation is likely to lead to the continuation of the 
sanctions imposed on Libya." 
  He said that the Libyan testifying against them, namely 
'Abd-al-Hamid Ja'akah, "maybe acted under pressure or for other 
unavoidable motives." He stressed that "the statements 
attributed to Ja'akah are absolutely baseless and completely 
fabricated." He declined to talk about Ja'akah's mental state 
or go into the details of his personal life. 
  As for al-Amin Fahimah, he expressed his belief that 
'Abd-al-Hamid Ja'akah "will withdraw his lies the moment he sees 
me..., because I helped him a lot in several issues. And I 
believe that the case will end the moment Ja'akah admits the 
truth." 
  The two suspects' lawyer, Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, who attended 
the interview, believes that "the great suffering" al-Amin 
Khalifah and al-Miqrahi are experiencing is capable of "driving 
those afflicted by it toward madness or introversion."

  [Text] Today is the fifth anniversary of the declaration of 
the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] between the Great Jamahiriyah, 
Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania. On this day five 
years ago the treaty creating the AMU was signed at the 
Marrakesh summit in fraternal Morocco as a step on the road to 
achieving the all-embracing Arab unity. 
  The brother leader of the revolution emphasized at the final 
session of the Marrakesh summit the need to set up the AMU for 
the benefit of the toilers, the poor and the deprived who have 
suffered decades of oppression and colonialism, and to let the 
overwhelming majority [of the peoples of the Maghreb] have their 
share in the new unified Arab Maghreb. He also stressed that 
this Union should be a support for the struggle of the Arab 
Palestinian people for the liberation of Palestine from the 
river to the sea. 
  However, five years after its creation the treaty of this 
Union has remained mere ink on paper and its march has not 
achieved more than zero because it did not render any service to 
the Arab people in this region. Suffice to note that this union 
was incapable of holding a summit meeting and was unable to lift 
an unfair embargo imposed on a member state.

  [Text] Cairo, 18 Feb (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM asserts 
that the security forces' recent preemptive strikes against the 
terrorist groups are an indication of a new, successful security 
policy that aims to keep the initiative in the hands of the 
police and deny the terrorists the chance of lying low until it 
is time to perpetrate a new crime. 
  In its editorial today, the paper says that the new security 
policy is based on the availability of accurate and specific 
data about the terrorist organizations, their operational 
methods, hideouts, and modes of communication with each other in 
Egypt and with their financiers and instigators abroad. 
  The paper adds: The facts prove beyond a shadow of doubt 
that these unbalanced young men, devoid of any true religious 
faith, have consciously or unconsciously become agents of 
foreign anti-Egypt schemes to undermine the country's successful 
economic reform program. 
  The paper concludes: Now that the picture is perfectly clear 
and the identities of the murderers known, there is no 
alternative to an all-out confrontation using the law's sharp 
scalpel to excise this malignant tumor from the homeland's body.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 18 (AFP)--Three soldiers linked to 
Islamic militants have been condemned to death and three others 
jailed for 10 years for plotting to assassinate Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak, court sources disclosed Friday. 
  The military court of Sidi Barrani, near the Libyan border, 
passed the death sentence against a second lieutenant in the 
reserves, Midhat Tahawi, and two conscripts, Hamadah Muhammad 
Lutfi and Muhammad Ahmad Sa'id Salih, on Wednesday. 
  One of the conscripts was among the seven Islamic militants 
killed in a police raid on the Cairo district of al-Zawiyah al- 
Hamra' in early February, according to an informed source. The 
other two appeared in court. 
  Another second lieutenant, Fathi Mahmud Khattab, and two 
more 
conscripts were each sentenced to 10 years of hard labour. 
  The court said the six soldiers had planted explosives at 
Sidi Barrani airport and planned to detonate the bomb during a 
visit by Mubarak, who often meets his Libyan counterpart 
Mu'ammar al- Qadhdhafi in the border town. 
  The trial opened on January 30 behind closed doors. 
  The latest verdicts raised to 43 the number of Islamic 
militants sent to death row since October 1992. Twenty-nine 
people have been executed over the last nine months.

  [Text] Taba, 17 Feb (MENA)--Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators resumed their meetings in Taba this morning. Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to President Yasir 'Arafat, and 
General Amnon Shahaq, Israel's deputy chief of staff, led the 
talks that are trying to find a formula for the implementation 
of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  MENA learned that the Security Committee was divided into 
two 
subcommittees. The first subcommittee is examining some details 
on the size of the Palestinian police force, the number of 
vehicles it will be using, and the nature of its tasks in Gaza 
and Jericho. 
  The other subcommittee is discussing the issue of 
Palestinian 
detainees in Israeli jails. Muhammad Dahlan, Palestinian 
security official in Gaza, and David Agmon, deputy security 
chief of the West Bank, head this subcommittee. 
  Dr. Sha'th last night met a delegation of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] operating in Israel and the 
occupied territories and reviewed with them a list of the 
Palestinian detainees. 
  An ICRC official said that he handed Dr. Sha'th a list of 
the 
Palestinian detainees and discussed with him humanitarian issues 
concerning the detainees. The official declined to divulge the 
number of Palestinian detainees. 
  Meanwhile, the Civilian Affairs Committee met for one hour 
today to continue discussing issues pertaining to electricity, 
historical sites, civil registration, and other unresolved 
issues. 
  Lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi said after the meeting that the 
committee reviewed what has already been agreed upon, namely the 
transfer of the electricity authority, civil registration, 
postal services, and public works to the Palestinians. He 
explained that issuing a postage stamp for local and 
international use will be left for the two leaderships in Tunis 
and Jerusalem to agree on. 
  Al-Tarifi added that progress has been made and the talks 
were conducted in a very positive atmosphere. He said 
communications, land registry, water resources, and historical 
sites will be discussed at the next round of talks, for which 
preparations were made during today's meeting. 
  The Security Committee is expected to end its meeting this 
afternoon. It will reconvene in Taba next Monday.

  [Excerpts] Taba, 17 Feb (MENA)-- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of 
the Palestinian delegation to the Taba self-rule negotiations, 
stated that the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators have reached 
a joint draft agreement on the Palestinian police force. 
  Speaking to reporters today, Sha'th remarked that certain 
points pertaining to the number of this force were not 
discussed, but were referred to the Palestinian and Israeli 
leadership to adopt a decision on them. 
  Sha'th described the talks as generally positive, adding 
that 
considerable progress has been made. We hoped we could reach a 
protocol on security issues and another on the transfer of 
authority, he said, adding that this will probably be achieved 
during the next round of talks next week. 
  Dr. Sha'th pointed out that the Civilian Affairs Committee 
had to conclude its work early today when chief Israeli delegate 
Gadi Zohar had to return to Israel, where he has some 
engagements. He affirmed, however, that the committee will 
finish its work next week. 
  He added that the Security Committee today discussed 
security 
arrangements in Gaza and Jericho, as well as on the roads; the 
settlements; and the joint patrols within the context of the 
Cairo agreement. He hoped all these matters will be settled in 
the next round. 
  Sha'th noted that the subcommittee in charge of the 
Palestinian detainees is continuing its work under the 
cochairmanship of Muhammad Dahlan and General David Agmon to 
draw up a timetable for the release of Palestinians being held 
in Israeli jails. [passage omitted] 
  MENA has learned that the Palestinian and Israeli sides 
agreed today to hold the next round of negotiations in Cairo, 
contrary to an earlier announcement that the talks would be held 
in Taba.

<F P=106> [Report from Taba by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Security Committee's talks will resume in 
Cairo on Monday [21 February]. The Taba negotiations have 
adjourned for the week, and Israeli delegation sources described 
the progress achieved this week as tremendous. We used to argue 
for a month and a half over one clause, and yet we concluded 
five clauses within the last three days, one of the delegates 
told us. Major General Amnon Shahaq recapped the discussions: 
  [Begin Shahaq recording] We have concluded the agreement 
segment dealing with security coordination and cooperation. We 
have reviewed every aspect of the police issue, and later we 
will discuss several aspects of its size. We have started 
discussing security arrangements in Gaza and Jericho. The 
Civilian Affairs Committee has also concluded a series of 
issues, and it will pursue some of the issues next week. [end 
recording] 
  Shahaq and Sha'th have started discussing the format of the 
comprehensive arrangement. Unfinished issues include two 
substantive matters: the Palestinian council and the 
self-administration's jurisdiction. The Civilian Affairs 
Committee still has five points to conclude before the civilian 
chapter of the Taba negotiations can be closed. [passage 
omitted] 
  Members of the Israeli delegation said the talks were swift 
and favorable this week, although they were unprepared to commit 
themselves to a timetable. Gen. Shahaq said: 
  [Begin Shahaq recording] We aim for an agreement covering 
every issue, giving us guarantees. I hope it will happen 
quickly. We all want it to happen as soon as possible, but I 
would not....[pauses] If two more weeks are required, then we 
will take two more weeks. If a month is needed, we will take a 
month. And if we find we can finish it in less than two weeks, 
we will all be glad. [end recording]

  [Text] Taba, 17 Feb (MENA)--Security Committee member Hasan 
'Asfur has stated that the Palestinian and Israeli sides to the 
Taba talks have postponed particular differences that continue 
to obstruct a security protocol. He expressed his hope of 
reaching a security protocol before 'Id al-Fitr to offer good 
news to the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied 
territories. In a statement after the Palestinian-Israeli 
Security Committee, he said that issues relating to the side 
roads in the Gaza Strip were discussed. The two sides also 
discussed operating joint patrols in the security belt of the 
settlements and on roads in the Gaza Strip. They agreed to call 
these patrols "Help Patrols" [Dawriyat Najdah]. 
  'Asfur said: We have also reached an agreement on defining 
the security belt of the settlements and the security belt in 
the Palestinian areas in accordance with the Cairo agreement. 
He noted that particular points will be discussed next week. 
Regarding security in Jericho, he said this issue has not been 
broached. He stressed that this round was generally positive, 
noting that understanding was reached on numerous issues. He 
said the negotiations are proceeding positively. The 
Palestinian delegation has left Taba for Cairo, where the 
Security Committee is scheduled to meet for the next round. 
  Head of the Israeli delegation Amnon Shahaq said at the end 
of this round of talks that the negotiations proceeded 
positively, noting that this progress does not mean there are no 
problems. He pointed out that we have completed discussion of 
the part relating to security cooperation and coordination. He 
said the two sides have not yet settled the size of the 
Palestinian police force. He noted that both sides discussed 
security arrangements in Gaza and Jericho and the issue of 
Palestinian detainees but refused to give details. Shahaq said 
the Civilian Affairs Committee settled many issues relating to 
the transfer of power and will discuss the remaining issues next 
week. 
  The issues of antiquities, water, and city planning have 
been 
adjourned until next week along with the issue of 
communications, notably the Palestinian radio and television, 
which will be discussed at the next round. 
  Shahaq stressed that the next round of talks will be held in 
Cairo and the round after that in Taba, noting that it is 
difficult to say when these rounds will end. He noted that 
substantial issues on which no agreement has been reached are 
still under discussion. He said these issues relate to the 
authorities and powers of the two sides. He voiced his hope 
that an agreement will be reached to implement Palestinian 
self-rule.

  [Text] Two days of economic discussions between 
delegations from Israel, Jordan, and the United States ended 
last night in Washington. Our Washington correspondent Arye 
Golan has learned that the Jordanians are not prepared to engage 
in joint projects with Israel before progress is made in the 
negotiations between Israel and Syria and the outstanding 
problems between Israel and Jordan are solved. These problems 
are: the Palestinian refugees, use of the water sources, and 
areas in the 'Arava that Jordan claims to own. Our 
correspondent reports that Israeli and Jordanian experts 
discussed ways to prevent drug trafficking between the two 
countries. 
  In addition, another week of peace talks between Israeli 
representatives and delegations from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and 
the Palestinians ended in Washington. Deputy Foreign Minister 
Yosi Beilin said the talks between Israel and Jordan were the 
most successful. 
  On the Palestinian track, Major General Dani Rothschild and 
Sa'ib 'Urayqat began discussing the modalities of the elections 
to the autonomy council. They were joined by Ehud Shilat, the 
Interior Ministry's national supervisor of elections.

  [Text] New York, Feb 17, (SPA) -- The Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia has demanded that the international community must 
undertake all necessary measures authorized by the charter of 
the U.N. for implementation of the Security Council resolutions, 
overed by Chapter Seventh, permitting use of power to force the 
intrasigent Serbian side in compliance to the rules of the 
international legality. 
  Addressing a session held by the Security Council on Tuesday 
on the Bosnian situation, Ambassador Jaafar al-Leqani, the Saudi 
permanent representative to the United Nation, stated that the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had taken an steadfast stand since the 
start of the crisis to support the people and government of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and expressed full support for the 
resolutions and recommendations made by the London conference, 
the United Nations and Geneva talks on the matter. 
  He called on for implementation of the resolution adopted by 
the Security Council on protection of safe havens in the Bosnian 
lands and to boost the Bosnian Government's capabilities of 
self-defense. 
  " The Saudi position has been emanated from a strong 
commitment and absolute adherence to the attitudes of the 
international legality and the international laws and norms." he 
said. 
  He called on the Security Council to undertake all possible 
means to implement more than fifty resolution it made on the 
Bosnian crisis and said any efforts for a peaceful settlement 
should take into consideration equal and fair bases because such 
settlement would be useless if the Serbs were allowed to go 
ahead with their vicious aggression and genocidal war against 
the Moslems of the region. 
  Ambassador Al-Leqani expressed hope that the international 
community would take a serious and rational step towards the 
just and legitimate demands of the Republic of Bosnian 
Government and make sure that the republic would not subject 
again to any aggressive of genocidal policies, give the Islamic 
republic a sea outlet and enable her of practicing the 
legitimate right of self- defense. 
  Ambassador Al-Leqani denounced the genocidal war being waged 
by the Serbs and their allies against the Moslem population of 
Bosni-Herzegovina that led to a tremendous and tragic loss of 
lives and displacement of thousands. 
  He cited with resentment the recent bombardment of a 
marketplace in Sarajevo that killed more than 60 people and the 
recent Serbian attacks on many of the safe havens declared by 
the United Nations. 
  He said the untold and nefarious acts of the Serbs are 
constituting a great insult for the world's conscience. 
  Leqani recalled the Saudi warning that any failure in 
dealing 
with the Bosnian crisis on bases of the new international order 
would no doublt endanger the very existance and credibility of 
that order.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of 
the General People's Congress, has addressed a message to the 
expanded mass gathering of the Aden Governorate, which opened 
its activities yesterday evening. 
  The following is the text of the message: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  The brother chairman and members of the expanded people's 
gathering of the Aden Governorate. 
  It is my pleasure to extend to you and all the sons of the 
valiant Aden Governorate my best wishes and congratulations on 
the blessed month of Ramadan during which your gathering is 
convening. 
  No doubt, your gathering is a positive step and bodes well 
for carrying the accord document -- once it is finally signed in 
a few days, God willing -- to a new stage. The most important 
features of this stage is that it ensures sound development, 
progress, peace, and unity for unified Yemen. 
  You are meeting in valiant Aden, which occupies a special 
place in the heart of every Yemeni, since this city witnessed 
the greatest positions and noblest sacrifices for the triumph of 
the 26 September and 14 October Yemeni revolutions against 
invaders. 
  In Yemen's contemporary history, this city has been a bright 
center and a source of radical historical changes, most 
important of which is raising the flag of unity to flutter high 
in its skies. Also, Aden witnessed the signing of a historic 
unionist agreement on 30 November 1989. This valiant city, 
which occupies a special place in the heart of every Yemeni, has 
remained a city for honorable unionists of the Yemeni homeland, 
which is proceeding today toward great changes. These changes 
will achieve for our people more progress, stability, and peace, 
God willing, under the banner of the young Yemeni Republic and 
under the umbrella of the blessed unity, which rid our people of 
fragmentation, disunity, and backwardness, toward a new world of 
progress and development. This could never have happened 
without unity. 
  While blessing your assembly and blessing all positive steps 
and national efforts, we tell you that we are very eager to 
embody and put into action the accord document, which is a 
practical way out of the political crisis. This document also 
expresses national consensus. We hope that this document will 
end all the misunderstandings and disputes that have harmed the 
interests of the people and the homeland and hampered 
development efforts in the homeland. 
  We are confident that your assembly's decisions and 
recommendations will further enhance the building of unity and 
the homeland's march. These will be added to what your brothers 
in the rest of the governorates have contributed. Your 
decisions and recommendations will also emphasize adherence to 
our national principles, foremost are unity and democracy, and 
eagerness to safeguard higher national interests. 
  We are also fully confident that the masses of the valiant 
Aden Governorate best reflect the city's history and role, as 
well as its great national stands in national struggle against 
hostile and imperialist forces until victory was achieved. Aden 
became brighter after the proclamation of the state of unity on 
22 May 1990. It was a glorious day that dispelled the darkness 
of fragmentation in the life of our people, ended for good 
decades of domination and persecution, and ushered in a new era 
in the life of Yemen based on justice, freedom, and respect for 
human rights. 
  Our people have suffered a great deal as a result of the 
crisis and its negative effects, manifested in price hikes, a 
drop in the value of the national currency, obstructing work at 
government departments, administrative chaos, and other 
phenomena. All these phenomena got worse because of the 
escalation of the political crisis. As we are about to 
implement the accord document, we hope that all these 
regrettable phenomena will end. Our patient people have endured 
all the negative effects of these phenomena for the sake of 
unity and democracy. 
  Despite all the misunderstandings and irregularities that 
accompanied the regrettable crisis, our people, in all their 
factions and forces, will maintain their cohesion, strength, and 
ability to face challenges. Our people will also look with hope 
and optimism toward ending this accidental crisis and will not 
be influenced by malicious propaganda that tries to take 
advantage of this crisis to undermine our national principles, 
fragment our national unity, and cause bloody conflict, 
dissension, and catastrophes in Yemen whose scope is only known 
to God. 
  However, the people's vigilance and awareness of the 
objectives of Yemen's enemies has denied the enemies any chance 
to achieve these objectives. Also, the awareness and vigilance 
of the Armed Forces and security agencies -- and this national 
institution's awareness of the scope and dangers of being 
carried away by the enemies' schemes -- has thwarted all 
conspiracies and emphasized that the army of September and 
October is the army of Yemeni unity and is for all the people. 
This army cannot but share the same views and options of the 
the people, away from all influences, and defend the homeland, 
its sovereignty, unity, and democracy. 
  Concluding, I greet you again and wish your assembly success 
along the path of defending unity and democracy. 
  Peace be upon you. 
  Also, a message from brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice 
chairman 
of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP], was read. 
  To begin, the message conveyed the YSP Political Bureau's 
wishes for the success of this important gathering. It stated 
that the YSP remains true to the position it chose for itself in 
the course of the struggle of the Yemeni people for their 
freedom and comprehensive social progress. 
  The message stressed that the YSP, which has contributed, 
along with all national forces, toward drafting the accord 
document, will be faithful to the implementation of this 
document. 
  The gathering opened its activities yesterday evening with 
several speeches and poems. Brother Fadl 'Ali 'Abdallah, head 
of the preparatory committee of the Aden gathering, made a 
speech in which he welcomed the attendees. He noted the 
importance of holding such a gathering in Aden, which saw the 
birth of the accord document. The Yemeni masses think of this 
document as a solution that embodies a comprehensive national 
program. 
  Other speeches were made on behalf of other mass gatherings 
in the governorates of Ibb, Hadramaut, and Shabwah, expressing 
hope for their success. Leaders for the gathering's committees 
were elected and a plan of action was read, reviewing the 
situation of the homeland. The plan was discussed by the 
attendees.

  [Text] The General Committee of the General People's 
Congress [GPC] has issued the following statement: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Think 
not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they 
live, finding their sustenance from their Lord. [Koranic verse] 
  The General Committee of the GPC announces the death of 
brother 'Abd-al-Hamid Ahmad Mahmud al-Sarfi and Mahdi Muhammad 
Subayh, members of the GPC and two of its leading cadres in the 
Bani-al-Harith District, (?Sa'dah) Governorate. The two were 
killed in a criminal assassination attempt carried out by a 
professional group belonging to one of the political 
organizations that adopt violence as a means to deal with those 
who differ with them. The incident took place the day before 
yesterday. 
  We in the GPC denounce and condemn this incident and all 
acts 
of terrorism and ask the security agencies to promptly arrest 
the killers, put them on trial, and give them a just punishment. 
The security agencies should also uncover the motives of those 
behind the plot. 
  We also take this opportunity to reassert to our people our 
absolute faith and full commitment to national principles and 
state that we will be the first to champion those principles, 
for which the two martyred died. 
  The GPC urges all its members, supporters, and sons of the 
great Yemeni people to be vigilant and foil any feverish 
attempts that seek to undermine Yemeni national gains and the 
achievements of the Yemeni people. 
  We share with the GPC branch in the Bani-al-Harith and its 
supporters, members, the families of the martyrs, and the sons 
of the Bani-al-Harith, the sorrow of this loss. We also beseech 
God to have mercy on the two and place them in paradise, along 
with martyrs and righteous people, and to grant their families 
patience and solace. To God we are and unto Him we shall 
return. May the eyes of the cowardly remain sleepless. 
  Issued by the General Committee of the GPC on 17 February 
1994. 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. To the 
righteous soul will be said: O thou soul: In complete rest and 
satisfaction, come back thou to thy Lord, well pleased thyself 
and well-pleasing unto Him. Enter thou, then, among My 
devotees. Ye, enter thou My heaven. [Koranic verse]

Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah told our news desk: 
  [Begin Basindwah recording] It was only natural that we 
decide on Amman, the capital of brotherly Jordan, to be the 
venue for signing the accord document, in view of the key role 
played by Jordanian officials, above all His Majesty King 
Husayn, in the reconciliation effort. If the signing is not to 
take place on Yemeni territory, then Amman is the right choice. 
We hope that when the signing takes place on 10 Ramadan [20 
February] in Amman, it will mark the beginning of the end of the 
crisis that--had it not been for God's providence--would have 
pushed Yemen over the brink of disaster. I hope Amman's 
spiritual atmosphere in this favored month will rub off on the 
signing ceremonies. I am confident that his majesty's wisdom 
will go a long way toward a Yemeni reunion and the closing of 
ranks so we can pursue our constructive drive on the road to 
unity and democracy and a glorious and immortal Yemen will 
emerge, and, God willing, our country will be a source of 
strength and support for all its Arab brethren. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Hamud Munsir: "Legal Affairs Minister Karman </F>
Urges That All Yemeni Officials Stand Trial"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa -- Yemeni Legal Affairs Minister 
'Abd-al-Salam Khalid Karman has criticized all Yemeni officials, 
saying "they are all subject to punishment by law and should 
all, including Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar (speaker of the House 
of Representatives and leader of the Yemeni Reform Grouping), 
stand trial. Because they all failed to refer to the law. If 
they did, the situation in the country would not have reached 
its present state." 
  This came in an exclusive statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by 
the Yemeni minister, in a discussion of the legal and 
constitutional dimensions of Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas' decision to appoint Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad -- one of 
former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad's men, former Abyan 
governor, and an uncooperative member of the General People's 
Congress [GPC] General Committee (Political Bureau) -- as 
governor of Abyan again, and the Presidential Council's decision 
revoking al-'Attas' decision a few hours later. He described 
the two decisions as "bombs and rockets" in a battle whose two 
parties are about to meet in Amman to sign the Pledge and Accord 
Document. 
  Karman stressed that "Yemen is not governed by the law, but 
by political quarrels." [passage omitted] 
  He added: "They insulted the decisions and laws, and hence 
themselves. Because they -- the authorities -- are responsible 
for the decisions and for implementing the laws. And neither 
history nor the people will have mercy on them." He urged GPC 
and Socialist Party leaders to "have mercy on the Yemeni people 
and refer to the law." He accused all those who signed the 
Pledge and Accord Document of "violating legitimacy and 
forgetting the signal of the parliamentary elections held on 27 
April, which resulted in the formation of the present House of 
Representatives and hence the ruling coalition."

Saddam's Son-in-Law After Surgery in Amman"] 
  [Excerpt] Paris, London, AL-HAYAH -- Staff Lieutenant 
General Husayn Kamil Hasan, the Iraqi president's adviser, left 
Amman yesterday after undergoing brain surgery for the removal 
of a brain tumor. It has been rumored that he was moved to 
Paris for further treatment. The French Foreign Ministry 
refused to confirm the report but did not deny it. 
  A medical source in the Jordanian capital has confirmed that 
Husayn Kamil Hasan, Saddam's son-in-law, did leave the hospital 
after the "delicate" operation. He added that the tumor was not 
cancerous. It should be noted that Saddam's son-in-low is the 
head of the Iraqi Military Industrialization Authority. 
  A French Foreign Ministry source said that he could not 
confirm or deny that the Iraqi president's adviser was moved to 
Paris. 
  Sources of the Unified Iraqi National Congress have told 
AL-HAYAH that Husayn Kamil was moved to Paris in the company of 
a Jordanian doctor and that the operation to take a brain cell 
biopsy lasted eight hours, after which Saddam's son-in-law was 
kept in an intensive care unit and then at dawn on Tuesday was 
moved to "an unknown location" before he was taken to Paris 
yesterday. 
  The sources concluded that the operation revealed the 
seriousness of Husayn Kamil's case, necessitating his transfer 
to France. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Travel from Cairo to Baghdad has stopped completely 
in the past few weeks due to deteriorating economic conditions, 
escalating violence, and the harassment of Egyptian nationals in 
Iraq by the ruling dictator's authorities. 
  The head of the regime's interests section in Cairo has 
admitted that the regime has stopped granting entry visas to 
Egyptians because of the lack of job opportunities and the 
deteriorating economic conditions in Iraq. 
  In another development, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry has 
instructed its mission in Baghdad to prepare an urgent report on 
the number of Egyptians being held prisoner in Iraq. A 
spokesman for the ministry has said that the number of Egyptian 
prisoners is not less than 500, sentenced to serve between two 
years and life imprisonment at hard labor.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] In a letter from Clinton to the American Congress, 
the waffler contended that Iraq has yet to do what it is 
required to do in the area of the destruction of weapons of mass 
destruction. He demanded that Iraq accede to a long-term 
monitoring and inspection program before the sanctions are 
lifted. Taking into account the fact the 30-state aggression on 
Iraq had set out to achieve the objective of keeping Iraq from 
developing an arms industry so that the Zionists maintain their 
edge, we are bound to conclude that the attacks on Iraq were 
stage managed in order to attack Iraq's force and prevent it 
from posing any threat to Zionism. 
  That was the true motive behind the aggression on Iraq. 
However, the war the United States launched on Iraq and the 
subsequent sanctions and inspection have failed to advance the 
goal Washington had in mind. The waffler Clinton's statements 
may then be explained as follows: 
  No nation on earth will voluntarily surrender its power and 
weapons that it is supposed to use as a deterrent against its 
enemies. There is only one way whereby a given nation will be 
forced into capitulation and disarmament, and that is total war 
and occupation -- elements that were lacking in the aggression 
on Iraq, because the war was technologically-based and involved 
no confrontation. 
  Throughout history whenever Iraq came under siege, blockades 
have been shown to be less than foolproof. It has also been 
shown that a siege of a country that has borders with six 
countries cannot possibly be one hundred percent effective. 
  What the present crisis boils down to is that the United 
States wants Iraq to make concessions that it could not force on 
it through war. The war, whose real "hero" the war criminal 
George Bush fell from power, had more in common with fantasy 
than reality. 
  In their attitude toward Iraq, the United States and the 
West 
find themselves in a unique, unfamiliar situation. For them, 
war means their adversary's outright capitulation. Consider 
Germany and Japan, among others. For the first time ever, the 
West has faced a unique and special situation of its kind -- one 
in which the adversary has not been browbeaten into submission. 
This is despite the fact that that the adversary's forces were 
forced into a withdrawal, and, by Western standards, were at a 
qualitative disadvantage. 
  The West miscalculated. The victory claimed by the criminal 
Bush merely drove Iraqi forces from the governorate of Kuwait. 
However, that victory has failed to destroy the adversary's 
force or subjugate it. It is an established fact that it was 
the United States that brought the hostilities to a halt. It 
shied away from sending its combat troops deep inside Iraq, a 
substantial part of whose armed forces remained intact. 
  The result waffler Clinton would have liked the 1991 war to 
produce was a far cry from how it actually turned out. In the 
conventional terms of war and defeat, that war failed to turn 
out to the waffler Clinton's satisfaction. In conventional 
terms, the West is incapable of engaging in close combat, 
occupying enemy territory, or scouring every inch of territory 
for weapons to destroy them. The waffler Clinton and the West 
are betting on the sanctions to realize their ambitions in Iraq. 
We doubt that the sanctions will deliver the goods.

<F P=106> [Article by Mazhar 'Arif: "Toward International Control of </F>
Earth Satellites"] 
  [Text] It is time the earth satellites of a military and 
intelligence nature are placed under international control. For 
it is inconceivable for the big powers, headed by the United 
States, to continue violating the national independence and 
sovereignty of world nations for decades. 
  International control means restricting the activity of 
these 
satellites under an international treaty so that it does not 
extend beyond the borders of the states concered. 
  No doubt, the Third World countries are the main target of 
the hostile satellite activity conducted by the major states, 
especially the big capitalist powers. Therefore, they must 
either find the necessary means to counter the dangers of these 
satellites by taking the initiative to call an international 
conference to be attended by all states concerned in order to 
discuss this issue, or raise the matter with the UN General 
Assembly or Security Council, despite the hardships they might 
expect from the United States and its Western allies in the 
United Nations. 
  By stressing the danger of the espionage satellites to the 
Third World countries, we are not excluding their danger to some 
European and Asian states which are allies of the United States. 
But this alliance has not protected, and will not protect, the 
national independence and sovereignty of those states or their 
underground resources; nor will it protect telephone 
conversations between government officials, company owners, 
board directors, and, in fact, anything in those states which is 
considered vital to the United States. 
  Perhaps, it is important when seriously discussing the 
drafting of a treaty or an agreement on earth satellites to take 
into consideration the scores of satellites which have been 
orbiting the earth for several years carrying out intelligence 
and military missions for their states. 
  These satellites must be destroyed. The data they have 
collected so far must be placed at the disposal of the United 
Nations through an elected special commission, which would 
decide what to do with this data for the sake of protecting 
other nations' independence and sovereignty. There must be a 
complete ban on the use of outer space for military purposes. 
Furthermore, the United Nations should be informed about the 
programs of satellites which are used for non- military 
purposes. It would be useful if the programs of the United 
Nations and its cultural and social agencies, which are actually 
based on the UN Charter and not influenced by U.S. foreign 
policy, could be transmitted via these satellites on a worldwide 
basis in the interest of international peace and security and 
the cause of common understanding and friendship among peoples 
and nations. 
  Nobody doubts the hardships and financial problems facing 
the 
world organization and its various agencies. But launching a 
special UN satellite is a more worthwhile cause than spending 
money on so-called peace-keeping forces dispatched here and 
there under the UN flag, when the country responsible for 
starting crises in various parts of the world is the one that 
refuses to pay its financial contribution to the budget of the 
United Nations and its agencies, but which can be more generous 
sometimes when it comes to dirty missions undertaken by its 
forces and the forces of other nations in such countries as 
Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Angola, and elsewhere. 
  The Americans and their Western allies are turning the 
United 
Nations into a murderer and a policeman, and an arsonist and a 
fireman at the same time. This is the tragedy of the 
organization that was originally established for the sake of 
achieving and preserving world peace. It is sinking to its ears 
in the quagmire. 
  While the United States claims to defend international peace 
and security, what it does in practice is that it places the 
national security of world nations at the mercy of U.S. national 
security through these satellites and sophisticated espionage 
aircraft, which conduct their operations outside international 
control. Of course, all this takes place under the infamous 
U.S. theory that considers American interests and individuals as 
part of the national security that the U.S. Administraton must 
defend by every means, including the use of military force 
against any country where American interests or nationals may 
have been exposed to danger, despite the lack of a political 
motive. 
  It is strange indeed that nobody inside or outside the Third 
World countries has thought about the danger of U.S. and allied 
satellites to their national security. And if they have, we 
have not heard a single opposition voice to the operations of 
these satellites in international organizations. This attitude 
has encouraged and is still encouraging the imperialists to 
continue to use outer space for spying on other nations and 
collecting military and economic data with complete disregard 
for the meaning of the national independence and sovereignty of 
those nations.

  [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 17 (AFP)--The Islamic Resistance 
Movement (Hamas) offered Thursday [17 February] to pardon any 
Palestinian collaborator if he kills his Israeli contact or 
helps in the murder. 
  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the armed wing of the hardline Muslim 
fundamentalist group, said in a statement that it would give 
"protection and weapons" for "any repentant who kills his 
employer in the Israeli (secret) services." 
  Hamas claimed a former collaborator worked with militants to 
ambush and kill a member of the Shin Bet internal intelligence 
service and wound two others on the West Bank on Sunday. 
  Last November the fundamentalists, who have taken up arms to 
drive out Jews, announced that Palestinians who collaborate with 
the Israelis had two months to repent. 
  After the deadline the almost daily murders of alleged 
collaborators resumed in the occupied territories. 
  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam said on Tuesday that the fasting month 
of Ramadan now underway would be marked by the murder of 
Israelis to avenge fallen Palestinian militants. 
  Thirteen Palestinians have been killed for suspected 
collaboration with Israel since the start of this month alone, 
and Hamas has claimed responsibility for most of them. 
  According to the army, about 1,000 Palestinians -- including 
many drug dealers, addicts, prostitutes and personal vendetta 
victims -- have been killed by fellow Palestinians since the 
intifadah or uprising began in December 1987. 
  Meanwhile an Israeli stabbed by a Palestinian near the West 
Bank town of Hebron on December 29, died of his wounds on 
Thursday. Yuval Golan was the 201st Israeli to be killed by 
Palestinians during the intifadah. 
  Some 1,179 Palestinians have died from Israeli bullets over 
the same period, according to an AFP toll.

[FRC], which is led by Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna], yesterday 
denied what it described as "reports distributed by Algerian 
intelligence" claiming that its leader had died. It attacked 
the ruling authorities in Algeria and accused them of "being in 
the lap of the Jewish-Zionist-crusade movement." 
  The denial came in a statement signed by Husayn Bin-'Ali, a 
spokesman for Abu-Nidal's group, a copy of which was received by 
AL-HAYAH, days after that group was accused of assassinating a 
Jordanian diplomat in Beirut. The statement did not indicate 
the whereabouts of Anu-Nidal, whose group has also been accused 
of carrying out terrorist operations in Western and Arab 
countries. 
  The group said that it was optimistic when Major General 
Liamine Zeroual assumed the presidency in Algeria, "but we were 
surprised" when the media subservient to the Algerian regime 
continued "to escalate their false allegations." It added that 
Algerian intelligence, which is headed by General Tawfiq, 
"distributed a number of reports targeting our movement to 11 
Arab countries." It pointed out that the wording of the reports 
differed from one country to another, saying in part that 
"Abu-Nidal has died and a group of people linked to the 
authorities of a certain Arab country occupied the movement's 
headquarters," and that "the movement, in cooperation with some 
terrorist Islamic fundamentalist forces, intended to implement a 
certain plan" in some Arab states, including Egypt and Jordan. 
  The group sees "these fabrications as being Jewish-Zionist 
fabrications," and said that it has "accurate knowledge" of the 
circumstances of the emergence of the Algerian intelligence and 
security organs "which grew up in the laps of the 
Jewish-Zionist-crusade movement." 
  It further said that "these lies and fabrications are part 
of 
the large-scale campaign aimed at Judaizing the nation, 
containing its masses, and weaking the resolve of the nation's 
masses and of a number of Arab countries." In conclusion, it 
"rejected civil wars and fragmentation of the nation."

<F P=106> [Interview with Fatah Central Committee member Zakariyya </F>
al-Agha by Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] [Khashanah] How can we describe Fatah's position 
in the Gaza Strip, and what is the status of its relations with 
the other forces rejecting the Declaration of Principles 
agreement? 
  [Al-Agha] The position is good, although there are some 
minor problems. And our relations as a movement with the other 
forces are good. And we are doing our utmost to secure a 
minimum of coordination. And dialogues are continuing among us 
with a view to easing any tension that may emerge, especially in 
field positions. 
  I can say that relations with the national forces inside the 
Strip are satisfactory so far. But the main problem is the hot 
security situation. The reason is the spread of weapons inside 
the strip with the encouragement of the Israeli authorities and 
under their eyes. This situation in turn creates numerous 
security problems and excesses against citizens. 
  [Khashanah] How can this situation be brought under control? 
  [Al-Agha] We are trying together with the other national 
forces to bring the security problem under control and to 
confront all the excesses taking place. However, the 
comprehensive solution to this situation will take place after 
the establishment of a Palestinian national authority that can 
bring an end to these regrettable aspects and guarantee the 
Palestinian citizens' security and safety. 
  [Khashanah] Social and economic conditions in the Gaza Strip 
are worse than in the West Bank. What is the effect of that on 
the political situation? 
  [Al-Agha] There are problems resulting from the bad economic 
situation, especially the spread of unemployment in the strip. 
Many Palestinian establishments are suffering severe financial 
straits, and their workers have not received their wages for 
several months. In addition, families of the martyrs and 
detainees have not received the allowances decided for them. 
This situation is attributable to the scarcity of the PLO's 
financial resources and the systematic Israeli economic policy 
against Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories. 
  Furthermore, the delay in implementing the Declaration of 
Principles agreement between the PLO and Israel in addition to 
the obstacles created by the Israeli side during the 
negotiations to obstruct progress are all factors which have 
created a state of frustration and impatience among citizens -- 
which has led to psychological worry and tension and maybe some 
regrettable actions from time to time. 
  [Khashanah] What are the potential effects of the 
agreement's implementation on the situation in the strip in the 
light of the meeting with President 'Arafat? 
  [Al-Agha] We discussed political and organizational matters 
whose positive results I hope will emerge in the stage ahead. 
And I hope that the national authority will begin to play its 
role inside the occupied territories so that a new era in the 
Palestinian people's history will begin -- an era when the 
occupation will disappear.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim al-Zuray'i, "a senior Fatah official </F>
in the Gaza Strip," by Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] [Khashanah] What did you discuss with the Fatah 
leadership and President 'Arafat in recent days? 
  [Al-Zuray'i] We discussed matters pertaining purely to the 
movement and we also discussed the security situation, the 
people's suffering in the strip, and the economic blockade 
against our people. I believe that the hot security situation 
in Gaza is a result of the bad economic situation but Israel 
also is not unconnected with the disturbances and sedition. It 
helps foment internal conflict in the occupied territory by 
flooding the Strip with arms via "collaborators," but Palestine 
cannot be turned into another Afghanistan or Somalia because 
there is profound national awareness and the state of the 
political movement is good despite the fact that the people are 
in dire need of essential goods and normal living conditions. 
  [Khashanah] How do you explain the growing phenomenon of 
liquidation of "collaborators" with the occupation? 
  [Al-Zuray'i] This is a new phenomenon and it is exaggerated. 
I believe that under no circumstances should a gunman become 
magistrate, judge, and executioner. The collaborators can be 
classified into categories. There are those who are beyond 
reform and have crossed the point of no return, and there are 
those who got involved inadvertently or were wronged. Some of 
the latter could be returned to the national ranks or 
neutralized. 
  At any rate, the situation in the Gaza Strip is difficult, 
like the other occupied areas. The cause of the difficulty is 
the Palestinian masses' frustration resulting from the Israeli 
procrastination on the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement. 
  [Khashanah] What is your estimate of the number of the Gaza 
Strip detainees? 
  [Al-Zuray'i] The general estimate is over 10,000 detainees 
including 6,000 detainees from Gaza. That affects the people of 
the Strip. In our meeting with the Palestinian leadership in 
Tunis we concentrated on the need for a clear timetable and 
deadline for the release of the Palestinian revolution's 
detainees regardless of their organizations and affiliations 
because the PLO embraces all sectors of the Palestinian people. 
Without fulfillment of that objective there can be no 
meaningful agreement. 
  [Khashanah] What was the leadership's answer? 
  [Al-Zuray'i] There was official response and agreement with 
that view because the agreement would be worthless without the 
release of the detainees and prisoners. In fact that would be 
the only step that would ameliorate the agreement or make it 
less ugly. 
  [Khashanah] What kind of relations exist between Fatah and 
the other factions which reject the agreement, in the Gaza Strip? 
  [Al-Zuray'i] We and many cadres and leaderships of these 
factions in the Strip have the long struggle in common and we 
have had dialogues with them in prison and outside. We always 
maintained that the homeland is above all organizations. There 
is cooperation now in all fields, apart from the differences of 
opinion. There is field coordination at a level higher than the 
level of coordination outside the occupied territory. It is 
enhanced by the sense of responsibility demonstrated by all 
factions. 
  [Khashanah] How would friction and conflict be avoided when 
Fatah becomes a ruling party and assumes power? 
  [Al-Zuray'i] We have discussed these matters as 
Palestinian citizens with the parties concerned, especially the 
Islamic parties, at an early stage. There can be no doubt that 
many brother leaders and members of the factions at home have a 
clear vision. Now the common vision leans toward finding a 
clear national program that would answer all questions in the 
next phase. But so far there is no national program for the 
prospective Palestinian authority. We hope that, through joint 
meetings and seminars, we will be able to formulate an initial 
concept of a national program that would confirm the principles 
of democracy, independence of the judiciary, freedom of the 
press, human rights, and the rule of law. These are the 
principles on which there is Palestinian consensus. The 
situation at home will not stabilize without the fulfillment of 
these objectives as the main foundations of national authority. 
  [Khashanah] Did you discuss the Palestinian draft 
constitution in the strip? 
  [Al-Zuray'i] There is no crystallized final draft yet. The 
dialogue on it is continuing. All the Palestinian people should 
be consulted on it. 
  [Khashanah] Did you and the leadership make any practical 
decisions regarding the state of the movement in the Strip? 
  [Al-Zuray'i] Decisions were made on most of the issues we 
came to discuss with the leadership. We are waiting for the 
implementation of the recent Cairo agreement and we hope that 
will be done before the end of the month, as President 'Arafat 
told us. 
  [Khashanah] What matters relating to the Strip were 
discussed? 
  [Al-Zuray'i] Organizational matters, the security situation, 
and the people's suffering. 
  [Khashanah] Do you believe that the phenomenon of 
liquidating the collaborators is likely to continue? 
  [Al-Zuray'i] Negative aspects have appeared between members 
of the Palestinian people since 1936, between families and 
between tribes, resulting in many casualties. That is why we 
have fought that phenomenon and still do, strongly, and we hope 
that we will turn over that leaf quickly to protect the lives of 
these people. I believe that Palestinian justice will be fair to 
everyone and will bring to account everyone who collaborated 
with the occupation. That is why we say let us leave this 
matter to the Palestinian authority and national justice, for it 
to task those who did wrong and be fair to those who were 
wronged. 
  We found the other factions responsive to that view. Those 
who carry out the liquidation operations do not take orders. 
They are youngsters under the age of 18. Their actions are 
usually based on personal views.

<F P=106> [Report by Rashid Khashanah: "Fatah Central Committee: </F>
Baraq Blocks Way to Progress in Taba Negotiations"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- President Yasir 'Arafat yesterday received 
the ambassadors of the Arab and foreign states accredited to the 
PLO in Tunis. The Palestinian news agency WAFA said the meeting 
dealt with the latest political developments, the current 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations which have so far led to the 
signing of the Cairo agreement, the obstacles still preventing 
progress, and implementation of the Declaration of Principles 
and the need to honor the dates stated therein. 
  It added that the meeting "also covered the economic 
situation in the occupied Palestinian territory and the aid 
needed for its reconstruction and development." 
  Meanwhile, Fatah's Central Committee yesterday attacked 
Israeli Chief of Staff General Ehud Baraq and the other generals 
of the military establishment, maintaining that "they found that 
the opportunity was right for them to pounce on the political 
process on security grounds." 
  The movement's central internal bulletin, which appears 
biweekly under the name of Fatah, said yesterday that Baraq and 
the military "were surprised by the Oslo agreement, which was 
signed without their knowledge and without consultation with 
them." The bulletin, which expresses the views of Fatah's 
Central Committee members, said that "Baraq spread his staff 
into the negotiation process in such a way as to block any 
possibility of progress in Taba. He succeeded in blocking even 
the deadline set for the signing of an agreement on withdrawal 
from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area." 
  It also attacked Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin for 
responding to the generals' position. It said that "the 
timetable stipulated in the Declaration of Principles agreement 
is no longer sacrosanct to Rabin. Army complications are 
beginning to go some way in influencing the concept of 
withdrawal from Gaza." 
  It stressed that in the view of the chief of staff and the 
military establishment, the agreement does not mean withdrawal 
from Gaza but rather a redeployment within the strip "to defend 
the borders against foreign threats and guarantee security of 
the settlements." It added that he instructed his followers in 
the Israeli negotiating delegation to impose that concept of 
withdrawal. 
  It also attacked the Israeli military establishment for 
refusing to recognize the PLO as the Palestinian people's 
representative "even though the majority of Israeli politicians, 
foremost among them Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, understood 
the significance of recognizing the PLO and Peres instructed his 
ambassadors and his UN representative to hold contacts with the 
ambassadors of the state of Palestine and with the PLO office 
directors and its observer at the United Nations, reflecting 
that understanding."

<F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, Palestinian activist, by </F>
Yoni Ben-Menahem in Jerusalem on 17 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Ben-Menahem] How do you assess the peace process? 
  [Al-Husayni] [words indistinct] ready to hear even about 
that. 
  [Ben-Menahem] But there has been progress today in the Taba 
talks. 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes, progress has been achieved in the Taba 
talks and I believe that it is possible to reach agreement by 
the end of this month, but all this is conditional on the 
Palestinian people's perception that something is happening on 
the ground. Otherwise, even if, ultimately, after further delay 
a good agreement is reached, a stage will come where the people 
will no longer be prepared to hear what we are saying. 
Consequently, it will be difficult to implement any agreement 
that is reached. 
  [Ben-Menahem] What do you expect now from the Israelis? 
  [Al-Husayni] I believe that the Israelis should begin 
releasing prisoners, should clearly state that no prisoner will 
remain in Israeli jails, should change the firing orders in the 
streets, and should stop demolishing homes under different 
pretexts. It is unnecessary now for certain parties to embark on 
demolishing homes becuase their owners had obtained or did not 
obtain a license. Some issues pertaining to land must be frozen 
until the end of the negotiating process. The continuation of 
all these acts, the continued construction of new buildings in 
settlements, the expansion in Ma'ale Adumim, all these things 
actually lead to a single outcome, namely, that the Palestinian 
street will become more convinced that Israel is not serious in 
the peace process.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, chairman of </F>
the Palestinian Radio and Television Corporation and a member of 
the Palestinian negotiating team to the Arab-Israeli peace 
talks, in Jerusalem, by Fayiz al-Miliji, in Cairo; date not 
given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Miliji] Welcome to our program. 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] Thank you. 
  [Al-Miliji] Palestinian President 'Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres signed an agreement in Cairo, which was 
followed by talks in Taba. Do you feel the Palestinian issue is 
on its way to a final settlement? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] As brother President 'Arafat said, the name of 
Palestine has been placed firmly on the map. What our 
negotiating teams are doing in Taba, Washington, and elsewhere 
is to confirm this political right. In my opinion, the 
Palestinian issue is on its way to a solution. This is true, 
despite the numerous difficulties and the obstacles still facing 
the two sides and holding back a final settlement. 
  [Al-Miliji] The entire world, East and West, has long 
provided the Middle East with weapons. Now the Middle East 
region is looking forward to peace. What do the Palestinians 
expect from the world in time of peace? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] I believe the road toward creating a Middle 
East region that enjoys prosperity, peace, and security will be 
full of challenges. One such challenge has to do with the 
weapons to which you have just referred. The world must provide 
the various countries in the region, particularly the 
Palestinian people, with expertise and massive economic support. 
This aid is needed if the Palestinians are to rebuild their 
infrastructure and cope with the fast-paced economic changes in 
the world. 
  Peace is more than signing a paper or agreement. It is the 
translation of these agreements into tangible facts and into 
measures enabling the regions' nations to live in peace and 
security. Peace involves security, justice, and rights for 
everyone. 
  [Al-Miliji] As the moment of Palestinian self-determination 
in the transitional phase draws near, how do you see future 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] My dear friend, the relationship between the 
brothers in Jordan and the brother Palestinians is long and 
special. Due to the Palestinian tragedy, the Palestinians 
blended with the Jordanians to form one family. I think future 
Palestinian-Jordanian relations will be special. The 
Palestinians also have warm relations with other Arabs, 
particularly the Egyptians, and their relationship with Syria 
and Lebanon is one of cooperation. 
  But specific and clear political programs must be 
formulated. 
I think the Palestinian and Jordanian peoples should be left 
free to determine the shape of their relations once the 
Palestinian people are free from the yoke of Israeli occupation 
and have restored their rights, which, I believe, is just a 
matter of time. 
  [Al-Miliji] In the latest meetings of the 
Palestinian-Jordanian Committee, did the two sides discuss the 
future relationship between the Jordanians and Palestinians once 
the Palestinians get their right to self-determination? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] Yes they did. There are several committees 
that meet occasionally, such as the Jordanian-Palestinian Higher 
Coordination Committee, which will draft things like economic 
ties, the refugees issue, the crossing points, and other issues 
relating to the daily life of the Palestinian and Jordanian 
peoples. I believe that all these relations and drafts worked 
out by the PLO institutions and the Jordanian Government will 
necessarily put things in focus for the Palestinian people once 
the final status of their political future, in the form of an 
independent Palestinian state on Palestinian soil, is determined. 
  [Al-Miliji] This leads us to another topic, namely, 
relations 
with sisterly Egypt. Palestinian police cadres recently 
received training at the Egyptian Police Academy. As chairman 
of the Palestinian Radio and Television Corporation, what are 
the avenues for prospective cooperation between you and the 
Egyptian Radio and Television Union [RTU]? 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] It has been my honor to meet with the brothers 
in Egyptian radio and television and with some production 
circles. I was particularly pleased that Information Minister 
Safwat al-Sharif gave us all the necessary facilities to train 
the Palestinian cadres, such as the police cadres. 
Approximately 60 Palestinian media cadres from the occupied 
territories and from the diaspora are due in Egypt on 23 March 
to receive a six-week training course along with their Egyptian 
colleagues at the Egyptian RTU. Once this course is over, we 
may say we have cadres who are well versed in the established 
Egyptian school of media, which could benefit us. Our relations 
with the brothers in Egypt are very close, fraternal, and long, 
not just in the form of agreements, but also in practice, going 
back even before 1948. 
  [Al-Miliji] Abu-'Ayyash: Thank you very much. 
  [Abu-'Ayyash] Thank you.

  [Text] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni 
Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party, arrived in Amman yesterday at the head 
of a Yemeni delegation which includes Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah 
Muhsin, minister of housing and urban planning; Muhammad 
'Abd-al-Rahman, head of the Yemeni vice president's office; and 
a number of officials and media men to prepare for a visit by 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, who will sign the Yemeni document of pledge and 
accord in Amman on Sunday, 20 February. The document aims at 
ending the crisis in fraternal Yemen so that the brothers would 
resume their march of unity, democracy, and prosperity, God 
willing. 
  On arrival at Amman Airport, Salim Salih Muhammad made a 
press statement in which he expressed his thanks and deep 
appreciation for His Majesty King Husayn, the Jordanian 
Government, and the Jordanian people for hosting the Yemeni 
reconciliation meeting in Amman of all the Arabs. He said: We 
are pleased that Amman is the venue of this meeting which is 
awaited by the Arab nation and those who love democracy, 
especially the Yemeni people, since the document which will be 
signed in Amman is the common denominator which was agreed on by 
the Yemeni people represented by their popular and political 
parties and key figures. 
  He said that the Amman meeting will contribute to 
entrenching 
democracy, which the Yemeni community is witnessing during these 
historic moments. He noted the pan-Arab role Jordan is playing 
on all levels. 
  The delegation was received at the airport by Dr. Ma'n 
Abu-Nuwar, deputy prime minister; Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Nusur, 
minister of public works and housing; and the Yemeni ambassador 
in Amman.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Yemeni Unity"] </F>
  [Text] Some Arabs and their yellow press are giving 
preference to the differences among the Yemeni brothers over 
other issues. Some are even inflating these differences more 
than the enemy. Some are trading in them, as if betrayal of the 
homeland's unity is a profitable trade. Some become angry and 
rancorous every time there are reports that the Yemeni brothers 
are about to reach an agreement to contain their differences and 
sign a document of pledge which will safeguard the dignity of 
the one Yemeni homeland and maintain its great pride. 
  Some Arabs' hostility to all forms of unity wherever it may 
be is an old but new hostility. We know that it is in their 
interest to maintain this hostility. We also know that they are 
not annoyed when they are accused of regionalism, conspiring 
against unity, and of having a continuous willingness to strike 
at the nation's dearest principles and convictions. It is 
important for them to maintain their own interests, which 
contradict those of the one Arab nation. It is also important 
for them to hold on to their privileges and trivialities, which 
harm the one nation's privileges. Therefore, they continue to 
stand in the trench of fragmentation against the trench of 
unity. They also continue to stand in the front of putrid 
regionalism against the front of honorable supporters of 
pan-Arabism. Their stand and press cannot but be a continuation 
of their stands toward every unionist plan which carried great 
hopes through the efforts of sincere people or which left behind 
many wounds as a result of disappointment caused by those who 
are hostile to these hopes as well as the unionist hopes and 
aspirations. 
  Yemen's unity came as a painful strike to all Arab 
separatists. The unionists' concern to protect and entrench this 
unity harms those who used their press, money, movements, and 
connections against the nation efforts to eliminate the elements 
of its weakness, chief of which are division and fragmentation. 
Therefore, we look forward to the meeting of Yemeni brothers in 
Amman, the capital of reconciliation and accord, with joy, hope, 
and optimism in order to achieve a big step on the road to 
entrenching Yemeni unity and striking a strong blow to the faces 
of the enemies who are most hostile to our unity, liberty, and 
dignity. This takes place at a time when we need some joy after 
the Gulf tragedy took away all our joy for reasons that are no 
secret to anyone and with means that are known to all.

  [Text] Finance Minister Sami Qammuh has said continued use 
of the Jordanian dinar in the occupied territories after 
establishment of the Palestinian entity will not affect its 
value, but will keep the dinar strong and stable. 
  Answering questions posed by journalists yesterday, Qammuh 
said the stability of the dinar inside and outside Jordan is 
guaranteed by the foreign currency cover. 
  He expressed the hope that coordination and cooperation in 
all fields will continue between Jordan and the Palestinian 
entity in the future. 
  Qammuh held a news conference at the Customs Department in 
which he explained all aspects of the implementation of the 
sales tax and its impact on the Jordanian economy and citizens.

<F P=106> [By G.H. Jansen] </F>
  [Text] Damascus--Now that the tragic death in a car crash 
of Major Basil al-Asad, the eldest son and heir apparent of 
President Hafiz al-Asad, has been mourned and a consensus on who 
will ultimately succeed the president seems to have developed, 
Syria can get back to its main preoccupation, the peace process 
with Israel. 
  On the streets of Damascus, one can still see black mourning 
flags and long black streamers hanging down the facades of 
buildings while tens of thousands of pictures of Basil are on 
almost every wall. Although Basil was not a real candidate to 
succeed his father because at 32 he was eight years too young 
for the post, his death revealed that for at least five and 
perhaps 10 years, he was being groomed for leadership through 
service in the army and as his father's personal assistant, 
during which time he performed delicate negotiations in Lebanon. 
  Three weeks after his death, a consensus on what the 
succession will be has emerged. It is expected that there will 
be no one leader after President al-Asad but a collective 
leadership of, perhaps, three persons (because a triumvirate is 
more stable than a duumvirate) while the primus inter pares, 
eventually, will most probably be 'Abd al-Halim Khaddam, 
presently the first vice president and for many years the 
forceful foreign minister and Syrian viceroy for Lebanon. But 
since Mr. Khaddam is a Sunni Muslim, he would require the 
backing of the real holders of power, a group of generals 
belonging to the 'Alawite minority, who, though only 11 per cent 
of the population, have been the overlords in Syria for over two 
decades. 
  The succession question out of the way, for the time being 
Syrian attention switched back to the other major preoccupation, 
peace with Israel. This, too, has been clarified and by none 
other than the main Israeli negotiator with Syria, Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres, who on Feb. 11, said that "there was no 
chance of an Israeli-Syrian agreement"--which is true--in the 
present format of their talks-- which is untrue. There is 
nothing wrong with the bilateral format except for the fact that 
in the talks an irresistible force, Syrian determination, has 
come up against an immovable object, Israel's intransignce: 
Syria has not budged an inch from its well-established position 
that Israel must vacate the whole of the occupied Golan 
Heights--no return, no peace--and Israel will not budge an inch 
in refusing to return the Golan only at best the smaller portion 
of it. 
  The Syrians have almost reached the point of accepting that 
the Israelis are never going to concede on the Golan. The 
Syrians will accept this position because they will have no 
choice. But Israel will not get the peace which it says it 
wants: "The Arabs cannot make war without Egypt and cannot make 
peace without Syria." For how long more would Syria be prepared 
to go on with the present fruitless exercise? -- Perhaps another 
half year. 
  A recent display of Israel's stubborn arrogance has further 
convinced the Syrians that that is what is going to happen. 
They noted the way in which the Israelis slapped their great 
and good friend U.S. President Bill Clinton in the face when 
they rubbished his claim that Syrian clarifications at the 
Geneva summit of what Syria meant by full peace and 
normalisation were "new" and "very important," which is exactly 
so. And having been slapped, Mr. Clinton, like a good 
Christian, turned the other cheek, when a few days ago, his 
secretary of state announced officially that the U.S. was not 
going to pressure Israel on withdrawing from the Golan. 
  But because the Israelis, like that other difficult and 
dangerous people, the Serbs, only make concessions when under 
pressure, where is the pressure on Israel going to come from 
when the U.S. has opted out? Perhaps from the Palestinian 
people in the occupied territories who, individually, are 
killing individual Israelis on an almost daily basis. That 
would explain why Damascus is the headquarters of no less than 
10 "rejectionist" Palestinian groups which oppose the peace 
process and particularly the Oslo accord. It would also explain 
why Damascus refuses to curb the pro-Iranian Hizballah, which 
maintains pressure on Israeli forces occupying parts of southern 
Lebanon. The message from Damascus is clear: If there is no 
peace, there will be an Arab war of attrition against Israelis 
in occupied Arab territories.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the katyusha that 
fell on the Galilee was fired by a marginal organization. Our 
correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports from the broadcast van at the 
Labor Party building: 
  [Begin recording] [Tal] The Labor Party Bureau is today 
addressing many issues. Among other things, Prime Minister 
Rabin was asked about the katyusha attack in the north. Rabin 
said this attack was contrary to all the understandings attained 
in the wake of Operation Accountability. He noted, however, 
that there was no basic change in the situation: 
  [Rabin] Our understandings with Syria regarding Hizballah 
remain in effect. Today we know the katyusha was launched by a 
splinter Palestinian group that seceded from Fatah due to its 
opposition to the Declaration of Principles in particular and to 
the peace process in general. We will operate as we deem 
necessary. This organization calls itself the Black 13 September 
Organization -- this does not refer to the 13th of September 
1970, but rather to 1993. I believe that this is a marginal 
organization that does not even approximate the magnitude of 
threat posed by Hizballah. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will 
find the appropriate way to deal with this issue. 
  [Tal] Referring to Syria, Rabin said the ball is now in its 
court. Progress depends not only on Israel, but on Syria as 
well. 
  [Rabin] Why is there no progress? Because Syria poses 
demands we cannot accept. We must adhere to our positions, and 
if Syria wants peace it must adjust to our demands and meet us 
halfway. [end recording]

  [Text] In a telephone interview with MBC today, Israeli 
Defense Ministry Spokesman (Odet Ben'ami) said the Palestinian 
Black 13 September Organization [as heard] fired a Katyusha 
rocket at northern Israel last night. He blamed Syria and 
Lebanon on the grounds that Syria controls most of Lebanon and 
that all the activities of Hizballah and other organizations are 
carried out under its supervision, as he put it. 
  Black September broke away from the Fatah Movement after the 
signing of the Oslo accord in September. It is led by Colonel 
Munir Maqdah, who is currently in Lebanon. 
  In contacts with MBC this evening, a Syrian source rejected 
Israel's charge that Damascus is responsible for firing the 
Katyusha rocket at the Galilee. He emphasized that it is not 
Syria's task to guarantee protection for Israel.

  [Text] An Israeli Arab delegation is to travel in the 
coming days to Syria to extend condolences to President Hafiz 
al-Asad on the death of his son last month. The delegation will 
be headed by Knesset Member [MK] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah. 
Darawshah says Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa personally 
intervened to make the historic visit possible. 
  Here in Israel, a senior official in the Prime Minister's 
Office called the news of the Syrian decision encouraging. 
David Ze'ev reports: 
  On Tuesday [15 February], Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said 
a 
positive reply to MK Darawshah's request would mark some kind of 
change in the Syrian attitude toward Israel. At the Prime 
Minister's Office last night, a senior source reacted by saying 
the fact that President al-Asad has given the Israeli Arab 
delegation permission to make the trip contains in it something 
encouraging. The source went on to say that there could be a 
connection between the positive Syrian reply and the recent 
statements coming out of Israel that Damascus is not showing any 
openness toward Israel. Both Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres have spoken out strongly on the issue 
during the past week. 
  [Begin recording] [Darawshah] As I know, it's the first 
time that the Syrian Government is allowing any Israeli Arab 
citizen to enter Syria. 
  [Ze'ev] When will you be going? 
  [Darawshah] I suppose in the coming few days. We got the 
permission through the Egyptian ambassador in Israel, in which 
he informed me that the Syrians are welcoming the coming of the 
delegation. 
  [Ze'ev] Did the Egyptians act as mediators? 
  [Darawshah] They made their good efforts to convey our 
message to Mr. President Hafiz al-Asad, to pass the message, and 
also to mediate as brothers -- especially the foreign minister, 
Mr. 'Amr Musa, who intervened in this issue. 
  [Ze'ev] Will you take the opportunity to promote 
Syrian-Israeli peace efforts or the release of missing Israeli 
servicemen, any issue like that? 
  [Darawshah] We are going to pay our condolences as a human 
issue, and we do not think that we are going for political 
reasons. Mr. Rabin did not ask me to pass any messages, and he 
knows very well that I'm going on a human basis. [end recording] 
  MK Darawshah says his delegation will number 30 or 31 
people: 
mayors, poets, writers, religious and other leading 
personalities among the Arab population in Israel. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 18 February 
adds that upon learning from the Egyptian ambassador that he had 
been granted permission to visit Syria, MK Darawshah "contacted 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in his capacity as defense minister 
and asked his permission. The prime minister immediately gave 
his consent. Moreover, Rabin emphasized he would take all the 
necessary steps to facilitate the visit. The prime minister 
informed Darawshah that he has authorized Eytan Haber, the 
director of his bureau, to be in constant contact with Darawshah 
in order to pave the way for the departure of the delegation."]

Gid'on Zelinger; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Zelinger] We will now talk about the political 
agenda with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. Shalom to you, sir. 
  [Peres] Shalom. 
  [Zelinger] An Israeli delegation -- albeit one consisting of 
Israeli Arabs -- is due to depart for Syria. Will you ask 
Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah or any other delegation 
member to convey any message to President al-Asad? 
  [Peres] I do not think that is necessary, because the 
purpose of this visit is to convey condolences. That was the 
reason cited in the application for permission to visit, and I 
think it should be honored. There is no need to turn a 
condolence visit into something else. Moreover, sending 
messages is not a problem. There are constant exchanges. 
  [Zelinger] I know Israel has been trying to open more than 
one channel of negotiations with Syria. 
  [Peres] That is correct. I know that on this occasion, 
however, the visas were granted for the purpose of calling on 
the bereaved family, and this should be honored. 
  [Zelinger] Would you like to comment on the very fact of the 
visit? Is the departure of an Israeli delegation to Damascus an 
important event? 
  [Peres] I think it is a positive signal and I welcome it, 
although it has its limitations. It does not yet herald a burst 
of possibilities. It is a signal -- a positive and not at all 
negligible one -- but that is all it is. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 16 Feb (MENA)--Shulamit Aloni, Israeli 
director of scientific research and communications [title as 
received], has called for the return of the occupied Golan 
Heights to Syria. She has also expressed her opposition to the 
idea of holding a referendum on withdrawal from the Heights, 
stressing that the Israeli Government has full authority to make 
a political decision without the need for a referendum. 
  In an interview to be published in the 17 February issue of 
the magazine AL-MUSAWWAR, she said that in accordance with 
international law, the Golan Heights must return to Syria. She 
indicated that the problem with the negotiations lies in the 
timeframe and the security arrangements. 
  The Israeli minister criticized the Israeli Government's 
lukewarm reaction to the Geneva summit between Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  On the Israeli request for a meeting between President 
al-Asad and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, Aloni 
explained that such a meeting might set things in motion. 
  On Israel's arbitrary measures in the occupied territories, 
Aloni said: In my opinion, we as a people are living with a 
sharp moral dilemma. We speak about democracy and human rights 
while we rob the Palestinian people of their rights. She 
indicated that the mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO 
will entrench equality and mutual respect. 
  Regarding armaments and nuclear deterrents, Aloni said: 
Israel's fears are from Iran and Iraq. These fears extend to 
the whole region. So Israel is arming itself with long-range 
weapons that act as a deterrent against Iraq and Iran and, to 
some extent, against Syria. She indicated that after progress 
is made in the peace process, this topic will be submitted for 
discussion with Egypt and Syria. 
  On Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon, Aloni said Israel 
has no ambitions in Lebanon. It will withdraw from south 
Lebanon when peace is established with Syria.

  [Text] In an interview with THE NEW YORK TIMES, PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat sharply criticized the United States for refusing 
to intervene in the negotiations between Israel and the PLO to 
ensure the implementation of their agreement. He reiterated his 
accusation that Israel is handing out large quantities of 
weapons in the territories to provoke a civil war among the 
Palestinians after its withdrawal. According to him, this is a 
well-planned operation being carried out under the auspices of 
several Israeli officers in the territories. Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yosi Beilin categorically denied 'Arafat's allegations: 
  [Begin Beilin recording] The very fact that 'Arafat makes 
such remarks today certainly cannot add to the kind of good 
atmosphere we need to complete the negotiations. I consider it 
a big mistake on his part, and I hope it will not hinder the 
completion of the negotiations so that we may wrap up all the 
issues on the agenda with regard to Gaza and Jericho and proceed 
to implement the decisions we have made. [end recording]

that Israel has decided not to participate in international 
peacekeeping missions abroad. 
  [Begin recording] [Beilin] Our only decision is to take 
part in humanitarian efforts in Angola. We are ready to do 
that, and I will inform the UN secretary general about that 
decision. Maybe later on, in due time, such a decision that you 
are referring to will be taken, but time is not ripe now to take 
it. 
  [Essing] What kind of participation will Israel be giving to 
this Angolan project? 
  [Beilin] We are speaking about establishing and controlling 
a hospital in Angola, sending doctors and some other medical 
services to Angola, and to keep this hospital for a while. 
  [Essing] Any time frame for this? When will this be taking 
place? 
  [Beilin] There are still many conditions, and the first one 
is that there will be peace in Angola. This is far from being 
the reality, and the fighting between Savimbi and Dos Santos in 
Angola still takes place, so we cannot know exactly the timing 
of such a decision, but it won't be tomorrow. [end recording] 
  In an address last night, Beilin said also that two 
representatives of countries he declined to name recently 
visited Israel seeking advice and training in the resolution of 
disputes. He did not elaborate.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres announced last night 
that negotiations with the European Commission on a new trade 
agreement will begin in Brussels next week. The foreign 
minister spoke to reporters in Jerusalem at a joint news 
conference with the vice president of the European Commission, 
Manuel Marin. Steve Linde reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Linde] Foreign Minister Peres said the 
talks that would lead to a free trade zone between Israel and 
the European Commission will begin on the 21st of February. 
Peres said the new trade agreement would represent a new 
chapter in relations between Israel and the European Union, and 
he spelled out the implications of the agreement: 
  [Peres] In addition to be raised in the rank so we shall 
become an associated member of the European Economic Space, 
specifically what we want are the following: to be a full 
member of the research and development community. The second 
point, economically speaking, is that we would like to be able 
to produce in Israel products that will be considered as 
products of the Common Market. Thirdly, we would like to extend 
and enlarge our participation and the participation on a mutual 
basis of the Common Market in public tenders and governmental 
tenders. Fourth, we would like to have a slight improvement in 
the quota of our agricultural exports, particularly when we are 
opening our markets -- as the minister of agriculture has 
mentioned already -- to the products of the people of the 
territories. 
  [Linde] The vice president of the European Commission, 
Manuel Marin, said the agreement being offered to Israel was 
unique and could not apply to any other country. 
  [Marin] At the end of the negotiation we are going to have 
with Israel a free trade zone. Well, this specific situation 
concerning trade, industry, research, and technology, etc., 
etc., is only possible to have with Israel, not with another 
neighbor, because of the different economic development. 
  [Linde] The new agreement will replace the more limited 
cooperation accord concluded in 1975 between the EC and Israel. 
Marin said it was made possible by the Declaration of Principles 
signed between Israel and the PLO and reflects the Union's 
backing for the Middle East peace process. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says Israel will 
take all the necessary measures to stop Lebanese terrorists from 
launching katyusha rockets towards northern Israel. Peres made 
the comment after a meeting in Jerusalem this morning with his 
Portuguese counterpart, Jose Durao Barroso. The foreign 
minister of Portugal said his country supports the new trade 
agreement between Israel and the European Union. Steve Linde 
has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Linde] [passage omitted] The 
Portuguese foreign minister noted that negotiations are now 
beginning for a new trade agreement between Israel and the 
European Union, and he added, Portugal firmly supports the move. 
  [Barroso] Now we are going to begin negotiations -- the 
European Union with Israel -- for a new agreement, and Portugal 
was among the countries from the very beginning that supported 
that very idea of a new mandate to negotiate with Israel. 
  [Linde] Foreign Minister Peres pointed out that Prime 
Minister Rabin will visit Portugal later this month. He 
explained the importance of Portugal to Israel: 
  [Peres] Our interest is many-sided, the bilateral relations, 
which now took a momentum in the domain of the economy and 
culture. We just exchanged a protocol to abolish visas, 
something that will enable tourists and businessmen from the two 
countries to visit and act in better conditions. Then again, 
Portugal is a very important member in the EC, and our relations 
with the EC also has many sides: political and economic. No 
wonder [words indistinct] side and the peace process. 
  [Linde] Foreign Minister Durao Barroso also met with the 
prime minister this morning and held talks with the Palestinian 
delegation in East Jerusalem after his meeting with Shim'on 
Peres. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 17 February 
carries a related report on "Barroso's meeting in East Jerusalem 
with Faysal al-Husayni, in which he promised the Palestinians 
aid in developing tourism. After the meeting, al-Husayni said 
that despite the progress in the talks, Israel is not taking 
steps to prove to the residents of the territories that peace is 
drawing closer; therefore, they are losing faith in the 
political process. Al-Husayni confirmed that the Palestinians 
plan to set up a shadow municipality in Jerusalem to handle East 
Jerusalem during the autonomy period."]

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto; </F>
place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] My dear countrymen! Today, I want to talk about an 
issue that has no relation to day-to-day politics. Democracy 
does not just mean a war to secure power. The country has 
witnessed enough of the tussle for power. The people are fed up 
with this tussle. That is why the people elected a popular 
government in the most free and fair elections in the history of 
the nation. The people voted in favor of political stability, 
and they want to see changes in their lives. They want 
prosperity for their children. God willing, your government will 
provide this prosperity. 
  There were people who forgot the poor masses in the tussle 
for power. This could not continue for long. The country was 
faced with severe difficulties when we assumed office. We took 
the steps to speedily overcome these difficulties. Political 
independence is incomplete if the economic difficulties remain 
unsolved. We have to work for the people's economic stability 
so as to maintain our political independence. We have to make 
our people satisfied and prosperous. 
  It is not possible to bring about economic prosperity merely 
by the government wishing to do so. It cannot be realized by 
merely providing a legal infrastructure. It cannot be possible 
merely through deregulation. A strong infrastructure needs to 
be built to achieve this objective, and the most important 
component of this infrastructure is energy. The Water and Power 
Development Authority [WAPDA] is practicing power-load shedding 
due to the deficit in power generation during the last few 
years. Fifteen or 16 years ago, people did not even know what 
load-shedding was. Now, it has become a routine affair. There 
are power outages for several hours daily in cities and 
villages. In rural areas, sometimes there is no power for 
several days. Factories have been closed in urban areas due to 
the lack of power, thereby leading to lower industrial 
production. In rural areas, the irrigation tube wells cannot be 
operated due to load-shedding, thereby affecting agricultural 
output. 
  On the one hand, there was no increase in power production 
during the past few years, while on the other, demand kept 
increasing by 12 percent annually. The country is currently 
facing a deficit of nearly 2,000 megawatts of power. Urgent 
steps are needed to meet the demand for power and to stop the 
load-shedding. If we fail to do so, then it will shatter all 
our dreams of economic development and we will be lost in a 
blind alley. 
  Incorrect policies of the past are the main reasons behind 
this serious crisis. Special attention was paid to power 
production during the first tenure of the popular government. 
Work was going on with full speed on huge hydroelectric and 
thermal power projects to meet the increasing demand. There 
were the big projects such as the Mangla and Tarbela power 
plants and the Guddu thermal power station. This doubled 
electric production within the short period of five years. 
Attention from these developmental activities was diverted when 
Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's elected democratic 
government was toppled. Work on oil and gas exploration came to 
a standstill. No new hydroelectric power projects were started. 
The result was that the country faced an acute power shortage 
after 1982 and the whole country kept sinking in the darkness. 
  When we assumed office the last time in 1988, we 
wholeheartedly tried to deal with this situation. We designated 
billions of rupees in the budget for the power sector and 
started a number of new projects. We concluded agreements with 
France and the PRC to set up nuclear power plants. We tried to 
mobilize resources for power and oil and gas production with the 
cooperation of the private sector, and in December 1989 we 
concluded an initial agreement on the Hab project. The popular 
government was relieved of office by a conspiracy in August 
1990. The agreement with France on the nuclear power plant also 
ended as soon as the new government took over and no progress 
could be made on the Hub project. Projects were started based 
on the wrong priorities. The delay of only three years in 
executing these projects has caused a loss of 35 billion rupees 
to the national exchequer. 
  Wrong priorities resulted in great deterioration of the 
energy situation. Immediately after coming to power, I decided 
to set up a task force on energy to deal with the situation. In 
addition, I have taken some more important rapid steps without 
waiting for the recommendations of the task force. They include 
the decision to launch the Ghazi-Barotha hydroelectric power 
project costing more than 70 billion rupees and the Hab project 
in the private sector at a cost of more than 50 billion rupees. 
The swift government action in making decisions can be 
understood from the fact that the heads of delegations from 45 
international banks, which provide financial assistance to the 
Hab project, said that the progress achieved within two weeks is 
greater than that of the past three years. 
  Now, the task force on energy has submitted its 
recommendations for a new energy policy and the federal cabinet 
has approved them. This is the first time in the history of 
Pakistan that the government has formulated an integrated 
policy. Under this policy, there will be balance in the 
development of the oil, gas, coal, and hydroelectric sectors. 
Over the next five years, more than 700 billion rupees will be 
needed for power generation and oil and gas exploration. The 
government can invest 330 billion rupees of this, but we will 
have to find the remainder through private sector investment. 
In order to create interest in power generation and oil and gas 
exploration within the private sector, we are announcing some 
major incentives. 
  The government has decided to purchase electricity from 
private investors at the rate of 6.5 cents per kilowatt. This 
price is the most attractive in the entire region, which will 
provide a great incentive to the private sector in power 
generation. Investors who complete power plants within three 
years will receive a special premium. This concession is to 
encourage private investors to complete power plants as soon as 
possible. Power projects have been totally exempted from 
surcharges on education and flood relief. The import license 
fee has also been completely waived. Until now, the private 
sector was hesitant to invest in power generation projects as 
they took a considerable amount of time to enter into various 
agreements with the government. Your government has 
standardized all these conditions. Now private investors will 
have no difficulty in signing agreements with the government. 
In a like manner, these incentives will certainly draw the 
attention of foreign investors. 
  The situation now is that without taking revolutionary and 
drastic steps, it is impossible to overcome power outages. This 
crisis cannot be overcome simply by starting up new power 
projects. In addition to this, we should also strictly control 
waste, theft, and the nonproductive of electricity. We will 
launch a major program of demand regulation [preceding two words 
in English]. Under this program, the waste of electricity will 
be reduced. The pilferers will be identified through computers 
and legislation will be enacted under which they will be liable 
for imprisonment up to five years and heavy penalties. 
  A five-year plan has been prepared for this purpose. Under 
this plan, consumers will be provided with a new kind of meter. 
The consumers will be encouraged to use fluorescent lights 
rather than incandescent bulbs. It will not only greatly reduce 
electricity bills for consumers, but also immensely reduce the 
load on the WAPDA systems. In order to reduce the demand for 
electricity in the evenings, a new scheme has been prepared. 
Under this scheme, the electricity tariff will be calculated 
according to the amount of time a consumer uses electricity. A 
process of providing off-peak [preceding word in English] power 
to tube wells will begin. All these measures will reduce 
government expenditure on electricity generation by 11.5 billion 
rupees annually. At the same time, the difference in the demand 
and supply of electricity will be reduced to a point where 
load-shedding will be nominal, God willing, in three years. 
  Likewise, in order to slow the excessive consumption of oil 
in the transportation sector, some steps of fundamental 
importance also have been proposed. Currently, oil imports are 
45 billion rupees annually and the bill increases by 10 percent 
every year. More than half of this fuel is used in 
transportation. During the past few years, emphasis was placed 
on importing new and old motor vehicles instead of trains, large 
buses, and mass transit facilities which caused an unrestrained 
increase in the consumption of oil, besides creating serious 
traffic and pollution problems. We have, therefore, decided to 
develop such means of transportation, especially in major 
cities, which will reduce the level of pollution and traffic 
congestion on streets and also slow the undue consumption of 
oil. About 90,000 new engineers, technicians, and skilled 
workers will be required to translate all these programs into 
action, which will in turn create new avenues of employment. 
Some long-term policies have also been prepared for the 
development of the energy sector, which include construction of 
hydroelectric and coal-operated power plants, local manufacture 
of generators and transmission equipment, and accessories. 
  Dear brothers and sisters, the people's government has come 
into power by virtue of your votes and blessings. We have to 
fulfill your dreams and aspirations. When there is no light in 
a poor man's house, when factories are closed due to the lack of 
electricity and gas, the movement of the glittering yellow taxis 
on the six-lane highways cannot be described as the sign of 
development. The days of amusing the nation with games and 
pageantries are over. Now is the time for hard work and wise 
decisions. We must not waste this opportunity, otherwise, in 
the words of the poet Iqbal, may God forbid, our story will fail 
to be recorded in the annals of history. Let us make 
whole-hearted and sincere efforts for the success of the new 
energy policy, so that our dreams of development and progress 
within five to seven years are fulfilled with Pakistan entering 
the 21st century as a strong country and our hard-working people 
sharing equally the fruits of development, God willing. Long 
Live Pakistan.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has 
expressed the confidence that the people of Kashmir will get 
their inalienable right of self-determination under the 
leadership of the Pakistan People's Party [PPP]. She was 
responding to the speech made by the leader of the opposition, 
Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, in the National Assembly this 
afternoon during the debate on the current political situation 
in the country with a particular reference to the situation 
prevailing in NWFP [North-West Frontier Province]. The leader of 
the opposition in his speech had criticized the prime minister 
on her interview with the BBC. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said she 
stood by her interview as Pakistan did not interfere in the 
internal affairs of India nor do we intend to interfere in 
future. Kashmir she emphasized is not an integral part of 
India. It is a disputed territory recognized by the UN and even 
by the former Indian prime minister, late Jawaharlal Nehru. The 
prime minister declared that Pakistan under the leadership of 
PPP has put India on the defensive and on the run. The Indian 
leadership is so desperate that it has indulged in attacking the 
person of the prime minister of Pakistan. It is a tragedy that 
when the Indian president and their leadership have launched a 
slanderous campaign against her setting aside all diplomatic 
norms, the opposition joined hands with the Indian Government 
against the prime minister of Pakistan. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said 
she is not deterred by such attacks and tactics as she has never 
committed any laxity in discharging duties while serving the 
motherland. The PPP government, she said, is steering the 
country out of the international isolation and enhanced 
Pakistan's prestige in the comity of nations. Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto said India is now embarrassed and worried due to 
Pakistan's effective strategy on Kashmir while the situation was 
quite different during Mr. Nawaz Sharif's tenure. 
  Referring to the allegations leveled by the leader of the 
opposition that the PPP has abducted the MPA's [members of 
provincial assembly] of NWFP assembly, she said the leader of 
the opposition is painting a wrong picture in this regard. She 
challenged the opposition to present a solid proof in favor of 
their claim about the abduction of MPA's like we had provided 
evidence of the kidnapping of the PPP MPA's [by Sharif's party] 
at the time of Senate election during the previous regime. She 
said nobody in the immediate families of the MPA's of NWFP 
assembly has claimed that their relatives have been abducted by 
the government. This is an ample proof that the claim of the 
opposition is false and baseless. 
  Participating in the debate, the leader of the opposition, 
Mr. Nawaz Sharif, said the government should have provided a 
leadership for strengthening political culture in the country. 
But he alleged the government is creating political crisis. He 
said the government should have taken initiative both in and out 
of the house in curbing the horse trading. Mr. Nawaz Sharif 
said the opposition has the right to move a no-confidence motion 
against the government, but horse trading and keeping MPA's 
hostage is contrary to the Constitution. 
  Earlier, the law and justice minister, Syed Iqbal Haider, 
moved a motion for debate on the current political situation in 
the country, with particular reference to situation in NWFP. 
Initiating the debate, Syed Iqbal Haider said the government 
has voluntarily agreed to hold discussion on the NWFP situation 
because it wants to discuss everything in the house. However, 
the minister criciticized the requisitioning of the session by 
the opposition. He said it has been done to sabotage the 
government endeavor to mobilize the world opinion on Kashmir.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has sent a 
letter to the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton. The letter 
relates to the efforts being made by Pakistan to prevent human 
rights violations in the occupied Kashmir by presenting a 
resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission meeting being held 
in Geneva. This was stated by Pakistani Foreign Secretary 
Shaharyar Khan in Washington yesterday evening. He said that he 
has personally delivered the letter to senior State Department 
officials. Shaharyar Khan said that he also held talks on 
matters of mutual interest to Pakistan and the United States 
during his meetings with U.S. officials. 
  Answering a question, the foreign secretary said that it has 
been unanimously decided in Islamabad to present a resolution on 
human rights violations in Kashmir during the current session of 
the commission. He said that the situation this time is 
different from the time when Pakistan, on the suggestion of some 
friends and Islamic countries, had agreed to defer a similar 
resolution. They wanted to allow an opportunity for talks so as 
to peacefully resolve the dispute. He said that the situation 
in the Indian-occupied Kashmir remains unchanged and there has 
been no respite in Indian oppressive activities. The foreign 
secretary expressed dissatisfaction over the outcome of the 
recent Pakistan-India talks. He said that contrary to what 
Pakistan expected, Indian atrocities in Kashmir recently 
increased, which clearly indicates how sincere India is about 
holding talks with Pakistan. 
  In reply to another question, Shaharyar Khan said that it 
has 
always been Pakistan's conviction that the Kashmir issue should 
be resolved in accordance with the aspirations of the people of 
Jammu and Kashmir. The foreign secretary has now gone to Bonn 
on the next leg of his trip to secure support for the Pakistani 
stand on Kashmir.

  [Text] The government has decided to extend the ban on the 
militant outfit, JKLF [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front], for 
another two years. The step has been taken under the Unlawful 
Activities Prevention Act. The JKLF was declared an unlawful 
organization by a notification of the Home Ministry two years 
ago. 
  In the Kashmir Valley, four hard-core militants belonging to 
an outlawed outfit were killed in an encounter with the Army 
near Tangmarg in Baramula District yesterday. A spokesman of 
the Defense Ministry said in Srinagar that one Army jawan 
[soldier] was also killed in the encounter.

  [Text] New DelhI, Feb. 11 -- The `life-line' of air 
defence is Pechora missile and the No. 7 Base Repair Depot at 
Tuglaqabad keeps the missile system at optimal operational 
capability by carrying out regular maintenance, according to Air 
Commodore P.K. Ghosh, Air Officer Commanding, Tughlaqabad Air 
Force base. 
  Explaining the working of the base to a group of journalists 
who were taken round the depot here today, he said, "In the 
present geopolitical scenario missiles are of paramount 
importance". 
  The one-ton, six-metre long Pechora missile which is the 
most 
sophisticated is completely stripped to its individual parts 
along with the launcher and the missile guidance radar (MGR) as 
also the instruments in its control cabin. 
  About 750 personnel of the 1,200 at the base work on the 
different parts which are divided into as many as 300 
sub-assemblies each having thousands of parts. 
  The guided missile can look onto the enemy aircraft and 
going 
at the speed of Mach-4 (four times the speed of sound) around 
13200 metre per second destroys enemy aircraft within 11 to 17 
kilometre. 
  The life of the missile is 49 second and if it does not hit 
the target within that time it goes straight up and destroys 
itself. 
  The launchers are so synchronised that the radar and the 
missile simultaneously point towards the direction of the enemy 
aircraft. 
  As the target (hostile aircraft) is tracked by the MGR, the 
missile is automatically pointed towards the target. The entire 
operations being controlled from the control cabin of MGR where 
one can spot the hostile aircraft as a 'blip' as soon as it 
comes within the range of the radar. After tracking the 
aircraft the missiles electronically home on to the target. 
  The missile's range is 25 kilometre but generally the hit is 
made at a distance of 11 to 17 kilometre. 
  Once the missile homes on to the target then a kind of 
electronic relationship is established between the missile and 
the target and the movement of the missile continues to be 
guided by that of the aircraft automatically by a command 
guidance system. So the question of the enemy aircraft 
manoeuvring and escaping does not arise, as the missile remains 
continuously latched on to it. 
  The decision to launch the missile is taken by the alert IAF 
[Indian Air Force] officers depending on the combat 
considerations and the 'launch' button is pressed when the 
aircraft is well within the kill zone. 
  At a time when the radio signals being received from the 
aircraft by the missile become very high crossing a 
pre-determined threshold (showing the missile is close to the 
target) the missile automatically explodes its warhead which 
consists of metal pieces. 
  The explosion which is caused about 300 metre away from the 
aircraft forms a kind of spherical cloudburst of metalic pieces 
which the aircraft cannot avoid and goes straight into it. 
Being hit by the shrapnels at supersonic speeds the aircraft is 
usually destroyed or severely damaged. 
  The kill probability of hostile aircraft is of the order of 
100 per cent. 
  The MGR has been provided with necessary anti-jamming 
protection to effectively function even when jammed. 
  Two generators supply the power to the missile system so 
that 
if one fails the system can function without disruption. 
  The radar also has a television camera which can visually 
track the aircraft even at distance of 25 kilometre and supply 
visual data on a television screen inside the MGR so that if for 
some reason the radars don't give the signals automatically then 
manually trackers can track the aircraft with the visual input 
and fire the missile. 
  First and second line maintenance is carried out by the 
Squadron in the field and the third and fourth line repair 
(medium repair) as well as defect repairs beyond the squadrons 
capabilities are carried out here. 
  On induction equipment is stripped, examined by specialist 
tradesmen at the production wings under close supervision of 
specialist officers and quality assurance inspectors to access 
the quantum of deterioration and the quantum of work spares 
required to carry out the medium repair as per schedule of 
repair technology prepared by the manufacturers. The logistics 
support wing caters for the timely provisions of the 
spares/materials to undertake repairs by production shops. 
  The components of stripped down equipment pass through a 
series of medium repair operation, which include cleaning, 
washing, painting, cabin repairs, repair of electrical and 
electronic components, replacement of mandatory items and 
defective components, assembly of panel and checks against 
standard equipment (Stand Tuning), assembly of main equipment, 
functional test for serviceability, and endurance test for 
reliability of the equipment. 
  On completion of all the operations, all self-systems of the 
Pechora Missile System is connected together and comprehensive 
test of the system as a whole is carried out. On successful 
completion of this comprehensive test, Directorate of Air Staff 
Inspection carry out a thorough functional check of the complete 
Missile System as it would be deployed and used in a Squadron 
and it declares it fit to operational use. 
  As the missile is of Soviet origin, efforts are also being 
made to procure spares of Indian origin.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Still Not Even-handed"] </F>
  [Text] The Clinton administration's decision not to go 
ahead with its proposal to repeal the Pressler Amendment is a 
serious setback to Pakistan. The move was prompted by a shift 
in the American policy towards South Asia and as a gesture to 
Benazir Bhutto's fledgling government. But what did Washington 
expect in return? Did it have any reason to think, for instance, 
that by resuming economic and military assistance barred by 
Pressler, the US would succeed in persuading Pakistan either to 
desist from fuelling terrorism in Kashmir or to roll back its 
nuclear-weapons programme? It is, in the final analysis, the 
administration's failure to give a reassuring reply to this 
crucial question at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Affairs 
Sub-committee on South Asia that has led to the retention of the 
Pressler Amendment. Senator after Senator assailed the move to 
delete the Amendment from the Foreign Assistance Act as an 
instance of the Clinton administration's inept policy towards 
South Asia. None was taken in by State Department officials' 
apparently innocent plea that the idea was simply to remove a 
provision which was country-specific -- that is in relation to 
assistance to Pakistan. The proffered official explanation was 
that deletion of such a provision would make for greater 
flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy. This did not wash 
because the Senators maintained that removal of Pressler would 
be a contradiction of the government's professed 
non-proliferation goal in South Asia. 
  While New Delhi is naturally relieved to find that the 
Congressional vigilance has helped scuttle a mischievous 
anti-Indian twist to US policy, there is no room for 
complacency. The heavily-funded Pakistani lobbies in Washington 
must be expected to continue their efforts with redoubled vigour 
to play mischief. It is still a long way to go and complex 
procedures to be completed before a final foreign assistance act 
emerges: These lobbies are unlikely to be disheartened by the 
outcome of the deliberations in the Senate Sub- committee 
because key aides in the White House have been found to be 
vulnerable to their machinations. The more important reason for 
India to be ever watchful is the new evidence that the so-called 
even-handed approach of the US in South Asia remains in fact 
heavily tilted in favour of Pakistan. 
  In the past the US gave overriding importance to effective 
conduct of an anti-Soviet strategy in which Pakistan was a key 
element. It is no secret that Washington in return turned a 
Nelson's eye to Islamabad's nuclear weapons programme. But even 
in the absence of cold war compulsions, the US has not ceased 
going out of its way to placate Pakistan on one specious plea or 
the other, especially on the Kashmir issue. Whether the policy 
is marked by doublethink or confusion, the resulting threat to 
India's interests is obvious.

<F P=106> [By M.K. Dhar] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 13 -- Russia has assured India that 
the emergence of ultra-nationalist forces in its newly elected 
Parliament will not affect the India factor in its foreign 
policy. 
  It has also sought an early visit by Prime Minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao to Moscow to review implementation of the 
agreements signed during President Boris Yeltsin's New Delhi 
visit last year and to discuss more areas of cooperation. 
  As a result of the exchange of communications between 
President Yeltsin and Mr Rao and other exchanges through 
diplomatic channels, it is likely that the Prime Minister will 
visit Moscow in June for extensive talks on international issues 
and bilateral matters. The Indian factor in Russia's Asian 
policy plays an important role and Moscow is now getting more 
conscious of the importance of strengthening stability and 
security in South Asia and the Asia- Pacific region as a whole 
in view of the growing fundamentalist and ethnic pressures on 
the Central Asian republics and the need for friendly and 
peaceful neighbours. 
  Moscow has assured New Delhi that the bottlenecks to trade 
and supply of defence equipment and spares have now been removed 
and economic interaction between the two countries will 
increase. The backlog of supplies of equipment and spares for 
the Indian Air Force will be cleared in the next few weeks, as 
more Russian ships will dock in Indian ports. As regards the 
Navy and the Army, supplies will be speeded up after the visits 
of Russian Naval Chief Admiral Felix Nikolacvich here next week 
and of Indian Army Chief Gen. B.C. Joshi to Moscow later this 
month. 
  India has been informed that President Yeltsin has 
constituted a special department to expedite arms exports. 
Earlier, Indian defence teams were expected to negotiate 
directly with the enterprises spread all over the Commonwealth 
of Independent States, which was a frustrating experience. 
After receiving frantic Indian requests, the Russian Defence 
Ministry shipped to India small consignments of spares from the 
inventory of its own armed forces until firm arrangements for 
supply were made. But considering that nearly 60 per cent of 
the arsenal of the Indian defence forces is of Soviet origin, 
the supplies were extremely inadequate. 
  However, there is little progress on the cryogenic rocket 
engine front since the agreement between ISRO [Indian Space 
Research Organization] and Glavcosmos was annulled by Moscow 
under US pressure. Up to the time of cancellation of the pact, 
some technology transfer had taken place, but it had not reached 
the stage of handing over design, drawings and actual components 
of the engine, as well as fuel. The Russians are now willing to 
honour the financial component of the deal by supplying more 
finished engines than envisaged in the contract, but the Indian 
side is still undecided. 
  However, other agreements regarding exchange of scientists 
and technicians under the umbrella of the science and technology 
cooperation are being implemented as per schedule. Recently, an 
agreement was signed between the National Aerospace Laboratories 
(NAL) and Myasischev Design Bureau (MDB) for joint design and 
production of a nine to 14 seater light transport aircraft 
(LTA). The project is worth Rs [rupees] 80 crore (with MDB 
investing Rs 40 crore) and the first prototype is expected to be 
ready by 1995-96. 
  Indo-Russian trade, too, is showing signs of revival after a 
massive disruption following disintegration of the former Soviet 
Union, though actually a large component of Indian exports are 
accounted for by debt repayments. Indian imports from Russia in 
the first half of last year rose by 25 per cent, mainly on 
account of deliveries of newsprint and non-ferrous metals. 
Since a proper administrative machinery for recoveries and 
settlement of debt did not exist in Russia, several lobbies came 
into operation. The Finance Ministry, which is supposed to 
affect recoveries, is one such lobby, with the Ministries of 
Foreign Economic Affairs and Industry-cum-Trade the others. Of 
the Rs 1,300 crore available to Russia last year as instalment 
of debt repayment, Moscow has been able to order imports worth 
Rs 700 crore only because of disagreement among Ministers on the 
list of commodities to be imported. The Russian Prime Minister, 
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin is supposed to draw up an indicative list 
of items to be imported from India.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Playing With Pressler"] </F>
  [Text] That the Clinton administration has decided to 
retain the nuclear sanctions against Pakistan as envisaged under 
the Pressler amendment, at least for the time being, would, 
without doubt, prompt questions about the U.S. policy. 
Indications that the Clinton administration was increasingly in 
favour of repealing the amendment on grounds that it no longer 
advances U.S. non- proliferation goals put a strain on Indo-U.S. 
relations. The more so in view of the puzzling shifts in U.S. 
postures that seem to alternately confirm and deny a definite 
pro-Pakistani tilt. Such an Indian feeling was reinforced by 
the vigorous diplomatic exercise launched by Pakistan to 
convince Washington of the need to exclude Islamabad from the 
Pressler law on grounds that it was one-sided and that it 
damages Pakistan's conventional military capability, or in other 
words, gives India a strategic edge. 
  With many in the administration buying such an argument, 
Delhi had compelling reasons to see the move to have the 
Pressler amendment repealed as yet another anti-India stratagem 
of the Clinton administration. The latest decision to retain 
the amendment must surely have come as a severe jolt to Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto's government, though she must have received other 
placatory assurances from the U.S.. And while Delhi has reason 
to be pleased with the decision, it would be imprudent on its 
part to take the decision as final. 
  The move, in any case, is not inspired by a new-found 
enlightenment in the Clinton administration about the merits of 
following a more even-handed approach towards the subcontinent. 
Rather, as admitted by the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for 
International Development, Mr. Brian Atwood, the move is purely 
tactical, with a view not to rub Congressmen the wrong way. 
Besides, in the interim before the current legislation on 
foreign aid presented to the U.S. Congress becomes law, the 
Clinton administration is likely to continue its search for a 
two-way deal on the nuclear issue whereby in return for some 
nuclear concessions from Pakistan, the Congress can be goaded to 
lift an amendment the administration wants repealed. Above all, 
our relief over the retention of the amendment should be 
tempered with the fact that Pakistan already has a nuclear 
weapons programme in place. Nevertheless, the decision to retain 
the amendment signals that nuclear non-proliferation remains a 
major aim of U.S. policy, however, it is pursued. U.S. 
relations with Pakistan are complicated by what Washington wants 
to impose on India -- by making use of Pakistan as the lever of 
American pressure on this country.

<F P=106> [By Kamlendra Kanwar] </F>
  [Text] Bombay -- Former Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] 
chairman Homi N Sethna has described a "absolute hogwash" recent 
reports that Pakistan has acquired nuclear weapon capability and 
that the Indian sub-continent was "a screwdriver's turn" away 
from a nuclear holocaust twice in the last seven years. 
  In an interview with INDIAN EXPRESS Sethna who was AEC chief 
from 1972 to 1983 during which time the country exploded an 
experimental nuclear device at Pokhran in Rajasthan said 
contrary to Pakistan's claims, it had not been able to achieve 
more than 60 per cent uranium enrichment with the centrefuge 
technology that it had acquired. 
  The enrichment required for gas to be converted into 
bombgrade heavy metal was at least 90 per cent, he pointed out. 
  Besides, it had never seriously taken the plutonium path 
whereas India had started reprocessing plutonium way back in 
1967-68. 
  Sethna said the Americans were given to exaggeration and it 
suited Pakistan to be seen as a burgeoning nuclear power in the 
region for domestic political reasons. 
  While contending that India was way ahead of Pakistan in the 
nuclear field he denied that it ever had aggressive intentions. 
Reacting to the reported claim by an American journalist William 
E. Burrows in his book Critical Mass that Indira Gandhi had made 
elaborate plans to bomb Pakistan's Kahuta enrichment plant 
before she was assassinated in 1984 he said this was a blatant 
lie. 
  Being in a vantage position in the AEC and the Government 
there was no way such a plan could have escaped his attention, 
he added. 
  Asked how he felt now about the 1974 Pokhran blast as he 
looked back, Sethna said he was confused as to what purpose was 
served in exploding a device and then not following it up. "We 
should have gone flat out, acquired the status of a nuclear 
power and bargained for a place in the Security Council," he 
said with authority. 
  Reacting to a question on how secure Bombay's nuclear 
installations were from enemy air attacks, Sethna said the Cyrus 
and Dhruva reactors as also the plutonium reprocessing 
facilities were well protected. However, the radio metallurgy 
and radio chemistry labs in the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre 
were vulnerable. 
  Queried about the possibility of a nuclear arms race in Asia 
in the wake of North Korea's acquisition of nuclear capability 
he said American attempts to bring the North Koreans to heal 
were in order. 
  However, reports about US plans to supply Scud missiles to 
South Korea were disturbing. 
  The Scuds were proved ineffective during the Gulf War and 
any 
effort to arm South Korea with them would fuel suspicions that 
the US is pandering to its strong arms suppliers lobby.

  [Text] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has emphasized that 
the problem with Israel is a political not a security one as 
Israel claims. 
  He said: They ask us to halt the resistance so that the 
Israeli army may live on our land, which is foolishness. Our 
land is occupied and the resistance was not the cause of 
occupation but rather a result. 
  He indicated that the army can ensure security in the south 
and if Israel withdraws, the army can carry out security duties 
efficiently. 
  On preparations to face any aggression, he said: We want to 
keep the people steadfast. The resistance will not be touched 
and the army is mobilized and completely ready to play its role 
as it did in the Seven-Day War. These are the capabilities that 
we will use and that we are not willing to surrender. We have 
taken all precautions within our reach and will not give in. He 
added: We are not willing to be defeated peacefully at the 
negotiating table because we were not defeated militarily in the 
war with Israel. Israel should make a decision on a 
comprehensive, just peace and on the exchange of land for peace, 
because occupation and peace cannot be combined.

  [Text] Tension prevails in various areas in the south as a 
result of continued Israeli threats and attacks. The occupation 
forces this morning shelled Majdal Silm from their positions in 
Tallusah. Meanwhile, medium-caliber weapons fired on Wadi 
al-Hujayr and Wadi al-Saluqi. 
  Israeli gunboats have carried out patrols inside Lebanese 
territorial waters between Sidon and al-Naqurah. 
  At 0800 today, a border strip militia patrol strafed the 
areas of al-Hasbani, Zummarayya crossing, the Mimis crossroads, 
and the al-Dahr hills with various types of automatic weapons 
for 90 minutes. A number of mortar rounds were also fired. 
  The Israeli forces shelled the Birkat al-Jabbur area in 
western al-Biqa' from their positions in the Abu-Qamhah area. 
The border militia radio [Voice of the South] said that a 
resistance group was spotted trying to infiltrate into the 
occupied area through Birkat al-Jabbur. Artillery fired at the 
group with unknown results and a helicopter flew over the area 
shortly afterward. 
  The agent militia also raked the buffer area along the 
western al-Biqa' front using medium and light automatic weapons 
and rockets, raising apprehension and anticipation.

  [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi discussed the situation in 
the south and the U.S. positions with U.S. Ambassador Mark 
Hambley in a meeting at noon today. The ambassador was 
accompanied by a delegation of senior European officers. 
  Hambley publicly incited against resistance and said: We had 
the opportunity today to meet President al-Hirawi along with a 
special military delegation of European officers whose task is 
military training. I think the United States strongly believes 
that it is very important for Lebanon to have a strong army able 
to control all Lebanese territory. He added: President 
al-Hirawi is very concerned about developing the Army's military 
capability. Our contacts fall within this context and General 
(Porman) is with us. 
  Commenting on the south, Hambley said: This issue is on our 
minds. It is important that we should not let these groups 
hamper the peace process by continuing attacks, especially those 
that inflame things in the south. We are now trying to 
concentrate actively on the peace talks in Washington and hope 
to work together to avert any complications. 
  On his contacts yesterday with Prime Minister al-Hariri on a 
request from Secretary Christopher, Hambley said: Undoubtedly, 
our governments had intense contacts last night. We will 
continue these contacts. I do not wish to elaborate on these 
talks but our governments are trying to follow up the situation 
and make new moves through the Washington talks. 
  Asked if the request to halt resistance in the south is now 
a 
United States' demand, rather than an Israeli one, he replied: 
This was a misconception of the U.S. message. I stress the 
call to halt violence and the need to pursue the talks, because 
they are the only solution. 
  The U.S. ambassador and the European officers delegation met 
Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul. 
  President al-Hirawi earlier received Army Commander General 
Emile Lahhud, who briefed him on reports coming into 
headquarters from the south. They also discussed issues 
concerning the military institution.

  [Text] The overall situation in Lebanon was the subject of 
Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri's talks with Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad yesterday. The NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY reports that 
President al-Asad met with Prime Minister al-Hariri for three 
hours and discussed with him the current local and regional 
developments and the situation in the south in the wake of the 
recent Israeli attacks, and the Arab-Israeli negotiations. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri also met twice with Syrian Vice 
President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam. He returned to Beirut around 
2200 yesterday. 
  Al-Hariri sources described the results of his talks in 
Damascus as good, and said that his talks dealt with the 
situation in the south, the stages covered in the bilateral 
peace negotiations, and the Lebanese situation in general. 
  The results of the Damascus talks will be the subject of 
consultations today among President al-Hirawi, Prime Minister 
al-Hariri, and Speaker Nabih Birri.

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri affirmed 
last night that the resistance is Lebanon's peace card. He 
noted that Lebanon is facing an attempt to undermine it 
economically and cut it down to size geographically. He said 
that ending the resistance would be a surrender to Israel. 
Speaking at a Ramadan dinner banquet held by al-Mabarrat 
Charitable Society, Birri warned that ending the Arab boycott of 
Israel without the implementation of UN Security Council 
Resolution 425 would be a stab in the back for Lebanon's 
steadfastness and sacrifices.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-SHIRA' in Arabic in its issue 
of 14 February carries on pages 3-5 an approximately 3,000-word 
article by Chief Editor Hasan Sabra, entitled "A Compound Crime 
in Ba'labakk--the Assassination of a Family and a State", 
commenting on a recent incident in al-Biqa' where local clansmen 
took the law into their hands and put to death a youth of 16 who 
had killed three people -- a mother and her two children -- in 
the course of an armed burglary. After analyzing the factors 
leading to the current economic hardships in that area, the 
slowness of the judicial process, and the enfeebled sense of 
national identity, the writer discusses Hizballah's plans to 
replace or nullify the state in various Lebanese areas. He 
remarks that Ba'labakk's double crime "did not come from a 
vacuum." 
  Sabra points out that when the narcotic crops in al-Biqa', a 
former mainstay of that area's economy, particularly in northern 
al-Biqa', were eliminated in line with new "regional 
circumstances and U.S. conditions," no lawful alternative to 
making a living was offered, thus encouraging theft. 
  He then discusses some people's weak affiliation to the 
homeland and their inclination to accept tribal justice. He 
says this is encouraged by the condition of the Lebanese courts, 
which are plagued by delays and interventions by politicians. 
The result, he says, is that people despair of getting justice 
from the courts. He notes that "thousands of cases have piled 
up in the Lebanese courts, some never get to court, some remain 
in the investigators' hands, and some are buried under the 
debate among lawyers and judges." 
  He calls for improving judges' living conditions and urges 
politicians to keep their hands off the judiciary, declaring: 
"We place the chief responsibility for the judicial crisis in 
our country on the shoulders of the majority of politicians, 
their wishes, greed, circumvention of the law, their pressure on 
judges, and their alternate threats and bribes to them." 
  On the significance of the Ba'labakk incident, he says: 
  "While we denounce the rejection of society's laws, weak 
sense of national belonging, and recourse to tribal law, we also 
share the feeling of those who believe in one homeland that 
there is a party that does not want the state to exist and 
indeed believes that the state's very existence is at the 
expense of its own. 
  "Who does not know Hizballah's plans to abolish the state in 
Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil, Beirut's southern suburb, and every other 
place where it can forfeit the state's institutions, flout its 
laws, and reject society's norms, using pretexts to resort to 
armed force, sometimes trying to bribe and at others making 
threats? It always has ready rulings [fatwas] to twist the arm 
of religion, distort it, and use it to intimidate the public. 
  "The state is absent in Ba'labakk-al-Hirmil just as it is 
absent in the southern suburb and Jabal 'Amil. 
  "In Ba'labakk, Hizballah nullifies the courts, in the 
southern suburb it nullifies public services, and in the south 
it nullifies the state's sovereignty. In all these cases it 
tries to impose its laws at the public's, society's, and the 
homeland's expense. 
  "An opportunity offered itself in Ba'labakk to implement 
Hizballah's Islamic republic slogan, in practice not in theory. 
It was offered on a blood-soaked pillow. Hizballah did not let 
the opportunity slip. The party that prevents the building of a 
general hospital in the Southern Suburb and opposes new roads, 
electricity supplies, and telephone services to the people will 
have no scruples about exploiting the murder of a whole family. 
  "And now what? 
  "What happened in Ba'labakk is a compound crime in which a 
family was murdered and a state was assassinated. State 
officials and the public must respond to this assassination. 
They must go by the book and use the state's prestige. The 
crucial component of prestige is justice and the retrieval of 
outlaws... by the law."

<F P=106> [Report by Walid Abi-Murshid: "Iran Demands Lebanese </F>
Companies Employ Its `Sympathizers'"] 
  [Text] London -- A well informed Lebanese source has 
revealed that a group of establishments and companies operating 
in Lebanon recently received specific requests from Tehran that 
a number of its political "sympathizers" be employed in their 
administrative or technical departments. 
  The Lebanese source said that Iran offered to provide a 
number of establishments having commercial dealings with it with 
official cover when necessary for employing the elements in 
their departments, for example, by providing official 
notification confirming they are representatives of known 
Iranian establishments. 
  The Lebanese source noted that what he terms Iranian trade 
infiltration in Lebanon comes in the wake of increasing reports 
about the possibility that Hizballah will dissolve its military 
wing in the event that the Israeli forces withdraw from southern 
Lebanon within the framework of a comprehensive peace process in 
the region, and the possibility of withdrawing "Revolutionary 
Guard" elements from al-Biqa'. 
  It is worth mentioning that a leading Lebanese Hizballah 
source announced in Beirut yesterday that the party has drawn up 
a plan to confront what the source termed "consequences of 
peace" with Israel if it is achieved. The source said that even 
if its military is dissolved, Hizballah will retain its social 
and security organs and will fight any attempt to "normalize" 
relations with Israel. 
  A Lebanese ministerial source stresses that the Israeli 
forces' withdrawal from southern Lebanon would not be the end of 
Hizballah's role on the Lebanese scene, but, rather, the 
beginning of a new political role whose foundation is the 
mobilization of popular opposition against attempts to normalize 
unofficial relations with Israel. 
  The source adds that Hizballah would lead the tendency 
calling for turning the Lebanese-Israeli peace -- if established 
-- into a cold peace along the lines of the Egyptian-Israeli 
peace.

  [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- A ministerial source has stated 
that the cabinet's agreement in principle to sell the Lebanese 
Army's Mirage aircraft will not take effect even if the 
purchasing party makes an offer complying with the government's 
terms, because Lebanon needs to get the approval of the state or 
company which manufactured the aircraft before selling them. 
  The ministerial source told AL-HAYAH that arms contracts 
concluded between two states or between a state and the 
manufacturing company usually stipulate that the country which 
purchases or uses the aircraft has no right to dispose of them 
without prior approval. 
  He said that the Lebanese Government will seek France's 
approval as soon as it receives an official offer from the 
Pakistani Government to purchase the Mirage planes. Lebanon 
will thus have complied with the terms of the contract signed 
between the two countries. There is no commitment in the 
contract as far as Dassault, the manufacturing company, is 
concerned. 
  Discussing numbers, the source said that the Lebanese Army's 
Air Force had received 12 Mirage aircraft since 1968, all made 
in 1967, and that although they were placed in active service, 
they were operated for only a limited number of hours. 
  He confirmed that the Army command now has 10 aircraft still 
parked at al-Qulay'at military airfield in 'Akkar (in the 
north), and that the other two were damaged before 1975, one 
having crashed during exercises in the early seventies at Riyaq 
airbase in al-Biqa' -- the pilot survived. 
  In conclusion, the source said that "although their 
manufacture dates back to 1967, the aircraft are as good as new 
and are in good condition because of their limited flying hours 
not exceeding 100. They need maintenance to become operational." 
  It is known that the Pakistani Air Force has some Mirage 
aircraft.

new market, and encouraging exports and permitting [exporters] 
to keep part of export revenue. The ministry also explained 
measures to combat smuggling and to effect a financial balance 
through increasing revenues and rationalizing expenditure, which 
would include a reconsideration of subsidies for some 
commodities and institutions. The ministry also explained the

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Palestine" program] </F>
  [Text] Arab and non-Arab observers wonder what is left for 
the PLO negotiator to the Taba talks to accept or reject. The 
fact of the matter is that it is Israel that decides and 
dictates agreements between the two parties. If the Palestinian 
negotiator ever defies what is being dictated on him, the matter 
is referred to Yasir 'Arafat, Yitzhaq Rabin, or Shim'on Peres. 
'Arafat will then announce his approval of the arrangements 
Israel wants. 
  Thus, political and media observers began to see, day in and 
day out, further concessions made by the PLO delegation. They 
have now reached the conclusion that Israel has taken 
everything. But, despite this, Israel is exercising further 
extortion just for the sake of it. 
  Israel stuck to its position over passages; settlements and 
the lands around them; main roads; control over the land, sea, 
and air border points; the right to enter the self-rule area to 
arrest wanted Palestinians; and all the other conditions of 
colonialism, hegemony, and tutelage. So what remains to be 
negotiated in Taba? This is the question being asked by 
political observers and world journalists. It is also the 
question which the Palestinian Arab masses are asking.

  [Text] Remember November 4, 1979? Iranian revolutionaries 
seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held some 100 spies 
hostage. Tons of documents, sophisticated spying equipment, the 
overall setup of the so-called embassy and statements by the 
`diplomats' confirmed to the people of Iran and the free world 
that the U.S. mission was grossly violating all norms of 
international law. 
  That was 14 years ago. The world's largest economic and 
military power then made an undeclared pledge to undermine the 
newly-born Islamic Republic of Iran to avenge the political 
humiliation. 
  And so a non-stop process began to destabilize the unique 
Islamic Revolution and its leadership. Aware of the fury and 
conspiracy in Washington and other allied capitals, the late 
Imam Khomeyni told the nation and other oppressed masses that 
"America can't do a damn." Time and again the father of the 
Islamic Revolution in Iran urged the deprived and downtrodden 
not to overestimate America's military, diplomatic and economic 
might -- now on the decline. 
  Now here we are. Islamic Iran is celebrating the 15th 
anniversary of the upheaval that brought down the region's most 
powerful monarchy. Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, America's 
staunchest ally was forced out of the country. His crime? 
Among all the evidence of injustice during the shah's rule and 
the lawlessness of his family members, the king's unquestionable 
subservience to Washington can be singled out as the stalk that 
broke the camel's back. 
  Save the direct bombing of Iranian cities by U.S. fighter 
planes, (the U.S. did shoot down one of our passenger planes in 
1988 killing all 300 civilians on board) the Carter, Reagan, 
Bush and Clinton White House did everything to first bring the 
Islamic state to its knees and then wipe out its name from the 
world's geographical map. For a decade and a half the U.S., 
closely followed by Britain, has spared no opportunity to 
sustain its Iran-bashing strategy. Engineering Saddam Husayn's 
full-fledged military invasion of Iran to sponsoring resolutions 
against "Tehran's human rights violations" at world forums are 
among the long-list of known plots of the great satan. 
  We absolutely do not want to convey that the 
Washington-London offensives failed at every turn. Our people 
know that these two hostile powers have on and off succeeded in 
making life difficult for the U.S. [as published] Depressing oil 
prices, difficulties in procuring technology for peaceful 
purposes, encouraging today's kings, sheikhs, 
presidents-for-life and military dictators to silence their 
peoples' calls for Islamic justice... are plots that temporarily 
disturb our lofty mission. 
  On hindsight we realize that from time immemorial everything 
has had a price. Today the stakes are much higher. Ours is 
basically a Muslim society that has unfathomable belief in 
justice of the kind practiced by our Imam 'Ali (A.S.) [as 
published]. Islamic Iran has, in the recent past, displayed 
some unprecedented levels of zeal, and resistance to arrogance 
and aggression. May be the U.S.-engineered war, sanctions, 
isolation and condemnation after the victory of the 1979 Islamic 
Revolution were a blessing in disguise. The majority of our 
people have learnt to endure and this is something what the 
loud-mouthed American and British leaders can't take away by a 
stroke of their hand. 
  We do not need to run away from the truth. Yes, our country 
has some problems. Which country doesn't? From the islands of 
Mindanao to the desert dwellings in Morocco nations are 
grappling with social, economic and political problems. And 
mind you, very few of these (governments) are on the U.S. black 
list. Iran is a thorn in the eyes of American leaders who fear 
the rise of Islam and its ramifications on Washington's 
illegitimate interests around the globe. 
  Contrary to what our western adversaries like to publicize, 
Islamic Iran has no identity crisis. As regarding our 
proclamations of peaceful coexistence, the international 
community once clearly, though reluctantly, endorsed this 
position (the U.N. admitted that Iraq started the war against 
Iran). Then again look at the Islamic Republic's normal and 
growing relations with all its neighbors. Fifteen years may be 
like 15 seconds in the history of a nation. Yet in this period 
we managed to come a long way and have little to fear. We have 
already accepted that the 21st century will be the century of 
Islam. With this in vision, we are minding our own business and 
expect the U.S. to do likewise.

  [Text] The Kazakh president has said that during his recent 
meeting with the U.S. President, Clinton asked him to distance 
himself from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Nursultan Nazarbayev 
told correspondents in New York yesterday: Unfortunately the 
U.S. Administration's attitude toward the Iranian Government is 
negative. But Kazakhstan oes not believe in isolating Iran, 
which enjoys special importance in northern and central Asian 
affairs. The Kazakh president pointed out that Almaty's 
relations with Tehran are extremely good and constructive and 
that despite all the bad propaganda by enemies, the two 
countries are expanding their relations. 
  Nazarbayev rejected allegations of a threat from Islamic 
fundamentalism in the Central Asian republics and stressed: We 
are all Muslims and respect Islamic beliefs. After having lived 
through the antireligious years in the former Soviet Union, the 
people in the Central Asian republics are extremely interested 
in returning to their religious beliefs. Nevertheless, he 
added, in Kazakhstan religion and politics are kept separate. 
  The Kazakh president described the Economic Cooperation 
Organization, ECO, as a good example of successful regional 
cooperation for the world. 
  Referring to the agreements between Washington and Almaty, 
he 
said that the two countries have concluded agreements in the 
political, economic, scientific, technological, and defense 
fields as well as in the joint use of Kazakhstan's space center, 
and that the United States has promised $300 million in aid to 
Kazakhstan.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] The spokesman for the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, IAEA, Hans Myers, said on Wednesday [16 February] that 
the Agency is not able to reject Iraq's likely potential for 
making nuclear weapons with any certainty. The spokesman said: 
Though the IAEA will exercise long term monitoring of the Iraqi 
nuclear installations, Iraq is a big country and it might have 
some center which have not been discovered so far. 
  In this connection a UN team is expected to begin a nine day 
visit to Iraq today in order to arrange a program for 
controlling Iraq's military industries and stop the production 
of long-range missiles. During its stay in Iraq, the UN team is 
also expected to select a suitable place for installing the 
surveillance cameras and other such equipment. 
  Despite the UN concern many political experts think it is 
quite difficult and inconceivable that Iraq can become nuclear 
now, or in the future, specially when its last recognized 
consignment of nuclear material was moved to Russia last 
February 12. This is beside the economic weakness and 
vulnerability that has afflicted Iraq following the Persian Gulf 
war. According to certain experts this very issue may, to a 
large extent, adversely affect Iraq's nuclear program. 
  At any rate a major part of the pressures being brought by 
the UN may be the result of the activities and influence of the 
Israeli lobby in the White House. In fact in the opinion of 
Zionists any Iraqi threats to the security of the Qods occupier 
regime are not to be ignored. On this basis many political 
observers consider Washington's pressures on the UN for 
controlling Iraq's military industries and also for continuing 
the existing economic sanctions against Baghdad to be related to 
this very issue. 
  These sanctions remain in place under the conditions when 
Iraq's ailing economy is going through difficult phases with a 
threat of famine and hunger, as well as grave health conditions 
of the vast majority of the Iraqis is looming large. This issue 
may focus the Iraqi people's attention on the Baghdad regime. 
Naturally this is not the objective desired by the White House 
ringleaders.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Are New Horizons Being Opened Up?"] </F>
  [Text] The Republic of Azerbaijan has requested Turkey to 
arrange for the military training of the Azeri army officers. 
  According to reports received from news agencies, Geydar 
Aliyev made that request at the end of his 4-day visit to Turkey. 
  Political circles in the region are not inclined to grant 
much weight to that statement by Geydar Aliyev who has a special 
reputation for being a very complex personality. Since he 
assumed power on June 30, Aliyev has been playing in various 
ways with the regional powers - with Moscow and Tehran and now 
with Ankara. Aliyev's courtship of Ankara started quite 
recently, for bilateral ties between Baku and Ankara had not 
been very warm after the downfall of Abulfaz Elchibey who 
depended greatly on the Turkish support. 
  Some of the well-informed political observers in the region 
evaluate Geydar Aliyev's recent statement only as a means of 
provoking the other regional countries specially Russia. 
  Surprisingly it seems that Russia has been pursing the 
affairs of the new independent states quite closely in spite of 
the chaotic social and economic situation in that country. 
  It is true of course that the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis still 
goes on, but it seems that the recent victories gained by the 
Azeris in battle fronts could serve to deflate somewhat the 
Armenian military pride and make them settle for more realistic 
peace talks. 
  The Armenians military victories of the previous months had 
encouraged them to adopt a very demanding position. At the same 
time the economic situation in Yerevan is reportedly much more 
chaotic then it is in Baku. 
  In the opinion of political observers, after the recent trip 
to Moscow by Morteza Banki, the director of the Central Asia 
Department of the Iranian Foreign Ministry and his negotiations 
with some of the Russian authorities, and the consequent 
expression of willingness on the part of Moscow to seek a 
political settlement for the crisis in the Caucasus in 
collaboration with Iran presents new hopeful prospects. 
  It has been clearly demonstrated in the course of the futile 
military encounters of the past few years that the Caucasian 
issue could not be resolved with the aid of powers that are at a 
geographical distance from the nucleus of the conflict. The 
crisis could only be resolved by the regional powers with the 
collaboration of the two warring countries. 
  There remains, however, one source of worry. In the process 
of action Russia had already blocked the efforts of the Minsk 
group to reach a political settlement. Is Russia going to 
perform that role again in connection with the new peace 
initiative that is being undertaken by Iran, Turkey and Russia?

  [Text] Professor N.D. Khan, Prime Minister Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto's special envoy, met Iranian Foreign Minister `Ali Akbar 
Velayati, in Tehran yesterday. He stressed the need for 
continuing international pressure on India to stop the 
atrocities on Kashmiris. He said that Pakistan, through 
bilateral dialogue, had tried to persuade India to adopt an 
appropriate posture on the Kashmir issue. Pakistan, however, 
felt that it is India's strategy to take time to suppress the 
legitimate demands of the Kashmiri people. He said that Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto has decided to present a resolution at 
the current session of the Human Right Commission meeting in 
Geneva. He expressed the hope that the world community will 
raise its voice against the Indian atrocities in Kashmir. The 
Iranian foreign minister assured the envoy of continued support 
to Pakistan's efforts to stop the human rights violations being 
committed by India and improve the human rights situation in 
Kashmir.

Speaking to the Pakistani prime minister's special emissary,

only at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva but in other 
organizations as well. He said Iran is fully aware of the 
plight of the Muslims in occupied Kashmir. 
  Earlier, the special emissary handed over to the Iranian 
president a letter from Ms. Benazir Bhutto, appealing for Iran's 
support for Pakistan's resolution to be moved at the Human 
Rights Commission to express concern over the human rights 
violations in occupied Kashmir. Prof. N.D. Khan also apprised 
the Iranian leader of the Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir 
and told him that India refuses to take steps to halt these 
atrocities. He also thanked Iran for its traditional and solid

to Serbian state news agency TANJUG. 
  TANJUG, in a recent article, tried to distort facts by 
saying 
the Serbs were being threatened with bombs and missiles by what 
it called the "progressive world public which reacted so 
strongly in defence of Rushdie", only because they do not fit 
into the vision contained in the "Islamic declaration" of 
Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic. 
  Bosnian Serbs face NATO air strikes if they do not withdraw 
their artillery from around Sarajevo which they have been 
pounding for 22 months now. 
  Bosnian President Izetbegovic was imprisoned following an 
infamous trial of Bosnian Muslims by the former Yugoslav 
communist regime, because of his work, the "Islamic declaration". 
  In a letter to TANJUG's editor-in-chief, the Iranian Embassy 
said the author of the text had in a very surprising manner 
distinctly related the decree, later confirmed and supported by 
the organization of the Islamic countries, to the situation in 
Bosnia. 
  "The author's accusation of `Iranian fundamentalism' is 
improper and does not help him in the description of the current 
situation in Bosnia and political action taken in this respect," 
the letter said. 
  The embassy looked forward to correction of the article and 
expected TANJUG to publish rational and fact-based comments, the 
letter concluded.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 17, IRNA -- An Iranian parliament 
deputy has recommended the West not to base its relations with 
Iran on a single person but rather view the situation 
realistically. 
  Interviewed by the English daily TEHRAN TIMES Wednesday [16 
February] Jalal Sa'Adatian commented on the recent uproar the 
Western world made on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of 
the death verdict on apostate Rushdie issued by the founder of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran the late Imam Khomeyni and advised 
Western leaders, particularly British Premier John Major, to 
study Islam. 
  He said that the verdict, issued by imam only to observe one 
of the basic Islamic principles, could neither be withdrawn nor 
altered. 
  Referring to Major's remarks on Feb. 14 on relations with 
Iran, Sa'Adatian noted that Iran had time and again declared it 
had no intention of sending commandos to kill Rushdie. 
  The deputy further urged the west to note that 
Tehran-Britain 
ties should be based on bilateral ties not on a single person.

  [Editorial Report] Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran First Program Network in Persian at 1600 GMT on 16 February 
broadcasts a 30-minute weekly news review program entitled 
"Seven Days, The World." This week's program includes a 
six-minute section on the 14 February anniversary of Ayatollah 
Khomeyni's fatwa calling for Salman Rushdie's death for writing 
the book The Satanic Verses. 
  After reviewing the reasons and results of the fatwa, the 
announcer states: "A coordinated endeavor by the Western media 
focuses on the revival of a current, a current which has been 
practically buried since the issuance of the fatwa. Now, from 
that defeated ploy, only a plaything is left which every now and 
then comes out of its hiding-place, for a few moments, to create 
propaganda fodder for the Western propaganda horns. 
  "In any case the conspiracy of the insulting book, The 
Satanic Verses, was an insult against the beliefs and 
sanctities of more than one billion Muslims which can never be 
explained within the limits of freedom of thought and freedom of 
the pen. The least punishment for a mercenary who carried out 
that plot, is the irrevocable decree for his execution."

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 16, IRNA -- A morning daily here 
Wednesday [16 February] quoted a senior Iranian officials as 
saying that it is contention of the Persian Gulf countries that 
a peace process as distinguished from a process of force, 
intimidation, suppression, submission and surrender has never 
been embarked upon in the region. 
  The English daily TEHRAN TIMES quoted Deputy Foreign 
Minister 
Mohammad Javad Zarif who addressed the United Nations Institute 
for Disarmament Research in Geneva Tuesday. 
  Referring to "a few" countries succumbing to the will of the 
big powers, Zarif said such actions instead of leading to peace 
and stability will only entrench the same threat perceptions 
which will lead to "further insecurity and instability." 
  The "past erroneous approaches and perceptions" deter the 
common attempts "towards a better world order", the daily quoted 
Zarif as saying. 
  He proposed the creation of a forum by Persian Gulf 
countries 
to discuss "security issues, threat perceptions and other 
concerns", ther paper added. 
  Zarif deliberated on the fundamental issues related to 
regional security and to the long-term peace prospects, the 
daily noted. 
  The paper concluded by saying that he mainly discussed the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, specially nuclear, 
and advocated the creation of a zone free of such weapons.

  [Text] Tehran--Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati 
formally issued orders yesterday for the appointment of Mohammad 
Hashemi as his first deputy. 
  It is expected that former head of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran Broadcasting will takeover the second most important and 
sensitive post today. 
  Hashemi was replaced on Sunday by former Minister of Islamic 
Culture and Guidance Dr. 'Ali Larijani. 
  The post is qa'em-maqam, as it is called in Persian, since 
the first deputy traditionally has no specific or defined duties. 
  'Ali Mohammad Besharati held the post before being appointed 
interior minister by President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
last August. 
  Besharati, a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, 
the 
Majles, during its First Term, was appointed first deputy at the 
Foreign Ministry in 1983. During his term of office, he was 
assigned Persian Gulf affairs by Dr. Velayati. 
  It is popularly believed that Besharati was more than 
successful in his mission despite transparent Western schemes to 
keep a rift between Iran and the Arab countries on the other 
side of the Persian Gulf. 
  It will be interesting to see what particular assignment is 
given to Hashemi. The former student of the University of 
California, Berkeley, could be a big help to Dr. Velayati 
because of his awareness of the West and America in particular.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Following differences between Hashemi-Rafsanjani and 
his opponents during the past few days, Hashemi-Rafsanjani's 
brother Mohammad Hashemi who was in charge of the radio and 
television organization, was removed from his position. Some 
time ago, Hashemi-Rafsanjani's opponents in the clerical Majles 
had started to strongly criticize Mohammad Hashemi and were 
accusing him of not paying attention to Islamic values in radio 
and television programs. Thus, they had placed 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani under severe pressures and were questioning 
some of his policies. 
  The removal of Mohammad Hashemi from his position as the 
director of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
[VVIRI] once again revealed the fact that in the existing 
differences among the leadership factions, a large part of the 
Majles deputies oppose Hashemi-Rafsanjani--a Majles that 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani hoped would coordinate with his government, 
his policies, and his programs. However, it is now clear that a 
considerable number of the Majles deputies not only are not in 
coordination with Hashemi-Rafsanjani but are also creating 
problems for him and are thwarting his efforts. 
  Even though the Majles is only an institution and organ of 
the regime, in these differences there is no institution or 
or?on which Hashemi-Rafsanjani can rely and gain their support. 
The Majles, the Council of Guardians, the bazaaris, and RESALAT 
clique, and the supporters of the religious seminaries are 
expressing their opposition to Hashemi-Rafsanjani in one way or 
another. The army and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps too 
are under Khamene'i's orders. The Hezbollah, which manifests 
itself mostly in the form of the Basij, is under Khamene'i's 
orders. 
  Meanwhile, if Hashemi-Rafsanjani had some popular support in 
the past and was able to distract public opinion both at home 
and abroad with his promises, recently with the defeat of his 
economic policy and as a result of the baselessness of his 
promises he has lost this support too. Thus, we can say that 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani has failed in his duties; and this failure 
can be seen both in the economic and social fields and in the 
confrontation with his opponents. 
  Political experts list two major reasons for 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani's weakening position. The first is the 
composition of the Majles and the other is the recent 
considerable increase in the people's dissatisfaction. The 
composition of the Majles is not what Hashemi-Rafsanjani wanted. 
The withdrawal of the extremist faction during the elections of 
the fourth session of the Majles not only did not strengthen 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani but worked to the benefit of the 
conservatives inside the leadership. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani had assumed that if the extremists inside 
the leadership were set aside and especially did not participate 
in the Majles, the rest of the opponents could be tamed by 
giving them some benefits and that he could then do as he 
pleased. However, obviously Hashemi-Rafsanjani was wrong in his 
calculations. Meanwhile, the intensification of the people's 
dissatisfaction during the past couple of years and the 
explosive nature of these feelings in several cities in the 
country made the clerical regime shudder with fear, and during 
the people's uprising and demonstrations, the clergymen heard 
the bases of their rule cracking and disintegrating. 
  Thus, Khamene'i used the pretext of the West's cultural 
onslaught and once again called on the Hezbollah ummah to return 
to the scene, to revive the Basij Organization, and to return 
the regime's suppressive forces to the political scene. Thus, 
the political atmosphere that was created by Khamene'i was not 
to the benefit of Hashemi-Rafsanjani and his situation, and once 
again it became obvious that the regime's main problem is the 
continuation of the Islamic Republic and how to preserve it. 
Long-lasting differences inside the regime increased and new 
differences emerged. 
  It seems that the long-lasting differences between Khamene'i 
and Hashemi-Rafsanjani which emerged after Khomeyni's death have 
become more acute. In this conflict, a large number of 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani's opponents consider the main problems that 
the Islamic Republic faces to stem from Hashemi-Rafsanjani's 
policies and actions. In the middle of all this, a large part 
of the power centers has been placed under Khamene'i's authority 
and the balance of power has shifted to Hashemi-Rafsanjani's 
detriment. 
  These differences have continued and the dismissal of 
Mohammad Hashemi from his position as VVIRI director is yet 
another sign of the process that is weakening 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. The question is: What will 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani do to free himself from this situation? 
Clearly, if he places himself under Khamene'i's cloak, he will 
join the ranks of other clergymen who work under Khamene'i's 
shadow without having any special authority or programs; and if 
he does not do so, then he will have no support of any size to 
confront his opponents, some of whom are standing behind 
Khamene'i and are trying to thwart his efforts in one way or 
another. 
  Under the current situation, Hashemi-Rafsanjani thinks that 
it is better to come to terms with his opponents and rivals to a 
certain extent and the clearest example of this is his 
acceptance of the removal of Mohammad Hashemi from his position 
as VVIRI director, which is considered to be a positive answer 
to the opponents of Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  One can say that under the current situation, neither the 
alliance of Khamene'i and his supporters nor Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
and his clique are able to throw the other out of the scene. 
But the situation will not stay the same and it is improbable 
that either of the two sides will agree with the continuation of 
this situation. 
  It can now be said that the intensification of this process 
and the deepening of the differences and rivalry among the 
various groups of the regime will, first and foremost, further 
paralyze the regime and will also render the regime helpless 
vis-a-vis the crisis which it is now facing. Undoubtedly this 
too will pave the way for the intensification of the regime's 
struggle against the ruling regime.

revealed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Algerian President Liamine 
Zeroual has asked Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad to mediate with 
Iran to end the tension in Algerian-Iranian relations. 
  The sources said that this request came in a message which 
an 
Algerian envoy, namely presidential court director Mohamed 
Sa'idi, delivered to President al-Asad from President Zeroual 
last week. 
  The Syrian sources said that the message dealt with 
conditions in Algeria and bilateral relations, and offered 
condolences to President al-Asad on the loss of his son, Basil 
al-Asad. 
  The sources expects a summit to be held between President 
al-Asad and Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to discuss 
regional issues, relations between Iran and some Arab states, 
the peace process, and issues of common concern. 
  However, the sources did not say whether the meeting will be 
held in Damascus or Tehran.

  [Text] Kathmandu, Feb 17 (AFP) -- King Birendra has called 
parliament to reconvene February 24, officials said Thursday, 
thwarting Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's plan 
to dissolve the legislature and call mid-term polls. 
  An internal feud in the ruling Nepali Congress (NC) has 
already delayed the winter session of parliament for more than a 
week. 
  The main opposition in the parliament, the Nepal Communist 
Party- United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML), had appealed to 
the king to urgently call a parliamentary session to discuss the 
current political situation. 
  The NCP-UML argued that a call for mid-term polls 26 months 
ahead of the expiry of the current parliament's five-year term 
should not be made on Koirala's recommendation alone, and should 
be debated in parliament. 
  The row in the NC started after the defeat of party 
president 
and bitter Koirala rival Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in a 
parliamentary by-election February 7. 
  Koirala had bitterly flayed Bhattarai for criticising him 
and 
the government in a by-election campaign speech. Bhattarai 
supporters and more than 50 NC MPs for their part said the prime 
minister's comments, as well as a deliberately poor campaign 
effort by some NC officials, cost the party the election. 
  Analysts said Koirala wanted a snap election to force the 
party to unify behind him. His party has a fairly comfortable 
majority of 113 seats in the 205-member parliament. 
  Since Bhattarai's defeat, students and front-line NC youth 
supporters have taken to the streets to denounce Koirala, and 
the party's executive body, the Central Working Committee, is 
deciding whether to take action against Koirala for his alleged 
misconduct during the recent by-elections. 
  Most committee members are loyal to Bhattarai and he is 
expected to repeat his call for Koirala to resign when the 
committee completes deliberations, probably on Friday. 
  Party sources said that would lead to a crisis within the NC 
and a possible bid to oust him from the party, but that Koirala 
was seeking support from students and MPs ahead of a showdown.

  [Text] London, Feb. 17, IRNA -- Kuwaiti Minister of 
Information Shaykh Sa'ud al-Sabah says that Iran is a key ally 
for peace in the Persian Gulf, but he did not think there can be 
real security in the region while the Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn remains in power. 
  Speaking at a London press conference Thursday, he said that 
Kuwait had "good relations" with Iran and that his government 
was working as much as it can as a "partner" with Tehran. The 
Islamic Republic was a "major power" and had an important role 
to play in security of the Persian Gulf, the Kuwaiti minister 
told foreign journalists. 
  Iran and Kuwait were fellow victims of Iraqi aggression and 
the former ambassador to London and Washington said that his 
government had "respect" for Iran's policy of neutrality during 
the 1991 allied war to end Iraqi's occupation of Kuwait. 
  Still feeling bitterness, he believed that the Persian Gulf 
region would not be able to enjoy security while Saddam was in 
power. His equal conviction was that UN sanctions against 
Baghdad would not be lifted, either partially or fully, until he 
was replaced. 
  The minister emphasised that he had sympathy with the Iraqi 
people suffering the effects of more than three years of 
sanctions, who he said were also victims of the Iraqi regime 
since Saddam's 1980-88 war against Iran. 
  With regard to the declining price of oil, he suggested that 
producing nations should seriously reassess the value of oil in 
the world and that OPEC and non-OPEC countries needed to 
cooperate together. Kuwait was not liberated for crude rates of 
10 dlrs. [dollars] per barrel, which were "not helpful" to 
anyone.

  [Text] Israeli threats against Lebanon have escalated, 
accompanied as usual by instigation against resistance and 
relying on clear, coordinated U.S. support. The U.S. support 
was evident in U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's 
warning message to Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz and in another 
message from Christopher to Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar'. 
  MENA today cited a responsible source at the U.S. State 
Department as saying that the U.S. secretary of state has sent 
an urgent message to Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul, informing 
him that Israel may carry out a large attack against south 
Lebanon.

  [Text] Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid has again called for convening an Arab conference 
on water immediately within the framework of the Arab League. 
The conference should include the countries directly concerned 
with this problem and other concerned countries that want to 
participate in it so as to define the future strategy of Arab 
water security within the framework of Pan-Arab security. In a 
lecture he delivered yesterday evening at the Egyptian 
University of International Law in Cairo, he said that 
international developments, major economic challenges, and giant 
cartels that have begun to form in the world require the Arab 
countries to take action quickly and to enhance their solidarity 
and cooperation to be able to deal with these challenges and 
blocs strongly and effectively.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb. 16 (MAP) -- The Moroccan 
counter-proposals for a new partnership with Europe submitted 
Monday to the European Commission here focus on commercial and 
financial aspects. 
  A source close to the Moroccan delegation currently visiting 
Brussels told MAP bureau here that the Moroccan delegation had 
from the start pointed out that the negotiations directives 
adopted by the European Ministers' Council last December 6 were 
insufficient in commercial and financial matters. 
  The Moroccan side renewed commitment for more open trade 
relations with the European Union and called for a necessary and 
vital balance between the agricultural and industrial sectors. 
The open relations, the delegation argued, would be started 
progressively and framed by support measures. 
  The delegation underlined that pending the setting forth of 
the new trade relations, and in view of the new data stemming 
from the Uruguay Round it is necessary to adapt the current 
cooperation accord in order to maintain the preferences granted 
so far to Morocco and especially to maintain the flow of 
Morocco's exports of fruits and vegetables. 
  The European Union confirmed in this respect its readiness 
to 
preserve Moroccan trade gains especially regarding fruits and 
vegetables, the same source said. 
  Regarding the financial sector, the Moroccan side pointed 
out 
that the development of financial cooperation should be adapted 
to Morocco's socio-economic conditions, the financial 
constraints entailed by the adjustment policy and its will to 
promote privileged relations and more intense exchanges with the 
European Union. 
  Morocco deems its counter-proposals accurate, comprehensive 
and realistic given the cooperation possibilities with the 
European Union and the complementarity between their economies. 
  The delegation that handed to the European officials the 
memorandum of counter-proposals was led by Moroccan Secretary of 
State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Taieb Fassi Fihri 
[title and spelling as received].

  [Text] Sudanese President Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan 
Ahmad al-Bashir has asserted that through their steadfastness, 
sacrifices, and endurance that is coupled with construction, the 
Iraqi people under President Saddam Husayn have proven that they 
are rightfully a faithful people who adhere to the Arab nation's 
objectives. This is a new victory which the Iraqis have 
achieved for their nation and for Iraq, and also a retreat and 
defeat for the enemies of both the Iraqis and the nation. 
  Receiving Iraqi Transport and Communications Minister Ahmad 
Murtada in Khartoum today, the Sudanese president added that the 
countries which launched the treacherous 30-state aggression on 
Iraq are today suffering from disturbances, internal crises, and 
an unstable situation when Iraq is continuously proceeding 
forward and restoring all that was destroyed in the aggression 
to a better condition with a new militant spirit in all walks of 
life despite the unfair blockade. 
  Lt. Gen. al-Bashir asked the Iraqi transport and 
communications minister to convey his greetings to President 
leader Saddam Husayn and the proud Iraqi people. He expressed 
his high appreciation of Iraq's support for Sudan in the 
technical, consultative, and engineering fields. Sudanese 
Transport and Communications Minister 'Uthman 'Abd-al-Qadir and 
the Iraqi ambassador in Khartoum attended the meeting.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih has 
expressed regret that the Sudanese opposition is seeking 
protection from foreign forces to achieve its goals. He said 
the foremost concern of the so-called opposition is now an 
attempt to impose sanctions against Sudan. He added that the 
meeting in the British House of Commons in which the scattered 
remnants of the opposition are participating is not of concern. 
He said the opposition's talk of a war of extermination taking 
place in the south is completely devoid of truth and that Sudan 
denies the prejudiced allegations against it. He said what is 
going in the south at present is fighting between the various 
factions of the rebellion and that the Sudanese Army is doing 
its duty to spread security and to preserve the unity of Sudan.

  [Text] The Transitional National Assembly has condemned the 
report on Sudan presented by the rapporteur of the UN Human 
Rights (?Committee), Gaspar Biro, which described Islamic law 
and punishment as contradictory to UN charters and incompatible 
with human rights. The assembly asked the UN secretary general 
to (?withdraw) the report immediately because it brought into 
disrepute the faith of the Islamic nation. It was a flagrant 
challenge to all divine religions and human values and 
destructive to human rights and international charters. 
  In a report on this matter, the Assembly called on all 
parliaments in Arab and Islamic states and others which respect 
human rights and values to decisively reject this defamation. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. 'Abd-al-Aziz Shiddu, justice minister and 
attorney general, stressed that Gaspar Biro's report is clearly 
a conspiracy against [words indistinct] the West's design to 
destroy Islam and all other divine religions. He said the 
report had a secular base which called for the separation of 
religion and the state and used the United Nations as a tool to 
achieve this.

  [Text] Mr. (Bel Lel), former secretary general of Ayanya 
Two and a returnee from the ranks of the rebels, has condemend 
Riak Machar's dismissal of Dr. Lam Akol, who is in charge of the 
United faction of the rebel movement's foreign relations. (Lel) 
stated that Akol was dismissed because of intensive pressure 
brought to bear by foreign forces and the so-called alliance 
against Lam Akol's opposition to a reunion with rebel Garang. 
He pointed out that Machar was not empowered to dismiss Lam 
Akol by himself. (Lel) attacked Garang, describing him as a 
criminal and a double-crosser. 
  Machar and Akol had led the faction that split from Garang 
in 
August 1991. They formed the Nasir group, which fought in 
fierce battles against Garang in some areas, with both sides 
incurring heavy loses. The conflict then turned into mutual 
retaliatory campaigns and attempts at tribal revenge, the last 
of which took place last week when tribes from upper Nile and 
Bahr al-Ghazal attacked a camp west of Nimule housing the 
families of combatants of the Garang faction, many of whom fled 
to Uganda.

  [Text] Islamabad, London--The two commanders of the Afghan 
rebels are preparing to travel to Tehran in an attempt to obtain 
more Iranian support for their confrontation with interim 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani. 
  Afghan and Pakistani sources have stated that Golboddin 
Hekmatyar, interim prime minister and leader of the Hezb-e 
Eslami, has requested an invitation to visit Tehran. The Uzbek 
leader, 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, who has been prominent as a strong 
man in the tripartite alliance including himself, Hekmatyar, and 
the Shiite leader 'Ali Mazari, will also visit the Iranian 
capital. 
  A conference in Tehran including the Uzbek, Shiite, and 
Pashtun commanders may lead to the formation of a new allied 
government that will attempt to force the removal of Rabbani and 
his unseen administration. 
  Hekmatyar, who has rejected a fasting month (Ramadan) 
ceasefire, contacted the Iranian foreign minister, 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati, by telephone yesterday demanding that Iran take on a 
greater role in ending the conflict in Afghanistan. 
  Dostam and Hekmatyar hope to mobilize Iranian, Uzbek, and 
Russian support to counter the increasing pressure from 
Pakistan, the Islamic Conference Organization, and the United 
Nations. 
  Rabbani has not yet been able to obtain support for his plan 
to host a conference of well-known personalities, tribal leaders 
and religious leaders to select a new government. In the last 
few days, he has faced mounting pressure, especially from 
Pakistan, to agree to resign as soon as a peace conference is 
convened. 
  Dostam and Hekmatyar counter the Rabbani plan with a demand 
to conduct public elections under the auspices of the United 
Nations within three months after the ceasefire. Their condition 
[for this] remains the resignation of Rabbani.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Taba talks, in Cairo, Egypt, by Yusuf Isma'il 
in the studio, from "The Week in 1 Hour" program -- live relay] 
  [Excerpts] [Isma'il] Dr. Nabil, we are talking to you from 
"The Week in 1 Hour" program. We understand from the statements 
made after the last round of talks that ended yesterday in Taba 
that there is much hope and optimism, that some points have been 
concluded, and that the resumption of the talks next week in 
Cairo will almost be a summing up of the talks. What is the 
picture on the evening of this Friday? 
  [Sha'th] Undoubtedly, progress has been made. This progress 
stems from the fact that we have reached the last part of these 
talks. There was a prior understanding on numerous components 
of this part. Now we are at the final drafting stage. 
Therefore, we managed to wrap up an important part relating to 
the Palestinian police force, security measures, and security 
liaison. We also wrapped up a significant part of the transfer 
of civilian powers. We discussed in detail the issue of the 
general amnesty of prisoners and release of prisoners. We have 
begun the final drafting of the overall preamble, or the overall 
agreement. I believe that it was an important and successful 
week. 
  [Isma'il] I would like to ask you about two issues. First 
of all, regarding the Palestinian police force -- as far as I 
remember you demanded 15,000 policemen and Israel gave its 
consent for 6,000. What are the chances of reaching a settlement 
on this issue? 
  [Sha'th] In fact, I do not wish to discuss numbers. I 
believe that discussing such details will harm the achievement 
of a final result, which requires both sides to arrive at real 
figures that will lead to a conclusion. We want to ensure 
stability for the Palestinian resident. We wish to provide the 
security that every Palestinian and Israeli resident wants. The 
attainment of this security requires an efficient and capable 
police force apart from all economic and political safety 
measures, participation, and democracy. Therefore, the issue is 
not only one of figures. It is a comprehensive perception of 
the issue. 
  [Isam'il] It seems that you are in agreement with Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres who was interviewed today by Qol Yisra'el 
in Hebrew. He almost made the same remarks. He said that 
figures are not important and, ultimately, the issue must be 
settled. There is hope then. 
  [Sha'th] I believe that next week we will manage to settle 
this matter. 
  [Isma'il] The other issue which I wanted to ask you about is 
the release of prisoners, which you have been demanding from the 
outset. The PLO chairman raised this issue once more today in 
Holland. On the other hand, Israel says that in accordance with 
the annual custom at the 'Id al-Fitr or at festivals and other 
occasions, it releases prisoners. Can you tell us anything new 
about this issue? 
  [Sha'th] In fact, the Israeli authorities' release on 
certain occasions -- during Ramadan and the 'Id al-Fitr -- of 
detainees whose prison terms have ended or are about to end is 
different from what we are talking about. We are talking about 
a comprehensive release as part of this agreement. We are 
talking about an integral timetble. Therefore, this goes beyond 
responding only to humanitarian and religious requirements and 
occasions to ending a situation that existed due to the presence 
of the occupation and its resistance. Now we are heading toward 
a new situation. Therefore, all those who were part of the 
previous situation of occupation and resistance should be 
released. 
  [Isma'il] This is your demand, but what is the reality? 
What are the contacts between you and the Israeli authorities? 
Can we give the good news to our viewers in the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip that you have received promises on the release of 
prisoners? 
  [Sha'th] Yes, I believe that as soon as the agreement is 
signed, a few thousand will be released. However, after this 
there will be a timetable for a gradual release within framework 
of the peaceful measures that we are endeavoring to achieve and 
within context of the arrival of the Palestinian authority and 
its shouldering of responsibility. 
  [Isma'il] Dr. Nabil, my understanding then is that during 
the month of Ramadan an agreement will be signed and practical 
work will begin. 
  [Sha'th] I hope so. You know that such issues are not 
subject to negotiating considerations alone but to numerous 
political considerations. I believe that we can reach an 
agreement by the 'Id al-Fitr [on or about 13 March] at the 
latest so that the feast may have more than one meaning. For 
several reasons, however, it is difficult for one to make an 
accurate prediction. If not by this feast, then the agreement 
will be reached very close to it. I hope, however that we will 
sign before this feast, God willing. [passage omitted] 
  [Isma'il] I understand that Cairo is aware of all 
Israeli-Palestinian contacts and of all the negotiations' 
secrets. Are the other parties, specially Syria, also aware of 
what is taking place in the talks? 
  [Sha'th] Fraternal Syria and all Arab and international 
parties concerned are briefed about the results of our work. 
Naturally, however, not as much as the two neighboring and 
principal Arab parties, namely, Egypt and Jordan. The talks are 
being conducted in Egypt and we have a special relationship with 
Jordan. Therefore, the Egyptian and Jordanian Governments are 
provided with detailed information, but the other governments 
are provided with less detail and only periodically. 
  [Isma'il] Have you heard that an Israeli Arab delegation 
might be visiting Damascus to offer condolences to President 
al-Asad on Basil's death? 
  [Sha'th] I believe that the emotions of our sons everywhere 
regarding the tragedy that struck President Hafiz al-Asad are 
real and sincere. 
  [Isma'il] But the significant thing is that the Syrian 
authorities have given their approval for such a step for the 
first time. Do you see any political meaning or indication by 
this? 
  [Sha'th] There is no doubt that there are numerous meanings 
and indications in any such act. However, it is also a 
framework for interaction. Undoubtedly, there are also 
political considerations in this act. 
  [Isma'il] Dr. Nabil, we thank you for coming to the studio 
in Cairo. Every viewer is now probably asking: What will be 
the outcome? What can you say to the viewers in the West Bank 
and the Gaza Strip this evening in one minute? 
  [Sha'th] I say to them that the problem is difficult and 
that we are embarking on building an entity and a homeland in 
which there will be freedom, self-confidence, and hopes for the 
future. I call on them to be patient. I believe that we will 
be on the threshhold of this new challenge. 
  [Isma'il] We thank Dr. Nabil Sha'th for this interview, the 
first one in our program via direct relay from Cairo. Our 
correspondents have met with you in Tunis and Taba, but it is 
the first time that we are meeting with Cairo and Dr. Nabil 
Sha'th via satellite. God willing, we will have other meetings 
with you. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Feb (MENA)--Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators started in Cairo today a new round of talks on the 
final arrangements for temporary Palestinian self-rule in the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  The talks began with a private meeting between Dr. Nabil 
Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, and General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of 
staff, to draw up the agenda of the talks. 
  Afterward, the meeting of the Security Affairs Committee 
began under Dr. Sha'th and General Shahaq. The Civilian Affairs 
Committee also met under attorney Jamil al-Tarifi representing 
the Palestinian side and Gadi Zohar representing the Israeli 
side. 
  Ya'qov Neriah, political adviser to Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin, is participating in the talks for the first time. 
  Palestinian sources said Y'aqov Neriah's participation in 
the 
talks means the Israeli side is serious about reaching an 
agreement on the points of differences still under discussion. 
The sources noted the positive atmosphere and the great 
progress made during the last round of talks in Taba. 
  Hasan 'Asfur and Y'aqov Neriah told journalists that the 
talks will be held in secret and that the press will not be 
allowed to cover them. The Palestinian and Israeli negotiators 
will hold intensive talks until Wednesday, when Sha'th and 
Shahaq will announce the results at a news conference.

  [Excerpt] The PLO is seeking Israeli consent to the entry 
of its intelligence and police officers into the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho prior to the Israeli evacuation. Our Arab affairs 
correspondent Ehud Ya'ari says that in the discussions, which 
resumed in Cairo today, the Palestinians stressed that such a 
move is essential to prevent an interim vacuum in the 
territories. 
  [Ya'ari] The talks, which were resumed at Cairo's Shepherd 
Hotel today, are headed by Major General Amnon Shahaq and Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th. Members of both delegations have said that on 23 
February, they may be able to deliver a public statement on the 
results of this round. 
  This time the Civilian Affairs Committee will discuss issues 
such as a fuel excise tax, the manner in which stamps printed by 
Palestinians will be introduced and used, and the Palestinian 
city planning powers. The Security Committee will decide on the 
number of Palestinian police and their equipment. The 
Palestinians want to set up a UN-supervised police training camp 
in the Bethlehem area, but Israel refuses to allow any foreign 
sponsorship. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Amman -- One of the key hurdles in an agreement 
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) 
in their autonomy negotiations is an Israeli insistence that no 
members of groups opposing the autonomy agreement would be 
released from Israeli jails, informed sources said Saturday [19 
February]. 
  The sources could not confirm reports that Muhammad Zahlan, 
who heads the Palestinian side to the negotiations on prison 
release, was refusing to return to the talks next week in 
protest against what he saw as the PLO's gradual move towards 
accepting the Israeli condition. 
  Having made progress in reaching agreements on key security 
issues and a general framework for a Palestinian police force to 
deploy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho under the Sept. 13 autonomy 
plan, Israel and the PLO are unable to move forward on the 
prisoner release issue, the sources said. 
  "The Israelis are insisting that no known supporter of the 
hardline groups which oppose the autonomy agreement will be 
released," said a source familiar with the negotiations held at 
the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba. 
  "The Palestinians have been resisting this, demanding that a 
prisoner release come under a general amnesty covering all 
Palestinian detainees regardless of their affiliation," said the 
source. 
  Independent Palestinian analysts said PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat appeared to be betting on a mass release of Palestinians 
from Israeli prisons to dilute opposition to the autonomy accord. 
  "'Arafat's comments on Friday have reaffirmed his approach," 
said one analyst. He was referring to a statement by the PLO 
chairman during a visit to the Netherlands that he could not 
"sign a final agreement without having a guarantee for the 
release of all prisoners." 
  Red Cross figures indicate that 9,000 Palestinians are held 
in Israeli jails while PLO officials say the figure is closer to 
12,000. Israel puts the number of detainees at 6,000. 
  Israel has agreed in principle to a prisoner release but 
ruled out a general amnesty. 
  According to PLO sources, more than half of the detainees 
belong to groups such as the Islamic Resistance Movement 
(Hamas), Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine (PFLP), the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestinian (DFLP) and other factions which have vowed to wreck 
the autonomy agreement. 
  But in line with his strategy to create good will among the 
Palestinians, Mr. 'Arafat has been demanding that Israel make no 
discrimination among the prisoners. 
  Sources among the dissident groups also said that despite 
their fierce opposition to the self-rule accord, Mr. 'Arafat and 
his aides had been insisting that their members also be released 
from Israeli detention. 
  "I do not know whether there was any shift in the PLO stand 
last week in Taba, but our information is that 'Arafat is 
refusing to accept anything less than a complete prisoner 
release," said a prominent figure among the dissidents. 
  Meanwhile, an independent Palestinian source said Mr. 
Zahlan, 
a member of the Palestine National Council from the Gaza Strip, 
was refusing to return to the negotiations with Israel. 
  "Mr. Zahlan believes that the PLO is going to accept the 
Israeli condition against releasing members of groups which do 
not support the autonomy accord," said the source. "As such, he 
wants no part of the deal since he would not be able to live 
with such a compromise." 
  The other sources said they were not aware of a shift in the 
PLO stand that would prompt such a response from Mr. Zahlan. 
  "The PLO negotiators (in Taba) have not accepted any 
compromise over prisoner release," said the source. "The issue 
is very much on the table, and it would be dealt with when the 
talks resume" in Cairo on Monday.

a draft for a peace agreement between Israel and Jordan. Talks 
on the Israel-Jordan track will resume Tuesday [22 February] and

  [Text] Palestine President Yasir 'Arafat once again accused 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of prevaricating on 
Palestinian autonomy. 
  Speaking to reporters upon arrival in Amman today, President 
'Arafat criticized Rabin for suggesting a delay in the April 
13th deadline for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. 
  He said he was astonished by Rabin's insistence not to 
implement the PLO-Israeli accord accurately and honestly. 
  [Begin recording] ['Arafat] I am completely astonished why 
he 
is insisting not to follow up and not to implement accurately 
and honestly what had been agreed upon. 
  [Unidentified reporter] When do you expect to sign the 
agreement on the self-rule? 
  ['Arafat] What he is saying is that he is trying to bypass 
what had been agreed upon. 
  [Reporter] When do you expect to be back in Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] We have to wait and see. [end recording]

  [Text] Brother Mahmud 'Abbas, Abu Mazin, PLO Executive 
Committee member, has said that the time element favors neither 
the Palestinians nor the peace process. As time goes by 
frustration and despondency grow ever deeper, 'Abbas observed. 
  In remarks published in Manama today, he said the 
Palestinian-Israeli peace accord must be based on clear 
guidelines rather than on theory. He blamed the delay in 
implementing the agreement on all kinds of details raised by 
Israel. Such tactics, he said, call the final results into 
question. 
  He indicated that once agreement is reached on the broad 
outlines, it will be easy to tackle problems on the ground. 
  Asked about Israel's position on the Palestinian state, 
Abu-Mazin said the Palestinian state is a certainty. He called 
on Israel to honor the 13 April deadline for Israel's pullout 
from Gaza and Jericho. Unless the deadline is met, the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement is likely to come to nothing, he 
stressed.

  [Text] Tunis, 18 Feb (MENA)--Citing informed Palestinian 
sources in Jerusalem, the Tunisian newspaper AL-SABAH reports 
that Faysal al-Husayni and several other Palestinian leaders 
inside the occupied territories have rejected an Israeli offer 
to provide them with police guards. The Israeli authorities 
warned the Palestinian leaders that they might be attacked by 
members of fanatical Jewish organizations. 
  The Palestinians sources said the warning was repeated 
following the recent progress in the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations and the imminent implementation of the transitional 
period. 
  The sources pointed out that Israeli rightist groups and 
parties are very critical of the statements made by al-Husayni 
and other figures pertaining to the Palestinian determination to 
establish a Palestinian state that has its capital in Jerusalem.

  [Text] Tunis -- A high-ranking Palestinian source has said 
that the West Bank and the Gaza Strip need 30,000 policemen to 
control security and calm the situation after the Israeli 
withdrawal. The sources said that the cost of this number could 
reach $560 million, while the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip 
need 10,000 for the transitional phase, costing $212 million. 
  The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Israel, which always 
uses security concerns as an excuse, is rejecting these figures 
and believes they are exaggerated, demanding that they be 
reduced to 5,000 or 6,000 policemen only. The source, who asked 
to remain anonymous, added that the Israeli proposal has been 
rejected, and that this rejection has been conveyed to the 
Palestinian delegation to the Taba committee negotiations aimed 
at determining the number of the Palestinian police forces and 
the type of weapons they are going to use. The source pointed 
out that the Israeli side is also refusing to agree to the 
Palestinian police forces being armed with heavy, or even 
medium, weapons. 
  The source confirmed that numerous states -- among them 
Britain, Sweden, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, Russia, and the 
United States -- have submitted proposals to train and arm the 
Palestinian police. But they still remain promises and 
statements in the air, while the United States has recently 
trained a special security team for Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat. 
  The source emphasized that Israel is flooding the occupied 
territories with light and medium weapons and equipment in 
preparation for implementing certain schemes designed to 
sabotage the peace process, foment sedition, and spread panic 
among Palestinian citizens, and also to show the extent of the 
Palestinian security forces' competence in controlling the 
Palestinian scene. 
  The source added that arms have spread rapidly and there are 
now about 12,000 pieces. He pointed out that Israel has full 
lists of those who have arms.

  [Text] Colonel Ibrahim Muhanna, commander of the

affiliations of applicants to the force make a difference in 
their chances of appointment. 
  He told the BBC that candidates for appointment to the 
police 
force are selected in accordance with Palestinian law and draft 
regulations. He indicated that out of approximately 11,000 
candidates who have applied to join the Palestinian police 
force, 3,000 have so far passed the medical test. I have no 
right to ask any applicant about his affiliation, he stressed. 
  Muhanna indicated that the spread of arms carries grave 
risks 
for the Palestinian people. When Palestinian police are 
deployed in the occupied territories, they will operate under a 
Palestinian penal code, and law breakers will be prosecuted. 
Muhanna noted that, in certain respects, that there is 
cooperation between Palestinian police and Israeli authorities.

  [Text] Amman--Taysir Qub'ah, deputy speaker of the 
Palestine National Council, has stated that the Cairo agreement 
on the security arrangements at the crossing points in Gaza and 
Jericho is a new indicator of the threats posed by both the Oslo 
agreement and the policy of selling out our people's national 
rights. 
  Qub'ah added that the Cairo agreement clearly proves the 
quality of the field arrangements and applications of the Oslo 
agreement. It is also a new submission to the Israeli conditions 
and the U.S.-Egyptian pressures, and includes serious 
concessions which undermine our people's national sovereignty 
over their land, and deals a blow to our people's supreme 
interests. These interests are linked to our people's right to 
self-determination and to establishing an independent national 
state. 
  Qub'ah pointed out that in return for formal and marginal 
powers for the Palestinian authority, which will save the 
leadership's face a little and grant it private personal 
privileges, there is recognition of Israel's full control of the 
borders, crossing points, passages, and roads. Under the 
agreement, the settlements remain and Israel maintains 
supervision of their security as well as the security of the 
Israelis in the occupied territories. Also, the Israeli 
military orders remain valid without even a modest mention that 
such orders would be circumvented later. Thus, the Israeli 
military authorities' hegemony over both the external and 
internal security will be consecrated, Qub'ah added.

  [Excerpt] The Alliance of Palestinian Forces opened 
meetings in Damascus yesterday to coordinate common stands to 
deal with political developments in light of the Cairo agreement 
struck recently between President 'Arafat and the Israeli 
foreign minister. 
  Alliance sources told AL-RA'Y the formation of a "unified 
national Islamic leadership of the intifadah" will top the 
agenda of this important session. 
  The sources also expect raising the question of claiming the 
same armed fedayeen operations by more than one faction of the 
alliance to put an end to this phenomenon. 
  Hamas and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP] have both claimed several military operations 
against Israeli occupation, the latest of which was a military 
operation against settlers near Hebron on 6 February. This 
strained relations between Hamas and the DFLP at the time. 
  Some Palestinian quarters think the alliance factions have 
so 
far failed to coordinate their electoral efforts in the occupied 
territories. This was the reason for Fatah's success in the 
elections of the doctors' union in Gaza Strip two days ago. All 
of Fatah's candidates won the 11 seats of the union. [passage

capitulatory agreements. We also welcome joint action in major 
jihad battles against the occupation troops and settlers. 
  In a statement following his return from Damascus the day 
before yesterday, Ghawshah added: The central command of the 
Alliance of Palestinian Forces held two five-hour sessions and 
discussed the bylaws of the alliance and the organization 
[tartib] of the effective arenas in the occupied homeland, 
Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. He said: A major part of the 
meetings, held last Saturday and Sunday, was devoted to the 
political activation of the alliance on the official and popular 
levels as well as initial discussion of visits to some Arab 
countries by delegations of the alliance forces to explain their 
views toward the developments of the Palestine question. He 
added: We discussed the possibility of forming delegations to 
hold official meetings without specifying certain capitals or 
dates. 
  Asked about the [PLO-Israeli] Cairo agreement, Ghawshah 
said: 
We have not discussed this issue seriously, but a joint 
statement in the name of the alliance will shortly be issued in 
this regard. 
  Four Palestinian factions included in the alliance issued a 
statement a few days ago condemning the Cairo agreement, 
considering it a step in a series of submissions to the Israeli 
negotiating terms. 
  Ghawshah indicated that the alliance's central committee 
members held a lengthy discussion on coordination and ways to 
bolster it in the occupied territory elections in the wake of 
the Gaza Doctors Union elections, in which the alliance was 
defeated due to lack of coordination. 
  Answering a question on Yitzhaq Rabin's call on Hamas to 
engage in dialogue, he said: The occupation forces continue to 
seek dialogue with Hamas through some of its imprisoned leaders, 
but our principled political stand rejects dialogue with the 
occupation forces. The only dialogue lies in escalating the 
jihad operations and intifadah activities until the liberation 
of the Palestinian people, even if this takes scores of years.

  [Text] Amman--QUDS PRESS--The Islamic Resistance Movement, 
Hamas, has criticized the current alliance formula among the 
Palestinian opposition factions. 
  Ibrahim Ghawshah, the official Hamas spokesman, told QUDS 
PRESS: We (in the Movement) consider the Palestinian alliance 
formula as not being sufficiently ambitious to the degree Hamas 
was seeking. It is rather a reconciliatory formula which does 
not achieve the desired aspirations, he added. 
  Ghawshah, who recently participated in the Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces [APF] meetings held in Damascus on 19 and 20 
February, urged upgrading the current alliance formula. He said 
this is a temporary formula which should be upgraded. He 
pointed out that the Palestinian factions should work for a 
formula to establish an elected Palestinian parliament, similar 
to all democratic states. Such a parliament would truly express 
the Palestinian people's position on all issues related to their 
destiny and future, as he put it. 
  Ghawshah stressed his movement's refusal to consider the 
popular conferences as a political reference from which a 
representative council can emanate. He said: This formula 
partially expresses the people's opinion, but we believe in 
total expression. This is a point of difference with the 
democratic (leftist) factions in particular. 
  The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and 
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] had 
called for holding conferences in the places where the 
Palestinians are present in order to create a leadership 
representing the Palestinians. 
  Regarding the meetings of the APF Central Command recently 
held in Damascus, Ghawshah said they discussed three issues: 
first, the internal arrangements (the alliance); second, the 
regulations pertaining to these arrangements; and third, the 
activity in the territories and among the Palestinians in 
Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. 
  Ghawshah pointed out that the meetings touched on ways to 
enhance coordination in the territories in light of the APF's 
failure in (the elections of) the Doctors Association in Gaza. 
He stressed that this failure resulted from lack of 
coordination among the opposition factions. 
  Ghawshah added that the Damascus meetings worked out 
preliminary programs to activate the APF on the political and 
popular levels. The conferees also agreed to organize visits by 
APF representatives to hold contacts in the world in general and 
in the Islamic world in particular on the official and popular 
levels. He pointed out that these visits aim to stress to the 
world that the Palestinian people adhere to their land, future, 
and homeland. Ghawshah revealed a draft for internal 
regulations for the APF. A dialogue will be held in order to 
endorse these regulations during a meeting of APF officials 
whose date will be set soon.

  [Text] Damascus, 21 Feb (SANA)--The Palestinian Hamas 
Movement has reiterated its rejection of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement and all its annexes because they represent dangerous 
concessions and humiliating submission to the Israeli occupation. 
  In a statement today, the movement said it rejects any 
dialogue between Hamas and Israel, saying the only language the 
Israeli enemy understands will remain the language of force and 
struggle, not the language of concessions and capitulation. 
  The statement said that all the Israeli attempts to open 
dialogue with Hamas members detained in Israeli prisons have 
failed, and will never be successful.

  [Text] Amman, QUDS PRESS -- An official of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] has said there are 
no arrangements to hold a meeting between PFLP Secretary General 
George Habash and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. 
  In a telephone interview with QUDS PRESS, 'Abd-al-Rahim 
Malluh, member of the PFLP Political Bureau, denied reports 
about an upcoming meeting between 'Arafat and Habash. Malluh 
said these reports are groundless. 
  Palestinian sources close to Fatah had spoken about a 
meeting 
to be held between the two Palestinian leaders who arrived in 
Amman to attend a Yemeni reconciliation meeting. 
  Malluh said the PFLP still thinks there is no political 
common ground to hold such a meeting. He said: Our dispute 
with Yasir 'Arafat -- over the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration 
of Principles reached in Oslo and the Cairo agreement on 
implementing the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho -- precludes any 
common ground for a meeting with him, as Malluh put it. 
  The PFLP is opposed to a self-rule agreement struck between 
the PLO and Israel and signed in Washington on 13 September. 
Like other opposition factions, the PFLP refuses to hold any 
meeting with the PLO leadership before annulling this agreement 
and subsequent accords.

<F P=106> [Article by Nasim Barhum: "A Slight Security Setback"] </F>
  [Text] Unidentified people have sent two shocking messages 
to Jordan, in Beirut and Amman respectively. It is unlikely, 
however, that the country will be engulfed in a cycle of 
violence. 
  Only a few weeks ago, Jordan was one of the most stable Arab 
countries, despite isolated events over the past two or three 
years. But early in February, Jordan was hit by a cycle of 
violence that had disturbed some Arab countries. In just one 
week two explosions rocked two movie theaters: in Amman on 27 
January and in al-Zarqa', the second-largest city, on 1 
February. Also, unidentified gunmen assassinated 'Umran 
al-Ma'ayitah, first secretary at the Jordanian embassy, in 
Beirut. 
  What has given rise to fears in Arab and Jordanian circles 
is 
that the security problems have been the result of two factors: 
first, the emergence of a crisis in Jordanian-Iranian relations, 
when Amman asked Tehran to withdraw 21 Iranian diplomats from 
the embassy in Amman. And, second, the official Jordanian 
announcement that the perpetrators were "Jordanian Afghans" 
[reference to Jordanians who fought in Afghanistan]. The 
connection between the security problems and the crisis with 
Iran and the Arab Afghans gives the situation a political 
dimension that triggers fears. 
  Although Jordan has not officially announced that there is a 
crisis with Iran, and Tehran radio has denied any crisis between 
the two countries, the Jordanian request for the withdrawal of 
21 Iranian diplomats could reflect Jordanian indignation, 
according to political circles in Amman. They say that the 
Jordanian authorities accuse Iranian diplomats of meeting with 
Jordanian Muslim extremists. 
  Western sources in Amman say that Jordan is not happy with 
the presence of Iranian ambassador in Amman Ahmad Dastmalchian, 
who is a former Iranian Revolution guard and played a 
significant role in establishing Lebanon's Hizballah. However, 
this has not yet been confirmed. 
  At any rate, the diplomatic crisis between the two countries 
is not the only explanation for the outbreak of violence in 
Jordan. Other circles link these acts to the big strides that 
Jordan has made on the road to peace. The events occurred a 
week after King Husayn announced in Washington that he is ready 
to meet in public with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
Other circles, however, believe that the incidents were linked, 
that is, the crisis with Iran coincided with the Jordanian 
monarch's announcement. 
  The question is: Are these isolated events transient or are 
they a prelude to an era of violence in Jordan? This is a 
particularly important question after the strongly worded 
statement by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' that 
Jordan's political options could affect its internal stability. 
  It is difficult to answer this question. However, it is most 
unlikely that the situation in Jordan will become as serious as 
in some countries, such as in the Arab east or Arab Maghreb. 
This is because the acts of violence in Algeria, and in a less 
critical degree in Egypt, are prompted by difficult economic 
conditions and unemployment. This, however, is not the case in 
Jordan because the economic situation there is not that bad. 
Some people even say that the Jordanian economy has improved 
over the past two years. This is explained in the retreat of 
the Islamic movement in the recent legislative elections, when 
it won only 18 out of 81 seats in the parliament. The movement 
had 32 seats in the past. 
  Furthermore, the Islamic movement in Jordan is different 
from 
that in Algeria or Egypt. It is a movement that has never 
resorted to violence and has accepted functioning in accordance 
with the democratic game. The Islamic movement in Jordan has 
continuously maintained good relations with authorities. 
  Hence, perhaps this cycle of violence is a transient wave 
linked to specific tactics by certain regional and local forces, 
unless there are plans to involve Jordan in the acts of violence. 
  It is premature to assess the events in Jordan. It is also 
difficult to say that the storm is over or that it will assume 
different shapes. What has happened should alert us, but it 
does not require us to reconsider our stances. What has 
happened cannot be more than a slight setback linked to certain 
tactics that are not aimed at sabotaging the strategic stability 
of Jordan, which represents an important link in the peace 
process.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Feb (MENA)--Commenting on U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's statement that Libya represents a threat to U.S. 
national security, Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, assistant Arab 
League secretary general, said today it is difficult to believe 
this. Had this been true, U.S. national security would appear 
fragile and more like a paper tiger just when various U.S. 
sources testify to the opposite. 
  Ambassador 'Imran said what is true is that the continuation 
of U.S. threats and UN sanctions against Libya represent a 
threat to stability in the Middle East. 
  He noted that the Arab League is continuing its efforts to 
settle the Libyan-Western crisis in a way that would protect 
Libya's dignity and sovereignty and remove the misunderstanding 
between it and the countries concerned. 
  Ambassador 'Imran added that what has been clear since the 
first UN Security Council resolution was issued against Libya is 
that the Western countries have exploited the Security Council 
and the international situation to pass resolutions without fear 
from any party. 
  He expressed the view that these resolutions are contrary to 
the UN Charter, the constitution of the international 
organization, which confirms the right of every state to 
exercise sovereignty over its own territory. 
  He explained that these resolutions set a serious precedent 
which shakes the confidence of the nations in this organization. 
For this reason the Arab League has called for a suitable 
solution to this crisis.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Feb (MENA)--An Arab League committee 
discussing means of turning the Middle East to an area free from 
mass destruction weapons began its meetings at the Arab League 
today. 
  Dr. Nu'man Jalal, chairman of the committee and Egypt's 
permanent delegate to the Arab League, said that the committee 
has prepared a paper that it will present to the next session of 
the Arab League Council, due to be held on 27 March. The paper 
contains a plan to coordinate Arab efforts through various 
international forums with a view to stressing the importance of 
creating a zone that is free from mass destruction weapons in 
the Middle East. 
  Dr. Jalal said that the plan incorporates various elements 
in 
the Arab position, foremost of which is the desire to end the 
arms race in the region and its security and economic 
repercussions. Resources currently used to stockpile arms should 
be diverted to boost economic development programs and modernize 
the region's economies, Dr. Jalal stated. 
  Dr. Jalal added that the committee stressed the need for all 
the countries in the region to be treated equally, with no 
exceptions made for any.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Nuclear Nonproliferation in South Asia, the </F>
U.S. Biased Attitude"] 
  [Text] In his annual report to the U.S. Congress on South 
Asia and the prevention of proliferation of nuclear arms, 
President Bill Clinton has reiterated that both Pakistan and 
India can manufacture nuclear arms in limited quantities within 
a relatively short period of time. Also stating in his report 
that Pakistan has not abandoned its nuclear program, the U.S. 
President has suggested that if Pakistan and the PRC consent to 
prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms, talks will be held 
with them, and the sanctions imposed on them will also be 
lifted. As is reflected in the contents of the report, the U.S. 
President has leveled allegations against Pakistan and India on 
the manufacture of nuclear weapons but has overtly exempted 
India from committing itself to nuclear nonproliferation and has 
maintained pressure on Pakistan. This indicates that the United 
States is openly biased on the India-Pakistan matter. Our 
politicians and policy makers should take note of this, and 
while formulating future policies, they should bear in mind that 
we need not look to any side or take orders on our national 
affairs; we should adopt a clear stand on them. Despite our 
repeated assurances, knowing all this full well, the only 
superpower has rejected our legitimate and clear stand.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] Referring to Syrian President al-Asad's 
agreement to accept a condolence-bearing delegation of Israeli 
Arabs headed by Knesset Member [MK] 'Abd-al-Wahab Darawshah, 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said on 18 February that it is "too 
little, too late." Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's 
ambassador to the United States, issued a similar reaction. 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said this is "a positive signal" 
from al-Asad. 
  Syria announced that it will allow the delegation to arrive 
in Syria only through a third country, and not directly from 
Israel through the Golan Heights, and that it will not stamp the 
visitors' passports. Political sources in Jerusalem said 
yesterday that the fact that Darawshah was invited to Damascus 
should not be overrated. At the same time, they pointed out two 
positive aspects: the fact that Syria has agreed to allow the 
visit of an Israeli MK, and the fact that al-Asad accepted the 
Israeli pressure and approved the visit. [passage omitted] 
  Ambassador Rabinovich said that the Syrian Government 
agreement to receive the delegation headed by MK Darawshah is of 
certain importance, but it should be viewed in the right 
perspective. "This is one step, but additional and more 
significant steps are needed for us to be able to say that Syria 
is taking steps to project the feeling that it has indeed 
undergone a change of heart with regard to Israel," Rabinovich 
told reporters in Washington. 
  Ambassador Rabinovich added that "it is clear to us that 
al-Asad is not al-Sadat, that he will not follow the latter's 
example, but there is still a giant gap between what Syria could 
do and this step. Inviting Darawshah and receiving the U.S. 
delegation of inspection of the MIA's and POW's issue are 
beginnings; we expect a continuation." Israeli sources said 
that the visit to Damascus by MK Darawshah was raised in the 
meeting of the chief Israeli and Syrian delegates to the 
bilateral negotiations, and that the issue "was handled in a 
practical manner which indicates that the Syrians wish to prove 
that the Washington track is alive and active." 
  In the first week of the current round of the Washington 
talks with the Syrian representatives, Israel asked that a 
discussion be devoted to the time aspect of the negotiations -- 
that is, to the relation between the stages of withdrawal from 
the Golan Heights and the stages of implementing the full peace. 
The Syrian delegate, however, again demanded that the depth of 
the Israeli withdrawal be discussed first. [passage omitted] 
  [A report from Washington by Hayim Shibi on page 4 of Tel 
Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 20 February adds: "Senior 
sources in the Israeli delegation for talks with Syria disclosed 
last weekend that one of the ideas to break the ice in the 
negotiations between Israel and Syria is to have President 'Ezer 
Weizman invited to Damascus to meet Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad."]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said today that he 
does not share the assessment that Egyptian President Mubarak's 
regime is threatened. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports 
that in a meeting with the Labor Knesset caucus, Peres said that 
Mubarak's regime handles fundamentalist violence with political 
wisdom and appropriate force. Peres stressed that signs of 
economic development are clearly visible in Egypt. 
  The foreign minister sharply attacked the Syrian attitude 
toward the peace process. He said that we have a right to 
demand that it raise the level of negotiators to that of heads 
of state or senior ministers. The Syrians must adjust to 
international standards. We will not get far if we continue the 
Syrian way of negotiating. The talks with them are still bogged 
down, Peres said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says the 
negotiations with the Palestinians are close to a conclusion 
within a short time, due to the fact that the Palestinian 
representatives at the negotiations, including 'Arafat, have 
adopted a businesslike attitude. 
  Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that speaking at a 
meeting of the Labor Knesset faction, Peres again emphasized 
that leaving the settlement of Netzarim in place is, in his 
words, unreasonable. He maintained that the two companies the 
Army will have to deploy to ensure the security of Netzarim 
could be better deployed on the Trans-Samaria highway, where 
they will safeguard traffic.

  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has received 
instructions to prepare for an accelerated withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip so that the responsibility for preventing terrorist 
attacks in the area can be swiftly turned over to the 
Palestinians. 
  Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that officials in 
Jerusalem expressed the assessment that the negotiations with 
the Palestinians will be concluded within two weeks.

  [Text] The United States is considering the possibility of 
opening an official representative institution in the Gaza Strip 
after the withdrawal of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops from 
the area. This was reported yesterday to DAVAR by a Gaza Strip 
Palestinian who meets with Americans on a regular basis. 
  U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian toured the Gaza Strip 15 
February and met with local Palestinian leaders. 
Representatives of foreign embassies conduct weekly visits to 
the Gaza Strip. It has not yet been decided whether or not to 
open a consulate, culture center, or some other form of official 
representation; however, the issue is occasionally discussed by 
U.S. diplomats and Palestinian officials. The Americans have 
already told the Palestinians that whatever form the 
representation takes, it will not be established before progress 
is made in implementing the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
  France and the United Kingdom maintain culture centers in 
the 
Gaza Strip. Representatives of various European countries are 
also discussing the possibility of opening legations -- 
consulates, culture centers, or other institutions -- in the 
Gaza Strip with local Palestinian officials.

  [Text] Terrorists last night shot and killed a woman 
resident of the Samaria town of Ari'el. The attack took place 
as she was traveling with her husband and two children near the 
village of Qarawat Bani-Hasan west of Ari'el. Two bursts of 
fire were directed from a stationary vehicle. The woman, whose 
name has not yet been released, was hit in the head. Her 
husband did not stop the car, and rushed to a nearby Army base, 
from where she was evacuated by ambulance to Beilinson Hospital 
in Petah Tiqva. She died soon after. Our reporter says she was 
in the fifth month of pregnancy. 
  At the site of the attack, the casings of Kalashnikov 
bullets 
were found. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has imposed a 
curfew on the area, and a hunt is on for the terrorists.

  [Text] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has claimed 
responsibility for the attack on the trans-Samaria highway, that 
killed Tzipora Sason from Ari'el. Our correspondent Moti Amir 
reports that graffiti sprayed in the Ramallah area said the 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad had perpetrated the attack. 
[Reporting on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0905 on 19 
February, Amir adds that a Hamas leaflet faxed to the radio 
station and signed by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam also claimed 
responsibility for the attack.] 
  Our correspondent further reports that after the attack, the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] detained several men suspected of 
participating in the act or possessing knowledge about the 
perpetrators. 
  Tzipora Sason was shot by two rounds fired from a parked 
vehicle at the car in which she was traveling with her husband 
and two children. She was hit in the head and abdomen, and she 
died of her wounds. 
  Our correspondent notes that Major General Dani Yatom, the 
Central Command commander, and Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, the 
IDF regional commander, are overseeing the investigation on the 
site of the attack. 
  Reacting to the attack, Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu 
said the government should beef up the IDF deployment in the 
area and launch an offensive on terrorists, rather than 
preoccupy itself with withdrawal. 
  Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan told our correspondent Hayim 
Hecht that the IDF should clamp a curfew on all the Arab 
villages along the trans-Samaria highway and maintain it until 
the murderers are apprehended. 
  Moledet leader Knesset Member Rehav'am Ze'evi called on the 
government to provide Jews residing in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza 
with full protection. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0900 GMT on 19 February 
adds 
that reacting to the attack, the YI'UD [Independent and 
Democratic Israel] faction said all Hamas activists suspected of 
terrorist activity should be deported, and a closure should be 
imposed on Arab population centers in the territories."]

  [Excerpts] In the territories last night, an IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] soldier was lightly wounded by terrorist gunfire 
near Rafah in the Gaza Strip. The attack took place near the 
border between Rafah and Egypt, when machine-gun fire was 
directed at an Army jeep patrolling in the area. Army troops 
returned the fire, and two residents of Rafah were injured. 
  Meanwhile, in the center of Hebron, a bomb was set off last 
night on one of the main streets. It exploded but caused no 
injuries or damage. 
  Settlers in the territories are now blocking roads in 
protest 
over the murder of Tzipora Sason, the 30-year old woman from 
Ari'el who was shot by terrorists last Friday night. At the 
site of one of the roadblocks is reporter Mark Weiss: 
  [Begin recording] Groups of settlers at five locations 
throughout the West Bank set up roadblocks at 5 o'clock this 
morning. Coordinated by the YESHA' [Judaea, Samaria, and the 
Gaza Strip] settlers council, the protesters burned tires and 
threatened to turn back Arab vehicles; however, nearly all Arab 
cars turned back before reaching the settlers' roadblocks or, as 
in the past, planned to wait till 7 o'clock before traveling on 
the roads, knowing that the demonstrations end at 7 o'clock. 
[passage omitted] 
  Large numbers of soldiers and police are on hand, but so far 
there have been no confrontations, and the security forces have 
decided not to disperse the settlers and to allow the protests 
to continue. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In many places in Israel 
there were demonstrations yesterday to protest the murder of 
Tzipora Sason. Our military affairs correspondent Karmela 
Menashe reports that the security forces are continuing the 
manhunt in search of the murderers, but so far without any 
results. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will beef up its 
presence in the Trans-Samaria highway and adjacent areas. A 
senior military source told our correspondent that over the last 
few months security presence has been increased along the 
Trans-Samaria highway, but there are dozens of Arab villages on 
both sides of the road, and this makes it hard to prevent 
attacks. 
  Some 25-28 wanted men from the rejectionist front 
organizations and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] are active 
In Judaea and Samaria, as well as three 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam 
squads. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that the Palestinian 
detainees who participated in terror attacks will not be 
released. He emphasized that first the problem of the Israeli 
MIA's must be solved, as well as that of the inhabitants of the 
territories who have aided Israel -- only then will Israel 
discuss the release of the Palestinian detainees. 
  Over the last few days the Palestinian representatives 
negotiating with Israel have said that unless it is ensured that 
all the Palestinian detainees are released, they will not sign 
the full agreement with Israel.

  [Text] Today's cabinet session was held in the shadow of 
Tzipora Sason's murder. Despite the police minister's 
recommendation to tighten the closure in the territories, the 
government took no decisions on this issue. Our political 
correspondent Udi Segal reports from the Prime Minister's Office: 
  [Begin recording] [Segal] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will 
set up his residence in Jericho by the end of May, according to 
Minister Yosi Sarid. Sarid bases this assessment on the 
progress made in the negotiations between Israel and the PLO. 
Sarid added, however, that 'Arafat must reduce the level of 
terrorism, otherwise terrorism will reduce him. 
  In today's cabinet session, the cabinet was briefed about 
the 
grave attack in Ari'el, which the ministers called a shocking 
attack. The prime minister decided not to discuss the issue of 
a closure. Despite the police minister's recommendation to 
tighten the closure, the government took no decisions in this 
issue. This is what Minister Amnon Rubinstein had to say 
following the session: 
  [Rubinstein] The prime minister did not recommend reimposing 
or exacerbating the closure, although the issue is hovering in 
the air. It was said that if the closure is reimposed we have 
to prepare for it properly, a thing we failed to do last time. 
It is also feared that a closure will exacerbate the situation 
in the Gaza Strip. 
  [Segal] Rubinstein said that according to figures submitted 
to the cabinet this morning, 19 Palestinians were murdered by 
other Palestinians during the first two weeks of the month. 
'Arafat will have to deal with this difficult situation.

Dror] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Numerous incidents took place 
yesterday throughout the West Bank, including Hebron, Halhul, 
and Ramallah. In Halhul, residents rioted in protest over the 
16 February killing of a local resident by soldiers. The man, a 
student by the name of Marwan Sa'ada, was 19 years old. Two 
Halhul residents sustained slight injuries yesterday. Army 
sources said the locals threw stones at soldiers, who opened 
fire in response. One of the injured is 19-year-old 'Abid 
Muhammad Sa'id. 
  Palestinian sources said the second casualty, Ayub Milhim, 
was shot in the head by settlers traveling in a car that came 
under a barrage of stones. The two wounded men were transferred 
to the 'Aliya and al-Wahali Hospitals in Hebron. 
  Four locals were wounded -- two in Rafah and two in the 
Jabalyah refugee camp -- in clashes with soldiers in the Gaza 
Strip yesterday. Two soldiers were slightly injured by stones 
in Gaza. They received medical treatment on the spot and were 
sent back to their units. 
  A resident of the al-Mughazi refugee camp in the central 
Strip was murdered yesterday because he was suspected of 
collaboration. The man, 'Abdallah Abad, was abducted from his 
home by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activists. His wife 
was seriously wounded. 
  Military sources have stated that a rise has been noted in 
incidents in the territories inspired by Hamas and the Islamic 
Jihad. The security forces are still in pursuit of the 
terrorist squad that murdered Shin Bet squad operator No'am 
Kohen near Ramallah. 
  Yesterday, the terrorists who murdered No'am Kohen this week 
called on Palestinian collaborators to turn on those who 
recruited them and promised protection and pardon to anyone who 
murders his operator. 
  Declaring a war on the Shin Bet, the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam 
squad pledged to put an end to the phenomenon of Palestinian 
collaboration with Israel. "We will regard every collaborator 
who kills his operator and brings us his weapon and identity 
card as a convert," said a leaflet disseminated by a group 
calling itself the "al-Qassam Psychological Warfare Department." 
  Squad members said they will arm the converted collaborators 
and find them asylum. 
  An approximately 50-year-old resident of Bethlehem was found 
battered and tied up in a cave in Jerusalem yesterday. A 
preliminary investigation revealed that the man had been 
kidnapped from his home by three masked men who accused him of 
collaboration with Israel. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Doha, Feb 19 (AFP) -- Iraq no longer has any weapons 
of mass destruction and is fulfilling Gulf war ceasefire 
conditions set by the United Nations, Iraqi Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Sa'id al- Sahhaf has said. 
  "Iraq is implementing (UN Security Council) Resolution 687 
and no longer has any weapons of mass destruction or the 
capacity to manufacture them," al-Sahhaf said in an interview 
shown on Qatari state television Friday. 
  The resolution set the terms for ending the 1991 Gulf war, 
in 
particular the elimination of all Baghdad's programmes for 
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. 
  UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four 
days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. 
  Al-Sahhaf accused certain members of the Security Council, 
"notably the United States," of prolonging the political and 
economic embargo "for political reasons totally unrelated to the 
(Gulf) crisis." 
  He reiterated Iraq's refusal to export some of its oil under 
UN supervision, in accordance with Resolution 706. 
  "This resolution cannot be applied because it has changed 
from being a humanitarian resolution to a colonialist one." 
  It was the second time a senior Iraqi official had appeared 
on Qatari television since the Gulf crisis. 
  Last Saturday the television screened a report on Iraq's 
economic problems under the UN embargo, and invited Iraqi 
Commerce Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih to speak on the programme. 
  Apart from Oman, Qatar is the only member of the six-nation 
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to have renewed contacts with 
Baghdad since the Gulf war. 
  The other GCC members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United 
Arab Emirates and Bahrain. 
  On Thursday al-Sahhaf told the UN Human Rights Commission in 
Geneva "the lifting of the iniquitous blockade and the injustice 
done to the Iraqi people is a humanitarian responsibility." 
  He urged that the "use of the weapon of economic sanctions 
and the policy of starvation" be abandoned.

  [Text] Geneva, 17 Feb (INA)--Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf has urged the UN Security Council to fulfill its 
obligations and move immediately to lift the economic embargo 
imposed on Iraq. 
  In a speech he delivered at the general session of the 
disarmament conference in Geneva today, al-Sahhaf said: Iraq has 
fulfilled all of its obligations as stipulated in the relevant 
UN Security Council resolutions. The Security Council must, for 
its part, fulfill its obligations that are stipulated in 
Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and lift the economic embargo, 
which it imposed on Iraq and which is no longer justified even 
on the basis of the Security Council resolutions themselves. 
  The foreign minister added that the continuation of the 
unjust blockade on Iraq provides clear evidence that certain 
hegemonistic states wish to impose on the world community their 
own political stands which are not related to the UN Charter, 
the international law, and the principles of justice and 
fairness. 
  The foreign minister urged the disarmament conference to 
work 
for halting the arms race in which some Middle Eastern states 
are engaged. He said Iraq was one of the first states to demand 
that the Middle East be freed from the weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  He noted that Iraq and the other Arab states had warned that 
the Zionist entity possesses large stockpiles of nuclear, 
chemical, and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles 
that can deliver these weapons to targets thousands of 
kilometers away and refuses to sign the nonproliferation treaty. 
  The minister said: Paragraph 14 of UN Security Council 
Resolution 687 stipulates the setting up of a zone free from the 
weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. Three 
years after that resolution was issued, we have not yet seen any 
serious move to implement this paragraph. Instead, we see a 
feverish race by certain Middle Eastern states to acquire arms, 
including major efforts to possess and develop weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  In his speech, the minister wondered about the reasons 
behind 
the zeal shown by certain states to pursue Iraq, threaten it 
with the use of military force, and then actually using brutal, 
military force against it, while at the same turning a blind eye 
to, and even helping others, the Zionist entity for example, 
acquire and develop weapons of mass destruction. 
  He said: Is it not the right, and even the duty, of the 
world community and this conference to ask if security, peace, 
and stability can be achieved through such biased and twisted 
methods and policies. 
  The foreign minister emphasized that Iraq's position on 
chemical weapons was made clear at the Paris Conference of 1989. 
Iraq, he said, asserted its commitment to the Geneva Protocol 
of 1925 and support to the world efforts to halt the armament 
drive. Iraq was one of the first states to sign the 
nonproliferation treaties and agreements. Iraq also emphasized 
that the call for a complete ban on chemical weapons must be 
associated with a call for a complete ban on nuclear weapons. 
  The foreign minister urged the international community to 
deal fairly with the issues of security and stability in the 
Middle East and to abandon double-standards. He also called on 
the Security Council to expeditiously implement Paragraph 14 of 
Resolution 687. 
  He said: We believe that the conference's top priority is to 
take swift measures to guarantee the implementation of Paragraph 
14 of Resolution 687 to turn the Middle East into an area free 
of mass destruction weapons. The conference should not allow 
certain countries, which are known to all, to exploit the 
delicate stage through which the Middle East is passing, to make 
suspicious transient gains which will certainly lead to further 
imbalance, which will undermine security and stability in the 
region, and which will expose the security and interests of the 
people in the region to very sever dangers. 
  The foreign minister added in his speech: The development in 
international relations, during the past decade and at the 
beginning of the present decade, calls on all members of the 
international community to accept that the equal-footing 
participation of all states in developing human common interests 
is necessary. This participation should be based on the 
provisions of the UN Charter, the rules of the international 
law, and on justice. This participation also should be far away 
from double standards and selectivity in implementing these 
provisions and rules; it should be in the service of genuine 
security and stability in the various parts of the world. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf stressed that the achievement of 
this requires the adoption of disarmament arrangements and 
measures on fair and objective bases which guarantee the 
countries' natural rights to security and peace and which 
respect their sovereignty and independence. No country or a 
group of countries should be allowed to make gains or privileges 
at the expense of other countries. 
  Al-Sahhaf said: Proceeding from this understanding, included 
in the final document of the 10th extraordinary session of the 
UN General Assembly, Iraq took part in the disarmament 
conference in 1989 as an observer. On the basis of this 
understanding also, Iraq built its stand which calls for 
expanding the membership of the conference so that it will 
include the countries which have a desire for membership. 
  The minister added: In 1991, a comprehensive aggressive war 
was launched against Iraq. More than half a million soldiers 
from the armed forces of more than 30 countries, including 
superpowers and major countries, took part in this war. They 
used in this war all the conventional and nonconventional 
weapons they have in their arsenals, including some 
internationallybanned weapons. Immediately following the 
cease-fire, difficult -- in fact unique and unprecedented -- 
conditions were imposed on Iraq. 
  In his speech, the foreign minister touched on Resolutions 
687 and 715 issued by the Security Council in 1991. These 
resolutions contain a series of measures to destroy some weapons 
and the material and equipment associated with them as well as 
to lay down a mechanism for continuous monitoring. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf stressed that Iraq has cooperated 
with the UN Special Commission and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] to implement the measures included in 
Resolution 687. 
  He said: After three years of work with the UN Special 
Commission and the IAEA, it has become clear that Iraq has 
implemented the required steps stipulated in Part C of 
Resolution 687. This fact was clearly stated in the reports and 
joint minutes adopted during four sessions of high-level talks 
between Iraq and the IAEA. 
  Addressing the 50 members taking part in a session held by 
the UN Human Rights Commission which began in Geneva today, 
Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said that Iraq's genuine belief in the 
principles of the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights and 
the 1993 Vienna Declaration emanates from its history and 
civilization. He said that respect for and enhancement of human 
rights since they are an essential human reality are taken for 
granted. 
  He added that proceeding from this belief and true 
understanding, Iraq ratified many international charters dealing 
with human rights, the last of which was the ratification of the 
child's rights convention. Iraq is also studying those charters 
that were not ratified. In addition, it is actively and 
effectively participating in conferences and meetings that deal 
with human rights. 
  Al-Sahhaf spoke about the violations of human rights. He 
said that what is actually happening in the world today is that 
human rights are regrettably being used as a political weapon to 
shake the political regimes of states, interfere in their 
internal affairs, and fragment their national unity and cohesion 
just like what is happening in many parts of the world including 
my country, Iraq. 
  He affirmed that as a result of this, the issue of human 
rights has become an issue of interests that is somehow affected 
by the policies of some major powers in our modern world. There 
is no issue that is more controversial in terms of standards and 
selectivity than the issue of human rights. 
  Our evidence is that the UN Human Rights Commission is 
always 
abreast of all the terrible violations of human rights and the 
human international law in Palestine and the occupied Arab 
territories. Many resolutions were issued condemning these 
violations. Moreover, in light of the world community's 
inability to implement these resolutions, Israel continued to 
disregard the basic human rights in these areas and pursued its 
violation of these rights. The world today is witnessing what 
is happening in Yugoslavia while the United Nations is unable to 
find a solution to this tragedy. Without doubt, this is 
attributed to the stands of some major powers which follow the 
policy of selectivity and double standards in their 
international dealing. 
  The foreign minister continued: Through its constitution and 
laws, Iraq sought to establish the state of law by following a 
realistic and practical policy that adopts the requirements of 
establishing a community that is balanced in its economic, 
political, and cultural growth. 
  This balance gave priority to economic, social, cultural, 
and 
scientific infrastructures. This reflected positively on 
building the individual and on the requirements for the growth, 
prosperity, and development of human rights. This was actually 
accomplished by combating illiteracy and making education 
compulsory at all levels and by taking care of the status of 
women, children, and the handicapped. 
  This reflected clearly on all economic, social, and cultural 
rights. It is enough to note here what Prince Sadruddin Aga 
Khan, former executive delegate of the UN secretary general, 
said on 15 July 1991 in his report to the UN secretary general 
when he referred to the background of the situation in Iraq. In 
his report Khan said: As of mid-1990 Iraq, in certain ways, was 
rapidly approaching a level similar to that reached by some 
European countries. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said he regrets the attitude 
demonstrated by certain states toward these Iraqi trends. He 
said: That independent course was received with negative 
reactions from abroad, demonstrated by an unfair campaign of 
accusations and allegations on human rights violations in Iraq. 
The human rights issue was used as a weapon to obstruct Iraq's 
development plans and national programs to build the 
institutions concerned with democracy and human rights. 
However, Iraq's determination to continue with its programs has 
not, and will not weaken. Iraq has adopted several laws and 
measures and made several decisions which emphasize respect for 
the will of the Iraqi individual and his right to a dignified 
life, and which allow him to exercise his basic rights even 
under the hard conditions facing our country. 
  The minister said: It is difficult for human rights to 
flourish during crises and armed conflicts, but their respect is 
enhanced when security, peace, and stability prevail. We began 
to feel this after the end of the war between Iran and Iraq on 8 
August 1988 and until August 1990. During that short period of 
time, discussions started on a draft for a new constitution. 
Also, emergency laws and resolutions issued during the period 
in which Iraq was defending itself against the Iranian 
aggression were reconsidered and several of them were annulled. 
Citizens were allowed to travel abroad and a new phase in 
building a multiparty system was launched. The Party Law and a 
new law guaranteeing the freedom of the press were issued. 
Emergency laws and legislations which Iraq had to use because of 
the war with Iran were annulled. This new reality soon changed, 
and was adversely affected by the comprehensive war launched 
against Iraq on 17 January 1991 in which all types of 
destructive and internationally-banned weapons were used. 
Undoubtedly, the respected members of the human rights 
committee realize that these conditions, which were imposed on 
my country, as well as the unjust economic embargo, have 
produced negative effects on human rights in general. 
  Al-Sahhaf denounced the inhuman attitude of the states that 
seek to blemish Iraq's reputation in the field of human rights. 
He said: Those who call for human rights, accuse the Government 
of Iraq of violating human rights and try to show the world that 
they care for the Iraqi people, have committed the ugliest 
crimes against Iraq before and after the military aggression in 
January 1991. They still insist on continuing their genocide 
crime against our people by insisting on maintaining the 
comprehensive blockade despite the fact that the reasons on 
which these states based their decision to impose the blockade, 
are no longer valid. 
  He added: One of the constant serious effects of the 
blockade, which has affected all segments of the Iraqi society, 
is the deterioration in the food situation to dangerous rates. 
Here, I wish to refer to a report by the UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization, FAO, issued in August 1993 on food 
expectations. I also wish to note the acute shortage in 
medicines and medical needs, especially after the medical 
shipments contracted by the Health Ministry before 2 August 1990 
were halted although their price was paid in advance to the 
supplying companies. Additionally, health institutions, medical 
equipment, and utilities sustained heavy damage in the hostile 
air bombardment. The level of medical care also dropped because 
of the spread of diseases and epidemics, which principally 
affected women and children. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf described the immense damage that 
the people of Iraq have suffered as a result of the continuation 
of this blockade, which has not only harmed the dignity and 
livelihood of the Iraqi people, but also their economic, social, 
cultural, civil, and political rights. He said: The lack of 
stability, high prices, and scarcity of basic food commodities 
and medicines has had terrible consequences despite the 
exhaustive efforts of the Iraqi Government. 
  Al-Sahhaf added: This embargo has seriously affected many 
aspects of the human rights situation on the one hand, and the 
overall development process on the other. For, it is widely 
known that international human rights conventions make it 
incumbent upon world states to cooperate to uphold these rights. 
Meanwhile, what is happening to Iraq as a result of the embargo 
is the outcome of a calculated decision to obstruct the 
government's efforts to honor its national and international 
commitments as enshrined in these conventions. 
  The foreign minister indicated that the continued 
enforcement 
of the economic embargo has not only undermined the 
humanitarian, economic, social, and cultural activities of 
average citizens, but also contributed to the obstruction of the 
national political program of democracy devised by the Iraqi 
Government. 
  The minister recalled that several of these moves pertaining 
to the Constitution, the freedom of press, the multiparty 
system, and other aspects that constitute the main focus of this 
esteemed commission were expected to have been accomplished. 
However, the minister noted, there is a fact that we must 
enlighten you about, namely, that the politicians who 
contemplated launching political parties in accordance with the 
government program have been forced to abandon their plans by 
the harsh circumstances imposed by the embargo. This is because 
their main concern right now is the harsh living conditions and 
health situation to which their families are being subjected. 
Consequently, the lifting of the economic embargo that has been 
clamped on the Iraqi people will be instrumental in the rapid 
consummation of the moves the Iraqi Government has made in the 
area of human rights, al-Sahhaf maintained. 
  The foreign minister held the international community in 
general responsible for redressing the Iraqi people's 
sufferings, saying: Lifting the unfair embargo imposed on the 
Iraqi people and ending the injustice meted out against them is 
a humanitarian responsibility that must be shouldered by all, 
including the UN Human Rights Commission. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf urged the UN Human Rights 
Commission 
to endorse a policy banning the use of economic embargoes and 
starvation, because this blatantly contravenes the most basic 
human rights principles and rules the Human Rights Commission 
upholds. 
  The foreign minister said he hopes the commission will adopt 
a stand that calls for lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq, 
because such a stand would be in line with its humanitarian 
approach and the rules of the humane international law.

  [Text] The regime of tyrant Saddam Husayn has strengthened 
its relations with the Serbian regime in former Yugoslavia. At 
the invitation of 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, the Iraqi regime's 
defense minister, a team of Serbian military experts recently 
arrived in Baghdad to exchange information and discuss the 
results of air raids against Iraq during the Gulf war. A 
Bosnian military source said the military and political 
similarity between the two regimes pushed them toward 
rapprochement and coordination.

  [Text] Reliable reports from Baghdad yesterday said that 
gradually and cautiously evolving developments threaten a 
suicidal popular uprising to be led this time by hungry Iraqis 
who, thanks to soaring prices of essential commodities and an 
all-time low Iraqi dinar, find it hard to survive. The reports 
said the Iraqi people are effectively on the threshold of a 
mammoth revolution to express their anger with the unjust 
regime, which is primarily responsible for the people's bitter 
suffering today. 
  The reports said a state of extreme tension and anxiety 
prevail in the streets of Baghdad and the governorates in 
anticipation of possible developments in the next few days if 
the economic deterioration and collapse continue and hunger, 
want, and destitution affecting the overwhelming majority of 
citizens sharpen.

<F P=106> [Report by Latif al-Tayyib] </F>
  [Text] The Interior Ministry emphasized that some Arab and 
foreign quarters are involved in smuggling sheep and certain 
items of state property out of Iraq. 
  Staff General 'Abd-al-Jawad Dhanun, the ministry's senior 
undersecretary, said that specialized authorities in the Iraqi 
border posts caught large numbers of sheep set to be smuggled 
abroad. He said the sheep are smuggled to Jordan first as a 
transit point, and then are smuggled to the agent Saudi regime, 
which is trying, through various means, to undermine the Iraqi 
economy. The second destination of smuggling is the Autonomous 
Region. 
  He added that a number of criminals steal state property and 
private vehicles, in collusion with the Iranian regime, which 
hates the Iraqi people, to smuggle the property and vehicles to 
Iran through various channels. 
  He said that, through their sabotage actions, the Saudi and 
Iranian regimes have proven once again their direct involvement 
in the imperialist-Zionist scheme led by the United States and 
Zionism with the aim of undermining Iraq's capabilities and 
weakening its steadfastness in face of the unjust siege imposed 
on our steadfast people. These two regimes want to increase the 
suffering of the people of Iraq. 
  He added that the Saudi agent regime concentrates on female 
sheep in a dirty attempt to reduce the number of these animals, 
which are important to Iraq's national economy. This scheme has 
increased the meat prices in all governorates despite the fact 
that the Interior Ministry allows the movement of sheep between 
governorates, except these near the borders, in order to secure 
red meat. The free movement of sheep is also designed to help 
secure a balance in the availability of meat in all governorates 
in accordance with their population, and with special emphasis 
on Baghdad Governorate because a huge number of people live in 
the capital in comparison with other governorates.

  [Text] The U.S.-Japanese summit has ended in failure. The 
waffler Clinton could not force the Japanese prime minister to 
accept firmer restrictions on Japanese trade, such as giving 
more facilities for the entry of U.S. products into Japan. 
  Japan's rejection stems from the essence of U.S. policy and 
logic and the market economy laws. Market economy, in the U.S. 
book, means several things, primarily free prices, which are 
determined by the market's supply and demand. However, the 
United States, as a result of the decline in its industry and 
economy, cannot compete with Japan by using democratic means. 
Therefore, the only way to stop the Japanese march on U.S. 
markets is to use force. 
  The United States has said it will impose sanctions on Japan 
because Japan did not restrict its trade and set limits to the 
free flow of goods. This position highlights two facts: The 
United States adheres to the market economy when this enables it 
to sneak into other countries, sabotage their economy, and 
control them. The United States, however, rejects the market 
economy when the other party is a stronger competitor, like 
Japan. Thus, the United States has clearly deviated from its 
capitalist economic system. 
  The other fact is that those who are called U.S. allies are, 
in reality, not allies but satellites. This is because an ally 
enjoys independence and equal opportunities and rights. 
However, if this ally accepts what is unacceptable to it under 
normal circumstances, then it is a satellite and not an ally. 
The world is now taking interest in these two facts, especially 
those who are described as America's allies. Those people have 
started to realize clearly that the United States wants to turn 
them into slaves who carry out orders. Is it time for another 
Spartacus to appear and lead an uprising of the slaves of the 
major world powers?

<F P=106> [Address by President Shankar Dayal Sharma at the Central </F>
Hall of Parliament in New Delhi -- live] 
  [Text] Honorable members: Welcome to this session of 
parliament. As I address you in this new year, I sense that the 
country is today in a different frame of mind from the one last 
year. We faced many difficulties at the beginning of 1993, but 
our people displayed tremendous resilience as the year 
progressed, and 1993 certainly ended on a note of optimism. 
There was steady progress on all fronts, as evident from the 
improved law and order situation; record food grain production; 
unprecedented levels of procurement; very high levels of food 
grain stocks; containment of the rate of inflation to the single 
digits; comfortable foreign exchange reserves; considerable 
reduction in the trade gap; increase in exports; improved 
performance in certain essential areas of the infrastructure 
sector; and increased flow of foreign investment, both direct 
and portfolio. All of this has symbolized and justified this 
emerging optimism. Clearly, we have regained our internal 
energy and our global confidence. We have reason and 
justification to be encouraged by our all-around performance. 
  We, however, still must work a great deal to achieve the 
targets set for our socioeconomic progress. On the basis of 
this hope, the government is moving toward its objectives in the 
year 1994. There has been a distinct improvement in the law and 
order situation. The rebellious situation in the northeast is 
under control. The successes achieved in Punjab last year have 
been further strengthened. The elections in the country's five 
states and the national capital area were conducted peacefully. 
The government is determined to maintain the success of these 
improvements and is trying to initiate this process in the 
remaining significant sectors. 
  Around this time last year, the Ayodhya issue had cast its 
long shadow on the national scene. There was a great deal of 
concern among the people about the possible fallout of the 
demolition and the riots that followed. Thanks to the inherent 
wisdom and sagacity of the Indian people, the grim predictions 
that were being made have been proven wrong. The atmosphere has 
improved considerably, and we can hope for a lasting solution to 
the dispute. Proceedings are continuing in the Supreme Court on 
the reference made to this case under the Constitution. The 
government will take appropriate measures in light of the 
Supreme Court's opinion. The Ayodhya issue is the most 
convincing demonstration in recent times of the danger inherent 
in mixing communalism and politics. It is of utmost importance 
to correct this aberration and keep both religion and politics 
in their legitimate domains. Our secular state demands nothing 
less. The need is to consider the matter fully and take 
effective steps to settle it. The government would welcome 
proposals in this connection. 
  In Jammu and Kashmir, we are pursuing a policy of taking 
firm 
action against terrorism. This year, the police and security 
forces have scored considerable achievements in their 
antiterrorism operations. Steps have been taken to improve 
their competence. All efforts are being taken to ensure that 
the maximum restraint is exercised while using force. The local 
administration and the security forces in cooperation with the 
people commendably solved the grave crisis at the Hazratbal 
shrine. The settlement of this crisis reflects the government's 
attitude of restraint. Whenever it is felt that excessive force 
has been used during any particular incident, an immediate 
enquiry is ordered and action taken. The operation against 
terrorists will continue with a view to restoring law and order. 
At the same time, appropriate measures are being taken to tone 
up the administration; development and economic activities have 
been intensified to generate employment opportunities; and the 
mechanism to redress grievances has been strengthened. We are 
deeply concerned about the difficulties of the common people. 
We are also pursuing steps to bring about effective involvement 
by the people in dealing with matters that concern us. Jammu and 
Kashmir is an inalienable part of India and we will foil all 
attempts from across the border or from any other side to create 
instability. 
  In the northeast, the setting up of the interim Bodoland 
Autonomous Council in pursuit of the Bodo accord marks a 
positive step toward meeting the aspirations of the tribal 
population. The Assam Government took prompt action in 
Kokharajar and Bongaigaon Districts when there was an outbreak 
of violence against non-tribals. In Manipur, the government 
took action under Article 356 of the Constitution in the wake of 
violence between Nagas and Kukis and the general disruption of 
law and order. This demonstrates the government's ability to 
deal sternly with disruptive elements. 
  The National Human Rights Commission has been set up with 
the 
former chief justice of India as its chairman. Commission 
members include a former judge of the Supreme Court and a former 
chief justice of the high court. The constitution of the 
commission reflects that we are firmly committed to taking 
immediate and clear action on the human rights issue. The 
commission has started its work in earnest. 
  In order to strengthen the executive's accountability to 
parliament, 17 department related standing committees of 
parliament were established in April 1993 to make detailed 
examinations of legislation, demands for grants, annual reports 
of ministries, and national basic long-term policies presented 
to the house. This will greatly facilitate parliament's work. 
  The country had its share of natural calamities. The scale 
of damage in the Maharashtra earthquake stands out among these. 
In every instance, the government responded with commendable 
alertness and provided prompt relief. The governments of 
several other countries, the World Bank, and other institutions 
promptly offered assistance, and we are grateful to all of them. 
A massive reconstruction program in the earthquake affected 
areas of Maharashtra is being taken up with an outlay of 10 
billion rupees. Nongovernmental organizations are being involved 
with the reconstruction program as appropriate. 
  The economic reforms introduced in 1991 gained momentum last 
year, and have been consistently pursued. Still, much more 
needs to be done. The government is aware that reform is an 
irreversible and continuous process that must be implemented 
with determination and foresight, keeping the responses and 
circumstances in the country constantly in view. As a result of 
this approach, the progress in implementation has been steady, 
firm, and based on general consensus. We will hasten this 
process with care. Based on the performance and prospects of 
the public and private sectors, the areas reserved for the 
public sector have been trimmed. More industries have been 
delicensed. The new export-import policy announced on 31 March 
1993 is an attempt to streamline procedures and liberalize 
exports in agriculture and services, where the country has a 
competitive advantage. The 1993-94 budget provided fiscal 
incentives for investment in priority areas. In drawing up the 
reform package, the government stressed reform in the financial 
sector. Financial institutions need to be restructured and 
strengthened to enable them to take on the new responsibilities 
imposed by expanded activity in the private sector. The 
unification of the exchange rate and the floating of the rupee 
in March 1993 were important policy changes. The fact that the 
rupee has remained steady since it was floated is testimony to 
the government's good judgment in the matter. 
  The basic economic indicators show that, although the year 
began in a difficult environment, the performance of the economy 
during 1993-94 has been satisfactory. In 1992-93, the gross 
domestic product is estimated to have grown by 4 percent. In 
1993-94, the government expects the growth rate to remain at 
about the same level. The inflation rate dropped below 6 
percent for a short period during this year, and the highest 
level was 8.4 percent. 
  Global investors have shown growing confidence in the Indian 
market. Direct foreign exchange investment approved since the 
introduction of the new industrial policy was approximately 130 
billion rupees in terms of equity by the end of 1993. Total 
investment in these projects is estimated to be on the order of 
650 billion rupees. The significant point about these 
investments is that the bulk have been proposed in sectors such 
as power, oil refining, food processing, the metallurgical 
industry, electrical equipment, chemicals, electronics, and 
other priority areas. Only 7 percent of the proposed 
investments will be in products that can be categorized as 
consumer goods. The investment inflow will be spread over a 
period of three to four years, which is the gestation period for 
the megaprojects. 
  The government continues to place a great deal of emphasis 
on 
export promotion. The resulting changes in trade policy, 
coupled with the floating of the exchange rate and the general 
liberalization of the economy, have yielded results. Exports 
have shown good growth, recording an increase of around 20 
percent in dollar terms between April and December 1993, 
compared to a little over 3 percent in the corresponding period 
of 1992. 
  The government attaches the highest priority to the 
development of agriculture. The timely provision of adequate 
inputs and the creation of a structure that provides for the 
timely announcement of prices -- which in turn promote higher 
production to meet the domestic needs of the country fully and 
provide for exports -- are the major objectives of the 
government. In keeping with the overall strategy the plan 
outlay for the Department of Agriculture and Cooperatives has 
been raised by 26.6 percent from 10.5 billion rupees in 1992-93 
to 13.3 billion rupees in 1993-94. The production of foodgrains 
during the 1992-93 period was 180 million tons, which was more 
than 1991-92 production by 7.1 percent. Food grain production 
for the fall of 1993-94 is expected to be 99 million tons, and 
the prospects for the spring are excellent. 
  The government is encouraging the diversification of the 
agriculture sector by emphasizing horticulture, aquaculture, oil 
seeds, pulses, and other commodities that have export potential. 
This will be done without detriment to the interests of our own 
consumers. Steps are being taken to revitalize the rural 
cooperative credit system as well as marketing, processing, and 
other services essential to farmers, especially in remote areas. 
Extension services will be broadbased, keeping the new 
priorities in agriculture in view, including greater involvement 
by the voluntary organizations. As a measure to reduce the 
poverty level, our agricultural strategy will aim at increasing 
agricultural production in the rain-fed areas through an 
integrated strategy of soil and water conservation, the 
increased use of agricultural inputs such as organics and 
biofertilizers, and improved technology. 
  During the eighth plan period, 11 billion rupees have been 
allocated for the restructured National Watershed Development 
Project for rain-fed areas. About 3 million hectares of land 
will be treated for sustainable production of food, fodder, 
fuel, and fiber through dry-land farming technology. The 
household production system will diversify as a consequence, and 
ultimately the income level and employment opportunities of the 
watershed community will improve. The project will also enhance 
the availability of ground water, which will consequently 
prevent drought in the project area. A total of 250,000 micro 
watersheds have been identified for development in rain-fed 
areas, and work has started on them. 
  The capacity to manufacture nitrogenous fertilizers has been 
increased, and more is being planned. Because the availability 
of raw materials required for further production is limited 
within the country, efforts are being made to set up joint 
ventures abroad, particularly in the Gulf and West Asia. The 
government will continue to take all measures required to bring 
about a balanced application of soil nutrients so that 
production levels are sustained. 
  As part of the agricultural policy, states have been advised 
to remove all intra- and interstate restrictions on the movement 
of food grains. The government's commitment to safeguard the 
interests of the consumer remains as strong as ever. The 
central issue price for the revamped public distribution system 
areas remains as much as 500 rupees less per metric tonne than 
prices in the general public distribution system, thus 
increasing affordability for the poor. At the inception of the 
scheme in 1992, it was expected that 10,580 new fair price shops 
would be opened in the revamped public distribution system areas 
to strengthen the delivery system. Compared to this, 11,681 new 
fair price shops have been opened in this area, exceeding the 
target. New warehousing space of 181,296 tonnes has been also 
created or rented since the inception of the scheme. A midterm 
review of the revamped public distribution system has revealed 
that nearly 1.5 million metric tonnes of additional food grains 
have been provided to rural areas compared to what used to be 
provided before the inception of the scheme, thus adding a new 
rural dimension to the public distribution system. With record 
food stocks of 22 million tonnes in the central pool grids on 1 
January 1994 -- resulting from stepped up procurement efforts -- 
the government is comfortably placed to augment coverage further 
in this area should it become necessary. 
  The government is determined that no section of the 
population -- regardless of whether it is women, children, 
minorities, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, or backward 
classes -- should remain outside the mainstream of development. 
In all areas of development of the poor, resource allocations 
were enhanced during 1993-94 compared to the previous year. The 
revised outlay for the Ministry of Rural Development increased 
by 56 percent, while the planned outlay for the Welfare Ministry 
was raised from 8.8 billion rupees to 9.8 billion. 
  The Jawahar Rozgar Yojana employment scheme has been 
strengthened in the 120 most backward districts. Subsidies 
under the Integrated Rural Development Program were enhanced by 
1,000 rupees per household. The program of providing improved 
tool kits for rural artisans, started in 1992-93, was extended 
to 100 more districts in 1993-94, thus covering all 162 
districts in the country and benefiting 230,000 rural artisans. 
  Comprehensive programs for the welfare and development of 
weavers have been evolved. They include housing, work sheds, 
handloom development centers, quality dying units, training, 
improved practices, and provision of working capital. These 
programs -- with a total outlay of 10.372 billion rupees -- 
started during the year. The scheme for handloom development 
centers and quality dying units, launched toward the end of 
1993, seeks to merge and expand existing units and establish new 
ones. Against the 1993 target of 120 centers and 20 units, 213 
centers and 94 units have been approved; 25 centers and 25 units 
have already started operating. 
  The government has formulated three new and innovative 
schemes to benefit the poor, particularly rural women, and urban 
youth. 
  The employment assurance scheme, introduced in 1,752 of the 
most backward and remote blocks of the country, where 170 
million of India's poor live, will provide rural laborers with 
assured wage employment for 100 days during the lean 
agricultural season. The scheme will continue to make 
employment opportunities available to village people at a fuller 
level. 
  The women's empowerment scheme will strengthen the position 
of rural women by enabling them to gain and exercise control 
over their earnings and household resources. Already, more than 
400,000 women have opened accounts under this scheme in rural 
post offices. This scheme, along with the National Women's 
Fund, will greatly enhance self-employment opportunities for 
rural women. 
  An employment scheme has been launched to provide sustained 
employment in micro enterprises to educated urban youths. About 
195,000 applications have been received so far from youth in 
different states. So far, 41,275 applications have been 
processed and recommended to banks; about 2,000 have been 
approved. During the current year, the scheme will cover 40,000 
beneficiaries. From 1994-95 onward, it is intended to cover 
220,000 beneficiaries per year, thus covering a total of 700,000 
beneficiaries over the remainder of the eighth plan period. The 
Reserve Bank of India has been instructed to support the program 
fully. The scheme provides for a 22.5 percent reservation for 
scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and 27 percent for other 
backward classes, with preference given to women. 
  A significant role has been envisaged in all of these 
programs for nongovernmental organizations to generate awareness 
and promote effective implementation. To monitor progress in 
the implementation of the programs for weaker sections, and to 
provide the direction and thrust required, the prime minister 
has set up a special cell in the prime minister's office. This 
special cell will receive feedback from the responsible 
departments as well as information based on field visits and 
independent evaluations, in order to remove all possible 
bottlenecks from the programs. A special committee of 
secretaries responsible for the implementation of these three 
programs has also been set up to supervise the coordinated 
implementation of these programs in the field. 
  Communications facilities will be further extended in rural 
areas. In 1993-94, 46,800 village councils will be connected by 
telephone. It is proposed that public telephones be provided to 
72,000 villages during 1994-95. In the schemes for the welfare 
of scheduled castes, special central assistance allocations for 
the special component plan were augmented in 1993, and their 
scope was expanded to include schemes for infrastructure 
development in areas with 50 percent or more of the population 
coming from scheduled castes. An important landmark during the 
year was the passage of the National Commission for Safai 
Karamcharis [Sanitation Workers] Act, which will assist in the 
rapid implementation of the liberation and rehabilitation of 
safai karamcharis. The National Commission is being constituted. 
  The government is fully alert to the situation arising out 
from the atrocities against the scheduled castes in certain 
parts of the country. Protection for the scheduled castes under 
the law as well as the effective implementation of programs for 
socioeconomic development meant for them will be ensured. 
During 1992-93, nearly 2.1 million scheduled caste families and 
800,000 scheduled tribe families were assisted in crossing the 
poverty line by the 20-point program. During 1993-94, the total 
number of assisted families is likely to rise to 2.7 million 
scheduled caste families and 900,000 scheduled tribe families. 
A scheme of educational complexes in areas where tribal female 
literacy is very low was initiated during the year. Thirteen 
such complexes have been sanctioned so far. The turnover of the 
Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India 
rose from 220 million rupees in 1991 to 860 million rupees in 
1992-93. This is expected to be much higher this year. 
  The National Backward Classes Finance and Development 
Corporation has made significant advances this year. During 
1993, it sanctioned loans worth 800 million rupees, and it 
proposes to double its operations in the coming year. The long 
awaited reservation of vacancies for other backward classes in 
Indian Government services became a reality on 8 September 1993, 
when the present government issued orders for a 27 percent 
reservation for the backward classes. With this, one of the 
most important aspirations of the other backward classes in the 
country was met. Work relating to the publication of the works 
of Babasaheb Ambedkar in regional languages was taken forward, 
and two volumes each were brought out in Hindi, Tamil, and 
Gujarati. The work in other languages is proceeding well. 
Eight chairs have been sanctioned in different universities to 
undertake research on Babasaheb's philosophy. 
  The new Islamic Endowment Bill 1993 was introduced in 
Parliament in August 1993, replacing the existing Islamic 
Endowment Act 1954 and Islamic Endowment Amendment Act 1984. 
This will, among other things, provide for the more democratic 
composition of the Islamic Endowment Board, for the Islamic 
Endowment Tribunal to decide issues relating to Islamic 
endowment matters, and for better protection and management of 
Islamic endowment property. A National Minorities Finance and 
Development Corporation will become operational this year, with 
an authorized share capital of 5 billion rupees for promoting 
the economic development of minorities. The modalities are 
being worked out. 
  In my last address to you, I referred to the review of the 
1986 national policy on education undertaken in 1992 and the 
modifications effected in that policy. The government continues 
to give very high priority to literacy and primary education 
based on innovative strategies for a total literacy campaign 
backed by a post-literacy campaign and a new district specific 
and community- oriented approach to primary education. All 18 
districts in Kerala and Pondicherry have achieved total 
literacy. In the 32 districts that have already successfully 
concluded the total literacy campaign, post-literacy campaigns 
have been launched to ensure that the newly-literate do not 
lapse into illiteracy. At present, 238 total literacy campaigns 
are underway in 258 districts. The new district primary 
education program emphasizes participatory planning and 
management and focuses on the education of girls. It seeks to 
enhance the full effectiveness of the schools through inputs in 
teacher training and decentralized management. India played 
host to the Education for All summit of the world's nine highest 
population countries. Our commitment -- as well as that of the 
international community -- to achieving education for all by the 
turn of the century was reaffirmed there. On this occasion, the 
prime minister announced the government's decision to raise the 
outlay for education to 6 percent of gross domestic product by 
the turn of the century. This will be kept in view while 
formulating the ninth five-year plan. Besides this, the 
government aims to achieve the objective of education for all 
through segregated target setting and decentralized management. 
  Because of the sustained efforts of the Indian Government 
and 
the state governments in implementing the national family 
planning program, the annual population growth rate is 
declining. The annual average exponential rate of growth in 
1981-91 was 2.14. The annual rate of increase decreased to 1.9 
percent in 1992. 
  The crude birth rate, which was 41.7 per 1,000 from 
1951-61, decreased to 29 per 1,000 in 1992. The crude death 
rate, which was 22.8 from 1951-61, decreased to 10 in 1992. The 
total fertility rate, which was 5.97 from 1951-61, decreased to 
3.6 in 1991. The infant mortality rate for the country as a 
whole has decreased from 146 per 1,000 live births from 1961-79 
to 71 in 1992. While these are significant achievements, the 
increase in population is still staggering. The government 
attaches the highest importance to reducing the population 
growth rate. There is a national consensus to promote family 
welfare. For this, multidimensional and multisectoral efforts 
involving state governments, opinion leaders, nongovernmental 
organizations, and all sections of society are essential. All 
political parties must unanimously exhort the people to adopt 
the small family norms and transform the family program into a 
mass movement. The National Development Council [NDC] has 
endorsed the recommendation of the Committee on Population it 
set up earlier. The NDC also decided to hold wider 
consultations with the chief ministers and opinion makers on the 
future course of action needed to implement the NDC's 
recommendations. This will be done shortly. 
  We are fully aware of the links between the development 
process and protection of the environment. The need for the 
conservation and wise use of natural resources is reflected in 
our major river cleaning and pollution abatement programs, as 
well as in our forest and wildlife policies. While 
participating in the continuing international debate on 
biodiversity, climate change, and increasing desertification, we 
have kept in focus the basic issues -- raised at the 1992 Rio 
summit -- of access to resources and technology. Within the 
government, our development efforts will take full note of all 
our environmental concerns. 
  The space program has made a steady progress. We had a 
failure in the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle's flight, but this 
has been put to good use. The data collected has been analyzed 
and has proven the effectiveness of the complex systems 
involved. The next flight of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle 
is planned for August or September 1994. There has also been 
progress in the development of the Indian geosynchronous 
satellite launch vehicle which will enable the launch of INSAT 
class satellites in coming few years. The successful launch and 
commissioning of INSAT-2B last year -- within a year of 
commissioning INSAT-2A -- is a demonstration of our 
capabilities. The INSAT-2B has enabled Doordarshan [Indian 
television] to augment its services with five satellite 
channels. This has strengthened the programs broadcast by 
Doordarshan in regional languages. 
  India has a strong and large scientific and industrial 
infrastructure. It also has demonstrated its capability in 
several high technology fields. In this context, I am sure, the 
honorable members will join me in applauding the successful 
demonstration of high technology in the launch of the Agni 
missile last Saturday. [applause] 
  The pace of technological changes and the need to shift to 
technologies that are environmentally compatible imposes various 
demands on us. Restrictions placed on the transfer of 
technology require us to rely more on our own talents. The 
government is committed to encourage this to happen by tapping 
the great potential that the country possesses. 
  In the context of the emerging economic scenario, the 
benefits of research will be harnessed for use by our 
industries. A boost will be given to exports of high technology 
products. The thrust will be on information technology and 
genetic engineering and biotechnology. Priority will also be 
given to advanced materials and devices for use of solar and 
other nonconventional energy sources. 
  Our Armed Forces maintain their constant vigil on our 
borders to safeguard our country's territorial integrity. The 
nation is proud of them and of the defense scientists and 
engineers who have contributed commendably to our defense 
preparedness. Progress in the indigenous development of arms and 
ammunition and the diversification of defense production units 
is proceeding fast. In addition to their normal duties, the 
Armed Forces have been assisting civil authorities in 
maintaining law and order whenever required and in 
counter-insurgency operations. They have also been helping in 
rescue and relief operations in times of natural disaster. 
Their performance in these areas has been exemplary. The 
government remains committed to providing better facilities and 
conditions for serving and retired Armed Forces personnel. 
Those posted in field areas have recently been granted higher 
allowances. It has been decided to extend the benefit of the 
onetime pension increase scheme to an additional 200,000 
pensioners. 
  As a result of sustained international marketing, the 
government has succeeded in instilling confidence among the 
international community that India is one of the safest tourism 
destinations in the world. This resulted in all time records 
for tourist arrivals in December 1993 and January 1994, 
registering increases of 23.8 percent and 28.4 percent, 
respectively, over the same months in 1992-93. 
  The government's foreign policy over the past year focused 
on 
securing our economic interests in our relations with countries 
abroad while continuing to promote our political and security 
interests. The significance of our economic reforms was 
effectively conveyed abroad. Our relations with our neighbors 
remained cordial, and our interaction with Bangladesh, Bhutan, 
the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in various fields recorded 
good progress during the year. 
  In the case of Pakistan, however, its support for terrorism 
and subversion in Jammu and Kashmir and anti-Indian activities 
worldwide seriously hampered our efforts at normalizing 
relations. The prime minister offered Pakistan a dialogue aimed 
at establishing good neighborly relations as envisaged in the 
Simla agreement. Bilateral talks have since taken place, but 
the stridency of Pakistan's anti-Indian statements have grown, 
thus adversely affecting efforts at improving bilateral ties. 
There are no quarrels between us and the people of Pakistan. 
We feel that for good relations between our countries, the 
Government of Pakistan should give up its negative approach and 
cooperate with us to normalize India-Pakistan relations in 
accordance with the Simla agreement. 
  Our relations with China have improved markedly. The prime 
minister's visit to China in September 1993 and the signing of 
the agreement on maintaining peace and tranquility along the 
line of actual control have broadened these relations to a new 
stage of development. The expert group set up under this 
agreement held its first meeting recently, reflecting the desire 
of both sides to maintain and continue interaction on this 
complex issue. 
  India values the South Asian Association for Regional 
Cooperation [SAARC] as an instrument of regional cooperation 
consistent with the objectives of its charter. The prime 
minister attended the SAARC summit in Dhaka last year. SAARC 
has recorded progress in dealing with certain important issues 
of common interest, such as poverty, terrorism, population 
growth, problems related to the status of women, children, 
youth, and drugs and psychotropic substances. We continue to 
play an active role in SAARC with a view to promoting 
socioeconomic and other objectives in accordance with the SAARC 
charter. 
  We have traditional ties with the United States in a number 
of areas, from education and science and technology to culture 
and sports. We have also cooperated with the United Nations on 
issues relating to disarmament, such as the Comprehensive Test 
Ban Treaty. The response from the United States to our economic 
liberalization policy has been positive and U.S. investments in 
India over the past two years were very substantial. We look 
forward to working with the United States toward mutual 
understanding on those issues which need enhancing as this will 
reflect the vibrant, democratic, and secular ideals of our two 
countries. 
  Relations with the Russian Federation continued with mutual 
understanding and cooperation based on the rich traditions of 
our past friendship. Despite certain difficulties the two 
countries face, both sides sought to promote cooperation in the 
political, economic, commercial, and other fields. The goodwill 
and understanding that underpin our relations reinforce our 
joint efforts and help to identify possibilities for further 
cooperation in various fields in today's changing context. 
  Special attention has been given to strengthening relations 
with the Central Asian region. The prime minister paid a very 
successful visit to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in 1993. The 
Uzbek and Kazakh presidents also visited India during the past 
year. A number of accords have been signed between India and 
these two countries in fields ranging from political cooperation 
and science and technology cooperation to trade, civil aviation, 
and culture. 
  A concerted effort was made to forge a new era of closer 
cooperation with ASEAN and the East Asian countries. New 
economic links were established and trade was increased. The 
commencement of a sectoral dialogue between India and ASEAN was 
a notable development. The prime minister's visit to Thailand 
in April 1993 gave a new impetus to Indo-Thai relations. 
India-Singapore relations were qualitatively upgraded, and 
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore visited India as the 
guest of honor at our Republic Day celebrations in January this 
year. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed of Malaysia and President 
Suharto of Indonesia also visited India in December 1993. Our 
ties with Vietnam were reinforced with the vice president's 
visit to Vietnam in September 1993. The government continued to 
make sustained efforts to enhance economic and other links with 
Japan. The prime minister's visit to the Republic of Korea in 
September 1993 with a view to lending further momentum to 
bilateral and economic ties with that country received a 
positive response. 
  Our traditionally cordial relations with the Gulf countries 
are now marked by increasing economic interaction. Our prime 
minister's visit to Oman and Iran in September 1993 laid the 
foundation for an expanding relationship in the name of mutual 
economic benefit. 
  We welcomed the signing of the declaration of principles on 
interim self-government arrangements between Israel and PLO in 
September 1993 as a notable step toward peace and stability in 
West Asia and the restoration of the legitimate rights of the 
Palestinian people. 
  The importance that India and the European Union attach to 
further developing mutually beneficial relations in diverse 
fields was symbolized by the cooperation agreement on 
partnership and development concluded on 20 December 1993 and 
the Indo-EU joint statement of political dialogue. High-level 
dignitaries who visited India from Europe during the past year 
included the president of Ireland, the king of Sweden, and the 
prime minister of the Netherlands. The prime minister recently 
paid a very successful visit to Davos, Switzerland and Germany. 
In Davos, the prime minister addressed a worldwide audience of 
industrialists, political leaders, and academics. As a result, 
appreciation of India's policy and potential has grown. The 
visit to Germany has given further impetus to bilateral ties and 
has strengthened economic cooperation. The state visits I made 
to Ukraine, Turkey, and Hungary in July 1993 were a 
manifestation of our desire to consolidate our cooperative ties 
with these countries. These visits were the first by an Indian 
president to these countries. 
  During the year, we had interaction with the countries of 
the 
Sub-Saharan region, including visits by presidents or prime 
ministers of Burkina Faso, Mauritius, Tanzania, Zambia, and 
Zimbabwe. We have noted the positive developments in South 
Africa, and look forward to the early establishment of majority 
rule there. 
  India continues to play an active role in shaping the global 
agenda on issues pertaining to political and security patterns, 
economic and social developments, human rights, environment, and 
population in the various meetings of the United Nations, the 
Nonaligned Movement, and other international bodies. On these 
issues we have taken the lead in articulating the specific 
concerns of the developing countries with a view to promoting a 
global consensus. 
  The year 1993 was used to consolidate the gains of economic 
reform and the political initiatives of the government. We 
entered 1994 with the optimism of accelerating our pace of 
economic growth, strengthened by the reassuring verdict of the 
people in favor of reforms and against the forces of communalism. 
  I am confident your debates and deliberations in the course 
of this session and beyond will take the nation forward to 
fulfill the aspirations of the people. I commend you in your 
task and wish you all success. Hail India!
