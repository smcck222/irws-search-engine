  [Text] Parliament today unanimously condemned Pakistan's 
continuing support to terrorism and subversion in Jammu and 
Kashmir. In an identical resolution passed in both the houses, 
it said attempts from any quarter to interfere in the internal 
affairs of India will be met resolutely. The resolution 
declared that India has the will and capacity to firmly counter 
all designs against its unity, sovereignty, and territorial 
integrity. 
  Reiterating that Jammu and Kashmir is and shall be an 
integral part of India, the resolution said attempts to separate 
the state from the rest of the country will be resisted by India 
with all necessary means. The resolution demanded Pakistan to 
vacate the occupied areas of Jammu and Kashmir. 
  Noting with deep concern Pakistan's role in training 
terrorists and supply of weapons and funds to them, it said 
Islamabad's sole purpose is to create disorder, disharmony, and 
subversion in the valley. It called upon Pakistan to stop 
forthwith its support to terrorism which is in violation of the 
Simla Agreement. It said this is the root cause of tension 
between the two countries. 
  Describing Pakistan's anti-India campaign as unacceptable 
calumny and falsehood, the resolution expressed deep concern 
over the highly provocative statement from Pakistan and said it 
will only vitiate the atmosphere. 
  The resolution was moved by the speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil, 
in the Lok Sabha, and the chairman, Mr. K.R. Narayanan, in the 
Rajya Sabha.

<F P=106> [Commentary by reporter Anjan Roy] </F>
  [Text] You can hardly open a day's newspaper without coming 
to some report or other of proposals for investment in India 
from overseas corporations. There are reports of the largest 
and most prestigious transnational corporations proposing to 
invest in India. There are reports also of smaller firms coming 
forward with project proposals. The fact of the matter is that 
international investors are now thinking of pumping in funds 
into India which had until now shunned the country. The figures 
released by the union Industry Ministry of late on foreign 
direct investment proposals so far having been cleared by the 
government in the last two and a half years show a distinct 
spurt. No less than 131.6 billion rupees of investment 
proposals have been approved since the reform program was 
launched. Of these proposals, the largest amount originated 
from the United States, notwithstanding the periodical outburst 
of the U.S. Government on various issues touching India and its 
concerns. If anything, the pragmatism of the U.S. investors goes 
to show the inherent attractiveness of India as the land for 
growth. 
  As such, the growth potentials of the developed countries 
are 
limited in various sectors and fresh opportunities could be 
explored only in the developing third world. Among the Third 
World countries almost all agree on the context of being an 
oft-repeated cliche, only two countries have growth 
opportunities, that is, India and China. The figures released 
also indicate that the interest in India is fairly widespread. 
If, as the largest economy, U.S. will have a natural interest 
in all major markets, smaller countries looking for investment 
of their surplus also think it fit to take a go in India. Oman, 
for example, has sought approval for investment to the tune of 
5.43 billion rupees in various projects in the country. The 
Foreign Investment Approval Board has cleared proposals for 
investment from United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Netherlands, 
Japan, Mexico, Ireland, France, Mauritius, Italy, and Hong Kong. 
  The willingness of the Non-Resident Indians [NRI's] have 
also 
changed remarkably. The figures reveal that from a figure of 
over 38 billion rupees in 1992, the NRI's have mooted 
investments of over 88 billion rupees. Translating these 
foreign investment proposals calls for spending up the Indian 
bureaucracy to an altogether new mode of functioning. After 
all, actual investments could come to pass only if several other 
conditions are also fulfilled. The process of liberalization 
should make sure that the administration does not sit over small 
procedural matters. At the same time,it is imperative on the 
authorities to be more vigilant about the flow of such funds. 
In the wake of the liberalization process, ardent advocates 
have emerged who are lobbying for indiscriminate entry of all. 
They have argued that the investments should be allowed 
wherever the investments want them to be and then the market 
forces will in the long run decide what survives. 
  There is certainly some logic in allowing funds in. After 
all, India does not suffer much and the foreign direct 
investment will willy-nilly create assets in this country only. 
Hence, investments might be as well allow inactivities which 
have so far been considered not core sectors [sentence as 
heard]. But, the question arises in the end whether there is 
any room for indigenous technology, preferences or entereprise 
in this country. Do we have to take hamburgers rather than 
samosas [a popular Indian hot dish] or sweetened aerated water 
manufactured by multinational corporations exactly in the way 
the world does?

  [Text] An Iraqi delegation, led by Sa'd 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Faysal, under secretary at the Foreign Ministry, and an 
Iranian delegation, led by Mohammad Javad Zarif, assistant 
foreign minister for organizations affairs, held a round of 
talks in Tehran today. The talks centered on the release and 
return of all Iraqi POW's in Iran and on conducting searches for 
the missing. The talks also covered the issue of returning all 
Iraqi planes in Iran. Several technical committees from both 
sides were formed to study the various outstanding problems 
between Iraq and Iran. 
  The Iraqi delegation, headed by Sa'd 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Faysal, 
arrived in Tehran the day before yesterday on a visit to Iran. 
The visit is aimed at completing talks with the Iranian side, 
which were begun in Baghdad during Mohammad Javad Zarif's visit 
on 17 October. It is also to prepare for a meeting between the 
two countries' foreign ministers, planned to be held in Baghdad 
later this year.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 21, IRNA -- Two morning dailies here 
Monday commented over the current visit to Iran of Iraqi Deputy 
Foreign Minister Sa'd al-Faysal and expressed pessimism over the 
result of the talks. 
  The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' said in its editorial that 
replacing mutual distrust between Iran and Iraq with an 
environment conducive to bilateral good will is possible only 
with the passage of time and the pursuance of a 'one step at a 
time' policy. 
  It quoted informed sources as saying that Baghdad's main 
objective in the current talks is to secure the speedy return of 
its fighter planes held in Iran. 
  "The Iraqi regime must realize that while it continues to 
arm 
and train anti-Iranian terrorists on its soil bordering the 
Islamic Republic, it would be childish to believe that Iran will 
return the planes which can easily end up in the hands of those 
same terrorists to be used against its citizens", the daily 
underlined. 
  Tehran's reluctance to expand relations with Baghdad stems 
from the fact that Iraq simultaneously speaks from both corners 
of its mouth, the paper said adding that from one corner come 
statements of reconciliation, while the other corner tries to 
convince the West that another Western investment in Baghdad's 
war machine is needed to bring Iran's Islamic revolution under 
control and to secure Western interests. 
  The article concluded by saying that Iraq no longer holds 
any 
attraction for its former Western backers, and the stability of 
the Persian Gulf countries, since the elimination of Baghdad 
from the regional power equation, has further convinced the West 
of Iraq's diminished value. 
  Commenting on the same subject, the daily `ABRAR' noted that 
although the Iraqis have so far shown reluctance in taking any 
positive step in their negoitiations with Iranian officials, 
they have almost turned over all possible concessions to the 
U.N. and the West. 
  The Iraqi officials hold the idea that through speedy 
mending 
of ties with the West, U.S. in particular, their country could 
regain its political status both at the international community 
and in the region, the paper added. 
  It further noted that the Iraqis, imagining that the West 
would forgive their past wrongdoings and they would experience 
the golden days once again, did not deem necessary to follow up 
negotiations with Iran. 
  Therefore, said the editorial, Iraq should abandon its 
hypocritical and stubborn policy and instead open a new chapter 
in its relations with Iran. 
  The paper concluded by saying that no doubt Iraqi statesmen 
are fully aware of the position and capabilities of both Iran 
and their own country under the present circumstances and if 
they act vigilantly they would not miss the chance.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati </F>
by unidentified correspondent in weekly "Political Roundtable" 
program -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr. Velayati, 
I thank you for attending the program. As my first question, I 
would like to ask why various efforts to solve the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have failed to achieve a satisfactory result 
in the last 23 months, while all involved parties claim to want 
to solve the problem in a fair way? 
  [Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. Greetings to dear viewers. I would like to mention 
that this is not the case. Not all sides involved in the 
resolution of the Bosnian issue are well-intentioned in the 
search to find an honorable solution to that complicated and 
painful problem. Therefore, we witness stagnation, deadlock, 
slowness, seeking excuses and obstructionism in the process of 
the work related to the establishment of peace and stability in 
Bosnia. Specifically the influential members of the Security 
Council, in various forms and degrees of strength, oppose the 
establishment of an Islamic state in the heart of Europe. And 
that is an issue which can be clearly said today. 
  In the past, it was assumed, on the basis of the available 
analysis, that some influential members of the United Nations, 
and specifically in the Security Council, would stop, in various 
forms and degrees of strength, the formation of that Islamic 
country in the heart of Europe in any way they can. That is the 
reality of the case. What you can see, which can be described 
in general as obstructionism toward the establishment of an 
honorable and fair peace, is caused by that ideology which 
dominates the Security Council and particularly its permanent 
members. 
  [Correspondent] In the same connection we witness that the 
Security Council -- to which you specifically referred -- 
prevents the efforts of the effective members of the ICO. What 
is the reason for that? 
  [Velayati] As I said the reasoning for that is the same as 
the reply to the first question. Islamic countries, according 
to a state of sympathy that exists in the world of Islam toward 
the fate of Muslims, adopted very clear and forthright stances 
in support of Bosnia. Today if an Islamic government exists 
which seeks to act differently to that it will face the pressure 
of its public opinion. Therefore, you see a solidarity among all 
the ICO members -- which number 52. That is 52 ICO member 
states are unanimous in the belief that the Bosnian problem must 
be resolved in an honorable and just manner; the aggressions and 
brutalities of the Serbs and Croats against the Muslims must be 
terminated; and human rights -- in its true sense -- must be 
observed in Bosnia. But we know, and we have experienced for 
many years, that some Western countries use the words human 
rights as a political weapon to advance their objectives. If 
they wish to put pressure on a country, they do it by using the 
human rights lever. But they themselves determine the criteria 
for human rights. Even if we seek to raise another issue within 
the framework of human rights by using those very criteria that 
they have determined themselves, they will oppose that method if 
it does not suit their political interests. In other words, 
they use differing standards when judging and making decisions 
on a single issue in the world. That is, double standards in 
international forums -- resulting from the influence exerted by 
influential states -- is quite obvious. You know that, for 
instance, the U.S. Government has been asked repeatedly to send 
its troops to Bosnia under the UN flag to prevent the Serbs' 
aggression -- and even the UN secretary general has made such a 
request recently -- but the Americans have so far abstained from 
such a thing. Whereas you see that in Kuwait and Somalia they 
themselves were the axis for implementing UN decisions. But in 
the case of Bosnia they have said bluntly that their national 
interests do not warrant such a thing. 
  [Correspondent] Yes. Just today there were reports saying 
that the commander of the UN forces in Bosnia has requested 
3,000 reinforcements which in practice would be from America but 
America has failed to agree. 
  [Velayati] Yes. Some American officials had already said 
they would do no such a thing since their national interests do 
not warrant it. Thus you see that they interpret human rights 
according to their national interests, or to be more clear, 
their personal interests. That is, if you see the Americans 
intervene somewhere -- under the pretext of supporting human 
rights, supporting humanitarian aspirations and peace -- it will 
be nothing but a deception because they do not intervene in 
similar scenarios where that detracts from their political 
interests. And they even may prevent intervention by those 
whose really intend to establish justice. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] You have pointed to the Nonaligned Movement, 
the ICO, and the latter's liaison group. Now why is it that the 
UN Security Council has called on NATO to act despite the fact 
that countries such as Iran have repeatedly announced their 
readiness to send troops? Is this a European and a Christian 
decision in connection with the formation of an Islamic 
government in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Velayati] In reality the Security Council which is under 
the rule of the permanent members of the Council, and more 
specifically under the rule of the western permanent members of 
the Council, seriously prevents the international scene from 
slipping away from the supervision and decisionmaking domain of 
these limited and influential members of the Security Council. 
It is in fact a form of coercion. On the surface the United 
Nations and the Security Council were formed after World War II 
to defend justice and keep security and peace. The UN Charter 
is in fact to guard and strengthen peace in an honorable and 
just fashion across the world and to propagate peaceful ideals. 
However the foundations are such that the international scene 
is under the yoke of several influential and powerful countries 
of the Security Council. They think that if they respond 
positively to requests by Islamic or third world countries and 
allow them to defend justice under the UN flag and according to 
UN charter, a part of the international situation may slip from 
their hands and the Bosnian situation could develop in a way 
that might not be in their interests. To conclude my answer to 
your question I repeat and emphasize the answer given to the 
earlier questions. The pretext of action by some western 
countries within the UN context is to seek peace and justice. 
However the content of their actions is in fact an effort toward 
maintaining the interests of the countries on whose behalf they 
are active in the United Nations. 
  As you pointed out, despite the declaration of Islamic 
countries in the Pakistan summit and the repeated emphasis in 
the recent Geneva summit as well as repeated emphasis in the 
liaison group of the Islamic Conference in Jakarta -- which was 
held during the nonaligned meeting -- stating the preparation of 
the Islamic countries, at least the several countries that had 
announced readiness, to send 20,000 fully equipped troops to 
Bosnia under the full supervision of the UN, so as to leave no 
doubt, we have not yet received a positive response form the UN 
secretary general. This is despite the fact that the secretary 
general and the Security Council repeatedly emphasize that there 
is a need for more peacekeeping troops to guard peace and the 
security of the besieged people of Bosnia. But they only ask 
some particular countries. You have pointed this out. They 
have asked the Americans to send 3,000 troops. Americans have 
not sent them. France and Holland said they will be not sending 
more. Well if they are short of troops and some UN members are 
prepared to send troops to the region to serve under the control 
of the UN commander, why are they not responding positively to 
this proposal by Islamic countries? We can then conclude that 
the UN Security Council is under the influence of several 
particular countries. And since these countries only see and 
wish to keep their own interests in the world, even to the cost 
of other countries, they try to keep the international situation 
under their own control. Thus they oppose other countries which 
even might wish to send troops with all sincerity. 
  [Correspondent] The NATO deadline to the Serbs ends Sunday 
night. NATO's intended deadline and action are not very 
reliable and permanent because they are limited to areas 
surrounding Sarajevo and the withdrawal of heavy weapons to a 
particular distance, but is it possible to predict the NATO 
action? 
  [Velayati] Their ultimatum is not very strong and no firm 
decision has been made. They have asked the Serbs to withdraw 
their heavy weapons 20 kilometers from where they are. We do 
not really know what this would solve in Bosnia's complex 
situation. That they have been told to withdraw their heavy 
weapons means light weapons are alright. And the formation of 
the Serb military forces around Sarajevo is such that they can 
aim with light weapons at the innocent people of Sarajevo with 
ease. Furthermore there are no plans for other Bosnian towns 
besieged by Serbs and Croats. There are also differences 
between NATO members over the implementation of the ultimatum. 
Even if we imagine that they resolve their differences and take 
action after the 10 days, it would be less an effective 
practical action and more a propaganda measure for some western 
countries which want to say that they are seeking peace and 
justice in Bosnia. Even if they take action, for example by 
bombing Serb positions, it would not be determining in the 
Bosnian situation. It would only be a propaganda measure in 
favor of countries making the decisions in NATO and a tool to 
silence the protest of people who of are fed up with this 
injustice. 
  [Correspondent] Dr. Velayati, this may seem a general 
question, but what is the solution to the Bosnian problem? 
  [Velayati] It seems to be very simple, but they do not want 
to see the implementation of a clear solution. Bosnia is an 
accepted UN member. According to the UN Charter, if the 
territorial integrity of a UN member country is threatened, it 
is the responsibility of the United Nations to defend that 
country's territorial integrity. That is to help the people of 
that country to safeguard their territorial integrity. Second 
if an act of aggression takes place against a country and 
genocide takes place, it is the duty of the United Nations to 
stop the genocide. Thirdly a number of resolutions were finally 
issued in support of Bosnia due to the public pressure. It is 
the duty of the United Nations to implement those resolutions. 
  Therefore the solution to the problem of Bosnia is that the 
UN Security Council, which is responsible for safeguarding peace 
and security in the world, should act, within the UN framework, 
and seriously take the necessary measures to end the aggression 
and bestial acts of the Serbs and Croats against Bosnia which is 
an independent country and a UN member. It should also stop the 
continuation of the genocide. It should also implement the UN 
approvals. 
  I mentioned earlier that the United Nations is dominated by 
double standards and you can see that in the way the Iraqi 
people were treated. Look at the situation that Iraq finds 
itself in today. A country with massive resources and a long 
history. An important Islamic and Arab country. We have left 
the Iraqi Government alone; but what sin have the Iraqi people 
committed? Those people have really been devastated under the 
the pretext of carrying out the decisions of the UN Security 
Council. The same disaster was wreaked on the Somali people. 
But regarding Bosnia they procrastinate somewhat. 
  Today, Bosnia's main problem is the indecision and 
incompetence of the United Nations. That is, even if just one 
of the influential members of the Security Council does not wish 
one serious action to be undertaken in the international arena 
it is able to carry out that wish. That is the United Nations's 
shortcoming. That is, it is sufficient for an influential 
Security Council member to veto a decision. It ties the UN 
hands, even if under that veto the worst crimes occur in a spot 
in the world. Just like it has in the Bosnian case! More than 
200,000 of the Bosnians, most of whom, almost all of whom were 
ordinary people and civilians -- women, children, young and old. 
They became martyrs through the continuation of the Serbs' 
crimes there. And hundreds of thousands became refugees. They 
are living a harsh life, in the heart of Europe and under the 
eyes of the UN observers. You see that the Serbs have deployed 
their mortars, their artillery, and any time they wish they kill 
the ordinary people who are passing through the street for 
shopping. Human rights are being violated and trampled on so 
blatantly over there and no serious objection is forthcoming 
among the European communities. 
  We return to the first part of our discussion. If you wish 
to know my understanding, it can be summarized in one word [as 
heard]. Those people are Muslims and wish to have a country 
where they can live in peace and tranquillity, just like the 
rest of the world nations. This reactionary idea continues to 
dominate in some Western communities that in practice they

<F P=106> [Second Friday sermon by Ayatollah Khamene'i, leader of the </F>
Islamic revolution, at Tehran University on 18 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the Compassionate, the 
Merciful. [passage omitted] 
  First I feel obliged to thank the honorable Iranian nation 
with all my being--an aware nation, a nation with a sense of 
timing, a nation which recognizes its enemy, a nation which is 
grateful for God's great bounties--for their demonstration of 
power on 11 February before the eyes of friends and foes the 
world over. We, who know about the world issues, and are aware 
of them, somewhat more than the general public, understood the 
strength of the blow that was delivered to the propaganda which 
the enemies of the Islamic republic of Iran had started a few 
months ago. 
  When they start the adverse propaganda they start it 
together 
since the other side is but one front. Those Zionist and 
arrogant news agencies--those famous agencies from whom all news 
reports and analyses are taken by all the world broadcasting 
aerials--and several radio stations which spend millions every 
year perchance to be able to get their voice across to a few 
people in Iran. The translators and presenters write, they 
employ people, they spend on technical things, spend on 
publicity, spend on writing, make policies, and spend much money 
to get that voice across to Iran, so that maybe a few 
individuals here and there listen to it and be influenced by it. 
  Beginning several months ago they began whispers--of course 
that is not new either, but once in a while they begin an 
onslaught--to the effect that the people no longer have anything 
to do with the revolution and Islam in Iran. The people are fed 
up with Islam. Look how badly the Islamic Republic of Iran's 
authorities have acted that the people have even put aside Islam. 
  Domestically, too, some were repeating those sentences. They 
still will do so, let me tell you! Unfortunately in our very 
universities--I say this to the Hizbollahi students so that they 
know--there are such motives here and there. Of course the 
majority of the lecturers are good; are faithful; support the 
development and advancement of this nation; support the Islamic 
revolution and the holy system of the Islamic republic. But you 
can't say that there are no sly ones either. In those same 
universities there are some people--of course they are very few, 
very few--who try to give this issue a philosophical form, 
saying that since the Islamic Republic came to power Islam 
weakened. There cannot be a more blatant lie and trick. 
  Islam's acme was reached all over the world with the 
creation 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  They want to portray the situation in an exactly opposite 
way. They want to say that the Islamic Republic, the formation 
of an Islamic state, and the delivery of the crushing blow of 
Islam and the Koran to the mouth of the enemy are all causing 
Islam harm. If this had been so, then the prophet and the lord 
of the faithful ['Ali, the first Shiite imam] would not have 
formed a government, and the leaders of the Islamic community at 
the advent of Islam would have just sat in their homes. What 
need was there then for forming a government? If an Islamic 
government was harmful for the delivery of Islam's message, then 
why did the prophet go to all that trouble and engage himself in 
so many wars in which so many people lost their lives? You can 
now see for yourselves how ignorant they are about Islam. 
  Sometimes words such as these are disseminated by a certain 
radio station belonging to one of the world's disgraced and ugly 
groups. This can be blamed on that group's ignorance, or the 
fact that it is not part of this community. But some people in 
this very Islamic homeland utter such meaningless words. 
  Anyway, the nation did what it had to do at a highly 
appropriate time. It came out on 11 February and amazed them. 
They were left speechless. What could they say, after all? 
The huge streets of Tehran, Azadi Square, and all towns and 
cities were filled with a massive crowd. This was the case even 
in those towns which the enemy wants to portray as having 
disputes with the Islamic system. The serious and resolute faces 
of the people of these towns were clearly visible. The enemies 
and the others witnessed how cohesively the Iranian nation was 
conducting its movement. 
  I tell you here that, in the world of today, there is not 
even one other single government -- whether among the major 
powers such as America or the smaller powers -- which has the 
capability to mobilize its nation in such a magnificent way to 
participate in a national and ideological event. This is 
something which only the Islamic Republic of Iran is able to 
accomplish. 
  Another point is that there is an onslaught against Muslims 
in the world, brothers and sisters, and Muslims should realize 
that they are being attacked from all sides. Even if a country 
is left alone in a corner of the world, it should not think that 
it is so; there is an onslaught against Islam and Muslims. Of 
course, the clear example of this is the great tragedy of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is really strange, it is unprecedented. 
  Those Serbs and Croats, backed by the British, certain 
European Governments, and America, have outdone the usurping 
Zionists of Israel in creating tragedies and cruelty. [passage 
omitted] 
  Today all the events are seen in American and European 
magazines and press and television, and the hardhearted West and 
the arrogant and unjust governments are sitting around -- having 
first equipped the oppressor, doing everything for him, and 
giving him plenty of scope -- waiting for the strong to cut off 
the head of the weak, from ear to ear. Every once in a while 
they say a few things, hold a conference, and so forth; it is 
all empty talk. 
  Of course, Islamic governments are not all that faultless. 
Some have behaved well. The Iranian Nation and Government have 
behaved better than all. Some others have behaved well and some 
badly. Otherwise, if Islamic governments had said to those who 
support the Serbs that they would sever ties and stop trading 
with them for a month, things would not be as they are. They 
were negligent. 
  In any case, it is a big event. Of course, God willing, you 
will see -- the whole world will see -- in the future that this 
event will be beneficial to Islam in Europe and harmful to 
arrogant European powers. 
  The nature of this event is such that in future years 
[pauses] God willing, this will pave the way for the revival of 
Islam and the situation of Islam in Europe. That is one example 
of the onslaught. Another example is Palestine, occupied 
Palestine. Today Israelis, before the eyes of the world, have 
usurped Palestine and have imprisoned, tortured, convicted, 
forced into exile, and dropped bombs on Palestinians and the 
world remains silent. Moreover, the world condemns the oppressed 
people, saying: Why you do such things? When I say the world, I 
mean the world of arrogance -- that is, America in the first 
place, which is the most wicked and malicious of them all, 
followed by those who follow America. 
  What is happening in Lebanon is a struggle against the 
usurper Zionist enemy that has usurped both Palestine and parts 
of Lebanon. Instead of asking the usurper why it has usurped, 
the world criticizes the people who are defending their homes, 
asking them: Why are you defending them? See what a filthy new 
world order is dominating the world. Is that the new world 
order they were speaking about? A bullying thug enters the 
house of a group of orphan children, occupies their home, takes 
away their facilities, foodstuffs, their comfortable rooms, 
their bedrooms, occupies the whole space of their house, and 
imprisons the occupants of the house in a cellar, for example, 
and sets restrictions on them. As soon as an opportunity arises 
for those children to cry out and ask why, he gets angry, 
saying: You always speak of struggle, why do you not think of 
peace? Why you are so ill-humored? You see, that is the 
situation of the world today. They carry out acts of aggression 
and mass murder against Muslims, and the mass murderers are 
encouraged, as has happened in Kashmir and Tajikistan. They 
collaborate to destroy Islam. But when Muslims open their 
mouths once, they say: For God's sake, you always speak of 
struggle. You are always ill-humored. That is the way things 
are. They have begun a dangerous and violent confrontation 
against Islam. Of course this confrontation that, despite going 
on strongly for around 10 to 12 years and being properly 
planned, has, God be praised, created more problems for 
arrogance and has made life more difficult for it. Each day 
world arrogance becomes more disappointed and the governments 
that support it become more hesitant. That is the way things 
are. Muslims of the world should know this, and you, the Muslim 
nation of Iran, should also know that Islamic Iran is where 
Islam can speak forcefully. 
  Appreciate such power, glory, and independence. Appreciate 
the capability of this nation and this government to express 
their feelings about any power. Others do not have such a 
capability. God be praised, we have increased our capability in 
that respect day by day. We have become stronger each day, 
thanks to almighty God. the enemy, with all its power, has 
become frustrated in its confrontation with Islam. Our nation 
should appreciate this, our government should appreciate this, 
officials should appreciate this. Do not distance yourselves 
from Islam. We should not forget the enemy. We had the test of 
11 February, in which our nation performed well. We also have 
the Jerusalem Day test, toward the end of the month of Ramadan, 
to come. 
  A couple of times each year, God be praised, we have such 
general demonstrations and shows of the Islamic Iran's strength. 
One is performed better than the other. You should not forget 
Jerusalem Day, and, of course, the path of being steadfast in 
this arena is to maintain a close link with God, so that God 
almighty does not deny us his bounty and mercy. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Today, on the first Friday of the auspicious 
month of Ramadan, millions of fasting compatriots held Friday 
prayers in the cities and various areas of the country in an 
atmosphere imbued with spirituality. 
  The unifying and formidable Friday prayers were held in 
Tehran under the imamate of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, 
the exalted leader of the Islamic revolution, and Tehran's 
Friday imam, and with a spectacular participation of the fasting 
and faithful people in serried ranks at Tehran University and 
its surrounding streets. 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i devoted the first prayer 
sermon to a discussion about the importance of observing divine 
piety and its role in a life of faithful human beings and, while 
calling upon the worshippers to take the opportunity of the 
blessed month of Ramadan for entering the tremendous realm of 
piety, said: Piety brings many benefits with it to the life of 
human beings, including the guarding of self against slips and 
precipices. Strengthening a spirit of piety brings success for 
human beings in divine tests and enables them to continue along 
the path of further strengthening their faith and serving God. 
  Tehran's Friday imam considered the fall of eastern 
imperialism to have resulted from lack of piety and said: Fall 
comes after lack of piety and nations devoid of piety will be 
beset by pride, arrogance, deviation, and destruction. The fact 
that the powerful nations of the world have been beset by all 
that at various periods of history demonstrates that all the 
impious individuals and nations of the world must await such a 
fall. [passage omitted] 
  The Friday prayer leader of Tehran stressed the widespread 
currency of words of righteousness in the Islamic country of 
Iran. He said: The present aura in the country belongs to 
righteousness. This is because our sovereignty is based on 
righteousness to which our nation ardently adhere. For this 
reason, we are not sensitive to the nonsense spoken by the 
wrong-doers. In the Islamic system, security has been provided 
for all the members of the society, even for those who are not 
in agreement with the trend of righteousness. [passage omitted] 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i began the second sermon of 
the Friday prayers by paying tribute to the Iranian nation for 
their epic making presence in the 11 February revolution 
anniversary demonstrations, and considered this move of the 
people as an important and effective blow to the poisonous 
propaganda of the enemies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  [Begin Khamene'i recording] I consider it necessary to 
sincerely thank the great, aware, and vigilant nation of Iran--a 
nation who appreciates time and place, is fully capable of 
identifying its enemies, and is always grateful to God for His 
blessings--for displaying its power and might on 11 February 
before the eyes of the friends of foes the world over. 
  The huge streets of Tehran, the Azadi Square, and all towns 
and cities were filled with a massive crowd on that day. This 
was the case even in those towns which the enemy wants to 
portray as having disputes with the Islamic system. The serious 
and resolute faces of the people of these towns were clearly 
visible. The enemies and the others [as heard] saw that the 
Iranian nation conducted its movement in such a cohesive manner. 
[end recording] 
  The leader of Islamic revolution continued his sermons by 
referring to the hefty budget that the Zionist and arrogant 
media devote to their attempts to influence the public opinion 
of the Iranian nation. He said: News agencies which are 
influenced and guided by the Zionists, as well as a number of 
foreign radio stations have been trying for a while now to 
create the illusion that the Iranian people are no longer 
interested in the revolution and Islam, and the performance of 
the Islamic republic has led to the weakening of Islam. 
However, this deceitful ploy is too disgraceful for any one to 
pay attention to. This is because Islam's growth and 
magnificence in the world is due to the creation of the Islamic 
republic. 
  The Friday prayer leader of Tehran then revealed the 
propaganda ploys of the enemies of Islam and said: They want to 
induce that the formation of an Islamic government and the 
delivery of the crushing blow of Islam and the Koran to the 
enemies has caused Islam harm. However, they are ignorant about 
Islam. If what the enemies claim had been correct, then the 
eminent prophet of Islam would not have formed a political 
entity, and he would not have been involved so many wars. 
Furthermore, His Holiness 'Ali, may peace be upon him, would 
not have set out to form a government, and the leaders of the 
Islamic community during the early years of Islam would have 
remained in their homes. 
  His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said that the people's 
magnificent rallies on 11 February humiliated the enemies of 
Islam. He said: Our enemies saw that the Iranian nation was 
present on the scene cohesively. Today one cannot find any 
other nation in the world which is able to mobilize its people 
in this way to take part in a national and ideological event. 
[passage omitted] 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said the issue of occupied 
Palestine is another example of the onslaught by the enemies of 
Islam. He said: The usurper Israelis have usurped Palestine in 
full view of the world people and continue to torture, exile, 
bomb, and execute Palestinians; but the arrogant world, headed 
by America, condemns the oppressed Palestinians and criticizes 
their defense of their home. That shows what sort of malevolent 
new order is ruling the world. 
  The leader of the Islamic revolution referred to the world 
powers collaborating to destroy Islam. He said: The enemies of 
Islam have started a dangerous and harsh struggle against Islam. 
The longer it takes the more they fail, and governments 
supporting them more scarce. World Muslims should know that 
Islamic Iran is the point where Islam can say its piece with 
strength.

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F>
Group] 
  [Text] The crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has adopted new 
international dimensions. The conflict among the United States, 
Europe, and Russia over the ultimatum to the Serbs has 
overshadowed many political developments. 
  While Europe continues to have doubts on the implementation 
of the recent NATO threats against the Serbs, Russia's protest 
against the ultimatum to the Serbs has given Europeans a good 
chance to avoid their humanitarian and political responsibility 
to deal with the Serbs' crimes. The Russian deputy foreign 
minister has said that his country will do its best at the 
United Nations to prevent action on this threat, adding that 
Russia's goal is to be sure that this threat will never be 
implemented and that an attack will never take place. 
  On the same topic, Russian President Boris Yeltsin has sent 
a 
letter to the heads of the five Western countries warning of the 
dangers that an air strike on the Serbs in Bosnia would entail 
and said that this would lead to unforeseeable consequences. 
Meanwhile, in a fresh attempt, Russia has proposed an 
international peace conference for Bosnia next week and has 
informed the heads of the Western countries of this. However, 
this proposal has been rejected by Washington and a U.S. State 
Department spokesman said that lengthy preparations would be 
necessary for that. 
  At any rate, the recent developments in the Bosnian crisis 
and its international consequences show that, basically 
speaking, Western and Eastern Europe are very vulnerable in this 
crisis and that failures in finding a fundamental solution to 
this crisis has posed difficult problems for the behind the 
scenes efforts in the crisis. 
  The West is facing a great crisis of values and 
humanitarianism; and pressures from domestic and international 
public opinion are constantly increasing. Meanwhile, Russia, 
which heretofore influenced the developments in the Bosnian 
crisis by backing the Serbs of Bosnia and Serbia, has taken an 
active role now that there is a possibility of NATO intervention 
against the Serbs and is trying to create a security umbrella 
there vis-a-vis the West reminiscent of the Warsaw Pact. 
Otherwise, no one takes the NATO threat seriously; not because 
NATO is not taking any steps against the Serbs, but because any 
possible moves by NATO will not tip the scales in Bosnia in 
favor of the Muslims. 
  Meanwhile, what is causing concern here is that many Western 
countries are favoring a military step, or at least a military 
threat, so as to decrease the pressures on them by domestic 
public opinion and worldwide Islam and to increase pressure on 
the Bosnian Muslims to accept a compromise and agree to the 
division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The world of Islam should not be influenced by the political 
and propaganda commotion and forget its responsibility vis-a-vis 
Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed station commentary] </F>
  [Text] In the wake of release of the report of Mr Reynaldo 
Galindo Pohl, the UN Human Rights Commission's special 
representative for probing into the so-called human right's 
violations in Iran, yesterday a spokesman of Iran's Foreign 
Ministry denied the contention of the representative of the UN 
Human Rights Commission. 
  The spokesman described the contention as baseless and 
fabricated. 
  In a report released by the special representative of the 
human rights commission at the UN last Friday, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran was again declared as the violater of human 
rights due to such cases as execution and crushing of drug 
smugglers and launching a drive against social evils. 
  It is also been claimed in the report that there exists a 
large number of political prisoners in Iran and religious 
minorities are harassed. 
  Since 1948 when the principles on observance of human right 
were formulated at the UN there has now elapsed nearly half a 
century. 
  During these years fervent efforts have been made so that 
the 
world nations may have access to some broad based principles 
devoid of political discrimination and observations. 
  This was aimed at making them check any infringement of 
their 
rights. 
  Hence today nearly all the world states duly accept the 
principles in observing the human rights and also respect them. 
  This acceptance is also for the reason that the UN as the 
greatest world body is recognized as the only forum, which 
basically should be the body for considering world issues 
specially for defending the rights of human beings at global 
level. 
  But in reality such attention to human rights has so far 
been 
payed in a different manner. 
  It is now for many years that western states and governments 
which have risen to covertly or overtly confront the Islamic 
revolution in Iran over the past fifteen years, have been using 
human rights as a weapon against Islamic Iran. 
  At the onset of the Islamic revolution's victory, the 
Islamic 
republic of Iran viewed with respect international and human 
rights organizations similar to other world bodies. 
  But acts of the UN human rights commission soon showed that 
the term human rights is merely a forced motto in the 
contemporary world. 
  Also the statements and reports of this commission, prior to 
have been effected by domestic realities of world states, are 
the outcome of the exigencies of domineering world policies. 
  This precisely points to the conditions which are now faced 
by us. It is indisputable but any move in safeguarding 
humanitarian criteria of human rights will be possible only when 
those involved with human rights issues at the international 
level approach the subject without considering political aspects 
and conservative outlook, but they act in a totally impartial 
manner without taking sides with their typical cultural values. 
  They should also refrain from using the issue of human 
rights 
as a political weapon.

<F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>
  [Text] Kabul, Feb 20 (AFP) -- A special commission of 
Afghan cabinet members announced proposals Sunday to establish a 
permanent peace among the warring Afghan factions in Kabul, 
including a new assembly to pick a new president. 
  The proposals centre on the establishment of a special 
committee which will have two tasks: securing a compromise 
agreement between the factions, and organising a Loya Jirga, or 
grand assembly, to elect a new president and cabinet. 
  A four-day ceasefire, which ended Friday, followed 45 days 
of 
nonstop fighting in the capital, but this ceasefire has yet to 
be extended to formalise the uneasy and unofficial truce 
currently enjoyed in Kabul. 
  The proposal for a Loya Jirga is a throwback to December 
1992 
when President Borhanoddin Rabbani was elected in a 
controversial assembly called the Shoora Ahl-i-Hal va Aqd, the 
legality of which was challenged by some rival factions. 
  Whether called a Loyal Jirga or Shoora Ahl-i-Hal va Aqd, the 
idea is for a group to vote for the nation's leader. 
  The cabinet commission proposes that the Loya Jirga be 
convened within the next five months, that is, by the end of 
Rabbani's current tenure as president. 
  Delegates elected to the Loya Jirga are to be respected 
personalities, including Muslim theologians, and political and 
social experts. 
  Whether former communists will be eligible to participate 
was 
not explained. 
  Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar is allied with the ex- 
communist forces of Uzbek General Abdol Rashid Dostam, who tried 
unsuccessfully to unseat Rabbani in the coup of January 1994. 
  Hekmatyar's successful military challenge to Rabbani's 1992 
election as president won him the prime ministerial nomination 
in March 1993. 
  Rabbani's declaration of a holy war against Dostam may prove 
to be a sticking point for acceptance of the cabinet peace 
package if it means Dostam will be excluded. The four-day Kabul 
ceasefire was similarly flawed by the exclusion of Dostam's 
forces, giving all factions a convenient excuse to blame daily 
violations on the Uzbeks. 
  Saturday night's two- to three-hour exchange of heavy 
artillery and light weapons' fire was an indication of the 
latent tension between the warring factions, regardless of their 
willingness to extend the expired ceasefire. 
  Up to 20 heavy calibre shells crashed into the former 
diplomatic enclave of Wazir Akbar Khan shortly after midday 
Sunday, underscoring the fragile nature of security in the 
Afghan capital.

  [Text] A meeting of the cabinet was chaired today by 
Esteemed Deputy Prime Minister Mawlawi Mohammad Arsalan Rahmani. 
At the meeting, the current situations in the country were 
discussed. 
  The press department of the Prime Ministry told the Bakhtar 
Information Agency that [word indistinct] Planning Minister 
Hojjat-ol-Eslam Seyyed Mohamad 'Ali Javid read out a draft plan 
that has been prepared by an appointed commission concerning the 
solution of the problems of war, the maintenance of a lasting 
peace, and the formation of a new political order. The meeting 
approved the draft for a final solution, and it was decided 
that--in understanding with other Muslim and rightful 
parties--this draft was to be even more enriched and complete. 
  The following is a brief outline of this plan: [passage 
indistinct] The cabinet, as the highest executive body of the 
country, gives the right to itself to be in front on the path of 
strengthening peace in Afghanistan and to coordinate all Islamic 
plans and efforts that are in process in this regard. [passage 
indistinct] as follows: 
  1. The solution of internecine problems and armed clashes 
between the jihadi formations of Afghanistan and the opposition 
side [as heard] through talks and negotiations in consideration 
of the observation of the Jalalabad agreements. 
  2. The formation of a constituent council numbering 60 to 
100 members--including Afghan scholars, jihadi formations, 
political, social, and Muslim personalities--to prepare for a 
great national council, the Loya Jerga. This council [passage 
indistinct] so that personalities understanding our religious 
and national values-- as far as possible--can come together 
representing various strata and circles in the country to 
determine the political destiny of this country, which has been 
soaked in their blood. 
  4. [number as received]. It is necessary that the 
representatives of Afghanistan's administrative units be 
appointed in proportion to their population. 
  5. In order to obtain [word indistinct], it is necessary 
that the representatives of the United Nations and of the ICO 
[Islamic Conference Organization] observe the work and the 
formation of the Council. 
  6. In order to avoid an administrative vacuum, it deems 
necessary that the Islamic State of Afghanistan continue its 
work until the end of its term in keeping with the decisions of 
Shura-e Ahl-e Hal wa Aqd [Solution and Settlement Council] and 
that of the Jalalabad agreements. 
  7. It is necessary to choose a number of [words 
indistinct] from members of the Islamic Loya Jerga as members of 
the country's parliament [words indistinct]. 
  8. The aforementioned Jerga is to appoint the country's 
future leadership and parliament. 
  9. This plan is to be implemented within the next five 
months. 
  10. This Loya Jerga is similar to the council that has 
been recorded in the Feqh books [Islamic law] as Shura-e Hal wa 
Aqd. The cabinet and the relevant commission ask all scholars 
and [words indistinct] of the country to even further enrich 
this draft through their written and verbal views and proposals. 
  At the end of the meeting, Javid and the cabinet members 
took 
part in a news conference and explained various parts of the 
draft to home and foreign journalists.

  [Text] An-Nawar [Feb] 22, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY -- The 
faction of Golboddin Hekmatyar which presently surrounds the 
Afghanistan capital Kabul has announced that it will not lift 
its blockade which denies the city any relief supplies. The 
faction was able to intensify its blockade within the pattern of 
stuggle for power between what were once called mojahedin and 
later became political rivals whose conflict is systematically 
destroying the country.

  [Text] In Afghanistan, rival warring factions resorted to 
heavy fighting last night after a five-day uneasy calm. The 
fighting, which was the heaviest during the last fortnight, 
continued throughout the night and gradually died down in the 
morning. The two sides used heavy artillery and rocket fire on 
each other's positions in Bala Hesar, (Tapamaranjan), 
(Tivihilloc), Takatu, and (Omryan). The presidential palace in 
Kabul and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekymatyar's headquarters in 
Chahar Asiab also came under heavy fire. 
  Meanwhile, efforts are continuing to search new avenues for 
peace in Kabul. 
  Iranian officials have begun distribution of relief supplies 
to Afghan refugees in tents in Jalalabad. The supplies were 
flown to Peshawar and were taken to Jalalabad by road. The head 
of Iran's aid operation for Afghanistan said his country also 
plans to give supplies to Kabul once the city's airport is 
reopened to cargo planes.

conditions in Sudan and which enjoys life [as heard] for the 
sake of a peaceful solution. He added that his visit had also 
been postponed at the request of the Kenyan Foreign Ministry. 
  His excellency added that the Kenyan ambassador to Sudan had

  [Text] Khartoum, 19 Feb (SUNA) -- Sudan has called on the 
United Nations to omit paragraphs hostile to Islam from the 
report of Gaspar Biro, the special rapporteur on human rights in 
Sudan. If this demand is not conceded Sudan will reject the 
report in its entirety and will review its cooperation with the 
UN agenda on human rights. This was stated in letters sent by 
Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih to the UN secretary general, 
the chairman of the Human Rights Committee, the ICO secretary 
general and the OAU secretary general. 
  A responsible source at the Foreign Ministry told SUNA that 
the letters explained that the report contained paragraphs 
serious in their meanings and aims, but reflecting a lack of 
respect for Islam. Biro called for action against the Sudanese 
penal code, which is derived from Islamic law [word indistinct] 
international and demanded that it be canceled. 
  The letters pointed out that because the rapporteur's 
allegations had wronged the whole Muslim nation, he must be 
interrogated and condemned by all states, organizations and 
bodies which respect the right of all peoples to choose their 
legal and political systems. 
  Moreover, the people's organization in defense of faith and 
homeland in a statement today called on the UN secretary general 
to withdraw Biro's report, to put the rapporteur on trial 
immediately, and to expel him from the United Nations. The 
United Nations should also apologize to the Islamic nation.

  [Text] 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the Presidential 
Council in the Republic of Yemen arrived in Damascus at noon 
today. 
  Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam led those who received 
al-Bid at the Damascus International Airport. Khaddam and 
al-Bid then headed in an official motorcade for the guest 
palace, al-Bid's residence. 
  Al-Bid made a statement to the correspondent of the Syrian 
Arab News Agency in which he said: 
  "We are glad, while visiting the sisterly Syrian Arab 
Republic, to meet with our brothers in this fraternal country, 
led by President Hafiz al-Asad, to discuss fraternal bilateral 
relations and ways of bolstering and developing them, in 
addition to the Arab and international situation. 
  "It is an opportunity to acquaint our Syrian brothers with 
developments in Yemen and the results of national dialogue and 
efforts contained in the document of pledge and accord that will 
be signed in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on the 10th of the 
blessed Ramadan. 
  "We believe that it is an opportunity to discuss with our 
brothers in the beloved Syria the means of healing the rift, 
restoring Arab cohesion, and organizing the single Arab house in 
a manner that will contribute to the restoration of Arab 
solidarity and the activation of the Arab nation's role among 
the nations. This will come in the wake of new international 
circumstances and changes, and in a manner that allows the Arab 
nation to confront the dangers and challenges facing it. 
  "On this occasion, I am pleased to express my satisfaction 
with the development of fraternal relations between our country 
and the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic, and to emphasize the 
importance of developing these relations in a manner that serves 
the joint interests of the two fraternal Yemeni and Syrian 
peoples, and the issues that concern our Arab and Islamic 
nations, and strengthens the role and status of the two 
countries in the Arab and international arenas." 
  Al-Bid is accompanied by Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, a Yemeni 
Socialist Party Political Bureau member and head of the 
secretariat of the party's Central Committee.

<F P=106> [Speech by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the Yemeni </F>
Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, at the Royal Hashemite Court in Amman -- live] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. Praise be to God, who has guided us to this felicity, 
never could we have found guidance, had it not been for the 
guidance of God. [part of a Koranic verse] Blessed be this 
Ramadan. Blessed be this agreement, God willing, and blessed be 
your efforts. 
  To begin, I am pleased and honored to thank, once again, our 
dear brother, His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal, and Jordan's 
leadership and beloved people. We in Yemen are honored that 
Amman would host this gathering and this blessed agreement, God 
willing, to start the new phase in Yemeni history that we sign 
here and continue there, in Yemen. 
  Thank God, the agreement has been signed. Despite the 
wounds, the wound of the homeland is dearer and greater as far 
as we are concerned. Everything dear becomes worthless for the 
sake of Yemen. Our sincerity and seriousness will be tested 
tomorrow, when we return there. What is important in this 
agreement is our ability to implement it. 
  Never mind. This time, in Yemen we had another kind of 
conflict, a dialogue with words. We ruled out the dialogue of 
bullets and the dialogue of violence. We appealed to national 
unanimity. We signed this document. And today, we say, after 
signing, that this is the document of the homeland, the document 
of national unanimity, and not the document of any one party. 
With the blessings of God, we will all join hands and work to 
implement it, despite our reservations, or feelings -- which are 
based on past experiences -- that there will be difficulties in 
implementing it. However, let us be optimistic. We must be 
optimistic all the time. 
  From our people, we will find blessings. We will find 
support from all faithful people. This is the document of all 
faithful people. We hope we will succeed in taking 
it...[pauses] despite our pains. I now have a picture of martyr 
Majid, martyr Kamil, and martyr Hashim al-'Attas [Yemeni 
Socialist Party officials or relatives of party officials 
assassinated in Yemen], but Yemen is more precious than them 
all. We must place our country above all other considerations, 
above all personal considerations. We beseech God to grant us 
success. We will work seriously to move into implementation 
with all the faithful people. 
  What is new today is not the coalition formula. What is new, 
with this national consensus document, is the formula of the 
larger- scale coalition, the national consensus that helped us 
reach this document. We think that now after this crisis -- and 
I stress the need to admit that it is a crisis in order to be 
able to address it, understand it well, and treat it, at the 
minimum level of the common denominators that we have reached. 
  It is all right. With the blessings of God we march. But as 
a result of this crisis, awareness must be promoted about the 
issue of unity in Yemen and Arab unity in the future. From now 
on, we must use our minds to produce knowledge. We must also 
allow feelings their role. We are only human. With the 
blessings of God, time has caught us. It is Ramadan and the 
fast-breaking time is approaching. May God accept your fasting 
and bless your fast-breaking meal.

<F P=106> [Declaration by the Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue </F>
Committee, read by Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, Dialogue Committee 
rapporteur, at the signing of the Yemeni document of pledge and 
accord on 20 February at the Royal Hashemite Court in Amman -- 
live] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. We, the signers of the pledge and accord 
document, thank God for having helped our people, represented by 
political forces in and out of power, to choose the correct way 
to complete the accord document through democratic, serious, and 
responsible dialogue with a view to putting a definitive end to 
the crisis, reinforcing unity, democracy, and stabilizing the 
state of law and order and institutions as a practcial way to 
achieve devleopment and contribute to the civilized Arabic and 
Islamic agenda. 
  The signing of the pledge and accord document in Amman, the 
capital of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, will put a 
definitive end to all complications. It will expedite the end 
of the crisis. It will slice through the roots of the crisis and 
contribute much to the implementation of the contents of the 
document, so as to restore security and stability to the dear 
Yemeni homeland. 
  By signing the pledge and accord document in brotherly 
Jordan, we have added faith to our Yemeni document, confirming 
the nation's ability to take the initiative to resolve national 
problems and crises, restablish close Arab links, and revive 
hope in an era of division that has intensified to the point of 
enmity between brother and brother. 
  We, the Yemenis, have suffered from much political trouble 
in 
our contemporary history. The result is an unshakable faith in 
unity as the answer and the way to build our modern state on 
foundations of democracy, social justice, equality, and human 
rights. Unity is a historic step on the road to our 
comprehensive Arab and Islamic unity. Local, Arab, and world 
conditions that coincided with the establishment of our unity 
not only had a negative impact on our unionist, democratic 
project, but included all the remnants of the division era -- 
remnants that were not taken into account during and after the 
Gulf war. As a result, our steps in our drive to build the new 
modern state have faltered. We should have been working hard to 
firm up the foundation of unity and to reinforce its democratic 
course, to open the door to the prosperity of the homeland and 
the well-being of the people. 
  Our people have proved to the world that they have enough 
strength and wisdom to ride out the crises that obstruct their 
march, subordinating impulse to reason and narrow interests to 
the call of conscience. 
  Our people have borne numerous difficulties. Much negativism 
has affected various aspects of their lives. Yet, the historic 
experience of Yemen proves that the will of the people has 
triumphed. Only democratic dialogue will be able to realize the 
unity and stability of the homeland and survive crises, no 
matter how delicate or complex the situation may be. Only 
through democratic and peaceful dialogue can we start on the 
correct road out of the crisis and toward serious action to 
attain all that our people and brothers and friends around the 
world want. 
  We emphasize that Yemen will remain united, now that we have 
worked out its present and future outlines and laid the 
foundations for its stability and advancement and affluence, 
drawing succor and success from God and resolve and 
steadfastness from our people. 
  In these awesome and historic moments, we declare our 
determination to abide by the accord document and the sincere 
commitment of our political parties and organizations to turn it 
into a practical program for our new march as one team. We will 
confront anyone who tries to block its implementation. We will 
abide by all guarantees and implement everything we agreed on, 
in accordance with the timetables specified in the document. 
  We would like to emphasize that the progress and well-being 
of peoples are contingent upon the strength of institutions and 
the principles and the clarity of vision and methods. We hereby 
promise our great Yemeni people to make the Dialogue Commitee, 
the political parties and organizations, along with all 
well-meaning Yemenis, a potent force to advance the 
implementation of the pledge and accord document. 
  On this occasion and in this favored month, we take the 
opportunity to extend our deep thanks to His Majesty King Husayn 
of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and to the Jordanian 
government and people for their distinguished efforts on behalf 
of Yemen's unity. We thank them for their sponsorship of this 
blessed, historic meeting. We thank those who have expressed 
their concern and exerted themselves so we, the Yemenis, might 
come safely through the crisis. Our thanks go to all those who 
have shared our accord signing ceremonies. 
  In conclusion, we thank our patient Yemeni people for their 
patience and endurance and for helping us lift ourselves from 
the crisis in the homeland and the people. We congratulate our 
Arab and Islamic nation on the occasion of the blessed month of 
Ramadan. We ask God that next year's Ramadan will see us all 
enjoying the fruits of security and stability. We thank God and 
seek his succor and help.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council, left Amman for home 
this afternoon after taking part in the signing of the Yemeni 
accord document in Amman yesterday under the patronage of His 
Majesty King Husayn. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, President Salih 
thanked the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, represented by His 
Majesty King Husayn, for hosting the signing of the accord 
document. He said: On the sidelines of the occasion, we held 
consultations on issues of interest to the Republic of Yemen and 
the Hashmemite Kingdom of Jordan, and we discussed several 
issues pertaining to our Arab and Islamic nation--issues on 
which both countries maintain identical positions and views. 
  Although we have overcome the challenges of the crisis in 
our 
Yemeni homeland, we, as Arabs, still face more general and more 
comprehensive challenges, which we should confront seriously and 
honestly. This will not take place unless we patch up our 
differences and consider higher national interests above other, 
narrower regional interests. These other interests are 
distracting our countries' attention from promoting collective 
pan-Arab action and formulating the situation in accordance with 
a responsible desire to restore and enhance Arab solidarity. We 
must do this in order to meet the minimum aspirations of our 
peoples at this time, a time in which we see a new trend of 
regional relations that conflicts with the collective action for 
which we yearn.

took part in the farewell ceremony. 
  In a departure statement, President Salih paid tribute to 
efforts exerted by his majesty in ending the rift in Yemen. He

stay bilateral issues of concern and other pan-Arab and Muslim 
issues. 
  The Yemeni president said more challenges are facing Arabs 
that need firmness and faithfulness. He said this would be 
achieved by reconciliation among Arabs and putting pan-Arab 
interests before regional ones. Mr. Salih said that he is 
looking for bilateral Arab meetings as a first step toward 
gatherings that would be of greater benefit for all Arabs.

<F P=106> [First part of "text" of "Pledge and Accord Document" </F>
drafted by the Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue Committee on 18 
January -- numbering and lettering of paragraphs as published] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Preamble: </H5>
  Praise be to God Who says: "And hold fast, all together, by 
the rope Allah stretches out for you, and be not divided among 
yourselves." [Koranic verse] 
  From 1 Jumadi al-Akhir to 7 Sha'ban 1414 Hegira, 
corresponding to the period from 22 November 1993 to 18 January 
1994, the Political Forces Dialogue Committee held continuous 
meetings in both Sanaa and Aden in a determined and sincere 
effort to contain the homeland's political crisis and to find 
genuine solutions to advance the march of the blessed Yemeni 
unity realized on 22 May 1990. This effort is intended to 
strengthen unity and democracy and lay down firm and stable 
foundations for the state of order, law, and institutions. 
  The Political Forces Dialogue Committee's effort began after 
the political crisis and its repercussions went beyond all 
acceptable boundaries. That effort was in response to an urgent 
need for cooperation among all Yemenis to put a speedy and 
decisive end to that crisis and its negative and harmful 
consequences, which seriously threatened the homeland and the 
people together, and their unity and cohesion. That crisis 
threatened the people's national gains, which were realized 
after many years of suffering and struggle, during which 
caravans of martyrs offered their blood. 
  As a result of that crisis, Yemen inevitably seemed to the 
entire world to be standing on the edge of an abyss. Basically, 
that crisis was the outcome of a lack of confidence, 
accumulating mistakes, serious transgressions and confusion in 
tasks and authorities, and the failure to abide by the 
Constitution and established laws and regulations. All this has 
exacerbated the security and economic situation and gravely 
harmed the people's way of life. 
  Painstaking and sincere efforts have been exerted to define 
the steps and final rules for the return of stability and 
security to the cherished Yemeni homeland. In order to avoid 
the recurrence of what has happened, to safeguard unity, expand 
popular participation in the making and implementation of 
decisions, establish a true democracy that goes from the village 
to the top of the state's hierarchy, and lay down strong bricks 
in the building of a strong Yemeni state that safeguards rather 
than threatens, and maintains resources rather than squanders 
them, the dialogue committee drafted this document. This 
document constitutes the sound beginning for the building of the 
new Yemen, the Yemen of unity and freedom. The document shows 
Yemeni wisdom and places reason and logic above all 
considerations. 
  Having signed and announced this document to the Yemeni 
people, all political parties declare their commitment to it and 
to continuing all efforts to implement it in the way it 
describes. 
  This national document covers the important issues addressed 
by the political forces' dialogue. These are as follows: 
<H5>  I. Those Charged in Cases of Security Violations: </H5>
  1. Firm measures should be adopted to capture fleeing 
suspects in incidents of assassinations, attempted 
assassinations, highway robbery, and other security incidents. 
Legal and public trials shall be held immediately for those who 
have been captured in connection with acts of sabotage. 
Fairness and speedy implementation of penalties shall be 
ensured in these trials. 
  2. The dialogue committee stresses the contents of the 
government's statement concerning measures for combating 
domestic and foreign terrorism and for deporting non-Yemenis 
proven to have carried out acts that contravene Yemen's policy 
and laws or to have propagated or instigated such acts. All 
those who are convicted after legal and public trials in which 
fairness and the implementation of penalties are ensured should 
be deported by competent authorities. Elements charged with 
terrorism should not be allowed to be brought into or employed 
in the country. 
  3. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee declares that it 
stands firmly against any negligence or procrastination in the 
adoption of firm legal measures by competent authorities against 
those involved in acts of terrorism and sabotage. 
  4. Whoever shelters or hides a defendant concerning whom a 
notice has been issued by the official agencies or an escapee 
from prison shall be considered a law breaker, and legal 
measures shall be taken against him. 
  5. A plan shall be worked out to arrest the fugitives and 
demand, via Interpol or through diplomatic channels, that non-

<H3>  Second: [as published] The Bases for Building a Modern State 
and Its Institutions </H3>
  The major task is to build the state, correcting the faults 
that have surfaced over the past period. Experience of the past 
years since the proclamation of the establishment of the 
Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990 has shown that the way the 
country was run obstructed the merger of the two previous 
systems and the building of the unity state. 
  From this premise, the dialogue of the political forces has 
sought to leave the crisis atmosphere behind and to proceed 
within a serious democratic atmosphere that will achieve 
stability and balanced economic and social development and that 
will enhance national unity. That is why, in addition to the 
general bases and principles, this document focuses on defining 
the bodies of the central and local authorities, their 
prerogatives and their tasks in order to prevent interference 
and the intermingling of duties which causes confusion and leads 
to crises. 
<H5>  1. General Bases and Principles </H5>
  The following bases and principles shall constitute the 
foundation for building the state and its institutions to 
establish a state where order and law prevails. These bases also 
secure the establishment of a modern Yemeni state on the 
following: 
  1. Islam as faith and law. 
  2. All powers emanate from the people. They exercise these 
powers in a direct manner, or through a referendum and general 
elections. They also exercise these powers in an indirect manner 
through the legislative, executive, and judicial institutions 
and through elected local councils. 
  3. The Republic of Yemen is an Islamic and Arab country and 
Arabic is its official language. 
  4. Yemeni unity and republican system. 
  5. National unity is the basis for safeguarding and 
enhancing 
its pillars. 
  6. Democracy, the peaceful transfer of power, and political 
and party pluralism. 
  7. Administrative and financial decentralization are part of 
the bases of the system of government. 
  8. Protection of public liberties. 
  9. Respect for human rights. 
  10. Freedom of trade union and professional activities, as 
well as of intellectual and cultural creativity. 
  11. Encouragement of scientific research in all walks of 
life. 

<H5>    II. The State Institutions: </H5>
  It was one of the major targets of all participants in the 
dialogue committee and of all proposals that have been submitted 
to the committee to build the state, develop its institutions 
and central and noncentral departments, and to complete the 
issuance of its laws, regulations, and statutes. This is based 
on their desire to rectify the course of our new unity and 
democratic experiment and to build the state of law, order, and 
institutions, a state that follows decentralized administrative 
and financial methods to run the affairs of the united Yemeni 
state. These methods should be able to absorb the state's 
national requirements that are based on local government and its 
law-governed specializations in the fields of development, 
services, administration, and finance. 
<H5>  III. The Central Authority Institutions: </H5>

assist the chairman and the vice chairman in accordance with 
bylaws that regulate the council's activities. 
<H5>  4. The Government </H5>
  The Council of Ministers is the government of the Republic 
of 
Yemen. It is the state's supreme executive and administrative 
agency. All of the state's executive administrations, agencies, 
and institutions, without any exception, are affiliated with it. 
  By adopting administrative and financial decentralization, 
the Government is responsible for foreign affairs, the Armed 
Forces, the public security, the currency, and the sovereign 
resources. It is also responsible for formulating the 
financial, monetary, economic, social, and cultural policies and 
for proposing draft laws and supervising their implementation. 
  The Government is fully and collectively answerable to the 
House of Representatives. 
<H5>  5. The Judiciary </H5>
  The judiciary comprises the Republic's Supreme Court and the 
courts specified by law, as well as the public prosecution. The 
judiciary is fully independent. Members of the Supreme Court, 
who must be practicing judges and lawyers qualified in Islamic 
shari'ah and law, are elected by the Consultative Council for 
life. The term of the Supreme Court's member expires with 
either death or when the member reaches retirement, or when he 
violates the profession's ethics. In this case, he shall be 
dismissed and will never be allowed to work in the judicial 
system. The Constitution and law shall specify the tasks and 
powers, and methods of electing and dismissing members of the 
judiciary. 
<H5>  IV. Local Government </H5>
  The desired local government system is based on 
administrative and financial decentralization under the umbrella 
of the single Yemeni state. It is also based on the principle 
of large-scale popular participation in government and a 
democratic course enhancing national unity. Citizens of the 
republic in the various administrative divisions shall exercise 
their constitutional rights and fulfill their duties in a way 
that will enable them to engage in a positive competition to 
build the edifice of the single Yemeni state through the 
economic and social prosperity of its administrative units and 
the establishment of justice, security, stability, and wellbeing. 
<H5>  V. The Administrative Division </H5>
  The local government is based on a new administrative 
division of the Republic of Yemen that overcomes the existing 
administrative structures and units, and which will help to 
fully integrate the country in such a way that will terminate 
all manifestations of fragmentation and emphasize national unity 
and the new Yemen. 
  This division must be based on scientific principles that 
take into account population and geographic factors and the 
entire economic, social, and services conditions of the 
population, and must provide the basic pillar for balanced 
development. On that basis, the republic shall be divided into 
four to seven administrative units called makhalif [provinces]. 
Sanaa, the political capital, and Aden, the economic and trade 
capital, shall constitute independent administrative units 
(municipalities). They both shall be considered separate legal 
entities and shall enjoy financial and administrative 
independence. They will have their own elected councils in 
accordance with the principles and regulations specified by law. 
The status of Aden as a free zone must be taken into 
consideration. 
<H5>  VI. Powers of the Local Government </H5>
  The local government is based on the principle of direct, 
free, and fair elections of its agencies. Councils of 
government must be elected and enjoy full administrative and 
financial powers that will enable them to run the 
administrative, development, and services affairs of that unit 
on the basis of positive competition within the framework of 
unity. The task of building the country can be distributed by 
moving some of the affairs of the central administration to the 
local government agencies. These can be summed up as follows: 

<H5>    Financial, Administrative, Economic, and Social Affairs </H5>
<H5>  1. Administrative Affairs </H5>
  The local government in the administrative units shall run 
the affairs of the citizens and employees. The local government 
is fully responsible for the issues of labor, education, health, 
municipalities, social and economic affairs, and cultural 
activities within the administrative unit in accordance with the 
general policy of the state. The local government is also in 
charge of road building, city planning, and other works that do 
not fall within the framework of the state's sovereign tasks. 
The local government is also in charge of organizing the 
relationship with the central departments with regard to these 
activities on the following bases: 
  a. General planning and supervision are the tasks of the 
central administration. 
  b. Planning at the level of the administrative unit, 
participation in the general planning, and full responsibility 
for implementing these plans are the task of the local 
government. 
<H5>  2. Financial Affairs </H5>
  Decentralization in the financial field is considered the 
basis of the local government. This should produce high 
efficiency in mobilizing financial revenues and higher 
efficiency in utilization. 
  For further clarification, a line should be drawn between 
the 
resources that fall within the powers of the local government 
and the ones that fall within the sovereign resources: 
<H5>  The Sovereign Resources </H5>
  -- Customs revenues. 
  -- Income taxes on the profits of companies working on the 
level of the republic. 
  -- The state shares from the annual profits of the general 
enterprises working on the level of the republic. 
  -- Returns on oil, gas, minerals, and fisheries. 
  -- Any other sovereign resources defined by the law. 
<H5>  a. Water Resources </H5>
  The water resources count as resources of the sovereign, 
and, 
therefore, their development and rationing use are of vital 
importance. They should be developed and used in accordance 
with rules and controls set out by law defining the relevant 
responsibilities of the central and local governments. 
<H5>  b. Local Resources </H5>
  -- Local fees decreed by a decision issued by the 
administrative unit in accordance with a law that defines the 
powers and bases on which decisions are made and systems worked 
out by the local councils. 
  -- Taxes on income, free enterprise, and commercial 
activity in the context of the local unit. 
  -- Returns on economic activity in the context of the 
administrative unit. 
  -- Alms. 
  -- Tax and fees on khat. 
  -- Tax on real estate 
  -- Traffic, transportation, and land fees. 
  -- Environment protection tax. 
  -- Support offered by the central budget. 
  These definitions are not exclusive; they are given by way 
of 
explanation only. Sovereignty and local resources shall be 
defined by law. 
  Regarding spending, the spending listed in the annual budget 
of the local unit includes the social services and economic 
activity of the general units falling under the umbrella of the 
local unit and other related activities. Local spending does 
not cover items centrally funded, like key highways and other 
transport systems linking units or strategic projects, such as 
oil and gas and key minerals. 
  -- The Central Bank will set up branches in the 
administrative units to handle part of its major functions.

  [Text] 
<H5>  3. Economic Affairs: </H5>
  As part of the policy of economic freedom, administrative 
units will compete with each other to establish their own 
economic bases with their known components: Production, 
distribution, job opportunities, investment opportunities, and 
improvement of social services and care for citizens in each 
administrative unit. Competition will prompt local government 
agencies to do their best, and they will be directly responsible 
for their actions. Performance will be measured in accordance 
with these agencies' handling of their tasks and 
responsibilities. In case of failure, the local government 
authorities will not shirk responsibility by blaming the central 
authority, which would happen if there was a confusion of 
responsibilities. The government will devote its efforts to 
planning within the framework of the general and main 
objectives. The government will also monitor implementation, a 
task which will be facilitated by two factors: 
  1. The general objectives that it will define will be based 
on the needs of each administrative unit. 
  2. Monitoring the implementation will start from within each 
administrative unit through the voters. This will ensure the 
achievement of the set objectives. 
<H5>  4. Police and Security: </H5>
  Security will be among the direct responsibilities of the 
local government in various administrative units. Each 
administrative unit will be responsible for running the affairs 
of its police and security force within the national general 
security plan. The police and security forces will carry out 
their responsibilities in accordance with the Interior 
Ministry's regulations and rules. These forces will receive 
orders from the local authorities. Their armament will be 
unified and their rights and obligations will be set in 
accordance with the law. Their size will depend on the need of 
each administrative unit. The local authority will be directly 
responsible for security within the boundaries of each 
administrative unit. The general security plan supervised by 
the Interior Ministry will coordinate security activity among 
the administrative units and will monitor security activity in 
all administrative units in accordance with the law. 
<H5>  5. Education: </H5>
  A. A unified national educational plan will be worked out. 
Local government councils in administrative units will see that 
this is implemented on the basis of positive interaction among 
them to offer the best proposals regarding both the educational 
institution and curricula. 
  B. Technical schools and training centers are under the 
direct responsibility of the local government. This 
responsibility will also cover the training of teachers and 
meeting schools needs for teachers. 
  C. The Koran teaching schools and establishing new ones fall 
under the responsibility of the local government. 
  D. With regard to higher education, the local government 
will abide by the higher education plan and policy and the 
development requirements in various fields in the republic. 
<H5>  6. Health and Other Services: </H5>
  A. With the exception of combating epidemics nationwide and 
following a national medical policy according to unified 
standards, the local government will be responsible for health, 
doctors, supervision of hospitals and health units and devising 
a system for controlling them, granting licenses, controlling

Rules: </H3>
  A. All civil servants and other employees will be subjected

organizational structure in accordance with the nature of the 
tasks assigned to it.

and each subunit will be given special municipal tasks. 
  8. The councils of the administrative subunits will elect 
the heads and members of its executive offices. The appointment 
of the office heads will be announced in a prime minister's

<H5>  Rebuilding and Reorganizing the Armed Forces </H5>
  Rebuilding and reorganizing the Armed Forces is one of the 
primary issues. The Armed Forces are directly affiliated with 
the Government. No military or paramilitary force belonging to 
any other side shall be formed. The general plan to reform, 
merge, reconstruct, and reorganize the Armed Forces will be 
prepared in accordance with the following principles: 
  1. The Yemeni Armed Forces are defense forces responsible 
for protecting the Yemeni Republic's borders, waters, and air 
space, and to defend national sovereignty. 
  2. The Defense Ministry's budget must be controlled to 
enable it to play its role in accordance with the requirements 
of defending the Yemeni Republic. 
  3. The size of the Armed Forces will be confined to three 
arms: land, sea, and air. No force will be allowed to exist and 
no units will be allowed to be formed in contravention of that 
and outside the three aforementioned arms. 
  4. The required formations of the Armed Forces, which will 
be suitable to the operations theater, will be defined in 
accordance with what the competent authorities see fit within 
the conditions and in accordance with requirements of defending 
the sovereignty and independence of the Yemeni Republic. 
  5. The material and human resources and the proposed 
formations will be completed after they have been defined by 
reconstituting and reorganizing the current formations. 
  6. After determining their size and formations and 
completing their material and human resources, the Armed Forces 
will be positioned in accordance with the following priorities. 
  A. Deploying units at border areas. 
  B. Protecting sites of economic activities for operating 
companies. 
  C. Reorganizing and redeploying the rest of the units in 
the inland regions according to needs and to function as a 
reserve. This is in line with the principle of reducing the 
current size of the Armed Forces, based on the following: 
  -- Retirement according to the terms of the service and the 
bonus and salary law. 
  -- Retiring military officials employed by civilian 
government institutions. 
  -- Opening the door for early voluntary retirement. 
  7. Abiding by the Political Parties and Organizations Law by 
disallowing party activity in the Armed Forces and the security 
agencies. 
  8. Dividing the republic into military zones. 
  9. Reformulating the Military Service Law to stress the 
following: 
  -- Joining the Armed Forces is a national right and duty for 
all the sons of Yemen. This principle must be embodied through 
the composition of the Armed Forces, without any discrimination 
or preferences. 
  -- Senior Armed Forces and security officials shall spend 
five years maximum in senior posts. 
  -- The Armed Forces should set an example of national 
unity. Its staff are to be selected based on qualifications and 
experience, away from party and political congresses and family, 
rural, regional, ethnic, and religious affiliations. The Armed 
Forces shall be reorganized on these bases until there is no 
military unit subject to the above influences. 
<H5>  2 - 4 The Official Media </H5>
  A national body shall be formed comprising qualified 
national 
media figures to supervise it and to do the planning for the 
official media agencies. This body shall replace the ministry 
to ensure that it will serve the community, away from 
discrimination against any political side and to enable it to 
perform its media and educational role and message. 
<H5>  2 - 5 Education </H5>
  Stressing the unification of curricula in all schools, 
colleges, and universities and removing the distortions in these 
curricula. Also, making intensive efforts to modernize academic 
curricula to catch up with modern developments and working to 
build up a Yemeni generation that has a unified national vision 
and creed. 
<H5>  2 - 6 The Higher National Security Council </H5>
  1. A higher national security council shall be established 
in 
Yemen. This council will be responsible for doing research, 
conducting studies, and making recommendations for the 
presidency of the state and the government. The purpose is to 
protect national sovereignty and enhance our country's relations 
with Arab and other countries in light of new world 
developments. The council will also carefully study ways to 
spare our country disasters, crises, and upheavals witnessed in 
most Third World nations. 
  2. The council shall have duties and bylaws to govern its 
activity and shall be established by a law. 
  3. The council shall comprise specialists in political, 
military, security and socioeconomic affairs. 
<H5>  2 - 7 The Control and Accountability Agency </H5>
  The role of the Central Agency for Control and 
Accountability 
should be activated as a control agency independent of the 
executive branch and that is directly linked with the 
legislative branch. This agency should be committed to its 
public reports. The government will have its own tool for 
advance and future control of local and central executive 
agencies. 
  The control agencies should have strong, qualified, and 
neutral elements that can withstand all pressures and any 
attempts that obstructs their duties or try to use them for 
political purposes or favoritism. 
<H5>  2 - 8 Civil Service Reform </H5>
  Civil service reforms must be subject to a thorough study of 
the current situation, including regulations, practical 
measures, and measuring performance. Since the human is the 
foundation of administration, reform should be geared toward 
human resources in the first place. Also, regulations and 
practical measures should be reformulated in line with the 
following: 
  A. Simplicity and clarity of regulations to facilitate their 
understanding and implementation. 
  B. A precise and sound definition of duties, 
responsibilities, and powers. 
  C. Laying constant foundations to delegate powers on all 
central and local levels. 
  D. Preparing administrative bylaws and work regulations 
precisely. 
  E. Preparing a working guide for citizens' formalities in 
all 
fields. 
  In addition to the importance of preparing bylaws, the 
significance of the human element in administration should 
require the following: 
  1. Enhancing the continuous training process of scientific 
and technical leaderships and the administrative cadres. 
  2. Providing a suitable environment for work and finding new 
job opportunities. 
  3. Stressing the disinterestedness of the administration and 
considering civil service as both a right and duty. 
Appointments to all administrative posts will be subject to the 
terms of the civil service and the valid bylaws, laws, and 
regulations. Posts of deputy ministers and above will be 
considered political posts. 
  4. Forming specialized administration courts to resolve 
issues of administrative violations within a period not 
exceeding six months from the signing of the document. 
  5. Forming a general civil service organization instead of a 
ministry. This will be affiliated with the cabinet. 
<H5>  Economy and Financial Organization </H5>
  The failure to complete the structure of the Yemeni state 
has 
directly affected economic and financial conditions. One of the 
most obvious effects of the absence of the unity of the state's 
political establishment is that the country has been left 
without a clear financial and economic policy to organize this 
vital sector. Clear economic policy has been missing since the 
first day of our experiment in unity, despite the fact that our 
declared policy was economic freedom. However, this policy was 
not been consummated to allow the economy to be built within its 
framework. Trouble and concern grew and anarchy displaced 
organization. With the absence of political unity and decisive 
measures, general expenditure became a source of increasing 
anarchy that was reflected in the national currency and led to 
the deterioration in the rial's purchasing power. It led to a 
disruption in productive economic activities such as agriculture 
and industry. Prices soared and the real value of people's 
income dropped because of the deterioration of the national 
currency. All this was in addition to the rampant deficit in 
the general budget. Therefore, the economic reform process, 
within the policy of economic freedom and through a number of 
urgent measures to stop the deterioration, becomes very 
important. 
  Based on all this and in order to come up with an integrated 
policy that will be combined and completed within a process of 
reforming the entire system of government, the following steps 
should be taken: 
  1. Abiding by a general state budget that specifies 
expenditures and revenues and seeks to end the growing deficit 
resulting from the huge gap between expenditures and revenues. 
This can be achieved by emphasizing increasing revenues and 
curtailing and organizing expenditures, within the limits of 
what is needed; 
  2. Following balanced development plans and annual 
investment programs to guarantee balanced economic and social 
development; 
  3. Adjusting the monetary system to stop the deterioration 
of the national currency and activating the role of the Central 
Bank and organizing its functions in a way that does not run 
counter to the functions of the commercial banks; also, taking 
the necessary and practical measures to protect the currency, 
including the issuing of the new currency that was agreed upon, 
regulating money exchangers' activities, and fighting currency 
counterfeiting; 
  4. Fighting corruption, bribes, and administrative 
negligence and uncovering smugglers of goods, commodities, 
weapons, and drugs and punishing them in accordance with the 
valid laws; 
  5. Implementing the decisions pertaining to the 
establishment 
of a free zone in Aden; executive measures must begin 
immediately and all measures must be completed by the end of 
this year; 
  6. Organizing and supervising the activity of public 
institutions and public companies, especially activity that 
affects the foreign currency that may be used to finance 
activities that exhaust the economy; 
  7. Making a quick decision about which of the raw materials 
needed for basic national industries, and the resources needed 
in agriculture, fisheries, and other production activities, are 
to be treated the same way as foodstuffs financed by the Central 
Bank, in order to stop the increase in the price of these 
materials and the deterioration of this vital activity of the 
national economy. 

<H5>    4. Constitutional Amendment: </H5>
  As the Constitution is a document of great importance in our 
people's present and future life, the following should be 
observed: 
  A. Abiding by the current Constitution until it is amended. 
  B. In order to Implement the content of the accord document 
and to make the necessary Constitutional amendments, serious 
efforts should be exerted to carry out these Constitutional 
amendments within three to five months. A national committee 
consisting of ulema, parties to the Political Forces Dialogue, 
some specialists from Aden and Sanaa universities, and some 
social figures should be formed to draft Constitutional 
amendments, taking into account the fact that draft 
Constitutional amendments should not conflict with general 
principles and fundamentals, as well as the missions and powers 
of bodies and ways of their formation in the accord document of 
the Political Forces Dialogue. The committee will take full 
time to do its work within the fixed period. 
  C. Reconsidering the overall parliamentary and local 
production system, particularly election by list in light of a 
scientific study of Yemeni and other human experiences. The 
election law will be reconsidered in light of the results of 
that study. 
<H5>  5. Implementation Mechanism: </H5>
  To ensure the implementation of this national document, 
which 
is aimed at correcting the course of unity and building a modern 
Yemeni state, a state of order and law, every national official 
and popular energy should be mobilized. Therefore, the 
following mechanism should be adopted: 
  A. The government shall have full power and be free from 
interference in its work in order to allow it to carry out its 
duties. 
  B. The government will draw up timetables to carry out 
specific duties within one month. 
  C. Anything in the document requiring a Constitutional 
amendment should be observed as soon as the Constitutional 
amendments are approved. Some duties should also be prepared 
along with the preparation of the draft Constitutional 
amendments. An issue that does not require a Constitutional 
amendment will be carried out immediately. 
  D. Measures by the government to implement the document and 
the policy statement should be taken publicly. 
  E. A monthly news conference should be held to define 
progress in implementing the duties; a government spokesman will 
be appointed. 
<H5>  6. The Follow-Up Mechanism </H5>
  1. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee shall follow up 
and supervise the implementation of the decisions enshrined in 
the accord document signed by the parties to the Political 
Forces Dialogue to build a modern Yemeni state. 
  2. Executive decisions will be made granting the committee 
the following: 
  A. The right to obtain information from any source, 
particularly to the extent that it will help the committee carry 
out its duties. 
  B. The right to have access to the media to propagate 
statements detailing progress in the implementation of the 
document, the obstacles hindering it, and those who may by 
obstructing it, whether individuals or bodies. 
  C. The government shall make available to the committee its 
official and administrative capabilities to help it fulfill its 
functions. 
<H3>  7. The Security Arrangements and Circumstances Needed for 
Signing and Implementing the Agreement. </H3>
  A committee is to be formed from among the parties to the 
dialogue to work out security conditions for signing the 
document and guarantees for initiating implementation in 
coordination with the president and his deputy. The date shall 
be fixed in accordance with the agreed arrangements. 
  Conclusion: The completion of such work must be the result 
of a powerful political will to engage in vigorous work and 
honor promises and obligations. The aim is to safeguard unity 
and protect the republic and our democratic choice and confirm 
our people's will to achieve their objectives--security, 
stability, and the affluence of the individual.

yesterday arrested an Islamist in connection with the recent 
explosions. Some sources said he belongs to the Islamic Action 
Front [IAF], but IAF sources denied that. 
  According to informed sources, the new arrest raises the 
number of detainees to over 50. The competent authorities, 
however, are expected to release about 13 other detainees who 
were arrested for interrogation but were found not guilty. 
  The prime minister had earlier told the House deputies that 
the investigation will take its course and that all who had 
nothing to do with the recent explosions will be released.

  [Text] Tripoli, Al Nowar 20 [Feb] (JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS 
AGENCY)--The leader of the revolution [Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi] 
made the following statement to JANA: The ultimatum on Sarajevo 
is merely a cat and mouse game. The solution to the problem of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina does not lie in the shelling of 
particular armed positions for this is absurd and ridiculous. 
It is a cover up for there are two issues which are separate 
from each other. They are the racial annihilation of Muslims 
and the political issue of the Republic of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina as far as the method of governing it and the 
representation of each party. This is purely a political 
problem which does not require weapons nor be solved by 
shelling. But the annihilation of Muslims is another issue and 
beyond Sarajevo. For Muslims are being annihilated everywhere 
in Yugoslavia and not in Sarajevo. The shelling of some 
positions has nothing to do with this even if it stopped the 
annihilation of Muslims. We are with the Serbs in the political 
problem of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and against 
them in the racial annihilation of Muslims which is not at all a 
political issue.

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Feb (MENA)--A ranking Libyan diplomatic 
source in Cairo has denied that Libya is any way connected to 
the assassination of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'aytah in 
Lebanon recently. 
  The source said in statements today that Libya condemns 
terrorism in all its forms and that it has cut off all relations 
with any groups that follow a course of violence instead of 
dialogue and peaceful negotiations. He denied the presence of 
Abu-Nidal's [Sabri al-Banna] group on Libyan territory. He also 
denied that any Libyan officials had met with any members or 
leaders belonging to Abu-Nidal's group recently. 
  The Libyan source believes that raising Libya's name in 
relation to the assassination of the Jordanian diplomat, as some 
newspaper reports have done, is an attempt to sour 
Jordanian-Libyan relations, especially during this phase of 
peace. He stressed Libya's interest in its relations with 
Lebanon.

<F P=106> [Commentary by "JANA's international affairs editor"] </F>
  [Text] The British defense minister announced that Britain 
is studying the development of its own defense system, claiming 
that countries such as Libya constitute a nuclear threat to 
Britain. The British newspaper THE DAILY EXPRESS reported this 
statement, coupling it by saying that Libya will be able to 
manufacture nuclear weapons within 10 years. 
  JANA's international affairs editor commented by saying: 
This British official statement is further proof that the 
Christians are attacking the Muslims within the framework of the 
Christian-Jewish alliance against Islam. The nuclear weapons 
that now exist include 200 nuclear warheads owned by the Jews 
who occupy Palestine, and they admit owning them despite their 
refusal to sign the Nonproliferation Treaty. No one has talked 
about these nuclear warheads. No one mentioned them or asked 
for their removal. 
  As for Libya, the peaceful country that neither has the 
capability to own nuclear weapons nor is interested in or 
thinking of owning nuclear weapons, and which is subject to the 
annual inspection by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] because of its signing of the Nonproliferation Treaty, 
it is accused of this [constituting a danger] and other similar 
accusations, as if its signing of the Nonproliferation Treaty 
and the regular IAEA inspection are not sufficient. This shows 
that the reason for these and other accusations is the fact that 
the Libyan weapons are not directed against the Arabs. Since 
the Jewish weapons are directed against the Arabs and Muslims 
this is allowed and there are no objections to it. 
  Why? The answer is simply the fact that in the eyes of the 
Christians and Jews the Arabs are animals or a race that no one 
wants and should be annihilated. 
  The editor added: Through this statement the world can see 
the practices of terrorism against peaceful peoples. This 
statement, and the statements that preceded it by the U.S. 
President, saying that Libya constitutes an extraordinary 
danger, are in themselves real, unprecedented terrorism 
practiced by superpowers against a peaceful country. 
  The international affairs editor concluded his comment by 
saying: 
  These are the characteristics of the new world order to 
which 
they call: Terrorism, Jewish and Christian alliance against all 
non-Jewish religions such as Islam, Buddhism, and Confucianism, 
in order to establish Jewish and Christian control over the 
whole world.

  [Excerpts] In a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Dr. 
'Atif Sidqi last night, the Cabinet discussed a program for 
national action during the current stage that includes an 
integrated strategy for all fields of action, Information 
Minister Safwat al-Sharif said at the end of the meeting. 
  During the special session, Dr. Sidqi noted that elements of 
stability in Egypt strengthen its ability to play a pivotal role 
in the region and the world. He pointed out that the phenomenon 
of terrorism does not affect Egypt's political or economic 
progress, and the people of Egypt, with their culture and 
tenacity, will continue the march of development and progress 
and face all challenges with complete confidence in a bright and 
stable future. [passage omitted] 
  The Cabinet also discussed a program for international 
cooperation to fight terrorism. The program includes a report 
prepared by the Cabinet expressing appreciation for the positive 
role played by several countries in providing important 
information for coordinating the fight against terrorism. The 
report notes the need to extend bridges of cooperation with more 
countries to collectively confront terrorist organizations, 
expedite the conclusion of cooperation agreements with a number 
of countries on combating terrorism, and regularly supply 
countries with the facts about terrorist practices and the 
popular reaction to these crimes. [passage omitted]

committed to all its pledges and hopes that the two sides will 
reach agreement. He added that the important thing is resuming 
the Palestinian-Israeli talks and reaching an agreement as soon 
as possible on the implementation of the Declaration of 
Principles, especially as the two sides made progress in the 
negotiations held in Taba last week.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Feb (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
today telephoned his Turkish counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, and 
reviewed with him the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was 
disclosed by Minister Musa, who pointed out that Egypt and 
Turkey are holding constant consultations over this issue. 
  Answering a question on the approaching deadline given to 
the 
Bosnian Serbs with regard to weapons withdrawal from Sarajevo, 
the Egyptian foreign minister told news reporters that the Serbs 
will have to withdraw all their heavy weapons to a distance of 
20 km from Sarajevo. The removal of heavy guns, he added, 
should be comprehensive and not partial. 
  The foreign minister said that in the case of the partial 
withdrawal of weapons, the NATO's responsibility will continue. 
With the expiration of the deadline, Musa said, one of two 
things should take place: either the total withdrawal of all 
guns or a strike at Serbian positions. 
  Asked about the situation in other parts of Bosnia, Minister 
Musa said that decisions concerning Sarajevo should be 
applicable to other besieged areas of Bosnia. 
  Concerning his meeting with the Israeli ambassador in Cairo 
today, Minister Musa said that the meeting dealt with the 
Palestinian-Israeli talks that will be held in Cairo tomorrow, 
Monday. 
  Asked about reports of agreements or security arrangements 
reached between Iran and some Gulf countries and how such a 
development would affect the Damascus Declaration, Minister Musa 
said that these arrangements are still just news reports. The 
Egyptian foreign minister said that there is no indication of 
official movement in this direction.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Feb (MENA)--Commenting on reports that the 
Serbs have begun withdrawing their heavy weapons from around 
Sarajevo, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said today that the 
beginning of the implementation of this withdrawal must lead to 
total withdrawal so that we will be assured that no other 
aggression will take place against Sarajevo. 
  Musa said if the work to lift the siege of Sarajevo 
succeeds, 
it is necessary and desirable that this also be done at other 
besieged towns. Thus, several aspects of Serb aggression can be 
dealt with and a settlement process can begin in a better 
atmosphere. 
  Musa added that Egypt is closely watching the situation. It 
will continue its contacts with the states concerned. He 
explained that Egypt is maintaining contacts with the European 
states. It is also maintaining contact with the Islamic state 
[Bosnia Herzegovina] within the context of the Islamic 
Conference Organization's interest in this issue.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, 21 Feb (MENA)--Cairo papers appearing 
tomorrow, Tuesday, criticize NATO for failing to carry out its 
ultimatum and attack Serbian positions encircling Sarajevo. 
  The newspaper AL-AKHBAR denounces the Russian position, 
which 
it says opposes aerial attacks against the criminals of Serbia. 
  The paper says that the Serbian forces have failed to 
withdraw all their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo and that 
the Russians cite the fall of rain and snow as a reason for this 
failure. The paper adds that the weapons that have been 
withdrawn are being kept nearby for convenient retrieval and 
reuse as soon as the crisis caused by the NATO ultimatum blows 
over. 
  AL-AKHBAR warns that the situation will remain unchanged and 
that the Bosnian people will remain prey to the ethnic cleansing 
policy that Serbs have pursued unchallenged for the past two 
years. 
  Another newspaper, AL-WAFD, asserts that NATO has lost its 
credibility by failing to implement its threat against Bosnian 
Serbs. NATO, the world's mightiest power, braced itself for 
action on a promise to salvage the credibility of the 
international community, punish the Serbian aggressors, and 
protect the Bosnian people, but failed to stay the course, 
leaving the tragedy unchanged and the aggressors unpunished. 
  AL-WAFD warns that the weapons that were said to have been 
withdrawn from the Serbian positions have actually been hidden 
for later use. The paper denounces the Russian position, which 
it says is one of unabashed and unflinching support for the 
Serbs. 
  Another daily, AL-JUMHURIYAH, says that the main force 
shaping the U.S.-European position on Bosnia was not public 
opinion as much as Europe's need for security and stability. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH denounces Russian support for the Serbs. It 
says that following the collapse of the Soviet Union, unbridled 
ethnic tensions broke out in Moscow, influencing the Russian 
decision to side with the Serbs. 
  The paper adds that, due to the change in the international 
political scene, European and U.S. pressure in the Adriatic has 
made the Serbs relax their grip on Sarajevo, or at least pretend 
to do so.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Groups opposed to peace with 
Israel have launched a media campaign against the mufti of 
Egypt, accusing him of hosting a conference on the Middle East 
conflict attended by Israelis. 
  Mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi denied in press comments 
Monday 
[21 February] that he knew that Israelis had attended a 
conference he sponsored on trying to settle the conflict through 
psychological analysis. 
  But the AL-'ARABI newspaper, mouthpiece of the Nasirist 
pan-Arab party, quoted conference chairman Jamal Madi 
Abu-al-'Azayim as saying Tantawi had met all the participants, 
including the Israelis, at his office. 
  Tantawi is the most prominent religious figure in Egypt, 
along with the al-Azhar Muslim Academy chairman, Shaykh 
Jad-al-Haq 'Ali Jad-al-Haq. 
  The Israeli delegation to the conference numbered 15 members 
and was headed by former ambassador to Egypt Shim'on Shamir, 
according to opposition sources. 
  Columnist Fahmi Huwaydi told AFP "the Islamic world will 
suffer a shock when it finds out that the Mufti of Egypt met an 
Israeli delegation" in a Moslem site. 
  He also said government censorship last week had prevented 
him from publishing an editorial to denounce the meeting. 
  Although Egypt signed in 1979 a peace treaty with Israel, 
relations are almost restricted to official contacts. President 
Anwar al-Sadat was assassinated in 1981 by Moslem militants for 
having signed the treaty. 
  Egypt is the only Arab country which has signed a peace 
treaty with the Jewish state.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the Taba talks, in Cairo, Egypt, by 
Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio, from the "With the Midday Events" 
program; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Sha'th] I think this week's negotiations, which 
concluded in Taba yesterday, were positive and made some measure 
of progress. We would like our talks to lead to implementation 
on the ground so that ordinary Palestinians may come to feel 
real change. We have wrapped up discussions on a significant 
portion of the issues bearing on the transfer of civilian powers 
to the national Palestinian authority. The water issue remains 
to be addressed. We have finished with the issues of 
archaeology, regional planning, and wire and wireless 
communications. An agreement on relevant papers will be worked 
out next Monday here in Cairo. We also had exhaustive 
discussions concerning the release of Palestinian detainees. 
After the Red Cross team's visit to Taba, we now have all the 
relevant papers and figures. I believe that next Monday will 
see us achieve further progress. We also agreed in principle on 
launching a Palestinian television station and radio station on 
the medium wave. Regarding the Security Committee, it looked at 
a draft report on the composition of Palestinian police and 
security arrangements in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region. 
I believe that progress was also made there. However, there 
are numerous points that need to be cleared by the political 
leaders. We will wait until next week to see progress made 
there. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, have you begun drafting the points on 
which agreement was reached so that they may be presented to 
your respective political leaders? 
  [Sha'th] We are now formulating everything. There is no 
time left for discussions in a vacuum. All our negotiations 
address papers, item by item. 
  [Mu'addi] Do you see the outstanding issues being resolved 
next week? 
  [Sha'th] As much as I would like this to happen, it is hard 
for me to predict that much. As I have said, the Israeli side 
looks at certain matters as being mere symbols of sovereignty, 
while, in fact, they are highly significant symbols of national 
Palestinian identity and the national Palestinian authority. 
Things like passports, postage stamps, an international 
telephone code, and other such issues are essential to the 
Palestinian character and entity, even though these do not, as 
yet, imply the existence of a Palestinian state, because the 
Palestinian state has still to come into being. 
  [Mu'addi] Do you expect an agreement on all issues to be 
finalized by 'Id al-Fitr [on or about 13 March]? 
  [Sha'th] That is what I hope will happen. It would then be 
glad news for our people that will make the 'Id doubly happy. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the chief Palestinian negotiator 
in Taba, Thank you so much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

  [Text] Dr. Hamid al-Ghabid, secretary general of the 
Islamic Conference Organization [ICO], has urged the world 
community to take note of the serious violation of human rights 
by India in occupied Kashmir. Addressing the Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva yesterday, he said that the Indian 
occupation forces are resorting to the most brutal means to 
crush the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people for their 
right to self-determination. He said that the Indian forces 
during the last four years have badly trampled the basic rights 
of the Kashmiri people. Dr. al-Ghabid said that the continuous 
curfew in occupied Kashmir has crippled the people's life. He 
said that the ICO at its summit and foreign minister-level 
conferences has repeatedly appealed to peacefully resolve the 
Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN resolutions. 
  The leader of the Pakistani delegation at the Human Rights 
Commission, which is meeting in Geneva, has said that Pakistan 
has made persistent efforts to hold purposeful talks with India 
on the Kashmir issue, but India never responded positively to 
the Pakistani proposals to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir 
problem. He said this while addressing the ICO meeting in 
Geneva yesterday which reviewed the draft resolution on the 
Jammu and Kashmir issue. The meeting was held after the the ICO 
secretary general's address to the Human Rights Commission. He 
said that Pakistan wants a resolution which calls for sending a 
fact-finding mission to occupied Jammu and Kashmir to assess the 
grave situation there. The Islamic countries' ambassadors 
expressed serious concern over the serious violation of human 
rights in the occupied Kashmir. They noted that although a 
number of resolutions were adopted at the ICO ministerial and 
summit meetings, but there was no improvement in the situation. 
The ambassadors lauded Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto's 
address to the Human Rights Commission.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has played down the 
significance of an Israeli delegation receiving an invitation to 
visit Damascus, calling it too little, too late. According to 
the prime minister, the Syrians have again failed to show even 
one percent of the goodwill shown by Anwar al-Sadat when he 
proved he was ready for peace. 
  Speaking to Spanish and Portuguese reporters today before 
his 
visit to the Iberian Peninsula next week, the prime minister 
revealed that Damascus insisted that the Israeli Arab delegation 
travel without their Israeli passports. 
  [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew at 
1800 
GMT on 18 February reports that "Our political correspondent 
'Imanu'el Rosen adds that sources in Jerusalem claimed that the 
initiative for the trip came from the prime minister. Knesset 
Member 'Abd-al-Wahab Darawshah, the head of the delegation, 
denied this claim, asserting that the initiative was completely 
his."]

  [Text] Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has 
asserted that Iraq has complied with Security Council Resolution 
687 on weapons of mass destruction and no longer has any of 
these weapons or the capacity to manufacture them. 
  In a statement to Qatari state television last night, he 
said 
that although Iraq implemented the provisions of that 
resolution, it is repeatedly accused of failure to abide by 
international resolutions for political reasons and to maintain 
the blockade imposed on it. 
  He added that U.S.-led foreign parties in the Security 
Council have political purposes unrelated to the Gulf crisis. 
  This is the second time the Qatari television has held an 
interview with Iraqi officials. A week ago, it aired a report 
on the unjust blockade, including an interview with Trade 
Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 22, IRNA -- A spokesman for Iran's 
Foreign Ministry here Tuesday confirmed the emergency landing of 
a missing Iranian helicopter in northern Iraq. The spokesman 
called on the Iraqi Government to furnish Iran with further 
details on the issue through diplomatic channels. 
  The helicopter with two crew members on board was 
disappeared 
three days ago. The pilot in his last contact had reported 
technical failure. The spokesman said he is unable to precisely 
comment on the cause of the emergency landing due to the 
contradictory reports reaching here. 
  According to reports reaching here from the western border 
city of Sanandaj a large number of helicopters conduct flights 
over the region to transport relief aids and maintain security 
in the border region. The authorities in Kordestan Province 
had originally thought that the helicopter had crashed in the 
mountains in northeast of Iran. Informed sources in Kordestan 
said that reports coming from northern Iraq on the whereabouts 
of the helicopter and the fate of its crew are not highly 
reliable.

  [Text] Khartoum, 20 Feb -- A political source described the 
visit of the U.S. ambassador to the Sudan, Donald Nerson [name 
as received] to some areas in the south of the Sudan without 
permission from the Sudanese Government as the violation of the 
national sovereignty of the country and that the U.S. ambassador 
in Khartoum misused of his responsibility and we do not keep 
silence on this regard [sentence as received]. 
  The source said in a statement to SUNA that this act came in 
the context of the open alignment to the rebel movement by the 
United States. 
  The source added that the U.S. ambassador act came in the 
framework of securing the arrival of the war equipments to the 
rebel movement saying that it is a desperate attempt to raise 
the spiritual moral of the rebel forces.

<F P=106> [Address by King Husayn at the opening ceremonies for the </F>
signing of the Yemeni document of pledge and accord at the Royal 
Hashemite Court in Amman -- live] 
  [Text] In the name of God, and peace and prayers be on his 
honest prophet. Your Excellency the chairman of the 
Presidential Council; Your Excellency the vice chairman of the 
Presidential Council; dear brothers: God's peace and mercy be 
upon you, the creme de la creme of the Yemeni people; our people 
and beloved ones, may you enjoy God's protection, and may he 
guide us to what pleases him. 
  You and Yemen, like every remote and wondrous destination 
that can only be reached after one has travelled a distance 
toward it -- a distance we covered over five long months in 
response to the call of duty to brotherhood and to safeguard 
unity and all the hopes and ideals and values that reside in the 
hearts of all the Arabs. Our hopes have been drawn to Sanaa and 
Aden, to the men who have made unity and carried the burden of 
protecting it so it can be a vanguard and contribution to a 
comprehensive Arab awakening in the face of fragmentation, 
divisions, and territorial parochialism -- a reawakening founded 
on freedom and democracy, justice, brotherhood, purity, 
confidence, and complementarity. We began this reawakening 
years ago, when we met as brothers in Arabism and Islam and rid 
ourselves of any parochial benefit or regional sense or minor 
objective, as we went about setting up the Arab Cooperation 
Council with our cousins. We called for the introduction of a 
new age among ourselves, armed with awareness, patience, and 
content. We argued for a joint march seeking good for all the 
Arabs and a mobilization of the nation's energies on the road of 
unity and dignity. We have wanted it to be a march that 
branches out like a blessed tree -- one that does not bow unless 
to offer its bounty to all of us. 
  Let the tree's march be to the heights, in the name of the 
generations that dream of the nation and the Arab message, in 
their human dimensions and awareness, in the shadows of which 
flourish books, universities, schools, banners, cities, and 
villages, where human rights and human dignity are respected, 
and where dreams are nurtured, in the manner of our 
grandfathers, the leaders of the Great Arab Revolt, when they 
surprised the world with the great dream of a united Arab state 
extending from the source of wisdom in Yemen to the sunset of 
'Uqbah Bin-Nafi', standing at the shores of the ocean of darkness 
  If today there is a dream to achieve Arab integration and 
to open new fields of sincere and good cooperation for and among 
all Arabs, let this be in accordance with God's saying: Help 
you one another in righteousness and piety but help you not one 
another in sin and rancor. [Koranic verse] 
  When the Gulf crisis occured and our nation suffered from 
its 
pains, we tried, before it took place, to find an Arab remedy to 
Arab wounds. We acted with all the power and capability we had 
to avert this national catastrophe. Our only objective was to 
please God and satisfy our conscience. But, events took a 
different turn than what we wanted. Despite the divisions and 
the rubble it left behind, we did not despair that a new dawn 
would break after a long dark night, returning the water to its 
course, pure and limpid in the great and boundless river of our 
nation. 
  Brothers, kin folks, and beloved ones, Amman is happy to 
have 
you meet in it. It lost sleep over the disagreement and the 
confrontation that took place between the brothers. Amman is 
also losing sleep over the starvation of the children of the 
nation who are besieged, by the illiteracy of some of its 
generations, by the dryness of some of the nation's trees, and 
by the squandering waste of many of its resources. 
  In this homeland, we have struggled in the face of gloomy 
and 
regrettable surprises. Free Arabs have struggled in many 
locations in this homeland so the image of unity can remain 
vivid in the minds and so our nation can remain, as God almighty 
has wished it, the best of peoples evolved for mankind [Koranic 
verse], rescuing those in distress, justly treating the wronged, 
feeding the hungry, protecting borders, and reassuring the 
frightened. 
  We have sought unity formulas. The Arab League formula was 
not the first of these unity ideas. The first of these ideas 
was an Arab government in Damascus at the time of Faysal 
Bin-Husayn. We welcomed all pan-Arab initiatives. We called 
for establishing a new Arab order. We stood against all foreign 
interference, in the hope that our efforts would succeed in 
healing our Arab wounds, from which we all suffer. We tried to 
prevent any estrangement of the brothers. 
  We still take the same position. If the world around us 
changes, let us change for the better, under the guidance of God 
almighty. This is natural. What does not change are the 
principles firmly embedded in the consciences of men who once 
built the Ma'rib Dam, men who spread the message in and outside 
the peninsula, and their grandsons who rebuilt the dam, upheld 
the edifice of unity, and championed the banner of amity among 
the sons of the one homeland, in the realization of the dream 
that the enemnies of the nation try to shatter and to send into 
oblivion. 
  The document of pledge and accord, drafted by a good group 
of Yemen's sons representing various trends and views, 
demonstrates real national unity and proven the success of the 
principle of pluralism within the framework of unity. It 
demonstrates a comprehensive vision for the subjects under 
discussions by the Yemeni people. 
  The document fixes dates for implementation. It presents 
plans for all of the Constitutional, political, security, and 
legislative fields. It defines general fundamentals and 
principles for building the new state, its central and 
decentralized establishments, and its laws and bylaws. The 
document demonstrates all of this in a comprehensive, accurate, 
and systematic way that will lead, God willing, to an advanced 
model of the state of law and institutions, to sound relations 
between authorities. 
  Dear kinsfolk: You are starting on a difficult road of 
comprehensive reform. This will require all your efforts and 
time, as well as the purest images of purity and fraternity the 
revolution can have. It will require the highest spirit of 
satisfaction and strength, so we will see no dark sea or gulf, 
so no blood will be shed at the hand of a brother who is unaware 
of the consequences of such action. 
  Therefore, we view your agreement as a resumption of the 
unity march and an enhancement of your democratic march. So you 
have the glory. Peace be upon you while you unleash the spirit 
of unity so it will waft across the entire Arab nation's land 
with its good scent, demonstrating your generosity -- known 
since the dawn of our history -- and drafting a Yemeni epic with 
Arab objectives and vision. 
  Brothers: We do not call our concern for your situation a 
mediation, because we do not consider the spirits of brothers to 
be separate. We, together, have been aware of our historic 
responsibilities. We have been engaged in the battle for 
freedom, democracy, and unity. We have been calling for the 
power of knowledge, awareness, and culture. We have been 
dreaming of a pan-Arab awakening that will light the streets of 
the nation's cities and liberate them from oppression, slavery, 
greed, fear, sedition, starvation, civil war, and alien cultures. 
  It is an honor for us that you came to us and chose us 
because of your confidence in us. We view this confidence with 
much gratitude. We are eager to serve your best and great 
objectives so we will continue to be Arab brothers, with the 
honor of serving their brothers and kinsfolk, at the start of a 
new road for dealing with all Arab issues within the Arab 
framework, and in a spirit of brotherhood and duty, hoping to 
carry out this duty fully with God's help. 
  Esteemed kinsfolk: We do not conceal our happiness over 
the fact that you are among us. Jordanians believe their guests 
are the grandsons of the Ghassanides who built this land, who 
carried the banners of conquest to the whole world, becoming 
history's masters, knights, and creators, and who carried the 
nation's concerns and stretched their struggle to all its causes 
and places. Let us advance together as one nation that supports 
the weak, feeds the poor, the orphans, and the prisoners, and 
reminds the world of great 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab's [second 
caliph] call: How can you enslave people who are born free? 
  Let us open the windows of freedom and the doors of the 
future for our new generations. Let us call for returning the 
right and restoring the Arab land's youth, strength, power, and 
memory. Let its awakening be based on science, construction, 
factories, and universities so no hungry, grieved, or sad man is 
left out. 
  Our hands are stretched out toward your hands. The Arab and 
Islamic sanctities in the holiest city, Jerusalem, are a stone's 
throw away. We urge that no side, except God, should have 
sovereignty over them. Let the faithful compete for fearing, 
worshiping, and respecting God. Palestine can be seen with its 
minarets and domes. We are defending the Palestinian people's 
rights in response to their's and the nation's demand and in 
accordance with international legitimacy. 
  Let us depart from the clouds of hesitance in this troubled, 
changing world and come up with a vision based on an 
intellectual foundation, on our tolerant values, on our great 
message. Let us follow the road of the righteous human 
intellect and awaken the pan- Arab sense of honor and vigorous 
will. Let the pledge and accord document on which you are 
unanimous be a landmark on an irrevocable comprehensive movement 
that reaches its unionist goal and sees Yemen emerge as an Arab 
peak that connects what has been cut in the march of our great 
history. 
  Blessed be your effort, o our kinsfolk in Yemen. Be happy 
with the unity you have achieved and with the road you have 
chosen. Let new joys prevail in Sanaa, Aden, al-Hudaydah, 
Hadramaut, and Ta'izz over unity and the spirit of brotherhood. 
  Let the nation awaken like Yemen, which has decided to be at 
the forefront. Let the joy be Yemeni, the satisfaction Arab, 
and the talk free and unionist. Let us read in the holy Koran: 
Seest thou not how God sets forth a parable? A goodly word 
like a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches 
reach to the heavens. It brings forth its fruit at all times, by 
the leave of its Lord. So God sets forth parables for men, in 
order that they may receive admonition. [Koranic verse] 
  O dear kinsfolk, you will return to Yemen after agreeing to 
what is good. You will resume the Yemeni unionist march. I 
beseech God to grant you success and guide your steps on the 
right path and to help you shoulder your great responsibilities 
toward your homeland and your nation. Peace and God's mercy be 
upon you.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih following </F>
the signing of the Yemeni document of pledge and accord on 20 
February at the Royal Hashemite Court in Amman -- live] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  My brother, His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal; brother 
struggler Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine; 
brother leaders of sisterly Jordan; their excellencies the heads 
of Arab and foreign diplomatic missions: Allow me in the name 
of the steadfast Yemeni people to lavishly thank my dear brother 
His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal [applause], who exerted great 
efforts, along with his government and people and all the good 
in the Arab homeland, led, too, by my brother struggler Yasir 
'Arafat [applause] and many sisterly and friendly states, 
including the United States of America and the EEC and others in 
the world, who were concerned about Yemeni unity, which was 
proclaimed on 22 May 1990 in a peaceful and democratic way. 
  God be praised, we are here in sisterly Jordan to sign the 
document of pledge and accord drafted by the Political Forces 
Dialogue Committee of national parties and independent 
personalities. We -- the leadership, the government, and the 
people, led by the three coalition parties, the General People's 
Congress, the Yemeni Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping and the rest of the political forces -- hope that with 
this signing we will really move on to practical implementation, 
as stated in the document of pledge and accord. 
  Your majesty, we highly appreciate your hosting of this 
large 
gathering of social and political personalities, national 
figures, and historic leaders, led by brother Field Marshal 
'Abdallah al-Sallal, brother 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, brother 
'Abd-al-Rahman al-Baydani, and many other national figures and 
historic Yemeni leaders. Our father, great struggler 
'Abd-al-Rahman Bin-Yahya al- Iryani, was supposed to be with us, 
but he was delayed in Damascus for some reason. We thank you in 
the name of these forces and in the name of your people and 
brothers in Yemen for your eagerness to maintain Yemeni unity. 
  God willing, we will not disappoint you or our people in 
Jordan and the entire good Arab nation, which is concerned about 
the Yemeni unity. We will measure up to the good opinion of 
all. We will break with all past pages, in all their forms, 
tragedies, rivalries, and problems. We make the promise of 
loyal men that with this document we will move to the stage of 
pledge, success, and implementation, God willing. From the 
bottom of my heart and in the name of these leaders, I once 
again thank you very much. God's peace and blessings be upon 
you. [applause]

  [Text] The Islamic Party of Egypt has assumed 
responsibility for the attack on the passenger train carrying 
foreign tourists that took place in the vicinity of Asyut. As a 
result of this attack, two foreign tourists and two Egyptians 
were injured. According to AFP, the Islamic Party of Egypt 
issued a statement clarifying that this attack was to avenge the 
death sentence that has been imposed on three Muslims accused of 
an attempt on the life of Husni Mubarak. 
  This is the first time that the Islamic Party has mentioned 
the attempts by the Muslims against the life of the Egyptian 
president. The party also vehemently criticized the silence of 
the domestic media regarding two attempts on the life of Husni 
Mubarak in past months.

  [Text] Cairo, 22 Feb (MENA)--Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations on the implementation of "Gaza-Jericho First" 
agreement continued today. 
  Palestinian and Israeli sources said the current round of 
talks is being held in a positive atmosphere. They noted a 
common desire to achieve progress. 
  Hasan 'Usfur, deputy head of the Palestinian delegation in 
the Security Committee, told MENA that in yesterday's session, 
the negotiators completed discussion of a number of issues, 
notably the deployment of the Palestinian police force in the 
Palestinian autonomous regions, especially around the Israeli 
settlements. 
  Joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols on the side roads (which 
link the Israeli settlements with the main Gaza road leading to 
Jerusalem) and on the road between Gaza and Jericho were also 
discussed, he said. Those subjects, he added, were discussed 
within the scope of the joint security draft agreement reached 
in Taba during the recent round of negotiations. 
  'Usfur said the size of the Palestinian police force in Gaza 
and Jericho will be discussed today. 
  It should be noted that the Palestinians want the force to 
consist of 10,000 personnel, while Israel want it to be around 
6,000 strong. 
  A compromise of an 8,000-strong force is expected. 
  'Usfur said the negotiators also discussed yesterday a 
general amnesty for Palestinian detainees in accordance with a 
timetable ending before 13 July, the date when the 
implementation of the actual self-rule plan begins. 
  Representative of the International Committee of the Red 
Cross in Israel and the occupied territories on Wednesday 
submitted to chief Palestinian negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th a 
list of 9,400 Palestinian detainees. 
  The Palestinians are also demanding the return of 68 
Palestinians deported by Israel during the Palestinian intifadah. 
  'Usfur said the Civilian Affairs Committee postponed 
discussions of the transfer of water authority from the Israelis 
to the Palestinians and on water sharing to the next round 
because the Israeli water expert did not attend the talks. 
  'Usfur said discussions on the transfer of authority on 
antiquities have been completed. He stressed the importance of 
transferring this power to the Palestinians and also the 
importance of transferring the authority on government lands and 
the property of absentees to the self-rule authority. 
  The negotiators also discussed town organizing and planning 
within the transfer of the public works authority. They also 
discussed the transfer of the general communications authority. 
  Palestinian sources in the Civilian Affairs Committee 
stressed that tangible progress has been achieved in the current 
round. They noted that to date the transfer of some 30 
authorities to the Palestinians has been achieved. 
  The Palestinian sources said the next round, which will 
begin 
in Taba on Monday, will be decisive because it will tell whether 
a final round can be held in Cairo with Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin signing 
the executive agreement on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho first. 
  The current round of Palestinian-Israeli talks opened 
yesterday morning under the chairmanship of Palestinian 
President's adviser Nabil Sha'th and Israeli Deputy Chief of 
Staff General Amnon Shahaq. 
  This round is expected to conclude tomorrow, Wednesday.

  [Text] Serious differences of opinion erupted today in the 
Cairo security talks. An Israeli delegate said today that the 
gaps in the positions of the sides are unbridgeable and that yet 
another meeting between Peres and 'Arafat will be needed. Our 
correspondent Roni Daniyel has learned that Israel rejected the 
PLO's demand to release all 9,000 Palestinian prisoners. 
  In the Civilian Affairs Committee, on the other hand, 
significant progress has been reported in most issues.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Referring to the economic 
talks with the Palestinians in Paris, Finance Minister Avraham 
Shohat said they have run into real difficulties owing to the 
fact that the PLO delegates presented new positions which are 
incompatible with the understandings reached in the previous 
rounds of negotiations. In his meeting with Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad 
Quray'] tomorrow, Shohat said, he will seek to clarify whether 
the PLO officially changed its positions. 
  Minister Shohat believes a change of policy may be needed, 
and instead of open economies, a decision will be made to close 
the economies of Israel and the autonomy to each other.

  [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Leaders and representatives of 
the "Alliance of Palestinian Forces" [APF], which is opposed to 
the Oslo agreement, yesterday evening held their first meeting 
since the PLO and Israel signed the Cairo agreement and 
following the rejection last week by the Islamic Resistance 
Movement (Hamas) of the call made by four of the [opposition] 
factions which are part of the PLO for an APF meeting at 
leadership level. 
  Palestinian sources have confirmed to AL-HAYAH that Hamas 
did 
not respond to the call for an extraordinary meeting after the 
Cairo agreement was signed. The call was made in the name of 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], the 
Palestinian Popular Struggle Front [PPSF], and the Palestine 
Liberation Front [PLF]. They said that not holding the meeting 
would be "a violation of the APF's bylaws which commit members 
to attend any meeting called for by at least four factions." 
  The sources added that the four factions submitted a plan 
for 
the reactivation of the role of the opposition alliance, the aim 
of which was to foil the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement. They 
revealed that the plan includes the following four points: 
  1. Formation of a national and Islamic command for the 
intifadah inside the occupied territory. Some parties have 
reservations about the formation of such a command for security 
reasons related to the difficulty of coordination among the 
military wings of the factions. The plan urges parctical steps 
because of the Cairo security agreement which "is harmful to the 
security of the factions in the occupied territory." 
  2. A call for people's conferences. This issue has not been 
resolved because while the PLO factions want an organizational 
role that would produce leaderships from the Palestinian 
diaspora and the occupied territory, Hamas is opposed to such 
conferences or to restriction of the task to just 
"mobilization," and it is suspicious of such conferences. 
  PPSF sources have told AL-HAYAH: "Even if Hamas rejected the 
initiation of such conferences, we would begin work" along with 
the other three factions. 
  3. Initiation of political and informational steps as well 
as contacts with the leaders of the Arab and Islamic states with 
the aim of strengthening the position against the agreement. 
  4. Discussion of some APF organizational issues. PPSF 
sources said: "We will accept no obstructionist formula. There 
must be effective moves." 
  The same sources said that the Israeli forces recently 
arrested a number of military activitists from the organizations 
opposed to the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement. PPSF Secretary General 
Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid was yesterday informed of the arrest of the 
PPSF's military commander in Gaza. He sees the "arrest campaign 
as an initial result of the Cairo agreement." 
  Meanwhile, sources of the PFLP, which is led by George 
Habash, have denied any PFLP intention to move to the occupied 
territory and also denied discharging some of its cadres. They 
told AL-HAYAH that the PFLP "differentiates between moving the 
decisionmaking to the occupied territory and moving its cadres. 
Although we are passing through a financial crisis, it clings 
to every member of its cadres. The magazine AL-HADAF (the 
PFLP's mouthpiece) still appears weekly."

  [Text] Amman, QUDS PRESS -- Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Moement] has criticized the Palestinian opposition alliance's 
current framework. 
  Ibrahim Ghawshah, the movement's official spokesman, said: 
We in Hamas consider the Palestinian alliance framework to be 
incompatible with what Hamas has endeavored for. He added: 
This is a compromise framework that does not fulfill the 
desired goals. 
  Ghawshah, who recently participated in the Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces' meetings in Damascus on 19 and 20 February, 
called for changing the current alliance framework, which he 
said was "a temporary framework that should be changed." He 
noted that the Palestinian forces must work to draw up a formula 
for setting up "an elected Palestinian parliament -- just as in 
all democratic states -- that truly expresses the Palestinian 
people's stance on all issues pertaining to their destiny and 
future." 
  Ghawshah affirmed Hamas' refusal to regard "popular 
conferences" as a political authority from which a 
representative assembly emanates. He said that this formula "is 
a manifestation of part of the people. We believe that there 
must be a general manifestation. This is precisely the bone of 
contention between the democratic-leftist factions." 
  The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine had called for 
convening conferences in Palestinian populated areas with the 
aim of choosing a leadership that represents the Palestinians. 
  On the recent meetings of the alliance central leadership in 
Damascus, Ghawshah said: Three issues were discussed at the 
meetings. First, internal arrangements of the alliance. 
Second, the rules of these arrangements. Third, moves inside 
the occupied territories as well as among Palestinians in 
Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. 
  Ghawshah said that the meetings discussed "ways of enhancing 
internal coordination in light of the alliance's defeat in the 
Gaza medical association elections." He stressed that the 
defeat stemmed from "lack of coordination among opposition 
factions." 
  Ghawshah said that in the meetings "preliminary plans were 
drawn up for activating the Alliance on the political and 
popular levels." Agreement was also reached to organize visits 
by Alliance Forces representatives "in a bid to establish 
contact with the world in general and the Islamic one in 
particular on the official and popular levels." He noted that 
the aim of these visits is "to affirm to the world the 
Palestinian people's devotion to their land, future, and 
homeland." 
  Ghawshah disclosed that an alliance forces internal draft 
bill will be discussed so that it will be approved by Alliance 
officials at a meeting whose date will be set shortly.

<F P=106> [Report by Nabil 'Amr] </F>
  [Text] The Palestinian factions that form the 
Damascus-based alliance of Palestinian forces, the 10 factions, 
are displeased with the actions of the Islamic Resistance 
Movement, Hamas. Their dissatisfaction is based not only on 
Hamas' lack of seriousness in coordinating with the other 
factions in political and organizational contexts, but also on 
its militant activities inside the occupied territories in 
general, and the Gaza Strip in particular. 
  According to information made available to AL-DUSTUR on the 
atmosphere at the meetings of the alliance forces in Damascus, 
the doubts of these forces have risen to a level where they do 
not hesitate to ask a suspicious question; namely: What does 
Hamas wish to achieve with its policy, which seeks to impose 
Hamas as a custodian of the other members of the alliance -- the 
same members that suffered from Fatah's custodianship within the 
framework of the PLO? 
  AL-DUSTUR telephoned sources close to the central command of 
the alliance forces in Damascus. These sources told AL-DUSTUR 
that Hamas is trying to polish its image and deliberately seeks 
to complicate the dialogue with the other factions in the 
alliance. It wants to avoid dialogue on one substantial issue -- 
Hamas' attempts to appoint itself an alternative to Fatah in the 
new alliance, as well as an alternative to the PLO. These moves 
are rejected by the other nine factions of the new alliance, 
which sought, and still seek, to hold a dialogue with Hamas. 
They want a dialogue in order to establish a political platform 
for their movement and create flexibility on the basis of 
participation, not through Hamas' political tutelage. 
  These sources said the recent meetings in Damascus on 
Saturday [19 February] and Sunday went beyond the standard and 
did not conceal the worries of some factions over Hamas' 
rejected intentions. They raised the issue very frankly and 
confronted Hamas representatives, who tried to evade and refute 
these allegations, stressing that they do not wish to impose 
hegemony or become an alternative to the PLO. A close source to 
the alliance said the position of Hamas representatives reminds 
one of the Egyptian proverb "I hear what you say, I like it; but 
when I see your action, I wonder." A source who is very close 
to the alliance command explains why he used that proverb. He 
said Hamas is undermining the two most important tracks for the 
alliance. Hamas refused to establish a unified command for the 
intifadah inside the occupied territories, which would be open 
to all Palestinian forces opposing the Oslo agreement signed by 
the PLO and Israel on 13 September 1993 and to every Palestinian 
who believes in the intifadah as the means to realize the 
Palestinian people's national rights. 
  The source said that the second issue is that Hamas 
rejected a matter already agreed upon; namely, mobilizing the 
Palestinian people and the forces that oppose the agreement 
through people's conferences. These conferences would lead to a 
general Palestinian people's congress of representatives from 
Palestinian groups, as nominated by the people's conferences. 
  The source said that although the Palestinian people are 
coordinating to face the occupation and are working through the 
intifadah with unprecedented coordination, Hamas is of the 
opinion that coordination is better than establishing a 
leadership center for the alliance. Hamas also proposes 
people's rallies instead of organized people's conferences. 
These conferences will lead to the formation of a political 
framework for the alliance. The Palestinian people have lost 
any interest in speech rallies. 
  The same official, who did not want to be identified, said 
that the independent and historical Palestinian leaderships that 
reject the Oslo agreement and want the alliance to appear as an 
organized Palestinian opposition political force have expressed 
indignation because four months have been lost in a "dialogue of 
the deaf" among the alliance forces. Four months have gone by 
without reaching an organized framework within which the 
Palestinian forces that oppose the Oslo agreement and which 
believe that the intifadah is the only way to respond to this 
agreement can be grouped. Hamas wants to remind the Palestinian 
people, political forces, and organizations who have lost 
interest in the PLO's method of domination, of the old methods 
of Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah organization, which used to impose 
itself on the other Palestinian groups that formed the PLO. 
  While describing relations among the alliance's forces as 
cold and paralyzed, the official said that the only agreement 
was to effect a joint approach toward certain Arab and Islamic 
states. He said that the Hamas representatives in the alliance 
leadership denied any knowledge that Hamas groups on the Gaza 
Strip abducted, tortured, and killed a Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] youth in Khan Yunus and claimed 
that their policies are based on noninterference in the internal 
affairs of others. 
  A DFLP official in Amman told us that reports available to 
him confirm that a group from Hamas is behind the Khan Yunus 
killing and that there are more than 15 youth abduction cases in 
Gaza over the past two weeks of which nine youths were killed. 
Our sources in Damascus say that the question of the lack of 
law and order in Gaza took four hours of discussion in the 
alliance meetings. The killing of the DFLP member prompted the 
formation of a committee to investigate the killing under Talal 
Naji of the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine--General 
Command with the membership of DFLP and Hamas representatives.

  [Text] Four radical members of the PLO Executive Committee 
have pledged to prevent the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Cairo agreement, saying it is a catastrophe

  The four Palestinian officials are: 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, 
member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; 
Taysir Khalid, member of the Democratic Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine; Mahmud Isma'il, member of the Arab Liberation

<F P=106> [By Rashid Hilal] </F>
  [Excerpt] Damascus, Ramallah -- Nayif Hawatimah, secretary 
general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, 
has affirmed that his faction will continue to participate in 
the current Palestine National Council [PNC]. He said, however, 
that this participation hinges on a call to rebuild all PLO 
institutions on a democratic and elected coalition basis and 
with national common denominators. 
  In an interview with AL-QUDS, Hawatimah said that this basis 
will ensure a serious commitment to and compliance with the 
decisions of the PLO's legislative and executive institutions. 
Hawatimah disclosed that he had invited the Palestinian 
leadership to discuss the Oslo-Cairo agreement and hold a 
referendum over this agreement, but the invitation was turned 
down. Hawatimah said that he favors a historic settlement on 
the basis of two states -- one Arab Palestinian and the other 
Jewish Israeli -- in accordance with the Palestinian people's 
right to self-determination and the return of the refugees on 
the basis of UN Resolution 194. 
  He added: This is what I asked for in my recent meetings 
with U.S. and Russian delegations in Damascus. He said: In 
these meetings I called on the delegations to cooperate with us 
in holding a Palestinian referendum, inside and outside the 
occupied territories, on the Oslo-Cairo agreement. 
  Hawatimah said: We are calling for evolution toward popular 
legitimacy by convening popular conferences in the homeland and 
the diaspora. This should lead to the holding of a unified 
national conference which would draw up a political program and 
choose a new leadership -- in a spirit of democracy and 
criticism -- that enjoys the people's support. The conference 
would also elect a new National Council, which in turn would 
rebuild all PLO institutions on democratic and coalition bases. 
  Hawatimah indicated that the Palestinian negotiating 
leadership is refraining from convening the current PNC because 
most of the council members oppose the Oslo-Cairo agreement.

  [Text] Dear brothers: Those with sure steps are unshakable. 
The Palestinian people under the PLO have the right to walk with 
sure steps. This is because they have faith in their 
invincible, strong, and unconquerable will. They are sure of 
their steps toward a free independent Palestinian state. The 
Palestinian people's self-confidence is drawn from, among other 
things, their national unity and great intifadah, which gives 
the Palestinian national consciousness an idea about its future 
prospects, and qualifies it to proceed with efforts to build the 
future. At present, the Palestinian people are about to take 
firm and decisive steps toward independence. The Palestinian 
people under the PLO have made preparations for all 
eventualities. They are ready to thwart all obstacles that 
could stand in their way, preventing them from achieving their 
sublime objectives. This requires, among other things, enhanced 
national unity and further vigilance against any malicious 
instigation promoting discord, a pestilence that has failed in 
its attempts to plague the Palestinian national consciousness 
and the Palestinian national unity since the inception of our 
liberation march. 
  O masses of our lofty people, let self-confidence and the 
giant national will be among the slogans of this phase while we 
proceed firmly toward the extrication of our legitimate national 
rights to achieve total independence. While looking forward to 
the future, which we are bound to extricate, let us repeat with 
our leader Abu-'Ammar the following verse: Those with sure 
steps are unshakable. Yes, our people are walking the path 
leading to the state of Palestinian right and truth, unified and 
united. Their steps are unfaltering.

  [Text] Brothers: As we continue to forge the epic, create 
the miracle, escalate our great struggle, and wage fierce 
confrontations and [word indistinct] the homeland from the north 
to the south, and from the sea to the river with the efforts of 
our brave hands, our heroic masses, our blessed intifadah 
actions, and the strength of our powerful march toward decisive 
and certain victory, with Almighty God's help, and as we move 
from one stage to another, advance from one achievement to 
another, and from one creativity to another more brilliant 
creativity--while we are doing this and more--we should beware 
of the occupying enemy and be always and daily on maximum alert 
for its black plots and criminal fingers that are trying to 
encroach on our past and present. 
  Not only is this arrogant enemy fighting us with ordinary, 
plastic, and rubber bullets. Not only is it fighting us with 
gas, poisonous, and nerve gas bombs. Not only is it using the 
ugliest and dirtiest crimes in the history of mankind. This 
enemy is also fighting us with intrigues -- malicious intrigues 
which try to undermine our self-confidence. You, kinsfolk and 
beloved brothers, know the occupying enemy's method of cheap and 
black intrigues. The occupying enemy is behind all the forged 
and distorted statements. It is behind most tribal differences. 
The enemy is behind most fabricated, false stories, and rumors 
against any of our brothers or group. 
  Therefore, let us beware of the enemy, because this enemy, 
which fires treacherous bullets at the chests of our children, 
women, magnificent young men and girls is the same party that 
directs intrigues to our spirits and morale in a bid to deal a 
strong blow to us. 
  Let us beware of this criminal enemy, let us make the 
enemy's 
arrows and hateful and black schemes backfire. Let us be 
patient, let us resist and arm ourselves with awareness, and 
hoist the banners of national confidence. Let us bring double 
retaliation and answer [words indistinct]. 
  The intifadah is continuing, its voice is louder, its flag 
is 
higher, and its march is the strongest. Hail to you the sons of 
our great people. Hail to you and to your comprehensive 
awareness, and deep vision of things, the courage of your [word 
indistinct] , the strength of your hands, and the greatness of 
your sacrifices. Gods' victory is close.

  [Text] Algiers, 23 Feb 94 (JANA) -- Foreign Minister 
Mohamed Salah Dembri, made a statement to the JANA correspondent 
yesterday in which he stressed the importance of Major 
al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi's visit to Algeria [word indistinct] 
and its outcome at the bilateral level as well as at the level 
of the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU], pointing out that contacts 
between brothers will always open new vistas. 
  He added: Strong relations have always existed between 
Algeria and Libya, and contacts between the two fraternal 
countries are necessary. The meeting between brother 
al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi and President Zeroual has given us a 
new opportunity to meet again in the near future to examine all 
topics of mutual interest at the bilateral and Maghreban levels 
as well as our Arab and Islamic nations, he said. 
  He added: There are a number of topics to be examined. They 
require us to unite our efforts. And this is what we discussed 
with Major al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi. 
  He stressed that there is no rift between Algerian and 
Libyan 
brothers that can be manipulated by opposition forces. And this 
should be the main outcome of this visit. We are hoping that 
the coming days will witness intensified contacts to examine our 
affairs with clarity, resolve them, and lay down a joint plan of 
action to resolve all related matters, he pointed out.

  The employees of the Central Algiers Printing Company have

disagreement with management regarding the review of the salary 
grid and the implementation of the collective agreement. 
  This strike had a quick effect, which resulted in the

  [Text] Cairo, 22 Feb (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
stressed that Egypt firmly and decisively supports the 
territorial integrity of Sudan and opposes the separation of its 
south. 
  Any attempts to separate southern Sudan from its northern 
part, whether by the north or the south of Sudan or by foreign 
quarters, will be faced by a clear Egyptian opposition, he said. 
  Musa was commenting today on reports of attempts to separate 
the south of Sudan. 
  On the escalation in Yemen, especially after signing the 
agreement between the Yemeni president and his deputy, the 
foreign minister said: This is unfortunate, especially as it 
comes after the signing of an agreement between Yemeni President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. This 
indicates that the situation is serious. After only a few 
hours, the signed document had failed to achieve its purpose. 
Egypt hopes the contents of the Pledge and Accord document will 
be respected and implemented. 
  Musa asked: If a document is not respected, then what is the 
point in arranging celebrations and protocols for signing 
agreements that are not implemented? 
  On the situation in Bosnia, Musa said all reports reaching 
the Foreign Ministry, as well as the NATO statement, show that 
the overwhelming majority of heavy weapons have been withdrawn 
and that some other weaponry has been placed under UN 
supervision. There is no longer a threat there. 
  He said NATO had reaffirmed that the ultimatum and all other 
decisions stand, in case any of these guns or missile batteries 
return to their positions or if Sarajevo is fired on, even if it 
is not hit. NATO also stressed its commitment to protect the 
seclusion zone, the besieged area, and the UN forces, Musa noted.

<F P=106> [Report by Amin Radwan in Cairo: "Rapprochement Between </F>
Cairo and Khartoum To Prevent Partition of Sudan Following 
Renewed Calls for U.S. Intervention and Support for the 
Secessionists"] 
  [Text] The problem of southern and western Sudan and the 
attempts to secede them from the north--according to last year's 
Washington declaration--remain a fundamental point of difference 
between the foreign policies of Egypt and the United States. 
But, at the same time it is a point of agreement for Cairo and 
Khartoum that Sudan should stay united with all its seven 
provinces. 
  The repeated U.S. attempts to convince Egypt of the need for 
the secession of southern Sudan has expanded to include 
Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda. In the past three months, the U.S. 
Administration exerted intensive efforts to convince these three 
countries' presidents to support the right to self-determination 
for the inhabitants of south Sudan and of Jabal al-Nubah in 
western Sudan. Harry Johnston, vice chairman of the African 
Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, played an 
important role in these efforts. This prompted Kenyan President 
Daniel arap Moi to invite Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir for 
talks in Nairobi on 18 February. Ethiopian President Meles 
Zenawi had already accused Khartoum of interfering in Ethiopian 
affairs and warned it against attempting to export terrorism to 
Ethiopia and Eritrea through Islamic groups. 
  The three countries' presidents had received U.S. reports 
about the southern Sudanese people's need for military and 
material support to confront the Sudanese Government, who has 
succeeded, according to these reports, in supporting and 
increasing the strength of the Eritrean al-Jihad Movement. This 
group is hostile to the Eritrean Transitional Government in 
Asmara, the Somali Union Organization in northeast Somalia, the 
Islamic Front for the Liberation of Oromo in Ethiopia, the 
Islamic Union Forces in "Ogaden," and the Islamic groups in 
Kenya. 
  Egypt's Foreign Ministry sources pointed out that the 
Al-Bashir-Moi meeting in Nairobi will be followed by meetings 
with the two leaders of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army 
[SPLA], John Garang and Riak Machar, who signed the agreement in 
Washington last year on working together to obtain the right to 
self-determination for southern and western Sudan. 
  These sources stressed that Harry Johnston told the three 
African presidents that one of the aims behind the dispatch of 
U.S. forces to Somalia in the "Restore Hope" operation was to 
resolve the southern Sudan problem within the framework that 
maintains security and stability in the Horn of Africa region. 
  The sources added that the U.S. interest in south Sudan is 
Khartoum's support for the Islamic movements and exporting them 
to neighboring countries. To make the Sudanese Government stop 
this support, the U.S. Administration sought to change the 
approach to solving the problem in the south from negotiations 
to the overt call for its secession from the north. For this 
purpose, the U.S. Administration recently held direct contacts 
with some southern leaders, including Machar, to prepare for 
large-scale military operations against the Sudanese forces to 
achieve self-determination for the southerners. Machar recently 
called for international intervention in the south to stop what 
he called the genocide of Christian civilians at the hands of 
the "Islamic" Sudanese Government. 
  The sources noted that Cairo learned of the U.S. contacts 
with the secessionists in the south and the U.S. 
Administration's inclination to move U.S. forces from Somalia to 
southern Sudan. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry summoned the U.S. 
ambassador in Cairo to ask about these contacts and the nature 
of the role U.S. forces deployed in Somalia will play in the 
south. 
  The same sources noted that the U.S. ambassador's answer, 
conveyed to President Husni Mubarak at the end of December, 
pointed out that the goal of the U.S. military reinforcements in 
the south is to confront centers of "terrorism" in Khartoum, 
which represent a threat to security and stability in 
neighboring states. According to the same sources, the U.S. 
ambassador went beyond this explanation when he asked President 
Mubarak to back these U.S. efforts by requesting direct Egyptian 
participation in any military operations that may be carried out 
against the Khartoum Government. He expressed his country's 
readiness to work out military arrangements that could secure 
the participation of some Egyptian military units, particularly 
since the U.S. State Department appreciates the embarrassment 
Egypt could face as a result of a potential direct military 
confrontation with Sudanese Government troops. 
  Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources have disclosed that the 
number of U.S. troops prepared for dispatch to southern Sudan is 
4,000, along with equipment and modern military aircraft. In 
early January, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry learned of a deal 
involving the supply of advanced U.S. weapons to the rebel 
troops in southern Sudan via Israel. 
  According to Arab diplomatic reports from Washington, direct 
U.S. intervention in the south is serious. The sources added 
that Britain had agreed to join in this intervention. Some 
British societies, sponsored by Baroness Cox, have invited 
leaders of the Sudanese opposition and the two wings of SPLA to 
"a meeting on Sudan" to be held in the House of Commons in 
London this month. The meeting will discuss the two main 
issues; the political and the humanitarian problems in southern 
Sudan. 
  The same sources disclosed that the United States will use 
some military bases in neighboring African states as launching 
pads for attacks against the Sudanese troops in the southern 
areas, particularly in the Equatoria Province, Bahr El Ghazal 
Province, and the Upper Nile Province. 
  An expert on African affairs at the Egyptian Foreign 
Ministry 
has pointed out that the objective of these U.S. military 
preparations is not just to protect the U.S. interests in the 
Horn of Africa but to cover up the failure of the operation in 
Somalia. This failure has been a major political setback for 
the new U.S. Administration and has resulted in a 30 percent 
drop in the U.S. public's support for President Bill Clinton's 
foreign policy. President Clinton personally wishes to score a 
major victory in his foreign policy similar to that achieved by 
former President George Bush during the Gulf war. The Egyptian 
expert added that, aware of his mistake in settling matters 
inside Somalia, President Bill Clinton was convinced of his 
friend Harry Johnston's advice that a major military victory 
over Sudanese Government troops is possible, particularly since 
the southerners will provide all the necessary military 
assistance to make the U.S. role in this mission successful. 
  The expert adds that Clinton expects the southern Sudan 
operation to last two months. During the operation, the U.S. 
Administration will declare the right to self-determination for 
the southerners within a state independent from the north. 
  The Egyptian expert points out that the United States 
decided 
to take part in the operation in Somalia to create permanent 
posts after the restoration of stability in that country. To 
achieve this objective, U.S. military officials visited Somalia 
successively to determine the locations of the posts. They 
initially chose seven posts and held exchanges with some Somali 
leaders. However, six of those leaders, including President Ali 
Mahdi, did not approve the establishment of the posts on Somali 
territory. 
  The Egyptian expert disclosed that the U.S. Administration 
recently went back on its decision temporarily to build military 
bases in Somalia lest these bases be sabotaged by the Somalis. 
Hence, Johnston advised that these bases could possibly be set 
up in southern Sudan as this move enjoys the approval of the 
southern rebels leaders, particularly since Machar previously 
called for establishing secure zones in southern Sudan. The 
Sudanese Air Force would not be allowed to overfly these zones, 
similar to northern and southern Iraq. 
  The Egyptian expert pointed out that the idea of building 
permanent U.S. military bases in southern Sudan is an old one. 
It was first expressed by former Presidents Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush, but they could not implement it because of the 
instability in southern Sudan. Bill Clinton is now trying to 
achieve this objective within the context of Washington's 
statement advocating the southerners' right to 
self-determination by setting up an independent state. 
  The Egyptian expert noted that the strategic importance of 
these bases is to ensure an advance U.S. presence during 
disturbances and military operations in the African Horn states, 
adjacent Arab countries, and the Red Sea. Cairo has urgently 
asked the U.S. Administration not to intervene militarily in the 
Sudanese problem and not to dispatch U.S. forces from Somalia 
for this purpose. In its request, Cairo said that supporting the 
secession of the south from the north is bound to encourage 
several ethnic groups in Sudan and Ethiopia to take similar 
measures. This would actually threaten stability in the Horn of 
Africa. 
  Sources said that although the U.S. ambassador in Cairo 
tried 
to convey his government's assurances that it would not carry 
out military intervention in Sudan, he said that Washington 
wants the Egyptian Government to cooperate with it to curb 
"terrorism," which takes Khartoum as its center, and to support 
the idea of independence for the south from the north, as it 
represents the ideal solution to the southerners' suffering and 
does not harm Egypt's southern security. 
  This solution would also enable the independent Sudanese 
southerners to establish good relations with Cairo and to revive 
joint economic projects, including the Jonglei Canal project, 
which has been obstructed by the ongoing war. However, Cairo 
received all these assurances with extreme caution and has not 
supported the U.S. position on the matter. 
  The Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources said that the reasons 
for the U.S. retreat from direct military intervention in the 
south, which became apparent from the U.S. ambassador's 
assurances, were the differences that erupted between the 
secessionist leaders over accepting the U.S. role in the south 
and the condition of setting up permanent U.S. military bases in 
their areas. While some, including Machar, backed the 
establishment of these bases, Garang expressed some reservations. 
  To narrow the differences between these two leaders, Harry 
Johnston sought to tell them that the U.S. Administration will 
make military commitments to the rebel forces. In this context, 
he effected a reconciliation between Garang and Machar (leader 
of the Nuer tribes) to get the two leaders to agree on these 
military commitments, which Washington will make later. 
  Confirmed Egyptian information noted that Machar approved 
these military commitments while Garang opposed them and 
expressed fears about them, and even conveyed these fears to 
Cairo. 
  In view of this frenzied activity on the part of Washington 
to resolve the problem of south Sudan on the basis of 
self-determination, intensive Egyptian-Sudanese contacts were 
held at the end of last month during which a message was 
conveyed from the Egyptian president to his Sudanese counterpart 
in which he stressed Egypt's support for Sudan in any attempt to 
partition it. The Egyptian president also underlined the link 
between Egyptian and Sudanese security. 
  Egyptian and Sudanese sources in Cairo said that Mubarak's 
message to al-Bashir left a good impression on Sudanese 
officials. This led to the two countries' agreement on resolving 
the Egyptian-Sudanese dispute over the Hala'ib triangle within 
the framework of the bilateral joint committees and on resolving 
the differences between them over the issues of terrorism. In 
this connection, the Sudanese authorities recently built a port 
on the Red Sea and not in Shalatayn (the disputed area between 
the two countries) to avoid any disputes and to improve 
bilateral relations. 
  As part of Egypt's efforts to achieve a common conception of 
security interests in the Horn of Africa between Cairo and 
Washington, President Husni Mubarak contacted the presidents of 
Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Eritrea, and some Somali leaders in his 
capacity as OAU chairman. The contacts were designed to 
underline the importance of the Egyptian role in the Horn of 
Africa and the possibility of Egypt playing a prominent and 
direct role in protecting U.S. interests and African countries' 
interests in this region. This Egyptian role could be the 
alternative to the direct role that Washington intends to play 
in southern Sudan. 
  Although this common concept has not been achieved yet, 
Washington, according to the African affairs expert in the 
Egyptian Foreign Ministry, has not been convinced of the 
Egyptian role in this region, especially in Somalia, and has 
sought to belittle its importance or to marginalize it. 
Washington is insisting that any action taken in the Horn of 
Africa has to go through it. But Cairo continues to believe 
that the problems of the region could be resolved within the 
framework of the OAU and UN charters, which call for maintaining 
the territorial integrity of Africa's countries and prohibits 
their partitioning.

  [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Egyptian Information 
Minister Safwat al-Sharif has denied that his ministry or other 
Egyptian authorities intend to take measures to restrict foreign 
correspondents or representatives of Arab and international 
newspapers and news agencies operating in Cairo. 
  Asked about the reports that correspondents may be harassed 
or restricted, al-Sharif told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: "There is no 
control, interference, or anything that limits their freedom of 
movement, or confiscation of their messages or reports...; they 
are completely free." However, the Egyptian information 
minister stressed that the state or any authoritative quarter is 
entitled to draw it to any correspondent's attention if it 
becomes clear that he insists on reporting untrue news. "A 
correspondent's freedom does not mean fabricating imaginary 
stories and falling into the claws of erroneous reports." 
  The minister warns correspondents not to fall into what he 
termed the "fax trap." He said: "For two years press and news 
agency bureaus have been accustomed to receiving statements from 
illegal or extremist groups by fax. Some correspondents think 
these statements are a scoop or a reality, but over the past two 
years nothing of what they threatened to do has happened." 
Al-Sharif added: "We request nothing of correspondents except 
the truth, only the truth. They know better than anyone else 
that they live in security and safety which may be greater than 
in their own countries." 
  He said that sources of information are available to them. 
And with regard to security issues, the Egyptian Interior 
Ministry has an official spokesman and has allocated telephone 
numbers for those who want to ascertain information, without any 
kind of control of interference. 
  He pointed out that freedom of movement is available to 
correspondents and that there is the permanent press center, 
which operates around the clock to serve foreign correspondents 
and provide them with all the statements and statistics they 
request.

  [Excerpts] At last, the security organs have succeeded in 
penetrating the terrorist groups, according to a ranking 
security expert, who added that this development is extremely 
important. Although the security expert declined to elaborate on 
the extent of this penetration, he noted that it is 
semi-comprehensive and is bound to obstruct the terrorists' 
movements and curb their operations. 
  The security expert added that the penetration has been 
expanded to cover most of the terrorist organizations, thus 
enabling the security services to have an overall picture of 
these organizations' leaders, members, internal, and external 
affiliations, centers, and sources of arms and funds. 
  The security expert, who preferred to remain anonymous, 
pointed out that the penetration has also enabled the security 
forces to carry out successful operations that have led to the 
fall of several terrorist leaders and to strike at the 
perpetrators of some operations before they were carried out. 
  The security expert said that this successful development 
does not mean the end of the terrorists. He cautioned that some 
absconding members might carry out serious terrorist operations. 
  The security expert made these statements before the 
incident 
in al-Sayyidah Zaynab, on 14 February, during which the 
following three terrorists were killed: Tharwat Hajjaj, Mustafa 
Mahmud 'Ali Musa, and 'Atif Khalil 'Id. 
  Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry has nearly completed a new 
procedure that would protect prosecution witnesses in terrorist 
cases and encourage citizens to give any information dealing 
with terrorist activities to facilitate arrests. 
  The proposed procedure imposes complete secrecy on persons 
who give information and intensifies their protection in the 
event that they become prosecution witnesses. [passage omitted] 
  A security source said that after the assassination of 
Sayyid 
Ahmad Yahya, the prosecution witness in the case of the 
assassination attempt against Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, a 
state of fear engulfed prosecution witnesses in other terrorist 
cases. Some of these witnesses wanted to withdraw their 
statements. Other witnesses even failed to show up before the 
interrogation authorities. The interior minister then issued 
instructions to study the entire situation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 22 Feb (MENA)--Extensive security campaigns 
during the past 24 hours in the slum districts organized by 
al-Jizah security department have resulted in arresting around 
700 people who are suspected of various political and criminal 
violations. 
  Brigadier General Sayyid Farid, director of the General 
Department for al-Jizah Investigations, said that the storming 
of the slum areas also resulted in the arrest of 145 fugitive 
extremists from Upper Egypt. The security forces also seized a 
number of firearms, including three machine guns. 
  He said that within the framework of instructions from 
Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi on the need to extensively 
search for activists, during this campaign, in which most of the 
security organs participated, the security forces succeeded in 
resolving many cases, including 15 drug cases of various kinds, 
and in shutting down numerous drug dens. 
  The search forces -- led by Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
Khalil, head of the Investigations Department -- succeeded in 
arresting 48 fugitives who were fleeing various sentences for 
crimes they had committed. They also arrested a number of gangs 
specializing in robbing houses and stores in all parts of 
al-Jizah. 
  The director of the General Department for Investigations 
noted that the defendants confessed to their crimes and have 
been referred to the prosecution for interrogation and 
investigation.

  [Text] Tripoli, 22 Feb 1994, JANA--U.S. President Clinton 
said that the Great Jamahiriyah constituted an unusual and 
exceptional threat to the national security and foreign policy 
of the United States. 
  This was said in the report that Clinton presented to the 
U.S. Congress recently, in which he reviewed the state of 
emergency that the United States announced toward the 
Jamahiriyah as of 1986. 
  The JANA political editor commented on this, saying that 
what 
is a cause for amazement in Clinton's statement is that it came 
from the largest nuclear state in the world against Libya, a 
peaceful state facing unjust mandatory sanctions for which the 
U.S. Government itself is the first to be held responsible and 
that has practiced various pressures through threats and 
attraction [as received] in order to impose such measures at the 
UN Security Council. 
  The editor wondered what the Great Jamahiriyah had done to 
constitute the danger that the U.S. President mentioned, apart 
from the fact that it has refused to be a lackey and dependent 
and has drawn for itself an independent political path based on 
getting friendly with those that befriend it and hostile toward 
those that are hostile toward it. It has also rejected 
infringement upon its sovereignty and its Arab nation. In this 
framework, it becomes clear that the primary reason behind the 
report of the U.S. President at this moment is the stance of the 
Great Jamahiriyah, which has exposed the so-called Gaza and 
Jericho agreement and the plan to sell Palestine and impose 
unconditional surrender on the Arabs. 
  When the U.S. President says that Libya constitutes a danger 
for U.S. interests, by these interests he means the Israelis, 
because the U.S. wants Israel to be the most powerful and the 
Arabs to surrender and submit to their will. 
  The editor stressed that the U.S. Government must prove this 
serious accusation before the UN Security Council, which must 
investigate it. The U.S. Government must prove how Libya 
constitutes a danger to the United States. 
  JANA has learned that the secretariat of the General 
People's 
Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation will 
submit the text of the report that was presented by U.S. 
President Clinton to the Congress to the Secretariat of the 
General People's Congress so that it is distributed to the Basic 
People's Congresses so that every member is well informed of the 
contents of that report and the serious dimensions and meanings 
it contains.

  [Text] Clashes erupted in southern Yemen today between two 
units of the former north Yemeni and south Yemeni armies, 
despite the fact that a reconciliation accord was signed in 
Amman yesterday between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
former president of north Yemen, and his deputy 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, former leader of south Yemen. The accord is designed to 
end the political crisis that has continued for several months 
in Yemen. 
  The Yemeni president and his deputy left the Jordanian 
capital separately this afternoon after holding a prolonged 
meeting with King Husayn of Jordan. 
  Security and political sources in Sanaa have said that 
troops 
and tanks affiliated with a unit of the former north Yemeni Army 
are besieging the city of Zinjibar in southern Yemen in the 
aftermath of clashes with troops affiliated with the former 
south Yemeni army. The clashes erupted after troops affiliated 
with the north Yemeni army attempted to detain a colonel 
affiliated with the south Yemeni Army at a military checkpoint. 
  Yemeni sources in Amman said at noon today that at least 
four 
persons were killed in the clashes between the two sides.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Ministry of Defense and

News Agency, SABA' that the regrettable military incident that 
took place in Abyan Governorate was contained this morning. The

Council Vice Chairman brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid were informed of 
this incident, they instructed that the incident be contained, 
that a rapid investigation of the circumstances surrounding it 
be conducted, and that full compliance with instructions be 
enforced. 
  The Military Committee has been asked to monitor the 
implementation of the instructions, and to take the necessary 
relevant measures. 
  The source asserted that this incident will not undermine 
the 
joy that has swept our people in the aftermath of the signing of 
the accord document in Arab Amman, the city of accord and 
reconciliation, under the sponsorship of His Majesty King Husayn 
Bin-Talal and the Jordanian people. Moreover, this incident 
will not deter all from continuing to mobilize efforts to 
implement the document of accord in order to build a modern 
Yemeni state, a state of institutions, law, and order, the 
source concluded.

  [Excerpts] Sanaa, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Rival Yemeni troops 
clashed Monday leaving four dead and 20 wounded, a Defence 
Ministry source said. 
  The fighting broke out a day after country's leaders signed 
a 
deal patching up their differences. 
  A tank was also destroyed when brigades from the north and 
south fought for an hour in the Abyan region, 100 kilometres (60 
miles) east Aden, a source close to Defense Minister Haytham 
Qasim Tahir said. 
  Each side accused the other of sparking the clash after 
moving troops toward the old border between the former North 
Yemen and poorer South Yemen, which merged in 1990. 
  On Sunday, Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his 
southern rival Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid met in the 
Jordanian capital Amman to sign a deal calling for major 
economic, political and military reforms. 
  The accord, aimed at ending a dispute which threatened to 
split the country, called for withdrawing troops facing each 
other along the old border and banned troop movements in cities 
and on main roads. 
  Monday's fighting ended after the intervention of a military 
commission that had been set up to implement withdrawals, 
officials said. 
  Salim Salih Muhammad, a top YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] 
official and member of the Presidential Council, also told AFP 
that Salih, al-Bid and Jordan's King Husayn had contacted 
officials in Abyan to restore calm. 
  King Husayn said Sunday that the accord was "a positive 
start 
for Arabs to settle their own differences." 
  Muhammad accused northern troops of having deployed further 
south, closer to Aden. But a northern official who asked not to 
be named alleged that southern troops had moved forward. 
[passage omitted] 
  Al-Bid underlined his commitment to the accord despite 
"reservations and wounds." He said he could visualize the faces 
of relatives killed in political violence, but "Yemen is dearer 
to us. 
  "We are going to turn over a new leaf...and we will start 
applying this document," Al-Bid added. Salih thanked the 
United States and European Union for helping in the 
reconciliation.

  [Text] Sources close to Defense Minister Haytham Qasim 
Tahir said in Aden today that the military situation in the 
southern Abyan region, where armed clashes took place between 
northern and southern units on 21 February, is close to the 
point of exploding. The same sources said that the country is 
now in an undeclared state of war. 
  The tension follows the signing of an accord agreement last 
Sunday. The agreement aims to end the political crisis that has 
been plaguing the country since last August.

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Southern officials mounted a 
diplomatic drive on Tuesday in the Gulf, after troop clashes at 
home which claimed at least eight lives despite a reconciliation 
accord between Yemen's rival leaders. 
  Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, met King 
Fahd 
in the Saudi capital, while his deputy Salim Salih Muhammad met 
the Kuwaiti amir, Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, and called for ties 
to be restored. 
  They were the first such high-level visits since the 1991 
Gulf war, when the conservative monarchies accused Yemen of 
siding with Iraq and Kuwait broke off relations. 
  Al-Bid later travelled to Oman while Salih Muhammad went to 
the United Arab Emirates, where he said the tour was aimed at 
drumming up support for Yemen after the reconciliation signed on 
Sunday in Amman by al-Bid and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a 
northerner. 
  Referring to the clashes which have erupted since the deal, 
the envoy called on "all parties concerned to help remedy the 
situation and allow the return of stability." 
  But an Arab diplomat here, declining to be named, warned 
that 
the al-Bid initiative could back-fire and "aggravate the crisis 
of confidence between the president and his deputy." 
  Al-Bid is still refusing to return to Sanaa from his 
southern 
base of Aden, where he has taken refuge since last August, an 
official in the president's General People's Congress (GPC) said. 
  He said the vice president was demanding the arrest and 
trial 
of those responsible for the series of political assassinations 
since the country united in May 1990, most of which have 
targeted al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP). 
  Since Friday, fighting between rival Yemeni troops has 
killed 
at least eight soldiers and created an "explosive" situation 
which could run out of control, diplomatic and defence ministry 
sources said. 
  Seven died in two separate clashes in the south on Monday, 
the day after the Amman accord calling for major economic, 
political and military reforms. Another soldier was killed in 
fighting near Aden airport on Friday. 
  The accord on decentralization, as demanded by the south, 
was 
aimed at ending a political crisis between Salih and al-Bid that 
threatened the unity of the country. 
  Despite unity, the two armies have not merged -- although 
northern units have been sent south and vice versa -- and 
tension has grown with troop build-ups along the former frontier. 
  The situation has become "explosive," with a risk of the 
fighting spreading across the country, a source close to Defence 
Minister Haytham Tahir Qasim, a southerner, said after the 
latest clashes. 
  Four soldiers were killed and 20 wounded in the town of 
Lawdar, 100 kilometres (60 miles) northeast of Aden on Monday, 
diplomatic sources said. 
  Southern troops dispatched as reinforcements from the port 
of 
al-Mukallah fought for several hours with a northern brigade in 
a battle involving tanks and artillery. 
  Three other soldiers died Monday when northern forces 
attacked an administrative building held by southern troops in 
Zinjibar, 30 kilometres (20 miles) east of Aden, and the capital 
of Abyan province, the sources said. 
  Tension flared in Abyan after the president overturned the 
nomination of a local governor by Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al- 'Attas, a southerner. 
  A military commission was dispatched to Abyan to sort out 
the 
dispute between the rival forces but so far the mission has been 
a failure, the YSP said. 
  But the GPC official played down reports of tension, saying 
the situation in Abyan was calm after the commission's 
intervention with the backing of the US and French embassies. 
  "The alarming reports from the YSP are designed to 
camouflage 
the actions they are taking that are contrary to the 
reconciliation accord," he charged.

  [Text] Amman, Feb 22 (AFP)--Northern Yemeni troops on 
Tuesday ambushed and killed 15 soldiers from the rival south, a 
Yemeni official said here. 
  The ambush was sprung by a northern brigade at al-'Amaliqah, 
based in the Abyan region of southern Yemen, the south Yemeni 
official said in Jordan where the rival leaders signed a 
reconciliation accord on Sunday. 
  There was no confirmation from the north.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim </F>
Basindwah in Sanaa by Fawzi al-Jundi in Cairo; date not given; 
from the "Dialogue from Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] The developments in Yemen following the 
signing of the pledge and accord document by President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid are the 
focus of this conversation with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah. We welcome him to Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Basindwah] I thank you for phoning me. I wish you and 
Egypt--its president, government, and people--prosperity, 
success, stability, and peace in this blessed month of Ramadan, 
the month of fasting and virtue. 
  [Al-Jundi] Hours after the signing of the pledge and accord 
document, news agency reports spoke of clashes between northern 
and southern Yemeni forces. What is your full assessment of 
these clashes? 
  [Basindwah] I want to be true with the listeners of the 
Voice 
of the Arabs because the Voice of the Arabs has accustomed us to 
the truth. Undoubtedly, there are elements in the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] who want to consecrate secession as a fait 
accompli. Within this context, some forces--the Unity 
Brigade--moved from Hadramut to the Abyan Province contrary to 
the agreement banning any military movements. These forces, 
which fall under the YSP command, moved to Abyan Province to 
provoke the 'Amaliqah forces. A clash occurred, in which 
innocent Yemenis died. We do not consider the dead from the 
south as non-Yemenis and we do not consider the dead from the 
north as non-Yemenis. In our view, they are all Yemenis and 
they are the sons of our one people. We must save their blood. 
We do not want a Yemeni to be killed by another Yemeni. We want 
to stop the bloodshed. The clash was part of a plan to prevent 
the signing of the document. We had hoped that 20 February of 
this year would be the day Yemen overcame its crisis. 
  [Al-Jundi] While we share with you this hope, it is a fact 
that both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid want to contain any crisis that might arise. There 
are direct orders by both men that these events should be 
contained. 
  [Basindwah] Yemen is dear to us. We must safeguard the 
security and peace of its people. We want stability to prevail 
throughout our homeland. We do not want any part of the 
homeland to be exposed to dangers. Yemen's unity does not 
concern one particular person or party but concerns all Yemenis. 
In my opinion, any attempt to break up this unity is treason. 
  [Al-Jundi] Allow me to submit a clearer question. How 
effective is the pledge and accord document at this particular 
time? 
  [Basindwah] I believe all our people have rallied around 
this 
document and there is a national consensus on it. However, 
there are elements who are trying to spoil the good and 
encouraging atmosphere created by the signing of the pledge and 
accord document. We must implement this document because it no 
longer belongs to its signatories but to all the Yemeni people. 
  [Al-Jundi] The pledge and accord document was signed in the 
presence of the Arab League secretary general and a 
representative of Omani Sultan Qabus and under the sponsorship 
of King Husayn of Jordan. Did the participation of these 
figures in the reconciliation of the Yemeni factions represent 
an Arab desire to contain this crisis? 
  [Basindwah] Undoubtedly, the presence of the Arab League 
secretary general and the Omani minister of state for foreign 
affairs as a representative of Sultan Qabus indicates a 
collective Arab desire for Yemeni unity. We had hoped that the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Syrian 
Arab Republic, the Gulf states, and other Arab states would have 
attended the signing of this document. We know that all these 
states are concerned about Yemen's unity. Regardless of 
attempts by some people to cast doubt on our relations with 
fraternal and dear states, we will remain loyal to these states 
and retain for them amity, respect, appreciation, and gratitude. 
  [Al-Jundi] How do you envisage future events in Yemen? 
  [Basindwah] I believe our Yemeni people will rally around 
those who are eager for Yemen's unity. They will stand against 
all those who try to dismember Yemen. Those who are defending 
Yemen's unity and the march of democracy will triumph. I am 
confident of this because it is a historic inevitability.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, </F>
minister of planning and development, by Kamal Jaballah in 
Sanaa; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of 
planning and development, has expressed his hope that all state 
officials will return to perform their duties in the capital, 
Sanaa, soon after the pledge and accord document is signed. The 
signing of this document is expected to take place in the 
Jordanian capital of Amman on 20 February. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM held at his residence in 
Sanaa, 
Dr. al-Iryani said that the signing of the pledge and accord 
document must be accompanied by the ending of the crushing 
political and economic crisis the unity state has been 
experiencing since 19 August 1993 on security, military, 
administrative, and institutional levels. [passage omitted] 
  The prominent Yemeni figure in the General People's Congress 
Party said that all accusations and claims of conspiracy against 
the cadres and leaderships of the Yemeni Socialist Party are 
political claims without any material evidence to back them up. 
The state is not responsible for them. Also, there are no 
conspiracies to assassinate Yemeni Socialist Party Leader 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, or the 
defense minister. 
  He added that the liquidations in the Socialist Party are 
remnants from the past, which have been reflected in the history 
of the party. 
  Dr. al-Iryani warned that the problem of internal terrorism 
in his country is not linked to the state. There are no Yemeni 
political forces practicing terrorism and political action at 
the same time because they are all seeking to gather popular 
support for themselves. Those who claim otherwise must provide 
the evidence for their allegations. 
  Regarding reports that some Yemeni sides supported terrorism 
abroad, Dr. al-Iryani said that the truth in this matter has 
been presented to President Husni Mubarak. Yemen is still 
waiting for Egyptian security units to visit and see for 
themselves the truth of this claim and other reports that there 
are three terrorist camps in the northern governorates and five 
in the southern governorates. 
  The Yemeni official denied reports about external support to 
kindle the current crisis in his country. He said: "This is not 
true and there is not one single shred of material evidence 
about external support for secession, apart from confirmations 
by a foreign diplomatic source residing in Sanaa. These 
confirmations said that contributions gathered in Saudi Arabia 
to help alleviate the catastrophe of the floods before unity in 
1990, which hit mostly the southern governorates, were seized by 
the Socialist Party leadership in Aden at the end of 1993. The 
amount is somewhere in the region of $37 to $39 million.

  [Excerpts] Damascus -- A prominent Syrian figure yesterday 
said in an official, open, and clear manner that Dr. Bashshar 
al-Asad, President Hafiz al-Asad's second eldest son, will 
assume the duties which used to be carried out by his brother 
Staff Major Basil al-Asad, who was killed in a car crash last 
month. 
  This announcement came in a lecture delivered by Dr. Bahjat 
Sulayman, a senior and influential political figure very close 
to President Hafiz al-Asad. He said: The masses in Syria see 
in Dr. Bashshar al-Asad a guarantee and a symbol needed for the 
continuation and stability of Hafiz al-Asad's line. [passage 
omitted] 
  There have been numerous indications since Basil al-Asad's 
death that Dr. Bashshar al-Asad is going to carry the leadership 
banner and continue the big aspirations launched by his brother, 
Basil. 
  Dr. Bashshar al-Asad is an ophthalmologist who was preparing 
to specialize in a European state when he heard the news of his

  [Text] Amman, Feb 22 (AFP)--A one-time rival of Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad, General Ahmad al-Suwaydani, has been 
freed after spending 25 years in jail, a former inmate said here 
Tuesday [22 February]. 
  Mujalli Nasrawin, a Jordanian who used to be a member of the 
Ba'th party which rules Syria and Iraq, told AFP that 
al-Suwaydani was freed on Monday for health reasons. 
  Himself released from a Syrian jail after 22 years, Nasrawin 
had called Saturday on Damascus to free al-Suwaydani, expressing 
fears he might die in al-Mazzah prison after having suffered an 
attack of hemiplegia. 
  Al-Suwaydani, a Sunni Moslem, was army chief-of-staff on the 
side of Salah Jadid, whose Ba'th party faction clashed with 
al-Asad's in the late 1960s. 
  At that time al-Asad, an Alawite Moslem, was air force chief 
under president Nur-al-Din al-Atasi, a Sunni. 
  In 1968, al-Asad ousted al-Suwaydani, who was jailed a year 
later. In a 1970 coup, al-Asad overthrew al-Atasi to take over 
as president. 
  Al-Atasi was freed in April 1992 and died last December in a 
Paris hospital, while Jadid died last August in a Damascus jail. 
  Some 20 political prisoners have been in jail in Syria for 
more than 20 years, most of them arrested during al-Asad's coup, 
according to international human rights groups.

  [Text] Summit talks between Presidents Ilyas al-Hirawi and 
Hafiz al-Asad are still under way. According to our Damascus 
correspondent, the two presidents met for three and a half hours 
today. Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam attended part of 
the talks. 
  Our correspondent cites sources close to the talks as saying 
that the two presidents discussed Lebanese-Israeli talks, the 
conditions made by Israel, and Israel's position concerning UN 
Security Council Resolution 425. The Lebanese and Syrian 
presidents also reviewed U.S. views concerning Lebanese-Israeli 
talks and the U.S. message to Lebanon, which warns of the 
repercussions of the volatile situation in the south. Al-Hirawi 
and al-Asad stressed the need for coordination between their 
countries in matters of domestic, foreign, diplomatic, and 
security policy. 
  The two presidents met again this afternoon. Sources close 
to the talks say that various domestic issues will be discussed 
in that session.

  [Text] Damascus, Feb 19 (AFP) -- Israel is trying to 
prevent Syria and the United States from establishing normal 
relations, the official Syrian daily AL-THAWRAH charged Saturday 
[19 February]. 
  The paper said Israel "is anxious to detach Syrian-U.S. 
relations from the area of dialogue," fearing that "solid, 
balanced relations may be established, enabling the whole peace 
process to be brought back to its legitimate basis." 
  Israel was escalating tension in south Lebanon "in its 
customary arrogant and aggressive way," in order to pressure 
U.S. President Bill Clinton into "ending or postponing the U.S. 
role in the peace process," AL-THAWRAH said. 
  Israel tried to torpedo the Geneva summit meeting between 
Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad on January 16 
"through pressure and intensive moves inside the U.S. 
administration and in the region," the paper added. 
  "However, we believe the Clinton administration is aware of 
these moves and what lies behind them." 
  Israel and Syria failed to make headway during peace talks 
in 
Washington earlier in the week, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister 
Yosi Beilin told reporters Thursday. 
  Asked whether Israel had moved closer to the Syrian demand 
that Israel fully withdraw from the Golan Heights seized in 1967 
and partially annexed in 1981, Beilin said, "regrettably, no." 
  Israel has refused to withdraw without first getting 
security 
guarantees from Syria. 
  Israel threatened to launch a massive operation in south 
Lebanon after a rocket attack on northern Israel on Wednesday, 
which was claimed by PLO dissidents opposed to the Palestinian 
autonomy deal. 
  The attack provoked intense diplomatic moves by the United 
States, with Washington sending messages to Damascus and Beirut 
calling for restraint. 
  Israel blamed Syria, which has some 35,000 troops in 
Lebanon. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said the attack was a 
"violation" of a U.S.-brokered deal with Damascus last July to 
halt Hizballah guerrilla strikes on Jewish communities. 
  The deal followed a seven-day blitz by Israeli forces in 
south Lebanon which killed 132 people and wounded 500.

  [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri today received U.S. 
Ambassador Mark Hambley and a visiting U.S. military delegation. 
  After the meeting, the U.S. ambassador expressed his belief 
that there will be an opportunity for a truce in Lebanon. He 
said: What is certain is that the only road to peace in the 
region is through negotiations. He added that the United 
States, as well as the Lebanese Government and all other 
governments, wants to see a peaceful solution in Lebanon. 
  Ambassador Hambley said the U.S. military delegation and the 
prime minister discussed a cooperation program between Lebanon 
and the United States that began a year and a half ago and that 
the discussion dealt with some future moves. This visit, he 
remarked, is the first in a series of visits scheduled for the 
delegation. 
  Asked about the likely role of the delegation in the south, 
Hambley said: We have no details on this matter. No doubt the 
Lebanese Armed Forces will play a very important role in south 
Lebanon. We want to help the Lebanese Armed Forces so that they 
are fully equipped in the future. He referred to a technical 
training program in addition to some equipment the United States 
will provide for the Army.

  Al-Hafiz stressed that if the peace process gives Israel

  [Text] Today, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri met 
U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley in the Chamber headquarters. 
Hambley said afterward: I wanted to talk to Speaker Birri about 
particular incidents that occurred last week and to discuss 
developments in south Lebanon and to express my belief that 
controlling the situation there is very important. Right now we 
are focusing on the Washington talks. But we seek to stop these 
attacks, which, I believe, only hinder the ongoing peace process. 
  The U.S. ambassador was asked about his remark that only 
conciliation will solve the problem in south Lebanon. A 
reporter asked him what he meant by conciliation and with whom. 
He said: I believe the basic point needed to secure and 
maintain the ongoing process in Washington is to reach solutions 
that will bring peace to the entire Middle East region. This 
includes all the parties concerned with peace, in other words, 
Lebanon, Israel, Syria, and all the other parties. We must 
maintain the dialogue in Washington to reach the desired 
solutions. 
  Hambley was asked about the positive signs that emerged 
after 
the Geneva summit and about the talks remaining stagnant. Asked 
whether there is a way to push the talks ahead, he replied: I 
think some progress has been made since the talks resumed in 
Washington. We are not imposing a specific time limit on 
negotiators. So we cannot expect instant results. The 
negotiating process is too complicated to make rapid progress. 
What counts is to finally see progress in the right direction 
leading to solutions that are acceptable to everyone. 
  The ambassador was asked about his call to disarm the 
Resistance and about his country's failure to put pressure on 
Israel to implement international resolutions and withdraw from 
the south. He said: Our stance on Resolution 425 is very 
clear. We want to see the foreign troops withdraw from Lebanon, 
as he put it. He added: We hope the Washington talks will be a 
gateway to that goal so that the security and other guarantees 
can be provided. We hope they will guarantee peaceful relations 
among all the parties concerned. 
  Hambley was asked about the repeated U.S. remark that the 
Americans are helping Lebanon at a time when the State 
Department has issued a decision extending the ban on Americans 
traveling to Lebanon. Asked to explain this contradiction, he 
said: This is a very important question. But we must 
distinguish between a decision banning the travel of U.S. 
passport holders, which is based purely on affairs relating to 
security [sentence incomplete as heard]. He added: We can only 
hope the future will show some signs that allow us to revoke 
that decision. It is very important to us to guarantee the 
safety of our sons who visit Lebanon. This is the U.S. 
Government's main concern. The second issue, he added, does not 
mean we did not launch cooperation programs with the Lebanese 
Government. Although cooperation is small, it is continuous and 
we hope it will be expanded.

  [Excerpts] The three-round Lebanese-Syrian summit, which 
lasted for seven hours, dealt with the tense situation in the 
south, developments in the peace process, and the internal 
Lebanese situation, particularly the regime's actions in the 
political and reconstruction fields. 
  President al-Hirawi returned to Beirut last night at the end 
of the Damascus summit. 
  Our correspondent in Damascus has reported that the first 
round of talks lasted three and half hours and was attended by 
Syrian Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam. The two leaders 
discussed the progress made so far on the Lebanese and Syrian 
tracks in Washington and Israel's attempts to circumvent 
Resolution 425. The talks also dealt with the U.S. message that 
warns about the explosive situation in the south. 
  The two presidents' views were identical on the need to 
continue coordination between the two countries to confront 
internal and external developments. 
  During the second round of talks, Presidents al-Hirawi and 
al- Asad discussed the internal situation and bilateral 
relations. [passage omitted] 
  The two leaders concluded their summit with a third round of 
talks in which Khaddam, Prime Minister al-Zu'bi, and Foreign 
Minister al-Shar' attended. The talks dealt with the 
developments in the region after the Geneva summit and the Arab 
situation in light of the visits to Damascus by a number of Arab 
leaders. The two sides also touched on issues of mutual 
interest. 
  The NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY cited presidential sources as 
saying 
that President al-Hirawi raised all issues pertaining to 
Israel's aggressive designs in the south and western al-Biqa'. 
President al-Hirawi also briefed the Syrian officials on the 
course of the Lebanese-Syrian negotiations. He was briefed on 
the progress made in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. 
  According to knowledgeable sources, the local Lebanese 
situation was also discussed during the summit, particularly 
amid increasing parliamentary opposition. It has been learned 
that the two presidents stressed the need for the government to 
promote its efforts by patching up the differences of a number 
of ministries and the dispute between the Labor Ministry and 
trade unions. 
  Citing a Syrian official, REUTER reported that Israel is 
responsible for the failure to achieve any progress in the peace 
negotiations. Israel still refuses to abide by the peace 
process and implement the UN resolutions, according to REUTER. 
The Syrian official emphasized that Israel's failure to 
withdraw from the occupied Arab territories means that the 
negotiations have not achieved the desired objective.

  [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi chaired an expanded 
security meeting at the B'abda Palace this morning. Prime 
Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul, 
Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij, and security officers were 
present. 
  At the end of the meeting, Interior Minister Mirhij made the 
following statement: 
  [Begin recording] [Mirhij] The meeting, which was held at 
the 
presidential palace this morning under the chairmanship of the 
president, was devoted to discussion of all aspects of the 
security situation in the country. The conferees dealt with all 
topics pertaining to security throughout the country. The 
conferees decided to instruct all security services to adopt 
measures that would safeguard the public security in the country 
and the citizens' rights in Lebanon. All security topics on the 
agenda were discussed in depth. 
  We also discussed the elections in the north and 
construction 
violations. We touched on issues on the south as well as all 
issues related to security. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] As for the repeated Israeli 
attacks, can we know what measures were taken at today's meeting 
to deter the repeated Israeli attacks on the south? 
  [Mirhij] The whole Lebanese state is in a state of 
resistance. It rejects occupation and mobilizes all its efforts 
for the sake of ensuring the withdrawal of the Israeli enemy 
from our land in the south. We do not approve of any operation 
that harms the state's responsibility in south Lebanon. 
  [Correspondent] Your Excellency, concerning the bombing of 
the Phalangist Party headquarters, have the investigations 
revealed anything in this regard? 
  [Mirhij] The investigations into the bombing of the 
Phalangist Party headquarters are still going on. The Lebanese 
judiciary is now in charge of the case and it continues its work 
in this regard. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij has affirmed 
that resistance is a result of the occupation. Lebanon has not 
violated the rules of the game, he said. 
  The interior minister denied that Katuysha rockets were 
fired 
at northern Israel. This might have happened and might not, he 
retorted. He wondered why Israel is not brought to account for 
firing shells at south Lebanon. 
  In an interview on Radio Free Lebanon's "Responsible Talk" 
program, Mirhij said that Israel is trying to put pressure on 
the Lebanese people and state to adjust Lebanon's political 
stand to Israel's interests. We support any action our people 
undertake in support of the resistance on their land, he said; 
adding: This is a natural right. 
  Asked if it is likely that Israel will launch a large-scale 
military operation in Lebanon, Mirhij said: Everything is 
possible. We are preparing for all possibilities. So far, signs 
coming from Israel's direction are certainly not peaceful, he 
said. 
  The interior minister added: We insist on having 
understanding and coordination with Syria. We will not deviate 
from that course, because it enables Lebanon to adopt the right 
attitude. Mirhij believes that Israel was not comfortable with 
the Geneva summit because it emphasized Syria's regional power. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked if it will be possible to guarantee the necessary 
security for the Pope's visit, Mirhij said: If we were not 
capable of doing that we would not have taken the initiative. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked about Palestinians in Lebanon, Mirhij affirmed that 
they have rights as Arab subjects living on Lebanese territory 
against their will. Until they return to their homeland, they 
will be treated as brothers and Arabs, he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Security information from inside the occupied strip 
reports that the Zionist occupation forces recently sliced off 
vast areas of Lebanese territory in the hills of Saddanah which 
lie alongside al-Majidiyah farm at the southwestern corner of 
the Golan Heights and annexed them to the occupied territories. 
  Citing eyewitnesses, the reports said that the Israelis have 
built asphalt roads through the al-Malikiyah gateway, which they 
set up in 1948, to these hills, which they now have linked to 
the farms in Shab'a. They occupied the latter in 1967. The 
reports add that the occupation forces set up many camps and 
observation posts in these heights and surrounded them with 
barbed wire. In addition, they set up iron pillars, flood 
lights, and other military equipment. They also imposed a 
curfew under the pretext that these are military areas. It is 
worth noting here that the Israelis established many settlements 
among the farms of Shab'a and built roads linking them to the 
Tiberias area many years ago.

  [Text] The Lebanese judiciary is eager to handle the murder 
of the Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah with extreme 
delicacy and secure the defense for those charged with the 
murder, who belong to the Abu-Nidal-led Fatah Movement--the 
Revolutionary Council [FRC]. The defendants are interrogated in 
the presence of Bisharah Abu-Sa'd, a lawyer who is a partner and 
the brother-in-law of Deputy Najah Wakim. 
  AL-SHIRA' previously reported that the Abu-Nidal group 
undertakes the personal protection of Deputy Wakim by providing 
him with a permanent escort of armed men. Hence, Wakim adheres 
to the FRC line and adopts it in his political positions.

  [Text] Baghdad -- PETRA -- Taha Yasin Ramadan, Iraqi vice 
president and member of the Revolution Command Council, has said 
that the next few months will be decisive because there are no 
more large obstacles or basic difficulties facing the 
implementation of Paragraph 22 of UN Security Council Resolution 
687, which deals with lifting the embargo on Iraq acccording to 
a specified timetable. He said his country is waiting to see 
what the UN Security Council and other international quarters 
concerned with peace, security, and rights, will do, especially 
since dialogue and talks between Iraq and the United Nations are 
proceeding in a good and objective manner. 
  In a statement to the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY in Baghdad, 
Ramadan denied the accusation leveled at his country every now 
and then that it is obstructing the work of international 
inspection teams. He said: What we want to see first is an 
evaluation of things within the framework of UN Security Council 
Resolution 687 despite its unfairness as it was imposed in the 
time of tyranny and hegemony. He noted that Iraq accepted 
Resolution 715 which was not mentioned previously, adding that 
this resolution calls for installing long-term monitoring 
cameras. He said: We believed that this was the only thing 
that would obstruct the talks and settlement of differences with 
the United Nations. He stressed that the maneuvers and 
accusations against Iraq, which usually precede reviewing the 
decision to lift the blockade, are false accusations. 
  Ramadan said that the imposition of the blockade was not 
just 
a punishment for an act of encroachment; namely, entering 
Kuwait, but is aimed against Iraq, its entity, accomplishments, 
potentials, and resources. He added that the sanctions imposed 
on Iraq -- which encroached on every inch of its land and which 
deprived its people of food, water, medicine, and all basic 
needs -- also aim at creating confusion and chaos in addition to 
fabricating lies one time after another. The objective, he 
added, is to implement their schemes and fabricate accusations 
that Iraq dropped chemical weapons on the shiites in the 
marshlands, southern Iraq. Iraq has called on the inspection 
teams and the states of the world to visit the area and verify 
our statements. 
  Asked about a scheduled visit by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister 
Tariq 'Aziz to the United Nations during the next few days and 
the issues to be focused on during his talks, Ramadan said that 
the essential point in Iraq's program is to reach a formula to 
fully lift the economic embargo on Iraq, whether all at once or 
gradually. He said: Our stand vis-a-vis this matter is firm. 
We do not accept partial things, because the economic embargo 
is not on oil only. We categorically reject the formula which 
they are trying to impose on us. He said: They want us to sell 
limited quantities of oil. We consider this a blatant 
interference in our national sovereignty and with our 
potentials. This is one of the most controversial points. 
Furthermore, we firmly believe that this unjust formula which 
they are trying to impose on us will become a curtain for them 
to hide behind while continuing to impose the embargo. Although 
we do not deny the importance of oil as one of the major pillars 
of our country's economy, the other economic potentials, which 
existed in the past and which will appear in the future, are not 
less important. In addition to the natural resources which 
exist in Iraq, we became capable of production in the 
industrial, agricultural, mineral, and human fields. 
  Ramadan denied the rumors that Iraq possesses a number of 
long-range nuclear missiles installed by the United States in 
Kuwait to strike at the Soviet Union before it was divided. He 
said that these baseless rumors aim at showing that Iraq still 
possesses such weapons, and consequently, it should be pursued 
and pressure on it should continue. 
  He stressed that a number of countries such as Spain, 
Greece, 
Switzerland, Britain, and Australia have released part of the 
Iraqi assets to finance the purchase of food and medicine 
supplies. He expressed his regret, however, that some Arab 
countries have not yet released the Iraqi assets they hold. 
  He announced that his country is willing to forget the past, 
to deal with and normalize relations with any party, even with 
the United States, based on its principles and convictions and 
according to new calculations that take everything that has 
happened into consideration.

  [Text] London -- A high-ranking Kurdish official told 
AL-HAYAH yesterday that an Iranian military helicopter landed in 
the village of Malumah in the area of Mawat in Iraqi Kurdistan 
the day before yesterday and that one of its two pilots applied 
to the Kurdish Government for political asylum. 
  The official, who is Hushyar Zibari, representative of the 
Kurdish Administration in Britain, said the authorities in 
al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate have begun interrogation of the two 
pilots -- Habib Ruhaymi, a Kurd who requested political asylum, 
and Iraj Kalanaljin, an Iranian who expressed a desire to return 
to Iran. There has been no Iranian comment on this matter. 
  This is the first time the Kurdish Administration has been 
faced with such incident since the parliamentary elections held 
in May 1992 resulting in the formation of a government in Iraqi 
Kurdistan. 
  It should be noted that relations between that 
administration 
and Iran deteriorated seriously last month as a result of the 
Iranian forces' artillery shelling and penetration of Kurdish 
areas on the pretext of hunting Kurds opposed to the Tehran 
regime and using Iraqi Kurdistan as a base. 
  It is known that the region's administration provides 
shelter 
for the Iranian Kurdish opposition parties and allows them 
political activity in the areas under its control. It has 
firmly rejected Iranian requests for the extradition of these 
oppositionists or their expulsion from the region, but it did 
ask these parties to move their offices to areas away from the 
borders with Iran to prevent them being used as an excuse for 
continuation of the shelling and penetration operations which 
have already claimed some Kurdish civilian victims.

  [Text] Baghdad--Security reports leaked to AL-BILAD from 
Baghdad have indicated that bloody clashes took place between 
black market foreign currency dealers and the Republican Guards 
in al-Shurjah and the Baghdad International Fair area last week. 
  These clashes resulted in the death of four Republican 
Guards 
personnel in the Baghdad International Fair area. 
  These clashes came on the heels of sweeping arrests and the 
confiscation of some $2 million from the ranks of foreign 
currency dealers. 
  AL-BILAD has also learned that foot patrols have been 
deployed in areas suspected of being used for foreign currency 
dealings. Stringent instructions have been issued to the Iraqi 
customs officials along the borders in the Tirbil area, asking 
them to institute several measures, including body searches of 
departing travelers. They were ordered to search for and 
confiscate any kind of currencies, and to refer to court anyone 
found in possession of undeclared currencies. The Iraqi customs 
officials were also instructed to search incoming and outgoing 
vehicles and confiscate anything that looks to be excess 
luggage, even if it is cigarettes, personal effects, and leather 
jackets, in particular. 
  The Iraqi border officials were also instructed to enforce 
certain measures regarding Arab travelers leaving Iraq. 
Foremost among these measures is that Arab residents who want 
to leave Iraq must obtain departure permits from the Arab 
Citizens Affairs Department, regardless of the time they have 
spent in Iraq, even if it is only 24 hours. This supersedes an 
earlier regulation which stipulated that only those who stayed 
in Iraq for one month or longer were required to obtain 
departure permits. 
  Also, all Iraqi hotels of the first, second, and third 
classes have been ordered to obtain boarding charges from Arabs 
in dollars. This regulation applied only to first and second 
class hotels in the past.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Shura Council of the Muslim </F>
Brotherhood in Syria dated "January 1994;" --read by announcer] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Praise be to God the Almighty, and prayers and 
peace be upon the noblest prophet and his family, companions, 
and those who righteously follow him, until the day of judgment. 
  The Shura [Consultative] Council of the Muslim Brotherhood 
in 
Syria held its third ordinary session amid serious domestic, 
regional, and international circumstances. The Council 
discussed urgent Brotherhood issues and important internal 
affairs. It adopted the appropriate measures, and made 
decisions and recommendations on each of these affairs. 
  The Council also studied the longstanding and recent crises 
in the Syrian arena in particular and in the Arab and Islamic 
arenas in general. The Council began with the issue of Syria, 
which has become private real estate for members of the al-Asad 
family, so they can do whatever they please, loot the food of 
Syria's sons, and demoralize its generations in a way that will 
help weaken the nation, so that they will maintain control of 
its destiny. Moreover, the al-Asad family members are selling to 
the enemies the Syrian territory which they deem necessary to 
sell in order to entrench their thrones in the remaining 
territories. 
  Generally, human sentiments become more sympathetic in the 
event of death. However, these sentiments take another form 
when death becomes a cheap merchandise, which politicians trade 
in, so they can obtain popular gains and consecrate the theft of 
public property; namely, the ruling of the country. This was 
watched by the sons of Syria and the entire world on the Syrian 
television screens. Kings, emperors, ingenious men, and 
historic leaders have died, but was life paralyzed in any world 
country due to the death of one man in the same way it was 
paralyzed in Syria for more than a week? 
  Does this not simply mean that a single son of Hafiz al-Asad 
is actually more important than all Syria and the areas of life 
that were obstructed throughout Syria--agriculture, industry, 
commerce, science, education, and politics? Does the 
fabrication of marches and the massing of tens of thousands of 
people from Syria, Lebanon, and other countries not mean that 
the al-Asad regime is totally bankrupt and that it needs booster 
doses to restore some of its shaken prestige? 
  Death is no reason to rejoice over others' grief, because it 
is the destiny of everyone. However, given that his son has 
died, the tyrant [Hafiz al-Asad], will taste the bitterness of 
losing a dear one, something al-Asad has caused for thousands of 
fathers and mothers. Knowing that Hafiz al-Asad had prepared 
his deceased son to succeed him in ruling and running the 
al-Asad ranch, Syria, the way he pleases, should al-Asad 
continue to repeat worn-out words such as the people, democracy, 
and freedom? 
  If people are asked to believe such words, can the Syrian 
people in particular be asked to do so, knowing that this people 
is denied the freedom of expression, and that the Syrians were 
forced into voicing something contrary to what they feel and 
believe? What is important for al-Asad is to reiterate such 
words as the people, freedom, and democracy, so some European 
and U.S. politicians as well as the masters of the new world 
order will hear them and pretend to believe them in the presence 
of some intellectuals who care for human rights. Based on these 
words, these masters would pay funds and extend aid to the 
al-Asad regime and help him entrench his throne which is built 
on human skulls. They would also enhance his distinguished role 
in finalizing the suspect deal [reference to the Middle East 
peace process]. 
  Palestine is part of the Middle East and the entire Islamic 
world and its cause was planned to be very complicated. 
Therefore, it is not strange to see that the settlement of this 
cause is taking place in many phases and through many deals. 
Part of the price is paid before the settlement takes place, 
another part is paid during the settlement, and other parts are 
paid at the end of the settlement. How will Hafiz al-Asad pay 
the price? Will he pay it from the accounts of Syria, 
Palestine, or Lebanon? In exchange, the throne will be kept and 
bank accounts will increase. 
  The Clinton-al-Asad meeting is clear evidence of this; and 
the assistance of Europe, which has ignored human rights, is 
further strong evidence. Hafiz al-Asad's practices over the 
past 25 years in Syria, Lebanon, and in the Palestinian arena 
are a fact which expresses all this. So, what now? The sons of 
the Syrian people know how to remove their shackles and to break 
the gates of their big jail now that they have become aware of 
the dangers of the game and its terrible dimensions. 
  If Hafiz al-Asad wants the Syrian people to believe his 
calls 
for freedom and democracy he is required to convince the people 
-- through some practical moves -- of the soundness of his 
claims. The prisons are still full of victims who have a right 
to freedom; the thousands of displaced people also have rights 
in their homeland; the thousands of starving people have the 
right to an honorable life; and the freedom of thinking must see 
the light. The people will not believe any call by the regime 
before the return of their usurped rights. 
  O sons of our lofty people in beloved Syria; O sons of the 
Arabs and Muslims: The philosophy of the new world order has 
become known to all and its basic features are seen by every 
wise man. The new world order simply aims at crushing Islam and 
its people in the Islamic world, in fact, in the entire world. 
The new world order wants America -- at the instructions of 
world Zionism -- to unilaterally make the decisions of the 
entire Islamic world. The new world order wants the Muslims to 
kill each other and to destroy each other -- Islamists against 
nationalists, extremists against moderates, and rulers against 
people. Each of those is required to crush the other party or 
remove it from the arena so that this injured Islamic world 
remains fumbling in the whirlpool of violence, blood, fire, 
ignorance, and destruction. They want the Islamic world to 
remain fragmented; they want the fighters to continue to beg for 
weapons; and they want the starving people to continue to beg 
for morsels of bread so that the masters of civilization and 
human rights will bestow morsels of bread on them. Proof is 
everywhere -- to the East of the Islamic world and its West, 
Asia and Africa. 
  We do not need to mention the ongoing massacres in Somalia 
and Afghanistan as well as the small and big whirlpools between 
them. All our nation must be fully aware of the surrounding 
dangers, otherwise, nobody will survive the shipwreck. 
  When will those fighting each other understand this? When 
will they understand that the besieged children of Iraq are the 
children of the nation? When will they understand that the 
unity of Iraq -- land, people, and entity -- is part of this 
nation's unity and an important pillar of its existence which is 
threatened now and in the future? When will they understand 
that the people of Sudan, who are besieged and threatened 
because they adhere to their doctrine, territorial integrity, 
and independent decisionmaking, are also a big asset for the 
dignity of the entire nation? 
  The other tragedy is that of our Muslim brothers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the tragedy of our steadfast militant 
people in occupied Palestine. Defenseless people are fighting 
with stones against armies equipped with the most sophisticated 
lethal weapons, against the plots of the international 
community, and against biased, silent, and maneuvering parties. 
It is not strange to see that the jihad of the fedayeen of the 
Hamas organization and the militants of Bosnia-Herzegovina are 
achieving the victory of defenseless justice over armed 
falsehood even if the price is very high. 
  In order to stop the bloodshed of our people at the hands of 
enemies and their agents; and in order to save the nation from 
the [Indian] Ocean to the [Atlantic] Ocean, the Muslim 
Brotherhood in Syria calls on all parties to hold genuine 
national dialogue -- and we underscore the word genuine -- to 
place the higher interests above all interests in Algeria, 
Tunisia, and in Egypt as well as in every country and in every 
part of our nation. The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria calls for a 
constructive and meaningful dialogue that turns the conflict 
among brothers within the same country, the one people, and the 
one nation into a battle against the external enemies who do not 
differentiate between a ruler and the people. 
  We have great hope that awareness will return to this nation 
and its warring parties. The evidence of this is the success of 
a number of democratic experiments in many Arab countries, such 
as Jordan and Yemen. Further evidence is the increasing number 
of voices calling for political pluralism, public liberties, and 
human rights in every Arab and Islamic part. We should here 
recall the effects of the Gulf crisis on the economic situation 
in Jordan and the unjust blockade of the al-'Aqabah Port because 
of its concern for the unity of the Arab ranks. 
  What strengthens the hope is the growing spirit of 
solidarity 
among the sons of the nation and the close viewpoints among its 
intellectual and political currents. The support, which our 
oppressed group received over the past 14 years, is another sign 
of the general awakening and the continuation of the values of 
wellbeing and justice. 
  On this occasion, the Shura Council expresses its thanks and 
gratitude to all the states, parties, organizations, and 
individuals who gave support and provided shelter. 
  Let us raise our voices and call for putting an end to the 
wars of the brothers and shutting the mouths of those who 
beautify injustice in front of unjust people and degrade science 
in front of rulers. Let us unite minds and arms to champion 
human rights everywhere. Let us strengthen Islamic awakening to 
lead the nation to dignity, unity, and full liberation. Let us 
work together to build a new world whose slogan is dialogue, not 
injustice, plotting, or domination. 
  O mankind! We created you from a single pair of a male and a 
female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know 
each other not that ye may despise each other. Verily the most 
honored of you in the sight of God is he who is the most 
righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well 
acquainted with all things. [Koranic verse] 
  [Dated] Sha'ban 1414 Hegira, corresponding to January 1994 
  [Signed] The Shura Council of the Muslim Brotherhood in 
Syria

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 23, IRNA -- The Islamic Republic of 
Iran has volunteered to contribute to the United Nations 
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina but the response by 
the U.N. implies unexplainable wariness, said an Iranian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman here Tuesday. 
  The spokesman, Mahmoud Mohammadi, told IRNA that Iranian 
Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati had informed the U.N. 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali of Iran's preparedness to 
do so and was awaiting the U.N. response to mobilize troops to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina under the supervision of the United Nations. 
  He said Iran's proposal had been previously upheld by the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and by the last 
assembly of the foreign ministers of the nonaligned countries in 
Jakarta earlier this month. 
  Asked to comment on NATO's ultimatum to Serbian forces, he 
said NATO had not demanded the Serbs to end their siege of 
Sarajevo but simply to distance their artillery pieces from the 
besieged Muslim city. As far as NATO is concerned, he added, 
the ultimatum was solely a propaganda device for face-saving and 
for breaking NATO's long silence and not as a genuine warning to 
the Serbs. 
  Commenting on the current negotiations in Tehran between 
Iranian officials and members of an Iraqi delegation who are 
here since last Thursday, he said that the main topic in their 
agenda is that of the prisoners of war, adding that a joint 
committee of officials of the two countries were proceeding with 
the task. 
  The second most important item in the talks with the Iraqis, 
he said, is that of the fate of a number of Iraqi warplanes that 
were allowed to land in Iran immediately before the outbreak of 
the war of the allied powers with Iraq for its invasion of 
Kuwait in 1990. 
  He said the Chinese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Foregin Affairs Qian Qichen is to arrive in Tehran for a 
three-day official visit Friday 4 march. 
  The Chinese minister's talks with the Iranian officials, the 
spokesman noted, would focus primarily on bilateral relations, 
mutual cooperation at international organizations, and also 
cooperation in Central Asia.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 22, IRNA -- Head of the 15th of Khordad 
Foundation (which has set a prize for Salman Rushdie's head), 
Ayatollah Hasan Sane'i believes that the time is now appropriate 
to carry out the death sentence against the apostate author of 
'The Satanic Verses.' 
  The morning daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' quoted Ayatollah 
Sane'i 
as saying that five years after the death verdict was issued 
against the Indian-born British author, the world Muslims now 
fully realised the matter. 
  The desperate attempts of Rushdie and his western backers 
too 
have only failed to lift the verdict and have only added to 
Muslims' wrath. 'Today the situation is appropriate more than 
any other time for the execution of Salman Rushdie,' the 
ayatollah stressed. 
  Ayatollah Sane'i underlined that the Islamic countries 
solidarity as well as the Organization of Islamic Conference's 
(OIC) renewed support for the verdict against Rushdie as factors 
paving the way to carry out the death decree. 
  According to western media, the ayatollah said, Rushdie was 
gradually dying and even the police protection failed to improve 
his morale. 'It is the fate of anyone who insults Prophet 
Muhammad (PBUH) and over one billion Muslims' sanctities.' 
  Referring to formation of some European committees to 
support 
the apostate writer, the ayatollah said their act too was an 
insult to the sanctities of Muslims.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 22, IRNA -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani here Tuesday introduced his candidate for the 
post of minister of culture and Islamic guidance Mostafa 
Mirsalim to Majlis deputies who are to cast their votes on him 
today. Addressing the deputies, Rafsanjani referred to Mirsalim 
as a "veteran revolutionary" with a record of political and 
cultural activities since being a university student. He noted 
that the leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah 'Ali 
Khamene'i is highly satisfied with Mirsalim. "He used to be one 
of my active advisors with a prominant role in the Supreme 
Council of Cultural Revolution," Rafsanjani added. 
  He said he expected that Mirsalim, "gaining a powerful vote 
of the Majlis, would enjoy a good executive support for 
fulfilling this difficult task." 
  Rafsanjani also appreciated the services of 'Ali Larijani 
who 
vacated the ministerial seat after being appointed by the leader 
as the new chief of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting 
(IRIB). 
  [Tehran IRNA in English at 0754 GMT on 22 February, in 
another Tehran-datelined item, adds the following: "Mostafa 
Mirsalim, the candidate for the post of minister of culture and 
Islamic guidance, received a vote of confidence from Majlis 
deputies here Tuesday. Out of 224 deputies present in the 
Majlis session today, 178 voted for, 27 against and 19 
abstained. Mirsalim, 46, is a postgraduate of mechanics. He 
previously served in many key posts such as deputy interior 
minister and presidential advisor."]

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] After President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani's speech and since there were no deputies who 
had registered their names to speak against Mr. Mirsalim's 
ministerial appointment, three deputies spoke in favor of his 
appointment. They pointed to the sensitive nature of the 
current situation and the importance of the Ministry of Culture 
and Islamic guidance's responsibilities. They considered that 
Mr. Mirsalim was qualified for the post. 
  Next, Mr. Mostafa Mirsalim, minister of culture and Islamic 
guidance, explained the main points of his programs aimed at 
achieving the cultural objectives of the revolution. He 
described the extensive dimensions of the western cultural 
onslaught against Islamic culture. He said: In confronting such 
an onslaught, we should safeguard our indigenous culture and 
Islamic values with all our being. He emphasized: The most 
important factor in spiritual growth is to raise the cultural 
level of the public and this is a priority and an essential part 
of our work. All programs should be formulated and supplied 
within the framework of Islamic values. 
  The minister of culture and Islamic guidance said that the 
lack of clear opinions based on religious jurisprudence that 
could resolve certain matters concerning the art world, the 
unequal distribution of art facilities in the country, and also 
the question of training and retraining of specialized and 
effective managers for the cultural and art sectors of the 
country, are among existing bottlenecks. He hoped that through 
the efforts of relevant officials, these bottlenecks will be 
removed as soon as possible.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 22, IRNA -- Mostafa Mirsalim who 
received a vote of confidence from the Majlis as the new 
minister of culture and Islamic guidance earlier today, outlined 
his programs after President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani introduced 
him to the deputies. 
  Mirsalim thanked the leader of the Islamic revolution 
Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i and President Rafsanjani for their 
confidence in him and disclosed the western conspiracies against 
the Islamic Republic. 
  He underlined the importance of the Islamic culture for the 
Iranian nation and said today's world is faced with the 
domination-seeking tendencies of certain heinous states who 
insist to score cultural supremacy through dominating over other 
nations so as to pave the way for pocketing more interests. 
  Underlining the extensive dimension of the cultural assault, 
he said that only last year, 40 European and American research 
centers have published 214 books and 300 articles on Iran and 
Islam while 16 counterrevolutionary and eight foreign radio 
stations broadcast programs in Persian. He added that 1,100 
counterrevolutionary t.v. stations also broadcast programs in 
Persian and 214 publishing centers of Iranians and non-Iranians 
abroad distributed 315 books in Persian in an effort to mock the 
Islamic values and to level accusations against Iran. 
  Giving more statistics, he also said that 310 cultural 
centers abroad were engaged in activities against the Persian 
and Islamic culture through publishing materials in 114 
periodicals in Persian while world's leading publications have 
published 110 articles on Iran and Islam. 
  Moreover, he added, eight world conferences were held on 
Iran 
during the period including the one on Iran-U.S. relations known 
as Clinton conference. 
  The minister underlined that cultural growth is more 
important than economic and social growth. Mirsalim noted that 
language is the main medium for transfer of cultural concepts 
and that he plans to make efforts towards "preserving and 
strengthening the eloquent Persian language while at the same 
time to refine the language of alien words." He added that 
efforts will also be made to promote Persian in other regions 
particluarly in Persian speaking countries. 
  As another domain of his plans, he said that he will protect 
the rights of the writers and artists and systematize cultural 
and research centers. 
  As far as cultural relations with foreign countries are 
concerned, he said that facilities would be provided for 
cultural cooperation with the Central Asian states while such 
cooperation with Pakistan and Afghanistan would be strengthened 
and cultural ties with the Persian Gulf littoral states would be 
continued.

  [Excerpts] The American ambassador to Sudan, in an 
unprecedented and unjustified act, and without the consent of 
the Sudanese Government, entered southern Sudan across the 
Kenyan border and visited rebel occupied areas. According to 
Sudanese officials his visit was aimed at encouraging and 
equipping the rebels, who have recently suffered heavy defeats. 
  The action, which was taken on the orders of American 
President Clinton, is an undisputed violation of Sudanese 
national sovereignty and ridicules the definite principles of 
international law. 
  The American Government's intervention reveals the long 
standing support given by this country to the southern Sudanese 
cessationists and adds a page to the bulky record of state 
terrorism by Washington's leaders. 
  In a similar action, in coordination with the British 
ambassador to Sudan, the Archbishop of Canterbury also travelled 
to southern Sudan some while ago, but this led to a firm 
response by the Sudanese Government and the expulsion of the 
British ambassador from the country. 
  At the time the Sudanese Government also warned the U.S. 
ambassador regarding intervention in Sudan's internal affairs 
and support for terrorism, and called on him to be aware of the 
consequences of such actions. 
  However, with no concern for the warnings, America, while 
leading the Western world, continued to increase pressure on 
Sudan in various ways from both inside and abroad. 
  The propaganda horns were once again sounded to poison 
public 
opinion, while standard Western practices used to bring down 
independent countries refusing submission were put into effect 
-- countries which in the opinion of the West are enemies 
because they are not in the Western camp. Reports on violations 
of human rights and of Sudanese Government support for terrorism 
were transmitted constantly. Seminars and congresses by the 
Sudanese opposition in Western countries were given priority 
news coverage, and there were even reports about direct Western 
intervention to divide the country. Western crocodile tears 
were shed in sympathy with minorities in southern Sudan, while 
Western governments not only turn a blind eye to the rights of 
the majority in various parts of the world, including Bosnia and 
Algeria, but are active in denying these rights by cooperating 
with the violators. [passage omitted]. 
  Obviously, in the final analysis the West will have to bear 
the negative consequences of these irresponsible actions and 
double-standard policies. Such actions will only increase 
instability in the international order and will lead the world 
toward new chaos and disorder.

  [Text] The assassination of a French citizen in Algiers and 
the violent incidents of the past few days in several Algerian 
cities confirm that opposition has rekindled after about one 
month of calm. The recent clashes between government forces and 
Islamists resulted in 30 deaths on both sides. Opposition 
forces in Sidi Bel Abbes have attacked and set fire to 
government offices and institutions and gas station workers have 
gone on strike. 
  The resumption of such incidents in Algeria shows that the 
period of optimism toward the government of Algerian President 
General Zeroual has ended and, having given up all hopes for any 
type of political reform by the government, the opposition has 
once again resorted to struggle. 
  Since coming to power one month ago, General Zeroual, who 
was 
designated as president by the former coup council, has been 
constantly announcing that he will soon pave the way for a 
national reconciliation and will start talks with the 
opposition. However, he has not taken any steps toward this; 
and possibly, this is the main reason for the resumption of 
violence in Algeria. 
  Algerian prisons continue to be filled with political 
prisoners. Some of Algeria's political parties remain illegal 
and are unable to carry out overt activities. By taking 
advantage of the state of emergency regulations, which have not 
yet been lifted, Algerian forces carry out attacks on 
residential areas on a daily basis and every so often they kill 
several opposition members. The newly established statesmen in 
Algeria have not taken any steps to reinstate the rights of 
those who were elected by the people--rights that were usurped 
by the former coup council. Moreover, by ordering the Islamists 
to refrain from opposing the current rulers, the statesmen 
continue the former suppressive conditions. 
  These suppressive conditions show that the current situation 
in Algeria is not very different from the situation that 
prevailed a month ago. The only difference is that the ruling 
pawns have changed. The continuation of the suppressive climate 
in Algeria has destroyed all grounds for goodwill by the 
opposition and is gradually returning Algeria to the past 
violent situation. In this climate, the current Algerian 
Government is responsible for the blood that is shed and the 
destruction that is done.

  [Text] North Korea has taken new steps on the eve of the 
assembly of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] heads 
in Vienna. On Monday [21 February] Pyongyang put forth new 
conditions for the inspection of its nuclear installations by 
the IAEA. Among these conditions is the date for this 
inspection. 
  North Korea has made the date of the inspection of its 
nuclear installations contingent on the progress in the 
U.S.-North Korean talks, which are to be held in New York. In 
North Korea's opinion, the precise date of the inspection should 
be in coordination with the date that the United States has set 
for its other decisions on North Korea. 
  Probably, Pyongyang wants all the aspects of the issue to be 
clarified before the inspection of its nuclear installations by 
the IAEA. It seems that what North Korea means by U.S. 
decisions is the cancellation of the joint military maneuvers by 
the United States and South Korea and U.S. economic assistance 
to North Korea. 
  At the same time, Pyongyang has announced that it has agreed 
only to a limited inspection of its nuclear installations and 
has threatened that if it is pressured to expand this inspection 
it will cancel its agreement with the IAEA. On the basis of 
this agreement, North Korea will allow the IAEA to inspect only 
seven of its nine nuclear bases. North Korea's objective behind 
this threat is to gain an IAEA guarantee from the very start 
that it will not apply pressure about the other two nuclear 
sites. The developments in the Korean peninsula will be 
determined by the IAEA's reply to North Korea. 
  Political analysts believe Pyongyang's new actions are a 
result of the pressure that the United States has placed on it 
through threats. Negative action leads to negative reaction, 
and as long as the United States ignores North Korea's wishes 
and intends to pressure that country, it will have no 
alternative but to retaliate. 
  At any rate, if the United States and the IAEA ignore North 
Korea's recent threat, the talks may reach an impasse. 
Moreover, Pyongyang will prevent an inspection by the IAEA. 
Thus, the crisis in the Korean peninsula will become more 
complicated and finding a solution will become more difficult.

  [Text] Tehran, 27 Dey [17 Jan] (KEYHAN News Service) -- In 
the continued investigation of the complaint from 'Ali Akbar 
Sa'idi-Sirjani about the publication of an article criticizing 
his views in the publication KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, the trial of 
KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's managing director will begin this year in the 
month of Esfand [20 February-19 March 1994] at the Tehran Public 
Prosecutor's Office. 
  According to the summons issued by the Ministry of Justice 
Palace on 5 Dey [26 December] for 'Abbas Salimi-Namin, managing 
director of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, the trial is scheduled for 1000 on 
8 Esfand [27 February] this year at Tehran Penal Court 2, Branch 
199. 
  In this summons, the charge against the managing director of 
KEYHAN-E HAVA'I is said to be "publishing lies." 
  Sa'idi-Sirjani began his complaint against KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's 
managing director in the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 
1990], when an article criticizing his writing in the newspaper 
ETTELA'AT was published in KEYHAN-E HAVA'I. Investigation of 
this case was begun in earnest at that time by the Ministry of 
Justice. The managing director of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I has been 
summoned several times to give explanations to the public 
prosecutor, and according to the most recent summons, his trial 
is to begin in the month of Esfand. 
  After questioning the managing director of KEYHAN-E HAVA'I 
and listening to his explanations, the special investigator for 
this case determined that Sa'idi-Sirjani's claim could not be 
pursued and announced that the investigation of the case was 
closed, but the Tehran deputy prosecutor canceled the 
investigator's opinion and reopened the case. 
  Sa'idi-Sirjani is among those who are interviewed on foreign 
radio programs such as the BBC and the Voice of America, usually 
about cultural, social, and sometimes political matters, and his 
writing is published in Persian-language newspapers published 
abroad.

  [Text] (News Service) -- The creation of a cable television 
network is prohibited without approval from the Voice and Visage 
organization and no one has the right to have a cable television 
organization. 
  The public relations office of the Voice and Vision 
organization reports that Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, chief of this 
organization, gave a speech at a gathering of public relations 
managers in the Voice and Vision organization, in which he 
announced the above. He said: The question of cable networks was 
not raised in the way it was discussed in the press. In an 
agreement with the Ministry of Guidance, the Voice and Vision 
organization announced that if films made by that ministry are 
produced in accordance with the Voice and Vision organization's 
broadcast rules and criteria, this organization will broadcast 
the films on national and province center networks. 
  He noted: The goal in doing this is to occupy the free time 
of the people, and especially those who are unable to buy video 
equipment. 
  Hashemi discussed the responsibility of the public relations 
office of the Voice and Vision organization. He said: The Voice 
and Vision organization is not understood by the general public 
because of the complexity and variety of its work and 
activities. Many people do not know about the problems of radio 
and television programming. For this reason, to show these 
complexities, the public relations office of the Voice and 
Vision organization must set up production programs in order to 
take effective steps to make better contact with its audience. 
  Mohsenian Rad, a university professor, also spoke at this 
meeting on the role and place of public relations in society. He 
said: Public relations must try to create a positive outlook in 
society and it must oppose negative outlooks. 
  He said that the success of a desirable public relations 
office depends on increasing the knowledge and information of 
the individuals in that public relations office on a daily basis.

Amman-based Fatah-Revolutionary Council leader and former 
prisoner, to report to them. Meanwhile, they searched his house 
and detained him, along with others, most of whom were veteran 
prisoners who spent many long years in jail. They had been 
freed in early 1990.

<F P=106> [Report by Ra'id Salihah] </F>
  [Text] Swiftly, and without any prior notice, the security 
agencies arrested every member of Abu-Nidal's [Sabri al-Banna] 
Fatah-the Revolutionary Council group in Jordan in an operation 
that lasted no more than 48 hours. The operation started 
Saturday [19 February] morning and ended Sunday evening. 
  Despite the fact that the security agencies are keeping a 
tight lid on this swift operation, preliminary information 
leaked to AL-BILAD by well-informed sources reveals that the 
operation was only a warning message and a precautionary 
measure. At the same time, these sources confirmed that Syrian 
and Lebanese security agencies have separately obtained 
confessions from the individuals accused in the assassination of 
martyr Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah [Jordanian diplomat assassinated in 
Beirut on 29 January] to the effect that they had organizational 
links with Abu-Nidal's group. These sources also believe that 
members of the Abu-Nidal group in Jordan were deceived by their 
leadership, which convinced them that it had no connection 
whatsoever to al-Ma'ayitah's assassination. 
  AL-BILAD obtained a highly-classified file, supported by 
documents and information. The file shows, beyond any doubt, 
that some members of Abu-Nidal group intended to carry out 
bloody operations in Jordan. This was revealed in a secret 
leaflet, circulated on a very limited basis inside the group, 
which shows that the group is furious with the security agencies 
despite clear attempts by the group leaders in Jordan to label 
relations between the Revolutionary Council and Jordan as very 
calm. 
  The latest Revolutionary Council statement to reveal this 
hostile attitude appeared on 29 November 1993. The communique, 
stamped by the movement's official seal, cites a statement 
issued by the Central Committee of the Palestine National 
Liberation Movement-General Command of the al-'Asifah Forces-The 
Revolutionary Council. The statement says "...we urge every Arab 
citizen living on the land of our nation to realize the threats 
of the Judaization campaign. This campaign threatens destructive 
civil wars, which have started in Palestine today and are 
expected to explode on the Jordanian arena in the next few 
months. It is regrettable that in Jordan an agency, which has 
no work or mission but to pursue our movement's members and 
mujahidin, continues to exist." The same statement also notes 
that operations will be carried out this year without specifying 
where. The statement says "... we also stress to the concerned 
factions, which claim responsibility for operations we had the 
honor to carry out, that we cannot keep silent after 1 January 
1994." 
  The statement vehemently attacks Tunisia, Algeria, and 
Morocco. The same attack was reaffirmed in another statement 
issued by the Revolutionary Council on 1 January 1994 on the 
29th anniversary of the movement [Fatah-the Revolutionary 
Council celebrates the same founding anniversary as that of the 
'Arafat-led, PLO mainstream Fatah Movement]. However, it is 
worth noting that this statement did not mention Jordan at all. 
  This information seems bland when compared to the 
information leaked to AL-BILAD about the abortion of an 
operation to smuggle missiles from Lebanon to the group in 
Jordan in order to carry out two serious operations in the 
Jordanian arena. One of these operations was aimed at blowing 
up a very sensitive target in Amman while the other was aimed at 
assassinating an important Palestinian figure in Amman. The 
planned date for carrying out these two operations was not 
clear. However, the information indicated that the operations 
were to be carried out on a single day during an occasion 
described as an important Palestinian occasion. 
  In another development, elements of the Abu-Nidal group have 
leaked information that an agreement on clear constants has been 
reached with Jordan. The most prominent of these constants is 
that, as a group in Jordan, they are not responsible for any 
publication the group sends from outside Jordan and that they 
are not committed to presenting any information on this issue. 
Moreover, the group stopped issuing the their weekly 
publication, which is of limited distribution, due to emergency 
circumstances. 
  According to AL-BILAD's information, pressure was also 
brought to bear by delaying the arrival in the Jordanian market, 
or banning altogether, the magazine FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH, the 
mouthpiece of the group. 
  AL-BILAD's investigations also revealed another plot by the 
Abu-Nidal group in Jordan, aimed at opening relations with 
Fatah-'Arafat cadres that have connections inside the occupied 
Arab territories, especially in terms of military action. 
  As part of this, the Abu-Nidal group's activities focused on 
Fatah cadres that oppose Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's 
actions, that have reservations about the peace agreement with 
Israel, or that have military groups or political activities in 
the occupied territories. 
  Part of this plan was an unsuccessful attempt by head the of 
the group in Jordan ('A.Q.) [initials as published] at contacts 
with 'Abbas Zaki, member of Fatah Central Council. Zaki was 
visited by this man, who came out with the impression that he 
could not cooperate or coordinate with Zaki. 
  The bases for cooperation outlined by Abu-Nidal elements are 
formed on a concentration on issues inside the occupied 
territories, on building an armed structure, and on preparedness 
for financing and facilitating the purchase of weapons. 
  Our investigations also revealed another secret plot by the 
Abu-Nidal group aimed at pursuing the pro-'Arafat elements and 
obtaining the greatest amount of information on their lives. 
The implementation of this major plan began a few months ago 
with noticeable briskness. According to AL-BILAD information, 
the required information concentrated on the following: 
  1. Details about these people's houses and their addresses. 
Is it rented or personal property? What is the rent or how 
much does the house cost? 
  2. Their financial situation; their personal property, bank 
accounts, cars, real estate, ranches, shops. 
  3. Names of sons, daughters; their schools, behavior, 
friends, how much money they spend. From which supermarket the 
family shops. 
  4. Social relations; what level; restaurants frequented by 
the them. 
  5. Female relations: following up these relations and 
documenting them. 
  Arab security sources told AL-BILAD that the Abu-Nidal group 
elements had claimed that the group did not want to do any harm 
to the pro-'Arafat' men, in accordance with a gentleman's 
agreement with Jordan. They said that all this information had 
been collected for future consideration and that their dossiers 
would be reopened in occupied Palestine later when the 
opportunity arose so that the Palestinian people would know the 
bloodsuckers who wasted their resources. Then the people would 
sentence them to death and confiscate all their possessions. 
  Security reports available to us also reveal another plot 
being implemented in complete secrecy. It reveals in detail how 
the new Abu-Nidal elements used to be dispatched to Iran and 
returned back to Jordan. 
  The amazing details show that youths coming from the 
occupied 
territories carrying permits allowing them a long time for study 
or tourism in Russia were later sent to Azerbaijan. Form there 
they would go to Iran by land through channels well-known to 
Iranian authorities. Their passports would not be stamped at 
their entry to Iran. 
  Reports say that the new elements would be grouped and 
trained by special and advanced courses. They would then be 
returned to Jordan in the same way. Those residing in the 
occupied territories, would leave Jordan for these territories. 
Dozens of Arab and Palestinian students studying in Russia 
would be recruited and sent to Iran for training during their 
university holidays.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Congratulations to the Yemenis... </F>
Congratulations to King Husayn"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, when the Yemeni brothers signed the 
document of pledge and accord, the Arabs experienced one of the 
brightest moments in recent times, and Jordanians witnessed a 
historic and dear event not experienced for a long time. Under 
the patronage of the great Hashemite leader, the Yemenis have 
thus turned a page and opened a new and glorious chapter in 
Yemen's modern history. 
  The signing ceremony held at sunset on 10 Ramadan was a rare 
scene in this nation's life. This nation followed the 
proceedings, carried live, while dearly hoping that all Arab 
issues will be resolved through dialogue, reconciliation, and 
accord. The nation also hopes that this reconciliation will 
create a new Arab tradition for resolving problems and settling 
disputes. 
  The ceremony which ended the political crisis in fraternal 
Yemen has tangibly highlighted this nation's ability to overcome 
its difficulties and crises when there is solid will, good 
intentions, and sincere efforts aimed only at securing the 
nation's interest and effecting Arab unity in the face of all 
elements of estrangement and division. 
  Thus, we view what happened at King Husayn's house, the 
Arabs' great house, as a praiseworthy turning point not only in 
the course of a crisis that concerns the brothers in happy 
Yemen, but also in this nation's situation. This nation has 
discovered a successful mode of action which, together with 
sincere efforts, may ultimately end the numerous seditions. 
Such seditions can only be overcome through dialogue, openness, 
and reconciliation, similar to this wonderful Yemeni model. 
  Such a great historic Yemeni event provides an opportunity 
to 
warmly congratulate our brothers in Yemen on this great national 
achievement, and also to extend congratulations, coupled with 
appreciation, to His Majesty King Husayn, whose sincere efforts 
and high Arab and Islamic status have largely contributed to 
realizing this achievement. This Yemeni domestic event has 
turned into a great pan-Arab celebration that translates the 
Hashemite conscience's deep yearning for Arab unity and pride 
and for establishing a new modern pan-Arab entity.

  [Excerpt] His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan today 
visited the second Hashemite exhibition on the reconstruction of 
the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, an exhibition on 
the reconstruction of the mosques named after the prophet's 
companions, and an exhibition on the achievements of the 
Ministry of Awqaf, Islamic Affairs and Holy Places being held at 
the exhibition hall in the Martyr King 'Abdallah Mosque. The 
details follow: 
  His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan has expressed his 
happiness with the near completion of the second phase of the 
reconstruction of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, 
which demonstrates further interest in improving the Arab and 
Islamic image in Jerusalem. His highness said that the 
maintenance and reconstruction of the sacred Islamic places are 
aimed at supporting the Arab Islamic identity in the holy land 
because this is a sacred matter and an inevitable duty. 
  His highness said that the completion of the maintenance and 
reconstruction work for the Islamic places in Jerusalem will 
have moral significance, especially during these days of the 
blessed month of Ramadan because good work is rated above all 
other considerations. 
  Answering a question by the Saudi Press Agency correspondent 
in Amman on his highness' feelings regarding the initiative of 
the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, concerning the collection of popular 
donations from all Saudi regions for reconstructing and saving 
the Islamic shrines in Jerusalem, his highness said: The 
decision by the custodian of the two holy mosques to support the 
Islamic shrines in Jerusalem, which is the first of the two 
qiblahs [direction to which a Muslim turns during his prayers] 
and the third holiest shrine, is a good decision and a lofty 
tradition, especially when it comes during the blessed month of 
Ramadan. 
  His highness added: The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, led by 
His Majesty King Husayn, views this decision by Saudi Arabia 
with respect and appreciation because it contributes to 
supporting and strengthening the Arab nature of Jerusalem and 
protecting the Islamic shrines in it, a policy which 
Jordan--king, government, and people--has always sought to 
continue and promote through coordination and cooperation with 
all the Arab brothers. He asserted that this step by the Saudi 
brothers clearly contributes to realizing Arab solidarity. It 
is a continuation of the previous steps and stands of the 
custodian of the two holy mosques and the Saudi brothers toward 
the Islamic shrines in holy Jerusalem. 
  His highness said: Moreover, the Saudi steps can also be 
understood within the framework of promoting the Islamic appeal 
by His Majesty King Husayn concerning the religious authority 
[al-wilayah al-diniyah] in holy Jerusalem, an authority which 
recognizes only the moral sovereignty of God the Almighty, a 
sovereignty that takes into account the rights of the Muslims to 
express their historical and religious gains and to exercise 
their rights inside their city. He called on Arabs and Muslims 
to take the necessary measures to realize this religious 
authority and sovereignty over holy Jerusalem and the Islamic 
shrines. 
  His highness expressed his thanks and appreciation for the 
initiative of the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, in this blessed month and said: I can see 
that this initiative demonstrates an absolute interest by Saudi 
Arabia--king, government, and people--in the human contribution 
for the good of holy Jerusalem. [passage omitted] 
  [At 1800 GMT on 22 February Amman Jordan Television in 
Arabic 
carries a similar report that shows Crown Prince Hasan reading 
parts of the above statements from a prepared text.]

  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, happy 
Ramadan and welcome to the Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Al-Majali] Happy Ramadan to you and to all our Arab 
brothers, especially in fraternal Egypt. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Could you tell us what you discussed with 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe during his recent visit to 
Jordan? 
  [Al-Majali] The visit was very successful. It was meant for 
talks to promote bilateral relations, which have always been 
good in all areas, especially as far as France's economic 
support is concerned. France has always adopted a good and 
commendable position toward Jordan. We owe France a lot of 
money, and the minister promised that the French Government 
would reschedule this debt. 
  The French minister inquired about the progress in the peace 
process and about our expectations in this year. Our views were 
identical; we are both optimistic about the peace process, and 
we hope that in 1994 the peace moves will intensify and blossom, 
if not bear fruit. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Were there any new French proposals or views 
concerning the peace process? 
  [Al-Majali] There was nothing new, in fact. But they 
stressed that they support the peace process and expressed 
readiness to provide economic aid to the region. They are party 
to the multilateral talks, and many meetings have been held in 
Paris for this purpose. They also support the bilateral 
negotiations. They stressed their desire to play a bigger role. 
So far, France's role has been limited. We asked them, as an 
European country, to make further efforts to support the peace 
process. Relations between our countries and Europe are old and 
strong; we have links, and they have experience in this region. 
Undoubtedly, they can help in advancing the peace process. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] After His Majesty King Husayn's visit to 
Washington and Damascus, what are Jordan's next Arab and 
international moves? 
  [Al-Majali] Jordan always believes in common action and 
coordination with all Arab brothers. We believe that a 
comprehensive peace is [word indistinct] for all concerned 
parties. It is essential for the solution to be comprehensive, 
not partial. Much pressure has been put on Jordan to go it 
alone, but Jordan is firm, and does not agree to work 
individually. This position comes not from fanaticism or fear, 
but from belief that a general and comprehensive peace, not 
separate deals, is in the interest of all states of the region. 
Therefore, we always believe in coordination, especially with 
the United States, concerning bilateral and peace issues. I 
believe the United States clearly understood this. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Prime Minister, you have stated that 
you believe in inter-Arab coordination and collective Arab 
action. What about the reports that say Jordan has actually 
reached a peace agreement with Israel that only needs to be made 
public? 
  [Al-Majali] This is untrue, a rumor. Of course, we are 
hoping to reach an agreement but so far it has not happened. 
Apart from signing an agenda of the talks, nothing has 
occurred. However, some issues are being discussed in depth, 
including the reopening of Jordanian banks in the West Bank. 
This is finished and done with. No peace agreement, in the true 
sense of the word, has been reached, although some issues are 
clarified and accepted by both sides. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Prime Minister, one last question. According 
to some reports, foreign countries are trying to destabilize 
Jordan, to undermine its security. What is Jordan's position on 
these reports? How true are they? 
  [Al-Majali] We deeply regret the fact that there are some 
extremists who oppose the peace process. We believe in a 
constructive opposition but not an opposition that resorts to 
violence, assassinations, bombings, and the murder of innocent 
people. This is not opposition. These are acts that the Arab 
world is disgusted with and cannot accept, particularly as there 
is room for dialogue and discussion. Some people believe in 
violence but our people's steadfastness can effectively and 
manfully face whatever happens. We will not submit to any party 
that seeks to intimidate and terrorize us. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Prime Minister, we wish you a good Ramadan. 
Thank you very much. 
  [Al-Majali] A good Ramadan to you in Egypt and to the whole 
Arab and Islamic world. We thank the Voice of the Arabs.

  [Text] Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
(PLO) are seeking to coordinate their positions on negotiations 
with Israel on the fate of Palestinian refugees and displaced 
persons and then to bring in Egypt before actually opening 
quartiparite talks on the issue, officials said Friday [18 
February]. 
  The decision to hold prior coordination among the Arab sides 
to a four-party (Palestinian-Jordanian-Egyptian-Israeli) 
committee, which is proposed in the Sept. 13 autonomy agreement 
between Israel and the PLO, was taken during last week's 
Jordan-PLO meetings, the officials said. 
  A sub-committee on refugees and displaced persons met on the 
sidelines of meetings of the higher Jordan-PLO Joint Committee 
attended by Deputy Prime Minister Sa'id al-Tall and PLO foreign 
affairs chief Faruq Qaddumi. 
  Minister of State 'Adil Irshayd and PLO Executive Committee 
member Samir Ghawshah (Popular Struggle Front) chaired the 
sub-committee meetings, which submitted its recommendations to 
the higher committee, the official said. 
  The Jordanian stand during the meeting was that prior 
coordination was a must among the Arab parties concerned before 
launching the proposed four-party committee and this was 
accepted by the PLO side, they said. 
  Jordan has been refusing to entertain the idea of the 
four-party committee, which was sprung as a surprise to the 
Kingdom along with the secret autonomy accord negotiated by 
Israel and the PLO. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said: "We believe in 
the conceptual approach to the issue; coordination between 
ourselves (Jordan and the PLO) first and then with Egypt before 
proceeding further." 
  Dr. al-'Anani said no date had been set for the first 
meeting 
of the proposed four-party committee. Reports from Cairo and 
Tunis said it could take place in April. 
  But Dr. al-'Anani indicated that the meeting would not take 
place until Jordan is satisfied that the Kingdom, the PLO and 
Egypt have coordinated their positions and are able to present a 
common stand to present in this context. 
  The Jordan-PLO coordination is expected to be consolidated 
during a meeting next week of the joint sub-committee before the 
two sides approach Egypt, said Omar Khatib, the deputy chief of 
mission at the Palestinian embassy here. 
  "The decision of the sub-committee was clear. Any 
negotiations with Israel over the fate of Palestinian refugees 
and displaced persons should be based on related U.N. 
resolutions regardless of any other considerations," Mr. Khatib 
told the JORDAN TIMES. 
  U.N. Resolution 194 upholds the right of the Palestinian 
refugees of 1948 to return home or receive compensation. 
Resolutions issued since then uphold the same principle and 
call for an equitable solution to the problem of refugees. 
  Mr. Khatib said Jordan and the PLO were awaiting the outcome 
of the ongoing Israel-PLO negotiations in the Egyptian Red Sea 
resort of Taba before formulating further steps. He indicated 
that the Taba talks could produce a clear Israeli stand on how 
the Jewish state intended to handle the issue of displaced 
Palestinians. 
  "We have to have a very clear perception of our own 
positions 
and options before we sit down with Israel (in the four-party 
committee); that is what Jordan and the PLO are trying to 
acheive," said Mr. Khatib. 
  During last week's talks, Jordan agreed to conduct a census 
of displaced Palestinians living in the Kingdom for 
documentation purposes and eventually to find out how many of 
them would like to return to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  On Feb. 1, Egypt launched a similar survey of Palestinians 
from Gaza living in Arab countries after starting a census in 
its own teritory. It plans to close the enumeration on April 15. 
  Response to the Egyptian census in Jordan has been very 
slow, 
diplomatic sources said. 
  Palestinian "refugees" are classified as those who fled or 
were forced to flee their homes in Palestine when the state of 
Israel was created in 1948. Many of them ended up in refugee 
camps in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank only to be turned out 
again and forced across the Jordan River in the 1967 war. 
  They were joined by many natives of the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip in the flight; and these are classified as "displaced 
persons"-- meaning that they were displaced from their homes, 
not refugee camps, in the occupied territories. 
  According to PLO statistics, the number of Palestinians 
"displaced" from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip during the 
1967 war and their dependents now stands at 875,000. 
  "The majority of them are living in Jordan, and the rest are 
in Egypt," said Mr. Khatib. "Very few of them are in Syria or 
elswhere." 
  The Sep. 13 autonomy accord puts off any Israel-PLO 
discussion of the "refugees" until the "final status 
negotiations slated to be in in the third year of Palestinian 
self-rule in the occupied territories. 
  But the issue of refugees and displaced persons is a 
prominent item on the agenda signed on Sept. 14 for peace 
negotiations between Jordan and Israel, thus making the Kingdom 
the only Arab party dealing with the subject until the final 
status negotiations. 
  Jordanian officials say it was a significant achievement for 
Jordan that it managed to include the issue as a topic for 
bilateral negotiations. They say that Jordan's approach to the 
issue with Israel is on a state-to-state level with no prejudice 
of the right of the refugees to return home or receive 
compensation. 
  Jordan is demanding compensation for having hosted 
Palestinian refugees on its soil. It points out that the 
refugee problem was a result of the creation of the state of 
Israel and as such Israel has a direct responsibility to address 
its consequences. 
  Israel has ruled out the return of any massive number of 
Palestinians, but has agreed to consider allowing an unspecified 
but limited number to return, and both Jordnaian and PLO 
officials say they expect the issue to be one of the most thorny 
in negotiations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
Amirah Hasan; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Hasan] What role did Egypt, President Husni 
Mubarak, and Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa play to bring about the 
success of the agreement in Cairo? 
  [Rabin] President Mubarak and 'Amr Musa had an important and 
special role in bringing about the success of the Cairo 
agreement. They did not deny us the time or the effort. They 
were partners in the talks and presented proposals for the 
settlement. We accepted and adopted some of them. President 
Mubarak, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, the president's aides, and 
Egypt had an important role. I like to personally thank them 
and also to convey the Israeli Government's thanks. 
  [Hasan] What issues have remained outside of the Cairo 
agreement? 
  [Rabin] First, we reached agreement on many points in Cairo. 
I believe that this agreement represents a big step forward, 
especially with regard to the implementation of the first stage 
of the "Declaration of Principles" agreement, I mean the 
"Gaza-Jericho" agreement. We agreed in Cairo on all disputed 
issues, such as responsibility for external security, the 
crossing points, management of the crossing points, and the size 
and division of areas in the Gaza Strip. 
  As to Jericho, there is a map of the region. But 'Arafat has 
the right to raise the issue of Jericho's size in the meeting 
that will take place between me and him when we sum up all the 
contents of the agreement. 
  On the other hand, other issues remain pending, such as the 
problem of security for the Israelis and Palestinians on the 
major roads in Gaza. There are also other issues mentioned in 
the Declaration of Principles, such as joint projects and the 
Palestinians' own projects near the Dead Sea in an area that we 
will agree on. 
  As to religious issues, the Christian holy places in Jericho 
will be under Palestinian authority. Jewish ones will remain 
under Israeli authority. For the record, the Cairo agreement 
did not discuss at all the establishment of the Palestinian 
police, its size, or its mode of operation in Gaza together with 
the Israeli police. For example, if an agreement is concluded, 
there will be joint action between us and the Palestinian police 
even on the major roads that will be built for the Israeli 
settlements from Gush Qativ to Lintserim in the Gaza Strip. 
There are also talks about the establishment of the first 
centers for coordination between the Palestinian forces and the 
Israeli forces, which will take care of security matters, the 
formation of the Palestinian police and its size, and setting up 
observation posts for ships and fishing. We are not against the 
Palestinians having a number of ships for guard duty in the sea. 
All the above issues have not been discussed yet and no 
agreement has been reached on them so far. 
  As to civilian affairs, Gadi Zohar on the Israeli side and 
Jamil al-Tarifi on the Palestinian side met in Taba to discuss 
issues related to the transfer of authority from the Israeli 
civil administration. This will start with electricity, 
particularly as electricity in the Gaza Strip comes from Israel. 
Water and communications issues were also discussed. 
  [Hasan] Are you interested in having economic relations 
with the Palestinians? 
  [Rabin] My interest is focused on setting up a free economic 
body between the two sides. Naturally, we must take into 
consideration some of their reservations and some of our 
reservations as well. However, this body must be one economic 
entity before the world. 
  The Palestinian side wants its economic relations to be 
linked more to the Arab countries. On our part, we have our own 
views, such as supervising the Palestinian work in Israel. 
There are issues that have not yet been agreed on, such as that 
of currency. This is one of the demands submitted by the 
countries that will be giving aid. It is not our demand. 
  In the past, the Arab countries gave financial aid to the 
PLO. But today, the countries that will finance projects in the 
area need to know about those projects. They also need to know 
the various channels of the projects and to make sure that the 
funds reach their targets. 
  The Palestinian authority must define the means through 
which 
the funds should arrive, such as the development bank. For 
example, we get U.S. aid and we must present all receipts 
showing how the funds were used because these countries need to 
know for which projects the funds have been used. Israel will 
not interfere in such matters between the Palestinians and the 
countries contributing to the projects in the area. 
  [Hasan] Have the government of Israel and you personally 
delineated the area of Jericho? 
  [Rabin] We signed a map today. With my consent, Shim'on 
Peres sent a message to 'Arafat in which he said that the issue 
of Jericho's area and 'Arafat's request to expand that area will 
be discussed after summarizing the agreement's provisions. Our 
stance is clear with regard to the map, but it is possible to 
discuss ways of enlarging Jericho's area. 
  However, we are not currently discussing this issue. It will 
be postponed until a meeting is held between myself and 'Arafat 
before signing the agreement's provisions. During the Cairo 
meeting, we agreed on many points, including the implementation 
of the Gaza-Jericho accord. 
  [Hasan] Increasing the area of Jericho would make it easy 
for 
many Palestinians in the occupied territories, who view the 
Cairo agreement as Palestinian concessions to Israeli security 
demands, such as the Palestinian People's Party, which first 
supported the Declaration of Principles but later joined the 
opposition. 
  [Rabin] Even in Israel there is dissatisfaction over the 
Cairo agreement. This is natural. There will always be people 
who oppose any agreement containing a settlement. There was 
indeed a settlement. When I present this settlement to the 
[Knesset's] Foreign Affairs Committee, it will be criticized by 
some members. 
  [Hasan] Will the Israeli Army withdraw by April, or is even 
that date not sacred to you? 
  [Rabin] I do not want to procrastinate in the talks for one 
day, but at the same time I do not want an agreement that ends 
in failure. We have to remember that concluding an agreement 
with an Arab state will always raise an argument about the 
nature of peace. And after agreeing on this point, we will have 
to work out an agreement about the borders because there can be 
no agreement without border demarcation. Then come the security 
arrangements and the normalization of relations. After an 
agreement is concluded, it then becomes the responsibility of 
all parties concerned, Arab and Israeli, to preserve this 
agreement, as was the case with Egypt. 
  But with regard to the agreement with the Palestinians, 
which 
involves stages--the transitional period, the first stage of the 
Declaration of Principles, and then the overall 
agreement--things are more complicated. This is because we are 
trying to achieve peaceful coexistence between two entities: a 
Palestinian entity and the Israeli entity in the territories. 
We must remember that the Israelis are spread all over the 
territories and lead a daily life alongside the Palestinians. 
There are tens of thousands of Palestinian and Israeli cars 
that face each others everyday. If we do not create a clear-cut 
understanding from the beginning, it will be difficult to 
control this situation, which could doom the agreement from the 
start. But if we want to prove that it is possible for us to 
live side by side in peace under this agreement, despite all the 
difficulties and opposition from the Palestinian and Israeli 
sides, we must reach a clear-cut and accurate definition of all 
details. Otherwise, the situation may explode at any time over 
any small problem. For instance, if there is a road accident 
involving a Palestinian car and an Israeli car, how should we 
handle the matter and in which court? We have to find solutions 
for all such small problems right from the start, or else we 
will regret it and the agreement will fail. I emphasize my 
desire to make the agreement work. It is better to delay its 
implementation for one month until the positions for us and for 
the Palestinians are clear and agreed on, particularly regarding 
the matters that may cause things to explode. The real 
discussion is not between myself and 'Arafat, and not even among 
the senior officials, but between the Palestinian and Israeli 
citizens in their daily lives. 
  [Hasan] Are you confident that Yasir 'Arafat will be able to 
control things in the occupied territories? 
  [Rabin] We basically presume that the Palestinians will have 
to do their jobs and play their role. We also believe that 
'Arafat can control things. I will not appear to be helping him 
in these things. We expect 'Arafat to live up to this 
responsibility with the help of the Palestinian police. There 
also will be some joint cooperation between us on some issues. 
'Arafat is a full partner and he must play his role as we play 
ours. With our cooperation, we will be successful. 
  [Hasan] How do you want the Palestinian police to be 
structured? 
  [Rabin] This issue is still under discussion in the Taba 
negotiations. I have just received the first working paper. 
But I want calm negotiations between the two sides without the 
media. Making statements to the media and being criticized will 
impede the negotiations. Therefore, I will not go into details 
with you about the size and number of the Palestinian police. 
But I can say that the atmosphere that prevailed during the 
negotiations was positive. The negotiators discussed all aspects 
of the Palestinian police establishment with regard to its size, 
number, authority, the stages of its deployment, and the 
buildings that will be handed over so that it can organize 
itself and assume its responsibilities. 
  [Hasan] What kind of cooperation will there be between you 
and the Palestinian police? 
  [Rabin] First, each side will do its duty. For example, 
there are a quarter of a million Palestinians in Gaza city who 
have to respect law and order in the interest of the 
Palestinians and prevent terrorist actions. On our part, we 
will prevent the Israelis from taking any illegal actions. We 
will give the Palestinian police all the areas where there are 
Palestinians and all the refugee camps. 
  Regarding responsibility for international borders between 
Egypt and the Gaza Strip in the Rafah area, we have delineated 
these borders in such a way as to have the minimum level of 
Palestinian population centers. The Palestinians there will be 
in charge. 
  [Hasan] Are all the Israeli security demands included in the 
Cairo agreement? 
  [Rabin] The most important thing is that we reached an 
agreement. We want to make progress in implementing the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  [Hasan] The situation in the occupied territories is 
deteriorating. There are daily killings and repression at the 
hands of the army and the reaction of those opposed to the 
agreement increases when Israelis are killed. Why, then, the 
delay in implementing the agreement? 
  [Rabin] Let us first clarify who is carrying out these 
operations. They are the Palestinians opposed to the agreement, 
such as Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], Islamic Jihad, some 
of the opposition Palestinian elements, and some of the Fatah 
Hawks who refuse to obey the orders coming from Tunis. They 
will continue their operations because they are opposed to the 
agreement. Therefore, we should take care to make the agreement 
clearer. If we do not clarify matters further, the operations 
will continue without control and the situation will blow up one 
day. Don't believe that Israel is not subjected to danger; it 
is subjected to danger just like the PLO until calm prevails. I 
am not asking the PLO to shoulder the responsibility for actions 
carried out by the opposition elements in the area. But when 
the PLO assumes responsibility in an organized way, then I will 
ask it to shoulder full responsibility as it says in the 
agreement. 
  [Hasan] Regarding Fatah's Hawks, the reason they joined 
Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad is the army's repression against them, 
especially after some of them had surrendered their weapons to 
the army. But the army continued to chase and even assassinate 
them. 
  [Rabin] I don't want to go into the details. They, too, are 
being pursued more by Palestinians than by Israelis. This is an 
internal struggle. I believe that the current stage will see 
several struggles in the area. Israel remains responsible for 
dealing with this situation until the Palestinian police 
officers are deployed. Then it will become responsible for 
maintaining law and stability in Gaza. 
  [Hasan] Will the army continue to pursue the wanted 
Palestinians? 
  [Rabin] There are some wanted people who stopped their 
activity after 13 September 1993. Scores of them have returned 
to their homes. Unfortunately, Abu-Rish, a wanted Palestinian, 
was killed by mistake but the rest are unharmed. I am sorry for 
what happened to Abu-Rish. Those who continued the acts of 
violence after 13 September will be treated in the same way as 
those who oppose the agreement and who practice terrorism. 
  [Hasan] Are you and your government concerned about opening 
the door to dialogue with Hamas and if so on what conditions? 
  [Rabin] I am prepared to hold a dialogue with any party that 
is ready to join and back the agreement on the Declaration of 
Principles and that abstains from undertaking terrorist 
operations. 
  [Hasan] Are you trying put out feelers to Hamas? 
  [Rabin] There are no attempts to put out feelers, because 
Hamas' positions are known and categorical. Not even the PLO 
has succeeded in holding talks with Hamas. 
  [Hasan] Could the release of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin help turn 
over a new leaf with Hamas and make things easier for the PLO? 
  [Rabin] I don't think so. But if Shaykh Ahmad Yasin changes 
his positions, supports the agreement, and calls for a halt to 
terrorism, the issue could be discussed. Shaykh Yasin's 
position is the opposite of this. 
  [Hasan] Will all the Palestinian detainees be released, 
especially now that we are in the month of Ramadan and since 
this issue is of interest to every Palestinian? 
  [Rabin] I repeat: The release of all or some of the 
detainees is part of the negotiations to implement the agreement 
on the Declaration of Principles. Some of them have committed 
murder. I do not want to get into details now. 
  [Hasan] Do you link their release with progress in the 
talks? 
  [Rabin] Yes of course. 
  [Hasan] Your position has changed in this regard. Why? 
  [Rabin] It has always been my personal position to link the 
release of detainees with progress in the talks and with another 
demand we want the Palestinians to meet, that is, providing 
information on the Israeli soldiers who went missing in the 
Sultan Ya'qub battles of July 1982. 
  [Hasan] Are you first awaiting an answer regarding the 
Israeli soldiers? 
  [Rabin] The release of detainees depends on the issue of the 
missing soldiers. What we are being asked to do is to release 
detainees who were locked up 10 years ago. If we are discussing 
events of 10 years ago, then it's mutual. 
  [Hasan] How many Palestinian detainees are in Israeli jails? 
  [Rabin] Approximately 9,000. Every month, some of them are 
released while some others are detained. 
  [Hasan] Will their release make 'Arafat's job and that of 
the 
supporters of the peace process in the territories easier? 
  [Rabin] It might make things easier but at the same time it 
would step up the terrorism undertaken today by Palestinians. I 
do not encourage terrorism. I will release no one who has been 
involved in terrorism because he will go back and do it again. 
Some Hamas people who returned from the Marj al-Zuhur area [in 
south Lebanon] have been detained again. 
  [Hasan] The deportation and then repatriation of 415 Hamas 
members enhanced their position. Were you wrong to deport them 
and has the age of deportation ended? 
  [Rabin] I think Hamas was on a path toward enhancing its 
position over the past two years. Today they carry the 
opposition banner, even though they are not the only ones 
opposed to the agreement. The deportation constituted a blow 
that weakened them. But there will always be new cells. If we 
fail to reach an agreement and the PLO and the Palestinian 
police do not get to the territories, things won't be clear. I 
believe in our partner's ability to preserve law and order in 
the areas that will fall under its control. 
  [Hasan] Will you repeat the closure of the occupied 
Palestinian territories, particularly Gaza? 
  [Rabin] I support enforcing the closure despite the presence 
of 50,000 Palestinian workers, 20,000 from Gaza, who work in 
Israel. This number does not include businessmen and doctors. I 
believe the economy will deteriorate if Gaza is closed. But if 
operations persist inside Israel, I will reconsider the issue. 
I do not want to have to close the Gaza Strip. But if 
terrorism directed at Israelis continues, I regret to say that 
my primary responsibility is to protect Israel's security. 
  [Hasan] Why do you link the issue of the Palestinian agents 
with the release of Palestinian detainees and prisoners? 
  [Rabin] Of course I link the two things because those who 
cooperated with us are entitled to the same privileges that will 
be granted to those who tried to harm Israel. 
  [Hasan] It is the custom to try those people who cooperate 
with the occupation against their own people. Why should the 
fate of an agent be linked with that of a struggler who fought 
the occupation? 
  [Rabin] People who conducted terrorist operations were tried 
everywhere. 
  [Hasan] Are you talking about agents who betrayed their 
people and cooperated with the occupier? 
  [Rabin] They did not betray their people. An agent is a 
person who opposes terrorism. 
  [Hasan] Is Israel willing to absorb these agents? 
  [Rabin] We are willing to take whoever wishes it. 
  [Hasan] You recognized the existence of a Palestinian 
entity, 
a Palestinian flag, and a Palestinian anthem. Why then do you 
object to the establishment of a state? 
  [Rabin] The others are no symbol of sovereignty. There are 
many such entities around the world but none of them is a state. 
There are far more Kurds than Palestinians. Are Iraq and Turkey 
willing to recognize them as a state? Our target today is to 
implement what we agreed upon at the Madrid peace conference 
during the first transitional period. A timetable took shape in 
the Declaration of Principles prepared in Oslo and signed in 
Washington. This timetable applies to a period no later than two 
years from the implementation of the comprehensive 
agreement--Gaza-Jericho First. Then we will begin negotiations 
on the final solution. 
  [Hasan] Can the duration of the self-rule and the 
transitional period be shortened if peace and order prevail in 
the region? And will you abstain from objecting to the 
establishment of a Palestinian state in that case? 
  [Rabin] Right now I adhere to the Labor Party positions, 
which oppose the establishment of an independent Palestinian 
state. 
  We maintain this stance. But we did not object to the 
integration of the Palestinian entity with Jordan. 
  [Hasan] Do you support a Palestinian-Israeli confederation? 
  [Rabin] I support all proposals for Israeli-Palestinian 
cooperation. When we reach an agreement and succeed, many 
possibilities not proposed today will be available. 
  [Hasan] The main issues for negotiation, such as the [1948] 
refugees, Jerusalem, the settlements, the 1967 refugees, and 
water, have not yet been practically discussed. How will these 
problems be solved? 
  [Rabin] Why should I discuss special scenarios when we 
already have one that is agreed upon? I am against the 
Palestinians' right to repatriation. I want to tell you that 
you are posing questions that I prefer are not posed. My 
position is clear: Why should we discuss subjects we agreed 
with the PLO not to discuss now? We are not trying today to 
solve problems that have existed for 100 years. Let us begin 
with the transitional period, which has never before been 
offered to the Palestinians. Israel gave the Palestinians this 
solution, which is only interim, not final. We are not against 
the Palestinians proposing the shape of the final solution but 
we tell them to begin with the first step, a chance they have 
never been offered before. Why, when between 1949 and 1967 the 
West Bank was under the control of Jordan and Gaza under Egypt, 
wasn't a Palestinian state established? The West Bank, Gaza, 
and east Jerusalem were under Arab rule. Did Israel prevent the 
establishment of a Palestinian state then? As for Jerusalem, it 
must remain united and under Israeli sovereignty. 
  [Hasan] Were you wrong to start building settlements in 
1967? 
  [Rabin] There are settlements. We as a Labor Party opposed 
their establishment, while others supported it. This is a fact. 
The agreement with the PLO deals with the interim period, during 
which all the settlements will remain. 
  [Hasan] Why have you not met President al-Asad? 
  [Rabin] That's not up to me. President al-Asad opposes not 
only such a meeting, but also contacts between the foreign 
ministers. Syria prevents direct contacts between us. Syria is 
making a grave mistake. I do not expect President al-Asad to do 
what President al-Sadat did and visit Jerusalem but it is 
difficult to convince the Israeli people that Syria is 
interested in peace when, at the same time, it is not prepared 
for high-level meetings. Syria is making no confidence-building 
statements. For example, Knesset member 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
Darawshah sought permission to travel to Syria along with a 
small delegation of Israeli Arabs to extend condolences to 
President al-Asad on his son's death but the request was turned 
down. This is not a confidence-building step. The Syrian 
Government and President al-Asad showed no readiness for peace. 
  [Hasan] Will you approve the return of poet Mahmud Darwish 
and 'Arafat's adviser 'Ammar Shattur to Israel? 
  [Rabin] I have received no official request in this regard; 
I 
know nothing about this. When I receive a request, I will 
discuss it. 
  [Hasan] Have Israel's relations with the Arab world improved 
since the Oslo agreement? 
  [Rabin] No doubt there is a new atmosphere and there are 
meetings. I believe that in the next few months the 
multilateral working groups will meet in Oman, Qatar, and 
Tunisia. Who would have thought before the signing of the 
Declaration of Principles with the PLO on 13 September 1993 that 
we would go to those countries and meet representatives of Arab 
states that have no relations with Israel to discuss building a 
regional peace? I think this is an important change and there 
is a general change in the Arab world. 
  [Hasan] Will your government bring about a just and 
comprehensive peace with the Arab world? 
  [Rabin] This is our objective. Within the framework of the 
Madrid conference, we called for a comprehensive peace with 
Israel's neighbors in addition to Egypt and the Palestinians. I 
believe that if progress is achieved with Syria, which is 
changing its way and method for peace [as published], that will 
boost the peace with Arab countries that have no border with 
Israel, such as Tunisia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, 
and Lebanon [as published]. But it is hard to imagine that 
Libya and Iraq will accept such a step.

  [Excerpt] The Israeli and PLO delegations met in Cairo 
this morning for another discussion of the security issues. The 
talks focused on the size of the Palestinian police. Later 
today, the committee dealing with the transfer of the civilian 
powers will hold its session. 
  After meeting the foreign minister of Malta, Foreign 
Minister 
Shim'on Peres said this morning that the Israeli-PLO talks in 
Cairo are making satisfactory progress. He refused to say 
whether the issue of collaborators is being discussed. Our 
political correspondent Udi Segal reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Segal] The next Arab League convention, 
which will be held in Cairo in March, will discuss an offer 
which will probably bring the Arab boycott against Israel near 
its end. According to the offer, each Arab country will be able 
to decide whether to end or continue the boycott on its own. 
  Political sources in Jerusalem believe that if such a 
resolution is made, it would be followed by the cancellation of 
the boycott by several important Arab countries such as, among 
others, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Tunisia, and Morocco. 
  At the same time next month, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will arrive on a Middle East shuttle mission seeking 
to attain a breakthrough on the Syrian track. Foreign Minister 
Peres this morning addressed himself to the issue of U.S. 
involvement in the political process: 
  [Peres] The U.S. involvement is not the same on all three 
tracks. The negotiations with the Palestinians today are, in 
the main part, held directly between the two sides. 
Negotiations with Jordan take place in Washington, and I would 
like to see a faster pace there. As for Syria, for all intents 
and purposes, the negotiations are at the very initial stages. 
We would like to see a breakthrough there. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Mikha Friedman -- live] 
  [Text] [Friedman] Good morning, sir. We need your 
assistance in finding our way in the maze of contradicting 
pieces of information. We hear there was a serious setback in 
Paris, where the Palestinians reneged on several earlier 
understandings. At the same time, very good progress was 
reportedly made in Cairo, and Qol Yisra'el even announced that 5 
May has been set as the date for the beginning of the withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho and that Yasir 'Arafat has been notified 
of it and has accepted the date. Where do things really stand? 
  [Peres] Look, first, Yasir 'Arafat has not been notified of 
any date; neither has a date been set. Therefore, although that 
report is full of goodwill, it is inaccurate. The real 
information is that progress was made in Taba. Important 
progress was made last week. Additional progress was made 
yesterday. If indeed this pace is kept up, there is a good 
chance that an agreement will be reached in the negotiations 
within a few weeks, and it could be implemented in a short time. 
We cannot yet provide a specific date because there are always 
surprises during negotiations. 
  [Friedman] You have recently said that there are no sacred 
dates but only sacred time frames, allowing us to understand 
that the four-month span between the day the agreement with the 
PLO is signed and the beginning of the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] withdrawal will be observed in any event. Do you still 
insist on those four months? 
  [Peres] I said four months after the agreement is signed. 
It has not been signed yet. At the same time, I believe that 
if it is signed -- and I believe it will be in a few weeks -- we 
will not need four months; we may require only four weeks or 
even less. That is, I do not know whether it will take place in 
April; it could take another month, if everything works well. 
Still, the time span was properly set. 
  As for the Paris talks, one must realize that negotiations 
include many surprises, tricks, changes of position, and 
setbacks. There is no need to get overly excited about this. We 
have experienced this in other negotiations. In general, 
however, I believe that the PLO today is more pragmatic and 
that, like us, it wants to end the negotiations as soon as 
possible. I do not underestimate the many details that have to 
be dealt with, but in general, very satisfactory progress has 
been made. 
  [Friedman] It seems, however, that the PLO is trying to get 
in Paris what it failed to attain in the Cairo and Davos talks 
in which you participated: symbols of sovereignty, such as 
their own currency and customs, which is the source of the 
crisis in Paris. 
  [Peres] I believe this is a mistake. The time of 
nationalist economics is over. Economy today is based on free 
markets not national markings, because you cannot feed children 
flags for breakfast. This is a bit old-fashioned. Everyone is 
making efforts today to have economy influence politics and not 
the other way around. We do not want to cater to the leaders' 
egos but to the people's needs. 
  [Friedman] Finance Minister Shohat said, however, that if 
the Paris talks fail, we will opt for nationalist economies and 
separate the economies of the territories and Israel. 
  [Peres] Look, the Palestinians will suffer from this, not 
us. Things must be kept in proportion. Israel's national income 
is $70 billion; the national income in the territories is $2-3 
billion. The territories need Israeli jobs and markets. For 
example, where will they export their farming produce? You know 
that 50,000 Palestinians working in Israel make a very large 
income. I know that there are two schools of thought in the 
PLO: the national and the economic. That is, some of the PLO 
officials still believe that nationalism is more important than 
the market, but many of them are university graduates who are 
familiar with the modern world. They are aware of what would 
benefit both the Palestinians and Israel. 
  I suggest that we do not present this issue as something 
Israel needs. The territories need a free economy, 
possibilities of finding work and selling goods, and a stable 
currency more than we do. Our economy is based on three or four 
agreements: the free trade agreement with the United States; 
associate membership in the EEC; and a free trade agreement with 
EFTA [European Free Trade Association]. Furthermore, we have 
bilateral agreements with the whole world. Israel exported 
$4.5-billion worth of high-tech, sophisticated electronic goods 
to the United States last year. We always present this as if 
someone is doing us a favor. We need no such favors, and no one 
is doing us any. We want the economic situation of the 
territories to be good. 
  [Friedman] Mr. Peres, I would like you to comment about 
today's top story on the front page of DAVAR, which says that 
Israel planned to free 1,000 Palestinian prisoners as a holiday 
gesture and to mark the progress in the Cairo talks, but changed 
its mind in the wake of the killing of Tzipora Sason and the 
unrest in the territories. 
  [Peres] There is no doubt that the killings significantly 
affect national morale. The report itself, I believe, is not 
accurate. We must wait and see about the date and scope of the 
prisoner release.

  [Text] As the peace talks continue in several locations 
around the world, there is word here in Jerusalem that the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will be 
completed by the third week of May. Senior sources in Jerusalem 
gave this estimate to Qol Yisra'el correspondent Hayim Hecht. 
These sources say the May date has already been transmitted to 
Yasir 'Arafat. 
  On Jordan, the sources said, the talks in Washington are 
concentrating on preparing a full and detailed peace. 
  As far as the Palestinian police force is concerned, Israel 
is said to have agreed that it would be 8,500-strong, a 
compromise between the positions of both sides. According to 
the sources, once the agreement is actually signed, Israel will 
release more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. 
  [A report by On Levi on page 1 of Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew 
on 
23 February adds that "the IDF had planned to free about 1,000 
Palestinian detainees on Sunday, 20 February, but canceled the 
move in the wake of the murder of Tzipora Sason near Ari'el on 
Friday night."] 
  Speaking earlier in Madrid, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
said 
that when an agreement on Palestinian self-rule is signed 
between Israel and the Palestinians, the IDF withdrawal can be 
implemented within a few weeks. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] Since I do not know when we will 
reach the agreement, I can't give you any speculation about 
dates. But allow me to say: We would like that the 
implementation of the agreement will be done in a matter of a 
few weeks and not to be prolonged too long. [end recording] 
  The prime minister made the comment at a joint news 
conference yesterday in Madrid with his Spanish counterpart, 
Felipe Gonzalez. Rabin, on the third day of his four-day visit, 
arrives today in Portugal. 
  The head of Fatah in the West Bank, Faysal al-Husayni, says 
agreement will be reached with Israel on implementing the 
Gaza-Jericho-First accord by the April 13th deadline. 
Al-Husayni made the statement after meeting with the foreign 
minister of Malta, Guido de Marco. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 23 February 
adds that "Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Cairo reported 
that progress was made in yesterday's talks. Chief PLO delegate 
Nabil Sha'th said that it is possible that Prime Minister Rabin 
and PLO leader 'Arafat will be able to meet by the end of next 
week."]

  [Excerpts] London, Damascus -- 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, 
Arab deputy in the Israeli Knesset and representative of the 
Arab Democratic Party, has stressed that a visit to Syria by a 
delegation headed by him is imminent. And that the aim is to 
condole Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad for the death of his son, 
Staff Major Basil al-Asad, who was tragically killed in an 
accident last month. He said that "contacts are under way to 
set a date for the visit and the place from which we are going 
to cross to Syria." 
  Darawshah told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from his 
office in al-Nasirah that the visit is expected to take place 
within the next few days. And that he prefers to cross into 
Syrian territory via the Golan Heights so that there would be no 
need to use passports. He expressed his confidence that "Syria 
will offer all capabilities to make this visit a success." 
[passage omitted] 
  Syrian sources have not confirmed whether the delegation is 
going to discuss matters concerning the peace process. However, 
they said that it may propose some views vis-a-vis peace. 
  As for Darawshah, he stressed that the visit is limited to 
offering condolences to President al-Asad, his family, and the 
Syrian people for Basil's death." [no opening quotemarks as 
published] He added: "We are not entrusted with any official 
tasks or with conveying any messages." He went on: "Raising 
any political issues depends on the host, who is the one to 
decide the meeting's program and contents." [passage omitted] 
  On the makeup of the delegation, which will comprise 30 
figures, Darawshah said that it will represent all Palestinian 
geographical, religious, literary, educational, political, and 
national sectors and groups in Israel." [no opening quotemarks 
as published] According to Darawshah, the delegation will 
include Knesset members 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah and Talab 
al-Sani'. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Mute Dialogue With Syria"] </F>
  [Text] The Palestinian organization of The Battalion of 13 
Black September fired a katyusha at the Western Galilee on 16 
February to demonstrate its opposition to the Oslo and 
Washington agreements. The prime minister described it as a 
"marginal" organization; the commander of the Northern Command 
said it was an "isolated" katyusha. 
  General Yitzhaq Mordekhay did not promise that such shooting 
will not be repeated, and the fact that it is marginal does not 
make the organization less threatening. The two reactions, 
however, indicated there is an Israeli desire to distinguish 
between Hizballah and other terror organizations. Rabin 
determined that the understandings between Israel and Syria 
which followed Operation Accountability remained intact even 
after this shooting: "Our understandings, which referred to 
Hizballah activity, are being observed." As for the Palestinian 
battalion, "the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will find ways of 
dealing with it." 
  The prime minister, therefore, rejected the opposition's 
demands and refused to charge the Syrians with responsibility 
for the katyusha which fell in Israeli territory. It could be 
detected from the prime minister's restrained reaction to the 
Hizballah ambush which left us with four fatalities that Rabin 
is making an effort not to disturb the atmosphere in which the 
bilateral talks are being held in Washington. In fact, he no 
longer holds Damascus responsible for terror acts in which 
Hizballah is not involved, and gives Syria credit for keeping 
the agreement which was made at the end of July 1993 with U.S. 
mediation. 
  It could be assumed that Hafiz al-Asad understands Rabin's 
intentions. His willingness to accept a delegation of 
condolences of Israeli Arabs -- Muslims, Christians, and Druze 
-- can be viewed as a gesture to Israel. The fact that the 
agreement came in the wake of U.S. and Egyptian encouragement 
does not diminish its importance: It can be viewed as answering 
a wish Rabin expressed some two weeks ago: that Syria take 
confidence building measures between the two countries. If the 
Prime Minister's Office did say that the Syrian approval of the 
delegation's visit could be considered "an important signal from 
the Syrian president," it could become apparent that a sort of 
mute dialogue is taking place between Rabin and al-Asad. 
  There may be some in Israel who will regard the affair of 
the 
delegation as a Syrian trick: al-Asad attempting to set up a 
pro- Syrian lobby in Israel. This idea should not be 
disregarded, but -- even if we assume this suspicious attitude 
has grounds -- did we not always say that the Israeli Arab 
citizens could serve as a "bridge" between the Jewish state, the 
neighboring Arab countries, and the entire Arab world? 
  There is no need to overdramatize the delegation's trip. 
Knesset Member Darawshah will not be authorized to hold 
negotiations with the Syrian president who on his part, through 
the media subordinate to him, will stress that the visit is only 
held to allow the visitors to perform the rite of extending 
condolences -- nothing more. Nevertheless, it is significant 
that the Syrian president will receive the condolences of 
Israel's Arabs in a manner similar to that which Jordan's King 
Husayn has been maintaining for years. 
  The "ongoing" talks in Washington -- and the Americans have 
not yet started talking about the 13th round of talks -- are 
still stuck; the Syrian delegate keeps making peace conditional 
on Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. This, 
however, is no reason to stop talking to him. As long as Syria 
is interested in holding the negotiations, Israel should keep 
them up as well.

<F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>
  [Excerpts] Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu's supporters 
enjoy a majority in the new Likud Secretariat, which was elected 
last Thursday [17 February]. Several central activists from the 
David Levi camp did not manage to get voted into the 
secretariat. Ya'aqov Berdugo, secretary general of the Union of 
Local Authorities in Israel, is one of those who failed to get 
elected. A series of municipal heads identified with the Levi 
camp were also voted out. [passage omitted] 
  A somewhat surprising fact is that eight persons newly 
elected to the secretariat are identified with Moshe Qatzav's 
camp. Altogether 29 secretariat seats were available. The 
other 32 slots were reserved for the Likud's Knesset members 
[MK's]. MK Netanyahu is not a member of the secretariat because 
one of its duties is to monitor and supervise his work. 
[passage omitted] 
  Netanyahu's associates expressed satisfaction with the 
results of the elections to the secretariat. They stated that 
those who declared they intend to "give Netanyahu a hard time" 
were not elected, while all of those elected who are not members 
of the Netanyahu camp are "suitable" candidates. 
  Levi camp members, on the other hand, claim it is misleading 
to depict the results as a defeat for the Levi camp. According 
to Levi's associates, this confrontation was not conducted on a 
partisan basis and the Levi camp did not promote any candidates.

<F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>
  [Excerpts] Approximately 30,000 people have registered 
themselves in the framework of the special National Religious 
Party [NRP] registration campaign, which started on 15 November 
1993 and has just ended. NRP officials were surprised by the 
larger than expected turnout. According to NRP estimates, the 
number of registrants was expected to be far lower due to the 
campaign's low public profile. 
  NRP officials expressed the assessment that the relatively 
high turnout, which includes many new names, may lead to serious 
changes in the composition of the delegates to the NRP 
convention and in the party's list of candidates to the Knesset. 
The census was carried out prior to the internal elections for 
the party's convention and for the councils of the various 
branches, which will be held on 26 April 1994. [passage omitted] 
  The last NRP census was conducted seven years ago. That was 
also the last time the party held internal elections. 
  Since then, the NRP has twice postponed the census with the 
approval of the movement's tribunal. Once, because the date of 
national elections was brought forward, and a second time due to 
the local council elections. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The NRP [National Religious Party] has demanded 
that the government apply Israeli sovereignty to the Jordan Rift 
Valley settlements and declare them a security zone outside all 
political arrangements. This NRP demand was presented during a 
tour of the valley today. According to them, Palestinians are 
establishing settlements in the valley so as to endanger the 
Jewish majority there. Our territories correspondent Amir Hay 
reports: 
  The amazing revelation made by NRP leaders in the course of 
their tour of the Jordan Rift Valley was that Arab settlements 
are being established without permits. About 500 people have 
recently settled down in improvised structures in the al-Jiftliq 
area, and several hundred other families squatted in the area, 
in the words of the Jewish residents, establishing three more 
such centers. They arrived mostly from the Tubas and Janin 
areas. [passage omitted] 
  In less than three days, the Arab residents managed to set 
up 
an improvised mosque on the site. Jordan Valley residents claim 
that a 20-percent rise in unauthorized Arab settlement has been 
registered since the PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles was 
signed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by security affairs correspondent Sharon Sade] </F>
  [Text] Militerm Technologies, an Israeli firm representing 
the Russian firm Sub-Inform-Sputnik, received from the latter 
air photographs taken by Russian satellites. There are no 
restrictions on the photographs which were obtained for a 
relatively low price. The up-to-date and high-resolution 
photographs were taken by intelligence satellites used by 
Russia, mainly for military purposes. 
  To promote sales, Militerm Technologies received from the 
Russians photographs of targets in Arab countries such as Iran, 
Iraq, Kuwait, etc. As far as is known, the Russian firm also 
owns similar photographs of locations in Israel and is in 
contact with Arab elements. 
  The Russian firm sells photographs taken by two types of 
satellites outfitted with high-resolution analog cameras: one 
satellite has a TK-350 topographic camera with a resolution of 
10 meters and a maximum range of 200 x 300 km. The second 
satellite is equipped with a precision KVR-1000 camera which 
takes photographs with a resolution of only 2 meters and has a 
range of 40 x 40 km. 
  The price tag for a photograph ranges from $1,250 for a 
printed photograph to $10,000 for a negative of a higher quality 
three- dimensional air photograph. Enclosed with the 
photographs are full information about the date the photograph 
was taken and the cloud cover over the area at the time. 
  It should be noted that the KVR-1000 satellite can take 
target photographs with a resolution of 25 centimeters, which is 
the precision required by military intelligence satellites. 
However, the Russians decided to downgrade the quality of the 
photographs for sale in the open market, and are at this point 
selling photographs with a resolution of 2 meters. Photography 
experts argue that this level of resolution enables excellent 
identification of military targets and locations. Militerm 
Technologies believes that within a few months it will be able 
to sell photographs with a resolution better than 2 meters.

<F P=106> [Report by Gay Bekhor and Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] In an interview with HA'ARETZ on 21 February, 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa reacted to the various publications 
which have been saying that Mubarak's regime is under a threat: 
"This is idle talk, an interpretation based on wrong 
assumptions, a serious exaggeration, a misunderstanding of the 
reality in Egypt, and a significant deviation from the truth." 
  This is the first reaction by an Egyptian official to 
reports 
published in the British weekly SUNDAY TIMES according to which 
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that there is a real 
chance that President Mubarak will not be able to hold on to his 
position due to the pressure of Islamic terror. 
  Foreign Minister Musa rejected these reports outright. "This 
is not Islamic extremism, but instead extremism in the name of 
Islam. These extremists have nothing to do with Islam." Lashing 
out at religious terror elements in Egypt several days ago, 
Husni Mubarak made similar remarks. 
  Asked for the best way to handle Islamic terror in his 
country, Musa said: "The only way is to have terrorism curbed 
by the government and the security forces, which they are doing. 
At the same time, the reasons for this extremism are known. 
The long-term economic reform plan will take care of the 
extremism." 
  During the interview Minister Musa asked if we would use the 
term "terror activity," and not "Islamic terror activity." He 
explained that "the government is now taking very powerful steps 
on the ground in terms of security and maintaining public order. 
I believe, therefore, that terror activity will diminish." 
  Musa did not specify the number of supporters of the 
Egyptian 
terror and the extent of their influence, but said: "I believe 
the figures are on the decline because the reforms and the 
determined activities against those gangs will clearly diminish 
their abilities." 
  Answering a question on who is behind terror activity in 
Egypt and who should be blamed for it, he said: "Many domestic 
and external elements are behind the terror. I would rather not 
elaborate." When asked whether it is Iran, he said he would not 
mention names. He repeated that "the claim that the activities 
of the terror gangs in Egypt might destabilize the very 
existence of the current regime is definitely an exaggerated 
interpretation." 
  U.S. evaluation elements have estimated that Mubarak's 
regime 
is in danger, but amended their assessment and now believe that 
the Egyptian administration is stable enough and has managed to 
develop the appropriate tools for dealing with fundamentalist 
terror. 
  A report received in Jerusalem several days ago says that 
the 
updated assessments of the U.S. evaluation elements indicates 
that the Egyptian regime is basically stable and able to deal 
with crises. The evaluation also says that Egypt has a long 
tradition of and broad support for the government which has 
managed to absorb shocks in the past, such as after the death of 
President 'Abd-al-Nasir in 1970 and the murder of President 
Anwar al-Sadat in 1981. 
  According to the U.S. evaluation, the Egyptian regime will 
endure even if Mubarak personally loses power. 
  The evaluation elements disagree on whether fundamentalism 
is 
a different phenomenon in each Middle East country or whether 
there exists a "domino effect" and mutual influence of 
fundamentalist Islam acts in Algiers, Egypt, Jordan, and the 
Gaza Strip. 
  The annual intelligence report, presented to the government 
some four weeks ago by Major General Uri Sagi, head of the 
Israel Defense Forces Intelligence Branch, says that 
fundamentalism would be a source of concern in the long run if 
it succeeds in toppling the regime of one of the neighboring 
countries such as Egypt or Jordan. At the same time it does not 
pose an immediate threat. The report states that there is no 
danger that the Egyptian Government would fall this year. 
  Israeli analysts are following the situation in Egypt and 
have recently presented the political echelons with reports on 
the Muslim movements there, but did not find that the Egyptian 
Government is in danger. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kuwait, 23 Feb (MENA)--The Kuwaiti Government has 
decided to recall its ambassador from Qatar for consultations. 
Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry officials declined to comment on this 
step. A responsible source told a MENA correspondent that this 
recall is routine and does not have other connotations. 
  However, observers in Kuwait say that the recall of the 
Kuwaiti ambassador comes in the wake of tense relations between 
the two countries after Qatari Television over the past few days 
screened video reports from inside Iraq on the negative effect 
of the economic blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. 
  Observers said Qatari Television on Friday carried an 
interview with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf. 
Kuwaiti officials interpreted this action as being tantamount 
to Qatar's adoption of the Iraqi viewpoint. 
  The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry on Sunday summoned Qatari 
Ambassador Ahmad Bin-Ghanim al-Rumayhi and conveyed to him 
unfriendly and unofficial criticism of the Qatari stand. The 
Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry also expressed apprehension about this 
rapprochement between Qatar and Iraq and asked him to explain 
the Qatari view on this subject. 
  Press reports today said that Kuwaiti Foreign Minister 
Shaykh 
Sabah al-Ahmad sent a strongly worded letter to Shaykh Fahim 
al-Qasimi, secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council on 
the recent rapprochement between Qatar and the Iraqi regime.

  [Text] Damascus, Feb 21 (GNA)--Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad and Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi agreed during 
their talks here on Sunday [20 February] to adhere to the 
principle of a comprehensive settlement in the region, reliable 
Syrian sources said. 
  The sources told Qatar News Agency that the two leaders also 
pledged not to sign a unilateral peace accord with Israel, and 
that progress should be achieved on all tracks. 
  The two leaders denounced Israeli attempts to reach separate 
peace accords with Arab states involved in the peace process and 
expressed strong support for the comprehensive peace formula 
based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the 
sources said. The sources noted that Syria emphasized that it 
was politically committed to working for the implementation of 
Security Council Resolution 425 calling on Israel to withdraw 
from southern Lebanon. 
  The sources said Syria has already turned down an Israeli 
offer to separate the question of the Israeli occupation of the 
Syrian Golan Heights from the Israeli occupation of south 
Lebanon, and at the same time, Syria reaffirmed that a balanced 
solution should be achieved on all tracks. 
  Syria has succeeded in convincing the United States, via 
recent contacts between Damascus and Washington, about the 
importance of implementing Security Council Resolution 425, the 
sources said.

  [Text] Tehran, 22 Feb--The Supreme Assembly of the Islamic 
Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] today said that 200 handpicked 
members of the special security services had completed a 
training course in al-Ramadi province, western Iraq, to carry 
out terrorist and sabotage operations in Iraqi Kurdistan and 
some neighboring countries under the direct supervision of 
Qusay, the youngest son of the ruler of Baghdad who is 
responsible for the special security organization. 
  Citing informed sources in Iraq, the assembly's statement 
said that the sabotage teams received extensive lessons during 
the course under the supervision of experts experienced in 
assassination, explosives, terrorism, spreading rumors, and 
sowing the seeds of sedition. 
  The statement said that those who were trained had been 
divided into four groups according to the tasks allotted to each 
group. The first group had been given the task of assassinating 
foreigners working for the UN agencies and organizations that 
are active in many parts of Iraq, particularly in the Iraqi 
Kurdistan region. The second group would carry out operations 
against prominent figures of the Iraqi opposition. The 
statement added that the third group had been given 
responsibility for sabotage operations and planting mines in 
important and densely populated areas in Iraqi Kurdistan, Iran, 
and Syria, where the Iraqi opposition is active. The statement 
pointed out that the fourth group would spread rumors and leak 
fabricated information through various media channels to mislead 
public opinion and create a state of frustration among the sons 
of the Iraqi people in and out of Iraq. 
  In another development, the assembly's statement said that 
the pathology department in Baghdad was receiving between 20 and 
25 bodies daily brought in by officers of the special security 
organization, which is under the control of Qusay Saddam Husayn. 
  The assembly said that, according to reliable information 
received from Iraq, the bodies of people who had been executed 
were transported in ambulances with a confidential note from the 
special security organization ordering the pathologist to issue 
death certificates, stipulating that death had occurred as a 
result of a long illness, the nonavailability of treatment, or a 
heart attack. The statement added that the special security 
organization's note stressed that when the bodies of those 
executed were handed over to their families, they should be told 
not to open the coffins and to keep the funeral and burial 
rituals to the minimum.

  [Text] Amman, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Jordanian police arrested 15 
alleged members of Abu-Nidal's Palestinian "terrorist" group 
which is suspected of having killed a Jordanian diplomat in 
Beirut, a judicial source said here Tuesday [22 February]. 
  The police on Saturday launched sweeps targeting Abu-Nidal's 
banned Fatah-Revolutionary Council movement, arresting fifteen 
persons and closing a trade office, the source told AFP. 
  The crackdown was decided after the Lebanese authorities had 
proved that Abu-Nidal's group was behind the killing of Jordan's 
embassy first secretary in Beirut, Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, on 
January 29, the sources added. 
  Documents and propaganda leaflets were found in the trade 
office, located in the al-'Abdali neighborhood of the capital 
Amman. 
  Investigations are underway to determine if there is enough 
evidence to put the 15 on trial, the source said. 
  Most of the suspects have had already spent time in prison 
in 
the 1970s for their links to Abu-Nidal's group. 
  King Husayn on Feb 13 accused an Arab country of having 
ordered an extremist group whose leader lives in that country to 
carry out the murder. The king did not name the country but a 
Jordanian source said he was referring to Libya. 
  Tripoli has denied these accusations.

<F P=106> [Address by President Liamine Zeroual at workers' rally in </F>
Dar ech-Chaab on 23 February -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God the Merciful and the 
Compassionate, Brothers Algerian workers, Sisters Algerian 
workers, I greet you and through you I greet all Algerian male 
and female workers inside and outside the homeland. 
  We are meeting today to commemorate the annual anniversary 
of 
the General Union of Algerian Workers and the anniversary of the 
recovery of the national wealth. On this occasion I 
congratulate all male and female workers. [passage omitted] 
  We are celebrating this anniversary while Algeria is 
tackling 
its many-faceted crisis, including the economic crisis. We are 
aware that the first ones affected by this crisis are the 
workers, the people on low income, and the most deprived social 
groups. The economic stagnation has led for years to an 
increase of unemployment and shortage of investments. This has 
added to the difficulty of living conditions. 
  I take this opportunity to salute our workers who face the 
difficulty of this situation with patience and wisdom deserving 
all appreciation and without abandoning their duty of 
safeguarding the national economy and without surrendering to 
the provocations or the political one-upmanships coming from 
several quarters. [passage omitted] 
  We are following with interest the situation of other 
countries that went through this experiment; we are aware of the 
economic and social pitfalls that went hand in hand with these 
experiments; and this prompts us neither to worship nor imitate 
any experiment; we do not give any preference to one over 
another. 
  We are aware that no matter how strong the capabilities of 
liberalism may be, they remain limited like any other economic 
choices. If easing the negative sides of the market economy 
does happen only through a genuine mobilization of the nation's 
cadres, and the establishment of a real program for national 
solidarity; this factor also takes places via the support of the 
state, the bolstering of its capabilities to defend the most 
needy classes, the presence of a scientific management of 
resources, and an increase of national production. 
  In this field, we aim to strengthen the state; and at the 
same time support dialogue and social consultation, because the 
Algerian state belongs to all Algerians; it is the state of law; 
it is there to serve the people in its entirely. 
  However, we should reiterate that the state is not and will 
not be lenient with those who work for the destruction of the 
country and the sabotage of its economic capabilities. In these 
circumstances, the workers are called upon to mobilize 
themselves and show vigilance to defend their institutions 
against acts of sabotage. 
  Brothers and sisters, if we want to meet the challenge, 
first 
of all we should rediscover the value of work and the value of 
efforts and efficiency; rewards should be based on this 
criterion alone. Here, we should be frank, we have squandered a 
great deal of precious time because of absenteeism and because 
of management negligence; because of wastage and mismanagement 
in production; and an exaggerated usage of the right to strike. 
  Reviving the national economy, upon which depends the 
stability and equilibrium of society, falls within the tasks 
that await us all: namely, the restoration of security, the 
eradication of violence, the underpinning of the state's 
structure, the imposition of the rule of law by the competent 
authorities, the introduction of profound reforms to the state 
administration, and opening the door of opportunity for youth 
and capable cadres. All of these actions are seeking to renew 
the system of the country in a comprehensive way. 
  In the next few weeks the economic and social council will 
be 
installed where members of various walks of life in the society 
will meet to discuss the issues and submit proposals in their 
respect to the executive authorities. 
  We are convinced that the trade union organization 
represented by the general union of Algerian workers will play a 
significant role in these consultations. 
  In the political field we stand by the consultation and the 
wide participation and by the serious dialogue with all national 
political forces which abide by the constitution and reject the 
use of violence. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers and sisters, in conclusion I reiterate 
congratulations to the Algerian workers, and I call on them once 
again to be mobilized and vigilant and to work more and be more 
united and defend the future and the destiny of the country. 
  May God make us all successful, and may God's peace and 
blessings be upon you.

  [Text] Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, in a communique sent to 
AFP, claimed responsibility for the latest train attack and 
renewed its warning to foreigners. 
  "It is up to tourists to leave the country so as not to 
endanger their lives in the confrontation underway between the 
al-Jama'ah and the repressive regime," it said. 
  The latest attack was in retaliation for last week's death 
sentence against three al-Jama'ah members in the army, it said, 
adding that four policemen were killed for the same reason. 
  A court in Sidi Barrani, near the Libyan border, condemned 
the three soldiers to death for plotting to assassinate 
President Husni Mubarak at the local air base. 
  [Paris AFP in English at 1654 GMT on 23 February adds the 
following: "The bomb attack on a Cairo-Luxor train wounded 11 
people on Wednesday, including six foreign tourists, the 
interior ministry said. The foreigners were two Australians, 
two Germans and two New Zealanders, it said." 
  ["While MENA said the bomb exploded in a carriage, other 
informed sources said assailants hurled it at the moving train."]

Sa'id Rif'at today met Mohamed Abshir, the leader of the 
Democratic Front for the Salvation of Somalia, who arrived in 
Cairo earlier today at the invitation of the Egyptian Foreign 
Ministry to attend a meeting of Somali faction leaders. The 
meeting will discuss the situation in Somalia and ways to 
coordinate the positions of the factions with the aim of 
effecting national reconciliation before the United States and 
European forces withdraw from Somalia by the end of March. 
  Abshir announced that Somalia is passing through a critical 
stage and that the U.S. and European forces have begun their 
withdrawal. 
  Noting that Egypt is helping the United Nations to find a 
solution to the problem, he stressed Somalia's need for this 
role in its quest for peace and national reconciliation. He 
voiced the hope that the Somali leaders will show the necessary 
sense of responsibility to restore peace and security in the 
country and establish a central authority. He said that when 
this has been done, free elections can be held supervised by the 
Arab countries, United Nations, OAU, and ICO [Islamic Conference 
Organization] to ensure they are fair.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Feb (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR urges the Lebanese 
Government to control the activities of Hizballah in southern 
Lebanon, especially in the part controlled by Israel, allegedly 
as its security zone. 
  The paper says in its editorial for 24 February: This, 
however, does not mean we are calling for stopping the activity 
of the Lebanese resistance, which is a legitimate act against 
any occupier. But resistance must stem from genuinely patriotic 
elements; it must not be left to groups with suspect objectives. 
  The paper says Hizballah is working on behalf of Iran, 
implementing its policies and receiving financing and arms from 
it. 
  The paper says Iran sponsors terrorist groups in a number of 
Arab and Islamic countries, and is trying to foil the peace 
talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese. 
  AL-AKHBAR concludes that imposing Lebanese Government 
control 
over Hizballah is an essential step that is in Lebanon's 
interest.

  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Dozens of officers and soldiers 
from the opposition Libyan National Army [LNA] have issued a 
statement in which they said: "We have this week seen a 
statement addressed to public opinion and signed by two comrades 
in arms who are LNA officers. It contained a number of 
contradictions, prevarications, and false claims which, we know 
perfectly well, did not emanate from these two brothers or have 
anything to do with the code of honor, struggle, and military 
solidarity we committed ourselves to as far back as the first 
day we decided that confrontation with the unjust regime in the 
homeland was inevitable." 
  Colonel Salih al-Habbuni and Lieutenant Colonel 'Abdallah 
al-Shaykhi had issued a statement saying that LNA Commander 
Colonel Khalifah Haftar had lost all his leadership posts and 
that the army was one of the institutions of the National Front 
for the Salvation of Libya [NFSL], the opposition faction which 
has suffered a split. 
  Haftar, it should be recalled, had signed the secession 
statement and announced the withdrawal of all the opposition 
army's officers and soldiers from the NFSL. 
  The statement of the officers and soldiers said: "These two 
brothers were used by certain parties as a tool to break our 
fighters' unity of ranks and purpose.... We reject the plots 
hatched against our National Army and the fact that some of its 
members are implicated in cheap destructive attempts and are 
being used by an individual or a group as an instrument for the 
fulfillment of power ambitions and temporary selfish gains." 
  They also declared: 
  "1. The LNA rejects everything in the statement issued by 
these two comrades and see the issuing of that statement in 
their names as a cheap and failed attempt to undermine the unity 
of our patriotic forces. Despite that, we give them a chance to 
reconsider their position and to rejoin their comrades in arms 
in the same trench. We remind them of the military honor and 
the historic responsibility entrusted to us by our brothers and 
our people. They should, before it is too late, realize the 
seriousness of slipping into such cheap attempts perpetrated by 
power-mad individuals. 
  "2. The LNA reaffirms its absolute commitment as an integral 
military unit to the declaration made by Commander in Chief 
Staff Col. Khalifah Abu-al-Qasim Haftar, that the LNA has left 
the NFSL and severed all organizational links with it and would 
not abide by any decision or directive issued by it. 
  "3. The LNA declares that the statements made by the NFSL 
Secretary General (Muhammad al-Muqaryif) on the appointment of a 
new LNA command was but a link in the cheap plot against the LNA 
unity and cohesion in the service of his own personal aims and 
interests, and a manifestation of the autocratic and domineering 
spirit which was one of the reasons why many, including the LNA, 
have abandoned the NFSL. The LNA rejects all kinds of hegemony 
and blind domineering, refuses to be led by anyone other than 
its honorable sons, rejects the ignorant methods of charting its 
national struggle, rejects all the statements and decisions made 
by the NFSL's secretary general, considering them to be 
tantamount to interference in its affairs, and announces its 
adherence to its command, options, and struggle programs. 
  "4. The LNA is an integral part of the Libyan partriotic 
armed forces at home for it was born out of these forces and 
made of their strugglers, and it belongs to the entire homeland 
and to all the Libyan people. It declares to everyone that it 
will not relent nor will it stop fighting the corrupt regime 
imposing itself on our country and people, and will join hands 
will all honorable men to wage the battle of liberation. It 
most confidently, strongly, and unitedly renews the pledge and 
promise to its Commander Haftar that it will resolutely continue 
the struggle with heroic determination and patience until final 
salvation and definite victory." 
  The statement was signed by the following officers: Captains 
Nasr al-Din al-Sadiq Karmus, Salim 'Abd-al-Salam al-Zuyaghn, 
'Abdallah al-Asghar, 'Abd-al-'Azim Muhammad Yusuf, Salah 
Muhammad Shu'ayb, Sa'id al-Bal'azi, Musaddiq al-Fanidi, Sa'd 
al-Ghazal Madi, 'Ali 'Ashur, and Abu-Sha'alah Ibrahim; First 
Lieutenants al-Asmar 'Abd-al-Salam Ibridge, 'Adil Abu-Zayd 
al-Hajjaji, and Muhammad Tahir Rashid; and Second Lieutenants 
Milad Ibrahim Abu-Zahw and Misbah Mas'ud al-Farajani. 
  It was also signed by 59 warrant officers.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih has 
confirmed that the tour by Donald Petterson, the U.S ambassador 
in Khartoum, of some areas in the south of the country took 
place with the knowledge of the Foreign Ministry. He added that 
the American ambassador had briefed him during a meeting with 
him today about his tour of some areas on the southern border. 
Abu-Salih said that the government approved the food drops for 
camps of displaced people in the Mundri and (Parajok) areas in 
cooperation with the United Nations. Dr. Abu-Salih added that 
he had assured the American ambassador that the government was 
trying to end to the ongoing war in the south, stressing that 
Sudan was very dependent on the initiative of the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development states. 
The foreign minister affirmed that a cease-fire in the south 
should be part of a comprehensive solution to the problem of the 
south.

  [Text] Nairobi, 22 Feb (AFP) -- The rebel Sudan People's 
Liberation Army (SPLA) has claimed that its forces repulsed a 
huge government infantry brigade between Amadi and Lui offensive 
on February 12, capturing tanks, lorries and communications 
equipment. 
  A statement issued here Tuesday by John Garang's SPLA 
faction 
said its forces of Maridi-Mundri, reinforced by those from 
Rumbek, under the command of Gier Chuong Aluong and Jadallah 
Wani, destroyed two tanks, and 16 lorries, forcing the enemy to 
run in disarray. 
  During their flight, the government forces abandoned seven 
landrovers and four Toyotas mounted with heavy machine guns, 
ammunition of various categories and food, the statement said, 
adding that SPLA forces also captured a radio communication set 
and one of its operators, a man from the Nuba Mountains. 
  The Sudanese Government has persistently denied that its 
forces had mounted a major offensive in southern Sudan, where a 
bloody civil war has been raging since 1983 between government 
forces and southern rebels seeking to end domination of the 
mainly Christian and animist south by the Arabised Moslem north. 
Khartoum has instead said the fighting has been between the 
different faction of the SPLA, a claim that has been strongly 
denied by the southern rebels.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah al-Hajj: "Sudanese Information Minister </F>
Tells AL-HAYAH: The Opposition's Call for a Blockade Against 
Sudan Confirms Its Isolation From Its People"] 
  [Text] Jeddah -- Sudanese Information Minister 
'Abd-al-Basit Sabdarat has strongly attacked the Sudanese 
opposition's meeting at the British House of Lords and saw the 
opposition leaders' call on the Security Council to impose a 
blockade against Sudan "while they stay at European hotels, as 
exposing their isolation from the people because, through such a 
call, they seek to blockade and starve their own people." 
  He told AL-HAYAH in Jeddah that this British step "confirms 
the soundness and verity of the Sudanese decision expelling the 
British ambassador from Khartoum because he interferred in the 
same way in Sudanese affairs." 
  He added: "It is really regrettable that Sudanese people now 
enter the British Parliament and talk about the issue of the 
south forgetting that Britain was the main cause of that problem 
originally. It was the one which created the problem of the 
south and then prevented the interaction of the north and south 
for many years." 
  Sabdarat ridiculed the Sudanese opposition parties meeting 
in 
London saying that "they believe victory will be theirs at the 
hands of the crusaders. They forget that by embracing them 
Britain aims to kill the Islamic and cultural trend in Sudan." 
He criticized the results of the meetings and said that "they 
gave a true picture of the state of the Sudanese opposition 
abroad. They were unable to agree at these meetings. While the 
Democratic Unionist Party supported Sudan's unity, the Ummah 
Party wanted an interim period after which the question of 
self-determination would be considered, and then Bona Malwal, 
representative of the south, said that Sudan's independence came 
about incorrectly, held the north responsible for all the 
mistakes, and presented the issue as a dispute between the north 
and the south." The Sudanese information minister added: "The 
opposition grouping cannot take a stand on the question of 
self-determination in southern Sudan because the Sudanese people 
know the weakness of that point." 
  Sabdarat said that "those urging the Security Council to 
intervene militarily and to impose a blockade against Sudan 
forgot, as they sat in hotels in London and Europe, that they 
were in fact calling for a blockade against, and for the 
starvation of, their own people in Sudan, as if they were on 
another planet." He accused them of "having a narrow view of 
things, and the fact that they stay at posh hotels in luxury 
does not enable them to judge the situation in Sudan 
realistically." 
  The Sudanese information minister praised his country's 
relations with Eritrea saying that they "are strategic relations 
and we will not allow emotions and emotionalism to affect the 
strategy of these relations."

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 23 (AFP)--The Sudanese authorities foiled 
a plot to kill PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Khartoum in 
December, the Egyptian weekly Al-Ahali reported Wednesday [23 
February]. 
  An Iranian diplomat serving in Khartoum and two Lebanese 
were 
arrested and held until the end of an Islamic conference, during 
which they planned to kill 'Arafat, the leftist opposition 
weekly said, without citing its sources. The three were later 
expelled. 
  Al-Ahali said they were found in possession of pistols with 
silencers and poisoned knives. 
  Khartoum was tipped off about the plot by non-Sudanese 
sources. 
  The paper also said most of the 1,900 Egyptians who 
volunteered to fight against the Soviet occupation of 
Afghanistan in the 1980s were currently in Yemen and Sudan. 
  The Egyptian Government holds the veterans of the Afghan 
conflict responsible for fomenting fundamentalist unrest in 
Egypt, in which more than 300 people have died since the violent 
anti-government campaign started in March 1992.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Portuguese Prime Minister Silva 
spoke of bilateral relations, which in the last few years have 
enjoyed a significant boost. He noted that trade has increased 
by 30 percent. Silva went on to mention the negotiations 
between Israel and the European Union. He advocated an 
identical accord to that in force with the European Free Trade 
Association countries. 
  Prime Minister Rabin said he did not believe that the 
Israeli 
troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho would take 
place in the next two weeks as it had been reported. Rabin is 
optimistic but said the next three months was a more reasonable 
period for a final accord.

  [Text] The Israeli prime minister is in Portugal. An 
accord between Israelis and Palestinians regarding the 
withdrawal of troops from the Gaza Strip and Jericho could be 
reached in the next two weeks. This is what Yitzhaq Rabin said 
today at a news conference: 
  [Begin Rabin recording, in English with superimposed 
Portuguese translation] It will be done in a few weeks, more 
than two weeks. And I don't believe that it is advisable to be 
discussing a specific timetable at the moment. I can assure you 
it will be less than three months as originally planned. The 
real problem now is not how quickly the accord will be 
implemented once it is reached, but how we reach it. I am very 
sorry to have to say this, but it will take longer than two 
weeks. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] That was the Israeli prime minister, translated 
by Miguel Moreira. Prime Minister Cavaco Silva was also at the 
news conference. He said that Portugal supports an agreement 
between the EC and Israel as long as mutual interests are 
safeguarded.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres </F>
by Smadar Peri in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [Peri] Mr. Peres, how do you feel after signing 
the agreement? 
  [Peres] We carried out a difficult task. We had two main 
difficulties: one, the matter itself; two, getting to know the 
partner. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, I reached the 
conclusion that my partner is not what I thought he would be -- 
for better or for worse. He is absolutely different. At the 
same time, I found that the matters under discussion are much 
more difficult than we first estimated. 
  Considering that we reached an agreement without the 
pressure 
of war or acts of terror, I believe this is a fine achievement. 
I am very sober, and I believe we have been negotiating with 
ourselves. The Palestinians do not really have much to give us. 
We, on the other hand, can free ourselves of the need to rule 
another nation, police its life. There is no point to negotiate 
otherwise. 
  This was not a give-and-take negotiating process. It was 
more a process of "liberate yourself, and gain your truth." 
  [Peri] Who exactly signed the agreement for the other side? 
Do you believe the PLO indeed represents the Palestinians today? 
  [Peres] This is a good question. I would like to say 
something from my political experience. Sometimes I ask myself 
what is a leader. Some say a leader should be strong or 
talented. I believe a leader should have one talent: to 
represent his people. 
  I believe that to a large extent Yasir 'Arafat does 
represent 
the condition of the Palestinian people. I accept him as one, 
and I believe that, from his point of view, he is very devoted 
to his role. The negotiations, therefore, were held with the 
Palestinian people and its representatives. 
  [Peri] What did you learn about 'Arafat and his associates 
during the negotiations? 
  [Peres] Primarily, I learned how difficult it is for them to 
reach decisions. The image that we have that everything is 
organized, that clear cut decisions.... 
  [Peri] For example? 
  [Peres] On almost every issue. I saw their hesitations, I 
saw that I was sitting with undecided people. That is, there is 
a great difference between their rhetoric and reality. The 
rhetoric is unequivocal, while making a decision is a very 
complex process, which for them is not at all simple. 
  It was very hard on them. They hold diversified views. Even 
'Arafat had a hard time. In addition, they are really 
suspicious and fearful. 
  [Peri] Do they suspect us or themselves? 
  [Peres] They suspect us, and they fear their people 
reactions. 
  [Peri] Who matters most to 'Arafat -- those who surround 
him or the residents of the territories? 
  [Peres] What matters to him most are his own views and 
hunches. He has to ask himself first of all what the residents 
of the territories will accept and what they will reject. And 
the answer is not simple. I have noticed that he usually 
listens to what others are saying, and he hesitates a lot when 
making decisions. That is contrary to all I have ever believed. 
  [Peri] Those who followed the negotiations could not fail to 
notice that people crop up next to 'Arafat, and then they 
disappear. We started the negotiations with Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 
'Abbas], and yet he was absent at the signing ceremony this week. 
  [Peres] Theirs is not a state organization. It is a 
political organization, a coalition founded on accords and 
discords, unlike us, with people being elected to the Knesset 
and the government in an orderly fashion. 
  [Peri] Although only a short time has passed since the 
signing, we can guess that criticism will be leveled at 'Arafat 
from within the PLO. 
  [Peres] Criticism is always leveled after each change. 
People do not like changes, and this one is very significant. 
I think if we failed, God forbid, the disappointment in Israel, 
in the PLO, and the entire world would be great and total. We 
have in fact coped with extremely complex issues. 
  [Peri] How did it work? Can you describe the obstacles you 
had to overcome before the agreement was signed? 
  [Peres] I told 'Arafat in our first meeting: You tell your 
delegation and I will tell ours to conduct genuine negotiations. 
When they feel they are drawing closer to each other, they do 
not have to go back to us. When they feel they are drawing 
apart, they should avoid reaching an unbridgeable point. It is 
better for them to summon us before they become too entrenched 
in their stands. 
  [Peri] How many times were you summoned in the course of the 
negotiations? 
  [Peres] A great many times. The delegates wanted to consult 
all the time, but I also had to be in touch with home, with the 
prime minister, on the most vital issues. Then the Egyptians 
approached me and then the Palestinians. I only intervened in 
cases which I feared would become insurmountable obstacles. 
  I think it is the right time to say a word about our team: 
We would not have reached an agreement without them. They did 
an excellent job, they worked together as a team. 
  [Peri] What was the toughest moment in these negotiations? 
  [Peres] Almost everything was tough. There were a few times 
when various issues were raised during one single day, and 
almost each one of these issues was dynamite. The last issue -- 
border crossing control -- was the toughest. This issue was 
formulated in two drafts -- an Israeli and a Palestinian -- and 
people who read both might have thought there was no way they 
could be bridged. And yet we did it. 
  [Peri] You have said that in this matter we achieved more 
than we had hoped. 
  [Peres] We achieved an unequivocal Palestinian acceptance of 
our full responsibility -- security and administration -- for 
the crossings. This issue was ambiguous for a long period. 
  [Peri] Did the difficulty lie in the Palestinian adherence 
to symbols expressing their yearning for a state? 
  [Peres] The Palestinians were unable to distinguish red 
lines from imaginary lines. One of our difficulties stemmed 
from the fact that many unauthorized Israelis gave the 
Palestinians all kinds of messages that should have never been 
delivered. 
  [Peri] Such as? 
  [Peres] Such as that Israel would give them 140 square 
kilometers (instead of 54). They made an invalid promise. 
  [Peri] Who are these Israelis? 
  [Peres] I do not want to mention names. These are 
unauthorized Israelis who traveled to Tunis and made pilgrimages 
to 'Arafat. Who authorized them? I must say, there is a lot of 
unwarranted talk in Israel. 
  [Peri] What else did they promise 'Arafat? 
  [Peres] Almost everything. They let the Palestinians 
understand that if they as much as asked or demanded, they would 
get it. I am not acquainted with all of them. I got feedbacks 
from the Palestinians. They presented demands based on the 
"pledges" they had received. 
  [Peri] And what was your reply in these cases? 
  [Peres] I told the truth. I said these people had no 
authority. 
  [Peri] Who exactly is our Palestinian partner? 
  [Peres] At one point 'Arafat told me: Do you want to turn 
me into the head of a small village or al-Nabi Musa's shaykh? I 
told him: Don't forget that when Israel was established in 1948 
only 650,000 lived there. Today you are the leader of almost 
one million Palestinians. 
  Our main partner is the one million Palestinians living in 
Gaza and the Jericho area. 
  [Peri] What do you think about the fact that not all members 
of 'Arafat's entourage plan to reside in the territories? 
  [Peres] I don't want to deal with the personal aspect. I 
think they still do not fully comprehend what has really 
happened here. Life in exile, generally speaking, has many 
elements of make-believe: It is life in a realm of uniforms, 
symbols, words, and declarations. There is no government, no 
state, no budget. 
  [Peri] 'Arafat seems to be a man of symbols, words, and 
declarations. 
  [Peres] He is a survivor. It is an undeniable fact that so 
far he has remained the man who represents the Palestinians more 
than any other. To date there is nobody as acceptable to them 
as 'Arafat. 
  I did not encounter any problems in negotiating with him. 
Contrary to all the rumors, I did not find him to be edgy, but 
he is very tense. I have to admit, however, that I found him 
different from what I thought. At the same time it has to be 
noted that I met him only on certain occasions, during 
negotiations, when he has to consider everything carefully and 
evince great responsibility. I even felt that he was somewhat 
concerned lest he fails to grasp the full meaning of the issues 
under discussion. Altogether I did not find it difficult to 
conduct negotiations with him. 
  [Peri] How did you find him different? 
  [Peres] On the basis of newspaper reports I thought he is a 
man who loses his patience and who jumps to conclusions very 
quickly. 
  [Peri] The most important question is what will happen if it 
transpires that 'Arafat does not want to or cannot honor the 
agreement? 
  [Peres] The answer is simple: The Israeli public must 
decide what kind of relations it wants to have with the 
Palestinians, and whether the Palestinians want peace as much as 
we do. I believe most of them do. They are tired of war and 
terrorism. 
  I believe the Palestinian people have the same biological 
dynamics as all people: They see a world abounding with 
opportunities for the younger generation. 
  This week I visited the Cairo book fair. It was interesting 
to discover what people read there: scientific and nonfiction 
books. A new, modern era has opened and everybody is trying to 
adjust to it. 
  [Peri] What did we achieve in this agreement? 
  [Peres] We overcame many difficult problems without 
compromising our security, because we made no compromises on 
security issues. What we accomplished there can be summed up in 
one expression: Anti-Bosnia. 
  [Peri] In his speech after the signing ceremony 'Arafat 
emphasized the economic issue. He is concerned about this. 
  [Peres] I am happy about this, because this is the issue 
about which I spoke with 'Arafat more than anything else. I 
told him the test in the territories will mainly be at the 
personal-economic level. People in the territories want to know 
whether they will finally be able to bring home more than $1,000 
a year. This is the ultimate test. I think that a happy 
neighbor is a good neighbor, whereas a dejected neighbor is a 
bad neighbor. 
  [Peri] What will happen if their economic expectations are 
not met? 
  [Peres] I don't see any reason why it shouldn't succeed. We 
too have to help, and there is also a lot of international 
goodwill in this issue. Besides, judging by the critics of the 
agreement you would think our present situation in Gaza is 
excellent. We must remember that our starting point is not all 
that good. We will always be able to preserve what we have now. 
  [Peri] Could you dispel the fog surrounding the 
negotiations? Who actually led them on their side? 
  [Peres] 'Arafat, no doubt about it. He listened, he was not 
always knowledgeable about the issue at hand, but he was the 
leader. No decision was made without him, and he occasionally 
caused problems. 
  The man is a symbol. He is not coming to the territories 
with psychological baggage. He kept the Palestinian cause in 
the international and Arab public eye for 25 years. 
  [Peri] And this agreement places him on the way to a 
Palestinian state. 
  [Peres] They want a Palestinian state, but there is no 
mention of it in the agreement. In the official meeting between 
myself and 'Arafat in Davos, in the presence of our delegation, 
he said: You think I do not know the difference between 
autonomy and a state, but I would like to tell you that I do. I 
realize we are not talking about a state, and we would rather 
have a confederation with Jordan. 
  This statement is also binding on Hawatimah and Jibril. I do 
not think 'Arafat was saying that in confidence. He did not 
need to convince my five aides. 
  [Peri] Is the fact that there is no Palestinian state on the 
way supposed to appease us? 
  [Peres] No, such a possibility has not been eliminated. 
Moreover, there is no such thing as appeasing situations. Life 
is dynamic, and whatever is said today could change tomorrow. 
  [Peri] What will happen on 13 April? 
  [Peres] According to the agreement, we must effect the 
withdrawal four months after the signing of the agreement. We 
are not committed to 13 April. At the same time, I believe we 
will all make a genuine effort to meet the tight schedule. Our 
people, too, want to be sure we made a feasible agreement. 
  [Peri] How did you communicate with the prime minister 
during the negotiations? 
  [Peres] We coordinated our positions and held consultations 
throughout. Our consultations were matter-of-fact. The fact is 
that he ultimately approved the agreement. 
  [Peri] It has been three nights you have not slept because 
of the negotiations. You have actually been doing the dirty 
work. 
  [Peres] That does not matter to me. If the life of one 
child is spared as a result of my work, it is all worth to me. 
I know exactly what my position is. Nobody can take away from 
me what I have done in my life, neither the mistakes nor the 
successes. Nobody can add to or detract from them. I know 
exactly where I stand. 
  [Peri] You did hard and ungrateful work to achieve this 
agreement. 
  [Peres] I do not think important achievements can be 
attained without hard work. There are no miracles. 
  [Peri] What sort of nation will we be after the agreement? 
  [Peres] We will be free of something we could not continue 
to endure: ruling over another nation in a very narrow strip of 
land currently inhabited by over 4 million Jews and 3 million 
non-Jews. Such a situation can easily turn into a tragedy if 
there are no statesmen who can exactly envision the dangers and 
risks. 
  Besides, I truly believe we are en route to the 21st 
century, 
in which the sources of power and wealth will not be measured in 
material dimensions but in spiritual and intellectual ones. 
  [Peri] Could you describe for us a specific moment 
symbolizing the entire negotiating process? 
  [Peres] We were arguing about the criteria to be applied in 
the border crossings, whether a man who was a terrorist would be 
allowed in. 'Arafat said: If that is the case, I will not be 
allowed to cross. I told him: Do not brag. You used to be a 
terrorist. Today you are an ex-terrorist. 
  At first he was taken aback, but then he realized what I 
meant. I told him: We are not the only ones who changed their 
attitude toward you. You also changed.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that five 
Arab countries are currently working to cancel the Arab boycott 
against Israel. These countries are Egypt, Tunisia, Oman, 
Qatar, and Morocco. Peres stressed that the Arab boycott is as 
much a problem for the Arab world as it is for Israel. 
  Speaking before the Knesset Economic Affairs Committee, 
which 
discussed the effects of the Arab boycott on Israel, the foreign 
minister added that in its war against the Arab boycott, Israel 
is not seeking to take over the Arab world. Through the peace 
process, Israel is trying to bring about an economization of 
politics instead of a politicization of economics. This was 
reported by our correspondent Eytan Almog. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1105 GMT on 21 February 
adds that Foreign Minister Peres also said that "the economic 
aid Israel receives from the United States compensates for the 
losses incurred as a result of the Arab boycott."]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "No Big Deal"] </F>
  [Text] Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah is 
obviously not going to Damascus to express his condolences to 
President al-Asad. They are not friends, and condolences can be 
sent in a telegram that will travel the same indirect way he and 
his friends were to travel to Damascus -- through a third 
country and bearing no Israeli markings. The Solan 
Communications Company would gladly do this service for him, 
even for free. 
  In his trip, Darawshah wished to make a political move that 
would seem like a Syrian gesture toward Israel. I am afraid, 
however, that his trick will yield just the opposite result. 
The main Syrian condition was that the delegation be made of 
strictly "our Arab brothers." In other words, al-Asad wants a 
Jew-free delegation. In doing so, he made the same mistake he 
made in Geneva when he prevented the participation of Israeli 
reporters in his joint news conference with President Clinton. 
We said then and we say today: This is no way to win the 
Israelis' hearts. 
  The wise guys will ask: Did you ask to travel to Damascus to 
express condolences? Well, the answer is no. Nevertheless, 
over the past weeks and months, some of the most prominent 
Israeli reporters have asked to be received by him. I told 
Darawshah last week that I am willing to convert to Islam if 
only he promised to take me with him. "Next time perhaps," he 
said with a smile. 
  This, however, is not the point. The point is that not only 
journalists, but also the president of Israel, and mainly the 
prime minister and seniors on his behalf have repeatedly asked 
through every possible channel to meet with al-Asad or his 
trustee to discuss ways to secure peace at the highest possible 
levels. Al-Asad has refused and is refusing even now, after the 
summit with Clinton. He simply does not want, or is unable, to 
make himself stand face to face with Israeli Jews; not even to 
receive the Golan Heights back. 
  He missed opportunities before Geneva; he missed one in 
Geneva; and he is doing it again now. He invited the delegation 
of Israeli Arabs at a very late date (the 40 days of mourning 
are nearly over), under humiliating traveling conditions, 
without Israeli passports, not through the al-Qunaytirah but via 
a third country, and under a series of restrictions on the 
issues they may and may not discuss with him. Even the American 
anti-Semitic clubs have at least one token Jew, for appearance 
sakes. Darawshah's delegation will not even include a symbolic 
Jew. 
  The problem has always been, and still is, al-Asad's lack of 
understanding for the Israeli mentality and psychology. Now, 
when we are conducting peace negotiations and there is a little 
opening of goodwill for concessions on Israel's part, childish 
excuses to talk to al-Asad are not required. In fact, he has a 
standing offer to meet Rabin or a senior envoy on his behalf and 
close a deal on the principles of the nature of the agreement 
they will sign. Al- Asad does not have too much time, and he is 
not as sophisticated as is often believed. If he does not hurry 
up, the status quo will continue and many, perhaps even Rabin, 
will sigh with relief. Instead of using this shortcut, al-Asad 
is wasting valuable time instructing his envoy in Washington not 
to discuss security arrangements or the nature of peace, only 
withdrawal: Pull out first, then we will talk of peace and 
security arrangements. 
  This waste of time is particularly intolerable now, when 
terror against Israelis is becoming more brutal every day. The 
more appalling killings are committed and the more funerals take 
place, the less the public will support making concessions in 
return for peace. We might reach a point at which the Israelis 
will ask themselves: If terror continues despite our 
willingness to give up the territories, why not keep them? 
  The security arrangements and or personal security are the 
magic keys for peace. In this fragile time it is particularly 
important to repel the skepticism that has started crawling into 
our hearts. The ping pong games that led to the breakthrough in 
U.S.-PRC relations do not suit the Middle East pace. It is 
important that a central figure such as al-Asad use big words in 
talking to us. He should flood us with words of peace and with 
gestures. After all, it serves him as well -- we have the 
goods. It is with us, Jews, that he has to make peace, not with 
the Arabs. Darawshah's delegation will make no difference, or 
as Rabin reportedly said: No big deal.

  [Excerpts] Tomorrow the Knesset Internal Affairs Committee 
will discuss the status of Orient House, the PLO's headquarters 
in East Jerusalem. The discussion will be held in the wake of a 
report aired here yesterday, in which the Jerusalem Police chief 
admitted that the building is outside the police responsibility. 
Internal Affairs Committee Chairman Yehoshu'a Matza has invited 
the police minister to tour the building. Our police 
correspondent Moshe Nussbaum reports: 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] A senior Orient House 
element today told us off the record that in recent secret 
contacts with Israeli officials, a clear understanding was 
achieved under which the building was granted an unofficial 
status of an embassy or a consulate. He confirmed that the 
security personnel had been ordered to ban Israeli policemen 
from the building. [end recording] 
  Police Minister Moshe Shahal said in reaction that Orient 
House has no special status, and that the police behave toward 
it as they do any other building.

  [Text] Arab and Druze Likud activists have denied that 
they asked 'Arafat's aide Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi to arrange a visit 
in Tunis. They were reacting to Dr. al-Tibi's remarks that a 
delegation of Israeli Arab Likud supporters is not welcome in 
Tunis, and that 'Arafat is not interested in meeting them. Ayub 
Qara', a member of the Likud's secretariat, told our 
correspondent Yo'el Dar that it was Dr. al-Tibi who approached 
the Druze activists and asked them to hand him names of Likud 
supporters in key positions who would be willing to travel to 
Tunis and help promote the peace process. Qara' said that Arab 
members of the Likud Central Committee want to be a bridge to 
peace and contribute to the ongoing process.

  [Text] A border police undercover unit this evening 
captured an Islamic Jihad fugitive in Gaza city. The man was 
captured when he refused soldiers' orders to stop and tried to 
run over one of the soldiers with his car. 
  In Rafah, a Palestinian was shot by troops and moderately 
wounded. He was part of a group that ran away after refusing 
soldiers' orders to stop. 
  A border police unit in Bethlehem this afternoon discovered 
a 
bomb in Manger Square. The device was safely defused by a 
Border Police sapper. 
  A Tel Aviv Magistrates Court has extended the remand in 
custody by a week of a Ramla resident suspected of handing over 
an Uzi submachine gun to a resident of Rafah. The accused, who 
was also suspected of hiding other weapons near his home, denies 
the allegations. 
  A police officer has been shot near Dimona. He is now 
hospitalized at Soroka Hospital in Beersheba. His condition is 
described as light to moderate. The officer told investigators 
that while he was waiting at a bus stop, a car stopped alongside 
him and three Palestinians attempted to force him into the 
vehicle. He succeeded in fighting them off, but a third man 
shot him in the leg. Security forces are investigating.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Feb (MENA)--The Palestinian and Israeli 
delegations headed by Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Major General Amnon 
Shahaq have announced that their talks in Cairo on 21-23 
February involved constructive work and promoted mutual respect 
and trust. 
  In a joint press statement, the first to be issued on the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations concerning ways to implement 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, the two delegations said they 
discussed three major issues during their committee meetings. 
They discussed the Security Committee, the Civilian Affairs 
Committee, and the Detainees Committee. 
  The statement said that regarding security issues, the two 
delegations focused on security measures in the Gaza Strip and 
the Jericho areas, the planning, size, and deployment of 
Palestinian security forces, and some other related issues. 
  The statement added that the Security Committee discussed 
historical sites, communications, land registration, and civil 
registration. 
  The statement cited the two delegation heads saying they 
were 
satisfied with the progress made during this round and had hopes 
of making further progress at future meetings in Cairo. They 
expressed their gratitude to President Husni Mubarak, the 
Egyptian Government, and the Egyptian people for their warm 
hospitality and their constant assistance to the negotiators. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th, speaking at a news conference following 
the 
statement's release, announced that much was achieved in the 
past two weeks and that only a few issues remain unresolved. He 
said this will need two, or at most three, weeks to complete. 
  Sha'th added that it is difficult to specify a date for the 
prospective meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat 
and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to sign the final 
agreement. He explained that setting a date depends on many 
issues connected with the two men's prior engagements. 
  Sha'th asserted that determining the numbers in the 
Palestinian police force does not pose a problem and will be 
discussed when the issue is submitted to 'Arafat and Rabin. 
  He asserted that the statement issued today has special 
significance because it is the first joint statement about the 
Palestinian-Israeli Gaza-Jericho negotiations. He noted that 
this reflects both sides' commitment to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  Sha'th said the two sides have made progress in connection 
with most of the issues pertaining to the transfer of the 
civilian authority. 
  Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahaq said he totally agrees with Dr. 
Sha'th 
that real progress was made in the past two weeks, noting that 
the two delegations will seek to finalize agreement on other 
issues next week. 
  He asserted that last week's negotiations were useful, 
noting 
that the two sides are now very close to an agreement. 
  Regarding the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, 
Shahaq said: We are negotiating so that the withdrawal will take 
place in line with the agreement between the two parties. The 
withdrawal will not take place unless the negotiations are 
completed. 
  Sha'th said the next round of negotiations in Cairo will 
involve meetings of all the committees, noting that talks are 
also under way to draw up the draft of the general agreement. 
Regarding the Israeli commitment to withdraw from Gaza and 
Jericho by 13 April, Sha'th remarked that this is a very 
important date, adding: We are doing our best to complete the 
negotiations so that the commitment to withdraw on the specified 
date will be fulfilled. 
  Sha'th added that in connection with the Palestinian 
detainees, the Palestinian side is seeking to obtain a general 
amnesty for all former strugglers. 
  On the work of the confidence building committee, Shahaq 
said the committee discussed all the relevant issues, especially 
Palestinian detainees. 
  Sha'th said work during the current round of talks was based 
on maps and agreements were reached on the size of the 
Palestinian police force [as received], the border and the 
vicinity of the Israeli settlements, and security measures on 
roads and at the border. 
  Sha'th said other security points, such as security at sea, 
in the air, on the coast, and on the road between Gaza and 
Jericho remain to be agreed upon during next week's talks. 
  He said agreements on many other daily concerns for 
Palestinians, such as registering the lands of Palestinian 
absentees, state land, historical sites, communications, and 
telecommunications, have been reached. 
  There was also an agreement on a Palestinian radio station, 
a 
television station, and ground contacts with communication 
satellites, Sha'th said. 
  He said all this will allow the Palestinian authority and 
the 
Palestinians, from the beginning of the Palestinian authority, 
to contact Palestinians abroad, the Arab world, and the outside 
world through the radio and television stations. 
  He said the general 15-point agreement, which constitutes a 
preamble for the civilian, security, and other appendices, will 
be finalized and negotiations on the general amnesty agreement 
will be completed. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the Palestinians sensed no Israeli attempt 
to 
obstruct the negotiations. Indeed, he explained, the talks were 
objective and positive. 
  He expressed satisfaction with the progress of the talks 
this 
week and last. He noted that the two sides are working 
seriously to reach an agreement as soon as possible. 
  Sha'th reiterated that the size of Jericho will be 
determined 
in the upcoming meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Shahaq said the release of the Palestinian detainees will 
take place when an agreement is reached. 
  He stressed that those detained after 13 September 1993, the 
day Israel and the PLO signed the Declaration of Principles in 
Washington, will not be released. 
  On the participation of Rabin's policy adviser Ya'qov Neriah 
in the talks, Sha'th said the entire delegation represents Prime 
Minister Rabin, who is responsible for the results of the 
negotiations. Neriah's participation, he said, adds positively 
to the composition of the Israeli delegation. 
  Sha'th stressed the importance of a general amnesty for all 
Palestinian detainees before signing an agreement on the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of </F>
staff and head of the Israeli delegation to the Cairo security 
talks, by Itay Engel in Cairo, Egypt on 24 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Engel] We initially asked Maj. Gen. Shahaq whether 
he could at this point give us an estimated timetable for the 
signing of the agreement. 
  [Shahaq] I do not think I can give you an exact timetable. 
I can only tell you that the talks in the last two weeks have 
been more businesslike and that if they continue at this pace 
and in the same businesslike manner, there is a chance that we 
may soon wrap them up. 
  [Engel] Would you describe the issues still in dispute as 
being mainly technical and marginal -- as other members of the 
delegation described them this morning -- or are they matters of 
substance which may only be concluded after a summit meeting 
between Rabin and 'Arafat? 
  [Shahaq] I would say that they are both. What we consider 
matters of substance may be perceived by the other side as being 
less important or vice versa. In my opinion, some of the 
pending issues may be termed matters of substance, while others 
are technical issues. Therefore, I think quite a lot of work 
remains before we reach an agreement. 
  [Engel] We understand that one of the disputed issues is the 
release of security prisoners. Is there a timetable for their 
release and is it an inevitable phase? Will it include members 
of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and other rejectionist 
organizations? 
  [Shahaq] There is as yet no timetable for the release of 
prisoners, which is part of a broader issue known as 
confidence-building measures. In this context, we will have to 
deal with other issues, and not just the question of the 
Palestinian prisoners. There is no doubt that the issue of the 
prisoners is an important and painful matter to the Palestinian 
side which would like to reach an agreement on the matter. We 
will try to reach an agreement on this matter, too. 
  There is as yet no agreement about a timetable or the number 
of prisoners to be released. For example, we set several 
criteria which we will have to discuss. According to this 
criteria, anybody who engaged in terror after 13 September 1993, 
the day the agreement was signed in Washington, will not be 
included in such an agreement. Members of Hamas will not be 
included either, because they are opposed to the peace process 
and constitute an opposition to the Palestinians we are sitting 
with, and because they continue to murder people and to declare 
that they will go on doing so. Therefore, as long as there is no 
change in this issue, the entire question of the prisoners will 
not be concluded. 
  [Engel] Will we, at least in the first stage, make a 
one-sided gesture of releasing prisoners? 
  [Shahaq] Even if such a gesture is made, it will have 
nothing to do with the negotiations. The negotiations about the 
release of prisoners are not yet over. To repeat, I believe the 
moment an understanding is reached it will be publicized. 
  [Engel] Could you point to any progress with regard to the 
whereabouts of Israel's MIA's? 
  [Shahaq] We do not directly deal with this issue in the 
negotiations, but the fate of Israel's MIA's has come up and the 
matter is being dealt with. On this issue, too, I cannot point 
to any spectacular news. However, we will not let go of it, 
either within or outside the negotiations until we attain some 
results. 
  [Engel] Sir, thank you very much and have a nice day.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hasan 'Asfur, deputy head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks by Sa'id 
Mu'addi; in Cairo, Egypt; date not given; from the "With the 
Events" feature--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Hasan 'Asfur from Cairo: A joint 
statement was issued today after the end of negotiations between 
the Israeli and Palestinian delegations. What was the content 
of the statement? 
  ['Asfur] The statement refers to the nature of the 
atmosphere 
prevailing at the negotiations. The atmosphere was 
constructive, positive, and practical. The negotiations were 
fruitful, and we achieved progress on three issues; namely, 
civilian issues, security issues, and confidence building 
measures. In fact, we have achieved progress, and both sides 
are satisfied with it and hope it will open the way for major 
progress next week. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Hasan, what are the outstanding issues of 
disagreement? 
  ['Asfur] There are several issues over which we have not yet 
reached any agreement, including some security and civilian 
issues and confidence-building measures. We hope that next 
week's negotiations will achieve more progress on these issues. 
  [Mu'addi] What about the Palestinian police? Have you 
reached any agreement on it? 
  ['Asfur] No, we have not yet reached any agreement. The size 
of this police force and the type of weapons it will use are 
still under discussion. 
  [Mu'addi] What about efforts to release Palestinian 
prisoners? 
  ['Asfur] There is serious and continuing discussion of this 
issue, and I believe that matters are moving in the right 
direction. 
  [Mu'addi] Have there been contacts since the press statement 
about holding a summit meeting between Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo next week? 
  ['Asfur] Negotiations will resume in Cairo next week on 
Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area, and we 
hope a meeting will take place between President 'Arafat and 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin when both deem it necessary. 
  [Mu'addi] Do you believe that all issues will be discussed 
next week? 
  ['Asfur] It is difficult to fix such a date, but we believe 
that matters are moving in the right direction. We hope we will 
reach an agreement within a short time, before the blessed 'Id 
al-Fitr, that will please our people and both sides.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Allam: "Sha'th Tells AL-HAYAH: No </F>
Intelligence Agreement With Israel"] 
  [Text] Cairo -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the Taba negotiations, has stated that there is no 
cooperation agreement between the intelligence organs of the PLO 
and Israel. He emphasized that "there was no agreement of that 
kind" during last week's Taba negotiations. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH, he said that the agreement on 
coordination in military and security affairs was about means of 
preventing friction between the Israeli and Palestinian police 
forces and promoting the appropriate mechanism for that. He 
added: "That is a military-security agreement 100 percent and 
has nothing whasoever to do with intelligence or exchange of 
information. There is a big difference."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political </F>
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the negotiations with Israel, by 
Muhammad 'Allam in Cairo, Egypt; date not given] 
  [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to the 
Palestinian president and head of the Palestinian delegation to 
the negotiations with Israel on the implementation of the 
autonomy agreement, has stated that the Palestinians are trying 
to halt the drive of certain Arab parties toward discussion of 
joint projects with Israel. He revealed that, at President 
Yasir 'Arafat's request, African leader Nelson Mandela agreed 
not to visit Israel before the emergence of the Palestinian 
national authority. He stressed the importance of the boycott 
card to the Palestinian negotiators. 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Sha'th said that it would not 
be proper for the Israeli Labor Party to offer the Palestinian 
less than what Likud offered for peace with Egypt. He stressed 
that four categories now have the right to return. They are the 
1967 refugees, investors, officers and soldiers, and members of 
the national authority in the family reunion framework. He also 
confirmed that the PLO is in favor of a general amnesty for 
collaborators with the occupation authorities "with the 
exception of those who have killed Palestinians." 
  Sha'th warned against Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 
backtracking from the commitment to the dates for the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles. He also said 
that "the Israeli Army's assumption of responsibility for the 
negotiations does not necessarily mean obstructing these 
negotiations." 
  On this week's negotiation agenda, Sha'th said: "The 
negotiators will complete discussion of the security procedures 
for Gaza and Jericho, particularly in relation to the coast, the 
air, and the sea." He said he does not expect the discussion of 
these procedures to last "longer than this week, and that 
includes agreement on the security corridor between Gaza and 
Jericho." 
  He added that "what is required during this round is that we 
should have a final draft agreement and the text pertaining to 
the presence of UN forces." He said that the water issue will 
be discussed by the committee responsible for the transfer of 
civilian authority on Thursday [24 February] following the 
completion last week of the discussions of issues related to 
antiquities, state land, and regional planning. Discussion of 
the issues of the detainees in the context of a document of 
general amnesty for the Palestinian detainees will also be 
resumed, he added. He also said: "We will spend two nights 
drafting the final agreement, but it will only be complete next 
week, at the end of which President 'Arafat and Rabin will 
supposedly be invited to resolve six pending issues and then 
sign the final agreement." 
  Sha'th said that Rado Meister, head of the International Red 
Cross Commission in Israel and the occupied territory, handed 
him in Taba last week a list containing the number of registered 
detainees based on the latest statistics, totaling 9,400 
detainees. 
  Sha'th cautioned that despite the expectations "it is 
difficult to give a specific date for the signing because of 
certain issues, some related and some not related to the 
agreement." They include "the continuous Israeli attempts to 
pit the Israeli-Syrian track against the Israeli-Palestinian 
track and delay one on account of the other," and they also 
include "exploitation of the internal situation in Israel and 
Rabin's attempts to exert pressure for retreat from what is 
known as the sacred dates." 
  Sha'th said that one "should beware of Rabin's attempts to 
waive the commitment on dates" because "the sanctity of the 
dates, as opposed to lack of it, is one of the most important 
positive aspects of the Oslo agreement. By that I mean the fact 
that there is a specific timetable for each step." 
  Giving his explanation of the fact that the Palestinian side 
has recently been speaking of positive developments in the 
negotiations despite the fears resulting from the Israeli Army's 
interference in the negotiation process, Sha'th said that "it is 
partly a question of who is negotiating.... The army does not 
necessarily always obstruct, but the Israeli Army wanted to have 
control of the negotiating process." 
  He added: "When civilians conduct the negotiations, the army 
obstructs the process and when (Shim'on) Peres negotiates, Rabin 
obstructs...but, ultimately, all the Israeli parties, with the 
exception of the right-wing hardliners and some Likud leaders, 
want a solution because peace is more in the interest of Israel 
than it is in the interest of the Palestinians although peace is 
more urgent for us." He added that when "one party takes charge 
of the negotiations it tries to make progress, contrary to its 
predecessor." 
  On the question of Rabin linking the issue of the release of 
detainees to an amnesty for agents or "collaborators" and their 
absorption in Palestinian society, Sha'th said that "the PLO is 
not less formidable than Hamas, which has opened the way for the 
collaborators to join it..., because we should give everyone who 
collaborated with the Israelis under pressure and terrorization 
a chance, with the exception of the collaborators who committed 
murder crimes against Palestinian citizens, for as Israel made 
all the strugglers accountable for every killing operation even 
though that was legitimate resistance, the least we can do is 
make the collaborators accountable for their crims." 
  Sha'th emphasized that "the PLO is not against a general 
amnesty for all those who made mistakes, so they can return and 
participate in building their homeland." 
  He revealed that, in Rabin's view, the general amnesty 
should 
cover the Israeli soldiers who opened fire on Palestinians 
without orders. He pointed out that the target "is an amnesty 
for all the Palestinians and Israelis who took part in battles." 
  On the Arab League's announcement that the question of 
ending 
the third-degree Arab boycott of companies dealing with Israel 
would be raised at the Arab League Council's meeting on 27 
March, Sha'th criticized the calls for an end to the boycott and 
emphasized that "we should not pay a price to the Israelis in 
advance because they charge us for every centimeter, every line, 
and every word. Everything should be taken into account." 
  He added: "There can be no naivete in politics. Some say we 
should concede to the Israelis and God will reward us." Sha'th 
proposed "a timetable for comprehensive peace, similar to the 
interim timetable for negotiations on the Palestinian-Israeli 
track." 
  Asked if the PLO has held consultations with some Arab 
parties to halt their drive toward discussion of joint projects 
with Israel, Sha'th disclosed that there have been "Palestinian 
efforts on that matter." He added that "African leader Nelson 
Mandela responded to a request by President 'Arafat -- during 
their meeting in the Netherlands last week -- not to accept an 
invitation to visit Israel until after the establishment of the 
Palestinian national authority." He continued: "If Mandela has 
responded it is even more appropriate that the Arab brothers 
should respond." 
  On Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' statements about 
not allowing the Palestinians in the diaspora to return and 
whether that matter was raised in the negotiations, Sha'th said: 
"Any Palestinian in the diaspora who decides to go to Gaza or 
Jericho is entitled to an entry visa from the national authority 
which can be extended to any period under one year..., and any 
Palestinian in the diaspora who wants a permanent residence can 
now have that in the context of family reunion, and that covers 
investors, officers and soldiers, members of the national 
authority, and everyone who has been out of the country since 
1967." 
  He added: "The Palestinians in the diaspora since 1948 who 
do not fall under the aforementioned categories are now entitled 
to visit, but the question of full repatriation for them will be 
resolved when the refugee problem is solved." 
  On 'Arafat's assertion, before the signing of the Cairo 
agreement, that "Palestine is back on the map," and whether that 
reflects a conviction that the agreement was the first step 
toward a Palestinian state, Sha'th said: "There can be no 
solution without a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its 
capital..., and there is no such thing as comprehensive and 
durable peace without Israeli withdrawal from every inch 
occupied in 1967.... The Egyptians fought six years for every 
last inch of Taba, where we are holding our negotiations, and 
did not leave a single settler on that territory." 
  He added: "Likud accepted that. So the Labor Party should 
not offer us anything less than Likud did." He continued: 
"Every current step is a step toward a state, but everything at 
the appropriate time and stage."

  [Text] The economic talks between Israel and the PLO in 
Paris have run into a stalemate. In their meeting last night, 
Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and PLO representative 
Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] failed to overcome the disagreements 
between the sides. Our correspondent Yo'av Tocker reports that 
the meeting lasted five hours ending without results. The main 
dispute concerns the issue of joint customs duties to be levied 
by Israel and the autonomy.

  [Text] The Palestinian Popular Struggle Front [PPSF] issued 
a statement yesterday in which it said: Since the signing of the 
Declaration of Principles [DOP], Israel has pursued a policy of 
procrastination on all the negotiating tracks and has continued 
to ignore our legitimate rights, stipulated by international 
charters and resolutions. Furthermore, it has backed down from 
what it agreed on in the DOP. As far as Rabin and his 
negotiating teams are concerned, dates are no longer firm nor 
sacred. Withdrawal has become a redeployment of Israeli forces, 
settlements require military protection and safe roads protected 
by the Israeli Army, and so forth. 
  In fact, this Israeli policy has relied on the absence of 
Arab-Palestinian coordination and is trying to deal with the 
Palestinian side unilaterally. It has also relied on the PLO's 
internal conflicts, bad planning, lack of a negotiating 
authority, and confusion between overt and covert negotiations. 
This has caused the cancellation of many national constants and 
the suspension of others to an unspecified date. The security 
agreement is the best evidence of this. 
  This stage, in which the Israeli tactic coincides with the 
policy of economic siege and inhibiting our people, prompts us 
to reassess our support for the political process and to review 
all its aspects as having been planned and not spontaneous. The 
decision to seal the occupied territories, bar Palestinian 
workers from earning their livelihood, accelerate land 
confiscation, boycott Palestinian agricultural products and 
prevent their export, increase roadblocks, intensify tax 
collection campaigns, and close off Jerusalem -- all these are 
just an economic war. This war has been abetted by some Arab 
states which have not only cut off financial aid to our people 
in their distress, but have also refused to transfer funds 
donated by our sons working in those states. We exclude the 
Libyan Jamahiriyah and Iraq because they have been subjected to 
an international blockade. 
  Because of the perils that this stage holds for the cause 
and 
struggles of our people, the PPSF, which supported the PLO in 
the peace process, believes that the peace process has deviated 
from its track and has canceled many agreed on national 
constants. The PPSF affirms that its consent was conditional on 
preserving the national constants and improving the Palestinian 
negotiating performance. But what has happened in the security 
agreement signed in Cairo indicates that the situation is 
becoming worse and that Israel is blackmailing the Palestinian 
negotiators. Therefore, the PPSF demands the following: 
  1. That the Palestine Central Council be convened to review 
every agreement that is signed and send its recommendations to 
the Palestine National Council [PNC]. 
  2. That the PNC be convened to review all agreements that 
have been signed and either approve, amend, or reject those 
agreements on democratic bases. 
  3. That a negotiating authority be formed to determine all 
constants and lines that must not be overstepped by any 
negotiator. 
  4. The release of Palestinian prisoners before any new 
agreement. 
  If, however, the current approach continues, the PPSF will 
reassess its stance toward the entire peace process.

  [Text] Kabul, Feb 23 (AFP) -- A mob of Afghan demonstrators 
attacked the embassy of Pakistan here late Wednesday, badly beat 
several Pakistani employees, smashed windows and furniture and 
burned the Pakistani flag in the street. 
  Security forces were slow in responding to what started as a 
peaceful march to the downtown embassy, where demonstrators 
wanted to protest the killing of three of their countrymen at 
the Afghan embassy in Islamabad. 
  Two badly beaten and bleeding Pakistani staffers narrowly 
escaped a lynching when they were dragged outside by the enraged 
crowd. Another beaten man and two physically unhurt but severely 
shocked staffers were escorted out of the building after the 
arrival of security forces. 
  On arrival the demonstrators, after yelling insults at the 
embassy, quickly became emboldened and began throwing rocks at 
windows, then wrenched the brass name-plaque from the embassy 
wall and smashed it. 
  Soon after a wild stream of Afghans began climbing the 
sandbags lining the embassy walls for protection against 
incoming artillery, and began sacking the premises. 
  "The Pakistanis disgraced our embassy in Islamabad. This is 
our response," one demonstrator told AFP. 
  "We are determined to have our revenge for our three killed 
countrymen," another of the furious demonstrators added. 
  Three Afghan gunmen, who held children hostage in the Afghan 
embassy in Islamabad, were killed Monday when Pakistani 
commandos assaulted the diplomatic compound.

  [Text] Despite a reduction in the intensity of fighting 
between forces loyal to the Afghan president and prime minister 
in Kabul, exchanges of fire were witnessed at points of contact 
between these forces during the last 24 hours. 
  According to the report of the central news unit from Kabul, 
the forces opposed to the president claimed today that they had 
dispatched hundreds of fresh forces to the battle fronts in the 
south of Kabul. Meanwhile, on the eighth week after the start 
of the clashes, the forces loyal to the president still control 
all the major government centers in the capital and have 
prevented the penetration of their opponents to the central 
parts of Kabul. 
  On the other hand, on the eve of the arrival of Pakistan's 
foreign minister in Kabul, Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami has 
expressed its readiness to declare another temporary cease-fire. 
  According to the reports from the north of Afghanistan, the 
central parts of Kondoz province have been the scenes of intense 
fighting between the forces loyal to the president and the 
forces of General Dostum. Kondoz Province, which is under the 
control of the forces loyal to the president, enjoys an 
important strategic position in the north of Afghanistan, near 
Tajikistan. 
  On the other hand, the central council of Hezb-e Wahdat-e 
Eslami [Islamic Unity Party], in a session convened recently in 
order to investigate the political and military developments in 
Afghanistan, once again declared its neutrality in the current 
war in that country.

  [Text] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that the 
attack on Pakistan's Embassy in Kabul and the initimidation and 
beating of the embassy staff is regrettable, although Pakistan 
is extending all possible assistance to the Afghan people on 
humanitarian grounds. She was talking to newsmen early this 
morning at Islamabad Airport on her return from Saudi Arabia 
after performing a minor pilgrimage there. She was referring to 
a mob of Afghan demonstrators who attacked the Pakistani Embassy 
in Kabul, smashed windows and furniture, and intimidated and 
beat the embassy staff. The prime minister said Pakistan has 
sheltered three million Afghan refugees for more than 10 years 
and even now a large number of the refugees are present in the 
country. She said Pakistan has set up camps at Jalalabad in 
Afghanistan where displaced persons from Kabul are being 
provided relief. Benazir Bhutto said she is deeply saddened by 
the incident. 
  About the rescue of school children who were taken hostage 
by 
three armed Afghan gunmen, the prime minister said she is happy 
that they were safely rescued. She commended the Pakistan Army 
commandos and their timely and safe action for safely rescuing 
the children. Ms. Benazir Bhutto also welcomed Afghan President 
Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani's statement in which he condemned 
the kidnapping. 
  Pakistan has expressed regrets over the attack on its 
embassy 
in Kabul and has protested with the Afghan Government about this 
incident. Immediately after hearing the report about the attack 
by an agitated mob on Pakistan's Embassy in Kabul, Foreign 
Secretary Shaharyar Khan summoned Afghan Ambassador Sardar 
Roshan to the Foreign Office. The foreign secretary lodged a 
protest of the Pakistan Government with him on this regrettable 
incident which is a matter of deep concern. The Afghan 
ambassador was asked to tell his government to take all possible 
steps to ensure the security of the embassy and its staff. The 
Afghan ambassador was also asked to immediately provide full 
details of the incident and about the well being of the Pakistan 
Embassy staff. The Afghan ambassador was told that the incident 
is especially condemnable because it took place during the 
Pakistan foreign minister's visit to Kabul in connection with 
the establishment of peace in Afghanistan. The Pakistan 
Government is surprised at such a reaction in Kabul in support 
of a criminal act in which three criminals kidnapped innocent 
children at gunpoint.

  [Text] Formal talks between Pakistan and China were held in 
Islamabad today. The talks covered a wide range of bilateral 
relations and international and regional issues. The Chinese 
side was led by Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Mr. 
Qian Qichen and Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali headed 
the Pakistan delegation. The Kashmir dispute came under 
detailed discussion. Both sides expressed their concern over the 
gross human rights violations in Indian-held Kashmir and were of 
the opinion that tension in the region would further escalate if 
a peaceful solution to the problem is not found. Foreign 
Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali drew the attention of his Chinese 
counterpart to the persistent violations of human rights in the 
occupied valley. He said because of the recalcitrant attitude 
of India, the foreign secretaries talks could not make any 
progress. He said Pakistan would be willing to hold talks with 
India only if they were ready to improve the human rights 
situation in Kashmir. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali apprised Mr. Qian 
of the rationale behind the tabling of the resolution at the 
current session of the commission of human rights. He said the 
resolution only requested sending a fact-finding mission to the 
Indian-held Kashmir. The Chinese vice premier said Pakistan and 
China should closely coordinate on the Kashmir issue. 
  On the question of trade imbalances, China and Pakistan 
agreed that efforts should be made to rectify the adverse trade 
balance against Pakistan. Experts of the two countries would 
consult each other in this regard. 
  In-depth discussions were also held on issues concerning 
security in South Asia and nuclear nonproliferation. China 
appreciated Pakistan's principled position on the question of 
nuclear nonproliferation. The vice premier underlined the need 
for close coordination between China and Pakistan on issues 
relating to regional security. 
  The Chinese vice premier and foreign minister called on the 
chairman, Senate, Mr. Wasim Sajjad, in Islamabad today. The 
chairman, Senate, briefed the Chinese vice premier about 
Pakistan's principled stand on Kashmir and the nuclear 
nonproliferation issue. He said it would be quite unreasonable 
to sign any nonproliferation treaty unilaterally when India has 
a huge nuclear arms buildup. He said Kashmir problem should be 
resolved through implementation of UN resolutions. 
  Mr. Qian Qichen also called on the speaker, National 
Assembly, Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani, in Islamabad today. The 
speaker expressed satisfaction over the traditional and 
time-tested friendship between Pakistan and China. The Chinese 
vice premier extended an invitation to the speaker, National 
Assembly, to visit China at the head of a parliamentary 
delegation.

separate meetings with Senate Chairman Wasim Sajjad and National

  The Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker 
explained the latest position regarding human rights violations 
in occupied Kashmir. While referring to Pakistan's efforts to 
move a resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission on this, 
they reiterated Pakistan's commitment to a peaceful solution of 
the Kashmir issue. 
  Referring to the Indian press reports on the implications of 
the disengagement of troops at the Sino-Indian border, Qian 
Qichen said the Indian news agencies are indulging in propaganda 
tactics in this matter. He said China will not allow a 
situation in which India can take advantage of Pakistan.

  [Text] Karachi -- Leader of the Opposition in National 
Assembly Nawaz Sharif feared that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
was helping the Indian Government in crushing Kashmiri freedom 
movement like she did in the past during Sikh freedom movement. 
  Addressing a press conference on Tuesday at a local hotel, 
he 
said that Indian oppression in Kashmir had risen to alarming 
proportion during the last three months and Indian forces even 
penetrated in the Sopore area which was known to be the fort of 
the freedom fighters. 
  He said that Indian attacks on exact target showed that 
Indian forces got specific information. 
  Keeping in view the prevailing situation and the prime 
minister's recent `confession' regarding her help to Rajiv 
Gandhi to crush the Sikh movement in the East Punjab, one could 
suspect that she was also helping the present Indian government 
in connection with the freedom movement in Kashmir, Nawaz 
alleged. 
  Nawaz Sharif has charged that the prime minister was 'a 
security risk' for Pakistan. "Following the confession of the 
prime minister in a BBC interview last week that she helped 
former Indian premier late Rajiv Gandhi against the Sikh 
movement in the Indian Punjab, she has become a security risk 
for the country" he said. 
  Nawaz Sharif said the prime minister must make her position 
clear to the nation in this matter as it was more serious an 
issue than the Watergate affair. He said the cause of Pakistan 
has been compromised by the prime minister. 
  The PML-N [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz] chief said that 
India never helped Pakistan in our hours of need nor it 
fulfilled promises made to the Kashmiri people. In fact India 
was responsible for the dismemberment of Pakistan in 1971. 
Moreover, Indian intelligence agency RAW [Research and Analysis 
Wing] has been working to weaken Pakistan, he added. 
  He said that prime minister has been sidetracking the main 
issue and did not answered the questions asked in his February 
19 letter to her. 
  He questioned as to which principle made it binding for 
Pakistan to help its enemy and added that those who demolished 
Babri Mosque deserved no help. 
  "I will take her to the court of the people," said Nawaz. 
  Replying to a question whether he would bring all these 
things into the notice of the president and the chief of army 
staff he said that he would keep on playing his national, 
constitutional, legal and moral duty. 
  He said that his party would consider withdrawing its 
members 
from the Kashmir Committee of the National Assembly keeping in 
view the "government's lukewarm attitude over the issue." He 
said he would strive for protecting the interests of the country 
and would not hesitate in taking any legal and constitutional 
step towards this end.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Are India and Pakistan on the Same Plane?"] </F>
  [Text] Robin Raphel, the U.S. assistant secretary of state, 
was rebuked by a number of prominent senators when she explained 
the Clinton administration's South Asia policy to a Senate 
Foreign Relations subcommittee. Republican Senator Hank Brown 
asked: What kind of policy disappoints all the parties and 
makes everyone America's enemy? He did not stop there. Moving 
a little further, he reminded the assistant secretary of the old 
saying that sometimes, depending on the situation, it is better 
to keep quiet. 
  Valuable advice indeed, although it is easy to see that it 
is 
just as difficult for a member of Congress to heed this advise 
as it is for a government spokesman. Even the head of the 
administration that Robin Raphel represents does not think it is 
necessary to be cautious. He freely expresses whatever comes 
into his mind, sometimes even in writing. Given this situation, 
why should a bureaucrat like Mrs. Raphel restrain herself when 
making statements? Mr. Brown's advice to Mrs. Raphel to bridle 
her statements came in the context of her 26 October remarks on 
Kashmir. Undoubtedly, it was not a casual statement. Rather, 
subsequent government statements and behavior have made it clear 
that the new U.S. Administration wants to pursue a tougher 
policy toward India. It was because of his weakness for India 
that Daniel Patrick Moynihan, despite being a Democrat, opted to 
criticize Mrs. Raphel and the present Democratic administration. 
Moynihan's upcoming visit to India is said to be of special 
significance to both Washington and New Delhi. This is natural, 
but the question is whether former Ambassador Moynihan can 
assure India during his visit that the United States will stop 
playing the game of persistently harassing India. 
  There is no question that the Bush administration's stand -- 
that a solution to the Kashmir problem should be found under the 
Simla Agreement; that is, through bilateral negotiations between 
India and Pakistan -- has been abandoned. The impression is 
taking hold that Washington wants to place greater importance on 
the fictitious or exaggerated stories of human rights violations 
by Indian troops in Kashmir, while ignoring Pakistani support 
for terrorism and playing down the grisly acts being committed 
by terrorists throughout the Kashmir Valley. 
  It may be of no interest in Washington whether or not New 
Delhi likes the declaration that the United States wants to view 
India and Pakistan from the same perspective on issue of the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It is natural not to consider 
external opinions when formulating a country's policy. One 
should wonder, however, if India is perturbed by the excessive 
interest being shown by the present U.S. Administration in 
releasing Islamabad from the purview of the Pressler Amendment. 
The U.S. Administration's attempts to do away with the Pressler 
Amendment have been temporarily abandoned. It is no secret, 
however, that this was not for lack of trying. The move was 
shelved after the extent of Congressional opposition became 
clear. Political experts do not hesitate to make substantial 
sacrifices whenever they face danger, although they are never 
sincere in making such sacrifices. It is difficult to say what 
objective will be achieved by placing India and Pakistan on the 
same level. This is better known by Robin Raphel, Lynne Davis, 
and others. The U.S. Administration's eagerness to abrogate the 
Pressler Amendment, though, makes us fear that the pro-Pakistan 
advisers scattered throughout the U.S. Administration are trying 
to find ways to satisfy Pakistan's appetite for arms. Perhaps 
this fear is unfounded, or perhaps the U.S. Administration has 
realized its folly; how the whole region was disrupted in the 
past when Pakistan was armed against the invasion of communism. 
But is South Asia that lucky? The person who has the 
experience of past suffering will naturally be alarmed by the 
slightest indication of danger.

<F P=106> [Article by Akhtar Majeed, director of the Centre for </F>
Strategic Studies at Aligarh: "A Nuclear Brahmacharya"] 
  [Text] The joint US-Russian declaration on nuclear issues, 
signed last month in Moscow, is the continuation of the old 
Western policy advocating the indefinite and unconditional 
extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in the present 
form. The US and Russia have called upon India and Pakistan to 
join a multilateral forum for arms control. 
  It was obvious at the time of the signing of the NPT that 
the 
spread of nuclear weapons would ultimately facilitate it for the 
sponsors to claim a tremendous success and advocate its 
extension. Flaws were pointed out by India then. It is a proof 
of the abject failure of the conduct of Indian diplomacy that 
while almost all the Indian proposals for nuclear disarmament 
have been subsequently accepted by the world community, the 
latter has now pleaded with India to accept those proposals! 
In South Asia, there is a situation of nuclear asymmetry, with 
an advanced nuclear capable China on one side and acquisition of 
nuclear weapon capability by Pakistan, on the other. This 
asymmetry is not conducive to regional stability. If strategic 
deterrence is to be achieved, in view of the on-going missile 
proliferation around India, then again, acquisition of nuclear 
weapon capability seems the only viable option. There is an 
essential universality of nuclear deterrence logic and it is as 
true for India and Pakistan as it was for the USA and USSR. If 
nuclear deterrence sustained peace in the developed world, even 
during the Cold War, it would sustain peace and stability in 
South Asia after the Cold War. The objective of the nuclear 
policy followed by India and Pakistan is to make certain that 
there is no direct nuclear threat without them being able to 
retaliate. During the Cold War, each had the strategic support 
of a superpower. Now in the absence of earlier assurances there 
is a need that can only be fulfilled by an overt nuclear 
stability in the region. Since wars in South Asia have mostly 
been caused by misconceptions about relative strength, there 
would be greater stability once such misconceptions are removed, 
generating the logic of deterrence peculiar to nuclear weapons. 
  It should be obvious to the Government of India that if it 
did not change its policy of nuclear abstinence, it would face a 
highly inimical asymmetrical predicament vis-a-vis Pakistan. In 
fact, our nuclear disarmament effort is a convenient and 
self-defeating myth. The continued nuclear brahmacharya 
[celibacy] of India is bound to force the rest of South Asia, 
China and the USA to re-evaluate their attitude towards India, 
and that re-evaluation would not be in our favour. If calculated 
meaningful ambiguity is taken for bluff then the force of 
deterrence is lost. The tact that the ambiguity was an 
emasculated one was evident from the lack of any sufficient 
technology effort to use any mythical "bombs in the basement" in 
the event of any nuclear attack by, say, Pakistan. 
  The very talk of `minimum deterrence' highlights our 
confused 
perception of the dimensions of the nuclear war. Security 
involves the capability to absorb the full intensity of a 
nuclear attack and the retaliatory ability to inflict 
unacceptable damage on the enemy. That is true deterrence and it 
is credible only if the enemy understands, not the bland 
assurances that we will be able to "retaliate at short notice 
when the need arises". 
  Once the nuclear status of India and Pakistan is understood 
and acknowledged mutual deterrence would make it possible for 
confidence building measures to evolve on a mutually agreed 
basis. After possessing a minimum deterrent capability and 
survivable delivery system, it would not be necessary, at least 
for India, to enter into a nuclear arms race. Since deterrence 
would be the objective, and not the accumulation of a large 
arsenal, a South Asian nuclear arm race would not be needed. The 
proposal of nuclear free South Asia is not in conformity with 
the prevailing realities, and what we can do is to attempt to 
create a nuclear weapons-safe South Asia. Mutual arms reductions 
and confidence building can be at tempted once nuclear stability 
is reached in South Asia. 
  There is a deliberate Western policy to project an 
exaggerated over-nuclearised scenario in South Asia where 
tactical nuclear weapons are integrated even in routine military 
exercises. Therefore, a need to maintain `nuclear restraint' 
while trying to save the situation through regional arms control 
measures [sentence as published]. The Seymor Hersh article, in 
the NEW YORKER, was one such plant about events in 1990 that 
supposedly almost led to a nuclear war between the two 
countries. But this policy has to be viewed in the light of what 
happened with the much-publicised Indo-Russian cryogenic engine 
deal. More than the concerns about non-proliferation, and 
potential uses of the rocket, it was a message to India that it 
would be impossible to operate independently of the USA as far 
as proliferation is concerned; and it would not be possible for 
the Russians to rescue India, like in the past. One flaw in this 
approach is the continuing and wishful habit of treating India 
and Pakistan at par. Any parity, if it has to be calculated at 
all, can only be between India and China. With the prevalence of 
the India-Pakistan one, formulations of the Cold War era are 
again dominating South Asia. 
  Closed-door `clubs' and `regimes' intending to impose 
unilateral sanctions and restrictions on technology in a 
discriminatory manner cannot prevent proliferation. Neither is 
this possible only through the arms-reduction approach. The 
Missile Technology Control Regime has not been as effective a 
deterrent as it is claimed. Pakistan's missile programme has not 
suffered, for example. As China pointed out in October 1993, 
"conditional moratorium designed to maintain nuclear superiority 
while refusing to renounce nuclear deterrence and commit 
ourselves to complete prohibition and thorough destruction of 
nuclear weapons is of no significance" . 
  There has been talk that while India may not sign the NPT, 
it 
will unilaterally give an assurance to abide by its provisions. 
Obviously, such proposals have not taken into consideration the 
ineffectiveness of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
verifications as far as clandestine diversions are concerned. We 
know too well about Israel, South Africa, Iraq, Pakistan and 
North Korea. 
  Since the objective of our nuclear policy is no longer 
valid, 
continuation with ambivalence would serve no purpose. Merely 
reiterating that India would hot be the first one to introduce 
nuclear weapons in the region cannot take the place of a 
definite policy option. That is possible if steps are taken to 
trade off costly conventional forces for nuclear capability 
while simultaneously pursuing regional confidence building 
measures. This would not only lower the risk factors but reduce 
the danger of the use of nuclear weapons, by design or accident.

  [Text] The government will continue to urge Pakistan at 
every available opportunity to stop its support to subversion 
and terrorism directed against India. The minister of state for 
external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, informed the Rajya Sabha in a 
written reply that New Delhi has apprised the international 
community of Pakistan's role in these activities. He termed 
this approach by Pakistan as totally unacceptable and in 
violation of the Simla agreement and universally accepted norms 
of international conduct. 
  The Lok Sabha was told that there has been an increase in 
firings by the Pakistani troops at Indian posts in the Uri, 
Punch, and Rajaori sectors during the past few months. The 
minister of state for defense, Mr. Mallikarjun, told the house 
in a written reply that all such developments are carefully 
assessed and appropriate and timely steps taken. He told the 
members that our troops are fully prepared to meet any 
eventuality.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ali Dawud from al-Nabatiyah] </F>
  [Text] Tension and anticipation still prevail in the 
liberated villages in the south in the wake of continued Israeli 
aggression, which was renewed today against villages in the 
central sector. The resistance retaliated with an operation 
against a joint patrol along the al-Qantarah-al-Tayyibah road 
this afternoon. 
  The Israeli occupation troops bombarded the hills of 
Qabrikhah, Tulin, al-Tamiriyah, Shaqra, and Wadi al-Saluqi with 
155-mm tank artillery and 120-mm mortars this afternoon. 
Citizen Hasan 'Ali 'Awali was wounded in Tulin and was taken to 
the Tibnin government hospital for treatment. 
  At 1500 today, agent Lahd [South Lebanese Army] positions in 
'Alman and al-Shumariyah bombarded the area surrounding the 
positions with 82-mm mortar fire. this was accompanied by 
machine-gun fire against adjacent forests. 
  According to reports from the occupied border strip, the 
occupation troops have arrested Salim 'Awadah, member of the al- 
Naqurah municipal council; his sons Hasan, Ibrahim, and 'Isam; 
and the latter's wife and took them to the al-Khiyam prison. 
  The Amal Movement and the Islamic Resistance announced in a 
joint statement that their forces attacked a joint patrol along 
the al- Qantarah-al-Tayyibah road at 1345 today. The statement 
said a vehicle was destroyed and its crew members were killed or 
wounded. Lahd's radio later reported the operation but kept 
silent on its losses.

  [Text] The cabinet yesterday discussed three issues that 
have not been announced. The first was the government situation 
and the attempt to reshuffle the cabinet portfolios based on 
certain plans by the president and the prime minister. These 
plans have clashed with calculations by the parliamentary 
speaker, who demanded the Finance Ministry portfolio for his 
sect based on the principle that any reshuffle must aim at 
energizing governmental work and that this can only be done by 
correcting the course of the state's financial policy, which has 
demonstrated its failure and sterility. While agreement between 
the president and the prime minister exists because of the 
indirect concurrence of interests, the sticky issue of 
reshuffling the portfolios persists. It affects the Ministries 
of Finance, Interior, Industry and Oil, and Labor. President 
Ilyas al-Hirawi and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri raised this 
issue during their meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. 
The two returned with a firm response from the Syrian 
leadership that it is ready to assist Lebanon in resolving 
problems in government work, but that a change of government or 
reshuffle is an internal Lebanese matter. Lebanese political 
sources maintain that a government reshuffle is still possible 
but will not be sufficient as the entire government performance 
in the political, economic, and security fields is deficient. 
  The second issue discussed by the cabinet was the high cost 
of living and economic stagnation. This is occurring at a time 
when the dollar rate in the local market has been stable and the 
government claims that the development and reconstruction 
process is continuing. This is casting some doubt on the 
state's financial policy. 
  The third issue was the demands of the General Labor 
Federation. With the federation's demands, a crisis has been 
created for political reasons. Some ministers at yesterday's 
cabinet session maintained that this fabricated crisis 
constitutes a crime against the worker and his livelihood and is 
a dangerous step at this time.

  [Text] Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Na'im Qasim has 
denied reports that there have been contacts with Hizballah 
asking it to decrease its resistance operations. He asserted 
that no one asked them to cut down their operations during the 
Geneva summit. His party does not carry out resistance 
activities based on the negotiations, because "we do not believe 
in these negotiations," Shaykh Qasim said. He pointed out that 
resistance operations are escalated and reduced according to the 
objective situation on the ground, not according to political 
circumstances. 
  As for information coming from within Hizballah about 
preparations for a settlement, Shaykh Qasim clarified that the 
party opposes a settlement in the first place. He said: We are 
betting on its failure. We believe that there are enough 
complications and pressures to hamper many of the steps to a 
settlement. Therefore, Shaykh Qasim continued, the possibility 
of failure is as great as any other possibility.

  [Text] Beirut's Publications Court, meeting under Judge 
'Afif Shams-al-Din, has issued its verdict in the case of 
AL-SAFIR's publication in May of the text of an Israeli proposal 
to the bilateral negotiations with Lebanon. 
  The court ruled that any pursuit of Faysal Salman [the 
newspaper's editing director] and Ibrahim al-Amin [staff writer] 
be stopped for lack of incriminating evidence in accordance with 
Articles 12 and 25 of Law 104/77. The court referred the papers 
to the public prosecutor to take the necessary action. The 
ruling can be appealed. 
  The judge did not announce the ruling during the session. He 
asked those involved in the case to read the ruling in the 
court's office and a court official read it out to the press.

  [Excerpt] Mahmud Muhammad, Egyptian minister of economy and 
foreign trade, arrived in Amman today on a visit aimed at 
reinforcing trade relations between the two fraternal countries. 
  The visit by Mahmud Muhammad, Egyptian minister of economy 
and foreign trade, is meant to reinforce trade and economic 
relations between Jordan and Egypt and to increase commercial 
exchanges between the two fraternal countries. 
  [Begin Muhammad recording] We are here to sign, God willing, 
a protocol after an agreement has been reached on the list of 
Egyptian and Jordanian commodities. As I told you, the aim is 
to reinforce and give momentum to commercial exchanges between 
our two countries. 
  I also want to take this opportunity to say that, God 
willing, I will have the honor of meeting with some officials in 
this fraternal country to exchange views with them, benefit from 
their experience, and inform them of our views on the Egyptian 
experiment. 
  As you know, Egypt went through very successful stages of 
economic transition and reform. It became a model for economic 
reform. We hope that this operation will serve the Egyptian 
people and upgrade the level of economic performance in Egypt.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received 
in his office at the Prime Ministry this morning Mahmud Muhammad 
Mahmud, Egyptian minister of economy and foreign trade. Dr. 
Rima Khalaf, Jordanian minister of industry and trade, and the 
Egyptian ambassador in Amman attended the meeting. Talks dealt 
with ways to boost and upgrade cooperation between the two 
sisterly countries in the commercial and economic fields. 
  Mahmud told reporters he conveyed to the prime minister 
Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi's greetings, adding that the 
meeting was extremely cordial and fruitful. He said talks dealt 
with bilateral trade relations in particular and 
Egyptian-Jordanian ties in general. He added they discussed 
ways to bolster trade exchange and enhance the march of 
rapprochement between the two fraternal peoples--a march that 
needs no confirmation. He said it was agreed to hold the higher 
joint committee meetings immediately after 'Id al-Fitr when an 
Egyptian delegation led by 'Atif Sidqi will arrive in Jordan to 
take part in these talks, which will cover all areas of 
bilateral relations.

  [Text] Egypt and Jordan signed an economic protocol at the 
Ministry of Industry and Commerce today. Minister of Industry 
and Commerce Dr. Rima Khalaf signed for Jordan, while the 
Egyptian minister of economy and foreign trade signed for Egypt. 
  Marwan 'Awad, secretary general of the Ministry of Industry 
and Commerce, spoke to the radio on the provisions contained in 
this protocol, saying: 
  [Begin 'Awad recording] Today, the first protocol to emerge 
from the Egyptian-Jordanian trade exchange agreement was signed. 
This is the first protocol to be signed in the aftermath of the 
trade agreement signed in 1992, which replaced the old agreement 
signed in 1965. According to the protocol signed today, the 
Jordanian and Egyptian sides agreed on two lists of commodities, 
one concerning Egyptian commodities and another concerning 
Jordanian commodities. The products included in these two lists 
will be exempted from customs fees and additional direct fees 
and taxes, with the exception of domestic taxes and fees and 
sales tax. Moreover, the products included in these two lists 
will be exempted from non-customs restrictions. The protocol 
stipulated that except for the products included in the two 
lists, the trade exchange between the two countries will be 
subject to all customs fees and taxes and subsequent fees, 
regardless of the type of the trade transactions entailed. This 
will be in accordance with the legislations in force in both 
countries. 
  The protocol also stipulated that the Jordanian Trade Center 
in Egypt and the Egyptian Trade Center in Jordan will each have 
a share of trade exchange confined to $7 million to be used for 
importing commodities from the other country. Each center will 
be permitted to import its quota of products in accordance with 
the legislations and rules in force in both countries. Payments 
for such transactions will be made in convertible currency.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Oil in Sanctions Wheel"] </F>
  [Text] It is common knowledge by now that whenever Iraq 
gets closer to meeting its obligations under the relevant United 
Nations Security Council resolutions, new conditions spring up 
to frustrate its bid to end the international punitive measures 
against it. The addition of conditions in such cases is called, 
generally in the West, deliberate moving of the goalposts. 
  We have a better term for it: international blackmail. By 
this we mean that there are definite economc reasons behind the 
constant orchestration of new conditions against that Arab 
country. These reasons have roots in the world oil market glut. 
  There are several oil producing countries which would give 
or 
do anything to keep Iraqi oil out of the international market 
for the simple reason that oil prices have dropped considerably 
in the past few years and are hovering now about $16 per barrel. 
Keeping Iraqi oil out of circulation would at least keep the 
already depressed prices where they are. The reintroduction of 
Iraqi petroleum products into the market stands to lower even 
further the current price ranges. The Arab oil producing 
countries alone saw their revenues drop from $180 billion in the 
early eighties to a mere $75 billion in 1993. And what applies 
to the Arab World applies also to other producers from various 
regions of the world. This is a colossal economic crisis, which 
would only be exacerbated by lifting the oil embargo on Baghdad. 
  The Western industrial countries, which count on the 
revenues 
of the oil producing countries to grease their economies by 
selling them more and more aircraft, tanks and guns, have a 
stake in keeping the pockets of these countries full and ready 
enough in order to be able to perform exactly such a task. 
  We would have thought there is a better way to stabilise the 
oil market than by continuing to punish the Iraqi people. 
Sooner or later, Iraqi oil will enter the market. It would be 
wiser and fairer if a global solution could be found for this 
problem based on sound economic considerations for both the 
exporters and importers of this basic commodity. The real issue 
now lies with OPEC countries themselves, which have not been 
able or willing to heed their own agreements. In the long run, 
a more equitable quota system could be applied that could 
satisfy the global economy in a balanced manner. Meanwhile, the 
persistent ostracisation of Iraq by the international community, 
even after it has gone more than 95 per cent of the way to meet 
its obligations, makes little sense besides being totally unfair 
and unjust. Gradual easing of the sanctions against Baghdad 
commensurate with the extent of its fulfilment of its 
international obligations must become the mainstay of the new 
policy towards it instead of the current arbitrary and unethical 
direction being followed now.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 15 February 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H3>  CONTENTS: 
1. Corruption and the Struggle for Democracy </H3>
  2. Writer on Government Corruption 
  3. Opposition Leader on Corruption, Dialogue, Anti-Islam 
Campaign 
  4. Prayers for Bosnians 
  5. Islamic Writer on Significance of Ramadan 
  6. Shaykh al-Ghazali Deplores the Afghan War 
  7. Islamists Win Agronomists Syndicate Elections 
  8. Improving Ties With Israel

<H5>  CORRUPTION AND FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY </H5>
  In its 15 February edition, Cairo AL-SHA'B, the mouthpiece 
of 
the opposition Labor Party, features articles and commentaries 
on corruption in Egypt. In an approximately 2,500-word article 
on pages 1 and 2, Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn notes that 
although everyone in Egypt is aware that corruption is rife, the 
"clique of rulers and those who are up to their ears in 
corruption" denies it. He says that at a time when every case of 
corruption is hushed up, a decision is made to try "the symbol 
of honor and patriotism, Labor Party leader Ibrahim Shukri." 
The rulers cover up corruption cases and put pressure on the 
official newspapers not to report on corruption, he says and 
highlights the recent accusations of corruption exchanged 
between two former interior ministers, noting that they were 
involved in private business during their terms in office in 
violation of the Constitution. He notes that Islamic 
jurisprudence, which some people believe to be backward, bans 
public figures form engaging in private business. He stresses 
that both ministers were in Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's 
cabinet and so Sidqi is "inescapably responsible" for their 
misconduct. He notes that THE WASHINGTON POST, London's THE 
GUARDIAN, and THE TIMES of London report on corruption in Egypt 
but it seems that Sidqi does not read these papers. The author 
stresses that the free press will continue to uncover cases of 
corruption and will struggle until "real democracy" is 
established "in which no one is above the law." 
<H5>  WRITER ON GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION </H5>
  In a 700-word article on page 2 entitled "Corruption and 
Lies 
in the Government," Jamal As'ad claims that corruption in Egypt 
is "rife and exceeds bounds." He maintains that the prime 
minister's statement that the government does not ignore 
corruption is untrue and that anyone who tries to belittle 
corruption cases is "an accomplice and colluding." He notes 
that attempts by senior writers to cover up corruption cases are 
not in Egypt's interests. He says that there is political, 
economic, administrative, moral, artistic, and cultural 
corruption in Egypt. He contends that the People's Assembly is 
"restricted by constitutional clauses" and cannot withdraw 
confidence from any Cabinet minister because this requires the 
president's approval. As'ad notes the recent campaign of 
defamation between two former interior ministers, who were 
supposed to combat corruption, saying that both have been found 
to have made money through corruption. He wonders why their 
file has been closed and why they and the prime minister have 
not been called to account. 
<H3>  OPPOSITION LEADER ON CORRUPTION, DIALOGUE, ANTI-ISLAM 
CAMPAIGN </H3>
  In an approximately 1,500-word report on page 1 and 4 on 
Labor Party leader Shukri and Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad 
al-Sharif's "Ramadan tours" of Egyptian governorates, Jamal 
Imbabi cites Shukri as telling a seminar in al-Mansurah that the 
party "insists on resisting corruption despite the pressure." 
Shukri says successive interrogations of the Labor Party 
leaders and AL-SHA'B correspondents will "not intimidate us." 
He notes that the government is still postponing the national 
dialogue with the opposition and says the Labor Party called for 
"guarantees to render the dialogue successful." He calls for 
enacting a new constitution. Shukri warns of "the Muslims' 
slumber in confronting the Western onslaught to destroy Islam" 
and warns against "a scheme to 'disunite the Muslims and 
Copts,'" noting Islam's sound stance on the Copts, which 
maintains that they "have the same rights and duties as 
Muslims." Shukri said that following the Cold War, the West 
sees only Islam as "the new enemy that must be destroyed." He 
says that in America, the leader of the Western camp, there are 
those who warn of the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet 
Union and they all fear the Islamic revival. 
  Preacher Muhammad al-Sharif pointed to the dispute between 
the two former interior ministers, saying that the corrupt 
establishments are fighting one another. He said that every day 
that passes paves the road for change and salvation so that 
those who will rule by God's shari'ah will take over. 
  in a 400-word article on page 7, Muhammad al-Murshidi 
suggests that when the government proposed a national dialogue 
with the opposition parties, some opposition leaders believed it 
would be a futile political maneuver to divert the public's 
attention. Others believed that the rulers might have returned 
to their senses and realized the serious security, political, 
and economic situations. The writer notes that the government 
then repeatedly postponed the date, casting doubts on its 
seriousness about it. The writer notes that Prime Minister 
Sidqi claims he does not cover up corruption, yet he sent 
several AL-SHA'B writers for interrogation just because they 
revealed one aspect of corruption. He says King Husayn of 
Jordan permitted honest elections that allowed fair 
representation of the opposition. The writer goes on: The 
Algerian leaders realized their serious mistake when they 
finished off the democratic experience and realized that the 
only way to emerge form the crisis is to hold a dialogue with 
the opposition and the Islamic Salvation Front. We thought, he 
says, that the Egyptian rulers might learn this lesson. But, he 
stresses, we were surprised to hear President Mubarak say that 
what happened in Jordan and Algeria will not happen in Egypt. 
What is the use of the dialogue with the government, the writer 
wonders. 

<H5>    PRAYERS FOR BOSNIANS </H5>
  In a 100-word report on page 1, Khalid Yunis notes that tens 
of thousands of people performed prayers at al-Azhar Mosque in 
Cairo last Friday over the souls of the Bosnian martyrs killed 
in the criminal bombardment of Sarajevo. The report notes that 
the awqaf minister agreed on the prayers for the martyrs in the 
mosques that belong to the Awqaf Ministry. In his Friday 
sermon, Shaykh Isma'il Sadiq al-'Adawi stressed the significance 
of jihad and willpower for the Islamic nation during Ramadan, 
stressing that the continuation of the Muslims' tragedy in 
Bosnia is due to the international community's "defeatism and 
collusion" and to the failure of the regional, Arab, and Islamic 
organizations to do their duty. 
<H5>  ISLAMIC WRITER ON SIGNIFICANCE OF RAMADAN </H5>
  In a 1,700-word article on page 5, Islamic writer Mustafa 
Mashur welcomes the advent of Ramadan and elaborates on the 
values it signifies for the Muslims. He urges Muslims to unite, 
saying that divisions among Muslims made them victims of the 
enemies of Islam in various parts of the world. He urges 
Muslims to exert serious efforts and to rally in support of 
Muslim brothers and sisters who are exposed to genocide, 
blockades, starvation, and displacement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Palestine, Kashmir, and elsewhere. 
<H5>  SHAYKH MUHAMMAD AL-GHAZALI DEPLORES THE AFGHAN WAR </H5>
  In a 300-word article by famous Islamic preacher Shaykh 
Muhammad al-Ghazali, he assails those who seek personal 
interests and those who don the garb of Islam although they are 
not true Muslims. He cites examples of those Afghan leaders 
who, after their struggle and victory over the communists, have 
become embroiled in a power struggle that has devastated their 
country and displaced their people. He says he is distressed 
when he hears about fighting for booty in Afghanistan. He 
stresses that these leaders have "distorted and defamed Islam." 
<H5>  ISLAMISTS WIN AGRONOMISTS SYNDICATE ELECTIONS </H5>
  A 50-word report on page 1 notes that the Islamic trend 
representatives won the agronomists syndicate elections in Cairo 
and al-Jizah for the first time, despite rigging and pressure by 
the government organs to prevent the Labor Party member from 
winning. 
<H5>  IMPROVING TIES WITH ISRAEL </H5>
  In an approximately 3,000-word article on page 5, Dr. 
Muhammad Hilmi Murad discusses Egyptian Government newspapers' 
reports intended to prepare public opinion to welcome joint 
projects with Israel even before a comprehensive peace is 
reached in the region. He notes AL-AKHBAR chief editor's article 
calling for warming up peace and promoting ties with Israel. He 
notes AL-AHRAM chief editor's call for establishing gas pipes to 
Israel and even to supplying Nile water to Gaza, the West Bank, 
and Israel. Murad argues that it is important to study the 
effects of the Israeli projects and the "conditions outlined to 
control our national economy." He says that the government 
newspapers skip over these issues to pave the way for what the 
United States and the Western countries are trying "to impose on 
us to enable Israel to dominate the economic cartel designed for 
the Middle East" and to eliminate any attempt to establish 
Arab-Islamic economic unity. He notes that Israel has not given 
up its motto of a greater Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates 
and has not agreed to give up its nuclear weapons. He wonders if 
anyone can imagine a spirit of cooperation, accord, and peace 
prevailing between a country in possession of nuclear weapons 
and others that have only conventional weapons. He argues 
against accepting joint projects in Sinai because it is 
"demilitarized in favor of Israel." 
  Mustafa Bakri is the author of an approximately 1,000 
word-article on page 8. He criticizes Agriculture Minister Dr. 
Yusuf Wali's statement before the People's Assembly in which he 
praised the benefits gained from agricultural cooperation with 
Israel. He says that Wali shows disdain for the people's 
feelings when he says that the peace agreement signed between 
Israel and Egypt in 1978 brought about numerous benefits and 
introduced the use of Israeli technology and expertise into 
Egypt. He contends that cooperation "serves the Israeli and not 
the Egyptian economy." He notes that Israel lacks capital and 
that its "lifeline lies in opening up Arab markets before it." 
He says that Israel enters Egypt and the region "not to 
contribute to its development but to control its resources and 
bolster its economy." He contends that the Israeli plan to link 
the Red Sea to the Dead Sea and the Dead Sea to the 
Mediterranean is aimed at "eliminating the strategic importance 
of the Suez Canal." He exhorts citizens that their support of 
the Zionist treasury means that they antagonize their homeland, 
interests, and religion," which urges struggle against enemies. 
<H5>  ISLAMIC COLUMNIST RAPS TV BAN ON ISLAMIC ANNOUNCERS </H5>
  In his regular column, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus, noted Muslim 
Brotherhood writer, features a 500-word article on page 12 in 
which he assails those in charge of the Cairo Radio and 
Television, saying that their thinking "runs counter" to Islam 
and freedom. He says that they ban female announcers who wear 
the head covering. He wonders how Egypt can claim to be an 
Islamic country when it bans an announcer wearing a head 
covering. He says that the government's ban on the Radio and 
Television employees' establishing a union to defend their 
interests runs counter to freedom and Islam, noting that this is 
a "totalitarian mentality" and indicates "absolute rule." He 
argues that the Egyptian man in the street resents the 
television reports glorifying the ruler, noting that the people 
cannot forget the uproar that accompanied the nomination of 
President Mubarak as the only candidate for the presidential 
elections. He notes that Egyptian television is a master at 
twisting reality and turning it upside down.

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 15 February 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  Contents: </H5>
  1. Grand Imam on Dialogue in Islam. 
  2. Ending the Boycott With Israel. 
  3. Social Solidarity in Islam 
  4. On the Koran and Hostile Currents 
  5. Religious Versus Enlightening Books

<H5>  GRAND IMAM ON DIALOGUE IN ISLAM </H5>
  In its 15 February, the state-owned weekly 'AQIDATI 
publishes 
on page 3 an 800-word article by Grand Imam of al-Azhar His 
Eminence Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq, in which he writes 
about the ethics of dialogue in Islam. Citing the Koranic verse 
" Invite all to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful 
preaching and argue with them in ways that are best and most 
gracious," he explains that preaching is meant for those who are 
already bound by the right principles, while arguing is usually 
used with those who disagree with one's ideas and tend to use 
rough or aggressive language in voicing their differences. 
  Imam Jad-al-Haqq remarks that "violent language is 
unnecessary and fruitless, because it hurts the feelings and 
spoils amity." He notes that choosing the right word or 
expression can sometimes solve problems. 
<H5>  ENDING THE BOYCOTT WITH ISRAEL </H5>
  A 100-word report on page 3 cites the grand imam as he 
emphasizes that "it is inevitable to maintain all types and 
forms of Arab economic and trade boycott of Israel until full 
withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories, primarily 
Jerusalem and al-Aqsa Mosque, is achieved." 
  Citing Imam Jad-al-Haqq's interview with AL-ITTIHAD 
newspaper 
of the United Arab Emirates, the report adds that the imam 
pointed out that "Israel's history shows that it has not honored 
a pledge or respected a promise. Therefore, calling for or 
demanding the abolition of economic and trade boycotts with it 
before full withdrawal from all the lands it occupies is 
impermissible and improper, and also a grave mistake." 
<H5>  SOCIAL SOLIDARITY IN ISLAM </H5>
  A 2,500-word report on page 4 gives an account of a seminar 
'AQIDATI held in the Anas Ibn-Malik Mosque in the city of Suez 
under the banner of "Fasting and Social Solidarity." After 
discussing social solidarity in Islam, particularly in the 
fasting month of Ramadan, speakers answer the audience' 
questions. 
  Asked if there is hope to extend social solidarity to 
Muslims 
around the world, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, al-Azhar 
Professor Fathi Mihriz replies that all Muslims should hasten to 
give a hand to brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina if they get the 
chance. 
  Chief editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf blames all Muslims for 
what is happening in the Muslim world today, because "they have 
deviated from the correct understanding of Islam, lived in a 
trance and in superstitions that have no link with or root in 
religion, and let Europe advance in science and take the reins 
of the world." 
  Asked what 'AQIDATI does to confront the communists and 
secularists who attack Islam from within, 'Abd-al-Ra'uf says: 
"We are being subjected to a fierce campaign from the 
secularists and communists to whom the doors of some newspapers 
and magazines, some of which belong to the government, were 
opened." He reiterates that 'AQIDATI has a clear and obvious 
role in fighting ignorance and superstitions, as well as those 
who fight Islam. 
<H5>  ON THE KORAN AND HOSTILE CURRENTS </H5>
  Page 10 features a 1,500-word report on remarks Shaykh 
Muhammad al-Ghazali made at "The Opera Cultural Salon" on 14 
February regarding anti-Islamic currents and their possible 
impact on Koran and tradition. At the beginning, al-Ghazali 
stressed that "there is no fear for Koran and tradition from the 
anti-Islamic currents, because the Almighty will guard His 
message against corruption." He affirms that "the Koran and 
tradition will stay in spite of the secularists." 
  Al-Ghazali attributes the Islamic nation's weakness and its 
political, economic, and social defeats to many causes, 
including "the misunderstanding of the Koran and tradition and 
the failure to observe and examine narrations thoroughly." The 
problem is how to promote your Islam since you did not adhere to 
it or apply it accurately, he said. 
  He added that Muslims are fighting two battles: One against 
the terrorist movements that have wrongly been attributed to 
Islam and the second against the allegations of the "secular 
enlighteners" who refuse to see that "Islam is an enlightened 
intellectual movement that urges the people to learn their 
religion correctly and draw evidence from the universe." He 
stressed that the nation can never accept the view that the 
revelation is an obsolete concept, that the Koran is an Arabic 
literary text, or that the Prophet's tradition is inapplicable. 
  Dr. Ahmad Kamal Abu-al-Majd remarked that the nation is 
experiencing discord and disagreement and that some groups 
belittle thought and make their own rulings that forbid 
everything. He asks al-Ghazali why such groups appeared and how 
their thought can be rectified. He answers that the cause lies 
in the fact that Islamic culture is being presented in a fake 
image that is full of contradictions. This has led to 
differences that have affected the thought of the religious 
youth. Therefore, he stresses the need for cleansing the 
Islamic culture of all the old delusions and germs implanted in 
it. 

<H5>    RELIGIOUS VERSUS ENLIGHTENING BOOKS </H5>
  In a 200-word article on page 18, columnist Mamduh al-'Ashri 
criticizes Dr. Samir Sarahn, chairman of the Public Book 
Authority, for expressing his view on a television program that 
"Islamic books discount the brainpower of youth and their low 
prices adversely affected other books on display in the fair." 
The columnist wonders how such a statement can get past the 
censor, as it casts doubt on facts stated in the Koran. 
  Al-'Ashri is surprised that Sarhan says this while 
"licentious books and pornographic magazines fill the fair's 
corridors." These books not only contradict Islam, but also the 
Egyptian people's customs and tradition, he remarks. 
  He notes that religious books were the most expensive at the 
fair, while the other so-called enlightening books were the 
cheapest. Nonetheless, he adds, more than 15 million Egyptian 
pounds worth of religious books were sold at the fair. 
  Wondering what "those people" have against the honorable 
al-Azhar, which represents pure Islam which is the official 
religion of the country, al-'Ashri notes that the Vatican, 
"Rome's pride," banned Madonna's book and no one dared to object 
because the Vatican is a symbol of religion. How can we allow 
ourselves to talk against al-Azhar, which stands for Islam, he 
asks. 
  Touching on the same subject, Ibrahim Nasr writes a 150-word 
article on page 23 in which he talks about "the high voices that 
express concern over the numerous booklets that talk about 
torture in the grave and bliss in paradise--which they call 
after-death imaginings--and claim that these booklets discount 
the brainpower of youth." 
  Nasr is surprised that it is these same voices that demand 
freedom of expression and of the press and are responsible for 
publishing the "impolite" books which were confiscated and 
banned from circulation by the law. 
  He asks: What freedom do they want: Freedom of thought or 
of disbelief? 
<H5>  MUSLIM INFIGHTING IN AFGHANISTAN </H5>
  Chairman of the Board Samir Rajab writes in his 350-words 
column on page 1 that the warring factions in Afghanistan broke 
the Ramadan cease-fire agreement in just a few days. He remarks 
that the mujahidin who filled the world with talk about their 
jihad are proving day after day that all they ever thought of 
was their personal interests and their lust for power. 
  Rajab regrets that "the communist rule in Afghanistan was 
more stable and secure and more protective of people's lives." 
It is true that it had many shortcomings and gaps, but, on the 
other hand, it did not allow that infinite bloodletting, he says. 
  He argues that that was the cat and mouse game between 
America and the former Soviet Union. The two came out intact, 
letting the naive Afghan fall into a bottomless pit, he says, 
adding: Russia has cashed in its chips, letting America take 
all the loot, not only in that region but in the whole world. 
Meanwhile, the miserable mujahidin are finishing themselves off 
with their own hands, he says. 
  In conclusion, Rajab expresses his surprise that "other 
people have sealed their minds off, refusing to learn from the 
Afghan experience. The result is more blood, more destruction, 
and ruin." It is true that one man's poison is another's meat, 
he remarks. 
<H5>  ISLAMIC STATES AND BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA </H5>
  A 150-word report by Jamal Salim, page 20, says that the 
World Islamic Council for Call and Relief has issued a statement 
"condemning the massacres to which Sarajevo Muslims were 
subjected. The statement appeals to Arab and Islamic governments 
and people to adopt strict measures, particularly the severance 
of diplomatic and cultural ties with Serbia and the states that 
support it, primarily Russia and Greece, and the expulsion of 
these states' ambassadors from Islamic capitals." 
  The report adds that the council called on Islamic people, 
political and party institutions, trade unions, and other 
economic, trade, cultural, and tourist centers "to boycott the 
Yugoslav companies and freeze all dealings with them." 
  The statement also called on the Islamic states to adopt a 
political and military plan to lift the ban on arming 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, set up a world popular court to punish the 
Serbian criminals, and collect donations for Bosnian Muslims. 
  The statement finally calls on Islamic states "not to 
recognize the geographic and demographic changes imposed by the 
brutal Serbian power." 
  Basyuni al-Halwani's 500-word column on page 6 criticizes 
Islamic states that content themselves with statements of 
denunciation and condemnation and watch the "Serbian criminals" 
as they demonstrate their malice for Islam and Muslims, 
desecrate the sanctities, and destroy lives. 
  He says that the international community has proved that it 
protects the law of the jungle when it closed its eyes to the 
Serbian crimes for over two years and encouraged them with its 
inaction and negligence to liquidate the Islamic identity of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He regrets that despite the hideousness of the Serbian 
crimes, states like Russia uncovered their ugly faces, started 
to encourage the Serbians in their aggression, and hampered 
every attempt to restore peace to the region.

  [Text] The Presidential Council met under Presidential 
Council Chairman brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
yesterday evening. The Council reviewed the topics listed on 
its agenda, foremost among which was the accord document signed 
in Amman, the capital of fraternal Jordan, on the 10th of the 
blessed month of Ramadan. 
  The Presidential Council blessed the signing of the accord 
document and commended the efforts made by the Political Forces 
Dialogue Committee to draft the document. Moreover, the Council 
underlined the importance of the commitment by all to honor the 
letter and spirit of the accord document. The Council noted 
that this requires the convening of meetings by the state's 
constitutional institutions, which are charged with implementing 
this document, particularly since this document, which is 
binding on all, is supposed to have resolved all political, 
media, and military aspects of the crisis. The convening of 
such meetings is part of the constitutional responsibilities 
that must be shouldered in unison. There should be no attempts 
to evade or slacken off on the part of anyone, the Council 
maintained. 
  The Council also expressed its immense appreciation to 
fraternal Jordan--king, government, and people--for hosting the 
signing ceremony. It also commended the fraternal efforts made 
by His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal to safeguard Yemen's unity 
and end all manifestations of the political crisis. 
Furthermore, the Council praised the efforts and good offices 
extended by brothers and friends to enable our country to cope 
with the tough challenges posed by the continuation of the 
political crisis. 
  The Presidential Council underscored the need for everyone 
to 
adhere to this historic national document agreed to by the 
Political Forces Dialogue Committee with a strong national 
spirit grounded in the certain basic constants, foremost among 
which are the following: 
  --Islam is a creed and a law, 
  --Unity must be safeguarded, 
  --Democracy must be protected, 
  --There must be compliance with the Constitution, 
  --The base of popular participation in the decisionmaking 
process must be broadened, 
  --Violence must be renounced, 
  --Dialogue must be used as a civilized mode of behavior to 
resolve all disputes.

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 23 (AFP)--Rival troops were on high alert 
east of the port city of Aden Wednesday, as the authorities in 
former North and South Yemen engaged in a war of words following 
clashes in which at least 20 were reported killed. 
  A spokesman for the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) 
accused troops from the north of having "extended their 
deployment beyond the Abyan region" about 100 kilometres (62 
miles) east of Aden. 
  Southern forces were preparing to "resist the armed 
aggression," the spokesman said, adding that northern forces, 
including the Republican Guard, had also been redeployed along 
the former north- south border, facing southern troops. 
  Meanwhile, Salim Salih Muhammad, a southern member of 
Yemen's 
presidential council, told the official UAE news agency WAM that 
Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid would "not go to Sanaa in the 
current security situation, before troops have been withdrawn 
from Yemeni towns." al-Bid was due back in Yemen later Wednesday. 
  The YSP said Tuesday the northern al-'Amaliqah brigade 
ambushed and killed 15 southern soldiers in Abyan, endangering a 
reconciliation agreement between north and south signed in Amman 
on Sunday. In Sanaa, officials of President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's General People's Congress (GPC) said two soldiers were 
killed and 20 wounded on both sides. 
  On Monday seven were reported killed in clashes between 
troops from north and south. The two armies have not been 
merged since the country was unified in May 1990. 
  Salih and al-Bid signed a deal in Amman on Sunday to end a 
political crisis which has paralysed Yemen since al-Bid refused 
to take up his duties as vice-president in Sanaa in August, 
demanding major economic, political and military reforms. 
  Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah denounced 
southern 
leaders on Wednesday for visiting neighbouring Gulf states, 
saying they were trying to gain support in the crisis. 
  "The moves by southern leaders are a continuation of the 
undeclared secessionist policies practised since last August," 
Basindwah told the Kuwaiti newspaper al-Siyasah. 
  Southerner Salim Salih Muhammad rejected Basindwah's 
comments 
as "baseless" and said the officials were touring Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to explain the Amman accord 
and patch up relations which were soured by Yemen's perceived 
support for Iraq in the 1991 Gulf war. 
  Basindwah also said Yemen was keen to have good relations 
with Gulf countries "and hopes those countries will realise the 
importance of not allowing any party to drag them over to its 
side." 
  He was commenting on al-Bid's visits to Saudi Arabia and 
Oman, just after he signed the reconciliation agreement with 
Salih. 
  al-Bid, who heads the YSP, met King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for 
the first time since the end of the Gulf war. The two leaders 
appeared on television in the region shaking hands and smiling. 
  Salim Salih Muhammad travelled to Kuwait and the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE), where he briefed leaders on the Amman accord, 
brokered by King Husayn of Jordan. 
  The reconciliation accord called for constitutional reforms, 
an improvement of security and the withdrawal of military 
checkpoints from cities.

  [Text] Sanaa, 23 Feb (INA)--A source from the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] today accused northern Yemeni forces, 
including the al-'Amaliqah brigade, of continuing to expand and 
deploy to confront southern forces close to the border between 
the two parts of Yemen. In a statement over Aden television a 
short while ago, the source said that the southern forces have 
been defending their positions since last night. 
  The source said that the al-'Amaliqah forces, the 
presidential guard, the central security forces, and other units 
are still expanding and deploying in three border areas of Sabil 
Yahya, al- Raqma', and Saqab [names as received] in Abyan 
Governorate in the direction of the al-Dali' border area. 
  The source said armed clashes took place between the al- 
'Amaliqah brigade and the southern Madram [name as received] 
brigade and the 39th infantry battalion stationed 100 km from 
al- 'Amaliqah. He said the southern units are still repelling 
the al- 'Amaliqah attack that began last night. The source did 
not mention human or material losses sustained during the 
clashes. 
  On another level, Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas 
has announced that the recent Abyan military clashes have 
resulted in a number of casualties among the Yemeni Armed Forces. 
  In remarks upon arrival in Aden from the Sultanate of Oman 
today, al-'Attas said that the recent military incidents have 
escalated the Yemeni crisis to an unprecedented level. He said: 
"We did not expect such a thing from our brothers," alluding to 
north Yemen with which an agreement was signed in Amman recently. 
  Al-'Attas said that there is no way out of this crisis 
except 
by adhering to dialogue and by strict compliance with what has 
been agreed upon.

  [Text] Prime Minster Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, returned 
back home at dawn today on his way back from Hashimite Joranian 
capital, Amman, accompanied by brothers Fadl Muhsin 'Abdallah, 
the minister of fisheries and member of the Dialogue Committee; 
Jarallah 'Umar, minister of culture and tourism and member of 
the Dialogue Committee; Salih Mutran, member of the Council of 
Deputies and member of the Dialogue Committee, after the 
delegation accompanying him and participated in the ceremony of 
signing the accord document. 
  Upon his return to Aden, brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas 
delivered a statement to the Yemeni news agency, SABA, in which 
he said: The sigining of the accord document for building the 
Yemeni state represented a good and important step along the 
road for overpassing the political, economic, and social crisis 
which our country is living. We were looking during the signing 
of the accord document in the Jordanian capital, Amman, that 
this will reflect itself positively, particularly on the level 
of the military situation. 
  But, contrary to this, we were appalled with regrettable 
incidents which Abyan Governorate witnessed and which took the 
lives of a number of the sons of our armed forces and which led 
to the raising of the level of tension to a level not 
precedented before. He added, saying: We denounce this action 
which we did not expect from the brothers following the signing 
of the accord document. We renew the emphasis for our absolute 
refusal to be dragged into such acts. In the same time, we have 
confidence in our people's capability of refusing and curbing 
these acts. We emphasize in this context that there is no way 
out of the situation for Yemen except through dialogue and the 
commitment towards this document.

  [Text] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has ordered Defense 
Minister Haytham Qasim Tahir to return the southern troops 
deployed in the Abyan area, east of Aden, to their barracks in 
Hadhramaut in the east. In a message to the defense minister, 
President Salih ordered his defense minister to ban armed 
flights without a prior agreement with the chief of staff and 
the higher commander of the Yemeni Armed Forces. 
  In his message, the Yemeni president stressed that moving a 
military unit from one place to another without a regular 
approval by the higher commander of the Armed Forces constitutes 
a violation of the Constitution and the document of accord, 
which was signed in Amman last Sunday to end the political 
crisis in the country.

<F P=106> [By Ramadan al-Rawashidah and Muhammad Farhan] </F>
  [Excerpts] Political parties participating in the Yemeni 
coalition government, and Yemeni party figures signed the pledge 
and accord document in Amman on 20 February under the 
sponsorship of his Majesty King Husayn. 
  Hundreds of Yemeni and Arab political figures came to Amman 
to participate in the signing ceremony and to witness it. 
  AL-AHALI covered the event and interviewed Salim Salih 
Muhammad, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council and 
assistant secretary general of the Yemeni Socilaist Party [YSP]. 
[passage omitted] 
  On the series of assassinations of YSP officials, Salim 
Salih 
Muhammad said the party that carried out the assassinations is 
the Jihad organization, an organization sponsored by the Yemeni 
Reform Grouping. Some of these elements returned from 
Afghanistan and were identified. They were identified only in 
the areas where we are present, he said. We supplied all the 
information needed concerning their activities and they were 
arrested. Others are still at large in Sanaa and the tribal 
areas. Some tribes and shaykhs are protecting them, not to 
mention some influential armed forces officers. 
  Muhammad added: That's why the first point of the document 
dealt with addressing the security situation, and arresting the 
culprits and bringing them to trial. He said: We do not pass 
judgment in advance. We leave this to the courts to decide. 
  Muhammad added that the security issue is now the major 
concern of the people. One week ago, oil companies and embassies 
gave us information on terrorist operations to take place in the 
southern areas, particularly attacks against oil facilities. 
  Salim Salih Muhammad admitted that some documents show that 
this scheme and those responsible for it are connected to Usamah 
Bin-Ladin, a Saudi national who is now in Sudan. Usamah 
Bin-Ladin is known for his support for fundamentalist movements, 
particularly those returning from Afghanistan. 
  Muhammad added: I told the U.S. ambassador that you nurtured 
these terrorists and used them at a certain time to confront the 
liberation movements, nationalist regimes, and the socialist 
bloc. Now they have turned against you. 
  Muhammad said: Our stand in the YSP on terrorism is firm. We 
are against it, against exporting it, and against all the forms 
it may take, whether ideological or any other form. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf by </F>
'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sayyid in Baghdad; date not given; from a 
Qatari Television program on Iraq] 
  [Text] [Al-Sayyid] Welcome, minister. 
  [Al-Sahhaf] Welcome to you. 
  [Al-Sayyid] Minister, the Security Council says that Iraq 
has 
not yet implemented every Security Council resolution relating 
to the Gulf war. What is your comment on this? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] If we discuss Iraq's implementation of the 
obligations imposed on it by Resolution 687 accurately, we will 
notice--even those hostile to Iraq and the Arabs cannot deny 
this--that Iraq has met most of the obligations imposed on it by 
this resolution. The other issues do not require practical 
implementation, but compliance. And Iraq has announced that it 
complies with them. So talk of Iraq not complying with the 
Security Council resolutions is inaccurate and has political 
objectives. The clear answer is that Iraq has honored what is 
contained in this resolution. Section C of this particular 
resolution deals with the need for Iraq to get rid of the mass 
destruction weapons. In this regard, Iraq possesses no such 
weapons and has no capability to manufacture them. So why keep 
repeating that Iraq is not complying? The logical answer, no 
matter what side you are on, is that there are political reasons 
for maintaining the blockade of Iraq and keeping up the hostile 
campaign against Iraq. This is primarily because this crisis 
and this war have goals that are greater than, goals that have 
nothing to do with what is being alleged, that is, that it is 
about Kuwait. The foreign parties within the Security Council, 
chiefly the United States, have political objectives that have 
nothing to do with the crisis. Now that Iraq has implemented 
the obligations imposed on it by this resolution, they have 
started to implement the objectives of their policies in the 
region. It is no longer an issue of the resolutions in 
connection with this crisis. We have complied with and honored 
Iraq's obligations and continue to cooperate in terms of the 
details relating to all the clauses that require measures under 
Section C. By accepting Resolution 715, there is nothing left, 
but the technical details of the long-term monitoring. 
  [Al-Sayyid] Minister, there is a Security Council resolution 
that calls on Iraq to export limited amounts of its oil to meet 
its basic needs, such as buying food and medicine. But Iraq 
refuses to implement this resolution. What is Iraq's 
justification for refusing to implement this resolution? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] You mean Resolution 706, don't you? 
  [Al-Sayyid] Yes. 
  [Al-Sahhaf] The background of Resolution 706 is that Prince 
Sadruddin Agha Khan, a special representative of the UN 
secretary general, has come to Iraq as part of the job of the UN 
General Secretariat and the UN secretary general to examine the 
so-called humanitarian situation in Iraq and Kuwait. The team 
working under Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan carried out studies 
relating to the serious humanitarian situation resulting from 
the war that destroyed much of the civilian facilities in the 
cities and even villages, such as projects for drinking water, 
sewage, fuel, hospitals, etc. Those people submitted reports 
giving a realistic picture of the humanitarian situation that 
became a threat to the lives of millions. 
  In this report--this study--they urged prompt action to 
enable Iraq to provide the necessary services such as health, 
water, and sewage. They specified the utilities concerned, 
including potable water, sewage, and agriculture. The report 
was sent to New York but instead of responding to Sadruddin Agha 
Khan's appeal, the Americans and their allies turned the affair 
into a political game. They referred the whole issue to a 
resolution adopted in line with the UN Charter's Chapter 7 but 
still claimed that they were acting in line with humanitarian 
concerns. Chapter 7 deals with the measures the UN Security 
Council can adopt to maintain security and peace when a 
situation threatening world security and peace arises, including 
issues of nuclear armament and violent strife. They sought to 
govern humanitarian requests dealing with sewage and hygiene in 
line with Chapter 7. 
  They said that Iraq could export oil worth $1.6 billion. But 
they said they wanted to station inspectors inside the Iraqi oil 
marketing authority. When an oil importer comes to buy, say a 
Netherlands buyer or the Netherlands Government, the inspectors 
would take part in the negotiations over the transaction. They 
could say: Sorry, we will not permit this transaction. Let's 
suppose the deal is carried through. The contract to sell the 
oil would go to New York and would be submitted to the sanctions 
committee, which might not permit the deal. Suppose the 
sanctions committee agreed, they would want to station 
inspectors at the loading terminals, for example the deep water 
al-Bakr Port. We export our oil via the Arab Gulf. They would 
want to station inspectors at the deep water al-Bakr Port. One 
inspector might say he won't allow the deal to go through and 
that he believes the Iraqis are cheating on the quality of the 
oil. He might ask that a tanker already loaded with oil be 
unloaded. Let's suppose the tanker leaves the port and the 
cargo is sold. As soon as the oil is sold, the proceeds will be 
taken from Iraq and placed in a closed account with the UN 
secretary general, who is empowered to release funds from it, 
not Iraq. 
  Let us suppose Iraq accepts this too, it must then submit a 
list of its needs including potatoes, rice, and sugar to the 
sanctions committee. The committee would then say it does not 
approve of so much rice for the Iraqis and would want a smaller 
quantity. It would make the decisions, not us. Let us suppose 
they accepted the list of commodities, they would want to 
appoint overseers [preceding word in English] who would decide 
where Iraq would buy the rice, say from Thailand. They would 
want to inspect the rice and state whether they would approve 
its purchase or not. Let us suppose they approved it, they 
would put a Security Council stamp on it. Let us suppose they 
did so, they would then monitor the transporting ship. Suppose 
we want this shipment to arrive via al-'Aqabah, they would want 
to station inspectors in al-'Aqabah to see if it is the same 
rice. They would want to station inspectors on the border and 
in Baghdad. When the rice reached the outskirts of Baghdad, 
they would ask to see the warehouses where it was going to be 
stored. They would see them. They would then ask to be 
informed where we want to distribute it. We would for example 
tell them: Babil Governorate. They would go to supervise 
operations in Babil. Who would be selling it? Say, for example, 
11,000 food commodity agents in a governorate of 1.5 million 
people. They would want to go and watch how those 11,000 agents 
sell the rice. This resolution was not adopted to ease the 
Iraqi people's hardships. It was a political resolution 
designed to provoke. They claim they have given Iraq a chance 
that Iraq has declined to use. It follows then that the Iraqi 
Government does not want to feed its people. If you examined 
the conditions they have set, you would not only reject them, 
but would lose faith in these people as human beings. The 
objective is a political one. We told them: Although you 
turned Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan's report upside down and 
transformed its humanitarian objective into a colonialist 
scheme, you must feel that this resolution cannot be 
implemented. This is because when you drafted it and had it 
issued by the Security Council, you had a political objective. 
Because of your erroneous information, you imagined that if you 
pressured the Iraqis in this manner, they would proclaim their 
surrender and invite you to colonize them as you wished. This 
erroneous interpretation of affairs led to the adoption of an 
ugly resolution that cannot be implemented. We explained that 
in a clear, calm manner. 
  After that, they sent us UN Assistant Secretary General 
Kofi Annan, who is from Africa. He told us: We know that this 
resolution is not applicable in the first place. We asked 
technical experts and they said the resolution is not 
applicable. We are prepared to hold talks with you to reach a 
reasonable formula [words indistinct]. 
  We held three rounds of negotiations in Vienna. We would 
have reached an agreement each time, but when the UN delegation 
returned to New York, the U.S. ambassador would find fault with 
it and say: Why did you do this? How could you agree with the 
Iraqis on this? No, we do not concur, we have this condition and 
that one. 
  The talks would then stop, and the United Nations would come 
later to propose new talks. This we did, and the same story 
happened, and it happened a third time in Vienna. The talks 
then stopped. 
  Recently, UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
renewed the idea. An Iraqi delegation went to New York and they 
discussed the issue. Still, the UN General Assembly delegation 
had no flexibility, not even half of the flexibility that 
existed in the Vienna talks. I sent a message to the UN general 
secretary telling him... [pauses] By then, that is, in the 
fourth round of talks, we had made major progress with the 
Special Commission and Ambassador Ekeus. We had agreed that 
only the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 
remained after we accepted Resolution 715 on future monitoring. 
  I said in my message to the UN secretary general that we 
believe we were very close to the implementation of Paragraph 22 
of Resolution 687. This paragraph calls for lifting the embargo 
on Iraq's exports in general. The paragraph is permanent and 
better than a temporary one. You know that Resolution 706 is 
valid for six months and is renewable. 
  So, we propose that we concentrate our efforts on reaching 
and implementing Paragraph 22, and consequently lifting the 
embargo on the export of Iraqi oil. I proposed, as an interim 
formula, that Iraq be allowed to export an amount of oil in 
accordance with a formula that guarantees the UN's ability to 
know the amount sold and the price. The UN will take its share 
for the reparations fund and the rest will go to Iraq to buy 
[food and medicines]. The agreement was (?public), and we even 
made this proposal: If some sides claim that we may use this 
little amount of money to buy things other than food and 
medicine, then we propose that we buy from the markets of 
Security Council members. If we buy from the markets of the 15 
Security Council members, then nothing will remain hidden. They 
gave no answer. Now, we are concentrating on reaching Paragraph 
22, which is better. 
  [Al-Sayyid] Mr. Minister, you said that part of the Iraqi 
oil 
revenues, when exported, will be deposited into the reparation 
fund. How does Iraq view the issue of compensations, especially 
of those harmed by the Gulf war? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] Iraq is the biggest victim of the events and the 
American-Atlantic aggression. When we accepted Resolution 687, 
and before that the other resolutions, we accepted the principle 
of compensations in accordance with the rules of international 
law. This is our position: Compensation in accordance with 
international law. 
  [Al-Sayyid] Your Excellency, does Iraq expect the blockade 
to be partially or completely lifted in the foreseeable future? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] We are working toward complete implementation of 
Paragraph 22. Logic dictates this. The sound thing to do is to 
finish work along with the Security Council to implement 
Paragraph 22 without either party adding any political 
conditions to this paragraph. The text is very clear. There 
are requirements that should be met to implement this text. 
These requirements provide that in accordance with the mission 
assigned them, envoy Ekeus -- the executive chairman of the 
Security Council ad hoc committee -- and Hans Blix -- the IAEA 
director general -- submit a report to the Security Council 
notifying it that Iraq has fulfilled its commitments outlined in 
the (?new) section, namely Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13. 
We are now very close to this goal. We will work with the ad 
hoc committee and the IAEA to work out the technical formulas to 
start implementing the control programs in accordance with 
Resolution 715. Consequently, the Security Council will be 
dutybound to implement Paragraph [word indistinct] 
  [Al-Sayyid] Your Excellency, another issue that pertains to 
the ceasefire in the Gulf War is the demarcation of borders 
between the Republic of Iraq and the State of Kuwait. We would 
like to know Iraq's justifications for refraining from 
demarcation of the borders with Kuwait despite the Security 
Council resolution passed on the issue and despite the fact that 
an Iraqi representative attended some meetings on the issue 
under the auspices of the United Nations. 
  [Al-Sahhaf] We have not signed [on the demarcation of 
borders]. The paragraphs of Resolution 687 require compliance; 
that is, there is nothing we can do. They went and demarcated 
the borders in accordance with the Security Council resolutions. 
They laid down the bases for the demarcation and that is that. 
Land has been taken from a number of farmers according to the 
new border line. Iraqi territories and homes were taken from 
their owners. These people are (?vacating) the area [words 
indistinct]. There is a difference. When they ask me if I have 
something that I must get rid of, for instance, they said that 
we have chemical weapons. We said yes, here they are. They said 
that these weapons must be destroyed. Alright, they will be 
destroyed. Regarding the issue you have raised, there is no 
measure or function left for us to do. They want us to comply. 
When we agreed on Resolution 687, it meant that we complied. 
They should not have asked anything more. 
  [Al-Sayyid] What is your view on this issue? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] I have no other comment. We are now discussing 
the issue as a whole between Iraq and the Security Council. 
When there is a paragraph that requires a certain measure and 
agreement is reached on the measure, we do what is required. 
All paragraphs require compliance, and nothing else. All that 
they demand of us is compliance. Iraq has done nothing 
indicating it is not complying. On the contrary: There are very 
clear examples showing we are complying, such as the farmers and 
their lands, the people living in the border area and their 
homes, our problems, and territory. These Iraqis left their 
land and homes. 
  [Al-Sayyid] There is also the issue of Kuwaiti POW's. Kuwait 
says that Iraq has been holding more than 600 people since the 
Iraqi forces entered Kuwait in August 1990. Iraq, through 
contacts by the Arab League, the United nations, and other world 
organizations, maintains that it does not hold Kuwaitis. What 
is your comment on this issue? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] I have no comment. I myself said this at the 
Arab League and at the United Nations. I stated this fact. 
There are no Kuwaiti detainees in Iraq. There is absolutely 
not one Kuwaiti behind bars in Iraq. After the aggression 
against Iraq stopped, Iraq handed over the POW's it had, be they 
Kuwaitis, Americans, French, Saudis, or others. We handed them 
over through the International Committee of the Red Cross 
[ICRC]. However, there are a number of Kuwaitis who live in 
iraq. They still live in Iraq. If you travel in Iraq you can 
see and perhaps meet Kuwaitis who still live in Iraq. There are 
some Kuwaitis in Iraq. Some of them are called Bidun [Kuwaitis 
without Kuwaiti nationality], and other Kuwaitis. They still 
live in Iraq. Some of them have shops or homes and others have 
relatives or clans in Iraq. [words indistinct] We asked them to 
register their names with the ICRC, because maybe some of them 
want to return to Kuwait. Indeed, many of them wish to return 
to Kuwait. The Kuwaitis said that Iraq has Kuwaiti POW's and 
detainees. They said that the first list includes 7,000 or 
7,400. We said that [words indistinct] and that they are 
mistaken. 
  After a while, they said no, we are wrong; what you have 
are 6,000 and something, and they presented a new list. We told 
them the same thing and repeated that we do not have them; we 
said that some names were included in the previous list you 
talked about. They said no; the real number is 5,000 and 
something. In this way, we have received seven lists through 
the Red Cross. The number boiled down to 622. Who are they? 
If you look at their personal files you will find someone named 
so and so, who is the son of so and so, and who was seen at a 
supermarket in Kuwait--say in al-Salmiyah area or some other 
place--and after that nothing is known about him. How could you 
be so inaccurate as to presume that this person is in Iraq? 
There is a specific method followed in such cases. There is an 
internationally recognized method according to which the Red 
Cross gives out application forms and procedures. So it is a 
question of missing persons. Didn't they call it Desert Storm? 
This storm took many people; Iraqis, Kuwaitis, and other human 
beings. So we are facing a question of missing persons, not 
prisoners deliberately captured by the Iraqi troops or Iraqi 
authorities and taken to jail and whom we refuse to release. 
This is a lie. This is a game usually played in times of 
crisis to keep the atmosphere tense and keep a standing 
accusation, so that someone can come to you and tell you: 
Brother, why are you doing this? This is a natural human 
reaction. Why keep them? They have families and they are 
miserable. Thus, an atmosphere of tension against Iraq will 
remain. This is the whole idea. Look at what they are doing 
now, for instance. Kuwaiti television signs off with prayers 
that say: May God return our prisoners to us. In their planes, 
they write: Do not forget our prisoners, and so on. When they 
go to a meeting they deliberately start a discussion on the 
subject so as to create certain feelings and to gain sympathy 
for political reasons. The fact of the matter is that we have 
to work to gather information on people who have gone missing 
and whose whereabouts we should ascertain. They talk and 
present personal files of 622 or a similar figure. We will 
present files on about 63,000 missing Iraqis. Sixty-three 
thousand Iraqis. We will present them through the Red Cross. 
You know that whenever crises and armed struggles take place, 
[pauses] ... Even up to today, the Americans are running around 
looking for the missing in action [previous three words in 
English] in Vietnam. Do they want by this game to keep.... 
[sentence incomplete as heard] This is governed by rules that 
are recognized internationally and are sponsored by the ICRC and 
we proceed according to these rules. We have received personal 
files of missing people. Enough lying to people and saying that 
there are prisoners held by Iraq. There are missing people and 
we all have to cooperate to learn their whereabouts. Those 
among the missing people who have files and are accounted for, 
as the Kuwaitis admit, are 600 or 622 persons. We will present 
63,000 Iraqi files to the ICRC. From the first moment we have 
shown full readiness to cooperate in this regard--and not only 
with the ICRC--to track down these people, where they are, how, 
and what happened to them. In short, to search in every 
possible way. In addition, we have stated that we are ready to 
cooperate unconditionally with the Arab League. We have 
received two envoys: Rashid Idris and 'Abdallah Adam before him. 
We will receive a third envoy, Mayhub al-Mayhubi, Arab League 
Assistant Secretary General. You brothers in Qatar know that we 
have welcomed proposals from the Gulf. Do it any way you want. 
You may set up a committee from all the Gulf countries, except 
for the Kuwaiti Government. You may set up this committee and 
bring people from the Kuwaiti parliament, because they do not 
tell the truth. You may bring people from the Kuwaiti 
parliament. You will be most welcome to come, see, investigate, 
and search and we will open all doors for you. They proposed a 
popular committee, and we said a popular committee is fine and 
welcome. His Majesty King Hassan has raised the possibility, 
and we said welcome. Very briefly, usually after conflicts a 
search is mounted for missing persons, and we cooperate in this 
regard without any conditions. 
  [Al-Sayyid] How does Iraq view current developments in the 
Middle East, particularly the political settlement in the Middle 
East, and the Declaration of Principles, the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement between the PLO and Israel, and the political 
settlement plan between Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon and Israel? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] The developments in the Arab region do not 
inspire optimism because of the actual strategic situation and 
the imbalance in the international situation which increased 
foreign domination of the region. The available opportunities 
for Arab countries to defend their rights and pan-Arab rights 
are very limited. Therefore, I believe that overall developments 
do not serve pan-Arab interests. We are not concerned with the 
other details you mentioned. 
  [Al-Sayyid] Since we are discussing the settlement plan in 
the Middle East, do you see a role for Iraq in this plan, 
especially since news agencies recently referred to a plan to 
resettle a portion of the Palestinians in Arab countries, 
including Iraq? What is your response to this issue? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] This is nonsense. You know the extent of 
Zionism's control of the media, news agencies, particularly in 
the Western world. This is part of the psychological warfare 
against the Arabs. It is nonsense intended to confuse readers, 
viewers, and listeners. We are absolutely not and will never be 
involved in this plan. We worked within the framework of the 
Arab League and within its sole terms of reference, namely, the 
Arab summit resolutions. We have nothing else to add. 
  [Al-Sayyid] How does Iraq view the Gulf Cooperation Council 
after approximately 3 and 1/2 years since the Gulf events? What 
is your view of Gulf security? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] In the summer of 1991, more than one statement 
was made by Iraq affirming that Iraq welcomes any Arab country 
that is prepared to continue joint Arab action and cooperation 
to serve the mutual interests and rightful issues for which we 
all work. This applies to all Arabs and certainly to Iraq's 
ties with its brothers in the Gulf. We have not changed and 
will not change regarding this issue. We welcome any relations 
based on common understanding of safeguarding and promoting our 
interests and any voluntary agreement by the fraternal Arab 
countries to serve their interests. Iraq's stance on this issue 
is very clear. We are happy that Iraq and Qatar have maintained 
a useful and practical level of fraternal relations. Casual 
crises do not affect these ties. Ties remain and crises vanish. 
In fact, this stance is not casual but firm and Iraq will 
continue to adopt it sincerely and with honest intentions and 
without discrimination. Brothers experience deep differences 
and encounter difficult times, but blood never turns into water. 
The genuine interests among us remain stronger than casual 
crises. 
  [Al-Sayyid] Concerning the Arab Cooperation Council [ACC] 
which, in addition to Iraq, includes Jordan, Yemen, and the Arab 
Republic of Egypt, some coolness has affected the relations 
among these countries since the Gulf crisis. What about this 
group? Will these countries resume their cooperation? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] It is difficult to speculate on this now. The 
actual situation is that the ACC is frozen. It appears to me to 
be suspended. What things will be like, it is really difficult 
to speculate on, at least for the near future. Originally it 
was a good step but the crisis halted it. We will see how 
things turn out. 
  [Al-Sayyid] Mr. Minister, let us move on now to the future 
relations between Iraq and its neighbors, particularly Turkey 
and Iran. Your Excellency, how do you view future relations 
with these countries? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] We earnestly wish to do what we can to create a 
climate that will encourage our non-Arab neighbors--Iran and 
Turkey--to move toward a normalization of relations. This is 
especially important in the case of Iran following a bloody 
eight-year war. We are seeking to normalize ties and build a 
sound foundation that benefits from the lessons learned from the 
crisis and to create opportunities of stability and cooperation 
for the Iraqi and Iranian nations in a way that is to their 
mutual good. We have tried to do this in the past and we are 
still trying. We are always urging Iran to begin settling 
certain unresolved issues between us, foremost among them the 
POW issue and MIA issue and also the retrieval of the remains of 
such MIA's. We also wish to cooperate in connection with the 
issue of nonintervention, including crossing the border and 
infiltrations. We also would like both parties to fulfill 
certain commitments to each other. For example, the Iranians 
gave safe haven to a number of Iraqi aircraft. They must now 
return these planes, both the civilian and military ones. There 
are several other issues that are ready for settlement if the 
necessary steps are taken. These would be steps illustrating 
normal transactions between neighboring countries. During 
meetings in Karachi and New York, I agreed with Iranian Foreign 
Minister Velayati to adopt a policy that would lead to the 
results I have outlined above. This policy would involve an 
exchange of visits, holding meetings, and beginning a political 
dialogue. We made the first steps but later the atmosphere 
became a bit muddled. We hope to resume this effort soon. We 
might meet in Geneva to begin discussing the POW issue. 
  [Al-Sayyid] Dear viewers, at the end of this interview we 
express our profound thanks to His Excellency Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf. Thank you, Minister. We 
hope your efforts will succeed, God willing. 
  [Al-Sahhaf] You are most welcome.

propaganda about drafting reserves or disbanding others who have 
completed their compulsory service. 
  In a statement to AL-QADISIYAH published today, the

to the chief of staff said those conscripts born in 1973 and who 
have completed their service will be released in three groups in 
accordance with a timetable. He said that reports of a draft of 
new reserves are baseless.

<F P=106> ["Sidelines" column by Sabri Hammadi:"Van Der Stoel, the </F>
Reckless!"] 
  [Text] Since being informed of his appointment to report 
on Iraqi human rights, Van Der Stoel has not left the United 
Nations in peace. He has appeared overly enthusiastic about his 
mission, rash and reckless in his behavior and statements, and 
unusually unbalanced. These actions have irritated the UN 
secretary general, prompting him to strongly criticize Van Der 
Stoel's actions and tell the ambassadors of the four big powers 
at a meeting once that he knows Van Der Stoel personally, as a 
classmate, and that he knows the man is "reckless and 
unobjective." 
  This, then, is Van Der Stoel; reckless and unobjective as 
certified by UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Ghali himself. 
This is why Van Der Stoel has not stopped creating furors and 
fabricating false allegations against Iraq. 
  This is not all Butrus-Ghali said about Van Der Stoel. He 
also added: "Van Der Stoel thinks that Iraqi human rights issue 
is the only human rights issue in the world!" 
  So why does this Dutch crow keep squawking and lamenting 
Iraqi human rights, and why doesn't he also mention Western 
imperialism's violation of these rights? 
  What is the secret behind Van Der Stoel's reckless, 
unobjective, and unusually enthusiastic attitude toward the 
so-called Iraqi human rights issue? 
  We the Iraqis, who have not appointed Van Der Stoel to 
defend 
our rights, and who refuse to have this reckless man as our 
trustee, have the right to assume that Van Der Stoel has 
received $1 million, or a sum close to that figure, from the Al 
Sabah and Al Sa'ud families. We must assume that it is this 
money that has made him reckless and overly enthusiastic to the 
point of losing his balance and objectivity and behaving in this 
irresponsible way. 
  It is also our right to assume that Van Der Stoel has come 
under pressure from the Zionist lobby, and that it is this lobby 
that is manipulating him and pushing him to cause problems and 
make baseless accusations. 
  In short, we refuse to have this reckless and unobjective 
character as trustee of our rights. Besides, who told them that 
our rights need a reporter or a defender?!

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Press editorials have focused on the bilateral peace 
talks between the heads of Arab and Israeli delegations, noting 
that these talks have so far not resulted in any moves that 
would help the peace process achieve its objectives in 
accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  In an editorial under the headline the "Vicious Circle," 
TISHRIN says: The third week of bilateral peace talks has ended 
in nothing. The suspension of the talks, as requested by the 
Israeli side to hold consultations with its government, has 
resulted in nothing new to advance the peace process. Thus, the 
Washington talks were stalemated again, just like all rounds of 
talks that have been held since the Madrid conference. 
  TISHRIN stresses that Israel is still unwilling to establish 
and make peace or to respond to the requirements of a just and 
comprehensive peace. It is also trying to conceal its evasive 
policies, intransigence, and rejection of the terms of peace in 
an attempt to prolong the talks and undermine their objectives 
and tracks. Israel considers the talks an end, rather than a 
means to achieve a just, comprehensive peace. The paper says 
that in all that, Israel is pursuing the policy of Yitzhaq 
Shamir, who declared that the negotiations will continue for 10 
years. This is in order to change the situation on the ground 
so that the Arabs would have nothing to demand when Israel 
controls all the occupied Arab territories through the 
settlement building. In the context of the same Israeli 
maneuvers, Yitzhaq Rabin made statements which do not differ in 
form or content from the Shamir policy. In his statements, he 
accused Syria of not being serious about the peace process. 
  TISHRIN stresses that by his statements, Rabin wants to 
conceal Israel's objectives and intentions which have not led to 
any positive move for the sake of peace. The paper adds: 
Because its malicious objectives and intentions have been 
exposed, Israel has failed to undermine the Madrid formula. 
Therefore, it began to cast doubts about the U.S. role and its 
effectiveness and to aim its poisoned arrows against the Geneva 
summit. This is because the meeting of Presidents Hafiz al-Asad 
and Bill Clinton has proved beyond any doubt that there will be 
no peace in the region without Syria's leading role in the peace 
process and without the enforcement of the resolutions of 
international legitimacy. 
  Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN stresses that only a 
decision to give up Israel's usurpation and occupation of the 
Arab territories without any conditions as demanded by the 
resolutions of international legitimacy is the key and basis for 
the achievement of a just, comprehensive peace. 
  In an editorial under the headline "The Deception," the 
newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: It is not enough for Shim'on Peres 
to hint at the possibility of evacuating a settlement or two and 
then to claim that Israel is working for peace and that it wants 
to provide the appropriate atmosphere for continuing the 
negotiating process. Nor can he convince anybody that the Rabin 
government has abandoned expansion and settlement schemes and 
that it is now ready to accept the UN Security Council 
resolutions which consider the settlements illegitimate, a 
violation of international law and conventions, and demand their 
immediate removal. Casting doubts about the Israeli position, 
the paper says: Had Israel been truly seeking to prove its 
peace intentions and to push the peace process in the right 
direction, it would have reconsidered its entire settlement 
plans, rather than to evacuate some settlements. 
  The paper stresses that Israel should explicitly and clearly 
declare full commitment to the principles, resolutions, and 
trend of the international legitimacy. It should also accept 
the principle of full withdrawal from all the occupied Arab 
territories. It should also halt the policy of military 
escalation in southern Lebanon and its arbitrary and terrorist 
measures inside the occupied territories. The paper adds: Only 
such moves will convince the Arabs and international community 
of Israel's seriousness about working for a just, comprehensive 
solution in the Middle East. The paper cautions that the 
available peace opportunity is now being threatened by the 
intransigent Israeli stands. Unless there is a fundamental 
change in these stands and unless Israel stops methods of 
maneuvers and deception, the opportunity will be lost, together 
with many hopes for arriving at the aspired solution. 
  Concluding, the paper says: The Arabs have offered all they 
can to maintain this opportunity, and it remains for Israel to 
show enough courage to show interest in not wasting it. This 
can only be achieved when it clearly and explicitly announces 
its acceptance of the conditions of peace, primarily withdrawal 
from all occupied Arab territories.

<F P=106> [From the Press review] </F>
  [Text] Writing about the Syrian-Lebanese summit and the 
unified position of the two countries, TISHRIN says: Presidents 
Hafiz al-Asad and Ilyas al-Hirawi have held talks on enhancing 
fraternal bilateral ties, the peace process, and the continuous 
Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon. 
  TISHRIN notes the continuing Syrian-Lebanese coordination on 
all hot issues, primarily on the peace process and Israel's 
attempts to escape its obligations, especially withdrawal from 
the Golan and southern Lebanon. 
  The paper further highlights Israel's attempts to disturb 
the 
distinguished Syrian-Lebanese relationship and drive Lebanon to 
unilaterally conclude a suspect settlement. Israel is doing 
this through making threats and carrying out attacks. Israel's 
efforts are in vain because the Syrian-Lebanese relationship has 
reached a historic state of cohesion between the two fraternal 
countries. The two countries have faced Israel's prevarications 
and exposed maneuvers with a unified position, whether at the 
Washington talks or directly on the ground. Despite all the 
damage it has done to southern Lebanon, Israel could not make 
Lebanon drop its demand for the entire south or stop its 
coordination with Syria. The two countries share the same 
destiny and security and harm done to one of them harms the 
other. 
  TISHRIN goes on: Experience has shown that the strength of 
Lebanon and Syria lies in their unified position. Israel is 
trying to disengage the two countries and drag them one after 
the other to conclude unilateral, unfair agreements according to 
which part of the territory would be lost. Despite the fact 
that Syria and Lebanon have shown willingness to establish a 
just, comprehensive, and firm peace in the region, Israel has to 
date not pledged, even for once, to withdraw from the Golan and 
southern Lebanon. In fact, it is asking Lebanon to conclude a 
treaty in advance and to make security arrangements. It is 
giving hints to Syria about a partial withdrawal on the Golan 
and that it will conduct a referendum on its fate. If anything, 
this position proves that Israel is taking lightly the peace 
process, the U.S. initiative, Security Council resolutions, and 
the Geneva charters. 
  Syrian-Lebanese coordination is the best reply to such 
outright Israeli intransigence and schemes to undermine 
Lebanon's sovereignty over its territory and Syria's sovereignty 
over the Golan. Syria has proven over the years its 
willingness, in word and deed, to help Lebanon and share its 
bread and butter with it. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN asserts that Syria will remain by 
Lebanon's side. If there are people in Israel who are wagering 
on a Syrian-Lebanese disengagement, they are certainly 
entertaining illusions. The Syrian-Lebanese relationship is 
expected to grow and develop further. Coordination will 
continue in the mutual interest of the two countries and for the 
good of the Arab nation. 
  AL-BA'TH also comments on the importance of cooperation and 
coordination between Syria and Lebanon, as well as the peace 
process and Israel's hard-line approach toward any progress in 
this process. 
  The Syrian-Lebanese summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad 
and Ilyas al-Hirawi reasserts the commitment of the two 
fraternal countries to a just and comprehensive peace, without 
any relinquishment or concession. The two countries also reject 
all Israeli maneuvers and plots aimed at taking on the Arabs one 
at a time and imposing its distorted, incomplete peace. 
  AL-BA'TH says the above principles also consolidate 
Syrian-Lebanese ties, based on cooperation and coordination in 
all fields. These ties are an example of what brotherly 
relations should be like, to serve the one people in the two 
countries and the higher Arab interests. As for the hard-line 
Israeli positions on the peace process, the paper says these 
stands do not leave any room for optimism -- in the short and 
long run -- about prospects for progress in the peace process. 
Israel is still placing more and more hurdles to the bilateral 
talks in Washington by totally refusing to commit itself to the 
major principles on which the peace process was launched, 
primarily Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, and 
the land-for-peace principle. 
  The paper asserts that Israel has greatly benefited from the 
serious achievement it has made on the Arab level by signing the 
Gaza-Jericho accord with the PLO -- an agreement which Israel 
wants as a model for other agreements it wants to conclude with 
the rest of the Arab states involved in the peace process. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: In light of the above, the Arabs had to 
embark on vital, concrete activity to straighten things out. In 
this context came the historic Geneva summit between Presidents 
Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. The summit has succeeded, by 
all standards, in stressing the major foundations of peace and 
crystallizing a general international approach that is committed 
to a just and comprehensive peace that liberates all of the 
occupied Arab territories and restores all usurped rights.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Feb (MENA)--An official security source 
has stated that at around 1430, a device placed on the overhead 
luggage rack in a first-class coach on train no. 980 went off as 
the train traveled from Cairo to Luxor. The explosion occurred 
as the train was passing the village of al-Muti'ah after leaving 
Asyut Station. 
  Some 11 passengers, including six tourists, were injured in 
the explosion. They include: Major Faysal Fattuh al-Wakil of 
Suhaj; Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hayy, a technician in the Arab 
Contractors Company; Faysal Fahmi Adam, an orthopedist at Asyut 
University; Lieutenant Jamal Ahmad Husayn, a resident of Suhaj; 
and Rif'at 'Abd-al-Majid, a train worker. The wounded tourists 
are Angel Ascot and Joe Fix, New Zealand; Ulrike Dolgan and 
Christian Schreiker, Germany; and Grace Casio and Jocelyn 
Clonita, Australia. They were all slightly hurt. All the 
wounded were taken to Asyut University Hospital for treatment. 
  The explosion occurred in the second coach on first class, 
damaging the coach roof and shattering windows. An initial 
examination of the train indicates that the shattered glass 
probably injured the passengers. 
  Leading officers in the Asyut Security Directorate, the 
criminology laboratory, and various detective agencies went to 
the scene and the prosecution was notified to launch an 
investigation. 
  Investigations are under way to determine the circumstances 
surrounding the incident. The train was sent on its way to 
Suhaj then Luxor after an inspection by explosives experts.

  [Excerpt] [Portuguese] Prime Minister Silva and Israeli 
Prime Minister Rabin are at the moment giving a press 
conference. The Middle East peace process and the withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho are obviously key points of this visit. 
Raquel Abecassis reports: 
  [Abecassis] Silva began by congratulating Rabin for being a 
peacemaker in the Middle East. The Israeli Prime Minister 
responded by thanking Silva and stressed the importance of 
Silva's visit to Israel in October 1992. Rabin described it as 
a very important landmark in the development of bilateral 
relations between the two countries. Then the two prime 
ministers went on to speak of the excellent economic, and other, 
relations between the two countries. Rabin is at the moment 
answering questions. The first question was whether he would 
confirm reports that the Israeli government was willing to 
withdraw from the occupied territories of Gaza and Jericho 
within two weeks. Rabin said that the process was still under 
way, he added an agreement on the type of autonomy had not yet 
been reached but he stated that the withdrawal would take place 
soon but not in the next two weeks. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Feb (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today met Ibrahim al-Bishari, Libya's 
permanent representative to the Arab League. 
  Afterward, al-Bishari stated that he and the secretary 
general discussed several recent Western statements, including 
one by U.S. President Bill Clinton that Libya constitutes a 
threat to the United States' national security and another by 
the British defense secretary that Libya is seeking to build a 
nuclear bomb. 
  Al-Bishari voiced astonishment at these statements, pointing 
out that Libya is a small and peaceable nation of under 4 
million people. He pointed out that Britain never discusses 
Israel, which has 200 nuclear warheads, refuses to sign the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and opposes the removal of 
weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, al-Bishari said, 
the Arabs are urging that the Middle East be turned into a 
region free from such weapons. He pointed out that President 
Muhammad Husni Mubarak has made an appeal to this effect. 
  Al-Bishari added that he briefed the Arab League secretary 
general on the latest developments in the Libyan-Western crisis 
and the League's role in averting Western threats. 
  Al-Bishari said Libya is consulting with the members of the 
seven-member Arab committee and the Arab League Secretariat with 
the aim of holding a meeting of the seven-member committee on 
the sidelines of the Arab League Ministerial Council meeting 
next March. He noted that the aim is to find an acceptable 
solution that safeguards Libya's sovereignty and independence 
and averts any tension in the region. 
  Concerning the Libyan proposal to try the two Libyan 
suspects 
in the Hague, al-Bishari said this proposal was submitted by the 
suspects' legal counsel committee, since the issue is a legal 
one and concerns the two suspects and their lawyers. 
  Al-Bishari asserted that Libya, as a state, wants the trial 
to be held at the International Court of Justice but to be 
presided over by a Scottish tribunal if Scotland agrees. He 
announced that this is the most flexibility that Libya can show. 
  He recalled that his country has taken numerous initiatives 
since the crisis began and added that Libya does not reject the 
principle of holding a trial because it believes that a trial is 
bound to reveal the truth. He said Libya is convinced of its 
two citizens' innocence and that the world will learn the truth 
and realize how great an injustice has been done to the 
peaceable Libyan people.

  [Editorial Report] Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic on 23 February 
publishes a front-page 300-word unattributed article in which it 
claims that it has obtained a copy of a letter sent to Libyan 
Leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi by Abu-Nidal (Sabri al-Banna), 
leader of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council. The paper says that 
this "secret letter" shows that Abu-Nidal wants to return to the 
lap of Tripoli. 
  The paper also publishes a photocopy of the letter, which is 
dated 22 December 1993. The following is the text of the letter: 
  "Brother Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the 1 September 
revolution, may God preserve you. 
  "Sincere Arab greetings, 
  "O great Arab leader, I send you my sincerest Arab good 
wishes and through you to the struggling and mujahid Libyan 
masses, which today are rallying around you to express their 
unity and reaffirm their choice and affiliation. 
  "Your voice which reverberated among the Bani Salim masses 
on 
28 jumada al-thani 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 12 December 
1993, has been the best expression of the nation's will and its 
right to life and proof of existence. 
  "Brother leader of the 1 September revolution, 
  "The Arab nation's masses have heard your powerful voice 
with 
awareness and heard you reaffirming the unity of its causes and 
defending them as an integrated whole, even if some rulers do 
not want that. The Palestinian popular revolution is looking 
toward you and the stone-throwing children are listening to you 
attentively. Your reverberating voice comes when the Arab 
revolution's forces, both Arabists and Islamists, are looking 
toward Arab Tripoli which is subjected to the ugliest form of 
blockade by the Western American circles and their tools. Your 
voice has reaffirmed the originality of the 1 September 
revolution and the credibility of its leader in order to silence 
those of the fifth column and the tools of doubt, treachery, and 
plotting. 
  "Brother leader of the revolution, 
  "It pleases me to reiterate to you, given my position as a 
fighting soldier affiliated to the nation's pan-Arab revolution 
and in order to defend the nation's causes, that my comrades and 
I will always be sincere and faithful soldiers in defense of any 
part of the greater Arab homeland. 
  "To You, the leader, we send the fragrance of Palestine and 
the greetings of its children with best and sincerest regards. 
  "Revolution until victory. 
  ""[Signed] Your brother, Abu-Nidal"

  [Text] A Palestinian spokesman has announced the following: 
  Operations of violence and killings have recently been 
escalating in the occupied Palestinian territories. This 
violence has deliberately been directed against our students and 
children by the Israeli Army and armed settlers which has 
constituted a serious precedent especially after the signing of 
the Cairo agreement. However, in the same breath, we do not 
agree with and rather denounce the attack on women and 
especially the pregnant among them as happened recently in the 
killing of a settler, which is in contrast with Arab and Islamic 
ethics. 
  This escalation harms the peace process. Self-restraint is 
required from everyone, especially toward the unarmed peaceful 
civilians.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Provision of American Defense Equipment to </F>
India; a Cause of Anxiety to Pakistani Policy Makers"] 
  [Text] According to reports emanating from world mass 
media, two American ordnance companies have offered to supply 
sophisticated electronics defense equipment to India. This 
offer made by American companies to India reflects a shift in 
American policy on South Asia and the contradictions of the U.S. 
leadership. By the end of last year, the Clinton administration 
had warned India to desist from making indigenous production of 
military equipment that may flare up a war frenzy. Hence, in 
consonance with this policy, the United States has refused to 
provide super computers to India and has also prevented Russia 
from providing the latter with rocket engines, which may be used 
in the manufacture of long-range missiles. To discourage India 
from producing sophisticated weapons indigenously, the U.S. 
Government also threatened India that if it manufactures such 
equipment at home, the United States would sell materials for 
the manufacture of AWACS planes to Pakistan. After this 
warning, India obviously halted work on the AWACS system at home 
and began talks with the United States for the purchase of 
latest equipment for its air force. However, after the offer of 
the American companies, besides manufacturing latest equipment, 
India will be able to achieve indigenous production of AWACS. 
This way, the Indian Air Force will have superiority in the 
region. The Indian Air Force is already more powerful than its 
counterparts in Pakistan and other countries of the region. 
  This state of affairs is greatly regrettable. This is the 
reality and every Pakistani with any common sense is fully aware 
of the fact that the Americans are totally insincere people, and 
when their is purpose served, they become indifferent. During 
the Afghan war, the United States needed Pakistan. Despite 
great risks, Pakistan decided to confront Russia. At that time, 
the United States did not have any objection to Pakistan's 
nuclear program. Now strong pressure is being exerted on 
Pakistan to roll back this nuclear program, because now the 
United States does not need Pakistan to forestall Russian 
influence. On the contrary, after the downfall of Russia as the 
superpower, the American policy makers are not only ignoring 
Pakistan but also are encouraging India on several issues, which 
is a cause for concern to the political circles and the people 
of Pakistan. 
  The offer of sophisticated military equipment to India by 
the 
American firms is a cause of anxiety to our policy makers. They 
should make a careful study of the offer and review the 
motivations and inspiration behind it. Pakistan is not Nepal, 
Sri Lanka, or the Maldives. It cannot accept the hegemony of 
India. However, by joining hands with other regional countries, 
Pakistan can prepare programs that will be beneficial to all the 
countries of South Asia. With the help of our neighbors, we can 
make this region a zone of peace, which ensures the 
independence, security, and the effective protection of the 
territorial boundaries of the countries in it. We hope that 
other regional countries are also not ready to accept the 
hegemony of India and that they will join hands and cooperate 
with Pakistan to make the region a zone of peace. We will 
request that the Government of Pakistan lodge a strong protest 
against the offer of sophisticated defense equipment to India by 
the American firms. Pakistan should launch an effective 
diplomatic campaign to assure the American leadership that 
Pakistan cannot tolerate Indian hegemony and its policing. 
  It is also imperative to inform the American leadership that 
the Indian leadership is making threats of dire consequences to 
Pakistan because of its moral and political support to the 
freedom struggle of the Kashmiri people. Pakistan does not have 
any militaristic or expansionist designs. We would also request 
that the Indian Government review the situation at home in the 
global context with a cool head and in a relaxed way and adopt a 
policy to coexist with other countries of the region, including 
Pakistan, on the basis of the principles of peaceful 
coexistence. We would also suggest that the Indian leadership 
fulfill its pledges made to the United Nations, grant the right 
of self-determination to the people of Kashmir, and concentrate 
on eradicating the poverty of its own people instead of 
browbeating and making threats of dire consequences to Pakistan.

  [Text] In light of the current situation and its 
developments since the signing of the document of pledge and 
accord in Amman, an official source has made the following 
statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA': 
  Following the signing of the pledge and accord document, and 
amid the joy and happiness which prevailed throughout the Yemeni 
homeland on this occasion, the masses of the people were 
surprised at the refusal of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
leadership to return to the capital of the homeland and to 
convene the state legislative and executive institutions to 
embark on the practical implementation of the document 
provisions. Instead of showing concern for the immediate 
implementation of the document following its signing, the YSP 
leadership paid visits abroad that were not agreed on and 
without the knowledge of the state presidency or the Foreign 
Ministry which are charged by the Constitution with running the 
foreign affairs of the Republic of Yemen. 
  This shows that the YSP leadership is not interested in the 
immediate implementation of the pledge and accord document. 
Instead of ending the crisis, this would further escalate it 
and continue its dangers despite the fact that all have agreed 
that the signing of the pledge and accord document came to put 
an end to the crisis and to immediately move to the practical 
implementation of all provisions of the pledge and accord 
document. 
  As we reiterate our full concern to develop and reinforce 
the 
ties of fraternity, cordiality, and joint cooperation between 
the Republic of Yemen and all its sisterly and friendly states; 
and as we reiterate our commitment to expand these relations -- 
despite all that could be created by the contacts of the YSP 
leadership -- any effort that does not stem from constitutional 
legitimacy and common responsibility cannot yield fruit. 
  As we greatly appreciate the good intentions with which 
these 
sisterly countries welcomed some leaders of the YSP, proceeding 
from their strong fraternal relations with the Republic of 
Yemen, this stand by the party blatantly conflicts with the 
interests of the homeland and with the provisions of the pledge 
and accord document. This also coincides with the military 
escalation represented by moving the al-Wahdah Brigade from the 
Hadramaut Governorate and the subsequent move of 30 tanks from 
the city of Aden to the Abyan Governorate which took place on 21 
February. This is despite the fact that instructions and orders 
have been issued by the chairman of the Presidential Council and 
the supreme commander of the Armed Forces not to move any 
military units in compliance with the Constitution and the 
provisions of the pledge and accord document to save the 
citizens of the Abyan Governorate from the suffering they have 
been experiencing as a result of this military escalation. 
  All this confirms the existence of premeditated intentions 
aimed at foiling the implementation of the pledge and accord 
document and at obstructing all good offices aimed at ending the 
bloodshed, protecting the unity, and reinforcing democracy. 
This also reiterates the existence of these premeditated 
intentions before and after the final signing of the document as 
well as the objective of harming the homeland's unity, 
sovereignty, security, and stability. 
  This requires all members of our people, our Armed Forces, 
and security organs to be on maximum alert to prevent the 
realization of these suspicious intentions that are covered by a 
media campaign, which employs deception and trickery, and 
incites sectarian, fractional, and tribal problems aimed to 
divide Yemen after this great unionist achievement was realized 
for our people on 22 May 1990 in a peaceful and democratic 
manner. 
  The document of pledge and accord emphasized that its 
implementation requires a strong political will that is united 
in words and deeds, fulfillment of promises, honesty, and 
commitment. All of this urges everybody to respect the 
responsibility of their signatures before the public opinion 
inside and abroad. 
  Regrettably, we see the YSP's leadership behaving in a 
different manner than what had been agreed on. Since the first 
moments after the signing ceremony in Amman, this leadership 
followed a policy based on disavowal of the pledge and accord 
document and disassociating itself from commitment to the 
people's collective will and the democratic option. This 
behavior harms the unity of the homeland and people at present 
and in the future. 
  Our national duties and responsibilities call on us to 
continue to adhere to unity and democracy, and to inform the 
masses and all political parties and organizations, scholars, 
and social figures of the seriousness of the current situation, 
for which the YSP's leadership bears complete responsibility 
since the beginning of the crisis on 19 August 1993. This 
leadership practically emphasizes its rejection to commit itself 
to the document of pledge and accord, and its insistence on 
escalating the crisis and situation, and on keeping the country 
suffering from the political crisis. This will only serve the 
enemies of unity and democracy. 
  We will not spare any effort to keep the public opinion 
informed of all facts and developments. 
  We pray God to guide all to the right path, He is the best 
Lord and supporter.

  [Text] 'Udayy, the son of the tyrant Saddam, has leveled

is run by the crusader Tariq Hanna 'Aziz. 'Udayy, the failure, 
said in an article published in his own paper, BABIL, that his 
father's regime should not rely on its current foreign policy to 
lift or ease the international sanctions, saying that the regime 
did not obtain anything from the United Nations in exchange for 
the [word indistinct] overflights over Iraq and the imposition 
of long-term monitoring of its installations. 
  Observers think that 'Udayy is trying to hold the Foreign 
Ministry responsible for Saddam's follies. He also attributed 
the slump in the Iraqi dinar to the [word indistinct] ministry. 
  'Udayy's criticism comes in the wake of rumors that Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf will be dismissed from the Foreign Minister's 
post in a new cabinet reshuffle.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "U.S. Concern Over Closer Ties </F>
Between Iran and Pakistan"] 
  [Text] The head of the foreign relations committee in the 
U.S. House of Representatives, Mr. Lee Hamilton, in an article 
which appeared in yesterday's issue of the daily NEW YORK TIMES, 
has stressed what he has described as the danger of 
Pakistan-Iran closeness, calling on the U.S. Administration to 
reconsider its ties with Pakistan and provide the ground for the 
improvement of Washington-Islamabad ties. 
  The noteworthy point in Mr. Hamilton's article is that he 
has 
expressed concern over the reduced U.S. influence in Pakistan 
and increased influence of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
China in that country. Besides, he has also mentioned the often 
repeated claim that Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons. 
  The article is worth pondering from two aspects. First, as 
has been confirmed by the world bodies, including the exports of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, Iran has no plan 
whatsoever to use nuclear energy for military purposes. And 
second, what the U.S. official has described as the so-called 
increasing influence of Iran and China in Pakistan are actually 
the joint efforts of the three countries, coupled with their 
good will, to expand regional cooperation. 
  In the political lexicon of the White House the word 
influence actually means to be forerunner of domination whereas 
the foundation of Iran's ties with Pakistan, by being away from 
any political ups and downs, is based on the principle of good 
neighborly ties and nonintervention in each other's affairs and 
is set on the track of making these ties evermore stronger. 
  Meanwhile China considers Iran as a very important country 
in 
west Asia, specially in the Persian Gulf, which has a strategic 
role in maintaining peace and stability in the region. Iran and 
China have had very high trade exchanges during the recent years 
and in addition to Pakistan's stability and the recent visit to 
Iran by the prime minister of that country, Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, 
have depicted a very bright prospect for the future of the 
Pakistan-Iran ties. 
  If we also take into account China's serious inclination of 
expanding ties with the Economic Cooperation Organization, ECO, 
we can understand the very roots of the U.S. fear from closeness 
between Iran and Pakistan. Trade exchanges in the region, which 
spreads from South Asia to Caucasia and Central Asia, with China 
being next door, means the creation of a strong and independent 
economic pole in the world; the world over which the United 
States wants to establish its economic domination under the 
cover of the new world order. This, and nothing else, is the 
main cause of concern for the head of the foreign relations 
committee in the U.S. House of Representatives.

<F P=106> [IRNA commentary: "Allegations on Human Rights Violation a </F>
Political Ploy"] 
  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 22, IRNA -- Independent observers 
interpret the allegation made against Iran on human rights 
violation by the U.N. envoy as a means to exert political 
pressure on Iran. 
  In his recent report the special envoy of the U.N. Human 
Rights Commission, Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, with the intent to 
damage Iran's image in the world public opinion , has charged 
Iran with cases including violation of political and social 
freedoms and terrorism. 
  This is while Iranian officials, incuding the Head of the 
Judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, have termed the allegations 
biased and a political ploy to pressure Iran. 
  The pressure is of course by the Western powers that do not 
favor Iran's active role in the region and its independent 
stance with regard to such important regional development as 
Gaza-Jericho compromise deal. 
  Stressing the existence of political and social freedom in 
the country, Iranian officials state that all the points 
mentioned in the constitutional law on the precise observation 
of individual rights and the preservation of the rights of the 
religious minorities are respected and practiced in Iran. 
  The existence of freedom of activity for political groups, 
the progressive nature of laws and judicial system of the 
country and freedom enjoyed by the religious minorities prove 
this fact. This has been confirmed by leaders of religious 
minorities and independent observers who have visited Iran. 
  The restatement of these allegations and unfounded matters 
about human rights violation in Iran at Western circles and mass 
media has created numerous questions. 
  Galindo Pohl's report which is a repetition of previous 
claims was published following the massive Feb. 11 rallies 
(marking the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic 
revolution in 1979). 
  To any impartial observer, the rally was full of meanings 
and 
implications and removed numerous doubts instilled in the world 
public opinion about the popularity of the Islamic government in 
Iran. 
  On the other hand, the report should be considered connected 
with the firm stances recently taken by the Iranian official in 
condemning the genocide of Bosnian Muslims by the Serbs and the 
compromise accord in the Middle East. 
  The fact that five years have passed since the issuance of 
the verdict on the apostate Salman Rushdie, the author of the 
Satanic Verses, and the futile political and economic pressures 
by the West on the Islamic Republic of Iran to revoke the 
verdict can be mentioned as other reasons behind presentation of 
this report. 
  Exertion of pressure to make Iran compromise and move along 
with the policies of the West is the main goal that the United 
States and its allies constantly are pursuing by publicizing 
such false claims. This is while Galindo Pohl's colleagues have 
overlooked human rights violations in the countries allied with 
the United States. 
  Another important point in this report and similar claims is 
that Iran is accused of state terrorism when it is a major 
victim of terrorism itself and this is something that those 
claiming to support human rights have always ignored. 
  The recent assassination attempt on the life of the Iranian 
president Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani on Feb. 1 during the Ten-Day 
Dawn inauguration ceremonies (marking the anniversary of the 
victory of the Islamic revolution in 1979) and the November 29 
hijacking of a Fokker friendship passenger plane belonging to 
the Oil Ministry to Iraq are among more recent cases, not to 
mention over a decade of post-revolution victimization of the 
Iranian nation at the hands of Western-supported terrorist 
outfits. 
  The allegations on human rights are brought forth at a time 
when tens of thousands of innocent Muslim Bosnian children and 
women are being martyred in the heart of Europe and hundreds of 
thousands are facing the prospect of being massacred or raped. 
  The outrageous violations of the rights of the Muslim 
Palestinian nation by the Zionists are among other issues which 
have been neglected in the files of the so-called human rights 
organizations. 
  The double standard in dealing with the world events by 
international organizations is not something that Muslim nations 
can overlook.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] The 30th session of the UN Commission on Narcotic 
Drugs opened in Damascus yesterday. The Tehran Declaration, 
which was approved in 1371 [year beginning 21 March 1992] by all 
members, is the most important focus of the session. During the 
Damascus conference, the latest developments concerning drug 
smuggling in the Middle East and the way to confront poppy 
cultivation and the laundering of money obtained from drug 
trafficking will be discussed. 
  During the past decade the Middle East has witnessed an 
increase in drug production, so much so that some countries in 
the area have become major heroin and opium exporters. Pakistan 
and Afghanistan are among the countries facing increasing 
difficulties from an increase in poppy cultivation despite the 
struggles by their police forces. In areas in Pakistan that are 
far from the central government and outside the control of the 
police force, drug smugglers are manufacturing and refining 
narcotics in large laboratories. The existence of remote 
mountainous regions in Pakistan and civil wars and conflicts in 
Afghanistan for many years have paved the grounds for the growth 
of drug trafficking groups and the conversion of wheat fields 
into fields for the cultivation of narcotics. 
  Unfortunately, because of its location on the international 
drug transit route from the Golden Crescent to Europe, Iran has 
gained special importance in the Middle East for large drug 
trafficking groups. Thus, the major problem that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is facing in its fight against the big drug 
networks is, more than anything else, the problem of regional 
smuggling that is carried out from outside its borders. 
Smugglers enter the country primarily through the 1,400-km long 
eastern border and attempt to transfer narcotics to Europe. 
  On this basis, in our country special programs have been 
introduced, including the establishment of border observation 
posts and roving and stationary bases, the creation of a 
prohibitive zone in part of the border region, and ambush and 
destruction operations, all of which have helped to destroy many 
networks. 
  During recent years, because of more control on the eastern 
border and increased field operations, large narcotics bands 
have decided to alter their transit routes. Some from the 
southern route have chosen Persian Gulf countries, while others 
from the northern route have chosen Central Asian countries. 
However, Iran continues to be considered the major route. 
  On this basis, efforts by law enforcement forces have 
intensified and the number of narcotic finds are increasing each 
year. For example, the quantity of narcotics found during the 
past 11 months increased 25 tonnes from the same period last 
year. 
  On the regional level, as a pivotal country in the Economic 
Cooperation Organization [ECO], the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
started new operations within its framework. In the future, a 
memorandum of understanding is to be signed between Iran and 
Pakistan, with UN cooperation, under which the control of drugs 
in the region will be further facilitated and coordinated. 
  The Islamic Republic's efforts in the Middle East have led 
to 
praises by the UN secretary general's executive deputy in charge 
of narcotics control and by the Interpol secretary general. 
Iran is trying--through regional cooperation and by 
intensifying the struggle at home--to create a healthier and 
better society for the younger generation. Within this context, 
the continuation of the struggle and a more serious approach in 
implementing the law- enforcement forces' programs are of great 
importance.

  [Text] Tehran, 25 Azar [16 Dec] -- The number of students 
at the expert guidance and doctoral levels has been increased 
for higher education in the Second Five-Year Plan. 
  Dr. Hashemi-Golpayegani, minister of culture and higher 
education, announced the above at the 14th conference of 
educational deputies from universities and institutions of 
higher education. He discussed the shortage of professors and 
programs at this ministry. He said: This ministry must create an 
adequate incentive to attract Iranian specialists outside the 
country. Likewise, special facilities and resources must be 
created for teachers and instructors working at the universities 
to continue their studies to higher levels and programs. 
  The minister of culture and higher education said: The 
Ministry of Culture and Higher Education has given the 
ministries and government organizations the prerogatives to 
enable them to meet the needs of the ministries and government 
organizations. 
  Dr. Salehi, deputy minister of culture and higher education 
also announced during a speech: Based on the provisions that 
have been made, by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, we will 
have about 46,000 expert guidance students and 5,000 doctoral 
students. He added: There are now about 16,000 students studying 
in expert guidance and doctoral programs.

  [Text] Economics Division. Subsidies will be paid in the 
nation's Second Five-Year Economic Development Plan to producers 
and buyers of housing who conform to the regulations of the 
Ministry of Housing and Urban Construction. 
  These subsidies will be direct and will constitute 6 to 10 
percent of the facilities received from banks for building or 
buying housing. 
  The minister of housing and urban construction said these 
subsidies will total 1,314 billion rials during the Second 
Five-Year Plan. 
  Engineer 'Abbas Ahmad-Akhundi, speaking yesterday to a group 
of reporters, added: The rate for the banking facilities 
received for housing in the Second Five-Year Plan and in next 
year's budget is 15 percent, and this rate will be the same for 
both large and small units. 
  He said: Based on the Second Five-Year Plan, the ceiling on 
subsidies for mass builders who build housing for teachers and 
those who have sacrificed will be 10 percent. 
  An 8-percent rate will be given to other government mass 
builders and a 6-percent rate will be given to individuals 
undertaking housing construction, provided that regulations are 
observed. 
  Akhundi mentioned the policy of increasing rental housing 
units in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] as one of 
the Ministry of Housing and Urban Construction's programs. He 
added: Low-cost capital will be provided to individuals who 
build rental units or rental purchase units. 
  He discussed the conditions for giving subsidies to those 
who 
build housing units. He said: As in the First Five-Year Plan, in 
the Second Five-Year Plan land will be transferred at the 
finished cost. The new policy of paying direct subsidies applies 
both to the builder and the user of housing. 
  Continuing, Akhundi added: In the Second Five-Year Plan, 
means will be given through the creation of housing savings 
funds to individuals who have accounts in these funds. To solve 
the housing problem, the government intends to mobilize low-cost 
capital resources to minimize the cost of completion. 
  He discussed the ministry's policy to expedite activities in 
the new cities. He said: To carry out the work of preparation 
and infrastructure installations in the industrial cities, we 
will support private sector capital. Of course, the relevant 
costs will still be obtained from the applicants. 
  Akhundi discussed the production of standard construction 
materials. He said: In the Second Five-Year Plan this ministry's 
Center for Construction and Housing has been required to obtain 
samples from units producing construction materials and to 
approve or not approve the products from the aforementioned 
units, and violators will be dealt with in accordance with 
regulations. 
  He explained: In the Second Five-Year Plan the policy to 
decrease foundation size, to produce mass housing, to support 
the low-income classes and to improve rural housing is on the 
government's agenda. 
  Likewise the Ownership and Rental Law will be amended with 
the goal of further spreading the culture of renting.

  [Text] The sum of 1,421 billion rials [Rls] has been 
provided for investment in industrial sector work in the Second 
Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan. 
  Engineer Mohammad Reza Ne'matzadeh, minister of industries, 
gave a press conference in which he announced the above. He 
said: Of this amount, Rls482 billion is for the difference 
between subsidies and banking facilities, Rls820 billion is for 
semicomplete projects, and Rls110 billion is for development and 
application research and study. 
  He added: In this ministry's organizational plan, in the 
event investments are made, Rls20,000 billion are provided by 
the government and the private sector, and the growth of 
industry's added value is to be 6.2 percent. If the budget is 
not procured and there is no government support, we will not 
achieve this goal in the Second Five-Year Plan. 
  The minister of industries cited as the industrial sector's 
main goals in the Second Five-Year Economic and Social 
Development Plan the giving of roots to industrial production, 
increasing the profitability of production and raising its 
usability, making the desired use of existing industrial 
capacities, increasing the competitiveness of the nation's 
industrial production on international markets, increasing 
industrial employment, raising society's standard of living and 
protecting the environment. 
  Engineer Ne'matzadeh then discussed the importance of the 
technical studies and development and application research 
sectors. He said: To achieve this goal Rls150 billion will have 
to be invested, and the Plan and Budget Organization has 
confirmed Rls110 billion of this amount. 
  Continuing, the minister of industries discussed the fact 
that in the First Five-Year Economic Development Plan 180 
research and development units were created in production units. 
He emphasized the necessity to increase these units in the 
Second Five-Year Plan. He said: It is expected that this number 
will triple under the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: Since the 
position of research in this country is quite low, it is 
necessary that the government give attention to this sector. 
  This sector needs to have Rls600 billion credit allocated to 
it from the development budget. If these credits are obtained we 
will see 2 percent added value in this sector. 
  Engineer Ne'matzadeh cited aid in the creation of industrial 
infrastructure as another of this ministry's aims. He said: To 
create industrial villages, in view of the increase in the price 
of foreign exchange, credit of Rls350 billion is needed. 
  He then discussed the proposed notes that pertain to the 
deprived areas. He added: The portion of profits from companies 
and economic activities that is used to invest in the priority 
areas will be tax exempt. 
  He also added: In the annual budgets the government is 
required to allocate the credits needed to procure 
infrastructure resources including water, electrical power, gas, 
access roads and industrial villages, in such a way that at 
least 70 percent of the costs for preparing industrial villages 
or industrial and mining projects located in the nation's 
deprived areas and 50 percent of the costs of preparing other 
industrial villages in the municipalities which are not province 
centers will be paid out of the development budgets. 
  The minister of industries continued: To implement policies 
that encourage and reinforce development and spread industries 
and mines in the deprived areas, the government is required to 
pay 50 percent of the annual costs of consumer electricity, as 
well as the foreman's and worker shares and social insurance 
premiums in the industrial and mining units located in the 
nation's deprived and underprivileged areas. This money will 
come from part of the revenues obtained through customs levies 
and commercial profits taxes on imported goods. 
  Engineer Ne'matzadeh complained about the Plan and Budget 
Organization's cut in the proposed budget for the Industrial 
Planning Council. He said: Because industry and employment must 
be created in the country and the share of the nation's 
appropriate export must be increased, these changes will create 
problems to some extent for the industrial sector. 
  He then discussed progress of hardware in the nation's 
industries in the First Five-Year Plan. He said: In the Second 
Five-Year Plan attention has also been given to the development 
of software. 
  The minister of industries said: In view of the fact that 
the 
electronics industry is undergoing striking growth in the 
country while in Iran electronics makes up only 0.2 percent of 
GNP [gross national product], to support development research 
and innovation and to advance this industry, an Electronics 
Industries Development Support Fund will be created. 
  In the area of exports he also discussed matters such as the 
establishment of insurance for exports, the provision of credit 
facilities for exporters, the creation of a permanent exhibition 
for industrial export goods, activation of the committee to 
develop nonoil exports, activation of commercial representation 
by opening exports in foreign countries, and other things. 
  In conclusion he asked researchers, writers, and translators 
to contact this ministry and make use of its available 
facilities if they have foreign books and articles and are 
having problems getting them printed and published.

  [Text] Tehran, 2 Dey [23 Dec] (KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News 
Service) -- Following the resignation of Seyyed Mohammad 
Asghari, supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute, His Holiness 
Ayatollah Khamene'i, leader of the revolution, issued an order 
appointing Hoseyn Shari'atmadari as his representative and 
supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute. 
  The text of the order appointing the new supervisor of the 
KEYHAN Institute is as follows: 
  In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate 
  Mr. Hoseyn Shari'atmadari, may your successes continue: 
  In view of the resignation of Seyyed Mohammad Asghari and 
with appreciation for his continuous and concerned effort as a 
worthy cultural leader, I appoint you, an esteemed public figure 
with high merit and an unusual record of revolutionary and 
cultural service from an exalted family of martyrs, as my 
representative and supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute. 
  KEYHAN is a great institution and has vast capacities. It is 
necessary to make the best use of this asset for the growth and 
advancement of the thought, culture, and awareness of the dear 
nation of Iran. 
  The press in Islamic and revolutionary Iran has a great 
responsibility on its shoulders to guide thought, explain the 
truth, and defend against the assaults of foreigners. 
Indifference towards the intellectual needs of the nation of 
Iran and indifference to their Islamic and revolutionary 
aspirations, which is evident in some of the nation's current 
press, is an evil that will not be forgiven in the judgment of 
our people now or in the future, and ultimately before the court 
of God in the hereafter. Rebellion and opposition to these 
aspirations unfortunately also exists in a number of 
publications, which abuse the freedoms to which the Islamic 
Republic of Iran adheres, and this will not be forgotten. 
  KEYHAN is a publication that, praise God, has advanced on 
the 
path of growth and interests and has not been contaminated. Even 
so, this institution is expected to make its positive role as 
prominent and profound as possible, and to advance all its 
affiliated publications to the highest level possible. 
  In this great mission, you must ask for guidance, success 
and 
help from God and you must make use of the aid of worthy 
colleagues, consultants, and committed and skilled executive 
officers. You must earn the confidence of the people by doing 
good work, speaking the truth, exercising literary courage, 
employing the powerful Persian language in conveying 
information, and doing all these things while maintaining the 
direction of the Islam of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the 
principles of the Islamic revolution. You must make the results 
of your efforts available to as many minds as possible in this 
talented, outstanding and great nation. 
  May God help you and your respected colleagues and may you 
receive the special grace of His Holiness, may Almighty God 
preserve him.

  Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i 
<H5>  Biography of Hoseyn Shari'atmadari </H5>
  Hoseyn Shari'atmadari was born in 1326 [21 March 1947-20 
March 1948] in Damavand and graduated in microbiology from the 
Tehran University Medical College. 
  While a student he worked to spread Islamic culture and to 
promote the views and theories of His Holiness the Imam (peace 
be upon him) along with great martyrs such as Ayatollah Sa'idi, 
Professor Motahari, Dr. Bahonar and other dear ones. He was very 
active in the Islamic struggles against the oppressive monarchy. 
For this reason, he was arrested by the SAVAK in the year 1354 
[21 March 1975-20 March 1976] and was severely tortured in the 
oppressive monarchy's prisons. 
  With the triumph of the Islamic revolution, he was released 
from prison along with other political prisoners by the Muslim 
people of our country. 
  After the triumph of the Islamic revolution, Shari'atmadari 
joined Islamic groups in establishing the Islamic government. 
  During the sacred defense he was active at the fronts and 
was 
even severely wounded once. 
  The new supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute has various 
writings. In recent years he has cooperated closely with the 
nation's press and cultural centers such as the newspaper KEYHAN 
and the weekly publication KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, by writing numerous 
political and cultural articles.

  [Text] Tehran, 26 Dey [16 Jan] (KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News 
Service) -- In a speech to a group of members of the Editorial 
Board of KEYHAN newspaper, the supervisor of the KEYHAN 
Institute emphasized: The newspapers must deal with the problems 
afflicting society and the people and they must carry the 
message of Islam and the nation. 
  In his first appearance before a gathering of KEYHAN's 
reporters, Hoseyn Shari'atmadari, the vice-regent's 
representative and supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute, discussed 
the heavy mission of the press in presenting culture and ideas. 
He added: Today writers are seen as the standard-bearers in the 
clash between media and cultures. In this arena, nothing is 
accomplished by media with no message. 
  The vice-regent's representative in the KEYHAN Institute 
gave 
his view concerning criticism in the press as follows: As the 
leader of the revolution said, the Islamic government is like a 
battle front, where no one aims his rifle at himself. This is 
true, but this does not mean that if someone sees someone else 
sleeping in this trenches he will not startle him awake, or that 
you do not remind a trench builder when he neglects to make 
earthworks. Criticism must be constructive, and the language of 
friends differs from the language of enemies. 
  Elsewhere in his talk, Shari'atmadari said: The late Imam 
(peace be upon him) said concerning the press that both what is 
written and what is not written must be evaluated. The press 
must bear the message of Islam and the nation and it must be 
used for their growth and advancement. 
  During this meeting Mehdi Nasiri, manager of the newspaper 
KEYHAN, discussed the criticism that is made of this newspaper. 
He said: In the last few years some of the Western media as well 
as publications printed outside the country affiliated with the 
counterrevolutionary minigroups have been hostile towards 
KEYHAN, but this opposition has no result other than to 
strengthen our belief that we are right. 
  Nasiri added: Some domestic forces are also counted among 
KEYHAN's critics. We never consider ourselves free of mistakes 
and without need of criticism or reminders, and we even act on 
the basis of much of the criticism, but if people sometimes want 
KEYHAN to change its line and to retreat from its basic 
positions, I say that we have chosen this path consciously and 
with much consultation and consideration of interests, and we 
will continue it.

<H3>  Oil Revenues in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] and 
Foreign Debts </H3>
<H5>  [Part 1] </H5>

  The general revenues of the country for 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995], projected at 33,767 billion rials[Rls], 
indicate an increase of 42.5 percent compared to the general 
revenues for this year. Considering the substantial decrease in 
the price of oil and the inability to achieve the anticipated 
revenues this year, no clear, hopeful prospects exist regarding 
oil next year. The disagreement of the members of OPEC regarding 
the reduction in the production ceiling, the increase in North 
Sea oil production, the decrease in the cost of oil excavation 
by non-OPEC countries, and the probability of the entry of Iraq 
into the world market indicate an uncertain future in terms of 
the price of oil. 
  In the United States, it has been projected that if small 
oil 
companies suffer losses due to the decrease in the price of oil, 
they should somehow receive subsidies. Also, the non-OPEC 
oil-producing countries do not need to raise the price of oil, 
as they apparently make more of a profit at low prices. In 
addition, the oppressive powers will likely force Saudi Arabia 
to increase production in order to keep prices down. 
  In the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] proposed budget, 
the government has projected oil revenues at $12.45 billion, 
which for the above reasons seems unrealistic. This figure has 
been reduced to $9,444,000,000 in the joint meeting of the 
Economic and Finance and Planning and Budget Committees and to 
$10.5 billion in the joint meeting of the Petroleum Affairs and 
Planning and Budget Committees. 
  The figure of $10.5 billion arrived at in the Petroleum 
Affairs and Planning and Budget Committees is based on the 
premise that OPEC will lower its production ceiling, and from 
this perspective the export of 2.1 million barrels per day has 
been calculated at $13 per barrel. Certainly, if the OPEC 
members come to this agreement, that is, to reduce the 
production ceiling, and act on it, the above-mentioned price 
will materialize. But, as was pointed out, this is doubtful. 
Such a determination does not exist at the present time, and 
other OPEC members do not support it. The projection of the 
joint meeting of the Economic and Finance and Planning and 
Budget Committees seems closer to reality. 
  Based on a projected oil-demand model, which is dependent on 
growth in the industrial countries, the price of oil and the 
price of one fuel, such as coal, have been considered. With the 
anticipated growth of 1 percent in industrial countries, the 
OPEC base price next year is figured at $11. Given this figure, 
the price of Iranian oil on the average will be $2 less than 
this amount, and even $9,444,000,000 might not materialize. 
  If the world oil market improves next year, steps can be 
taken to repay the deferred debts. Also, if in the first six 
months of 1373 [21 March-22 September 1994] oil revenues go 
beyond projections, the projects can be prioritized and the next 
projects implemented as well. New projects must not be started 
on the basis of the above revenues, because they will not 
achieve results on time. 
  This year, there were $19.5 billion in outstanding debts, of 
which in the first nine months of this year about $6 billion 
were paid, about $3 billion have been credited, and we have 
about $8 billion in late payments. Considering that the late 
payments will reach $10 billion by the end of this year, it 
would seem that if the oil revenues are achieved, the repayment 
of these debts will be given priority. While there is no clear 
program for the repayment of debts, it cannot be determined what 
amount of the foreign currency that is gained can be converted 
into rials and deposited in the government treasury. 
  The schedule of payment of foreign debts is the first and 
foremost issue that must be clarified before any decision 
concerning the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget is 
made. Next year, about $6 billion in debts will be due. The 
situation of the payment of these debts must be clarified. 
  Because of the delay in the payment of debts, the country's 
foreign trade now faces problems, which must be resolved. At 
present, due to the lack of cooperation of foreign companies and 
banking networks, goods are purchased at a 20-30 percent higher 
rate. 
  Government insurance has also stopped. If the situation with 
regard to the schedule of debt payments is not clarified, even 
on the minimum oil revenue accounts cannot be opened. 
Clarification must be made for next year concerning the amount 
of oil revenues that must be spent on making the late payments 
and outstanding obligations, what amount will be spent on set 
purchases, and what amount of foreign currency will be made 
available to the Central Bank with which to manage the market. 
If next year, like this year, we face problems with regard to 
creating new commitments, certainly these limited dollars cannot 
be converted into rials. The 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] 
budget law projected $13 billion in new commitments, whereas in 
actuality the amount will not be more than $5 billion. 
  In its proposed 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget 
bill, the government has anticipated that $1 billion in oil 
revenues will be spent on reducing the ceiling of foreign 
obligations. In other words, out of $12.4 billion, $1 billion 
will be reduced and the remainder multiplied by Rls1,750 and 
calculated as part of the budget revenues. How much of the 
foreign currency can be converted to floating-rate foreign 
currency is questionable, because some of the installments of 
the debts are based on 70-Rls and 600-Rls dollars and must be 
paid from next year's revenues. 
  As some experts believe, in the interests of the country, we 
must pay our debts as soon as possible, because, considering the 
recession in the world economy, interest rates are at their 
lowest level, and as soon as the economy improves, interest 
rates will rise, in which case, we will be forced to pay high 
interest on the late payments.

<H3>  Taxes and Tax Revenues in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] Budget </H3>
<H5>  Part 2 </H5>

  According to this year's budget law, the level of tax 
revenues is projected at about 5,409 billion rials. However, the 
likelihood is that, due to the inability to collect "important 
taxes," this figure will not be achieved. Tax revenues this year 
are anticipated at Rls440 billion. 
  Considering the creation of a single foreign-currency rate, 
from the beginning of 1372 [21 March 1993], the rate of tariffs 
on imported goods was supposed to be amended. Unfortunately, 
during the first eight months of this year, such an amendment 
did not take place. In the past, the level of tariffs was on the 
average 2 percent of the value of imported goods, which is a 
very low figure. In the past years, in order to prevent price 
increases on goods and protect consumers, import tariffs were 
kept at a low level, and consequently domestic production was 
harmed. Following the initial reform of import tariffs, the 
Majles based the level of customs taxes and fees at zero but 
gave permission to the government to amend and implement the 
rates through commercial taxes. The government also set 
commercial taxes at an average of 8 percent. But, as was pointed 
out, in the first eight months of the year, the old tariffs 
(averaging 2 percent) continued to be imposed. This 8 percent 
was put into effect for the last four months of this year. 
  The level of 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] tax revenues 
has been projected by the government at Rls6,400 billion, which 
seems achievable. But the requirement is that customs taxes and 
fees increase from the present 8 percent to 18 percent on 
average. An increase in taxes on imported goods, in addition to 
being in the interest of domestic products, will result in tax 
revenues being achieved. Considering the minimum of $7 billion 
in imports subject to customs tariffs and commercial taxes, it 
would not be unlikely for tax revenues to be procured from this 
sector next year. 
  The government was supposed to present a bill to the Majles 
on the level of customs taxes and fees, in accordance with the 
authorization given by the Majles to the government. This has 
not been done yet. Considering that the legal deadline is Tir 
1373 [22 June-22 July 1994], hopefully the government will 
devise the bill on tariffs as quickly as possible in order to 
enable the Majles to carry out an expert study and ratify it, 
thus enabling us to collect an average of 18 percent in tariffs 
on the value of imports from the start of 1373 [21 March 1994]. 
This is a practical step towards achieving the needed tax 
revenues. 
  On the other hand, the level of taxes on companies, which 
was 
projected at Rls1,443 billion in the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 
March 1994] budget law, in practice will go beyond the 
ratification and will reach Rls1,700 billion, which marks a 
17.8-percent increase. Hence, in terms of taxes on companies, 
the figures for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] are practical. 
  The grand leader of the revolution spoke of "observing 
social 
justice" and "collecting taxes on the basis of income" as 
policies governing the Second Plan. These points must be 
implemented as soon as possible. The Ministry of Economic 
Affairs and Finance, by establishing and equipping a 
computerized system, is trying to make its information about the 
tax resources more accurate. At the present time, not all the 
tax resources are known. For this reason, some social classes 
are known to carry a heavier tax burden. Some of this problem 
will be eliminated with the issuance of tax cards on the basis 
of which actual and legal persons will receive a code. These 
cards have begun to be issued, and individuals must use them in 
any transaction. In this way, more precise information on tax 
sources will be obtained. Hopefully, codes will be given to 
taxpayers as soon as possible to prepare the grounds for 
creating an equitable tax system and observing social justice, 
as Ayatollah Khamene'i emphasized. In this way, tax revenues 
will increase. It is hoped that the Ministry of Economic Affairs 
and Finance will make an effort to implement this plan as soon 
as possible on a widespread basis in order to ensure that 
persons with higher incomes pay more taxes. 
  One of the problems with tax laws is excessive exemptions. 
According to an expert study, "50 percent of the [potential] tax 
sources are exempt from the payment of taxes." As a result, the 
tax burden is imposed on the remaining 50 percent. The issue is 
not that tax exemptions should be eliminated altogether, but 
that in some cases it is necessary. However, any kind of 
exemption must be determined on the basis of accurate, expert 
calculations. Exemptions must not cause an excessive burden to 
be imposed on one group of actual and legal persons. At the 
present, large government and public companies, foundations, and 
banks, some of which have major incomes, are exempt from the 
payment of taxes. The treatment of these companies must be 
revised. This action, on the one hand, will clarify the tax 
sources and enter them into the government treasury and, on the 
other, prevent harm to production. Government and public 
companies, organizations, establishments, foundations, and banks 
must deposit their taxes in the Treasury, and if there is need 
for assistance from a specific source, this amount must be 
returned to them at the required level. Because the 
above-mentioned units do not pay taxes, similar units in the 
nongovernmental and nonpublic sectors, which are required to pay 
taxes, are unable to compete with them. In addition to reducing 
costs in certain units compared to others (discrimination in 
protection), this situation eliminates sound competition. For 
this reason, in many areas with active government and 
government-affiliated companies and public establishments, 
essentially there is no inclination for people to engage in 
investment and production. Also, some banks, in order to avoid 
the payment of taxes, have moved towards buying buildings. 
Hence, the suggestion has been made that tax revenues be 
distributed justly, a new dynamism be created in production, and 
tax exemptions be revised. According to an expert estimate, the 
"GDP" [gross domestic product] ratio in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 
March 1994] is 22 percent, and if half of the taxpayers are 
exempt from tax payments, the result will be that tax pressure 
at a level of 44 percent will be placed on the other half. 
  The examination of the budget bill this year will undergo 
two 
rounds of discussion, and in the first round of discussions, 
only the revenues will be examined. Most committees have new tax 
and fee suggestions for securing revenue resources, some of 
which are reasonable and some unreasonable. On the whole, this 
examination will be followed by an increase in the price of 
goods and services. For example, in order to improve cultural 
issues regarding education or health and treatment, which are 
very important, the collection of taxes within the framework of 
the Constitution may be desirable. But putting taxes on 
everything is certainly problematic. Will consumers agree to the 
increase in the price of gasoline from Rls50 to Rls120 per liter 
so that, for instance, the Bandar 'Abbas Refinery can be 
activated more quickly? Certain issues will be addressed in the 
following sections of this article in addition to a discussion 
of Note 25 of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill. 
<H5>  [20 Jan pp 1, 16] </H5>
  [Text] 
<H3>  Increase in the Price of Kerosene, Gasoline, and Other Oil 
Products </H3>
<H5>  Part 3 </H5>

  One of the most important characteristics of the 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill is Note 25. According to 
this note, if ratified by the Majles, the price of certain 
government goods and services will increase. The prices of 
kerosene, gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, electricity, post, 
and telephone are among the goods and services, which will see 
increased prices. 
  At present, the price of gasoline, which in Iran is 50 rials 
per liter, is Rls200 in Kuwait, Rls270 in the United Arab 
Emirates (Dubai), Rls1,090 in Turkey, and Rls260 in Qatar. Also, 
the prices per liter of kerosene are Rls200 in Kuwait, Rls980 in 
Turkey, and Rls43 in Dubai, all of which are significantly 
higher than the Rls15 RLS charged in Iran.[.sup]1.[/] 
  The low rate of oil products in Iran has resulted, on the 
one 
hand, in the extraordinary growth in consumption of these 
products and, on the other, the smuggling of these goods into 
countries on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, Turkey, 
and Pakistan. The consumption of kerosene in Iran, with a 
population of about 60 million people, is equivalent to its 
consumption in China, with a population of 1.1 billion people. 
  The level of fuel consumption in Iran at the present is $10 
billion worth annually. Some experts believe that if the present 
trend of growth in the consumption of oil products continues, in 
a period of less than 10 years, all domestically produced oil 
will be consumed. Based on this reasoning, the government has 
proposed in Note 25 that the prices per liter of gasoline 
increase from 50 to Rls120, kerosene and airplane fuel from 15 
to Rls30, diesel fuel from 10 to Rls20, and heating oil from 8 
to Rls10, and the price of natural gas increase from 10.7 to 
Rls12.4 per cubic meter. According to this proposal, the 
difference between the above prices will be collected as taxes 
on the sale of oil products and spent on investments. But the 
decision on whether the collected taxes will be spent on 
investment in oil affairs or other areas has been left for the 
second round of discussions in the Majles. 
  At the same time, the Ministry of Petroleum, on the basis of 
Rls1,600 per dollar, has estimated the costs per liter of 
kerosene, gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil without 
calculating the transportation costs of Rls294, Rls275, Rls263, 
and Rls134, respectively. 
  The amounts to be collected as taxes on oil products in 1373 
[21 March 1994-20 March 1995], based on the suggestion of the 
government, will be mainly invested in refining and 
transportation, according to the ratification of the Majles. The 
government has projected that 89 percent of investments will be 
in refining programs, 72.4 percent in transportation, and 7.3 
percent production of oil products, through the imposition of 
the taxes in Note 25 [percentages as published]. The creation of 
the Arak and Bandar 'Abbas refineries; the building of platforms 
in the Caspian Sea; the building of fuel stations; the 
reconstruction and construction of Naftshahr; the building of 
pipelines; and the development of the Sarakhs natural gas 
fields, the Oil Industry University, Kangan Natural Gas, and 
several other projects are among those projects, of which the 
implementation has been suggested to the Majles by the 
government from the funds obtained from taxes. 
  Even though the government has the authority and is able to 
make a decision in the Economic Council concerning the increase 
in the price of oil products, due to the social and economic 
pressures regarding the above-mentioned taxes, it has sent its 
proposals to the Majles. This is a commendable action worthy of 
gratitude. 
  This year, as well, the government intended to increase the 
price per liter of gasoline to Rls80 through the Economic 
Council; however, due to the reaction of the Majles, no decision 
was made in this regard. Offering the proposals in the form of 
the budget will familiarize the Majles deputies more tangibly 
with the realities. 
  Some deputies, on the one hand, expect the plans and 
projects 
to expand rapidly and, on the other hand, expect oil products to 
be offered to the people at a low rate. In making decisions, 
these two views are contradictory. If the deputies oppose the 
increase in prices, they must accept the fact that the speed of 
growth and development will decrease, and progress will be 
slower. Thus, pressuring the executive officials to implement 
the projects in their constituent regions is unreasonable. If 
the Majles is willing to accept an increase in prices at the 
intended level, it should also be accountable for its 
consequences. 
  What facilitates decision making concerning oil products is 
the calculation of the effects of price increases, especially in 
regards to fuel. Majles deputies have asked the experts of the 
government, the Plan and Budget Organization, and the Central 
Bank to calculate and predict the effects of these increases on 
other goods and services in order to see whether or not the 
people can tolerate the inflationary pressures resulting from 
these increases. Undoubtedly, with the increase in the price of 
fuel, the cost of transportation will increase, and with the 
increase in cargo and passenger fares, many goods and services 
will be affected. The Majles welcomes expert plans by both 
government organizations and independent experts. These plans 
must firstly generate conservation with regard to the 
consumption of oil products. Second, they must prevent pressures 
being applied to the downtrodden and low-income classes. Third, 
they should not have unpleasant political, social, and economic 
effects. And, fourth, no subsidies must be given to the 
high-income strata. 
  To subsidize the low-income and deprived classes, in selling 
natural gas, rates should be based on a sliding scale, and 
natural gas meters should be used to ensure that the low-income 
classes and those with low consumption do not face problems. 
This can force consumers to conserve. 
  In order to subsidize kerosene, gasoline, and other 
products, 
to return to a coupon system, given its ill effects, is not 
proper. Therefore, a cash subsidy can be put into effect, 
provided identification is carefully handled and precise 
information on the income and occupation of individuals is 
available. 
  In cities and villages, the public transportation system can 
be subsidized and prices increased in other areas. But in cities 
such as Tehran, where public transportation is insufficient and 
personal vehicles play a significant role, another solution must 
be found for the payment of subsidies. Otherwise, the 
above-mentioned factors will escalate the inflationary effects 
of the increase in the price of gasoline. 
  Considering that high-income and well-to-do families consume 
more fuel, naturally they benefit more from general subsidies, 
and this is contrary to social justice. On the other hand, the 
elimination of general subsidies may also create unpleasant 
effects for the vulnerable classes. In this regard, it is 
necessary to make careful calculations before appropriate 
decisions can be made. 
  Of course, to impose conservation in energy use, in addition 
to price increases, there are other methods that can be 
implemented. The development and dissemination of technical 
knowledge and the spread of a culture of conservation are among 
them. 
  God willing, the discussion on Note 25 concerning the 
increase in the price of services, electricity, post, and 
telephone in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget will 
be continued in the next issue.

all oil-producing countries and southern neighbors of Iran. 
Turkey also, as a neighboring nonoil country, has been used as 
evidence. If the price of oil products is compared to that of 
industrial countries, there is more of a gap. At the present 
time, a liter of gasoline is Rls1,591 in Germany, Rls571 in the 
United States, Rls1,528 in France, and Rls2,008 in Japan, and 
the price per liter of kerosene is Rls1,007 in Japan and Rls330 
in the United States. The price per liter of diesel fuel is 
Rls1,190 in Germany, Rls297 in the United States, Rls1,067 in

fuel is Rls448 in Turkey, Rls171 in the United States, Rls242 in 
Germany, Rls313 in France, Rls497 in Japan, and Rls5 in Iran. It 
is noteworthy that these prices are based on the rate of 
Rls1,600 to the dollar.

<H3>  The Increase in the Price of Electricity, Telephone 
Communication, and Postal Services in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995] Budget </H3>

<H5>  Part 4 </H5>
  In the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, the 
government has proposed an increase in the average per kwh 
[kilowatt hour] price of electricity from 17 rials to Rls33.5. 
Since there is a relatively clear picture available of the 
various uses of electricity, making a decision in this regard is 
simpler than that concerning oil products. At the present time, 
38 percent of all electricity consumption is domestic, 32 
percent industrial, 18 percent public use (including schools, 
universities, offices, mosques, barracks, pharmacies, etc.), and 
12 percent for other uses (commercial, agricultural, and 
mobile). Suitable policies can be devised appropriate to each of 
these. 
  The electricity industry requires heavy investment. If we 
want to avoid blackouts, there is no other way but investment. 
If investments are calculated at the day's prices, for the 
production of every kwh of electricity (based on 4.4 cents in 
foreign currency use at the market rate and Rls10 in rial 
costs), Rls100 are necessary. Of course, at the present, the 
cost of electricity, due to the low-rate foreign currency 
received, is about Rls10. If fuel is calculated on the basis of 
present prices and the remaining production factors on the basis 
of the floating rate, the cost of every kwh of electricity will 
be reduced to Rls50. 
  The level of electricity consumption at the present is 
uncontrolled, and the revenues of the country are insufficient 
for investment in this industry. 
  In order to prevent blackouts and conserve electricity, the 
rates must necessarily be modified. Implementing a sliding rate 
in such a way that no pressure is placed on the lower classes 
and presenting a correct model to the consumer can solve 
problems. In this case, those clients who reduce consumption 
will face lower rates. 
  The level of usual and reasonable consumption for a family 
is 
250 kwh. This group of consumers, mostly deprived and low-income 
individuals, can be given cost discounts and pay at the present 
prices. (Of course, the minimum is different in regards to 
warm-climate regions that use natural gas air conditioning.) 
Families that use between 250 kwh and 500 kwh of electricity 
should pay half the cost (Rls50 per kwh). In addition, families 
that use 500 kwh and above should pay the total cost (based on 
Rls50 per kwh). With these measures, 38 percent of electricity 
consumption will be controlled. 
  To conserve industrial use, which makes up 32 percent of the 
total consumption, at the peak hours (maximum use), such as 
early evening, the price of electricity can be increased in 
order to allow industrial units to regulate their work shifts so 
as not to put pressure on the national network. 
  One of the existing problems at the present is that 
electricity production must increase a great deal in order to 
cover service for peak hours. If steps such as those mentioned 
are taken, there will be less need for large investment 
expenditures. 
  A point that must be noted in connection with industry is 
that the level of electricity consumption, with some exceptions, 
such as aluminum production, does not effect the cost of 
industrial production very much. The highest level of 
electricity consumption is in aluminum production, which uses 
Rls750 worth of electricity per kg of aluminum production. 
  The repair of factories can be done in summer, because the 
consumption load is very high in the summer months. Most 
factories make repairs once a year, during which time the 
consumption load is reduced. 
  The level of demand can also be used in industry. That is, 
as 
consumer demand goes beyond a certain level, it should be 
followed by an increase in the price of electricity. Also, 
incentives should be implemented to reduce consumption in the 
production units, such that if a factory can do its work with 60 
kwh of electricity, it will not increase it to 70 kwh. 
  Public uses, such as schools, mosques, and pharmacies, can 
be 
exempt from price increases, and others, such as offices and 
barracks that have the most waste in public consumption, must be 
required to pay the costs. Unfortunately, the lights of some 
government offices are turned on during the daytime, and 
modifying the price can encourage conservation. In connection 
with commercial units, as well, the implementation of a 
progressive rate policy can change the consumption model from 
high-use to low-use lamps. 
  In the area of agriculture, considering its essential 
nature, 
there should be no price increases, in order to encourage these 
activities. 
  In any case, in connection with electricity, various 
scenarios exist, the best of which can be chosen and implemented 
in such a way that, in addition to creating conservation, 
pressure on deprived classes will be prevented and reasonable 
development will follow. 
  The average price of a postal parcel is Rls65 at the 
present. 
With Rls35 in taxes for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], as 
proposed by the government and if ratified by the Majles, it 
will be Rls100. One of the problems with this proposal is that 
the rates are not divided according to urban, intercity, and 
foreign parcels. 
  Even though the Postal Company, considering its present 
revenues, faces problems, the point should be taken into 
consideration that the least expensive method of communication 
throughout the world is the postal service. 
  It is not clear why the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and 
Telephone monopolizes postal services and does not allow the 
people to establish parallel postal units (of course, under the 
supervision of this ministry). This can give people choices and 
create competition. Private and nongovernmental companies may be 
able to offer postal services at lower rates. The Constitution 
does not prohibit the government from issuing permits to the 
people to engage in postal activities while supervising them. 
One of the claims that has prevented people from taking charge 
of postal services is that "private companies charge 
excessively." The response is that people have a choice, and if 
this occurs, they will not use such companies. 
  The increase in price of every pulse [words illegible] from 
Rls12 to Rls20 on the average in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] is another government proposal to the Majles. In other 
words, for every pulse, Rls8 in taxes will be added. [sentence 
as published] 
  In many countries in the world, no money is collected to 
receive a telephone line, and fees are collected from clients 
based on the level of calls. However, in Iran, not only are 
Rls600,000 to Rls1 million collected for every telephone line 
received, but charges are also made in terms of the rate of 
pulse. [sentence as published] Any new change in this connection 
will depend on determining the actual cost of a telephone line. 
The Communication Management Organization of the Plan and Budget 
Organization has estimated the establishment of every telephone 
line on the basis of $600 foreign currency costs and 
148,000-toman rial use at 270,000 tomans, whereas another 
estimate, based on Rls$521 in foreign currency expenditures and 
30,000 tomans in rial expenditures, determines the cost of every 
telephone line to be 134,200 tomans. The prices of the Plan and 
Budget Organization seem less accurate. For this reason, 
investment on the basis of Rls20 RLS per pulse seems high. 
[sentence as published] 
  The last point that can be discussed in connection with Note 
25 of the budget law is that if in its first round of 
discussions the Majles ratifies the taxes on oil products, 
electricity, communications, and post, the answer to the 
question of whether the above-mentioned amounts, based on 
government proposals, will be placed at the disposal of the 
Ministries of Petroleum; Energy; and Post, Telephone and 
Telegraph for investment or whether another area will be 
suggested for their use will come in the second round of 
discussions in the Majles. In any case, the issue depends on the 
Majles deputies' determination to more carefully examine the 
areas for investment from the above-mentioned taxes in the 
second round of discussions. 
<H5>  [23 Jan pp 1, 16] </H5>

<H5>  Government Companies and Banking Funds </H5>
<H5>  Part 5 </H5>
  The budget of government companies and the level of funds 
granted to them are issues that will be dealt with today, as the 
discussions of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] budget continue. According to the proposed 
bill, next year, out of about Rls79,687 billion in the national 
budget, the government will allocate Rls50,023 billion to 
government companies, Rls5,216 billion to banks, and Rls1,043 
billion to for-profit establishments affiliated with the 
government. In other words, the government has proposed to the 
Majles that in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], more than 
70.3 percent of the national budget be allocated to government 
companies, banks, and for-profit establishments affiliated with 
the government. 
  Unfortunately, the outcome of billions of rials in 
government 
investments in government companies, banks, and for-profit 
establishments affiliated with the government is only Rls1,296 
billion in profits, taxes, etc., for the government. These units 
continue to fail to show a desirable return and efficiency, and 
the losses projected for them amount to Rls4,032 
billion.[.sup]1.[/] Essentially, why must 34,000 discovered 
violations occur in government companies every 
year?[.sup]2.[/] 
  Lack of care and sufficient supervision of the Majles over 
the budget of government companies in the past years has created 
such a situation. Essentially, the examination of the budget of 
these companies was conferred on their general assembly, which 
is comprised of a few ministers. In accordance with Article 53 
of the Constitution,[.sup]3.[/] the budget of these companies 
was presented to the Majles a few years ago. Supervision over 
the budgets of government companies was more carefully accounted 
for in the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget law, but 
because there was insufficient time in this regard, the 
government was obliged to carry over the budget of government 
companies to Khordad 1372 [22 May-21 Jun 1993] and receive 
permission to spend based on the ratified budget through 
Shahrivar [23 August-22 September]. Unfortunately, the 
government did not present the report on the budget of these 
companies on time to the Majles. 
  Another point in connection with the budget of government 
companies is their number. Some believe that instead of fewer 
than 500 units reflected in the bill, the number of these 
companies exceeds 1,000 or 1,500 units. Based on permission 
received earlier in their charters, these companies were 
permitted to establish subsidiary companies, which they did. 
But, unfortunately, the accounts of the subsidiary companies are 
not reflected anywhere. In addition, no reference is made in the 
budget laws to the names of all the companies in which the 
government has shares. Such problems have resulted in a large 
volume of the Muslim Treasury in the government units not being 
supervised by the Majles. Even the Auditing Organization and the 
Accounting Office have no supervision over these units. 
  Government companies sometimes allow expenditures that are 
inappropriate to the initial goals of their establishment. The 
waste and extravagance of these companies require separate 
detailed discussion, and we will not give examples at this time. 
The vehicles and other equipment that these companies donate to 
the related ministries are examples of such extravagance. Some 
government companies show little profit. Some are exempt from 
taxes. It is not clear what amount of their reserve is spent on 
investment or used to eliminate their cash needs. In any case, 
an examination of government and government-affiliated companies 
is important from various dimensions. Many of these units can be 
transferred to the people, and thus both reduce the burden of 
the government and make their activities "economical." 
  In the past, if government companies intended to make 
investments, the government would allocate certain amounts in 
the general budget for the development of these investments. 
Following the increase in the volume of government expenditures 
in the past few years, meeting the investment needs of the 
government companies has been shifted towards the use of banking 
funds. 
  The funds that the government invests in government 
companies 
or the funds that these companies receive must somehow be paid. 
This has not occurred in many of these companies, and the 
remainder of the debts of the companies to the banks and the 
Central Bank are increasing regularly. 
  Government companies will receive Rls7,314 billion in loans 
in accordance with the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget 
bill and in exchange will pay Rls2,949 billion of the loans 
received in the past years. As a result, in terms of next year's 
budget, Rls4,365 billion will be added to the government debt to 
the banking system. 
  If the investment of government companies through the use of 
banking funds is economically justified, there is no argument, 
because these funds will be repaid within a reasonable period of 
time. But, unfortunately, this issue is postponed to the 
following year's budget, and ultimately, the repayment is placed 
on the shoulders of the government itself. What has become 
common in the budget bills is that through the budget, the 
Central Bank and other banks are obliged to place funds at the 
disposal of these companies, which is sometimes against the 
monetary policies. The 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] bill 
anticipates 12 notes for this purpose.[.sup]4.[/] For 
example, Note 17 obliges the Central Bank to allocate 100 
billion RLS in funds to build a student dormitory, which is by 
no means economically justified, because when this dormitory is 
built, it will provide no income to help repay the debt. In 
fact, this is the kind of budget deficit, which has been 
transferred to the banking system. Certainly, no one opposes the 
building of a student dormitory; but this is a matter to which 
the government must allocate funds from the general budget. The 
result of such a decision is that it would make the banks 
economically unsound. The banks must be allowed to work 
economically if monitoring is to be precise.

<H5>  Cash Flow and Inflation </H5>
<H5>  Last Part </H5>
  In the previous issue, the discussion concerned the adding 
of 
Rls4,365 billion by government companies to the government's 
debt to the banking system, according to the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, because they fail to repay a 
major part of the loans received. Also, the emphasis was made 
that the obligation of the government to repay some of the funds 
that cannot be repaid to the banks and the Central Bank is, in 
fact, a sort of budget deficit, which has been transferred to 
the banking network. This issue will focus on the level of funds 
received in government companies and private units and their 
role in cash flow and inflation. 
  Unfortunately, a great gap also exists at the level of 
granting funds to people and government sectors. In the 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, the government has 
obliged banks to pay Rls7,598 billion in funds to government and 
private organizations. Of this amount, Rls6,033 billion are 
allocated to government and government-affiliated units and 
Rls1,565 billion to the private sector. Among the government 
organizations, a large share of these resources will be placed 
at the disposal of oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, subways, 
steel, airlines, and sugar cane projects.[.sup]1.[/] 
  Next year, if the banks are obliged to pay the funds at the 
above-mentioned level and the private sector also receives funds 
at the level of this year, the increased cash flow will exceed 
25 percent,[.sup]2.[/], which is inappropriate with the 
average of 11.7 percent determined in the Second Developmental 
Plan of the government. 
  Since the rate of inflation growth has advanced in step with 
the cash flow, inflation also can increase at the same ratio 
next year. This is while there is no budget deficit. Otherwise, 
the cash flow will grow more. 
  The dear Majles deputies must note that increased cash flow 
escalates inflation and high prices, unless the ceiling of 
obligatory funds of the banks and the Central Bank is revised. 
Through the control of funds, inflation can be harnessed. 
Considering the limitation on general revenues, it is necessary 
to decrease the speed of the increase in cash flow in order to 
prevent the imposition of problematic inflation which mainly 
targets the deprived strata and low-income classes. 
  As much as possible, the payment of funds for investments 
with no economic justification, and of which the repayment by 
government companies is impossible, must be avoided. This step 
is considered a kind of budget deficit and causes inflation. 
  The most important point in connection with the banking 
network is that the structure of its organization must be 
reformed and revised. At present, the rate of administrative, 
organizational, and advertising expenditures of banks is high. 
Also, the banking network demands a great deal in terms of 
profit and service charges from loan applicants. 
  These issues must be reviewed. At the present, the banks 
transfer many expenditures to loan recipients, including those 
for advertising, employment, the opening of new branches, 
expensive decorations, and the construction and purchasing of 
numerous buildings. The cost of money (equipping of resources) 
in the banks is higher than it should be, and the people are 
paying for it. 
  One of the criticisms of the administration of banks is the 
composition of the Monetary and Credit Council, a significant 
number of the members of which are representatives of the 
ministries that use the funds. To reform the monetary system, 
the composition of the Monetary and Credit Council must change 
and mainly be composed of a headquarters, economic officials, 
and economic experts and not the consumers of the funds. In 
addition, in order to reform the system of economic decision 
making, the composition of the Economic Council must also 
change, because in this council, the consumer organizations make 
up the majority and promote the uneconomical decisions of the 
Economic Council. 
  One criticism, which is true of the work of the banks, is 
that they have become company owners and entered directly into 
the administration of companies. Companies that have not been 
economically sound, which rely on the support of the banking 
network and suffer significantly from extravagance, must be 
transferred to the people and become profitable as quickly as 
possible. Direct investments amounting to 50 percent of the 
shares must also be transferred to the people. 
  As monopoly is harmful in many economic activities, the 
banks 
must keep monopolies within the framework of Islamic laws and 
the Constitution. Nonbanking credit establishments must be 
allowed to engage in activities to provide the grounds for sound 
competition. With this action, government banks that at the 
present time consider themselves nongovernmental and public will 
no longer be able to impose any cost on the users of funds. 
Footnotes 
  [.sup]1.[/] The level of loans to be received by some of 
the companies from the banking system in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995] is as follows: National Oil Company, Rls1,643 
billion; Falat-e Qarreh, Rls130 billion; National Oil Products 
Distribution Company, about Rls166 billion; National Natural Gas 
Company, Rls226 billion; Iranian Electrical Power Production and 
Transmission Company, Rls427 billion; National Iranian Steel 
Company, Rls280 billion; Steel Mill, Rls100 billion; Mobarakeh 
Steel, Rls120 billion; National Petrochemical Industries 
Company, Rls1,062 billion; Islamic Republic Airlines, Rls150 
billion; the Iranian National Steel Industries Group, Rls100 
billion; Metro Company, Rls100 billion; and Sugar Cane 
Development and Subsidiary Industries Company, Rls500 billion. 
  [.sup]2.[/] Next year, from the notes of the budget alone, 
16 percent will be added to the cash flow.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Tension in U.S.-Russian Ties"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Justice Department officials said yesterday 
that they have arrested a key official of the CIA and his wife 
on the charge of espionage in favor of the former Soviet Union 
and also Russia. They described it as one of the greatest 
events in spying operations so far. 
  In the wake of the disclosure of this news, U.S. President 
Bill Clinton announced that he has ordered an enquiry and 
investigation in order to speedily clarify the details of such 
an event. 
  The subject of espionage and the reason why Russia and 
America, under the conditions when the Cold War has already 
ended, are trying to get informed of one another's secrets, have 
drawn the attention of the world people. 
  At the end of the Cold War the heads of the CIA and the 
Russian intelligence organization, KGB, in their speeches, had 
dismissed continuation of the past policies that arose from 
mutual distrust and proposed cooperation in various fields. But 
facts now show that both countries still lack trust toward the 
other. For this reason they continue to make use of their spy 
organizations for acquiring secret information on the actions 
and decisions adopted by the opposing country. 
  America is now trying to acquire precise information on 
Russian policies in various parts of the world, especially in 
the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union and 
possibly to create grounds for its political influence in them. 
In this regard one may refer to the murder of a CIA official in 
Georgia last year. That event roused Moscow's anger, vis-a-vis 
America. 
  It appears that spying measures of America, in order to 
penetrate Russia and the newly-independent republics, have led 
to the fact that Russia's spy organization too pursues its 
operations to counter the rival's designs. However, it often 
happens that spy organizations, based on their facilities, 
penetrate sensitive administrative and intelligence centers of 
the opposing country. Of course such an act, based on 
undermining the prestige of one of these two states, may bring 
sharp reactions in its wake. 
  In connection with the disclosure of the recent spying 
episode, it appears that Mr. Clinton is extremely wrathful and 
it is probable that he may adopt fresh decisions on U.S.-Russian 
diplomatic ties. Inflection of this blow on the Clinton 
Administration will compel Washington to have a closer survey of 
the rulers in Moscow and to adopt caution in its ties. But 
despite this one cannot stress the point that America will also 
reassess its policies on supporting the reformists and checking 
the ultra-nationalists. This is because in such case America 
will have to ready itself for return to the Cold War era and 
intense rivalry between the CIA and the KGB.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 24, IRNA -- The Persian daily `ABRAR' 
Thursday predicted that foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq will 
meet in the near [word indistinct]. Referring to the visit by 
an Iraqi Foreign Ministry delegation to Iran, ended yesterday, 
the morning daily said in its editorial that the two sides 
assessed the outcome of Tehran negotiations as partly positive. 
  Some informed sources believe that a better atmosphere 
prevailed over the negotiations as compared to the previous 
talks held in Baghdad, the daily said adding that it seems that 
new horizons have been opened up to the bilateral ties. 
However, it added, Iraqis continue to insist on some of their 
positions. "A country which has plunged the region for almost 
ten years into war and adopted an absolutely deterrent diplomacy 
towards peace and tranquility, should not imagine that can 
regain the lost confidence overnight even if it would have 
abandoned its past policies. 
  "Since the trend of the talks is evaluated as being 
positive, 
foreign ministers of the two countries would meet in the near 
future to promote the level of negotiating delegations and 
accelerate the process of folllowing up bilateral issues," ABRAR 
concluded.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 23, IRNA -- Major General Mohsen Rezaie 
in an interview with the English daily TEHRAN TIMES scoffed at 
Western media reports claiming Iran was for nuclear weapons. 
  "Political logic, morality, our own culture, and above all 
the situation in today's world does not allow us to have such 
deadly weapons." 
  The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) 
in an interview to be pulished Thursday, also said that 
political wisdom demands us not to go for the weapons which 
could cause devastation for humanity. 
  "The eight-year-old Iraqi imposed war is proof of the real 
nature of our combatants who never violated the internationally 
recognized norms concerning wars," he added. 
  "That Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons ...is just a 
baseless rumor," Rezaie said. 
  Commenting on the Persian Gulf he said, the geographical 
situation of the waterway is such that the deep water is on 
Iran's side which enables the Islamic forces to keep alien 
warships under surveillance. 
  Without going into details he said that there was a plot 
hatched by Britain, Israel and the United States to keep 
regional tensions high. 
  "I tell my friends in the UAE to listen to my advice as Iran 
wants to continue friendly relations with all the sheikhdoms," 
he added. 
  On the post-war role of the IRGC, Rezaie said that the IRGC 
was busy with extensive construction projects in the country.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 23, IRNA -- The English daily 'TEHRAN 
TIMES' here Wednesday commented on the Saudi motive behind an 
untimely, unnecessary and economically unjustified extravagance 
as buying passenger planes from the U.S. 
  The daily's editorial said that the kingdom, after the 
Desert 
Storm, had failed to transfer the 'special' relationship it 
enjoyed with George Bush to the Clinton Administration and 
commented that Washington's refusal to send an ambassador to 
Saudi Arabia for more than two years was an indication of the 
cold shoulder treatment Riyadh had been getting from the U.S. 
  It wrote that to allure the U.S. into old relationship, the 
Saudis had unveiled its petro-dollar and added that this splurge 
had serious consequences for other regional countries. 
  "Saudi's increased production has glutted the market and 
caused oil prices to fall from dlrs. [dollars] 18 to dlrs. 12 
per barrel in 1993, reducing the purchasing power of the Persian 
Gulf petroleum producers and making such extravagancies 
detrimental to their economies." 
  Considering the estimated Saudi production increase, and its 
refusal to cooperate with other OPEC members to stabilize the 
overall production level, the article believed it would be 
unrealistic to expect a fair price for oil any time soon. 
  "In the event that OPEC oil ministers fail to reach an 
agreement to lower production levels in their scheduled March 25 
meeting, crude prices could fall to dlrs. 11 per barrel. 
Reaching a consensus on production levels is contingent upon 
the realization, by overproducers, that regional and national 
interests have the highest priority when it comes to political 
and economic policies," the editorial concluded.

  [Text] Pakistan has decided to temporarily recall all 
diplomatic and other personnel from its embassy in Kabul. The 
decision was made after miscreants attacked Pakistan's embassy 
in the Afghan capital on 23 February. The Pakistani consulates 
at Mazar-e Sharif, Qandahar, and Jalalabad will continue to 
function as usual. Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan told a 
Radio Pakistan representative in Islamabad last night that 
Pakistani diplomatic and other personnel have already left Kabul 
for home. 
  Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, who made a brief 
visit to Kabul to hold meetings with Afghan leaders on the 
establishment of peace in Afghanistan, met President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani yesterday. He apprised the Afghan president of 
Pakistan's decision to temporarily recall its diplomatic 
personnel. The Afghan president was told that the embassy 
building is now unfit for use, and the diplomatic staff can only 
fulfill their duties when arrangements are made for a suitable 
building and their security is guaranteed. 
  Commander Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, who is actually in control of 
Kabul, has expressed his deep grief and anguish over the 
incident. 
  Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani has expressed his 
regret 
over the attack on the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul by some 
irresponsible people. In a message to President Farooq Ahmad 
Khan Leghari, he said the attack was probably the work of vested 
interests that want to harm the brotherly relations between the 
two countries. President Rabbani said these relations have been 
further strengthened by the assistance extended by Pakistan 
during the Afghan war against foreign aggression. He 
particularly thanked Pakistan for providing shelter to hundreds 
of thousands of Afghans during this period. Meanwhile, speaking 
to APP in Kabul, the Afghan president said he has ordered an 
inquiry into the incident, adding that those responsible will be 
punished. 
  Commander Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, accompanied by the Pakistani 
foreign minister, visited the Pakistani Embassy to assess the 
damage. Meanwhile, seven rockets landed in the Afghan capital of 
Kabul yesterday. At least six people were reported killed and 
10 injured.

  [Text] The Senate today completed debate on the hijacking 
of a Peshawar school bus. Winding up the debate, Federal 
Interior Minister, retired Major General Nasirullah Khan Babar, 
said successful commando operation against the hijackers has 
saved the country from a national calamity. The minister said 
the government had no option but to resort to an operation 
against the hijackers who had refused to listen to any reason. 
Gen. Babar said the government had made it clear that it would 
not bow before any act of terrorism. Earlier, Mr. Abdur Rahim 
Mandokhel, Mr. Mohammad Ibrahim Khan, Dr. Mohammad Rehan, Mr. 
Shahzad Gul, and Federal Minister for Special Education Dr. Sher 
Afghan participated in the debate on the bus hijacking. 
  In a written statement to the house on the attack of 
Pakistan 
Chancery building in Kabul by 100 people yesterday, the federal 
minister for law, justice, and parliamentary affairs, Syed Iqbal 
Haider, told the Senate that Pakistan was astonished that such a 
reaction had taken place in Kabul in support of the criminal act 
in which innocent children were taken hostage at gun point by 
three criminals. He said there was no cause for this reaction, 
particularly as the action against the three hijackers was taken 
in the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad with the consent and 
cooperation of the Afghan Government. The minister said this act 
of terrorism has been condemned by the Afghan president and 
prime minister. 
  Syed Iqbal Haider said the reaction of the demonstrators on 
the question of food supplies to Kabul was also irrational and 
unreasonable. The Pakistan Government had already donated and 
dispatched 32,000 tons of wheat to Afghanistan during last year 
and was in the process of sending additional relief wheat as 
well as other goods to Afghanistan. The foreign minister, 
Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, had only recently undertaken a 
humanitarian mission to Jalalabad to secure food supplies to 
Kabul through the ICRC by persuading Prime Minister Hekmatyar to 
open the route for relief convoys. Pakistan's borders had 
always remained open for the transport of relief goods. The 
route between Jalalabad and Kabul was an internal matter for the 
Afghan leaders. However, Pakistan was urging them to keep all 
internal Afghan routes open for humanitarian relief. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now going to consider the 
question of temporary closure of its embassy in Kabul and the 
issue of compensation for damage to our chancery. Decisions 
shall be taken after examining all possible aspects of our 
relations with Afghanistan. However, the Government of Pakistan 
will not allow the acts of criminals to undermine the close 
brotherly relations between the two countries.

  [Excerpts] Islamabad -- In the wake of attack on Pakistan 
Embassy in Kabul, the government of Pakistan decided Thursday to 
temporarily close its mission in Kabul and withdrew all its 
diplomats and staff from the Afghan capital. [passage omitted] 
  Matters took a more serious turn later in the evening when 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was informed by the Interior 
Minister Nasirullah Babar that three rockets had been fired from 
Afghanistan into Pakistan at the Towr Kham border. 
  Afghans without visas attempted to enter Pakistan illegally 
during the dusk hours. There were also some skirmishes on 
Thursday evening when such attempts to cross over into Pakistan 
were made by Afghans. Of late, a shift in Pakistan policy 
resulted in the closure of its borders with Afghanistan, 
allowing only trucks loaded with goods allowed to go to 
Afghanistan and Afghans with visas to enter the country. 
  Three rockets were fixed at different targets: the Tourist 
Inn, an empty checkpost and a third at an unidentified target. 
However, there were no causalities. 
  Babar said, "The Afghan Government has been sent a clear 
message from us. We will have to take strict measures."

  [Text] Tehran, Feb 24 (AFP)--Iran never has and never will 
allow North Korea to test missiles on its soil, the head of 
Iran's Revolutionary Guards General Mohsen Reza'i vowed in an 
interview published Thursday [24 February]. 
  Speaking to the English-language daily Tehran Times, Reza'i 
denied Western reports that his country let the hardline 
communist state to test-fire a medium range missile in Iran. 
  "We are very sensitive to having our soil and military 
facilities used by foreigners," he said. "Iran will never opt 
for such cooperation no matter how friendly the countries are." 
  Western newspapers and several military officials have 
charged that North Korea would test the missile, named the 
Nodong-2. 
  Rezaie revealed Tehran had turned down repeated requests 
from 
Russia to sell it US-made F-14 jet fighters and wire-guided 
anti-tank missiles (TOW), "despite the enmity between Iran and 
the United States." 
  The Islamic republic also refused to deliver to the United 
States a Soviet-made T-72 tank, seized from Iraqi forces during 
the war, as requested by Washington "through various channels," 
he said. 
  The general denied as "rumor and baseless" Western charges 
that Iran tried to acquire nuclear weapons. "Political logic, 
moral concerns and world realities stop us from trying to have 
such deadly weapons." 
  Pyongyang, a main supplier of arms to Iran during its 
1980-1988 war with Iraq, is suspected by the West of offering to 
provide Tehran with 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) range Nodong-1 
missiles, and to help in nuclear research. 
  Iran has repeatedly denied the charges, insisting that 
contacts between the two countries are limited to economic 
cooperation.

  [Text] Tehran, 2 Bahman [22 Jan] [KEYHAN-E HAVA'I 
News Service] -- According to the confirmation of all experts 
and the majority of Majles deputies, the foreign currency 
revenues of the government in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
will not exceed $10 billion. 
  Sa'id Leylaz, head of the public relations office and an 
expert of the Organization for Expansion and New Building of 
Iranian Industries, who spoke in the opening ceremonies of the 
Management Seminar for the Planning and Control of Cash Funds, 
made this statement and added: Hence, from foreign currency 
revenues alone, calculating 1,750 rials[R] to the dollar, the 
figures in the government budget proposed to the Majles will see 
a deficit of more than R6,600 billion. 
  He added: Also, tax revenues for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 
1995] have been projected at R6.4 billion. However, considering 
the decrease in revenues, at least R1 trillion of the projected 
tax revenues will not be attained. 
  Leylaz described a significant part of the proposed 
government budget for the government companies in 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] to be questionable and said: Of the total 
R7,313 billion projected as banking loans to the government 
companies, about R5,630 billion (that is, 77 percent) is 
allocated to 15 giant government companies active in oil, 
natural gas, petrochemicals, steel, meat, and the Tavanir 
sectors, and the remaining R1,683 billion is set aside for about 
2,000 other government companies.

Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan, has sent the following message to Sardar Faruq 
Ahmad Khan Laghari, president of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, on the incident of Pakistan's embassy in Kabul: 
  Your Excellency Sardar Faruq Ahmad Khan Laghari, president 
of 
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, on behalf of myself and Muslim 
Afghan nation, I am pleased to convey best wishes to your 
excellency, and through you to the fraternal nation of Pakistan. 
Your excellency, I would like to express my deep regret and 
sorrow at the incident which occurred on 23 February in your 
country's embassy -- most probably at the instigation of 
self-seeking elements who seek to make fraternal and friendly 
relations between the two neighboring and Muslim countries 
tense. Your excellency, religious and cultural ties, and 
material and moral support of the nation and government of 
Pakistan on the uprising of the people of Afghanistan against 
foreign aggression and the granting of asylum to millions of 
Afghan refugees have so deepened and expanded our relations that 
the occurrence of incidents such as the aforementioned cannot 
damage our countries' religious and good neighborly relations. 
I take the opportunity to wish from the compassionate God your 
excellency's health, long life, success, and prosperity for the 
people of Pakistan. 
  [Signed] Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, President of the 
Islamic State of Afghanistan.

today strongly condemned the continued fighting and the closing 
of communication lines with Kabul, and asked that the United 
Nations, using its influence, bring pressure to bear on the 
enemies of the people of Afghanistan as soon as possible in 
order to open supply routes to Kabul. The demonstrators asked 
the United Nations to send more aid to the people of Afghanistan 
so that residents of Kabul can be rid of the famine caused by 
the putschist road blockers. Expressing repulsion and hatred at 
the acts of putschists, the demonstrators asked the United 
Nations to secure world aid to rid the people of Afghanistan of 
famine and hunger, which has been caused by the closing of the 
Torkham border post and communication lines.

fatal blows of the ambush units of Corp No. 6, Brigade 54, and 
mechanized forces. The Islamic Army of Afghanistan entered the 
region and inflicted heavy losses on the militia. As a result 
of the blows, three pieces of mortar, three pieces of 82-mm 
artillery, 80 Kalashnikovs, 10 pieces of RPG8 and [words

  [Text] By firing 20 rockets, the infamous militia of 
Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin murdered and injured a number of our 
compatriots last night. A source of the General Command of 
Kabul Garrison told a military correspondent of BIA that 
Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam's militia made last night the targeted 
20 Saqar rockets at ward 11 of the city of Kabul. As a result 
of this savage act, six of our oppressed and innocent 
compatriots were martyred and 10 others were injured. The 
injured were quickly taken to hospitals and treated. In 
addition to the loss of life, much damage has been inflicted on 
the residents of Kabul. The rockets were fired from an eastern 
direction, which is controlled by Golboddin's men.

  [Text] Minister Hasan 'Izz-al-Din reports that President 
Ilyas al-Hirawi has announced that the question of a cabinet 
reshuffle has not been discussed and that regional and domestic 
circumstances do not permit this issue to be discussed now. 
  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri yesterday denied for the 
second time in two days that there will be a cabinet reshuffle, 
noting that reports about this matter are merely newspaper 
speculations. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Michel al-Murr repeated an earlier 
denial that there will be a reshuffle of portfolios. He 
explained that although there are certain reservations about the 
level of performance in some ministries, this does not 
necessitate a reshuffle. 
  Sources close to the prime minister told the newspaper 
AL-NAHAR that those who spread rumors about a cabinet reshuffle 
are seeking to achieve two things: First, to provoke a dispute 
between the prime minister and the Chamber of Deputies speaker; 
and second, to provoke quarrels between the prime minister and 
the ministers and also among the ministers themselves. The 
sources noted that such quarrels would paralyze the government 
and undermine the current cooperation between the government and 
the Chamber of Deputies over the passing of laws beneficial to 
the country's peace and reconstruction process.

  [Excerpts] The decision made by the United States to

considered an initial success for Lebanon. A final lifting of 
the ban is expected in the coming stage. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has said that there is no 
justification for the decision to extend the ban either on 
security or political grounds, even though the decision contains 
some positive indications. 
  The U.S. decision to extend the ban on travel to Lebanon for 
only six months is expected to be the subject of consultations 
among President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Chamber of Deputies Speaker 
Nabih Birri, and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.

  [Text] Beirut, 24 Feb (AFP)--The head of the Iranian-backed 
Hizballah has accused factions within the government of stirring 
up trouble between his organisation and the Lebanese army as 
part of moves to halt anti-Israeli attacks. 
  Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah charged late Wednesday that factions 
which he declined to name were "executing a pledge made by the 
Lebanese government to U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher." 
  Earlier this month, Christopher urged Lebanon and Syria to 
calm down the situation in south Lebanon after a Katyusha rocket 
attack on northern Israel, which was later claimed by 
Palestinian hardliners. 
  Hizballah guerrillas on 7 February killed four Israeli 
soldiers and wounded five in the bloodiest attack since August. 
Christopher said the violence could undermine Arab-Israeli 
peace talks, while Israel warned of a massive operation in south 
Lebanon following the rocketing and blamed Syria, which has 
35,000 troops in Lebanon. 
  "Resistance operations will continue (because) Hizballah's 
strategy is not part of any political consideration," Nasrallah 
said on al-Manar television, a channel owned by Hizballah. 
  Hizballah spearheads anti-Israeli attacks by Lebanese and 
Palestinian factions in south Lebanon, where Israel occupies a 
border strip. It opposes the peace talks and rejects any 
normalization of ties with the Jewish state. 
  The Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim fundamentalist group "is 
ready to confront the situation" if Syria and Lebanon sign a 
peace accord with Israel, Nasrallah said. "We are not only a 
military movement. We have popular roots everywhere. No one 
will be able to uproot us, no matter what happens," the 
Hizballah chief added. Nasrallah also stressed that Hizballah, 
which has eight MP's, was "trying to topple the government 
through peaceful means." 
  Its opposition dates back to September when soldiers opened 
fire on an illegal protest against the Israeli-PLO autonomy 
accord, killing nine Hizballah supporters. 
  The United States has repeatedly called on Lebanon to disarm 
Hizballah, the only militia allowed to keep its weapons since 
the end of the country's 15-year war in 1990.

  [Text] In a statement made earlier today to Jordan 
television's live program "Good Morning Jordan," Talal Sat'an 
al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs denounced the 
painful, criminal incident in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  [Begin al-Hasan recording] First of all, I wish to express 
the Jordanian Government's strong condemnation of the criminal 
massacre committed this morning against innocent, unarmed 
Palestinian citizens inside the Ibrahimi Mosque, a house of God, 
and one of the most sacred places for the Muslim nation. This 
condemnable crime, committed against worshipers in the middle of 
Holy Ramadan, has shaken us and every single Arab, Muslim, and 
individual in the world. It should not be allowed to go by as a 
passing incident. The world must view it as a result of the 
arming of fanatical settlers. Jordan has always warned against 
the serious consequences that arming settlers would have on the 
peace process. Israel, the world, and the international 
institutions must bear their responsibilities and immediately 
act to end the settler's terrorist acts. This, of course, means 
that, first, these criminals must be punished and disarmed to 
prevent such incidents in the future; this includes even 
removing the settlements all together from the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  As we extend to our kinsfolk in occupied, steadfast Hebron, 
and to the families of the martyrs our warmest condolences, we 
in Jordan warn the world that this incident and several others 
in the past only exemplify the consequences of the occupation of 
the Palestinian territory and the prevention of the Palestinian 
people from exercising theirs right on their soil. The world 
must bear the responsibility for stopping these incidents by 
ensuring the achievement of an honorable, comprehensive 
settlement that will lead to Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Palestinian and Arab territories and granting the 
Palestinian people their legitimate rights. [end recording]

  [Text] Palestinian sources have stated that the Palestinian 
and Israeli negotiators, who concluded their talks in Cairo 
today on self-rule for the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho, 
agreed to leave four topics relating to security and civilian 
services to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to solve. 
  The topics include Palestinian passports and postal stamps, 
the size of the Palestinian police force, and the area of 
Jericho to enjoy self-rule under the agreement. The same 
sources added that the Israelis refuse to take any step that may 
give the self-rule areas the form of a state, such as the 
issuing of passports and postal stamps. 
  PLO sources have noted that Israeli troops have begun to 
withdraw from some sites in Gaza and Jericho in preparation for 
the final withdrawal from the two regions. Five Palestinian 
police officers have arrived in Gaza and Jericho to discuss how 
the Palestinian police force will be deployed once the Israeli 
withdrawal is finalized.

  [Text] This is the last day of the Israeli prime minister's 
visit to Portugal. Today, he reiterated the idea of a Jerusalem 
united under Israeli control. For the old part of the city, at 
the center of the dispute, Rabin has proposed a tripartite 
administration. Miguel Moreira reports. 
  [Moreira] This morning Rabin spoke for more than an hour 
with 
Portuguese businessmen and tried to convince them that to invest 
in Israel could prove very beneficial. According to Rabin, 
peace is very close and the future is promising. The AIP 
[Portuguese Industrial Association] personnel answered by 
nodding their heads. They are willing to go forward with new 
deals in civil construction and textiles. 
  At this meeting, Rabin reiterated that the administration of 
the sacred part of the city of Jerusalem should be a tripartite 
one. 
  [Begin Rabin recording, in English with superimposed 
translation into Portuguese] We believe that one has to 
distinguish between the living city of Jerusalem and the holy 
city of Jerusalem for the three religions. We are committed to 
allow free access and free religious practice to the members of 
the Christian and Muslim religious communities. But it is more 
than that. The administration of religious shrines is not 
carried out by Israel; it is in the hands of the various 
churches. [end recording] 
  [Moreira] After the visit to the AIP, Rabin went to the 
Assembly of the Republic where he met [Assembly Speaker] Barbosa 
de Melo and a number of political leaders. At the moment, he is 
having lunch at Belem Palace with President Soares.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to Cairo talks, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place 
and date note given; from the "With the Midday Events" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, good evening. 
  [Sha'th] Good evening. You are welcome. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, hopes are rife that the negotiations 
will end before the blessed 'Id al-Fitr. Is what remains only 
time to draft the clauses of the agreement or are there other 
substantive issues? 
  [Sha'th] No substantive issues remain to hamper this 
agreement. Naturally, one always tries to confine his optimism 
to the framework of what is possible and realistic. Therefore, 
I cannot be absolutely certain, but can say we may conclude all 
these matters before 'Id al-Fitr, God willing. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, regarding the Israel Defense Forces' 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, has agreement been 
reached on dates? 
  [Sha'th] Agreement has been reached on the withdrawal plan 
and dates, but the first day of withdrawal depends on the day of 
signing. Consequently, it is an integrated timetable which 
lacks only the date of signing which will be the starting day of 
withdrawal. 
  [Mu'addi] What was agreed regarding the Palestinian police 
force? When will the vanguards of this force arrive in the Gaza 
Strip? 
  [Sha'th] Several officers will go there as of now to make 
the 
necessary preparations and contact the Israeli military 
commanders in Gaza in order to define the Palestinian police 
positions and what is required before the rest of the police 
forces arrive. Once the agreement is signed, the Palestinian 
police forces will begin to leave for the Strip and Jericho. 
They will do so before the Israeli withdrawal starts so that 
they will accurately learn all positions and needs on the 
ground. These forces will arrive in stages and gradually take 
up their positions prior to withdrawal. The withdrawal will then 
immediately commence from the positions, one at a time. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, you realize that the issue of releasing 
prisoners is the main preoccupation of the people on the street. 
What stage have you reached in this regard? 
  [Sha'th] This subject preoccupies us as well. I think there 
is a favorable Israeli response in this regard and a feeling of 
its importance for Palestinians and the coming peace and the 
start of a new stage of relations. Therefore, we are conducting 
these negotiations, in addition to all other activities, day by 
day. I think we got closer in some points and others need to be 
finalized. What is important is to agree to a timetable for the 
release of all prisoners, even if this timetable is spread over 
a period of time that includes withdrawal and completion of the 
agreement on the West Bank, too. We want all prisoners to 
eventually return home in peace. We want to see an end to this 
period so a new era of peace can begin. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one last question. When do you expect a 
summit meeting between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Sha'th] This, of course, depends on the day of signing. 
They might meet one or two days before the signing to discuss 
those issues left for them to finish. Therefore, if the signing 
is ready before 'Id al-Fitr, then the two leaders will meet 
before 'Id al-Fitr. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian 
delegation to Cairo talks, thank you very much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you and welcome.

  [Text] [Mu'addi] What stage has been reached in your 
discussion of the subject of transferring civil powers to the 
Palestinians? 
  [Al-Tarifi] In my opinion, diplomatic relations reached a 
very advanced stage. Yesterday, we concluded our discussion of 
the issue of agreement on the lands of both state and absentees. 
God willing, we will reach agreement on the issue of 
communications today. Two subjects, that is, organization and 
planning, and water, will be discussed next week. There is also 
the subject of jurisdictions, which is now being discussed in 
Paris as it is linked to the economic committee there. 
  [Mu'addi] Regarding the subject of visas, land registration, 
and water resources, has an understanding or agreement been 
reached on these topics? 
  [Al-Tarifi] Regarding visas, yes there is an agreement. The 
subject of water resources will be discussed next week, God 
willing. 
  [Mu'addi] Can we then say that next week will witness the 
end 
of negotiations within the framework of the Civilian Affairs 
Committee and that powers can be transferred to the Palestinians? 
  [Al-Tarifi] I hope so, God willing. 
  [Mu'addi] Has the Palestinian side made preparations and 
formed special cadres to take civil authority over from the 
civil administration? 
  [Al-Tarifi] In my opinion, and you know this, brother Sa'id, 
all present departments are currently run by Palestinians. Very 
few Israeli officials are present. We have qualified 
Palestinian cadres and we can assume power immediately.

  [Text] In the Paris talks on the economic aspects of the 
peaceful relationship between Israel and the Palestinians, there 
has been some movement following a night-long session. Finance 
Minister Avraham Shohat said earlier he would not agree to 
endanger Israel's economy by giving in to the latest Palestinian 
demands. On the background leading to the deadlock, which 
focuses on the issue of customs, this report from Michel 
Zlotowsky in the French capital: 
  [Begin Zlotowsky recording] Sources close to the negotiators 
told Qol Yisra'el that everything that had been discussed during 
the five previous meetings now needs to be reassessed and 
rediscussed. We never said it would be fun and easy. It is 
difficult, it is complicated, and it will indeed take some time, 
said the sources. 
  It is clear now after the first meeting yesterday that the 
Palestinians did not buy the Israeli idea of a customs envelope, 
meaning that Israel and Gaza-Jericho would constitute one bloc 
for customs-related issues. In fact, the Palestinians did not 
have second thoughts, but something happened between the fifth 
and sixth round compelling them to review their position. This 
something, according to observers here, may well be the economic 
agreements signed with Egypt, and mainly with Jordan. Following 
King Husayn's stern warnings last month, a Palestinian 
delegation led by Faruq Qaddumi went to Amman and signed within 
two days a set of agreements at the beginning of January. Now 
the Palestinians seem to be tied by those agreements, preventing 
them from (?constituting) this one market proposed by Israel. 
How to break this deadlock is precisely what is being 
discussed. [end recording] 
  The talks are to resume next week. Finance Minister Shohat 
is returning home today.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Feb (MENA)--The Palestinian ambassador to 
Egypt, Sa'id Kamal, has declared that the shooting of 
worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn today 
raises doubts about the usefulness of negotiating over the 
transitional period, which involves settlements and settlers as 
part of the agreement pertaining to it. 
  In a statement to MENA, Sa'id Kamal demanded that the 
Israeli 
Government immediately adopt a resolution removing the 
settlements and withdrawing the settlers so that the peace 
operation might follow its sound and natural course. He said he 
doubts the efficacy of negotiating under the circumstances. 
  Kamal explained that the Palestinian proposal to place the 
West Bank and Gaza under international protection has been 
proven sound. 
  Hasan 'Usfur, deputy chairman of the Security Affairs 
Committee in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on 
implementing autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, condemned the 
massacre. He stressed that the Israeli settlers' new crime 
reveals the inherent brutality of those who reside illegally in 
the occupied territories. 
  'Usfur added that their actions contradict the most obvious 
legal principles and offer new proof that the peace process is 
not an easy issue but is a complicated operation that requires 
extreme efforts to maintain it. 
  The Palestinian official remarked that the new crime 
illustrates to Rabin's government the danger that the continuing 
presence of the settlers poses for the peace process. He said 
that if Israel wants to preserve the peace process, it must 
first end the new barbarism of these people, who are no longer a 
danger to the Palestinians alone, but to the entire peace 
operation. They are thus a danger to Rabin's government. 
  'Usfur concluded his remarks by noting that this new 
criminal 
act demonstrates the Palestinian negotiators' sound logic when 
they considered the dangers represented by such people and told 
the Israeli negotiators that security is a mutual concern, not a 
demand made by one party.

  [Text] Following the death of Tharwat al-Hajjaj, commander 
of the military wing of the so-called al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah 
who was responsible for carrying out the operations in Egypt in 
coordination with the group's leaders abroad and its members in 
the governorates, the group and its fugitive and imprisoned 
leaders at home and abroad have had a problem finding a 
replacement for him. 
  Consultations are currently taking place among the group's 
leaders to choose one of the fugitive members to assume the post 
in Egypt. The candidate who has the best chances is Rif'at 
Zaydan, commander of the military wing in Asyut, who has been 
leading the terrorist operations there and was Tharwat 
al-Hajjaj's right-hand man in Asyut. He is considered the most 
capable among the group's members to assume the post after 
having managed to avoid being captured by the security forces in 
the past two years and to carry out all the terrorist operations 
with his group, which includes Ahmad Sanusi, 'Abd-al-Nabi 
Husayn, and Jamal 'Abd-al-Hamid. 
  Rif'at Zaydan is from Dayrut. He assumed the command of the 
military wing after Jamal Huraydi, commander of the Manshiyat 
Nasir massacre, was arrested and after Ahmad Zaki al-Sharif was 
killed in the Firyal Company incidents in Asyut.

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 24 (AFP)--Jordanian and Omani military 
officials headed for Sanaa Thursday to help ensure compliance 
with a reconciliation agreement between Yemen's rival leaders, a 
military statement issued in the Yemeni capital said. 
  The officials would try to finalise a plan to reposition 
troops who have clashed repeatedly since the accord was signed 
in Amman Sunday, and ensure that the military and security 
aspects of the deal were properly implemented. 
  In Amman officials said 10 Jordanian military observers 
would 
travel to Yemen, accompanied by royal adviser Khalid al-Karaki. 
  The reconciliation accord, brokered by Jordan, called for 
constitutional reforms, an improvement of security and the 
withdrawal of military checkpoints from towns and cities. 
  It was signed by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a 
northerner, and his southern rival, Vice-President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, in the presence of King Husayn. 
  Oman, which borders on Yemen, also mediated between the two 
leaders, who have been in dispute since last August over 
al-Bid's refusal to take up his duties in Sanaa. 
  The armies of north and south have not merged since the 
country was unified in May 1990. 
  The military statement also said southern troops and militia 
belonging to al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) Thursday 
ambushed northern troops of the al-'Amaliqah brigade outside a 
hospital in the troubled Abyan province, 100 kilometers (60 
miles) east of Aden. 
  At least 20 people are reported to have been killed in the 
province since clashes between the rival armies erupted Monday. 
  One northern soldier was wounded in the ambush Thursday, 
which occurred when northern troops went to reclaim the bodies 
of soldiers killed in the earlier clashes, the statement said. 
  It also denied a claim that northern troops were surrounding 
units based in 'Amran, 60 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of 
Sanaa. 
  Earlier an official in Sanaa said southern units were 
surrounded in 'Amran and Dhamar, 100 kilometers (60 miles) south 
of the capital. 
  "Tension is high in these regions, and there is a serious 
risk of an explosion," the official told AFP, declining to be 
named. 
  Meanwhile, a newspaper in al-Bid's stronghold, the southern 
port city of Aden, said Thursday southern Yemeni troops had 
captured several Arab veterans of the Afghanistan war during the 
clashes in Abyan province. 
  The veterans were fighting alongside northern troops, the 
newspaper October 14 said, but did not specify how many were 
captured nor their nationality. 
  It said the veterans, who fought against the Soviet 
occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, were supported by the 
powerful fundamentalist movement al-Islah, and were trained in a 
"terrorist camp" on al-Marakishah mountain, in the north of the 
province. 
  They were financed by a rich Saudi businessman, Usamah 
Bin-Ladin, based in Khartoum," the paper said, and were 
"supported by officials in the Sanaa administration." 
  Al-Bid has refused to go to Sanaa, demanding major economic, 
political and military reforms. He returned directly to Aden 
late Wednesday after touring Oman and Saudi Arabia.

  [Text] The follow-up committee of the mass gathering of the 
sons of Shabwah Governorate has issued the following statement: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  At a time when our Yemeni people received with great 
satisfaction the signing of the accord document in the Jordanian 
capital, Amman, and after it was hoped that a final countdown 
would begin to resolve the political crisis, the Yemeni people 
were surprised by a deterioration in the security and military 
situation in Abyan Governorate. As a result, many people fell 
as victims, even in this blessed month. These regrettable 
incidents are sought by forces hostile to unity and democracy to 
prevent the implementation of the accord document, which is a 
safety mechanism for unity and democracy. 
  While receiving this regrettable news, we denounce these 
incidents and consider them the beginning of a new political 
crisis that could jeopardize our unity and life. We ask for a 
prompt investigation and trial of the elements that sparked 
these incidents so that the tragedy will not be repeated. We 
also call for the removal of the causes of these incidents and 
the prevention of further such irresponsible actions so they 
will not expand beyond control. 
  We in the follow-up committee of the mass gathering for the 
sons of Shabwah ask the political leadership to face up to its 
responsibilities and begin the implementation of the accord 
document, since they have signed and pledged to implement this 
document. The document is a national program that has won the 
consensus of the Yemeni people. 
  We also ask our brothers and sons in the Armed Forces, the 
bulwark of Yemeni unity, not to disappoint this patient, loyal 
people and to help implement this document. They should also 
not be carried away by selfish whims and narrow interests. All 
military units should remain in their positions since their 
movement under these circumstances would delay the start of the 
implementation of this document and threaten the homeland's 
unity, security, and stability. 
  The sons of the Shabwah Governorate also assert that they 
will be faithful to the implementation of the document to which 
they have agreed upon in their gathering. They will 
particularly spare their governorate all conflicts, military 
skirmishes, and political confrontation. All military units 
will remain in their original places to avoid any clashes, which 
could claim many lives in the governorate. This governorate 
will also refrain from causing any tension to spread to other 
governorates so that the accord document can be implemented in 
accordance with the agreed upon mechanism. 
  The follow-up committee also asks the political leadership 
and the commanders of military units to honor the documents of 
the mass gathering of the Shabwah Governorate and not to turn 
the governorate into a battlefield or a source of tension for 
other governorates. 
  May God grant us all success for the good, security, and 
stability of this homeland. 
  Our Lord. Decide thou between us and our people in truth, 
for thou art the best to decide. [Koranic verse] 
  Issued by the follow-up committee of the mass gathering of 
the sons of Shabwah Governorate.

<F P=106> [Message addressed to the chairman and members of the Yemeni </F>
Presidential Council on 24 February] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  Esteemed brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and commander in chief of the 
Armed Forces: Greetings of the revolution and unity. While we 
do not want to remind you of the stands, sacrifices, and heroic 
deeds, that the sons of the Abyan Governorate have registered at 
various stages and of their national militant role in achieving 
unity and democracy, we would like to stress that the situation 
in Abyan Governorate has become grave as a result of the 
barbaric provocations and killings to which the governorate's 
honorable and innocent sons are being exposed. We urge you to 
face up to your responsibilities and your historic mission, 
which you pledged to God to carry out for your people and your 
homeland. 
  While we take pride in the fact that Abyan has been destined 
to be the cradle of the revolution and the revolutionaries, we 
are displeased by the negligence displayed toward the 
governorate and its achievements. In addition to losing its 
best and noblest men, as well as being deprived of most of its 
rights and needs, Abyan Governorate is being exposed to killings 
and torture. (?Most parts) of the governorate are still to this 
moment besieged by the most lethal machines of destruction and 
death, which were brought by the advocates of division to settle 
purely divisionist scores. 
  Brother Presidential Council chairman, brother members: 
While we are addressing you, our hearts are bleeding because of 
what is happening to our sons, daughters, mothers, brothers, and 
sisters. While we reiterate our readiness to continue to offer 
more sacrifices for the sake of unity, we do not want our 
governorate, Abyan, to be the hotbed of the conflict, which 
would not serve the homeland or the people's interest. 
Therefore, we urge the withdrawal of all the military units 
from the governorate, as well as the implementation of the 
contents of the accord document, as the only solution to the 
crisis. 
  While we urge you to abide by this, we call on the parties 
in 
the coalition; all the political forces, represented by the 
Dialogue Committee; all the political organizations; and the 
vocational and creative popular organizations to close ranks in 
the face of threats to our unity and the implementation of the 
Amman accord. 
  Brother Presidential Council chairman, brother members: The 
state of loss being experienced by the sons of the Abyan 
Governorate, throughout the republic, and abroad as a result of 
statements transmitted by print and electronic media organs, 
prompts us to urge, through this message, a halt to this media 
propaganda that only harms our governorate. At the same time, 
we call for the facts to be clarified to our people through the 
military committee and the Political Forces Dialogue Committee 
so that we, as well as our people's masses, can unveil those 
behind the bloody conflict from which the sons of Abyan -- who 
are faithful to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity -- 
are suffering. May God grant you success in maintaining the 
interest of the homeland and people. Peace and God's mercy and 
blesses be upon you. 
  [Signed] The sons of Abyan Governorate

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the sons of the Abyan </F>
Governorate "today"--read by announcer] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  An important statement. Among the believers are men who have 
been true to their covenants with Allah; of them some have died 
and some still wait, but they have never changed their 
determination in the least. [Koranic verse] 
  O masses of our lofty Yemeni people: As history recorded in 
its black chapters the hideous crimes and rancorous practices 
perpetrated against the honest people of Abyan by warmongers and 
vampires, it also recorded in its shining chapters the honest 
stands, sacrifices, and heroic acts carried out by the sons of 
Abyan throughout ages. 
  Abyan represented the torch of the revolution. We only 
mention this as a reminder to say that we are proud that Abyan 
is the birthplace of [name indistinct], 'Abbas, [names 
indistinct], Muhmmad 'Ali Haytham, and former Yemeni president 
'Ali Nasir Muhmmad. 
  O masses of our lofty people: The Abyan Governorate, which 
turned over the black chapters of history, [passage indistinct]. 
What took place during the past stages will not prevent us from 
continuing to struggle and defend unity and democracy. Abyan 
will always remain a symbol of loftiness and pride. As it was 
the cradle of revolution and revolutionaries, it will continue 
to be so during the unity. 
  Let the banners of unity and democracy remain high. Splendid 
victory is the lot of our masses. Pride to Abyan and glory to 
its sons. 
  [Signed] The sons of the Abyan Governorate, Sanaa 
  [Dated] 22 [as heard] February 1994

  [Text] The sons of the Mudiyah District in Abyan 
Governorate have issued a statement to the masses of the Yemeni 
people in which they pointed out that while the Yemeni people 
were impatiently awaiting opportunities to end the political 
crisis, which has been besetting them for more than six months, 
and while they were hopefully looking forward to a new stage as 
a result of the signing of the accord document, we were 
surprised by the serious escalations and military movements, 
including the transfer of the Unity Brigade from its camp in 
Mukalla in the Hadramaut Governorate, the transfer of a number 
of tanks and armed vehicles from the 5th Brigade in Aden, and 
the transfer of the 30th Brigade from the Shabwah Governorate. 
All of these were transported to the Abyan Governorate to kill, 
terrorize, and oppress citizens of the Abyan Governorate, 
particularly the sons of the Mudiyah District, who are being 
subjected to the ugliest massacres and the fiercest terrorist 
and inhuman actions for their courageous, nationalist positions 
and for their refusal to be drawn into the current sedition. 
These sons firmly adhere to the option of unity and democracy 
and bravely confront the advocates of division and separation. 
  The statement expresses strong surprise over and 
denunciation 
of the transmission today of a fabricated message on the second 
channel in the name of the sons of the Mudiyah District-- a 
statement which contained many mistakes and lies. This is usual 
for those who are known for such actions throughout their dark 
history. The statement announces to all our people's masses and 
to public opinion inside and outside the country that the 
message attributed to the sons of the Mudiyah District is a 
crime of forgery to be added to the series of ugly crimes 
committed by those who are forging history and facts against the 
interests of our people's sons in general and the sons of the 
Abyan Governorate [words indistinct] in particular. The 
contents of that wicked, forged, and fabricated message, worked 
out in the well-known kitchens of false information, expose the 
evil intentions of those who fabricated the message in order to 
ignite more fires of sedition among the sons of the one Yemeni 
homeland and to distract attention from the reality of the ugly 
crimes being committed against the sons of the Mudiyah District 
at the hands of the Unity Brigade forces and the party militia. 
  The brutal shelling from various heavy, medium, and light 
weapons is continuing, causing great loss of life among the 
innocent and peaceful citizens, as well as much property damage. 
The statement appeals to the masses of the Yemeni people, the 
Presidential Council, and all the political forces and national 
figures to rescue their brothers, the sons of the Mudiyah 
District, as well as other areas of the Abyan Governorate. It 
call for the end of this nightmare that threatens the future of 
their sons and families and the future of the whole homeland. 
It asks for a historic, responsible position to be taken toward 
those adventurers who are blinded by their personal interests 
and their selfishness, who are risking the homeland, and who are 
pushing the people into the furnace of a destructive war. 
  The statement urges those who have stolen the joy from our 
hearts and the smiles from our faces and destroyed the hope that 
was planted at the moment the accord document was signed to 
return to the capital of the country so that its institutions 
can shoulder their responsibilities within the framework of the 
constitutional institutions and to begin to translate the pledge 
and accord document into reality. Instead of doing so, they 
traveled from capital to capital without being asked to and 
without consulting others, ignoring all the legitimate 
institutions, the honor of the Yemeni people, the constitution, 
and all the norms and [words indistinct] in an exposed attempt 
to avoid the implementation of the accord, contain it, and make 
harmful hints that do not serve the interest of the nation, the 
people, and the homeland. 
  The sons of the Mudiyah District concluded their statement 
by 
urging everybody to face up to the challenges that are imposed 
by such irresponsible behavior and to be more alert to 
confronting all plots to undermine unity and democracy. May God 
protect dear Yemen and its unity from any harm and grant us 
success. 
  [Signed] The sons of Mudiyah District.

  [Text] Demonstrations have been staged in a number of 
Yemeni cities to protest the armed attacks on the population of

Council's decisions. The demonstrators emphasized that the 
Armed Forces are the property of the people and protectors of 
the revolution's gains and national unity. They stressed the 
need for commitment to the accord document and that they wanted 
legitimacy, the constitution, and the democratic choice to be

  [Text] Baghdad, 24 Feb (MENA)--A responsible Iraqi Oil 
Ministry source has stated that a high-level Iraqi oil 
delegation will visit Paris soon in response to an invitation 
from the Elf Equitaine and Total companies, which specialize in 
oil exploration projects. 
  A MENA correspondent in Baghdad has learned that 
negotiations 
have been going on behind the scenes between representatives of 
several international oil companies, particularly Western and 
U.S. companies and Iraq, to exploit the Majnun oilfields in 
southeast Iraq, which are known to hold the biggest oil reserves 
in the world. 
  The correspondent has learned from oil experts in Iraq that 
Iraq prefers the French to the Western and U.S. companies 
because it believes that the French stance on the embargo 
imposed on Iraq has recently changed, especially at the Security 
Council. 
  Observers base this view on a statement made by Dr. Riyad 
al-Qaysi, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry under secretary, in which 
he referred to the change in the French stance during a news 
conference he held with UN team leader Rolf Ekeus earlier this 
month. 
  A responsible UN source in Baghdad told MENA's correspondent 
that these oil talks are not regarded as a violation of UN 
resolutions. 
  Iraq has 110 billion barrels of crude oil--the second 
largest 
oil reserves in the world. The Majnun oilfields have 50 billion 
barrels of proven and unproven oil reserves in the so-called 
"al-Rumaylah rectangle," which extends from south Iraq to Kuwait 
and Saudi Arabia and some parts of southwest Iran. 
  This field was one of the reasons the eight-year 
Iraqi-Iranian war erupted.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Doha Qatar Television Service in Arabic 
at 2000 GMT on 12 February 1994 carries a 45-minute recorded 
program on Iraq. The program is entitled "The Blockade," and is 
subtitled "A Special Program on the Impact of the Economic 
Blockade on Iraq." A map of Iraq is shown in yellow. A white 
ring surrounds the middle of the map near Baghdad. No other 
countries are shown on the map, the rest of which is colored 
green. 
  The program opens with a Qatari announcer standing under a 
monument in Baghdad commemorating the Iran-Iraq war. The 
monument consists of two long swords stretching from the two 
sides of a wide avenue and forming a huge arch. The video then 
cuts to show Baghdad streets and people shopping in a market 
place. The announcer opens the program with the following 
announcement: "The blockade has created a big crisis inside 
Iraq. The Iraqi people are looking to the international 
community to end this blockade. Today, what is the main picture 
of the economic, social, and health conditions in Baghdad and 
other Iraqi provinces? To convey this picture from where it is 
happening and from the center of events, a Qatari television 
mission set out on a journey that lasted over 10 hours between 
the Jordanian capital Amman--the only gate to Iraq--and Baghdad. 
It is a trip that conveys several images and many answers to 
what is taking place in Iraq after almost three and a half years 
of blockade." 
  The announcer interviews a citizen who complains that he 
cannot find the medicine prescribed for him by a doctor. The 
citizen blames the blockade for the shortage of medicine. He 
says he "wants the world to see our suffering." Another citizen 
says "all the people need food, not only medicine. The blockade 
is unjust for all the Iraqi people." A third citizen notes that 
children are especially suffering because of lack of medicine. 
However, he notes that "despite the blockade, the Iraqi people 
are standing fast." More citizens complain about the high price 
of food and clothes. The announcer says: "The Iraqi individual 
is facing an economic crisis in view of his low daily or monthly 
income. The average monthly income does not exceed 500 Iraqi 
dinars." A woman says she cannot buy new clothes and has to be 
content with old and hand-stitched clothes. A man says his 
monthly salary is 120 dinars, which is just enough for a meal in 
a restaurant in Baghdad. Another man says his monthly salary is 
125 dinars, while the price of a kilo of meat is 160 dinars. 
Young men cannot get married, as a wedding costs between 50,000 
and 100,000 dinars. He appeals to humanitarian organizations to 
help the Iraqi people. A citizen says that "because of the 
blockade some people have resorted to crime--to theft, 
kidnapping, rape, etcetera." More citizens are interviewed and 
they all complain about the high price of food and clothing. 
The announcer notes that "food staples, such as rice, sugar, 
and flour, are available in most markets of Baghdad and other 
provinces, but their prices are beyond the reach of most Iraqis." 
  In a four-minute interview, Trade Minister Dr. Muhammad 
Mahdi 
Salih is asked what the materials are that can be imported from 
abroad and what the materials are that can be exported under the 
current blockade. He says that no exports are allowed because 
"UN Security Council resolutions still prevent Iraq from 
exporting any commodity." He notes that "after Resolution 687 
was issued and after the military aggression against our country 
stopped, Iraq was allowed to import food and medicine. But how 
can it import when there are no oil exports and when our funds 
in foreign banks, specifically in U.S., British, French, and 
German banks, are still frozen? Therefore, the means of 
importing these materials are also frozen. At the end of 1991, 
we were allowed to import through the frozen funds. We imported 
a quantity of foodstuffs, but another resolution, No. 778, was 
issued at the end of 1992 re-freezing the Iraqi funds and 
preventing Iraq from using them to buy food and medicine." 
  Asked about a certain UN Security Council resolution 
allowing 
Iraq to export a specified quantity of oil -- just enough to 
enable it to import humanitarian materials -- the minister says: 
"In fact, this resolution was designed for the purpose of 
paying the expenses of the inspection teams and other UN 
expenses and not for the purpose of securing the needs of the 
Iraqi people. Therefore, the resolution was designed and its 
technical details were drawn up in such a way as to secure the 
export of a quantity of oil without securing the import of 
materials. This resolution also interferes in the country's 
domestic affairs regarding the distribution of materials to the 
population." 
  Asked about the recent arrival of ships at the Iraqi port of 
Umm Qasr, the minister says: "In fact, when funds are 
available, the materials that are allowed to be imported, such 
as food, come through al-'Aqabah. The Turkish line is also open 
for food imports. However, the problem lies in financing 
imports. As for Umm Qasr port, its opening and the entry of 
ships into it last month enabled Iraq to have direct contacts 
with the outside the world and to import permitted materials and 
commodities. In other words, goods arrive at our national 
territory directly and we have direct contacts with the outside 
the world. This is an essential point on the subject. In 
addition, the cost of imports is reduced when goods come to our 
ports directly. The harsh economic conditions in the country 
require a reduction in the cost of imports when the country is 
in a position to import any quantity of food and medicine." 
  The video then shows the Jordanian border point of 
al-Karamah 
on the Jordanian-Iraqi border and trucks transporting Iraqi 
crude oil to Jordan. More scenes are shown of Iraqi markets and 
more interviews are carried out with Iraqi citizens. 
  The program then carries a two-minute interview with the 
Hashim 'Ali 'Ubayd, under secretary of the Ministry of Finance. 
He says: "The current exchange rate of foreign currencies, 
especially the dollar, in the Iraqi market and in the so-called 
parallel market does not represent the real exchange rate of the 
Iraqi dinar. This is because Iraq's foreign assets and funds 
are frozen. Iraq has not been allowed to export any commodity 
to earn these currencies. The current market of foreign 
currencies is very small and depends on what is available of 
these currencies in the market. It does not represent the real 
exchange rate of the Iraqi dinar." 
  The video then shows children in Iraqi hospitals and notes 
lack of medical equipment, in addition to lack of medicine. 
Several women who were interviewed stress that there is no 
medicine for babies, either in hospitals or in pharmacies. A 
nurse says that babies are suffering from anemia and 
malnutrition. A pediatrician says there are no antibiotics or 
other medicine. 
  In a 8-minute interview, Health Minister Dr. 'Umid Midhat 
Mubarak says: "Regrettably, the unjust UN resolutions have 
affected the situation. We can no longer obtain diagnostic 
materials such as primary chemical materials. We cannot even 
obtain isotopes, which everyone knows cannot be used for 
nonmedical purposes." He says the "mortality rate for children 
under five years old in 1989 was not more than 375 children per 
month. In December 1993, the mortality rate was over 4,000 per 
month. As for citizens over five years old, the mortality rate 
in 1989 was 1,700 per month; now it is approximately 6,500 per 
month." The health minister says most surgery is being postponed 
due to lack of equipment and medicine. He notes that due to lack 
of foreign currencies, Iraqi patients cannot be sent abroad for 
treatment. He regrets that some countries who claim to be 
defenders of human rights have denied entry visas to Iraqi 
patients. He notes that "the brothers in Qatar have recently 
sent medical consignments." He expresses the hope that "the 
brothers and real friends will realize this injustice inflicted 
on every single one of the Iraqi people for purely political 
reasons." He says these reasons are no longer justified and 
there is no need to use them to bring political pressure." 
  In a two-minute interview, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id 
al-Sahhaf is asked whether he expects the blockade imposed on 
Iraq by the UN Security Council to be partially or wholly lifted 
in the near future. He gives the following answer: "We are 
working to complete the implementation of Paragraph 22. Logic 
says that the correct course is for Iraq and the Security 
Council to complete the work together to implement Paragraph 22 
without any political conditions being added to it by any party. 
There is a very clear text. There are requirements which 
should be fulfilled to implement this text. These requirements 
are that Ambassador Ekeus, chairman of the Security Council Ad 
Hoc Committee, and Dr. Hans Blix, director general of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], should submit a 
report to the Security Council, in accordance with the mandate 
given to them, saying that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations 
under Section C, that is Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13. We 
are close to reaching this situation. We will work with the Ad 
Hoc Committee and the IAEA to complete the technical formulas 
for beginning the implementation of the supervision programs in 
accordance with Resolution 715. Consequently, it will be the 
duty of the Security Council to implement Paragraph 22." 
  The video then shows more interviews with Iraqi citizens 
praising the State of Qatar and appealing to Arab states to help 
the Iraqi people. One citizen says "Kuwait returned to its 
people and Jabir returned as its amir. So what does the United 
Nations want? What does the Security Council want? What does 
the world want? What do the great powers want? What do they 
want from the Iraqi people? The people are suffering greatly 
and dying. There is no food, no medicine, and no essential 
goods."

<F P=106> ["Windows" column by Diya' Hasan: "U.S. Administration </F>
Behavior Reveals its Ill Intentions"] 
  [Text] The U.S. administration's behavior and daily stands 
show that its tyranny is aimed at imposing its interests on 
others, contrary to all international rules, even if the others 
are friends and allies. It also attempts to rudely interfere in 
others' internal affairs. 
  Today, I would like to take two examples of this disgraceful 
behavior of the United States, which it is openly following in 
its dealings with the world. 
  The first example is the request Warren Christopher made to 
Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani during 
their recent meeting in Washington. Christopher wanted the 
sisterly Arab state to desist from strengthening its fraternal 
relations with Iraq. The second example is Clinton's arrogant 
request to the Japanese prime minister to impose taxes on the 
Japanese industries exported to the United States and to give 
special facilities to U.S. exports to Japan. He wants to tip 
the trade balance between the two countries in Washington's 
favor. When the Japanese rejected this request that would 
damage their industries, Clinton ordered a series of trade 
measures hostile to Tokyo. This was a declaration of war 
against an ally, well within earshot of the entire world. 
  These two examples shown once again that Washington will 
never be satisfied if it does not impose its will on other 
countries. Qatar is not allowed to practice independent 
decisionmaking with regard to its relations with its sisterly 
and friendly states. And Japan, which a major economic power in 
the world today, is not allowed to compete against U.S. 
industries, but must be forced to direct its development in the 
interest of the United States. 
  Both examples indicate that U.S. policy under any 
administration does not really have any friends or allies in its 
general dealing. How many enemies does the United States have 
today, and how many more will it have in the future? This shows 
the extent to which Washington controls the world. The 
important thing is that the rejection of this hegemony has begun 
in different forms, including the firm rejection represented by 
the Iraqi stand.

<F P=106> [From the "Standpoint" column by 'Adil Sa'd: "Guenther's </F>
Irrefutable Testimony"] 
  [Text] What will draw world public attention to the 
serious information revealed by Professor Ziekvart Hoerst 
Guenther concerning the use of internationally banned nuclear 
ammunition by the United States and its allies in their 
aggression against Iraq? This German doctor has concluded from 
intensive laboratory tests that the Americans and their allies 
used nuclear radioactive weapons in their aggression against 
Iraq, contrary to international conventions banning the use of 
such weapons; foremost of which is the Geneva Convention of 
1949. One of the conclusions reached by this European scientist 
is that several Iraqi children actually died from exposure to 
radiation from the abovementioned ammunition, and that 30-40 
tonnes of radioactive uranium were dropped by U.S. and allied 
forces over the southern desert region of Iraq. 
  There is no doubt whatsoever about Dr. Guenther's findings, 
since they are the result of a scientific and analytical study 
of samples obtained from the battlefield. He has no interest in 
them, other than his desire to serve the truth and to expose the 
aggressors and their false claims, which has subjected him to 
many dangers. Therefore, his findings are considered 
irrefutable testimony. Dr. Gunther wanted to tell this truth so 
it will be added to the other facts and conclusions reached by 
the working team of former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, 
the working group of "Doctors Without Borders," the Harvard 
University Committee, the secretary general of the World Health 
Organization, and several other international organizations and 
figures known for their objectivity and honesty. 
  Professor Guenther's testimony and the previous facts and 
conclusions about the same subject must not, by any moral or 
political standards, be let to pass by without moving the world 
public and regional and international organizations concerned 
with human rights and the causes of peace, condemning the U.S. 
aggressor and its allies, and removing the injustice done to 
Iraq as a result of this despicable act, which violated all 
laws, norms, and values. 
  The U.S. crime of using nuclear weapons against the Iraqis 
is, in fact, a double crime because: First, the United States 
has violated the provisions of an international law, which was 
endorsed by the world community and to which many states have 
given their commitment, headed the United States itself. So by 
torpedoing this law, the United States has assumed full 
responsibility for deliberately committing a crime while aware 
of the great harm it would do. Second, the Americans have 
cheated the United Nations by using it in carrying out their 
odious aggression, which also means that they are responsible 
for the crime of diverting this world organization from the 
noble purposes and objectives enshrined in its charter. We 
cannot possibly imagine the United Nations agreeing to serve as 
a cover for the use of nuclear arms, when it does not stop 
talking about its responsibility to prevent the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons, and when it is the international sponsor of the 
nonproliferation treaty. 
  The world is called upon not to let the case of the U.S. use 
of nuclear weapons against Iraq be forgotten or treated 
slightly. The least that must be done is to stop the 
ramification of that crime in the form of the existing unfair 
blockade, which is in fact a supplement to the nuclear weapons 
used by the Americans and their allies. It is only fair and just 
for world public to agree to the proposal made by Ramsey Clark 
to form an international pressure group in order to urge the 
Security Council and the Sanctions Committee to remove that 
blockade. 
  What the Security Council and the Sanctions Committee can do 
in this regard will correct part of the gross mistake they have 
made. Moreover, it will ensure the return to political logic 
that must prevail in international life.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd al-Jabbar Muhsin: "Iraqi Words on the New </F>
World Order"] 
  [Text] There is a glaring contradiction between the 
so-called "New World Order" and the nature of history. History 
is not unipolar, but is based on a number of contradictions, 
such as the contradiction between dream and reality. Every 
current reality was once a dream, and no matter how satisfactory 
the current reality is, it also has its dream that it wants to 
fulfill. The logic of history is that it is in a constant state 
of evolution. So despite ups and downs in human progress, the 
final outcome is this inevitable evolution. There is also a 
conflict of interests between classes, nations, generations, and 
between the new technologies and their acquired values on the 
one hand, and the prevailing inherited values on the other. Any 
strong blow to a new world order will come from a conflict of 
interests, cultures, beliefs, and ambitions between North and 
South and East and West. 
  Overlooking these facts will make the "New World Order" a 
mere assumption, a proposal, or an aspiration. Even in one 
family, which consists of only a few individuals, it is very 
difficult to devise a way to reconcile the separate aims, 
conflicting desires, and different concerns of its members, let 
alone a situation on a worldwide level. Mankind with all its 
diversities and vast areas is too big to contain in any 
crucible, and to melt and mould on any fire. 
  The problem with the United States is that it is formulating 
its policies in isolation of history, because it is a nation 
without history. 
  The gangster system, which is prevalent in the underworld of 
U.S. cities, in making money, and attaining high position -- 
including even the presidency -- has left its imprint on U.S. 
policy, where might is right. 
  This feeling of power has eliminated the bipolar world 
order. 
To the United States, the world now is a hand-mill turning 
around one pivot, which is the United States of course. 
  There has always been ignorance of time, conflict between 
opposite sides, and of other party or parties. 
  There has always been the feeling that using force or 
threatening to use force is sufficient to make the United States 
assume the role of a deity in Greek mythology. 
  Force of arms can hammer out a new world, where all people 
are slaves and where the United States rules supreme on its 
throne forever. The UN Security Council, with its big and small 
states, is that world, and a knock from its chairman's mallet is 
sufficient to make things happen. 
  But no one seems to think that compared to the world, the 
Security Council is just a tiny drop in an ocean. How many 
billions on our global earth are suffering, dreaming, or fed up 
with their lives? They all seek freedom, food, and honor, and 
they all believe that these aspirations are their legitimate 
right and that it is their duty to work hard in order to attain 
them. 
  How can we combine the casinos of Las Vegas and Monte Carlo, 
the cafes of the Champs-Elysees, and the winter resorts of 
Switzerland with the camps of the Palestinians, the villages of 
India, the alleys of Manila, the famine areas of Somalia, the 
mine that exploded from the bag of history in Yugoslavia, the 
internecine fighting in Afghanistan, and the search for potato 
roots in the debris of the Soviet Union? Indeed, how can we 
combine all of these in one context or formula? Can they, in 
their "New World Order," cancel the conflict of interests 
between the United States and Japan; or between Britain and 
Germany; or between them and the sharks of the EC states? Can 
they solve ethnic, religious, and racial problems and the border 
problems existing since World War I? Can they feed all the 
hungry, or make all people equal in hunger and poverty? They 
cannot. So how will this world order look? Let us assume that 
they can do all that. But this would mean that they have 
defeated the purpose of establishing the New World Order, which 
is to place their interests above the interests of all the other 
states. 
  There remains power. The United States, with all its air and 
naval fleets, ground forces, armies, missiles, security organs, 
media, the additional strength of its allies and agents, its 
funds, and the funds of its oil-rich allies, could not make the 
people of Iraq -- a country small in area and population -- 
budge an inch from its position. So what was the use of this 
power? 
  Iraq remained as it wanted, not as they wanted it to be. The 
same thing happened in Lebanon and is happening in Somalia, 
although at a much-reduced level. The world's garment is 
tattered and its body is exposed to the winds and sun. No 
system is big enough to handle the tragedies of the universe or 
to stem their natural flow. 
  Shaping world destinies in closed chambers means creating 
delusions.

<F P=106> [Article by Nawwaf Abu-al-Hayja': "Boasting About Shame"] </F>
  [Text] About what is the "Hafr al-Batin crowd" boastful? 
Are they boastful because they fought for the liberation of 
Palestine, the Golan, or southern Lebanon? Or, are they 
boastful because they joined forces with the Zionists, the 
Americans, and other enemies of Arabism for the sake of a single 
Arab nation? 
  One of the theorists of Hafiz al-Asad's policy, a freak 
called Zuhayr Diyab, spoke boastfully to the Zionist paper 
HA'ARETZ, thus openly declaring the traitorous normalization 
between the al-Asad regime and the Zionist enemy. What did he 
say? Let us read parts of what this member of Hafiz al-Asad's 
party has said. 
  He said: The Syrian decision to join the peace process was 
not made when President al-Asad accepted the Bush initiative, 
but some 20 years earlier, after the 1973 war when Syria's 
inclination toward recognizing the Jewish state and abandoning 
the policy of eliminating Israel began to crystallize. 
  Why, then, did they get angry when Iraq called the 1973 war, 
the war of reactivation [tahrik]? 
  This typical slanderer, who represents Hafiz al-Asad's 
authority, said: The majority of Syrians -- intellectuals, 
militarymen, businessmen, and politicians -- accept the reality 
of Israeli existence. This proves the matter depended not only 
on a decision by al-Asad, but was also a development that began 
some 20 years ago. 
  Thus, the chain of Arab recognitions is crowned by a 
boastful 
remark that Hafiz al-Asad was the first to recognize the 
aggression and injustice embodied by the Zionist enemy. This is 
not the main point. The main point is that every Arab ruler or 
government official who today rushes to Tel Aviv to kiss the 
ground under the Zionists' feet claims he is doing so because it 
is a public desire and that he is only carrying out the people's 
wish. This was done by Anwar al-Sadat when he embarked on his 
treason in Camp David. But time proved our people in Egypt 
opposed that blatant treason. 
  The Gaza-Jericho agreement, signed on behalf of the 
Palestinian people in the occupied homeland, is also being 
staggered by the overwhelming pressure of public opposition and 
the continuation of the brave intifada. 
  As for the claim by this trivial opportunist that our Syrian 
people accept the Zionist entity, it will, sooner of later, be 
faced by the masses of our people in Syria. But the main 
question is: If the traitors and weaklings now lining up 
outside Tel Aviv are honest when they say they represent the 
wishes of the masses in their countries, why then do they not 
hold free and honest referendums so people can express their 
opinion on a question that affects their security, present, and 
future, as well as the future of the Arab nation? Or does the 
ruler who carries out the orders of his overlords believe he can 
think on behalf of the people, and that he is in a position to 
determine their destiny, even if he has to place all the people 
in his big prison? 
  What appears in the HA'ARETZ interview about normalization 
with the active member of al-Asad's apparatus and party sheds 
light on all the stands and policies al-Asad has adopted since 
1973, including the entry of his forces into Lebanon in 1976, 
his support for the Iranian war against Iraq, his attempts to 
split up the Palestinian organizations and Lebanese forces, his 
open alliance with the Zionists and the other agents in Hafr 
al-Batin, his feverish rush to Madrid, and then Washington, in 
order to liquidate the Palestine question, and his conspiracies 
against the historic leadership of the Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party party since 1966 and up to this moment.

  [Text] Baghdad, 24 Feb (AFP)--Iraqi President Saddam Husayn 
has ordered the demobilization of 24-year-old conscripts who 
have completed their military service, Army Chief of Staff Ahmad 
Ibrahim Hammash announced Thursday [24 February]. 
  General Hammash, quoted by the armed forces newspaper 
AL-QADISIYAH, said several thousand servicemen aged between 21

<F P=106> [Discussion between moderator Itay Engel in the studio and </F>
correspondent Netan'el Semrik in Hebron -- live] 
  [Text] [Semrik] Several moments ago, a senior military 
source revealed that an initial investigation indicated that the 
Arab worshippers were fired upon by two weapons: an M-16 rifle 
and a revolver that apparently were in the possession of the 
Qiryat Arba' resident who opened fire at the worshippers and 
later committed suicide. 
  The authorities are currently investigating the assertions 
made earlier by a witness according to which additional Jews 
assisted the settler who opened fire. The defense establishment 
has no confirmation of this claim which is currently being 
investigated. 
  The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is now dispatching 
reinforcements to Judaea and Samaria. A curfew has been imposed 
on Hebron and there is a general closure on the Gaza Strip. 
Arab workers from the Gaza Strip are not being permitted to 
enter Israel. The IDF General Staff is calling on the Jewish and 
Arab residents of the territories and Israel to show restraint. 
A series of steps are being taken at this time in an attempt to 
prevent any exacerbation of tensions or a deterioration of the 
situation in the territories. 
  Reports streaming in from Hebron, which as mentioned earlier 
is under curfew, indicate that there are small gatherings of 
Arab residents. Settlers reported stonethrowing incidents 
around Hebron and near Halhul. Nevertheless, three hours after 
the bloody incident at the Cave of the Patriarchs, the security 
forces seem to have the situation under control and there are no 
serious incidents. 
  [Engel] You said that the initial investigation indicates 
that two weapons were used in the shooting. Do the results of 
the investigation also specify whether the man who committed the 
massacre used both weapons or did he have an accomplice? 
  [Semrik] The current premise of the security forces is that 
the shooting was carried out by one man, a settler from Qiryat 
Arba' disguised in an IDF officer's uniform. As far as is known 
at the present time, he was carrying two firearms, an M-16 rifle 
and a revolver. We will have more accurate details later on. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0700 GMT on 25 February 
adds that "in the Gaza Strip this morning, tires are burning in 
many locations and stones are being hurled at the security 
forces. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the residents 
of the strip are being updated in Hebron through loudspeakers in 
the mosques. From time to time, instigatory calls are heard 
from the mosques in between prayers being read from the Koran. 
There have so far not been any reports of serious clashes 
between the army and residents."]

  [Text] The settler who this morning murdered the Arab 
worshipers in the Cave of the Patriarchs is Dr. Barukh 
Goldstein, a Qiryat Arba' doctor. Dr. Goldstein immigrated from 
the United States. He was a Kakh member and was its candidate 
to the Qiryat Arba' local elections. During the shooting spree, 
Dr. Goldstein wore his IDF [Israel Defense Forces] uniform with 
the insignia of his rank of captain in the military reserves. 
Dr. Goldstein was killed after the shooting, but it is not 
clear whether he committed suicide or the worshipers killed him.

  [Text] A previously unknown movement, the Rebels Movement 
[Tnu'at Hamordim], an extreme Jewish movement whose members 
apparently belong to or are affiliated in some way with the Kakh 
Movement, called IDF Radio's news studio a short time ago and 
assumed responsibility for the massacre in Hebron. The 
anonymous caller said that the Rebels Movement assumes 
responsibility for the massacre committed to avenge the slaying 
of Rabbi Me'ir Kahana, the late leader of the Kakh Movement.
