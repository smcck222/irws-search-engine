  [Text] Three leaflets were disseminated over the last few 
hours throughout Judaea and Samaria, the main one issued from 
Orient House, the PLO headquarters in East Jerusalem. This 
leaflet notes that it is the Israeli Government that is fully 
responsible for the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
This leaflet, like other leaflets disseminated in Judaea and 
Samaria today, does not at all refer to the possibility that 
this massacre was carried out by a private individual as an act 
of insanity. This leaflet calls for two things: to strip the 
settlers in Judaea and Samaria from the weapons given them by 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], and to declare three days of 
mourning in the territories, as of today, in the wake of the 
killing of about 50 Palestinians, residents of Hebron, in the 
Cave of the Patriarchs this morning. 
  Another leaflet was issued by Fatah, and it, too, denounces 
the massacre. This leaflet calls on the world to defend the 
Palestinians who, as the leaflet puts it, are not sufficiently 
protected by IDF soldiers, and are thus exposed to slaughter by 
the settlers. 
  Yet another leaflet, jointly drafted by two Rejectionist 
Fronts -- the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and 
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- 
categorically calls for a halt to the Israeli-Palestinian talks 
in the wake of this morning's massacre in the Cave of the 
Patriarchs. This leaflet also calls for a reaction by the 
Palestinian street. 
  We have yet another manifesto, circulated by a Jewish 
organization. The Kahana Hay organization has issued an 
announcement to the press, terming it a Purim deed in Hebron. 
The Kahana Hay members are mourning the death of martyr Barukh 
Goldstein who consecrated the name of God by his death, as 
Samson did at the time. Goldstein did what the Jews in Persia 
did, as noted in the Book of Esther, when they struck at all 
their enemies and did as they pleased with their foes. This is 
an excerpt of the statement to the press issued by Kahana Hay.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has issued his 
reaction to the incident in Hebron: A murder, an horrendous 
crime was committed today at a site in Hebron holy to Jews and 
Arabs. The prime minister and defense minister, the government 
ministers, and the citizens of the State of Israel strongly 
condemn the horrendous murder which struck innocent people and 
led to the shedding of blood of blameless human beings who were 
offering their prayers on the occasion of the Ramadan fast. 
  On my and the government's behalf, we express our sorrow and 
send our sincere condolences to the families of the victims and 
the Palestinian people, and we wish a speedy recovery to the 
wounded. We call on everybody, both Arabs and Jews, to evince 
restraint and not to get dragged into actions which might worsen 
the situation. 
  The members of the political-security Inner Cabinet have 
been 
summoned to a meeting at noon today to discuss the situation in 
the wake of this evil incident. 
  The prime minister goes on to say: This is a tough day for 
peace-loving people, both Arabs and Jews, but the demented 
actions of psychopaths will not prevent reconciliation and the 
making of peace between the citizens of the State of Israel and 
the Palestinian people. We will do everything necessary -- and 
the deliberations on the making of peace may be accelerated -- 
to prevent misunderstandings, remove obstacles, and together 
arrive at the day of peace, the day when extremists on both 
sides will lose all hope of harming the peace process from which 
we do not want to retreat. 
  In his statement, the prime minister makes clear that 
instructions have been issued to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
and other security forces to do whatever is permitted and 
possible within the framework of the law to uphold public order 
and to prevent incidents and bloodshed.

<F P=106> [Report by Karmela Menashe outside the prime minister's </F>
bureau in Tel Aviv -- live] 
  [Text] Good day to you. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
spoke to Yasir 'Arafat on the phone a short while ago. Rabin 
told 'Arafat: On behalf of the government I would like to 
express shock over the brutal murder by this madman which 
resulted in the death of innocent people during Ramadan, at a 
place holy to both Jews and Arabs. I want to tell you that this 
is a disgrace to us all. We condemned this insane act and will 
do everything we can to ascertain what caused it. Although we 
know that the murderer committed suicide, we know that three 
days ago he said he wanted to carry out a dramatic act in order 
to halt the peace talks. He acted against us all, but 
especially, he killed innocent people, and we will adopt all 
measures to restore quiet and to check whether he had 
accomplices. I wanted to speak to you directly and to express 
the government's condolences to you and to the Palestinian 
people. I can find no words to denounce this act. Let us speed 
up the effort to do what we committed ourselves to in the 
Declaration of Principles. I am sorry that this happened now, 
in the middle of our attempt of reaching a conclusion on the 
Gaza and Jericho issues. As an Israeli, I am ashamed of this 
act. 
  The meeting at the Defense Ministry here in Tel Aviv, with 
the participation of the prime minister and ministers, is still 
continuing. U.S. Ambassador Djerejian came here and left the 
meeting a short while ago.

  [Text] A senior political source has just told us that he 
hopes that the PLO will not suspend the peace talks which are 
slated to resume in Cairo on Monday [28 February]. For the time 
being, it should be emphasized that no such decision has been 
announced in any of the condemnations issued by the PLO. A 
member of the Israeli team to talks with the PLO said that the 
incident will harm the peace process, but it must not be 
stopped. The senior political source said that the horrible 
massacre must not play into the hands of the extremists who are 
opposed to the political process. We were told by this source: 
We could have many reasons, after every terrorist action or 
murder in the territories, to stop the discussions with the PLO, 
but it would be a terrible mistake to suspend the talks. 
  The General Staff and defense establishment have held 
deliberations and engaged in situation assessments over the last 
few hours. The chief of staff instructed the cancellation of 
all vacations of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] commanders and 
Civil Administration heads. Military elements say that 
commanders have been instructed to avoid violent friction with 
the residents of the territories, but at the same time, to 
maintain law and order at all costs and to prevent a 
deterioration of the security situation. It has been reported 
that Israeli medical teams are aiding the wounded Palestinians.

  [Excerpt] The meeting of the Ministerial Committee on 
National Security Affairs is just beginning. Ministers 
estimated that the moves decided by the committee will be 
operational moves aimed at calming moods, not political moves. 
Still, on the political plane, Major General Amnon Shahaq, the 
head of the Israeli delegation to the Taba talks, relayed a 
message to Dr Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Palestinian 
delegation, expressing shock at the murders in Hebron. Shahaq 
passed on the condolences of the Israeli delegation with regard 
to the murder, and expressed the hope that this tragedy would 
not harm the effort for peace, an effort which is obviously 
aimed at preventing such incidents. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In reaction to the Hebron incidents, the president 
of the state, 'Ezer Weizman, said that this is a terrible day 
for Jews and Arabs who live in this land. There is no 
understanding of, nor forgiveness for such a horrendous act, the 
president said, extending his condolences to the bereaved 
families, the residents of Hebron, and the entire Arab 
population in Israel and world-wide. The president added: This 
act must not harm the peace process and the chance of fostering 
cooperation and coexistence in the region. At this difficult 
hour, I call upon all leaders, religious and otherwise, of all 
parties -- Jews, Muslims, and Christians -- to share in the pain 
of the unnecessary loss of life, but to show restraint and to 
prevent a further deterioration. 
  Israel's Chief Rabbi Me'ir Lau said we have always opposed 
bloodshed, especially when it is committed against a religious 
background, and at a holy site and during prayers especially. 
It is the right of every person to pray to his God according to 
his faith, and anyone who deprives him of doing so is 
undermining the base of support on which human beings rely, 
particularly members of the Jewish nation who suffered from 
persecution and bloodshed throughout the ages. 
  Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert has instructed the establishment 
of an emergency committee which will coordinate with the 
security forces on action necessary to prevent an escalation in 
the wake of the Hebron incidents.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Police Minister Moshe Shahal by </F>
Itay Engel and Tamar Landau -- live] 
  [Text] [Engel] What do you know at this point about what 
happened in Hebron? 
  [Shahal] I have been in constant contact with the police 
commissioner since the moment the incident was first reported. 
Together with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], we are 
investigating and checking all the circumstances of the incident. 
  First of all, I would like to express my sorrow at the loss 
of life and at this horrendous murder. I categorically denounce 
the slaying of human beings, whatever their nationality may be. 
The Israel Police and the security forces will make every 
possible effort to bring the people responsible for this act to 
trial. I call on all the sides to evince restraint and not to 
succumb to provocations on either side. 
  [Landau] Sir, the details in our possession are quite 
sketchy and we would like you to fill us in. When did the 
incident start? 
  [Shahal] I received the first report before 0600 [0400 GMT] 
this morning from the police commissioner, but I assume that the 
incident began earlier. Other details are currently being 
investigated. At this point, the picture is not yet entirely 
clear. We know that there were quite a few fatalities, and the 
toll reported to me was from six to eight dead. To repeat, I am 
in constant contact with the police commissioner, and I believe 
the picture will become clearer soon because an investigation is 
currently under way. 
  [Landau] Do you know the identity of the Israeli from Qiryat 
Arba' who opened fire at the Arabs? 
  [Shahal] We have the name of a Jew who was found there, who 
is either wounded or dead. We do not yet know what his role was 
in the incident, and we are currently collecting testimony from 
eyewitnesses to ascertain what exactly happened. 
  [Engel] From the initial details in our possession, we 
realize that the incident did not start this morning but last 
night, when Jewish and Muslim worshipers converged at the Cave 
of the Patriarchs, respectively for their Purim and Ramadan 
prayers, and clashed with each other. Were the police ready for 
such an eventuality? How many troops did you have on the spot? 
  [Shahal] You must understand that the Israel Police are not 
responsible for order and security in the territories, and it is 
only an auxiliary force helping bring lawbreakers to court. 
Israel Police and Border Police troops are under IDF command 
and are part of its deployment. They tried to calm down and 
deal with the situation. As said, I do not think I can comment 
about what happened this morning before I receive more accurate 
information. 
  [Landau] As far as we know, the Arabs attacked by the 
Israeli caught him, beat the hell out of him, and actually 
killed him. 
  [Shahal] You know more than I do. We have not yet confirmed 
those details. Therefore, it would be irresponsible on my part 
to comment on something about which I have no accurate 
information from an authoritative source. 
  [Engel] Could you tell us what is going on now in Hebron? 
We understand that serious riots erupted there in the wake of 
the incident. 
  [Shahal] There is a great deal of tension. Consequently, I 
call on the entire Arab and Jewish population to evince 
restraint and not to succumb to any provocations on either side. 
We have experienced the murder of Jews at the hands of Arab 
terrorists. Unfortunately, we are faced with an incident whose 
specifics are not yet clear. A measure of restraint will serve 
those who want to uphold the peace and save human lives. The 
security forces, the IDF, the Border Police, and the Israel 
Police are prepared to deal with the incident. To repeat, all 
these bodies are in constant contact to prevent a deterioration 
of the situation in the wake of this horrendous act. 
  [Engel] Has the prime minister been briefed on the details 
of the incident? 
  [Shahal] Absolutely, he is being briefed all the time. All 
the pertinent elements are being briefed almost in real time. 
  [Landau] Are you contemplating the possibility of declaring 
the area a closed military zone? 
  [Shahal] I cannot answer this question, which is being dealt 
with in ongoing consultations. We must first check the incident 
to ascertain exactly what happened. 
  [Engel] Minister Shahal, thank you very much.

  [Text] The entire spectrum of the Israeli political 
establishment, both right-wing and left-wing parties, have 
condemned the bloodshed in Hebron. Minister Binyamin 
Ben-Eli'ezer called on Yasir 'Arafat to take steps to calm the 
Arab public and not inflame passions. Ben-Eli'ezer called for 
the rapid separation of religious fanatics from both sides, 
noting that he feared that there were additional extreme 
right-wing lunatics who were capable of perpetrating such deeds. 
  Minister 'Uzi Bar'am said that whoever was responsible for 
this crime, which put the Jewish people to shame, would receive 
their just comeuppance in witnessing the rapid promotion of the 
peace process and the division of Eretz Yisra'el between the 
Palestinian and Jewish peoples. Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that 
if any connection is proved between the shooter and the Kahana 
Hay organization or the Committee for Security on the Roads then 
immediate action must be taken to legally ban these 
organizations. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that the way to fight 
Arab terrorism is not through waging Jewish terrorism, which is 
totally unacceptable. Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan said that 
the criminal behavior of the shooter is a mortal blow to the 
settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Knesset Member 
[MK] Ra'anan Kohen said that this serious incident necessitates 
the immediate convening, even today, of the Knesset's Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee. Moledet leader Rehav'am Ze'evi 
condemned the murder of innocent people in Hebron. The 
reactions of the political establishment were reported by our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht. 
  Tzvi Katzover, the head of the Qiryat Arba' local council, 
said that the vast majority of Qiryat Arba' residents condemn 
the massacre and are shocked by the murder of innocent people.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Construction and Housing Minister </F>
Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer by Itay Engel; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Engel] What is your reaction to this morning's 
grave incident in Hebron? 
  [Ben-Eli'ezer] It was a very grave incident. I sharply 
denounce the attack. It came not only at the wrong time, but it 
could lead to the situation getting out of control unless the 
following conditions are observed: All the security forces, 
especially the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], must show maximum 
determination and control on the ground. There is no room for 
mercy to anybody. In this situation, there are two 
possibilities: Either we immediately clamp down on everybody or 
there is havoc. At the same time, the IDF, the security forces, 
and the political echelon, must and can bring about steps to 
calm down tempers. I reiterate my long-term conclusion that 
when extremists on both sides -- and this time religious 
extremists -- live together, such a situation is inevitable. 
  [Engel] This incident is not linked to the IDF's action in 
the field. We understood from Qiryat Arba' local council head 
Beni Qatzover that the assailant was mentally unstable, at least 
lately, yet he had weapons and plenty of ammunition which he 
could use whenever he felt like it. How can the security forces 
or the political establishment cope with such a situation? 
  [Ben-Eli'ezer] I heard Qatzover saying that the man was 
mentally unstable. It is a shame that we found out about that 
after he murdered others and committed suicide. I think that 
political and municipal officials have to cooperate with the 
authorities, despite all the difficulties involved, to prevent 
crazies from carrying weapons. There are extremists in the 
territories belonging to very extreme movements who are no less 
dangerous than that crazy man. 
  [Engel] How will this grave incident influence the 
negotiations with the Palestinians? 
  [Ben-Eli'ezer] It will definitely not contribute to the 
talks. 
  [Engel] Was Israel in touch with the Palestinians this 
morning? 
  [Ben-Eli'ezer] I have not had any contacts. It is possible 
that others have. I think contacts are vital and coordination 
between the two leaderships is critical. I would welcome such 
moves. We must remember that we are in the midst of the Ramadan 
fast, which will bring the entire Islamic world up in arms. How 
can we go and tell them that a crazy man was responsible? We 
must not ease up our control on the territories and our efforts 
to return calm through talks and actions. 
  [Engel] We understand that the prime minister plans to 
convene the Inner Cabinet. 
  [Ben-Eli'ezer] I think that is the right thing to do. 
  [Engel] Can you tell us what you think it will decide? 
  [Ben-Eli'ezer] No, I cannot. I am no prophet. I can only 
say one thing: We do not have any interest in bringing about an 
escalation of the situation. Our only interest is to restore 
calm. We are not going to war against either side. In my view, 
it is a grave escalation of the situation because if whoever did 
it is crazy. It is something you have no control over unless as 
I said, people cooperate. I believe that any decision made will 
be aimed at controlling the situation and restoring calm.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Dani Yatom, commander of the </F>
Central Command, by reporter Gil Litman and other unidentified 
correspondents, in Hebron -- live] 
  [Text] [Litman] General, can you tell us what happened in 
the Cave of the Patriarchs this morning? 
  [Yatom] A very grave incident occurred in the Cave of the 
Patriarchs this morning. We are still holding debriefings. I 
came here to investigate with the other commanders. What we 
know at this moment, which is not everything, is the following: 
At about 0530 this morning, a Jewish resident, an Israeli 
citizen, entered the prayer hall in the Cave of Patriarchs where 
several hundred Palestinians were praying, opened fire in all 
directions with a Galil rifle, killing a number of Arab 
worshipers, and wounding others. Later, he apparently committed 
suicide by shooting himself. 
  As I said, the event is extremely grave. It is an horrendous 
act by an armed man at a group of absolutely innocent 
worshipers. I would like to take this opportunity not only to 
denounce what happened, but also to express my condolences to 
the families of the fatalities and to wish the wounded a speedy 
recovery. 
  [Litman] General, do you know what the current situation in 
Hebron is? We are receiving reports about disturbances not only 
in Hebron but throughout Judaea and Samaria, and about 
additional Arab casualties due to IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
fire following many stoning incidents and riots. Can you 
confirm this? 
  [Yatom] That is inaccurate. In Hebron, there are no 
disturbances at the moment. I am not saying there will not be 
any, there might be later on, because the Arabs are in a state 
of high tension. We are sending forces into the area in order 
to restore calm as much as possible. To that end, we imposed a 
curfew on Hebron city. There are attempts in several other 
places in Judaea and Samaria to disturb the peace. IDF and 
security forces are being sent in to prevent disturbances. 
There are no additional casualties among the Arabs. A 
Palestinian in Hebron hurled a firebomb at a member of our 
forces a few minutes ago. He was shot in the leg, wounded, and 
captured. 
  [Litman] General Yatom, what can you tell us officially 
about the number of fatalities in the Cave of Patriarchs 
massacre? 
  [Yatom] I do not have an official count. The number of 
fatalities is 10, 16, or even more. Neither we nor the 
Palestinians have yet succeeded in counting the number of 
fatalities and making a full report on the number of casualties. 
I hope the figure will be as low as possible. 
  The act was the initiative of a single person who carried 
out 
a despicable act by shooting at an innocent crowd. I can 
understand the outrage among the Palestinians in Judaea and 
Samaria. I cannot agree to disturbances. I do not think a new 
situation has been created. We will take action to restore calm 
and to make sure there are no disturbances. 
  [IDF Radio's Netan'el Semrik] Did the Israeli assailant 
operate on his own? 
  [Yatom] The Israeli acted on his own, and as things appear 
now, it was the initiative of one man. I do not know what 
happened to him, but there is no doubt that it was the act of a 
crazy man. We increased protection on the Palestinian and Jewish 
populations in the Hebron and Qiryat Arba' vicinities. I did 
not recommend in the past and I still do not recommend that the 
Jewish public avoid travelling. I would like to say what I said 
in the past: Whoever has to travel on Judaea and Samaria roads 
in order to do whatever he thinks he has to do, can do so. We 
will provide the necessary security, especially in this area. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] We have different figures on 
fatalities. 
  [Yatom] You have data, and I have data. I do not know if 
information is accurate. I very much hope that my reports are 
correct and yours are inaccurate. I cannot promise anything. I 
checked after some of them were published in the media. We gave 
clear instructions to the forces to avoid as much as possible 
opening fire on disturbers of the peace or on crowds. The order 
is to open fire only if the lives of soldiers and security 
forces are endangered. In all other cases, the instructions are 
clear, and unequivocal: Do not open fire. We will disperse the 
disturbances and demonstrations using other means. 
  [Litman] General Yatom, will you change the orders in the 
Cave of the Patriarchs, a sensitive location, where Jewish and 
Arab worshipers pray together? 
  [Yatom] Jews and Arabs have been praying together at the 
Cave of the Patriarchs for many years. The prayer arrangements 
permit both the Jews and the Muslims to express their religious 
feelings. The prayers sessions there are definitely complex 
because the prayers often take place simultaneously -- in 
different halls, but at the same time. There is no doubt that 
this is a charged place. I do not know if in the wake of this 
grave action we will have to issue new instructions. The risk 
is that friction between Jews and Arabs will break out due to 
close contact between two groups of worshipers. This danger has 
been with us for many years. 
  [Corespondent] General Yatom, were there IDF soldiers in the 
Cave of the Patriarchs during the bloodbath, and should the 
instructions be changed so that only unarmed people enter the 
cave? 
  [Yatom] IDF soldiers were in the vicinity of the Cave of the 
Patriarchs this morning, as they always are, since an IDF force 
has been deployed at the cave for many years and its job is to 
safeguard the place, especially externally. The prayer 
arrangements permit the Muslims and Jews to enter, often at the 
same time. For many years, the Israeli worshipers have entered 
the Cave of the Patriarchs with their weapons. We make sure 
that the weapons are emptied of their ammunition. There is no 
doubt that we will have to review the situation. I cannot say 
whether following the review we will issue new instructions. 
  I would like to add that we offered all our assistance to 
the 
Palestinians in this grave incident. At one stage, a request 
was made to provide helicopters to transfer some of the gravely 
wounded Palestinian casualties to hospital. I approved it 
immediately, but the Palestinians withdrew their request. They 
preferred to evacuate them in a different way. 
  [Litman] General, you are also the prime minister's defense 
secretary. Did you report to him on what happened in Hebron and 
can you tell us what is happening in other areas of Judaea and 
Samaria, which are under your authority? 
  [Yatom] I am now the Central Command's commander and I 
report to the prime minister only via the chief of staff. As I 
have said, except for reports about disturbances and riots in 
the Bethlehem area, I have no other reports, which means there 
are no other disturbances. In reference to the assailant, his 
identity is known to us. I can say that he entered the place 
wearing an IDF uniform with his rank insignia from the reserves. 
He is an officer in the reserves. 
  [Correspondent] General, in the General Staff and Central 
Command consultations will a decision be made to sharpen the 
divisions between the Jewish and Arab public, to impose curfews, 
and perhaps even a closure? 
  [Yatom] I do not want to go into these things now. As I 
said, this event will force us to study the present 
arrangements, especially where Jews and Arabs coexist. We will 
study the issue and then act.

  [Text] In Hebron, there have been violent clashes between 
Jews and Arabs at the Tomb of the Patriarchs. An unspecified 
number of Arabs were reported to have been killed and there is a 
report that a Jew was hit. There were reports of shots at the 
scene, but details are still sketchy. The area has been 
declared a closed military zone. 
  A resident of Har Hadar, north of Jerusalem, was seriously 
injured last night when stones were thrown at her car near 
Ramallah. She was taken by ambulance to Hadassah Hospital at 'En 
Kerem. The incident occurred when the car in which she was 
travelling encountered a stone roadblock near the village of 
Biddu. In a stone throwing incident near Tulkarm, two Israelis 
were lightly hurt when stones shattered the windshield of the 
Egged bus in which they were travelling. They were taken to 
hospital. Shots were fired at a vehicle bearing Israeli license 
plates near 'Imanu'el. No one was hurt and no damage was caused.

  [Text] There is currently a tense quiet in Hebron. The 
security forces acted forcefully to restore order. Our 
correspondent Gil Litman reports that four Arab residents were 
apparently killed by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] gunfire. Large 
crowds of Arabs rioted at the intersection of the road leading 
from Bethlehem to Bayt Jala. Large Army forces dispersed the 
rioters with gunshots. Witnesses to the incident told our 
correspondent Ron Nesi'el that four residents were injured. Two 
people suffered from gunshot wounds and two others were injured 
by inhaling tear gas. 
  A general strike is being observed in East Jerusalem. The 
Fatah organization has declared three days of mourning and a 
general strike in the Gaza Strike. 
  Arab residents are now throwing stones and rioting 
throughout 
Judaea and Samaria. There were serious clashes between local 
residents and the security forces on the Trans-Judaea highway, 
near the village of Tarqumiyah. In Hebron, the Border Police 
shot and wounded a youth who had thrown a firebomb at the 
policeman. The commander of the Border Police arrived in Hebron 
in order to closely follow Border Police operations in the area.

  [Text] There are violent incidents and riots by residents 
in numerous places in the territories. Our correspondent Moti 
Amir reports that 28 residents were wounded in the Gaza Strip by 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] gunfire. Fire was directed at an 
Israeli car and a Border Police patrol in Bethlehem. The car 
was damaged, but its passengers were not harmed. A while later, 
an Israeli bus was stoned, and one of the passengers fired his 
gun, killing one of the stone throwers. The IDF imposed a 
curfew on the Bethlehem area. 
  Stones were hurled at cars in the garages in Nazareth. Calls 
were heared from the town's mosques not to forgive the massacre. 
The commander of the police's northern district conferred with 
area notables, expressed his sympathy for the Arab population, 
and tried to calm down moods. 
  The defense minister's media adviser denies Hebron 
physicians' claims that the IDF and Israeli hospitals refrained 
from extending aid to the Hebron casualties. He told our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht that the IDF offered helicopters for 
the transfer of the wounded, and that Jerusalem hospitals 
prepared to receive them, but the Arab physicians rejected all 
IDF offers. 
  The Health Ministry has deployed over the last hour to 
extend 
all possible medical aid to hospitals that treat the Hebron 
wounded. Our correspondent 'Ofra Nehmad notes that Dr Yehoshu'a 
Shemer, the Health Ministry's assistant director general 
announced that he instructed the blood bank to prepare as many 
blood units as necessary for the Arab medical elements, as well 
as to extend any other medical assistance. Our correspondent 
notes that seven of the Hebron wounded reached the Jerusalem 
Hadassah hospitals, and Magen David Adom ambulances are on the 
alert to transfer wounded people to the town's hospitals.

  [Excerpts] Muslim worshipers rioted on Temple Mount 
following Friday prayers and army forces are now dispersing the 
rioters. The Muslim worshipers first congregated near the 
Mahkama [court] building and hurled stones at the media, 
wounding a camerawoman. Stones were also thrown at the Western 
Wall compound and the Jewish worshipers were evacuated. Our 
correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that four policemen were 
lightly wounded in the Temple Mount riots. 
  There was also a riot near the Nabulus Gate by Muslims who 
had left Temple Mount prayers. They threw stones and bottles at 
the police forces and some of them were detained. Our 
correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that thousands of worshipers 
who left Temple Mount are now standing around the Nabulus Gate 
compound and refuse to disperse. Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert 
set up an emergency headquarters in coordination with the 
security forces. 
  In Kefar Sava, a man was attacked with an ax, apparently by 
an Arab. He was transferred in very grave condition to Me'ir 
Hospital. The perpetrator escaped. Our correspondent Yafa Glick 
reports that the attacked man's revolver was taken from him. 
The police set up roadblocks and detained residents from the 
territories for questioning. [passage omitted] 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that during the clashes 
with the residents of the territories, a border policeman and 
three policemen were wounded. 
  Since the morning, there have been violent incidents and 
riots in many locations in the territories. Shots were fired at 
Israeli vehicles, and there were many stonings of Israeli 
vehicles by Arabs. In the wake of those incidents, the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] imposed a curfew on Hebron and the 
Bethlehem area, and a closure on the Gaza Strip, but the IDF is 
trying to avoid unnecessary confrontations with the local Arab 
population. The IDF spokesman announced that the IDF has been 
beefed up in the territories.

  [Text] The man attacked with an ax in Kefar Sava, by an 
Arab apparently, died of his wounds, our correspondent Yafa 
Glick reports. The police believe that the motive of the murder 
was nationalistic and are looking for eyewitnesses. The 
assailant escaped, apparently with the attacked man's revolver. 
  Three more people were killed in the territories this 
morning 
in incidents with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports that a youth was shot inside a 
mosque in Nabulus and two locals were killed in incidents in 
Gaza and the al-Burayj refugee camp. There is rioting in 
Nabulus and Gaza, as well as in the Jabalyah refugee camp. 
  Over 40 Gazans were wounded in rioting this morning. In 
Jericho and Ramallah, police stations were stoned and the IDF 
responded with fire and tear gas. In Jabalyah, a terrorist 
tried to throw explosives, but they blew up in his hands. Four 
border policemen were also wounded in the territories this 
morning. The IDF spokesman said the forces have been beefed up 
in the territories. 
  Thousands of Muslim worshipers are still congregated on 
Jerusalem's Temple Mount, and many of them rioted and hurled 
stones at police forces, the media, and the Western Wall. The 
police used tear gas to stop the stone throwing. Large police 
forces are concentrated around the Temple Mount to prevent the 
rioting from expanding. Seven policemen were hurt in clashes on 
the Temple Mount. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that 
it seems that there are casualties among the Muslim worshipers 
on the Temple Mount. There was also a riot by Muslim worshipers 
near Nabulus Gate. These worshipers were eventually dispersed 
and some of them detained. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem 
reports that thousands are still congregated at the Nabulus Gate 
and are not going home. 
  Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert sharply denounces the Hebron 
murder. In an interview to Qol Yisra'el, Mr. Olmert called on 
Jerusalem's Arab residents not to be incited into acts of 
retaliation. 
  Qiryat Arba' and Hebron Jewish leaders conferred with the 
Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza 
Strip and issued a manifesto expressing regret for the Cave of 
Patriarchs murder as well as condolences to the families of the 
fatalities. The settlers hold the Israeli Government responsible 
for the action, but urge avoiding any harm to innocent people. 
In the meeting, the settlement leaders called on Major General 
Mufaz, the IDF commander in Judaea and Samaria, to step up the 
protection and safeguarding of Jewish residents in the 
territories. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports from Hebron 
that the town is generally quiet. The Cave of the Patriarchs 
has been closed. 
  The Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs is 
currently convened in a special session to discuss the 
situation. Prior to the session, Prime Minister Rabin had called 
for a special news conference in which he issued a condemnation 
for the murder in Hebron. Our correspondent Karmela Menashe 
reports that Peace Now activists are demonstrating near the 
place where the committee is convened. They tried to break into 
the prime minister's bureau, but police forces pushed them back. 
  Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that commercial strike 
was declared in many Arab Galilee villages, and mourning 
processions took place in several of them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
correspondent Paulo Dentinho; place and date not given--recorded 
in English with superimposed Portuguese translation] 
  [Text] The Israeli prime minister has granted an exclusive 
interview to RTP. Yitzhaq Rabin believes that the agreement 
with the PLO will be concluded within two months at most. He 
was speaking to Paulo Dentinho: 
  [Dentinho] Now that 'Arafat seems to be losing power to the 
radicals, are you not afraid that the future Palestinian police 
force might become a threat to Israel? 
  [Rabin] I was aware of that before. When we reach an 
agreement on implementing the first phase, starting with Gaza 
and Jericho, it will be a detailed agreement in which the two 
sides, Israel and the PLO, will set down their undertakings. I 
believe that it can be put into practice now, or within two 
months at most. 
  [Dentinho] One question about Jerusalem. The Palestinians, 
too, want the city for themselves. Do you believe Jerusalem 
will have a special status? Would you approve of two mayors for 
the city? 
  [Rabin] By no means. This matter will have to be negotiated, 
at most [as heard] two years after the implementation of the 
first phase of the agreement on Gaza and Jericho. So, instead 
of occupying myself with matters that are irrelevant at the 
moment -- because it is the first steps that will decide the 
fate of the ultimate goal -- we will instead focus on what must 
be done immediately and on what is laid down in the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement. 
  [Dentinho] Let us imagine that total peace has been 
achieved. 
How long do you think it will take for Palestinians and Israelis 
to forget 50 years of conflict? 
  [Rabin] The time has come to bring it to an end, to say 
enough is enough to the bloodshed, and to concentrate on 
changing the reality. I believe that the Israelis are willing 
to do so and to implement the agreement. I hope the 
Palestinians will honor their undertakings and do likewise.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Avner Regev: "A Few Musings Between the </F>
Interim and the Permanent"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The negotiating teams are 
dealing with the many issues as if nothing was wrong. 
Meanwhile, murderous attacks have become routine, one event 
after another, and warnings conveyed to various elements that 
the terrorist attacks have to stop have done no good; this will 
have to be solved in some way. 
  A military reaction, such as a closure on the Strip and the 
West Bank, is one of the options discussed today. The police 
minister and the chief of staff have openly discussed it. As 
far as the Palestinians are concerned, a hermetic closure will 
once again place Jerusalem -- which will be severed from Judaea, 
Samaria, and Gaza -- on the agenda. A closure on the 
territories, which would be parallel to the implementation of 
the agreement with the Palestinians this time, may create a 
situation in which autonomy will be implemented over the entire 
territory long before the timeframe envisaged in the original 
plan. 
  The current situation, in which tension in Lebanon rises 
daily and the security deterioration continues, will eventually 
affect the talks with the Palestinians. Top officials in 
Washington as well as Jerusalem have recently observed more than 
once that the prime minister is not particularly insistent on 
the Syrian issue, and with the exception of an occasional 
statement about his desire to advance the Syrian track, Rabin 
seems unconcerned. This, although al-Asad has not made the 
awaited declaration about the nature of peace. 
  The prime minister seems to be disinterested in launching 
substantive negotiations with Syria at this time, preferring to 
postpone them until after the implementation of the agreement 
with the Palestinians. Rabin is probably worried about the 
situation in Lebanon. His close circles speak of a possible 
conflagration in the north, in which Syria may be involved even 
in fighting on Lebanese territory. Some members of the top 
political echelons believe that without a limited military clash 
between Syria and Israel that is followed by massive American 
involvement, the sides will find it difficult to agree to 
dramatically advance the peace process by significantly ceding 
some of their present opening stands. 
  The katyusha which fell in western Galilee and all the 
ensuing media coverage, including the delay in the release of 
the fact itself, heralds the beginning of an attempt to gauge 
the tolerance of the sides to the conflict. The katyusha rocket 
had been fired from beyond the security zone, and it does not 
matter, therefore, whether it was launched by a Palestinian 
member of Hizballah affiliated with one of the rejectionist 
organizations, or any one of the other regional elements: After 
all, they are all sponsored by Syria. And Syria has proven 
before that its determination can prevent terrorist attacks as 
soon as it is displayed. That was the case in the weeks before 
the Clinton-al-Asad summit, and that was the case as long as the 
Syrians indirectly agreed to honor the understandings regarding 
Lebanon achieved in the wake of Operation Accountability. 
  The status of Jerusalem, which is likely to be discussed in 
the coming months, the preoccupation with the implementation of 
the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians, and the situation in 
Lebanon all take Rabin back to his term as prime minister in the 
1970's. At that time, post-Yom Kippur War interim arrangements 
were on the agenda. Those negotiations were also leisurely, 
with ups and downs. And just as now, only American pressure 
brought the agreement to fruition. 
  The prime minister is on the verge of critical decisions, 
but 
he may very well be unwilling to make them. That is probably 
the reason for his almost excessive insistence on security 
issues; he does not want to go down in history as the man who 
gave up Israel's security values. Furthermore, Rabin seems to 
be vacillating whether to take responsibility for an agreement 
that will lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state and a 
total withdrawal from the Golan Heights, and he prefers at this 
stage to deal only with interim arrangements that will leave 
Israel in control of security and avert the need for a physical 
withdrawal from the Jordanian border. Gaza, in his opinion, 
could have been given up years ago. Similarly, his stand on the 
matter of the security arrangements on the Syrian border is that 
land concessions will necessarily involve a recognition of 
Syrian sovereignty in the Golan Heights. 
  Rabin does not seem interested in reaching permanent 
arrangements at this stage, and his stands sharply contrast with 
those of Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and his aides. 
  These prime ministerial vacillations make one muse about his 
political future. Is it possible that Rabin will end this term 
in office and not run for prime minister in 1996? Is it 
reasonable to assume that he prefers to leave well-secured 
Israel to his successor and not to commit himself to permanent 
arrangements? And perhaps the prime minister has also realized 
that soon he will have to discuss the issues of Jerusalem, the 
Palestinian state, and the Golan withdrawal, all of which will 
force him to agree to a geopolitical reality he repudiates. 
These are the reasons for his insistence -- justified, from his 
vantage point -- on interim arrangements that can stand on their 
own feet without a link with the permanent arrangements. 
  In any event, these impressions are prevalent among members 
of a limited group of Israel's top political-defense echelons 
with whom Rabin converses as equals.

  [Excerpts] Russia has been trying to persuade the Arab 
countries to evince flexibility and moderation in the peace 
process with Israel. Political sources in Russia believe the 
message President Boris Yeltsin sent last month to Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad prior to his summit with the U.S. 
President in Geneva contributed to the moderation displayed by 
the Syrian president. 
  Officials in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told an 
Israeli Foreign Ministry delegation, which was in Moscow last 
week to hold political talks, that they share the assessment 
that the progress made in the Middle East peace process was 
irreversible but hard to accelerate. 
  The Russians believe there has been a positive change in 
al-Asad's positions, which was reflected in his statements in 
Geneva, but would not say whether they thought al-Asad would 
agree to a full normalization in relations with Israel in the 
context of a peace settlement. Neither would they reveal the 
contents of Yeltsin's message to al-Asad. [passage omitted] 
  The Israelis were impressed that the Middle East is 
important 
to Russia because of its proximity to its borders and the threat 
of instability there. The Russians stressed their role as 
cosponsors of the peace process alongside the Americans, and 
came out in favor of upholding the format of the Madrid process. 
  The Russians are worried by Muslim fundamentalism and fear 
it 
might spread to the Central Asian republics and Muslim regions 
in Russia. They agreed with the Israeli assessment that this 
fundamentalism can hardly be curbed if the economic and social 
situation in the Muslim countries does not improve. 
  The Israelis voiced their concern about the sale of Russian 
arms to the Middle East. The Russians said the Arab countries 
still owe them large sums of money for weapons supplied in the 
past. 
  The bilateral agreements on cultural and economic 
cooperation 
whose signing has been held up for about a year were discussed 
in the talks. The Russians are opposed to the Israeli demand to 
note in the agreement that the joint committees will meet 
alternately in Moscow and in Jerusalem, and argue that in their 
capacity as cosponsors of the peace process they cannot sign an 
agreement that recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
The Israeli officials believe a formula will soon be found to 
settle the argument and proceed to sign the agreements. 
  In a meeting with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres last 
weekend, Aleksandr Bovin, Russia's ambassador in Israel, noted 
the need to accelerate the signing of the bilateral agreements. 
  The Foreign Ministry delegation went to Russia to exchange 
views and assessments about the situation in the Middle East and 
the CIS, in keeping with the cooperation agreement the two 
ministries signed about a year ago. The Israeli delegation 
consisted of Yo'el Sher, assistant director general in charge of 
the Eastern Europe Department; Yo'av Biran, assistant director 
general in charge of peace affairs; Uri Bar-Ner, assistant 
director general in charge of the Cultural and Scientific 
Department; Meron Gordon, director of the Eastern Europe 1 
Division; and representatives of the Center for Political 
Research and the Political Planning Department. The political 
meetings were also attended by Hayim Bar-Lev, Israel's 
ambassador in Moscow, Councillor Alex Ben-Tzvi, and other 
embassy staffers. 
  The Israelis conferred with two deputies of the Russian 
foreign minister, officials in the Middle East Department of the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; with Yegor Gaydar, a former 
deputy prime minister and the current leader of the Reformist 
Party; and with Yegor Lukin, chairman of the Russian 
Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. The delegation also 
toured academic research institutes dealing with the Middle East. 
  The Israeli Foreign Ministry gave a positive grade to the 
visit, which reflected the openness and normalizations in 
relations with Russia.

  [Text] The Private Bill -- The proposal which was approved 
at its first hearing yesterday before the Knesset is composed of 
three private members' bills: 1) The proposal prepared by Likud 
Knesset Member [MK] Dan Tikhon, which is an exact copy of the 
government's previous proposal known as the [former Health 
Minister Hayim] "Ramon Bill"; 2) The proposal prepared by Labor 
MK Yoram Lass, which includes the amendments made with respect 
to the linkage and collection of medical insurance dues, as 
agreed upon at the Labor party convention; 3) The proposal made 
by MK Hayim Oron and MK Ran Kohen, both from the Meretz party, 
which permits a unilateral linkage between a labor union and 
Kupat Holim [nation wide sick fund and health care system] (the 
Histadrut trade union could obligate its members to be insured 
at Kupat Holim, but could not force people insured in the sick 
fund to become members of the Histadrut), contrasts with the 
position adopted at the Labor party convention which permits 
bilateral linkage. The system for collecting health tax in this 
proposal follows the "Bayga [nickname for Finance Minister 
Avraham Shohat] compromise," according to which the National 
Insurance Institute will be in charge of tax collection, but 
Kupat Holim will be able to collect a "welfare" tax from its 
members, which will stand at 0.8 percent of the insured person's 
earnings. 
  Following the Labor party decisions, the two alternative 
bills were brought before the joint health committee and Labor 
MK 'Amir Peretz decided to renew the legislative process. Labor 
MK Yoram Lass' proposal was attached to the two other bills. 
Peretz refused to coordinate legislation with the government, 
despite knowing that it too was about to reinitiate the process, 
and although he was asked to withhold his bill. 
  Peretz claimed that the government was not entitled to 
impose 
its will on the Knesset and invited government representatives 
to sit in on the committee's legislative proceedings, which, as 
earlier mentioned, had noted down the Labor party's position. 
The committee went on to consolidate the three proposals into 
one bill, which stipulated three options in clauses 4 and 16, 
pertaining, as mentioned above, to the issues of linkage and 
collection. 
  The Government's Bill -- this is the earlier bill (the 
"Ramon 
bill," with amendments to the clauses on linkage and collection, 
as decided upon by the Labor party. Last month, the government 
pulled back the bill after it was brought before the Knesset for 
its second and third hearings, while promising to resubmit it to 
the Knesset plenum after the Labor party convention reached a 
decision on the controversial clauses. Last week, the 
government, with the objection of the Meretz ministers, adopted 
the revised version of the bill, and is going to bring it before 
the Knesset next week in order to ask for the Knesset's approval 
to resubmit it to the health committee, in order "to operate" on 
the two above mentioned clauses. 
  [Minister] Shahal's "trick" -- Moshe Shahal, the minister 
liaising between the government and the Knesset, claimed that he 
had found a way to neutralize the private bills and restore the 
government's bill, which had been pulled back last month, to its 
progressive stage in the legislative process (second and third 
hearings before the Knesset plenum). According to the plan, 
Shahal was supposed to announce to the Knesset that according to 
clause 133 in the Knesset regulations, the government wished to 
resubmit the bill for a second and third hearing, and after this 
request was approved, to ask, according to clause 127 in the 
Knesset regulations, to withdraw the bill so that it could be 
amended by the health committee. Al these announcements must be 
voted on and approved by the Knesset plenum. 
  That is why Shahal informed the Knesset last week that he 
had placed the government's bill before the Knesset. Shahal 
believed that using the regulations would enable him to remove 
the private members' bills from the agenda, because when dealing 
with the same issue, a bill submitted by the government has 
priority. However, the government's legal adviser to the Knesset 
ruled that this rule applies only when the government's bill is 
submitted before the private one. Therefore, there was no 
obstacle to presenting the private bill for its first hearing. 
  Moreover, Shahal and the leaders of the Labor party were 
unsuccessful in mustering a Knesset majority to support clause 
127. Their fear was that if the plenum approved the request to 
return the bill for its second hearing (clause 133), but turn 
down the request to return the bill to the committee for 
amendments (clause 127), the Knesset could simply continue with 
the second and third hearings, and, in the absence of a 
majority, it may approve the law in its original form without 
the health committee's amendments. That is why Shahal refrained 
from submitting his proposal until Prime Minister Rabin returns 
from abroad. Rabin is supposed to use his influence on SHAS 
[Torah Observing Sephardim] and Meretz in order to canvass a 
majority for clause 127. Only after the bill is brought before 
the committee will efforts start to guarantee a majority for the 
government's position on the actual contents of the bill. 
  This effort seems impossible today, and senior Labor party 
officials are taking into account the possibility of being 
forced to accept the "Bayga compromise." 
  "The Bayga compromise" -- This stipulates, as does the Labor 
party proposal, a bilateral linkage between the Histadrut and 
Kupat Holim; however, like the "Ramon" proposal it stipulates 
that the collection will be carried out through the National 
Insurance Institute. Each Kupat Holim organization will 
nevertheless be permitted to collect an employee welfare tax 
which will total 0.8 percent of the employee's income and to 
transfer this tax to the Kupat Holim management. 
  The compromise prepared by Finance Minister Avraham Shohat 
on 
the eve of the Labor party convention was rejected by the 
Histadrut.

  [Excerpt] Hebron, Occupied West Bank, Feb 25 (AFP)--The 
Imam who led the prayers at the Hebron mosque on Friday [25 
February] described the scene as a "veritable bloodbath" as one 
or more Jewish settlers opened fire on the packed ranks of 
praying Muslims, killing more than 50 of them. 
  "At five-thirty, people began arriving to pray," Imam 
Ibrahim 
'Abidin told AFP. 
  "There were a lot of soldiers around and Palestinian 
identities were checked," at the entrance to the Tomb of the 
Patriarchs which both Jews and Muslims hold holy as the burial 
place of Abraham, his sons and wives. 
  "During the first part of the prayer, suddenly shots were 
fired. 
  "It can only be a planned operation because there were a lot 
of settlers around the mosque," the imam said. 
  "The shots came from several directions. It was a veritable 
bloodbath." 
  Fifty-three Palestinians died and dozens more were wounded. 
  'Abidin accused the soldiers of being very slow to react and 
then of delaying the arrival of ambulances. 
  "Most people were hit in the head and chest," he added.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman </F>
Yasir 'Arafat, identified by nom de guerre Abu-'Ammar, in Tunis 
by unidentified Radio Monte Carlo correspondent in radio studio 
on 25 February -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] President 'Arafat, good morning. 
  ['Arafat] Good morning, brother. 
  [Reporter] President 'Arafat, what is your comment on the 
massacre? 
  ['Arafat] I regret that this massacre has taken place. First 
of all, I do not absolve the Israeli Army of this 
responsibility, because everyone knows that the Israeli Army 
protects the entrances of the Ibrahimi Mosque and the area 
surrounding it. How, then, has it allowed armed settlers to 
enter the mosque while worshipers were performing dawn prayers? 
Therefore, there is some form of collusion. This has serious 
implications and meanings. Everyone must know that our people's 
blood is not spilt without a price, and that our people's blood 
is precious. To open fire on worshipers while they are 
performing dawn prayers at the Ibrahimi Mosque is an incident 
over which I cannot but call on the world at large, the 
cosponsors of the conference, the UN Security Council permament 
members and the other UN Security Council members, the EC, the 
Nonaligned countries, and the Arab and Islamic countries to 
shoulder their responsibility. I specifically call on the 
cosponsors of the conference which signed the peace agreement 
with us. What peace are they speaking about while crimes 
against our people continue and while fire is opened on our 
worshipers, children, and women? What peace are they speaking 
about? 
  [Reporter] President 'Arafat, what steps does the PLO intend 
to take in the occupied territories in wake of the massacre. 
What do you have to say to the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories? 
  ['Arafat] All morning, I have been contacting officials in 
many friendly countries to apprise them of the situation. Even 
in America, I contacted them, through some brothers, to inform 
them so they may assume their responsibilities, including the 
cosponsors of the conference. At the same time, we asked our 
representative at the United Nations to call for an urgent UN 
Security Council session so it can take appropriate measures to 
protect our people, children, women, worshipers, mosques, and 
holy places which are being violated day and night. 
  [Reporter] President 'Arafat, what impact will this have on 
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations? 
  ['Arafat] It will have very serious dimensions not only on 
the negotiations, but on all levels and in all directions. 
  [Reporter] One last question, President 'Arafat. U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced at the U.S. 
House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday 
that the United States has to continue its confrontation of the 
enemies of the peace process. Christopher said that you, that 
President Yasir 'Arafat is not an enemy of peace, and that he is 
cooperating with Israel to end violence, as he said. What do 
you have to say to the U.S. secretary of state's statement? 
  ['Arafat] Well, I would like now to see what stand he will 
adopt on these armed settlers. From where have they received 
weapons, and how are they permitted to carry arms while our 
people are not permitted to do the same? How can he allow the 
collusion that took place between the settlers and the Israeli 
Army? I would like to ask him too about the U.S. stand, given 
that the United States is one of the sponsors of the conference, 
and a signatory of the peace agreement, an agreement we signed 
at the White House under the auspices of President Clinton? 
  [Reporter] President 'Arafat, a thousand thanks. 
  ['Arafat] What about the stand of the entire world, not only 
the cosponsors of the conference? What is the stand of the 
European countries, the Nonaligned countries, the Islamic 
countries, and the Arab countries? This is a crime which cannot 
be treated lightly. 
  [Reporter] President 'Arafat, thank you. We will contact 
you later during our next newscasts. Many thanks. 
  ['Arafat] Thank you.

  [Text] Tunis, 25 Feb (MENA) -- Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has called for an urgent meeting of the Palestinian 
leadership to adopt a decisive stance toward Israel following 
the hideous massacre by Israeli settlers of Palestinian 
worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, which left 38 
people dead and hundreds wounded. 
  During the meeting, to be held later today, the Palestinian 
leadership is expected to define the PLO stance on continuing 
the peace negotiations on every level, in light of the Israeli 
terrorist actions against the Palestinian people, which are the 
result of Israel's continuing intransigence and failure to 
implement the Declaration of Principles Agreement and withdraw 
from Gaza and Jericho. 
  President 'Arafat telephoned Nasir al-Qidrah, the chief 
Palestinian observer at the United Nations, and asked him to 
submit an urgent memorandum to the UN Security Council on the 
hideous massacre, which contravenes every international 
agreement and custom, and to call for an emergency Security 
Council meeting to discuss it.

  [Text] Tunis, 25 Feb (MENA)--Faruq Qaddumi, the head of the 
PLO Political Department, has condemned the Israeli massacre 
today in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  He said the world today is witnessing a new cycle in a 
series 
of Israeli crimes inside the occupied territories at a time when 
Rabin is taking no action. Instead, he encourages such 
massacres by not punishing the perpetrators. 
  In a statement today, Qaddumi said that Rabin uses the 
pretext of protecting Israeli security to postpone the date of 
the withdrawal of his military forces from the occupied 
Palestinian territories. He allows no international force to 
enter the occupied territories to end the abuse by the Israeli 
settlers, which threatens the chances of peace and security in 
the region and prolongs the struggle. 
  He noted that Yitzhaq Rabin, who insists on Israeli 
security, 
talks cold-bloodedly about these fierce and heinous massacres.

  [Excerpts] At dawn today, there was a massacre in the 
occupied West Bank city of Hebron. The Israeli version says 
that an Israeli settler opened fire on a group of worshipers at 
the Tomb of the Prophet Abraham, killing 13 and wounding many 
others. [passage omitted] 
  The PLO gives a different casualty toll for the massacre. 
PLO Information Head Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh has told our radio that 
more than one settler carried out the attack. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin 'Abd-Rabbuh recording] The crime that took place at 
dawn today, and which was carried out by groups of settlers 
against the sons of the Palestinian people and the worshipers in 
the blessed Ibrahimi Mosque, martyred more than 30 Palestinians 
and wounded 150 others. The crime took place under the eyes, 
ears, and supervision of the Israeli occupation army. 
  The Rabin government and the occupation army are completely 
responsible for this crime. No peace can be achieved on 
Palestinian land as long as a single settler remains on it. 
These are criminal gangs, and they are one of the tools of 
occupation, and they must leave Palestinian land with the end of 
the occupation. 
  The PLO views this crime as a very grave turning point. 
Complete protection for our people should be guaranteed. Such 
protection can never be provided by this occupation, and by the 
army of occupation -- one of the tools of killings as we have 
seen over the past two days in Abu-Dis and al-Ram. Therefore, 
to have an international presence to guarantee protection for 
our people is inevitable. The command will adopt several 
measures in the next few hours to ensure real security in light 
of these crimes and the serious threats our people 
experience.[end recording]

  [Text] Israeli settlers have committed a massacre in 
Hebron, in the occupied territories, by firing at Palestinian 
worshippers inside a mosque. While the final casualty toll is 
still unknown, Palestinian sources reported a short while ago 
that 31 people were killed. PLO Executive Committee member 
Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh said about 130 people were killed or wounded. 
Monte Carlo radio correspondent in the occupied territories 
reported that according to an initial count, 26 people were 
killed and more than 70 wounded. An Israeli Army spokesman said 
that only 10 Palestinians were killed when an Israeli settler 
opened fire at the worshipers inside the mosque. 
  Commenting on the massacre a short while ago, PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat said: 
  [Begin recording] I do not absolve the Israeli Army from 
responsibility, because it is known that the Israeli Army posts 
guards at and around the entrances to the Ibrahimi Mosque. How 
did it allow armed settlers to enter the mosque while people 
were performing the dawn prayers? There is some sort of 
collusion. This has serious implications. 
  Everyone must realize that the blood of our people is not 
without its price. The blood of our people is precious. These 
faithful worshippers were fired on while they were performing 
the dawn prayer at the Ibrahimi Mosque. I cannot but call on 
the entire world--the cosponsors of the [Madrid] conference, the 
permanent members and all other members of the UN Security 
Council, the EC, the nonaligned states, the Arab states, and the 
Islamic states--to shoulder their responsibility. I call in 
particular on the cosponsors of the conference, who signed the 
peace agreement with us. What kind of a peace is this they are 
talking about when crimes have not ceased against our people and 
the killing is continuing. [end recording] 
  Commenting on the massacre also, PLO Executive Committee 
member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh said: 
  [Begin recording] The Rabin government and the occupation 
army shoulder full responsibility for this crime. No peace can 
be achieved in the Palestinian territory as long as one settler 
remains on this land. These are criminal gangs and one of the 
tools of occupation. They must leave the Palestinian territory, 
with the occupation. The PLO regards this big crime as a very 
serious turning point. Complete protection for our people must 
be ensured, and this protection cannot be provided by the 
occupation forces. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad al-Tibi, political adviser </F>
to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, by Hayim Zissowitz -- live] 
  [Text] [Zissowitz] You heard about the Hebron incident and 
discussed it with Yasir 'Arafat. 
  [Al-Tibi] Yes, he talked with me this morning. 
  [Zissowitz] He called you for details? 
  [Al-Tibi] In fact, he had more details than I. From what I 
know at this stage, between 20 and 25 people were killed. The 
16 Dr. Tamimi talked about were those admitted to his hospital. 
Others were taken to different hospitals, and dozens were 
wounded, many more than Dr. Tamimi mentioned. A massacre 
occurred in the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
  [Zissowitz] From what you know, was one man responsible for 
the whole incident? 
  [Al-Tibi] According to what some of the worshipers say, it 
is still not certain if only one settler was responsible. From 
what is known, a settler entered the Cave of the Patriarchs and 
indiscriminately massacred people. He was apparently hit by a 
fire extinguisher, which was hurled at him in order to stop the 
shooting. There was also firing at different sites in Hebron 
near the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
  [Zissowitz] Are you saying that the same person went on a 
rampage, firing as he went along, or that when he fired in the 
cave others were shooting outside? 
  [Al-Tibi] I do not have definite information at this stage, 
and I want to be precise. I am not certain that one person was 
responsible for all the fatalities. At this stage, there are at 
least 20 to 25 fatalities and the number of casualties has 
reached more than 80. 
  [Zissowitz] Do you know to which hospitals they were taken? 
  [Al-Tibi] Yes, they were taken to Hebron hospital, 
al-Maqasid, and other hospitals. We view the rampage by Jewish 
settlers with great gravity. We think a stop should be put to 
them immediately and the law imposed on them once and for all. 
A curfew must be imposed on Qiryat Arba' and not the area where 
the massacre occurred, which is Hebron. Once and for all the 
Jewish population must be told that they cannot continuing going 
on rampages and massacring innocent people. Violence by either 
side -- but now I am speaking with pain about massacred 
Palestinians -- can definitely endanger the atmosphere of 
conciliation we are working so hard to bring about for both 
peoples. The Israeli Government and Army have to use all legal 
measures to bring order among the settlers who shoot freely in 
order to massacre peaceful Palestinians during their Ramadan 
morning prayers. 
  [Zissowitz] Did 'Arafat call on you to make those remarks or 
to pass on some message to the prime minister? 
  [Al-Tibi] I do not want to say what contacts I had this 
morning. I have said what I can at this stage.

<F P=106> [Report by Eldad Beck] </F>
  [Text] Bassam Abu-Sharif, one of Yasir 'Arafat's advisers, 
has placed the blame for the Hebron massacre on the Israeli 
Government. He says that this morning's incidents reinforce the 
PLO's demand for international supervision to guarantee the 
safety and well-being of the Palestinian residents of the 
territories. Abu-Sharif was asked to comment on the Israeli 
argument that the massacre was committed by a mentally ill 
person. The following is his reaction. 
  [Begin Abu-Sharif recording, in English] Well, we have seen 
such statements before. When the intifadah began, an Israeli 
soldier stopped a bus with 60 Palestinian workers on it and 
machine-gunned them. That is an old story. Actually, the 
Israeli Government is responsible, whether this man is 
unbalanced or balanced. I think he is balanced. He is an 
extremist, and the more the Israelis maneuver around and linger 
in implementing the agreement that was signed in Washington, the 
more ground they give to their extremists. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interviews with Palestinian leaders Faysal </F>
al-Husayni and Ziyad Abu-Zayyad by Hayim Zissowitz; place not 
given -- live] 
  [Text] [Zissowitz] I assume that you have been updated on 
what happened in Hebron. I have received reports from people in 
Hebron. 
  [Al-Husayni] Yes. 
  [Zissowitz] From the information you have, how many have 
been murdered, and how many wounded in the shooting spree. 
  [Al-Husayni] About 35 people were murdered. There are 18 
dead in al-Ahali Hospital, 11 in 'Aliya Hospital, and four in 
al-Maqasid, and we are being updated by the minute. 
  [Zissowitz] Have the Palestinian negotiators in the peace 
talks worked out any response to this action? 
  [Al-Husayni] Of course, but first of all we want the 
settlers to be disarmed. Second, we want international 
protection and a committee to investigate what happened, who is 
responsible, and how the Army responded. 
  [Zissowitz] Do you doubt that the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] did all it could to defend the Arab worshipers? 
  [Al-Husayni] No, definitely not. The Army permitted a 
settler to enter a holy place with weapons and do what he did. 
It is clear that the Army did not do what it had to do. Later, 
the Army fired at people, apparently causing many casualties. I 
also have reports that the Army later killed two people. 
  [Zissowitz] I am sure you do not deny that the Army is doing 
everything it can to defend the lives of Jews, yet it does not 
always succeed, and Arab terrorists succeed in harming and 
killing Jews. 
  [Al-Husayni] It has never happened in a place under such 
heavy Army protection. It has to defend such a holy place yet 
it permits settlers to enter armed. What we want is for all 
settlers be immediately disarmed. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0750 GMT on 25 February 
carries a similar interview with al-Husayni by Itay Engel, in 
which al-Husayni is asked whether he joins the call to 
Palestinians not to carry out reprisals for the Hebron incident. 
Al-Husayni replies: "Today, I call on the people not to make 
reprisals, but at the same time, I can not ask people not to 
defend themselves."] 
  [Zissowitz] Did you have any contact after this morning's 
events with the prime minister or foreign minister? 
  [Al-Husayni] I did not speak with the prime minister or the 
foreign minister. I tried but failed, but I talked with others 
in the government. 
  [Zissowitz] What did they tell you? 
  [Al-Husayni] I want to transfer the conversation to Mr. 
Ziyad Abu-Zayyad. 
  [Zissowitz] I asked Mr. al-Husayni whether you had any 
contact with Israel's top political echelon, the prime minister, 
foreign minister, or those participating in the talks? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] We are in touch with cabinet ministers, whom I 
do not want to name, Knesset members, officials in the Civil 
Administration, and the coordinator of government activities in 
the territories. We demanded information and an investigation, 
and we are following events with deep concern. 
  [Zissowitz] Do you think these events will influence the 
talks with Israel in any way? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] Personally, I hope not although it is a crime 
and a great tragedy. I hope it will not harm the process 
because the peace talks are a strategic aim for both the 
Israelis and the Palestinians. We must not allow an incident, 
no matter how painful and dastardly, to stop the talks. 
  [Zissowitz] When you hear a unanimous denunciation by the 
left and right, does this convince you of its sincerity? 
  [Abu-Zayyad] I have always said that there is no 
denunciation that can bring a dead man back to life. Therefore 
it does not help. What can help is to immediately remove the 
arms from the settlers and to ban them from carrying arms, for 
the Army to be in control of the situation. It is responsible 
for the safety of the Jewish and Palestinian populations. 
  [Zissowitz] There were denunciations not only by people 
supporting the peace process, but a unanimous denunciation among 
those fervently opposed to the process, which is unusual. 
  [Abu-Zayyad] I am not looking for lip service from anybody 
and the words do not always reflect what the heart feels and 
desires, therefore I cannot depend on words.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, adviser to PLO Executive </F>
Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on Israeli Affairs, by Qol 
Yisra'el correspondent Ziyad Halabi; place not given -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Halabi] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, PLO Executive Committee 
chairman's adviser, you spoke with Yasir 'Arafat on the phone 
this morning about the mass killings in Hebron. Was Yasir 
'Arafat aware of the details, and what is the PLO's official 
reaction? 
  [Al-Tibi] Brother President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] 
briefed me on the details this morning. He is in contact with 
the relatives of the victims in Hebron, and he has been informed 
about the details and the massacre that took place at Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron. After the telephone call, I spoke with 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. We are watching the 
situation, and visiting our wounded in the hospitals. This is 
an odious and vile crime carried out by a settler, whom they say 
is a doctor from Qiryat Arba'. We cannot accept the story that 
he is a psychopath, as some try to portray him to us. 
  [Halabi] Dr. al-Tibi, in your opinion what is the solution? 
  [Al-Tibi] The solution is to immediately disarm these 
settlers. If the Israeli Army and police, who supposedly are 
responsible for security, cannot provide security to the citizen 
who carries out his daily activities and prayers, then the 
United Nations can do this. The solution is to expedite the 
withdrawal of the Israeli Army. The solution is to disarm the 
settlers. The solution lies in international protection, 
because it has been proven that the Israeli Army cannot protect 
defenseless Palestinians. Some of the Palestinians who were 
martyred today were martyred by the bullets of the Israeli Army. 
This is the climax. It does not suffice that a settler opens 
fire in an indiscriminate manner, resulting in a massacre in the 
Ibrahimi Mosque, but the Armed forces too, instead of protecting 
the Palestinians, opened fire and killed at least four 
Palestinians. What is needed is international protection for the 
defenseless Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories. 
  [Halabi] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, has PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat 
told you to convey any message to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin 
and the Israeli Government in this respect? 
  [Al-Tibi] As I told you, I spoke with whom I should speak at 
the highest level within the Israeli Government. They know the 
PLO's stand and demands, not to mention that President 'Arafat 
has called for the need to have international protection. There 
could be a need to convene the UN Security Council. 
  [Halabi] Dr. al-Tibi, in your opinion what impact will this 
painful incident have on the Palestinians in general? 
  [Al-Tibi] The Palestinians have been suffering and have 
expressed doubts during the past week. But, today, the pain is 
general, and sorrow overwhelms all the occupied Palestinian 
territories, inside and outside the Green Line. Mourning has 
been announced, as you know. The Palestinians must feel that 
there is some change. As yet, the Palestinian citizen has not 
sensed that changes have taken place on the ground. On the 
contrary, things are getting worse. We tirelessly work to 
expedite the conclusion of the peace agreement so such crimes by 
the settlers cannot take place and to end the tribulations of 
the two people, the Palestinian and Israeli people. 
  [Halabi] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, thank you. 
  [Al-Tibi] Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Feb (MENA)--Muhammad Subayh, secretary of 
the Palestine National Council [PNC], has condemned the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre and asserted that it is not the only massacre 
committed by the fanatic settlers and rightist Israeli forces 
against the Palestinians. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, he added that the 
massacre 
was carried out with the cooperation and oversight of the 
Israeli Army. This constitutes a dangerous turning point in the 
peace process. At a time when Israel has been trying through 
the negotiations to get control of the crossings, under the 
pretext of security, it leaves the occupied territories flooded 
with arms, especially in the hands of the obsessed settlers. 
This constitutes an abnormal danger for the march to peace. 
  He said Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who does not 
want to respect the dates [for implementing the agreements with 
the Palestinians], does not consider them sacred, and is in no 
hurry to implement the peace process either in letter or spirit, 
is opening up opportunities to such murderers to commit such 
ugly crimes. 
  He added that this heinous massacre affirms once again the 
importance of moving the settlements, which were established 
through aggression and against the legitimate international 
resolutions and international law. 
  He insisted that the responsibility for this massacre falls 
on the shoulders of the Israeli cabinet and its prime minister, 
Yitzhaq Rabin. They are also responsible for preventing 
repetitions of similar acts and for punishing the murderers and 
stopping them from committing further such crimes.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Israeli Knesset member </F>
'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Darawshah by Muhammad Husayn in Cairo on 25 
February; al-Darawshah's location not given; from "The World 
Around Us" program on 25 February --recorded] 
  [Text] [Husayn] What do you think about the incident in 
Hebron earlier today and its effects on the peace process? 
  [Al-Darawshah] The incident is tragic. Around 40 of our 
Palestinian sons were martyred in Hebron and adjacent areas. 
This incident, which was planned and was carried out by the 
extremist settlers, is chiefly aimed at torpedoing the peace 
process and at killing the largest number of our Palestinian 
people. This is a tragedy. The Israeli Government is 
responsible for this incident. The settlers are also 
responsible. I believe the consequences will be grave. 
  I contacted Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin twice today and 
asked him to withdraw the army from Hebron and the Palestinian 
towns and to guarantee that the settlers do not enter the 
Palestinian areas. I also asked him to disarm the settlers, the 
thugs, who attack the Palestinians. Regrettably, the killings 
are continuing. The martyrs who fell in these past few hours 
were not killed by settlers' guns but by the army forces. 
  [Husayn] What was Yitzhaq Rabin's response? 
  [Al-Darawshah] Rabin said he was studying the issue and that 
he is in constant contact with the army. He said he instructed 
the army not to shoot to kill. But this response is not 
sufficient, because, regrettably, the killings are continuing. 
A curfew has been declared in Hebron and the adjacent area. 
But this is not normal, because the Palestinian people are 
entitled to demonstrate and to express their sorrow and pain for 
the incident. That is something natural. This is what I told 
Rabin during my discussion with him. I told him the Palestinian 
people have the right to demonstrate and to voice their anger 
and extreme pain. He must withdraw the army from the towns.

  [Excerpt] The toll of this morning's massacre in the West 
Bank has already risen to 49. [passage omitted] Yasir 'Arafat 
has requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council. In 
Lisbon, PLO representative 'Isam al-Baysusu has echoed 'Arafat's 
stance and said that responsibility for the massacre must be 
apportioned in full to the Israeli state: 
  [Begin al-Baysusu recording] This is the Israeli 
Government's 
problem. Whether or not it was perpetrated by a fanatic, as far 
as we are concerned this was a crime, a massacre, and the 
responsibility lies fully at the Israeli Government's door, 
because it is the Israeli Government that sets up Israeli 
settlements on Palestinian territories. [end recording] [passage 
omitted] 
  [Lisbon RDP Antena 1 Radio Network in Portuguese in a 
similar 
report at 0900 GMT on 25 February carries the following 
recording remarks by al-Baysusu: "The peace negotiations are 
really in danger, because we agreed to postpone negotiating on 
the problem of the Israeli settlements for two years, and now 
this means that we must discuss the problem of the settlements 
immediately. They must all leave Palestine."]

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Feb (MENA) -- Zuhdi al-Qidrah, the Fatah 
representative in Cairo, has condemned the shooting early this 
morning of Palestinians praying at Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron 
City in the occupied West Bank. He considers this shooting 
incident a violation of the spirit of peace that we are working 
to realize in the region. 
  In a statement to MENA today, the Palestinian official asked 
the Israeli Government to stop these acts the Israeli settlers 
are committing. 
  He affirmed that these acts compel the international 
community to shoulder its responsibility in the march to peace 
by providing the Palestinian people inside the occupied 
territories with international protection until Israel withdraws 
from the Palestinian territories.

  [Text] In a statement to Al-Quds radio following the odious 
Zionist crime, Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General command [PFLP-GC], 
has said the following: We are not surprised that the Zionists 
committed such a massacre in the blessed Ibrahimi Mosque, the 
mosque of our Lord Abraham, the father of prophets and 
messengers. The Zionists' history is replete with terrorism and 
massacres against our people and nation, and against mankind. 
Had they not already committed the massacre at Al-Aqsa, and 
before that others in Sabra and Shatila and in Dayr Yasin, 
Qibyah and Nahalin, and Kafr Qasim? Have they not committed 
massacres against the people in southern Lebanon and the Golan? 
  Ahmad Jibril added: These Jews have been marked by God 
Almighty in the Koran as the killers of prophets and messengers, 
and as those who violate the pledges they make although God has 
given them many opportunties to repent. They insist, however, 
on continuing their actions, which shows complete disobedience 
to God, his teachings, and to mankind. 
  In his statement to Al-Quds radio, Ahmad Jibril added: As I 
said, we are not surprised at the perpetration of such a 
massacre in one of God's houses. What surprises us, however, is 
that Yasir 'Arafat and a handful of mercenaries continue to 
shake hands with the killers in Oslo, Washington, and Cairo. We 
are surprised that they continue to offer concessions and to 
give in completely to the Zionist will. We are also surprised 
at some Arab leaders who act out the role of cheap brokers for 
the sake of the Zionist movement. We are surprised at the 
behavior of some Arab rulers who started to open their countries 
to the Zionist movement and to the Jews while the Zionists still 
occupy all of Palestine, the Golan Heights, and southern Lebanon. 
  Ahmad Jibril said: We are certain that the people's will, 
our Arab people, and nation will punish all those who relinquish 
the holy places, the land, and history. Our Palestinian people 
in and outside [the occupied territories] will not forgive these 
massacres that are being committed against them, massacres which 
will remain vivid in our minds, and in the minds of our 
children, and grandchildren. Our revenge will be devastating, 
God willing. We are the nation of martyrs and martyrdom, and we 
do not fear death. This odious massacre will further enhance 
the cohesion and determination of our people and nation and 
their faith in the inevitability of victory. In conclusion, we 
offer condolences to our Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories and to the martyrs families and we tell them that 
tomorrow is close for those who are waiting.

  [Text] Tunis, 25 Feb (MENA) -- PLO Executive Committee 
member Samir Ghawshah has declared that the PLO holds the 
Israeli Government under Yitzhaq Rabin's leadership responsible 
for the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn today. He 
accused it of failing to put an end to the violence, killings, 
and highway assaults that the settlers have been perpetrating 
for the past several months. 
  In a statement to MENA's Tunis correspondent, Ghawshah said 
the Palestinian leaders will hold an urgent meeting later today 
to discuss the massacre and adopt appropriate decisions in light 
of the reactions that will proceed from the international 
community and the UN Security Council, particularly the United 
States and Russia in their capacity as the sponsors of the 
Middle East peace process. 
  Ghawshah added: We will discuss the situation and adopt a 
firm stand, not only with regard to the negotiations but also on 
how to confront these dangers and prevent their recurrence. 
  He stressed that this massacre is directed at the peace 
operation and at the negotiations, which the perpetrators want 
to undermine. 
  Ghawshah urged Rabin's government to arrest the culprits and 
punish them, promptly implement the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles, and withdraw the Israeli forces from 
Gaza and Jericho. He assured that when the PLO assumes 
responsibility and authority in these areas, these assaults will 
stop. 
  He called on the world community to help end these acts and 
urged Washington and Moscow--the sponsors of the peace 
process--to make Israel fulfill its obligations and play its 
role in giving impetus to the peace process. 
  He said: While we condemn this massacre against our 
Palestinian people at the hands of Israeli settlers, we 
emphasize the need for all patriotic Palestinian forces to unite 
and confront these brutal actions that seek to undermine the 
peace process.

  [Text] Two Palestinian leaders condemned this morning's 
Zionist crime, during an interview with the Central News Unit in 
Beirut. They called on the international community to take 
serious action over the Zionist regime's continuous creation of 
catastrophes. In this connection, and in a telephone interview 
with us, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] spokesman Ibrahim 
Ghawshah said: 
  [Begin Ghawshah recording, in Arabic with superimposed 
Persian translation] Such a crime reflects the true criminal 
nature of Rabin and the Zionist regime. The Palestinian 
community will continue to walk on the path of martyrdom and 
struggle until the full liberation of the occupied territories. 
[end recording] 
  Ahmad Jibril, general secretary of Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine -- General Command [PFLP-GC], also spoke 
to us in an interview. He emphasized: The ugly crime at the 
mosque of his holiness Abraham, peace be upon him, today in the 
holy month of Ramadan reflects the height of savageness and 
terrorism by the Zionist regime and adds a bleak page to their 
ugly record alongside the Sabra-Shatila [massacre in September 
1982]. He continued: We know the true nature of Zionism, and on 
this bleak day we say: Has not the time come for the Islamic 
and Arab world to stand up to rescue the Palestinian people and 
support them in their struggle against the Zionists and America?

<F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam in Damascus] </F>
  [Text] Abu-'Ali Mustafa, assistant secretary general of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], has stated 
that the massacre settlers committed today in Hebron's Ibrahimi 
Mosque is one of the fruits of the so-called peace. He told 
Radio Monte Carlo that a crime of such a nature cannot take 
place without the knowledge of the Israeli Army and the Israeli 
security organs which directly encourage the settlers and cover 
up their fascist actions against the Palestinians. 
  Abu-'Ali Mustafa said this massacre is further proof that 
the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement legalizes settlement, protects the 
settlers, and perpetuates the occupation. He said the PLO 
leadership's official stand, which overlooks the issue of ending 
settlement, is responsible for the settlers' crimes against the 
Palestinian people. 
  The PFLP assistant secretary general called on the United 
Nations and the human rights bodies to act immediately to 
protect the Palestinian people under occupation. 
  Meanwhile, Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, director of the Hamas 
office 
in Damascus, has said this massacre is a message -- signed in 
blood -- and one which confirms that peace with those terrorists 
is an illusion. He stressed that the terrorists, with the help 
of the Israeli soldiers who claim to protect the Ibrahimi 
Mosque, who attack in their mosques those who fast, have given a 
slap in the face to the defeatists in Tunis who daily negotiate 
and offer concessions. 
  The director of the Hamas office in Damascus emphasized that 
this crime will not go unpunished, and that the 'Izz al-Din 
al-Qassam Battalions will avenge this massacre as they avenged 
al-Aqsah massacre.

  [Text] Amman, Feb 25 (AFP)--The hardline fundamentalist 
group Hamas vowed on Friday [25 February] to attack Israeli 
soldiers, settlers and other Jewish targets in revenge for the 
massacre of more than 50 Palestinians at a mosque in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement put all its militants "on a 
maximum state of alert" and called on them "to retaliate as hard 
as possible to avenge the slaughter in Hebron." 
  In a statement to AFP here, Hamas said that "emergency 
military plans were put in place to strike at Zionist targets, 
occupation soldiers and settlers." 
  It also declared that the massacre had dealt a "fatal blow" 
to the peace process. 
  Hamas has been at the forefront of attacks on Jews in the 
occupied territories since the PLO signed its peace deal with 
Israel in Washington in September.

  [Text] In an initial reaction, the joint command of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has 
strongly condemned today's ugly crime at Ibrahimi Mosque in 
which many defenseless Palestinian citizens were killed by the 
armed gangs of settlers under the very eyes and ears of the 
occupation forces. 
  In the name of the Red Star and Red Eagle Battalions and on 
behalf of the militant nationalist forces, the joint command 
pledged to the martyrs and the Palestinian people in the 
occupied territores to take revenge on the occupation and the 
settlers. 
  The two fronts appealed to the international community to 
act 
immediately to secure peace and protection for the Palestinian 
people under occupation, and called on the PLO command to learn 
from what is taking place in the occupied territories and to 
suspend the separate negotiations and the destructive partial 
deals which have catastrophic results on the Palestinian people. 
  The two fronts hold the Israeli Army responsible for this 
crime.

  [Text] The Palestinian popular committees went on a one-day 
strike in Sidon today and declared three days of mourning. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Munir al-Maqdah, a former Fatah military 
official who opposes the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, has stated that 
Yasir 'Arafat is to blame for the Hebron massacre because he 
signed the above agreement. 
  Al-Maqdah announced: Our retaliation to this massacre will 
be very cruel. We will use all available methods. Let no one, 
inside or outside the occupied territories, blame us. 
  Al-Maqdah called on 'Arafat not just to resign, because his 
resignation is no longer useful, but to take out his pistol and 
point it at his own head.

  [Text] Beirut, Feb 25 (AFP)--A clandestine Muslim 
fundamentalist group on Friday [25 February] threatened to 
assassinate PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, accusing him of 
responsibility for the Hebron massacre in which 58 Palestinians 
were shot dead. 
  "The traitor 'Arafat will not be the only one to pay the 
price over this massacre, Jews in their synagogues will also 
pay," the Revolutionary Army for the Liberation of Palestine 
said in a statement received here by AFP. 
  The group, which is opposed to the PLO-Israeli autonomy 
accord signed last September, emerged several months ago. It 
said in an Arabic-written statement it would assume full 
responsibility for eliminating 'Arafat, adding that it had 
already judged him. 
  The Hebron massacre was the result of the "odious policies 
of 
the United States, and its allies, namely (Egyptian President) 
Husni Mubarak," the group said. 
  One or more settlers shot dead 58 Palestinians and wounded 
dozens more when they opened fire inside a mosque at the Tomb of 
the Patriarchs, which was packed for prayers during the Muslim 
fasting month of Ramadan.

  [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 25 (AFP)--The Middle East peace 
process is dying, the PLO's West Bank chief Faysal al-Husayni 
warned Friday [25 February] after one or more Jewish settlers 
killed more than 50 Palestinians praying in a mosque. 
  "It is a day of sorrow not only for the Palestinian people 
but maybe also for the peace process," said al-Husayni, who 
front's Yasir 'Arafat's mainstream PLO group Fatah. 
  "When it reaches this level this means the peace process is 
dying. 
  "If the Israelis are not going to take real steps to stop 
the 
settlers and their activities in the area I believe they are 
killing the peace process," al-Husayni said. 
  He called for the Israeli government to disarm all settlers 
and demanded that an inquiry be set up immediately "to 
investigate not only who did it, but also what was the attitude 
of the army before and after the event." 
  The Tomb of the Patriarchs where the slaughter took place in 
Hebron is under military guard. 
  "I call for the government and Rabin to take real steps and 
not only words. Words will not be enough," al-Husayni said. 
  "If the Israeli government cannot take this responsibility 
then we have to take it ourselves. 
  "They have to create an atmosphere (in which) we can tell 
our 
people there is a peace process and they can wait, or else we 
cannot ask them to restrain themselves.

  [Text] Amman, Feb 25 (AFP)--The "terrible massacre" of 
Palestinians in Hebron on Friday [25 February] has dealt a 
"fatal blow" to the peace process, Hamas spokesman Ibrahim 
Ghawshah said here. 
  The shooting, in which at least 40 Palestinians died, will 
provoke a "dramatic escalation in the intifadah and shake the 
Palestinian people and the Arab nation out of their slumber." 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas has been at the 
forefront of attacks on Jews in the occupied territories since 
the PLO signed its peace deal with Israel in Washington in 
September. 
  The spokesman said his movement had always warned that 
"coexistence is impossible with the Israeli enemy which wants 
the land without its inhabitants."

  [Text] Gaza -- In a statement distributed yesterday morning 
in the Gaza Strip, Hamas rejected Rabin's attempts, carried out 
inside prisons and through Egyptian newspapers, to hold a 
dialogue with Hamas. The statement emphasized that those 
attempts were a natural outcome of the operations conducted by 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads. In its statement, Hamas announced 
that as long as the occupation, the settlers, and their weapons, 
exist and as long as the prisoners remain in prison, Hamas and 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam will hold a dialogue with Rabin only 
through the bullet. The statement noted that Hamas will 
overcome all Israeli attempts to embarrass it, and that all the 
political maneuvers and trial balloons floated by the Israeli 
Government were doomed to failure. 
  The statement clarified the Hamas position on the agreement 
that has canceled the issues of Jerusalem and the refugees, 
negated Palestinian control, and allowed the Jews to build more 
settlements. The statement said Hamas will do all in its power 
to foil this plan by the permitted legitimate means, far from 
the violence being practiced by Rabin's government.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Brothers: As we proceed with firm steps and solid 
determination to achieve our national objectives, destroying all 
obstacles on the path of our march, we should be more alert, 
have an honest national awareness, and place Palestine -- land 
and one people -- over all considerations. The objective is to 
deprive the enemy of opportunities and to foil the seditions 
which the enemy is trying to create to undermine our national 
unity by pushing us toward despair and internecine fighting, God 
forbid. 
  O brothers: With the exacerbating political confrontation, 
the procrastination and prevarication by Israeli officials, and 
the escalating Israeli repressive acts against our steadfast 
Palestinian people in the occupied homeland, we must be fully 
aware that the enemy will not give in easily to the achievements 
accomplished by our people under the banner of their sole, 
legitimate leadership, the PLO. The enemy will lie in wait to 
attack and liquidate these achievements. 
  The Israeli enemy is endeavoring to evade all its pledges 
and 
commitments contained in the Declaration of Principles 
agreement. The evidence is its continuous attempts to [word 
indistinct] the Palestinian negotiator and to (?delay) 
withdrawal from the agreed areas and its desperate attempts to 
delay the release of Palestinian detainees from Israeli jails. 
This is in addition to its continuous procrastination in 
transferring powers to the national Palestinian authority in the 
areas from which it will withdraw under the pretext that all 
these issues need more discussion and more (?recommendations). 
  Hence, it is evident that the enemy is trying, through all 
this, to gain time and prepare the road for a new scheme which, 
this time, aims to create seditions and sow discord in front of 
the national Palestinian authority. The enemy wants to show 
that this authority is unable to tackle the situation and that 
it cannot run the affairs of the Palestinian people in the 
interim period. The objective is to entrench occupation as the 
best way to maintain security and stability in these areas. 
  As they have always proved, our people can -- through their 
awareness, steadfastness, unity, and cohesion -- make the 
designs of aggressors backfire. Those who try to encroach on 
our people's steadfastness and march toward liberation and 
independence must know full well that he who plays with fire 
will burn his fingers and that he who plants thorns will harvest 
storm.

  [Text] Israel does everything it can to conceal the name of 
Jerusalem from the march [words indistinct] under the cover of 
darkness, and when the name of the city of peace surfaces, the 
Zionists' reality is exposed by their shouts and allegations 
that Jerusalem is Israeli and will remain the permanent capital 
of the State of Israel. Despite the frank international 
resolutions and the rejection of most countries, including the 
big powers, of the legitimacy of the decision to annex issued in 
June 1980 to annex Jerusalem, Israel continues to reject any 
discussion of the fate of the city of peace. It threatens to 
obstruct the whole peace process if this issue is raised. By 
this, Israel is exercising every kind of blackmail and 
Judaization. 
  All these methods cannot change any of official documents 
and 
treaties, despite Israel's control of the land, its daily 
Judaization measures, and its continued settlement operations to 
change the face of the flower of cities. These documents stress 
something no one can ignore or hide from. No one has free 
disposal over Jerusalem or can relinquish any inch of its holy 
land. No leader, organization, or official alone can negotiate 
with the Israelis on the decided, irrevocable facts that 
Jerusalem is Arab and will remain Arab despite all intrigues and 
conspiracies. It is Islamic and contains the first of the two 
qiblas, the third of the holiest shrines, and many Islamic holy 
sites, the foremost of which are al-Aqsa Mosque, 'Umar Mosque, 
the holy Rock of the Dome, and the place from which the prophet 
ascended to the throne. It also contains Christian sanctities, 
including the Holy Sepulcher, but does not contain any Jewish 
sanctities, contrary to Zionist propaganda allegations. 
  Israel has pursued a well-studied strategy to reach its 
goals. It began by oppressing Arab residents by confiscating 
their land, arresting men, damaging the sanctities, demolishing 
houses, denying construction licenses, waging economic war, and 
imposing an unethical and inhuman siege on Arab Jerusalem to 
force its residents to leave it and hand it over to Zionist 
settlers as an easy morsel. As a result, the character of the 
old city changed. A series of settlements and brute-like 
colonies that distort the spiritual and aesthetic face of 
Jerusalem have been established. 
  The Israeli Government also insisted on separating Jerusalem 
residents from their brothers and families in the West Bank and 
Gaza. It prevented any citizen in Jerusalem from joining the 
Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. What is worse is the 
agreement the Israeli Government recently signed with the 
Vatican. This has provoked fear that this Catholic edifice may 
retreat from its resolute rejection of the annexation of 
Jerusalem and from its insistence on finding a solution ensuring 
everybody's rights, even through the internationalization of the 
whole holy city, as demanded by the former pope. 
  The Madrid peace formula suspended the issue of Jerusalem, 
in 
accordance with a U.S. demand to postpone complicated and 
difficult issues until after deciding matters and defining the 
concept of land for peace, namely, the concept of total peace 
and total withdrawal in accordance with international 
resolutions, foremost of which are Resolutions No. 242 and 338. 
Israel alleges and brags every day that Jerusalem is excepted 
from total peace and total withdrawal and that it will not sign 
any final agreement that stipulates a change of the present 
situation. Therefore, it has resorted to tricks, dividing the 
solution and demanding partial agreements with each side. 
  Despite all this, the Israelis know they have not been able 
to impose a fait accompli. Therefore, they are building more 
settlements, oppressing Jerusalem residents, and [words 
indistinct]. Some specialized gangs call for the destruction of 
al-Aqsa Mosque and building the Temple in its place. Despite 
these difficulties, Jerusalem's residents have proven their 
ability to defend the den of Arabs and Muslims and have asserted 
to the whole world that Jerusalem is Arab and will remain so 
forever. Its current ordeal is not the first. It was subjected 
to the crusaders' occupation and was liberated at the hand of 
victorious commander Salah al-Din al-'Ayyubi.

  [Text] Following today's attack by the Zionists on fasting 
worshippers in the Tomb of His Holiness Abraham -- may peace be 
upon him -- in the occupied town of Hebron, martyring tens and 
wounding hundreds of Palestinian Muslims, the spokesman of our 
country's Foreign Ministry condemned this dastardly act, and 
said that the attack is another sign that the the policy of 
oppression and massacre is still in progress in the occupied 
territories. 
  According to the Central News Unit's report, the spokesman 
referred to this as a horrific massacre that was doubtless 
carried out with the backing of the military forces of the 
Zionist regime, and he called on human rights organizations and 
world public opinion to react seriously to this horrifying 
crime. He said: Silence and indifference of the countries 
supporting the Zionist regime will encourage that regime to 
continue its policies. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed the sympathy of the 
government of the Islamic Republic of Iran with the families of 
those martyred by this horrific crime.

  [Text] Jordan has denounced the criminal act that was 
carried out by one of the settlers against innocent Muslim 
worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the occupied city of Hebron 
at dawn today. Hundreds of Palestinian citizens were murdered or 
wounded in this act. 
  In a statement to the JORDAN NEWS AGENCY, Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali described what happened at the Ibrahimi 
Mosque as an unprecedented crime, and as an indication of 
fanaticism, extremism, and lack of respect for human rights and 
sanctities. 
  Dr. al-Majali said that this criminal act constitutes a huge 
obstacle on the road to achieving a just and comprehensive 
peace, which Jordan has been tirelessly seeking to achieve. He 
stressed the need for a full Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories and for the removal of settlements as 
a guarantee to prevent the recurrence of such criminal acts that 
are in conflict with all humanitarian and religious values. 
  Dr. al-Majali said: At this time, when our region is 
witnessing immense events, we are in a dire need for a unity of 
stands and ranks on the Arab and Islamic levels in order to be 
able to confront challenges. 
  In his own name and on behalf of the Jordanian Government, 
Dr. al-Majali extended condolences to the Palestinian leadership 
and to our people in the occupied territories. He said: We 
consider the misfortune of our people in Palestine as our own 
misfortune.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani report:"Syria Accuses Israel of </F>
Pulling Out of Peace Formula"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Diplomatic sources in Damascus said 
yesterday that urgent high-level contacts have been held over 
the past two days between Damascus and Washington to give a new 
impetus to the peace negotiations in Washington, especially as 
the United States has managed to stop the security deterioration 
witnessed recently in southern Lebanon as a result of the 
Israeli military escalation, which threatened a large-scale 
military operation. 
  The diplomatic sources said that Washington stressed to 
Damascus that it had sought to calm the situation in the south 
in order to prepare the atmosphere for new efforts to be made by 
it to secure better conditions for the negotiations' success so 
that they can produce tangible results. 
  The sources added that Washington reemphasized to Syria its 
determination to push the peace process forward, whatever the 
obstacles obstructing it. It also emphasized that prospects for 
achieving peace still exist and that it needs to make further 
contacts to secure an atmosphere of trust among the parties. 
According to the sources, Washington reemphasized that the U.S. 
Administration will not allow the negotiations to fail and that 
it will work to create the atmosphere needed to achieve progress 
that serves the peace process with its real foundations. 
  The sources said that achieving peace and securing a kind of 
trust among the parties requires time and hard work. 
  The situation in southern Lebanon is still shrouded in 
anticipation and caution. No significant development had been 
recorded until midday yesterday. Lebanese sources have told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Syrian-Lebanese meetings held at 
summit level and other levels stressed the resistance's right to 
exercise its role against the occupation. 
  Meanwhile, a Syrian official has accused Israel of 
continuing 
to seek to abort the peace process and thwart the round of 
negotiations currently being held in Washington. The official 
told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that, instead of withdrawing completely 
from the occupied territories, Israel has begun to pull out of 
the comprehensive peace formula. This is why it has since the 
launch of the negotiations been practicing various forms of 
provocations and methods to obstruct these negotiations and 
evade all commitments. 
  The official added: "Israel has begun to play numerous 
tunes: 
The Arabs have not ended the economic boycott, opened the 
borders, or established diplomatic relations; Syria does not 
want peace; and Lebanon has not halted resistance operations. 
The aim of all these pretexts is to obstruct all the efforts 
exerted to lead the peace process to its objectives, as though 
the Arabs must offer measures of trust to Israel." 
  The Syrian official went on to say that Israel is actually 
looking for pretexts to abort the present peace process and is 
planning to conduct separate contacts to secure separate 
agreements in order to impose its conditions on the Arabs and 
obtain concessions from them. It has shown this through its 
aggression and continued shelling of southern Lebanon. 
  Of course, that will not lead to any progress toward peace. 
The official stressed that "Syria participated in the 
negotiations after the U.S. assurances and commitment to the 
peace process, and after the world supported its elements. 
Syria has been patient with all Israeli maneuvers and 
procrastinations, but this patience cannot continue. And Syria 
is not going to beg for peace, nor will it accept the separate 
secret deals: Either a real peace or no peace at all. Syria 
cannot accept an incomplete Israeli peace. And Israel must 
realize very well that as long as the land is occupied and Arab 
rights usurped, it will never enjoy peace or security."

  [Text] Egypt today strongly condemned the incident 
committed by an Israeli settler in Hebron in the occupied West 
Bank, which left scores of Palestinians dead. In a statement 
commenting on the incident, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said: 
Egypt affirms the need to confront the extremism that has hit 
numerous societies of different religions, politics, and 
traditions. 
  The foreign minister said that the incident confirms the 
importance of preserving Palestinian security and not just 
Israeli security. Therefore, calls for security are not 
restricted to Israel alone. He said that in light of the 
dangerous nature of and the signs given by the incident, Egypt 
will take part in any meetings the Security Council decides to 
hold in response to a request from Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat. 
  The foreign minister said the incident affirms the 
importance 
of the subject of Jerusalem and the need to put it on the agenda 
of the negotiations. The fate of Jerusalem cannot be abandoned 
to the behavior of extremists, criminals, or mad men. 
  Elsewhere, the PLO blamed the Israeli Government for the 
massacre committed by a Jewish settler against Palestinian 
citizens praying at the Hebron mosque this morning. The death 
toll from the massacre has risen to 45 martyrs, while four 
Palestinians were killed by the bullets of the Israeli 
occupation Army in Hebron during the violent clashes that 
erupted after the massacre.

  [Text] London, Sanaa, Aden -- A south Yemen military source 
has said that the fighting with northern forces in Zinjibar, 
Mudiyah, and Lawdar in Abyan Governorate was settled at midday 
yesterday. And that troops of the al-'Amaliqah Brigade -- who 
were wearing civilian clothes -- fled, returning to their camp 
after they had deployed on two axes: One in Zinjibar (capital of 
Abyan) to cut off the road to Aden, and one in Lawdar to cut off 
the road to the governorates of Hadhramaut and Shabwah 
  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, secretary general of the 
(northern) General People's Congress [GPC] -- has issued his 
orders to Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim 
Tahir (a northerner) to return the al-Wahdah Brigade to 
Hadhramaut from Abyan. He told him in a message sent to him in 
Aden: "I oblige you to comply in order to pave the way and 
create favorable conditions for starting the implementation of 
the Pledge and Accord Document and to protect unity and 
democracy and spare the nation sedition and infighting." 
  The president blamed the defense minister and southern 
officials for the military movements, instructing the defense 
minister not to mobilize any force except after the approval of 
"the chief of staff (a northerner) and the supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces (the president)." A GPC source accused the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] of violating the rules of military 
movements and the military committee's decisions, namely by 
continuing to move the 30th Brigade from Shabwah to Abyan. But 
the defense minister considered the military committee's 
decision unilateral and decided to complete the process of 
moving the brigade. 
  Although there are no confirmed figures about the number of 
victims, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's information indicates that 700 to 
800 have been killed or wounded. The information attributes 
these high figures to the nature of the guerrilla warfare 
dominating the operations and the sniper method used in the 
streets. Sources said that a force wearing civilian clothes 
comprising about three brigades from the militias belonging to 
the Yemeni Reform Grouping arrived in the area from the north 
and from al-Maraqishah camp to participate in the operations. 
  While southern sources said that they had arrested an 
Algerian extremist among these, they pointed out that their 
participation in the operations and the al-'Amaliqah troops' 
wearing of civilian clothes was designed to drive a wedge 
between the southern al-Wahdah Brigade and the people of the 
governorates, who are known for their support for former 
President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad. On the grounds that the 
al-Wahdah Brigade -- which comprises northern elements from the 
former National Front elements -- carried out reprisal 
operations in the wake of the 13 January 1986 incidents and 
prevented the occurrence of rapprochement between 'Ali Nasir and 
the present YSP leadership. 
  The sources added that a large-scale deployment has taken 
place over the past two days in the northern border 
governorates, including Ta'izz, al-Bayda', and Ma'rib, and also 
Ibb Governorate, which is situated in the region but considered 
to be belong to the YSP by virtue of its support for the 
National front in the period before unity. 
  Air traffic was banned over the al-'Amaliqah Brigade camp 
all 
day yesterday. Eyewitnesses said that the camp opened fire with 
light weapons at 0700 hrs on a southern Mig aircraft which had 
flown over it in a "provocative manner." But it failed to hit 
it because of the speed of the aircraft and the lack of 
high-capability antiaircraft weapons. But southern sources said 
that the aircraft which was fired on was an Ethiopian civilian 
plane. 
  Sources said that Colonel Muhammad Salah, Yemeni deputy 
chief 
of staff and head of the military committee, arrived in 
al-'Amaliqah camp yesterday for the second time in three days in 
a new attempt to contain the confrontation.

  [Text] Hebron, West Bank, Feb 25 (AFP) -- A lone Israeli 
settler gunned down 18 Palestinians and wounded dozens more 
Friday [25 February] at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the 
occupied West Bank City of Hebron, military officials and 
doctors said. 
  The man then turned the gun on himself and committed 
suicide. 
  One Hebron doctor said 16 Palestinians were certified dead 
in 
a Hebron hospital and another two in a hospital in east 
Jerusalem. More than 70 other were wounded. 
  The killer apparently disguised himself in an Israeli Army 
uniform before opening up with an automatic rifle on the Moslem 
faithful who turned out in large numbers for Friday prayers 
during the fasting month of Ramadan. 
  The army imposed a curfew on Hebron and closed off the area 
of the Tomb, which is holy to Jews and Moslems alike and crowded 
every morning. Scuffles broke out in the complex on Thursday 
evening as Israelis celebrated the start of Purim, a holiday 
marking the deliverance of Jews from a massacre in Persia. 
  Police Minister Moshe Shahal condemned the slaughter. 
  "I condemn in the strongest possible way these murders, 
whatever the nationality of the person who committed them," he 
said. 
  Palestinian militants declared a strike on the Gaza Strip in 
memory of the dead and the Koran, the Moslem holy book, was read 
out in the mosques, a correspondent reported. 
  It was the worst killing ever by Jewish settlers, who in 
July 
1983 shot dead four Palestinian students in Hebron. Border 
police shot dead 20 Palestinians on Temple Mount in the Old City 
of Jerusalem in October 1990. 
  The Tomb complex, which houses a mosque, fell under Israeli 
control in the 1967 Middle East war and has since been shared by 
the two religions. 
  Hebron has always been one of the tensest of Palestinian 
towns where 500 Jews live among 70,000 Arabs. Another 5,000 
Jews live in the adjacent settlement of Qiryat Arba'. 
  In Hebron, Palestinian protestors smashed an AFP 
photographer's car with rocks. 
  Before Friday's killings, 1,180 Palestinians had died from 
Israeli bullets since the intifadah or uprising began in 
December 1987. Over the same period 203 Israelis have been 
killed by Palestinians. 
  An anonymous telephone caller to AFP in Jerusalem claimed 
responsibility for the killing in the name Jewish extremists. 
  The caller said the massacre was to avenge the December 6 
shooting by Islamic fundamentalists of an Israeli settler and 
his son, Mordekhay and Shalom Lapid, in Hebron. 
  The caller said he represented the "Zealots of the God of 
Israel", an unknown group. 
  An AFP photographer reported that violent clashes erupted in 
Hebron between Palestinians and soldiers who had opened fire. 
  At the city's Al-Ahli hospital dead bodies were still 
arriving. 
  "The dead and wounded are still being brought in," said 
photographer Patrick Baz. "A small child was just brought in 
dead from bullet wounds. He was wrapped in a blood-stained 
blanket."

  [Excerpt] Hebron, Occupied West Bank, Feb 25 (AFP)--A group 
of up to five Jewish settlers carried out Friday's [25 February] 
massacre of Palestinian worshippers and not just a lone gunman, 
Palestinian witnesses said. 
  'Aziz al-Hashmami, aged 40, told AFP he was inside the Tomb 
of the Patriarchs when the shooting started and said that "four 
to five" gunmen had opened fire as the Palestinian knelt in 
prayer. 
  "Other Palestinians I spoke to also said they saw five," he 
said, without being able to explain what happened to the killers 
afterwards. 
  The Israeli army said the killing was the work of one 
settler 
who apparently committed suicide afterwards. 
  Another witness, Husayn 'Isa al-Rajabi, 42, said he saw a 
second settler feed the gunman with ammunition as he raked the 
worshippers with gunfire. 
  Imam Ibrahim 'Abidin, who was leading Friday prayers, said 
the shots came from "several directions." 
  "It can only be a planned operation because there were a lot 
of settlers inside the mosque," he added. 
  A Palestinian told Israeli radio he saw a gunman firing from 
behind a pillar. 
  "I'm sure that settlers outside the building threw 
cartridges 
to the killer who could keep on firing," the Palestinian said. 
  Military radio said the gunman was Barukh Goldstein, a 
doctor 
from the settlement of Qiryat Arba'. 
  Settlers from there have made death threats against 
Palestinians following a rash of anti-Israeli attacks on the 
West Bank. 
  A Jewish extremist network, mainly from Qiryat Arba', killed 
four Palestinian students from Hebron and committed several 
other attacks. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tunis, 25 Feb (MENA)--The PLO is holding the Israeli 
Government responsible for the criminal and dangerous massacre 
committed by the armed Israeli settlers against Palestinian 
citizens while they were praying at the Hebron mosque at dawn 
this morning. 
  In a statement it issued this morning, the PLO asked the 
U.S. 
and Russian cosponsors of peace, the permanent and nonpermanent 
members of the Security Council, the European Union, the 
nonaligned countries, the Islamic countries, and all the 
international community to stop these dangerous crimes and 
massacres against the Palestinian people. In addition, it asked 
that international protection be provided immediately for the 
Palestinian people. 
  The PLO asked the masses of the Palestinian people to be 
careful and alert to these premeditated schemes, to confront 
them in united rank, and to consider the coming three days as 
days of mourning and general strike. 
  The statement notes that the Palestinian leadership will 
follow up the situation on all levels in order to confront all 
possibilities.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani has said the painful 
tragedy and massacre of fasting Muslims in the town of Hebron by 
the criminal Zionists is a sad example of a lack of healthy 
conscience and weakness of human ethics. He said the beastly 
act of spraying bullets on a fasting people prostrating in the 
safety of the house of God is a very ugly and shameful picture 
further revealing the savage and shameful nature of the 
Zionists. If there was a sufficiently enlightened and healthy 
conscience in the world the incident could have shaken the world 
into ending its policy of support for the Zionist regime. 
  Addressing a gathering of educational officers today Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani criticized the stance of the UN Security 
Council and the sad silence of international organizations, and 
he blamed America and its allies for their support for Israel. 
He said: If the world had correct education and moral 
purification such incidents would not have happened, or even if 
they had they would have caused a wave of protest, anger, and 
disgust across the effective and decisionmaking organizations of 
the world.

  [Text] Dear viewers; please pay attention to a report which 
has just come in: After the brutal massacre by the Zionists in 
the Ibrahim Mosque, in a statement issued by the Government of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, a general day of mourning has been 
declared for 26 February, throughout the country. The text of 
the statement is as follows. 
  In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. The 
cabinet of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
strongly condemns the brutal atrocity by the Zionists in the 
shrine of His Holiness Ebrahim-e Khalil, peace be upon him, 
which ended in the martyrdom and wounding of hundreds of fasting 
Palestinian Muslims. It considers the slaughter to be the 
foreseeable result of the unquestioning support given by the 
world arrogance and American imperialism to the policies of an 
illegal and illegitimate regime, which is an agent of tension 
and crisis in the region and the instigator of the suppression 
and massacre of the Muslims and free minded individuals who wish 
to live in their own homeland. 
  The cabinet of the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, categorically supports the justice seeking struggles of 
the Palestinian nation, and in sympathy with those people and 
the families of the martyrs and injured in that horrific 
disaster declare a general day of mourning throughout the 
country on Saturday 7 Esfand [26th February]. 
  [Signed] The cabinet of the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran

  [Text] Following the savage attack of the Zionists against 
the ranks of fasting Muslim Palestinians in the shrine of his 
holiness Abraham in the town of Hebron, his eminence Ayatollah 
Khamene'i, the guardian of Muslims, has issued a statement. The 
text of the eminent leader's statement is as follows: 
  In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. The 
villainous attack by the Zionists against worshippers in the 
occupied town of Hebron, which left dozens dead and hundreds 
injured, is one of those model crimes which can only be brought 
about by the cruel and bigoted hands of the Zionists and is in 
keeping with the villainy and wretchedness of the usurpers of 
Palestine. 
  This tragic blow is a reminder of the Zionists' other mass 
killings throughout the years of occupation, with this 
difference, that, today, this enormous crime took place before 
the eyes of the entire world. Will the consciences which have 
remained indifferent to what has been happening to Palestinians 
in their own homes be awakened by this tragedy? Will the false 
seekers of peace with the usurper enemy realise their mistake 
now? Will organizations and governments that claim to defend 
human rights, which have disregarded the gravest violation of a 
nation's rights over a period of years, finally end their 
shameless silence now and confess to their past sins? Will the 
American Government accept that it is an accomplice to those who 
have shed the blood of innocent Palestinians, because it has 
consistently given its unconditional support to the Zionist 
government? Or will everyone ignore this tragic incident once 
again, without accepting its implications and learning any 
lessons just as they have failed to pay any attention to the 
other great tragedy of the times in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  Nevertheless, the Palestinian nation will undoubtedly learn 
the appropriate lesson from this incident. Today, once again, 
the bitter truth has been driven home to that oppressed nation 
that it must fight in its own home in order to be able to live 
there. It has been driven home to them that the Zionists -- 
despite the elegant statements of some of their leaders -- 
continue to be the same racist and bigoted savages they have 
been for the past 50 years. And they only need the slightest 
opportunity or excuse to inflict the most villainous blows on 
the Palestinians who are the true owners of the land. 
  Even the most slow-to-believe Palestinians must now be 
convinced that the arrogant regimes that make so many claims 
about the need for the security of the Zionists do not care in 
the slightest about the security of Muslim Palestinians; 
otherwise, the Israeli Army would not dare to massacre sacred 
worshippers in this way. 
  It is through arming and attacking the interests of the 
usurping regime that the Palestinians can obtain the right of 
life and livelihood in their own home. Such is the lesson of the 
Friday morning incident at Hebron. Muslim governments and 
nations also have a great responsibility. The least that Muslim 
nations can demand is the handing over of the murderers and 
their collaborators in the Zionist army to Muslim Palestinians 
for the execution of religious retribution and the dismissal of 
that army's commanders. Of course, the final and only solution 
is to dispossess the usurping Zionists and to transfer Palestine 
to Palestinians of all religions and nationalities. 
  While expressing condolences to the innocent people of 
Palestine, in particular the relatives of the martyrs of the 
incident, I beseech God Almighty for forgiveness for the 
deceased, the recovery of the wounded who were fasting, the 
reform of the Muslim conditions, and a just solution to the 
Palestinian issue, and call on all to pursue this matter with 
all their might. 
  [Signed] Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i

  [Text] After the savage massacre of worshippers at the 
shrine of his holiness Abraham, our country's Foreign Ministry, 
while initiating extensive political moves at the international 
level to confront that horrific act, in a message to the 
Secretary General of the ICO, has called for an urgent meeting 
of the foreign ministers of the member states of that 
organization. 
  The foreign minister, Mr. Velayati, in an interview with our 
correspondent, while declaring Iran's readiness to give any 
assistance to the innocent people of Palestine and for serious 
action against the Zionists, said: Iran's delegation at the 
United Nations has called on the Security Council to take 
measures to end the Zionist atrocity in occupied Palestine. 
  Mr. Velayati added: Despite the Zionists' act, Palestinian 
Muslims will participate in the arenas of confrontation against 
the occupiers and that action [massacre] is an answer for those 
naive people who have pinned their hopes on a peace resulting 
from the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  Our country's foreign minister also held a telephone 
conversation with his Pakistani counterpart and conferred with 
him on the need to convene an ICO meeting.

  [Text] Speaking in the Majles open session this morning 
Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri strongly condemned the Zionists' 
horrific killing of scores of fasting Palestinians in the town 
of Hebron and said this was a preplanned act in cooperation with 
America aimed at suppressing the struggles of the Palestinian 
people. 
  He said: Muslims and officials in Islamic countries should 
not not be tricked by the Zionists' deceitful rationalizations. 
It would be foolish for anyone in the world to think that a few 
extremist or mentally ill Jews could commit such a crime without 
a hand from the Israeli and American military. 
  Explaining the reasons for the crime, the head of the 
legislature said: Presently due to the blessing of the Islamic 
revolution the Zionists are facing great waves of popular 
struggles and Israel with America who are well aware of the 
consequences of the deep rooted resistance by the children of 
the intifadah, Hamas, and other revolutionary children of 
Palestine, are committing such horrendous crimes. 
  He also expressed regret over and criticized the silence of 
international organizations and associations regarding the 
crime. He said in this respect: What is being presented today as 
the Middle East peace plan has no other aim than the expansion 
of the hegemony, crimes, and ominous aims of the Zionist regime. 
  Stating that this crime would not have happened if 'Arafat 
and his cronies had not accepted the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the 
Majles speaker referred to the principled Iranian policy on the 
Zionist regime and said: Muslim nations and governments should 
accept the reality that the enemy will come forward a step for 
every step that they take back. 
  Finally Nateq-Nuri hoped that the children of Palestine will 
continue their struggles with greater morale and uproot the 
usurping regime occupying Jerusalem.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 27, IRNA -- Majlis Vice Speaker Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Hasan Rohani told the Kazakh ambassador to Tehran here 
Sunday that there should be an international will to defend the 
Palestinian nation. 
  Rohani termed the killing and wounding of hundreds of 
Palestinians at the shrine of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon 
him) in al-Khalil [Hebron] Friday as an "unprecedented crime". 
  "The crime indicates that the U.N. cannot fulfil its duties 
this way and that the time has come to amend the United Nations 
Charter," the vice speaker said. 
  In case such amendments are made to the U.N. Charter, not 
only Third World countries can play their role in the world 
organization but the organization would be free from big powers' 
monopoly, he said. 
  "Otherwise," Rohani warned, "world nations can no longer 
trust this organization and they will have no other alternative 
but to rise up." 
  Elsewhere in his remarks, Rohani expressed hope that 
relations between the two countries would expand in various 
fields particularly in economic, trade, scientific, research, 
transport, oil, tourism and agricultural areas. 
  The Kazakh ambassador, too, called for promotion of 
bilateral 
relations in cultural, social, political and economic areas.

  [Text] 'Abu-Hamdan, the head of the office of the Palestine 
Islamic Resistance Movement, HAMAS, in Tehran, stressed that the 
blood bath by the Zionists at the Ibrahimi sanctuary was a 
predetermined plan by the Zionists with full cooperation of the 
Army. 
  'Abu-Hamdan said: With the full support of the Army, and 
using automatic weapons, six Zionist criminals attacked the 
fasting worshipers in prostration from six vantage points, 
martyring and wounding more than 400 of them. But to make the 
world public opinion believe that this was an individual event 
and to bury the details for ever, the Zionist military then 
killed one of the elements who was involved in the attack on the 
Muslims, and who was the main contact with the Israeli Army in 
the execution of this ominous plan. But how could an individual 
person commit such a crime on his own and kill and injure 
hundreds of people? 
  'Abu-Hamdan stressed that despite efforts by the 'Arafat 
gang 
to use the killing to speed up the PLO-Israel deal, HAMAS and 
other militant organizations opposed to concession plans, will 
avenge the martyrs of the Hebron bloody Friday by increasing 
their martyrdom seeking operation. 
  The head of the HAMAS office in Tehran, while criticizing 
the 
weak stance of Arab countries regarding the massacre, said that 
unfortunately, some of them have moved in line with the Zionists 
wishes.

  [Excerpts] Following yesterday's Zionist crimes in the 
occupied Palestine, a number of the Islamic Republic of Iran's 
organizations, foundations, and personalities have issued

and to all world Muslims, particularly Palestine Muslims, and 
condemned the perpetrators of that discriminate crime. 
  The statement issued by Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head 
of 
the judicial power, condemns that horrific crime and offers 
condolences to his eminence the leader, world Muslims, and the 
families of victims of the Hebron incident and stresses: The 
black Friday of Palestine is among crimes that should definitely 
be taken to the International Penal Court [as heard -- Dadgah-e 
Keifari-ye Beinolmelali] in order to bring the Israeli 
perpetrators, commanders, and usurpers to court and punish them 
for their offenses. [passage omitted] 
  Also, the representative of the Iranian Jewish community at 
the Islamic Consultative Majles condemned the criminal tragedy 
of the massacre of the fasting worshipers in the city of Hebron.

<F P=106> [Political report: "The Ugly Crime Committed by the Zionists </F>
in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron"] 
  [Text] The barbaric Zionist crime of the ugly massacre of 
fasting Muslims in Hebron martyred more than 60 persons and 
injured more than 300 others. The crime came at a time when 
Muslims were preparing to celebrate International Jerusalem Day. 
  The Zionist entity officials -- who have failed to achieve 
their satanic objectives despite all their ruses, 
capitulationist solutions, and acts of violence -- are again 
trying their luck through fascist means, as they did in Dayr 
Yasin and Kafr Qasim. By committing massacres and spreading 
terror, they want to deter the oppressed Palestinian Muslims 
from continuing their just and legitimate resistance. 
  The world is once again face to face with a barbaric and 
ugly 
crime that has no justification whatsoever. The Zionist entity 
and the White House leaders are in charge of these practices 
from behind the curtain. 
  The Hebron massacre has put an end to the dreams of the 
bargain seekers and those who indulged the criminal leaders in 
Tel Aviv and called on the Palestinian people to make peace and 
bargain with them. Does not bargaining with such an entity lead 
only to the destruction of the Palestinian Muslim people? Are 
not those ignoring these crimes and calling on the Tel Aviv 
leaders to be friends partners in the crime? What crime has the 
innocent Muslim inhabitants of Hebron committed to be massacred? 
  World public opinion and Muslims everywhere are angry with 
this ugly Zionist crime and are urged to show their correct and 
conscious reaction in order to prevent the Zionists from 
persisting with actions that aim to annihilate Muslims and Islam. 
  If Muslims are lax and pay scant attention to this crime, 
the 
Zionists and their allies in Washington will certainly take the 
next steps. The main objective of the arrogant forces and the 
Zionists is the destruction of the Islamic resistance. The most 
prominent examples of this are seen today in the occupied 
territories and Bosnia. We are confident that Muslims will not 
allow such a satanic plot to pass.

<F P=106> [Unattributed political commentary] </F>
  [Excerpt] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Yesterday's dastardly attack by the Zionist 
forces on the tomb of Abraham in the town of Hebron in occupied 
Palestine, leading to the death or injury of around 400 fasting 
worshipers, has grieved the world of Islam, awakened humanity's 
conscience, and marginalized the world's other news and 
developments. 
  We devote today's political commentary to analyzing the 
various dimensions of that shocking and heart wrenching 
incident. In our interviews with a number of specialists from 
the News Research and Analysis Group, as well as Palestine's 
Islamic Jihad representative in Tehran, we have reviewed 
yesterday's heart rending incident. 
  To start with, we hear the details of the incident from 
Brother Abu-Jihad, the representative of Palestine's Islamic 
Jihad Movement in Tehran. 
  [Begin Abu-Jihad recording, in Arabic, with superimposed 
Persian translation] The incident was one of the most heart 
wrenching events in the entire history of Palestine and indeed 
the history of mankind. In this heart wrenching atrocity, which 
the Zionists committed with the cooperation and participation of 
the Army of occupation, hundreds of worshipers were attacked in 
the Abraham al-Khalil mosque, as they were staging the dawn 
prayers. The large number of victims indicates that several 
people were involved in the crime. While the Zionist regime has 
blamed the crime on a mentally deranged medical doctor, remarks 
made by the chairman of council of Zionist settlements in 
defense of that criminal removed any doubt that may have existed 
about the direct involvement of the Zionist regime in 
yesterday's operations. Although the tomb of Abraham is 
constantly controlled and guarded by 40 military personnel, only 
three soldiers were present at the scene on the day of the 
incident. 
  We are sorry that at a time when the blood of the Muslim 
people of Palestine is being shed, some people claim that the 
Zionist regime is pursuing peace. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] In order to exonerate itself from the 
responsibility for this atrocity, the Zionist regime has claimed 
that a mentally deranged person, or a few fanatical Zionists, 
had perpetrated the atrocity. 
  In reference to this claim, Abu-Jihad says: We believe that 
the Zionist regime is fully responsible for the crime. By 
licensing the possession of arms and the reopening of military 
barracks to train the Jews, the Zionist regime must shoulder the 
blame for the hostile acts committed by its citizens. 
Furthermore, the violent behavior of the Zionist regime toward 
demonstrators, who had come out to condemn the incident, was yet 
more proof of the Zionist regime's collusion with the criminals. 
  In its first reaction to the tragedy, the American 
Government 
announced that it hoped the incident would not effect the 
process of compromise and negotiations between Israel and the 
PLO. Ne'matzadeh, a specialist in the Middle East section of the 
news research and analysis group, says: 
  [Begin Ne'matzadeh recording] In order to throw light on 
Israel's objectives, one must analyze the political 
circumstances at the time of the incident. Israel has so far 
gained whatever it has been seeking to gain from the 
Gaza-Jericho Accord, and has officially achieved whatever it 
demanded from 'Arafat. It has gained political legitimacy, 
international acceptance, transformation of its warmongering and 
domineering image, influence over the Arab world, formal 
domination over the occupied land of Palestine, control over 
borders, roads, passes and Zionist settlements, and finally 
domestic and international security. Israel, in other words, has 
been able to make 'Arafat concede to all its demands. 
  It seems therefore, that the Zionist regime considered the 
present juncture as an opportune time to show its real image to 
the Palestinians in general, and the rejectionist camp in 
particular. This violent image is in reality the true and 
authentic face of the Zionist society; an image that in effect 
serves to consolidate the foundations of the Zionist regime by 
placing it in a position of strength vis-a-vis its opponents. 
  Moreover, Israel has specifically targeted the Islamists in 
yesterday's attacks. This carries a message of serious threat; 
a message that is backed by the West. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 26, IRNA -- There is a feeling of 
hurt and anguish in Muslim circles at the news of the slaughter 
of innocent Muslims by Israelis in a mosque in Hebron, Palestine. 
  IRNA talked to a cross section of Muslim intelligentsia from 
different walks of life today to elicit their views. The 
reaction everywhere was one of shock and disblief. People were 
also highly critical of the agreement reached between Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) leader and the Israeli Government 
late October. 
  Najma Heptullah, deputy chairman of the upper house of the 
Indian parliament called the incident tragic. She suggested 
that both the PLO and the Israeli Government must be cautious 
for there are people on both sides who are against a lasting 
peace in the occupied lands. 
  Heptullah said while such a mishap was expected, it was up 
to 
the two sides to diffuse the tension and carry on with the 
action for peace. 
  Syed Shahabuddin, member of parliament and a vocal advocate 
of Muslim issues was anguished to hear of the incident. He can 
now see the agreement between PLO and the Israeli Government 
resting on very shaky foundation. 
  Unless Israel clearly agrees to vacate all occupied 
territories, no permanent solution can be found, Shahabuddin 
said adding that this was the main stumbling block to the 
possibility of a peace. He wanted all settlers to be disarmed 
so that such mishaps would not be repeated. 
  Students' islamic Movement (SIM) holds that the issue of 
Palestine and that of 'Bait-al-Muqaddas' is that of all Muslims 
all over the world. 
  Anwar Ali, secretary general of the organisation feels that 
the agreement between the two sides is baseless. It is an 
attempt to thwart the Palestine movement. 
  Ali added that the entire Muslim world was alarmed at the 
way 
in which the Israeli police and army had turned a blind eye to 
the murder in cold blood of scores of worshipers. 
  Mulana Mukarram Ahmad, chief imam of the Fatehpuri mosque in 
New Delhi, feels it is certain big powers who are creating all 
the trouble. Innocent Muslims are their choice targets every 
where. He expressed shock and said that all parties must work 
for peace. 
  The people of Palestine have gone through very bad times. 
That phase must come to an end, he said. On whether the 
incidence will derail the peace process, he said while the 
possibilty was always there, it can be tided over in the 
interest of peace if the Israelis are sincere. 
  Syed Hamid, former vice chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim 
University felt the act was a most atrocious one likely to queer 
the pitch of the negotiations going on between PLO and Israel. 
He felt the ball was in the Israeli court now. They must 
provide the necessary security to the Palestinians since they 
were in command. 
  S. Burney, former governor of the state of Haryana and a 
retired civil servant called the incident most painful. He said 
all violence must be avoided, for violence begets violence. 
  The slaughter, he said, will have a lot of serious 
repercussions. He only hoped that peace be restored.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 27, IRNA -- Iranian morning dailies 
Sunday condemned the Friday massacre of Muslim Palestinians by 
the Zionists at Ibrahim mosque in al-Khalil [Hebron] and said it 
would entail grave consequences. 
  The English daily KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL said that the 
Palestinians were sure to make the Zionists pay heavily for 
their crimes. 
  The fact that "such a despicable act should have occurred in 
the holy month of Ramadhan and that too in a sacred place and at 
a time when Muslims were in prayer speaks of volumes of the 
peace proclamations that Zionist Premier Yitzhaq Rabin has been 
making since he signed the fraudulent autonomy agreement with 
PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat on September 13 in Washington." 
  Refuting Tel Aviv claims to distance from the massacre by 
blaming the incident on a lone deranged gunman, the article said 
such a destructive crime could not have been carried out single 
handed and it's certain that the Zionist regime was involved in 
the premeditated murderous attack. 
  "Sponsoring state terrorism is not a new game for the 
Zionist 
regime," said the daily adding, "it is a part of state policy, 
backed by its Western allies, ever since Israel was created 45 
years ago." 
  The editorial criticized Western governments for turning a 
blind eye and remaining silent on the Zionist atrocities against 
Palestinian Muslims. 
  Referring to Washington's approach, it said while it quickly 
condemns "acts of terrorism" or calls for a halt to violence by 
the Palestinians it has never asked the Zionist regime to disarm 
the Jewish settlers or give up their provocative acts even after 
initiating the peace process. 
  It reminded that the Jewish settlers in Hebron were armed 
with the latest military equipment and that the Jewish 
extremists wanted to turn the region into a Jewish town and 
therefore had indulged in provocative acts to force out the 
Palestinian residents. 
  Turning to the "sincere condolences" expressed by Rabin on 
this occasion, the paper said, "Rabin has mastered the art of 
speaking peace through one end and firing bullets through the 
other." 
  On claims by peace brokers that Israel and the PLO are more 
than half-way to launching Palestinian self-rule, it said, "in 
reality the Zionists are more than half-way to wiping out the 
Arab population in the land of the Palestinians." 
  Another English daily TEHRAN TIMES criticized the 
indifference shown by the West to the Palestinian plight and 
said that the world Muslims should take the initiative and begin 
implementing independent measures to resolve this historical 
injustice. 
  "The world Muslims, particularly the Palestinians, can use 
their own potentials and capabilities derived from Islam and its 
traditions to reject those leaders who still believe in making 
peace with the butchers of Tel Aviv, and remove the Israeli 
cancer from the body of Islamic Middle East." 
  It said that the illegal Jewish settlements populated by 
recent Russian and East European immigrants are ripe for 
physical violence because of social, religious and cultural 
incompatibility of the Zionists with the indigenous Palestinian 
population. 
  Turning to the Zionists' refusal to abide by U.N. 
resolutions, it said that the Jews have believed that they can 
not only steal Palestine but also massacre Palestinian Muslims. 
  "The selective and totally biased way in which the U.N. 
implements its own resolutions regarding Palestine is weighing 
heavily on the world's conscience, while the United States, as 
Israel's military supplier and financial supporter, bears the 
major share of guilt for Palestine's miseries as well as for 
this latest Zionist savagery." 
  The daily refuted the U.S. attempts to introduce itself as 
an 
honest broker in the Arab-Israel conflict that has humanitarian 
motives free from political and financial considerations. 
  "But the recent history of U.S. and Western European 
mediation in this conflict has proven that the West only acts 
when it is assured that the consequences of its actions are not 
against Israel or Western interests. 
  Commenting on the same subject, the Persian daily JOMHURI-YE 
ESLAMI said that all should enter the scene to take revenge for 
the massacre of innocent Palestinian Muslims. 
  The incident, the daily noted, unveiled the true nature of 
the Zionists at the international scene and to the world nations. 
  This showed that Palestinians are not secure even in their 
mosques and at the time of prayer. However, said the article, 
this is while the traitor 'Arafat and his compromising faction 
are even ready to massacre Palestinians to guarantee further 
safety for the Zionists. 
  The occupied Palestine is passing through sensitive and 
determining moments, stressed the article, adding that the 
crime, aimed at cementing 'Arafat-Israel compromise, reveals the 
vicious alliance of Zionism and its supporters. 
  "However, there is evidence showing that the enemy has 
repeated the same big blunder in this connection and the 
Palestinian nation will tremble the earth under the feet of the 
usurper Zionists," concluded the daily.

  [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran has declared its 
readiness to assist the victims of the Hebron black Friday. 
  The Central News Unit reports that Mr. Mohajerani, head of 
the Committee for Supporting the Palestine Islamic Revolution 
[CSPIR], in an exclusive interview stated: The Islamic Republic 
of Iran is ready to send pharmaceutical and food aid to those 
who suffered from the recent Zionist atrocity in Hebron through 
international relief organizations. 
  On the effects of the atrocity on the process of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, the head of CSPIR said: The territory of 
occupied Palestine has witnessed a new move and fervor within 
the intifada. Though Nazareth used to be considered a safe city 
for the Zionists so far, it has witnessed popular revolt in 
recent days. 
  Referring to the fact that the recent Zionist action has 
once 
again exposed the false claims of those professing to support 
human rights, Mr. Mohajerani said: In line with other Islamic 
nations, Islamic states must also make a serious decision to 
resolve the Palestine issue. 
  In conclusion, he called on the people of Iran to take 
another practical step toward supporting the oppressed 
Palestinians by their solid presence on Jersusalem Day.

<F P=106> [Interview with "expert" Mr. Ne'matzadeh of the News </F>
Research and Commentary Group by unidentified announcer; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] Yesterday morning, the al-Ibrahimi shrine in the 
city of Hebron near Jerusalem witnessed a shattering catastrophe 
in which hundreds of fasting worshipers were fired upon by 
Zionists while they were praying and were made to wallow in 
blood and dust. 
  The incident was so catastrophic that it caused a swift 
eruption in the Palestinians' ranks. The Zionist regime 
immediately announced a state of emergency and put the finishing 
touches on the atrocity initiated by an armed Zionist by 
ordering its usurping soldiers to shoot at another group of 
Palestinians who had rushed to assist the wounded and they also 
joined the ranks of martyrs. We asked the expert of the News 
Research and Commentary Group to give us his assessment of the 
political dimensions of this incident: 
  [Begin recording] [Announcer] Mr. Ne'matzadeh, the Zionist 
regime is seeking to exonerate itself from the responsibility 
for this catastrophe by attributing it to a so-called mentally 
deranged or insane individual. I would like to know your 
opinion in this regard. 
  [Ne'matzadeh] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. With salutations to our dear compatriots and 
condolences on this shattering and soul searing incident, which 
has plunged the entire Islamic world in grief, I wish to state 
that it is natural that the Zionist regime, or any other 
criminal, would not wish to accept the negative consequences of 
a crime that he has committed. Therefore he resorts to blaming 
others. Israel is capitalizing on this atrocity but totally 
refuses to take responsibility for it. Can it be acceptable from 
the legal point of view that the Zionist officials are not 
responsible for this incident and its consequences? 
  Incidentally, the facts are contrary to the wishes of the 
usurpist regime. According to international law, the convention 
on prisoners of war, regulations regarding occupied areas, the 
Zionist regime is basically responsible for the security of the 
residents of the occupied areas which it controls. Therefore, 
regardless of who has perpetrated such a crime, if the Zionist 
regime is not able to ensure the security of the residents in 
the occupied areas, it should either evacuate these areas 
immediately and hand them over to the owners, or it should 
delegate the security of the occupied areas to UN forces. 
  Thus, such rhetoric is unacceptable in international law, 
and 
incidents with such dimensions and depth cannot be blamed on a 
single mentally unbalanced Zionist. In addition, the question 
arises: Who armed this allegedly demented individual? In 
principle, the arming of the Zionist residents in these 
settlements is a policy that the Zionist soldiers are 
implementing officially. It is the Zionist army that permits 
them to carry weapons. In addition to giving them weapons and 
permitting them to carry them about, the armed forces also 
trains them to use them. Thus, it is very easy to identify who 
is responsible for this incident. 
  Aside from this, while the al-Ibrahimi shrine is under the 
stringent control of the usurper Zionist regime's soldiers, and 
the fasting Palestinian worshipers passed through strict 
security checks on entering, how could armed Zionists pass 
through such a strict security system without any coordination 
on the part of the usurper armed forces and plunge the innocent 
people into blood and dust while they are praying? 
  Woe to their shamelessness. The Zionist regime considers 
itself absolved of this crime. After this incident--which is 
not considered an exceptional one in Palestine and is in 
complete conformity with the usual policy of the Zionist 
regime--the question that arises is: Why were the compromising 
Palestinians not attacked? Why did a mentally deranged 
individual not attack the team of Palestinian negotiators who 
were holding talks with the Zionist regime? It is clear that 
the objective was precisely predetermined. The Palestinian 
people are the main elements, the backbone of the people's 
uprising -- that is, the devout stratum devoted to Islam. Thus, 
the targeting of the worshipers in a mosque while praying and 
fasting is in complete conformity with the policy of the Zionist 
regime. 
  The attack was aimed at the real enemy of the Zionist regime 
and therefore, the mental derangement of an individual or 
individuals involved is a mere fabrication on the part of 
political and propaganda apparatus of the Zionist regime. 
  This is one of the usual ploys of the political and 
propaganda apparatus of this regime. The blaze in the al-Aqsa 
Mosque in 1967, the holiest mosque in Islam after the Masjid 
al-Haram in Mecca and the Prophet's mosque in Medina, was also 
attributed to a lunatic. Only three years ago, a large number of 
Palestinian workers were massacred, and even that was attributed 
to a psychotic. The character of a madman has consistently been 
present in the history of the crimes of the Zionists and will 
continue to be so. 
  What is interesting is that we should realize that the head 
of the Zionist council resident in the Zionist settlement said 
that the main person responsible had no psychological 
aberrations or mental imbalance. If we are to assume that the 
person or persons responsible did have some degree of psychosis, 
then how about those who announced martial law immediately after 
this shattering crime? How about those who fired bullets at the 
other concerned Palestinians? How about those who shot and 
martyred those who had hastened to assist the wounded and had 
gathered outside the al- Khalil hospital to donate blood? 
  [Announcer] What objectives is the Israeli regime pursuing 
by resorting to such actions and what does it hope to gain in 
this manner? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] There are some issues the Zionist hierarchy 
might have in mind. First, Israel has reaped benefits from the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, and has already got what it wanted from the 
accord it signed with 'Arafat at present. Political legitimacy, 
international popularity, revamping of its warmongering image, 
official domination over Palestinian borders, highways, roads, 
settlements, internal and foreign security, security control and 
all else. So what is the importance of continuing the talks on 
accords? Now the time has come to once again show its true face, 
which is the same one that appeals to Zionist society and 
strengthens the Zionist regime's base inside Israel and at the 
same time undermines its political rivals. 
  In addition, you witnessed that Israel has targeted the 
Islamists. This is in itself a message, a threat which has the 
support of the West. You have observed that no one has 
condemned the Zionist regime or said that it is responsible. At 
most, they just condemned the incident. 
  [Announcer] In your opinion, what could be the repercussions 
of this incident? Is it possible that it will overshadow the 
negotiations pertaining to the 'Arafat-Israel compromise and 
halt this process? 
  [Ne'matzadeh] In my opinion, this does not seem possible. 
'Arafat has burned his bridges and has passed the point of no 
return. He does not see any recourse but to succumb to the 
enemy. U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has sensed the danger of 
the possible repercussions of this incident on the talks, has 
invited the two sides, the Palestinians and the Israelis, to 
continue their talks in Washington. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed political commentary] </F>
  [Text] The Ibrahimi Mosque crime cannot be viewed from a 
political viewpoint and be detached from the nature of the 
conflict in the area. The savage crime did not take place for 
political motives to have it be said that the occupied territory 
is witnessing political violence and that violence by its nature 
hits in all directions. 
  The attack on the worshipers in Hebron clearly shows the 
religious dimension of the crime. The Jewish settlers think 
that the Muslims must leave their areas, that these territories 
belong to Israel, and that whoever refuses to leave will have to 
be liquidated in an ugly way. It is clear that the attack on 
the Muslim worshipers in a sacred place reflects the depth of 
the Jewish hatred, which has been manifested in more than one 
way. The Talmudic mentality agrees with the logic of force used 
by the Jews against the Palestinian people and the other Muslim 
peoples. 
  The Zionist aim is to uproot the Palestinian people and 
force 
them to surrender so that the settlements can stay in the 
occupied territories and the Jews can have the upper hand 
politically, militarily, and economically. 
  In light of the clear Zionist aims, the practical response 
to 
this crime is not to absorb the emotional reaction of the Muslim 
masses and regard the incident as a transient moment of madness. 
The Muslims are called upon to seriously and genuinely support 
the Palestinian people by supporting the intifadah and enabling 
the Palestinians to exercise the right of legitimate defense. 
It is unreasonable for the Palestinian people to remain the 
victims of Zionist terrorism and the continuing madness while 
the governments and regimes call on the Palestinian people to 
refrain from exercising their right of self-defense on the 
pretext of facilitating the peace process. 
  The natural response to the Zionist crime is to make the 
Israelis understand that Palestinian blood is no less precious 
than Jewish blood, and that for every Palestinian that is killed 
an Israeli attacker must be killed. The battle in essence is 
one of existence between the Palestinian people and the new 
immigrant Jewish settlers. When the Jews seek to implement 
their designs through a Talmudic ideology, which they believe is 
sacred and regard as their strategic program, the resistance 
idea must rely on a solid basis, especially when the other ideas 
have been frustrated as a result of the miserable illusion of 
peace. 
  The series of unending violence, blood, and terrorism that 
is 
affecting the Palestinian people confirms that the talk about 
peace is only designed to dope the Muslim masses and make them 
believe that the area is moving toward peaceful coexistence. 
This is at a time when the correct reaction is to give the 
masses freedom of action to prove their ability to defend the 
Muslim nation's sanctities and dignity. Restricting popular 
reaction will be the biggest service rendered to the 
Zionist-Western scheme in the area. Official, rhetorical 
reactions will not dress the wounds of the Palestinian people 
and will not make the Jews understand that their crimes will not 
remain unpunished. Israel is used to rhetorical statements and 
long communiques. But a single jihad operation in southern 
Lebanon or in the occupied territory is sufficient to teach the 
Jews many lessons. It will teach them that their security will 
always be threatened because security cannot be based on 
usurpation, terrorism, and the logic of force.

  [Text] Once again hot blood has been shed in Palestine, and 
with the martyrdom of scores of Palestinian worshippers in the 
holy month of Ramadan, the world of Islam is mourning. 
  Yesterday morning, the secure sanctity of Prophet Abraham in 
the town of Hebron, near Beit al-Moqadas, went through a tragic 
and shocking incident in which hundreds of Muslim worshippers, 
while in prostration, were massacred. 
  The catastrophe was caused by armed Zionists. 
  These Zionist assailants continued to fire at the 
worshippers 
for a full ten minutes without any break. However, there was 
not shown any reaction by the armed Israeli troops who were 
stationed around the mosque. 
  Every minutes 900 bullets were sprayed at the worshippers' 
lines, and the Zionist attackers even had enough time to reload 
their machineguns. 
  The army of the Zionist regime only at the end of this 
heinous crime entered the scene. The troops took away the 
martyrs and put them in a mass grave. They also prevented blood 
donations to the wounded Palestinians who were transferred to a 
local hospital. Also by firing at the gathering of the 
Palestinians the military men killed and wounded scores of them. 
  The point noteworthy in this tragic incident relates to the 
statement of the Zionist regime's prime minister, in which he 
declared that the Zionist assailant who led the group of 
attackers was mad. In this way, the rulers in Israel, despite 
having planned such a plot, have once again attributed the 
entire catastrophe to someone else without taking responsibility 
for its negative impacts. 
  But the fact is that the mosque of prophet Abraham was under 
the siege and strict control of hundreds of Israeli military men 
[as heard]. Moreover, for months now the town of Hebron has 
been besieged by the Zionist troops. How then can it be 
imagined that, in the absence of any coordination with the 
Israeli Army, and while tough control was in force, several 
attackers could manage to massacre hundreds of people and drench 
the mosque compound with blood? 
  Of course this is not for the first time that such a major 
catastrophe has been committed by the Zionists in the occupied 
Palestine. The lives of hundreds, rather thousands, of 
defenseless human beings constantly fall victim to the sinister 
designs of the Zionist occupiers. However, in the end, by 
attributing such a major tragedy to a crazy individual, the 
Zionist regime is relieved of all responsibility in this regard. 
  Arson in the sacred Al-Aqsa mosque was attributed to a crazy 
man and also crushing of a number of Palestinians under the 
wheels of an Israeli truck was alluded to a madman in a bid to 
cover up such crimes. But while under international law and the 
provision set by the international community as well as the 
Fourth Geneva Convention, an occupier has full responsibility 
for controlling the regions under its control, the occupiers 
alone are answerable to any sort of insecurity in such regions. 
Hence any divestment of the Zionist regime's responsibility is 
unacceptable in legal terms. Moreover, what occurred yesterday, 
killing hundreds of fasting worshippers, in itself is the 
outcome of the Zionist regime's criminal acts. 
  In fact, arming of the Zionist residents in various 
settlements and imparting military training to them are governed 
by a policy which is being implemented by the occupier army of 
Israel itself. It is a usual policy which was supplying the 
Jewish settlers with weapons so as to kill the Palestinians in 
the event of any move, even a doubtful one, does not allow the 
Palestinians to defend themselves and to obtain weapons for this 
purpose. 
  The world people now pose this question: If the 
international 
community, through its silence and by issuing ceremonial 
resolutions, had not bypassed the tragedy of Palestine and if 
the United States, through its political, economic and military 
aids to and its covert and overt support for Israel, had not 
left it free to commit such crimes, would the oppressed nation 
have still become the victim of the Zionists' racist designs?

  [Text] Yesterday's brutal and barbaric attack on the 
Palestinian worshippers at the Abraham mosque in Hebron, which 
was carried out by the Zionists and during which hundreds of 
Muslims were martyred and wounded, has caused a wave of the 
world Muslims wrath and hatred. The leader of the Islamic 
revolution, Ayatollah Khamene'i, in an important message in 
connection with the crime, described the painful catastrophe a 
reminder of the mass murders carried out by the Zionists during 
the occupation, saying that these crimes are now being committed 
openly and before the eyes of the world people. 
  In part of his message, the leader of the Islamic revolution 
said today: The bitter reality, that the oppressed Palestinian 
nation is compelled to carry out a struggle on its own homeland 
to be able to live there, has once again been dawned upon that 
nation. 
  The leader of the Islamic revolution, then addressing the 
world bodies and the governments, the so-called defenders of the 
human rights that for years have ignored the human rights 
violations of a nation in Palestine, posing the question as to 
whether this time, too, these organizations will continue their 
silence and whether those having forced peace with the usurper 
enemy will realize their mistakes. 
  Yesterday's horrible crime committed at the Abraham mosque 
in 
Hebron is a shocking event which cannot easily be overlooked 
and, as initial reaction, covered by the news reports of mass 
media, show the dimensions of the crime are so widespread that 
even the Western political circles and the supporters of the 
Zionist regime have shown a negative reaction. In this 
connection the U.S. State Department released a statement 
yesterday strongly condemning the horrible and terrorist attack. 
The U.S. administration in the statement, saying that the crime 
stresses the need for expediting the Arab-Israeli talks, has 
called on the two sides negotiating for the signing of the 
compromising agreement between Palestine and Israel to continue 
their talks. At the same time, France and Russia, through their 
official stance in the world bodies, such as the Amnesty 
International and the human rights organizations, in their 
statements have condemned the crime and along with that the 
leaders of the Islamic governments and organizations have also 
strongly condemned the Zionist attacks against the Muslims. 
  What happened at Hebron yesterday has given rise to strong 
reactions on a large scale and in the political circles and it 
undoubtedly deserves condemnation. The Muslim government and 
nation have great responsibility in following up to find who are 
behind the crime. But from the political point of view what has 
provoked the Western concern and the concern of the U.S. with 
respect to the consequences of the horrible incident is the 
impact that this can have on the future of the peace talks, 
especially when nothing is clearly predictable as yet. Further 
there are many questions posed with regard to the Muslim 
reaction over the crime and Western political analysts cannot 
easily find answers for these questions.

  [Text] The fury and condemnation at the heinous atrocity 
perpetrated by the Zionists in massacring fasting worshipers at 
the al-Ibrahimi shrine in Hebron continue unabated. The Muslim 
Palestinians protested yesterday against this merciless killing, 
which has grievously wounded the conscience of mankind. They 
held strikes and, despite the curfew imposed by the Zionist 
armed forces, they spilled onto the streets to demonstrate and 
clashed with the Zionist soldiers. 
  In these clashes, three Palestinians were killed by the 
Zionist executioners and nearly 50 others were wounded. Thus, 
the number of victims killed or wounded at the hands of the 
Zionist forces in the past two days has reached 300. The 
indignant Palestinian demonstrators attacked 40 Israeli targets 
with bombs. One of the most important and distinctive 
characteristics of the demonstrations in the past two days in 
the territories occupied since 1948--where the Palestinians are 
a minority of the population--is the flourishing of the 
intifadah. 
  The staging of extensive demonstrations in the cities of 
Nazareth and Yafo and the southern environs of Tel Aviv by the 
incensed Palestinians and the setting afire of dozens of 
vehicles and stores belonging to the Zionists are unprecedented 
in the past decade. The anger and frenzy of the Palestinian 
Muslims at the staggering atrocity committed by the Zionists in 
the al-Ibrahimi shrine was so extensive that for the first time 
the Zionist regime has imposed a curfew in order to protect the 
lives of the Jews in the settlements the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. 
  According to political observers, at its session today the 
Zionist cabinet may make some decisions in order to placate the 
enraged Muslims because of the pressure due to the spread of the 
Palestinian Muslims' intifadah in the past two days. Some 
Palestinian prisoners may be released in this regard. 
  The UN Security Council session is to conclude its 
deliberations today on the recent crime of the Zionists. In 
view of the fact that the United States gives quite a lot of 
arms and financial and economic assistance to the Zionist regime 
and thus is a de facto accomplice to all the crimes of this 
racist regime, it is possible that in its usual way the United 
States will use its influence in the Security Council to prevent 
the UN from playing its legitimate role in the Palestinian 
crisis. 
  Political analysts believe that the heart wrenching crime at 
the al-Ibrahimi shrine has highlighted the fact that the greater 
the international legitimacy attributed to the Zionists, the 
more crimes they will commit. This incident further proves that 
the Zionist settlements in the occupied territories are a major 
problem, and coexistence between the Palestinians and the 
residents of the Zionist settlements, which is envisaged in the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, is very questionable. 
  The extensive demonstrations by the people and students in 
Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon, and the demand for the immediate 
cessation of the talks and the breaking of all kinds of 
relations with the transgressor Zionist regime show that the 
Muslim people of the region do not concur with the policies 
adopted by their governments. This places the Arab countries in 
a position where they have to make a fateful choice on whether 
to choose their people or the Zionist regime.

  [Text] The blood of the martyrs shed in the massacre of the 
fasting Palestinian worshipers at the shrine of Abraham, peace 
be upon him, in Hebron continues to have strong repercussions on 
the regional and international levels. The rising waves of the 
Palestinians' intifadah, which have unprecedentedly intensified 
as a result of this soul rending incident, have extended to 
include the Arab countries of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon 
and have sparked off unprecedented and extensive demonstrations 
and protest marches. 
  The leaders of Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon, have suspended 
the 
compromise talks in Washington in answer to the people's demands 
and in protest of the massacre of the Palestinians. This is 
considered a major political defeat for the United States, which 
tried to mitigate the impact of this incident on the compromise 
talks since the incident at the Abrahamite mosque become known. 
  After the massacre U.S. President Bill Clinton personally 
invited Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister of the Zionist regime, and 
Yasir 'Arafat, the PLO chief, to go to Washington immediately to 
continue the compromise talks until a definite conclusion is 
achieved. The Zionist regime and 'Arafat, who opportunistically 
and quickly gave a positive reply to the invitation, are now 
facing a political impasse with the suspension of the talks by 
Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. Thus, Yasir 'Arafat, who claims the 
leadership of the Palestinians, is facing a new political defeat 
because of his haste and his over eagerness to go to Washington. 
Political experts believe that possibly within the next few 
hours, 'Arafat too will announce his decision to dispense with 
going to Washington for talks with Rabin. 
  Meanwhile, the growing impact of the incident at the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque on the international level has placed the UN 
Security Council under pressure to adopt a resolution against 
the Zionist regime. During its previous session, which was held 
after the incident, the Security Council was unable to reach a 
decision on a resolution because of pressures by the United 
States, which wanted them to be content with a mere statement on 
the incident. However, with the growing impact of the Zionist 
regime's crimes and the extensive reactions to it in various 
countries of the world, as well as protests by regional and 
international organizations, the Security Council has now agreed 
to consider a resolution condemning the massacre of the 
Palestinian worshipers. 
  The current developments in occupied Palestine and on the 
regional and international levels during the past few days show 
that the Zionist regime and its Western mentors who were behind 
the recent crime have now lost the initiative despite all their 
efforts and that they lack the power to confront the 
repercussions stemming from this incident. This impotence is 
seen especially in some Arab regimes such as Egypt which, by 
suppressing the Muslims' demonstrations protesting the Zionist 
regime and by continuing political links with the regime, has 
come into confrontation with the popular movement. But with the 
extensive wave of Islamic awakening in the region and in the 
world, the policy of suppression definitely will not only be 
unable to stop the raging wave of developments, but will also 
further expand this wave.

  [Text] Moscow, 30 January -- Russia has gone through the 
period of inheritance from the Soviet Union which took place in 
particular when relations between countries underwent so-called 
complete normalization. At the present time, new relations have 
been established between Russia and China, they have acquired 
the nature of normal cooperation without the need for any kind 
of "further steering together" of the partners. This was stated 
by Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation minister of foreign 
affairs, replying to questions put by the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent on board the aircraft. The Russian minister 
returned to Moscow last night after an official visit to China. 
  The minister pointed out the specific spheres of 
Russian-Chinese bilateral ties, in particular the development of 
cross-border relations, military-technical, and economic 
cooperation. At the same time he noted the "extensive field 
of unused possibilities" that also exists here. 
  The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said 
that 
possibilities exist for "harmonizing" the interests of two 
great powers, Russia and China, both on a regional as well as on 
a world level. 
  Speaking of the prospects for a democratic movement in 
Russia, Andrey Kozyrev said that he does not think the 
resignation of Yegor Gaydar was a "necessity." He reported that 
he was very doubtful about this issue, something which he told 
Yegor Gaydar in a conversation. "I respect his personal motives, 
but from the point of view of the correlation of forces 
following the elections in Russia and the prospects for a 
democratic movement, I do not think that it was necessary to 
take such a step, he should have tried to work in the government 
and to defend his point of view," Andrey Kozyrev said. In his 
opinion, what was needed was to promote the strengthening of the 
democrats' position, especially after their relative defeat at 
the elections. 
  The minister stressed that the President of Russia is at the 
present time a uniting force, a guarantor of the reformist 
transformations, during the implementation of which there are 
bound to be temporary lapses. Nevertheless, Andrey Kozyrev 
stressed that the deed had been done and he thinks that this 
development of events will somehow act as an incentive for the 
democrats to regroup somewhat.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shemelev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- Russia has left behind the 
vestiges of the Soviet Union's policy, which included also the 
so-called "full normalisation of Russian-Chinese relations", as 
well as "the stage of ideological love and hate" between the two 
countries, according to Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Russia and China have established new relations 
characterised 
by normal cooperation without any "special adjustment" between 
the partners. The Russian foreign minister said this responding 
to an ITAR-TASS question on board the airplane which brought him 
back to Moscow from an official visit to China. 
  "Our relations now contain elements of geostrategical mutual 
understanding," Kozyrev said. "We are not working against any 
third country, or the West, for example. We do not have any 
anti-Western overtones in our cooperation, but no more do we 
look back at the West or depend on the West," Kozyrev said. "The 
two great powers feel the need for interaction relating to an 
extensive range of questions both on the regional and global 
scales". 
  These circumstances enabled Russia to raise the question 
about constructive partnership with China, and the response of 
the Chinese leadership to this idea was "very balanced, and 
positive in principle", Kozyrev said. He expressed confidence 
that this idea "in one form or another, enriched and mutually 
filled with specific substance" can be implemented ahead of 
Chinese leader Jiang Zemin's forthcoming visit to Moscow this 
year. 
  Speaking about his impressions from visiting the 
free-enterprise zone in Shenzhen, Kozyrev called it "very 
useful" and stressed that reforms in the zone were an example of 
economic development "Chinese style". It can be seen as part of 
"great Chinese experience of reforming its economy in a more 
modern direction". It is obvious that China is "looking for 
ways of entering the modern world, a world of high technologies 
and living standards". 
  But the main thing is for us is to entertain no illusions 
about the possibility of copying this experience. We tend to 
idiologise and idealise now Western, now Chinese experience, or 
vice-versa, Kozyrev said. My visit to Shenzhen showed that 
neither exists "per se", although there are specific conditions 
in both places. One can say that Shenzhen is one of the 
regional versions of the development of Chinese reforms and the 
conclusions to be drawn from this is that Russia should look for 
its own versions of economic development applicable in the 
specific conditions of its own regions. 
  The minister explained what he meant when referring to China 
as a country "near abroad". "There are now and can be no 
countries of the first rank and the second rank. When we speak 
about the development of ties with one or another country "near 
abroad" we mean that it is one of the closest neighbouring 
states and we must have goodneighbourly relations with it. One 
of the high priorities in the Russian foreign policy has always 
been the creation of a belt of goodneighbourliness and 
cooperation, Kozyrev recalled. "I am seeking to affirm the most 
direct, and if you will sound sense of the words "West, East, 
near abroad. The countries "near abroad" are those which are 
closest to us and with which we need to develop relations as we 
do with any other state without forgetting that they are our 
neighbours," Kozyrev said. 
  As concerns prospects for the democratic movement in Russia, 
Andrey Kozyrev said he did not see Yegor Gaydar's resignation as 
a necessity, and had strong doubts on this score. "I respect 
personal motives, including Gaydar's political ones. Everyone 
may make some long-term tactical and strategic moves, but from 
the point of view of the post-election correlation of forces in 
Russia and prospects for the democratic movement I think he 
should have tried and worked in the government for some more 
time and thus affirm his own viewpoint," Kozyrev said. 
According to him, Gaydar should not have "weakened his 
democratic potential in the public eyes, especially after the 
relative defeat in the elections. According to the minister, 
resignations cannot help strengthen the democratic movement. 
  Kozyrev stressed that he had sought to help resolve the 
problem by meeting President Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and Yegor Gaydar last Monday on his own initiative 
as a mediator. He found it strange that Gaydar left the reform 
team which is effectively headed by Yeltsin. Differences have 
occurred among other ministers on the presidential team, and it 
is not always difficult to hold one's own but the president is a 
uniting force and a guarantor of the reformist character of all 
changes, he said. Kozyrev pointed out that temporary setbacks 
were possible, but on the whole it was possible to achieve 
corrections and stand one's ground. He said it was not 
advisable to transfer acute questions to the sphere of public 
and political polemics, but resolve them within the team 
instead, just as it was and is being done all the time. 
  Nonetheless, what has been done has been done, and it might 
somehow stimulate the democrats to re-align forces and draw 
"very serious conclusions" collectively. It is easier to resign 
from the government than to make it clear to oneself and society 
what had really happened in the elections and how we are going 
to carry on reforms in a democratic and not an authoritarian 
way. "The version of reforms which relied on, and even exploited 
the president's popularity and mandate is exhausted," he said. 
Reformers, who are also democrats, claim, as they do here now, 
a political role for himself and politicize their activity. But 
for this they must get a popular mandate in the elections on 
their own. The past elections did not give them a mandate which 
could justify their claim to domination in the government. This 
means they have to learn their lessons and think about the 
following elections. "I hope the present situation will prompt 
not only dramatic resignations but also substantial 
self-analysis," Kozyrev said.

  [Text] Moscow has rejected a report that Russia has 
participated in DPRK's nuclear weapons development project. 
  (Walentina Korikayev), commentator of this broadcasting 
station, wrote as follows: The Press and Information Bureau 
under the Russian Defense Ministry distributed a written 
refutation. The Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN has spread a 
groundless rumor. 
  The weekly said that the Center for Military Strategic 
Analysis at the Russian General Staff under the Russian Defense 
Ministry prepared the secret report that 160 Russian scholars 
participated in the DPRK's nuclear program and manufactured 
nuclear warheads. 
  The report also said that Nodong No. 1 -- the medium-range 
missile for delivery of such warheads -- was manufactured with 
participation of Russian experts. 
  According to a statement of the Russian Defense Ministry, 
there is no center for military strategic analysis in the 
Defense Ministry. There is a research institute for military 
strategy that belongs to the General Staff. However, the 
institute has never made such a report. Precisely, everything in 
the report is false, so one could conclude that the report from 
Japan is false. Information related to military affairs has 
been continually distorted. 
  For example, a rumor is circulating that Russia is 
attempting 
to repay loans to the ROK with military technology. The press in 
Seoul is spreading such a rumor. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that it has no official 
document stipulating that Russia is going to sell ultramodern 
weapons and to produce them jointly. Russia has no contract to 
pay loans with military technology. 
  People think that someone is attempting to drag Russia into 
complex conditions on the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Denial" column: "North </F>
Korea Has No Nuclear Bomb. The Publication in SHUKAN BUNSHUN Is 
Based on a Hoax. There Will Be No Official Investigation in the 
General Staff"] 
  [Text] The Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN recently printed 
excerpts from a top secret memorandum by the Center for Military 
Strategic Analysis at the Russian General Staff, "The Russian 
Federation Military Policy in the Asia-Pacific Region Under the 
New Military Political Conditions." The document makes clear 
that at the end of the 80's Russia was actively assisting the 
DPRK in creating a nuclear missile capability, and as a result, 
now Pyongyang has several nuclear warheads, as well as a 
considerable number of medium-range missiles. The document is 
dated 22 October 1993 and was to be presented first to General 
Grachev and then to President Yeltsin. The Japanese weekly 
obtained the memorandum from an anonymous officer at the General 
Staff who also commented on it. 
  On 27 January IZVESTIYA printed an account of the SHUKAN 
BUNSHUN publication written by its Tokyo correspondent Sergey 
Agafonov, who added his comment that "there are no doubts about 
the authenticity of the document" because it is printed on a 
Defense Ministry form and has registration number 001 CM-137. 
  General Staff chief General Mikhail Kolesnikov told 
SEGODNYA's correspondent that "there has never been a Center for 
Military Strategic Analysis at the Russian General Staff." The 
General Staff has a center for military strategic studies but 
its functions do not include analysis of the military, 
military-technical or military- industrial potential of foreign 
countries. That is the jurisdiction of various structures in 
the General Staff's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU GSh). 
  The relevant Russian bodies are surely watching the 
developments on the Korean Peninsula. General Kolesnikov said 
that "according to information in our possession, today there 
are no nuclear weapons in the DPRK. Nor are there any 
medium-range missiles. The creation of nuclear missiles in the 
DPRK any time soon is unlikely." 
  The memorandum published in SHUKAN BUNSHUN, which says 
something quite different, was indeed printed on a Defense 
Ministry form, but this kind of form is usually used to respond 
to citizens' letters, not to report to the defense minister or 
the president. The index showing that the document is "top 
secret" (not "absolutely secret," as is stated in Agafonov's 
article) has been placed other than where it should be. The 
serial number CM-137 stamped on the memorandum (apparently the 
main evidence of its authenticity) belongs not to the Defense 
Ministry but to the former USSR Council of Ministers and 
naturally has not been used in correspondence since 1991. 
  After an additional in-house inquiry the General Staff made 
sure that such a document has not been worked out in any of its 
structures and therefore it was not reported to General Grachev 
or President Yeltsin. The General Staff chief is not going to 
conduct any official investigation into the origin of this hoax. 
  General Kolesnikov expressed his surprise at the 
unscrupulousness of SHUKAN BUNSHUN and IZVESTIYA. True, many 
Moscow journalists (and not only journalists) know that 
representatives of the Japanese press (unlike, for instance, the 
Americans) willingly and generously pay for exclusive 
information and have a special liking for various "documents." 
Which is exploited by our "specialists."

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "Russian Chief of General Staff </F>
Describes Piece in Japanese Weekly as `Nonsense'"] 
  [Text] Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, Russian Armed 
Forces chief of general staff, described in conversation with 
your correspondent a secret report published in the Japanese 
weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN and entitled "Russian Federation Military 
Policy in the Asian-Pacific Region in the New Military-Political 
Conditions" (IZVESTIYA No. 16) as "utter nonsense from beginning 
to end." 
  "The references to General Staff issue numbers, the 
publication date of the document, and the Defense Ministry form 
are not valid," the general said, "and only a very gullible and 
incompetent person could be taken in by them, not a 
professional." 
  "I have before me," Kolesnikov said, "a list of all the 
Russian General Staff and Defense Ministry index numbers we put 
on our working documents. Those named by the weekly are not on 
it. The letters "SM" were part of the old USSR Council of 
Ministers index nunmber, but it was abolished in 1991, and I do 
not know what these letters mean now. As for the Defense 
Ministry form, it is clearly a forgery. The form is no big 
secret, so the document could have been easily put together on a 
computer or photocopied. At the same time, Kolesnikov said, our 
documents are not stamped "top secret." But perhaps this is not 
a very accurate translation. Furthermore: Under the general 
staff there is no Military-Strategic Analysis Center, which 
allegedly prepared the "report." 
  But the most important thing is the lies in the body of the 
report. "I cannot say anything about the scientists, since we 
do not keep track of where they go and why, it is not our 
concern and not our headache," Kolesnikov said, "but the claim 
that Pyongyang has one or two nuclear warheads and several more 
will come off the conveyor belt by the end of this year is total 
rubbish. I can definitely say that the DPRK does not have any 
of this. Neither does it have the mythical missiles such as 
Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 and several hundred other nuclear warhead 
delivery vehicles." 
  Incidentally, the Russian chief of general staff said, we 
received several South Korean military delegations last year. 
They talked of their anxiety about DPRK military might, about 
their suspicions that it was working on something, but there was 
no mention of the "facts" presented by the Japanese weekly in 
any discussion with serious-minded people. Evidently they knew 
that they did not exist. 
  I feel sorry for the Japanese journalists and their 
publication, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov said. Perhaps 
they were simply taken in by the forgery when it was slipped 
under their door. But such, it seems, is the public state of 
mind in Japan that they will believe any claptrap about Russia, 
its General Staff, and Armed forces. A pity.

<F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report followed by editorial note: "...And </F>
the Japanese Weekly Has Other Documents in Store"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- Following the publication in the Japanese 
magazine SHUKAN BUNSHUN of excerpts from a secret report by the 
Russian General Staff and comments on it by a very informed 
figure under the pseudonym "leader" (see IZVESTIYA No. 16 from 
27 January 1994), the topic of "the Russian version of the North 
Korean nuclear program" continues to occupy center stage. 
  It turns out that calculations made by the Russian military 
differ somewhat from reports by the U.S. special services, 
particularly over the issue of assessing the level of inaccuracy 
involved when Pyongyang tested the North Korean missile 
"Nodong-1" last May. The Pentagon and the CIA note that the 
effectiveness of the North Korean missile is insignificant in 
combat terms, and it can be "several kilometers" wide of its 
target. Meanwhile in the notes which have been obtained by the 
Japanese press, the Russian special services cite other 
indicators -- according to the Russian version, "Nodong-1" was 
only 100-200 meters wide of its target, which is clearly 
adequate for performing combat tasks using a 1-2 megatonne 
warhead and a flight velocity of Mach 9. In addition to this 
significant detail, specialists are also studying other curious 
nuances regarding this matter while noting that the material 
obtained by SHUKAN BUNSHUN in Moscow deserves to be looked at in 
great detail. 
  In this connection it makes sense to note that Akira Kato, 
the author of the article that has caused such a storm, does not 
work at the weekly and is a "free lance" by profession, untied 
to any one publication. He speaks Russian, is well known for 
his numerous pieces on Russia, and frequently travels to our 
country. I managed to locate the person from SHUKAN BUNSHUN who 
edited the General Staff material, sent it off for typesetting, 
and checked the authenticity of the facts. This was Mr. Kimata. 
  According to him, the authenticity of the Russian report, 
which comprises 36 pages of closely written text, is beyond 
doubt; he also has a tape-recorded interview with the "leader" 
and a number of other documents which for the time being are 
"off limits." Needless to say, the editorial office refused to 
identify the "leader," although it indirectly confirmed that 
this person occupies an official position in a top department 
and is a military officer. The weekly also has in its 
possession other material on this extremely explosive issue 
which it is preparing for publication. 
  In a telephone conversation with your IZVESTIYA 
correspondent, the author of the article also refused to 
disclose his sources of information in the Russian General 
Staff, but he confirmed that his meetings and conversations with 
servicemen in Moscow were deadly serious and that a detailed 
transcript has been made of all the facts which he gathered in 
the Russian capital. 
  From the Editorial Office. Neither today nor in its previous 
edition did IZVESTIYA claim that the report in the Japanese 
weekly was 100 percent truthful. In our view, this is not the 
most important point. It is clear that a Japanese journalist 
working on his own would not have been able to manufacture such 
a "bombshell" and that he was helped to do so by Russian 
sources. It is still unclear which ones precisely.

  [Text] Vatican City January 28 TASS -- Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today visited the Vatican and had a 
meeting with Pope John Paul II. 
  They had a one-on-one conversation in the papal library. 
Instead of 30 minutes envisaged by the protocol, the 
conversation lasted for about an hour. Chernomyrdin told 
reporters that the meeting was extremely effective and cordial. 
Pope John Paul II remarked in Russian that this could not have 
been otherwise as this is the first time a head of the Russian 
government is received in the Vatican. 
  Later Chernomyrdin met with State Secretary Cardinal Angelo 
Sodano. A guard of honour of Swiss guards salutted the 
distinguished guest in the ceremonial hall of the Apostolic 
palace.

  [Text] Rome, 28 Jan -- Today Viktor Chernomyrdin, the 
chairman of the Russian Government who is paying an official 
visit to Italy, met with Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the president of 
the Republic. During the meeting in the Quirinale Palace he said 
that Russia considers Italy as its priority and reliable partner 
on the European continent. This was reported by a well-informed 
source in the Russian delegation after the meeting. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that the confidence of contacts 
between the leaders of the two countries has risen which allows 
them to introduce new elements of partnership and to attach more 
dynamism to Russian-Italian ties. He also said that Moscow 
attaches big importance to a forthcoming visit by Boris Yeltsin, 
president of Russia, to Italy in July 1994 in connection with 
his participation in a G-7 meeting in Naples. 
  Speaking about the bilateral economic ties the Russian 
premier said that the government of the Russian Federation 
intends to undertake maximum efforts to creat a favorable 
climate for foreign investors among whom, he believes, Italian 
partners are, as before, in the forefront. During the meeting 
he spoke out for extending cultural ties between the two 
countries and for improving their contractual basis. Viktor 
Chernomyrdin expressed his gratitude to the Italian people for 
supporting Russian reforms in this difficult time. 
  Today, Viktor Chernomyrdin also met with representatives of 
Italian business circles in Rome. In the headquarters of ENI 
[Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi], a major Italian state fuel 
concern, the Russian Premier replied to journalists' questions. 
He expressed the hope that fruitful Russian-Italian economic 
cooperation will "serve to step up the pace of reforms in 
Russia." Viktor Chernomydin also reported that several other 
projects were discussed today besides the recent Gazprom-ENI 
contract, which he considers to be "the contract of the century 
in terms of its significance for Russia and Italy." "We would 
very much like ENI to step up its work not only in the oil and 
gas sphere, but also in such spheres as chemicals and foodstuff 
production. The task which I set during this meeting will stir 
the management of the company to further cooperation, the 
development of which should not be delayed any longer," he said. 
The joint development of oil and gas fields in the Barents Sea 
and on Yamal were among the projects which Viktor Chernomyrdin 
said were discussed today.

  [Text] Answering a question from a "Vesti" correspondent on 
whether the resignation of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov 
affects Russia's relations with its Italian partners, the 
Russian prime minister, who is on an official visit to Italy, 
had the following to say: 
  [Chernomyrdin] Absolutely no change whatsoever; I feel 
absolutely none. I think that we have normal relations. 
Serious people understand that the departure of one person or 
another has no significance since it is not just one person, or 
even two people, who implement the policy and do the work but 
the entire government. We have the president, the guarantor, and 
if we even move away we have someone to put things right. This 
will not affect our affairs, absolutely not. It is not just 
those two who worked. Everyone carries out his duties. The 
government does not consist just of two people. They had their 
own specific, narrow responsibilities.

<F P=106> [Yelena Ovcharenko commentary: "Is the CIA Still Vigilant?] </F>
  [Text] Today, the CIA is waging its main secret wars not 
in some faraway backwater of the planet but in the halls of the 
U.S. Congress, where its director, James Woolsey, is making 
colossal efforts to defend his department's coffers against 
legislators unhappy about huge expenditure. 
  On Tuesday [25 January] he addressed the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence where, among other things, he named 
four areas of Russian problems under close surveillance by U.S. 
espionage departments. 
  First of all, intelligence will continue to provide American 
politicians with "important, and sometimes unique political and 
economic analytical materials warning of the potential dangers 
which may lie in store for Russia in future." What is more, the 
spy chief even promised to help the legislators get to grips 
with all aspects of the Russian economy. Personally, I envy 
him: It takes a very lucid mind to trace the logic in our 
hopelessly confused system! 
  Second, American intelligence intends to observe closely 
"the 
location and condition of Russia's 27,000 nuclear warheads" for 
the next 10 years at least. In particular, the CIA is fearful 
that these items, which are best "handled with care," may prove 
irresistible to the mafia and third countries striving to 
acquire nuclear materials, or that they may become dangerous in 
the hands of a demoralized, morally depressed Russian military. 
  It is interesting that the American spies listed among their 
priorities activities to monitor the condition of Russia's 
"general purpose" Armed Forces. Director Woolsey, it seems, is 
dismayed that "the military in Russia are not protected against 
the uncertainties and problems connected with the economic, 
political, and social transformation of the country." Of 
course, it is not a question of oversentimentality on the part 
of colleagues from the power structures, although it is very 
probable that even American spies find it hard to believe their 
eyes when they delve into the problems of our homeless, 
vulnerable, morally violated "tough guys" -- from impudently 
arrested generals to defenseless border guards. 
  The fourth aspect is Russia's relations with its neighbors, 
the new independent states. According to the intelligence 
services, a crisis can be expected in any one of these spots. 
  ...Indeed, there are very few savings to be made on Russia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS observer Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 January -- A programme of military 
cooperation between NATO and the Russian Defense Ministry for 
the current year was signed in Moscow today. It includes mutual 
visits by the highest command corps and military experts, joint 
exercises and training, and the seconding of Russian officers to 
units and training establishments in NATO countries--some 50 
measures in all. 
  An ITAR-TASS observer was told at the Russian Defense 
Ministry that the problems involved in settling the crisis 
situations in CIS flashpoints were discussed during a two-day 
visit by a delegation from the North Atlantic alliance. Mutual 
understanding was found with regard to many crucial problems. 
NATO's military structure is ready to provide help to the 
peacekeeping forces of Russia and the Commonwealth countries, 
specifically regarding the training of specialists who are to 
work as observers in regions of interethnic conflict. In the 
opinion of NATO representatives, it is not a matter of the 
participation of the organization's military subunits in 
settling the conflicts on the fringes of the former Soviet 
Union. Just the exchange of experience and help with 
specialists, they think. But "rear support" is not denied -- 
specifically, with communications and observation means. 
According to NATO officers, their organization cannot operate 
outside the community without a UN mandate. 
  At the same time, representatives of the North Atlantic 
alliance think that it is only under UN auspices that Russian 
peacekeeping forces too should operate in the CIS' flashpoints. 
This, in their view, would give rise to greater trust in them, 
specifically, in Tajikistan.

Mutual understanding was reached on many problems. But no

  [Text] Belgorod (Russia), 28 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- A meeting 
of leaders of the border oblasts of Russia and Ukraine ended in 
Belgorod today with the adoption of a package of documents 
setting out the principles of economic and scientific-technical 
cooperation between the 10 border oblasts of Russia and Ukraine. 
  Participants unanimously spoke in favor of creating an 
economic cooperation zone, granting their territories special 
status, and instituting direct financial accounting between 
enterprises in the border oblasts of Russia and Ukraine. 
  The adoption of the statutes of the council of the leaders 
of 
border oblasts of Russia and Ukraine was a concrete expression 
of the coordinated approach by the Russian and Ukrainian sides. 
A permanent working body -- the council's executive committee 
-- was set up to coordinate cooperation between the regions. 
  Participants appealed to the presidents of Russia and 
Ukraine 
to conclude an intergovernmental agreement between the two 
countries and to adopt the necessary legislative acts in the 
shortest possible time.

  [Text] A senior Russian Defence Ministry official believes 
that the Ukrainian military department's latest steps can wreck 
the Russo-American-Ukrainian agreements signed in Moscow on 
January 14. The accords aim at scrapping the nuclear weapons 
deployed in Ukraine. 
  A Russian military spokesman has told Interfax that 
Ukraine's 
Defence Ministry has warned the strategic missile forces 
personnel that the officers refusing to swear allegiance to 
Ukraine will be dismissed. 
  The spokesman described these Ukrainian actions as the start 
of a seizure of strategic nuclear weapons. He stressed that in 
these conditions the Russian military could not bear 
responsibility for the nuclear ammunition's control and service. 
He did not rule out that pressed by Kiev, quite a few missile 
forces officers would have to leave Ukraine with "unpredictable 
consequences." 
  He is convinced that the fate of the nuclear weapons in 
Ukraine must concern primarily Kiev and western countries. "The 
loss of proper control over nuclear weapons may be disastrous", 
he stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Dolinin, KRASNAYA </F>
ZVEZDA correspondent on Strategic Missile Forces: "43d Missile 
Army Being Destroyed. Alarm Over Nuclear Weapons in Ukraine 
Growing"] 
  [Text] As a result of persistent efforts by Russian, U.S., 
and Ukrainian politicians and diplomats, a trilateral agreement 
was concluded 14 January this year and the Moscow Declaration on 
Implementing the START I Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol was 
signed. It appears that the future of nuclear missile weapons 
in Ukraine, which has caused so much concern in the world, had 
been settled in such a way as to suit everyone's interests, 
primarily Kiev's. The Russian side declared its willingness to 
proceed to practical implementation of the agreements that had 
been reached. There was every reason to assume that the 
Ukrainian Ministry of Defense thought likewise, which was 
evidenced by the Ukrainian military's proposal to hold talks in 
order to coordinate a plan for shipping nuclear weapons 
[boyepripasy] to Russian territory. 
  However, literally 10 days later, the Ukrainian defense 
minister issued an order on transporting the weapons to their 
"S" installations. And at a Ministry of Defense Collegium 
session 21 January, the commander of the 43d Missile Army and 
the commander of the 46th Division were forced to swear an oath 
of allegiance to Ukraine. 
  This unilateral step constituted a gross violation of all 
the 
understandings that had been reached earlier, including the 
Agreement on the Status of Strategic Nuclear Forces signed by 
the heads of the CIS in February 1992. 
  If the troops of the 43d Missile Army start taking an oath 
of 
allegiance to Ukraine, Ukraine's objective of gaining full 
control over the nuclear forces located on its territory will be 
all but realized. In conditions in which Ukraine proclaims the 
principle of nonuse of nuclear weapons from its territory, the 
fact that the command of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces 
retains combat control is a formality. 
  Were these steps by the Ukrainian side unexpected? A 
chronology of the events of the past two years rules this out. 
  -- Back on 5 April 1992 the Ukrainian president issued an 
edict subordinating all military formations located on Ukrainian 
territory, including strategic nuclear forces, to the Ukrainian 
Ministry of Defense. Despite the CIS countries' agreement that 
they would include them in unified strategic forces under a 
unified command. This edict gave instructions to organize 
administrative control of the Ukrainian Strategic Nuclear Forces. 
  -- Three weeks later the defense minister issued his own 
edict announcing the organization of administrative control of 
strategic forces. The Administrative Control Center was set up. 
  -- During 1992 troops at Air Force missile supply technical 
bases and "S" installations were made to swear an oath of 
allegiance to Ukraine. In practice this led to a decline in 
their combat readiness, because a large number of officers 
refused to take the oath. A group was formed of the remaining 
specialists which was practically incapable of working with 
nuclear weapons. This was the conclusion drawn by the Ukrainian 
side itself. 
  -- In summer 1992, under a directive from the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces General Staff, "S" installations, which were 
formerly under the exclusive command of the Russian Ministry of 
Defense Main Directorate, were amalgamated with the 43d Missile 
Army and subordinated to its commander with instructions to make 
them ready for combat use. It should be noted that this is not 
the function of the Army and Strategic Missile Forces, and they 
do not have the resources to administer "S" installations. 
  Politicians and servicemen alike looked for a way out of the 
situation that had developed. Everyone realized that nuclear 
security is no joking matter, and neither are missiles. On 3 
September 1993 agreements were concluded in Yalta, including 
agreements on recycling nuclear weapons and warranty inspection 
(the latter was to have come into force immediately, from the 
moment of signing), but a note from the Ukrainian Foreign 
Ministry stated that it refused to implement these important 
agreements. Their ratification was linked to a resolution of the 
tactical nuclear weapons issue. 
  As a consequence of the note issued by the Ukrainian Foreign 
Ministry, instructions were given to suspend the freedom of 
movement of weapons and technology with a view to carrying out 
maintenance and technical servicing of ICBM groupings as a 
whole. Troops of the 43d Missile Army were barred from executing 
directives issued by the Strategic Missile Forces Main Command 
without the consent of the Ukrainian Administrative Control 
Center, otherwise criminal proceedings could be instituted. 
This threatening order, incidentally, contradicted the 
Ukrainian president's edict on preserving the functions of 
operational control exercised by the Strategic Missile Forces 
command. The principal danger of interference in operational 
control is that personal responsibility for nuclear missile 
weapons has been destroyed. 
  ...On 19 November 1993 the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
ratified 
the START I Treaty with the stipulation that, together with the 
Lisbon Protocol to the treaty which Ukraine had signed, it is 
becoming impossible to implement the treaty. Ukraine thus 
directly proclaimed itself the owner of its nuclear weapons. 
  And now the servicemen of the 43d Army are being asked to 
swear an oath of allegiance to Ukraine. 
  What does this last step mean? The Strategic Missile Forces 
High Command believes that, with the adoption of the Ukrainian 
oath, the Strategic Missile Forces will completely forfeit the 
potential to operationally administer the 43d Army. Ukraine is 
left alone with its nuclear weapons. Whereas missile troops in 
Russia and Ukraine used to be united by a single oath and used 
to ensure the proper level of combat alert status and 
maintenance of missile weapons despite all the hardships and 
difficulties, and whereas they used to resolve nuclear security 
questions jointly, now all this has been ruled out. Ukraine is 
in the most danger. 
  Many experienced specialists could quit owing to their 
unwillingness to take the oath. Quite recently KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
reported that one-third of officers have already expressed a 
desire to serve in Russia. Current forecasts show that this 
number is growing. Specialists stress that if officer strength 
level in missile units were to fall to 60 percent, they will 
become unfit for combat. 
  This raises the fear that the system of combat alert status 
and maintenance of hardware and weapons will be disrupted. The 
situation that has developed will not only prevent us from 
implementing the agreement with Ukraine on further removal of 
missile regiments from combat alert status, but will also hamper 
efforts to ensure that missiles are kept in safe state. Today a 
number of missiles on alert status are irreparable. It is 
impossible to repair them, the maintenance details do not even 
have enough fuel to travel to the launch site. 
  But something else is more frightening still: All guarantees 
of nuclear security are being discarded. Stanislav Voronin, 
chief designer of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, who visited 
the Pervomaysk division recently, noted that owing to political 
ambitions, an unwillingness to accept assistance, and an 
inability to cope with problems on their own, "gross violations 
of the most elementary rules and norms for dealing with nuclear 
weapons are evident." What amounts to the removal of 
specialists on the basis of the Ukrainian oath could, not to put 
too fine a point on it, lead to a disaster even worse than 
Chernobyl. Approximately 500 nuclear weapons are stockpiled in 
storage facilities, which is six to eight times above the norm. 
  ...Overnight Ukraine has destroyed everything that was 
achieved recently in Moscow. The requirement that missile 
troops have to swear an oath of allegiance is destroying the 43d 
Army. Once again there is alarm about the future of nuclear 
missile weapons in Ukraine.

  [Text] Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy 
Adamishin told INTERFAX Friday that he had received no official 
information on the statement of the Kazakh ambassador in Tehran 
concerning the republic's intention to decide on the future of 
nuclear weapons on Kazakh territory independently. 
  "Primarily it is necessary to make sure that the information 
is correct and that it reflects the position of the Kazakh 
Government and President Nursultan Nazarbayev," the minister's 
first deputy (who accompanies Russian Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin during his official visit to Italy) emphasized. 
  "We have the kind of relations with Kazakhstan which allows 
us to resolve our issues without mediation of ambassadors to 
other states," Adamishin pointed out. 
  The premier's press secretary Anatoliy Sergeyev also 
confirmed that the Russian premier currently in Rome had 
received no official information on the Kazakh ambassador's 
statement.

<F P=106> ["a.u."-signed report: "Kozyrev Letter to Mock: Warning to </F>
Latvia"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- In a letter to Foreign Minister Mock -- 
which will be received by all other European foreign ministers 
-- Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev intensified his warnings 
against Latvia. He predicted "consequences that are difficult to 
foresee" if Riga does not change its policy vis-a-vis the 
Russian minority in the country. 
  Kozyrev's intervention was caused by a new election law in 
Latvia that deprives the strong Russian minority of its right to 
vote in local elections. According to Kozyrev, about a third of 
Latvia's population is affected by this rule. 
  "Thus, political rightlessness is turned into law," Kozyrev 
complained. He warned against the "fatal consequences of 
aggressive nationalism." Strong warnings were expressed in 
several passages: Political extremism might lead "to a 
confrontation between Latvia and its neighboring states." 
Russia is Latvia's neighbor. 
  Within the framework of international law, Russia will do 
"everything possible to ensure the protection of the rights of 
ethnic Russians in Latvia," the minister stressed. Latvia is to 
blame for the difficulties. Its policy aimed at driving out the 
country's population that belongs to another ethnic group and 
its efforts to create a state with a single ethnic group may 
lead to "consequences that are difficult to foresee." 
  Kozyrev demands -- he apparently considers this the last 
opportunity -- that the international organizations raise their 
voices. The "mechanism of preventive democracy" must be 
initiated. 
  The majority of the Russian minority moved to Latvia in the 
past 50 years where living conditions were more agreeable than 
in the rest of the Soviet Union. In the period between the 
wars, the Baltic states were independent. Before that, they had 
been part of the Tsarist realm for a long time. Russian troops 
continue to be deployed in Latvia.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan 28, BNS -- Complying with Estonia's 
request, the Russian delegation will during the next round of 
negotiations Feb. 1-2 present a detailed timetable for the 
withdrawal of its troops from Estonia, Vasiliy Svirin, Russia's 
top negotiator, told BNS. 
  The timetable includes full information about when one or 
another unit leaves Estonia and the number of men in it. "We 
hope that this step of Russia's to meet Estonia's wishes 
inspires also the Estonian delegation to take constructive steps 
to meet us halfway," Svirin said. As reported earlier, a 
general schedule for troop withdrawal was presented to Estonia 
during the last round of talks late in 1993. 
  Svirin said that Estonia has recently been hinting at its 
wish to replace a comprehensive agreement on the troop 
withdrawal and the conditions for their temporary stay in 
Estonia with a short protocol containing only the date for the 
completion of the pullout with the timetable as an appendix to 
it. He emphasized that Russia has clearly stated it considers 
this approach absolutely unacceptable. Svirin explained that it 
would leave unresolved a wide range of problems concerning the 
pullout and the stay in Estonia of the troops, and the fate of 
the army's immovable property, which would only lead to 
deterioration of bilateral relations. 
  Commenting on Vaino Reinart's appointment as the head of the 
Estonian delegation for talks with Russia, Svirin said the 
Russian side accepted it favorably, with full understanding and 
readiness to continue constructive cooperation. 
  As to Russia's "ostensible concern" about Russians living in 
Estonia, Svirin said "we've heard it before." He referred to 
Reinart's Jan. 20 statement at a Council of Europe deputy 
ministers' meeting in Strasbourg when Reinart charged that 
Russia's accusations of human rights violations in the Baltic 
states stem, not from genuine concern about human rights, but 
from Russia's domestic political situation. "We regard such 
statements as carefully thought out speculations of some 
Estonian politicians," Svirin said.

  [Text] Moscow January 29 TASS--Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vitaliy Churkin sent ITAR-TASS on Saturday [29 January] 
his commentary on U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's 
report to the U.N. Security Council concerning the situation in 
the two safe havens in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "Specifically, it has been proposed to open Tuzla airport 
for 
humanitarian supplies and replace the Canadian battalion in 
Srebrenica with a Dutch one. We are currently studying the 
report very carefully. At first sight, some corrections may 
have to be made. 
  "However, already now we can say definitely that Russia's 
position in favour of a balanced and calm resolution of all 
questions has been reflected in the report. It rules out hasty 
actions. The main accent has been made on reaching an agreement 
between the U.N. and the warring factions. 
  "Such approach has already proven successful in Srebrenica. 
The report expresses the hope that by the end of February the 
replacement of the Canadian battalion will be successfully 
completed. As far as Tuzla is concerned, a representative of 
the U.N. secretary-general in former Yugoslavia will hold talks 
with the Serbian and Moslem sides next week. We call for 
constructiveness and believe that the necessary guarantees may 
be provided to prevent the use of Tuzla airport for delivering 
military supplies, which is a subject of concern of the Serbian 
side. 
  "There is no question of delivering any `air strikes' in 
order to `punish' one of the warring sides in Bosnia," Churkin 
said.

  [Text] Madrid, 28 Jan -- The Tatarstan Government 
delegation led by the Mintimer Shaymiyev, the president of the 
republic, has ended its visit to Spain. The delegation was here 
at an invitation of the regional autonomous government of 
Madrid, the Chamber of Trade and Commerce, and Spanish business 
circles showing high interest in developing cooperation with 
Kazan. 
  At a news conference here, Mintimer Shaymiyev noted that 
"the 
results of the meetings and talks in Madrid have exceeded all 
our hopes." In the course of the visit a whole range of 
agreements on development of bilateral economic cooperation, as 
well as on cultural and information exchanges were signed. 
  Answering the question on Tatarstan's relations with the 
Russian central government, the president, in particular, said: 
"At the moment, we are finalizing our work on establishing 
relations between Russia and Tatarstan on the basis of a series 
of agreements. I have recently met with Boris Yeltsin and Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and I hope that in February we can 
even sign the treaty on the division and delegation of powers. 
On 13 March elections will be held in Tatarstan to the Russian 
Federal Assembly where our republic is not represented at the 
moment." "We always had and still enjoy a high level of mutual 
understanding with President Yeltsin and this will guarantee 
successful solution of the disputed issues and stability of our 
relations, as well as continuation of the democratization 
process in Russia," stressed the president of Tatarstan.

<F P=106> [Marina Lebedeva report: "United Nations To Help Russia </F>
Solve Refugee Problem"] 
  [Text] This was stated at a press conference held at the 
International Press Center by Juan Amunategi, the first 
accredited representative in Russia of the UNHCR. 
  He announced that, according to UNHCR figures, there are a 
total of 20 million forced migrants and 19 million refugees in 
the world who have left their countries for various reasons. 
Their fate is complex, they endure terrible trials and risk 
their lives, but as long as persecution and discrimination 
persist a refugee problem will be inevitable. This has been 
confirmed by life -- the UNHCR was set up in 1951 for just three 
years, but still exists today. It has already solved problems 
for 13 million refugees and has twice been awarded the Nobel 
Peace Prize -- in 1954 and 1981. 
  Speaking about the situation in Russia, the UN 
representative 
noted that the refugee problem is still a new one for this 
country. Until recently the former Soviet Union was aware of 
just one "sort" of refugees -- Communists who had fled from 
their own countries and were accepted by the USSR for 
exclusively political reasons. This happened following the 
Spanish Civil War and the Chilean coup. It was only after 
perestroyka and the collapse of the Union that the top Russian 
authorities joined the world community, which deals with refugee 
issues in humanitarian terms, in terms of the protection of 
their rights. 
  Juan Amunategi drew attention to the fact that, despite 
recognizing international documents and despite its own laws on 
refugees and forced migrants, Russia is often incapable of 
meeting its own commitments, because its economic position is 
failing to improve. 
  In this connection, the UN representative noted, the 
Commission considered it necessary to give Russia all the 
assistance it could in solving this complex problem. This 
assistance will be implemented in six areas. Juan Amunategi 
said that priority should go to the defense of refugees' rights 
and to aid to the country's government in creating institutions 
and organs capable of skillfully tackling the problem. 
  Amunategi also noted that the law on refugees envisages the 
creation of transit camps for them. Four such camps already 
exist near Moscow, currently housing around 1,000 refugees. It 
is planned to give them material aid. 
  One other important area is to curb emigration -- in 
particular, by informing citizens planning to leave their own 
countries and come to Russia of the real living conditions 
facing refugees. Conditions should be created for arriving 
refugees to integrate into the local community -- this will 
benefit not only the refugees but the locals.

  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- A regular (second) session 
of the Federation Council is to open here on Monday. 
  The agenda of the session of the upper chamber of Russia's 
parliament tackles some organizational issues which were left 
undecided at the first session, including the elections of a 
third deputy chairman of the Council of Federation and 
chairpersons of four committees (the leaders of six other 
committees have already been elected), adoption of the 
regulations of the Federation Council and several other 
documents. 
  The upper chamber is also to consider several presidential 
decrees which cannot come into force without its approval. 
  These include President Yeltsin's decree on prolongation of 
a 
state of emergency in the southern Republics of Ingushetia and 
Northern Ossetia which is likely to top the list. 
  The Federation Council will also consider the social and 
economic situation in the Russian Federation, Vladimir Shumeyko, 
chairman of the Federation Council, told a recent press 
conference. 
  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is expected to 
report on the issue at an early date. Afterwards the prime 
minister and the deputies who include many heads of local 
administrations and presidents of Russia's republics, will 
discuss the 1994 budget of the Russian Federation, Shumeyko said. 
  The discussion will precede an extended session of the 
government on the issue and therefore should enable, in 
Shumeyko's opinion, the State Duma to adopt a draft budget to be 
worked out by the cabinet as soon as possible. 
  According to Shumeyko, he has coordinated the lawmaking 
activities of the two chambers with Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the 
State Duma. (The Russian Constitution has it that the Federation 
Council has to decide on the bills adopted by the State Duma 
within 14 days). 
  There is no indication so far that the State Duma will take 
a 
non-constructive stand, Shumeyko noted. 
  The sessions of the Federation Council will last, as a rule, 
for a week and then a two-week break will follow, he specified. 
  Only 34 persons will work for the Federation Council on a 
full-time basis, including the chairman and his deputies, 
chairpersons of the committees and their deputies.

  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin is expected to make an 
address on the country's socioconomic development to both 
chambers of parliament on 18 February. Vladimir Shumeyko, 
chairman of the Federation Council, announced this when he 
opened a session of the upper chamber today, Interfax reports. 
Shumeyko also told the deputies that the prime minister's 
report on the formation of the budget for the current year is 
being postponed. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin may decide to amend some points in his 
report in light of the president's address, the chairman of the 
upper chamber explained. The majority of the deputies, however, 
failed to support this idea, and insisted that Viktor 
Chernomyrdin should speak this very week. According to the 
decision adopted, the head of government must brief the deputies 
on the cabinet's plans for the financial, taxation, budget, 
agrarian, and industrial spheres.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report: "A Tidbit of Russian Politics"] </F>
  [Text] The committee on CIS affairs, created in the Duma, 
has become a new phenomenon in Russian politics. Talk to the 
effect that Russia's foreign policy should be divided into 
"distant" and "close" has been going on for quite some time now. 
The absence of a corresponding committee in the Supreme Soviet 
brought about a situation where the leaders of the National 
Salvation Front were dealing directly (and in a rather peculiar 
way) with CIS and Baltic matters in parliament. 
  In the Duma this mistake was happily avoided and the new 
committee has been "assigned" to the PRES [Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord] faction. Apart from the CIS, PRES also was 
placed in charge of committees on regional policy and local 
self-government. According to faction leader Sergey Shakhray, 
PRES intends to occupy all the leading positions in these 
directions, "traditional" for it, both in parliament and in the 
government. But as one can easily see, the promised 
"committee-ministry" linkage in the case of CIS affairs is not 
working out. PRES' wish to monopolize this area of foreign 
policy is hampered by the fact that in the government CIS 
affairs are administered by the Foreign Affairs Ministry. The 
new economy minister and PRES member Aleksandr Shokhin, however, 
is working in the government to have himself placed in charge of 
economic relations with the former USSR republics. But this is 
clearly not enough to coordinate the policy of the government 
and the parliamentary committee. 
  More complications can be expected also from what can mildly 
be described as the painful relation of the Duma 
communo-nationalist majority to CIS problems, the "situation of 
the Russian population," and Russian foreign policy in general. 
A feeler put out by PRES leaders between parliament sessions 
was devoted to what is probably the most acute issue of policy 
with respect to the neighboring countries -- the situation in 
Crimea. Consultations by Konstantin Zatulin, PRES faction 
secretary and chairman of the committee on CIS affairs, with 
Ukrainian officials were held behind the Duma's back, and the 
committee was not called for that purpose because "the majority 
of deputies are currently away in their constituencies." The 
"placating statements" made after that apparently did not 
satisfy the nationalists, who are anxious to seize the peninsula 
from Ukraine. Before the Duma session resumes, hot debates on 
this issue are most likely. Should Yuriy Meshkov be elected 
Crimea's president, the nationalists supporting the leader of 
the Russian opposition during the election campaign will 
inevitably get an advantage. 
  In any event, PRES leaders are to face a conflict with the 
Foreign Affairs Ministry which, as is apparent from Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev's latest statements, does not wish to give up the 
initiative to other Russian politicians in the neighboring 
countries. The ambitions by Vladimir Lukin, chairman of another 
parliamentary committee -- on foreign affairs -- are also aimed 
at curtailing the Foreign Affairs Ministry's powers. Therefore 
the erstwhile allies of Russia's Choice will apparently be 
seeking to take the bloc's existing levers of influencing the 
government course away from it. 
  The experience of the Supreme Soviet shows that the size of 
democratic factions falls in proportion to the growing ambitions 
of their leaders. Foreign policy appears to be an ideal field 
for a clash of these ambitions. Which opportunity the 
communists and nationalists will seize with great pleasure.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets commentary under the "Discipline" rubric: </F>
"`Russia's Choice' Fights Personnel Fluidity. It Will Not Be 
Easy To Secure Democratic Majority"] 
  [Text] The "personnel fluidity" that had worried leaders 
of the Russia's Choice Duma faction even before the new 
parliament went to work seems to have reached critical mass. 
Reconciling themselves to the inevitability of a micro-split, 
Russia's Choice leaders decided to speed up the process 
artificially -- as the Duma resumes its sessions, the faction is 
establishing a "rigid membership," i.e., a ban on crossing over 
to other parliamentary associations. Potential defectors have 
been ordered to make up their mind as to their "propiska" [party 
affiliation] before 1 February. According to Russia's Choice 
functionaries, the current strength of the faction (78 persons) 
is quite sufficient to take care of two or three groups. Most 
probably, the majority of those who leave Russia's Choice will 
follow the example of Andrey Makarov and Boris Fedorov, and 
settle down in the Union of 12 December group. 
  Despite the Russia's Choice statements, they so far are not 
managing to have peaceable relations with the Union of 12 
December. Russia's Choice has hard feelings against the Union 
of 12 December because the latter willingly grants "political 
asylum" to victims of intrigues inside the faction, or simply 
deputies disaffected with some of the leaders. The Union of 12 
December has hard feelings against Russia's Choice because the 
latter supported the "package" agreement on the election of Duma 
leaders and committees whereby it denied the nascent group any 
posts in the parliament. 
  There is also a chance of an organized split, engineered by 
the leaders of Russia's Choice. One more faction would get them 
one more vote in the Duma Council. 
  At any rate, the parent faction is in for a "toughening of 
discipline." Not so long ago the Russia's Choice leaders 
declared: "An identity of opinion is not a must with us; the 
more stances there are, the better." In actual fact it appears 
to be worse. In the future, in the idea of the "rigid 
membership" organizers, the roll-call voting list of Russia's 
Choice will consist, like those of the Communists, Agrarians, 
and Liberal Democrats, of the uniform "for" and "against" column. 
  "We hope for cooperation with the other democratic factions 
and democratic groups of the Duma including the Union of 12 
December, and expect that we will vote in the same manner on 
questions of principle," Kirill Ignatyev, Russia's Choice press 
secretary, told INTERFAX. 
  Russia's Choice members who maintain that they will always 
be 
able to cooperate with "union factions" and secure the required 
one- third of all votes to back the president's veto on any law 
passed by the Duma, may be disappointed. The main danger lying 
in wait for Russia's Choice leaders on the "tough discipline" 
road is the obstinacy of those who would opt for a "St. George's 
Day" ["Yuryev Den" -- in old Russia a day on which serfs were 
free to change masters] and refuse to pay for their upkeep. New 
deputy groups forming in place of Russia's Choice may also not 
back it on some votes. Which would further worsen the situation 
in the none too unified "democratic bloc." 
  For example, a clause-by-clause discussion of the budget may 
result in serious disagreements among the democratic factions 
and groups. Such a question as no-confidence in the government, 
with which Russia's Choice could threaten the premier as long as 
the present cabinet of ministers lasts, may not especially 
enthuse some Democrats. 
  There is also no telling what would be the reaction from the 
unpredictable president, already thought to be unable to engage 
in conflicts with the parliament, to laws passed by the Duma 
majority -- the right of veto may remain uncalled-for. In this 
event attempts to secure the necessary votes to block the work 
of parliament would prove absolutely senseless. The "stagnation 
of reforms," Yegor Gaydar's phrase to describe the present 
situation, would fundamentally be replaced by finally rolling 
them back. 
  In the Duma, one would see Russia's Choice trampled upon by 
the Communist majority which would no longer want compromises 
like the "package" handing out of parliamentary positions. Such 
are the disciplined remnants of the former, already now quite 
modest, greatness.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamin report: "New Deal Has Been Drafted. </F>
President To Decide on Academicians' Program"] 
  [Text] "Russia's Choice," headed by former Deputy Prime 
Minister Yegor Gaydar, has drastically improved its chances to 
become the only State Duma faction to oppose the government. 
Today a group of academicians under Stanislav Shatalin and 
Leonid Abalkin plans to present to the president, the prime 
minister, and chairmen of the Federal Assembly's chambers an 
economic program that is at considerable odds with the financial 
stabilization policy as understood by the IMF (see 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 25 and 26 January). Since this particular 
document is seen by most of the State Duma's political 
associations as a basis for a constructive dialogue with the 
government, "Russia's Choice" (as a matter of fact, together 
with "Yabloko") has been left out of a discussion on the program 
that representatives of other factions scheduled for 2 February. 
  Obviously, Leonid Abalkin's statement about "the corrective 
nature of the proposed recommendations" should not be taken 
literally. In fact the draft program calls for a significant 
departure from the economic principles that were actively 
defended by Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, who came to 
epitomize monetarism in Russia. At the same time, it is too 
early to conclude that the package of measures proposed by the 
academicians means revolutionary changes in the economic policy 
pursued by the government. 
  The program, if adopted by the government, may have much 
greater political significance, however -- joining forces with 
the parliamentary majority on its basis will make the 
Chernomyrdin cabinet the first "government of people's 
confidence" in the past three years. Seen against this 
backdrop, the situation at the Federation Council appears less 
clear than at the State Duma. A lack of party divisions and 
Viktor Chernomyrdin's influence in the upper chamber, however, 
may combine to make the upper chamber just as enthusiastic about 
the prospects for an alliance with the government as the lower 
chamber appears to be. 
  To all appearances, former government members are set to be 
the most consistent opponents of the new draft program. This is 
only understandable: Yegor Gaydar and his loyalists need to 
restore their political authority after their failure in the 
December elections. What "Russia's Choice" sees as the Russian 
economy's inevitable slide toward hyperinflation 
("Ukrainization") gives the political association a chance to 
rehabilitate itself. 
  Representatives of the parliamentary majority have been 
cautiously inferring that Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, for his part, 
will also back the draft so as to offer his version of program 
as a basis of the cabinet's economic policy at the next stage, 
drawing on his current constructive stance. 
  The definitive future of the draft, however, will not be 
decided by the government or the parliament. In the current 
political conditions the last word rests with Boris Yeltsin. 
The stress on the president's "firm" stance with regard to the 
reform course, made by his press secretary, amounted to a signal 
for the key political figures that the president will not balk 
at decisive actions if he happens to be dissatisfied with the 
new balance of forces in the parliament or the government.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ruslan Maisigov] </F>
  [Text] Nazran January 28 TASS -- Ingush President Ruslan 
Aushev on Friday made a request to Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin urgently to replace chief of the interim administration 
in the territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, Vladimir 
Lozovoy who "is incapable of enforcing decrees of the Russian 
president, government and parliament". 
  Aushev believes that the chief of the interim administration 
deliberately thwarted the implementation of the Russian 
president's decree of December 13, 1993 on the procedure of the 
return to places of permanent residence of refugees and enforced 
resettlers in territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia". The 
Ingush president stated in his address that Vladimir Lozovoy 
more than once misled the Russian media, and, moreover, the 
Russian leadership and the Russian president by informing them 
that the return of refugees to places of permanent residence 
began on time and proceeds successfully. The Ingush president 
also noted that Lozovoy's being chief of the interim 
administration does nothing to stabilise the situation in the 
region, leads to its aggravation and to a new interethnic 
conflict. 
  Similar addresses were sent on Friday to Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Chairman of the Federation 
Council Vladimir Shumeyko.

  [Text] There can be no question of reducing Russian 
military presence in the Sakhalin and Kuril islands given that 
Japan's military strength in Hokkaido is ten times bigger, 
Governor of Sakhalin Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov said speaking in an 
interview with the local Sovietskiy Sakhalin newspaper. 
  Up to 10,000 incidents are registered annually of border 
violations and illegal fishing in Russia's economic zone by 
Japanese fishing boats. The latest in a series of similar 
violations took place on January 21 and 22 following illegal 
entry into the Russian territorial waters of Kunashir Island 
(Southern Kurils) by dozens of Japanese trawlers. 
  Commander of the Russian Coast Guard Rear-Admiral Kudinov 
described the action as "planned and coordinated." 
  The Governor of Sakhalin believes that Russia's military 
strength in the Southern Kurils is just what it should be and 
does not upset the regional balance of forces or pose any threat 
to each other's security. He says any diversion will cause 
nothing but an extra source of international tension. 
  Krasnoyarov says that any reduction in Russia's regional 
presence is taken by Japanese poachers as "an invitation to 
dinner." The redeployment of an air force regiment from Iturup 
Island has immediately led to an increase in the number of 
border violations, he said. 
  The same applies to the problem of Russian military presence 
in Sakhalin. The Chief of Staff of the Russian Armed Forces 
does not rule out military cutbacks to save money needed for the 
upkeep of troops deployed in the island. However, the Governor 
says the redeployment of troops in mainland Russia will cost the 
government "a bunch." 
  Krasnoyarov is determined to try to defend his position 
before the Federation Council (Senate) and the government. On 
informing Tokyo about Russia's strength in the Far East, he said 
such openness was possible only on a mutual basis. Any 
unilateral demand of this kind, he said, "is not at all 
acceptable to Russia as a sovereign state".

<F P=106> [Sergey Sopov report: "Mayor of Omsk Discharged. City </F>
Administration Backs Yuriy Shoykhet"] 
  [Text] Omsk Mayor Yuriy Shoykhet, dismissed by a recent 
presidential edict, handed over his powers to his deputy, 
Valeriy Roshchupkin, yesterday. The city administration 
collegium, however, does not agree with Boris Yeltsin's decision 
and intends to demand the creation of a special commission to 
assess objectively the former mayor's work. 
  According to Nikolay Terekhov, head of the information 
center 
under the city administration, the president's edict on Mr. 
Shoykhet's removal caused total bewilderment among the workers 
of the city administration and supporters of democratic reforms 
in Omsk. Yuriy Shoykhet was appointed to the post of mayor by 
Boris Yeltsin in person right on the heels of the 1991 August 
putsch largely because of his reputation as a firm opponent of 
the putschists. 
  The wording of the reasons for the mayor's removal was more 
than sharp. The edict points out that Yuriy Shoykhet 
"systematically performed actions aimed at destabilization of 
the political and economic situation in the city, and repeatedly 
exceeded his powers." 
  In the meantime, according to information from sources close 
to the city and oblast administrations, the edict on Shoykhet's 
dismissal was signed by the president 40 minutes after Omsk 
Oblast Governor Leonid Polezhayev, who is chairman of the 
interregional "Siberian Agreement" association, had walked into 
his office. Mr. Polezhayev was one of Yuriy Shoykhet's main 
enemies. In particular, the mayor opposed in every way the 
subsidy-based approach to the shaping of the city budget 
preached by the oblast administration. Thanks to the oblast 
administration's policy, food and essential goods prices, 
subsidized from the local budget in Omsk, are being maintained 
at a lower level than in the other oblasts in western Siberia. 
Shoykhet insisted on targeting subsidies at the poor, which 
would release considerable funds for city and oblast needs. The 
mayor thought that the policy of the oblast governor had denied 
the city the funds for civic improvements and the maintenance of 
city utility systems. According to a staffer in the city 
administration, "Omsk is choking for want of funds and simply 
falling apart while low-priced goods are being swept out by 
visitors from other oblasts." 
  On 27 January, the collegium of the city administration with 
Yuriy Shoykhet's participation decided to pass a request to 
Boris Yeltsin to appoint a competent commission of the 
president's staff to conduct an expert assessment of the Omsk 
mayor's work. The collegium voiced the hope that the edict may 
be revoked.

<F P=106> [Sergey Fedotov report: "Shaymiyev To Run for Federal </F>
Parliament. Kazan Agrees To Nominate Its Candidates for 
Parliamentary Election"] 
  [Text] Tatarstan leaders are ready to join in the election 
campaign to elect the Federal Assembly. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has 
learned that the collection of signatures to register President 
Mintimer Shaymiyev and Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid 
Mukhametshin as candidates in the elections for the Federation 
Council was launched yesterday in the republic. If this is so, 
the republic is in for a fierce struggle for seats at the 
Russian parliament between the bureaucrats and the democrats. 
Russian State Duma Deputy Ivan Grachev is intent on seizing one 
more chance by running for the Federation Council. 
  This information has not been officially confirmed. 
According to local observers, the silence is attributable to 
the fact that the negotiating process between Kazan and Moscow, 
which was resumed in January, has not yet reached the stage of 
signing an interstate treaty and intergovernmental agreements. 
According to Tatarstan Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov, 
however, the republic's leaders expect the documents to be 
signed before 13 February -- the deadline for completing the 
registration of candidates. Once treaty protocols are approved 
in Moscow, the Tatarstan president and parliamentary speaker 
will definitely make an official announcement about their 
joining the election campaign for seats in the Federal 
Assembly's upper chamber. Then, observers note, one will be 
able to state with certainty that the federal elections will 
take place in the republic on 13 March and that State Duma seats 
in all five one- mandate districts will be fiercely contested by 
representatives of the local administration. Shaymiyev and 
Mukhametshin will apparently be elected to the Federation 
Council. 
  The bureaucrats' main rivals in the struggle for deputy 
seats 
will be representatives of the "Equality and Rule-of-Law" 
electoral bloc, an association of Tatarstan's democratic forces. 
Yesterday's meeting of its leadership approved nine candidates 
whose election campaigns the bloc will support. Six of them 
already contested the 12 December elections and won more votes 
in their districts than any other candidates. Apparently, this 
gives "Equality and Rule-of-Law" a chance to compete with the 
republic's leaders for Russian parliamentary seats. Ivan 
Grachev, for the time being the only State Duma deputy from 
Tatarstan, elected on the "Yavlinskiy- Boldyrev-Lukin" ticket 
and the bloc's chairman, will run for the upper chamber. 
  "We may lose to the nomenklatura, if more than 50 percent of 
the voters turn out in electoral wards. But this would not suit 
the republic's leadership, who keep saying that by ignoring 
Russian elections the people prove the correctness of a course 
chosen by Tatarstan," Grachev told KOMMERSANT-DAILY. Local 
politicians, however, note that the bloc's chances are 
diminishing because the democrats cannot put up a joint front in 
the elections. Despite a decision by the bloc's leaders, 
members of the Democratic Party of Russia's local branch and 
representatives of other democratic movements are going to join 
in the fray.

<F P=106> [German Galkin report: "The Urals Lobby Intends To </F>
Intensify Its Influence"] 
  [Text] On 28 January, the council of the regional 
Association for Economic Cooperation of the Urals Republics and 
Regions held a session in Chelyabinsk, chaired by Eduard Rossel. 
It discussed the economic problems of the Urals territories and 
also made a decision to create the Assembly of Ural Deputies or, 
as it is unofficially being called, the Urals Senate. 
  At a final press conference Eduard Rossel came out with a 
statement on the creation of the Assembly of Urals Deputies. At 
a request from KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent he explained 
that parliamentarians of all Urals regions are associating not 
to strengthen opposition to the president's course but to 
undertake "day-to-day parliamentary work." Observers point out, 
however, that the Urals Assembly has chances of becoming a 
serious political force in the federal parliament, capable -- 
relying on the support of the regional association -- of 
influencing both the government and the president. 
  Touching on the question of possible ratification by the 
federal parliament of the constitution of the Urals Republic, 
its former governor Mr. Rossel said that this question is not so 
urgent. Nonetheless all the requisite documents have been sent 
to the State Duma. To deal with a number of regional problems, 
Mr. Rossel reported, a special commission is being set up under 
the Russian president which will also include members of the 
Association for Economic Cooperation of the Urals Republics and 
Regions. 
  Among the statements made by representatives of the Urals 
regions the most attention was drawn to the report by Vladimir 
Yelagin, head of the Orenburg Oblast administration: He said 
that the spring sowing campaign may not be held in the oblast, 
which currently supplies grain to 64 regions in Russia. The 
reason is the lack of funds: The government has not as yet 
settled the old debts, and hopes for credits is very small. 
  The council session decided to submit to the government 12 
economic programs for the development of the Urals, including on 
conversion, communications, agriculture, and also on improving 
the financial settlements system. Special consideration was 
given to the prospects of producing optical fiber communication 
facilities. As Anatoliy Barulin, chief designer at a defense 
institute, told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent, the Urals 
enterprises undergoing conversion are capable, for instance, of 
controlling the market for modern communications means in Russia. 
  Thus, the meeting in Chelyabinsk has demonstrated the 
regional leaders' serious intention to increase the political 
and industrial influence by the Urals lobby in Moscow.

  [Text] St. Petersburg January 31 TASS -- "You can now 
address me as governor," chief of the administration of Russia's 
northwestern Leningrad region Aleksandr Belyakov told 
journalists here today. He was presenting the regional 
administration structure. 
  Belyakov recalled that the total area of the region exceeds 
that of Austria, and its contribution to the national product is 
greater than the total production of the neighbouring Republic 
of Estonia. "We are as important a part of the Russian 
Federation as the city of St. Petersburg, and we will have a 
government of our own," governor of the Leningrad region said. 
  Belyakov spoke against giving a new name to the region which 
was called, as St. Petersburg was, after Bolshevik revolution 
leader Vladimir Lenin. He said that "remaking history is a 
thankless business and it would offend siege veterans who 
defended the city and region of Leningrad." 
  Belyakov said Vladimir Porotikov will be the finance 
minister 
of the local government. There will be four vice-premiers. One 
will be in charge of the economy, another in charge of 
agriculture and environmental protection, still another will be 
responsible for the development of the social sphere, and the 
last one will be in charge of privatisation. 
  The regional legislative assembly will consist of 25 
deputies 
who will be elected on March 20, on the same day when deputies 
to the municipalities will be elected in major cities and other 
residential centres of the region. 
  The present 230 rural councils will be replaced with 219 
volosts. Villagers will elect "starosta" (village elder, or 
headman). According to Belyakov, this will bring power closer to 
the people, stimulate initiative and increase responsibility of 
local governments by enhancing their role in the economic reform. 
  But the region has first to work out its own charter, which 
will be put to a referendum on the election day, March 20.

  [Text] The visit to Washington by the governmental 
delegation of Ukraine, led by Economic Minister Roman Shpek, has 
ended with the adoption of a joint statement on the outcome of 
the Ukrainian-U.S. economic negotiations. 
  In particular, the statement says that the United States of 
America attributes primary importance to the success of the 
democratic and market reforms in Ukraine. Taking into account 
the fact that Ukraine plays a stabilizing role, its economic and 
political security is of very great significance for the 
security of the United States and Europe. 
  In connection with this, the document points out, proceeding 
from the results of the negotiations, the United States 
submitted for consideration plans to expand aid to Ukraine in 
1994. The United States of America is also ready to work with 
its G-7 partners and international financial organizations with 
the aim of immediately mobilizing additional aid to support the 
reform program worked out by Ukraine and the International 
Monetary Fund. 
  The U.S. side, the statement further indicates, expressed 
concern about the current economic state of Ukraine and hailed 
the measures by the Ukrainian authorities geared to overcoming 
the economic crisis. Ukraine and the United States of America 
agreed on setting up a joint commission on issues of trade and 
investments and also completed negotiations on the agreement on 
avoiding double taxation and continued negotiations on bilateral 
protection of investments.

  [Text] Zaporozhye January 29 TASS--The problem of storing 
nuclear fuel waste at Ukrainian nuclear power plants will 
possibly be resolved with the help of a contract concluded 
between the Zaporozhskaya AES amalgamation and the U.S. Duke 
Power Company. 
  Ukraine has no facilities to process nuclear fuel waste. 
Earlier, processing was done in Russia. Ukrainian nuclear 
plants have stockpiled a lot of used magazines after Russia's 
refusal to receive waste for processing. They are now kept at 
"cooling" ponds which are virtually filled up. 
  If the problem is not resolved in the next 12-18 months, 
operating power units of nuclear plants should be switched off 
one by one. 
  The UKRINFORM news agency reports that storage facilities of 
the Duke Power Company have a general licence of the U.S. 
leading control organisation and are already in operation at 
three American nuclear power plants and two nuclear laboratories. 
  The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant has already started work 
to implement the contract: an ecological and technological 
feasibility report is now being drafted. 
  If this and following work is successful, Ukraine will have 
the first stage of such a storage facility for nuclear waste by 
the end of 1995. 
  In the agency's opinion, the construction of similar 
storages 
at other nuclear stations will help stabilise the situation in 
this field and to resolve the problem of temporary storage of 
nuclear fuel waste.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Karpenko under the "Editor in Chief's </F>
Column" rubric: "They Promise Too Much"] 
  [Text] The trilateral statement of the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia is being discussed by 
everybody. It is no wonder -- nuclear disarmament is the only 
way for humanity to survive. Either all nuclear states will 
dismantle this most terrible weapons of mass destruction, or the 
threat of wiping out every living being on the face of the earth 
will loom over civilization like the sword of Damocles. 
However, for some reason, the first step was not made by 
Russia, China, or even France, or by any other country 
possessing nuclear weapons, but by much-suffering Ukraine. 
Besides, the most vociferous and heated appraisals of the 
thanks-to-secret-diplomacy agreement are being voiced by 
officials of those states which belong to the nuclear club. 
This is understandable: We would embrace with the same clamor 
and degree of concern the disarmament of the United States or, 
even more so, Russia. However, I am afraid that we will not 
live that long. Now we are being assured that Ukraine will gain 
a lot after it hands over its nuclear warheads to our northern 
neighbor, which will turn around and sell the enriched uranium 
to the United States; these assurances are voiced by our 
president, as well as our ministers and generals, who 
unanimously assert that Ukraine will reap many profits on the 
path to unilateral nuclear disarmament. State mass media organs 
furiously advocate the same claim and voice the same opinion, 
and such uniformity and unanimity makes one to recall the former 
times of ideological adherence to the party line. 
  Normal people, however, are lost in doubts. It is true that 
Ukraine has declared itself to be a nonnuclear state; it is also 
true that, having suffered from Chernobyl, Ukraine does not need 
any nuclear warheads. However, the disarmament should be 
accomplished step by step, along with other nuclear states. 
  Yes, the statements that the liquid-fuel rockets are 
dangerous to the environment sound convincing; besides, the 
rocket's guarantee service term is coming to a close. But is 
there any reason to hand over the solid-fuel rockets? Even 
pro-Russian Mr. Kuchma has not consented to such a move. 
  Yes, there is no disagreement as to the statement that we do 
not need strategic nuclear weapons which we are not able to use 
(it is a logical point of view, because tactical rockets were 
given to Russia for free). However, let us recall Margaret 
Thatcher who, notwithstanding her being a woman, had strongly 
defended the English right to possess nuclear weapons as a means 
of deterrence, even though nobody threatened the territorial 
integrity of Great Britain and nobody exerted shameless economic 
pressure upon that country. 
  Yes, the lack of specialists capable of providing technical 
service to nuclear warheads is a serious reason to get rid of 
them. However, how many of our countrymen and compatriots are 
providing technical service to those weapons on Russian 
territory?! 
  Now President Clinton states joyously: Strategic missiles 
on Ukrainian territory will no longer be aimed at the United 
States. However, not a word in the statement about strategic 
missiles on U.S. territory not being aimed at Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan, or Belarus... 
  Well, Ukraine's unilateral nuclear disarmament is a noble 
and 
moral step. We are being assured that this step is economically 
profitable as well. However, doubts are natural among men. To 
disperse doubts and to become assured of Ukraine's profits, we 
need to have clear and distinct answers to some questions. 
  First. Why have the three presidents preferred 
the form of a statement as opposed to a trilateral agreement, as 
is usually used with important international issues? As a rule, 
statements are not subject to parliamentary ratification. 
Maybe, the adoption of the statement was intended to preclude 
ratification by the Ukrainian Supreme Council, even though the 
council, according to Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk], can 
grow wiser. If the statement is not subject to 
ratification, are its provisions subject to implementation? 
  Second. What specific compensation is 
provided for Ukraine for the transfer of the nuclear warheads to 
Russia? 
  Third. For what price is Russia going 
to sell enriched uranium from Ukrainian warheads to the United 
States? Why cannot Ukraine sell that uranium to America or some 
other nuclear state without an intermediary? 
  Fourth. How many, in what stage of 
preparedness, and for what price does 
Ukraine sell uranium rods to Russian nuclear power plants, which 
are prepared from Ukrainian raw materials mined and enriched by 
our citizens? At the same time, it would be interesting to know 
the price of the completely prepared uranium rods which are 
being resold to Ukrainian nuclear power plants by Russia. 
  Fifth. What specific security guarantees are 
granted to Ukraine by the United States and the Russian 
Federation for dismantling strategic nuclear weapons, in 
addition to the provisions of the statement, which repeat the 
principles of the CSCE Final Act? The CSCE Final Act was signed 
by these states some time ago, but it did not exclude Russian 
territorial claims and economic pressure with regard to Ukraine 
-- a member and one of the founders of the United Nations. 
  Sixth. The last question repeats the doubt that 
was already expressed above: Why are we discussing the full 
nuclear disarmament of Ukraine only, not taking into 
account a step-by-step simultaneous disarmament by 
all other nuclear states? 
  As we see, these questions are not difficult to answer. 
However, without these answers, it is impossible to evaluate 
the Moscow trilateral agreement and determine what Ukraine 
will gain for transferring strategic nuclear weapons -- 
will these gains be the same as with the tactical missiles 
transfer, or will there be something more? 
  Anticipating my opponents' criticism, I admit that I am not 
a 
nuclear specialist, and the above questions may be those of a 
dilettante. However, it makes it easier for specialists to 
answer them precisely and clearly. VECHIRNIY KYYIV 
is ready to publish such answers to dissipate the disbelief of 
many Ukrainian people in the great victories of our young 
diplomacy.

combat armoured vehicles and 175 planes have been dismantled by 
November 17, 1993 in accordance with the treaty on conventional 
weapons in Europe. More than 50 inspection teams from 
countries-participants of the treaty visited Ukraine during that 
time. 
  Another four international inspection teams have already 
visited the country this year. They inspected armoured 
vehicles' production plants in Lvov, Nikolayev, Kiev and 
Zhitomir. 100 tanks and 60 combat armoured vehicles are planned 
to be destroyed on these sites in the near future. 
  Altogether 600 tanks and more than 300 combat armoured 
vehicles should be dismantled during this new stage of reduction 
of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

  [Text] Russian enterprises have suspended fuel supplies to 
Ukraine's nuclear power stations due to persistent indebtedness. 
A report by Ukraine's State Committee for the Use of Nuclear 
Power circulated today says that unless the situation improves, 
Ukraine will have to decommission 3.8 million kilowatts-worth of 
power-generating facilities, or one-third of its nuclear 
capacity, in 1994, and all of its nuclear power stations in 
1995. In order to find a way out of this contingency, it is 
necessary to immediately pay Russia's enterprises over 48 
billion rubles for new fuel.

  [Text] Up to third of Ukraine's nuclear power stations may 
be decommissioned in 1994. This will lead to the loss of 3.8 Bn 
kilowatts of electric power. All Ukrainian nuclear power 
stations may stop functioning in 1995, INTERFAX-Ukraine was 
informed by the press service of the Ukrainian State Committee 
for Atomic Power on Friday. 
  The press service announced that Ukraine received 
practically 
no nuclear fuel due to continuing non-payment of Ukrainian 
enterprises to Russia. This would lead to stopping of the 
nuclear power stations' energy blocks in Ukraine. 
  The 3rd energy block of the Chernobyl nuclear power station 
is expected to be stopped on January 30, its first energy block 
on March 31 and the energy blocks of the Yuzhnoukrainskaya and 
Zaporozhye nuclear power stations may be stopped in May and 
August. 
  The continued functioning of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station's 2nd energy block planned by the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet is also becoming unfeasible, the committee's press 
service pointed out.

January, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko noted in 
particular that "one of the most important tasks of my trip to 
the Balkans is the necessity of outlining the extension of 
specific assistance by Ukraine in settling the situation in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina." In the opinion of the head of the 
Ukrainian foreign policy department, only by taking account of 
all the possibilities and all the interests of the parties 
concerned can a mutually acceptable way of resolving this 
problem be elaborated.

  [Text] The press center of Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs publicized a statement today from the Ukrainian Embassy 
in the Republic of Poland. In particular, it reads that on 27 
January 1994, the Polish newspapers ZYCIE WARSZAWY and SZTANDAR 
MLODYCH published a report about a court case that was being 
instigated against three Polish citizens on 31 January and that 
they were being accused of smuggling. One of the accused 
described himself as an agent of the Polish special services. 
This gave the mentioned newspapers grounds for describing the 
case as revenge for Lysenko and a Polish-Ukrainian smuggling and 
espionage war. 
  The Ukrainian Embassy announced that the criminal case that 
was initiated against the Polish smugglers over a year ago has 
no bearing on the case of Major Anatoliy Lysenko. None of the 
Polish citizens are being accused of espionage, and that is why 
there can be no question of revenge or an espionage war. The 
Ukrainian side regards the arrest of Major Lysenko as a spy to 
be groundless, and that is why it has continuously demanded his 
release.

  [Text] Moscow January 29 TASS -- Black Sea Fleet Commander 
Eduard Baltin said on Saturday he has not issued any orders to 
his officers as to whom they should vote for in the second stage 
of presidential elections in the Crimea to be held on Sunday. 
  "I have not issued and will not issue any orders to the 
officers and warrant officers as to whom they should vote for," 
Baltin said. He believes the Army should be out of politics and 
servicemen should vote "as their conscience and mind tell them." 
  The situation in the Black Sea Fleet and in the city of 
Sevastopol where the fleet headquarters is located remains calm, 
the press centre of the Black Sea Fleet told ITAR-TASS via 
telephone. 
  The city is being patrolled by the police and the Navy. 
Joint patrolling was launched a month ago to clamp down on the 
growing crime in the Crimea. 
  No closed polling stations have been set up for the Navy 
this 
time. Navy officers who are residents of the Crimea will vote 
at their local polling stations, deputy head of the Black Sea 
Fleet personnel department, said.

  [Text] The article "Battle in Crimea, Smoke Is Everywhere," 
published in the Moscow-based newspaper KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 
25 January, contains a number of inaccuracies, probably of a 
deliberate nature, says a report circulated by the press service 
of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. 
  The newspaper announced that large-scale exercises of Armed 
Forces headquarters units and formations took place in certain 
southern oblasts of Ukraine and in the Crimea from 24-28 
January. According to the newspaper, the exercises were 
connected with the results of the first round of the 
presidential election on the peninsula. 
  The press service of the Ukrainian military department, the 
report indicates further on, had more than once reported about 
the upcoming strategic exercise that was held from 24-27 January 
this year under the leadership of the supreme commander of the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine. The plan of holding the exercise, 
aimed at solving the tasks of the country's territorial defense, 
was approved as far back as November 1993. As for the units and 
formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they were not 
involved in the exercise at all.

  [Text] Lvov January 29 TASS -- Ukraine is closely following 
the presidential elections in the Crimea. One of popular 
Ukrainian lawmakers, Mikhail Kosiv from Lvov, whose opinion is 
heeded by various segments of population, calmed down Ukrainians 
by saying that the Crimea would not join Russia. 
  Kosiv who repeatedly visited the peninsula, gave a 
staggering 
forecast. He said that the Crimea will belong to Tatars in 
future, since every second newborn baby now is a Tatar. 
  In Kosiv's opinion, Turkey is also interested in Tatars' 
domination of the peninsula: Over 500,000 Crimean Tatars now 
live in Turkey, and they helped and continue to help their 
countrymen on the peninsula. 
  "If we also take into account such a factor as the Ukrainian 
Fleet on the Black Sea and Ukrainian bases in the Crimea, there 
will be no problems for Ukraine in that area," Kosiv concluded 
his forecast. 
  Yuriy Shukhevich, right-wing leader of the Ukrainian 
National 
Assembly-Ukrainian People's Self-Defence, who is no less popular 
in Ukraine's western region than Kosiv, claims that Israel is 
interested in the Peninsula very much. 
  "Remember that Jews always dreamt of their own autonomy back 
in the Soviet Union but in the Crimea rather than in 
Birobidzhan," he said. "Therefore, I believe that Israel's 
influence will grow there." 
  In Shukhevich's opinion, the destiny of the Crimea will be 
decided not in Simferopol or Sevastopol but in Kiev where, as he 
believes, there is no firm presidential power for the time being.

  [Text] We have received a statement by the press service of 
the National-Democratic Congress of Ukraine in connection with 
the victory of Yuriy Meshkov, leader of the Republican Movement 
of Crimea [RDK], in the Crimean presidential elections. It 
says, in particular: 
  The stability of a state is guaranteed by adherence to the 
fundamental law, both by its citizens and by all branches of 
power. Unfortunately, Ukraine is one of those states where the 
Constitution is ignored by many political forces and power 
structures. The guarantor of the Constitution, the president of 
Ukraine, resorts to defensive statements as he watches it 
happen. The presidential elections in the Crimean autonomy were 
a gross violation of Ukrainian laws, including the Constitution. 
They were held in an atmosphere of blatant Ukrainophobia, with 
the overt financial support of benefactors from the ruble zone. 
  The Ukrainian state leadership remained, by tradition, on 
the 
sidelines, maintaining a so-called balanced stand. These 
circumstances, as well as the socioeconomic situation in the 
state, brought RDK leader Meshkov and the Russia political bloc 
to executive power. The Russian Federation has acquired another 
lever to exert pressure on Ukraine. This particularly concerns 
the Black Sea Fleet and the deployment of Russian armed forces 
on the territory of the Ukrainian state. 
  The Russian media, particularly Ostankino and Vesti 
[television channels] competed with one another in asserting 
that Crimea was choosing a new political course. The RDK leader 
won the votes of almost half of the adult population in the 
peninsula. Thus, the results of the voting proved that the 
Crimean population indeed chose a new course, looking to Russia 
for the economic transformations and financial injections it 
promises. Therefore, the results of the Crimean presidential 
elections give good reason for radical reconsideration of 
Ukraine's economic policy. 
  Separatist Meshkov's success is also a result of the absence 
of a clear information policy in Ukraine aimed at strengthening 
its statehood. The developments of the past few months showed 
that Ukraine's leadership fails to command proper weight in the 
regions. Will officials from the RDK abide by Kiev's laws, while 
putting forward the declaration of the peninsula's full 
independence as one of their main objectives?

<F P=106> [Leonid Kapelyushnyy and Nikolay Semena report: "January </F>
1994 Crimean Campaign. Sunday Sees Second Round of Presidential 
Elections on the Peninsula"] 
  [Excerpts] Simferopol -- Everyone has long been aware that 
trouble was brewing in the Crimea. Trouble with a host of 
aspects and shades. But the governments and parliaments of 
Ukraine and Russia watched the alarming process stony-faced, 
allowing events to run their course as it were. Thus the Crimea 
came to see presidential elections with Nikolay Bagrov and Yuriy 
Meshkov in the final lap. 
  Nikolay Bagrov is an experienced politician, a product of 
the 
system, a former party obkom [oblast committee] first secretary, 
now chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet. It was he who was 
behind the revival of a republic in the Crimea and secured its 
political and economic autonomy. 
  In Ukraine Bagrov is considered a treacherous separatist, a 
"Red-cum-Brown." Crimean radicals are thought to be irresolute 
and trying to ingratiate themselves with Kiev. "Do you want to 
live as you are? Do you want Kravchuk's rapscallions and 
humiliation? Then vote for Bagrov!" -- that is his political 
opponents' main idea. 
  Yuriy Meshkov is a man of the squares. Rallies are his 
element, slogans and war cries his weapons. He has been a 
fitter, a soldier, a student at Moscow State University's 
Faculty of Law, and a Prosecutor's Office investigator. He 
promises the people of the Crimea a sovereign republic, he 
promises to bring the Crimea back to the ruble zone and to the 
bosom of Russia, he also promises the good life soon, and that 
young men will do their military service on the peninsula. He 
also says that he wants to heed the harassed, impoverished, 
desperate people. Most of the points in his program are 
unfeasible. But they are all Joe Public's dream.... [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  To What Kind of Russia Does the Crimea Want To Return? </H5>
  In the public garden opposite the Crimean Supreme Soviet 
from 
morning until evening two dozen citizens, primarily of a 
venerable age, have been freely cursing Kravchuk and all 
Ukrainians with their independence and making emotional appeals 
for the Crimea to be returned to Russia. Yuriy Meshkov is their 
idol. Zhirinovskiy has spoken here. The gathering warmly 
applauded the announcement of his intention to become president 
of Russia and annex [prisoyedinit] the Crimea. 
  It is easy to see in conversation that these citizens cannot 
stand President Yeltsin, they do not fete Gaydar and his team 
for their "shock therapy," and their sympathies lean more toward 
those who "favor the Soviet Union and Great Russia," a disaster 
for the whole world. 
  The 1.5 million Russians in the Crimea form a heterogeneous 
mass and cannot be identified with the hysterical women in the 
public garden. In sober, calm conversation they agree that you 
cannot regrettably bring back the past and that forcibly carving 
borders spells a bloodbath. But they cannot resign themselves 
to the fact that they are cut off from Russia and must accept 
the supremacy of Ukrainian law and acknowledge Ukraine's right 
to the peninsula. 
  The Crimean people believe religiously that Mother Russia is 
waiting with open arms for their "escape from captivity." 
Presidential candidate Yuriy Meshkov sounds off on every street 
corner saying that "all matters have been resolved with Russia," 
from dual citizenship to the Russian ruble's circulation in the 
Crimea. 
  The Crimean people's separatism has a firm foundation -- 
the economic collapse in Ukraine. The coupon-karbovanets is bad 
not because it carries a picture of the Cathedral of Saint Sofia 
but because it is a Mickey Mouse currency. 
<H5>  Enterprises Choke in Tax Noose </H5>
  An entrepreneur from Krasnogvardeysk was puzzled as to how 
"masochistic" a government has to be to render commodity 
production unprofitable. And he described how they organized 
production of electric stoves in conjunction with foreign 
partners. 
  The goods are in great demand. But taxes have been crushing. 
He himself bought equipment to manufacture plastic pipes for 
water supply lines and sewage. Given the current levels of 
individual housing construction in the Crimea this is a correct, 
profitable, and necessary business. But the taxes that have 
been levied from all quarters are so extortionate that the 
workshop is standing idle. 
  Needless to say, Dnepr water is a boon, life itself for the 
steppes. But I. Karamelev, director of the "Tavricheskiy" 
Sovkhoz in Perekop, spoke of how equipment was standing idle at 
the height of the field work -- there are no spare parts, no 
fuel, and, most importantly, there is no state interest in 
ensuring that the land feeds the people. The economy is 
withering every day. 
  "We voted for Bagrov. All the country people in the rayon," 
he said. "Because we see him as stability." 
  That was how food producers in the Crimea saw N. Bagrov's 
campaign to shape an open economy on the peninsula, finally 
extricating the Crimea from Ukraine's ruinous economic policy. 
As of this January the republic has had its own bank, 
established its own tax system, and tried to manage autonomously. 
<H5>  Foreboding of Disaster </H5>
  Rashness mixed with a craving for simple solutions has 
always 
cost us plenty. Let us ask ourselves the following question: 
What will happen to the Crimea in the future? What if Yuriy 
Meshkov becomes president (and he is very likely to be 
victorious) and starts putting his slogans into practice? How 
will the already strained Ukrainian-Russian relations develop 
then? It is naive to think that even the most moderate 
politicians in Ukraine will agree to disrupt the state's 
territorial integrity. After all there are also radical forces, 
like the national self-defense detachments that have fought in 
the Dniester Region and Abkhazia and do not come under the 
jurisdiction of official Kiev. Dynamite and the assault rifle 
are by no means secondary in their arsenal of arguments, and 
their experience of wrecking lines of communication in the 
Caucasus and blockading railroads can easily be transferred to 
the Crimea. And what then? Without water, without electricity, 
and without reliable railroad communications the Crimea would 
indeed be a peninsula.... Would things be better for it then? 
  A conflagration is starting before our eyes, threatening to 
burn hot. Why are we keeping silent? Why do we think that 
embroiling millions of people in an adventure constitutes 
democracy? 
  Over many centuries the Perekop Channel [perekopskiy rov] 
has 
begun to slowly close up, becoming overgrown with idyllic reeds 
and losing its defense significance. How I would like to hope 
that it will not be used for its real purpose at the close of 
the 20th century.

  [Text] The strategic command staff exercise in Ukraine's 
territorial defense ended today. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The five-day exercise was held 
under the supervision of the commander in chief, Ukraine's 
President Leonid Kravchuk. The main events took place on maps 
at the Defense Ministry's training headquarters. This first 
conceptual training involved all of Ukraine's ministries and 
state departments. Understandably, the main organizational 
measures on territorial defense are taken by security 
organizations. Operational groups of the Defense Ministry, the 
State Committee for Protection of State Borders, the Security 
Service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Guard, 
and the Civil Defense went over the entire package of issues 
related to defense of our state's territory. 
  At today's session, Lieutenant-General Volodymyr Mykhtyuk, 
commander of the Strategic Missile Forces, was promoted to 
colonel general. Also today, after summing up the results of 
the strategic command staff exercise, the commander in chief, 
President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, approved the country's 
territorial defense plan. 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] We proceed from the premise that 
Ukraine is a peaceful state and will pursue a peaceful policy, a 
policy of friendship, cooperation, trust, and fulfillment of all 
international commitments. Therefore, we conclude that we 
cannot have enemies, since we do not threaten anybody, do not 
have any territorial claims against anybody, and pursue a 
peaceful policy, overcoming all obstacles on the way toward 
nonnuclear status. This is the concept. But life itself is 
much more complicated and manifold than a concept. Therefore, 
we cannot rule out the possibility that somebody could develop 
an urge to test their power on our state and our people, and we 
must prepare to defend our state and our people, which is 
envisioned in our concept. 
  The strategic task we set before ourselves today is the 
defense of Ukraine, and the readiness of both the armed forces 
and others for this sacred task of state defense. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Military Review" article by Vasiliy Dandykin and Vladimir </F>
Maryukha: "Ocean-Going...Coastal Fleet. Ukraine Is Creating It 
Contrary to Common Sense, Striving To Finally Divide the Black 
Sea Fleet by Any Means"] 
  [Text] Of all the former union republics which had outlets 
to seas (the Baltic countries, those in the Caspian region, and 
Georgia), only Ukraine plans to call itself a naval power in the 
very near future. If the economic crisis in the republic were 
not so profound, by the start of the new millennium it would be 
able to create its own fleet from scratch, as it were. Its 
scientific potential, the shipbuilding capacities in Nikolayev, 
Kherson, Kiev, and Kerch, the ships laid down at the time of the 
"indivisible" Union, and the related enterprises producing 
turbines, arms, and optical and electronic equipment make it 
possible to implement a shipbuilding program which meets the 
needs for defending the republic's sovereignty from the sea. 
But the backbone of the Ukrainian Navy, which has already been 
created, goes far beyond the tasks of a coastal fleet. Taking 
into account the aspirations with regard to dividing the Black 
Sea Fleet, Ukraine's future fleet is altogether seen as an 
ocean-going one. 
<H5>  A Fleet of Which Ukraine Never Dreamed </H5>
  Since it proclaimed the policy of creating national armed 
forces, Ukraine has followed the principle of having its "own 
fleet, albeit a small one," capable of defending the republic's 
coast against military and economic invasion and fulfilling the 
functions of an emergency rescue service at sea. These tasks 
are within the capabilities of a brigade -- two ships to guard 
the area of water, several onshore missile and artillery 
systems, and a combined (ground-attack fighters and helicopters) 
air regiment. Even now, however, the Slavutich -- the flagship 
of the Ukrainian Navy -- and the patrol combatant Sagaydachnyy 
are clearly confined to the Black Sea in their actions. Like 
the "Slava"-class guided missile cruiser which is being prepared 
for sea trials, they need ocean expanses. Ukraine has on the 
stocks and berthed in shipyards a whole number of other ships 
whose building is incomplete, including the heavy 
aircraft-carrying cruiser Varyag, for which the Black Sea, 
figuratively speaking, is like a puddle. Having also gotten 
half of the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian Navy will outdo even 
the German Bundesmarine in terms of strength. 
  Personnel -- from seaman to admiral -- are also finding the 
Ukrainian Navy cramped. First, the number of potential 
seafarers who have taken the oath is far greater than the number 
of vacancies in the Ukrainian Navy today. Second, the Black Sea 
Fleet is a kind of forge of cadres, and forms Ukraine's 
mobilization reserve. Third, in previous years a large number of 
the republic's citizens served in the Navy -- which under 
conditions of a shortage of employment can very quickly create 
competition for contract service in the Ukrainian Navy. 
Finally, an additional influx of personnel can easily be 
predicted if the decision to split the Black Sea Fleet "50-50" 
is implemented. 
  In addition, Ukraine is hurriedly building up the forces of 
the marines on the Crimean Peninsula. Doctrinally the tactic of 
using marine landing forces has not yet been agreed upon, the 
Ukrainian Navy does not have the means of getting them to 
possible landing sites, with the exception of one "Zubr"-class 
MDK [small amphibious warfare ship], and more and more people 
originally from Western Ukraine, who make up the backbone of the 
Ukrainian Marines, are turning up around Sevastopol and other 
points where the Black Sea Fleet is based in Crimea. These guys 
with a sleeve badge in the form of a wolf's jaws have already 
been used repeatedly as a "detonator" for various kinds of 
provocations: The takeover of apartment blocks constructed by 
Black Sea Fleet sailors, the armed "resubordination" of 
individual Black Sea Fleet units, and so on. 
  Ukraine also has a training base which is surplus to the 
requirements of a coastal fleet. This is, first, the Naval 
Institute based on two higher naval schools, which trains 
shipboard cadres. Second, the center for retraining flight 
personnel in Nikolayev and the center for training carrier-based 
pilots in Saki. 
<H5>  Some Get the Tops, Some the Bottoms </H5>
  To the nonspecialist a fleet means ships, ships, ships.... 
But in actual fact, without the umbilical cord of mooring 
cables connecting ships to the shore, such a fleet will exist 
for just 30 days -- a ship's maximum period of endurance in 
terms of fuel, water, and food. This was why Ukraine's power 
minister and first naval commander in chief, who quit the 
military-political arena not so long ago, campaigned in favor of 
dividing up the Black Sea Fleet into "tops" and "bottoms": our 
bases, your ships. Clearly, Russia does not want ships without 
bases. Anyway, the fleet's onshore backup has never attained 
civilized norms in the three centuries of its existence. Moving 
the fleet, which works in the interests of the whole 
Commonwealth, to unadapted berths overnight would mean ruining 
it once and for all. 
  The Ukrainian military department was aware of this, but the 
demand for just such a "division" has been implemented with a 
persistence worthy of better application. This has essentially 
meant ousting the Russian Fleet, which, having no other bases on 
the Black Sea, would inevitably leave most of the Black Sea 
Fleet's ships and vessels to Ukraine. 
  Similar submerged rocks are also inherent in dividing the 
Black Sea Fleet "50-50." With the sole difference that half the 
fleet at once passes to Ukraine's jurisdiction, while the rest 
will then be divided by the same method of ousting. With the 
present move toward supposedly outwardly more civilized 
relations with the Black Sea Fleet sailors following the changes 
in the Ukrainian military department, the tactic of "tops" and 
"bottoms" has not lost its topicality. The "tops" (in other 
words, the creeping privatization of the Black Sea Fleet's 
onshore infrastructure) are being gathered with the help of 
those same marines, whose place in Ukraine's military doctrine 
has not yet been defined. Facilities which at first sight have 
no bearing on the Black Sea Fleet's combat readiness are being 
transferred to Ukrainian jurisdiction: the marine engineering 
service, the housing stock. Moreover, in garrisons remote from 
the chief base. 
  And yet the fleet is a multinational structure. The loss of 
components, albeit not the leading ones, leads inevitably to the 
breakdown of the entire "organism." There will be no housing on 
the bases leased by the Black Sea Fleet (there was, at last, 
talk precisely of leasing during the negotiations between 
Ukraine and Russia last year), and the onshore infrastructure 
will not be developed -- in the very near future neither Ukraine 
nor Russia will have any need of the ships themselves. 
<H5>  "To Execute, and No Pardon" </H5>
  The "joint operation of bases," being imposed by the 
Ukrainian side, essentially deprives the Black Sea Fleet of any 
prospects for the future: Disagreements will be sure to arise 
even between the closest neighbors if, for example, the status 
of one spade between two is not enshrined in a corresponding 
agreement. 
  The crack is being widened by the information blockade and 
the imposition of the "only correct" information in the 
Ukrainian interpretation of it: Central Russian publications, 
including KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, do not reach Crimea, television 
broadcasting is limited in terms of time and the number of 
programs, and the press center of the Ukrainian Navy -- the 
ideological mouthpiece for the division of the Black Sea Fleet 
-- has a staff many times greater than that of the press center 
of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  It is no wonder that, given this distribution of forces in 
the "fourth estate," justification is found for any tricks by 
the Ukrainian marines, by their commanders who pit their 
subordinates against the "cursed Muscovites [moskalivy]," and by 
higher officials who are impatiently awaiting the "black 
redivision" of the Black Sea Fleet. Alas, we have to state that 
in the Ukrainian fleet, which essentially has not yet come into 
being, hatred for everything "non-Ukrainian" is cultivated far 
better than common sense and the age-old friendship of the Slav 
peoples. We who have prepared this material and who represent 
both branches of the peoples who grew out of the single Slav 
root find it all the more unpleasant to be aware of this. For, 
in tracing the dynamics of the situation, we do not rule out the 
least favorable development of events. The intensity of passion 
in Crimea and in the Black Sea Fleet and the deepening crisis in 
Ukraine's economy and policy are such that it will only take the 
slightest provocation (these, let us dare to assert, are not 
excluded from the arsenal of the "political" struggle for 
possession of the peninsula and the fleet) and blood will flow. 
  So far the signal has not been given for a general 
"offensive" against the Black Sea Fleet, and individual 
"battles" of local significance are being waged. These include 
"freezing" the Black Sea Fleet's accounts in Ukrainian banks and 
levying all kinds of taxes and customs and other duties, whose 
total, if it has not exceeded the Ukrainian "share" of the funds 
once allocated to maintaining the fleet, at least long ago 
became commensurate with it. Even the food and fuel imported 
from Russia, with which Ukrainian seamen satisfy their needs, 
are requisitioned. The sums recovered in this way go into the 
Ukrainian Navy's budget. In these conditions the Black Sea 
Fleet sailors should campaign to ensure that there is no tax on 
air imported from Russia. 
  In other words, both the republic's leadership and the 
Ukrainian Navy Command are doing everything to ensure that, 
instead of the Black Sea Fleet on the southern flank of the CIS, 
there is a weak Russian fleet based in unadapted places and an 
enlarged Ukrainian fleet capable of operating far outside the 
Black Sea. At the same time the Ukrainian side disregards the 
fact that the division (in fact, the ruin) of the Black Sea 
Fleet will result in an imbalance of forces in the region -- 
which will infringe Russia's legitimate interests. This means 
that, in carrying out its sentence in respect of the Black Sea 
Fleet ("to execute, and no pardon"), Ukraine could come up 
against the fact that its "ocean-going coastal" fleet will not 
protect its personal interests, which are defended today, albeit 
to its own detriment, by the Black Sea Fleet.

  [Text] The parliament in Kiev has approved a resolution on 
this year's economic and social development plan which provides 
for a 8.6 percent decline in the GDP. The plan also envisages a 
2.3 percent growth in industrial output and a 7.1 percent in the 
farming sector. 
  Consumer production is to be increased by 5.7 percent with 
export revenues being planned at the level of $1.3 Bn. 
  The cabinet is given two weeks in which to approve the 
volume 
of state orders and contracts and inform appropriate ministries, 
departments and local governments. 
  Chairman of the planning, budget and price commission Andrey 
Pecherov told parliament that this year's government guidelines 
had been changed to the detriment of "market methods" though 
this was necessary in the emerging conditions. 
  For his part, Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy warned 
against fearing the administrative methods of economic 
management saying "no country in the world has abided without 
them, particularly at the time of crisis." He called on 
deputies to allow the National Bank to provide the government 
with a loan of 12 Tn karbovantsy to be repaid in the second half 
of this year. 
  After four rounds of voting, the government-proposed budget 
was defeated. Some deputies described as utopian the 
government's offer of a non-deficit budget. 
  Head of the defence and security commission Valentin Lemish 
said the proposed defence spending of 16.9 Tn karbovantsy or 4.8 
of total expenditure did not cover the defence ministry's needs.

  [Text] Kiev -- The government has made public the 
resolution "On the State Regulation of Prices for Petroleum 
Products," signed by Acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy on 25 January. In accordance with the resolution, 
prices for petroleum products, including those purchased as 
imports, that are sold on the territory of Ukraine by 
entrepreneurial entities regardless of the forms of their 
ownership, must not exceed the levels established. 
  The price for oil bought in CIS countries under interstate 
contracts is accepted at the level determined by these 
contracts. The price for oil bought under direct contracts 
[between enterprises] or from commercial structures, must not 
exceed that level by more than 10 percent. The price for oil 
imported from other countries cannot exceed the world price. 
  Wholesale and factory prices for petroleum products produced 
by Ukraine's oil refineries and sold by them on the domestic 
market are determined with account taken of the maximum level of 
profitability to the amount of 25 percent of the full cost price 
of the manufacture of products. 
  In selling petroleum products on the territory of Ukraine, 
including imported petroleum products -- except for fuel for 
domestic use in stoves and as lamp kerosene, the following 
maximum levels of profitability are established, as applied to 
the turnover of these products: For oil and petroleum products 
of supply enterprises under the control of DerzhKomNaftoHaz, no 
more than seven percent; for enterprises and organizations 
within UkrAhroTekhServis, no more than 1.5 percent.

  [Text] Kiev -- By its resolution of 26 January 1994 the 
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine introduced partial changes to 
the resolution of 15 January 1991 "On the procedure of issuing 
special permissions (licences) to carry out certain kinds of 
activity and on the amount of payments for the state 
registration of the subjects of entrepreneurship." New payment 
amounts have been set for citizens and legal entities -- 
subjects of entrepreneurial activity -- for the issue of 
licences by the Ministry of Transport to carry out agency 
services for the merchant marine port [as received] in the sea 
and river ports of Ukraine. In Odessa, Ilyichevsk, Kherson, 
Yuzhnoye, and Mariupol ports this is $800,000 per port; in the 
ports of Berdyansk, Nikolayev, Kherson, Izmail, and Reni this is 
$400,000; in Belgorod-Dunayskiy, Kiliya, Yalta, and in all river 
ports this is $200,000 per port. 
  The resolution stipulates that these payments are to be made 
in foreign currency (with the availability of the National Bank 
licence) or in Ukraine's currency converted according to the 
National Bank exchange rate at the time of issue. Besides, the 
principal marine agencies of the Ukrainian Ministry of Transport 
are exempt for five years from any payments for the issue of 
licenses to carry out agency services for the merchant marine 
fleet. The resolution also stipulates that 90 percent of the 
monies received for the issue of licenses are transferred to the 
currency account of the Ministry of Finance, if paid in foreign 
currency, and to the state budget, if paid in Ukraine's 
currency. The rest of the sum remains at the disposal of the 
Ministry of Transport.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Parishkura report: "The Good News: Deputies Get </F>
Registered. The Bad News: Missing Rukh Secretariat Head Has 
Not Yet Been Found"] 
  [Text] The registration of candidates running for Ukraine's 
Supreme Soviet, new convocation, has been completed in district 
electoral commissions. A considerable part of the current 
deputies are running again for the Supreme Soviet. Political 
parties' preparations for the elections have barely started. To 
take place on 29 January is a congress of the "party of power" 
-- the Labor Congress of Ukraine -- and on 5 February there will 
be a congress of one of the most influential parties -- the 
Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine, to discuss questions 
connected with the upcoming 27 March elections. 
  In the eastern part of Ukraine, parties of democratic 
centrist tendency have nominated few delegates, not enough to go 
around all the election districts. Even so they could not split 
up the zones of influence between themselves. For example, the 
rivals in Kharkov will be Volodymyr Grinev, former deputy 
chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Soviet and chairman of the "New 
Ukraine" association, and Genrikh Altunyan, head of the Kharkov 
Kray organization of the People's Rukh of Ukraine. In Odessa, 
Eduard Gurvits, rather influential there, will contend against 
current Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  In Crimea, currently carried away with presidential 
elections, not all election districts have nominated candidates. 
The deadline for their nomination will apparently be moved 
forward because there will be simultaneous elections for 
Crimea's Supreme Soviet. 
  It did not go without scandals. For example, People's Rukh 
leader Vyacheslav Chornovil accused Valentin Nedrigaylo, first 
deputy internal affairs minister, who was supposed to report to 
the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine the results of the search for 
Mikhail Boychishin, head of the Rukh secretariat who has been 
missing since 15 January, of trying to shift the case from the 
political into the purely criminal sphere. This is naturally 
disadvantageous to Rukh. As for the lost chief of the Rukh 
secretariat, no traces of him have been found to date, nor is 
there even a plausible explanation for his disappearance.

  [Text] Lvov, 29 January -- A meeting of the Coordinating 
Council of the All-Ukrainian Association of Working People's 
Solidarity [VOST] has been held here. The participants worked 
out the trade union association's tactics in the election 
campaign and considered VOST's participation in the election. 
VOST Chairman Oleksandr Dzhulyk provided data on the membership 
organizations and the situation around VOST, pointing out that 
interference in the affairs of VOST on the part of alien forces 
(parties and organizations) was inadmissible. The Coordinating 
Council indicated that the main task VOST is concentrating its 
efforts on is the protection of the social and economic 
interests of the working people. VOST's platform is based on 
the principles of the struggle for a mighty, united, 
law-governed, independent, and prosperous Ukraine for mutually 
advantageous and equal relations with all the countries of the 
world. The Coordinating Council participants made a decision on 
VOST members participation in ensuring proper control during the 
election. 
  The Coordinating Council also considered the economic 
situation at the enterprises of Ukraine and discussed the issue 
on concluding collective agreements, salaries, and protection of 
labor. The participants pointed out that VOST favors the market 
economy, which includes privatization on a nation-wide scale, 
emancipation of peasants, state support to the strategic 
industries, private farming, development of spirituality, 
education, and culture, a reform of the political system and a 
reform of the insurance system (medical, social, and pension 
insurance with the compulsory insurance of the employer and the 
hired employee.)

  [Text] The Armenian Defense Ministry press service has 
reported that a relative calm is prevailing in the border 
regions of the Republic. However, the situation continues to 
remain extremely tense in the Karabakh-Azerbaijani conflict zone. 
  Although the Azerbaijani Army is suffering huge losses in 
men 
and material, it is pressing ahead with its desperate attempts 
to break through the Karabakh forces' defensive lines in various 
sectors. In the last three days alone the Karabakh forces 
either destroyed or captured 19 armored cars, including 16 tanks. 
  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters reported 
that the Azerbaijani attacks in various directions along the 
combat line, extending from northwest to the southern borders, 
were completely checked during battles yesterday. The enemy 
launched its fiercest attacks against Martuni. The Azerbaijanis 
retreated to their initial positions after losing two tanks and 
nearly 70 soldiers. The Azerbaijanis also lost a few dozen more 
troops in the other sectors of the war front. Seven were killed 
and 18 injured on the Karabakh side. 
  The combat operations resumed on the morning of 28 January 
in 
the north of Kelbadzharskiy Rayon and nearby Mardak?rtskiy 
Rayon. According to reconnaissance data, the Azerbai?anis are 
bringing in fresh forces to the other sectors of the war front.

  [Text] Stepanakert, January 29 (SNARK) -- The press-service

About half past three the Azerbaijani jets bombarded the suburbs 
of Stepanakert. 
  "I consider wrong and unacceptable these actions of the

provocation aiming to fail the intermediary efforts of Russia. 
  Today morning Kazimirov has left Stepanakert.

  [Text] Russia's plan on the settlement of the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict envisages the involvement of Russian 
troops as a separating force, the foreign minister of the 
self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Arkadiy Gukasyan said 
at a press conference in Stepanakert on Friday. 
  He said that in other aspects Russia's plans did not differ 
from the plan proposed by the CSCE Minsk group. 
  Gukasyan said that during his recent meeting in Moscow with 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev they failed to reach 
full agreement because the Karabakh side made a number of 
important remarks. 
  However, according to the Karabakh minister, after the 
discussion of these remarks with the Russian ambassador at Large 
Vladimir Kazimirov, eventually they were taken into account. 
  Gukasyan expressed hope that the discussion of Russia's plan 
with Kazimirov, who left for Yerevan on Friday and then will go 
to Stepanakert, would also be held in a constructive atmosphere. 
  In the meantime, the press secretary of the Armenian 
president Aram Abramian said in an interview with Interfax that 
Armenia welcomes Russia's peaceful initiative.

  [Text] Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic Mr. Arkadiy Gukasyan had a press conference in 
Stepanakert. With regard (?of) the following he stressed: The 
last proposal of the Russian Federation does not contradict with 
the program of the European Council regarding the regulation of 
the Karabakh conflict. This is an attempt to find means that can 
really function. 
  This press conference was devoted to the results of the 
visit 
of the minister to France, Yugoslavia, and Russia. As to the 
position of Iran, the minister said that they are greatly 
worried by the fact that military actions take place (?there in 
their territory as well. The government has long activated its 
role in the solving of the problem.) 
  It is possible that ambassador of special assignment of the 
Russian Federation Kazimirov will visit Karabakh. During his 
press conference Minister of Foreign Affairs of Karabakh, 
Arkadiy Gukasyan, said that Kazimirov should visit Baku and 
Yerevan, as well (?intending) to discuss other ways out of the 
Karabakh problem. According to the last proposal of Russia, it 
is expected that Russian detachments will be stationed in the 
occupied region. The Azeri side confirmed [word indistinct] 
this idea which has been already discussed in Moscow with the 
participation of all the sides. In all probability the visit of 
Kazimirov is connected with the working out of the last variant 
of the proposal.

  [Text] Several local and foreign journalists met with a 
group of Armenian prisoners of war at the officers' mess today. 
The Armenians were captured by the Azerbaijani military forces 
while they transported military equipment, arms, and fuel from 
Armenia to Kelbadzhar. Defense Ministry representatives 
Mir-Vahid Feyzullayev and Dzhingiz Mamedov, Foreign Ministry 
representatives Vagif [name indistinct] and Zabit Tokerly, and 
Ministry of National Security representative Mir-Salih Akhundov 
addressed the meeting and briefed the journalists on the 
documents and maps seized from the prisoners. Later, the 
prisoners voluntarily addressed the journalists. 
  Only three of the five prisoners participated in the 
meeting. 
Their names are: Ashot Grigoryan, Stepan Gevorgyan, and Razmik 
Grigoryan. Ashot Grigoryan studied in the Higher Party School 
in Baku for five years. Gevorgyan has been a military 
servicemen in the Russian Army [as heard] since 1972. Razmik 
Grigoryan is a driver. The three prisoners are residents of 
Leninakan. 
  Ashot Grigoryan accused the Armenians of maintaining a 
two-faced policy. He said: We did not wish to fight. However, 
we were forced to do so. The war [words indistinct]. 
Consequently, we have had many deserters. The Armenian people 
took to the streets to voice their opposition against the 
government on the 17th and 18th of the month [not further 
specified]. However, the government officials obstructed their 
demonstration. Our situation is very serious. We do not have 
electricity. Although casualty reports are concealed from the 
people, we are aware that many of our troops have been killed. 
  On his part, Gevorgyan said: Russia supports not the 
Armenians but the Russian division, which is fighting in that 
region. 
  Asked by the journalists to reveal the source that supplies 
the material and fuel the Armenians need, Gevorgyan said: All 
that is acquired from Russia. We receive provisions and fuel 
from [word indistinct]. We acquire arms from Russia. 
  The journalists asked the prisoners several times when the 
Armenians will withdraw from Kelbadzhar and Karabakh. The three 
of them replied in the same way: Kelbadzhar belongs to 
Azerbaijan. We want to withdraw from that territory. All the 
Armenians support the idea of withdrawing from Kelbadzhar. 
However, Karabakh is a different question. Whether that 
territory belongs to us or to Azerbaijan has not yet been 
clarified. The historians are occupied with that problem. We 
have lived in this region. Our history tells us that Karabakh 
belongs to us. 
  That indicated the Armenian [words indistinct]. What else 
can we expect from the Armenians?

  [Text] Baku, January 29 (AZERTAC) -- In their report at 
yesterday's press-conference, a number of Armenian officers 
serving in the Russian Army adduced facts proving that not the 
Karabakh's defence forces but the Armenian armed forces were 
fighting on Azeri territory. The officers have been taken 
captives, when they tried to convey the 240 people Echmiadzin 
military unit from the Armenian city of Vardenis to the Azeri 
district of Kelbajar. 
  The captive officers (Asjpt Grigoriyan, Stepan Gevorkiyan 
and 
Razmik Grigoriyan) [names as received] are residents of the 
Armenian town of Gyumri (former Leninakan). Trying to prove 
?hat they were involved in a military operation for the first 
time, they said they wee peac?ful quartermasters of the 11233d 
Unit of the 127th Division of the Russian Army stationed in the 
town of Gyumri. Another evidence shown to journalists was the 
order of a commander-in-chief of the Armenian armed forces. The 
Russian battalion of the 9th Fortified Area marching from 
Echmiadzin to Kelbajar got an order to guard the road to the 
gold fields and to wait for the coming of the 7th Fortified Area 
troops, the document says. 
  The captives called on their compatriots to stop the war of 
conquest. This war is necessary to those who are in power in 
Armenia. The people of Armenia do not want to wage war. 
According to the officers, hushing people's indignation up, 
Armenian authorities are ?rying to conceal the truth from the 
world.

  In a recent statement to the HABER SERVICE NEWS AGENCY 
correspondent, Azerbaijan's plenipotentiary representative in 
Moscow said that Azerbaijan's leaders will not agree to hold 
talks while Armenian military forces remain in Azerbaijan.

<F P=106> [Mekhman Gafarly report under the "Talks" rubric: "Armenia </F>
and Azerbaijan Presidents' Meeting Postponed. New Date for it 
Not Defined Yet"] 
  [Text] The meeting scheduled for 25 January in Moscow 
between the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan and mediated by 
the Russian president did not take place. According to V. 
Kazimirov, special representative of the Russian Federation 
president and head of the Russian peacemaking mission for the 
settlement of the Karabakh conflict, new dates for the meeting 
have not been defined yet. The Russian diplomat thinks that 
"meetings at such a level should be prepared in the most 
thorough way" and "unless preparations that would ensure a 
certain success of the summit are complete, it is premature to 
speak about concrete dates." 
  Until then, the mediators continue their efforts, the sides 
voice new proposals on resolving the Armenia-Azerbaijan 
conflict. Rakhman Mustafazade, an official in the Azerbaijan 
president's staff, has named the main principles of Baku's 
approach to this problem. First, the withdrawal of Armenian 
troops from the occupied territories and the creation of 
guarantees for the safe living of the Armenian and Azeri 
population of Nagorno-Karabakh. Second, the repealing by 
Yerevan of all illegal constitutional acts and documents that 
describe Nagorno-Karabakh as belonging to Armenia. Third, the 
preservation of the cultural appearance of the occupied 
territories of Azerbaijan, i.e., the renouncing by Yerevan of 
the policy of destruction of monuments of history and culture of 
the Azerbaijan people in Karabakh. In Mustafazade's view, the 
Yerevan officials' dragging out of the peace process within the 
CSCE framework promotes the actual legalization of Armenia's 
territorial claims. 
  To all appearances, Azerbaijan will hardly talk at all, 
having bet on a military solution to the question. The Azeri 
Army is strong enough today. Besides, Baku feels a weakening of 
the Armenian Army that began after a series of major defeats. 
  Armenian generals, too, admit this weakening. On the radio 
24 January, Major General Arkadiy Ter-Tadevosyan, a directorate 
chief of Armenia's Defense Ministry, stated that "Today the 
country is in no position to deliver an appreciable retaliatory 
strike at Azerbaijan, which has been in recent days increasingly 
encroaching on Armenia's borders."

  [Excerpts] Republic President Geydar Aliyev today received 
the members of the Azerbaijani Cultural Society in Turkey. 
  [Begin recording] [Kamal Serveroglu] The president opened 
the 
meeting by saying that Azerbaijan belongs to all Azerbaijanis, 
regardless of where they live. He then welcomed the members of 
the Azerbaijani Cultural Society in Turkey Muhamed Cemberli, 
Ahmet Karaca, and Mehmet (Mustek). He stressed the importance 
of the work being done by the Society. [Words indistinct] 
Geydar Aliyev also noted that the relations between Azerbaijan 
and Turkey are friendly and fraternal by the will of the two 
peoples. The Azerbaijani president expressed the conviction 
that his upcoming visit to Turkey will open a new phase in 
relations between these two countries. 
  In expressing full agreement with the president's views, the 
members of the Azerbaijani Cultural Society in Turkey said that 
they appreciate Geydar Aliyev's decision to mark the 100th 
birthday anniversary of Mamet Emin Rasulzade, the founder of the 
Azerbaijani Democratic Republic, at the state level. [passage 
omitted] 
  In giving an in-depth briefing to the guests on the 
political 
and economic processes in the Republic, President Aliyev 
particularly dwelled on the harm inflicted by the bloody war 
being waged against the Armenian aggressors. He explained 
Azerbaijan's position to achieve peace. 
  [Geydar Aliyev] We are waging a war against Armenia. The war 
was not started by us. It was Armenia that started the war 
against Azerbaijan. We have not occupied even an inch of 
Armenia's land. But, Armenia has occupied Azerbaijan's lands. 
Therefore, our war is a just war. We are defending ourselves. 
We want to liberate our lands. We want to liberate them 
peacefully, that is, through talks. I have repeatedly said that 
we want to achieve this peacefully on the sole condition that 
the Armenian troops leave all the Azerbaijani lands. Once the 
Armenian troops leave, we could hold other talks. 
  [Serveroglu] The guests said they share President Geydar 
Aliyev's views and added that the Azerbaijani Cultural Society 
in Turkey is taking steps in this direction. 
  Other issues were also discussed at the end of the meeting. 
  Vafa Gulizade, state adviser on international affairs, took 
part in the meeting. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Aydyn Mekhtiyev under the "Conflict" rubric: </F>
"Baku's Military Successes Concern Russia. Moscow Thinks It Is 
Time for Azerbaijan To Stop"] 
  [Text] The foreign ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and 
Armenia are scheduled to meet early next week in Moscow. Your 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned this from sources 
at the Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry. It is expected that the 
negotiators will continue to discuss the Russian plan for a 
peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. So 
far, the Russian side has not managed to have all parties to the 
conflict approve the plan: Yerevan and Khankendi (Stepanakert) 
backed Moscow's initiative in principle, but the Baku 
authorities set a precondition for approving the peace plan. In 
particular, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov ruled out 
a constructive dialogue with the Armenian side until the 
republic's occupied territories are liberated. It is precisely 
this demand that caused a postponement of the meeting of the 
Russian, Azerbaijani, and Armenian presidents scheduled for 25 
January. No new date for the summit has so far been announced. 
  Notably, Moscow's call on the conflicting parties 
immediately 
to cease fire along the entire front line came at a time when 
the Azerbaijani Army regained the initiative for the first time 
in many months and managed to advance significantly along the 
northern and southern axes. In January, Azerbaijan 
reestablished control over settlements in Agdara and Kelbadzhar 
districts, which had earlier been occupied by Armenian units, 
and also a highway from Agdara to Ter-Ter and Kelbadzhar. 
Moreover, according to preliminary reports from the combat 
zone, in the past few days Azerbaijani troops came close to the 
Kelbadzhar-Lachin road. In the front's southern sector, an 
offensive on Fizuli, a district center, continues. To all 
appearances, Yerevan and Khankendi did not expect a large-scale 
offensive from the Azerbaijani side. According to the 
Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, military units made up primarily 
of undertrained recruits were urgently moved from Armenia to the 
combat area. Despite that, the Armenian side continues to 
retreat. 
  Azerbaijan's military successes have drastically boosted 
President Geydar Aliyev's approval rating, and currently it is 
clear that Aliyev's New Year promise to the nation that all the 
occupied territories will be liberated within a few months was 
based on the head of state's firm confidence in the national 
army's ability to carry out offensive operations. While 
officials in Moscow and Yerevan keep speculating about how 
Aliyev managed to strengthen his army within so short a time, 
the Baku authorities keep silent and do not rush to deny reports 
carried by a whole range of Russian publications that the bulk 
of the revitalized army is made up of Afghan mujahidin. 
Moscow's urgent appeal to stop combat operations has presented 
the Azerbaijani leader with a difficult dilemma: Either to make 
concessions and to agree to negotiate with the Armenian side, or 
to ignore Russian diplomatic pressure. In the former case 
Aliyev risks losing support of the republic's population; in the 
latter he might force Moscow to look for different methods of 
pressure on the current Azerbaijani leadership.

  [Text] Baku, January 28 (AZERTAC)--Though the Azeri 
National Army has succeeded in the war within last weeks, 
Azerbaijan more often turns to possibility of continuation of 
talks on resolution of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. This 
paradoxical aspiration has a logic of its own: the faster the 
conflict will be settled the fewer people will die. Besides, 
the Republic will be able to reform the economy and solve the 
basic social problems. 
  The Republic authorities policy is based on these factors.? 
President Aliyev has emphasized the main direction of it at his 
recent meeting with one of the units of the National Army. 
According to him, peace could be achieved on condition that 
Armenian troops withdraw immediately from occupied Azeri 
territory. This will create a basis for thorough negotiations 
on resolution of the conflict. The president is sure that 
cessation of hostilities as well as restoration of relationships 
between Azerbaijan and Armenia are to be discussed at the talks 
in order to prevent possibility of a new conflict between the 
two neighbors in the future. 
  Meanwhile, Azeri analysts take guesses at reasons for 
postponement of Moscow negotiations between Azerbaijani and 
Armenian high officials, which was expected to be held with 
participation of the Russian president. According to them, a 
coordinated Russian and Armenian plan on resolution of the 
problem will be proposed to Azerbaijan. The plan in particular 
specifies that the Armenian party will withdraw its troops from 
territory seized beyond Nagorno-Karabakh provided Azerbaijan 
allows Russian peace-keeping ?roops to be stationed in the war 
zone. The Minsk Conference of t?e CSCE is charged to determine 
exactly the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Though authorities of Azerbaijan have not yet expressed 
their 
attitude to this matter, Azerbaijan can hardly accept this plan 
if Armenians and Russians should propose it. Azerbaijan has 
repeatedly stated that Armenian Armed Forces must be withdrawn 
without any preliminary terms in accordance with the UN Security 
Council's resolutions. In this context, the Azerbaijani party 
considers recent military success of the National Army a 
guarantee of a beginning of Armenian troops withdrawal. As for 
the status of the conflict region, the Azerbaijani party is 
ready to discuss this matter within frames of an international 
organization but considers that the last word must belong to 
Azerbaijan. 
  According to another version, spread by some local 
newspapers 
with reference to word of Ramiz Rizayev, the plenipotentiary of 
Azerbaijan in Russia, the Moscow meeting is postponed because a 
document on complete and unconditional withdrawal of all the 
Armenian Armed Forces from territory of Azerbaijan has not yet 
been prepared. The Azeri party will come to the negotiating 
table as soon as this agreement is signed, the plenipotentiary 
said. According to his intensive consultations in order to work 
out this agreement are going on. It is expected that, Foreign 
Minister Gasan Gasanov will soon visit the Russian capital by 
this reason. 
  Meanwhile, many analysts stress that the Azerbaijani 
leadership will ask Russia to mediate between the two sides. 
  An appeal to ask for mediating effort of only one state may 
result in serious problem in future, says the opposition, mainly 
the Popular [People's] Front, meaning that Russia could 
strengthen its control over the Transcaucasian region. 
According to them, the political resolution of the conflict 
must be carried out with assistance of international 
organization.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 31 Jan -- Russia has proposed a new 
cease-fire in all areas of Nagorno-Karabakh, lasting for at 
least 2-3 weeks, from 1 February. A Russian Foreign Ministry 
source said today that the new Russian proposal was recently 
passed to President Geydar Aliyev of the Azerbaijan Republic, 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan of the Republic of Armenia, and to 
Robert Kocharyan, the Nagorno- Karabakh leader, by Vladimir 
Kazimirov, special representative of the president of the 
Russian Federation. 
  Depending on the replies received additional steps will be 
taken to bring about an end to the hostilities in Karabakh. A 
meeting of the warring parties in Moscow this week cannot be 
ruled out. 
  Bloody fighting, with fluctuating success, has been taking 
place around Nagorno-Karabakh since the second half of December 
last year. Several thousand people have already died as a 
result. Thousands more have been wounded, mostly among the 
attackers. The new escalation of hostilities is all the more 
pointless, the Russian Foreign Ministry source notes, in that 
the leaders of all the warring parties acknowledge that the 
conflict cannot be solved by force, and are calling for a 
political settlement. This relapse into bloodshed, the source 
considers, is seriously impeding the peacemaking efforts of 
Russia and international organizations. 
  Russia is striving, as an intermediary, to bring the warring 
parties' positions closer together, to persuade them to sign an 
agreement on ending the armed confrontation as soon as possible, 
and not to allow the destabilization of the region as a whole. 
In the second half of December 1993, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev held meetings in Moscow with Gasan Gasanov and 
Vahan Papzyan, the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia, 
and with Arkadiy Gukasyan, a representative of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh leadership.

  [Text] Baku, January 29 (TURAN) -- Yesterday afternoon, the 
Milli Mejlis, for the third time over the past two weeks 
conducted hearings dealing with the January events of 1990 that 
resulted in the Russian troop invasion of Baku. During those 
three sessions, it has become abundantly clear that the present 
leadership and the opposition have different approaches to these 
matters. 
  President Aliyev and his team stress that "only the former 
leaders of Azerbaijan bear the responsibility for bringing 
Russian forces in Baku which led to over 100 deaths and many 
hundreds wounded among the peaceful population". In connection 
with this, the following names were recalled: Abdurahman 
Vezirov, the former First Secretary of Communist Party of 
Azerbaijan; Ayaz Mutalibov, ex-Chairman of the Council of 
Ministers and then Azerbaijani President; and Vagif Huseynov, 
ex-Chairman of KGB of Azerbaijan. 
  The opposition deputies see the present leadership as 
"trying 
to conceal Moscow's policy towards Azerbaijan". First Deputy 
Chairman of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan [PFA], Ibrahim 
Ibrahimli said that "the present-day leadership's hearings are 
politically motivated". The present-day leadership fights with 
their political opponents, ex-President Ayaz Mutalibov and the 
leaders of the PFA. 
  According to Ibrahimli, "the military June uprising in Ganja 
in 1993, like the Russian troop invasion into Baku on January 
19-20, 1990, is the handiwork of one and the same force". The 
opposition deputies reminded us that "69 volumes of the inquiry 
concerning the January events" are in Moscow and Russia is not 
hurrying to give t?em back. According to the opposition, "one 
cannot objectively assess the developments of January 20, 1990 
without examining those and other missing documents". 
  No final resolution has been adopted at yesterday's session. 
The deputies voted for the creation of a special Commission 
into the Investigation of the Events of January 20, 1990. 
Parliamentary hearings dealing with this topic will be 
continued.

  [Text] Moscow January 30 TASS -- Georgian leader Eduard 
Shevarnadze emphasised the importance of the forthcoming visit 
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Georgia scheduled for 
February 3, saying that the establishment of normal relations 
with Russia is a matter of vital importance. 
  During the visit a whole package of documents is expected to 
be signed. The most important document is, undoubtedly, a 
treaty on friendship, good-neighbourly relations and 
cooperation. A number of intergovernmental agreements are 
expected to be signed, including an agreement on trade and 
economic cooperation for 1994 and an agreement on free trade 
between the two countries. The agreement envisages that trade 
and economic cooperation between the two countries will be 
carried out taking into account the development of market 
relations on the basis of a direct agreement between economic 
subjects and regardless of their forms of property and 
subordination. 
  An agreement on free trade provides for the establishment of 
a single market of goods, services and work force and creating 
conditions for the formation of the customs union between the 
two countries. The agreement outlines main principles of trade 
regulations between the two countries, including customs duties, 
and export and import taxes. 
  Agreements are ready to be signed on such important problems 
as a status and conditions for the operation of Russian border 
guard troops on the Georgian territory, principles of 
cooperation and mutual relations in the sphere of transport, 
international traffic and merchant navigation, the coordination 
of the railways, problems of migration and the defence of 
resettlers' rights.

  [Text] Today in the parliament session hall, head of state 
Eduard Shevardnadze heard information about the measures taken 
by the law enforcement bodies during the period of the state of 
emergency in the republic. 
  Jaba Ioseliani, the chairman of emergency situations; 
Parliament Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze; Prime Minister Otar 
Patsatsia; ministers, administrators, and representatives of 
force departments were present at the session. 
  The session was conducted in a businesslike and interesting 
manner. Full information about the session will be broadcast in 
the near future. 
  We would like to stress the unanimous opinion of the session 
participants: That a lot has been done in the republic for 
establishing order. 
  [Begin Shevardnadze recording] After they [Russian 
officials] 
had noticed these tendencies [of improving the criminal 
situation in Georgia], a decision was made that Russian 
President Yeltsin visit Georgia in the near future. I would 
like to say that in ancient Russian-Georgian relations, this 
event is the most significant one. Russian Emperors used to 
visit Georgia, our representatives also used to visit Russia, 
and you know how they would reach Russia, some would fail 
altogether; Soviet leaders used to visit Georgia and there would 
be a celebration but then it was still a visit to a colony and a 
periphery. 
  Now, the leader of one of the world's greatest countries is 
going to visit independent Georgia, an independent country. The 
greatest acknowledgement for Georgia's independence is a visit 
by the Russian president and his emphasizing this fact. 
  Georgia has a lot to tell, her needs are plenty, and there 
are many problems that cannot be resolved without Russia, we 
have already made sure that they cannot be resolved [without 
Russia]. Therefore, it is our essential goal to establish 
good-neighborly, friendly and kind relations with Russia. I am 
grateful to President Yeltsin for -- if I am not mistaken his 
birthday is on 3 February -- having chosen this very day for 
visiting this friendly country, to meet these friendly people, 
and greet them the way a representative of a great country 
should. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] Abkhazia's Prime Minister Sokrat Dzhindzholia has 
declared that a comprehensive Russian-Georgian treaty to be 
signed in Tbilisi on February 3 runs counter to Moscow's 
previous pledge not to sign such a document before a full 
settlement is reached in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
  "Georgia takes advantage of such signing today to prepare 
military actions against Abkhazia and South Ossetia," 
Dzhindzholia said answering a question from Interfax at a news 
conference in Sukhumi on Friday. 
  In his words, Georgia is actively preparing for war, which 
is 
evident from recent events on its border with Abkhazia (he may 
have meant Georgia's attempt to land a force in Abkhazia's Gal 
region on January 25 - IF). 
  For this reason, to his judgement, there is nothing more 
important now than to deploy peace-keepers on the border between 
Abkhazia and Georgia. In his words, the UN Security Council may 
pass the final decision on the issue within a day or two. 
  On the possibility of refugees returning to the republic, 
Dzhindzholia stressed the need for caring first of all about 
those who live in Abkhazia now and only then speak about the 
refugees' return. 
  He reported that the economic sanctions imposed on Abkhazia 
by Russia at the end of last September had only been eased 
rather than drooped altogether. "Paradoxically," Dzhindzholia 
remarked, "even though Russia signed in Geneva a document with 
an appeal to the world community to help Abkhazia, it has never 
lifted its economic sanctions against the republic."

  [Text] An idea that it would be impossible to establish 
order in the republic without the use of foreign forces, in 
particular, Russian troops, has recently taken root among the 
public. In this connection, the deputy commander in chief of 
the Russian troops in Transcaucasia, General Vasiliy Terchenko 
has stated the following. 
  It is totally groundless to talk about this. Russian army 
units are not intended for this purpose. Moreover, I firmly 
believe that the Georgian Interior Ministry has enough forces to 
solve this problem on its own. 
  On the issue of Russian army units' possible peacekeeping 
role in the conflict settlement in Abkhazia and the 
participation of troops under his authority in this operation, 
the general said the following. 
  Let us not overtake the events. However, I think that this 
is how this issue will be decided and our units will be among 
other Russian troops taking part in it. Therefore, the number 
of our units in Georgia will increase accordingly. This and the 
issue of bringing Russian troops [currently] in Abkhazia under 
our authority must be solved at a governmental level. It will 
probably be decided during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
visit to Georgia.

<F P=106> ["Communique on the Second Round of Negotiations Between the </F>
Georgians and Abkhazians in Geneva" signed on 13 January] 
  [Text] The second round of negotiations on a full-scale 
regulation of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict took place in 
Geneva on 11-13 January 1994 under the aegis of the UN and with 
the assistance of Russia and the participation of 
representatives of the CSCE and the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees. 
  The negotiations proceeded in accordance with Security 
Council Resolutions 849 of 9 July 1993, 854 of 6 August 1993, 
858 of 24 August 1993, 876 of 9 October 1993, 881 of 4 November 
1993, and 892 of 22 December 1993. 
  It was pointed out that the provisions of the Memorandum of 
Understanding of 1 December 1993 were, in the main, being 
implemented. 
  There has been an exchange of prisoners in accordance with 
the principle "all for all." 
  Representatives of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
have 
organized the first preparatory trip in order to discuss the 
possibility of the voluntary return of refugees and displaced 
persons to their permanent places of residence. 
  The number of international observers in the conflict zone 
is 
being increased. 
  On 15-16 December 1993, a meeting of a group of experts 
working out recommendations on the political status of Abkhazia 
was held in Moscow in which representatives of the sides 
involved in the conflict, the UN, and the Russian Federation and 
a CSCE observer participated. 
  At the same time, it was pointed out that, in separate 
rayons 
in the conflict zone, armed groups that were not subject to any 
control had carried out combat actions, which had brought 
renewed suffering upon a part of the population. 
  Work has not yet begun on searching for persons missing 
without trace and reburying the dead. 
  During the second round of negotiations in Geneva, the sides 
emphasized that efforts aimed at achieving a full-scale 
regulation of the conflict as soon as possible should be 
continued. 
  1. The sides again confirm that they will fulfill the 
obligations placed upon them without the use of force and the 
threat of the use of force against one another. 
  2. The sides have agreed that the creation of favorable 
conditions for the further promotion of the process of a 
political settlement and the practical implementation of the 
agreements that have been reached will contribute to the 
implementation of a full- scale operation to maintain peace in 
Abkhazia. They have appealed to the UN Security Council, 
requesting that, when it discusses again the activities of the 
mission of UN observers in Georgia, it widens its mandate 
accordingly, in particular, that this mission be entrusted with 
ensuring that there is no resumption of hostilities in the 
conflict zone. The sides have again stated that they support 
the deployment of UN peacekeeping forces or other forces 
sanctioned by the UN in the conflict zone. They have expressed 
their consent to the use of a Russian Federation military 
contingent in such forces. 
  In accordance with a decision of the UN Security Council, 
following the deployment of additional international observers 
in the conflict zone and the arrival of peacekeeping forces, the 
sides will withdraw over the course of five days all armed 
formations along with their weapons and combat equipment from 
the Inguri River and other possible areas of active 
confrontation in the conflict zone that will be determined by 
the command of the peacekeeping forces and the mission of UN 
observers in Georgia in coordination with the sides and, at the 
same time, international observers and peacekeeping forces will 
enter the zone that has been created. 
  Volunteer formations and individuals who have come to take 
part in the conflict are to be disarmed and withdrawn and 
international observers will be allowed to carry out inspections 
at crossing points along the Psou River. 
  The sides request the UN Security Council to strengthen the 
international civilian presence in the conflict zone, which 
necessitates the deployment of appropriate civilian specialists 
there who will contribute to the resolution of the refugee 
problem and other humanitarian questions. 
  3. It is the view of the sides that a special voluntary fund 
created under the aegis of the UN will contribute to the 
accomplishment of the task of regulating the situation. 
  4. The sides will continue to elaborate a quadrilateral 
agreement on the voluntary return and repatriation of refugees 
and forcibly displaced persons to Abkhazia. 
  The sides have agreed to create a special commission for 
refugees that will be made up of representatives of the sides, 
the UN, and Russia and that will begin work on 25 January 1994. 
  The sides have agreed to start the process of the gradual 
return of refugees and forcibly displaced persons to Abkhazia on 
10 February and Gali rayon has been named as the first stage [in 
this process]. The sides will make every effort to ensure the 
safety of the refugees, forcibly displaced persons, and the 
personnel taking part in this operation. The Abkhazian side is 
to bear primary responsibility for receiving and protecting the 
refugees and forcibly displaced persons and also the 
aforementioned personnel. In addition, the sides request the UN 
and the Russian Federation to assist in creating a safe 
situation, which will facilitate the return of refugees and 
forcibly displaced persons. 
  The sides pin their hopes on the effective assistance of the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees; in particular, on the 
temporary department of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
beginning work in the conflict zone in the near future. 
  5. The sides recognize that the main task is to achieve a 
full-scale political settlement of the conflict and every effort 
has to be made to this end. They have agreed to continue to 
discuss the problem of the political status of Abkhazia taking 
into account the interests of both sides. The next meeting of 
experts to discuss this question will be held in Moscow on 8 
February. Their report will be heard at the next meeting of the 
sides and sent to the UN and CSCE. 
  The UN, CSCE, and Russian Federation call upon the sides to 
be guided by the necessity of protecting the fundamental 
principles underlying the full-scale regulation of the 
situation: Protecting the territorial integrity of Georgia and 
completely safeguarding the interests of the entire 
multinational population of Abkhazia. 
  6. The sides have stated that they are interested in 
creating an international commission to promote economic 
recovery in Abkhazia with the participation of international and 
national organizations by 15 February of this year at the 
latest. Their primary task should be the reconstruction of 
vitally important installations, transport communications, 
airports, bridges, and tunnels. 
  7. The participants in the negotiations have agreed to hold 
the next meeting on 22 February 1994 either in Moscow or Geneva. 
  [Signed] On behalf of the Georgian side -- J. Ioseliani 
  On behalf of the Abkhazian side -- S. Jinjolia 
  With the participation of: 
  E. Brunner (on behalf of the UN); B. Pastukhov (on behalf of 
the Russian Federation); V. Manno (on behalf of the CSCE).

<F P=106> [Interview with Levon Khachatryan, Armenian temporary charge </F>
d'affaires in Georgia, by SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA correspondent Inga 
Abgarova; place and date not given: "Levon Khachatryan: `I 
Believe in the Wisdom of Our Two Peoples'"] 
  [Text] SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA dossier: Levon Khachatryan was 
born in 1956 in Tbilisi. He graduated from the Faculty of Art 
at the Art and Theatrical Institute in Yerevan. He worked in 
the Department for CIS Countries in the Armenian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. Since January 1993, he has been representing 
the interests of Armenia in Georgia. 
  [Abgarova]Sir, what is the specific nature of your work 
in Georgia? 
  [Khachatryan] The fact that, until recently, we were part of 
the same state is the first thing that leaves its mark on 
diplomatic relations between our states. Therefore, we have 
very many similar problems that are of an objective nature. At 
the same time, it is easy for me to work in Georgia because our 
peoples are tied by ancient and close bonds of friendship. My 
one aim is to strengthen those constructive relations that 
already exist. Unfortunately, the events of recent years have 
had an effect on these relations. One cannot forget the 
reaction of Armenians living in Georgia to, let us say, the 
incorrect policy conducted between one and one-half and two 
years ago by the former authorities in Georgia regarding all 
national minorities and Armenians in particular. I am happy 
that the policy of justice has emerged victorious. The recent 
measures aimed at restoring order in the Dmanisskiy and 
Marneulskiy rayons are clear confirmation of this. 
  [Abgarova]Traditional relations between our states were 
built on a mutually beneficial basis. How do matters stand 
today? 
  [Khachatryan] Yes, common sense and a realistic policy have 
always determined our relations with Georgia. After all, all 
Armenia's vital communications pass through the territory of 
Georgia and this is how all cargoes of strategic importance for 
us are transported. Although there are, of course, problems -- 
I have in mind the explosions along the gas pipelines and the 
railroad -- these can be resolved. Georgia's policy at this 
stage makes us hope for the better. We hope that Georgia's 
entry into the CIS will create that basis that, in future, will 
enable us to resolve all problems between our states. As 
regards economic relations between our countries, they bear a 
clear interstate character: The transportation of goods through 
the territory of Georgia is paid for by Armenia according to 
universally accepted prices. Of course, the shortage of 
electric power in Georgia is also having an effect on our lives. 
However, I repeat that all these problems can be resolved. All 
Armenia's potential can be useful for Georgia. First and 
foremost, this concerns shipments to and from Iran and Turkey. 
The railroad to Turkey runs through Armenia. 
  [Abgarova]How do you view the problem of the resolution 
of the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia? 
  [Khachatryan] First of all, I would not like to draw 
parallels between these conflicts. I have been in Abkhazia 
several times and I have many friends there. Therefore, I 
cannot view those events wholly as an impartial observer. 
Unlike in Abkhazia where autonomy existed in the full sense of 
this word and where the Abkhazian population, despite being in 
the minority, was not oppressed in any way, the Armenian people 
in Nagorno-Karabakh, who form the overwhelming majority of the 
population, were subjected to terrible suppression. There were 
no contradictions in Abkhazia that could not have been resolved 
and, in general, I believe that this conflict was inflated from 
the start and was somewhat artificial. I believe that this 
conflict can only be resolved by peaceful means and this is 
precisely what will happen. The most important thing in 
Nagorno- Karabakh at the moment is a cease-fire and a halt to 
the bloodshed. Nagorno-Karabakh's status will be determined by 
Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia will sign any document 
in this respect that will suit both sides equally. Of course, 
both sides will have to seek a compromise solution.

  According to sources in the Georgian Security Ministry, the 
bomb killed another 3 people and wounded several visitors nearby. 
  According to the ministry, that was not the first attempt to 
assassinate Talakhadze. Terrorist acts have previously been 
committed against him, however unsuccessfully.

  [Text] Moscow January 29 TASS -- A Georgian high-ranking 
official has reported the failure of the four-party agreement on 
the return of refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia. 
  The announcement was made by Sandro Kavsadze, Georgian 
leader 
Eduard Shevardnadze's envoy, after the talks with Abkhazia held 
at the Russian Foreign Ministry and mediated by a representative 
of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Friday. 
  "The Georgian side categorically refuses to differentiate 
between the refugees as to who took part in the war and who did 
not because the bloody conflict has involved almost the entire 
population, including Georgians, Abkhazians and other nations," 
Kavsadze said.

  [Text] Negotiators from Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia and the 
United Nations, meeting in Moscow on Friday, were unable to 
reach agreement on a plan for bringing refugees back to Abkhazia. 
  Georgia was represented at the talks, which lasted 16 hours, 
by Aleksandr Kavsadze, chairman of the Stet Committee on Ethnic 
Relations and Human Rights, Abkhazia by Andrey Dzhergenia, a 
special envoy of the parliamentary chairman. The negotiations 
were mediated by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov 
and a representative from the U.N. High Commission for Refugees. 
  Dzhergenia and Kavsadze told Interfax the quadrilateral 
agreement had not been signed due to disagreements on one of its 
clauses, that on the refugees' safety. 
  The Abkhazian side insisted that immunity do not apply to 
those refugees who had fought against "lawful Abkhazian 
authority." Kavsadze, however, said this formula would always 
make it difficult for refugees to return home and would legalize 
ethnic purges, for it "justifies those who fought against the 
Georgians and represents Georgians as criminals." 
  Dzhergenia said the plan could begin to be carried out after 
the agreement was signed, but the date set for it by the 
communique on the results of Georgian-Abkhazian talks held in 
Geneva on January 11-13 is February 10. 
  Kavdsadze believes the plan should start to be put into 
operation as soon as possible, for he fears the refugees may 
start coming back by themselves, which, he said, might lead to 
new bloodshed.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Simonyan under the "Georgia" rubric: "The </F>
Opposition Criticizes, Proposes, Demands. Tensions Grow as 
Yeltsin's Visit to Tbilisi Draws Near"] 
  [Text] The relative political calm in Tbilisi seems to be 
ending. The impression is that the government and the 
opposition "who retired to their corners" are preparing for a 
fresh "bout." Shortly before Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
visit, the council of one of the leading socialist parties had 
formulated and put forward its stance on the Abkhazia problem. 
As the Social Democrats, for example, see it, there are three 
ways to regain Abkhazia. First, by Eduard Shevardnadze's 
pressuring Russia with some help from Western politicians. 
Second, according to the parliamentary majority, the 
renunciation of all talks and the use of military force. Third, 
friendship with Russia and the regaining of Abkhazia using 
Russia's means. The third option is what constitutes the stance 
of Social Democrats on this question. 
  Such a point of view is also held by the majority of 
political parties that pin certain hopes on the settlement of 
relations with Russia precisely in connection with the upcoming 
visit. But the more radical forces in Georgia still remain 
supporters of a confrontation with Russia. The first among them 
is perhaps Boris Kakubava, a deputy of parliament, the leader of 
the organization "Liberation of Abkhazia." During a recent 
press conference he once again accused the Georgian Government 
of inaction. He assessed the Geneva talks as extremely negative 
and called upon the public, primarily refugees from Abkhazia, to 
stage protest actions against Russia's interference in Georgia's 
internal affairs in the course of the Abkhazia conflict and to 
blame Russia for defeat in the war. Irakliy Tsereteli, leader of 
the "National Independence of Georgia" party, made a similar 
statement. He thinks that President Yeltsin should know that 
there are forces in Georgia that are far from delighted with 
Russian policy toward Georgia. He calls upon the Georgian 
Government to come forward with a statement on the restoration 
of Georgia's jurisdiction in Abkhazia and in so-called South 
Ossetia. 
  In the meantime, Conservative-Monarchist Party chairman 
Temur 
Zhorzholiani declared that he welcomes Boris Yeltsin's visit in 
every way and that he is awaiting a constructive dialogue of the 
heads of the two states in whose course both political and 
economic problems would be settled. Incidentally, the number of 
such statements is considerably greater because it has finally 
become clear that Russia cannot be easily pressured, the forces 
are far from equal, and it is impossible to pass overnight from 
the sphere of Russian influence into the sphere of Western 
influence. Thus, the points of view of the government and those 
of the opposition have grown somewhat closer on this matter. 
  A conference of mainly opposition political organizations to 
which were invited representatives of nearly all parties and 
organizations of the republic, persons prominent in science and 
culture, was held in parliament hall yesterday. Eduard 
Shevardnadze, who did not attend, sent a written apology which 
seemed to have cooled the speakers' aggressive ardor a bit. But 
there was criticism galore. For example, Republican Ivlian 
Khaindrava stated that ever since the weakening of the communist 
regime in Georgia the signs of a power crisis, which was showing 
in varying degrees of acuteness under the old regime and which 
is showing under the present regime, have been starkly evident. 
This is to be explained, according to him, by the lack of a 
clear separation of powers between the legislative and the 
executive branches and by their failure to perform their own 
functions. As a result, virtually unlimited power is 
concentrated in the hands of one individual. A situation has 
taken shape in the country in which, according to Khaindrava, 
all questions starting from the problems of the Tbilisi zoo and 
ending with Georgia's joining the CIS are solved singlehanded by 
the head of state. 
  The speakers of virtually all opposition parties showed 
solidarity with the Republicans in this regard and in the 
supposition that the cabinet was unable to solve economic and 
financial problems and follow a purposeful policy in the area of 
economic reforms. Trying to explain the reasons for the 
economic failure during yesterday's parliament session, Prime 
Minister Otar Patsatsiya asked for another 10 days to study this 
problem. The time was sufficient, he thought, for a specially 
created commission to find the reason for the plunging of the 
coupon. 
  Many complaints about the head of state and the policy he 
follows were voiced by People's Fund of Georgia chairman Nodar 
Natadze. In his opinion, the current leadership had been 
artificially stoking up the atmosphere and deepening the crisis 
in which joining the CIS should appear the only way to save 
Georgia. The same is being done regarding the idea that is 
floating in the air about joining the ruble zone, which would 
deprive Georgia of one of the main trappings of an independent 
state --its own currency. Georgia's course toward Russia, 
Natadze stated, is nothing but an open recognition of the 
latter's diktat. But it should be noted that not only 
criticisms were voiced, but also constructive proposals on 
overcoming the crisis. Those gathered generally arrived at the 
conclusion that in order to get out of the situation that had 
taken shape it was necessary first and foremost to revise 
downward the powers of the head of state, to increase the role 
of parliament, and to create a cabinet able to at long last to 
work out and carry through economic reforms. Tough demands, no 
doubt about it. It is hard to say if Shevardnadze and the 
government agree on a compromise. This newly emerging situation 
too will perhaps become clearer during Boris Yeltsin's visit.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 29, BNS -- Russian Ambassador to 
Estonia Alexandr Trofimov yesterday delivered to President 
Lennart Meri Russian President Boris Yeltsin's reply to Meri's 
letter of Jan. 5. 
  The president's press service informs that Yeltsin's letter 
touches on problems which so far haven't found a solution during 
the Estonian-Russian negotiations, and expresses hope that a 
mutually acceptable solution will be arrived at in the near 
future. 
  This puts back on the agenda an Estonian-Russian summit 
preparations for which were made last autumn, the president's 
press service told BNS.

  [Text] As requested by the Estonian delegation, the Russian 
delegation will hand over a detailed plan for the Russian troop 
withdrawal from Estonia, from January to August 1994, during the 
talks round on 1 and 2 [dates as heard] February. This was said 
by Vasiliy Svirin, leader of the Russian talks delegation. 
  According to Svirin, the plan details when one or another 
unit will depart and how many men are in it. Another incident 
of Russia voluntarily accommodating Estonia's requests will 
hopefully urge the Estonian delegation toward constructive 
steps, Svirin said. 
  As already reported, the Russian side presented a general 
troop withdrawal schedule to Estonia during the previous round 
of talks at the end of last year, at Lohusalu in Estonia. In 
Svirin's opinion Estonia recently tried to conclude a short 
protocol which covers only a deadline and a schedule for the 
troop withdrawal instead of a basic agreement on the troop 
withdrawal and their temporary presence. Svirin emphasized that 
such an attitude is not acceptable because several issues 
concerning the Russian troops' presence, withdrawal, and 
property would thus remain unresolved. 
  Russia looks kindly, and with readiness to cooperate, on 
Vaino Reinart's appointment as the new leader of the Estonian 
delegation, Svirin said. As is known, Reinart claimed on 20 
January at the Council of Europe meeting in Strasbourg that 
Russia [words indistinct] and is not particularly worried about 
human rights protection. Svirin emphasized that such claims are 
the fantasies of Estonian politicians' . 
  This was reported by the BALTIC NEWS SERVICE.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 28, BNS -- The officials of the former 
Russian police station in Paldiski yesterday handed over to 
Estonian authorities only part of the documents they held. 
Under a previous agreement, they were supposed to deliver by 
Jan. 27 the complete register of the town's residents as well 
as the car register. 
  Town secretary Taimi Laar informs that the Russian officials 
surrendered only the registration forms for new arrivals and 
departing residents which, however, don't suffice to make up a 
complete register of the town's population. 
  Estonian Justice Minister Kaido Kama earlier claimed the 
register kept by the Russian police cannot be trusted and a new 
register will have to be made up. Local elections cannot be 
held in Paldiski until the residents have been registered. 
  Russian officials don't intend to hand over the car register 
any time soon. They insist the issue be put on the agenda of 
talks between the two countries. In Laar's opinion, Russians 
try to put off handing over the documents because many stolen 
cars are registered in Paldiski.

  [Text] Vilnius January 29 TASS --"The Lithuanian foreign 
policy is aimed at avoiding creating new tensions," Lithuanian 
Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys told the newspaper EKHO LITVY 
(Lithuania's Echo) on Saturday. 
  "The main task is to prevent the emergence of red lines of 
confrontation on the map of relations between Lithuania and 
other states, including Russia. It is necessary to note that 
Russia's fears connected with the singing by representatives of 
Lithuania and NATO of an agreement within the context of the 
Partnership for Peace programme are groundless. The more so 
because Russia itself is taking an active part in the process of 
NATO expansion and, probably, will join the all-European 
security system," the minister said.

  [Text] Ceslovas Jursenas, Chairman of Lithuania's Seimas 
(parliament) believes that the Partnership for Peace agreement 
between his country and the North Atlantic Alliance cannot be 
praised too highly. 
  He said so in an interview with Interfax on Friday when he 
commented on the signing of documents on Lithuania's joining the 
program by President Algirdas Brazauskas in Brussels the day 
before. 
  Jursenas did not think that Lithuania would be accepted into 
NATO soon. He believes that "the two sides should meet each 
other halfway" if the North Atlantic Alliance was to expand. In 
his view, NATO itself should be prepared to incorporate Central 
and East European nations. 
  On the other hand, Jursenas argued, those who want to join 
NATO should meet certain requirements. By joining the 
Partnership for Peace program, Lithuania has made serious 
commitments. 
  "This will be a process which can take years, not weeks or 
months," Jursenas emphasized. 
  The speaker said that even though Partnership for Peace did 
not provide any unambiguous guarantees of Lithuania's security 
by NATO, the very fact of closer cooperation with the North 
Atlantic Alliance would reassure his country if its 
independence, sovereignty, and integrity were threatened. This, 
in turn, would contribute to stability in the Baltic area, 
Europe, and the world. 
  "Lithuania's desire to integrate into Europe's political and 
economic structures and collective security system is in no way 
hostile to Russia or any other country," Jursenas emphasized, 
and added that it would be desirable that Lithuania's neighbors 
also join Partnership for Peace. 
  "This would be beneficial to the region, the continent, and 
the world," Jursenas believes.

  [Text] Vladislovas Domarkas, Lithuanian first deputy 
foreign minister stated that the negotiations with Russia on the 
state borders were very difficult. 
  According to the deputy minister, he had the impression 
after 
yesterday's meeting of experts that Russia was attempting to 
delay the negotiations. The mood is not very optimistic, 
Domarkas said in an interview with a Baltic News Service 
correspondent today before the continuation of the negotiations. 
  The Lithuanian and Russian commissions on the delimitation 
and demarcation of the state borders are headed by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Domarkas and (Gary Chmikhov), the first deputy 
head of the Kaliningrad region administration. In the meeting 
in Vilnius, a great deal of attention is being paid to problems 
of the marine border. The negotiators are today dealing with a 
project prepared by the Lithuanian Geodesic Service. 
  Domarkas thinks that disagreements on the marine border are 
stipulated both by economic interests and by psychological 
standpoints. According to him, the deposit on the [word 
indistinct] shelf has influence, too, as both sides have a claim 
to it. The head of the Lithuanian commission agrees that both 
sides propose at the negotiations their maximal projects but, 
according to him, this is customary in [word indistinct] 
practice. 
  The Lithuanian side hoped to complete the negotiations in 
Vilnius on the land state border, but Russian negotiators stated 
that Moscow had not yet evaluated the previously agreed draft 
agreement. The next meeting on the Lithuanian and Russian state 
border should take place in Moscow in a month's time. The 
negotiators hope that agreements on the borders will be signed 
and will come into force this year.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 28, BNS -- Russia has already restored 
a military union of former Soviet republics without even 
concealing its expansionistic and imperialistic intents, the 
leader of the Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition said. 
  Vytautas Landsbergis said in a statement circulated Friday 
that Russia tries to preserve its military bases in Latvia and 
wants to inveigle Lithuania into a post-Soviet union. 
  To attain its goals, he said, Russia employs the imaginary 
need for a huge army in its Kaliningrad region, as well "the 
weakness and the conformity of the current Lithuanian 
leadership," and pressures it to sign an agreement on Russian 
military transit through Lithuanian territory. 
  The opposition leader said an agreement on military transit 
would give Russia if a better pretext to interfere, to accuse 
and to demand "rights" for itself, just like in 1940. Military 
transit would be a constant threat to Lithuanian independence. 
Landsbergis said the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party 
does not have any right to "step over" the June 8, 1992 
constitutional act that bars Lithuania from any post-Soviet 
unions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "To Refute, But Not To Retreat"] </F>
  [Text] Russia has two current politicians who are being 
discussed throughout the world. Even President B. Yeltsin, who 
is still defined as a democrat and whose accomplishments are 
constantly trumpeted to the world, as though remains in a 
shadow. Two names are mentioned most often -- Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy and Andrey Kozyrev. One can find many common 
issues in their recent statements: The Russian empire and its 
eternal interests, the misfortunes and offenses of the 
Russian-speaking population, blatant visions of the future, and 
plans to turn neighboring countries into the subordinates of the 
authoritarian Russia. 
  On Wednesday [19 January], a two-day meeting ended in Moscow 
where Russian envoys to the CIS and Baltic states had discussed 
foreign policy in the "near abroad countries" together with 
officials from the Russian Foreign Ministry and other 
institutions. Having not even reached the middle, the meeting 
became odious and was commented throughout the world, while the 
reaction of the Baltic states was harsh and angry, which is a 
rare case. The response of our foreign minister was 
unbelievably fast, although previously he had required several 
days for such a move. His reply notes those statements in the 
speeches of the Russian foreign minister which are unacceptable 
to Lithuania. A. Kozyrev demonstrates imperial fists quite 
often, and it would be naive to expect that all this is done 
without B. Yeltsin's knowledge. Everyone remembers A. Kozyrev's 
speech in Stockholm which astonished the world and was revoked 
later (did the minister joke?!). On Tuesday, he declared that 
the Russian Army cannot be withdrawn from the CIS states 
altogether, because enemy forces may penetrate into them. 
  All three Baltic states assessed the speech of the Russian 
foreign minister negatively. A. Kozyrev hurried to explain very 
efficiently that journalists of the official news agency who 
presented a twisted report to the public were to blame for 
everything. Such an act is as traditional as is demagogy in 
politics. Our politicians are equally fond of spreading various 
"sensational" statements abroad, and later accusing the local 
press for misinterpreting everything. 
  It would be too great an historical honor for A. Kozyrev to 
call him the new Machiavelli of diplomacy. This minister is an 
actor in the theater of politics, who in a real theater is given 
only one role -- to ask loudly on cue: "What would you like?" 
The new Russian parliament, where thus far fighting goes on 
only in the canteen, is likely to dictate the new rules of the 
game even now. The foreign minister also wants to retain his 
position. The president wants to find if not a way then at 
least a path between the right and left "hurrah patriots." 
  A. Kozyrev's refutations, which Moscow television broadcast 
so lavishly, may have hardly convinced anyone. We have heard 
too many promises. However, we have learned that the Russian 
Army would invade Latvia's territory within 15 minutes in case 
of necessity. Which part of A. Kozyrev's speech denies this 
Russian principle? There is always the word in the beginning. 
However, it would be good if it did not become the deed. The 
statements and assessments of our politicians are often similar 
to magicians' incantations that have to be translated into the 
Lithuanian language. During his visit to Lithuania, Estonian 
Prime Minister M. Laar put it straight that the external threat 
forced the Baltic states to unite. Lithuanian and Polish 
politicians noted at their meeting in Warsaw that there was a 
shadow of Russia's threat over both countries. It seems that 
the establishment of facts is a professional prerogative of 
historians. However, politicians have no foundation: The 
security concept is nowhere to be seen, and no one knows what 
the defense doctrine is like.... The negotiating delegation 
[with Russia] was disbanded, and its experts were deemed not 
politicians. The opposition engages in a passionate exposure of 
the idleness and lack of competence in the ruling force. The 
latter intimidates us with plotted coups and later explains that 
participants of the press conference misunderstood it. Seimas 
[parliament] deputies seem to have forgotten completely for what 
they have been elected, because the state's security and its 
positive development is not a priority to politicians who work 
at home. The most important issues for them are their own 
chairs and Seimas' internal problems while explaining political 
colors rather than the present and future of politics. 
  It is absolutely clear that A. Kozyrev's refutations do not 
mean changes in Russian policies. Russia will "defend" its 
tribesmen, particularly in the Baltic states, and penetrate 
toward "its interests," while we will dissipate incantations 
alone. The Estonian legislature proposed that the president and 
the government express their harsh protest to Russia. We 
decided to take advantage of a historical precedent. When 
Russia was trying to defeat the Tartars in the battle of 
Kulikov, there were two warriors in the beginning -- Russians 
and Tartars. We allowed two ministers -- A. Kozyrev and P. 
Gylys -- to fight each other. Will the nations remember them 
600 years later as well? 
  There is no evidence that the Russian foreign minister was 
encouraged by the U.S. President who had promised to support his 
country. However, was it not Bill Clinton who "induced" the 
events in Estonia's Russian-speaking part, when talk about 
citizenship and pensions emerged again. Was it not he who made 
the head of the delegation for negotiations with Estonia "sick" 
when the agreement on the deadline for the Russian Army 
withdrawal had already been drafted? It is yet unclear what 
unexpected events this might suggest to Lithuania. It would be 
good not to miss them while trying to clarify the situation.

  [Text] Vilnius January 30 TASS -- The Lithuanian Government 
has adopted a resolution to declassify documents and 
instructions issued in the Soviet period by state institutions 
of power, prosecutors' office, courts, all structures of the 
Lithuanian Communist Party and secret instructions received from 
former Soviet departments, Lithuanian radio reported on Sunday. 
  Documents which shall be declassified date back to the 
period 
from 1940 to 1941 and from 1944 until March 11, 1990 when the 
Lithuanian national statehood was restored. 
  The resolution says that documents containing Lithuanian 
state secrets and which were listed separately, will not be 
declassified for some time. Such documents concern former KGB 
agents, KGB intelligence activities and some data pertaining to 
communications, geodesy, civil defence and some other spheres. 
  The majority of documents, numbering around 520,000 and 
which 
are no longer secret, are kept in the archives of the former 
Lithuanian Communist Party. Lithuanian ministries and 
departments have been instructed to declassify documents in 
their possession until may 1, 1994 and submit lists of these 
documents to the board of the Lithuanian central archive. 
  Declassified documents will be available to anyone who 
receives a corresponding letter of permission from the 
organisation to which one belongs.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Clinton Expresses Support for </F>
Latvia"] 
  [Text] Riga, 21 January -- On Thursday [20 January] 
evening, President of the United States Bill Clinton called 
Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis and, in a conversation which 
lasted half an hour, expressed support for Latvia's conduct 
during the 10 January incident [in which two Russian generals 
were arrested]. 
  G. Ulmanis conveyed to the U.S. President his view of the 
speech recently delivered by Russian Foreign Affairs Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, which showed that the policy of Russia towards 
the Baltic States had changed. B. Clinton confirmed that the 
United States has already received an explanation of this speech 
from Russia -- it says A. Kozyrev was misinterpreted. The 
President of the United States maintained that during his 
meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, there 
was no talk of any changes in Russian policy and there was also 
no previous agreement. 
  B. Clinton stated that there was much talk in Moscow about 
the Skrunda radar station. According to G. Ulmanis, B. 
Clinton's proposition is that delegations of both countries 
continue to negotiate and seek a compromise on a schedule for 
the operation of the station on the territory of Latvia. 
  President B. Clinton pointed out that the issues of human 
rights and citizenship are by no means linked with the 
withdrawal of the Russian Army. In his opinion, the issues of 
human rights and citizenship will be solved by Latvia, in 
compliance with CSCE resolutions and recommendations. 
  G. Ulmanis concluded that his conversation with B. Clinton 
allows him to think that there really is no agreement between 
the United States and Russia that could contain a threat to the 
sovereignty of the Latvian state. 
  The President of the United States sent his greetings to 
Latvia and the Latvian people, and his best wishes for their 
future activities. 
  G. Ulmanis said that with regard to the recent activities of 
Russia, he does not foresee any changes for the worse in 
relations between Latvians and Russians residing on Latvian 
territory.

<F P=106> [Article by Modris Posse: "Russia Threatens To Cut Natural </F>
Gas Deliveries in Half"] 
  [Text] Riga, 18 Jan -- On 17 January, Russia presented an 
official warning to state joint stock company "Latvijas Gaze 
[LG]," in which it demanded a cardinal change, to take effect by 
1 February, in the system of settling accounts for 
already-consumed gas, otherwise deliveries will be cut by 50 
percent. 
  As DIENA was told by LG Vice President Girts Stalbovics, gas 
that has been pumped into the Underground Reservoir at Incukalns 
(IPGK) in fact belongs to Russia, and Latvia has to pay for its 
usage. 
  In summer of last year, the debts were almost paid, but as 
the heating period of this year has started, the debt to Russia 
for consumed gas, through the fault of irresponsible debtors, 
has risen from 500,000 lats on 1 November 1993 to 16 million 
lats on 16 January. In addition to these debts, there is also a 
considerably high fine to pay, the amount of which G. Stalbovics 
did not wish to reveal. 
  As a result of this, the output of industrial plants which 
are using gas in their production, will decrease. 
  Owing to the fact that one of the greatest debtors is the 
state joint stock company "Latvenergo," the population also will 
suffer -- the enterprise uses primarily gas for heating. Due to 
Russia's action, it will be forced to change the terms of heat 
deliveries. Among the biggest debtors, G. Stalbovics also 
mentioned the municipal heating enterprises and several building 
administrators. 
  Until now, Russia was being appeased by promises, said G. 
Stalbovics. To give Latvia a chance to settle its debts, Russia 
is ready to take over a part of the IPGK and gas pipeline 
system. A similar scheme was accepted by Estonia, which thus 
made itself utterly dependent on Russian conditions for gas 
deliveries. LG will take pains to pay so much that it will not 
be forced to sign such an agreement, because Russia can also be 
dependent on IPGK -- if there is any gas damage, the amount of 
gas pumped into the reservoir would be sufficient to deliver it, 
within reasonable limits, to Russia as well.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 28, BNS -- The Riga Vidzeme district 
council overwhelmingly rejected a request by the Latvian 
Prosecutor's Office to allow prosecute deputy Andrejs Rucs. 
  The council decided against depriving Rucs of his deputy's 
immunity. 
  The group motivated the resolution with its Jan. 17 
statement 
on the correctness of Rucs' actions during the Jan. 10 incident 
between Latvian authorities and Russian generals. 
  During the debate, Riga Mayor Andris Teikmanis claimed that 
only court could decide on the guilt or innocence of Rucs. 
Teikmanis also urged the Prosecutor's Office and court to 
investigate into Rucs' actions. 
  Rucs has said he ordered the detention of the two generals 
because they threatened to use force to regain the seized 
buildings. 
  The investigation materials, however, lack corresponding 
evidence, senior investigator Biruta Ulpe told BNS. 
  Rucs' defense attourney Valdis Strauts denies showings of a 
crime in the case since it was not preliminary planned and "Rucs 
did all he could to prevent the conflict." 
  The Vidzeme council of people's deputies is still busy with 
chairman elections. Among the candidates are Rucs, who was 
fired under a government resolution, acting Chairwoman Velta 
Nesaule and Deputy Chairman Karlis Lapins. 
  As reported, Major General Anatoli Vodopyanov and Major 
General Nikolai Tailokov were arrested Jan. 10 after Rucs' 
directive. The Prosecutor's Office launched investigation on 
the same day for excess of service authority and illegal 
detention.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 28, BNS -- The Riga city Vidzeme district 
council of people's deputies overwhelmingly reelected Andrejs 
Rucs as council chairman. 
  Rucs gathered 53 votes in the ballot, while only 14 deputies 
supported other candidates. 
  "Vidzeme district's local government is against the Cabinet 
-- let all Latvia learn it. Let all municipalities work as we 
work," Rucs exclaimed after the vote was announced. 
  The conference rejected the request by the Prosecutor's 
Office to nullify Rucs' deputy's immunity. Consequently, Rucs 
cannot be tried for the Jan. 10 incident with Russian generals. 
  Rucs described the incident as a political order of the 
Russian military intelligence service, in an interview with BNS 
before the vote. 
  During the session, Rucs reiterated that he "acted correctly 
to prevent a possible conflict." 
  Rucs argued that investigator Biruta Ulpe's comments on the 
lack of evidence on the groundedness of his actions. [sentence 
as received] Ulpe has not acquainted herself with all the 
materials, he said. 
  The council's next session is scheduled for Feb. 11.

"Gavriil Popov Content With Government Reshuffle and Ready To 
Cooperate With Everyone"] 
  [Text] Gavriil Popov, leader of the Russian Democratic 
Reform Movement, held a news conference devoted to the 
movement's upcoming congress. Speaking to journalists, Mr. 
Popov analyzed the reasons for the RDRM's failure in the 
elections to the Federal Assembly and gave an assessment of the 
current political situation. 
  Mr. Popov believes that the next two years should be devoted 
to restoring social stability and drawing up a new economic 
reform program. To this end, it is essential to "lend weight to 
the parliament" and to let the government work in peace, Popov 
said. He expressed his astonishment at the "uproar" raised by 
the press over the latest government reshuffles. In the RDRM 
leader's opinion, the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov and the 
change in economic policy are rather positive developments, 
because "it is necessary to clear the country of the extremes of 
pro-Western reform," Popov noted. 
  Analyzing the RDRM's electoral platform, Mr. Popov pointed 
to 
a number of tactical mistakes made by chiefs of the RDRM 
electoral association that caused the movement's fiasco. They 
include lengthy, albeit inconclusive talks about setting up a 
bloc; an inadequate fund-raising campaign; and a lack of party 
structures that could be tasked with performing organizational 
work, collecting signatures, and campaigning. This is why the 
RDRM, which initially drew support from 6-7 percent of the 
voters, did not enter the State Duma. 
  The RDRM leader expressed his intention to cooperate with 
all 
politicians and parties that support the stabilization of the 
political situation with words and deeds. For the RDRM to be 
able to cooperate with "Russia's Choice," however, Yegor Gaydar 
and his followers should back away from the "pro-Western reform 
model," Popov said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 29 TASS -- The Russian Democratic 
Reform Movement said on Saturday its main task is to develop a 
new concept of Russia's transition to post-industrial society. 
  Addressing the Second Congress of the movement that opened 
in 
Moscow today, its leader Gavriil Popov said the movement 
prioritises the development of a "platform of reform, 
alternative to the western model and ensuring the country's 
transition to a post-industrial society," as well as "the 
neutralisation of the most dangerous measures and laws of the 
western model of reform." 
  He also said that the movement will seek to initiate debates 
on the new concept in the parliament and make amendments to the 
new constitution. In order to promote the stability of power in 
the country, Popov called for reopening the constitutional 
assembly and establishing a Council of Nationalities of Russia 
and several other corporate organisations. 
  He believes the main result of the December 1993 elections 
in 
Russia is that Russia rejected the "post-August pro-western 
stage of reform" and the shock therapy policy. The fact that 
none of the political forces received the support of 15 per cent 
of the electorate proves this point, he added. 
  The Russian Democratic Reform Movement set up about two 
years 
ago had rated among top ten political parties and movements in 
Russia, but failed to clear the five per cent threshold at the 
parliamentary elections in December last year. 
  Popov explained the failure by a mistake in strategy 
planning. The movement had failed to foresee that the voters 
would reject the post-August concept of reform so soon. "We 
believed that the majority would support the presidential course 
and did not put forward our own alternative," Popov said. 
  The movement has criticised the Russia's Choice bloc for its 
inability to "pass the most elementary test of political 
maturity." However, it is ready to cooperate with the "healthy" 
forces of Russia's Choice and the Democratic Russia Party. 
Popov did not rule out the possibility of cooperation with the 
Communists and the Agrarian Party "if they embark on the path of 
social democracy," but excluded any cooperation with the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia which he described as a "party of 
aggressive nationalism." There is much positive in the 
platforms of the Civic Union and the Yabloko bloc, Popov said. 
  The Congress has begun debates on Popov's report. The 
participants will also consider changes and amendments to the 
movement charter and discus the establishment of its 
coordinating bodies.

congress of the movement about the inevitability of cooperation 
with the present Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] 
before it degenerates into a fascist structure. 
  It is still premature to talk about the LDPR as a proper 
party, Gavriil Popov believes. The possibility that it will 
fall apart like Vasilyev's Pamyat cannot be ruled out.

former commander in chief of the CIS Armed Forces, candidate of 
Russian Democratic Reform Movement (RDRM) in the 12 December 
elections: "Second RDRM Congress -- Realignment of Forces?"; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] The second congress of the Russian Democratic 
Reform Movement will open in Moscow (at the Sociopolitical 
Center on Tsvetnoy Boulevard) on Saturday. In order to find out 
its aims and objectives our correspondent turned to a long-time 
RDRM supporter, Air Force Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, former 
commander in chief of the CIS Armed Forces, a political figure 
who ran on the movement's ticket in the 12 December elections. 
  [KURANTY] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, what are the main aims of the 
RDRM's second congress? 
  [Shaposhnikov] First: We need to sum up the results of our 
work in the period between the congresses and during the 
election campaign. To make an analysis. Second: to determine 
our program for the immediate future. The program should be 
specific. Metaphorically speaking, our aims and objectives 
should be more "down-to-earth." 
  [KURANTY] Can organizational changes be expected? 
  [Shaposhnikov] I am not a leader of the movement. To some 
extent I would like some changes to take place, but without the 
movement's evolving into a party. I categorically oppose a 
strict hierarchy or party centralism. 
  [KURANTY] What are the main methods the RDRM employs to 
raise its effectiveness? 
  [Shaposhnikov] We have a fairly large number of 
sympathizers. At present, to pursue our political line we need 
to strengthen our vertical structures somewhat.

  [Text] The relations between the Democratic Russia movement 
and President Boris Yeltsin have become uneasy, Lev Ponomarev, a 
co-chairman of the movement, told a RIA correspondent. 
  We are extremely worried by the fact that the president did 
not consult with the democratic forces, particularly over the 
key issue of selecting members of government, he said. 
  According to Ponomarev, Democratic Russia is now forced to 
communicate with the president only through the press.

  [Text] In an interview with a RIA correspondent, Konstantin 
Borovoy, co-chairman of the Economic Freedom Party, has 
expressed concern over Russia's possible deviation from the 
reform course. 
  In his opinion, some time in the near future opponents to 
the 
market in the government will start introducing all possible 
restrictions in the economy. Therefore, according to Borovoy, 
empty shelves, lines, and distribution coupons might very soon 
appear. 
  Also, he does not rule out that a rigid dollar exchange rate 
might be introduced. According to Borovoy, this will happen 
when the dollar rate exceeds 2,500 rubles. 
  Such economic decisions might be followed by anti-democratic 
moves.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pelts report: "`Russia's Choice' Not Losing </F>
Optimism"] 
  [Text] How will the resignation of key figures (Gaydar, 
Pamfilova, Fedorov) affect the activity of the "Russia's Choice" 
deputies' faction? What do the leaders of this movement intend 
to do in the long term? These and many other questions were put 
by journalists yesterday to Sergey Yushenkov, Mikhail Mityukov, 
Boris Saltykov, and Grigoriy Tomchenko. It had been intended 
that Ella Pamfilova would attend the news conference. But she 
had fallen ill and was not present. 
  Sergey Yushenkov emphasized that the parliamentary faction 
supports the departure of Gaydar, Pamfilova, and Fedorov. 
  In his opinion, a real process is now being observed, 
whereby 
the center of power is shifting from the presidential structures 
toward the head of government. The government has firmly 
embarked on the path of curtailing the reforms which had been 
begun. 
  At the same time "Russia's Choice" is not losing optimism. 
Again, according to Sergey Yushenkov, the deputies' faction has 
sufficient means and opportunities "to prevent the matter from 
being completely spoiled." "Russia's Choice" holds sufficiently 
strong positions on key parliamentary committees and, in 
addition, relies on the support and solidarity of other factions 
(including Communists and farmers) in the struggle against any 
extreme views and positions. 
  "Russia's Choice" also does not rule out raising the 
question 
of no confidence in the government. This is possible in the 
very near future, when the new budget, for example, is discussed. 
  The Duma faction's spokesmen also pin considerable hopes on 
the president of Russia. Sergey Yushenkov emphasized that 
Yeltsin will, in the final analysis, realize the perniciousness 
of curtailing the reforms and will find the strength to make the 
necessary decision.

Communist Party and prepare the 30th conference of the CPSU", 
member of the political executive committee of the Union of 
Communist Parties-CPSU Sergey Chernyakhovsky told ITAR-TASS here 
today. 
  The conference is scheduled for April 2 to coincide with a 
city conference of the Russian Communist Party. According to 
Chernyakhovsky, the initiative was supported by representatives 
of the Union of Communists, the Russian Communist Workers' 
Party, the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the 
Lenin Opposition in the Russian Communist Party (Richard 
Kosolapov). "The separation from the Russian Communist Party is 
final," he said. 
  Meanwhile the Russian Communist Party headed by Gennadiy 
Zyuganov gained 12 per cent of votes at the recent elections and 
formed a major parliament faction, more orthodox parties and 
organizations who called for boycotting the elections are 
fighting for survival. 
  In the words of Chernyakhovskiy, there are two reasons for 
differences between the Communist Party leadership and "other 
Communists". 
  Firstly, in the opinion of orthodox communists, Zyuganov and 
his associates "have taken a conciliatory stand, abandoned 
communist principles and turned nationalistic". Secondly, the 
Russian Communist Party does not want to be "part of the Soviet 
Communist Party" and refuses to encourage double membership of 
Communists in the two organizations. 
  Chernyakhovsky said the organizational committee will be 
supported by no less than one fourth of Moscow rank-and-file 
communists as well as many Communists in Russian regions. He 
thinks it may become the basis for a single Communist 
organization, an alternative to the Russian Communist Party. 
  "It is the apogee mutation of the left-wing communists," 
member of the Russian Communist Party's Central Executive 
Committee Grigory Rebrov told ITAR-TASS today, commenting on the 
organizational committee. 
  "It is a sectarian, left-wing force that has failed to unite 
with the Communist movement and made the last step towards a 
split. They have no future," he added.

  [Text] The initiation of a criminal case against leader of 
the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and deputy of the State Duma 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is illegal and it will be appealed in 
accordance with the appropriate order. This was said in a 
statement published by the LDP faction in the State Duma on 
Friday. 
  According to the statement, a "meeting between Zhirinovskiy 
and Russian Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik, where all 
issues which could be interpreted in different ways will be 
clarified, is expected to take place." 
  However, the faction's representatives warned that if the 
criminal case "had not been initiated, since Zhirinovskiy had 
received as yet no information on this from the investigating 
bodies, those who were guilty of spreading the libel against the 
LDP leader would bear legal and civil responsibility for this." 
  The Russian Prosecutor General's Office initiated a criminal 
case against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on the accusation mentioned 
in provision 71 of the Criminal Code -- propaganda of war -- on 
January 26. In accordance with the Criminal Code, Zhirinovskiy 
may face from three to eight years in prison.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Podlipskiy report: "Commission for Day-to-Day </F>
Matters. Oleg Soskovets Has Boosted His Standing in Government"] 
  [Text] The spectacular increase in Oleg Soskovets' clout 
in the structures of authority has been confirmed not only by 
the fact that so far he has remained the only first deputy prime 
minister of the reorganized government, but also by giving his 
Commission for Day-to-Day Matters [CDM] unprecedented powers. 
The statute on the commission, which was released yesterday for 
official distribution, contains so extensive a list of powers 
that it lends credibility to talk about an effectively 
monopolistic center of economic power in the government in the 
making. 
  Last summer, when the CDM was set up especially for Oleg 
Soskovets, it was assumed that it would deal with matters of 
more of less secondary importance, for which the Council of 
Ministers Presidium would have no time. In the extreme case, 
the commission was intended to be a filter of sorts to sift out 
materials not properly prepared for government meetings. The 
commission's 28 meetings since 15 June 1993, however, have 
caused a qualitative change in the situation -- the CDM has 
evolved from a marginal body into an "acting" Council of 
Ministers Presidium. The government document released yesterday 
only formalized de jure what had already been accomplished. 
Now, Oleg Soskovets will directly control matters related to 
changing fuel, electric power, and railway tariffs. Another 
noteworthy provision gives the commission the right to consider 
matters related to granting financial and credit resources to 
industry. Thus Oleg Soskovets has continued the "expansion" of 
CDM's powers that had started with the Economy Ministry's 
handing the right to allocate export quotas over to it -- 
hitherto all credits had been allocated by a special government 
body headed by the finance minister. The commission was just as 
decisive in "crossing the path" of the federal administration 
for enterprises' bankruptcies -- judging from the document, the 
structure subordinate to the State Property Committee will keep 
responsibility only for technical procedures, whereas the CDM 
will determine their "ideology." It is plainly evident that 
this allocation of powers suits Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has 
entrusted his deputy with all economic matters (including 
strategic ones) in order to gain greater freedom on the 
political scene.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zhagel report: "New Finance Minister Called `Mr. No' </F>
Behind His Back"] 
  [Text] News agencies have disseminated a report on a 
Russian presidential edict appointing Sergey Konstantinovich 
Dubinin, who had hitherto been first deputy finance minister, as 
acting finance minister. 
  The question naturally arises of why S. Dubinin has been 
appointed in an acting capacity rather than as finance minister 
straightaway. Will a new candidate for this important post 
"emerge" in a few days' time? 
  But, according to confidential information obtained from the 
presidential entourage, S. Dubinin will in due course be 
confirmed as finance minister. And the "acting" formula 
creates, as it were, a diplomatic pause, during which the public 
reaction to the new appointment can be assessed. After all, 
this key government post is now coming in for heightened 
attention from the media. 
  I think that the reaction to S. Dubinin's appointment as 
finance minister will be positive or, at any rate, calm. After 
all, he was recommended by Boris Fedorov. Moreover, it was 
under B. Fedorov that S. Dubinin came to the Finance Ministry as 
first deputy, and he has always been seen as a man close to the 
former minister, which guarantees at least in general terms the 
maintenance of a tough financial policy. 
  Admittedly, reacting positively to his successor, B. Fedorov 
nonetheless voiced doubt that he would be able to withstand the 
pressure from top government officials who, following the 
obvious change in economic policy, will start demanding more and 
more loans from the Finance Ministry. But it should be stressed 
at this point that whenever B. Fedorov went anywhere on a trip, 
he always left S. Dubinin "in charge." And it was during these 
periods that the latter earned the moniker "Mr. No!" -- a clear 
reference to his uncompromising attitude as regards various 
financial demands. 
  Incidentally, it is always easier to refuse when you are a 
deputy -- even a first deputy -- than when you are a minister. 
But I think that we will very soon learn whether the new 
minister's nickname is accurate or not. 
  Unfortunately, we do not yet know the view of S. Dubinin 
himself on how financial policy will turn out in the coming 
year. After all, the acting finance minister's first day in his 
new job was spent in interminable conferences and consultations 
with his immediate entourage. At any rate, that was what his 
office told us. 
  We can also report that S. Dubinin is 43 and a doctor of 
economic sciences. He was at one time a senior lecturer at the 
Moscow State University Economics Faculty, worked in the 
president's apparatus in 1991-1992, and later worked as deputy 
chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Economic 
Cooperation with the Commonwealth Member States before finally 
moving to the Finance Ministry in March 1993.

<F P=106> [Report by State Duma deputy Vasiliy Lipitskiy: "Amnesty </F>
for State Committee for the State of Emergency Members and 
Lefortovo Prisoners Could Be Step Toward National Conciliation"] 
  [Text] The dramatic events of August 1991 and 
September-October 1993 have created a deep split in the life of 
society and in human destinies. Twice the barricades outside 
the White House have been dismantled but they still stand firmly 
in people's awareness, dividing them into two hostile camps. 
  The flames of confrontation are not being left without fuel. 
The trial over the State Committee for the State of Emergency 
case is continuing -- an absurd trial of people who tried to 
encroach on power in a state which no longer exists. From their 
uncomfortable dock the accused have already moved to seats in 
the Federal Assembly, having received a vote of confidence from 
voters. Yet the trial is still continuing and an attempt is 
being made to persuade us that this is some supreme justice and 
public benefit. 
  Investigations are also developing into the events of 21 
September through 4 October in Moscow. If they are conducted 
objectively then they are bound to go beyond the framework of a 
criminal case involving the organization of mass riots and will 
force us to return to the sources of the event, to political 
assessments of the two sides' actions. 
  The question arises: Why is all this necessary? Why have 
we, in other cases so tolerant of failure to comply with the 
laws, suddenly used the ancient principle of "let justice be 
done even if the world comes to an end!" 
  The voting in the State Duma on the question of an amnesty 
for the participants in the events of August 1991 and 
September-October 1993 revealed a most unexpected disposition of 
forces: The proposal received no support not only from their 
political opponents but even from some of those who 
ideologically and organizationally are quite close to the State 
Committee for the State of Emergency members and the Lefortovo 
prisoners. The motives? "Let them be patient for a while," I 
was told later in the corridors. "These trials keep the 
opposition in good shape, enable it to maintain a useful tension 
in society." 
  I have already written repeatedly about how radicals at 
opposite political flanks unexpectedly merge and how much they 
need each other. Some need rousing slogans for demonstrations, 
other pretexts for calling for the struggle against 
"communofascism." I allow myself to disagree with one other 
widespread argument: An amnesty will mean an admission of 
guilt. In legal practice the most diverse forms of amnesty are 
known, including those which simply offer to end legal 
proceedings or investigation. 
  Such an amnesty could be a way of drawing a line under the 
past, a step toward national conciliation. As we know, that is 
the path which was taken in the past in post-Franco Spain, in 
Argentina, and in some other countries. By rejecting the 
persecution even of those who were involved in mass repressions 
and by rejecting the idea of retribution, people there gained 
something greater -- civil peace and stability. 
  What awaits us in the immediate future: an aggravation of 
political confrontation? Crowds taking part in meetings under 
the slogans of "freedom!" on the one hand and "shoot them like 
dogs!" on the other? Or the peaceful respite the country needs 
so much? To a considerable extent that depends on how the 
amnesty question is resolved.

Transferred to Constitutional Court"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Aleksey Kazannik met with leaders of 
structural subsections of the Russian General Prosecutor's 
Office. They discussed ways of further improving the 
prosecutorial system. Kazannik indicated the need to make 
changes in the style of work of prosecutor's office 
administrations and departments in the new conditions. The 
numerous mass media items about both the general prosecutor 
himself and his relations with the prosecutor's office apparatus 
also did not escape attention. 
  Kazannik denied the rumors of his transfer to the 
Constitutional Court. 
  The leaders of structural subsections who spoke criticized 
the publications in the press about the existence in the General 
Prosecutor's Office of some opposition to Kazannik from the 
apparatus' middle level, which is allegedly opposing his 
activities. It was declared that these mass media items did not 
correspond to the facts.

not given: "An Evening Telephone Call to Valeriy Zorkin: I, 
Too, Can Go on Hunger Strike"] 
  [Text] As already reported, the Russian Constitutional 
Court has reinstated Valeriy Zorkin's powers as a judge. 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's correspondent talks to him. 
  [Gamov] Valeriy Dmitriyevich, what is your frame of mind as 
you return to the judge's seat? 
  [Zorkin] I would like to sum up my feelings in one word -- 
hope. Hope that everything will gradually settle in such a way 
that we can move forward along a lawful road, and not along the 
path of 3-4 October. 
  [Gamov] Judge Viktor Luchin actively fought for your powers 
to be reinstated, and he even declared a hunger strike. While 
you made no effort at all in this direction. Why? 
  [Zorkin] That by no means signifies that I am incapable of 
going on hunger strike. I swore an oath to be a judge, and in 
my opinion I carried out my duty honestly. It seems to me that 
society must find a means of defending a judge if he becomes the 
object of injustice. 
  [Gamov] What kind of Zorkin is returning to the 
Constitutional Court? Is he the same man he was in September 
and October, or is he someone else? 
  [Zorkin] If you are talking about the principles of 
compliance with constitutionality, then I am the very same 
Zorkin that I always was. Although, of course, I have changed 
in some ways. I, too, have learned certain lessons from 
everything that has happened... 
  [Gamov] Do you intend to fight for a seat as chairman of the 
Constitutional Court and again fill the niche of peacemaker? 
  [Zorkin] Everybody has to be a peacemaker, but not to the 
extent of offering the other cheek when people are prepared to 
slice off your head. In brief, the issue of the chairmanship 
does not worry me in the least.

<F P=106> [A.N.-signed report: "Airing of Television, Radio Programs </F>
May Stop Unless Government Fulfills Communications Workers' 
Demands"] 
  [Text] Communications enterprises personnel "will have to 
stop airing television and radio programs on Russian Federation 
territory," said representatives of workers collectives of 
communications enterprises that ensure the distribution of state 
television and radio programs. 
  In their appeal to the Russian president, the government, 
and 
the Federal Assembly, the communications workers explain the 
proposed "forced halt" in airing television and radio programs 
by "an emergency situation" that came about at communications 
enterprises. According to the appeal, this situation was caused 
by the television and radio companies' two- or three-month 
delays in payments to communications enterprises because funds 
were not appropriated from the republican budget. As a result, 
all of them wound up in the red, had to stop purchases of 
materials and spare parts, and had to cancel plans to buy 
electronic products. This is why emergency reserves have been 
depleted within the past two years, and why presently no routine 
repairs of mast antennas are being carried out, which in itself 
is fraught with serious consequences. 
  Given that, the authors of the appeal demand that the 
government "approve the amounts of state television and radio 
broadcasting and decide on financing them taking into account 
changes in tariffs and inflation." By the deadline set by the 
communications workers, the Russian Federation Finance Ministry 
is also obliged to fulfill Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
directive of 22 December with regard to repaying debts to 
communications enterprises to the tune of 67.6 billion rubles. 
  If these and a number of other demands are not fulfilled, 
the 
communications workers are intent on halting the airing of 
television and radio programs throughout Russian territory in 
the immediate future.

  [Text] Russia's agriculture "failed to overcome the 
extremely complex financial and economic situation in 1993," 
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha, in charge of 
agribusiness in the government, declared at a news conference in 
Moscow on Friday. He reported that the debt to the farms for 
their produce totalled 2.3 Tn [trillion] rubles, and the farms 
debt to the state for fuel, machinery, and other supplies 
amounted to 1.8 Tn rubles. 
  He said that although the cabinet set aside 2.3 Tn rubles in 
credit at 231% interest for farms in the first quarter of 1994, 
this fell short of a badly needed credit worth 6 Tn rubles, 
which, according to him, "may put the spring agricultural 
season" at risk." 
  However, Zaveryukha is sure that in 1994 Russia will be 
self-sufficient in food, and "to secure the domestic 
agricultural producer," the government even plans custom duties 
of up to 20% on dairy and meat products and custom duties of 
nearly 25% on sugar. 
  He ruled out any change in the government's course toward 
reform and pledged to restructure agriculture, but only on the 
condition of a tough fiscal policy since "only such an approach 
will compel the Russian farmer to be more efficient." 
  Zaveryukha rejected former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov's 
charges of the "agro-industrial complex's lobby," but said that 
he was not going to get into an argument.

  [Text] The Russian Finance Ministry intends to continue the 
struggle against inflation using a stricter financial policy 
combined with re-targeting the investments on specific sectors 
of the economy, according to an official statement by the 
Finance Ministry. 
  The ministry will accomplish the preparation of budget 
proposals for 1994 within the next few days to submit them for 
consideration by the government and, later, by the new Russian 
parliament. The draft budget will strictly conform to the 
strategy of tackling inflation and restructuring the economy 
pursued by the president and the government, the Finance 
Ministry pointed out. 
  The this year's budget expenditures will be severely 
restricted due to limited revenues. At the same time, the 
Finance Ministry believes the draft budget is quite realistic 
and feasible. If approved by the State Duma, it will be a good 
basis for a further financial stabilization and the necessary 
adjustment of the social and economic policies. 
  The Finance Ministry points out that the central financial 
problem of the first quarter of 1994 is the last year's debts. 
The ministry said it was taking all possible measures to find 
additional sources of incomes for their reimbursement.

<F P=106> [Igor Karpenko report: "World's Largest Energy System Being </F>
Privatized. Twenty-Four Million `RAO YEES Rossii' Shares on 
Offer at Check Auctions"] 
  [Text] It seems as though all-Russia check auctions have 
ceased to be events that attract any particular attention from 
the mass media. For instance, the appearance on this nationwide 
market in mid-January of 6 million shares in the famous 
"AvtoVAZ" went unnoticed even by our ubiquitous television 
against the backdrop of the governmental clashes. Nonetheless, 
it is hard to call the all-Russia auction which will open 7 
February anything other than sensational -- 19 million shares in 
the "RAO YEES Rossii" (the world's largest joint-stock company) 
will be offered for sale. 
  Indeed, if this record is to be listed in the Guinness Book 
the figures should be clarified straightaway -- 24 million 
"power generation" shares will be sold simultaneously and, apart 
from the Russia-wide auction, another 5 million shares will be 
on offer at ordinary regional check auctions, mainly in areas 
where the main enterprises of the "Yedinaya Energeticheskaya 
Sistema Rossii" [Integrated Power System of Russia] joint-stock 
company are located. 
  The terms of the auction and the economics of his enterprise 
were revealed to Russian and foreign journalists by Anatoliy 
Dyakov, president of the joint-stock company. The "RAO YEES 
Rossii" is now indeed the world's largest holding structure, 
uniting 72 legally independent joint-stock enterprises with a 
total work force of more than 1.2 million. The enterprise will 
not become completely independent even after these auctions are 
over -- the state still holds a controlling block of shares and 
also regulates electricity prices. 
  The giant enterprise's economic condition is strong and 
stable -- it has managed to preserve all its subunits and the 
volume of power produced. Its profitability stands at 
approximately 23 percent on average. The power workers 
currently lack investment funds -- largely as a result of the 
huge debts owed them by energy consumers. In December, for 
instance, these debts stood at more than 2.2 trillion rubles 
[R]! Admittedly, the power workers themselves owe their own 
partners more than R1 trillion -- the problem of mutual 
nonpayments is well known. 
  Interestingly, in order to solve this problem, the power 
workers are now switching to using bills of exchange for their 
transactions. Within this system bills promise to be very 
effective instruments, since the bulk of mutual nonpayments is 
localized within a small closed "circuit" -- coal-oil 
products-transportation-energy. 
  The all-Russia check auction will run from 7 February 
through 
28 March. Total book value of the "RAO YEES Rossii" property 
offered for sale is R12 billion, which is around 20 percent of 
its total incorporation capital. Nominal price of the shares is 
R500.

  [Text] A conference of Russian armed forces command 
personnel has been held at the Defense Ministry. Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev noted that the main purpose of 
the event was to analyze the work of the management bodies of 
the General Staff and the Defense Ministry. In particular, he 
pointed out shortcomings in the work of the cadre and 
indoctrination structures of armed forces management bodies. In 
their speeches the commanders in chief of the branches of the 
Armed Forces noted that systematic combat training is taking 
place among their troops. Combat readiness is being maintained 
at the proper level in units and subunits. There have been no 
disruptions in the performance of combat alert duties. 
  The main problem acutely facing the Armed Forces remains 
financing. In order to prevent any disruptions in fuel 
deliveries and food and electricity supplies and to carry out 
military transportation tasks Grachev has issued instructions 
that the Defense Ministry's reserves be used for these purposes. 
  He also drew attention to the question of bringing up to 
strength the level of active service personnel at Russian 
military units and subunits situated in so-called trouble spots. 
In this connection Colonel-General Vladimir Semenov, commander 
in chief of land forces, noted that these units are manned only 
by volunteers who have signed contracts and who have served for 
not less than six months in the Army.

  [Excerpts] History has provided us with many examples of 
how dangerous it is to neglect the technical equipping of the 
armed forces. [passage omitted] 
  Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin, Russian first deputy defense 
minister, answered questions from our correspondent. 
  [Begin Kokoshin recording] The task of the Defense Ministry 
has been in the key areas to ensure, albeit with minimum 
funding, since we have been constantly underfinanced, both the 
development of the most up-to-date equipment and its serial 
production; nonetheless, the new equipment that has been 
developed in general in recent years has been, so to speak, a 
very slender trickle, but it is coming through and it will come 
through. In 1994 we shall probably have to direct our main 
efforts on preserving what the forces have and on modernizing 
what they have. This includes such celebrated air defense 
missile systems as the S-300VM and TOR systems. We will also of 
course be ordering the BUK M2 system and a number of others, 
which cover the whole spectrum in respect of range and altitude. 
That is to say, we are talking about those systems which when 
linked together in a unified complex can tackle air defense 
tasks in a theater of military actions. 
  We have in general, I consider, reached a definite new level 
in the development of tactical communication systems. By as 
early as the end of this year we should have provided the most 
up-to-date communications facilities for a number of our elite 
units in the most important areas where combat tasks or tasks 
close to combat ones have to be tackled. We do not intend 
either to do without new ships, and the launching of new ships 
is planned. The hoisting of the St. Andrew's flag is planned 
aboard a new destroyer at the Northern Shipyard and we hope by 
the end of 1994 to have completed work on the heavy missile 
cruiser Petr Velikiy. 
  We are continuing work on the most varied kinds of space 
facilities and this year we shall be adding something and our 
space group, so to speak, will be renewed. Improvements are 
being made too to our space missile-attack early warning systems 
and to our space-based communications, including for the 
tactical system for instance.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1920 GMT on 29 January carries the regularly 
scheduled "Top Secret" program presented by Arten Borovik. 
  Today's program "The Nuclear Button" is devoted to nuclear 
weapons in Russia and the United States. Borovik starts the 
program by saying the nuclear threat still exists: the video 
shows a button on which is written "To execute the launch" 
[proizvesti pusk]. Borovik continues, noting that several weeks 
ago he visited a Russian nuclear missile base located not far 
from Moscow. The video show a rocket launcher aimed at the 
(?Warren) missile base in Wyoming. Borovik notes that in 30 
minutes Russian missiles could reach the Wyoming missile 
facility. 
  At this point one General Gribov is identified as the 
commander of this particular Russian missile division. Borovik 
says that all officers and soldiers who work at the Russian base 
are regularly examined by doctors because the fate of out planet 
is in their hands. Borovik notes that none of the personnel 
know what the targets are for the Russian missiles; however, 
they know exactly whether a particular order is a training or an 
operational order. 
  The video continues with Borovik noting that there are many 
such nuclear missile bases throughout Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, 
and Kazakhstan. He notes that all these facilities are united 
in one single nuclear command center located approximately 25 
minutes driving distance from Triumfalnaya Arka in western 
Moscow, in a place identified as Vlasikha. 
  At this point in the show, Colonel General Igor Sergeyev is 
identified by caption as the commander of this enormous nuclear 
facility, itself a legacy of the former Soviet Union. Col. Gen. 
Sergeyev is cited as the commander in chief of the strategic 
missile troops. Borovik notes that Sergeyev was born in 1938 
and has been in missile troops since the initial days of 
inception. 
  At this point in the show, Borovik has a few comments about 
the nuclear weapons program in the United States. In 
particular, he notes the recent visit by a top Russian military 
delegation, led by Col. Gen. Sergeyev. Borovik says this was 
the first meeting of professionals in this field. He goes on to 
describe in detail key aspects of the meeting: the video shows 
Col. Gen. Sergeyev with other members of the Russian military 
delegation in the Pentagon. 
  Next in the program, Borovik incorporates an interview with 
scientist Aleksey Arbatov, identified as an expert for the "Top 
Secret" program. Arbatov is heard making several remarks 
regarding different aspects of nuclear weapons in Russia as well 
as in the United States. 
  Borovik then is seen asking Col. Gen. Sergeyev about the 
position of the Russian nuclear missile troops during the coup 
in 1993. Col. Gen. Sergeyev says: "I can only say that this was 
a very difficult time for everybody, including us. Our main 
task, whatever was happening, was to continue our guard duty, to 
be completely prepared, to professionally inspect operational 
posts, and to carry out measures for increasing protection and 
defense of operational launching positions in order to avoid the 
situation in which nuclear weapons become a card which somebody 
suddenly would like to play. This was out of the question: not 
because we are so good but because our lifestyle, our 
understanding of the dangerous and destructive weapons in our 
hands, our sense of responsibility in this difficult situation 
with respect to the fate of our people, for nuclear security, 
for strategic stability--I think all of these issues ensured 
that our missile specialist, as he is now and who, in these 
difficult conditions, is continuing to fulfill his duties." 
  Throughout the program, Borovik touches upon a very 
important 
question: who will give an order to push the nuclear button in 
case of war? Col. Gen. Sergeyev states: "The command will be 
given in the established order. It must come only from the 
president." At this point, scientist Arbatov states: "According 
to our Constitution, in the case of the incapability of the 
president, all his functions revert to the head of the 
government or the prime minister. Thus, this button, or better 
to say this difficult mechanism, will go to his legal successor." 
  Concluding the program Borovik expresses his gratitude to 
the 
leadership of both the Russian and U.S. Defense ministries for 
their help in preparing the program.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 0700 GMT on 30 January carries the 
"Test Range" program devoted to nuclear disarmament. 
  The first segment is a brief satirical look at problems in 
the military. In particular, drug abuse in the Army is noted. 
An increase from 3,000 addicts in 1991 to over 9,000 in 1992 is 
noted. 
  The second segment of the show is of an undated interview 
between Air Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov and military 
commentator Aleksandr Zhilin. The interview covers the 
situation in the Crimea. Zhilin suggests that the Crimea may 
become a Karabakh between Russia and Ukraine. Shaposhnikov asks 
if the whole Black Sea Fleet, however glorious and grand, is 
worth creating a bloody situation between two great, fraternal 
peoples, linked together by centuries. He then notes that there 
will be no fighting between Russia and Ukraine. He says if 
someone thinks there will be, then that person should be put 
away somewhere safe, where he can rest with his Napoleonic 
visions. 
  The third segment deals with implementing provisions of the 
START treaties. Uragan transporters, fitted with specialized 
equipment, are seen arriving at the site of one or more missile 
shafts. Military personnel are seen putting on protective 
clothing. 
  There is a brief interview with an engineer familiar with 
the 
deactivation process. The process is described as a closed 
system, preventing any contact between fuel components in the 
missile and the atmosphere; an operation that guarantees 
ecological safety. 
  Footage from a helicopter over a testing range is shown 
next. 
Assorted debris from explosions or launchings is shown. 
  A narrator recalls that Russia is ill-equipped to either 
scrap its missiles, let alone clean up the single testing range 
of its strategic missile troops, which occupies an area of 
175,000 hectares. 
  During a brief interview with a junior officer, it is stated 
that 16,000 tonnes of detachable parts have accumulated from 
falls over the range during 35 years of its existence. The 
officer says four operations are now under way: 1) to reduce 
the guaranteed residue in the fuel supplies in missile boosters 
and to reduce the number of component fall areas; 2) to assess 
ecological situation in fall areas; 3) to clear up the fall 
areas; and 4) to keep the local population informed. 
  Dangers that Russia faces from aging nuclear weapons is 
highlighted next: over 30 percent of Russian warheads on standby 
will be in a dangerous condition in two years' time. 
  Footage of the (?Surovatikha) deactivation base is next 
shown. The camera pans around parked missiles which appear to be 
encased in tubular containers. An announcer notes that the 
Pebonzhur and Surovatikha facilities are the first Russian bases 
for liquidating intercontinental missiles. 
  The liquidation process is detailed next. Each SS-17 or 
SS-18 missile is first cleaned of dangerous fuel components, 
then painstakingly divided into separate fragments. The base 
can liquidate over 40 heavy missiles a year, freeing up to 1,000 
tonnes of expensive metals and alloys for industry. 
  Past methods of liquidation--via explosions--are noted. The 
problem of funding for new more efficient bases is mentioned. 
  Russian intentions to create a missile based on the SS-25 
are 
next described. It is stated that this new missile will be more 
vulnerable than the SS-18 as it will not be able to release up 
to 1,000 false targets to fool enemy antimissile defenses. 
Fiscal problems are again mentioned as an impediment in the 
design process. 
  The 29-minute program ends with the narrator expressing his 
hope for world nuclear disarmament.

ITAR-TASS correspondent, a highly-placed representative of the 
leadership of Kazakhstan today categorically rejected a report 
that appeared in the Iranian newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI about a 
special position that Kazakhstan was supposed to have adopted 
over the nuclear weapons in its possession. 
  The report, he stressed, had nothing in common with 
Kazakhstan's position, which was confirmed during the December 
visit to Almaty by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
and by the forthcoming signing of an agreement with Russia on 
the strategic nuclear forces temporarily stationed on the 
territory of Kazakhstan. 
  In response to a request from an ITAR-TASS correspondent to 
comment on the Iranian newspaper report, a high-ranking Russian 
diplomat said that, if it were true, it required "careful and 
urgent verification, primarily by Kazakhstan."

  [Text] Myrzadai Zholdasbekov, Kazakh ambassador to Iran, 
announced today that he did not give an Iranian newspaper an 
interview from which it was inferred that Almaty had allegedly 
changed its position regarding the republic's nuclear weapons. 
  Earlier this week, quoting the ambassador, the newspaper 
JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI reported that Kazakhstan was not planning to 
destroy the nuclear weapons located on its territory or hand 
them over to anyone.

  [Text] Minsk January 28 TASS -- Three candidates for the 
post of Belarusian parliament speaker outlined their programmes 
for future activities on Friday. 
  Myechyslaw Hryb noted that he fully supports the government 
programme for pulling the country out of the present crisis 
situation. He sees the speaker's task in helping legislators to 
come to mutual understanding on the basis of respect for 
opinions of opponents. 
  The candidate pointed to the need to abide by law. "We shall 
pull out of the crisis after we unite and establish law and 
order in the republic," the legislator stressed. 
  He noted that he is against changing the present foreign 
policy, does not intend to raise a question on remapping borders 
and advocates independence, the nuclear-free status of the 
republic and implementation of the signed international treaties. 
  Hryb stressed that he supports the development of relations 
between Belarus and the east, above all with great Russia, which 
should not prevent the republic from establishing good contacts 
with the west. 
  Speaking of crime, Hryb, chairman of the parliamentary 
commission on national security, defence and crime control, 
said: "There is much talk, but results are too modest". 
  Accusations of lawlessness in the country forced former 
speaker Stanislav Shushkevich and two power-wielding ministers 
to step down. 
  The present situation will possibly be a new stage in the 
political career of the chairman of the parliamentary commission 
which is also responsible for the negative operation of law 
enforcement bodies, condemned by the Belarusian parliament. 
The programme-setting speech by Mikhail Marynych was short. 
He said that he sees two main directions in the speaker's 
activities: rallying of lawmakers to tackle economic problems 
and to strengthen the young statehood of the country. 
  Viktar Hanchar explained his decision to contest the 
speaker's post by desire to express "his protest at shadow 
politicians who regard themselves cardinals" at the Belarusian 
parliament. 
  The legislator underlined that it is necessary to take a 
decision limiting powers of parliament speaker and vesting him 
with strictly speaker's functions. Hanchar advocated reasonable 
continuity of power: to hold presidential elections late in 
April and early general elections in September. 
  Instead of electing a new speaker, which was scheduled for 
12:00, local time, lawmakers began to discuss the candidates. 
Initially, this procedural item was forgotten in the heated 
atmosphere in the parliament building. 
  The debate was brief. The floor was taken only by one 
legislator -- representative from the opposition Vitaliy 
Malashko. He said that the opposition did not intend to 
participate in "this cheap show" and called on all other 
lawmakers to follow suit. 
  Then the session adjourned till 13:00, local time.

  [Text] Official results of the election for Belarusian 
Supreme Soviet chairman were announced about two hours ago. 
Myechyslaw Hryb received 183 votes in his favor and 65 votes 
against his candidacy. Here is a brief outline of his personal 
history: 
  Myechyslaw Hryb is a lawyer. He was born into a peasant 
family 57 years ago. His father died in World War II. He 
graduated from a college in the Ministry of Interior Affairs. 
In his military service, he rose to the rank of general and was 
head of the Interior Affairs Administration of the Vitebsk 
Oblast Executive Committee. In 1990, he was elected to the 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet and named head of the legislative 
commission for national security, defense, and combating crime. 
He supports a strong power base and presidency in the 
Belarusian Republic. Myechyslaw Hryb supports ratification of 
the [CIS] Treaty on Collective Security. In his own words, he 
has always fulfilled his parliamentary obligations based on the 
substance of problems rather than personal preferences or 
animosities. Although all of us were involved in the old 
system, we must look ahead, he said. Here is what Myechyslaw 
Hryb told the people's deputies after he was elected Supreme 
Soviet chairman. 
  [Begin Hryb recording] Esteemed People's Deputies and 
Journalists! Let me express my sincere appreciation for the 
trust you displayed in me through this vote. I have always 
said, and will say it again now, that this post is extremely 
responsible and complex. I will try to perform my duties as my 
conscience dictates, and will do my best in this post. I hope 
that all of you will join me and actively help me in my duties. 
Because I will do nothing without you. [applause] [end 
recording]

  [Text] Minsk, 28 Jan (BELINFORM-TASS) -- In his first 
speech to deputies, Myechyslaw Hryb, the new head of the Belarus 
Supreme Soviet declared that he will endeavor to perform his 
duties in a conscientious and dignified way. He will try to 
rely on a majority in parliament and his first moves will be 
directed toward improving the work of the Presidium of the 
Supreme Soviet -- deputies are at present divided and understand 
each other poorly. There will be no change to foreign policy 
priorities. 
  Describing his attitude toward Stanislav Shushkevich, the 
new 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet said it was normal. He stressed 
that the former speaker has many fine qualities, but like anyone 
else he also has adverse traits: Shushkevich and I differed 
only on certain aspects of politics in relation to the CIS 
countries' collective security agreement. 
  Hryb regretted that the process of adopting the new 
Constitution has been subject to unjustified delay in parliament 
and stressed that ever since entering parliament he has 
constantly called for the introduction of a presidency with the 
functions of head of the executive authorities. 
  Hryb decribed the prospects for Belarus-Russian relations as 
extremely good. We are Slavs, we are neighbors. I have high 
hopes regarding the arrival in Minsk of a Russian Government 
delegation headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin. Hryb supports the 
idea of combining the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus and 
hopes that the same prices for fuel will apply in both states. 
  The new chairman of the Belarus Supreme Soviet dwelt on his 
attitude to the concept of neutrality. He announced that to be 
neutral is our wish, but pure neutrality is at present 
impossible because a foreign state's troops are on Belarus soil 
and will remain there under treaty until the year 2000. He 
supported [Prime Minister Vyacheslav] Kebich's idea of 
reorganizing the government.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] According to results of the

Myachyslaw Hryb won the necessary number of votes. He is 
chairman of the parliamentary Commission for National Security, 
Defense, and Prevention of Crime. [video shows Hryb talking to

  [Hryb] I am very confident that without unity and 
consolidation of all the forces, especially between the Supreme 
Soviet Presidium and the Supreme Soviet itself, we shall find it 
very difficult to get out of the present economic crisis. We 
should seriously address the problems of our economy and the 
questions of strengthening our economic ties with the Russian 
Federation.

  [Text] The newly elected Belarusian Parliament's Speaker 
Myechyslaw Hryb has told Interfax that he will spare no effort 
to consolidate political forces in the Republican Supreme 
Soviet. "Being very divided, we can hardly overcome the crisis 
today", he said. 
  Hryb was elected to the post of speaker on Friday to replace 
Stanislav Shushkevich, ousted by parliament. 
  The chairman-elect stressed the need for reforming the 
system 
of state power and spoke in favour of presidency in Belarus. In 
his opinion, it would be reasonable to choose a new president 
first and then elect a new parliament. 
  Calling himself a staunch advocate of his republic's 
participation in CIS collective security system, Hryb underlined 
that "it's too early to speak about Belarus pure neutrality" now 
when there is a contingent of troops from a neighboring state 
(meaning Russia - IF) in Belarus." He explained that Minsk and 
Moscow were bound by accords according to which the withdrawal 
of Russian troops from Belarus would proceed "during certain 
time." 
  Hryb declared that his election would keep the republic's 
former policy toward Russia intact, nor would it affect plans to 
integrate the monetary systems of the two countries and set up a 
firm economic alliance. 
  He favorably assessed Kebich's activity as Premier and gave 
him credit for bringing the economies of Belarus and Russia 
together.

  [Text] Minsk January 28 TASS -- Belarusian Premier 
Vyacheslav Kebich regretted that the legislature expressed 
no-confidence in speaker Stanislav Shushkevich and noted that 
they were unanimous in the main approaches to reforming the 
Belarusian state. He expressed opinion that the former 
speaker's knowledge and prestige would serve Belarus for long 
time in future. 
  The Belarusian government press service circulated here on 
Friday the premier's replies to questions on how he appraises 
parliament's vote against Shushkevich. Kebich said the 
following: 
  "I regret what has happened. Sure, we had some differences 
with Shushkevich on how to reform society and to build a 
sovereign state. Incidentally, I'd like to note that the press 
was often helpful in lending these differences unduly 
exaggerated, I would say, hypertrophic importance. 
  "However, we used to find a common language with Shushkevich 
on the main thing. We were at one on strategic approaches to 
reforming Belarusian society and saw our main task in ensuring 
the transition of the republican economy to market relations 
without any extreme actions and social upheavals. 
  "We wanted to prevent a sharp drop in living standards, to 
create gradually appropriate conditions and prerequisites for 
national revival and to maintain stability, accord and civil 
peace on Belarusian soil. 
  "We did our best for Belarus to become a full-fledged member 
of the international community and to turn into a European and 
civilised power."

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 19 (509) for </F>
28 January 1994, by diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy 
Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Regarding how he viewed the Supreme Soviet's 
decision to remove Shushkevich, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
gave an interview to the government press service. Here is the 
text of the interview which was made public by the government 
press service. 
  "I regret what happened. Of course, Stanislav Stanislavovich 
and I sometimes had certain differences over the ways to reform 
society and to build a sovereign state. By the way let me note 
that with the help of the press this fact was often exaggerated 
and, I should say, somewhat overblown. 
  "However, on the whole Shushkevich and I managed to find a 
common language. We agreed on strategical approaches to the 
reform of Belarusian society, and we thought that our main goals 
were to guarantee the transition to a market economy in the 
republic without extremism or social disasters, to prevent a 
sharp decline in the living standards of the population, to 
gradually create necessary conditions for national revival and 
to preserve stability, accord and civil peace on our land. We 
did all we could to represent Belarus in the international 
community as a dignified state and to make it a European 
civilized power. 
  "In today's complex situation we should act thoughtfully and 
carefully. Taking important political steps and decisions we 
should remember that we are living not in an isolated world, 
that our CIS neighbours and `far-away' foreign countries closely 
monitor the developments in Belarus, and count on the continuity 
of the policy pursued by the parliament and the government of 
the republic. 
  "In recent years we spent too much time and effort on the 
destruction and settlement of political accounts. Obviously, 
it's time to stop that and to start a concrete creative work for 
the economic restructuring, the privatization in the interests 
of the people and the creation of adequate living conditions for 
the people. Let me state with all responsibility that the 
reform is irreversible. We will persistently continue the 
planned reforms, strengthening our union with Russia and 
developing friendship with other states. 
  "And the last thing I would like to say in this connection. 
We should understand the current state of Shushkevich like 
human beings and support him at this difficult time." 
  According to Shushkevich's press secretary Valeriy Vorobyov, 
currently the ex-speaker is in his personal countryside house. 
In the evening of the day he was dismissed the government 
communication line with his house was disconnected, but it was 
decided that a limited number of personal guards should stay 
with him.

<F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondent Vladimir Glod for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Minsk, 30 Jan -- For three days following his 
removal from the post of Supreme Soviet chairman of the Republic 
of Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich gave no interviews. The 
reason: The need to let the emotions cool, calm down, and think 
about many things. 
  I found Stanislav Shushkevich at his dacha, 45 kilometers 
from Minsk. Here he has 450 square meters of land in a 
university allotment society. Compared to the other buildings 
here, his looks like a toadstool among chanterelles. "I do not 
have any other dachas," the ex-speaker explained. "Neither I, 
nor my family, ever lived in the one issued to me by the Supreme 
Soviet Presidium. It was only used as a residence for official 
receptions." 
  Almost everything at the dacha is Shushkevich's own work. He 
did use the services of the Maintenance and Construction 
Department attached to the Council of Ministers when he needed 
welding and plastering work done, and paid for it in full. "If 
anyone thinks that this department works for cheap, then they 
are completely wrong. Over the past two years all my wages have 
been ploughed into this dacha. We are living on my wife's 
money." 
  When Vice Rector Shushkevich moved out of his two-room 
apartment in a university block for a new home he did not leave 
it to his mother-in-law, as was alleged in parliament by 
Aleksandr Lukashenko, the chairman of the Commission on 
Organized Crime, but handed it back to the university. It is 
now occupied by a Mr. Klevchen, a lecturer at that establishment. 
  I deliberately mention this in detail, because one of the 
allegations made against Shushkevich when he lost his post was 
of personal immodesty. To my puzzled question of why he is 
telling me this instead of the Supreme Soviet, the former 
speaker answered: "That is the way I was brought up. I was 
taught that there is a presumption of innocence. So I think it 
below my dignity to get involved in a debate on this dirt. But 
I also cannot prove that I am not a camel." 
  Stanislav Shushkevich said that if time were to transport 
him 
back to his university lecture theater, he would still have 
taken the same path. "There was a lot I wanted to do, but it 
was impossible to escape the realities when my options were 
restricted. My main goal was to create Belarusian statehood, so 
that a sovereign, democratic, and civilized state appeared in 
Europe. I really wanted our Supreme Soviet to be democratic, 
and less polarized, unruly and confrontation-minded, I wanted it 
to be centrist. But unfortunately, in this I failed." 
  Asked about the true reasons for his departure, the former 
Supreme Soviet chairman replied: "I do not suit the majority in 
this Supreme Soviet. It does not want to build a new society, 
and most of the deputies we have now want to return to the old 
order. To this day I cannot understand how I managed to get to 
lead the Supreme Soviet. The Communist majority in Autumn 1991 
was fantastically frightened, and my election was a chance 
occurrence, not an inevitability." 
  Shushkevich acknowledged that he now realizes that he 
underestimated the bureaucratic games. "It was hugely difficult 
for me. My first deputy was often ill. On at least 10 
occasions I proposed candidates for the vacant post of deputy to 
the head of the Supreme Soviet, and every time these people, 
including the current chairman, Myechyslaw Hryb, blocked me. 
Now I realize that most of them were doing this deliberately, 
so that I could not rely on an assistant to handle the economic 
or organizational issues." 
  Two other circumstances were a strong hindrance to the 
ex-speaker. First, there was no centrist bloc in the Belarus 
Supreme Soviet, which instead was split into a huge majority and 
small opposition. Secondly, the Supreme Soviet, which was not 
made up of professional MPs, became an offshoot of the 
executive. I asked Shushkevich whether, realizing his 
powerlessness, he had ever wanted to just quit and slam the door 
behind him. He answered: "No, I did not, and for one reason 
alone. I felt that as the Supreme Soviet head there was, 
nonetheless, a time when I would be able to counter the 
anti-reformists." 
  Stanislav Shushkevich thinks that the ideal system for 
Belarus is a parliamentary republic. But mindful of the overall 
instability and fractiousness, it is essential to temporarily 
elect a president. Will he run for election? "I have not yet 
made up my mind," he replied. 
  Asked whether his departure is a precedent for Boris Yeltsin 
or Leonid Kravchuk, Stanislav Shushkevich said that the events 
in Belarus should not be compared to those in Russia or the 
Ukraine. 
  The ex-speaker confessed that he expected to have to go at 
least a month earlier. The parliamentary majority was strongly 
against U.S. President Clinton coming to Minsk and recognizing 
Belarus as an independent European state. "I am delighted that 
Clinton's visit and the talks between our countries went ahead 
and that he was able to form an opinion about Belarus," 
Stanislav Shushkevich said. 
  Comparing the pace of economic reform in Belarus and Russia, 
the former speaker said that Russia, under the guidance of Yegor 
Gaydar, for whom he has enormous respect, has moved on ahead. 
Belarus has noticeably lagged behind its partner to the East. 
Over 70 years of Communist influence have shown itself to have 
had a far from good impact on the psychology of the Belarusian 
people. "If the market reforms are scrapped, then I would have 
the gloomiest of forecasts for the future," Stanislav 
Shushkevich said. 
  "The market reforms in Belarus were never properly 
formulated," Shushkevich commented, which is why he fears that 
Belarus could fall behind in this process. 
  Stanislav Shushkevich said this of his successor, Myechyslaw 
Hryb: "We get on normally, although we differed on the 
Collective Security Treaty. Myechyslaw Ivanovich can adapt to 
any situation and, I have to think, his candidature is fully to 
the liking of the present Supreme Soviet." 
  On his plans for the near future, he said, "I have only had 
10 days vacation during the past year, and now I want to take a 
break for a while. I will probably go to Bonn for a week, 
because I have a long-standing invitation to read some lectures. 
After that, we will see."

<F P=106> [By BELINFORM for ITAR-TASS] </F>
  [Text] Minsk January 30 TASS -- Stanislav Shushkevich's 
removal from the speaker's post was inevitable, Belarusian 
newspapers say commenting upon last changes in the Belarusian 
parliament. 
  According to RESPUBLIKA (THE REPUBLIC), Shushkevich has 
become disagreeable to everybody in the parliament. 
  "The parliament majority was not satisfied with his strongly 
negative attitude to the treaty on collective security, his 
uncertain stance on prospects of uniting Russian and Belarusian 
monetary systems, as well as on what sort of state system should 
be created in Belarus, and his keep-away from economic problems. 
  "On the other hand, Shushkevich was objectionable to the 
parliament opposition who has shifted to radical nationalist or 
apparently pro-western views", the newspaper says. 
  In RESPUBLIKA's opinion, another reason for ousting the 
unconvenient leader was that it was necessary to find and 
publicly demonstrate the major "culprit" of the delay in 
drafting a new constitution to masque the parliament's own 
failures. Otherwise, the parliament would face a threat of 
early elections, no faction in the parliament was interested in. 
  However, according to the newspaper, Shushkevich's removal 
can hardly solve the parliament's problems, it will rather 
generate new ones. A "buffer" policy of the former speaker, 
though not facilitating the work on the draft constitution, 
sometimes made it possible to find a compromise between 
different factions and groups in the parliament. 
  We cannot say with certainty that this will be possible 
insofar, as the parliament is now broken into two uncompromising 
camps, the newspaper concludes. 
  "Shushkevich appeared a weak politician, who failed to 
realize until the very end that he does not fit the post", 
Anatoliy Maysenya, president of the centre for strategic studies 
"East-West" said in an interview with the SEM DNEY (the SEVEN 
DAYS), one of the most popular weekly papers in the republic. 
  "His (Shushkevich's) permanent complaints about the lack of 
powers, about a relativity of the very post of the speaker only 
prove this", he added. "Genuine politicians never ask for power, 
they struggle for it and take it, and this is the essence of 
policy-making". 
  "He has become a sort of stationary scenery picturing 
democratic hopes on the Belarusian political scene, over which 
both those marching to the right and those going to the left 
have become stumbling with an increasing frequency. Nothing has 
changed with his ousting". 
  "Stanislav Shushkevich failed to protect himself and his 
values", Maysenya resumes. 
  However, the Belarusian press does not give much attention 
to 
Shushkevich, being more concerned over the future. "People are 
tired", chief editor of SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA (the SOVIET 
BELARUS) Igor Osinskiy writes addressing both the speaker and 
the deputies. 
  "Our politicians are living in the vacuum, they do not hear 
and understand not only each other but the people on whose 
behalf they are acting and to whose opinion they like to refer. 
  "If they could hear people, the former speaker would be 
ashamed to state that the Belarusians whole-heartedly welcomed 
the Mishkuli agreement. If they could hear people, the 
parliament opposition would know that the Belarusians are 
against the imposed Belarusification and break of relations with 
Russia." 
  "You have exhausted the patience of the people, gentlemen. 
Go home", Osinsky says.

  [Text] The monetary union between Belarus and Russia has no 
future, Valeriy Dashkevich, counselor to the Belarus National 
Bank chief, stated. 
  V. Dashkevich considers that "Gaydar acted correctly, as you 
cannot combine market methods of managing the economy with 
administrative ones." 
  In Dashkevich's opinion, if the Russian and Belarusian 
Governments adopt such a decision, it "will soon demonstrate its 
unviability and force Belarus to return to setting up a 
full-fledged monetary system." 
  "If a short-term effect is possible at the initial stage, 
the 
negative consequences associated with superimposing Russia's 
internal economic disorder onto the Belarusian economy, will 
become apparent by the end of the year." 
  The Russian Federation and Belarusian premiers signed a 
statement in Moscow on the upcoming union of the two countries' 
monetary systems.

  [Text] Minsk, 28 Jan -- Almost 800 Belarusian Air Force 
pilots have left the Armed Forces of Belarus and are now 
guarding the skies of Russia. Those who have left accounted for 
60 percent of air crews of the Belarus Air Force, the RESPUBLIKA 
government newspaper reports today. 
  The Belarus Airborne Assault Troops have also been 
considerably weakened by the mass exodus to Russia: 339 
officers have joined the Russian forces. The republic's 
Committee for the Social Protection of Servicemen reports that a 
further 2,500 officers want to go to Russia. The problem is 
made worse by the fact that over half the Belarus men graduating 
from Russian military colleges in 1994 have already signed up to 
serve in its' Armed Forces. The main reason for this is that a 
higher level of social guarantees are enjoyed there.

  [Text] Tiraspol, BASAPRESS, 28/1/1994 -- From our 
correspondent: Today's DNESTROVSKAYA PRAVDA published the 
decree signed by Dniester President Igor Smirnov on applying 
measures of consolidation of the so-called Dniester Republic. 
The document mentions that citizenship is a necessary attribute 
of the republic's sovereignty. Starting with February 15th 
1994, posts of leaders of state bodies, enterprises, 
institutions and organizations can only be granted to persons 
having Dniester citizenship. These stipulations of the decree 
also concern state functionaries. Leaders not pursuing to the 
document will be fired, the document states. Minister and 
departments are obliged to present until February 20th 
information on the decree's fulfillment. Until now, a large 
part of east regions population, including state functionaries 
and deputies, have refused to adopt the citizenship of the 
self-proclaimed republic. Those who adopted it do not exceed 
60,000 or 10 percent of the region's population. Previously, it 
was decided to prolong the term of registering the citizenship 
until January 1st 1995.

  [Text] Chisinau January 28 TASS -- The chairman of the 
Dniester Republic's Supreme Soviet, Grigoriy Marakutsa, 
announced on Monday that he sees no reason why the republic 
should not engage in negotiations with the Moldovan leadership 
on the status of the still-unrecognized breakaway republic. 
  Marakutsa thinks that the problems which have recently 
arisen 
are due to the trial of the "Ilascu group", whose six members, 
supporters of the Moldovan Popular Front, were convicted by 
Tiraspol (the capital of the Dniester republic) of committing 
acts of terrorism during last year's military conflict in the 
Trans-Dniester region. 
  According to Marakutsa, international organisations have 
appealed to Tiraspol not to carry out the death penalty given to 
Ilie Ilascu, the leader of the group. "We are not going to 
insist" on the ultimate punishment, the republic's parliamentary 
leader declared, "but the convicted have to be punished somehow". 
  According to Marakutsa, "the possibility of a new 
independent 
court investigation of the Ilascu group, as many international 
organisations have proposed, has not been ruled out".

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRES, 28/1/1994 -- Dniester's problem 
will be solved only by the new Moldovan leadership once the 
consequences of Ribbentrop-Molotov pact are liquidated and 
territories occupied after World War II are returned with the 
participation of the interested states -- Romania and Ukraine, 
says the newspaper GLASUL NATIUNII (Voice of Nation). Dniester 
practically no longer belongs to Moldova, states the newspaper. 
The lasting negotiations between Chisinau and Tiraspol, the war 
in summer 1992, and the Ilascu trial proves that Moldovan 
authorities have no influence on so-called Dniester Republic, 
says the newspaper. Moldovans no longer represent 40 percent of 
Dniester population, most of them were assimilated by the 
Ukrainian and Russian ethnics. The newspaper appraises that 
Dniester will not exist as an independent state. Separated from 
Russia by Ukrainian borders, it can rather become an annex of 
one of these two states. The newspaper adds that Dniester 
leadership plays a secondary role in settling the Dniester's 
problem. It can be solved by Russian and Moldovan leadership, 
concludes the newspaper.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 27/1/1994 -- Dumitru Motpan, 
Moldovan Agrarian Democratic Party [PDAM] chairman, and Petru 
Lucinschi, speaker of Moldova's Parliament and a candidate on 
the PDAM list, stated today in a press conference that the 
Christian-Democratic Popular Front of Moldova [FPCDM] is sending 
special groups to the meetings of PDAM followers to hinder the 
meetings. PDAM candidate Nicolae Andronic said that the Central 
Electoral Commission (CEC) members are directly influenced by 
FPCDM followers. Talking about the basic problems of the 
electorate, Lucinschi declared that the eventual unification of 
Moldova and Romania, by a Parliament's decision, would be the 
"sure way to war" and would mean the losing of the Dniester and 
the Gagauz regions, causing interethnic conflicts in urban 
centers, most of whose population is not local. Under such 
circumstances, the menace of separatism in the republic's north 
could appear. In addition, Moldova could lose the support of 
the international community. Lucinschi believes that the return 
to power of the current leaders, in case PDAM wins the 
elections, will be for the world community a guarantee that 
Moldova will follow the course initiated in Chisinau. The 
parliament speaker added that Moldova has yet no document to 
confirm its independence. The declarations on sovereignty and 
independence, adopted in parliament, should be confirmed by a 
referendum to show the people's will, said Lucinschi. 
Commenting the idea of a referendum on the unification, 
organized in both Romanian states, Lucinschi considers that in 
this case "we will unite with Yugoslavia" and "the war will not 
be limited between Prut and Dniester." The parliament speaker 
and another PDAM leader, Dumitru Diacov, asserted that the 
absolute majority of the population, both in Moldova and 
Romania, are against the unification. Lucinschi said that 
during the electoral campaign he does not plan any visit to the 
left bank of the Dniester River or meetings with Tiraspol 
leaders.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 28/1/1994 -- The extended 
session of the Moldovan Prosecutor's Office College took place 
today, with the participation of President Mircea Snegur and 
Speaker Petru Lucinschi. The report of the Prosecutor's Office 
activity in 1993 was read at the session, states the 
Presidential Press Service. Snegur declared that Moldova enjoys 
the support of international organizations and has the chance to 
successfully perform political reforms. However, concerning the 
domestic affairs, "difficulties are considerable and continue to 
aggravate." The economic crisis, the population's bad material 
condition, the new bureaucracy that blocks the reforms, "on the 
background of obvious cases of corruption of administrative 
apparatus and its junctions, sometimes, with Mafia structures, 
endangers the republic's independence and sovereignty 
themselves," said the president. Snegur asserted that law 
infringements are committed in privatization. "A massive 
control last year proved that from 600 enterprises, illicit 
privatization of fixed funds was detected in 200." Speaking 
about economic violations that brought big prejudices to the 
republic, Mircea Snegur mentioned the policy of unfounded 
credits, illegal issue of licenses for export of material 
resources, law violations while constituting the initial capital 
of non-state economic structures, created partially on state 
property, improper use of buildings, illicit distribution of 
lodging. Snegur mentioned among measures to improve the 
situation the discussion by the future Parliament of legislative 
acts, the display of the activity of justice bodies, including 
the Prosecutor's Office, the enhancement of methods of analyzing 
and quickly informing the Parliament and republic's leadership, 
states the communique.

states a communique of the Presidential Press Service. Tanaka 
estimated that IBRD is very attentive to the changes in Moldova 
in promoting the reform, being deeply interested in their 
success. Mission members have highly appreciated the competence 
of banking factors, who guide the monetary mass, not admitting 
the reduction of Moldovan leu's course. They asserted that 
Moldova, having finest wine reserves, could stand the 
stabilization period by selling it if the menace of devaluation 
appears. Mircea Snegur said he is aware of the grave problem of 
social protection of vulnerable layers, for whose solution 
special efforts are being made. The President declared his 
dissatisfaction with the rhythm of privatization, adding that he 
will sign a series of decrees to hasten the process.

  [Text] The results of Russia's December election can 
somewhat be repeated in Moldova's general elections, 
Presidential Adviser Anatol Cebanu told Interfax. He spoke of 
similar mentality on the ground and disarray within the 
democratic camp. 
  Cebanu does not rule out that the Agrarian-Democratic Party 
may win at least 30 percent of the vote. However, the Alliance 
of Socialists and Unity Movement has the chance of doing the 
same, he believes. 
  The Women's Association may perform well if the vote follows 
a Russian scenario, Cebanu said adding that the Peasants and 
Intelligentsia bloc and the Alliance of Christian Democratic 
People's Front which may win 10 percent of the vote each are 
likely to forge a single parliamentary group. 
  Cebanu is sceptical about the chances by the Socialist 
Democratic, Democratic and Reform Parties to overcome the 4 
percent barrier needed to form a faction. 
  It is most important that people caring for internal peace 
and stability came to power, Cebanu stressed. But we will be in 
for the worst time if ant-independence forces win the election, 
he said.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 27/1/1994 -- During yesterday's 
session, Moldovan Parliamentary Presidium ratified the 
Moldovan-Ukrainian intergovernmental agreement on negotiating 
the state credit granted to Ukraine by Moldova in 1992. The 
Parliamentary Press Service informed BASA that the debts between 
the two states for 1993 were not calculated yet and the credit 
examined by the Presidium supposes the attestation of a sum of 
$28,400,000 dollars indebted by Ukraine to Moldova for Moldovan 
foodstuffs and industrial products. The credit will be 
reimbursed chiefly by supplying energy agents from Ukraine. The 
Presidium also examined the questions concerning the granting of 
privileges of not paying excises to "Malovata" farm, Dubasari; 
payment by Moldova of the fee as a member of European Radio and 
TV Union; approval of expenditures of National Bank and the 
newspaper NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA for 1994. Also, the Presidium 
discussed the participation of Parliament's leadership in 
elections. It was decided that Presidium members will 
participate in elections without being dismissed, but they will 
not use the state technical means.

  [Text] Bishkek January 31 TASS -- A referendum of 
confidence in Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev, held on January 30, 
ended in a landslide victory for his policy. An many as 96.2 
per cent of citizens who participated in the poll supported the 
Kyrgyz leader. 
  A total of 95.9 per cent of Kyrgyz residents having voting 
rights participated in the referendum. These preliminary 
results were made public by Presidential Press Secretary 
Imankadyr Rysaliyev at a briefing on Monday [31 January].

that the Kyrgyz people have rallied behind the acknowledged 
leader -- Askar Akayev," the press secretary stressed. "People 
supported the policy of reforms and the policy of ethnic peace 
and quietude at our homeland." 
  "The success at the referendum necessitates sharp 
radicalisation of reforms, and they will follow," Rysaliyev 
continued. "It is necessary to consolidate all the arms of 
government, to establish law and order, to improve labour 
discipline as well as to step up struggle against corruption." 
  Replying to journalists, the press secretary spurned down 
accusations of forging voting results at the referendum. 
  He stressed that the poll was monitored by representatives

diplomats accredited to Bishkek and journalists from foreign 
countries. 
  "Not a single representative said anything about some 
pressure or violations of generally recognised rules of 
referendum," the press secretary stressed.

  [Text] Yesterday the people of Kyrgyzstan participated in 
the nationwide referendum. Those who voted for President Akayev 
voted for the new economic reform, for the future calm in the 
republic, and for our prosperity. Medetbay Sherimkulov, 
chairman of the Supreme Council, voted to express confidence in 
Askar Akayev. Following is an interview Mr. Sherimkulov gave to 
our correspondent: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. 
Sherimkulov, this January is a very memorable time for our 
state. What would you like to say about the referendum? 
  [Sherimkulov] This is the first referendum since Kyrgyzstan 
became an independent state. It is important because if the 
nation expresses confidece in Askar Akayev his term of office 
will last until 1996. It is not only showing confidence in 
Akayev, but also giving the leadership an opportunity for 
another two years to continue to implement the reform. If the 
reform is implemented, we can move forward. It means we will 
not reverse course or deviate from it. Frankly, we have spent 
many years aspiring to build socialism and communism, and in the 
final analysis what we have now is neither socialism nor 
capitalism. But our aim is to bring good to the country. This 
is a very important period for reforms. Frankly, we have many 
problems in the economy. We have to bring our laws in line with 
the process of reform. I want to repeat: Those who vote for 
Akayev will give him additional time to implement these reforms. 
Well, I know it is forbidden to campaign on referendum day 
[laughs] but this is just my personal opinion. Frankly, our new 
life and all aspirations are connected with the name of Askar 
Akayev. Thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev believes that his 
country can truly become economically independent only with 
assistance from Russia. Speaking at a press conference in 
Bishkek on Thursday [27 January], the president emphasized that 
the arrival of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the 
visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin planned for 
February "would assist with settlement of the issues concerning 
support of Kyrgyz industrial enterprises which directly depend 
on economic relations with Russia." "If we break these 
relations, there is a risk for the Kyrgyz to go back to their 
traditional nomadic life of cattle breeders," the president 
pointed out. 
  For the time being, it is impossible to resolve the current 
economic issues, like supplies of equipment and fuel material 
and lubricants, without the assistance provided by Russia. This 
also threatens the future of agriculture. 
  In connection with this, the president emphasized that dual 
citizenship would conform with the interests in preserving the 
economic potential of Kyrgyzstan, since this would help to 
maintain the working potential of plants where most workers were 
Russians. He refuted the assertion that this might lead to 
destabilization of inter-ethnic relations. 
  Commenting on the changes in the Russian government, the 
Kyrgyz president said that the situation should not be 
exaggerated. "The reforms in Russia will continue since now they 
are irreversible," Akayev pointed out. In his opinion, 
Chernomyrdin was the man who could carry out the policy of 
economic reforms in Russia. 
  Akayev said that if he won the January 30 referendum on 
confidence in him he would take resolute steps to make the 
reforms more rapid. "Kyrgyzstan can't afford to waste any time, 
because it has huge debts which could go on snowballing," he 
said. 
  He said the referendum, called on his own initiative, had 
three goals to pursue: first, to confirm the authority of the 
head of state, who, under the new constitution, must be 
guarantee of stability and of a balance between the three 
branches of government; second, to confirm the policy of reform; 
and, third, to stabilize the political situation in the republic. 
  The president said he would never dissolve parliament, for 
it 
had been elected by the people, although under the former 
regime. "Only the people themselves can determine the future of 
parliament," he said. 
  Akayev said that, during his trips within Kyrgyzstan, he had 
come to the conclusion that the population supported the reform 
policy but was dissatisfied with the form privatization was 
taking. For this reason, he was going to take measures to set 
up bodies for combatting corruption and strengthening the 
republic's economic security, he said. 
  The same day, Akayev addressed the nation on television and 
radio. He said the main objective of his policy was to reach 
ethnic conciliation in the republic and that he would "step up 
his efforts to establish civil peace in Kyrgyzstan." 
  He said that, as head of state, he had been doing his best 
to 
mitigate the effects of the economic crisis and the social and 
political shocks experienced by the republic. "My conscience is 
clear," he said. 
  He said economic problems that had been taking shape for 
decades could not be solved within a few months. Today "all 
citizens of the country, all political parties and movements, 
both left-wing and right-wing ones, both communists and 
centrists, stand for market economics, for freedom for the 
powerful and support for the weak," Akayev said. He said the 
disagreements were over how rapid the reforms should be and over 
their social aspect. There was a need for compromise, he said. 
  Akayev said the mechanism to control the economic situation 
was being put into operation "slowly but surely." He said that, 
by introducing its own currency, Kyrgyzstan had evaded many 
economic upheavals. The country had also managed to restore its 
economic ties with other former Soviet republics, in particular 
Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the first step towards which 
was the lifting of customs barriers, the president said. 
  "We are in the process of forming a single economic area 
with 
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan," he said. 
  Akayev said that, if he won the referendum, he would take 
immediate measures to strengthen discipline, give an impulse to 
the agrarian reform, solve energy and transport problems, 
support medium-sized and small businesses, create an atmosphere 
of social partnership between the government, business and trade 
unions, and improve the position of the pensioners.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Askar Akayev by unidentified </F>
correspondent; place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Akayev, in Russian] We do not want to create a 
commonplace mentality in our people. Of course, it should 
combine the best features that every nation has. We will be 
able to get out of the current crisis provided we observe this 
condition. Our national policy naturally envisages protection 
of rights of all the peoples [words indistinct] of Kyrgyzstan. 
I believe that this is the guarantee for our future, peace, 
calm, and accord. 
  [Correspondent] We are implementing the policy of market 
reforms in our country and life has become exceptionally 
difficult for our people. There are lots of cases when people 
haven't been paid their salaries, students their scholarships, 
children's allowances haven't be granted in time as well as 
pensions. People complain about that. It worries them. What 
can you say about that? 
  [Akayev] We are implementing market reforms in our country 
and unfortunately they are not proceeding as they should. 
Indeed, life is becoming more difficult. We should carry out a 
socially oriented policy and support our less well off sections 
of society.If pensions, wages and scholarships have been paid in 
time this would have partly solved their problems. Therefore, 
we have set up a state commission under the president of our 
republic with the aim of supervising the issue of timely payment 
of them. It should exercise control over a timely payment of 
salaries, stipends and pensions and it will work for as long as 
needed. [sentence indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] Can you tell us few words about our foreign 
policy? 
  [Akayev] We have been recognized and established contacts 
with many democratic countries of the world [words indistinct]. 
If we speak about our priorities, our first priority is to have 
historically friendly relations with such countries as Russia, 
Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. This is our main priority. Apart 
from this, with the introduction of economic reforms and 
democratic transformations, we have established good relations 
with the United States, Japan, Germany, Turkey, Switzerland, and 
other countries. We also have good relations with the Muslim 
countries and China -- we have signed agreements with them on 
friendship, cooperation and mutual understanding. Kyrgyzstan, 
as an equal among equals, has its own embassies and consulates 
in various countries. [passage indistinct] 
  [Correspondent, in Russian] I wanted to ask you a question 
about socio-economic (?reforms). We have received a letter with 
this question. It has been sent to us by Sholpon Adilbekova, a 
student of the foreign language college of Kyrgyzstan. Here is 
the question: Askar Akayevich! I have familiarized myself with 
your concept for socio-economic strategy and I fully support it. 
But are you sure that the government will be able to implement 
this program. What is you view [words indistinct]? 
  [Akayev, in Russian] First of all, I would like to express 
my 
deepest gratitude to Sholpon. I am pleased that even students 
are following with great interest ways of Kyrgyzstan's 
development. They will have to build a democratic and legal 
state one day and the foundation for it is being built by us. 
It has been enshrined by the Constitution of Kyrgyzstan. Young 
people will have to build a free market economy which will focus 
its attention on man and his interests. Therefore, we have set 
a goal of not only building a market economy but of building a 
socially oriented market economy which will protect interests of 
our young people. The one which will provide them with jobs and 
opportunities to reveal their talents and their potential. 
  With regard to implementation of this program I am sure 
that, 
we with a new government, will be able to implement the program 
of reforms. The new government has been supported by the 
parliament. I have met people in practically all the regions of 
the republic and people on the whole support the new government. 
With regard to the president -- he, according to the new 
constitution, has the right to exercise control over the 
government's work. The president has the right to chair the 
government's sessions during its examination of the most 
important issues of socio-economic development and to take the 
decisions. I want our young people to know that we are not 
going to turn back from our path of reforms. And we will 
achieve success in their implementation. [passage indistinct]

  [Excerpt] Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev held a meeting 
with the most active representatives of the capital's public. 
Representatives of different parties, movements, public 
organizations, district (?hakimats), various nationalities, and 
intelligentsia gathered together in the State History Museum 
building. 
  Bishkek Mayor Ibraimov addressed those present. He drew 
their attention to the fact of the utmost importance of the 
meeting between the head of state and citizens of Bishkek. He 
said that major intellectual, scientific, and industrial forces 
are represented in the capital. Bishkek is a sort of a 
barometer of Kyrgyzstan's conscience. 
  President Askar Akayev emphasized the importance of the 
meeting. He presented a speech, saying that all the regions of 
the country were attempting to equal Bishkek. It should set a 
good example of stable peace and prosperity. Therefore, topical 
problems have to be solved first in the capital. One of them is 
the restoration and revival of industry. Kyrgyzstan should 
develop further as an industrial state and Russia should become 
its main partner. This choice was made by Kyrgyz ancestors who 
understood the importance of the union. We should hand on the 
friendship baton to future generations. 
  The president reminded those present of the unselfish 
assistance that was rendered to Kyrgyzstan by Russia at times of 
emergencies. He also said that the spring sowing campaign is 
approaching and we do not have any machinery or spare parts. We 
are short of fuel and mineral resources. Around 1 billion soms 
will be needed for the sowing campaign. Where can we get this 
money? 
  We pin great hopes on the upcoming visit to Kyrgyzstan by 
Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. It is expected that a 
number of documents on economic cooperation will be signed. Our 
main goal is to preserve the intellectual potential which is the 
important asset of the country, said the head of state. We 
should cleverly use our experts. They represent our nation, it 
is a locomotive which is ascribed to play a major role in 
lifting the country's economy out of crisis and help in building 
an industrial state. Of course they need to be socially 
protected. Commissions have been set up in the government so as 
to supervise the timely payment of wages [to them] since these 
categories of workers mainly rely on their wages. 
  The president also spoke about dual citizenship. The 
president believes that the migration of Russians could only be 
stopped provided we show our good attitude -- by introducing 
dual citizenship. 
  Akayev urged people to get rid of the psychology of national 
self-conceit and to get rid of it, not only in politics, but 
also in everyday life. Let us be united and set a good example 
to other regions. Each ethnic group should feel safe and secure 
in Bishkek. By doing this we will maintain our independence, 
strengthen it, defend sovereignty, and build a healthy market 
economy. Only peace and stability can contribute to 
facilitating economic reforms. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Kyrgyz Government issued the following 
resolution "On the stimulation of production and the sale of 
agricultural produce in 1994". 
  The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic notes that despite a 
number of measures which have been taken, a decline in the 
production and sales of produce in the agrarian sector is 
continuing. Correspondingly, the level of consumption of food 
products by the population is also decreasing. The processing 
industry produces less as well. Industrial enterprises are not 
sufficiently provided with raw material. 
  According to preliminary data, in 1993 the gross output of 
production in all categories of farms decreased compared with 
1992 by 8 percent in comparable prices. Last year the sowing 
area for cereals was enlarged by 64,000 hectares compared with 
1992. Nevertheless, gross harvest figures, including corn, did 
not exceed the 1992 level and equaled 1,693,000 [metric] tonnes. 
The yield of cereals per hectare was 1.1 quintals less than 
planned. As a result of reducing the sowing area under corn for 
seed by 18,000 hectares, or 28 percent, and the decrease of its 
yield by 6.2 quintals a hactare, the output of corn decreased by 
93,000 tonnes, or by 43 percent. Similarly poor results were 
obtained in 1993 in potato, vegetables, berry and fruit, and 
grape growing. About 290,000 tonnes of potatoes were produced, 
which is 20 percent less. Only 249,000 tonnes of vegetables were 
harvested, which is 1.4 times less than in 1992. 
  Due to the decrease in yield and the slow rates of 
harvesting 
of some crops, certain loss of produce took place: 62,000 tonnes 
of cereals were not received nor 10,500 tonnes of beetroot; 
1,200 tonnes of sunflower; 41,000 tonnes of vegetables and 
22,000 tonnes of potatoes. As before, the situation in 
agriculture is complicated. The number of cattle in all 
categories of farms decreased by 8 percent compared with 1992, 
of sheep and goats by 12 percent; of hogs by 32 percent; of 
horses by 3 percent. The production of meat in live weight 
decreased by 2 percent, of milk by 2 percent; of wool by 9 
percent. 
  As a result of the decrease in the production of 
agricultural 
produce and disadvantages of the finance and crediting policy in 
the rural area, procuring organizations have decreased their 
volumes of procurement and failed to deliver the right amount 
for the needs of the state. In order to stimulate the 
production and sale of agricultural produce, the Kyrgyz 
Government resolves: 
  First, to set a minimum volume of the procurement of 
agricultural produce by procurement organizations and processing 
industries for the needs of the state and the level of 
guaranteed procurement prices for these products, without value 
added tax, in line with appendix M1; 
  Second, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Products of the 
Kyrgyz Republic, the Kyrgyzchleboprodukt republican production 
amalgamation, the Kyrgyztamakash state concern should, in two 
months, conclude agreements with producers in all forms of 
ownership for the procurement of agricultural produce. Oblast 
and rayon state administrations should urgently define the 
optimum structure of sowing areas and numbers of cattle for 1994 
and provide assistance to procurement organizations and 
processing industries in concluding agreements for the 
procurement of produce; 
  Third, to recommend that the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan and 
joint stock and commercial banks should, in one month, provide 
credit resources to procurement organizations and processing 
enterprises in order for them to be able to advance money to 
producers of agricultural goods in the amount of 25 percent of 
the minimum volume of procurement. 
  Fourth, the Kyrgyzstan State Committee for Economy, the 
Ministry of Agriculture of the Kyrgyz Republic, the 
Kyrgyzchleboprodukt republican production amalgamation and the

  [Text] Moscow January 29 TASS--"The Tajik armed opposition 
operating from northern Afghanistan is bracing for armed actions 
this spring," the commander of Russian border troops in 
Tajikistan, Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Chechulin, said in a 
telephone interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday. 
  "Tajik opposition leaders supported by Afghan mujahideen do 
not abandon attempts to smuggle gunmen, arms and narcotics 
across the border," the commander said. Russian border guards 
thwart their actions virtually every day." 
  "The past day was no exception," Chechulin continued. Troops 
at the Pyandzh border section frustrated, on Saturday, an 
attempt to smuggle weapons and drugs across the border. Gunmen 
and narcotics were seized as a result of efficient actions by 
Russian border guards. 
  The commander noted that militants use caches more often now 
to smuggle arms. For instance, troops at the Moscovskiy border 
section spotted a cache with great quantities of mines and 
ammunition for firearms.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Berezovskiy report under "Near Neighbors" rubric: </F>
"Forces Have United on the Border"] 
  [Text] Ashgabat -- Boris Yeltsin and Saparmurad Niyazov 
signed an intergovernmental agreement in Ashgabat last December 
on joint guarding of Turkmenistan's border and on the Russian 
servicemen's status. What gave rise to this document, and what 
has it changed in the life of our soldiers? Vladislav 
Shunevich, chief of staff and first deputy commander of 
Turkmenistan's border troops, speaks: 
  "Turkmenia's state border has always been complex. It is 
2,472.1 km long. It extends over mountains and desert sands, 
along rivers, and across the Caspian. In the old union it was 
`covered' by the Central Asia Border District. As of 11 August 
1992 the guarding of the border passed entirely into the hands 
of Turkmenistan. I will not say that these changes caused a 
disaster. But the `green caps' encountered serious problems. 
Owing to the rupture of ties with Russia, it became difficult to 
maintain in `combat readiness' the various obstacles in the path 
of possible violators. 
  "In previous years it was mainly Slav officers and soldiers 
who were sent to the USSR's southern border. It was thought 
that they stood up better to the heat here and, moreover, any 
contact with Iranians and Afghans was ruled out on ethnic 
grounds. After Ukraine and Belarus demanded the return of their 
servicemen before 31 [date as published] November, and the 
Russian Supreme Soviet of its troops before 31 December 1993, a 
mass exodus began. Incidentally, the last six compulsory-service 
Russian soldiers left the border literally one month ago. Here 
I will emphasize that there was not a single case of desertion! 
As a rule, officers were transferred back home only after they 
had trained a replacement. Nevertheless, we have run into an 
acute shortage of professionals. 
  "A partial solution has been found. A school for junior 
officers `forges' lieutenants and ensigns in the space of three 
months. Students drafted from higher educational institutions 
have closed up the breaches among specialists in communications 
and in motor vehicle and aviation hardware. University 
graduates have become deputy commanders for work with personnel, 
henceforth made up entirely of residents of Turkmenia. 
  "Today one-half of the officers are already Turkmens. But we 
risked losing the Russian servicemen who had stayed -- the 
backbone of the commander corps. The first talks began under 
Russian Security Minister Barannikov. They soon reached 
impasse. The deadlock was overcome when Andrey Nikolayev came 
to head the Russian Federation's border troops. Much was 
resolved by his talks with President Saparmurad Niyazov of 
Turkmenistan -- knots of problems were `unraveled.' 
  "A joint command has been set up, headed by the commander of 
Turkmenistan's border troops. He has two deputies. I, the 
chief of staff, am one, and the other is the chief of the 
Russian Border Troops Operations Group, to whom all the Russian 
servicemen are subordinate. The Russian Federation has taken on 
their funding, while Turkmenistan will pay for the supply of 
hardware, ammunition, and arms. The most important thing is 
that the Russian officer can continue to serve calmly. He 
retains all rights and privileges indefinitely. You know, some 
officers who had tendered requests for a transfer have now 
withdrawn them. 
  "What is service like for the Russian officer in Turkmenia? 
There are no problems with housing or children's schooling. 
All school graduates whose fathers are serving in the Border 
Troops Directorate entered institutes or universities last year. 
Wages are paid at the officer's request either in manats or in 
rubles. There is no question of discrimination along ethnic 
lines. All the border detachment chiefs of staff are Russian 
officers. Yes, language problems do arise. But the Turkmens 
speak Russian, and all orders are given in it. Office work is 
also done in Russian. 
  "The signed agreement is also advantageous to Russia. 
Afghanistan remains a zone of heightened tension. The Turkmen 
leadership maintains close, good relations with the leaders of 
the northwestern provinces -- Turan Ismail Khan and Rashid 
Dostam -- but this does not remove all problems. Mass poverty 
is pushing Afghans into robbery and theft and the seizure of 
pastures and lands. The drugs business has assumed dangerous 
proportions in Afghanistan and is literally breaching the 
border. It is possible to speak purely hypothetically about a 
border service on the Afghan side, but many servicemen there, 
moreover, are light-fingered and live by smuggling. 
  "The Iranian border is a little quieter. A pass regime has 
been introduced there. But all kinds of things happen. A 
subunit under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lopushko 
recently tracked down some smugglers who were using three horses 
to carry a 150 kg consignment of drugs from Afghanistan across 
Turkmenia into Iran. The servicemen pursued them across 
snow-covered mountains for more than 30 km, caught up with them, 
and disarmed them after a fight. 
  "If Russia quits the Turkmen border, a muddy wave of crime 
and terrorism and a wave of drugs will swamp the Commonwealth 
countries. There have been proposals to move the border further 
north, but that is unrealistic. It would cost a colossal amount 
of money to equip."

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Prime Ministers See Danger for </F>
the Baltic States"] 
  [Text] Riga, 19 Jan -- The words uttered on Tuesday [18 
January] by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev regarding 
"serious interests" in the former Soviet republics and partial 
retention of Russian troops in some of those republics have 
received sharp criticism. During their meeting in Jurmala 
today, the Baltic prime ministers made a statement concluding 
that Kozyrev's declaration means that "the very essence of the 
`Partnership for Peace' plan proposed by the United States and 
accepted at the NATO summit in Brussels, as well as the building 
of new structures for European safety, have become questionable." 
  The prime ministers voiced the opinion that this "new 
attitude" toward relations with the Baltic States will 
complicate the negotiations on Russian withdrawal from Latvia 
and Estonia. "Such statements by Russia regarding foreign and 
military policy are aimed directly against the sovereignty of 
the Baltic states," reads the declaration signed by the Baltic 
prime ministers. The statement also includes a demand that 
Russia keep its promise to withdraw its military units from 
Latvia and Estonia by 31 August 1994. 
  As was admitted at a press conference by Maris Riekstins, 
state secretary of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the 
statements on Tuesday by A. Kozyrev might be regarded as his 
characteristic style. M. Riekstins recalled the end of 1992, 
when A. Kozyrev presented a scenario in Stockholm of what would 
happen if nationalist radicals assumed power in Russia. These 
statements were later disavowed. M. Riekstins said that the 
Foreign Ministry is in possession of information about several 
Russian Foreign Ministry officials who, in expressing their own 
opinions, have tried to counteract Kozyrev's statement. M. 
Riekstins assumed that what Kozyrev said was his own view of 
last week's summit of NATO leaders. It "did not solve the 
acceptance of different countries in East Europe into this 
organization." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not in 
possession of the precise text of Kozyrev's speech; officials 
will probably have it on Thursday. 
  Anxiety in connection with A. Kozyrev's speech was also 
expressed by the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry, as reported by 
BNS. "There is an impression that Russia has not resolved to 
give up its military influence in the Baltic states. It is odd 
that this statement has been made after the meeting of the 
presidents of the United States and Russia, and at the same time 
the new Russian parliament is beginning its work," reads a 
statement issued by the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry. A member 
of the Lithuanian Seimas [parliament], Romualds Ozols, expressed 
the view that Lithuania should declare strictly that it does not 
intend to cooperate with Russia in the military field. Anxiety 
over Kozyrev's speech was also expressed by the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry. 
  Already on Tuesday, an assumption was expressed that the 
recent conduct of Russia, which contradicts the previous policy 
towards the Baltic states, might be connected with the latest 
meeting of the Russian and U.S. presidents, as well as the 
possible agreement on this question, therefore an official 
statement from the United States regarding Kozyrev's statement 
was impatiently awaited. Today, the U.S. State Department 
declared: "The statement by Minister Kozyrev contradicts what 
was said at the meeting of the two presidents in Moscow." The 
statement says that during his meeting with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, U.S. President Bill Clinton stressed the 
immediate and complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia 
and Estonia. M. Riekstins said at a press conference that the 
U.S. State Department has requested a formal explanation of A. 
Kozyrev's speech. 
  The head of Latvia's delegation to withdrawal negotiations 
with Russia, Martins Virsis, said at the press conference that 
it is difficult to foretell how this statement might affect the 
talks between Latvia and Russia. "If this radical conceptual 
attitude is maintained, Latvia will apparently be forced to 
think the whole situation over and possibly change its 
position." M. Virsis refused further comment on the subject.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomtic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Relations with China remain "one of the priorities 
of Russia's foreign policy, moreover, one of the permanent 
ones," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told his Chinese 
counterpart Jian Qichen during the Russo-Chinese official 
negotiations in Beijing, according to INTERFAX's special 
correspondent, Igor Porshnev, accompanying Kozyrev on his visit 
to China. 
  The minister said he could only wish that these talks were 
"the beginning of the Russo-Chinese relations' transition on to 
a qualitatively new level of wide-ranging constructive 
partnership." In his opinion, this partnership should extend to 
cover not only bilateral cooperation, but also the two 
countries' approach to solving issues of international 
importance. 
  In the course of the negotiations, the two ministers 
discussed a number of economic issues. Kozyrev pointed out that 
Russia would like to launch some the joint projects, in 
particular, the construction of a hydroelectric power station on 
the river Yangtze. The two sides agreed to use the principle of 
combined commercial activities on disputed sections of the 
border as a temporary measure. 
  The talks also produced an agreement to continue the two 
countries' military and technical cooperation, strictly 
observing both their mutual interests and international 
obligations. 
  The two sides signed a protocol between the Russian and 
Chinese foreign ministries and an intergovernmental agreement on 
the status of checkpoints on the Russo-Chinese border. 
  Speaking in the Chinese Association of People's Diplomacy 
after the end of the talks, the Russian foreign minister pointed 
to "the Asian Pacific region's increasing importance for the 
future of Russia," connected with the greater economic role 
played by the Asian part of Russia. This makes the ties with 
Asian neighbors even more important, as they already account for 
about one third of Russia's trade turnover. 
  Kozyrev believes that the system of international relations 
in the region, as in the whole world, "is gaining a stable 
multipolar character," while the ideology of regional and global 
alliances of some Asian Pacific countries against others "is 
becoming a thing of the past." The future of the region lies 
not in power competition, but rather in cooperation and 
interaction, he pointed out. The minister said the principle of 
stable and balanced relations was the cornerstone of the 
treaties Russia concluded with all countries of the region. He 
added that the danger of large-scale armed conflicts in the 
region had been reduced to a minimum today. 
  The Russian foreign minister described the XXI century as "a 
century of the Pacific region," since the Asian Pacific region's 
economic role would have special importance. Asian countries' 
international positions will be determined, in the first place, 
by the extent of their involvement in the region's economic 
relations. Russia is convinced building up the region's economic 
potential is of no threat to its neighbors, but instead, it 
creates the conditions for a dynamic economic growth, the 
minister pointed out. "Competition in this sphere is a mutually 
profitable competition which all members of the Asian community 
need," he added. 
  After the talks, Kozyrev's political advisor Galina Sidorova 
said Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was likely to 
pay an official visit to China this year. 
  It is supposed that the main goal of the prime minister's 
visit will be preparing a Russo-Chinese summit in Moscow. The 
Chairman of China's State Council, Jiang Zemin, is expected to 
come to Russia on an official visit in the third quarter of this 
year, while Chernomyrdin is likely to visit China this May.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov, Vyacheslav </F>
Tomilin, and Georgiy Shmelev] 
  [Text] Beijing January 28 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev wrapped up the Beijing part of his visit to China 
with meetings with Chinese leaders in Zhongnanhai, where the 
country's central party and government bodies are located. 
  "China values its cooperation and good relations with 
Russia, 
which were reached at a dear price, and desires that the peoples 
of the two countries live in harmony from generation to 
generation", announced Chairman of the Chinese People's Republic 
Jiang Zemin at his meeting with Kozyrev. 
  The Chinese leader mentioned the high value of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's visit to China in December 1992, and 
expressed his satisfaction with the stable development of 
Russian-Chinese relations, saying they were based on mutual 
respect, equality, and mutual benefit. "The maintenance and 
expansion of such relations is one of China's permanent 
policies", Jiang said. 
  Concerning the trade and economic aspect of Russian-Chinese 
relations, Premier of the Chinese State Council Li Peng remarked 
on the great potential for business cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  The volume of trade between Russia and China reached 7.6 
million U.S. dollars in 1993. This, however, is only four per 
cent of China's overall import-export turnover. In connection 
with this, Li called for "joint searches for new ways of 
cooperating", adding that the Russian and Chinese economies are 
in many way mutually complementary. 
  The two sides called for their bilateral relations to be 
raised to a new, qualitatively higher level. Kozyrev said that, 
as far as economics goes, relations of constructive cooperation 
imply a transition to implementing long-range joint projects and 
other "higher and more stable forms of cooperation". 
  The Russian foreign minister gave Jiang Zemin a personal 
letter from Boris Yeltsin with an invitation to pay an official 
visit to Russia. The earlier-communicated invitation to Li Peng 
was confirmed and, in his turn, Li invited head of the Russian 
Government Viktor Chernomyrdin to visit Beijing. Chernomyrdin's 
upcoming visit to China, along with Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen's expected visit to Moscow, will set the stage for 
the second Russian-Chinese summit meeting, scheduled to be held 
in Moscow in the third quarter of this year. 
  Kozyrev held a press conferrence in Zhingnznhai after his 
meetings, at which he emphasized the two sides' efforts to 
develop a cooperative relationship which is of a "strategic, 
long-range nature, not subject to vacillations". 
  Answering journalists' repeated questions about 
Russian-Chinese military cooperation, Kozyrev said he has never 
hidden the help which the two sides have given each other, this 
was at least demonstrated by the presence of Russian Deputy 
Defence Minister General Gromov. "This cooperation is being 
developed within the framework of friendly relations and overall 
partnership", he declared. 
  Later on Friday, Kozyrev, accompanied by Russian regional, 
district and business leaders, arrived in the "special" free 
economic zone of Shenzhen in the south of China. The goal of 
his trip was to become acquainted with this "Chinese laboratory 
of modern managment", the foreign minister said. 
  Thanks to economic reforms and its ability to attract 
foreign 
investments, Shenzhen has turned into one of the country's 
largest industrial centres. This experiment is of interest not 
only for the far eastern regions of Russia, but for the 
north-west as well. At the same time, Kozyrev stressed, "Russia 
is not going to copy the experience of any one country. We are

economic reforms". 
  Tomorrow is the last day of Kozyrev's visit to China, when 
he 
will stop over in the ancient Chinese capital of Xian. 
Afterwards he will return to Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, 31 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- Boris Yeltsin signed a 
decree today "On extending the state of emergency in the 
territory of Mozdokskiy Rayon, Prigorodnyy Rayon, and adjacent 
areas of the Republic of North Ossetia, as well as in 
Malgobekskiy and Nazranovskiy Rayons of the Ingush Republic". 
  The Russian president's press service says the decree was 
signed in view of the fact that tensions persist in some areas 
of the Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush Republic because 
of the unsatisfactory implementation of the Russian president's 
decree of 13 December 1993 "On the procedure for a return to the 
places of permanent residence of refugees and displaced persons 
on the territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and the Ingush 
Republic," in view of the continuing sabotage and exchanges of 
fire, and also with the aim of ensuring state and public 
security -- in accordance with the RSFSR law "On state of 
emergency" and the Russian Federation law "On security."

  [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent has learned that the 
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, acting on an instruction from 
the Supreme Council, examined the issue of the likely 
consequences of signing or not signing the economic union of CIS 
countries. 
  The prepared information, signed by acting Prime Minister 
Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, points out that 80-90 percent of the total 
requirement for oil and gas, 80 percent of raw materials for 
light industry and 70 percent of component parts for the 
machine-building industry come from CIS countries. Ukraine is 
also one of the main suppliers of agricultural products, cast 
iron, steel, etc to markets in the CIS, but the competitiveness 
of a significant part of the exportable goods is low. 
  The document draws the conclusion that at present "the basis 
for economic integration is very weak," and because of this it 
is difficult to foresee an equal coordination of reform 
processes." However, "in the event of Ukraine not joining the 
economic union a possibility exists that discriminatory measures 
on the part of members of the CIS economic union, in the first 
instance of Russia, will be adopted against it:" a tougher 
customs regime; a search for and the creation of alternative 
transportation routes and ports for trade with the West 
(negotiations are already being held on designing a new gas 
pipeline through Belarus and Poland, a new port is being 
designed in St. Petersburg, and the port in Novorossiysk is 
being enlarged); restricting supplies of weapons to Ukraine, a 
search for alternative suppliers for traditional Ukrainian goods 
entering CIS markets; tougher competition with Ukrainian goods 
in markets of third countries, and a refusal to support Ukraine 
in international and financial organizations. There is also a 
"considerable dependency on Russian for storing and processing 
used nuclear fuel." 
  In the opinion of the authors of the document, total losses 
in the event of Ukraine not joining the economic union and 
discriminatory measures being adopted against it are estimated 
at approximately $4.6 billion annually. 
  The document's conclusion is that, "in this situation the 
most reasonable and well-considered approach is Ukraine's 
cooperation with the economic union as an associate member."

  [Text] Simferopol, 31 Jan -- The more than substantial 
number of votes cast for the Russia bloc, which I represent, is 
confirmation that our policies are the correct ones, Yuriy 
Meshkov, who was elected the first president of the Republic of 
Crimea in Sunday's elections, has told journalists in 
Simferopol. These are the policies of revival, unification, 
adherence to normal economic laws, and removal of tension 
between Russia and the Ukraine, he said. These policies are in 
the best interests of our citizens, citizens of the Republic of 
Crimea, including their right to mix freely with Russian 
citizens, the right to dual citizenship and the right to a 
normal life, of which we have been deprived. The results of the 
voting provide hope that change will come. This is a vote of 
confidence for the Russia bloc, a belief that our objectives 
will be realized. 
  As has already been reported, Meshkov guaranteed in his 
election program that the moratorium on a referendum on Crimea's 
status would be lifted. He promised to return the republic to 
the ruble zone, to grant Crimeans the right to dual citizenship, 
and to guarantee peace and national accord in Crimea.

  [Text] Baku, January 29 (TURAN) -- The President of AMOCO 
Caspian Sea Petroleum Company Robert Balton arrived in Baku 
yesterday. 
  Today he will meet with the leadership of Azerbaijan. 
Questions of cooperation in oil exploration, and specifically 
AMOCO's participation in the oil field exploration in the 
Caspian will be discussed during the sessions. 
  More than three years have passed since the Azeri Government 
declared its in?ent to begin exploration of oil fields with 
participation of foreign companies. But political instability 
and the frequent change in political regimes prevented the 
signing of the contracts. 
  A representative of one of the oil companies told TURAN that 
a few weeks ago the members of the oil consortium appealed to 
the Azeri Government for a final answer concerning the contract. 
Also, it became known that the companies have given an 
ultimatum: They will leave Azerbaijan should if they do not 
have a clear answer by that spring. [sentence as received] 
  A few days ago, Tim Hartnet, AMOCO's representative in Baku 
told TURAN that "we are on the eve of signing a contract. We 
think it will be signed in the near future." 
  The so-called "Russian factor" prevents an earlier signing 
of 
the contract. Russia, which has neither technology nor capital 
to offer Azerbaijan, nevertheless wants to participate in the 
distribution of Azeri oil. In November 1993, after the most 
recent successful offensive of t?e Armenian army, President 
Geydar Aliyev invited R?ssian Secretary for Energy Yuriy 
Shafranik to Baku to sign an agreement allowing Russian 
participation in exploration of Azeri oil fields. Baku agreed 
to give 10 percent of Azerbaijan's s?are in the exploration 
project of the Azeri-Chirag oil field to the Russian LUKOIL 
company. 
  This gave Azerbaijan a needed break at the front. But the 
planned December final signing of the contract with LUKOIL did 
not take place. 
  At this time, Aliyev visited Paris where he proposed to 
President Mitterrand that France use its capital in 
reinvigorating the Azerbaijani economy. At present, 
representatives of the French Elf oil company is looking into 
possibilities for participation in the exploration of Azeri oil. 
Meanwhile, AZADLIG newspaper writes, citing the well-informed 
sources, that a massive transportation of arms and ammunition 
from Russia to Armenia is taking place with the intent of 
further transport to Karabakh. Evidently, on the eve of the 
signing the contract with the Western oil consortium, the world 
will soon hear about the next large-scale offensive by the 
Armenian Army into Azerbaijani territory. Practice has already 
proved this more than once.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin is due to arrive in 
Tbilisi for one day of talks with his Georgian counterpart 
Eduard Shevardnadze on February 3, a well-informed source told 
Interfax in Tbilisi. After a private meeting, the two leaders

also meet local intellectuals and get involved in a signing 
ceremony for a package of bilateral agreements with the outline 
friendship and cooperation treaty being the main one. 
  The source said work was in progress to put final touches to 
some 20 draft papers but the two heads of state would sign only 
those which were ready by February 3. 
  In the meantime, spokesman for the Transcaucasian Group of 
Russian Troops Gennadiy Dolgachev told Interfax that the 
President would probably be accompanied by Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev. The two countries are also expected to sign an 
agreement on the status of Russian troops deployed in Georgia 
and other documents on military cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  Up to 5000 policemen will be mobilized to tighten security 
during Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi, an Georgian interior ministry 
spokesman told Interfax. Security forces will also be deployed.

Algirdas Brazauskas said on his return to Vilnius Friday [28 
January]. 
  The president told reporters at the airport that "we were 
received well and had interesting discussions at the NATO 
headquarters." 
  Brazauskas confirmed reports that NATO experts are scheduled 
to come to Vilnius next week, to help work out the program of 
Lithuania's participation in the Partnership for Peace plan. 
Lithuania signed up for NATO's partnership plan Thursday. 
  Commenting on his visit to the Netherlands, the president 
said it was "very necessary" because "very little is known about 
Lithuania" in that country. 
  Brazauskas said the Dutch leadership expressed readiness to 
develop cooperation with Lithuania when they found out about the 
present state of Lithuania's relations with Denmark, Sweden and 
Finland.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Galina Kuchina and Yuriy Sizov] </F>
  [Text] Riga January 28 TASS -- Latvian Prime Minister 
Valdis Birkavs believes that talks with Russia should be 
continued, although his country has already covered its half of 
the road. 
  "The limit of our concessions to Russia has been exhausted, 
but we should continue the talks. There is no other way. The 
two countries cannot be brought together by military methods," 
he said in an ITAR-TASS interview. 
  Responding to the question about the situation of the 
people, 
who have no Latvian citizenship (they account for about one 
third of the population), the prime minister said: "I believe 
the problem is being artificially kindled. People are looking 
for a better place to live, and the fact that there is no 
massive exodus from Latvia is the best proof that no section of 
the population feels as economically handicapped." 
  In his opinion, the citizenship problem will be resolved and 
a corresponding law will be adopted in due time. "Previously we 
paid no attention to citizenship. Now that the problem is being 
discussed continually, that rumours begin to circulate about 
some massive deportations which no one intends to implement, 
people want to have citizenship as a sort of an anchor. If the 
problem is settled on a legal basis, then people will feel that 
they have guarantees for peaceful work," the Latvian prime 
minister said. 
  According to Birkavs, there are three ways to normalise the 
situation. "Very careful naturalisation is the first one. An 
absolutely free repatriation to the ethnic homeland along with 
the financial support of this process is the second one. And 
there is one more way: emigration to third countries, which, of 
course, will not acquire massive proportions," the prime 
minister said. 
  Responding to the question about Latvia's attitude to the 
partnership for peace programme, the prime minister praised it 
and added: "The suggested mechanism of a peaceful settlement of 
conflicts is valuable to us, because the security problem will 
be an acute one for Latvia during the coming two or three 
years." He believes that if Latvia joined the programme earlier, 
it could have counted on NATO support during the recent dramatic 
aggravation of relations with Russia (it is worth recalling in 
this connection that the aggravation was the result of an arrest 
of two Russian generals by Latvian local authorities.) 
  The head of the Latvian Government believes that "the time 
has come to analyse military systems of other countries. We 
were part of the Soviet system long enough and came out from it 
not with the best of recollections. This is why the orientation 
towards the NATO structures is obvious, and it will be 
continued," he said.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told 
Interfax in an exclusive interview that Yegor Gaydar may return 
to the Cabinet for a third time. 
  "Nothing is impossible in our world. A diplomat who says 
that something is impossible, in principle is not a diplomat," 
he said. 
  He believes that the current Russian government is as 
reform-oriented as its predecessor. "The Cabinet has only been 
reorganized, so the current government is old, not new. That is 
why the Cabinet's membership will not be submitted to the State 
Duma for endorsement," said Kozyrev. 
  He noted that some of the departments had been reorganized. 
"New appointments have been made and some of the Cabinet members 
have been given a new status, say, a deputy prime minister has 
become a minister. This does not mean, however, that the 
government is new," he said. 
  Kozyrev emphasized that as before the Russian government 
would promote reforms and that Russia's foreign policy will 
definitely remain unchanged. 
  He told journalists who accompanied him on his way from 
China 
to Moscow that from the beginning he had not considered Gaydar's 
resignation a necessity. 
  "I had serious doubts about this. I told Gaydar right away 
that I respected his personal and political reasons. After all, 
everyone has the right to long-range tactical and strategic 
moves. However, taking into account prospects for the 
democratic movement and the results of the recent parliamentary 
elections, I thought that Gaydar should have stayed in the 
government to defend his views. The democratic potential should 
not have been weakened, particularly after a relative defeat 
during the elections," said Kozyrev. 
  He pointed out that the "practice of resignation" would 
hardly strengthen the democratic movement. Precisely because of 
this, he has spoken out for a mediatory stance. 
  "I consider both my co-thinkers," he said referring to 
Gaydar 
and Chernomyrdin. "Yegor Gaydar's resignation from Yeltsin's 
reformatory team was a shock for me," he said. 
  To quote Kozyrev, disputes do occur in the government and a 
minister may find it difficult to defend his point of view. 
"But after set-backs, one may raise the same question once 
again. This is what I told Gaydar," said Kozyrev. 
  He expressed hope that after Gaydar's resignation, the 
democrats would regroup their forces. 
  "It is the democrats' duty to tell the people what happened 
during the elections and what they are going to do in connection 
with this. The type of reform based exclusively on Boris 
Yeltsin's popularity is no long viable. Reformers, particularly 
the democrats who intend to form up a government, must win a 
mandate of their own during elections," said Kozyrev. 
  He said that the relative defeat during the recent elections 
would lead not only to a chain of dramatic resignations, but 
also to a dramatic self-analysis in the democratic camp.

  [Excerpts] Our correspondent Petr Makritskiy attended the 
first news conference given by Myechyslaw Hryb, the new speaker 
of the Belarus parliament. [passage omitted] Outlining his main 
positions on getting the republic out of crisis, Mechyslav 
Ivanovich focused on the possibility of new elections. 
  [Hryb] We assume -- as I have said before -- that we must 
resolve the issue of how our state system is structured. 
Whether we should we have a strong president, elected by the 
people; or perhaps the Supreme Soviet will decide that we should 
have a parliamentary republic. I absolutely do not rule out the 
likelihood that this issue will be raised in the Supreme Soviet 
in the future. 
  [Makritskiy] The new chairman was asked what his first steps 
would be in his new post. 
  [Hryb] I shall try to look into the activities of our 
Supreme 
Soviet. We are not pulling together at all at the moment, and 
in our present situation it will be very difficult to emerge 
from the critical economic state we are in. We must learn to 
listen to one another, understand one another; we have a lot to 
learn in the way of patience in our work. 
  [Makritskiy] The journalists asked whether there would be 
any 
change in the foreign policy priorities of the Republic of 
Belarus. 
  [Hryb] Our state's foreign policy course will not change. 
Our course has been set: peace, friendship with all states, 
with all peoples, recognition of our existing borders -- we 
recognize those borders which are established today. We are 
Slavs, we are neighbors, we hope to be good neighbors, first and 
foremost to Russia and the Russian people, to treat one another 
with respect. 
  [Makritskiy] Journalists got the following reply to a 
question about the unification of the monetary systems of 
Belarus and Russia: 
  [Hryb] I support the point of view voiced by esteemed 
Stanislav Shushkevich in regard to the unification of currencies 
and exchange rates and fuel prices. This option would suit us 
very well indeed, then we could somehow regulate the prices of 
our goods and sell them on the Russian Federation market.

  [Text] Bishkek, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Voters in Kyrgyzstan 
responded massively Sunday [30 January] to a "vote of 
confidence" referendum to endorse the shock therapy mandate of 
reformist President Askar Akayev. 
  Around 88 per cent of voters in the small central Asian 
state 
had cast their ballot with four hours of polling remaining, a 
member of the central election commission told AFP. 
  Polling stations closed at 8.00 p.m. (1400 GMT) with 
preliminary results Sunday night. 
  Pre-vote opinion polls showed Akayev would win his gamble 
with between 60 percent and 70 percent backing for his reform 
programme. 
  The only head of state among the five former Soviet 
republics 
in central Asia not to have been a communist leader, Akayev 
announced the vote amid a social and economic crisis for his 
radical reform programme launched in July 1992. 
  The reforms, instigated in conjunction with the 
International 
Monetary Fund by a man with a reputation as a good democrat, 
have undermined Akayev's popularity. 
  Average monthly salaries now stand at 135 soms (around 15 
dollars), just 35 soms above the estimated absolute minimum 
necessary for survival. 
  When the reforms were launched, Akayev predicted that the 
economy would stabilise by the end of 1992. But by the end of 
last year annual inflation was still running at around 1,600 
percent, while national income had fallen by 17 percent during 
the year. 
  Observers said that Akayev's decision to call the referendum 
had also been influenced by criticism that his initial election, 
in October 1991 with 95 percent of the vote, lacked legitimacy. 
  Victory would mean the continuation of his bid to drag the 
country's 4.5 million inhabitants out of poverty. 
  It would also strengthen Akayev's hand in his three-way 
battle for political supremacy with the communist-dominated 
parliament and with opposition forces within the legislature 
calling for fresh elections. 
  Topchubek Tursunaliyev, who heads the opposition Free 
Kyrgyzstan party, accused Akayev of calling the plebiscite to 
"avoid the elections of which he is afraid." 
  "The president and parliament were elected under the Soviet 
constitution of 1977 and have no legitimacy since Kyrgyzstan 
adopted its own constitution last May," Tursunaliyev added. 
  Opposition forces including the Free Kyrgyzstan party also 
denounced "corruption and the mafia, which are rife here and are 
in the process of turning Kyrgyzstan into the Sicily of central 
Asia." 
  Akayev himself admitted last week that the country was 
wracked by widespread corruption, which he said had completely 
overrun the Interior Ministry. 
  A Western diplomat here added: "Akayev is a genuine democrat 
but he is not in complete control over what is happening in this 
country."

Karimov, Tulkin Miryakubov has been released from his post of 
deputy prime minister, and Shuhrat Gafurov from his as chairman 
of the State Property Committee. At the same time, Viktor

is already the second major reshuffle in the government over the 
past week, and, according to authoritative sources, will not be 
the last in the near future. Clearly such measures were 
conditioned by the resolve of the president to activate the

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 31, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar, along with government heads of many other states, 
attended Friday through Sunday [28-30 January] the World 
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
  Laar spoke at the forum about Estonian economic reforms. He 
focused on the cost of the reforms for the population of the 
country and stressed that the success of the reforms doesn't 
mean an immediate growth of the population's income. 
  Several participants in the discussion following Laar's 
address expressed the hope that Estonia, unlike several other 
countries, will not abandon the course of quick changes, and 
gave their support to Laar's wish for "less foreign aid and more 
open markets." In the opinion of participants, this allows to 
speed up the pace of reforms and reduce a feeling of political 
disappointment. 
  Elimination of barriers in world trade and promotion of a 
free economy became the principal topics of the World Economic 
Forum, the government's press service informs. 
  Much attention was given also to the situation in Russia and 
to the economic and political integration into the European 
Union of Central and East European countries. 
  Laar's article in Thursday's issue of the INTERNATIONAL 
HERALD TRIBUNE, in which he urged to continue shock therapy in 
Russia and not support the softening of reforms there, drew a 
great deal of attention at the forum. 
  Several speakers, like economists Jeffrey Sachs and Anders 
Aslund, and former Russian Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov, 
expressed opinions similar to those in Laar's article. All 
three left their jobs in Moscow in protest against the change in 
the Russian Government's policies. 
  Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt stated that hyperinflation 
in Russia poses a threat to entire Europe. He arrived at the 
conclusion that plans of action have to be worked out in case 
the situation in Russia becomes critical. 
  Richard Erb, deputy chairman of the International Monetary 
Fund, voiced his opinion that Estonia is in the forefront among 
Central and East European countries in transition from a command 
economy to a free market. He cited Ukraine as an example to the 
contrary. 
  The CNN television company recorded a 30-minute program with 
Laar that will be shown next week. It gave the Estonian premier 
an opportunity to elaborate and comment on his views.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 29, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar met today in Davos with his Czech counterpart, Vaclav 
Klaus, the government's press service told BNS. 
  Laar and Klaus discussed fostering economic cooperation 
between the two countries. They decided a memorandum on a 
free-trade agreement needs to be drawn up, and preparations for 
signing an agreement before the end of the year must be started. 
  The two premiers noted that both Estonia and the Czech 
Republic have chosen a course of radical reforms which, however, 
seems to be the only resultful policy. Due to the similarity of 
the two countries' economic policies, their positions coincide 
almost fully even without prior coordination. 
  The meeting also touched on security issues, particularly 
security guarantees for Central and East European countries. 
  Laar and Klaus agreed that the Czech Government head will 
visit Estonia this spring. The visit will probably take place 
in May.

  [Text] Presidents Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, Niyazov of

disarmament, and [words indistinct]. When we speak about 
Russia's policy toward the so-called near abroad, we have to

republics became independent states. These politicians would 
like to continue to rule on all the former USSR territories. 
But Russia cannot do it now because it is experiencing great 
difficulties itself. [Words indistinct] all current problems can 
be settled by way of talks, by political methods -- of which 
there are not many, in principle. Both Central Asia and the 
West should be interested in strengthening democracy in Russia

Russia has its strategic and political interests in Central 
Asia, and we respect them, but we also have our strategic 
interests in Russia. We seek good neighborly relations with 
Russia.

President Saparmurad Niyazov of Turkmenistan has left for the 
United States. A source close to the republic's government has 
told Interfax that the president must undergo an annual medical 
examination. 
  The source said that on March 24, 1993, during his 
unofficial 
visit to the United States, Niyazov had been examined at 
Washington's Walter Reed Medical Center. On October 6 of the 
same year, the Turkmen press carried a letter by former U.S. 
secretary of State Alexander Haig, in which he recommended that 
Turkmenistan's president visit St. Luke's hospital in Houston, 
where the world's best cardiologists work. 
  Unverified reports say that Houston is one of the cities to 
be visited by Niyazov in the United States.

<F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>
  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 31 (AFP) -- Moscow plans to 
limit the presence of foreign commercial banks in Russia to 
encourage the activity of local institutions, central bank 
chairman Victor Gerashchenko said here Monday [31 January]. 
  Gerashchenko said at the World Economic Forum here that 
foreign banks represent 12 percent of the one trillion rubles 
(646 million dollars) in capital held by the Russian banking 
community. 
  "We think that for a certain period of time, we will keep 
this limitation," he told AFP. "We need to promote our 
commercial banks." 
  Moscow has already moved to curb the activities of foreign 
commercial banks operating under license in Russia, with only 
three of the 12 allowed to handle transactions with Russian 
residents. 
  Gerashchenko also said that $20 billion placed by Russian 
banks abroad was not being properly used. He said of the 
country's 2,090 commercial banks, only 100 or so were serious 
institutions. 
  Boris Nemtsov, governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, which 
is a showcase for Russian reforms, criticised the fact that the 
20 billion dollars was being placed overseas at all. "Our first 
job it to direct Russian money to our economy," he said. 
  Gerashchenko said Russia was also looking at tax breaks and 
other special arrangements to attract selected foreign firms to 
invest in Russia. "We need companies with some type of 
pioneering experience," he said. 
  The central bank chief echoed the determination of Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin not to rely exclusively on monetary 
policy to fight rampant inflation in Russia. 
  He said the monetary component of Russia's inflation was 
"insignificant" and most of it was due to the state firms 
factoring all their costs into their prices while not using all 
their capacity. 
  The key, Gerashchenko said, was to selectively encourage 
production. "If we don't have a government-supported investment 
policy we will be unable through monetarist means to fight 
inflation." 
  Gerashchenko said that government expenditures for 1993 
totaled 33.2 trillion rubles ($21 billion) and income was about 
24 trillion ($15.5 billion). 
  He said out of the 24 trillion rubles in income, 17 trillion 
was normal tax revenues and 6.8 trillion was from sales of 
assets to the central bank. 
  Gerashchenko swore here that he was committed to free-market 
reforms in Russia, but came under renewed attack by critics who 
accused him of incompetence. 
  Jeffrey Sachs, former advisor to President Boris Yeltsin, 
said that for the last two years, Gerashchenko and other 
conservatives undermined economic reform in Russia by 
"demonstrating devastating disdain" for sound money management. 
  "Gerashchenko is showing no understanding that money is not 
a 
political toy," said Sachs.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Kolesnichenko] </F>
  [Text] New York February 1 TASS -- "Russia will continue 
democratic reforms. Far from abandoning the chosen course, we 
shall seek to step up the pace of reforms," Russian Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said in an interview with the CNN TV company 
in Davos (Switzerland) on Monday [31 January]. 
  The Russian premier attends the World Economic Forum there. 
He said that Russia is now facing "difficult problems in the 
economy". "We know these problems and know what we should do to 
tackle them," Chernomyrdin stressed. 
  "The main thing now is to focus on these problems and to 
remove them professionally," he added. 
  "No matter what rumours are now spread in and outside Russia 
about the policy pursued by the government, I'd like to say that 
we shall not go astray from the course of reforms," Chernomyrdin 
stressed. "The advance towards democracy and market relations in 
our country is irreversible." 
  Speaking of the recent resignation by Vice-Premier Yegor 
Gaydar and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, Chernomyrdin noted 
that "the departure of some members from the cabinet will not 
affect the strategic line pursued by the Russian leadership". 
  "Chernomyrdin was and remains the cabinet head," he said. 
"There are no grounds for panic now. I'm developing an 
impression that some politicians alleging a departure from 
economic reforms, would like this to happen in real fact. 
  "They evidently want the government to change its course to 
turn the clock back. I'd like to say that this will not happen. 
The appearance of new people in the cabinet will not lead to 
abandoning the plotted course. 
  "We are heavily panned now for committed mistakes. We chose 
the democratic way of development and are now following it. 
This is the main thing. Sure, it is difficult for us, and we 
make mistakes. We are pursuing a new policy in a new country." 
  Chernomyrdin said during the interview that he fully trusts 
Central Bank Governor Viktor Gerashchenko. "Gerashchenko is a 
career banker with good reputation, name and style of work," the 
cabinet head noted. "I cannot say that he does not support the 
policy of the leadership and interferes with reforms. 
Gerashchenko knows well the country's problems and what to do 
to resolve them. 
  "I have no doubts about his high qualifications and know 
that 
he supports reforms. If Gerashchenko starts to interfere with 
our work, I'll be the first to insist on his resignation. I 
believe that this will not be the case." 
  "The Central Bank is now doing precisely what the government 
and the president recommend it to do," the premier continued. 
"If new bills are being printed, the decision is taken by the 
government and not by the bank. 
  "In this connection, I'd like to note that all the decisions 
on monetary and finance matters taken by the government in 1993 
were agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The task 
facing us in 1994 is as follows: to maintain the level of 
inflation in the country at the level of under 20 per cent per 
month. 
  "Russia has huge debts to pay to major industrial 
enterprises. However, we do not plan to pay them fully. We are 
unable to do this now. Many in Russia want the Chernomyrdin 
government to print more banknotes and issue credits. We shall 
not do this under any circumstances." 
  "All of us should now do our utmost to start working in good 
earnest and produce goods in Russia," stated the cabinet head. 
"We can start the process of economic renovation only in this 
way. We are now facing spectacular tasks, the implementation of 
which will naturally provoke a negative response from some 
segments of population. 
  "It is important for us at this critical moment to prevent 
the rise of nationalist leaders of the Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
type. We have no right to permit this happen."

<F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Finance Minister Boris </F>
Fedorov by Daniel Vigneron in Davos; date not given: "Fedorov: 
`Russia Could Have Met IMF Requirements'"] 
  [Text] Boris Fedorov resigns as finance minister, explains 
why he was not able to achieve his economic stabilization goals, 
and believes the government will make promises and then break 
them. 
  [Vigneron] Former Western advisers to the Russian Government 
-- including Jeffrey Sachs -- have had very harsh words for the 
conditions the IMF has forced upon Russia. Do you agree with 
them? 
  [Fedorov] Their criticisms are excessive. True, the IMF's 
approach was not always appropriate and its procedures lack 
flexibility. However, the principle of enforcing conditions 
must not be compromised: One must never give Russia money 
without demanding guarantees with respect to economic 
stabilization. In 1993, it was possible to meet the Fund's 
requirements (budget deficit down to 5 percent of GDP and 
inflation down to 5 percent monthly by year's end). These goals 
were the reason behind everything I did as finance minister. 
  Unfortunately, 60 percent of my program could not be 
implemented due to the government's lack of financial 
discipline. Let me give you one single example: I proposed 
last year to cancel some 50 decisions approving expenditures for 
which no funding had been found. To no avail. In Russia, the 
government decides on an expenditure first, and then it looks 
for ways to fund it. How do you conduct a stabilization policy 
in such conditions? 
  [Vigneron] How were your relations with Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin? 
  [Fedorov] In the West, people find it hard to understand 
that a finance minister could disagree with the head of 
government as to which policy is appropriate. We had frequent 
rows. But frankly, I do not think Viktor Chernomyrdin is very 
conversant with economic mechanisms. However, he is a born 
politician. This is why he gave me his support every time I was 
able to convince him that he would benefit politically from a 
particular economic decision. Mark my word: To secure 
financial assistance from the West, Viktor Chernomyrdin will 
make all the promises asked of him with respect to budgetary and 
monetary rigor. Then, of course, he will break them. 
  [Vigneron] What do you think the West can do now to support 
the reform process in Russia? 
  [Fedorov] Western assistance must be channeled in two 
directions. On the one hand, it must contribute to funding 
private projects, as this creates jobs and stimulates related 
activities. On the other hand, technical assistance to training 
must be emphasized. Giving 10,000 people the training they need 
in the new economic context is far more effective than having 
10,000 Western experts churn out studies or reports.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 28, BNS -- At a session of the 
non-member states committee of the Council of Europe [CE] 
Parliamentary Assembly Thursday [27 January], Russian 
representative Yevgeni Ambartsumov claimed that the demand for 
the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia is 
unfair, the Estonian parliament's press service reports. 
  Ambartsumov, to support his claim, referred to the continued 
presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus. 
  The session discussed the conditions for Russia's joining 
the 
Council of Europe. 
  Swedish representative Daniel Tarschys resolutely stated no 
concessions will be made to Russia, the parliament's press 
service informs. 
  Mati Hint, a member of the Estonian delegation, and Latvia's 
Andrejs Pantelejevs emphasized that their countries cannot agree 
to Russian senior officials' attempts to tie troop withdrawal to 
various conditions or call it in question. 
  The CE Parliamentary Assembly session Thursday morning 
discussed the situation of the displaced Kurdish population of 
Iraq and heard an address by Luxembourg Prime Minister Jacques 
Santer. 
  The afternoon session focused on European transportation 
problems, environment, and agriculture.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry Press Center has 
revealed that the fourth ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] 
Ministerial Council meeting in Tehran has ended. A delegation 
headed by Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov represented Azerbaijan 
at the meeting, which was also attended by the foreign ministers 
of Afghanistan, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, 
Turkmenistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The ECO secretary 
general, leading officials of several UN committees and 
organizations, the president of the Islamic Development Bank, 
and WHO representatives were invited to attend as guests. 
  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani delivered the opening speech, 
stressing the need to improve cooperation in the region and 
expressing concern over the continuing dispute between 
Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
  Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, Foreign Minister 
Sardar 
Asif Ali, and Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin also spoke. They 
strongly condemned Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan and 
called for the withdrawal of the occupying forces as soon as 
possible. 
  Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov addressed the meeting on 
behalf of the Azerbaijani delegation. He briefed delegates on 
developments in Azerbaijan since the last ECO Ministerial 
Council meeting and the time when Azerbaijan became an ECO 
member. Pointing to Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan, 
Gasanov urged the ECO members to support Azerbaijan's people, 
take concrete steps, and adopt economic and political sanctions 
against the aggressor. 
  Regarding issues relating to economic cooperation, Gasanov 
noted the importance of improving cooperation in transport and 
communication in the region. 
  Gasanov's concrete proposals were included in the ECO's 
program of work for 1994. 
  The meeting approved the ECO plan for 1994. It calls for 
holding the next meetings of the ECO Red Crescent Organizations 
and the ECO committees on power generation, transport, and 
communication in Baku. Gasanov held bilateral talks with the 
foreign ministers of the ECO members and leading officials of 
international organizations. Gasanov conveyed President Geydar 
Aliyev's letters to the presidents of the republics in Central 
Asia when he met his counterparts from Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, 
Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Gasanov invited Foreign 
Ministers [name indistinct], Suleymenov, and (?Asymov) to stop 
over in Baku after leaving Tehran. They held talks with 
President Aliyev on the phone in Baku. Aliyev said he believed 
that the republics in Central Asia would support the justified 
struggle waged by Azerbaijan's people to restore their country's 
sovereignty and territorial integrity and ward off Armenia's 
aggression. He also stressed the need to strengthen mutual 
cooperation between Azerbaijan and the republics of Central Asia 
and wished peace and security for these countries' peoples.

  [Text] As a RIA correspondent was told at the CIS 
headquarters, the meeting of CIS ministers of internal affairs 
which was due to tackle questions of creating a single 
coordinating body to combat organized crime has been put off 
from 1 to 16 February and it will take place not in Minsk, but 
in Ashgabat. One of the reasons for the transfer is the absence 
of a minister of internal affairs of the Republic of Belarus, 
who was removed from his post by decision of the Supreme Soviet 
on 25 January because of the Lithuanian incident.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>
  [Excerpts] Moscow, 31 Jan--The Russian and Kazakh experts 
who opened a meeting in Moscow today will agree on the texts of 
draft agreements on the status and conditions of exploitation of 
the Baykonur cosmodrome and the town of Leninsk and draft 
treaties on leasing facilities at Baykonur cosmodrome and the 
town of Leninsk. [passage omitted] 
  The Russian side believes that Baykonur will not be able to 
exist in the foreseeable future without the Russian Federation 
space forces that currently ensure virtually all of the 
functioning of the cosmodrome. Kazakhstan, however, is coming 
out in support of withdrawing the military from its territory. 
Russia, therefore, proposed to its partner to consider a 
compromise solution--that is, a lease. Kazakhstan supported 
this option in general. 
  The current meeting is a step toward implementing the 
compromise. The experts are to determine the time limits of the 
lease, payments under it, and whether Leninsk should be included 
in the leased territory. 
  After completing the talks, the experts will go back to 
finalize the documents so that the agreement and the treaty are 
ready for signing when Russian Federation President Boris 
Yeltsin visits Kazakhstan in late February.

  [Text] The first day of Russian-Kazakh talks on the future 
of the Baykonur space vehicle launching complex was constructive 
and revealed no serious disagreements, said one of the 
negotiators, an official from the Russian Space Agency. 
  He told Interfax that, on Monday, the negotiators discussed 
a 
draft for an agreement between Russia and Kazakhstan on the 
status and use of Baykonur and the town of Leninsk. Lease 
conditions and whether Russian or Kazakh legislation is to apply 
to the leased facilities would be discussed within the next two 
days, the official said. 
  He said the negotiators were only dealing with documents 
drawn up by Russian experts. The Kazakh side "has not yet 
stated its official position on the documents that have been 
proposed" and would be consulting Almaty on Tuesday morning, he 
said.

  [Text] Admiral Eduard Baltin, Black Sea Fleet Commander, 
thinks he succeeded in "maintaining the fleet as a combat unit, 
an outpost on the southern CIS borders." He said so in an 
exclusive interview with Interfax on the first anniversary of 
his appointment. 
  In his words, the fleet was very much alive and proved its 
worth in exercises. 
  Baltin, like all his men, wants the uncertainty about the 
fleet's future to end and the two heads of state to arrive at 
mutually acceptable decisions. 
  The admiral emphasized that he opposed involvement of the 
fleet in politics and participation of servicemen in partisan 
activities of any kind, pro-Ukrainian, pro-Russian, communist or 
democratic. In his view, participation of armed men in political 
games may lead to unpredictable consequences. Baltin believes 
that the politicians must provide concrete aid rather than empty 
promises if they want to show that they care for the fleet. 
  He said that the fleet faced problems of logistic, moral, 
and 
human relations natures. As Ukraine and Crimea are short of 
fuel, energy, food and cash, the fleet is blamed for all the 
troubles, he argued. He recalled that the Sevastopol 
authorities demand that the fleet help them with fuel, money and 
energy while the land tax alone that the fleet had to pay 
amounted to nearly 13 Bn karbovantsy in 1993. The fleet 
received from Russia 77 percent of the total amount of credits 
and from Ukraine, as little as 23 percent. 
  Admiral Baltin said, "In our relations with the Ukrainian 
Navy command we have to recognize the fact that they represent a 
foreign navy and so our relations are business-like." He 
admitted that "we are tied by numerous links" but emphasized 
that "we cannot afford the upkeep of the units and ships of the 
Ukrainian Navy." 
  On the other hand, Baltin said that he was "prepared to have 
a closer cooperation with the Ukrainian Navy and its commander."

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on 
the election of Yuriy Meshkov as the president of the republic 
of the Crimea. "Meshkov has two modes of action before him: 
either really to begin to fulfil his election campaign promises, 
which may lead to a considerable complication of the situation 
on the peninsula and around it or come to see that talks almost 
on a par with presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, 
provided a certain status quo is observed, are much more 
preferable than the role of the leader of an embattled enclave". 
At the same time the newspaper's correspondent points out that 
much in the Crimean president's position depends on Moscow. "If 
Russia makes it clear to the Crimean president that his speedy 
drift to Russian borders will hardly be viewed positively and if 
it becomes clear to the Crimea that its economic position will 
worsen rather than improve in the event of a conflict with 
Ukraine, the new Crimean leader, whther he likes it or not, will 
have to be cautious both in his actions and statements. "If the 
Russian Federation leaders view the Crimean president as their 
best ally in putting pressure on Ukraine and regard any Crimean 
decisions as a guide for their own action, then one may have no 
doubt that, following an aggravation of Russo-Ukrainian 
relations, many Russian republics would develop a natural desire 
to follow the Crimean example and make use of the advantageous 
precedent in the interests of their own sovereignty". 
IZVESTIYA on the same subject: "The election of Meshkov as 
the president of the Crimea creates a fundamentally new 
situation in Russo-Ukrainian relations". "Until now, calls for 
the Crimea's secession from Ukraine and accession to Russia were 
issued only during demonstrations and rallies by opposition 
parties, which saved Moscow the trouble of officially reacting 
to them. The picture has changed after January 30: a person who 
does not conceal his pro-Russian sympathies and who is firmly 
intent on holding a referendum on the Crimea's status soon came 
to power in the Crimea. "Kiev resolutely opposes the idea: It 
is not difficult to visualise the outcome of the polling. If 
the new Crimean leader shows persistence, insisting on a 
referendum, the situation on the peninsula may get sharply 
aggravated, threatening to bring about serious complications in 
Russo-Ukrainian relations as well". 
TRUD on the election of Crimean president: Kiev, while 
stating that it has nothing against the election of a president 
in the Crimea, "at the same time hurried to adopt such 
amendments to the Ukrainian Constitution, which enable the 
president of the republic to call the Crimea to `order' if the 
two republics' positions diverge". 
PRAVDA quotes Meshkov as saying in an interview that "peace 
and national accord are the most important thing for people in 
the Crimea." "There will always be room for both Ukrainians, 
Tatars and Russians in the Crimea -- for all those who are 
prepared to work honestly here," Meshkov said. 
SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA believes that following the election of 
Yuriy Meshkov as the president "the Crimea has chosen its 
destiny" by quite definitely declaring its will for the 
establishment of closer contacts with Russia. 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on prospects for the development of reforms 
in the Russian Federation and an economic policy which the 
country's reorganised government will pursue. The newspaper 
believes that the new government "will have to look for some 
different approaches" to the solution of economic issues. "This 
is quite an urgent necessity but one gathers the impression that 
the premier and his closet entourage fear 'anti-market' labels 
so much that they do not reveal their plans so far," points out 
the author of an analytical article on the subject. At the same 
time he expresses an opinion that an adjustment to the policy 
implies "enhancement of state economic regulation and limitation 
on the freedom of operation of market mechanisms". Academician 
Andrey Zhukov, member of the presidential council, is of the 
opinion that there is no rollback in the reform process. At the 
same time, he points out that "the tendencies that manifest 
themselves now took shape long ago". "They were laid down by the 
old government and in no way created a good climate for 
entrepreneurial activities in Russia". 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the military service under 
contract. According to the newspaper, more than 120,000 people 
now serve under contract in Russia, which has helped to raise 
the manning status of the Army and Navy by 10 per cent. 
According to a recent presidential decree, there will be 
another 150,000 professionals in the Army soon. 
IZVESTIYA carries an interview with former Belarusian 
parliament chief Stanislav Shushkevich. He remarked in 
particular that "through the efforts of the Belarusian 
Government, not a single market mechanism works in the republic 
now".

  "It is rather difficult for me to comment on that

official information on this issue," the minister said.

<F P=106> [Andrey Kabannikov report: "No Need To Blame the Duma.... </F>
What A. Kozyrev Will Bring Back From China"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- Andrey Kozyrev's three-day visit to 
China, which ends today, cannot be called too strenuous. Our 
foreign minister's talks with Qian Qichen, his Chinese 
colleague, took up only approximately 90 minutes. Then came a 
brief lecture for Chinese political experts, two very brief 
meetings with PRC State Council Premier Li Peng and PRC 
President Jiang Zemin, and the traditional news conference for 
journalists. 
  The chief result of the visit evidently should not be 
regarded at all as the agreements signed here on crossing points 
in the border region or the protocol on consultations between 
the two countries' foreign policy departments but Kozyrev's very 
appearance in Beijing, which interrupted the succession of 
cancellations and postponements and confirmed Russia's desire 
and ability to tackle in earnest the building of relations with 
a great neighbor. Kozyrev assured Beijing that "the president's 
foreign policy" will not undergo any changes in connection with 
the government reshuffles and urged it to "judge by results, not 
by persons." Rejecting accusations of neo-imperialism, our 
minister declared: "If anybody thinks that he will be unable to 
reach agreement with me and will find someone else with whom it 
will be easier to reach agreement, I am afraid that they are 
badly informed, for example, about the makeup of the present 
State Duma. I invite them to familiarize themselves." 
  The visit to Moscow of Jiang Zemin, president of the PRC and 
general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, promises to be 
the next important step in the Russian-Chinese dialogue. After 
failing to happen last year, this trip is now planned for the 
third quarter of this year.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Skosyrev and Konstantin Eggert: </F>
"Foreign Ministers of Russia and China Establish Order on the 
Border and Drive Out the Flies"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- Russia wants to raise relations with 
China to the level of strategic partnership. That was announced 
by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at a press conference 
in Beijing. 
  Western journalists inquired about the military side of the 
Russo-Chinese partnership, and even accused Kozyrev of hiding 
the figures about deliveries of Russian armaments to China and 
of not abiding by the principle of glasnost. The minister 
assured journalists that glasnost is alive and well at the 
Russian Foreign Ministry. Nevertheless, he did not cite any 
specific facts in the sphere of military-technical cooperation. 
  The PRC leaders are in no hurry to take up the formula of 
strategic partnership. The head of China's foreign policy 
department prefers to speak in more cautious terms. 
  The Russian minister spoke about the agreement on border 
crossing points and cited his conversation with PRC President 
Jiang Zemin, who said: "When a door opens, people may enter but 
flies may enter, too. We must ensure that there are fewer 
flies." By flies the leader of the PRC evidently means any kind 
of criminal element. The agreement signed recently in Beijing 
will help to establish order at border crossing points, in the 
words of Andrey Kozyrev. 
  The question of the demarcation of the Russo-Chinese border 
was raised at the press conference. This matter is proceeding 
successfully but nevertheless there are several islands in 
rivers along the border to which both sides lay claim. The fate 
of these territories has not been decided yet. However, the two 
countries' foreign ministers have agreed that this dispute must 
not harm economic activity on the islands. This means 
specifically that those Russians who are tilling the soil and 
gathering hay on the disputed territories may continue with 
their activities.

  [Text] The visit by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
to the PRC reflected a most important priority of Russian 
foreign policy. We believe that good-neighborliness with the 
PRC is strategically important, the minister declared. Defining 
the principal criteria of Russia's foreign policy in the 
Asia-Pacific area, Andrey Kozyrev said: 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] First, the importance of this 
region to Russia's future is increasing, above all because the 
economic role of the Asian part of our own country is growing. 
  Second, the system of international relations in the 
Asia-Pacific region -- and, indeed, throughout the world -- is 
neither monopolar nor bipolar but is becoming increasingly 
multipolar. I think that echoes of great power pretensions, 
including the idea that there should be one sole superpower, and 
the ideology of regional or global alliances of some countries 
in the Asia-Pacific region against others are receding into the 
past. The future of the region, and the world as a whole, lies 
not in power rivalry but in cooperation and interaction, above 
all among the great powers. The danger that a region of major 
military conflicts could emerge is now at its lowest level. The 
significance of the military factor has been markedly reduced. 
  At the same time, there is considerable potential here for 
tension. Not only is there the legacy of the cold war but there 
is tension created by new problems -- the question of access to 
the resources of the seas and the Pacific Ocean, including the 
seabed, and a number of border disputes. Religious and ethnic 
extremism is dramatically acute in Afghanistan. It also poses a 
threat to Tajikistan. Unless we tackle these problems jointly, 
the outcome could be explosive for a region which includes both 
Russia and China, a region which is, of course, of vital 
interest to us. 
  In these circumstances the key issue is the threat of the 
spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology. I am sure 
that it is not in the security interests of any part of the 
region, including Russia, China, and India, for such a 
development of events to happen. 
  Fourth, the 21st century will clearly be a century of rapid 
economic development in the Pacific. Developing economic might 
will not threaten neighbors but on the contrary will create 
favorable conditions for economic growth throughout the region. 
In other words competition in this sphere is mutually 
advantageous competition. We welcome China's participation in 
the recent Seattle meeting of Asia-Pacific states as an 
important event. For our part we count on friendly China's 
support in getting Russia included in the region's economic 
unification. 
  Fifth, in Asia, as in other regions, economic progress helps 
to safeguard the principal human rights and freedoms. We favor 
the formation of a security community in the Asia-Pacific 
region, which anyone who wants will be able to join. In this 
respect we should, of course, bear in mind Europe's experience, 
but at the same time go our own, Asian way. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The proposal to base bilateral relations on 
constructive partnership was made for the first time during the 
visit to the PRC by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey 
Kozyrev. Revealing this idea, Andrey Kozyrev said: 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] What could this new concept mean? 
Above all, the further strengthening of mutual trust and 
security. Guided by the policy of good-neighborliness with the 
PRC, Russia still fully adheres to the principles of the 
declaration on the principles of relations signed last year at 
summit level. This includes the whole range of the two parties' 
obligations to comply with the principle of not using force 
against each other or in international relations in any form, 
including not being the first to use nuclear weapons. 
  We are also in favor of further progress at the first 
Russian- Chinese talks in Asia on military detente and 
confidence-building measures in the border region. As permanent 
members of the Security Council, Russia and China advocate 
resolving the problems of nuclear weapons on the Korean 
peninsula on the basis of International Atomic Energy Agency 
guarantees. On the whole, with regard to our cooperation on the 
Security Council, I would like to emphasize that we are 
satisfied with the existing level of interaction. 
  The enhancement of trade and economic cooperation is an 
important aspect of our partnership. We are ready to 
participate in major economic development projects being 
implemented by China, such as the construction of the Three 
Gorges hydroelectric power station complex. Russia is very 
interested in the modernization -- or participation in the 
modernization -- of Chinese industrial enterprises formerly set 
up with the help of the Soviet Union. Cooperation in border 
regions is one of the quickest and most effective ways to 
develop economic ties with - it goes without saying - a 
coordinating role for the governments of both sides. [end

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told 
INTERFAX in an exclusive interview that Yegor Gaydar may return 
to the Cabinet for a third time. 
  "Nothing is impossible in our world. A diplomat who says 
that something is impossible, in principle is not a diplomat," 
he said. 
  He believes that the current Russian Government is as 
reform- 
oriented as its predecessor. "The Cabinet has only been 
reorganized, so the current government is old, not new. That is 
why the Cabinet's membership will not be submitted to the State 
Duma for endorsement," said Kozyrev. 
  He noted that some of the departments had been reorganized. 
"New appointments have been made and some of the Cabinet members 
have been given a new status, say, a deputy prime minister has 
become a minister. This does not mean, however, that the 
government is new," he said. 
  Kozyrev emphasized that as before the Russian government 
would promote reforms and that Russia's foreign policy will 
definitely remain unchanged. 
  He told journalists who accompanied him on his way from 
China 
to Moscow that from the beginning he had not considered Gaydar's 
resignation a necessity. 
  "I had serious doubts about this. I told Gaydar right away 
that I respected his personal and political reasons. After all, 
everyone has the right to long-range tactical and strategic 
moves. However, taking into account prospects for the 
democratic movement and the results of the recent parliamentary 
elections, I thought that Gaydar should have stayed in the 
government to defend his views. The democratic potential should 
not have been weakened, particularly after a relative defeat 
during the elections," said Kozyrev. 
  He pointed out that the "practice of resignation" would 
hardly strengthen the democratic movement. Precisely because of 
this, he has spoken out for a mediatory stance. 
  "I consider both my co-thinkers," he said referring to 
Gaydar 
and Chernomyrdin. "Yegor Gaydar's resignation from Yeltsin's 
reformatory team was a shock for me," he said. 
  To quote Kozyrev, disputes do occur in the government and a 
minister may find it difficult to defend his point of view. "But 
after set-backs, one may raise the same question once again. 
This is what I told Gaydar," said Kozyrev. 
  He expressed hope that after Gaydar's resignation, the 
democrats would regroup their forces. 
  "It is the democrats' duty to tell the people what happened 
during the elections and what they are going to do in connection 
with this. The type of reform based exclusively on Boris 
Yeltsin's popularity is no long viable [as received]. 
Reformers, particularly the democrats who intend to form up a 
government, must win a mandate of their own during elections," 
said Kozyrev. 
  He said that the relative defeat during the recent elections 
would lead not only to a chain of dramatic resignations, but 
also to a dramatic self-analysis in the democratic camp. 
  With reference to Russia's relations with China, Kozyrev 
noted that they are not directed against third countries, 
particularly those in the West, and that they are developing 
"without looking back on anyone." 
  The head of Russian diplomacy said that the idea of 
"strategic partnership" suggested by Russia may be materialized 
during a visit to Moscow to be paid by Chairman Jiang Zemin this 
year. 
  He also said he is confident that Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
visit 
to China planned for the first half of this year will contribute 
to the development of bilateral economic cooperation. "Everyone 
is tired of the petty cross-border trade. We should pass to a 
new stage of our cooperation," he said. 
  With reference to the possibility of using China's 
experience 
in conducting economic reforms, Kozyrev noted that Russia "must 
not copy blindly" either the Western or the Chinese experience. 
"We should search for such economic solutions that would be 
acceptable to each of our areas individually," he said. 
  When asked whether the human rights issue was discussed in 
Beijing, Kozyrev said, "Yes. This topic is not closed for us, 
even though we have no intention of exaggerating it," he said. 
  The foreign minister confirmed that he views China as 
Russia's "closest" neighbor. He stands for returning to "common 
sense," he explained. "The term 'close neighbor' only means that 
the country in question adjoins Russia, and that Russia wants to 
develop with it equitable relations based on neighborliness. In 
this sense China or, for instance, Finland are 'close neighbors' 
for Russia," Kozyrev said.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Eggert report: "Moscow Offers Friendship, </F>
Beijing Replies With Polite Smile"] 
  [Text] Blagoveshchensk-Beijing-Shenzhen-Xi'an-Moscow -- 
"How do you interpret the concept of `constructive partnership 
with the PRC'?" Journalists did not tire of asking Andrey 
Kozyrev that question throughout the foreign minister's China 
trip. After all, as far as the masses are aware, the formerly 
hostile communist giants remain divided along ideological lines 
-- democrats are in power in Moscow, while Communists rule in 
Beijing. 
  This is not important in practical politics -- unadorned 
pragmatism and a painstaking desire to avoid any potential 
conflicts currently define relations between the two capitals. 
Nonetheless, it is not yet entirely clear whether the call from 
the Russian diplomatic chief to "move from a full normalization 
of relations to constructive partnership" will meet with the 
response from Chinese leaders that the Kremlin is hoping for. 
  Addressing members of the PRC People's Diplomacy Association 
in Beijing, Kozyrev explained that constructive partnership 
includes the strengthening of mutual trust, cooperation on the 
UN Security Council, and a qualitative improvement in trade and 
economic cooperation, not least in border areas. 
  But you get the impression that the PRC leadership is in 
practice in no hurry to pick up on the ideas brought here by 
Kozyrev. It is not simply a question of the traditionally 
unhurried style of Chinese diplomacy, but also of the PRC 
political elite's lack of confidence about how events in Russia 
will develop. For China stability is the key concept of state 
life. It was in the hope of stability that Beijing rushed to 
show its favor for the State Committee for the State of 
Emergency, and was shocked by the collapse of the USSR which 
followed August 1991. Since then Chinese leaders have forsworn 
support for any specific political forces in Russia, cutting 
themselves off from what is happening in our country with a 
reliable shield of "noninterference in other countries' internal 
affairs." 
  Interest in events in our country has now increased. Chinese 
diplomats have been persistently asking the delegation members 
and accompanying journalists about the changes in the Russian 
Government and Chernomyrdin's plans. The Chinese are 
particularly interested in the personality of the premier. For 
the first time recently they can see atop the Russian pyramid of 
power someone they can understand and who is close to them in 
spirit. 
  The program for the Russian prime minister's visit to China, 
planned for late spring-early summer, has not yet been agreed, 
but it can be assumed with confidence that his talks with State 
Council Premier Li Peng will mainly address economic issues -- 
construction of a series of hydroelectric power stations and 
Russia's participation in modernizing more than 150 enterprises 
built in the fifties with the USSR's help. The Russian side 
plans to involve the stricken defense enterprises of Siberia and 
the Far East in the latter project. The Chinese are not 
rejecting this option, but nor are they rushing to commit 
themselves with specific pledges, leaving the door open for the 
time being for others who want to participate in the 
modernization -- specifically, Hong Kong investors. 
  Military-technical cooperation remains another sphere of 
major mutual interest for Russia and China. Russian arms 
supplies to Beijing invariably arouse poorly concealed 
irritation in the West, and this was evident from the questions 
which foreign correspondents put to Andrey Kozyrev at the final 
press conference. The minister was quite dry and hostile in 
rejecting the suspicions of behind-the-scenes deals between our 
country and the PRC, stating that all contracts concluded in 
this sphere have been submitted to the UN register. Western 
journalists were clearly unhappy with this answer. The 
curiosity of the corps of journalists in Beijing was intensified 
by the presence in the Russian delegation of Colonel General 
Boris Gromov, deputy defense minister. He did not take part in 
the most intensive section of the bilateral talks -- the foreign 
ministers' meeting -- but appeared merely at protocol events. 
Interest in Gromov was boosted by agency reports on the eve of 
the visit about major differences between Moscow and Beijing 
over the delivery of Su-27 fighter-bombers. The Chinese are 
allegedly refusing to pay for a second batch of aircraft, 
insisting that Russia sell them the technology to produce the 
aircraft. It should be noted that neither the colonel general 
himself nor people in Kozyrev's entourage clarified the problem. 
The delegation members literally "clammed up" at the merest 
mention of the arms trade. 
  The Foreign Ministry experts' explanation for the secrecy 
over this issue is that they wish to preserve commercial 
secrets. Despite this, various rumors and a lack of trust will 
undoubtedly continue to accompany the development of 
Russian-Chinese military ties. 
  Whereas the mutual benefits of "constructive partnership" 
are 
more or less obvious in the economic sphere, in the political 
sphere the new concept at first glance holds out more advantages 
for Moscow, which is counting on Beijing's support on the issue 
of Russia's membership of Asia-Pacific Cooperation (APEC). 
Moreover, the Kremlin is expecting help from the PRC in its 
attempts to block the spread of Muslim extremism in the former 
Soviet republics of Central Asia. 
  "Beijing has a better understanding than certain Western 
capitals of the danger that Central Asia faces from religious 
extremism," Andrey Kozyrev stated. He explained that for China, 
like Russia, Central Asia is their nearest neighbor. Needless 
to say, it is not simply a question of geopolitics -- the 
Chinese are worried about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism 
among the Uighurs, who make up the majority of the population in 
the northwest of the country. Incidentally, the scale of the 
Uighur separatism problem in China and the range of issues which 
Russia is encountering in the new states of Central Asia are 
hardly comparable. 
  As for our country's membership of APEC, despite the Chinese 
leaders' official assurances of sympathy for this desire, 
Russian diplomats say that no real support from Beijing should 
be expected in the immediate future. Everyone is working on 
their own behalf in this area, and the PRC leadership is in no 
hurry to act as defender of the interests of a not entirely 
understandable or stable Russia. 
  While expecting few benefits from cooperation with China, 
the 
Kremlin at the same time cannot ignore the problem of human 
rights in the PRC -- a problem which has caused so much lively 
interest in the West, and primarily in the United States. So 
far the criticism of Beijing from Russian representatives, 
including the foreign minister during the latest trip, has been 
absolutely unspecific. Kozyrev formulated Russia's official 
position as follows: "We are not making this subject a taboo, 
but nor do we plan to kick up a fuss about it." Foreign 
Ministry experts are privately voicing the following views: 
First, we should remember the Chinese political tradition, 
which has always placed the interests of state stability above 
the interests of the individual; second, we should be as active 
as possible in bringing China into contact with the outside 
world -- not least through work in international organizations 
-- gradually encouraging it to make concessions and to 
liberalize the humanitarian sphere. 
  In the opinion of certain Russian foreign policy department 
staffers, the U.S. view of the human rights problem in the PRC 
is largely based on short-term considerations linked to the 
battle over most favored nation status in trade and the pressure 
from the strong Chinese lobby. At any event, Moscow's line 
essentially still maintains its continuity with Gorbachev's 
famous statement on the Tiananmen Square events of 1989: "This 
is China's internal affair." 
  Russia is expecting a response from the PRC to the idea of 
"constructive partnership" and is hoping to get a more or less 
clear answer from PRC President Jiang Zemin, who is expected to 
pay an official visit to the Russian capital in the late summer 
or the fall.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "report": "Russian-Japanese Negotiations </F>
Scheduled for Late February"] 
  [Text] It has finally been announced simultaneously in 
Moscow and Tokyo that the long-awaited vice foreign ministerial 
talks between Russia and Japan and working level meetings on the 
bilateral peace treaty within this framework will be held in 
Moscow on 21-22 February. These vice ministerial talks will be 
the first official meeting between Russian and Japanese 
representatives to be held since President Boris Yeltsin's visit 
to Japan last October. As a result, significant attention from 
many nations, including third party nations, has been focused on 
the talks. 
  Although there are still over three weeks before the talks 
begin in Moscow, at this time we can probably go ahead and make 
the following assumption; that is, the talks will be held in a 
less friendly atmosphere than there existed at the time of 
Yeltsin's visit to Japan. 
  Several recent incidents have clearly accounted for the 
cooling down of bilateral relations. Above all, the major 
factor is the dumping of radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan 
by the Russian Navy and apprehensions that it may be repeated. 
Of course, efforts have been made by both nations toward 
seeking a solution to the problem, but so far not everything has 
been settled. 
  Meanwhile, Japanese fishing boats have violated Russian 
territorial waters, and it has been reported that the Japanese 
Government plans to review its credit extension program to 
Russia, particularly on temporarily suspending humanitarian aid. 
  More important, however, is that political developments in 
both nations are raising great concerns over future bilateral 
relations; that is, there has been cabinet reshuffling in the 
Russian Government, and the political reform bills have not been 
passed in the upper house of the Japanese Diet so far. There 
are concerns in Japan that revisions in Russia's reform policy 
due to the reshuffling of the cabinet of Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin may adversely affect its foreign policy, including 
its relations with Japan, and result in Russia taking a more 
hard-line attitude. 
  On the other hand, there have emerged views in Russia that 
even if the main core of the current administration of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa were to remain in power, the 
administration could get stronger, resulting in its taking 
tougher stance regarding relations with Russia. In this 
backdrop, it can readily be imagined that the most important 
task for the two nations in the bilateral talks is to assure 
each other that there will be no changes in policy regarding 
political matters. 
  For that matter, steps have already been taken by the two 
nations toward this end. For example, it can be recalled that 
on the opening day of the Russian Federal Assembly, the upper 
chamber of the Russian parliament, President Yeltsin made 
remarks stressing that he still has final say over Russian 
foreign policy as before and that there will likely be no 
changes to it. The president's remarks were directed at Japan. 
As for Japan, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is also deputy 
prime minister, has stated in a news conference that on Russian 
aid, there will be no changes in the Japanese Government policy. 
  It is expected that at a meeting of influential people of 
Russia and Japan scheduled to be held in Tokyo in early 
February, steps will be taken to deepen mutual understanding and 
strengthen mutual confidence that has recently been complicated 
by problems. In the last several years, an important step 
regarding bilateral relations was taken whereby the two nations 
have been able to change their past relation of conflict into 
one of mutual understanding and cooperation. What is important 
now is to maintain what has been achieved, prevent reversal, and 
continue on the path toward establishing a true partnership 
between the two nations. It is hoped that political dialogue 
between Russia and Japan, including the upcoming bilateral 
talks, will contribute toward this goal.

  [Text] Tokyo, 31 Jan -- Tsutomu Hata, Japanese deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, intends to visit Russia soon. 
ITAR-TASS was informed of this by Gennadiy Burbulis, member of 
the State Duma and president of the "Strategy" humanitarian and 
politological center, who met the Japanese foreign minister in 
Tokyo today. 
  During the talks both countries' aspiration "to achieve 
serious development" of bilateral relations was reiterated, 
Gennadiy Burbulis said. Burbulis, who is here to attend the 
tripartite forum of Russian, U.S., and Japanese representatives 
on security in the northern Pacific, stressed Russia's intention 
"to seek the most specific forms of economic cooperation with 
Russia." 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS Sumio Edamura, a former 
Japanese ambassador in Moscow, who attended the meeting at the 
Foreign Ministry, spoke highly of today's talks between Gennadiy 
Burbulis and the country's prime minister [as received] and 
foreign minister. "The arrival in Tokyo of one of the leaders of 
Russia's Choice, the biggest grouping in the State Duma, and his 
meetings with representatives of our government show that Moscow 
is committed to a policy of developing the entire range of 
relations with Japan," Edamura noted.

  [Text] Tokyo February 1 TASS -- A three-sided forum on 
security in the Northern Pacific with the participation of 
representatives from Russia, the United States and Japan opened 
here on Tuesday [1 February]. 
  "A political basis for the forum was laid during Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan in October last year. 
The forum will consider practically the entire range of matters 
concerning the situation in the Asia-Pacific region and measures 
to build confidence among the three countries," Colonel-General 
Andrey Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of Russia's frontier 
forces, told ITAR-TASS. The general arrived here to participate 
in the consultations. 
  This forum is being held as an unofficial meeting at which 
no 
official agreements will be adopted and no statements issued. 
The principal purpose of the forum is to enable experts and 
government representatives of the three countries to exchange 
views frankly in a confidential atmosphere on the complex 
problem of ensuring stability and security in the region and map 
out ways to establish effective three-sided cooperation in this 
respect, the need for which Washington, Moscow and Tokyo have 
come to realise. 
  Konstantin Sarkisov, deputy director of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences' Institute of Oriental Studies and member of the 
Russian delegation, in an ITAR-TASS interview, described the 
forum as a "sign of the times", pointing out that the time has 
come to make multilateral efforts to ensure security in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  To Russia, the Tokyo forum is of particular importance, the 
expert said. His opinion is that the forum may become a regular 
one and in due course turn into a permanently functioning 
three-sided commission of representatives of the three countries. 
  On the Russian delegation are also Gennadiy Burbulis, a 
deputy to the State Duma, Vladimir Zhurbenko, first deputy chief 
of the General Staff, Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov, 
Academician Aleksandr Yakovlev, and Vladlen Martynov, director 
of the Institute for the World Economy and International 
Relations. 
  The United States and Japan are represented at the forum by 
a 
large group of experts and officials, among them Graham Allison, 
a prominent expert on Russia and U.S. assistant secretary of 
defence, and Hiroshi Fukuda, Japanese deputy minister of foreign 
affairs.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo February 1 TASS -- Tokyo now has practically 
all main technologies and components to develop its own nuclear 
weapons, since they were developed separately during civilian 
research, two leading Japanese independent experts, Hisashi 
Maeda and Haruo Fujii, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday [1 February] in 
separate interviews. 
  They virtually confirmed the legitimacy of the conclusions 
drawn by the British Defence Ministry which, according to press 
reports, had warned its government way back last December that 
Tokyo was close to developing a nuclear bomb. 
  Mr. Fujii believes, in particular, that Japan's strategy is 
to distribute the formation of a nuclear potential among 
civilian sectors which raise no suspicions. Under present 
conditions Tokyo has no possibility to "hide" any large research 
expenditure in the state budget without specifying the purpose 
of the research efforts, Mr. Maeda pointed out, for his part. 
  Such a strategy yields certain results because, for example, 
the country's companies have long devised unique explosive 
devices for carrying out complex oil-prospecting operations, the 
devices which may serve already now as finished detonators for a 
nuclear bomb. 
  Of course, substantial technical obstacles still remain in 
the path of the development of a combat nuclear capability. 
However, the main problem, in experts' opinion, still is in 
making a political decision on the establishment of such systems 
in practice. 
  Japan is now obviously not prepared for such a dramatic 
step, 
considering the pacifist sentiments among the public, the 
memories of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the 
constitutional bans, and the government-adopted three 
non-nuclear principles: Not to have, not to produce and not to 
import nuclear weapons. 
  However, Mr. Maeda believes that Tokyo may seriously change 
its stance if it encounters a chain reaction of the proclamation 
of "nuclear sovereignties" by neighbouring countries. Japan is 
extremely worried by sufficiently reliable reports about North 
Korea's feverish nuclear efforts. There are suspicions that 
Seoul may also embark upon the same road if it fails to contain 
the military threat from Phyongyang by other means. 
  Mr. Maeda is of the opinion that Japan can well become a 
third "new nuclear power of the region" after South Korea, 
although, in his view, Tokyo would hardly make such a decision 
easily.

<F P=106> [Sergey Ivanov report under the "Inform" rubric: "Patriotic </F>
Mood"] 
  [Text] New York -- U.S. Under Secretary of Defense Frank 
Wisner has announced the Pentagon's plans to site Patriot ABM 
launchers on the border with the DPRK in order to reinforce the 
18-mile line separating the two Koreas. In his opinion, this 
will not hamper the talks between the interested sides. This is 
supposedly being done exclusively for self-defense purposes to 
support the 36,000-strong U.S. military contingent and the South 
Korean Army. 
  But, as commentators point out, the Patriots clearly will 
not 
contribute to the slight progress that had become apparent in 
the "Korean nuclear problem."

  [Text] Seoul February 1 TASS -- The development of 
Russo-South Korean relations is "extremely important for 
strengthening peace in the world and, especially, in 
northeastern Asia," South Korean President Kim Yong-sam said at 
a ceremony today when Georgiy Kunadze, extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary ambassador of the Russian Federation to Seoul, 
presented credentials to him. He said also that he follows with 
great interest the pace of reforms in Russia and wished Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin a success in puting them into life. 
  Kim Yong-sam expressed an intention to pay an official visit 
to Russia during this year. "It will be five years this year 
since my first visit to your country and I would like to visit 
it again," he told the ambassador. Kim Yong-sam visited Moscow 
in 1989 as a leader of the opposition Democratic Party for 
Reunification. 
  He met Boris Yeltsin in Seoul, being a presidential nominee 
from the Democratic Liberal Party, during the Russian 
president's visit to South Korea in November 1992.

  [Text] Moscow, 31 Jan--"Russia needs an integral, 
sovereign, stable, and economically sound Georgia. It is only 
with this kind of Georgia that Russia can preserve the friendly 
relations that have been formed over the centuries," Russian 
Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said, speaking at a 
meeting with North Caucasian leaders at the Russian Federation 
Foreign Ministry. 
  This meeting was held on the eve of an official visit to 
Georgia by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. "The importance of 
this trip," Kozyrev stressed, "goes beyond the framework of 
Russian-Georgian relations. Here we are talking about an 
important step toward the implementation of a strategic policy 
in the Caucasus. This policy is set on the basis of a carefully 
calculated balance between state and regional interests." 
  According to Kozyrev, "allegations of some kind of a 
military 
alliance between Russia and Georgia against Abkhazia are totally 
unfounded." Russia, he said, does not divide the Caucasian 
nations into "ours" and "theirs". One of the main tasks of the 
visit is to advance a settlement of the conflicts in Abkhazia 
and South Ossetia and to reaffirm Russia's role as a mediator in 
this process. The Russian minister believes that if the sides 
do not reach a comprehensive political settlement of the Abkhaz 
conflict and do not formulate and sign the relevant documents 
under the auspices of the United Nations, it will be simply 
dangerous optimism to hope for peace in that region. In such a 
case, extreme nationalists, "the party of war", will 
increasingly shape politics in the Caucasus. 
  Kozyrev believes that, as a first step in this direction, it 
is necessary to agree on conducting an operation to support 
peace in Abkhazia, with the necessary involvement of 
peacekeeping forces and international observers. The situation 
in the region is of essential interest to Russia. That is why 
it is, yet again, primarily Russian peacekeepers who will have 
to conduct this peacekeeping effort in Abkhazia. Both Georgians 
and Russians are asking for it. Russia will once more carry the 
largest burden of the peacekeeping challenge--of safeguarding 
human lives, of the sovereignty of the neighboring state, and of 
the rights of national minorities. 
  Incidentally, the minister continued, "not only is Russia 
not 
hiding from the international community, but it is asking for 
its support". He resolutely denied "patronizing or vicious 
gloating by outsiders, or speculations by "the Zhirinovskiy 
factor", both in Russia and in the West. "What one needs is not 
lecturing on norms of the United Nations or the CSCE, but the 
practical effort to establish these norms in the Transcaucasia, 
as well as across the post-Soviet area on the whole," Kozyrev 
said. 
  During the course of the visit, the issue of the North 
Ossetian settlement will be raised with the Georgian leadership. 
The truce in North Ossetia is being maintained, thanks to the 
presence of the Russian peacekeeping contingent and 
representatives of the CSCE. Bloodshed may resume there at any 
time.

  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- Russia needs an integral, 
sovereign, stable and economically prosperous Georgia to 
preserve centuries-old friendly relations between the two 
republics, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said. 
  Speaking at a meeting with North Caucasian leaders in Moscow 
on Monday on the eve of President Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Georgia, Kozyrev said that the visit will go beyond purely 
Georgian-Russian relations as it will signify a serious step 
towards carrying out a strategy based on the balance of national 
and regional interests in the Caucasus. 
  The Russian foreign minister brushed off as groundless 
suspicions of a "military-political alliance" between Russia and 
Georgia against Abkhazia. Russia does not divide Caucasian 
people into "friendly" and "alien." It seeks to push forward 
the conflict settlement in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and 
confirm Russia's role as an active mediator in this process, 
Kozyrev noted. 
  If no comprehensive political settlement is reached and no 
documents are worked out and signed with the participation of 
Russia and the United Nations, it would be complacency to hope 
for peace and stability in that region, Kozyrev stressed. He 
warned that in that case extreme nationalists will take over in 
the region. 
  He stressed that reaching an agreement on peace-keeping 
measures in Abkhazia is a top priority. Those should involve 
international peace-keeping forces and observers. Russia has 
vital interests in that region, Kozyrev recalled, and will have 
to take part in the operation as well. Both Georgia and 
Abkhazia request so, he added. 
  Kozyrev denounced "mentorship or malevolence of outside 
observers and speculations about the `Zhirinovskiy factor', both 
in Russia and abroad. We need not lectures about the norms of 
the United Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe (CSCE), but practical assistance to promote them in 
the Caucasus and the entire post-Soviet space." 
  During Yeltsin's visit to Georgia due to take place on 
February 3-4, the Russian leader will raise the question of 
conflict settlement in South Ossetia where peace has been 
maintained by Russian peacekeepers and CSCE representatives.

  [Text] Moscow has no reason to believe that Kiev might 
"revise" the Russian-Ukrainian-American agreements on nuclear 
arms, the chief Russian negotiator at the talks with Ukraine, 
Yuriy Dubinin, told Interfax. 
  "Further negotiations on this issue are required, to 
determine the procedure of their implementation, not to define 
or change the agreements reached at the highest level," he said. 
  With reference to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, 
Dubinin 
pointed out that "it can be resolved, and must be resolved, 
particularly from the point of view of care for the Fleet's 
personnel." "The ways to resolve this issue were determined at 
the highest level, and what remains now is to reach agreement on 
the order of implementing what was planned," he said. 
  The problems existing in relations between Russia and 
Ukraine 
"must not be driven into a corner; they must be resolved fairly, 
on the path of friendship and cooperation," the diplomat 
stressed. "Both nations want it," Dubinin said. Russia's 
Foreign Ministry believes that it is imperative to implement all 
the agreements reached earlier between Russia and Ukraine, he 
pointed out.

  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- Russia is interested in 
political and economic stability in the Crimea, a Russian 
Foreign Ministry official said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, the official said 
that "Russia is interested in political and economic stability 
in the Crimea and will continue to build its relations with 
Ukraine on the basis of the existing agreements, including those 
concerning regional cooperation." 
  "Experience accumulated in relations between the two 
countries shows that in the current situation the development of 
versatile ties between various regions of Russia and Ukraine may 
help improve the economic situation and living standards and 
reduce social tension," the official said. 
  Commenting on the results of the presidential elections in 
the Crimea on Sunday, the official stressed that "an assessment 
of the results of the elections in the Crimea should be made by 
Ukraine itself in the first place. It is its internal business." 
  "The victory of the leader of the political bloc Russia, 
Yuriy Meshkov, signifies that his position on most urgent issues 
was closer to and more understandable for the residents of the 
Crimea. The complex economic situation in Ukraine and in this 
region in particular played not the last role in the outcome of 
the voting," he added.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report under the general headline "Yuriy </F>
Meshkov's Election as Crimean President Creates Fundamentally 
New Situation in Russian-Crimean Relations"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Yuriy Meshkov's more than convincing 
victory in the Crimean presidential election creates a 
fundamentally new situation in Russian-Ukrainian relations. 
Until now it was only at opposition parties' demonstrations and 
rallies that calls for the peninsula to separate from Ukraine 
and join Russia were voiced, which relieved Moscow of the duty 
of officially reacting to them. After 30 January the picture 
changed: A man who does not conceal his pro-Russian sympathies 
and who is firmly intent on holding a referendum on the 
peninsula's status in the near future has come to power in the 
Crimea. 
  Kiev is resolutely coming out against this idea: It is not 
hard to predict the outcome of the voting. If the new Crimean 
leader shows stubbornness by insisting on a referendum, the 
situation on the peninsular will deteriorate sharply, 
threatening to cause serious complications in Russian-Ukrainian 
relations as well. Especially if matters reach the point of an 
armed conflict between supporters and opponents of the Crimea's 
separation. 
  For Russian diplomats this scenario of the development of 
events is the most undesirable. "We do not need the Crimea to 
join us at the expense of a rift with Ukraine," a Foreign 
Ministry representative, who wishes to remain anonymous, said. 
"We will use all our influence on Meshkov to incline him toward 
a dialogue with Kiev." 
  The Crimean question is a headache that Moscow could well do 
without. Yeltsin has more than enough problems with the Russian 
regions. The best solution for Moscow would be to let Kravchuk 
and Meshkov unravel the Crimean knot while remaining on the 
sidelines: Kiev agrees to a referendum in the Crimea, the 
peninsula's inhabitants come out in favor of a separation, and 
Ukraine recognizes the Crimea's independence; after which the 
Republic of Crimea, as a subject of international law, asks to 
be accepted into the Russian Federation, and Moscow considers 
this question calmly, without fearing a breach of the Helsinki 
accord. In time, as the economic and political crisis in 
Ukraine deepens, this development of events cannot be ruled out, 
but as of today it is unlikely. 
  Most likely Kiev will not reconcile itself to losing the 
Crimea, the threat of a conflict will acquire real definition, 
and the world will perceive support for the separatists by 
Moscow as interference in a neighboring state's affairs and an 
encroachment on its territorial integrity. The result will be a 
threat of Russia's being isolated in the international arena and 
a deterioration in relations with the West and the CIS countries. 
  By all accounts the Russian Foreign Ministry's efforts in 
the 
next few months will be aimed at reducing tension in the Crimea 
and preventing an open conflict between Kiev and Simferopol, but 
if it does break out, avoiding Moscow's involvement in it. 
Undoubtedly this policy will have a considerable number of 
opponents -- and not only among Crimean radicals. As the 
parliamentary elections showed, a considerable section of the 
Russian electorate has nationalistic leanings. Duma deputies, 
who reflect these people's views, will certainly unleash a 
powerful campaign to try to incline President Yeltsin toward 
taking more decisive steps to support his fellow countrymen in 
the Crimea.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shinkin report under "Nearby Foreign Countries" </F>
rubric: "The Crimea. An Expected Victory"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Yuriy Aleksandrovich Meshkov 
was born in 1945. His mother is Ukrainian. His father is 
Russian -- a Don Cossack. After finishing secondary school in 
Simferopol he served in the Border Troops. He then studied at 
Moscow State University Law Faculty. After defending his 
diploma he was an investigator in the Crimea Prosecutor's Office 
and an attorney. Meshkov is a deputy of the Crimean Supreme 
Soviet, in which he heads the "Republic" deputies' group. He is 
chairman of the Crimean Republican Movement and Crimean 
Republican Party. 
  By all accounts Meshkov's victory does not suit Kiev's 
politicians. Primarily because in his election program he 
advocated the lifting of the moratorium on a referendum on the 
Crimea's status. Its results, should it take place, are not 
hard to predict. But this carries the risk that the Crimean 
precedent could "detonate" Ukraine's eastern and southern 
regions. According to sociologists' data, pro-Russian 
sentiments are becoming increasingly strong in them. Moreover, 
a political force capable of consolidating them has appeared in 
Ukraine -- the Interregional Bloc for Reforms, which is headed 
by Vladimir Grinev and Leonid Kuchma, who advocate close 
cooperation with Russia. 
  The first threats that the most resolute measures will be 
taken in relation to the Crimea, even including the introduction 
of troops there, have already been uttered in Kiev. It is no 
accident that anxious Kiev parliamentarians have granted the 
president additional powers -- to rescind decisions of local 
organs of power, including Crimean organs, if they do not accord 
with the Ukrainian Constitution. 
  But Leonid Kravchuk has remained true to himself. So far he 
has not openly expressed his attitude toward the Crimean 
elections and is patiently enduring the accusations of radical 
national-patriots. The president once again finds himself in a 
difficult situation. On the one hand he gave his personal 
blessing to the election venture ("If the people want to elect a 
president they have the right to do so"), but on the other hand 
the demands to declare them invalid are altogether too insistent. 
  It must be assumed that for now Kravchuk will confine 
himself 
to removing Ivan Yermakov from the post of his representative in 
Sevastopol and will wait and see how events in the Crimea 
develop further. After all, judging by his last television 
debate, Meshkov came across as a reasonable and flexible 
politician, dispelling the myth created about him that he is an 
extremist.

  [Text] Vaduz (Principality of Liechtenstein), 31 Jan 
(ITAR-TASS) -- Russia has established direct diplomatic 
relations with the Principality of Liechtenstein. A joint 
communique signed today in the capital of this small alpine 
state by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Mario 
Frick, chief of government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, 
stresses the desire of both countries and peoples to develop and 
strengthen relations and to promote mutual understanding and 
cooperation on the basis of the principles and standards of 
international law. 
  The accord on the establishment of direct diplomatic 
relations comes into force from the date of signing. 
  During his stay in Vaduz, Viktor Chernomyrdin had a private 
audience with Prince Hans Adam II von und zu Liechtenstein, who 
gave a dinner in honor of the top-ranking Russian guest. The 
head of the Russian Government also had a conversation with the 
head of the Liechtenstein Government. They exchanged views on 
the state of relations between the two countries, above all in 
the economic field. The heads of government called for the 
all-round development of bilateral contacts. 
  In Vaduz, the Russian prime minister visited Baron Eduard 
von 
(?Falz-Fein), a citizen of Liechtenstein of Russian origin, who 
was recently awarded the Order of Friendship of the Peoples for 
his outstanding contribution to preserving and increasing the 
cultural heritage of the Russian Federation and for returning 
cultural artifacts and works of art to the country.

Sensations Around Visit. Events Behind Official Protocol of 
Russian Premier's Visit to Italy"] 
  [Text] Moscow-Rome-Vatican City-Moscow -- Last night 
Russian Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin returned from a 
visit to Switzerland. As you know, he went there 29 January 
straight from Fiumicino Airport (Rome) after visiting Italy. 
Now that all has ended well, I can talk about a sensation of 
which everyone was unaware, apart from a few people responsible 
for getting the high-ranking official to the location of the 
visit and back, but first a word about a few other events that 
occurred during Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Italy. 
  A group of Russian journalists arrived at Ciampino military 
airfield near Rome half an hour before the main delegation from 
Russia. Preparations to receive the eminent visitor were in 
full swing here. The carpet had already been laid, 
blue-uniformed employees were moving a square carpet from place 
to place trying to find the right spot for it, and guardsmen in 
parade dress and bandsmen formed up in front of the small 
building. As soon as the special Russian Tu-134 touched down, 
everything came to life: Policemen started running around 
following their commander's orders, our security service sprang 
into action, and officials walked down the carpet to where the 
airliner was intended to come to a halt. We journalists were 
taken to a symbolically chained-off area and two guards were 
posted next to us. Viktor Chernomyrdin and his wife came down 
the ramp and the solemn ceremony began. 
  We were above all struck by the absence of local mass media 
representatives. This caused us some surprise. The new 
schedule for the official visit which we were handed at the 
airport listed the following among the party to welcome the 
Russian premier: Italian Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta 
and his wife; F. di Roberto, Italian ambassador to Russia, and 
his wife; G. di Lorenzo, head of Italian Diplomatic Protocol, 
and his wife. These people are not that high-ranking. The 
following question involuntarily arose: Does this not smack of 
some disregard for our head of government? In response to my 
puzzled question, an embassy spokesman said that it all depends 
on the host country and different states have their own 
protocol. And, as for Italian journalists, they simply might 
not have been allowed in. In a word there was no sensation. 
  A motorcycle escort accompanied Viktor Chernomyrdin to his 
residence -- the Grand Hotel. This is undoubtedly a high-class 
hotel. But a more fitting place could have been found for the 
premier of a country like Russia, for instance, the Villa 
Abamelik [name as transliterated], the residence of the Russian 
ambassador to Italy. We saw that this villa is one of the most 
respectable addresses during a reception given by the Russian 
ambassador. Set in vast grounds with evergreens, flowerbeds, 
and elegant old buildings. Inside there are paintings, 
tapestries, and gilded walls and ceilings. Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's modesty probably prevented him availing himself 
of what is indeed a mansion fit for a czar. 
  Two hours after his arrival Viktor Chernomyrdin was 
scheduled 
to meet with Italian Prime Minister C.A. Ciampi at the Villa 
Madama. It is situated on one of the highest points in Rome, the 
Monte Mario. There were just a few minutes before the talks 
began. Russian and Italian journalists had already assembled to 
cover the important meeting. One by one automobiles arrived 
with officials. Then suddenly a police car got stuck on the 
gravel in front of the building. There was some confusion among 
the onlookers. After all, the Russian premier's motorcade was 
due to arrive at any minute. However, to journalists' chagrin, 
everything went without the longed-for sensation. The police 
pushed the car out of the way. 
  The talks with Prime Minister Ciampi were more than 
successful. He promised support for Viktor Chernomyrdin when 
the question of Russia's joining the club of leading industrial 
powers is discussed during the coming G-7 summit in July. This 
statement made at a press conference has serious foundation. 
After all, this time Italy is chairing the G-7. That is, 
Rome's attitude to the Russian premier's visit is extremely 
serious and committed. 
  A real sensation was brewing after the talks. Valentin 
Sergeyev, head of the Russian prime minister's press service, 
unexpectedly summoned an INTERFAX representative (I don't know 
why the choice fell on what is effectively a private agency 
although correspondents from the state-owned ITAR-TASS and RIA 
"Novosti" were also there) and urgently asked him to carry a 
strange report via agency channels. It accused Italy's CORRIERE 
DELLA SERA of publishing an article which cited Viktor 
Chernomyrdin as saying "I give the orders in Moscow." Valentin 
Sergeyev described this stunt as a "hopeless venture" [dokhlaya 
koshka]. He was convinced that it was planned by people wanting 
to drive a wedge between the Russian president and premier. The 
head of the press service awaited the reaction of local 
journalists and even asked us to get them to organize a briefing 
in order to deal a worthy rebuff. However, there was no reaction 
from anyone. There was no sensation. 
  But many people agonized over another question: Why did 
Italian President Scalfaro not receive Viktor Chernomyrdin? The 
meeting was scheduled for 27 January. But it transpired that 
the president's father had died and so he had to postpone his 
conversation with his eminent Russian visitor. When he met 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Scalfaro apologized at length and stressed 
that these talks are very important for him. 
  A visit to Vatican City and an audience with Pope John Paul 
II were scheduled for day two of the visit. Having obtained 
special visas we arrived in the Vatican ahead of schedule. We 
were led through countless rooms, past formed up Swiss guards, 
and down secret corridors. In every office there was a guard in 
a colorful uniform. When anyone appeared he would stamp his 
foot and pike sharply, making some intricate movements and 
frightening those present since we did not entirely realize the 
significance of his actions. It turned out that this was how he 
welcomed eminent visitors. We went through a narrow passageway 
to the door of the Pope's personal library. Some time later the 
doors opened and Pope John Paul II himself came out to meet us. 
He greeted us in Russian. A few seconds later Viktor 
Chernomyrdin came in from the opposite side with members of his 
delegation. They then closeted themselves with the Pope. A 
one-on-one discussion took place. Everyone was impatient to hear 
the news. We looked at the ceilings painted by Raphael and the 
tapestries executed in accordance with the great artist's 
sketches. Time went by. According to protocol the visit was to 
have lasted 30 minutes. A conversation with Vatican State 
Secretary A. Sodano was scheduled for later. But the meeting 
only ended about an hour later. We were given permission along 
with the delegation to bid the Pope farewell and shake his hand. 
There was a breach of protocol. I was told by the Russian 
mission in the Vatican that this was an unofficial visit. What 
is more, it is the first ever visit of its kind at this level. 
And, despite being a strictly private meeting, all the 
requisite honors involving the Swiss Guard were performed. The 
Pope showed tremendous interest in Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit. 
According to informed sources, the sensation with regard to the 
extended audience was planned by the Vatican itself in order to 
thus show its great respect for Russia's head of government. 
But Viktor Chernomyrdin's entire schedule was thrown out by 
half an hour. Yet the remaining meetings took place at the 
highest level. 
  By and large there were no deviations from protocol during 
the visit. Everything planned in Moscow was carried out with 
the exception of certain rearrangements. There were, if I can 
say this, sensations too. Nevertheless no journalists were 
aware of the main one, which occurred literally a few hours 
before leaving Vnukovo-2. 
  The point is that, before an aircraft is provided for an 
official trip, it is carefully checked over -- given a run 
through. A special Tu-154M aircraft was scheduled to be used 
for the Italian visit. As usual, it was tested in accordance 
with procedure. The state commission then met. It examined the 
functionability of all the airliner's systems. The 
investigation was carried out with reference to the materials 
provided by the government commission investigating the crash 
near Irkutsk. Since the aircraft scheduled to fly to Italy was 
the same type as the one that crashed. It emerged during the 
discussion that there are a host of contentious issues regarding 
this aircraft. In particular, it was necessary to see that the 
so-called TA-6A auxiliary power unit was in good working order 
and check that there was no failure in its combustion chamber 
components. This regrettably proved impossible to do. There is 
still no technology to perform these checks. And it was this 
component that, according to preliminary information, was the 
cause of the Irkutsk crash. Had this flight gone ahead and this 
assembly been in disrepair there might have been a fire. So, in 
order to preclude the danger, the state commission decided to 
replace the Tu-154M with a standby aircraft.

  [Text] The ex Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has told 
Interfax that NATO's "Partnership for Peace" is a "camouflage to 
expand NATO in some form and bring its activity close to 
Russia's borders." "One should not expect from it better 
relations and tranquility. On the contrary, the seeds of 
discord and suspicion have been planted", Gorbachev believes. 
  Initially, there was the issue on an early admission to NATO 
of new members, but, seeing Russia's disapproval of this 
possibility, the North Atlantic Alliance "resorted to 
maneuvering and devised the `Partnership for Peace' initiative." 
It's clear that NATO has, in fact, not given up the idea of 
expanding the bloc, he remarked. 
  In Gorbachev's words, "it turns out that in U.S" Russia "is 
suspected of threatening its neighbors." "That's merely an 
insult to the people of Russia", the ex president said. 
  In his opinion, a positive response to the concept from 
Russia's president and government at the recent NATO summit 
Brussels testifies to the absence of an integral home and 
foreign policy concept in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Leonid Kornilov report: "Poles Urge Boycott of </F>
Zhirinovskiy"] 
  [Text] Warsaw --- Who has invited Zhirinovskiy to Poland? 
The answer is Janusz Bryczkowski, a businessman and founder of 
the "Self-Defense" national front. Formerly a "green," later a 
supporter of the extremist farmers' party, he now works with the 
Communists in the patriotic association "Grunwald." 
  "I am on very good terms with Zhirinovskiy," Bryczkowski 
stated. "I shall do everything to make him a friend of Poland. 
I am sure that he is a future leader [vozhd] of Russia." 
  "Why is this leader of the brownshirts being allowed in 
here?" the Poles ask anxiously. "After all, other countries 
which he has not threatened as overtly as Poland have refused 
him a visa or have promptly booted him out: Germany, Bulgaria, 
France, Australia...." But a Russian citizen does not ned a 
visa to enter Poland. 
  "If Zhirinovskiy has the correctly completed documents, 
there 
are no formal obstacles to his entry into Poland," Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski noted. 
  Admittedly there is a secret list of people whose presence 
in 
Poland is considered undesirable. That list is based on 
information from the Prosecutor's Office, the Foreign Ministry, 
Interpol, the police, and the Border Guard Forces. Zhirinovskiy 
is not on that list. However, even though the leader of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] has given an assurance 
that he loves Poland and has even promised to return Lvov to the 
Poles, he may be expelled from the country if he commits a 
provocative act. For example, were he to make the kind of 
attacks here that he made in Bulgaria against President Zhelyu 
Zhelev, then under Polish law he would face the threat of 
between six months and eight years in jail. 
  No serious Polish politician, from the president to the 
ministers and deputies, intends sitting at the same table with 
Zhirinovskiy. Closing the border to him means giving a clear 
signal to his Russian followers that they are marching to 
nowhere. 
  Aleksander Hall, leader of the Conservative Party, has said 
that there should be no fuss created around this figure, that he 
should not be given free publicity, and that his scandalous 
comments should not be carried in the press. 
  "More stable countries which are better versed in the 
subtleties of democracy have treated him as nothing more or less 
than a scoundrel," the newspaper ZYCIE WARSZAWY says to its 
readers and colleagues. "Let us not be original, let us ignore 
him too." 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will arrive in Warsaw on Sunday, 30 
January. 
  "All Poland will meet me!" the LDPR leader has stated. 
  Zhirinovskiy will visit the Grunwald battlefield [scene of 
1410 battle in which Poles defeated Teutonic knights] and the 
country estate of his host, Janusz Bryczkowski. 
  "I would be a complete idiot if I did not receive the future 
president of Russia at my home and drink vodka with him," the 
latter stated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian </F>
Liberal Democratic Party, by Rolf Gauffin for the Italian LIMES 
magazine; place and date not given: "On the Search for a Lost 
Empire"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the right-wing 
extremist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is currently 
travelling through Europe. Yesterday he left Slovenia after 
having been asked by the Foreign Ministry in Ljubljana to leave 
the country as quickly as possible. Hinting to the former 
Yugoslav republics, he said that every people could not have a 
state of its own. He now intends to travel to Serbia. The 
following interview with Zhirinovskiy was conducted by Rolf 
Gauffin for the Italian geo-political LIMES magazine. The 
former French diplomat, who retired in 1991, now works as a 
free-lance journalist. 
  [Gauffin] How important is geography for you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] From my early childhood on, history and 
geography have been very important for me. In the final years 
of my education, I took a particular interest in historical 
geography. I was born in deepest Asia, near the Chinese border. 
I did my military service in the Caucasus, and then I moved to 
Moscow. 
  [Gauffin] How could Gorbachev hope to liberalize the Soviet 
Union without taking territorial and national questions into 
account? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Gorbachev's political concept resulted in the 
disintegration of the state and the collapse of the economy. He 
would have had to implement the reforms differently. He would 
have had to use the existing power structures of the Communist 
Party, particularly that of the KGB, and advance the 
democratization of the economy via these very structures, and, 
in a second stage, the democratization of politics. 
  [Gauffin] Why did the Moscow state coup of August 1992 fail? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It was not a state coup in the real sense. 
It was a fight of two or three groups from the inner circle of 
power. This also explains why the state coup was neither planned 
nor carried out like a military operation. This is why it 
failed. 
  [Gauffin] In your book (entitled: "The Last Thrust South?") 
you describe a new security system rather than a Russian empire. 
This system comprehends the Baltic states, the Caucasus, and 
Central Asia. What option do you prefer? A military presence 
without occupation? Would Russia then not risk a repetition of 
what is happening in Afghanistan? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No, one cannot put it that way. The events 
in the Caucasus show that without Russia civil war will break 
out there: Armenia against Azerbaijan, Georgia against Abkhazia 
and Ossetia. The same will repeat along Russia's southern 
border. Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kazakhs -- they will all fight against 
each other. There will not be any Russian troops in those 
regions. The only thing we can do is sell arms. If these 
people want to buy arms then only Russia can do it. We do not 
want a new Afghanistan. Still, what can we witness there now? 
No government, no president, cities fighting against cities. 
That is the future of Afghanistan: The cities will be 
destroyed, traffic will collapse, hospitals will cease to 
function, and communication links will collapse. The entire 
region will go down. Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan will 
intervene, there will be an inferno as in Lebanon or in Northern 
Ireland, and then after 20-30 years, they will come back, tears 
in their eyes, and beseech Russia to solve the situation -- 
mainly at a psychological level. Moscow can make sure that the 
military operations will stop. The awareness of the strength of 
the Russian industry and the power of the Russian Army will stop 
all that. These regions and the international community will ask 
us, and we will -- with certainty -- stop the disaster, but only 
on condition that they pay for it. 
  [Gauffin] How far would you go in protecting the Russian 
minorities in the former Soviet republics, such as in Estonia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] First of all, all Russians living outside 
Russia should be granted Russian citizenship. We will protect 
the Russian minorities mainly through economic measures. If, 
for example, the Russians are forced to leave the Baltic states, 
thus losing their property, we will add this loss to the price 
of goods that we sell there. With this money we will then be 
able to pay compensation to the expelled Russians. Take 
Estonia, for example: We will impose economic sanctions unless 
Russians are granted the right to vote. Considering Russia's 
energy resources and its infrastructure, Estonia will completely 
disappear as a state. That is the reason why we will never use 
military means. We will apply the law and our economy to defend 
Russia's interests. 
  [Gauffin] In an interview with the German NATIONAL-ZEITUNG 
you said that the Oder-Neisse line is not yet the last word in 
history. Can you define the borders of a future Poland that are 
legitimate in your opinion? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Estonia should become part of Russia, because 
a large number of Russians lives there. Yet, Tallinn should 
remain a city state. Latvia should also be part of Russia, 
while Lithuania will become a small, independent state, an 
enclave. The area around Kaliningrad also belongs to Russia, 
and Poland? Well, Prussia was a German state including Wroclaw 
and Szczecin, and all these territories should go to Germany 
again. Poland can have the area around Lwow in compensation for 
its territorial losses. Belarus would like to be integrated 
into Russia. All of eastern Ukraine belongs to Russia and so 
does Moldova. 
  [Gauffin] What about Slovakia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] One day Slovakia will also belong to Russia 
-- and the Czech Republic to Germany. Austria and Slovenia 
should belong together, and Germany, Austria, and Slovenia 
should have access to the Adriatic. This is what the German 
people want. Thus, the Germans would have historical borders in 
the east and south. 
  [Gauffin] What does the future of Kaliningrad look like? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] One day we can give Kaliningrad back to the 
Germans. We want to return everything to the West it would like 
to have. 
  [Gauffin] As it used to be? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Exactly as it used to be. 
  [Gauffin] What about Hungary? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The Hungarians would also like to protect 
their population in Romania, this artificial state. Romania did 
not exist before World War I. This is why the Dobrudja belongs 
to Bulgaria. The remainder will stay with Romania. The 
population there comes from Italy. 
  [Gauffin] And what will happen with Yugoslavia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] All foreign troops must leave the country. 
The Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians should keep the borders that 
exist now. The UN Forces should withdraw so that the warring 
parties can settle the conflict among themselves. 
  [Gauffin] What about Bulgaria? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Bulgaria should get back its historical 
borders. The Dobrudja also belongs to Bulgaria. And the Greeks 
should return Thrace to Bulgaria. But, actually, these are none 
of our problems. 
  Our problems lie in the south. Kazakhstan was never an 
independent state, and it belongs to Russia. As far as Japan, 
Mongolia, China, and India are concerned, we do not have any 
territorial problems. 
  [Gauffin] Let us take a look at the Caucasus now. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Trans-Caucasus. There we have Georgia, 
Azerbaijan, and Armenia. One day, they will ask to be permitted 
to belong to Moscow again. 
  Yet, we do not want these territories. There are only 
criminals there, no reasonable economy, and no opportunities for 
profit for Russia. Iran can take over Azerbaijan, while Armenia 
and Georgia will go to Turkey. These countries have never been 
independent. 
  [Gauffin] What about Finland and the region there? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No problem. Yet, Finland would like to have 
Karelia back. All I can say on this issue is that if Finland 
wants to have Karelia, all of Finland must go to Russia. We 
will not cede one inch in the west. One day, everybody will 
return to Russia. Belarus is Russian, Ukraine is Russian, and 
the people want to belong to Russia. 
  [Gauffin] Are you intending to set up a German-Russian axis? 
A continental alliance as a counterweight to the Atlantic one? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] One day, greater Germany, a new Russia, and 
India will form a new entente. Then there will be no problems 
for the world any more. India and Russia will neutralize China 
in Asia; Russia and Germany can control Europe; and Russia and 
the Balkan states will solve all problems in the Balkans.

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia, arrived in beseiged Leningrad [as 
heard] last night at the invitation of the Democratic Party of 
the Serb Lands and the Russian-Serbian Friendship Society. Our 
Belgrade correspondent, Vladimir Solovyev, reports: 
  [Solovyev] No aircraft fly into Yugoslavia because of the 
sanctions, and the usual way here is by car from Budapest 
Airport. Several thousand people gathered on the square in the 
Serbian town of Subotica, the first town after the border, to 
hear Zhirinovskiy. At his first news conference in the 
restaurant of Belgrade's Hotel Jugoslavija, the democrats' 
leader was given an ovation. In his usual declarative fashion 
he said precisely what the people here have long wanted to hear. 
In Zhirinovskiy's view, there is only one way to stop the war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina: by withdrawing the entire foreign 
military contingent from there and giving the Bosnian Serbs the 
opportunity to finish the war victorious -- and even ultimately 
by sending the Russian army in to help them. Vladimir Volfovich 
[Zhirinovskiy] said that NATO air strikes against Serb positions 
would automatically be a declaration of war against Russia, and 
anyone taking part in that sort of action would soon lose the 
taste for it. 
  Zhirinovskiy will meet with the presidents of two Serb 
provinces today -- Radovan Karadzic and Milan Martic; he will 
address rallies in Bijeljina and Vukovar and on Wednesday will 
probably address a big rally in the center of Belgrade. After 
that he will leave for Montenegro and the Serbian Autonomous 
Province of Kosovo.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the </F>
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, by KURIER in Slovenia on 
29-30 January: "If NATO Is Enlarged, This Will Not Contribute to 
Peace"] 
  [Text] [KURIER] Vladimir Volfovich, you are frightening 
millions of people in Russia and in the whole world with your 
statements. What is your feeling? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The people of the world simply do not know 
how to deal with this new party, the strongest in Russia. The 
people do not have any experience. 
  [KURIER] You want to become Russian president. What would 
you do differently? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I would stop the help for foreign countries 
and turn to internal problems, for example, the high crime rate 
and the reestablishment of the military and military industry. 
  [KURIER] You are constantly quoted as making contradictory 
statements. First you do not want borders to be changed in 
Europe, then you want to reestablish the Soviet Union. What is 
valid? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I meant that the republics of the former 
Soviet Union will voluntarily become Russian territory. 
  [KURIER] You want to return South Tirol to Austria -- this 
would probably not be possible "voluntarily." 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I talked about what would happen in Europe if 
Russia were divided. There are many problematic regions in the 
world, among them are South Tirol, Trieste... 
  [KURIER] The public prosecutor's office in Moscow is 
conducting investigations regarding you because of warmongering. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This is a mistake of the political forces 
that are my opponents. They use every opportunity to harm me. 
  [KURIER] According to your party program, Europe belongs to 
the Russian sphere of influence. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It would be best if all former East Bloc 
states remained neutral. NATO is a military bloc. If a country 
accedes to this bloc, this will not contribute to the 
establishment of peace. NATO will use these countries as small 
partners that are to serve the big members. 
  [KURIER] You are often compared with Hitler. Are there 
parallels? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] There is no reason for these comparisons. 
Then Pinochet and Mao Zedong would also have to be called 
Hitler. There is a Hitler in every country. 
  [KURIER] IZVESTIYA wrote that it is easier for you to seduce 
a nation than a woman. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I never had the problem of being obliged to 
seduce a woman. As far as the nation is concerned -- I am 
working on it.

"congratulated on his birthday" by Aleksandr Gamov; place and

  [Text] [Gamov] Boris Nikolayevich! It is your birthday. 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA congratulates you.... Your life arouses 
natural interest. Not just as the life of the president but as 
the life of a human being. Let us forget politics for a

  [Yeltsin] I grew up in a simple Russian family with a modest 
life-style. I have not had expensive gifts lavished on me. I 
like people to give me simple, useful things. I need an 
electric razor.... Mine has worn out. Because I am a man of 
sporting interests, I can fantasize in that area. I would not 
refuse such a gift as a tennis racket. I have a powerful shot 
and my rackets soon break. Old friends know my habits, they 
know that I do not like expensive or fancy gifts. 
  [Gamov] What present could KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA give you? 
After all, we consider ourselves your old friends. Although we 
do criticize you.... We know that sometimes you take offense at 
us. 
  [Yeltsin] You cannot shield yourself from criticism. This 
was my choice. We have reached this point through the barriers 
of censorship. Now it is necessary to "bear responsibility," as 
the saying goes. As a gift I should like...KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 
not to be abusive. Not without good reason. Or at least not 
every day. 
  [Gamov] Boris Nikolayevich, bearing in mind that you are 
president...what kind of gift would you like? 
  [Yeltsin] From Russia? 
  [Gamov] Yes. 
  [Yeltsin] I would like more peace in Russia today than there 
was yesterday. I want no more bloodshed. I want children to 
play peacefully under a peaceful roof. I want the poor and the 
old to be able to bear the hardships of life more easily. I am 
ready to work for that. I want to celebrate my next birthday in 
a country which is more peaceful and more prosperous. 
  [Gamov] What flowers do you like? 
  [Yeltsin] Roses.... Only they have thorns now. I have 
prices in mind. But there are no roses without thorns. 
  [Gamov] Where will you celebrate your birthday? 
  [Yeltsin] Where normal people celebrate their birthday -- 
with their family. With my wife, children, grandchildren, and 
friends.

  [Text] At a meeting with regional presidential 
representatives on Monday [31 January], administrative chief 
Sergey Filatov voiced concern that the line-up of political 
forces in the local elections could end up similar to the 
outcome of the Federal Assembly elections. 
  There are at least two grounds for these concerns. The first 
is the socio-economic situation in the regions, leading electors 
not to vote for well-considered policies. The second is the 
democrats' lack of unity. 
  The meeting heard the opinion that electoral legislation 
needs fine-tuning, in particular to provide for second rounds of 
voting for candidates to local legislatures. 
  Filatov stressed that the president's supervisory agencies 
will set up bodies to oversee discipline in executive 
authorities in the regions. There will be one department of the 
head of state's administration to work with public 
organizations, with account taken of the forthcoming local 
elections.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- Head of the Presidential 
Administration Sergey Filatov fears that nationalist and 
Communist leaders who offer easy solutions to difficult 
problems, like Vladimir Zhirinovskiy did during election 
campaign, may emerge victorious in the upcoming Russian regional 
polls in March. 
  He voiced his concern at a meeting with presidential 
regional 
representatives on Monday saying that "the balance of political 
forces in local polls can resemble the results of elections to 
the Federal Assembly (Parliament)". 
  Filatov's deputy Sergey Krasavchenko added that there are 
two 
reasons for the fears. 
  The first one is the difficult economic situation in regions 
"which sometimes makes voters support not well-drafted 
programmes, but those who promise to quickly solve all 
problems", he said referring to Zhirinovskiy. 
  The second reason is the split of democratic forces, 
according to Krasavchenko who proposed to introduce the second 
round of elections in the regions to help democrats unite in 
case they face a failure after the first round. 
  He also urged the representatives to control the fulfilment 
of the decisions of the president and the government so that 
people could see that reforms become more socially-oriented.

  [Text] The Russia's Choice [RC] Party in a statement to 
INTERFAX on Monday, said it was in favor of "a viable and 
effective government capable of embracing far-reaching reforms 
and ensuring order and stability in the society." 
  RC denies media speculation that its criticism of the 
government's social and economic measures is caused by its 
abhorrence of the idea of a strong government in Russia. 
  The statement says RC is in favor of reducing the army of 
government bureaucrats and their privilege of distributing 
resources and issue licences and quotas which is the breeding 
ground of iniquities, corruption and bribes. The party spells 
out support for "a small and thrifty state, but for a highly 
professional government." 
  The statement says that is the reason why the RC is opposed 
to the idea of numerous benefits and privileges to members of 
the State Duma and the construction of a new parliament building.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pelts report: "Case of the State Committee for </F>
the State of Emergency: What Orders Did Mikhail Gorbachev 
Give?"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Supreme Court Military 
Collegium has been hearing Marshal Dmitriy Yazov, former USSR 
defense minister, practically all this week. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
has already stressed, the examination of one of the State 
Committee for the State of Emergency's key figures gives rise to 
many questions, and not only from state prosecution 
representatives. 
  Yazov stated the precise number of troops brought into the 
capital and also told of the subunits which were to have 
reinforced this grouping. In his opinion, halting the process 
of the USSR's disintegration was entirely practicable in these 
conditions. Just one small thing was lacking -- plans to 
introduce a state of emergency had to be supported by Mikhail 
Gorbachev. 
  During the examination it also emerged that troops had been 
brought into Moscow even earlier and what is more, Yazov 
stressed, often on Gorbachev's oral instructions. This took 
place three or four times in 1990-1991, as a rule prior to the 
opening of the next Supreme Soviet session and on holidays. The 
president's edict on joint patrolling by Ministry of Internal 
Affairs and Defense Ministry forces served as the basis for this. 
  There is another aspect of the examination which is of no 
mean importance. Yazov stressed that many leaders of former 
Union republics -- Georgia, Lithuania, and Ukraine -- had 
reacted to the State Committee for the State of Emergency 
members' plans "with understanding." True, it is difficult to 
judge how deep and sincere this "understanding" was. Most 
likely the "let's wait and see" principle was operating here. 
  However much the Military Collegium tries to avoid the 
trial's political slant, it nonetheless emerges from time to 
time. Thus, during a recess between sessions (on Thursday) [27 
January] defendant Anatoliy Lukyanov went up to Roman Barsegyan, 
state prosecution representative, and asked him: "Why are you 
participating in this sordid affair and what will happen to you 
after the trial?" Barsegyan regarded this as a blatant attempt 
to put pressure on a prosecutor's office representative, which 
is what he told the court members after the recess. The 
Military Collegium called on all participants in the trial to 
"observe propriety." 
  On Friday the examination of Yazov went on behind closed 
doors, so the press was not allowed into the courtroom. It has 
been ascertained that former USSR KGB Chairman Vladimir 
Kryuchkov also answered questions from the court, state 
prosecution, attorneys, and defendants yesterday. 
  The next session in the case of the State Committee for the 
State of Emergency will take place next Tuesday [1 February].

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Kruglov, prosecutor of the Russian </F>
Federation General Prosecutor's Office Administration for the 
Enforcement of National Security and Interethnic Relations Laws, 
by Sergey Kaverin under the "Only for KURANTY" rubric: 
"Zhirinovskiy Under Probe"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Let us remind our readers that in mid-December 
KURANTY published excerpts from Mr. Zhirinovskiy's election 
speech to naval officers at a party devoted to the 300th 
anniversary of the Russian Navy at the Estrada Theater. On that 
occasion Vladimir Volfovich openly called for "a war to be 
provoked between mountain tribes..." The author of these lines 
witnessed the blood-curdling "revelations." It turned out that 
the "Bersenevskaya [after Bersenevskaya Embankment, location of 
the Estrada Theater] calls" of Russia's chief liberal were not 
the least in bringing a lawsuit against Zhirinovskiy. 
  So, your correspondent met with Viktor Kruglov, prosecutor 
of 
the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office 
Administration for the Enforcement of National Security and 
Interethnic Relations Laws. 
  [Kaverin] Viktor Alekseyevich, how did the "Zhirinovskiy 
case" came about? 
  [Kruglov] Our administration and I personally have been 
dealing with aspects of Zhirinovskiy's political activity that 
are of interest to us. We have focused on four main incidents: 
the well-known ruling by the Third Party Information Court of 
10 December 1993; second, an article in your newspaper; third, 
the incident involving Zhirinovskiy and Gdlyan, which took place 
on the night of 12 and 13 December at the Kremlin Palace of 
Congresses. The last incident is the book "The Last Dash to the 
South," published by Zhirinovskiy. We have considered all the 
facts together. The lawsuit was brought under Article 71 of the 
Russian Federation Criminal Code -- "propaganda of war." The 
decision on bringing a lawsuit was made at the level of the 
Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office leadership. 
  [Kaverin] But was is done at your initiative? 
  [Kruglov] Let us clarify: On the basis of our investigatory 
materials. 
  [Kaverin] What steps will be taken against Zhirinovskiy upon 
his return from abroad? 
  [Kruglov] First, the Russian general prosecutor should 
determine who will investigate the criminal case. Once he makes 
up his mind on that, the division that will be tasked with the 
investigation will resolve all the matters -- of course, 
according to the law. The mechanism of such an investigation is 
well known: Subpoenas, interrogations. The investigation will 
be carried out in full as any investigation of an ordinary 
criminal case. 
  [Kaverin] How will the investigation square with the 
immunity Zhirinovskiy enjoys as a deputy? 
  [Kruglov] According to the new Russian Federation 
Constitution, the status of a Russian Federation State Duma 
deputy is not an obstacle to bringing a lawsuit and 
investigating the case. The Constitution stipulates completely 
clearly and unequivocally that State Duma approval is required 
for arresting a deputy, searching his or her place, or detaining 
him or her. Let me repeat: Arrest, search, and detention. That 
is to say, a criminal lawsuit against a deputy may be brought 
and the case may be investigated according to general rules, and 
only later, depending on the results of the investigation -- if 
reasons for a search, detention, or arrest emerge -- will the 
general prosecutor make a petition to the State Duma requesting 
that this or that deputy be stripped of his immunity on the 
basis of the presented investigation results. Let me recall 
that in accordance with the constitution in force at the time, 
the Supreme Soviet had to be petitioned so as to bring a 
criminal lawsuit itself against the deputy. 
  [Kaverin] Still, Viktor Alekseyevich, let us try to simulate 
the situation: What if, say, Zhirinovskiy does not show up 
under the subpoena. What will he be threatened with in this 
event? 
  [Kruglov] Let us begin by stating that he is obliged to show 
up in the first place. Because until charges are brought 
against him he is technically considered a witness. And he will 
be subpoenaed for questioning precisely in that capacity. If he 
still does not come, the investigator will have to react. 
  [Kaverin] How? What measures are provided for in the law 
for this situation? 
  [Kruglov] An ordinary citizen risks being forcibly brought 
before the court if he does not have good reasons for his 
failure to appear. This is enforced by the militia. But this 
action has an element of enforcement to it, so it can 
effectively be interpreted as a detention -- one of the three 
(!) instances where deputies enjoy immunity. 
  [Kaverin] Then what we have is a closed circle: in order to 
arrest or detain a guilty deputy one needs weighty reasons and 
the State Duma's "OK." But in order to give this "OK" the Duma 
needs facts that the investigation is unable to obtain from the 
deputy... 
  [Kruglov] This is correct, to a certain extent. But you 
should take into account that any criminal case is based not 
only on testimony of the person under investigation. There 
should be some other ideas, materials, documents, witnesses' 
testimonies, evidence produced by expert appraisals. In short, 
we need an objective record. This is why even though a deputy 
may evade giving testimony as a witness, this does not mean that 
a sufficient amount of evidence would not be collected to press 
charges against him. I would like to repeat that all said above 
is only theoretical in nature, but specifically these questions 
concerning the suspect will be decided upon by an investigator. 
The investigator who, under the law, inquires into the case and 
makes all decisions independently. 
  [Kaverin] What is your opinion -- how long will the 
investigation last? 
  [Kruglov] I do not know, this is a complex matter. It 
depends on a huge number of circumstances.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Lysenko, general director of the </F>
All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, by 
Vladimir Zaynetdinov and Valeriy Gorchakov; place and date not 
given: "Evening Call to Anatoliy Lysenko. Is It Becoming 
Quieter on the Screens?"] 
  [Text] It is entirely likely that millions of television 
viewers of the Russian channel may soon be left without their 
favorite serial "Santa Barbara," the "A" program, and live 
relays of sports matches. The volume of television and radio 
broadcasts has been halved -- the Ministry of Finance has cut 
the budget of Russian television by one-half. Anatoliy Lysenko, 
general director of the All-Russia State Television and Radio 
Broadcasting Company, has painted a very gloomy picture. 
  [Lysenko] This year we will need almost 1 trillion rubles 
[R] to be able to work normally. Of this, 77 percent goes 
automatically to the Ministry of Communications to pay for 
broadcasting. The meager funding is liable to cause the loss of 
the broadcasting network on the large territory of Russia. 
Relay transmitters will be closed down. 
  The sum is a large one, and yet this is a political issue 
rather than an economic one. Today television and radio are the 
only links between individual regions in Russia and the center. 
If we come off the air in these regions, then the air space 
will definitely be pulled apart by local television companies. 
The disintegration of the single television air space may mark 
the beginning of territorial disintegration. What about the 
Russian-speaking population in "nearby foreign countries"? For 
example, the Baltic states only relay our channel. There the 
price of communications services is even higher. 
  No one in the government is particularly looking into the 
heart of the matter today. They believe that having "Ostankino" 
will be enough but, after all, even "Ostankino" has had its 
budget cut by 50 percent. With the disappearance of the Russian 
television station, Russian national television as such will 
cease to exist. "Ostankino" is an interstate channel. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Maybe it is worth thinking about 
national commercial television? Independent television! 
  [Lysenko] The idea is a good one, but economically 
impossible today. What commercial structure would pump billions 
into something just like that, with practically zero profit? In 
our country everyone has gotten used to the idea that television 
is free. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What lies in store for the employees 
of the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting 
Company? 
  [Lysenko] Approximately a 40-percent reduction -- primarily 
among the journalists. Televized shows, the most attractive 
programs, will have to be given up -- they are the most 
expensive. We will keep children's broadcasts to the end, and, 
naturally, "Vesti." 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is the solution? 
  [Lysenko] The only thing that can save us is state support. 
But somehow I do not believe we will get any. In the three 
years of our existence there have already been five edicts of 
the Russian Federation president on support to the Russian 
television company, but when it comes down to it, it turns out 
that there is no money. This is frequently stated by people who 
have ratified the latest edict. We have nothing and no one to 
pin our hopes on. Boris Nikolayevich has the last word.

  [Text] Moscow February 1 ITAR-TASS -- The fate of the 
"fourth power" in today's Russia is not enviable, according to 
Mikhail Poltoranin, a man known to be close to President Boris 
Yeltsin, former chief of the Federal Information Centre and 
presently chairman of the Russian State Duma's Information 
Policy Committe. 
  According to him, the lifting of tough state control over 
the 
press does not mean the press is now free, because mafia-like 
structures are all too eager to snatch control over information 
outlets. 
  "Unless the press becomes economically independent, one 
monopolist will only be replaced by another," Poltoranin said. 
  For this reason, demonopolisation of the press is seen by 
him 
as the key issue in the work of the Russian State Duma's 
Information Policy Committee he heads. 
  Poltoranin, who said in an interview published by 
ROSSIISKAYA 
GAZETA today that the committee he is now heading has many ideas 
concerning the demonopolisation of the press, stressed that his 
ultimate goal was to "to deprive all power structures of their 
own pocket information outlets". 
  "All publications must be independent", Poltoranin said, 
"and 
the government should subsidise new publications only during the 
first year of publishing. If authorities want their decrees and 
resolutions to be published, they must sign contracts," 
Poltoranin concluded.

  [Text] In the reshuffled government, the Ministry of 
Health, the Ministry for Protection of the Environment and 
Natural Resources, and the State Committee for Sanitary 
Epidemics Supervision will most probably be overseen by not just 
one vice premier, as was the case before, but by three -- Oleg 
Soskovets, Aleksandr Zaveryukha, and Yuriy Yarov respectively. 
ITAR-TASS correspondents learned this from sources in the 
aforementioned ministries. The closely related problems of 
health, ecology, and sanitary and epidemiological welfare, which 
cannot be solved without constant cooperation, will thus be 
divided into the spheres of influence of the different 
supervisors.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS observer Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- The last date for the 
payment by the state to Russian defence complex enterprises for 
deliveries of arms and military hardware, manufactured according 
to scientific and designing orders over the past one year, has 
expired today. But the dues exceeding one trillion roubles has 
not been credited to the account of the Russian Defence Ministry 
which means the money will not be returned to defence industry 
workers. 
  Without these funds scientific research institutes and 
design 
bureaus will not be in a position to meet the defence supply 
orders for the year 1994 which were approved by the government. 
According to specialists, it will have a negative effect on the 
implementation of the long-term armament programme, the main 
directions and priorities of which were stated by Deputy Defence 
Minister Andrey Kokoshin at a session of the Russian Security 
Council held on December 19 and were approved by President Boris 
Yeltsin. 
  The hopes of the defence industry workers that the current 
year will turn out to be the year of its revival have also not 
come true. For the time being many samples of Russian arms, 
which are considerably superior to similar arms manufactured 
elsewhere in the world, cannot be produced on a large scale due 
to deficit of funds. This not only concerns firearms brought to 
perfection, but also principally new kinds of military hardware, 
in particular, aviation and anti-aircraft rocket complexes and 
means of communications. 
  According to Director General of the Aviation Production 
Amalgamation (Komsomolsk-on-Amur) Anatoliy Petrov, Russia makes 
the best multipurpose interceptor-fighter aircraft "SU-27", but 
not a single aircraft was delivered to the airforce. Fighter 
aircraft in different finishing stages are standing unclaimed on 
the premises of the plant. 
  The same fate awaits other kinds of military hardware, 
including invisible to radar low-flying interceptor "MIG-31", 
fire-support (tank destroyer) "KA-50" helicopter, well-known as 
"Black Shark" and possessing tremendous flying capabilities for 
its class bomber "TU- 22M", according to specialists. 
  In order not to become an outsider tomorrow, Russian 
armourers have to find non-traditional ways to perfect their 
production. But they need support, first of all financial.

"Central Bank Has Reserves to Control Ruble Exchange Rate"] 
  [Text] "The Central Bank of Russia has sufficient foreign 
currency reserves to enable it, even in the current situation, 
to control the ruble's movements against the dollar," Aleksandr 
Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, has 
stated. 
  The Central Bank of Russia has recently spent around $1 
billion to stabilize the ruble. The bank created its foreign 
currency reserves largely thanks to its vigorous purchases of 
foreign currency last year. According to preliminary Central 
Bank of Russia estimates, the surge of inflation in January 1994 
reached approximately 20-25 percent.

  [Text] The Central Bank of Russia [CBR] does not plan a 
large-scale emission to cover the budget deficit in the first 
three months of 1994, Interfax was told Monday by the Bank's 
Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Khandruyev. 
  The deficit for the first three months is yet unknown, but 
the sum of Rbs 24,600 cited by some sources is too high, 
Interfax was told Monday by another source in the Central Bank. 
  The Finance Ministry has said that the figure does not 
correspond to the real state of affairs. The source says that 
it is necessary to wait for the government's budget message 
which will specify figures. 
  Earlier Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was expected to 
make a report to the Federation Council on the country's budget 
for 1994. However, speaker Vladimir Shumeyko told deputies that 
the report had been postponed. 
  On February 18 President Yeltsin is expected to speak before 
parliament on the social and economic development of Russia. In 
view of this, Chernomyrdin is likely to specify some provisions 
of his report with account of the presidential address. 
  Before the end of 1993 the Central Bank bought at the 
Finance 
Ministry precious metals and stones to the sum of Rbs 6800 Bn 
rubles which have been spent to cover the budget deficit, 
Interfax was told by a spokesman for the Central Bank. 
  The meeting of the government commission on credit policies 
that took place early last week decided to pay to grain 
producers. The meeting attended also by the former Finance 
Minister Boris Fedorov, chairman of the State Property 
Management Committee Anatoliy Chubays, the Central Bank's Deputy 
Chairman Tatyana Paramonova decided to set aside for the purpose 
some Rbs 3000 Bn.

<F P=106> [Otto Latsis article: "Russia's Economy Was En Route to </F>
Stabilization During Government Shake-Up. Next Few Months Will 
Tell Whether It Will Prove Possible To Continue This Route"] 
  [Text] The Russian State Committee for Statistics 
[Goskomstat] has announced the main statistics for the country's 
socioeconomic position in 1993. They indicate that the general 
slump has not been halted, but is slowing down and gradually 
assuming a structured nature. The decline has been stopped in 
some important areas, but there is no growth as yet and the 
stabilization is hardly reliable. Growth has begun in some 
spheres, but the precrisis high has by no means been attained as 
yet. 

<H5>    Enigmatic and Not So Enigmatic Figures </H5>
  GDP dropped 12 percent on last year's level when it in turn 
fell 19 percent. In other words, the decline has slowed, but it 
is still considerable. At the same time the structure of GDP 
use has improved in some respects. The proportion of spending 
on final national consumption rose from 53.6 percent of total 
GDP use in 1992 to 57.8 percent in 1993. Spending on domestic 
consumption totaled 40.5 percent of GDP against 35.9 percent in 
1992. The proportion of gross accumulation of fixed capital, 
along with the proportion of net exports (minus imports) 
remained virtually unchanged. 
  What has changed, how has consumption risen? The growth in 
material working capital dropped dramatically from 11.6 percent 
of GDP in 1992 to 5.3 percent in 1993. In the main this is 
attributable to the dramatic reduction in material working 
capital within production stocks. 
  The reduction in stocks at certain enterprises may have been 
excessive. But this process is by and large beneficial. 
Remember that in the early eighties economists spoke with 
growing disquiet of the excessive growth of stocks. At that 
time economic growth was in actual fact a sham: The entire 
growth in social production was used to increase stocks that 
were lying idle. Now the process has been reversed: The real 
decline in social consumption is less than the slump in 
production -- owing to the reduction in stocks. 
  That is to a considerable extent the reason for what at 
first 
glance seem enigmatic figures. Thus, notwithstanding the slump 
in production, the population's real monetary income was 9 
percent up on the previous year. Admittedly, that is still only 
57 percent of the 1991 level, since there was a sharp decline of 
almost 50 percent in 1992. But nonetheless recovery has begun. 
Total commodity turnover was 102 percent of the 1992 level and 
99 percent of the 1991 figures. Total exports were 101.4 
percent and 84 percent of the 1992 and 1991 levels respectively. 
At the same time exports were 16 billion [rubles] ahead of 
imports (it is hard to remember anything like that happening in 
our history). 
  And here are some more figures. 
  The number of people with income below the minimum 
subsistence level in December 1993 was 3.7 percent up on 
December 1992, totaling 39.6 million, or over one-fourth of the 
entire population. The consolidated consumer price index rose 
9.4-fold in 1993 as opposed to 26-fold in 1992, and has thus 
risen 245-fold in two years. If you remember that the index 
also rose 2.6-fold in 1991, in three years there has been more 
than a 600-fold rise. At the same time in December the average 
wage was 130,000 rubles [R], an 8.1-fold increase last year and 
a 109-fold increase in the past two years -- less than one-half 
the price rises since liberalization. 
  By the end of the year over 24,000 kolkhozes and sovkhozes 
(95 percent of the total) had reregistered. One-third of them 
decided to retain their former status. Moreover, 11,500 varying 
companies, around 300 open-type joint-stock companies, 400 
enterprise subsidiary farms, and 2,000 agricultural cooperatives 
have been set up based on kolkhozes and sovkhozes. Some 87,000 
private farms have appeared in a year: As of 1 January 1994 
there were 270,000 of them in Russia (with an average land area 
of 42 hectares per farm). Agricultural production in the public 
sector is on the decline, but it is on the increase in the 
individual sector and this is making it possible to slow down or 
halt entirely the slump in the production of certain foodstuffs. 
Coupled with the sharp increase in the population's 
horticultural and truck garden activity, the urban population 
included, this ensured a noticeable increase in consumption of 
all basic foodstuffs, apart from fish products, in 1993. The 
1991 level has been regained and even exceeded in a number of 
areas. All this is particularly impressive if you bear in mind 
that imports of grain (and meat and sugar) were cut drastically 
in 1993 for the first time in many years and at the same time 
reliable grain stocks were set up before the new harvest. There 
can be no recurrence today of the situation in early 1992, when 
the population's grain supply was directly dependent on the 
arrival of the latest grain shipments from the United States. 
  Nevertheless, agriculture is in an extremely grave position. 
Prices of agricultural equipment, fuel, and fertilizers are 
rising far more rapidly than prices of agricultural produce. 
The profitability of crop farming produce dropped from 211 
percent in 1992 to 92 percent in 1993 and thus remains 
extraordinarily high. The profitability of livestock produce, 
which dropped from 42 to 15 percent respectively, could have 
been deemed adequate had it not been shored up by subsidies. 
Wool production was unprofitable even with subsidies, which 
promoted a reduction in the sheep and goat herd. 
  There was an unequivocal deterioration in the state of trade 
and the consumer market. In 1992 the retail trade's foodstuff 
availability coefficient was around 50 percent and the nonfood 
commodity availability coefficient 70 percent (an immeasurable 
improvement on the empty stores of 1991) and in 1993 the figures 
were 60-70 and 80-90 percent respectively. All efficiency 
indicators were considerably higher in private trade than in 
state trading outlets. After the slump of 1991-1992 consumption 
of nonfood commodities rose once again. 
  As for the market in technical and production output, one 
conclusion from the Goskomstat report is simply worth citing: 
"In 1993 there was no problem with shortages of resources. The 
main condition determining enterprise and organization 
procurement was their effective demand." 

<H5>    Will Industry Be Able To Restructure Itself? </H5>
  Foreign trade results are extremely conflicting. The 
sizeable surplus balance of trade represents an undoubted 
success, but it has cost us too dear and is hardly a long-term 
phenomenon. It is only the reduction in grain imports, which 
provided $1 billion out of a total surplus of $16 billion, that 
is undoubtedly beneficial and effective for the country. The 
reduction -- by 50 percent -- in imports of machinery and 
equipment, providing a "saving" of around $7 billion, and 
medicine (by almost 75 percent compared with the previous year) 
is not at all beneficial. 
  The already backward export structure deteriorated still 
further. We are buying fewer machines and equipment, but on the 
other hand exports of crude oil, petroleum products, gas, coal, 
iron ore, ammonia, cast iron, and aluminum, in other words 
nonreproducible natural resources that involve a low degree of 
processing and correspondingly low revenue rose considerably. 
The worst thing is that last year average export prices of 
Russian oil, petroleum products, gas, coal, iron ore, cast iron, 
and aluminum fell. While the extraction and transportation 
costs of all these commodities are rising rapidly. 
  In many cases it was still profitable for enterpries to 
export these products only because of the drastically low ruble 
rate of exchange and what were until recently low transportation 
costs. Now transportation rates are close to real expenditure 
on transportation and the ruble rate of exchange, although still 
very low, has nonetheless fallen considerably slower than prices 
on the domestic market have risen. In effect although the 
artificial export incentives have survived, they are appreciably 
weaker and the profitability of exporting aluminum ingots, round 
timber, and coal is already in question. Oil exports will also 
be in jeopardy in the future. 
  The question in effect is whether Russian industry will be 
able to restructure itself to export primarily machinery and 
equipment and other commodities with a high degree of processing 
before the favorable, but short-lived market situation 
disappears and thus maintain an active trade balance. Our only 
salvation lies in boosting the competitiveness of Russian goods. 
Regrettably, the industrial lobby and the government, which is 
obviously succumbing to pressure from the former, are still 
taking a different direction. The Russian market is being 
closed to foreign commodities by incredibly high duties. Thus 
the population is being made to pay for the monopolism and the 
backwardness of Russian industry, and that industry is doomed to 
lag forever behind its rivals. If it does not learn to 
withstand foreign competition at home, much less will it have a 
chance of conquering these rivals on other countries' bleak 
markets. 

<H5>    Response to Critics of Monetarism </H5>
  This example is just one of many that make one think about 
the choice of course now being made deep within the government. 
Primarily the choice of an economic policy in its most general 
form. The main position that has been repeatedly stated over 
the last few years by government leaders is this: We will 
operate not only by monetarist methods. This should be 
investigated more carefully since I think that both the 
supporters of this policy and its critics are guilty of 
inaccuracies. 
  When it said that there are microeconomic instruments as 
well 
as monetarist macroeconomic instruments, this idea is for some 
reason put forward as a reproof to the monetarists. But no one 
can after all claim that macroeconomic levers, above all setting 
state finances to rights, are not necessary. I think that few 
people would also dare to say that microeconomic actions can be 
successful without setting the microeconomy to rights. Everyone 
realises that both are necessary. But it is not those countless 
sectoral department officials who have done nothing to 
streamline the microeconomic structure who are presented as 
being to blame for the economy's hitherto untreated ills, but 
those who are making abortive attempts to bring about 
macroeconomic stabilization. It is the finance minister's 
business to watch over the state budget and other departments 
should deal with each enterprises. 
  However, critics of monetarism in the sectoral lobby are 
sincerely convinced that they are right. Many of them think 
that the Finance Ministry's "miserliness" is to blame for 
everything: If it were to give us state money to our heart's 
content, we would sort everything out. One can perhaps thank 
fate that the state purse is no longer big enough for everyone 
to take their fill -- otherwise spendthrift production units 
would continue ad infinitum. No, activity at microeconomic 
level can be successful not despite but only on the basis of 
monetarist policy. 
  If commitment to the old habits persists, what the premier 
said -- "not only by monetarist methods" -- may indeed entail a 
return to the long since compromised administration by decree. 
With a competent market approach it is quite possible to 
combine the two avenues in the state's economic activity. On 
the one hand, a return to regulating prices and rates of 
exchange, to ceilings and quotas, and broadening subsidies and 
preferential loans will do no good. On the other, the state can 
help step up enterprises' market activity. 
  Nonmonetarist activity by the state is a possibility. But on 
one condition: Provided that it does not contravene, but rests 
on monetarist policy, and utilizes its fruits. Only when the 
means of arriving at this kind of combination have been found, 
when people have ceased reducing the task to the slowing down of 
financial stabilization, will one be able to believe that our 
state is indeed committed to the reform course.

  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev have agreed on the need to withdraw warships from 
Kronshtadt, a Russian naval stronghold since the 18th century, 
Mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak told Interfax. 
  Governor of Kronshtadt Viktor Surikov gave two reasons to 
explain the move. 
  On the one hand, part of the warships appear to find 
themselves in a trap after the construction of a dam in the Bay 
of Finland left them with only one outlet to the Baltic Sea. 
  On the other, there are plans to promote tourist business 
following a decision to set up a Free Economic Zone [FEZ] in 
Kronshtadt whose status of a closed city hampers the project. 
  The FEZ project provides for the construction of a sea port 
at Kronshtadt with an annual capacity of 8.5 Mn tons to be 
increased to 12-13 Mn tons later which can bring about $15 Mn in 
annual revenues. 
  The local authorities are also keen to re-commission a 
facility for cleaning oil-containing waste dumped secretly by 
Russian and foreign ships in the Baltic Sea. The withdrawal of 
Russian warships from Kronshtadt will be taken in stages. 
  In the meantime, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is expected 
to visit the base in mid-February to discuss all problems in 
detail. It is not ruled out that the Russian Navy may deploy its 
own training center and ships at Kronshtadt to train navy 
personnel for Russia and other countries. 
  Russian units deployed at the Leningrad navy base are 
expected to be redeployed at the town of Primorsk and elsewhere. 
  A special working group including officials of the Defence 
Ministry, Navy, Leningrad navy base and the administration of 
St. Petersburg and Kronshtadt will meet to discuss the schedule 
of the Navy's withdrawal from the Kotlin Island.

<F P=106> [Report by Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Stepanov of the </F>
Ground Forces Press Center: "Alarming Housing Situation"] 
  [Text] The state of and prospects for work to sell 
released military property and practical measures to maintain 
law and order and military discipline among troops were 
discussed at a Ground Forces Military Council session 27 January 
this year. 
  It was noted there that last year there were great hopes for 
increased social protection for servicemen, and in particular 
for at least a partial solution to the housing problem, thanks 
to the possibility of using High Command resources, which it was 
intended to obtain by selling released military property. But 
rampant inflation, bureaucracy, and payment delays reduced the 
results of this work to virtually nothing. People lost interest 
in it. In addition, the Ground Forces are the only branch of 
the Russian Federation Armed Forces not to receive 20 percent of 
the money earned from the sale of military property, to which it 
is entitled under a defense minister's order. This is at a time 
when a most alarming situation regarding the provision of 
housing for servicemen is being noted right here. The families 
of officers and warrant officers have been waiting no less than 
five to seven years to receive apartments. Thus, there are now 
over 200 officers without apartments in the High Command 
apparatus. 
  It is therefore no accident that the second of the questions 
discussed was considered closely with the social aspect. An 
officer without an apartment, who feels that he is not shown 
respect by the state and society and who has extremely limited 
material means is hardly likely to be in a position to 
unreservedly give his all to the service. Can he really be 
expected to take resolute action to strengthen military 
discipline and law and order in a subordinate unit or subunit if 
he himself is experiencing an infringement of his civil rights? 
  The results of the Military Council session were summed up 
by 
Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of Ground 
Forces.

  [Text] Moscow, 31 Jan -- One in 10 Russian border guards 
among the rank and file and the sergeants is now on contract 
service. This way of building up border troops in Russia's 
federal border service is regarded as promising and makes it 
possible to resolve the personnel shortage to a considerable 
extent. By the end of this year, one in four, and in another 
year, one in two Russian border guards will be on contract 
service, an ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the press 
service of the Russian border troops. 
  It is justifiable to stake on building up border troops on a 
contract basis, it is believed here. Those on contract service 
are distinguished by endurance, good discipline, and 
professionalism. If before they used to be sent to logistics 
subunits, nowadays they are entrusted with the main posts of 
junior commanders and service in leading specialities. 
  According to the press service, contract servicemen are 
eager 
to go to "hot spots." They regard service at the outer borders 
of CIS states as prestigious and in line with Russia's national 
interests. 
  According to the same source, women, too, have been enlisted 
in border guard service of late. There are 2,500 women in 
Russian border troops now.

  [Text] Moscow, 31 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- The Federation Council 
approved the Russian president's decree on extending the state 
of emergency by two months in the conflict zone on the 
territories of Ingushetia and North Ossetia. This was reported 
by Aleksandr Dzasokhov, State Duma deputy from North Ossetia, 
who is attending the Federation Council for the discussion of 
this issue. 
  Aleksandr Dzasokhov reported that "the Federation Council 
set 
up a special commission which within 24 hours is to work out 
measures for stabilizing the situation in the conflict zone." 
In the deputy's personal opinion, "in order to settle the 
conflict the leaders of the two republics should, above all, 
increase their role in the settlement of the conflict by dint of 
their own personal capabilities with the participation of the 
Provisional Administration of the conflict zone." 
  The closed session of the Federation Council continues.

  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- The Federation Council, 
the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament, failed to elect the 
third deputy speaker on Monday. 
  Chamber Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko has two deputies and one 
post remains vacant. Shumeyko nominated two candidates for the 
post -- head of Voronezh region administration Aleksandr Kovalev 
and Chairman of the regional council of the Leningrad region 
Vadim Gustov. The region retained the old name in contrast to 
the administrative centre which was renamed into St. Petersburg. 
  However, Kovalev refused to run for the post, while Gustov 
lacked 15 votes to become deputy speaker. 71 lawmakers 
supported him instead of the necessary minimum of 86.

  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- The State Duma has 
prepared a draft declaration on making the Federal Assembly a 
legal successor to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation 
in the field of lawmaking. 
  When explaining the meaning of the document, Vladimir 
Isakov, 
chairman of the State Duma's committee for lawmaking and court 
and legal reform, said that "the chain of lawmaking has been 
broken". 
  "There are facts when non-legislative bodies cancelled or 
suspended the laws, which disorganizes the work of the legal 
system," he said. 
  The declaration is called on to put an end to these negative 
developments and designate the principles of legal continuity. 
  According to Mikhail Mityukov, deputy chairman of the State 
Duma, individual provisions of the draft still "need to be 
substantially elaborated".

  [Text] The Russian State Duma's Legislation Committee has 
drafted a declaration on the Federal Assembly being the legal 
successor of the preceding parliament. The draft will be 
discussed by the party groups and committees, the Committee 
Chairman Vladimir Isakov told Interfax. 
  The need for this document, which he described as political, 
is dictated, he said, by the legal situation in which the 
country's president decrees "cancellation, amendment, or 
suspension of Russia's legislation" and "it is not clear what is 
the chief legislative body." 
  Isakov said that the original draft had been made by the 
Agrarian Party, which he heads, and discussed by the Legislation 
Committee. 
  The first plenary session of the lower house this week will 
be held Wednesday, February 2. Isakov believes the State Duma 
will discuss the structure of its machinery and a bill on the 
procedure for publication of federal acts and constitutional 
acts. 
  He doubted that the full lower house would be able to debate 
legislation on the Constitutional Court any time soon, even 
though it had been drafted. He thought that the draft would be 
thoroughly debated by parliamentary groups and committees 
because its significance was "political."

  [Text] U.S. Treasury Secretary L. Bentsen has stated that 
Moscow's abandonment or slowing of the course of reforms will 
inevitably lead to a scaling down of the volume of foreign aid 
offered to it. 
  "Russia's future is in the Russians' hands," he remarked at 
a 
meeting with journalists in the White House. "The assistance 
which we and international financial organizations are giving 
will match the pace of the Russian reforms, which means that the 
choice is Russia's."

<F P=106> [Yelena Ovcharenko article: "One Good Turn Deserves </F>
Another"] 
  [Text] It was back in Moscow that the "first warning 
signal" was sounded. When the U.S. President came to our city, 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen briefed the U.S. press 
traveling with Clinton and said: If the rate of inflation in 
Russia remains just as crazy, I am afraid that there will be a 
question mark over aid from across the ocean. 
  Quite little time has elapsed, and already the question of 
aid has moved to quite a different level. I will remark, 
however, that for those few days when the stir over Fedorov's 
resignation was continuing, informed sources were saying: 
America wants to see him as an "active player" and even 
allegedly links the granting of aid with specific personalities. 
  To judge from the move which Lee Hamilton, chairman of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. Congress, made 
recently, this really is so. Addressing the committee, he 
declared the following: "Although I support aid for Russia and 
am convinced of the need to give it, I will find it very hard to 
say 'yes' to economic aid for Russia if the Central Bank 
generously issues credits to large state enterprises in a few 
months' time. If the Central Bank does not take tough measures 
against inflation, it will escalate into hyperinflation and 
reduce to naught all the efforts to assist Russia." 
  The competence of the trans-Atlantic legislators and their 
desire to participate in the long-standing litigation between 
the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance are undoubtedly 
pleasant. [sentence as published] America's displeasure at the 
fact that the new Russian Government consists of "conservatives" 
is also obvious. 
  Maybe it is not worthwhile to pull the wool over everyone's 
eyes: In allocating money, the U.S. Congress and Administration 
themselves then put the brakes on it, falling short in their 
gifts and payments. On the other hand, they lobby ardently for 
politicians whom they love dearly. How can we disagree with 
Vladimir Petrovich Lukin, who, having quit his ambassadorial 
post in Washington, has already spoken out with no allowances 
for diplomatic protocol: The Americans should refrain from 
commenting on the composition of the government being formed. 
  It is indecent to exert such pressure, particularly as "not 
everything is paid for." During his visit to Moscow, Bill 
Clinton tried to persuade the Russians that he had "come as a 
friend," not as a mentor. Evidently impressed by these words, 
our president relaxed and failed to give him instructions to be 
passed on to the Congress as to who should be approved as 
secretary of defense -- after all, Perry advocates the 
preservation of major military programs....

  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- The nuclear power 
engineering industry of Russia will get almost absolutely safe 
reactor for its nuclear power stations by 2004, this ultimate 
target has been approved by the state programme of the 
Government of Russia, for the implementation of which dozens of 
leading institutes and scientific centres of the Academy of 
Sciences, Ministry of Atomic Energy and Ministry of Science have 
joined forces. 
  The new reactor has been named as a hybrid one, since its 
system will be an amalgamation of the nuclear and thermonuclear 
subsystem, chief scientific research supervisor, academician and 
Nobel prize laureate Nikolay Basov told ITAR-TASS. According to 
the scientist, "only this union of ideas" can guarantee the 
complete safety of the nuclear installation. 
  The Russian project of nuclear power engineering of the XXI 
century has passed all-round expertise in scientific centres of 
Russia. Experts of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) have especially noted the original technology of the use 
of laser source of neutrons in the future reactor. 
  Foreign colleagues, according to academician Basov, have 
highly appreciated the degree of burning out of nuclear fuel and 
the possibility of using different kinds of nuclear fuels in the 
nuclear-thermonuclear reactor, including uranium of natural 
isotope composition. Thus a possibility of the efficient use of 
spent radioactive waste has been opened up, which is quite 
important for Russia in its conditions of the destruction of 
nuclear weapons.

  [Excerpts] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has held his 
first news conference. Mykola Polonskyy has the story: 
[passage omitted] Yuriy Meshkov read out a statement expressing 
his readiness to cooperate with all political forces and 
economic structures since the elections. Having almost 1 
million Crimeans, 72 percent of the adult population, supporting 
his candidacy demonstrates, in the president's opinion, the 
great unity of the peninsula's population that now forms a 
single people. Crimea, in his words, can become a bridge of 
friendship between Ukraine and Russia. 
  It was relations between the young republic and these states 
that raised many questions from journalists. A question was 
raised on a referendum on the status of Crimea. Yuriy Meshkov 
confirmed his resolve strictly to comply with the letter of the 
law. His principal aim, however, is the economic well-being of 
the Crimeans, while all the rest is secondary. In other words, 
the question of the Crimea either seceding from Ukraine and 
developing as an independent state or not, virtually remained 
unanswered. 
  Obviously, reality compels Yuriy Meshkov not to hurry 
secession, for the economic situation in Crimea is complex, so 
much so that even a thought of the republic surviving 
independently is absurd. 
  As for Russia, the president only spoke about the need to 
restore and strengthen economic relations with it. The news 
conference somehow did not discuss the integration of Crimea in 
the Russian ruble zone, which so far has been regarded as a 
panacea for every trouble. [passage omitted] 
  Meshkov told journalists that he would not take steps 
drastically different from the previous course and that he would 
not undertake substantial structural changes and replacements in 
power structures. In other words, everything will remain 
unchanged. But if so, how can the Crimeans expect any 
improvement in their well-being and living standards? 
Unfortunately, journalists did not hear the Crimean president's 
specific proposals or concrete ideas in this respect.

<F P=106> [Report by Uladzimir Hlod and Larisa Lazar: "What Were News </F>
Conferences About? Stanislav Shushkevich Has Never Stood Up for 
His Position Until the End. This Is His Political Drama."] 
  [Text] People's Deputy Viktar Hanchar commented on 
Stanislav Shushkevich's dismissal from the position of the 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman as follows: "The political 
drama of Shushkevich-politician will be realized later." He, 
along with People's Deputies Alyaksandr Lukashenka and Dzmitri 
Bulakhaw, held a news conference after the results of the secret 
ballot became known to the audience. Formally, Stanislav 
Shushkevich was accused of "not taking measures to fight 
corruption, lack of control over law enforcement organs, and 
personal immodesty," however, in fact, this was only a formal 
pretext for his recall, the organizers of the news conference 
stated. 
  "We admit that deputies have long wished to discharge 
Shushkevich and have looked for some formal pretexts to do so. 
Therefore, the legislature raised the issue of recalling 
Shushkevich from his post four times already," said Viktar 
Hanchar. 
  According to the people's deputies, Shushkevich's primary 
mistake was that he did not follow a steady political course. 
Despite his claim that he subordinates to the will of the 
legislative majority (represented by left wing deputies), the 
former Supreme Soviet chairman did not advocate their ideas. In 
his last speech, Stanislav Shushkevich also renounced his 
political union with the opposition faction, though this group 
of deputies supported him. As a result, Shushkevich-politician 
remained alone. 
  In the opinion of the people's deputies, the tragedy of 
Shushkevich lies in the fact that he has never stood up for the 
most important issues -- holding a referendum and early Supreme 
Soviet elections, signing a collective security agreement, etc. 
-- until the end. 
  How will Shushkevich's dismissal affect the activity of the 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet? In the opinion of the organizers of 
this news conference, the stage of political conflicts in the 
Supreme Soviet is over, and the time for organized work has 
arrived. 
  Well, will Shushkevich's resignation change the political 
course of the Belarusian legislature? 
  The people's deputies were unanimous: No, this will not 
happen; simply the left wing deputies will elect their new 
leader, and we could make some prognosis based on the behavior 
of the people's deputies.....

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "U.S. Ready To Cooperate With </F>
Latvia in the Field of Security"] 
  [Text] Riga, 24 Jan -- Today, a U.S. delegation arrived in 
Latvia to discuss the possibilities of American and Latvian 
cooperation in the military and security field, informed the 
press center of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is 
said that the United States has a special foundation for 
cooperation with different countries in this field. 
  Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs George Andrejevs and 
Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis took part in the meeting, 
where the NATO cooperation program "Partnership for Peace" was 
also discussed. G. Andrejevs confirmed Latvia's readiness to 
participate in this program; there is already a group of 
specialists prepared to begin work on this program. U.S. 
representatives have expressed the view that the "Partnership 
for Peace" program might stimulate mutual cooperation among the 
Baltic States in the field of security, and have advised Latvia 
to participate in joint military maneuvers in 1994 in the 
framework of this program. 
  Both Latvian ministers acquainted their guests with the main 
points of the Latvian security concept. A. Andrejevs expressed 
anxiety concerning Latvia's security during the Skrunda radar 
station activities, which could cause various misunderstandings 
and incidents. The U.S. side responded that in the event of 
danger Latvia can consult NATO, taking advantage of "Partnership 
for Peace." The head of the U.S. delegation explained that 
America understands Latvia's anxiety in regard to its safety, 
and therefore contacts for mutual cooperation are being 
established. In addition, the United States is interested in 
long term cooperation with Latvia. 
  V. Pavlovskis spoke about financial problems in the defense 
forces. The U.S. delegation said that limited financial support 
can also be expected from NATO. This organization could, in the 
future, support the Latvian mission and cover expenses of joint 
military maneuvers.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Algirdas Brazauskas by Pierre </F>
Lefevre; place and date not given: "Algirdas Brazauskas on 
Partnership For Peace, Russian Designs, the Baltic Countries, 
and Instability in Belarus"] 
  [Text] [Lefevre] By signing your membership in the 
Partnership for Peace this Thursday at NATO, you expressed your 
wish to become a full member of the Atlantic organization. Do 
you not fear that this will give rise to a feeling of isolation 
in Russia? 
  [Brazauskas] I thought of that, and while expressing this 
wish I clearly underlined that our approach was in no way an act 
of hostility or enmity toward Russia -- especially since the 
Partnership for Peace program allows anyone to participate who 
wants to. This possibility is valid for Russia and for all the 
other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. It is 
a peace program which aims to establish peace by any means 
possible. It is a concrete formula of collaboration that is not 
restricted to statements in favor of peace, but which offers 
concrete collaboration with a view to building up this peace. 
Those who think, on the other hand, in terms of blocs, of 
hostility, of creating dissent, are those who are expressing 
relics of the Cold War. 
  [Lefevre] Have you not gotten the impression that Moscow was 
vetoing the membership of the countries of Central and Eastern 
Europe in NATO? 
  [Brazauskas] To veto something you must first be entitled to 
do so. Moscow has certainly expressed clear opinions on this 
matter, but I think that this partnership program is going to 
continue developing, that a growing number of countries are 
going to join it, and that even Moscow will come around to it 
little by little -- especially since the partnership program is 
in no way an offensive system. Indeed, it is a system of 
exchange, of consultation, of common learning, and of jointly 
perfecting a number of mechanisms that must work on behalf of 
peace. 
<H5>  Kozyrev: Rhetoric that Harms Relations Between Countries </H5>
  [Lefevre] Do you think that the United States will one day 
give Lithuania and the Baltic countries the full security 
guarantee of the North Atlantic Treaty, and by when? 
  [Brazauskas] It would be incredibly thoughtless of me to 
suggest confirmation of this or any dates. All I can say is 
that this partnership and consultation mechanism will develop 
and will mature on its own. 
  [Lefevre] What do you think of the recent rhetoric of 
Russian 
Minister Kozyrev, who called the Baltic countries areas of 
special interest for Russia? 
  [Brazauskas] This kind of abstract rhetoric never 
contributes 
anything. All it does is create confusion and damage relations 
between countries. We are a sovereign, independent country and 
a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe. We 
also hope to enter the European Union. What does this kind of 
rhetoric mean? What gives them the right to make it and what 
might its scope be? We signed agreements with Russia on a whole 
series of problems. Take, for example, the withdrawal of the 
Russian Army, which has now left Lithuanian territory, or the 
matter of ethnic minorities. We have a Russian minority, the 
vast majority of which, took Lithuanian citizenship when it was 
given the opportunity to do so. 
  Of course there are still some major problems to be resolved 
and we are continuing the negotiations with the hope that we can 
resolve them one by one. Naturally, there is the matter of the 
territory of Kalingrad, which is part of Russia, but which is 
cut off from it. We understand that Russia has interests there 
and we are continuing the negotiations with the Russians with 
regard to this territory. As for Mr. Kozyrev's rhetoric, he did 
not say what interests they were. If there are Russian 
interests in Lithuania, they must be defined and we will carry 
out negotiations on them like we are doing with the other 
issues. Whether it is a big or a small country, we must all 
live according to the same legal rules and apply them in all 
circumstances. 
  [Lefevre] After the December elections in Russia, and the 
recomposition of the Moscow Government, should we expect a 
tougher line in Russian foreign policy? 
  [Brazauskas] I do not think so. Anyway, relations between 
countries are never a constant. They change; there are ups and 
downs. 
  [Lefevre] The Estonian prime minister recently wrote that 
the 
Russians must not be treated like spoiled children by sheltering 
them from blame. Otherwise they will grow up into arrogant and 
tyrannical adults. Do you share this point of view? 
  [Brazauskas] It is for similar reasons that I say that the 
legal rules and their application must be the same for all the 
countries, whether it is Lithuania, the United States, 
Luxembourg, or Russia. 
  [Lefevre] In view of recent developments in Russia, do you 
think that it needs less shock and more therapy, as Mr. Strobe 
Talbott said? 
  [Brazauskas] The therapy is still needed. I think that the 
negotiations between the countries and the way of fixing their 
relations via these negotiations are actually therapeutic acts. 
I do not believe in shock therapy or in therapeutic shocks, 
neither in international relations nor in the domestic policy of 
a country. 

<H3>    Belarus: Something To Do with the Extradition of 
Communists </H3>
  [Lefevre] How do you interpret the dismissal of Belarus 
President Shushkevich by a communist dominated parliament? 
  [Brazauskas] Every country has its own problems. The 
situation in Belarus took a long time to come to fruition. This 
also has something to do with the agreement concluded between 
Belarus and Lithuania, which led to the extradition of the 
leaders of the Lithuanian Communist Party, who are now accused 
of serious crimes and being tried. We have a legal cooperation 
treaty with Belarus and, in accordance with this treaty, we have 
handed over a number of Belarus citizens who were killers and we 
have asked for the extradition on criminal charges of Mr. 
Burokevicius, who was the first secretary of the Communist Party 
faithful to Moscow as well as Mr. Jermalavicius, who was the 
party ideologue (these two officials, who were hostile to 
Lithuanian independence, are considered by Vilnius to be 
responsible for confrontations during which Soviet troops killed 
14 people near the radio and television building in January 1991 
-- LE SOIR editor's note). We are entitled to demand that these 
criminals be handed over to us and that is what was done. The 
Belarus Parliament expressed a different opinion and contested 
the extradition. Nevertheless, as a neighboring state, we 
intend to continue maintaining good relations with Belarus. 
  [Lefevre] Does this mean we are witnessing a sort of 
pro-communist revanchism in Belarus? 
  [Brazauskas] No. I would not use those terms. However, 
political relations in Parliament are indeed different in our 
country. 
<H5>  Europe: Our Wish Is Obvious </H5>
  [Lefevre] How do you assess the welcome which the European 
Union has given to Lithuania? 
  [Brazauskas] We were welcomed very well indeed. Our wish is 
obvious. We want to draw closer to the European Union as fast 
as possible. 
  [Lefevre] Are you satisfied following the talks you recently 
had with [European Commission President] Jacques Delors? 
  [Brazauskas] For the moment we are demanding to join the 
European Union so it is hard for us to ask questions. We can 
only express our wishes.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 31, BNS -- Alexander Gusev, an adviser 
to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, visited on Jan. 
27 the fuel terminals the Russian Army owns in Estonia. 
  The delegation he led met with representatives of the 
Scantrans and the Lukoil ES companies and toured the terminals 
situated in Viimsi on the outskirts of the Estonian capital and 
on Kopli Peninsula. 
  A specialist at Scantrans, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, confirmed in an interview with BNS that a delegation 
visited Estonia; he couldn't say, however, who its members were. 
  The Russian fuel terminals will probably be handed over to 
Estonia before May and placed under the Defense Ministry, the 
Scantrans specialist said. Handover deadlines, however, are 
pending negotiations, he added. 
  The Scantrans official dismissed speculations that one of 
the 
aims of the delegation's visit to Estonia was to determine the 
companies to which Russia is prepared to sell the terminals. 
  The underground terminal in Viimsi has a capacity of about 
47,000 cubic meters, and the capacity of the overground terminal 
is 20,000 cubic meters.

  [Text] Tbilisi February 1 TASS -- Georgian Defence Minister 
Georgiy Karkarashvili offered to resign on Tuesday, two days 
before Russian President Boris Yeltsin is to visit Georgia and 
sign a bilateral military-political treaty. 
  The resignation offer published by the Tbilisi-based 
"IBERIA-EXPRESS" newspaper today was confirmed to TASS by 
officials in the Defence Ministry who failed to provide 
explanations on the reasons of the resignation. 
  The press service of Eduard Shevardnadze also refused to 
give 
any comments. 
  Karkarashvili, 28, is the symbol of the national-liberation 
movement. A former Soviet Army captain, he fought in 
Afghanistan and was one of the founders of the Georgian Armed 
Forces. 
  He participated in the ouster of late President Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia, fought in rebel Georgian regions of South Ossetia 
and Abkhazia. 
  Karkarashvili replaced Tengiz Kitovani as defence minister 
after a major military defeat near Gagra in Abkhazia. 
  He was the defence minister when Georgia lost the war to 
Abkhazia.

North Ossetia and Ingushetia, which was approved Monday by the 
Federation Council, will be fulfilled. In an interview with 
reporters after the closed-door session of the upper house of 
the Russian parliament on Monday, he said that the head of the 
temporary authority Vladimir Lozovoy, appointed by the 
president, is not competent enough for his post. Aushev said 
that due to Lozovoy's position as head of the administration, 
the presidential decree on returning Ingush refugees to the 
Prigorodnyy District is not being fulfilled. 
  Aushev also said that the Federation Council decided to 
prepare a resolution where it will propose to the president to 
introduce changes in the decree on a longer state of emergency. 
He believes it necessary to introduce special rule on the 
territory of the Prigorodny District where all power would go 
over to the head of the administration, as well as to withdraw 
all North Ossetian armed units from the District. "Only federal 
law enforcement bodies can provide calm in the zone," believes 
Aushev. 
  He said that North Ossetian President Galazov has a 
different 
view on these problems and is against the return of Ingush 
refugees. 
  The president of North Ossetia, deputy to the Federation 
Council Galazov, supports the president's decree on the whole, 
but criticizes some of its provisions. In an interview with 
Interfax, he said that in line with the decree, the help that is 
being rendered to the republic through the temporary authority 
will continue depending on how constructive talks are between 
North Ossetia and Ingushetia. 
  No one is able to determine the degree of a constructive 
dialogue. To place such conditions means a lack of common 
sense, he said. He believes that those who drafted the document 
asked the president to sign the unfinalized document. 
  Galazov expressed regret that the proposals and remarks on 
the draft decree sent by representatives of North Ossetia were 
not taken into account.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova and Anna </F>
Melnikova] 
  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- The debate at the 
Federation Council (upper chamber of the Russian Parliament) on 
Monday concerning the Russian president's decree to extend the 
state of emergency in North Ossetia and Ingushetia was "biased", 
Ingush President Ruslan Aushev told journalists after the closed 
meeting of the Federation Council approved the presidential 
decree. 
  "This problem should be studied, since many do not know its 
essence," he added. 
  He said that the editing commission would prepare a draft 
decision for this Tuesday's meeting, which will contain some 
amendments to the decree. 
  Aushev claimed that amendments should provide, above all, 
for 
introducing a direct presidential rule in the conflict area, 
withdrawing all armed groups, suspending the activities of 
executive power and subordinating the head of the area 
administration directly to the Russian president. 
  The Ingush president expressed hope that a special 
commission 
of the Federation Council on the examination of the situation in 
the conflict zone, which will be formed on the basis of the 
Committee for the Affairs of the Russian Federation, the federal 
treaty and regional policy as well as of the Defence and 
Security Committee, "will appraise the situation on the spot and 
prepare legislators for the next presidential decree which may 
appear within two months, that is by the time the term of the 
present decree expires". 
  North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov told journalists 
after the end of the session that he regarded today's discussion 
of the presidential decree by the Federation Council as 
unconstructive. 
  He was deadly opposed to the introduction of a direct 
presidential rule. However, Galazov agreed that the state of 
emergency should be prolonged. 
  He noted that the presidential decree was poorly drafted, 
and 
some of its points were "quite illiterate juridically". 
According to the president, remarks by North Ossetian 
representatives were not taken into account when the document 
was drafted. 
  Adighe Republic President Aslan Dzharimov told ITAR-TASS 
today that he deems it necessary "to stiffen the execution of 
adopted decisions", and the start should be made with this 
presidential decree. 
  Dzharimov, a member of the North-Caucasian Coordination 
Council which started negotiations on the conflict back in 
January 1993, does not preclude the need for introducing a 
direct presidential rule. 
  "Decisions hitherto taken by the Russian president and 
representative power were of small effect, but the conflict 
should be extinguished at long last," the Adighe president 
concluded.

  [Text] Groznyy, 31 Jan (CHECHENPRESS-TASS) -- "Anyone who 
is peddling drugs in the republic, either for profit or at the 
instructions of the secret services, must be physically 
eliminated," Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev said in Groznyy 
at a regular sitting of the republic's Security Council. 
Dudayev's statement was released today by the CHECHENPRESS 
agency. The Chechen president's opinion is that "with the 
connivance of local authorities and law enforcement bodies, drug 
addiction has reached such proportions that it threatens the 
nation's gene pool." 
  The CHECHENPRESS agency reports that the procurator general 
"has been instructed to draft a law on applying the death 
penalty to drug dealers." 
  According to Dudayev, "As a beginning, it is necessary to 
hold a few public executions," CHECHENPRESS reports.

approximately 60 Novosibirsk Oblast enterprise directors have 
proposed taking urgent measures to overcome the crisis. 
  The corps of directors proposes, in particular, altering the 
system of taxation of enterprises by limiting the overall amount 
of direct and indirect taxes to 35-40 percent of the proceeds, 
and revising the government decree on revaluing fixed capital 
and property with regard to enterprises not in state ownership.

said 
it could only be resolved by negotiation. Jeszenszky said 
Hungary took a similar view.

<F P=106> [Interview with people's deputy S. Holovatyy, a coauthor of </F>
the Law on Ukraine's International Agreements, by Kateryna 
Kindras; place and date not given: "Things are Not That Simple"] 
  [Text] People are currently arguing in the lobby of the 
Ukrainian parliament and not only there on whether the 
tripartite agreement on the destruction of nuclear weapons may 
be regarded as an international agreement. Our correspondent 
met with people's deputy S. Holovatyy, one of the coauthors of 
the Law on Ukraine's International Agreements. Here is his 
opinion: 
  [Holovatyy] The presidential team has been trying, through 
the mass media, to convince everybody that the tripartite 
statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and 
Russia is a document that further develops the Supreme Council 
decree on the ratification of START-1. Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko 
said that the statement does not need to be ratified because it 
is not an agreement. By doing this consciously or 
unconsciously, they mislead the people. The thing is that the 
Law on Ukraine's International Agreements that was adopted last 
December reads that any document signed by authorized state 
figures is an international agreement. I reiterate: Any 
document, irrespective of its type -- accord, agreement, 
protocol, note, statement, declaration, and so forth. A 
statement signed by heads of three states is undoubtedly an 
international agreement. However, its content is not new and 
applies to those nuclear weapons whose problem has been settled 
by START I, which has been ratified by the Supreme Council with 
a supplement of 13 reservations. 
  This statement refers to START I and should, therefore, be 
regarded as a document relevant to the fulfillment of the 
Supreme Council decree on the ratification of START I. However, 
the parliament has every right to raise the question on whether 
the signing of this statement by the Ukrainian president is in 
full conformity with the requirements specified by the Supreme 
Council during the ratification of START I. If it turns out 
that there is no such conformity, the parliament may conclude 
that Ukraine is not obliged to fulfill this statement. Our 
state is only obliged to fulfill START I in that form that was 
validated by the exchange of ratification documents.

<F P=106> [Report by Volodymyr Chikalin: "We Have Cooked a Nuclear </F>
Dish, But Can We Serve It?"] 
  [Text] The tripartite agreement on Ukraine's nuclear 
weapons signed by the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. presidents 
still remains the center of attention of the international 
community and media. There is the widespread opinion that this 
document has decisive importance for our state and conforms to 
the goals of its policy and people's hopes. Are there different 
opinions on this issue? Scientists from the Academy of Sciences 
Institute of Semiconductors received an answer to this and many 
other questions at a meeting with Ukrainian People's Deputies 
Yuriy Kostenko and Ivan Zayets. 
  Yuriy Kostenko, Ukraine's minister of ecology and head of 
the 
Committee for Issues of Nuclear Disarmament, outlining his 
position on the tripartite agreement, emphasized that one should 
have proceeded on the path to nuclear disarmament gradually. 
What happened in Moscow did not comply with the interests of 
our state. 
  Explaining his viewpoint, People's Deputy Yuriy Kostenko 
recalled certain facts. In particular, he said that there are 
no nuclear warheads which have surpassed their predetermined 
shelf life. The majority of them will expire in the year 2005. 
  The terms of payments for nuclear weapons cannot satisfy us. 
The tactical nuclear weapons which were transferred to Russia 
contained 90 tonnes of highly enriched uranium and 10 tonnes of 
plutonium. Estimating that 1 kg of uranium costs $100,000 and 1 
kg of plutonium -- $1 million, Russia's debt for our nuclear 
components exceeds our debt for energy sources. 
  In the opinion of Yuriy Kostenko, the widespread belief that 
we would have ended up in complete isolation if we had not 
signed the documents on nuclear disarmament are not true. While 
proceeding on the path to nonnuclear status, we should have 
concentrated our efforts on accelerating economic reforms. 
  The same opinion was voiced by Ivan Zayets, head of the Kiev 
branch of Rukh, who dwelled on ways of reforming the executive 
branch. He appealed to the participants for voting for 
politicians who endorse the interests of an independent Ukraine. 
  Listening to the people's deputies, I recalled something my 
grandmother would say when somebody failed to complete his work: 
"She could cook, but she could not serve." 
  Having cooked a nuclear dish, we probably did not serve it 
well at the tripartite meeting's table.

  [Excerpts] [Hungarian] Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky, 
who arrived in Ungvar [Uzhgorod, Ukraine] to hand over the aid 
intended for the flood victims in Sub-Carpathia, had a 
discussion with [Ukrainian Foreign Minister] Anatoliy Zlenko. 
Peter Marvanyi, our special correspondent, reports from their 
joint news conference in Ungvar: 
  [Marvanyi] Both countries will soon sign in Brussels the 
document registering their joining the Partnership for Peace 
program. This was said at the news briefing held after the 
negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  Both politicians returned from the Balkans recently and 
during their discussion it became clear that they agreed that 
the conflict there must be solved by political means. Indeed, 
Zlenko confirmed that Ukraine opposes any kind of external 
interference. He said that a possible step of this kind by NATO 
would have negative consequences for the entire Balkans. 
According to the Ukrainian politician, nothing could justify 
the bombing of Serbian positions. 
  Naturally, mention was made -- mainly appreciatively -- 
about 
bilateral relations and the situation of the Hungarian minority 
in Ukraine. Anatoliy Zlenko said that the harmony between the 
minorities in Sub-Carpathia creates the conditions for cultural 
autonomy. In his view, the situation of Hungarians living here 
may be a yardstick for many countries where a solution to the 
nationality issue is being sought.

  [Text] Simferopol, 31 Jan -- The news conference by Yuriy 
Meshkov, elected on Sunday as first president of the Republic of 
Crimea, started with the reading of the Central Electoral 
Committee resolution on the election of the president of the 
Crimea. 
  Yuriy Meshkov read out his own appeal to the Crimeans, in 
which he assured them that he was ready for creative work and 
cooperation with all political groups and representatives of all 
ethnic groups. The Crimea could and should become a bridge of 
friendship between Russia and the Ukraine, he stressed. 
  Replying to journalists' questions, Yuriy Meshkov announced 
that with his election the question of Crimean statehood was 
decided once and for all, but the Crimea will not become a "hot 
spot" like Karabakh or the Dniester Region. As for the Black 
Sea Fleet, it should remain united and Russian.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Pasyakin report: "Where Is the Crimea's First </F>
President Taking the Republic?"] 
  [Excerpt] Sevastopol -- [passage omitted] Yuriy Meshkov's 
convincing election victory demonstrated once again the 
dominating idea of political and economic autonomy in the 
Crimea. This idea has undergone a marked evolution in Meshkov 
himself in recent weeks -- from abrasive statements about 
secession from Ukraine to prudence, a phased approach, and 
reasonableness in everything concerning the peninsula' future. 
  In this regard some people are already talking about Yuriy 
Meshkov's repudiation of basic points in his manifesto -- the 
Crimea's return to the ruble zone, the granting of the right of 
dual citizenship to the republic's citizens, and the lifting of 
the moratorium on a referendum on the status of Crimea. Some 
people regard this as a move away from the fundamental line of 
rapprochment with Russia and a tentative move toward Ukraine. 
But these unduly categorical and overstraightforward judgments 
do not match up to reality. He is not repudiating his manifesto 
and its basic points. Meshkov is simply acting as a 
level-headed, prudent politician occupying a centrist position 
rather than swinging in one or the other directon. 
  "I am not an advocate of conflict between the Crimea and 
Ukraine," Meshkov told journalists recently. "I am an advocate 
of maintaining and developing our prevailing links with Russia 
and other CIS countries. The process of acquiring autonomy is 
not something you accomplish in a day. It is a long process of 
negotiation. Moreover, Crimea's autonomy has to be supported by 
the people of the peninsula in a referendum." 
  The stance of the Crimea's first president on military 
questions is as follows: In addition to Black Sea Fleet units, 
a considerable number of Ukrainian ground troops are stationed 
in the Crimea; in this regard the Crimea will as an autonomous 
republic propose to Russia and Ukraine the demilitarization of 
the Crimea, with its defense secured as part of the 
Commonwealth's collective security system. 
  According to Meshkov, it is essential to maintain in the 
Crimea on a treaty basis only the Russian Black Sea Fleet base, 
border subunits, and the air defense system. Citizens of the 
peninsula should perform their military service exclusively in 
the Crimea, with service outside the Crimea solely on a contract 
basis. While in the future compulsory military service is to be 
abolished. Crimea does not need its own army apart from a small 
republic guard. As far as Sevastopol is concerned, Meshkov's 
opinion is that it forms an inalienable part of the Crimea and 
should remain the Russian Black Sea Fleet's main base.

  [Excerpt] Ukrainian Presidential Press Secretary Viktor 
Stelmakh told UNIAN today that Leonid Kravchuk's stance on the 
Crimean elections is a matter of principle and remains 
unchanged. The president respects the voters' right to elect 
anyone they like, but if the president of Crimea violates the 
Constitution of Ukraine, the president of Ukraine will annul 
unconstitutional decisions using the extra powers granted by the 
parliament. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil, chairman of Ukraine's Popular Movement 
[Rukh], said in his comment: "What happened had to happen; it is 
another loss for Ukraine's leaders. The unconstitutional 
presidential elections in Crimea should not have been allowed. 
We can only hope that Leonid Kravchuk will remain president of 
Ukraine and use the extra powers granted to him to annul the 
decisions of the Crimean autonomy. 
  "I do not see any absolute tragedy here; making speeches is 
one thing, pushing a plow quite another. I believe that in 18 
months' time the Crimean residents will be disillusioned with 
Yuriy Meshkov's policy. Besides, I believe he has given Leonid 
Kravchuk an advantage with regard to the statement on Ukraine's 
nuclear disarmament, since that document guarantees the 
territorial integrity of its signatories." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Chairman of the Crimean Parliament Nikolay Bagrov 
told a press conference in Simferopol on Monday that Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk and parliament speaker Ivan Plyushch 
took calmly the news about the victory of pro-Russian candidate 
Yuriy Meshkov during the presidential elections in Crimea. On 
Monday morning the defeated Bagrov had a telephone conversation 
with the Ukrainian leaders. 
  Bagrov announced that he would quit politics and that he had 
no plans to lead any opposition to the elected president. 
Neither does he imagine any confrontation with the Crimean 
parliament. However, he described Meshkov's election program as 
unfeasible and recommended that the newly-elected president 
amend it. 
  The possibility of holding a referendum on Crimea's status, 
which the new president has scheduled for March 27, must be 
evaluated by the Crimean parliament, said Bagrov. He also 
pointed out that Crimea and Russia could no longer be reunited. 
  Meanwhile, according to Interfax-Ukraine's sources, Meshkov 
is already forming his cabinet. The law on the president of the 
Republic of Crimea gives him the status of head of the executive 
authority. On Tuesday or Wednesday Meshkov is likely to go to 
Kiev for talks with the Ukrainian leaders. 
  Vice Chairman of Ukraine's Popular RUKH Aleksandr 
Lavrinovich 
described the results of the presidential elections in Crimea as 
"the defeat of the Ukrainian officials' authority." He told 
Interfax-Ukraine that a referendum on Crimea's secession from 
Ukraine might be held, presumably next spring. 
  He believes that the results of the elections in Crimea 
might 
mark the beginning of confrontation between Crimea and Ukraine." 
[no opening quotation marks as received] 
  Ukraine's First Deputy Minister for Nationalities and 
Migration Aleksandr Piskun believes that the results of the 
elections were due to the Ukrainian authorities' inconsistent 
policies. "All this poses a threat to Ukraine's sovereignty," he 
said.

  [Text] Kiev, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Crimea's new President Yuriy 
Meshkov, who wants the autonomous Ukrainian Republic returned to 
Russia, will meet Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in Kiev on 
Tuesday, reliable sources here said. 
  The Ukrainian presidency had not officially confirmed the 
meeting. 
  Meshkov was elected president of Crimea on Sunday [30 
January] with 72.9 percent of the votes in the republic's first 
direct presidential elections. He announced he would hold a 
referendum on Crimea's future status on March 27, the same day 
as Ukrainian parliamentary elections.

  [Text] Kiev/Lvov January 31 TASS -- Stepan Khmara, leader 
of Ukrainian nationalists, said Monday that President Leonid 
Kravchuk must recognise the Crimean presidential elections as 
illegal, the Ukrainian television reported. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the opposition movement 
"Rukh", agreed with him saying "the presidential elections in 
the Crimea should have been cancelled before they started". 
  Yuri Shukhevich, head of the ultra-right paramilitary 
UNA-UNSO organization, went further saying the Crimean 
developments were "Israeli intrigues". 
  Several west-Ukrainian politicians questioned by ITAR-TASS 
on 
the matter, joined in opinion that the results of the Crimean 
elections are only the beginning of the federalization of 
Ukraine. 
  Moreover, they predicted that following the Crimean example, 
the next province to claim the sovereignity will be Galicia or 
the Transcarpathian part of the Ukraine. Last year the attempts 
to proclaim there an independent state were strangled by the 
parliament.

  [Text] Kiev January 31 TASS -- Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader 
of the Ukrainian nationalist opposition movement "Rukh 
[Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka]", said that "the 
presidential elections in the Crimea should have been cancelled 
before they started". 
  In his statement, circulated on Monday, Chornovil expressed 
hope that Leonid Kravchuk would use his presidential right to 
abort any steps of the new pro-Russian Crimean president if they 
contradict the Ukrainian Constitution. 
  The leader of the "Rukh" blamed the leadership of the 
parliament for the outcome of the elections which he called "a 
recurrent loss of the Ukrainian authorities". 
  Chornovil accused the Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch 
personally of "stubbornly refusing to put onto the parliament's 
agenda the question of bringing the Crimean laws into line with 
those of Ukraine".

  [Text] Simferopol -- Newly elected Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov held a news conference on 31 January at which he said 
that there are no reasons why the situation in the Crimea should 
deteriorate. He also spoke in favor of a single Black Sea 
Fleet. The newly elected president told the news conference that 
he intends to appeal to the Republic of the Crimea procurator in 
connection with certain state structures negating the Law on the 
President of the Republic of the Crimea. In Yuriy Meshkov's 
words, the president does not even have a residence yet. He 
also emphasized that if the Majles of the Crimean Tartar People 
is a public organization it must register with the Crimean 
Justice Ministry. However, "if the Majles claims the role of an 
authority, I have to say that there must not be two such 
authorities on the peninsula and the Majles must cease to 
exist," Yuriy Meshkov stated. 
  In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN correspondent on the 
same day, Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the Majles of the 
Crimean Tartar people, said: "In my opinion, the results of the 
elections in the Crimea and the election of Yuriy Meshkov as 
president demonstrate that under the conditions of economic 
collapse, political instability, and uncertainty, society is 
prone to believe in the most adventurist aims and programs. 
Another argument in favor of this suggestion is Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's victory in the elections to Russia's State Duma." 
  In Refat Chubarov's words, there are grounds to believe that 
Yuriy Meshkov in the post of the president will obstruct the 
process of the Crimean Tartar people returning to their 
historical homeland and restoring their political rights. "I am 
convinced that Meshkov's next move will be to attempt to exclude 
from the Law on the Elections to the Supreme Council of the 
Crimea the amendment guaranteeing 14 parliamentary seats for the 
Crimean Tartar people." 
  Forecasting the future situation on the peninsula, Chubarov 
said that the Majles will never recognize the presidential 
powers of an individual who would act to prevent the restoration 
of the rights of the Crimean Tartar people. "If Meshkov begins 
actions of a discriminatory nature against us, we in our turn 
will react adequately. We, however, will not make the first 
move, which would allow him to destabilize the situation on the 
peninsula and achieve his aims," Chubarov stated.

  [Text] As reported, the leader of the Republican Party of 
the Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, has become the first president of the 
Crimean Republic. Presidential ex-candidate Mykola Bagrov, 
satisfying journalists' request, held a news conference today. 
He explained his defeat at yesterday's balloting saying that 
the people voted not against him but against their difficult 
situation [as heard]. Mykola Bagrov did not agree with the 
opinion that he was preparing the presidential office for 
himself. [passage indistinct] I have not interfered with the 
results of the balloting, and this was confirmed by Yuriy 
Meshkov's impressive victory. Mykola Bagrov was sorry that 
Crimean residents did not support his program, on which he had 
worked so hard. Asked about how realistic Yuriy Meshkov's 
program is, Mykola Bagrov said that the first Crimean president 
will face many difficulties. If Yuriy Meshkov appeals to him 
for help, he -- guided by Crimean interests -- will not refuse 
to give it. With regard to his personal plans for the future, 
Mykola Bagrov did not specify them, but said that he was going 
to leave politics. At any rate, he will not participate in the 
elections to the Crimean or Ukrainian Supreme Council. A hard 
life is in store for me, he said at the end, but I am not going 
to part with the Crimea.

  [Text] Odessa, 31 Jan -- The all-Ukrainian political 
association, State Independence of Ukraine [DSU], published a 
statement on the Crimean presidential elections. The statement, 
signed by DSU chairman Roman Koval, says, in particular: 
  "The results of the Crimean presidential elections were to 
be 
expected: The elected president, Yuriy Meshkov, is a resolute 
and uncompromising advocate of Crimea's reunification with 
Russia. His victory became possible not only through the 
support of Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy, the Russian fifth column in 
Crimea, but also because of the weak and indecisive policy of 
official Kiev. The policy of balancing acts, compromises, and 
wiles, stems not from the president's stately wisdom, but from 
his personal human weakness and lack of patriotism. Kravchuk 
neglected his main duty: The creation of a Ukrainian force that 
could be relied on to solve important problems. 
  Responsibility for the developments in Crimea also rests 
with 
Ukrainian democrats, primarily with the pro-president parties 
and congresses whose support enabled Kravchuk to pursue his 
defeatist policy. The Ukrainian leadership is powerless and 
inefficient. It is incapable of fighting for Ukrainian 
interests, being accustomed to submitting to foreign will and 
carrying out decisions taken in Moscow. 
  We call on all political forces to demand Kravchuk's 
resignation. The Supreme Council must impeach the president even 
before the March elections.

  [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in 
Ukrainian at 1700 GMT on 31 January, in the penultimate program 
of a series of party political broadcasts on Ukrainian TV, 
broadcasts a 10-minute party political broadcast by The State 
Independence of Ukraine [DSU], an all-Ukrainian political 
association, introduced by Hryhoriy Hrebenyuk, a member of this 
association's leadership. 
  The speaker begins the broadcast by defining the State 
Independence of Ukraine as an association of ethnic Ukrainians 
fighting "to build a Ukrainian Ukraine." He then sets out the 
association's election platform, which is as follows: The 
association works to "stop immediately the uncontrollable export 
to Russia, Israel, Poland, and other countries of food and 
consumer goods," and "to close the Ukrainian borders and thus 
stop the filthy wave of Russian and Western pseudo-culture, 
pornography," drug addiction and immigration from Russia, the 
Caucasus, and Third World countries. 
  The association is against "the democratic and communist 
clique of Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy," which sold Ukraine down the 
river, and expresses non-confidence in "the so-called democratic 
opposition zealously following orders from the West" and "the 
communists whose hearts are with Moscow, the capital of the 
Russian empire of evil." It is in favor of a crushing blow to 
the Mafia, state monopoly in foreign trade and currency 
operations, state regulation of prices, "expropriation of the 
new bourgeois of non-Ukrainian decent that enriched itself by 
violating the law and exploiting the Ukrainians." It is in favor 
of the retention of industry in state ownership and a new 
citizenship law that will only make loyal Ukrainian citizens 
eligible to vote and prevent "privatization of Ukraine by 
aliens." 
  The speaker then proclaims that in order for Ukraine "to 
survive as a nation, preference in our state must be given to 
anything Ukrainian. Ukrainians must be given precedence in 
employment, social security, provision of cheap housing, and 
privatization." 
  He maintains that the peasantry should be given land that 
can 
be bequeathed to their children but not sold, stating that 
"politicians must encourage the Ukrainian peasant to the full." 
  He goes on to say that the association will "stop the 
conversion of the military industrial complex and unilateral 
disarmament," put an end to "democratic chaos and communist 
rule," and promote strong nationalistically minded authorities 
and "a powerful Ukrainian Army armed with nuclear weapons." 
  All this goes to show, he continues, that there is every 
precondition in Ukraine for a military dictatorship to be 
established, to rid Ukraine of such phenomena as chaos, the 
Crimean crisis, separatism, and crime. He adds that "Ukrainian 
servicemen must come to power," which will be followed by 
decreeing censorship, banning democratization, "resolutely 
restoring order in Ukraine," introducing an economic state of 
emergency, disbanding anti- Ukrainian organizations, and 
"deporting the disloyal." 
  He continues: "A national dictatorship alone will lead 
Ukraine out of chaos and see it through until it becomes a 
state. The DSU calls on the Supreme Council to draw up a 
Ukraine law on the impeachment of the president, and immediately 
remove Leonid Kravchuk from power as a traitor to the national 
interests of the Ukrainian people who broke his promise," given 
to Ukraine when he took up this post "so important to Ukraine." 
  He concludes his speech by appealing to the Ukrainian people 
to rise, and proclaiming: "Ukraine will win! There will be the 
Ukrainian state."

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk believes that 
"the Ukrainian Armed Forces will act in the appropriate order 
and are capable of defending the state in an extreme situation." 
This was the way he commented on the results of the military 
command exercise on territorial defense, the Defense Ministry's 
press service told INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  The first strategic exercise on territorial defense in 
Ukraine which took place under the main staff led by the 
commander in chief, President Leonid Kravchuk, finished on 
Friday. The purpose of the exercise was to develop interaction 
between the power ministries, the frontier defense forces, the 
national guards' army and the civil defense forces. 
  The press service also announced that actions not only in 
case of an external threat but also in case of a natural 
calamity had been carried out during the exercise.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Leonid Kravchuk by unidentified </F>
reporter from "Without Protocol" program; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] Our concept 
stipulates that Ukraine should have combat-ready Armed Forces 
capable of defending its sovereignty and independence at any 
point. That is why we are conducting a strategic command staff 
exercise. These are not military maneuvers and no technical 
equipment is being used, although we have already been accused 
of the opposite. There have been attempts to say that because 
Ukraine has no possibility to conduct such undertakings 
[military maneuvers]; it is holding a staff exercise. I want to 
point out to these gentlemen that if necessity arises, Ukraine 
will find strategic reserves and a possibility to use the 
equipment available in the Armed Forces. However, we have set no 
such task -- the task was absolutely different; but when people 
do not know what they want, or they see their strategic goals in 
spreading lies about Ukraine, we treat this with understanding. 
[words indistinct] 
  [Reporter] As the commander in chief, can you say whether 
Ukraine is capable of defending itself? 
  [Kravchuk] Resolving the problem of reforming the Armed 
Forces is not the same as resolving the problem of defense 
capability. I mean that we have arrived at the conclusions 
about the current state of our Armed Forces and all other 
structures and how ready we are in case of necessity. We will 
do everything to prevent such necessities, but troops exist and 
their normal task is to train. I believe that we can tell our 
people that the Ukrainian Armed Forces along with other 
ministries and departments involved in this [sphere], are 
capable of cooperating and performing their functions regarding 
the protection of Ukraine's interests, its national border, the 
people, and their peaceful labor. 
  There are problems in supplies of say, lubricants and 
appropriate resources; there are personnel, discipline, and 
responsibility problems -- all this was demonstrated very 
vividly during the exercise and we saw that this [exercise] 
should have been conducted earlier. We were preoccupied with 
things like transforming a corps into a division or a division 
into a corps... or reducing military districts and expanding 
them. [words indistinct] Today, we have set a strategic goal -- 
that of Ukraine's defense, the readiness of both the Armed 
Forces and others for this sacred task of state defense. This 
is a qualitatively new task. This has been the first exercise 
and thus, I cannot give a precise and full answer about it. I 
believe that when we meet again at future exercises, we will be 
able to speak about their significance. However, even today we 
should say that it was needed and has brought considerable 
benefits.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Aleksey Zhuk; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Zhuk] Myechyslaw Hryb, the new Supreme Soviet 
speaker, conducted his first working meeting at the Belarus 
Supreme Soviet today. It was pointed out that to all 
appearances the political confrontation in the Supreme Soviet 
and in the republic has somewhat lessened, but the economic 
crisis is on the increase. 
  [Hryb] Not even one of the former USSR republics has 
determined its state structure. We as such do not have one. 
The old structure was destroyed but it has not been replaced by 
a new one. 
  I will use all my efforts to establish a firm presidential 
rule and, without doubts, cooperation with Russia. This does 
not stand in the way of developing political and economic 
relations with Western countries. One is welcome to work in 
this direction but priority should be given to relations with 
the Russian Federation since our roots and our economic ties are 
there.

  [Text] Approximately half an hour ago, the 13th Supreme 
Soviet session of the Republic of Belarus resumed its work. 
Supreme Soviet Chairman Myechyslaw Hryb opened the session with 
an introductory speech. He thanked the audience for electing 
him Supreme Soviet chairman and called for the consolidation of 
all forces in society to work jointly to pull the republic out 
of its crisis and move forward toward the development of 
society. 
  The Supreme Soviet chairman appealed to the opposition and 
Belarusian mass media not to go in for idle criticism, but 
rather to work constructively for the benefit of society. I 
hope for the wisdom of the people, for the support of all 
forces, said Myechyslaw Hryb. He spoke about today's telephone 
conversation with Boris Yeltsin and said that the Russian leader 
expressed support and understanding. Later, Belarusian deputies 
began discussing miscellaneous issues. Our newscasts will 
report in detail on the course of the Supreme Soviet session.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Kovalev and Sergey Prokopenko: "The </F>
Speaker Has Gone! Long Live the Speaker! Myechyslaw Hryb Has 
Been Elected Chairman of the Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet"] 
  [Text] Commenting on his departure, Stanislav Shushkevich, 
former speaker of the Belarusian parliament, said: "I am not 
acceptable to the majority in this parliament. They do not want 
to form a new society, the majority of the present deputies want 
to go back to the old ways. I still do not understand how I 
managed to become head of the Supreme Soviet at all. The 
communist majority suffered a tremendous shock in the fall of 
1991 and my election was a great stroke of luck, not an 
objective inevitability." 
  At the same time some local observers see several reasons 
for 
what happened. Specifically that there was no centrist group in 
the Belarusian parliament, that it was split between an 
overwhelming majority and a small opposition, and that the 
parliament which is unprofessional in status has become an 
adjunct of the executive. 
  Be that as it may, last Friday [28 January] the Belarusian 
parliament got a new leader -- Mechyslaw Hryb. Contrary to the 
predictions of many observers, who thought that parliament would 
take a long time over the election of a new speaker, this 
election took just two days. Consultations were held in the 
groups and factions on 27 January, and on the morning of 28 
January the Supreme Soviet Presidium put Mechyslaw Hryb to the 
deputies as a candidate. Of course, the parliamentarians did 
not agree to uncontested elections. The list of nominations for 
the secret ballot included the candidacies of People's Deputies 
Viktor Hanchar and Mikhail Marinich. Even though none of the 
contenders managed to obtain the 174 votes necessary for 
election in the first round, hardly anyone was in any doubt that 
Hryb would win. Incidentally, the left-wing parliamentary 
majority gambled on him. They were not wrong. In round two 
Hryb received 183 votes against 55. 
  The new speaker is 56 years old. He hails from the village 
of Savichi, which is in Grodno Oblast's Dyatlovskiy Rayon. His 
father died in the war. In 1959 he graduated from the Interior 
Ministry's Fire-Fighting Technical School in Lvov. He served in 
the organs of the Interior Ministry where he rose to the rank of 
lieutenant general and chief of the Vitebsk Oblast Soviet 
Executive Committee's Internal Affairs Administration. In 1990 
Mechyslaw Hryb was elected a Belarusian people's deputy. He 
headed the parliamentary commission on questions of national 
security, defense, and the fight against crime. He is a 
supporter of a strong authority and advocates the introduction 
of the presidency. He supported the ratification of the CIS 
Collective Security Treaty, which led to serious frictions with 
Stanislav Shushkevich. 
  At his first news conference following the election, 
Myechyslaw Hryb told journalists that he sees his main task as 
the consolidation of all the forces in parliament. "I have no 
other program to extricate the republic from the crisis than 
that which was adopted by our Supreme Soviet and government," he 
said. "I do not believe that there should be any adjustments to 
our foreign policy course. Belarus will remain a sovereign, 
independent state, will strive for non-nuclear status and 
neutrality, and will conscientiously fulfill all previously 
signed treaties and agreements." 
  Myechyslaw Hryb's election as chairman of the Belarus 
Supreme 
Soviet has been unambiguously assessed by many observers as a 
victory for the left-wing forces in Belarus. In their opinion 
this may have quite a powerful impact on the republic's foreign 
policy and in particular could introduce ideological aspects to 
it. After all, voices have already been raised in parliament on 
several occasions calling for "opposition to the West" and its 
influence. As for relations with the eastern neighbor, they will 
most probably become even closer.

<F P=106> [Untitled article by Nikolay Shcherbachenya] </F>
  [Text] The standoff between the majority of the Belarusian 
legislature and its speaker resulted in the removal of the 
latter. Technically, Stanislav Shushkevich remained the head of 
the republic's highest legislative body until the outcome of the 
26 January vote was made public. But in fact, he has long lost 
support of the legislative majority and the opposition as well. 
In spite of the high speed with which everything happened, the 
recent events did not come as a surprise at all. 
  The speaker was accused of failing to take anticorruption 
measures, exercising inadequate control over law enforcement 
agencies, and personal misconduct. However, genuine reasons 
that led up to the removal of Stanislav Shushkevich from his 
post lie much deeper. The deputies could have presented an even 
longer list of his faults on Wednesday [26 January]. In the 
first place, most were extremely displeased with the legislative 
speaker's downright negative attitude toward the CIS collective 
security treaty, with numerous uncertainties about the merger of 
the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, and with him 
vacillating on issues of the Republic's state system. On the 
other hand, Shushkevich became inconvenient to the legislative 
opposition, too, which has lately adopted a radically 
nationalistic stance and a distinct orientation toward the West. 
  The clash came to a head during the examination of a new 
draft constitution. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Soviet 
found itself in a political deadlock then. At that time, many 
realized that a quick and decisive outcome was imminent. I 
think that there is another reason for the removal of the leader 
of the country's highest legislative body, who was not supported 
by the majority. The deputies had to find and show society the 
main culprit of the delayed constitutional process that could 
somehow justify their poor work. Otherwise, the situation would 
have called for early elections -- a prospect that most of the 
legislators do not particularly welcome. 
  Not only does Shushkevich's removal not settle any troubles 
of the Supreme Soviet, it may produce a whole range of new, and 
even nastier, ones for the parliament. Although the "buffer" 
policy of the former parliament's leader did not hasten the work 
on the draft constitution, it sometimes allowed opposing 
factions and groupings of the Belarusian legislature to reach 
compromises. Will such compromises be possible when the Supreme 
Soviet splits into two unreconcilable camps, especially on key 
issues requiring the constitutional majority?

  [Text] The U.S. Administration has welcomed statements by 
Belarusian Government officials who confirmed their commitment 
to follow the path toward a market economy, as well as to 
fulfill their obligations to transform the Republic of Belarus 
into a non-nuclear state. We are interested in Belarus 
continuing on this course. We will cooperate with Vyacheslav 
Kebich's government and try to encourage this government to take 
up reforms. It is a long-term policy of the United States, said 
White House Spokesperson Dee Dee Myers during a briefing with 
journalists. The agreement on the liquidation of nuclear 
weapons provides for the allotment of $12 billion to former 
Soviet republics which will dismantle their nuclear weapons. It 
is a great financial stimulus for such countries as Belarus and 
Ukraine, she stated. 
  According to the Belarusian Embassy in Washington, an 
official of the U.S. State Department held a briefing, during 
which he paid much attention to the political situation in 
Belarus. He stated that the United States is somewhat troubled 
by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet resolution of 26 January. At 
the same time, (Macary) referred to Foreign Minister 
Kravchanka's statement to the diplomatic corps in Minsk on 27 
January, with regard to the continuity and consistency of 
Belarusian foreign policy, first of all, in the sphere of 
nuclear disarmament. We consider this statement to be of great 
importance, emphasized the U.S. official.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Bezveselnyy: "Belarus and NATO: Options </F>
for Cooperation"] 
  [Text] As part of his trip to Belarus, Field Marshall 
Richard Frederick Vincent, chairman of the NATO Military 
Committee, met with Colonel-General Kozlovskiy, Belarusian 
defense minister. The negotiations were devoted to the issues 
of continuously developing contacts between the Belarusian Armed 
Forces and the North Atlantic bloc and the exchange of 
experience in reforming the Army and arms reduction. 
  During talks between both military officials, substantial 
attention was attached to determining their positions regarding 
the possibility of Belarus joining the "Partnership for Peace" 
initiative. Incidentally, this issue was also brought up during 
the recent visit of U.S. President Clinton in Minsk and in 
negotiations with the leadership of our Republic. Mr. Vincent 
shared his views on the development of cooperation among 
European countries to achieve guarantees of their sovereignty 
and territorial integrity. 
  Regarding this, there was particular interest in 
understanding the positions on the intention of our Republic to 
become a neutral state and to completely remove nuclear weapons 
from the Belarusian territory, as well as possible forms of 
bilateral cooperation in the military sphere [sentence as 
published]. It is believed that this may have an impact on a 
future visit of a group of NATO military inspectors to examine 
Belarusian participation in the "Partnership for Peace." 
  Toward the end of the meeting, Field Marshall Richard 
Vincent 
noted that the North Atlantic Bloc knows very well and respects 
the Republic's foreign policies directed at entirely giving up 
its nuclear arsenals. As a result, this evokes the bloc's 
sincere desire to help Belarus, especially in the sphere of 
conventional weapons.

  [Text] According to the Belarusian Government newspaper 
RESPUBLIKA, so far almost 800 military pilots have left the 
Belarusian Air Force to do their further service in Russia. The 
strength of the republic's airborne troops has been 
significantly weakened by a mass exodus to Russia; over 300 
officers changed their place of service. The paper also reports 
that about 2,500 officers are trying to leave for Russia in the 
near future. Over half the Belarusians who are graduating from 
Russian military schools this year have already signed contracts 
to do their service in the Russian Armed Forces. The newspaper 
believes that a higher level of social guarantees for servicemen 
of the Russian Army is the main reason for this.

  [Text] [Sviridov] Official Minsk is awaiting the visit of 
Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister of the Russian 
Government. It is thought that in the course of the talks a 
package of documents will be finally agreed on the unification 
of the two states monetary systems. 
  There is especial controversy on the question of mutual 
settlements. But Vladimir Ratkevich, the chairman of the State 
Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, considers that: 
  [Ratkevich] It is pointless for the Russians to worry that 
Belarus will dump a great deal of funds onto Russia's monetary 
system; that there will be inflation. I am sure that when 
Russia takes down its customs barriers, takes down its customs, 
and when prices are equalized it will be more efficient for 
enterprises to get what they need both in Belarus and Russia. 
  [Sviridov] Meanwhile, in the republic discussions are being 
held on the possible exchange rate. For citizens of course a 
rate of one to one has been fixed. Industrialists insist on 
their own: One to three or one to four. No doubt not without 
justification, because trade with Russia comprises almost 70 
percent of its overall volume with countries of the former USSR.

  [Text] The foreign ministers of the Nordic countries 
support the plan to create a UN battalion from the Baltic states 
and could help train such a battalion and provide it with 
everything necessary. 
  During a meeting of the Nordic foreign ministers in 
Stockholm, Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas said 
that the Baltic states have expressed a wish to participate in 
the Partnership for Peace program and to create a UN battalion. 
The Nordic countries are already training officers of the 
Baltic states for this job. 
  According to Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, 
Denmark has invited representatives of the Baltic states to a 
meeting in Copenhagen on 9 February. I would also like to 
discuss the place of the Baltic states in the Partnership for 
Peace program, he said. 
  The Nordic foreign ministers have expressed the hope in a 
joint statement that an agreement will be reached in the near 
future on the withdrawal of the Russian Army from Latvia and 
Estonia. The ministers also stressed that all countries should 
respect the sovereignty and independence of the Baltic states. 
The Baltic states should determine their own foreign policy 
direction without outside pressure.

  [Text] Riga, January 31 (LETA) -- Friday [28 January] the 
Secretary of the Saeima [parliament], Imants Daudiss, the 
Foreign Minister, Georgs Andrejevs, and the Deputy Chairman of 
the faction "Latvia's Way", Indulis Berzins, met with the 
deputies of the National Assembly of France. 
  According to the Saeima press service Andrejevs, giving a 
review on a current political situation in Latvia, described the 
"Latvia's Way" faction as centristic being criticized both by 
rightists and leftists. He was also quoted as saying that "we 
are not confronting with the opposition on the Latvian past but 
still there are differences of opinions concerning current and 
future problems." Andrejevs indicated the presence of the 
foreign military forces, migrants entering after the World War 
Two and complicated economic situation in Latvia as the factors 
threatening Latvia's independence. 
  Those who have not lived here, said Andrejevs, are not 
easily 
aware of the situation in Latvia. "We are constantly given 
instructions how to solve our problems, which are probably 
standard for European democracy, but in today's Latvia may lead 
to common destabilization." Andrejevs pointed out the most 
extensive influx of migrants was until 1970. The fact makes 
unacceptable quotas fixing on the basis of the number of years 
spent in Latvia, as the CSCE experts have proposed. 
  Russia failed to fulfill the resolution by the last Supreme 
Council of Latvia on the troops withdrawal from Riga by the end 
of 1992, and from Latvia by the end of 1993. The Russian forces 
stationed currently in Latvia threaten not only Latvian but also 
Lithuanian independence, said the minister. 
  Indulis Berzins said the democratic forces in Russia did not 
work out a new conception for its foreign policy, causing a 
return to the doctrine of empire. The Russian troops in Latvia 
have a negative effect on the interior political situation in 
Latvia. "We want to be secure today while the "Partnership for 
Peace" proposed by the United States provides security for 
distant future," said Berzins.

  [Text] Parliamentary Speaker Anatolijs Gorbunovs, in an 
interview to the Baltic News Service, today expressed the view 
that it is premature to take the decision to hold a referendum 
on the issue of the Skrunda radar. Gorbunovs does not consider 
the holding of the referendum the best political means to tackle 
the problem of the Skrunda radar at the moment, because in that 
case the inter-state talks with Russia on troop withdrawal could 
come to a halt. The discontinuation of the talks in the present 
Latvian situation would be very undesirable, Gorbunovs stressed. 
  The visit of the Saeima delegation to the United States 
shows 
that possibilities of tackling issues related to the withdrawal 
of the Russian army have not been exhausted, Gorbunovs said. 
According to him, at the moment Latvia's main opportunity for 
tackling the issue of the army withdrawal is to continue 
interstate talks with Russia. 
  The Latvian National Security Council has not passed a 
specific resolution on holding a referendum on the Skrunda radar 
issue, because a law on referenda has not been passed. 
According to Gorbunovs, the drafting of such a law would take 
about one month.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Everybody Can Understand </F>
Kozyrev's Speech as They Please"] 
  [Text] Riga, 20 Jan -- Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs 
told DIENA today that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has 
received a copy of the speech by Russian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev [advocating the retention of Russian 
troops on the territory of the former USSR]. G. Andrejevs 
pointed out that this is "a speech that was thought over with 
great care so as to please everyone." Still, it has no direct 
link with the Baltic states and everybody can interpret it as 
they please. 
  DIENA also interviewed leaders of several parliament 
factions, with the aim of discerning prevailing opinions in the 
Latvian parliament. 
  Edvins Kide (Unity for Latvia) told DIENA that Kozyrev's 
statement was dictated by the existing state of affairs, because 
"Kozyrev has to show sternness to keep his post." As E. Kide 
saw things, the speech could also be explained by pressure from 
the Russian Liberal Democratic Party on foreign policy. 
  Aleksandrs Kirsteins (LNNK) [Movement for Latvia's National 
Independence] told DIENA he would not pay much attention to what 
Kozyrev is saying because "at the moment, Russia has no 
government." In his opinion, A. Kozyrev is keen to keep his post 
in the Russian Government. A. Kirsteins was more impressed by 
DIENA's interview with Russian Ambassador to the United States 
Vladimir Lukin, a deputy to the State Council from the 
Javlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc. The leader of the LNNK faction 
believes that the standpoints of Latvia and Russia could come 
closer together if Lukin became chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Commission in the Russian parliament. 
  Filips Strogonovs (Equal Rights) told DIENA that Kozyrev's 
speech could be regarded from two points of view. He recalled 
that about 700,000 inhabitants of Latvia lack citizenship. "This 
gives Russia cause to speak in the name of these 700,000," said 
F. Strogonovs. Therefore, he thinks, it is important to resolve 
the problem of citizenship. On the other hand, the Russian 
geopolitical interests mentioned by Kozyrev are ungrounded 
because they reflect only Russian political ambition. "Our 
standpoint in this matter is the following: Latvia is an 
independent sovereign state, but we should not give cause, by 
way our policies, for other countries to interfere in our 
internal affairs," said F. Strogonovs. 
  Aivars Kreituss (faction of the Democratic Party) confessed 
to DIENA that on the one hand, Kozyrev's utterances should not 
be treated seriously. He also saw the willingness of the 
Russian foreign affairs minister to obtain an important post. 
On the other hand, emphasized A. Kreituss, it is necessary to 
put in order and ensure Latvia's defense. "We should find twice 
as much money for its needs, at least to provide it with 
ammunition," said Kreituss. 
  Maris Grinblats (Fatherland and Freedom) expressed his view 
to DIENA that A. Kozyrev's speech is somehow linked with the 
considerable influence of communists and liberal democrats in 
the Russian parliament. M. Grinblats concluded that Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin, as well as A. Kozyrev, are more 
inclined in the direction of these forces, to amortize the 
position of the more aggressive part of society. M. Grinblats 
said the policy of Russia during the last years indicates 
nonetheless, that the administration of B. Yeltsin prefers 
economic methods to keep the Baltic states in Russia's sphere of 
influence, rather than strictly military pressure. 
  The leader of the Latvia's Way faction, Andrejs Pantelejevs, 
expressed his opinion to DIENA very laconically: "At the 
moment, we do not have sufficient information; it would be 
tragic if this statement was connected with the Clinton and 
Yeltsin summit; but it is not tragic if it is just a 
misunderstanding." 
  Aida Predele (Union of Christian Democrats), in speaking to 
DIENA, deemed the statement by the Russian foreign minister as a 
high-level provocation.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 31, BNS -- Latvia is unlikely to enter 
into the Council of Europe (CE) during its current session 
because the Baltic country still lacks a citizenship law, said 
Aivars Endzins, one of Latvian delegates to the CE Parliamentary 
Assembly (PA). 
  The Latvian delegation participated in the CEPA Strasbourg 
session Jan. 24-28. 
  During the session, Latvian delegates received CEPA experts' 
recommendations on the citizenship issue together with 
Secretary-General Catherine Lallumiere's letter. 
  Latvia will consider the recommendations at the top-level, 
Endzins said. 
  Saeima (parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee head Alexander 
Kirsteins addressed the assembly's Migration and Refugees 
Committee on the social integration problems of Latvia's 
Russian-speakers. 
  During lobby conversations, French, British and German 
delegates worried Latvians by attaching a priority to interstate 
pacts with Russia over Russian troops' withdrawal from Latvia 
and Estonia, Endzins said. 
  The all-European transportation problems was another topic 
for consideration at the session, Endzins said. Estonian and 
Lithuanian delegates said they hoped to get a financial help by 
the CE to build the Via Baltica highway. 
  The Baltic delegations closely cooperated during the 
session, 
said Latvian delegation secretary Rolands Blezurs. Blezurs also 
spoke highly of Estonia's Tune Helam's election as CEPA's vice 
president. 
  Latvia was also represented to the session by MP's [member 
of 
parliament] Andrejs Pantelejevs and Alexander Kirsteins.

<F P=106> [Interview with Juris Bojars, chairman of the Latvian </F>
Democratic Labor Party, by A. Borisov; place and date not 
given: "One Must Be Pragmatic"] 
  [Excerpts] Fate and, to be more exact, a short line in his 
life record -- 22 (!) years ago Juris Bojars worked in the KGB 
-- have willed that this well-known Latvian lawyer was deprived 
of the possibility to stand for the Saeima [parliament] 
elections. Finding himself outside the parliament, however, 
Bojars did not remain outside big politics. My interlocutor is 
not only chairman of the Latvian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], 
but also director of the Latvian Institute of International 
Relations. [passage omitted] 
  [Borisov] I address my next question to you as a 
specialist in international relations. It is common knowledge 
that recently the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution on 
the violations of human rights in Latvia.... 
  [Bojars] The resolution does not mention human rights 
violations. It deals with the problems of these rights. There 
is not a single state that would not have similar problems. 
  [Borisov]One of the reasons why Latvia did not join the 
European Council was the delay in adopting the law on 
citizenship. Is the approval of this law in a national 
referendum a correct move? 
  [Bojars] Such a decision has not yet been adopted. Only 
[Prime Minister] V. Birkavs has expressed some considerations 
about this issue. I think that this option does not run counter 
to the principles of democracy. However, my personal opinion is 
that in such a case we must submit the entire package rather 
than just one draft law for public approval. People must have a 
chance to choose. Russia's experience has demonstrated that if 
they have one draft constitution they may either accept or 
reject it. The people think: How can we live without a 
constitution? They approve of it as a result, without either 
discussing or reading it. The same will happen in our country 
because the majority of the population does not have the 
possibility or the desire to read this document. 
  [Borisov]As there is a dilemma in foreign policy 
whether to lean toward the East or the West, what would you 
advise? 
  [Bojars] To be pragmatic and do what is necessary. Regarding 
current tendencies.... Yeltsin is also accused of his love for 
the West. This is in fashion now. Since we were so firmly tied 
to the East, there is nothing surprising in our current yearning 
for the West. 
  [Borisov] Speaking of security, is there any sense in 
hurrying to be under NATO's wing? 
  [Bojars] Under the current circumstances, it is very 
difficult for Latvia to defend itself on its own. One can 
understand our officials who have found the only option for 
action -- to search for protection in NATO, although Russia does 
not like such a course of events. In such a case, Russia could 
behave in a natural and wise manner -- not to disseminate 
threats about turning Latvia into its province, but to conclude 
an agreement with us on mutual security and to provide 
guarantees. Certainly, anyone may tell you that before the war 
Latvia and the USSR had about seven such agreements, all of 
which were violated. So, where are the guarantees that someone 
like Zhirinovskiy will not do the same after assuming power? 
Given NATO's strength, relations with this bloc may be one of 
the possible replies. 
  [Borisov]You were very critical of Godmanis' government 
once. Have you preserved the same attitude toward Birkavs' 
cabinet? 
  [Bojars] My answer is as follows. The current circle of 
authorities does not differ greatly from the former one. I must 
admit, however, that the policies of the current government are 
less chaotic, while Godmanis was a very messy person. Birkavs 
is much more reserved. Moreover, he is a lawyer and he is more 
accustomed to some order and a system, which is also positive. 
Godmanis was like someone from the Popular Front, although he 
did not found this organization. I would say frankly that he 
simply stuck to the Popular Front. He took advantage of this 
situation and resorted to populist ideas that are not exploited 
by the current cabinet. The latter is a truly right-wing 
organization devoted to conservative ideals. The government 
moves concerning pensioners do not indicate any social trend in 
the current cabinet of ministers or "Latvia's Way." Therefore, 
my attitude toward this government is critical and reserved. 
  [Borisov]The LDDP lost the elections. Why? 
  [Bojars] Not only we but all left-wing parties suffered a 
defeat. This is quite natural. The Socialist International has 
established a certain regularity -- in postcommunist societies 
the leftist parties usually lose the first elections, while in 
the second elections the picture changes considerably. The same 
is typical of Russia. True, there are no strong noncommunist 
leftist parties there. Thus, we have to deal with a historical 
regularity. Thorough reforms are in store for our party in the 
beginning of next year. We are bringing them in line with the 
best traditions of European social democracy. 
  [Borisov]Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas told 
journalists at his news conference today about his visit to the 
Netherlands and Belgium as well as the Partnership for Peace 
[PFP] agreement, which he signed at NATO headquarters. 
  Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Seimas opposition also 
gave his view on the signing of the agreement. 
  Here is Audrius Baciulis with the details: 
  [Baciulis] Brazauskas stressed that in the process of 
carrying out the Partnership for Peace program, the Lithuanian 
Armed Forces would grow stronger and come closer to NATO 
standards. The important point here is that the quality of the 
Armed Forces and not the quantity will change. At the moment it 
is too early to tell how much this will cost. Lithuania is 
receiving significant help from the Scandinavian countries. 
Britain has already undertaken the training of the 
peace-keeping unit. Of course, this is not a matter of one day 
but of a long period of time, Brazauskas said. It would not be 
serious to give you figures out of a hat, the president said, 
however, one must not forget that peace and stability involves 
considerable expense. 
  Brazauskas stressed that finances for the formation of the 
peace- keeping battalion would not be taken from the education, 
culture, or social security budgets. Already this week experts 
from Denmark and Germany will arrive in Lithuania to discuss 
possibilities for Lithuania to practically participate in the 
Partnership for Peace program. Some NATO states will help to 
set up the Lithuanian national security doctrine. Apart from 
this, NATO countries will send their experts [to advise] in the 
negotiations on military transit to Kaliningrad. 
  The possibility of signing a free trade agreement between 
Lithuania and the European Union this year and also the 
possibility of receiving the status of associated member of the 
European Union was discussed by Brazauskas during the meeting 
with Jacques Delors, chairman of the European Commission, in 
Brussels. Delors was in favor of such a possibility. 
  During the president's visit to the Netherlands, agreements 
on maritime transport and investment inducements were signed. 
During talks with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene 
agreement was reached to accelerate the signing of such 
agreements between Lithuania and Belgium. 
  Answering a question on whether the Partnership for Peace 
program guaranteed Lithuanian security, Brazauskas remarked that 
for some reason everyone wants security guarantees at once. Of 
course there are no specific security guarantees in the 
Partnership for Peace program as it would be in the NATO treaty. 
However, many important articles have been included in the 
program, for example, the possibility of inviting NATO 
consultants in the event of a threat, then there is joint 
military planning with NATO, and so on. When all this is put 
together you can see that the guarantees are given, Brazauskas 
said. 
  Landsbergis also gave his comments on the Partnership for 
Peace documents at his news conference today. He noted that the 
Partnership for Peace program was a framework for all the states 
and not just Lithuania alone. It is important how this 
framework will be filled, he said. 
  Because the agreement gives the right to hold consultations 
with NATO if danger arises, Landsbergis proposed that such 
consultants should be invited to Lithuania now. According to 
Landsbergis, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's latest 
statements, the events in Belarus and her statements with regard 
to Lithuania, already enables Lithuania to speak about a threat 
to the integrity of her territory. 
  Landsbergis drew attention to the fact that Brazauskas spoke 
very cautiously in Brussels and that his statements there were 
very cautious and reassuring for Russia. He expressed concern 
about the protracted negotiations on military transit to 
Kaliningrad. Such military transit may involve Lithuania into 
the structures of CIS military interaction, Landsbergis said. 
At the same time he did not reject the possibility that 
military transit to Kaliningrad through the territory of 
Lithuania could exist, however, this should be carried out on 
one-off agreements only and not on agreements. 
  The possibility of inviting international experts for the 
preparation of this agreement was regarded by Landsbergis as a 
shield and means for making the international community used to 
the idea of such an agreement.
