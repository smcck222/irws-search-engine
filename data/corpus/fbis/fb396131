  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 31, BNS -- Under the presentiment of 
an international threat, Lithuania could exercise its 
partnership right to invite NATO consultants to Lithuania, said 
the leader of the Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition. 
  Vytautas Landsbergis told reporters Monday [31 January] that 
consultants from NATO could have been invited to Lithuania 
during the signing of the Partnership for Peace program, to 
reflect on whether Lithuania is safe or not, confronted with 
Russia's current policy and certain statements of Belarus. The 
opposition leader said such a visit would enhance Lithuania's 
security. 
  Landsbergis said Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas' 
speeches in the West were very cautious and expressed a position 
on "joint movement" that is soothing to Russia. He said the 
president's thoughts about a security zone from Vancouver to 
Vladivostok "resembles explanations by the Russian foreign 
minister that Partnership for Peace is a Russian, not an 
American idea."

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 31, BNS -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas said the problem of border delimitation 
between Lithuania and the Kaliningrad region requires talks on a 
higher level than the region's administration. 
  At a press conference Monday [31 January], Brazauskas 
described relations with Russia as normal, which sometimes 
improve and sometimes get worse. He said Lithuania's statement 
on intentions to join NATO "left a certain shade" in bilateral 
relations. But when Lithuania signed Partnership for Peace, no 
comments followed from the Russian side, he said. "I think this 
is not such a bad sign." 
  Brazauskas said he raised the problem of Russian military 
transit through Lithuanian territory during his meetings at the 
NATO headquarters in Brussels. The president said he asked 
foreign experts to present their recommendations on the problem. 
  Brazauskas said he emphasized to representatives of NATO 
nations that Lithuania does not question the Kaliningrad 
region's subordination to Russia, which is a legal successor of 
the former Soviet Union. The president said Lithuania will 
continue talks with Russia and will carefully listen to the 
opinion of others. 
  Commenting on Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's 
forthcoming visit to Lithuania, Brazauskas denied suppositions 
that Lithuania might create a separate military alliance with 
Ukraine. "I don't think that having signed the Partnership for 
Peace program we can participate in any other alliance." The 
Lithuanian president said Lithuania and Ukraine should primarily 
discuss a number of economic issues.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 31, BNS -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas told reporters Monday [31 January] that he 
will use all of his constitutional rights to preserve a stabile 
government and parliament until the very end of their term. 
  The president said he was surprised by attempts of the 
six-seat Social Democratic faction to oust the government. 
  Brazauskas said the social democrats are either trying to 
gain popularity or to clear the way for other political forces. 
In his view, the Social Democratic Party can hardly expect 
wider representation in government structures. 
  Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the parliament's rightist 
opposition, said the initiative can be discussed only when the 
social democrats will show how many members of the ruling 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDLP] faction have signed 
under a petition demanding to take a no confidence vote in the 
government. "Otherwise, these are only senseless games or 
attempts to score political points," Landsbergis said at a press 
conference Monday. 
  The opposition leader said "the replacement of one LDLP 
government by a different LDLP government" would be an advantage 
only to the party in power, which, possibly uses the social 
democrats for the purpose. 
  Landsbergis said the ruling party would get an opportunity 
to 
say that nothing should be expected from a new government for at 
least six months. This would be a new possibility for the LDLP 
to defend itself against criticism, he said. 
  Last week, the social democrats proposed to take a no 
confidence vote in the government and urged other political 
forces to back their initiative.

<F P=106> [Report by Ona Stankeviciute: "Past Ghost Is Reviving"] </F>
  [Text] On 11-12 January, a conference of the "Curonian 
Spit" national park of the Russian Federation was held in 
Zelenogradsk (Kaliningrad Oblast). Apart from talk about the 
employment of local residents, environmental protection, and 
other issues, the mention of oil found in this area was casual 
as it were. Our neighbors, the Russians, intend to utilize this 
oil in the future by installing a DF-6 test drill. The 
Lithuanians would not feel anxious if it were not the same site 
that caused so many emotions in 1986. All intelligent people in 
Lithuania defended the Curonian Spit against the possible threat 
at that time. 
  Sensing huge profits, several German firms have submitted 
their construction projects. Although the final decision has 
not yet been adopted, Lithuania's fears may be valid. In case 
of an accident or some other emergency, southwest winds 
prevailing in this area would float all pollutants toward 
Lithuania's shores. All this risk would be undertaken only for 
a meager of oil resources which, according to scientists, equals 
the two-year processing capacity of the Mazeikiai refinery.

  [Text] While withdrawing from the Nemirseta base [near the

Soldiers of the Lithuanian Army stationed there also failed to 
clear them away. Our servicemen are now moving out, and there is 
no shortage of amateurs in search of gunpowder.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 01, BNS -- A group of Lithuanian 
experts dealing with visa and transit problems left for Minsk 
Tuesday [1 February], to discuss the introduction of visa 
requirements and the opening of new border crossings with 
Belarussian officials. 
  Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the group, said the two-day 
talks 
in the Belarusian capital will be mainly devoted to visa 
requirements for the CIS that will come into effect March 1. 
  Bulovas said he intends to hold several "semi-official" 
meetings in the Belarusian parliament and the Foreign Ministry. 
State border delimitation and the problem of the Adutiskis 
railroad station may be touched upon during these meetings, he 
said. 
  As previously reported, Lithuanian and Belarusian premiers 
signed an agreement last September saying that the Adutiskis 
station belongs to Lithuania, but some Belarussian lawmakers 
recently began to question the lawfulness of the decision and 
demand to revoke it. 
  Kazys Bobelis, chairman of the Lithuanian parliament's 
Foreign Affairs Committee, said it is necessary to determine 
border between Lithuania and Belarus as soon as possible and to 
start developing neighborly and trade relations. 
  Commenting on the replacement of the Belarusian head of 
state, Bobelis told Lithuanian radio Tuesday that a victory was 
won by politicians who advocate closer relations with Russia and 
whose policy is most likely to differ from that of the previous 
leadership of the parliament.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kestutis Gaska, Seimas deputy and former </F>
LDDP faction member, by Aldona Svirbutaviciute in Vilnius; date 
not given: "K. Gaska: `The Winner Must Think About Future 
Elections...'"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The reason for the interview 
with Seimas [parliament] Deputy Kestutis Gaska was clear. He 
decided not to register himself with the Lithuanian Democratic 
Labor Party [LDDP] faction. This decision was a long time in 
the making, and K. Gaska agreed willingly to explain the reasons 
that prompted him to make this choice. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] To what faction do you belong now? 
  [Gaska] Formally, I still belong to the LDDP faction, but I 
have said that I will not register with it. The question 
whether I will belong to this faction in the future would be 
more correct. No, I will not. Such is my inner principle -- I 
can no longer stay in this faction. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] What are the reasons? 
  [Gaska] My principles, as a Seimas deputy elected from the 
Varena region, do not comply with those of the LDDP faction. 
The latter works in isolation. It cannot or does not want to 
see anything else except the function of lawmaking. Almost all 
faction members have come to the Seimas according to the list 
and they do not have their constituents, with the exception of 
A. Kuncinas and N. Germanas who have their own electorate. I 
think that others, who do not have constant meetings with their 
constituents, cannot or do not want to understand their 
expectations. Their considerations are as follows: We have 
been elected, we must engage in lawmaking, and that is that. 
However, our constituents, who believe in the people they have 
elected, do not live according to such a model. A party that 
wins the elections must execute its program. Thus, the Seimas, 
the government, and the constituents must make a closed circle. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] Would you explain the principle of 
this "closed circle"...? 
  [Gaska] It is very simple. For example, I go to Varena and 
listen to my constituents. I select their key problem that I 
must raise in the Seimas, while the government must resolve it. 
Unfortunately, many members of our faction do not want to hear 
or know how these issues are settled. We must control the laws 
and resolutions that we adopt. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] You work in the Seimas National 
Security Committee. What are your achievements in implementing 
the laws adopted by the Seimas? 
  [Gaska] The situation in the Lithuanian Army is really 
catastrophic, due to both the lack of laws and the failure to 
execute them. Gentlemen commanders ignore the law, inflict 
psychological damage on young people, and cripple them. Where 
are we living? Who is responsible for all of those casual and 
senseless deaths? The Army is now conducting young people's 
genocide. No normal mother wants her child into go to the 
Lithuanian Army because it is ten times worse than the former 
Soviet Army. What are we doing? Therefore, I think that my 
position, as a Seimas deputy, is not adequate to the one that 
prevails among the community. We are too quiet, nourished, and 
pleased in the Seimas, while people see everything differently 
and ask us when we will take power and begin to govern the 
country. By the way, I am also interested in this. It is said 
that the winner must get ready for future elections. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] How do you imagine the new elections 
or preparations for them? 
  [Gaska] I think that our party leaders have secured seats 
for 
themselves. According to popularity ratings, there are constant 
top ten activists of our party who will win seats in the next 
elections as well. 
  I think that the LDDP will have the ensured 10 or 15 seats 
always, or at least in the upcoming elections. And me? All 
members of the LDDP faction council are confident that they may 
be elected in the future. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] You were in the LDDP program group 
which announced blatantly that it would work in a novel manner. 
One can say today, however, that there was too much ado about 
nothing.... 
  [Gaska] Exactly. We shook LDDP's monolithic system and 
exhausted ourselves. If one wants to create something, one must 
reason about it. We will always be able to leave by slamming 
the door loudly, but what of that? We neither ruined nor 
achieved anything. The current decision of the Constitutional 
Court on the free establishment of factions will enliven life in 
the Seimas. The fears of the LDDP faction leaders about this 
law were ungrounded. We went to the elections with one idea -- 
to rebuild a destroyed Lithuania. We will not run over to the 
opponents' side or do everything differently. Adherence to the 
principle of monolithic unity by the faction leadership is 
unreasonable. Finally, internal criticism is more painful than 
external criticism.... [passage omitted] 
  [Svirbutaviciute] Why have you chosen to work on the 
National Security Committee? Why did its members in particular 
begin to form the LDDP program group? 
  [Gaska] I wanted to work in the Foreign Affairs Committee 
because I have strong family relations abroad. I am alone in 
Lithuania, while two of my brothers and sisters, and my mother 
live in the United States. The faction asked me not to join 
this committee and choose another one. I picked the National 
Security Committee, although I was also invited to the Budget 
and Finance Committee. However, I chose such a virile committee 
with many stormy, stubborn, and strong people. Thus, restless 
people gathered in this committee. This might explain why the 
LDDP program group emerged here. It is good because only 
restless people can accomplish something positive. Sometimes B. 
Genzelis used to reprimand me, saying: "You are restless 
because you have not been appointed minister." Well, one can 
say so. I really withdrew from the faction to avoid becoming a 
minister. However, politics do not end here. Who knows who 
will come to power in three years? K. Gaska might become 
minister in the new government as well. Life does not end 
today. Eventually, I had no aim to become minister. Our goal 
was to disturb the quiet life of our faction. Thus, four of us 
from this committee undertook this initiative. 
  [Svirbutaviciute] Unfortunately, you failed to 
implement everything.... 
  [Gaska] We may succeed in the future. I believe that there 
are no less than 1 million people in Lithuania who will need a 
left-wing party. Our goal is to fight for their votes.

  [Excerpts] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest incidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  Combat operations on NKR's front lines have continued for 
nearly two weeks. Azerbaijan's leaders and military command 
headquarters are trying to resolve the Karabakh problem through 
the use of force. Thousands of mercenaries are fighting on 
Azerbaijan's side. Although the Azerbaijan National Army [ANA] 
units have succeeded in placing several areas under their 
control as a result of the violent clashes between the two 
sides, they have been unable to significantly change the 
situation. In fact, they have suffered many casualties and lost 
a significant amount of military equipment. More than 10,000 
Azerbaijani troops and mercenaries from various countries were 
killed at the NKR front line during the past two weeks. Many 
times more were wounded. 
  The ANA units lost a large quantity of military equipment. 
For example, 19 of their armored vehicles were either captured 
or destroyed until 25 January. Meanwhile, 16 tanks were 
destroyed. The ANA units lost two T-72 tanks and 70 men in the 
clashes that took place in the vicinity of Martuni on 27 
January. The enemy units were forced to retreat. Obviously, 
the loss the ANA units have suffered is significant. 
  The NKR Defense Headquarters has disclosed that combat 
operations are taking place on all battlefronts at the present 
time. Violent fighting took place in the northern part of 
Kelbadzharskiy Rayon on 30 January. The NKR units not only beat 
off the attacks but also counterattacked and forced the enemy to 
retreat. Combat operations are also taking place in 
Mardakertskiy Rayon. The Armenian fighters have repulsed the 
occupationist attacks and forced their units to retreat. 
Meanwhile, the situation in Agdamskiy and Fizulinskiy Rayons is 
tense. 
  Several observers believe that the ANA units have failed to 
achieve their objective despite making some advances. As we 
mentioned earlier, the ANA units' success has cost them 
significant casualties and loss of equipment. Azerbaijan will 
be forced to mobilize 45-year-old or 50-year-old men if the 
present state of affairs continues. [passage omitted] 
  Regrettably, a peaceful situation has not been effectively 
established on Armenia's border with Azerbaijan. The 
neighboring republic's military units have frequently fired on 
Armenian residential areas close to the border with various 
types of arms. The Armenian Ministry of Defense's Press Service 
has disclosed that the occupationist ANA units violated 
Armenia's border once again early this morning. Several enemy 
patrols attacked Movses in Tavushskiy Rayon at 0310. The 
Armenian border guards took retaliatory measures. The fighting 
continued until 0630 this morning. A significant blow was 
inflicted on the enemy units, which were evicted from the area. 
The Azerbaijani units lost several men. No one was hurt on our 
side. 
  No other incident occurred along Armenia's border until this 
afternoon. However, serious tension continues to exist in the 
region.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelyov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- Russia has put forward a 
new initiative suggesting to completely cease fire in 
Nagorno-Karabakh, beginning from February 1, 1994, for a minimum 
period of two-three weeks. 
  The Russian proposal to this effect was conveyed several 
days 
ago by a special representative of the Russian president, 
Vladimir Kazimirov, to the Azeri President Geydar Aliyev, 
Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Nagorno-Karabakh 
leader, Robert Kocharyan. 
  Depending on the reaction to this proposal by the sides 
concerned further steps are envisaged to cease combat operations 
in Nagorno-Karabakh. It is not ruled out that a meeting between 
the warring sides will take place in Moscow during this week. 
  Heavy fighting with alternative success have been going on 
around Nagorno-Karabakh since the second half of December, 1993. 
As a result of the bloodshed, several thousands people were 
reported dead and thousands others were injured, predominantly 
on the side launching an offensive. 
  New escalation of military operations is even more pointless 
because leaders of all warring sides admit that the conflict 
cannot be resolved by military means and come out in favour of 
its political settlement, a source from the Russian Foreign 
Ministry said. The repetition of the bloodshed seriously 
hampers peace-keeping efforts made both by Russia and 
international organisations, the same source said. 
  Russia, as a mediator, seeks to bridge the gap between the 
warring sides and convince them that they should immediately 
sign an agreement on the cessation of armed confrontation and 
prevent further destabilisation of the situation in the region. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev met with the head of 
Azeri foreign policy department, Gasan Gasanov, his Armenian 
counterpart, Vagan Papazyan, and a representative of the 
Nagorno- Karabakh leadership, Arkady Gukasyan, in Moscow in the 
second half of December, 1993.

  [Text] Yerevan, 31 Jan (ARMENPRES) -- The Armenian 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan received Vladimir Kazimirov, the 
Russian president's ambassador on special missions, upon the 
latter's return from Stepanakert. They discussed Russia's 
revised initiative for the resolution of the Karabakh conflict, 
and the proposals it has submitted to the sides for a temporary 
and universal cease-fire and halt in military operations as of 1 
February, pending the implementation of the measures envisaged 
in the initiative. 
  Kazimirov held talks with Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan 
Papazyan and the Armenian president's ambassador for special 
missions, Davit Shahnazaryan. 
  The Armenian side has officially given a positive reply to 
the Russian proposal. 
  Earlier, Kazimirov met in Stepanakert with the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic leadership, who reiterated their 
desire for a political resolution of the problem and their 
readiness to enter into talks.

  [Text] Stepanakert, February 1 (SNARK)--Karen Baburyan, 
acting as a chairman of the Karabakh Parliament, told Yerevan TV 
"The war should be finished and the problem could be solved only 
by negotiations". According to Baburyan, Nagorno-Karabakh and 
Armenia for many times showed their readiness to start the 
negotiations without any preliminary conditions, including the 
negotiations under the aegis of the intermediary missions. 
  Unfortunately, the official Baku took the opposite position. 
Saying "no" to the latest schedule of the necessary measures 
suggested by the Minsk group of the CSCE and the Russian peace- 
making initiatives, Azerbaijan follows the only way to solve the 
conflict -- by clashes. Baku also ignores all the attempts of 
the international community to achieve peace in the region -- 
Azerbaijan didn't send his delegation to the session of the 
European Council Parliamentary Assembly, Baburyan mentioned.

  [Text] At the request of the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities, 
the Armenian Foreign Ministry is now handling the issues related 
to the internationalization of the Karabakh conflict and is 
preparing corresponding messages to the UN Security Council 
chairman and the head of the CSCE Minsk group. This was stated 
in a document of the Armenian Foreign Ministry's department for 
public relations and press released in Yerevan on Monday. 
  The document says the reasons are the instances of Afghan 
mojahedeen involvement in the conflict on the side of 
Azerbaijan, the presence of a large quantity of Chinese-made 
arms in the Azerbaijani Army and British press reports, in 
particular, The Independent newspaper, about the possibility of 
British military aid to Azerbaijan. 
  At the same time, according to the Armenian Foreign 
Ministry, 
the above mentioned facts have not yet been officially 
confirmed. During diplomatic consultations the British, Afghan 
and Chinese sides denied information about any involvement in 
the Karabakh conflict.

<F P=106> [Report by Karen Topchyan: "Russians in Armenia: Should </F>
They Leave or Stay?"] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- The total number of Russian in Armenia 
is about 20,000-25,000, less than 1 percent of the country's 3.5 
million population. This is a drop in the ocean compared to the 
millions-strong Russian communities in other independent states 
of the former USSR. 
  Just a few years ago there were twice as many Russians in 
Armenia. They were concentrated in Yerevan and Vanadzor 
(formerly Kirovakan), as well as in Sevanskiy, Stepanavanskiy, 
Gugarkskiy, and Krasnoselskiy Rayons. However, the dramatic 
events in the once-flourishing Soviet republic have led to a 
significant exodus of a section of its inhabitants. Among them 
there have been many Russians. 
  According to Viktor Derega, counselor at the Russian 
Federation Embassy in Armenia on questions of migration, there 
are several reasons for this: the very acute economic 
situation, which has left not just individual enterprises but 
entire industrial sectors standing idle; the transport and power 
blockade, which has led to inhuman living conditions; and the 
fact that some border regions where Russians live, including 
Krasnoselskiy Rayon, are in the zone affected by Azerbaijani 
artillery bombardments.... 
  The Armenian parliament's adoption last summer of a language 
law which to all intents and purposes deprived a section of the 
Russian-speaking population of the opportunity to obtain an 
education in their native language had a negative effect. Even 
those in employment began to have some problems. Under this law 
all documentation in the republic's establishments and 
departments has to be in Armenian. 
  It is the opinion of "Russia" Society Chairman Galina 
Chernousova that this document will without doubt have to have 
further work done on it. 
  "We have already met with Armenak Kazaryan, minister of 
state 
of the Republic of Armenia," she says, "and he promised to 
assist in increasing the number of Russian schools in areas 
where our community is concentrated, particularly in Yerevan." 
  The question of setting up a Russian-Armenian university in 
the capital is also now being decided at the highest level. At 
the Russian community's request not only the Armenian but also 
the Russian leadership will play an active part in this 
undertaking. Incidentally, not only Russians but also Armenians 
will study in this higher educational establishment. After all, 
a great many representatives of the indigenous nation have not 
only been educated in the language of Pushkin, Tolstoy, and 
Chekhov but have become cultured thanks to the classics of 
Russian literature and art. 
  ...The following fact is very interesting: Three ethnic 
Russian organizations have been formed and are operating in the 
Republic of Armenia: the Society of Friends of Armenia, the 
"Harmony" International Center for Russian Culture, and the 
"Russia" Society. Galina Chernousova considers that the 
existence of several societies does not divide but on the 
contrary actually to some degree unites the ethnic Russian 
population, since each one on its own would hardly be able to 
draw in everybody living on Armenian territory. "Although 
nonindigenous nationalities live here no worse and no better 
than the Armenians," Galina Vasilyevna continues, "our main task 
is to help them in some way at least." 
  The Russian organizations' activities include the following 
areas: defending Russians' rights, charitable works, cultural 
life, education, and sociological research. 
  At the Russian community's request the Russian Federation 
Government recently sent the republic humanitarian aid in the 
form of 30 tonnes of food. In November "Russia" for the first 
time in several decades organized a competition for vocalists, 
to mark the 100th anniversary of Petr Ilyich Chaykovskiy's death. 
  In short, the first steps are being taken to unite the 
Russians in Armenia spiritually. This will definitely reduce 
the number of those wishing to leave the Republic of Armenia. 
In the end, the Russians in the republic are the basic link 
between Russia and Armenia.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] The Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is deeply 
concerned at statements made by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin at a press conference January 27, the ministry's 
statement reads. 
  The ministry is particularly concerned since Mr. Churkin's 
statement and responses to questions are but the latest in a 
series of appearances and articles by high-level Russian 
officials. Estonia hopes that Mr. Churkin's statements do not 
represent a new, even more confrontational and threatening line 
in Russian foreign policy vis-a-vis the Baltic States. 
  The ministry agrees with Mr. Churkin statement that "the 
Baltic states have a vital stake in the successful completion 
and final victory of democracy and implementation of market and 
economic reforms in Russia." There is nothing the Baltic states 
wish more than good neighbourly relations with their big 
neighbour to the east, peaceful relations which ensure the 
security, sovereignty and prosperity of all parties and, indeed, 
of all of Europe, the ministry said. 
  Estonia would like to view Russia as a normal state which 
meets normal international requirements and criteria. One 
obvious requirement is that Russia being a large country 
refrained from making statements which make its smaller 
neighbors nervous about Russia's true geo-political intentions. 
Other obvious criteria, such as the unconditional withdrawal of 
troops stationed on the territory of other nations against their 
will, should be met. Moscow's policy of seeking and creating 
special zones of interest and thereby, in practical terms, 
denying full sovereignty to its neighbors must stop. Russia 
should also stop denying basic human rights to Estonian citizens 
living under its jurisdiction. 
  While Estonia welcomes Mr. Churkin's "disapproval" of the 
events of 1940, the fact that he does not consider the Soviet 
take-over of the Baltic states "annexation or aggression or 
occupation" leaves out the most important legal and historical 
dimension of those events. 
  Mr. Churkin's statement and responses to questions contain 
numerous misstatements and errors of fact to which the ministry 
intends to respond in more detail. For a small nation, in the 
face of constant imperialistic-sounding threats and the 
continued presence of foreign occupation troops on its soil, to 
protect its sovereignty through all legal and peaceful means 
available cannot be viewed as "confrontational" in any sense of 
the word. Estonia has shown patience and good will and made 
many concessions in order to solve the problems it inherited 
from fifty years of Soviet occupation. The fact that Russian 
officials completely disregard Estonian efforts and instead keep 
up a barrage of propagandistic attacks and thinly veiled threats 
of military action does not help to build confidence or to 
ensure stability.

  [Text] Monday, January 31 -- Commander-in-Chief of the 
Defence Forces General Aleksander Einseln held a news conference 
on Saturday [29 January], answering to the recent accusations by 
some politicians of harming Estonia's reputation. The general 
rejected the accusations and explained that some of his 
expressions may have been caused by misunderstanding or 
inadequate translation. But he repeated his statement about the 
regrettable corruption in the Estonian society and added that 
his January 5 decree on combatting corruption in the army had 
gone unnoticed by the mass media and the government 
institutions. Only one private company had expressed its 
interests in the guidelines, he pointed out. 
  General Einseln also repeated his criticism of the Laanemaa 
Volunteer Rifle Company, which he had compared to the Nazi 
stormtroopers. The company, "an experimental unit organised by 
politicians", is completely useless to Estonia, he said, but 
refrained from further comments, since no definite decision had 
been made. He did express his opinion that forces outside 
Estonia may have been involved and also cited the judgement of 
the Finnish military expert, Colonel Matti Lukkari, of the Rifle 
Company. 
  The general further criticised the draft law on peacetime 
military service as useless in its present form and repeated his 
conviction that the defence concept must be approved by the 
nation. He rejected the accusations by MP [member of parliament] 
Katrin Linde and Minister Peeter Olesk, explaining that Linde 
had never discussed the matters she had included in her draft 
law. General Einseln pointed out that Olesk had not met him or 
asked for information concerning the Rifle Company affair before 
accusing him of failing to react to the events.

  [Text] Monday, January 31 -- President Lennart Meri met 
Russian Ambassador Alexander Trofimov at the latter's request on 
Friday [28 January]. Ambassador Trofimov handed over an answer 
to the letter sent to Russian President Boris Yeltsin on January 
5. Yeltsin discussed the problems the negotiations have failed 
to solve so far and expressed his hope that a mutually 
acceptable solution would be found. 
  The Estonian delegation is to leave for Moscow today for 
another round of negotiations. Head of the delegation 
Ambassador Vaino Reinart said that all four groups of issues -- 
military, border, humanitarian and economic -- will be 
discussed. He hoped that the basic agreement on the troop 
withdrawal may be initialled this time. But he admitted the 
existence of disagreements on the compensation of the 
environmental damage and the armament confiscated in 1940, as 
well as the ownership of military establishments and the 
jurisdiction of the Russian military units. 
  Head of the Russian delegation Vasili Svirin announced that 
the Russian delegation will hand over the accurate troops 
withdrawal timetable at the February 1-2 round of negotiations. 
He added that the Estonian side is attempting to replace the 
basic agreement with a brief protocol on the troops withdrawal.

  [Text] Petr Rozhok, Zhirinovskiy's [Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party leader] representative in Estonia, has appealed 
to retired Estonian servicemen to form defense units. Rozhok 
said that should it occur to some Estonian official to deport a 
Russian officer, the latter should look after himself first and 
foremost. If -- as he puts it -- some police control official 
or devil knows what kind of a representative should turn up, the 
officer will simply have to kick them out of his flat by force. 
In Rozhok's opinion, Estonia continues to be an ancient Russian 
territory. According to him, the Uusikaupunki peace treaty [of 
1721] and the 1975 Helsinki treaty have not been repealed by 
anyone. For this reason the retired Russian servicemen and 
reservists living in Estonia must know that they are living on 
ancient Russian territory. 
  Rozhok also thinks that all Russians living in Estonia 
should 
apply for Russian citizenship so as to feel the protection and 
support of the great Russia. According to Rozhok, he has been 
persuading Zhirinovskiy not to insert phrases like: Let us 
bring our tanks but threaten Estonia only with economic 
sanctions. 
  Commenting in the SILLAMAE GAZETTE on the claim that it is 
first and foremost Russian industrial workers who would be hit 
by economic sanctions, Rozhok says that the Russians have 
nothing else to lose anyway. 
  Speaking about Russian-speakers' organizations in Estonia, 
Rozhok rates highly the activity of the Russian Citizens' Union 
in Narva and its leader Yuriy Mishin, while calling the 
[Russian-speakers] Representative Assembly [in Estonia], an 
academy engaged in destroying Russian movements, parties, and 
organizations, under the baton of the Estonian Government.

  [Text] TAAS Israel Industries gave Kr [Krona] 20 Mn 
[Million] (8 Kr = 1 DM [German marks]) worth of weapons to 
Estonia as a gift. 
  Maje Preem, the Estonian Defense Ministry press secretary, 
told Interfax Monday that the weapons, in particular 
rapid-firing 23 mm guns, machine guns and other captured 
Soviet-made automatic weaponry, had arrived in Estonia last week. 
  In the press secretary's words, the gift was "a bit of a 
surprise" and no decision has been made as to who will receive 
it. 
  It arrived with a second lot of the Kr 40 Mn worth of 
weaponry that Estonia had earlier bought from the same company. 
(The first lot arrived in May 1993 - IF). 
  Estonia had signed a $49 Mn deal with the company on 
delivery 
of machine guns, assault rifles, rocket launchers and other 
weapons for the country's armed forces, border guards and police. 
  Some State Assembly deputies had criticized the deal, saying 
the government acted incompetently in making it and that the 
weapons were too expensive and did not meet NATO standards. 
(Estonia had officially announced before the deal was made that 
it would use those standards - IF). 
  The deal was discussed in parliament and ratified by it.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 31, BNS -- Estonian Interior Minister 
Heiki Arike said at a press conference today some changes in the 
structure of the country's police forces will be made in the 
near future. 
  Arike maintained Estonia is in the clutches of a confidence 
crisis which involves also the Interior Ministry and the police. 
  "The specific functions of some departments have not been 
defined clearly enough," the minister claimed. "This often gives 
rise to situations where a department, to establish its 
superiority to others, withholds vital information." 
  Arike said the Estonian police currently employs about 1,000 
detectives and only 600 officers; that is, more men are engaged 
in investigating crimes than in preventing them. 
  The interior minister pointed out the need for setting up 
economic security structures. The Estonian economic police so 
far works on an elementary level, he claimed. 
  Italy and Finland have offered Estonia assistance in 
training 
policemen investigating economic crimes. Italian experts are 
now in Estonia to prepare study plans for a seminar in March. 
  Arike said the authorities are also considering the 
formation 
of a special police unit to trace illegal aliens in Estonia. 
  The interior minister regarded policemen's knowledge of the 
Estonian language as a major problem. Under a government 
decree, all policemen who haven't by Feb. 1 passed the language 
exam are to be dismissed. Only those non-Estonian-speaking 
policemen's labor contracts may be extended who have a higher or 
a special police education. 
  "The dismissal of a great number of policemen at once is 
very 
dangerous," Arike said. "Those people know well the structure, 
the equipment and capacity of the police; if they should go over 
to crime, it would have terrible consequences." 
  The minister said the new head of the Police Department will 
be appointed within a month. At present Chancellor of the 
Interior Ministry Gero Kartau is the acting director general of 
the Police Department. Former director Igor Amann was dismissed 
on Jan. 14. 
  Arike said his ministry pays much attention also to 
regulating the relations between the ministry leadership and 
departments, and defining the functions of the ministry's 
subdivisions.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 31, BNS -- Pumping money into the 
police is not enough to guarantee security in Estonia, Interior 
Minister Heiki Arike told BNS at a press conference today. 
  In the minister's opinion, local governments should come up 
with money to install locks in the outer doors of big apartment 
houses, improve street lighting, and create systems to combat 
car stealing. 
  "This would certainly do a lot more good in the future than 
offering easy money to the police," Arike claimed. 
  The minister said his ministry is working out a national 
safety program. 
  "I don't think it is realistic to place hope in a pattern of 
a police state where strong police forces guarantee national 
security," Arike noted. "To achieve security, local governments, 
the police and all citizens must work closely together."

  [Text] Azerbaijan's state advisor for foreign policy Vafa 
Guluzade believes that no peace talks are possible as long as 
one fifth of Azerbaijan's territory is occupied by Armenia. 
  He told INTERFAX that Armenia's armed forces must be removed 
from Azerbaijani territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh. 
According to foreign sources, 8,000 Armenian citizens fight on 
the side of the so-called Karabakh forces, he said. 
  "Azerbaijan's position is absolutely clear: We must liberate 
our territories," he said. He also pointed out that Baku would 
like to do so without losses on either side. He believes that 
this is quite possible given Armenia's goodwill and Russia's 
determination. 
  Assessing the possibility of locating Russian peace-keeping 
forces in the zone of the Karabakh conflict, he said that these 
forces might be located on the Azerbaijani-Armenian border and 
between the conflicting parties after Armenia removes its forces 
from the occupied territory. He noted, however, that 
peace-keeping forces may be sent to a country only on the 
latter's request. 
  Speaking about the possibility of holding talks in Moscow 
between the Azerbaijani and Armenian presidents with the Russian 
president's mediation, Guluzade said that a proper political 
basis must be created for such talks. "If Russia acts as a 
mediator, it must find a common denominator for settlement," he 
said.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry today reported that 
heavy fighting continued today in the area of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 
  According to sources in Baku, the Armenians lost 7 tanks and 
2 armored vehicles over the last two days of clashes in the 
Ter-Ter, Agdam and Fizuli districts. Casualties among Armenian 
troops are measured "in hundreds," the same sources said. 
  The ministry also said villages of the Kedabek, Agdam, 
Ter-Ter and Fizuli districts of Azerbaijan and the village of 
Sadarak of the Nakhichevan autonomous republic came under heavy 
artillery fire yesterday. The shelling left one person dead and 
another two wounded. 
  Sources in the Azerbaijani parliament report that Milli 
Mejlis Chairman Rasul Guliyev is visiting Azerbaijani positions 
looking into the situation along the front line and the back-up 
of Azerbaijani units. 
  Meanwhile, the press office of the Nagorno-Karabakh army 
told 
INTERFAX that Nagorno-Karabakh units were re-gaining control of 
the highland pass Omar situated in the north of the Kelbajar 
district of Azerbaijan. The press office said Azerbaijani units 
suffered huge casualties both in personnel and hardware. Over 
the last 24 hours, Azerbaijanis lost over 150 troops, 4 tanks 
T-72 and 2 armored vehicles, while only 6 Nagorno-Karabakh 
troops were killed and 18 wounded, according to the press office. 
  The press office also said two Azerbaijani combat jets 
Sukhoi-25 bombed villages and Nagorno-Karabakh positions in the 
north of the Martuni district today at noon. According to 
preliminary reports, the bombing left victims both among 
servicemen and civilians.

  [Text] Baku, January 31 (TURAN) -- Fightings at the 
northern and north-western sectors of the front continued 
yesterday, a source at the Azeri Defense Ministry reports. 
  The Armenians attempted to reseize the recently lost 
positions. As a result of fierce fightings the attempts by the 
Armenian units to advance towards the town of Ter-Ter were 
suppressed. Two Armenian tanks, one armoured personnel carrier 
were destroyed and 15 Armenian soldiers were killed during these 
fightings. 
  In Kelbadzharskiy region (the northern sector of the front) 
the Armenian units attempted to seize back the hills and 
villages retaken by the Azeri Army a week ago. But the enemy 
failed due to the coordinated actions of the Azeri units. 
  At the southern sector of the front (Beylagan-Fizuli) 
fightings for the hills in the vicinity of the city of Fizuli 
continued. Due to the intensive activity of the Azeri artillery 
there, 5 Armenian tanks were destroyed and about 20 Armenian 
soldiers were killed. 
  A comparative calm is seen at the other sectors of the 
front.

  [Text] Baku, 31 Jan -- Talks between Gasan Gasanov, 
Azerbaijan foreign minister, and Vladimir Kazimirov, special 
envoy of the Russian president and Russia's roving ambassador, 
lasted more than two hours behind "closed doors" today. The 
Russian diplomat, who arrived in the republican capital after 
visiting Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, brought a draft agreement 
on cease-fire in the zone of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. 
  In an interview with journalists after completing the talks 
Vladimir Kazimirov stressed that during his trip to the region 
the issues raised at the recent meetings in Moscow of the 
Russian foreign minister with the heads of the foreign political 
departments of Azerbaijan and Armenia were discussed. In his 
view, the positions of the sides involved in confrontation 
remain inflexible. He expressed the hope that, as an initial 
measure, an accord on a general cease-fire will be reached 
tonight. 
  According to Gasan Gasanov, Azerbaijan would benefit from 
signing an agreement on truce, either short or long-term. The 
republic, he stressed, adheres to a position of political 
peaceful settlement to the conflict. If Armenia undertakes to 
withdraw its troops from Azerbaijan, the latter, in turn, is 
ready to "immediately start talks and sign an agreement," the 
minister said. At the same time, touching upon Armenia's 
position, the head of the republican foreign political 
department noted that it has not changed significantly and 
remains inflexible. "Armenia is still trying to talk to 
Azerbaijan from a position of strength," Gasan Gasanov stressed.

  [Text] Baku January 31 TASS--Azerbaijan insists that 
Armenia should pledge withdrawal from occupied territories 
before a ceasefire can be agreed upon, while a Russian mediator 
said the ceasefire should come first and should be accompanied 
by the withdrawal. 
  "If Armenia pledges to withdraw its forces from the 
territory 
of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan, in its turn, will be ready to 
immediately get down to talks and sign the (ceasefire) 
agreement", Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Gasan Gasanov told 
reporters after meeting Russian envoy mediating the settlement 
in Nagorno-Karabakh Vladimir Kazimirov on Monday. 
  "It is profitable for Azerbaijan to sign the ceasefire 
agreement --whether short or long-term. The republic continues 
to adhere to the position of a political and peaceful settlement 
of the conflict", Gasanov said, but hinted, however, that the 
possibility is vague because, according to him, the Armenian 
position had not changed considerably and remains tough. 
  "Armenia continues to try and talk to Azerbaijan from 
positions of force", Gasanov stressed. 
  Kazimirov, who had visited Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, 
agreed that the positions of both sides remain tough and urged 
them to be "more flexible". 
  "We would like to see more flexibility because the interests 
of the peoples whose blood is shed in the senseless conflict 
demand an early end to the bloodshed", Kazimirov said adding 
that Russia is ready to render any assistance in mediating a 
ceasefire. 
  He expressed hope that an agreement on a ceasefire beginning 
from this night will be reached and will become the first step 
towards a complete end to hostilities. 
  The complete end to combat activities should be "accompanied 
by the pullout of forces from seized territories, by the 
restoration of transport and energy-transmitting communications, 
by a return of refugees", Kazimirov said. 
  He complained that the warring sides "underestimate the 
necessity of an early end to hostilities" without which, 
according to him, it is impossible to efficiently settle the 
conflict. 
  Advantages in the military situation may go from one side to 
another while "people are paying for the calculations of 
political leaders", the Russian mediator said. 
  Both Gasanov and Kazimirov refused to say whether they had 
achieved any concrete results.

  [Text] Baku January 31 TASS -- Azerbaijan is ready to halt 
all combat actions in the zone of the Azeri-Armenian conflict 
provided the Armenian troops are immediately withdrawn from the 
occupied territories, President of Azerbiajan Geydar Aliyev said 
on Monday meeting Vladimir Kazimirov, special envoy of the 
Russian president mediating a truce deal in Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict. 
  Aliyev stressed that the war is going on on the Azerbaijani 
territory. "Nagorno-Karabakh which is an integral part of 
Azerbaijan and seven other regions outside Karabakh are 
currently under complete control of the Armenian troops", he 
said. 
  The president resolutely rejected media reports on major 
losses allegedly suffered by the Azeri army and said it is 
Armenians who sustain most losses. "The Armenian units are on 
the offensive and therefore suffer bigger losses. We are waging 
a just war and defend our land from the occupants", Aliyev said. 
  The president used the opportunity to appeal to the Armenian 
leadership and the nation to halt the senseless war. "As the 
president of Azerbaijan, I guarantee safety to all Armenians who 
reside in Nagorno-Karabakh and their equal rights with all other 
citizens of Azerbaijan", he said. 
  The president noted that his country will never agree to be 
dictated by force and will never "sign an agreement humiliating 
for our people and state".

  [Excerpts] The Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev received 
today the Russian president's personal representative Vladimir 
Kazimirov. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Is there any 
chance 
of yet another initiative by the Russian government succeeding? 
And, who stands to gain from Vladimir Kazimirov's visit to 
Azerbaijan? These were the questions which most concerned my 
colleagues who had come to shed light on the talks held today 
between President Geydar Aliyev and the Russian president's 
personal representative Vladimnir Kazimirov. 
  Vladimir Kazimirov again reiterated during this visit to 
Azerbaijan that Russia has not changed its previous proposals 
for the peaceful resolution of the conflict, and, in his 
opinion, it is far more appropriate and useful to renegotiate 
the peace conditions advanced during the previous consultations 
than to put forward a new idea each time. 
  Geydar Aliyev said that the Azerbaijani side has often 
supported the peace initiative and exerted every effort for the 
elimination of this meaningless war but every time the Armenian 
side attached no importance to these proposals. 
  Kazimirov noted that this time around the concrete aim of 
his 
visit to Baku was to submit proposals for the establishment of a 
cease-fire as of 1 February; and Russia calls on the sides to 
endorse this initiative by remaining in their present positions. 
  The Azerbaijani president replied to this proposal by 
advancing consistent and convincing evidence. [passage omitted] 
  Vladimir Kazimirov mentioned another point in an effort to 
have Aliyev change his mind. Kazimirov argued that a new 
chairman of CSCE Minsk Group has been appointed and it would be 
good if he took up his duties tomorrow morning with a report 
that a cease-fire has been achieved in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Geydar Aliyev's reply clarified this issue. [Aliyev 
statement in Russian omitted] 
  After the conversation, the republic's president announced 
his concrete proposals. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, and State Adviser Vafa 
Gulizade were also present at the meeting. [end recording]

  [Text] Baku, January 31 (TURAN) -- This evening President 
Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan received Special Russian Envoy 
Vladimir Kazimirov. During the talk President Aliyev said that 
Baku stands for the peaceful regulation of the conflict. But 
for this Armenia must withdraw its forces from all the occupied 
Azeri territories. "Since the aggressor continues occupying 
Azeri territories there is no sense to talk about the 
cease-fire," said President Aliyev. "Cease-fire talks can begin 
only after a complete withdrawal of the Armenian forces from the 
territory of Azerbaijan", he said. 
  President Aliyev called for the Armenian nation and the 
Armenian leadership to stop the aggression against Azerbaijan. 
"We will guarantee the safety and complete observance of the 
rights of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians as the citizens of 
Azerbaijan if they stop anti-governmental separatist actions", 
Aliyev stated. 
  TURAN's Moscow correspondent reports quoting a source at the 
Russian Foreign Ministry that Special Russian Envoy Vladimir 
Kazimirov arrived to Baku with a Russian plan of regulation of 
the Armenian-Azeri conflict. The key point of this plan is the 
stationing of the Russian troops in the conflict zone, i.e. in 
Nagorno-Karabakh and adjoining territories occupied by the 
Armenian forces. 
  According to Moscow's plan Russian units will be stationed 
at 
the territories where the Armenian troops will withdraw from. 
Russian troops will observe the adherence to a cease-fire by 
the parties to the conflict. 
  Meanwhile, Vafa Gulizadeh, Azerbaijani State adviser for 
foreign political matters told TURAN's reporter that "such 
forces should be stationed first of all along the Azeri-Armenian 
border, as Armenia is the exact aggressor". 
  Russian mass media report that Yerevan and Hankendi 
(Stepanakert) have already agreed to the implementation of the 
Moscow' plan. President Aliyev said in conclusion that 
"Azerbaijan will never agree to humiliating accords. We have 
enough forces for the defense of our country and its 
sovereignty."

  [Text] Baku, January 31 (TURAN) -- The day before Geydar 
Aliyev received the President of American Oil Company "AMOCO", 
Robert Blanton. 
  During the meeting they have discussed the perspectives of 
cooperation between State Oil Company of Azerbaijan and "AMOCO". 
In this connection, Robert Blanton said that the contract 
concerning development of "Azeri-Chirag" oil-fields by 
consortium of western oil companies was perspective as well. 
"AMOCO" is among the companies taking part in this project. 
  The conclusion of this contract is of strategic significance 
for Azerbaijan. According to Geydar Aliyev, the "terms of the 
contract are 30 years. That's why before signing such a 
contract we have to examine everything in details". Aliyev 
stressed that the leadership of SOCAR [State Oil Company of 
Azerbaijan] did not agree with the previous terms of the 
contract worked out by independent expert group led by Manaf 
Manafov. "We need two-three weeks to clear everything up", said 
Geydar Aliyev. 
  So, Azerbaijani leader did not answer the main question: 
will Baku sign the contract with Western oil companies 
concerning development of Caspian offshore oil-fields or not? 
  Meanwhile, Western companies, the members of oil consortium 
are afraid that such contract would not be signed at all. One 
of the officials of oil companies told a TURAN's reporter that 
"we will wait two-three more months and then we will wrap up our 
work". The same official said in case if Azerbaijan refused to 
sign the contract, they would start their activities in 
Turkmenistan or Kazakhstan.

  [Text] Baku, January 27 (TURAN)--The government of the UK 
has decided to give Azerbaijan special equipment, including 
computers and computer training read the official report from 
the British Embassy in Baku. 
  This equipment will enable Azerbaijan to switch over to the 
communication system within the CSCE framework. This 
communication system will provide direct, uninterrupted 24-hour 
communication among the capitals of the CSCE-member states. 
  The UK Embassy states that this communication system makes 
possible the exchange of information within the framework of the 
Vienna agreement on the Reduction of Conventional Weapons in 
Europe. The report also states that in contrast with offers to 
the other CIS states, no other state offered assistance to 
Azerbaijan in this matter. Taking this fact into consideration, 
the UK decided to give this equipment to Azerbaijan. 
  The British equipment will be delivered to Baku and begin 
functioning in the near future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgian Economy Minister Mikhail Dzhibuti </F>
by Irina Adamashvili; place and date not given: "Mikhail 
Dzhibuti: `...Becoming Minister Again!'"] 
  [Text] SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA dossier: Mikhail Dzhibuti is 39 
years old. He graduated from the Economics Faculty at M.V. 
Lomonosov Moscow State University and completed his postgraduate 
studies at Tbilisi State University. He defended his 
candidate's dissertation in 1980 and his doctoral thesis in 
1990. He has been a professor at Tbilisi State University since 
1991. Between 1988 and 1993, he was head of department at the 
Georgian Academy of Sciences Institute of Economics. He began 
his political career in March 1992 when he became government 
adviser on economic questions. In October of that year he was 
elected to Parliament. In November, he was appointed Republic 
of Georgia minister of the economy. 
  He is married and has two daughters. 
  On 10 December 1993, Mikhail Dzhibuti resigned. 
  [Adamashvili] The plaque outside the office of the minister 
of the economy still bears your name. Has your resignation been 
accepted and how has the government responded to it? 
  [Dzhibuti] As it was solely my decision to quit my functions 
as minister, it can only be a question at this stage of when a 
successor will be appointed. 
  My decision was taken not for the usual reasons of family 
circumstances or health; I resigned in order to draw the 
public's attention to the chaos that exists in the management of 
the economy. 
  The reaction to my resignation was the same as that when 
dead 
people are being discussed, that is to say when nothing is said. 
The entire reaction came down to the level of human feelings 
being hurt: Why didn't Dzhibuti warn us? Surely, our relations 
didn't merit this? And so forth. For me personally, this is 
more insulting than anything. After all, I am on friendly terms 
with many people in the Cabinet of Ministers and I have not 
rejected these relations. I do not agree with the activities 
that the current Cabinet of Ministers is implementing in the 
economic sphere. Of course, it is possible to name those 
principally involved but, nonetheless, it is a question of 
collective responsibility. Each member of the Cabinet of 
Ministers is responsible for the policy conducted by the 
government. I dissociate myself from the Cabinet of Ministers 
as a whole and from its individual members precisely as far as 
this responsibility is concerned. 
  [Adamashvili] What caused you to resign? By what thoughts 
were you guided in taking this step? 
  [Dzhibuti] A connection exists between a system and 
subsystems. A system is made up of subsystems. However, the 
characteristics of a system are something more than the simple 
total of subsystems. The characteristics of a system do not 
repeat the characteristics of any one of the subsystems of which 
it is made up, whereas any subsystem in a system bears the 
characteristics of the system. This can be applied to the 
Cabinet of Ministers where any minister is like a subsystem. 
When the Cabinet of Ministers acquired the antireformist 
characteristics of a system and the sphere of activities of this 
system -- parliament and the head of state -- did not repulse 
this immediately, this situation became unbearable for me with 
my outlook and capabilities. 
  I thought that my resignation would serve as an SOS and that 
economic policy would become a subject of serious discussion. 
Unfortunately, this has not happened. Neither in the government 
nor in parliament nor in economic institutions and faculties.... 
All this confirms the state of dreadful torpor not only of 
those managing the economy but also of general economic thinking 
and emphasizes the casual approach to the economy in all 
segments of society and among all politicians. 
  [Adamashvili] You have said that the reason for your 
resignation was your disagreement with the forceful methods used 
to manage the economy. How did pressure from the government on 
your branch specifically manifest itself? 
  [Dzhibuti] In Georgia, the Soviet style of managing the 
economy has not changed. There has been no reform of 
macroeconomic, branch, regional, and microeconomic management. 
Socialist enterprises prevail in industry and collective farms 
in agriculture and supply depots and auctions in the sphere of 
trade. Almost half of agriculture is subordinate to the 
Ministry of Defense. That is to say, everything that existed 
under the Soviet system has not been touched, including the 
administrative style of management. True, this management is 
not having as great an effect as it used to since the communist 
binding mechanism does not exist. However, the directorate is 
not in a hurry to implement reforms. It likes being the boss 
even among ruins. This also does not run counter to the 
interests of the ministries in charge. State ownership was as 
big a fiction as public ownership under the Soviet system. In 
actual fact, all property was in the hands of the nomenklatura 
and this is how it has remained to this day. Only a reform of 
the system can create state ownership before which both 
directors and ministers will appear not as lords but as 
employees. Political pressure on the economy is also being 
determined by the fact that the destruction of the district 
soviets has proved meaningless while managers are, in the main, 
"Soviet." 
  [Adamashvili] What have you personally done in order to 
break through the situation that has taken shape? In what 
instances were you hindered and prevented from acting in what 
you considered to be the right direction? 
  [Dzhibuti] I have done everything in order to expound an 
economic strategy and tactics in the form of a document. Such a 
document should have become a guide to action for all branches 
of management. By following it, it would have been possible to 
have overcome the obstacles of mentality and ignorance. At the 
same time, it would have been possible to have judged the 
activities of certain managers and levels of management. A 
program aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability and 
implementing system changes was contained in this document. A 
draft indicative plan for 1993-95 was drawn up.... 
  I think one cannot pick out individual cases when I was 
hindered. The obstacle was a permanent one as, for example, of 
the two draft government decrees, one either contradicted an 
earlier decree adopted by the government or was aimed at 
restoring administrative management and individual power. 
  [Adamashvili] How do you view the situation that has taken 
shape in the republic's economy today? What timely measures 
should have been taken to prevent the crisis and the plunging of 
the coupon? What else can still be done in order to save 
Georgia's economy? In what direction should we work? 
  [Dzhibuti] One can characterize the situation as follows: 
the chaos of disorder. The crisis and the coupon are 
incommensurable quantities. Let's begin with the crisis. 
  There are several qualitatively different reasons for the 
economic crisis in Georgia as well as for that in all 
postcommunist states. The first set of reasons have nothing to 
do with internal republican factors: These are the collapse of 
the Soviet Union and Russia's obvious or not so obvious attitude 
to events in Georgia. The second set of reasons are of a 
republican nature: The conflicts in the Tskhinvali zone and 
Abkhazia, the civil war, internal political disorder, and so 
forth. 
  In general, it was impossible to prevent the crisis. 
However, it would have been possible to have reduced it by 
removing the internal republican reasons. 
  As for the coupon, it is connected with the state of the 
economy and the monetary and credit policy. Depending on what 
this policy is, the devaluation of the coupon can be halted 
within a very short period of time. Everything here depends on 
who is managing the economy and how. The general strengthening 
of the currency depends on the restoration of the strength of 
the republic's economy. The coupon itself, that is to say the 
national currency, is not the reason for the crisis. On the 
contrary, we have survived almost a year with just the coupon. 
Since November 1992, Georgia has received no kind of assistance 
to strengthen its currency system. In addition, a national 
currency represents the foundation of an autonomous economic 
system without which political independence does not exist. 
  In order to save Georgia's economy, we have to refrain from 
social experiments and implement the declared policy of economic 
reform and not put spokes in the form of legal nihilism in the 
wheel of natural economic development due to ignorance, 
dilettantism, and personal profit. We have to work toward 
improving people's lives and in so doing, we must follow the 
path of civilization and not unexplored tracks in our history. 
  [Adamashvili] In the event that your resignation is not 
accepted, will you agree to continue in your former position and 
under what conditions? 
  [Dzhibuti] At the given stage, unless circumstances change, 
my decision remains final. However, if a reformist-minded 
Cabinet of Ministers is formed and guarantees are given that the 
system transformations contained in those programs and the 
indicative plan in which I participated will be implemented and 
the opportunity presents itself, I will work with pleasure and 
with no less responsibility on implementing the transformations. 
  There has probably not been a minister anywhere in the world 
who, having resigned, has not thought about becoming minister 
again!

  [Excerpts] [Presenter Nato Oniani] Good morning, friends. 
As always on Monday, we present to you a traditional radio 
interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of parliament and 
head of state. 
  Batono Eduard, in connection with President Yeltsin's visit 
[to Georgia on 3 and 4 February], you said the following: This 
is the most important event in the hundreds of years of history 
of relations between Russia and Georgia. Before, Russia's 
Soviet leaders would be visiting a periphery, while today the 
leader of one of the world's greatest countries is coming to an 
independent country. The president of a friendly neighboring 
country is visiting us as equal partners. What are the grounds 
for such a statement? Is it a Russian foreign policy as regards 
Georgia? Is it that the world is different today? Or is it 
Georgia's status, the fact that Georgia is, at least de jure, an 
independent state? 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. The grounds for 
what I stated are in the law which has not yet been passed, but 
which will become the rule of life on our planet at the end of 
the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. What is 
unacceptable for and incompatible with the new rules of 
cohabitation, the new principles -- I mean former Yugoslavia, 
the former Soviet Union, including Abkhazia, Samachablo [South 
Ossetia], and some others...[pauses] In my opinion this is an 
anomaly, a vestige of the old reactionary and obsolete thinking 
and practice. 
  The epoch of violence, the epoch of the rule of arms as they 
say, must end, and I am sure it will end. The next century must 
be a century of universal ideals taking root. The foundation of 
this is now being laid. We can see and feel that that time is 
coming. However, these new relations have to be built. The new 
century, the new order, this new construction consists of bricks 
and [word indistinct]. One of such bricks is the new relations 
between Russia and Georgia. These new relations should heal our 
sores, be it Abkhazia, the Georgian-Ossetian conflict, economic 
hardship, or something else which accompanies the birth of an 
independent country. The birth process is painful by itself. I 
am sure that these pains will go away and a new time will come. 
  Speaking in general and without going into detail, this is 
how I see relations between Russia and Georgia and their 
prospects. These are my hopes. 
  One more thing. I think that such an approach to these 
problems and issues -- the building of relations among the 
countries of the former Soviet Union on the model of relations 
between Russia and Georgia, and enshrined in the documents we 
are now preparing -- is in Russia's interests. Not only 
Georgia's own interests are involved in this but also Russia's 
interests. One can talk about Russia's new role at this complex 
and tense time on our planet. 
  [Oniani] Such relations must develop between Georgia and 
Russia. However, the most important subject of discussion at 
present, during these talks, will be the problem of Abkhazia. I 
will remind the listeners about something you said last week. 
Georgia has a lot to say [at the Russo-Georgian summit]. We 
need a lot which cannot be solved without Russia. First of all, 
this relates to Abkhazia. 
  On 10 February the Georgian refugees are to return, 
initially 
to Gali rayon. Who can give guarantees to the population of 
Abkhazia, the refugees, especially in the light of recent events 
in the Kodori gorge? 
  [Shevardnadze] Speaking about the old Soviet space, in 
relation to Georgia in particular, we must pay attention to the 
fact that a new model for settling conflicts is emerging -- a UN 
effort combined with a Russian peace mission. I do not want to 
explain this in detail because everybody can see what we are 
dealing with. Such an approach will be important for the modern 
world, for Georgia and maybe for other countries as well. 
  The UN potential is limited at present. Everybody can see 
this. My experience tells me that the UN is simply unable to 
cope with all conflicts. Realistically speaking, I think that 
in the example of our conflict the UN can act as a facilitator 
in settling the conflict. It can deal with issues relating to 
the creation of a legal foundation. 
  [Oniani] So, in general, it could be a mediator but not a 
doer. 
  [Shevardnadze] Becoming a doer is a difficult process. Today 
a UN Security Council meeting is to be held. I know 
approximately what kind of resolution the Security Council will 
adopt. This again will not be a direct participation in 
settling and solving the conflict. Therefore, I think that 
combining the UN potential and Russia's new role and approach -- 
a model which is to be tested on our example -- is rather 
promising. I attach a certain degree of hope and optimism to 
that. 
  As for the return from 10 February, it is difficult to talk 
about it now because, speaking of real guarantees, the results 
of the talks between Russia and Georgia should produce such 
guarantees. That is because, physically and practically, UN 
forces will not have time to enter the area [before the 10 
February deadline]. 
  I understand people who feel that we should start to return 
[to Abkhazia] from 10 February. I think it is right to look at 
the issue this way. 
  [Oniani] Your statements regarding new relations between 
Russia and Georgia must have irritated the Abkhazian side. I 
remind you of their recent statements. They gave a negative 
assessment of Russia's role. The Abkhazian authorities are 
irritated by new Georgian-Russian relations; for example, 
Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. In their opinion, Russia is biased 
in our favor in its involvement in Abkhazia. Are there any 
grounds to justify this? Can one say that this is a result of 
steps taken by Georgian diplomacy? 
  [Shevardnadze] I do not think that we can speak now about 
our 
successful steps. You know that a lot has irritated us in this 
conflict. A lot has been said. However, irritation is a bad 
symptom when one speaks about high-level politics, big national 
interests, be it Abkhazian, Georgian, or Russian interests. 
Therefore, we must all reconcile ourselves to the fact that 
there are certain principles which should be obeyed by all 
nations, large and small. 
  [Oniani] Batono Eduard, last week you met representatives 
of law enforcement bodies. Among other things, the meeting 
heard that it is necessary to finally establish and make public 
who is behind the gangs which have been arrested. It was also 
said at the meeting that the state apparatus would be examined 
for drug addiction. You said that you could be the first to 
take a blood test. There is talk that many persons were 
arrested but later released, and that these measures stop at a 
certain level. 
  [Shevardnadze] I was more specific in my address which was 
broadcast. Now I would put it this way. Every week and day of 
our life has its own features. Last week we summed up the 
results of the state of emergency, discussing what the state of 
emergency gives us in practice. I would say that despite 
everyday difficulties the results are impressive. I will list 
some results. The situation in the west [of Georgia] has 
improved. There are no words to describe this. Perhaps it can 
be said that we extinguished an incipient inferno of civil war. 
Work at the Security and Interior Ministries has changed. In 
practice, one can talk about a completely new approach toward 
work at these power ministries. Their improved style of work is 
aimed at meeting current demands. A campaign against the 
criminal world and the mafiosi has been launched. A tax system 
has been created. There is also much more which was mentioned 
at the meeting. 
  When I said that the whole truth must be said and a spade 
must be called a spade, I meant that unless this happened, the 
process of establishing order would be painful and long. This 
must happen by all means. I am not in favor of punishing 
everyone and sending everyone to prison. 
  [Oniani] Assessments must be made. 
  [Shevardnadze] Assessments must be made and people should 
know the truth about everyone. [Words indistinct] That I will 
be the first to take a blood test. I meant that drug addiction 
is a scourge of modern times, which threatens the country and 
future generation with an explosion. An anti-drug campaign 
should be initiated by the state. People who do not have the 
moral right to do it should not lead a struggle against drug 
addiction. Therefore, state organizations and power ministries, 
such as the Interior, Defense, Security Ministries, and so on, 
must be purged of such elements. When I say purged, I do not 
mean that these people should be cast out on to the street. 
Some of them should be treated, while others should be given 
assistance as soon as possible. However, such cleansing is 
certainly necessary. 
  I do know about the legal aspects of such a matter. Some 
people may regard the blood test as a human rights violation. 
Some people may be unwilling to take a test. That is why I 
decided -- I think no one has any doubt that I am not afraid of 
taking a blood test [Shevardnadze laughs] -- that this process 
should start with me and the head of state's office. My office 
will be told about it today and I think that this work will be 
completed today or tomorrow. 
  [Oniani] You mentioned your meeting with law enforcement 
bodies. It is common knowledge that good order and economic 
performance are interlinked. As soon as there are even small 
signs of stabilization, the country will be able to breathe more 
easily. However, the inflation of the coupon is continuing at a 
terrible pace. At a parliament meeting, the prime minister 
requested 10 days for a program aimed at strengthening the 
coupon. 
  Two options are suggested. The first one is to leave the 
coupon as a sole legal form of tender. The second option is to 
introduce an alternative currency. What do you think will save 
the Georgian coupon today? To what extent will the coupon be 
supported with the notorious 200 million [currency not 
specified], which, in the former premier's opinion -- I am sorry 
to say this -- you have concealed? 
  [Shevardnadze] We are dealing with the most serious question 
here. I would like again to remind our listeners, our citizens, 
that when, at the Cabinet of Minister's proposal, a decision was 
made to introduce the coupon, I immediately said that the coupon 
would lose its value. Nothing else could have happened. 
Perhaps this process was speeded up by a bad credit policy or 
some other subjective factors, but sooner or later this process 
would have started anyway. Those who consider the coupon issue 
separately from economic matters are wrong and are not familiar 
with the subject. 
  There are also suggestions that it is time to think about 
the 
lari, and that perhaps the lari can help us. Neither the lari 
nor any other new currency will save the country unless the 
economy starts to improve. 
  This is one of the reasons why I think that President 
Yeltsin's visit, during which many economic treaties are to be 
signed, will be an historic event. In addition to what has 
already been done to strengthen our economic ties, this will be 
one of the ways to adopt [word indistinct] as soon as possible. 
If ties are quickly restored and if new ties are established, 
the economy will be revitalized, which will allow the coupon to 
become stronger and will allow us to think about a new currency, 
the lari. 
  The second option is to obtain large credits. If we receive 
say, 200 million or 300 million [currency not specified] -- 
which to be honest is not much -- it will still not be enough to 
revitalize the economy and strengthen the coupon, for which at 
least $1 billion is needed. However, even $100 million or $200 
million could help us to a certain extent. 
  I have not taken the allegations [by Sigua] seriously. Some 
materials have already been published in the SAKARTVELOS 
RESPUBLIKA. I want to say now with total honesty that the public 
should know everything. What are we dealing with? It was a 
very important letter from the International Monetary Fund 
which, although it did not contain assurances, gave Georgia 
prospects for receiving a certain amount of credit and economic 
assistance. This letter was concealed. It was concealed from 
us. How did a copy of it end up with Prime Minister Tengiz 
Sigua? The original is said to have been lost. Meanwhile, he 
kept a copy of it at home. He was prime minister twice. Would 
he keep copies of all documents at home? I believe that our 
citizens should think about it. 
  There was another letter. The first letter has been 
published in the press and I demand that the second letter be 
published as well -- the one which I (?referred) to Roman 
Gotsiridze [former Georgian deputy premier in charge of economic 
reform], asking him to study it urgently and to put forward his 
proposals. He has left the Cabinet and [words indistinct]. 
  [Oniani] Excuse me, Batono Eduard, let me ask you to return 
to the notorious letter which Tengiz Sigua spoke about. Did he 
ever tell you that this letter existed, and was he ever 
interested in hearing your opinion about it. Has there ever 
been any conversation between you two about it? 
  [Shevardnadze] My morals do not allow me respond to an 
allegation with a counter-allegation. However, let us take into 
account my correspondence with and my requests to the IMF 
regarding credits. How did we get the 70 million ECU [European 
Currency Unit] credit from the European Community? How many 
personal requests and appeals have I made? These include my 
letters to the G-7 which, I would say, man would not be able to 
read without tears in the eyes, and which were full of pleas for 
help; my visit to Germany, as a result of which we received 30 
million German marks [DM] as an interest-free long-term credit 
and DM20 million in humanitarian assistance; my requests to the 
Turkish leadership, which gave us 50 million dollars [not 
further specified] in credit, and much more. Could a man who 
has travelled the world begging for a few pennies in credit have 
left such a promising (?letter) unnoticed? 
  I think that it is very good that the press has reacted to 
this, but there is still more to be established. The letter 
should be published. I wonder why Mr. Gotsiridze did not act 
[words indistinct]. 
  I am not saying this in order to settle scores [words 
indistinct] but to explain that if we are able to get more 
loans, credits, and assistance, then the coupon may become 
stronger more quickly. If there is no assistance -- I will be 
able to speak about it in more detail after my visit to 
Washington, during which I will meet the Monetary Fund and 
others -- then it will be a more painful process which will 
solely be linked with revitilizing and improving the economy. 
  [Oniani] Batono Eduard, last week saw the creation of a 
youth 
organization within the Citizens' Union of Georgia. What is the 
significance of this event? Has the Citizens' Union split up? 
  [Shevardnadze] No, it has not. [passage omitted] Why should 
the creation of a youth organization within the Citizens' Union 
surprise anybody? I know that some people say that the 
Citizens' Union has created a version of the Komsomol, [word 
indistinct] organization, and so on. They do not know the 
history of international movements. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- The Georgian public is 
increasingly inclined to believe that Georgia's future is 
connected more with Russia rather than with the West, according 
to the results of a blitz public opinion poll conducted by the 
local newspaper "FREE GEORGIA." 
  A total of 51.2 per cent of respondents said that the 
forthcoming visit by the Russian president to Georgia will have 
a positive impact on the improvement of relations between the 
two countries, having age-old historical, economic and 
humanitarian ties. 
  Only 37.6 per cent of respondents were skeptical about the 
future of Russo-Georgian relations, while 4.7 per cent expect 
Russo-Georgian relations to worsen.

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Pavshentsev: "Yeltsin Awaited in </F>
Tbilisi"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The Russian president's coming visit to 
Georgia 3 February is currently at the center of attention of 
people in the republic, but attitudes to this event -- as was to 
be expected -- are highly ambiguous. 
  Although most political parties are to one extent or another 
pinning definite hopes on settling relations with their northern 
neighbor, Georgia's most radical political forces continue to 
back confrontation with Russia. 
  These include Boris Kakubava, leader of the Abkhazia 
Liberation Organization, who has called on the public -- 
primarily on Abkhaz refugees living in Tbilisi (there are 
currently around 60,000 of them in the capital) -- to stage 
protests during the visit over "Russia's interference in 
Georgia's internal affairs in the course of the Abkhaz conflict" 
and to pin responsibility on Russia for defeat in the war. 
  A similar statement was issued by Irakliy Tsereteli, leader 
of the Georgian National Independence Party. He believes that 
President Yeltsin should know that there are forces in the 
republic which are by no means delighted about Russia's policy 
on Georgia. 
  Admittedly, the supporters of street protest demonstrations 
are not particularly popular at the moment. The dominant 
opinion in society and among most political parties is that 
political pragmatism should prevail. People in Tbilisi are 
confident that many of Georgia's political and economic problems 
will be settled during the talks. "However different the 
opinions in our political circles over Russia's policy with 
regard to Georgia, it remains a fact that Georgia cannot leave 
Russia's sphere of influence overnight and move to the West's 
sphere of influence. Things need to be looked at realistically. 
On this basis, we hope that aspects of our future relations 
with Russia," Temur Zhorzholiani, chairman of the Georgian 
Conservative Monarchist Party, said in an interview with this 
PRAVDA correspondent.

  [Text] Representatives of the Abkhaz government are urging 
Boris Yeltsin to postpone a visit to Georgia. On 29 January 
Yuriy Voronov, deputy chairman of the Abkhaz Council of 
Ministers, appealed to delegates of the second World Congress of 
Russian Unity to send a request to Boris Yeltsin to postpone his 
visit to Tbilisi. 
  In Voronov's opinion, the Russian president's visit to 
Georgia could result in bloodshed in Abkhazia because among the 
documents to be signed is an agreement on major deliveries of 
Russian military equipment to the Georgian army. Voronov said 
that Yeltsin's previous two visits to the region led to military 
conflicts, first in South Ossetia and then in Abkhazia. 
  Yuriy Voronov also called for the scrapping of special 
procedures on the Russian-Abkhazian border which are aggravating 
the crime situation in the border area.

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze stated that a 
thaw in Georgian-Russian relations was opposed by the Abkhazian 
leaders, because it undermined their separatist policies. 
  He told a closed conference in Tbilisi on Sunday that ways 
of 
settling the conflict in Abkhazia would figure prominently in 
the talks during Boris Yeltsin's visit beginning February 3. 
  This conference was attended by members of the organizing 
committee for Boris Yeltsin's visit, and details about it 
reached Interfax through well-informed sources in Tbilisi. 
  Shevardnadze announced that the Russian delegation would 
include Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev, and St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy 
Sobchak. 
  It was also announced that the guards of honor's uniforms 
did 
not meet the required standards and that new uniforms would be 
made for them within the next couple of days. In addition, it 
was indicated that the guards of honor are not properly trained 
either, while the military band's professional standards leave 
much to be desired, so the band of the Russian army group 
stationed in the Trans-Caucasus may be asked to play. 
  New motorcycles have been brought to Georgia for use in the 
honorary escort. Tbilisi's best hotel, Metekhi, will 
accommodate a press center which will maintain international 
telephone communications. 
  Some of Boris Yeltsin's security guards and part of the 
Russian delegation (consisting of a total of 46 members) have 
already arrived. 
  The Russian delegation is expected to have about 200 
members.

  [Text] According to the Abkhazian Defense Ministry, during 
the past few days several assaults on Abkhazian military 
servicemen have been committed in the Galskiy region of the 
republic. 
  A car of the Abkhazian Armed Forces was shelled near the 
village of Otobaya on January 29. As a result, two soldiers 
were wounded and one killed. 
  Another 4 mutilated corpses of Abkhazian soldiers were found 
near the village of Sida. The Defense Ministry said that "all 
this was done by subversive groups of the Georgian Armed Forces." 
  A statement made public in Sukhumi on Monday says that in 
January 1994 units of Georgian gangsters had become more active 
in the Galskiy region. 
  Several crossings into the territory of Abkhazia by Georgian 
military groups were registered in January. 
  According to reports from Sukhumi, as a result of subversive 
and terrorist acts in the past 20 days alone 25 Abkhazian 
servicemen and 12 civilians were killed, and about 15 soldiers 
wounded. 
  The Defense Ministry stated that "it cannot tolerate such 
actions by Georgian group of gangsters and their supporters in 
the Galskiy region" and "will take decisive measures to 
eliminate them."

  [Text] We have just received a press release from the press 
service of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet, stating that a wave of 
rallies has started in Abkhazia in defense of the republic's 
independence. The multi-ethnic people of Abkhazia believe that 
the upcoming Russo-Georgian negotiations, the summit meeting, 
and the signing of an agreement, starting without a full 
settlement of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict, could lead to 
another escalation of military action.

  [Text] Tbilisi January 31 TASS--A Georgian daily has for 
the first time publicly voiced the idea to turn Georgia into a 
federal state which can be assessed as a reconciliation hand 
extended to the rebel region of Abkhazia. 
  "Taking into consideration the experience of other countries 
and the current political situation it is necessary to recognise 
the necessity of a federal structure of Georgia", the 
Tbilisi-based "TEMI" (Assembly) newspaper said. 
  "Actually we are living today in a federative state without 
a 
federative constitution", it added. 
  The daily offered Germany as an example for the independent 
federative Georgian state. It added that autonomous republics 
had been artificially created in the former Soviet Union and 
resulted in bloodshed after the Soviet collapse. 
  Georgia has three autonomies--Abkhazia, South Ossetia and 
Adzharia. Only the latter succeeded to avoid a conflict. 
  Many Georgian politicians expressed similar ideas in 
interviews with TASS. However, every time they asked not to be 
named as the idea of federalism is assessed by the opposition as 
betrayal of national interests.

  [Text] Sochi, 1 Feb -- The situation in Abkhazia's Galskiy 
rayon has recently been exacerbated, ITAR-TASS correspondent has 
learned from Beslan Bargandzhia, spokesman of the chairman of 
the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet. In his words, the Abkhazian side 
started preparations for deploying the peacekeeping forces along 
the confrontation line between the Abkhazian and Georgian troops 
on the Inguri river. At the same time several armed groups of 
Georgian troops crossed the Inguri river and penetrated deep 
into the enemy's territory. Exchanges of fire have resumed in 
Abkhazia's Galskiy rayon. People have been killed or wounded. 
According to Beslan Bargandzhia, the Abkhazian side lost 25 
people in exchanges of fire over the past month. 
  The spokesman believes that there is a danger that the 
hostilities in the republic will resume. He is convinced that 
it is necessary to speed up the deployment of the peacekeeping 
forces in the conflict zone, as envisaged by the Geneva accords.

  [Text] This is a statement by Sandro Kavsadze, personal and 
plenipotentiary representative of the Georgian head of state, 
parliament chairman in the sphere of conflict settlement, and 
state committee chairman for human rights and interethnic 
relations. 
  On 28 January 1994, under the mediation of Russia and with 
the participation of representatives of the UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees, talks were held at the Russian Foreign Ministry 
between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides. 
  The talks lasted from 0900 till midnight but, unfortunately, 
ended without result. The four-party agreement on the voluntary 
repatriation of refugees and displaced persons was not 
implemented. 
  Many hours of exhausting work and searching for agreement 
and 
compromise produced a document. However, the Abkhaz side 
demanded from participants in the talks that persons wishing to 
return to permanent places of residence who had taken part in 
combat operations should not be covered by security guarantees. 
The Georgian side categorically refuses to discriminate between 
refugees on the grounds of their participation or 
non-participation in hostilities. Almost all the population, 
including Georgians, Abkhazians, and other nationalities living 
in Abkhazia, was involved in the conflict. 
  To punish people who took up arms to defend themselves and 
their relatives is a serious violation of human rights and an 
infringement of presumption of innocence. By blaming only the 
Georgian population, Gudauta makes another attempt to legitimize 
ethnic cleansing and disguise its desire to prevent a peaceful 
settlement.

Council extended, until March 7, the mandate of a U.N. observer 
mission in the former Soviet republic of Georgia with a current 
authorised strength of 55, according to Resolution 896 which was 
unanimously adopted at the council meeting on Monday. 
  The U.N. Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) was set up in 
1993 to help end fighting between the Government of Georgia and 
Abkhazian separatist rebels. The council resolution expressed 
readiness to consider any recommendation from Secretary-General 
Butros Butros-Ghali in the next few weeks to increase the force 
up to a strength of 88. 
  It stressed the need for substantive progress in talks due 
to 
resume next month between the two sides on the political status 
of Abkhazia, fully respecting Georgia's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity. 
  Yuliy Vorontsov, permanent representative of the Russian 
Federation at the U.N., expressed support for the Georgian 
side's call to launch a full-scale peacekeeping operation 
throughout Abkhazia to ensure the return of refugees. He voiced 
regret that "at this stage the Security Council has been unable 
to comply with the request made by the Republic of Georgia."

  The results of the poll are unexpected, as it turns out that 
citizens believe journalists most of all and the government 
least of all. The reasons for such a lack of popularity 
regarding information provided by the government must be, first, 
that the heads of ministries are busy foisting materials in 
praise of themselves onto the radio, television and press and, 
second, that the head of the Cabinet of Ministers press center 
is, in general, hostiley disposed toward journalists.

is published in Tbilisi), Artem Azirov, a leader of the 
Alliance, said that communists favor the preservation of 
Georgia's territorial integrity and condemn separatism and 
nationalism. "We maintain that disruption of links with Russia 
and other fraternal republics is unnatural. It is unacceptable 
to oppose, as some politicians do, the closest and the most 
powerful neighbor, Azirov said. The course of the present 
Georgian leadership toward the rebirth of economic links within 
the CIS and the joint use of the potential built by the joint 
effort is worthy of all-round support."

  [Text] Moscow, January 21, RIA -- The West's position on 
former Yugoslavia does not correspond to Russia's interests in 
the Balkan region in everything, Vladimir Lukin, the chairman of 
the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, told a RIA 
correspondent. 
  Russia's interests, in his opinion, are met more by the 
maximum strongest Serbia in the peaceful solution of all 
problems linked with the settlement of the conflict in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Parliamentary hearings on former Yugoslavia were held in the 
State Duma today, during which Russian deputies were addressed 
by Sergey Lavrov, the Russian deputy foreign minister. 
  He confirmed Russia's intention not to support the idea of 
dealing an air strike at the positions of Bosnian Serbs. 
  "Although the Russian Foreign Ministry is on the correct 
road 
now, still the report by the deputy foreign minister on the 
Yugoslav issue was not quite self-critical," believes Lukin. 
  Russia's Foreign Ministry, in his opinion, made a serious 
mistake in the past by backing U.N. Security Council sanctions 
against former Yugoslavia despite objections of the former 
Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation. 
  The committee chairman criticised an argument by the 
Liberal- 
Democratic Party of Russia on the need to withdraw all foreign 
army contingents from former Yugoslavia. 
  "This may intensify the conflict, since restraining elements 
will be absent", he noted.

  [Text] Moscow, January 21, RIA -- In 1993, Russian-Chinese 
trade reached an estimated 7.2 billion dollars, Mikhail Bely, 
the director of the First Asian Department, told a news briefing 
in the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  This is an all-time high in Russian-Chinese trade since 
1991. 
According to Bely, China holds second place after the FRG in 
trade with Russia. 
  Bely believes that China is a very profitable partner for 
Russia. Last year's trade balance between Russia and China was 2 
billion dollars in Russia's favour. 
  True, Bely admitted, there is Moscow's clearing debts to 
Beijing and also, as he said, "we owe China one billion 
[currency not specified] for goods credit granted to Russia in 
1991-1992". 
  Bely also noted that the problem of quality of Chinese goods 
imported in this country remains. "But if we were not keen on 
cheap goods, Russia could also purchase high-quality Chinese 
commodities supplied to Europe and America," he added.

  [Text] Moscow, January 21, RIA -- Russia and China hold 
close positions on the possible appearance of nuclear weapons in 
North Korea, Mikhail Bely, the director of the First Asian 
Department, told a news briefing in the Russian Foreign Ministry 
today. 
  According to him, "both sides are concerned at this problem 
and are working to bring North Korea, which has frozen its 
participation in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, back to 
it again". 
  At the same time, said Bely, "there are nuances in the two 
countries' positions on this problem". 
  In particular, the Chinese side is strongly opposed to any 
sanctions in relation to North Korea, while Russia, which does 
not advocate any sanctions and considers them a forced measure, 
believes that the question should be tackled by the whole world 
community.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal </F>
Democratic Party of Russia, by Pavil Davydov in Moscow; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Davydov] You are on record as having said that if 
and when you gain power, you will change Russia's Middle East 
policies. Can you spell that out? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We view the Arab world as a friend of Russia. 
Russia once was a defender of Arab interests. Our interests are 
advanced if our relations with countries on Russia's southern 
borders are on a friendly footing. 
  [Davydov] But the post-Gulf war Arab world is polarized 
between supporters of Iraq, who are in the minority, and 
supporters of Kuwait, who are in the majority. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It is in Russia's best interests to be on 
good terms with our closest neighbors on the one hand and the 
Arab orient, particularly Iraq and Syria, on the other. 
However, we are willing to establish ties with all the Arab 
states, notably Iraq and Syria, if only for purely geopolitical 
and geogrpahic considerations. These two are the Arab states 
closest to us. If Yemen, Algeria, or Morocco were to exchange 
places with Iraq, geographically speaking, we would have the 
same attitude toward them. 
  [Davydov] But Iraq is not just a geographical entity; it is 
a political regime led by Saddam Husayn. Do you view Iraq as a 
political fact or geographical location? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I see it in terms of geography, regardless of 
the political system of government that happens to be in power. 
This is a matter for the people of the country. 
  [Davydov] But you are known to be a friend of Saddam's. You 
met him personally and hosted a delegation of the ruling Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party in April, 1993. When you visited Iraq, 
you embraced an Iraqi and Russian national youth education 
program sponsored by the Ba'th party and your Liberal Democratic 
Party, and this is politics. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, I did meet Saddam Husayn, who for two 
years after the Gulf war did not receive any foreign figures, 
including Russians. Russian parliamentarians and various party 
leaders and journalists had sought interviews with him. 
However, I was the only one to be received by him, and that was 
in November, 1992. We had four hours of conversation. He 
impressed me as a person. 
  I would like to reiterate that it is up to each individual 
country to decide the shape of its own political system. We are 
interested in Iraq as a reliable partner from a geopolitical 
angle. Iraq's interests also stand to gain if Turkey and and 
Iran remain weak. 
  [Davydov] But Iraq under Saddam Husayn invaded Kuwait, and 
Iraq's Arab neighbors in the south and west continue to regard 
him as a potential aggressor. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Let us leave the Arabs to sort out their 
issues for themselves. As for Kuwait, I see a parallel between 
Iraq's associatioin with Kuwait and that between Russia and 
Crimea, which is Russian territory. 
  [Davydov] What defines Russia's friends and foes at the 
moment? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] They are defined by Russia's interests. In 
the past, the Communists went too far and rushed headlong into 
aiding practically everybody there was to help, like 
pro-communist regimes in Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, 
Nicaragua, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, and Afghanistan. On the other 
hand, the democrats now take the opposite direction. Whatever 
the United States asks of us we do. They said: Boycott Iraq, 
and so we did. They said: Impose sanctions on Libya, and so we 
did. They said: Go and fight in the Balkans, and so we did. 
The Russian democrats, as you see, have also gone too far. As 
far as we are concerned, we are in the middle. We will not help 
anyone nor get involved in anything unless we are convinced that 
whatever course of action we take will advance Russia's economic 
interests.

<F P=106> [Interview with Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir </F>
Zhirinovskiy by NHK Moscow correspondent Kazuo Kobayashi in 
Moscow; date not given -- recorded; Zhirinovskiy and Kobayashi 
speak in Russian, with Japanese subtitles provided for 
Zhirinovskiy's statements] 
  [Text] [Kobayashi] Immediately after the elections, you 
demanded the [posts of] important ministers such as defense, 
security, finance, and foreign affairs, but you have received 
nothing so far. Are not the voters disappointed now? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I did not demand the posts that you have 
mentioned. I meant that if we are asked to participate in the 
government, we would specifically like to occupy the posts of 
powerful ministers: defense, internal affairs, security, 
foreign affairs, and finance, the key posts, but according to 
the Constitution, it is the president who forms the government. 
He is changing the lineup now, and it is even to our advantage 
for the people to understand that even if the Democratic Russia 
people [demorosy] and the reformers are removed, the government 
figures under the leadership of Chernomyrdin will not hold out 
for long. Thus, our ascent to power as a single-party government 
will be unavoidable. All other possibilities have been 
exhausted; the president addressed various political forces, and 
the only possibility left is the party that has won the 
elections -- the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. I think 
that we will be able to participate in the government by this 
fall. 
  [Kobayashi] What period of time do you think will be 
necessary to implement your program? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We think in terms of months; we do not talk 
about 20 years or 15 years, we say: Had we formed our 
government in January, living standards would have increased by 
30 percent by summer, by 70 percent by the end of the year, and 
twofold in a year or in a year and a half -- for every Russian 
citizen. 
  [Kobayashi] But, excuse me, seeing the inflation rate today 
and the state of the economy, I am afraid that raising living 
standards by 30 percent by summer is quite impossible. What do 
you think? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We can solve the crisis by utilizing our 
formula: resume military factories' complete production 
immediately. Everything that they produce will be exported: 
planes, automatic rifles, submarines. Thus, we will at once 
earn $5 billion or $6 billion a year. Plus, we will sharply 
change our foreign policy; we will withdraw from the embargoes 
imposed on Iraq, Yugoslavia, and Libya. This will give us $15 
billion. Thus, we will have $20 billion in 1994. We will also 
end aid to the nearby foreign countries, which is about $5 
billion more; 25 billion is a huge amount. 
  [Kobayashi] Do you not think that this promotes the arms 
race, or the race in arms production? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We choose the lesser evil. I said immediately 
and openly that some of our neighbors will not like our new 
policy, but we really will carry out our program, and the lives 
of Russian citizens will improve. I am telling the truth. If 
people vote for this program, I have the right to carry it out. 
If I had not discussed but implemented it, I would be 
misleading them. But I said this before the elections, and I 
won on 12 December because of this, and I am saying it now. I 
now have 64 deputies. To carry out the program, I need 264 
deputies. Then I can carry it out. 
  [Kobayashi] After the elections, Western states treated you 
with caution. What relations with the West do you envision? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] There is a certain amount of apprehension 
because we are a new party. They have gotten used to 
communists, and during the past two and a half years they have 
gotten used to the democrats. But we are a new political force. 
People do not fully know me, and sometimes my image is 
distorted, and our program is distorted. Therefore, a kind of 
fear of the new is invoked. But I openly say everywhere: There 
is no need to fear us. We are against violence, against war. 
All we support is peace, cooperation in the areas of the 
economy and culture, and regional cooperation. We are against 
superpowers. We support getting along well with our neighbors, 
including Japan. 
  [Kobayashi] You have said that you support peace, but they 
say that you mentioned a war with Japan to someone. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We have concluded a peace treaty with 
Germany, and we have concluded a peace treaty with everyone in 
the world with whom we fought -- also with Finland. We have no 
peace treaty only with Japan. I was simply stating the 
situation as a lawyer: The lack of a peace treaty means that in 
a certain, narrow sense, we are in a state of war with this 
country. There is no third possibility. Can you name a third 
possibility? No peace treaty was concluded, yet there is no 
war. So what do we have? What do we have? We have a 
hermaphrodite -- neither a man nor a woman -- but that is the 
worst possibility. It is the same here. The relations between 
Japan and Russia are like a hermaphrodite -- neither war nor 
peace. Which is it? War or peace? 
  [Kobayashi] Why do you want to become president? What ideas 
would you like to realize in this country? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] If I assume the post of head of state, we 
will 
fulfill our minimal program in several months and then move on 
to a broader program of reforms in the country. Therefore, one 
must assume the highest post -- the head of state. Because 
today, all right, I am the head of the party of the 
parliamentary majority, a winning party. The next step is 
participation in the government, and finally, the post of head 
of state. 
  [Kobayashi] Do you envision early presidential elections? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Without a doubt. Elections will be held next 
year, and maybe even this spring. 
  [Kobayashi] This spring? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes. 
  [Kobayashi] And through what means? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Through the resignation of the president. 
  [Kobayashi] And for what reason? He has already expressed 
his intention to continue until.... 
  [Zhirinovskiy, interrupting] May God give him health and let 
him continue until the end, but the parliamentary elections were 
also supposed to be held in two years' time. After all, the 
parliament was elected for five years, but the elections were 
held two years early. They also wanted to continue until the 
end, until 1995, but they were made to go, they were forced to 
go in 1993. The situation in the country is getting worse every 
day, and it will force the president to form another government 
while relying on the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, in 
which case he may continue until the end of his term. 
  [Kobayashi] And you are ready.... 
  [Zhirinovskiy, interrupting] We are ready, and I have 
informed him of this, him and Chernomyrdin. We are ready to 
participate in the government, but we do not.... 
  [Kobayashi, interrupting] And the elections? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We are also ready for elections. 
  [Kobayashi] Some say that you demand money for interviews 
with journalists. Does this mean that you have lost the support 
of voters? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Support from the voters is still coming in. 
Thousands of money orders arrive every day at Moscow post 
offices, but because a lot of correspondents want an interview, 
in order to regulate this queue, I say that I am willing to give 
interviews to those who pay for them. Very often there are 
correspondents who say: Let us interview you, and we will pay 
you. I do this to regulate the queue. If I started giving 
interviews to everyone -- I do not have the time. So, because 
you have propelled us toward the market, and because market 
relations are a commodity-money-commodity thing, and because my 
commodity is my working time; a person must rest, yet I am 
working with you. So, you are paying for spending my working 
time. I do not care if this is an interview, a book, or a 
conversation. My working time is worth money. I must receive 
compensation for my expenses for communicating with you, whoever 
you might be. This does not apply to an interview as such; this 
is my work, my working time. 
  [Kobayashi] You have mentioned that you will travel abroad 
in 
the next few days. Where and what for? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I am leaving for Slovenia on Thursday [27 
January], then for a 2-million-person rally in Belgrade, and 
then the Poles are waiting for me. I am touring all the Slavic 
states of East Europe. This is a burden for me, and they pay me 
money to go there. My journey is paid for in full, and I get 
30,000, 40,000, or 50,000 [currency not specified] to go to them 
and meet them there. I will not go anywhere just like that, but 
only when it is paid for in full. For example, I am going to go 
to Turkey, and they are paying for a 15-person staff. This 
includes a doctor, guards, press secretary -- 15 people. They 
are paying for everything--15 people. 
  [Kobayashi] Excuse me, you mentioned a doctor. What kind of 
illness do you have? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I have no illness. Simply, there is the 
doctor, the guards, and my coach. We exercise in the morning. 
The doctor takes my pulse. I would not be taking my own pulse, 
would I? Let him take my pulse and say: more effort, less 
effort. Dietetic food. I do not eat just anything. I like 
dietetic food: shrimp, octopus, boiled tongue, turtle soup, and 
things like this. The doctor must check it, taste it, and then 
I can partake of it. But me, I am healthy. What I mean is, my 
daily schedule is under medical control. 
  [Kobayashi] You drink a lot. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I drink one and a half liters of water a day. 
I drink no alcohol and do not smoke. But I am supposed to 
drink one and a half liters of water a day.

  [Text] Moscow, January 21, RIA -- Issue No. 1 of 
ROSSIYSKAYA FEDERATSIYA (RUSSIAN FEDERATION), a journal of the 
government of Russia, is off the press. This is the only 
specialised periodical in the country designed for those 
associated with the governmental sphere, deputies and officials 
of bodies of state administration at every level. The journal 
will also be of interest to general readership, to anyone 
concerned with problems of the development of Russia's new 
statehood.

  [Text] Moscow, January 25, RIA -- The search for a version 
of the Constitution that would suit Russia best has been stopped 
only temporarily, says Chairman of the Duma Committee for 
Legislation and Judicial Reform Vladimir Isakov. Without 
putting the results of last December's constitutional vote in 
doubt, Mr. Isakov still maintained that the contradictions 
inherent in the new constitutions will require amendments in the 
near future. Mr. Isakov told RIA, in particular, that the 
Constitution does not remove many contradictions between the 
executive and legislative authorities in Russia. 
  At the same time, Mr. Isakov's interview implies that the 
former fervent proponents of the "Soviet" draft of the 
Constitution as opposed to Mr. Yeltsin's version have drawn 
lessons from last year's political developments and are not 
going to fan passions around the constitutional issue. Mr. 
Isakov said that the effort to elaborate cardinally new drafts 
of the Constitution will take place in the framework of public 
initiatives, but in no way in the Duma.

<F P=106> [Interview with U.S. Ambassador to Armenia Harry Gilmore by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Yerevan, 29/01/94 ("RESPUBLICA ARMENIA" daily-NOYAN 
TAPAN) -- Interview with the Ambassador of the United States of 
America in the Republic of Armenia Harry Gilmore. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Gilmore, could you please inform us on 
humanitarian aid which U.S. Government is providing to Armenia? 
I am in particularly interested in problems with delivery of 
kerosene. What is causing the delay? 
  [Gilmore] The first two loads of kerosene, more than 10,000 
tons are in Batumi from December. First load of 5,000 tons is 
also in Batumi from December 21, the second part of kerosene for 
Armenia was delivered to Batumi at the end of December. Our 
partner in realization of this operation is the American 
organization Fund of Democracy and Development. We are also 
working with agency on transportation of cargoes, which in turn 
is collaborating with Georgian railway in order to deliver 
kerosene to Armenia. Unfortunately we were not able to resolve 
all delivery problems but we are working in this direction, and 
I am sure the kerosene will be delivered soon. I am afraid in 
trying to guess the date of delivery, as I am unable to tell 
when the trains from Georgia will arrive. I may also add, that 
the Fund of Democracy and Development purchased another batch of 
kerosene, which is now in Rotterdam and Heife. This batch will 
be delivered to Batumi at the end of January. 
  [Correspondent] Could you please give some details, what are 
the delivery problems? 
  [Gilmore] I may only say, that the Fund itself is signing 
contracts with the agency of cargo transportation, and the 
latter in ?turn with the administration of Georgian railway. 
The delay was most probably caused by change of transportation 
tariffs, and this change wasn't ?he fault of the Georgian side, 
since such change of tariffs was carried out in all CIS 
countries. But I need to stress, that the U.S. Government is 
not participating in negotiations directly, and thus it is not 
responsible for development?of any specific transportation 
conditions. 
  [Correspondent] Do you mean, that U.S. Government is not 
responsible for transportation? 
  [Gilmore] My answer is neither "yes" nor "no", the question 
is rather complex. U.S. Government is financing the 
transportation of kerosene. 15 million dollars were allocated 
for this program, another 1 million was allocated by Japan. 
These money were paid to American firms, which are directly 
responsible for signing contracts. Therefore U.S. Government is 
responsible for the program in whole, but for the separate 
topics of the contract. 
  [Correspondent] Nowadays people need trust most of all, and 
our government along with other governments of former USSR 
countries are not trusted too much. I am sorry for we are 
loosing the trust in receiving aid from the USA. What do you 
think in this regard? 
  [Gilmore] Yes, I understand. I have to feel it on myself, 
but I am sure that all kerosene cargo for Armenia will be 
delivered to the place. Increase of prices in Georgia forced 
transportation companies to revise the contracts and to develop 
new ones. We didn't expect such delays, and I thought, the 
first cargo will be delivered at the end of December. 
  [Correspondent] And you were unable to influence on these 
processes? 
  [Gilmore] No, since we don't understand all the details. 
One of those is the price increase in CIS; the other is the 
terrible condition of Georgian railways: they are extremely 
overloaded. In addition to this transportation companies had 
problems on holidays (New Year and Georgian Christmas), when it 
was in fact impossible to find a representative of Georgian 
Railway Administration, in order to work on the contract. The 
other problem is shortage of electricity in Batumi: there was 
no electricity even for the functioning of electric trains. But 
I am not trying to justify myself. We hope now, that the first 
batch will be here soon, we cannot delay anymore. It could be 
worse. 
  Meanwhile, and you probably know this, we purchased kerosene 
here in Armenia in order to make sure we can start the 
distribution to several groups of population, who live in 
extremely severe conditions. This was done in accordance and 
collaboration with Armenian Government. 
  [Correspondent] There are gossips, that kerosene was 
purchased from Azerbaijan, is this true? 
  [Gilmore] This is absurd, nonsense, if not to say stronger. 
Kerosene was purchased from one of Armenian companies well known 
both to the Armenian Government and to us, and later the 
kerosene was delivered to Arm?nia. Money for this deal entered 
the Armenian bank. 
  [Correspondent] During the recent briefing you mentioned 
another program -- program of food distribution. What was this 
program, who was it dedicated for, and did its realization start? 
  [Gilmore] Indeed, we are going to purchase potatoes and to 
distribute it among the families where children are deprived 
from one of the parents. Realization of the program already 
s?arted, though there were delays caused by gasoline purchase. 
The idea was in purchasing gasoline for the dedicated amount of 
dollars and to pay thus to the farmers from which we were going 
to purchase potatoes. This potatoes will be packed in 10- and 
20-kg bags and distributed among families with deprived 
children. This aid is particularly for this group since it's 
receiving the most little aid compared with others. 
  [Correspondent] Who is going to deal with distribution of 
this aid? 
  [Gilmore] Armenian Apostolic Church in New York headed by 
the 
Archbishop Barsamyan, and the Fund of Aid to Armenia. We are 
collaborating with them and with the organization CARE. Money 
will be paid to the church, which in turn transferred to the 
partners dealing with gasoline trade. Delivery of potatoes has 
already started, and I believe, the distribution will start this 
week. 
  [Correspondent] Could you tell something on the aid programs 
you planned? 
  [Gilmore] I have already mentioned that 15 million dollars 
were allocated for kerosene, 25 thousands dollars were dedicated 
for purchasing gasoline and potatoes; we should also remember 
the additional $7400. $250,000 was allocated by CARE for 10- 
and 20-kg food parcels, which will be distributed among those in 
need. $673,000 was dedicated by CARE for helping pensioners and 
lonely, also to the inhabitants of Gyumri and Vanadzor: during 
the period from November ?o April everyone will receive three 
parcels of 14 kg each; 20,000 tons of agriculture products such 
as wheat, rice and beans were dedicated by the Agriculture 
Department of the USA. All the mentioned aid is organized by 
the CARE program, the Fund of Aid to Armenia and the Armenian 
Apostolic Church in New York. Another 20,000 tons are allocated 
to Armenia by the program "Food for Progress". There are a few 
additional programs in the sphere of medicine, approximately 5 
million dollars worth. This program is dedicated to help young 
mothers and those women who are expecting a child. $650,000 are 
dedicated for the program of teaching doctors and business 
specialists. 
  In nearest future we are going to deliver sowing grain to 
Armenia to be distributed among farmers. This is also a program 
of U.S. Government, where will be also participating private 
organizations and Armenian Ministry of Agriculture. 
Approximately 7 million dollars will be dedicated to this 
program. We also planned special programs worth no less than 
500,000 dollars -- such as distribution of food parcels for the 
inhabitants of the earthquake zone, and an another small but 
important project to help commercial banks in the conditions of 
changes to the market economy. 
  [Correspondent] I am most of all interested in this last 
aid, 
the aid for the economical development of Armenia. 
  [Gilmore] We are currently working with the Ministry of 
Economy in order to prepare technical aid to Armenian commercial 
banks. We include here also the training of bank employees in 
the conditions of the new system, i.e. during the period of 
changing to the market economy. 
  [Correspondent] How much did you spent for this program? 
  [Gilmore] I have no precise data in this regard, but the 
expenses will be lower than the sums dedicated for kerosene or 
grain. This program is planning to carry out seminars for bank 
employees in Armenia, and possibly, some of them will be invited 
to the USA for special training on a higher level. Thus the 
expenses for this program may be calculated only when it is 
finished. But even now we may estimate, that it will make tens 
of thousands dollars. 
  [Correspondent] What about possible allocation of money for 
stabilization of the Armenian national currency? 
  [Gilmore] The problem of giving Armenia money for 
stabilization of the dram rate is very complicated, and this is 
not the problem which may be solved by the U.S. Government 
alone. One of the main rules for such institutes as 
International Currency [Monetary] Fund and International Bank of 
Reconstruction and Development, is not to allocate credits to 
countries which are involved in a conflict. USA is one of the 
countries who founded these organizations. And our policy in 
this regard is to work with these organizations. 
  [Correspondent] But could USA help Armenia separately, 
without participation of these organizations? 
  [Gilmore] Theoretically this is possible. Direct aid could 
be given by the United States and by the 7 countries. But here 
again the USA should work with the World Bank and the 
International Currency Fund. Unfortunately I cannot get into 
details. I may only say, that currently the Armenian government 
is carrying negotiations with these structures, and U.S. 
Government is also participating in these negotiations. There 
have been such negotiations recently, by the way, and we 
couldn't reach a "breakthrough", but there is progress anyway, 
and I would stress that the progress was reached by the Armenian 
Government. Whatever your Government is, it is facing the same 
difficulties during negotiations with International Currency 
Fund and the World Bank. Armenian Government is doing its best. 
  [Correspondent] So you mean, that our Government may be 
successful in this problem? 
  [Gilmore] I'd say, that Armenian Government is doing its 
best 
in order to find a formula acceptable for International Currency 
Fund and the World Bank. This is not easy to do, since the 
rules of these institutions are not created especially for 
Armenia. But I believe that Armenia will be successful in this 
problem. I wouldn't like to tell anything in this regard, I can 
just say, that your Government is working very hard. 
  [Correspondent] The reason why am I asking the details of 
this problem is that, as far as I know, several Eastern European 
countries, Poland in particular, received such aid from Western 
countries. 
  [Gilmore] True. There were several cases, when Western 
countries and the USA in particular have given aid not only via 
international organizations, but also on a bilateral basis by 
means of so-called currency stabilization funds. One of such 
examples is Poland. But we didn't reach the necessary point in 
the case with Armenia yet. The reason is the same -- being 
involved in a conflict. I wouldn't like to talk on how long may 
such a situation last. It is the task of the Government of 
Armenia to report on this. But I must say, that the Armenian 
Government is taking active efforts. Particularly, there were 
several visits to Washington recently, and there were high level 
visits on the level of International Currency Fund and the World 
Bank. All I could add to this would be a guess.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry "is not fully satisfied" with the content of 
yesterday's resolution of the U.N. Security Council to prolong 
the U.N. observer mission mandate in Georgia, head of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry's information and press department 
Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing here today. 
  In the opinion of the Russian side, the mere prolongation of 
the mission mandate "can hardly be viewed as an adequate answer 
to the moderate but real progress achieved at Geneva 
negotiations in December 1993 and January 1994, repeated 
requests of the Georgian and Abkhazian side to send peace-makers 
to the conflict zone, and the real situation in the region." 
  Karasin expressed regret with the "lack of worthy response 
to 
Russian proposals of a genuine peace-making operation in 
Abkhazia". Further delay in such decision objectively confirms 
the current status quo -- isolation of Abkhazia and Georgia -- 
and freezes the soonest and safe return of refugees, which is a 
key humanitarian and political problem. 
  In the opinion of the Russian diplomat, this policy reduces 
chances for an agreement on political status of Abkhazia and 
increases the risk of a new bloodshed as result of spontaneous 
actions of refugees and displaced persons, whose number has 
reached 200,000 in the conflict zone. Karasin believes this 
reality should be foreseen. 
  "We are convinced that the introduction of peace-makers in 
the conflict zone is the only chance to achieve regional 
stabilization and create a real basis for final political 
settlement of the conflict, including the establishment of a 
political status of Abkhazia," he said. 
  In the opinion of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the mere 
beginning of a peace-making operation throughout Abkhazia by 
U.N. forces or other peace-makers authorized by the United 
Nations may create conditions for the implementation of 
agreements on lasting settlement by the warring sides. On its 
part, Russia is ready to make a positive answer to the sides' 
requests for its participation in the operation. 
  Karasin expressed the hope the U.N. secretariat will timely 
consider military-technical, financial and other aspects of a 
peace-making operation in Abkhazia in accordance with the U.N. 
Security Council's resolution of January 31, 1994, in order to 
enable members of the Security Council to discuss the operation 
in detail and decide on its beginning.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- A new Russian proposal on 
global cease-fire from February 1 through minimum two or three 
weeks has been presented by special representative of the 
Russian president Vladimir Kazimirov to Azeri President Geydar 
Aliyev, Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Karabakh 
Leader Robert Kocharyan, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
Information and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin told a 
briefing here today. 
  "Depending on the sides' reaction to the proposal, Russia 
plans further steps aiming at termination of combat operations 
in Nagorno- Karabakh," said the diplomat. 
  Bloody fighting around Nagorno-Karabakh has been on since 
the 
second half of December 1993. It has claimed the lives of 
several thousands of people and wounded another several 
thousands, mainly the attackers. 
  "The new escalation of combat operations is even more 
senseless as heads of all the warring sides admit the conflict 
has no military solution and make statements favoring political 
settlement. The bloodshed recurrence hampers peace-making 
efforts of Russia and international organizations," stressed the 
Foreign Ministry spokesman.

  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Positive changes in the 
Mid-Eastern political life are increasingly feasible, head of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department 
Grigoiry Karasin told a briefing here today. 
  The region's policy of peaceful restructuring "gradually 
removes painful aspects of the post-Gulf War inter-Arab 
relations," stressed the diplomat. A proof to it is a recent 
Saudi Arabian meeting of King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz al Sa'ud 
and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat whose ways parted during the 
Iraqi-Kuwaiti crisis. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that "progressing 
Mideastern peace process, including the Palestinian-Israeli 
declaration on principles of Palestinian self-government," gives 
an impetus to Arab rapprochement. 
  Karasin praised the efficiency of recent meetings of Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Oslo and 
Davos, where "another courageous step towards peace in the 
Middle East was made".

  [Text] Gavriil Popov, chairman of the Russian Democratic 
Reform Movement (RDRM), denied a report published in the 
February 1 edition of the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW 
DAILY) to the effect that he told his group's convention he 
wanted the alliance-style relations with the United States 
discontinued. 
  "I did not mention any issue related to alliance relations 
with the U.S.A. in my report," Popov told INTERFAX Tuesday. In 
his words, the RDRM wants "Russia to seek long-term allies and 
the U.S.A. can be one of them." 
  He also denied having said that the RDRM platform called for 
"large scale government control and financing." 
  Popov thinks that "reliance on the West and the Western 
development option did not work in the sense that the West was 
unable to offer resources for reforms in Russia and the recipes 
the West offered Russia made the situation here worse." 
  He emphasized that "the International Monetary Fund's 
recipes 
were not what the developed countries had used themselves but 
what they had offered to underdeveloped countries." 
  "What they had to offer to Russia was a Latin American 
option," Popov said.

  [Text] The United States will provide nearly $30 million 
to set up a research center in Russia which would devise the 
most effective methods of monitoring the destruction of chemical 
weapons. 
  Accord on this subject was finally reached during U.S. 
President Clinton's recent visit to Moscow and was formalized by 
a protocol which is confidential at the moment. According to 
informed sources, the center will be based at Moscow's 
Vernadskiy Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry. 
Over one-half of the sum promised by the Americans will go on 
instruments and equipment.

  [Text] It has been announced in Washington that the 
Pentagon's budget for the next fiscal year will amount to $264 
billion. The sum is approximately the same as in the current 
fiscal year. Commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov: 
  When this announcement was made, some congressmen asked 
themselves the question whether the already planned program of 
cuts in defense spending would be possible. The program 
provides for reducing defense allocations by $120 billion within 
the next five years. The congressmen began to analyze President 
Clinton's words that the United States must not cut defense 
further. They came to the conclusion that the adopted plan of 
cuts in defense spending remains in force, and the word further 
meant there would be no more cuts except those already planned. 
Senator Sam Nunn reacted positively to the conclusion. 
  The most important thing is that the U.S. military budget is 
least of all linked with the relations between Moscow and 
Washington. Russia and the United States, the two great nuclear 
powers, do not consider each other as an adversary. Cooperation 
in the military field replaced confrontation. This showed 
itself in the agreement on the reduction of strategic arms and 
in the U.S. assistance in dismantling the Soviet nuclear 
arsenal. The level of mutual understanding is characterized by 
the recent agreement, under which Russian and American nuclear 
missiles will not targeted at each other's territory or any 
other country. 
  So what's the reason for Washington's intention to cut the 
Pentagon's budget even more than it was previously planned? 
This is obviously attributed to difficulties of the military 
conversion process. There have been a number of reports in the 
American media on behind-the-scenes activities of congressmen 
from the military industrial regions. 
  New threats is probably another reason: These are regional 
conflicts. John Murtha, chairman of the House of 
Representatives Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, believes 
the United States may face a dangerous conflict on the Korean 
peninsula, a conflict even more dangerous than Haiti, Bosnia, or 
Somalia. In the meantime, the Pentagon insists on a strategy 
calling for a military force ready to fight two major regional 
conflicts simultaneously. 
  According to the mass media, there is no unanimity in the 
Congress to give up cuts in defense spending. According to 
experts and research institutions in the United States, the end 
of the cold war and military confrontation between Moscow and 
Washington has created a unique chance to direct material 
resources to civilian programs, the more so since regional 
conflicts can hardly be compared with the threat to life on 
earth. 
  That was a commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov.

  [Text] Washington February 2 TASS -- The U.S. multiple-use 
spaceship "Discovery" is to lift off from the cosmodrome on Cape 
Canaveral at 3:10 p.m. Moscow time on February 3. For the first 
time, the crew of the shuttle will include Russian cosmonaut 
Sergey Krikalev. He has already made spaceflights twice in 
international crews. The flight on board the "Discovery" will 
set the beginning to a joint programme of space exploration 
which became possible due to agreement between the presidents of 
Russia and the United States. Before entering on a pre-flight 
quarantine, Krikalev gave an interview to ITAR-TASS. 
  Krikalev said the programme for flight preparation at the 
Lyndon Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, differs little 
from the cosmonauts training programme in Russia. Language 
barrier was the main difficulty. Krikalev said that he and his 
standby Vladimir Titov were sent to Houston on November 1, 1992 
without having been given time for language studies. The 
programme included the study of systems, safety rules, training 
in the ways of emergency evacuation from the ship and drilling 
in survival methods. 
  Asked about the flight's purposes and programme and his 
personal contribution to it, Krikalev said his purpose was to 
meet the requirements for an ordinary member of the American 
crew. Upon the arrival in the U.S., the Russian cosmonauts 
began training in fulfilling the duties envisaged by the rank of 
a specialist which corresponds to Russian qualifications of a 
flight engineer. The main purpose of the flight is to bring 
into space a satellite shaped like a saucer and to put it into 
orbit by means of a special manipulator. Sensors installed on 
the satellite will analyse jets of the shuttle's engines. This 
is very important as the cooperation programme envisages the 
shuttle's flight towards Mir station and the linkup with it. 
  When asked what he thinks about the fact that he will make 
the flight on board an American and not a Russian shuttle, 
Krikalev said that regarding the level of technology and 
organisation of the programme Russia and the U.S. are on 
approximately the same level. American astronauts are ahead in 
some things, Russians in others, particularly from the viewpoint 
of prolonged flights. Russian "Buran" was launched back in 
1988. It took off and landed in an automatic regime and in very 
bad weather. Not a single shuttle ever flies when the weather 
is so bad, Krikalev said. 
  Regarding Americans training for a flight in the Russian 
orbital complex in 1995, Krikalev said that several American 
astronauts are training for the flight. He said the advantage 
of their training is that the American astronauts selected for 
the flight have been studying Russian eight hours a day over the 
recent months. The Americans attitude to this aspect is serious 
and they are thorough.

  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- "The Russian Armed Forces 
General Staff is studying the Partnership for Peace program. It 
carries good ideas and will boost our rapprochement with NATO," 
head of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff Colonel-General 
Mikhail Kolesnikov told NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe 
General Henning von Ondarza at the Russian Defence Ministry 
today. 
  According to the colonel-general, the Russian Defence 
Ministry hopes the contacts will "improve planning, 
organization, preparation and implementation of peace-keeping 
operations that involve Russian units". 
  "The Russian Armed Forces General Staff and the Defence 
Ministry pay much attention to the peace-keeping operations. We 
analyze the experience of our peace-making battalion in former 
Yugoslavia and that of our military observers acting under the 
U.N. aegis," he said. 
  The official informed the NATO general of a peace-making 
role 
of Russian troops in the Trans-Dniester region, Tajikistan and 
other areas of the commonwealth. 
  In his turn, General von Ondarza said NATO plans to discuss 
details of cooperation with Russia. 
  The general arrived in Russia on Monday on a four-day visit. 
He has met Russian Army Commander-in-Chief Colonel-General 
Vladimir Semenov, visited the Kantemirovskaya Guard tank 
division and acquainted himself with combat training and the 
military routine. 
  A draft program of Russian-NATO military cooperation for 
1994 
was discussed at a meeting of representatives of the Russian 
Defence Ministry and NATO last week in Moscow. The draft 
includes 50 military arrangements, namely exchange visits of 
Russian and NATO military command and experts, joint exercises 
and training, training of Russian officers at NATO units and 
educational establishments and mutual invitations to military 
exercises.

  [Text] We now go over to our political commentator Valeriy 
Kiosa. He is on the phone to the studio from Viktor Stepanovich 
Chernomyrdin's news conference. Over to you. 
  [Kiosa] Thank you. The prime minister was actually expected 
above all to sum up the results of his visits to Italy and to 
the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, but of course we could 
not do without issues from back home. Let us be chronological, 
however. 
  First of all, the Russian prime minister singled out the 
talks on the possible expansion of G-7 into a G-8 -- by the 
addition of Russia. But -- and this is, I would say, a new 
element in the prime minister's standpoint -- he stressed that 
we should realize the difficulties of this issue. These include 
the prices -- it is against our interests too to bring them 
down; and also the customs rules. So possibly one should start 
from the political aspect of Russia's inclusion in G-7, and then 
pass on to the economy. In the prime minister's words, there is 
a certain degree of understanding from our partners. 
  As for relations with European countries, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin 
emphasized again that Russia was not laying claim to any special 
status, but that it had a right to have the same status as 
anyone else. Here too there are lots of questions. For 
instance, we produce so much aluminum that, as Viktor 
Chernomyrdin put it, one could bury half of Europe in it, while 
their works would have to stop. So this is a delicate issue, 
and all the details have to be worked out carefully. 
  Another problem is our debts. Our partners say: First you 
pay, then we'll have cooperation. Russia, however, believes 
that through cooperation it will get the opportunity to pay off 
its debt. Here too some progress has been made, but talks are 
continuing. 
  As I've said, however, we could not possibly do without 
issues relating to Russian internal matters. A question was 
asked about Georgia's possible membership of the ruble zone. 
Viktor Chernomyrdin expressed a certain degree of surprise, and 
said the question had not been raised at the talks, and Russia 
was not ready for this. As for the ruble zone in general, the 
prime minister stressed that many dozens of documents on the 
economic union were being prepared now, including various fiscal 
policy options. In any case, though, and here I quote Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, the government will not do anything to the 
detriment of Russia. 
  Talking about his short-term plans, the prime minister 
singled out first of all his preparations for an important 
government session, which is to take place not on 17 February, 
as originally planned, but on 24 February. The date was agreed 
only today, after a meeting with the Russian president, to whom 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, at the start of the news conference, wished 
a happy birthday. He said he had handed Yeltsin, on behalf of 
the government, the best bunch of flowers of all those that will 
appear in the president's office today. That is about all I can 
tell you about the prime minister's news conference.

  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Tuesday the crisis in Bosnia should 
be settled only by peaceful means. 
  "Russia stands against the escalation of the conflict and 
against air strikes" on positions of conflicting sides, he told 
a press conference. 
  However, the priemier also opposed the statements of Russian 
nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirnovskiy who said in Bosnia that 
U.S.-proposed air strikes on serbs would be viewed as an attack 
on Russia. 
  "This is an exaggeration", Chernomyrdin commented. 
  "The settlement of the Bosnian conflict is not an easy 
problem and it cannot be solved overnight", Chernomyrdin said.

  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Bosnian peace process goes 
on is the opinion of Bosnian settlement mediators Lord Owen and 
Thorvald Stoltenberg, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
said here today after meeting the co-chairmen of the 
international London conference on former Yugoslavia. "The 
Russian initiative follows the same channel," he stressed. 
  The meeting discussed additional cooperation measures to 
prevent further escalation of regional violence, keep the Geneva 
negotiations process going and achieve Bosnian settlement. 
  The sides also focuses on a new Russian initiative that 
presupposes boosted efforts of the Security Council in order to 
develop the peace process, said Kozyrev. 
  Speaking of possible air raids in Bosnia, Kozyrev said in 
principle this measure is not excluded within the framework of 
Security Council resolutions but "it is an extreme step". The 
Russian foreign minister noted the need for additional 
consultations of the U.N. Security Council's permanent members 
and expressed the hope the raids will not happen. 
  The co-chairmen departed for Geneva after a brief working 
visit to Moscow.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgy Shmelyov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev mocked the idea that inflammatory statements of 
nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky can influence the 
position of any of the three warring sides in Bosnia and 
proposed to hold a competition for the best tablet for 
Zhirinovsky. 
  The tablets should be for "hysteria, suspicion and other 
types of devilish possession". "There is a feeling that 
Zhirinovsky has succeeded in creating the situation of hysteria 
and suspicion", Kozyrev told reporters after meeting 
international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg on 
Tuesday. 
  He was evidently referring to statements of Zhirinovsky who 
said that air strikes on Bosnian Serbs will be viewed as an 
attack on Russia and promised to use an alleged secret sonic 
weapon in retaliation. 
  But Kozyrev expressed hope that there would be no air 
strikes 
on Bosnia although the possibility is not ruled out in the 
framework of the UN Security Council resolutions and only in 
"extreme cases". 
  He added that "punishment strikes" are "absolutely 
inadmissible". 
  However, the foreign minister admitted that "hypothetically 
the possibility of air strikes exists" in case UN peace-keepers 
are attacked by any of the conflicting sides while fulfilling 
their humanitarian mission. 
  Kozyrev said that the UN secretary general had named 
Srebrenica and Tuzla as the regions where a threat to UN forces 
exist. "Luckily, talks with the Serbian side resulted in an 
agreement on help in replacing the Canadian battalion with a 
Dutch one. Diplomatic work to unblock the situation in Tuzla is 
going on which is possible with a direct Russian participation", 
Kozyrev said adding that attacks on UN convoys are staged not 
only by Serbs, but by Muslims and Croats as well. 
  Lord Owen thanked Russia for "a very constructive role" on 
all stages of the work to reach a political settlement. 
  None of the three warring parties can secure a military 
victory and a solution can be found only at the negotiating 
table, he told TASS. 
  He expressed hope that the conflicting sides will resume 
negotiations in the coming weeks to "find a compromise on those 
inconsiderable contradictions which still exist". 
  Owen urged to continue humanitarian aid supplies to the 
civilian population in conditions of a harsh winter.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Sidorov: "Green Light to Use Air Power in </F>
Bosnia"] 
  [Excerpts] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's decision 
to give the green light to the use of air power in Bosnia to 
support the relief of the Canadian battalion in Srebrenica and 
the opening of the airport in Tuzla continues to prompt a 
variety of comment from officials, experts, and the press. 
[passage omitted] 
  On Tuesday international mediators T. Stoltenberg and David 
Owen (EU) arrive in Moscow for consultatuions. The Russian 
leadership's position, which will be set out for them at the 
Foreign Ministry, will probably differ from the pronouncements 
by LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, who said in Belgrade that the bombing of Serbs in 
Bosnia will mean a declaration of war on Russia. Nonetheless, 
the mediators will again be advised to think twice before 
reaching decisions on Bosnia. Their talks with the Russian 
Federation foreign minister will probably center on the new 
Russian initiatives and the future of the International 
Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Report by Andrey Baturin and Sergey Gryzunov: "Broom Dance </F>
As Performed by Zhirinovskiy"] 
  [Text] Belgrade -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy arrived on 
vacation in independent Slovenia, where he waltzed with a broom 
and did a Cossack dance. His bodyguard swam after hotel 
property that had been thrown in a lake, while the Yugoslav 
businessmen organizing and paying for the trip by the deputy's 
team smashed glasses at supper in classic Russian style. 
  The Slovene Internal Affairs Ministry ordered him to leave 
the republic, probably in response to the statement that not 
"every small place can call itself a state" (Slovenia is a small 
country even by European standards). 
  Zhirinovskiy went from Slovenia to Belgrade, managing en 
route, in Budapest, not only to explain to flabbergasted 
Hungarians that they had no prospects, that no one wanted their 
"Ikarusz" buses and apples because they had plenty of their own, 
but also to indicate a way out of the situation. According to 
the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader, it is to 
galvanize the ideas of CEMA and the Warsaw Pact and create a 
zone of East European cooperation. 
  In the capital of Serbia and Yugoslavia the visitor was 
greeted with tumultuous applause in a hall which was packed with 
many more admirers than journalists invited to the press 
conference. Zhirinovskiy said that he had told Chernomyrdin that 
he would not rest as long as Kozyrev was a minister: "My task 
is to remove him from the Russian government." 
  Belgrade's next guest or, to be more precise, the guest of 
the local orthodox neocommunists, will be Gennadiy Zyuganov, in 
Febrary. 
  "I come here as a victor, as chairman of the party that 
gained three times as many votes as those who are are now 
governing Russia," Zhirinovskiy said. "I want to warn the 
Western countries' governments that to bomb any cities in Bosnia 
will be to declare war on Russia.... Let them not forget that 
there are still Russian forces in Europe and they could remain 
there for a long time." 
  This is exactly what the conflict participants are seeking 
to 
achieve in the Balkans -- to involve the powerful of this world 
in the bloody internecine strife. The Serbs are trying to 
involve the Russians, the Muslims are trying to involve the 
Islamic world, and the Croats are trying to involve the West. 
  Zhirinovskiy said he was against East European states 
joining 
NATO: "If they want to clean the boots of the Germans, British, 
and French, let them join." Russia will not do so. And as soon 
as it has a new president, his party will create a Union of 
Slavic States. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's words meet with a warm response in 
the hearts of a section of Yugoslav society. After all, he is 
promising the victims of sanctions and war what they want: The 
lifting of sanctions and victory both over economic problems and 
on the battlefield. When Zhirinovskiy finally wins, Russia will 
defend its Orthodox brothers. 
  There are others who think differently. Like, for example, 
the BORBA newspaper commentator voicing the opinion of the 
Serbian democratic opposition: "We should be more concerned 
about the support for Zhirinovskiy than about Kozyrev's refusal 
to adopt a `pro-Serbian stance'.... Serbia and Yugoslavia are 
certainly in a very difficult situation. But it is equally 
difficult to imagine that anyone would vote for the destruction 
of Russia and the whole world for the sake of our salvation."

  [Text] Moscow, 1 Feb -- "Russia's relations with Ukraine 
and Belarus will not change significantly with the election of 
Yuriy Meshkov as president of Crimea or the removal of Stanislav 
Shushkevich from the post of speaker of the Belarus parliament," 
Sergey Krasavchenko, first deputy head of the Russian 
presidential administration, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  According to him, "relations between the three CIS states 
will be implemented within the framework of the strategy and 
political course determined during the meetings of leaders of 
the Commonwealth and in bilateral agreements." 
  If Belarus adopts a position toward Russia that differs from 
that under Stanislav Shuskevich, "the appropriate reaction from 
Russia will follow, too. And the same applies to Ukraine," 
Sergey Krasavchenko noted. 
  The advent to power of Yuriy Meshkov, president of Crimea, 
who is a radical supporter of the peninsula becoming a sovereign 
entity "may complicate relations between Russia and Ukraine, if 
certain forces strive to draw Russia into the nascent conflict." 
However, he stressed, "there are normal, civilized, political 
methods" that may help avert confrontation. Recalling the 
statement by Yuriy Meshkov that he does not intend to seek 
Crimea's immediate departure from Ukraine and its annexation to 
Russia, Sergey Krasavchenko noted that "no major grounds for 
tension should arise."

  [Text] The State Duma's Russia's Choice faction, led by 
former first deputy prime minister Yegor Gaydar, opposes plans 
for the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary 
systems, claiming they are hasty and badly prepared. 
  "In their current form, the inter-bank and 
inter-governmental 
agreements will undoubtedly inflict colossal economic damage on 
Russia, spur inflation, and sharply bring down the Russian 
citizens' living standards," says the faction's statement 
circulated on Monday. 
  The document says, however, that Russia's Choice favors 
Russia's economic integration with Belarus and other former 
Soviet republics on clear-cut terms. The terms on which the two 
states' monetary systems might be united are as follows: 
  1. The unification of the budget, taxing, crediting, 
financial, customs, foreign-trade and monetary legislation; 
  2. The levelling of the two states' economic indices, above 
all the budget deficit, and the rates of credit emission and 
inflation; 
  3. The Belarusian national currency shall be exchanged for 
the ruble at a rate fixed on the free currency market; 
  4. Credits and cash shall come strictly from one emission 
center. 
  Only on these terms will integration be equitable and 
mutually advantageous for the states concerned, says Russia's 
Choice.

republican territory, Kazakh state adviser Tulegen Zhukeyev told 
a meeting of Russian and Kazakh experts here today. 
  A Russian-Kazakh intergovernment memorandum on "Mutual 
Understanding in Maintenance of the Baykonur Space Launching 
Grounds" was signed a month ago and membership of an 
intergovernment commission for Baykonur has been confirmed. The 
commission is expected to prepare draft bilateral documents on 
status and conditions of the use of Baykonur and the town of 
Leninsk and rent of Baykonur and Leninsk facilities within two 
months. 
  Under the memorandum, Russian military units were to 
temporarily stay on Baykonur territory and the launching grounds 
themselves were to be rented by Russia. However, the Kazakh 
side continues to insist on Baykonur demilitarization, meanwhile 
preparations and launches of rocket boosters and spacecraft are 
so far impossible without servicemen of the Russian aero-space 
forces. The Russian side wants to rent Baykonur which is in 
principle supported by Kazakhstan. 
  The rent term is so far unclear (a rent period of less than 
30 years is inefficient for Russia). Kazakhstan has its own 
notion of the rent and it will be the most difficult to agree on 
the rent amount. Thus, Russia may have to boost the creation of 
its own launching grounds (a project of the sort is already 
available) to include defence and security tasks now solved only 
in Baykonur. 
  Another acute question is the Kazakh demand for compensation 
for the damage done by Russian organizations at Baykonur space 
launching grounds and other three testing grounds located on 
Kazakh territory. According to estimations, the full cost of 
restoration of basic assets and Russian compensation for 
1992-1993 maintenance and use of Baykonur and the testing 
grounds exceeds seven billion U.S. dollars. 
  Baykonur seems to be used for bargaining and pressure on 
Russia. It has been established that the population was harmed 
only by nuclear tests in Semipalatinsk, and not a single nuclear 
explosion was registered there since the moment Russia 
proclaimed sovereignty. Thus, Russia cannot be responsible for 
damage done to the population in the past.

  [Text] Sochi, 1 Feb -- "We are against the signing of a 
treaty on friendship and cooperation between Russia and Georgia, 
planned for 3 February," said Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, chairman of 
the Abkhaz Council of Ministers, on behalf of the Abkhaz 
government to an ITAR-TASS correspondent this morning. He 
believes this treaty "will enable Georgia to have access to 
Russian weapons." Sokrat Dzhindzholiya believes the treaty on 
friendship and cooperation between Russia and Georgia can only 
be signed after a comprehensive settlement of the 
Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, which is impossible without defining 
Abkhazia's political status. 
  "During the recent talks in Geneva, only a first step was 
made toward the settlement of the conflict," underlined Sokrat 
Dzhindzholiya. "The threat of renewed fighting still exists, 
and the question of peacekeeping forces for the conflict zone 
has been raised. In such conditions, the signing of a treaty 
with Georgia is fraught with very serious consequences." 
  The chairman of the Abkhaz Council of Ministers said leaders 
of North Caucasian republics within Russia share his point of 
view.

  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- "We are not prepared to 
admit Georgia into the ruble zone," chairman of the Russian 
Government Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists on Tuesday on 
the eve of Russian president's visit to Georgia scheduled on 
February 3. 
  Chernomyrdin said that during previous meetings with 
Georgian 
leaders the question of Georgia's entering the ruble zone was 
not discussed. 
  The Russian prime minister believes that this problem might 
be considered in the context of the realisation of the economic 
union between CIS countries. He pointed out that countries 
joining the ruble zone will have to sacrifice part of their 
sovereignty and carry out tough coordination of economic reforms 
between themselves. 
  In connection with the January statement made by Russian and 
Belarusian leadership on Belarus' entering the ruble zone 
Chernomyrdin pointed out that "it is naive to suppose that this 
will happen at the expense of Russian tax-payers." 
Chernmomyrdin pointed out that Belarus is not going to live at 
Russia's expense. "Admitting Belarus into the ruble zone will 
not be detrimental to Russia's interests. We shall not let it 
happen," Chernomyrdin declared. [as received] 
  Chernomyrdin believes that one cannot speak today about an 
anti- reformist policy of the Belarusian leadership. "I see 
that the Belarusian Government is targeted at reforms," he added.

  [Text] Intersept agency reports that members of the Russian 
State Duma have unanimously spoken against the president's 
forthcoming trip to Georgia. They believe that it is the wrong 
moment in time to pay attention to this unstable Transcaucasian 
state. Experts believe that signing a treaty between Russia and 
Georgia in the situation when problems of the North Caucasus 
have not been resolved may provoke a conflict between the 
executive and the lawmakers in Russia. Most deputies of the 
lower chamber will vote down the ratification of such a treaty.

  [Text] Moscow February 2 TASS -- General of the Army Pavel 
Grachev, Russian minister of defence, left Moscow for Tbilisi on 
wednesday morning to attend a meeting between the Russian 
president Boris Yeltsin and Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  Along with the signing of a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation between the two states, a package of agreements on 
cooperation between the military structures of Russia and 
Georgia is also expected to be discussed and signed. 
  Much attention at the talks is to be given to matters 
concerning the status of and conditions for the functioning of 
Russian border troops. 
  Expert opinion is that the prospective conclusion of Russo- 
Georgian military agreements does not mean the establishment of 
any military-political alliance between Russia and Georgia 
against Abkhazia. 
  The interests of both Abkhazia and South Ossetia are to be 
taken into account during the discussion of cooperation-related 
matters between the two states. 
  The problem of reaching mutual understanding over the 
question of carrying out peacekeeeping operations in Abkhazia 
with the use of a peacekeeping force under U.N. auspices will be 
one of important aspects of the forthcoming talks.

  [Text] As a POSTFACTUM correspondent has been told in 
circles close to the Georgian Ministry of Security and Ministry 
of Internal Affairs, 20 of the Russian Federation president's 
security personnel have arrived in Tbilisi. The routes that 
Boris Yeltsin will take have been divided into five zones, and 
each of these into several sectors. 
  For their part, the Georgian special services are also 
adopting extraordinary security measures. In particular, 5,000 
policemen and around 300 Ministry of Security staffers intend to 
ensure security in the zone of the route that will be taken by 
the Russian Federation president 3 February. 
  As the Georgian Foreign Ministry has reported, B. Yeltsin 
will be accompanied by Russian Federation Foreign Minister A. 
Kozyrev, St. Petersburg Mayor A. Sobchak, and Defense Minister 
P. Grachev.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Dolidze report: "Georgia: Tbilisi Awaits Boris </F>
Yeltsin"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The final round of Russian-Georgian 
talks, where the treaty on friendship, good-neighborliness, and 
cooperation between the two countries and a package of other 
documents are being prepared for signing, began Monday. Boris 
Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze are to sign them 3 February. 
  On the eve of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi Shevardnadze 
has advocated launching new relations with Russia designed to 
help settle the Abkhazian and South Ossetian crises and overcome 
economic difficulties. The Georgian leader stressed that the 
documents which will be signed meet Russia's strategic 
interests. On the subject of the imminent return 10 February of 
the Georgian refugees to Abkhazia, Shevardnadze announced the 
prospect of a Russian peacekeeping mission in the conflict zone 
in collaboration with the UN endeavors. 
  Rumors are rife about Georgia's also joining the ruble zone. 
Parliamentary discussion of issues which have generated the 
inflation of the coupon has been put back to 10 February. The 
Cabinet of Ministers said it was not ready to issue an analysis 
of the problem. This situation was assessed thus: Yeltsin will 
come, Georgia will enter the ruble zone, and there will be no 
need to discuss the coupon problem, since the coupon itself will 
no longer exist. 
  "The question of the possibility of Georgia's joining the 
ruble zone may really be on the agenda at the talks," Tengiz 
Sigua, retired head of the Cabinet of Ministers and one of the 
leaders of the opposition, agreed. "But I doubt that we will 
return to the ruble. We have not asked Russia whether it needs 
such a burden. Those who claim that if Georgia joins the ruble 
zone it will receive products and energy sources at the wave of 
a magic wand are bluffing. We will not see those so easily. 
But the fact that we need to build good-neighborly relations 
both politically and economically -- that I agree with." 
  Irakliy Tsereteli, chairman of the National Independence 
Party, wants to gain an advantage for himself from Yeltsin's 
visit -- to restore the prestige of the street platform. He 
came to the parliament from street rallies, and he wants to go 
back to them. This young radical is promising to gather an 
audience on the days of Yeltsin's visit and hold a rally outside 
the Russian Embassy building. 
  "Russia should know that not everyone in Georgia is 
satisfied 
with its imperial attitude toward us," Tsereteli told 
journalists. 
  Tsereteli will hold a rally if he can assemble an audience, 
which people here doubt. But B. Kakubava, head of the Abkhazia 
liberation organization and a deputy in the Georgian parliament, 
does not have to go out of his way to gain an audience. There 
are thousands of refugees from Abkhazia in Tbilisi today. In 
the next few days Kakubava is planning to bring them out onto 
the streets, and these will be the first "meeting groups" the 
Russian president will see, he stated; they will sit down at the 
airport and the Russian Embassy and declare a hunger strike, 
demanding a meeting with Yeltsin. 
  "Yeltsin will hear us," Kakubava said. "We will tell him how 
guilty Russia and Russian citizens are for the fact that 250,000 
refugees now find themselves displaced from their homes." 
  Another person who comes from Abkhazia is more pragmatic -- 
Vice Premier Tomaz Nadareishvili, who once headed the government 
of the autonomous formation. Nadareishvili believes that 
rallies are not compulsory. You simply have to ask the specific 
questions. 
  And as for the official authorities, they are waiting 
impatiently for the Russian president's first visit. A 
commission to meet B. Yeltsin has been set up. Georgia, which 
suffered during the years of ersatz independence, thirsts first 
and foremost for serious political and economic cooperation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under general headline "Georgia: </F>
Tbilisi Awaits Boris Yeltsin": "...And Meanwhile"] 
  [Text] On the eve of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia, 
representatives of sociopolitical movements of Adygea have 
circulated an open letter to the Russian president and prime 
minister. It observes in particular that the peoples of the 
North Caucasus and the south of Russia have greeted the end of 
the war with Abkhazia with great satisfaction. 
  At the same time, the letter says, the threat of a new 
spiral 
of conflict has recently risen sharply. The attempt by certain 
Georgian forces to impose their will on the people of Abkhazia 
and deprive them of the opportunity to control their own lives 
as they see fit may bring to naught all that has been done by 
the joint efforts of the peoples of Russia, and lead to a new 
war which may prove to be even more embittered. 
  At the same time numerous rallies are being held in the 
cities and settlements of Abkhazia. Its population is alarmed 
at the imminent signing of a treaty between Russia and Georgia 
which envisages the strengthening of Georgia's national army. 
The rally participants believe that this will create new 
preconditions for an escalation of hostilities. 
  The quadripartite meeting on the problem of 
Georgian-Abkhazian relations, planned for this week in Sochi, 
has also been frustrated. It was planned that representatives 
of Russia and delegates from the office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees would take part in it. According to 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, the reason for 
the cancellation of the meeting is that it has not proved 
possible to sign in Moscow a multilateral agreement on refugees. 
  The possible conclusion of a military alliance between 
Russia 
and Georgia is generating alarm in a number of regions of the 
Caucasus. As has become known from confidential sources close 
to the leadership of Abkhazia and the Confederation of Caucasus 
Peoples, if strong-arm pressure is applied to Abkhazia, the 
Confederation of Caucasus Peoples is prepared to send 
approximately 5,000-6,000 of its volunteers to defend it. 
Roughly the same number of volunteers may be activated on 
Russia's borders with Georgia which pass through the North 
Caucasus.

Servicemen Have Been Killed in Georgia in the Last Three Years. 
Their Killers Have Not Been Found, Their Families Are Still 
Awaiting Condolences...."] 
  [Text] U.S. congressmen make the development of relations 
with Vietnam directly dependent upon Hanoi's readiness to 
clarify the fate of U.S. MIA's in the Vietnam war. And that is 
not a diplomatic whim: The history of the pretty difficult 
relations between Washington and Hanoi cannot be rewritten -- 
what happened, happened. But it is impossible to inaugurate a 
"new era" between them while the fate of the last soldier from 
that almost 20-year-old war still remains unknown. 
  It is not always proper to draw analogies in such a delicate 
area as relations between two countries, but they do sometimes 
arise. Like, for example, today, on the eve of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi, where it is expected 
that a "major" interstate treaty on friendship and cooperation 
will be signed. Credit and praise are due to those who have 
tirelessly advanced this solemn moment. There have been 
difficulties. And there still are: After all, Georgia is 
signing a treaty with a country which it saw -- at the height of 
the Abkhazian campaign -- as its main adversary and, 
incidentally, stated so from the highest rostrums.... 
  But, be that as it may, it would be good to inugurate the 
"new era" in relations by eliminating misunderstandings. The 
killers of Major Vladimir Berilov, Captain Yakov Ivanov, the 
8-year-old captain's daughter Marina Savostina, and another 69 
Russian servicemen and members of their families still roam free 
in Georgia to this day. There is no statute of limitation for 
these crimes. But if it is impossible for some reason to track 
down the criminals (although the killer of a U.S. diplomat was 
found in Tbilisi in just a matter of days. Excuses were not 
enough. Was it because he was an American?) is it really 
impossible to expresss, albeit belatedly, very belatedly, simple 
human sympathy to the families of the Russians whoi have been 
killed? 
  German World War II POW's who died in Georgia have had a 
memorial erected in the republic's capital. Is it because they 
were Germans? 
  But who will answer for the Russians, will they be 
remembered 
during the talks in Tbilisi?

  [Text] Tokyo February 1 TASS -- Russian border guards 
video-filmed the recent incident during which 130-140 Japanese 
fishing boats crossed Russia's state border in the area of south 
Kurils and the actions of the Russian border patrol ships, 
Colonel-General Andrey Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of Russia's 
frontier forces, told ITAR-TASS. He arrived here to attend a 
three-sided forum, opening on Tuesday, of representatives from 
Russia, the United States and Japan on security in the northern 
Pacific. 
  Nikolayev said he brought the video film to Tokyo and is 
prepared to show it to Japanese experts if they would wish so. 
  On Monday a spokesman for Japan's Maritime Safety Agency 
(MSA) told ITAR-TASS that the agency "did not put on record" 
massive intrusions by Japanese fishing boats into Russian 
territorial waters on January 21-22, which had been the subject 
of a Russian Foreign Ministry representation made to Tokyo. 
  In view of this, the MSA, which partially performs the 
functions of frontier units, dropped the inquiry into whether 
Japanese boats crossed the state border of the Russian 
Federation. 
  It has become known from informed sources that last year 
Russian border guards recorded about 7,000 transgressions of the 
border by Japanese fishing boats. Practically no transgressors 
were apprehended to avoid a conflict with the neighbouring state.

<F P=106> [Unidentified station observer commentary; from the "Good </F>
Evening, China" program] 
  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev has ended his 
official visit to China. Our station observer has the following 
comment on the outcome of his visit: 
  The talks and meetings held in Beijing, as well as documents 
signed there, have shown that both sides have made important 
strides in strengthening and deepening the Russian-Chinese 
bilateral relations. They have formulated active measures 
including common understanding on developing their partnership 
in economic cooperation and trade, and have resolved important 
border issues. Eventually, they have agreed to hold the second 
Russian-Chinese summit in Moscow in 1994. In short, Russia's 
foreign policy has been attaching -- previously and currently -- 
top priority to Russian-Chinese relations. 
  However, the impact of the Russian Foreign Minister's visit 
to China was not limited to Russian-Chinese bilateral relations. 
The Russian Foreign Ministry publicly reiterated that the 
Russian Foreign Minister's visit to China has striven to further 
strengthen peace and security throughout the whole Asia-Pacific 
region. First, from Russia's viewpoint, the Asia-Pacific region 
has become more and more important to Russia's future. Russia 
has in the past, as now, regarded relations with members of the 
Asia-Pacific region as multilateral. Therefore, Russia has 
maintained sound relations with all countries of the 
Asia-Pacific region. The same principle has been reflected in 
Russia's treaties with China, India, and the Republic of Korea, 
and in Russia's ties with the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea. Russia's relations with Japan, with members of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and with other countries 
of the Asia-Pacific region have all been established under the 
same principle. 
  Kozyrev said: At present, the Asia-Pacific region faces the 
least likelihood of large-scale conflicts since the end of the 
World War II. However, the threat exists in the region whereby 
new tense situations may occur, and existing tense situations 
may worsen. An example in this regard is the resumption of 
civil war in Cambodia. I believe that both Russia and China can 
facilitate an end to the bloody conflicts in Cambodia. 
  Nowadays, other issues bothering the Asia-Pacific region 
include the possibility of extracting and developing abundant 
resources in the Pacific Ocean, including the extraction of 
undersea oil and natural gas that have already been discovered, 
and that have been termed as very massive. I should remind our 
listeners: Some countries of the Asia-Pacific region have, for 
a long time, failed to peacefully resolve territorial disputes 
over some coral islands in the South China Sea. Many border 
conflicts among countries of the Asia-Pacific region have yet to 
be settled. Religious and national radicalism still have an 
impact on the relations among countries in the region. In 
summary, just as Kozyrev stressed during his visit in China: If 
we do not promptly handle all these problems, we will face the 
danger of a very powerful explosion. 
  The Asia-Pacific region has not been spared the threat of 
proliferation of nuclear weapons and rocket technology. First, 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and rocket technology does 
not suit the interests of Russia, China, and India. Therefore, 
the unsettled nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is 
particularly bothersome. 
  Russia proposed to establish, at different stages, a common 
security system in Asia. Russia proposed establishing a 
conflict- prevention center and a regional research organization 
that studies related work. 
  Kozyrev's visit to China has demonstrated once again: While 
pursuing its foreign policy, Russia does not intend to 
facilitate a West-East confrontation, or to show favoritism to 
either side. Only by adhering to a balanced foreign policy can 
Russia safeguard its accomplishments in the international arena.

<F P=106> [Valentyna Pysanska report: "Energy Sources: Payment Is </F>
the Only Problem"] 
  [Text] According to Mykhaylo Kovalko, chairman of the State 
Committee for Oil and Gas, the situation that is presently 
taking shape with regard to oil and gas extraction in Ukraine, 
deliveries from Russia, as well as processing looks hopeful. At 
a recent news conference, he said that the branch had completed 
the past year successfully. The situation with the extraction 
of oil and gas had stabilized and the rates of construction had 
not decreased. 
  Agreements have been signed on the deliveries of natural gas 
from Russia in amounts similar to last year's; agreements on oil 
deliveries will be signed soon. 
  Do not ask me about prices or tariffs, because they 
constitute a commercial secret. I will only say that the 
agreement is mutually advantageous and will enable our national 
economy to function successfully. If only there are funds -- 
there will be energy sources! 
  This year, it is planned to purchase 32 million tonnes of 
oil 
from Russia. The Committee for Material Resources will be in 
charge of the deliveries -- partly through direct purchases and 
also in accordance with so-called Surgut [geographical name] 
agreements. A large part of the deliveries will be made through 
the group of companies "Nordex," which, last year, pumped 1.74 
million tonnes of oil, for which Ukraine has a debt of $123 
million. 
  The committee pins great hopes upon the implementation of 
the 
national program "Oil and Gas by the Year 2010," which specifies 
priorities in the development of the branch.

  [Text] Kiev "has felt positive changes in the U.S. position 
towards Ukraine." This was said by Director of the president's 
service on international affairs, Anton Buteyko, at a briefing 
on the results of the Ukrainian governmental delegation's visit 
to the U.S. in Kiev on Tuesday [1 February]. 
  In his opinion, the signed documents reflected that the U.S. 
had finished the assessment and working out of the policy 
towards Ukraine. The joint communique and the supplementary 
documents underline that the U.S. will pay primary attention to 
the democratic and market reforms in Ukraine. The documents 
emphasize that Ukraine plays the role of a stabilizer in the 
region. That is why its political and economic security is of 
exceptional importance for the U.S. and Europe. 
  Buteyko believes that the U.S. party has decided to allot 
economic aid to Russia while taking into consideration these 
factors. In his words, the funds will be allotted for 
dismantling of nuclear and conventional weapons, for support of 
the agricultural reforms and for overcoming of the difficulties 
stemming from the transition period. 
  The briefing's organizers said that the sums of economic aid 
would be announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president 
to the U.S. planned for March, 1994. 
  Chief of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's Information 
Department, Yuriy Sergeyev, said that he had received the 
official authority to comment on the statement of Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the meeting on the foreign 
policy of CIS and Baltic States in Moscow. Kozyrev estimated 
the "defense of the rights of Russians in the neighboring states 
as one of Russia's priority strategic interests." 
  Sergeyev expressed Ukraine's deep concern over the tendency 
in Russia of toughning its foreign policy towards the new 
independent states. 
  According to Sergeyev, "Ukraine understands the necessity to 
defend human rights of people not living on their native 
territory and tries to guarantee all their rights including the 
one for a cultural autonomy." However, "we firmly stand against 
the intention of any state to resolve the issue on human rights 
of the nationalities living beyond its frontier." 
  In his words, Ukraine considered it unacceptable that other 
states' armed forces be on its territory and supported the 
demands that "all foreign troops" be withdrawn from Moldova and 
Baltic states.

  [Text] Kiev, 1 Feb -- At a regular briefing on current 
foreign policy issues at the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Anton Buteyko, head of the presidential service for 
international issues, informed those present about the course of 
the visit by the Ukrainian government delegation, headed by 
Economics Minister Roman Shpek, to the United States. In 
particular he emphasized that, having realized Ukraine's role 
and significance in the world, the Americans have changed their 
attitude to the republic. 
  In the course of talks, accord was achieved on a wide range 
of issues of bilateral cooperation, in particular on cooperation 
in the conversion sector, agriculture, and space development. A 
joint committee for conversion issues has been set up and 25 
schemes have been prepared, including in particular a program 
for building accommodation for servicemen who will be released 
from the army as a result of the reduction in the armed forces 
of Ukraine. 
  A series of agreements and documents were also prepared, 
which are to be signed during the visit by Leonid Kravchuk to 
the United States, planned for March. These include agreements 
on protecting mutual investments, on avoiding dual taxation, and 
on bilateral economic cooperation. It is not ruled out that the 
American Senate will review the volume of economic assistance to 
Ukraine with a view to increasing it. 
  Anton Buteyko noted that the Ukrainian-American talks 
proceeded under the singular motto: "We do not want you to give 
us fish, we want you to teach us how to catch it." We hope that 
they will do so.

  [Text] Ukraine appears to have secured at least a five 
decade respite from its insistent nuclear waste disposal 
headache caused by Russia's stubborn reluctance to admit 
Ukraine's nuclear fuel waste material to its reprocessing 
facilities now that the Zaporizhye nuclear power plant 
production association is reported to have signed a contract 
with the U.S. Duke Power company for construction of nuclear 
waste storage facilities. The contract materialized as a result 
of an international contest for nuclear waste disposal projects 
that the production association had to organize in view of the 
relevant governmental bodies' obvious indifference, inaction, 
and incompetence. 
  The contest reportedly drew participants and tenders from 
Germany, Britain, France, Canada, the United States, Spain, and 
[word indistinct]. The Zaporizhye nuclear power plant 
management chose the project drafted by the Duke engineering and 
service affiliates of the Duke Power company (?as specially) 
following the Ukrainian nuclear power industry's technological 
[word indistinct] and requirements. The project reportedly 
provides for storing used nuclear fuel cases in armored concrete 
cylinders. Despite their relative simplicity and cheapness, 
they are said to be both durable and reliable for storing 
fissionable materials, nuclear safety experts maintain. 
Currently, ecological and feasibility studies are under way in 
these sites. If everything goes well, the first storage 
facility is expected to be completed by late 1995. Similar 
storage facilities are being contemplated for construction at 
other Ukrainian nuclear power plants.

  [Text] I am convinced that the Russian side is not 
interested in aggravating relations or exploiting the so-called 
Crimean card. Anatoliy Zlenko, minister of foreign affairs of 
Ukraine, stated this in an interview for journalists. In his 
opinion, it is in the interest of Crimeans and in the interest 
of Ukraine as a whole to keep everything as it was prior to 
these elections. I believe, the head of the foreign policy 
department of our state emphasized, that politicians and those 
who took part in the Crimean presidential elections will have 
enough sense and strength of will not to complicate the 
situation.

  [Text] The further talks concerning the Black Sea Fleet 
between Ukraine and Russia should be based largely on the Yalta 
Accords, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Anatoliy Zlenko, told 
INTERFAX. 
  Solutions to this problem must not be sought "solely on the 
basis of the documents signed in Massandra," the minister said. 
  "The protocol signed in Massandra is only a protocol of 
intentions. It gives some opportunities for maneuver and search 
for the ways to resolve this problem, but there are also other 
agreements which should be taken into account during the talks," 
Ukraine's foreign minister said. 
  Under the Yalta Accords reached in 1992 between Presidents 
Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia, the 
Black Sea Fleet was to serve as the basis for building Russia's 
Navy and Ukraine's Naval Forces. In the meantime, the Fleet was 
to be run by the two presidents. 
  On June 17, 1993, in Moscow, Yeltsin and Kravchuk signed 
another agreement, under which the Black Sea Fleet was to be 
divided between Russia and Ukraine equally. 
  On September 3, 1993, in the town of Massandra in Crimea, 
the 
two presidents signed an agreement under which Ukraine yielded 
its part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia to cover its debt for 
the Russian fuel received by Ukrainian consumers earlier. The 
concrete mechanisms of compensation for the ships to be 
transferred to Russia and for the use of naval bases located in 
Crimea were to be devised during further talks. However talks 
on this issue became stalemated. 
  Therefore Zlenko's latest statement actually signifies 
Ukraine's departure from the Massandra agreements on 
transferring Ukraine's part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia. 
  When asked by Interfax-Ukraine about the international 
aspect 
of the possible referendum on independence for Crimea, Zlenko 
said he hopes that "the people of Crimea will have enough 
restraint and common sense to refrain from developing an issue 
fraught with aggravating relations between Crimea and other 
nations." 
  "We must not allow an explosive situation to emerge," Zlenko 
said. "Russia is not interested in aggravating relations and 
using the Crimean card either," he pointed out.

  [Text] A meeting between Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman 
Ivan Plyushch and Scandinavian diplomats has been held at the 
request of the latter. The meeting was attended by Danish 
Ambassador Christian Faber-Rod, Norwegian Ambassador Oyvind 
Nordsletten, Finnish Ambassador Erik Ulfstedt, and Swedish 
Ambassador Martin Halquist. The Swedish ambassador presented 
the Ukrainian legislative speaker with a letter reporting on a 
25-26 February meeting of foreign ministers from Scandinavia and 
Iceland in Stockholm. The ministers discussed a number of 
issues, including European security. In the communique adopted 
on the results of the conference, the ministers hailed the 
tripartite Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. declaration signed on 14 
January 1994 and the appendix to the declaration stipulating the 
dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal. The ministers pointed 
out that the implementation of these documents will 
significantly contribute to strengthening European security and 
the nonproliferation of nuclear arms. The ambassadors were 
instructed to inform the Ukrainian legislative chairman about 
that declaration and the unanimous support for the tripartite 
accord on the part of the governments of their states and 
Iceland. The governments also hope that the accord will be 
implemented soon. It was underlined that Ukraine should sign 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the immediate future. 
  In his turn, Ivan Plyushch provided an in-depth analysis of 
Ukraine's current economic and political situation, pointing out: 
  [Begin Plyushch recording] Ukraine has been facing three 
global problems -- Chernobyl, conversion of the Army and the 
military-industrial complex, and the structural reshaping of the 
economy. [end recording] 
  The Supreme Council chairman answered his interlocutors' 
questions regarding, in particular, dates of practical 
implementation of the agreements reached with Russia and the 
United States. Ivan Plyushch emphasized that it is vital for 
Ukraine that the provisions of the declaration and its appendix 
be observed by all sides. This would correspond with the spirit 
of every document adopted in Moscow. 
  [Begin Plyushch recording] For me, the problem is: When will 
we begin receiving practical compensation? Thus far, we have 
not received a cent; thus far, these documents are just pieces 
of paper and simple discussions. [end recording] 
  At the end of the meeting, the Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, 
and Swedish ambassadors expressed hope that Ukraine's nonnuclear 
course will remain unchanged and asserted that their governments 
are ready to grant Ukraine multifold support.

  [Text] According to the Defense Ministry's press service, 
603 tanks, 630 armored cars, and 175 combat aircraft were 
scrapped in Ukraine by 17 November, 1993, in keeping with 
Ukraine's commitments under the treaty on conventional forces 
reductions in Europe. During 1993 over 50 international 
inspection teams visited Ukraine. They visited tank 
manufacturing and repair factories in Lvov, Nikolayev, Kiev, and 
Zhitomir, which are expected to shortly scrap a total of 100 
tanks and 60 armored cars. The newest stage in Ukraine's 
conventional weaponry reductions provides for scrapping over 600 
tanks and more than 300 armored cars.

<F P=106> [Article by Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy: </F>
"Professionalism, Discipline, and Order"] 
  [Excerpts] The training and upbringing of a corps of 
national commanders is one of the primary elements in building 
the Ukrainian Armed Forces. 
  Analyzing the two-year experience of this process, we must 
point out that many notions had to be reviewed, transformed, and 
created anew in the course of carrying out this task. 
  The structure of that part of the Soviet Army which was 
inherited by Ukraine from the USSR did not correspond with 
Ukraine's new tasks, its domestic and foreign political 
situation. Thus, this structure had to be reformed. 
  The groups of forces acquired by Ukraine were not integral 
military entities. The system of their command, control, and 
communications was disrupted; the operational-strategic 
structure of troops demanded radical changes and orientation 
solely toward domestic resources. 
  Learning other countries' experiences and analyzing 
suggestions and propositions, we came to the conclusion that the 
new Ukraine needed a new Army that would neither be the 
successor of the Soviet Army nor follow the pattern of any 
Western army. This new army had to take into account national 
and historic peculiarities and be based on domestic 
infrastructure. Besides, the new Ukrainian Armed Forces 
demanded the creation of a national officers' corps. 
  In light of this, we have to build anew the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces, at the same time resolving several intertwined issues: 
reforming existing groups and units and creating new ones; 
dismissing a large number of servicemen and replacing them with 
Ukrainian nationals serving in other CIS states; eliminating 
acute social problems and resolving issues of spiritual and 
national rebirth, and the like. 
  The cornerstone of these tasks is the formation of a system 
of training and upbringing national officers. The critical 
analysis of the elapsed two-year period has demonstrated that 
certain things could have been done differently and better. One 
of the reasons that we have not accomplished more were drawbacks 
in personnel policy and the failure or impossibility to appoint 
professional officers to the main sectors of our activities. 
  Any army that uses mixed methods of staffing, faces the 
primary issue of a professional approach to the military trade. 
This issue determines an army's morale and psychological 
atmosphere and thus, success in combat. 
  In our opinion, three factors are crucial for military 
professionals: competence, responsibility, and loyalty to the 
motherland. 
  These are the features that distinguish a professional from 
a 
dilettante caring only how to get more and give less. 
  The complicated economic and sociopolitical situation in 
Ukraine undoubtedly influences the situation in the Army which 
makes us seek unconventional approaches to the training and 
upbringing of officers. Besides, we must take into account that 
any restrictions in the social, legal, or spiritual spheres of 
officers' lives hamper the processes of professionalizing the 
Army. 
  An officer who is constantly being distracted from his 
duties 
by his housing problems, his wife's employment, his children's 
protection from hooligans, and the like, can hardly be expected 
to be very efficient in his duties. The more so that both he 
and his family see that shady deals guarantee better lives for 
many people around them. [passage omitted] 
  We believe that an officer can achieve a high degree of 
professionalism only by being assisted by a properly organized 
uninterrupted system of professional training. This is even 
more necessary given the fact that every five to 15 years, 
knowledge becomes obsolete in different branches of science. 
  Such a flexible multifold system of continuous improvement 
of 
cadets' and officers' skills should be introduced in the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces. We have drafted a concept of continuous 
training which includes the following postulates: 
  First: The creation of an organized intertwined system of 
continuous training of officers, not only by military institutes 
and academies but also at different courses, officers classes in 
military units, self-education, as well as closer integration of 
military and civilian education. 
  Second: More fundamental schooling within the framework of 
higher education, especially in initial years. In military 
educational institutions during the first three to four years, 
emphasis should be placed on learning basic subjects, as well as 
elements of military and general educational programs that 
entitle students to receive civilian diplomas. 
  Besides, we believe that the new conditions demand a change 
in the essence of education. Military education used to be 
oriented toward training personnel for commanding troops in 
combat. The new type of schooling, not diminishing the role of 
this kind of training, should provide knowledge necessary for 
building the new Ukrainian Army and ensuring its readiness to 
perform peaceful tasks (including participation in peacekeeping 
forces). [passage omitted] 
  Assessing the situation that developed in the professional 
training of officers, we cannot disregard the issue of the 
Ukrainian language becoming the main working language of every 
professional officer, the language which he can freely speak, 
write, read, and use to give commands to his subordinates. 
  This is a natural precondition which is not in any way 
insulting to the Russian language, which will remain the 
official language of the CIS. However, this precondition is 
hard to implement in the Ukrainian Armed Forces now. In our 
opinion, we need an all-out state program to teach Ukrainian, 
involving appropriate educational institutions. 
  For the Armed Forces, this is a very urgent problem, 
because all the official documents are published in Ukrainian, 
while a comparatively small number of officers can freely speak 
Ukrainian, and there is a shortage of special military 
literature in this language. 
  In my opinion, the problem can be resolved by better 
financing of the process of training and by convincing officers 
that learning Ukrainian is crucial. Officers should be led to 
understand that Ukraine's glorious history, its customs and 
traditions, important for both individual development and for 
teaching one's subordinates, can only be done in the native 
language. [passage omitted] 
  I think that we should once again point out the 
depolitization of the Army. Ukraine's military doctrine and the 
Law of Ukraine on Social and Legal Protection of Servicemen and 
Members of Their Families stipulate that "complete 
depolitization" of the Army is one of the primary principles of 
building the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which amounts to a ban on 
servicemen's participation and membership in any political 
parties, organizations, or movements. In a majority of 
developed countries, political activity is a profession just as 
diplomatic, legal, or military. Why should Ukrainian servicemen 
be preoccupied with mastering politics rather than their 
profession? He who wants to devote his life to professional 
politics should give up his military career. 
  At the same time, this does not mean that there is negative 
attitude toward any political party or its leadership within our 
Armed Forces. We have nothing against cooperation with parties 
and movements, the more so that some of these express opinions 
regarding the situation in the state, that are similar to ours. 
However, it should be precisely stated that the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces are state structures and they should pursue governmental 
policy which I would term "centrist," in terms of attitude 
toward the standpoints of different parties and movements. 
[passage omitted] 
  To provide the performance of tasks outlined by President 
Kravchuk in his speech at the meeting devoted to Ukrainian Armed 
Forces Day on 4 December 1994, the Ministry of Defense has 
issued an order pointing out concrete measures for the Army. 
  The main task in the sphere of training the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces in 1994, is implementing the military doctrine, and 
maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of troops (forces) 
at the stage of their forming, at the level safeguarding the 
protection of national sovereignty and political independence of 
Ukraine, its territorial integrity, inviolability of borders, 
and fighting back armed aggression from any side. 
  In the situation when the Armed Forces are being built and 
defense budget reduced, combat and mobilization readiness of 
troops (forces) must not be lowered. 
  In operational training, efforts should be concentrated on 
deep studying and practical implementation of issues of 
organizing efficient defense of land and sea borders in all 
directions, as well as antiaircraft and antimissile protection 
of important state installations. 
  Combat training should be brought close to real conditions 
in 
which troops (forces) have to perform combat tasks, especially 
fighting back aggression in the initial stages of war. 
  By the end of 1994, we are planning to adopt the contractual 
system of manning our officers' corps, paying special attention 
to officers having the experience of working in operational and 
operational-strategic units, fighting in the Afghan war, and 
eliminating the aftermath of the accident at Chernobyl nuclear 
power station. 
  In the scientific aspect, we will continue researching the 
problems of developing the Ukrainian Armed Forces. We will 
direct our efforts at providing a theoretical basis for the 
organizational structure of troops, and the combat structure of 
units in light of the economic potential of the state and quotas 
stipulated by the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. 
  We will continue working on developing the system of 
military 
education, supplying the Armed Forces with skilled specialists, 
ready to perform their duty to protect Ukraine's independence 
and sovereignty. Special attention should be paid to learning 
the Ukrainian language and history. 
  Thus, complicated and responsible tasks posed by life to the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces, require the strenuous work of every 
general, officer, warrant officer, and all personnel. Only by 
joint work and efforts will we be able to overcome the hardships 
of the transitional period of building our state and the Army.

  [Text] Kiev, 1 Feb -- Plenary sittings of the ninth session 
of Ukraine's Supreme Council have resumed. It is planned that 
the concept of the development of Ukraine's fuel and energy 
complex until the year 2010 and the draft law on energy 
conservation will be examined this week. 
  At the morning session, people's deputies examined Ukraine's 
draft budget for 1994, which had been proposed and worked on by 
a standing commission. Finance Minister Hrigoriy Pyatachenko 
spoke about the changes and additions. During discussions on 
the latest option, deputies introduced a number of proposals 
directed at balancing more assiduously the revenue and 
expenditure part of the budget. The Commission for Issues of 
the Development of the Basic Sectors of the National Economy 
completed preparations for discussion at the session. Since the 
draft concept of the national program for the revival of the 
countryside for 1995-2005 did not get the required number of 
votes, the commission is proposing that the concept be discussed 
again. 
  Members of the Commission for Issues of National Education 
and Science prepared a draft law on a scientific and scientific 
and technical assessment, and the draft national scientific and 
technical programs "Energy resources, agriculture and food 
complex, materials and substances," submitted by the Cabinet of 
Ministers. The commission should complete its examination of 
them in the course of this week and submit them to the Supreme 
Council presidium. 
  Individual people's deputies discussed citizens' appeals 
concerning the ethics of the actions and behavior of some 
people's deputies both during plenary sessions and in electoral 
districts.

  [Text] Kiev, 1 Feb -- The result of the afternoon session 
of the parliament session was the adoption of the state budget 
of Ukraine for 1994, with 255 deputies voting for its adoption 
and 36 against. According to the new budget, income and 
expenditure are equal, at 335.067343 trillion karbovantsi. 
  In the opinion of people's deputy Leopold Taburyanskyy, head 
of the People's Party of Ukraine, the new budget will lead to 
the further impoverishment of the population. In his opinion, 
expenditure on defense -- 16.82 trillion karbovantsi -- and on 
holding the March parliamentary elections -- 1.15 trillion -- is 
excessive.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Maslov: "Leonid Kravchuk: One Cannot </F>
Reject Planning"] 
  [Excerpts] "One Cannot Reject Planning." The president 
made this statement during his visit to the Ukrainian Stock 
Exchange in response to a question from KIEVSKIYE NOVOSTI's 
economic reporter. 
  The president's interest in stock exchange structures is 
understandable: One may discern a prototype of our economy's 
key unifying element in their development. Although with great 
difficulty, the economy is reforming itself on a competitive 
basis. Another reason for the visit was the fact that having 
passed through the "evolutionary" process of emergence over a 
record short period of time, the Ukrainian Stock Exchange today 
fully meets international standards in organizing bids. This 
has become possible due to the introduction of electronic 
circulation of securities. Assistance came from French 
specialists and the government, which allocated funds for 
software purchases. The distinguishing feature of the 
electronic system is that it allows the very expensive "paper" 
chain to be abandoned. [passage omitted] 
  Valentin Oskolskiy, chairman of the Ukrainian Stock 
Exchange's management, reported that the first biddings were 
held in March of 1992, while the electronic system was installed 
in late 1993. The latter fact was defined as extremely 
significant for the development of a florid market of securities 
since it creates conditions for the regulation of difficult 
relations among sellers, dealers, and investors. Currently, 
only stocks of the shipping company "Ukrrechflot" and the 
"Ukraine" stock bank are sold through this system. The system 
is expected to reach its full potential with the beginning of 
the mass privatization of state property. 
  Having acquainted himself with the system, the staff, and 
the 
results of the bids conducted on this "occasion" (the stock 
exchange sold securities worth 25 million karbovantsy), the 
president answered journalists' questions. Since the stock 
exchange system is a contrast to the so-called system of 
centralized planning, we asked L. Kravchuk to explain his 
general attitude toward the beginnings of planning in the 
economy. 
  "You see that one cannot reject planning," said the 
president. "It is applied everywhere. Even a small family plans 
its future, income, and expenditures -- what it has and what it 
can buy. For example, Japan achieved its market through the 
fulfillment of plans. One should not reject planning as such. 
The problem is that speaking about planning as a principle, we 
have before us the image of the great state plan with its 
extremely centralized system, administrative methods of 
regulation, and pressures on the producer. A plan scares us. 
However, we have actually submitted our plans of social and 
economic development rather than the budget alone to the Supreme 
Soviet. They must be coordinated and interrelated. I believe 
that one must have a plan for the development of any economic 
entity, concern, corporation, or syndicate. This is the case 
throughout the world." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Ukrainian Council of Ministers held a session 
on 31 January chaired by President Leonid Kravchuk. The session 
was attended by managers of departments and organizations, the 
Crimean Council of Ministers, oblast administrations, and the 
Kiev and Sevastopol city administrations. Participants in the 
session discussed the observance of border and customs 
regulations, and the implementation of presidential and 
governmental decrees concerning these issues. A resolution was 
adopted outlining ways to resolve current problems. 
  The session also approved the employment program for 1994. 
The aim of the program is to implement concrete measures 
granting productive employment and efficient social care for 
those categories of citizens unable to compete as equals on the 
job market. 
  A concept for forming special free economic zones was 
approved in general. The concept will provide a methodological 
basis for adopting resolutions and drafting necessary documents 
stipulating concrete free economic zones. 
  Participants discussed a draft national program for 
eliminating the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident and 
providing social care for citizens in 1994-1995, as well as up 
to the year 2000. The document was forwarded on for completion. 
  The government approved and decided to submit for 
ratification a draft presidential decree on forming a single 
system of privatization organs in Ukraine. 
  The participants considered the issue of adopting a new 
payment system for municipal services and rent, as well as 
special purpose compensation for certain strata of society. 
Propositions suggested by the State Committee for Housing and 
Municipal Services stipulate that the share of people's payments 
toward the general cost of municipal services will gradually be 
increased by reducing subsidies for municipal enterprises.

<F P=106> [Report by the Press Service of Ukraine's Ministry of </F>
Defense: "Misinformation"] 
  [Text] The newspaper KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA of 25 January 
1994 carried the information "A `Battle' in the Crimea -- 
Everything Is Covered by Smoke." This brief report is 
noteworthy for quite a number of inaccuracies it contains 
(probably on purpose). For example, the newspaper announced 
that, between 24 and 28 January, "large-scale command staff 
maneuvers of the Armed Forces units and formations" would be 
conducted in some southern Ukrainian regions and in the Crimea. 
In the newspaper's opinion, they are due to Kiev's 
dissatisfaction with the results of the first round of elections 
in the Crimea. The Press Service of Ukraine's Ministry of 
Defense repeatedly stated that, in accordance with the plan for 
combat training of Ukraine's Armed Forces that had been approved 
as far back as in November 1994, a strategic exercise involving 
the resolution of tasks of the country's territorial defense 
would be conducted between 24 and 27 January 1994. No units or 
formations of the Armed Forces participated in the exercise. 
That is why the linking of the question of strategic maneuvers 
to the results of the first round of the presidential elections 
in the Crimea is a manipulation of facts and a deliberate 
stirring up of political passions around the situation in the 
Crimea. The information [in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] also quoted a 
statement by Ukraine's minister of defense, Army General V. 
Radetskyy, that was allegedly made by him in his interview for 
KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI: "I wouldn't like to liberate the Crimea 
the way the Americans liberated Kuwait." In reality, V. 
Radetskyy did not grant any interviews to KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI. 
During a meeting with editors of the leading Ukrainian mass 
media, Vitaliy Radetskyy ruled out a possibility of an armed 
conflict in the Crimea.

  [Text] The process of Crimea's secession from Ukraine, 
initiated by the communist nomenklatura, has gone so far that 
the Crimea has in fact become an independent state. This 
opinion was voiced by Levko Lukyanenko, cochairman of the 
Ukraine Democratic Association, in an interview with the NOVYNY 
television and radio agency. Lukyanenko believes that Yuriy 
Meshkov's presidency is illegal, as were illegal Crimean Supreme 
Soviet resolutions to introduce the post and elect a Crimean 
president. Speaking of Yuriy Meshkov's possible activities in 
the new post, Lukyanenko pointed out that the Crimean Republican 
Party leader used to be a propagandist, while now he has became 
president and will have to take into account realities. 
According to Lukyanenko, Yuriy Meshkov's goal to improve the 
lives of Crimean residents is not obtainable without Ukraine.

  [Text] Moscow February 2 TASS -- Newly-elected Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
had a telephone conversation on Tuesday to agree on a meeting to 
discuss a broad range of Kiev-Simferopol relations, Meshkov told 
ITAR-TASS over telephone on Tuesday. 
  The telephone conversation was described by Meshkov as 
"well-wishing and calm". The meeting will be held on February 4 
in the Ukrainian capital where Meshkov will go right after his 
inauguration in Simferopol. 
  In the words of Meshkov, "there are no reasons for any 
complications. The image of pro-Russian politician Ukrainian 
nationalists are trying to make has nothing to do with me. But 
this has provoked certain watchfulness of the Kiev authorities". 
  Meshkov noted the need for a stable Russian-Ukrainian union, 
referring to historical experience of both states. 
  "The time of Mazepa -- striving for isolation -- has gone, 
the epoch of Bogdan Khmelnitsky returns," the Crimean president 
told ITAR-TASS.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report in the "Crimea" column, under </F>
general headline: "Yuriy Meshkov Is President of Crimean 
Republic. What Kiev Feared and Moscow Was Apparently Not Ready 
to Face Has Happened"] 
  [Excerpts] Judging by the results of the first round of 
presidential elections on the peninsula, it seemed that the 
greater part of the population thought the Crimean Republic's 
reunification with Russia will be a panacea for all the woes 
that have befallen them. This was precisely what Yuriy Meshkov, 
presidential candidate from the Crimean Republican Movement, 
promised them (subsequently with some qualifications). 
  On the day of the second round of elections, 30 January, 
Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the Crimean Tatar People's 
Assembly, gave a news conference. He was sharply negative of 
Yuriy Meshkov's possible election as Crimea's president. He is 
convinced that wherever conflicts have arisen, the situation 
strongly resembled what is happening in Crimea today. Mustafa 
Dzhemilev sees as the main danger the Black Sea Fleet, a greater 
part of whose servicemen voted for Zhirinovskiy in the elections 
to the Russian Federal Assembly. According to Dzhemilev, 
Crimean Tatars do not understand Meshkov's wish for Crimea to 
have close relations with Russia: "Why not with Turkey, where 
the living standards are several orders of magnitude higher, or 
with America?" [passage omitted] 
  On 31 January Nikolay Bagrov organized a news conference for 
Crimean, Ukrainian, and numerous foreign journalists. He stated 
that in all likelihood, he would leave politics. 
  According to Bagrov, "the president will be placed in a 
difficult position because the election program will have to be 
implemented. But it is infeasible." 
  Nikolay Bagrov said that he is not going to run for either 
the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet or the Crimean Supreme Soviet. He 
ended the news conference by saying: "I am grateful to 
everybody for their cooperation. Thank you." 
  On 31 January the Crimean Supreme Soviet Presidium held a 
session in which Nikolay Bagrov made a statement which says in 
part: "I consider it impossible to remain chairman of the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet after the results of the second round of 
presidential elections in the Crimean Republic. I ask the 
extraordinary session to accept my resignation." [passage

  [Text] At the beginning of the session, Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet Chairman Myechyslaw Hryb thanked the deputies once more 
for their confidence and for electing him the Supreme Soviet 
chairman. He spoke about the political course he is going to 
pursue as head of state. 
  [Begin Hryb recording] I will do everything possible to make 
the work of the Supreme Soviet constructive and fruitful. I am 
addressing our opposition: We could eliminate this critical 
situation only through joint efforts. I am not for the 
establishment of single viewpoints on various issues, however, I 
am against idle criticism. I am appealing to you to show and 
prove through your actions and not by words alone that we are 
concerned with the destiny of our people. Only consolidation -- 
but not confrontation of all forces -- can help us. I want to 
stress that Belarusian mass media can play an important role in 
the consolidation of our people and can lessen the tension in 
our society. I wish our mass media to be critical and honest. 
I was elected Supreme Soviet chairman in a very complicated and 
difficult period. I know that our disabled people, pensioners, 
families with many children, students, servicemen, workers of 
the agricultural and industrial sectors, and scientists are 
living through hard times. However, I will not begin my work on 
this post with empty promises. I can promise one thing: I will 
always remember that laborious Belarusian people, who deserve a 
better life, support me. I will do everything possible to 
improve living standards of every Belarusian citizen and family. 
I hope for your understanding, your civil wisdom; I appeal to 
you for your support and comprehension. The destiny of Belarus, 
our Motherland, is currently in our hands. 
  As for the relations of Belarus with foreign states, they 
will be prolonged and based on mutual respect, good neighbor 
relations, and mutually beneficial cooperation. [end recording] 
  Later, lawmakers listened to the speeches of their 
colleagues 
on miscellaneous issues. After the speeches, People's Deputy 
Vasil Ivanavich Shaladonow, general prosecutor of the Republic 
of Belarus, took the rostrum and proposed including the issues 
on electing a new chairman of the Constitutional Committee and 
on criminal responsibility of two judges -- Eduard Klimyankow 
and Mikhail Klopaw -- into the agenda of the 13th Supreme Soviet 
session. The deputies agreed and these issues were included in 
the session's agenda. 
  Next, Supreme Soviet Chairman Myechyslaw Hryb read the 
issues 
to be discussed by the deputies at this session. People's 
Deputy Alyaksandr Lukashenka criticized the deputies for not 
paying attention to what happened in this assembly hall the week 
before. It is necessary to conduct early Supreme Soviet 
elections and not to hide our heads in the sand, said Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka. Some deputies proposed discussing economic issues 
because the industrial and agricultural sectors are in a 
critical state.

  [Text] Myechyslaw Hryb, chairman of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet, gave a news conference today at which he made a 
statement expressing sincere gratitude to the citizens of the 
republic and to the leaders of the CIS countries who 
congratulated him on his election to the post of chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet. The statement also notes that the change of 
leader of the Belarusian parliament does not mean a change in 
political and economic course. No, good-neighborly relations 
with all states, all peoples, recognition of the borders within 
which we exist -- those are the main foreign policy priorities 
set out by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus. 
  In the Supreme Soviet chairman's statement, he says he will 
support the course of nonnuclear status and neutrality 
proclaimed by parliament. Myecheslaw Hryb expressed hope that 
the Belarusian people will demonstrate a sense of organization 
and discipline for the speediest way out of the difficult 
situation in which Belarus finds itself. In the near future, he 
said, the Supreme Soviet Presidium, together with the 
government, intends to (?present) urgent measures to provide for 
the spring sowing and to take the necessary measures to activate 
the activity of our industrial enterprises. The Supreme Soviet 
chairman replied to numerous questions from the journalists.

  [Text] In Minsk, a regular meeting of the Conference of 
Patriotic-Democratic Forces has been held with the participation 
of the United Democratic Party of Belarus, the Belarusian Social 
Democratic Assembly, the Belarusian Peasant Party, the Christian 
Democratic Union, the National Democratic Party, the Party of 
People's Accord, the Society of Belarusian Language, and the 
Belarusian Association of Servicemen. 
  The participants unanimously described the dismissals of 
Stanislav Shushkevich and the "power" ministers as a 
nomenklatura's coup and a path to Kebich dictatorship, which 
will eventually lead to a collapse of the state and economy. 
  The members of the conference expressed their intention to 
unify activities of all patriotic-democratic forces to resist 
the dictatorship. Unification is to be discussed at the next 
meeting.

  [Text] The Military Council of Internal Troops issued a 
statement to the Belarusian public which says that some of the 
mass media and speeches by representatives of political parties 
and by some people's deputies are presenting the activity of the 
internal troops as antipeople, antidemocratic, and antistate. 
Attempts are being made to show them as an instrument of 
political pressure and blackmail. 
  This was shown especially clearly on 9 November 1993, on the 
day of the opening of the latest session of parliament, when 
internal troops were deployed to maintain civil order. This was 
caused, the statement says, by the fact that in Minsk the day 
before, leaflets appeared with a call to get rid of the 
government and for armed protest. One of the leaflets was read 
at the session. In a number of cities there were gatherings of 
people who were antigovernment for [words indistinct] and 
exerting pressure on the authorities. There was information 
warning about possible terrorist acts from the Embassy of the 
Russian Federation. The Belarusian KGB was unaware of a 
breakthrough by aggressively inclined representatives of the 
(?BZV) [expansion unknown] toward the government building. 
  In this way, the statement stresses, the Ministry of 
Internal 
Affairs had sufficient grounds for considering that on the day 
of the opening of the session there could arise conditions which 
would threaten civil peace and the security of citizens. 
Therefore, a plan for ensuring law and order was put into 
practice. 
  The actions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on 20 
January 
this year were described in the same [word indistinct]. In the 
report on the deputies' investigation published in NARODNAYA 
GAZETA it was alleged that subunits of the internal troops were 
sent to intimidate deputies who did not support the government 
line, that the troops were concentrated in numbers intended to 
carry out military action. 
  The Military Council of Internal Troops categorically denies 
this allegation. We solemnly declare that the internal troops 
of the Republic of Belarus will never be an instrument for the 
ambitions of politicians who struggle for power by illegal 
means, says the statement. We appeal to political parties and 
movements, to the mass media, and to the public asking and 
insisting to stop dragging the internal troops into the 
political arena. The troops stand on guard of the law. They 
acted and will act within the law.

  [Text] A negotiating team of experts from the Russian 
Finance Ministry, Economy Ministry, Customs Committee, State CIS 
Cooperation Committee, and the Central Bank of Russia will 
arrive in Minsk on February 2 to draft with their Belarusian 
colleagues a package of documents on merger of the monetary 
systems of the two countries. 
  A Belarusian cabinet member who wanted to remain anonymous 
told Interfax that the negotiating teams will discuss, as a 
matter of priority, mechanisms enabling the most important 
economic institutions of Russia and Belarus to function jointly 
and engage in business contacts with third countries. 
  In his words, the two sides are about to agree on the need 
to 
have a transition period during which common approaches will be 
worked out in customs, budgets, pricing, crediting and social 
policies. He did not rule out that the replacement of 
Belarusian currency by Russian rubles will take six months or a 
year. 
  The minister thinks that the gap between Russian and 
Belarusian positions has been narrowed on the two most 
controversial issues, the prices of fuel and raw commodities for 
Belarusian consumers and the exchange rate between the 
Belarusian and Russian rubles. Following comparison of prices of 
the 97 most important goods, one Russian ruble seems to be worth 
two Belarusian rubles while discussion will have to continue on 
the prices of oil and gas. Belarus wants to make these prices 
equal to those in Russia, while the Russian negotiators insist 
on freezing the existing prices for Belarusian factories and 
gradually making them equal to those at which oil and gas are 
sold to Russian factories. 
  The Belarusian minister said that a compromise was possible. 
  When the documents are agreed upon, Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin will go to Minsk for a signing ceremony.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 1 Feb -- Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian 
presidential administration believes that a presidential party 
will be created in Russia in the next few months. At a meeting 
with the president's regional representatives on Monday, he said 
that the organizational and theoretical work to set up such a 
party has already started. 
  A while ago, at a news conference in the Kremlin on the 
results of elections to the Federal Assembly, Boris Yeltsin said 
it was necessary to form a political force supporting the 
president's course. 
  There will be no compulsory membership in the president's 
party, however, there is a provision for: A structure at the 
top that will work on issues of financing and of the electoral 
campaign in terms of preparing for 1995-1996, when the 
competition for the post of head of state will unfold. 
Guidelines for the future party will be spelled out in the 
presidential message that Yeltsin will deliver to the Federal 
Assembly on 18 February, Filatov assumes. This will be a major 
document set to develop the Russian Constitution, he said . 
  Representatives of the Russian president in regions also 
intend to promote the formation of the presidential party. 
Thus, an inter-regional constituent conference is scheduled for 
7 February in Samara. On the same day a similar conference is 
planned in Moscow. 
  According to Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Russian 
presidential administration for work with territories, it is 
people who are not involved in local administration who should 
initiate the creation of this party, rather then the president's 
representatives in regions. Structures of the presidential party 
may have different names in regions, for example: People's 
Party or Party of Support for the Reform. The heart of the 
matter is that, according to its idea, the party must unite 
democratic forces across Russia.

  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- "The eternal Russian 
question, `who will defeat whom', might be at the centre of the 
upcoming local elections", according to the worried assessment 
of Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Russian presidential 
administration's department for work with the territories. 
  Medvedev told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday there is a danger that 
the 
federal government will support reforms, "while opposition 
forces might come to power at the regional and republican 
level". And no matter how constructive the efforts of reformers 
in the centre are, they don't stand a chance without the support 
of Russia's regions, he declared. 
  One of the problems revealed by the unfolding local 
campaigns 
is, Medvedev explained, that "despite reformers' calls for 
unification, in actuality we don't have any party structures in 
the regions". Those parties who do have local power structures 
are the Communist Party and others of the same leaning. They 
are now restoring their organisations and will, of course, do 
everything they can to defeat the reformers in the upcoming 
local elections, Medvedev said. The economic and financial 
difficulties in the regions play into the hands of the 
opposition forces. 
  Medvedev voiced his opinion that reformers can improve their 
alarming electoral prospects by "honestly explaining their 
mistakes made in socio-economic and financial policy, which did 
not take reality into account". After recognizing its mistakes, 
the Russian Government "should, as soon as possible, determine 
how it is going to correct its reform policy". "There is a hope 
that the president's address, to be delivered to parliament on 
February 18, will be the starting point of a socially-orientated 
policy", Medvedev pointed out. 
  In his analysis of elections already held in Moscow, the 
Moscow and Tula regions, and tens of other districts, Medvedev 
said he thinks the current office-holders are better than their 
predecessors. Therefore, he supposed, if the democratic forces 
can unite their efforts, they can be successful in other regions 
as well. 
  However, the presidential adviser admitted, he has little 
reason for optimism, since "we cannot rule out the possibility 
of the formation of a sort of 'red belt' around Moscow", which 
would be made up of regions with anti-reform and anti-president 
mind-sets: Tambov, Oryol, Voronezh, Lipetsk, Ryazan, Mordoviya, 
and Penza". 
  Medvedev was able to find one observation which he could 
call 
"comforting". During his trips around the country, he met with 
various political leaders. From his meetings, Medvedev 
concluded that many of them, including opposition politicians, 
are taking a second look at their potential allies, especially 
Zhirinovskiy's party with its inflammatory statements.

  [Text] Speaking at a session of the "Russia's Choice" 
faction on Monday, Duma member Mikhail Poltoranin regretted that 
his recent TV remarks "were misinterpreted by viewers and 
journalists." He blamed that on "the improper editing of the 
program, as a result of which his phrases were taken out of 
context, and that distorted their meaning." Despite that, 
Poltoranin brought apologies to "all who could have been 
affected by his words. 
  According to a spokesman for the faction, Poltoranin had to 
give explanations on a demand from a number of faction officials 
because of the public response to one of his statements. He 
declared on television several days ago: "Here in Russia, 
newspapers have always written in Russian. Today, in all this 
bacchanalia a new language of the press is being spread. I call 
it "camp Ivrit," an explosive mixture of russophobia, hatred for 
traditions, lies, and contempt for human dignity. If that flow 
goes further, we will simply blow up the nation and cause a huge 
tide of anti-semitism." 
  In the words of a popular Russian TV commentator, the 
reaction of the public and press has been prompt and 
unequivocal: Poltoranin's remark on "camp Ivrit" smacks 
disgustingly of anti-semitism. 
  At the end of the session, the leadership of the "Russia's 
Choice" faction asked its members to be as tactful as possible 
in their statements and always think before they say anything, 
especially on ethnic matters.

Novikov] 
  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- The Duma Russia's Choice 
faction did not, contrary to some news reports, raise the 
question of removing fellow party member Mikhail Poltoranin from 
his job as chairman of the parliamentary committee on 
information policy and communications, ITAR-TASS learned from 
faction chairman Georgiy Zadonskiy on Tuesday. 
  Zadonskiy was reacting to news reports which alleged that 
Russia's Choice was "examining Mr. Poltoranin's case". 
According to the media reports, the supposed grounds for 
Poltoranin's removal was his comment on "Russophobia in our 
press", uttered in a TV interview with Andrey Karaulov. 
  Zadonskiy declared that there was no Poltoranin "case". The 
committtee chairman explained to Russia's Choice deputies at a 
faction meeting that he talked with Andrey Karaulov for four 
hours, only 40 minutes of which were eventually shown in the TV 
programme, "Moment of Truth". At the meeting, Poltoranin 
admitted that his "seditious" phrase could be interpreted as 
being incorrect. 
  Zadonskiy reported that the Russia's Choice deputies were 
satisfied with Poltoranin's explanation. However, they urged 
upon him the importance of carefully weighing statements before 
they are made public, since every word which issues from the 
mouth of a party member reflects upon the image of Russia's 
Choice.

  [Text] The Russian State Duma's Committee for Security 
intends to "legalize the activities of the Russian Federation 
Constitutional Court." This was announced to Interfax by the 
committee's Chief Viktor Ilyukhin (the Communist Party's 
faction). 
  In his opinion, it was necessary to utilize the provisions 
of 
the former law on Constitutional Court, which did not contradict 
the new Constitution adopted at the referendum on December 12, 
before a new law on Constitutional Court was adopted. 
  He reminded that the Russian Federation's constituent 
members 
were energetically issuing new laws and acts which at times 
failed to conform with the Russian Constitution. Ilyukhin also 
qualified several decrees of the Russian president as 
"non-constitutional." According to Ilyukhin, the president 
exceeded his powers when signing the decree on elimination of 
the Security Ministry and on establishment of the Federal 
Service of Counter-Intelligence subordinated to the Russian 
president. 
  According to the deputy, the new Russian Constitution does 
not mention the right of the president to resubordinate the 
ministries. Ilyukhin considers this move aimed at establishing a 
second government parallel with the cabinet of Chernomyrdin. 
  Ilyukhin is concerned over the fact that Yeltsin may not be 
satisfied with resubordination of intelligence and 
counter-intelligence and that he "harbors the idea to 
resubordinate the Interior Ministry and the army." According to 
Ilyukhin, this is to say that these bodies will be beyond 
judicial and prosecutor's control and also beyond the 
parliament's control" leaving them uncontrollable as during the 
Stalin era.

reliable sources about the state of the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces' combat readiness. 
  According to classified documents of the Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry, only 51 percent of Armed Forces personnel are 
capable of performing combat missions. Only one division in 
every military district is capable of taking part in combat 
operations, the Inspectorate for the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces' Combat Readiness reports. Only 20 percent of tanks in 
service can be considered combat ready. As for naval 
requirements -- putting a ship on full alert within 45 minutes 
-- only a few ships of the Russian Navy are able to fulfill them.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Moscow in Russian to 
Tajikistan at 1700 GMT on 1 February, in its "Radio Slavyanka" 
program of the Russian Defense Ministry, broadcasts a new 
feature entitled "About the Air Force of the Russian Federation" 
presented by journalist Sergey Kozlov. 
  Today's program begins with a recording made yesterday by 
Kozlov at the air force press center. He introduces the 
recording by saying: 
  "The press center of the Air Force of the Russian Defense 
Ministry is on the air. A methodological conference for 
generals and officers has taken place at the main staff of the 
air force. It was addressed by Air Force Colonel General Petr 
Deynekin, commander in chief of the Russian Air Force. A 
special section of his address was devoted to the tasks of the 
Russian air force in 1994 and the prospects for its further 
development. The main thing for the air force, its commander in 
chief stressed, is to maintain battle readiness and security at 
a level which guarantees fulfillment of the tasks of the Russian 
Federation's military doctrine. The major task of the Russian 
Air Force for 1994 is creating air force groups in 
operational-strategic sectors which have become dangerous, 
improving the combat, mobilization, operational, and 
professional training of personnel and reducing the effective 
combat and numerical strength to the set levels while 
simultaneously achieving optimum ratios between combat and 
support constituents in the structure of the air force. 
  "Russia's Air Force has been enlarged by a new air 
component. 
By decision of Russia's president and in accordance with the 
order of the defense minister the frontline air force 
[frontovaya aviatsiya] has been set up. The decision to set up 
this component was made in line with Russia's new military 
doctrine which was announced in November last year. The 
frontline air force will consist of 70 percent of MiG-29 and 
Su-27 combat aircraft and also several types of fighter-bombers 
who now are part of the air force of Russia's Defense Ministry. 
The frontline air force will be subordinated to the command 
formed on the basis of the air force staff of the Moscow 
military district. Air Force Lieutenant General Nikolay 
Antoshkin has been appointed commander of the frontline air 
force".

  [Text] It seems that even the Defense Ministry chiefs do 
not know the actual strength of the Russian Armed Forces. 
  In response to inquiries from the presidential staff, the 
government, and public organizations about the number of our 
servicemen, three of our highest-ranking generals gave different 
figures. Moreover, the gap between the figures amounts to over 
20 divisions. 
  Dmitriy Volkogonov said just before his removal from the 
post 
of presidential military adviser that 1.8 million men serve in 
the Russian Armed Forces. Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
chief of General Staff, divulged that the Armed Forces include a 
total of 2.1 million servicemen. Defense Ministry Pavel 
Grachev, however, said that at present the Armed Forces are 
2.341 million men strong.

<F P=106> ["Military Review" article by Igor Chernyak: </F>
"Military-Industrial Complex: Load Tanks With Aircraft. Will 
Russia Get Back Billions of Dollars from Arms Exports?"] 
  [Text] A session of the Russian Federation State Committee 
for the Defense Sectors of Industry [Goskomoboronprom] Collegium 
was held last week. The main question being the results of 
exports of arms, military hardware, and civilian output from the 
military-industrial complex, and the prospects for the future. 
Unprecedentedly, in addition to the committee leadership, 
leading Russian weapons designers, and directors of the major 
weapons manufacturing enterprises, journalists too were invited 
to the collegium session, which would recently have been 
considered secret. Oleg Nikiforov, head of the Goskomoboronprom 
Main Directorate for Foreign Economic Activity, delivered the 
report. According to him, arms exports are today becoming a 
top-priority for military-industrial complex enterprises since, 
following the drastic reduction in Defense Ministry orders, 
defense sectors derive money for conversion and internal needs 
mainly from exports. 
  In 1993 representatives of the aviation, radio, 
missile-space, and shipbuilding industries operated most 
successfully on the foreign arms market. There was a decline in 
arms industry indicators as well as munitions and special 
chemicals. Over the year Goskomoboronprom delegations went to 
31 countries for talks on arms exports and 186 meetings were 
held in Moscow, as a result of which a number of protocols and 
agreements were signed and licenses issued granting the right to 
trade with 26 countries (there were previously 47 of these 
countries) worth 40 percent more than in 1992. The largest 
customers for Russian Goskomoboronprom military and civil 
equipment were Hungary, India, China, Iran, the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE], Syria, and Turkey. Some $543 million were 
received for exports of civilian output (88.4 percent of the 
1992 level), which amounts to one-fourth of total export 
revenue. It is forecast that in 1994 total Russian revenue via 
the Goskomoboronprom will rise to $4 billion. 
  It was particularly emphasized that last year Russia 
succeeded in making a mighty breakthrough in an area previously 
closed to it -- arms fairs -- and exhibited military-industrial 
complex output in a number of countries -- from West Europe to 
the Persian Gulf and Southeast Asia. According to Nikiforov, 
all this gives reason to hope that the situation will gradually 
start to improve over the next few years following the collapse 
in 1992 and the lack of decline in 1993. 
  However, in subsequent speeches by a number of general 
designers and directors of military-industrial complex 
enterprises some doubts were voiced over such an optimistic 
forecast. Regrettably, not everything depends on development 
and production personnel. According to General Designer Arkadiy 
Shipunov, in arms exports Russia is at the moment living off its 
old achievements. However, compared with previous years 
research and development funding dropped by a factor of 10-15 
and in five years the country runs the risk of finding itself 
unable to offer anything new. "For instance, we recently held 
talks with one country and they told us bluntly: We will only 
buy things from you that we cannot find in the West. We have 
increasingly few of these products," Shipunov said. 
  A second factor that has jeopardized Russian arms exports 
is the accompanying switch to world prices of energy sources and 
the rapid rise in the prime cost of military-industrial complex 
output. The result is that, whereas previously goods were taken 
by virtue of their relative cheapness, now they may be even more 
costly than their Western counterparts. 
  A third factor is the extremely difficult situation that has 
arisen with the production of munitions, the range of which is 
steadily tending to decrease. It will soon be simply impossible 
to produce some types of so-called artillery rounds in Russia. 
And even the most state-of-the-art aircraft and ships cannot be 
sold without ammunition and arms for the aircraft and ships. 
  The collegium repeatedly criticized the ill-conceived system 
of customs duties and taxes, which has resulted in total 
deductions sometimes exceeding the value of the output. 
  The extremely harsh criticism of certain leading military 
manufacturers regarding the quality of their products is also 
worthy of note. In particular, "Kurganmashzavod," which 
supplies the UAE with infantry fighting vehicles, came in for 
criticism: The Arabs recently complained about the quality of 
the armor. The upshot being, in the opinion of the 
Goskomoboronprom leadership that all future military-technical 
cooperation with the Gulf countries may be in jeopardy. "We 
made a considerable breakthrough in the UAE, but if we operate 
like that, we will shortly not have a presence there," 
Goskomoboronprom Chairman Viktor Glukhikh said. "You realize 
that it was not 'Kurganmashzavod' that made the breakthrough 
into the Gulf, but the whole country. Boys from the Defense 
Ministry worked in the desert till they dropped, dozens of 
people held talks at various levels. But the plant has now 
forgotten everything and is trying to earn a faster buck. I 
realize that it is hard to tailor vehicles to specific Gulf 
conditions, but we will not nonetheless permit this approach." 
  And there is another factor. Civilian output comprises 
three-fourths of the total output of Russia's 
military-industrial complex, while military output makes up the 
remaining one-fourth. However, the ratio is reversed in exports 
-- sales of weapons and military hardware account for 75 percent 
of revenue. That was why the committee's deputy chairman, 
Gennadiy Yanpolskiy, said that one of the main tasks for 1994 is 
to bring "nonmilitary" output up to a competitive level. 
  In the opinion of the committee's specialists, major state 
support is needed in order for the planned escape from the 
crisis in exports of arms and military hardware to be feasible. 
Measures proposed include adopting programs for Russian 
military cooperation with foreign countries and foreign economic 
activity in the sphere of civilian output, providing export 
incentives by creating attractive terms in the spheres of 
finance, credit, tax, customs, investment, and price, and 
simplifying the system for exports of spare parts. And, 
importantly, it is finally time to give military-industrial 
complex enterprises the right to autonomously export arms and 
military hardware that is manufactured over and above the state 
order. 
  One last point. In our view, it would be a good thing for 
certain other departments, the Defense Ministry in particular, 
which has shrouded itself in a tight veil of secrecy, to learn 
from the Goskomoboronprom's openness. However, practice shows 
that trivial breaches of the law and departmental anarchy often 
lurk behind this veil. In spite of everything, secret Defense 
Ministry materials vanish westward, not to mention the strictly 
internal information that floods into newspapers like grain from 
a holey sack.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "In the Russian Federation </F>
Defense Ministry" rubric: "The Time Has Come for Military 
Trading System To Reorganize Itself Too"] 
  [Text] In view of numerous complaints about trade and 
consumer services in military garrisons, the Russian Federation 
defense minister has decided to check the financial, economic, 
and production activity of the Ministry of Defense Main Trade 
Directorate. This task was assigned to the Main Military Budget 
and Finance Directorate. 
  The audit, which was carried out in a number of districts 
and 
at central supply and purchasing bases and industrial 
enterprises in the military trading system, exposed a number of 
blatant violations of existing legislation on entrepreneurial 
activity, of financial and executive discipline, and of 
regulations governing the conduct of trade. The wide-ranging 
economic rights granted in recent years to military trade organs 
in the center and provinces have not been properly exercised to 
improve the quality of trade and consumer services to servicemen 
and their families. The necessary radical measures to reform 
the military trading system have simply not been taken. 
  Despite the fact that, following the Union's disintegration, 
the number of enterprises has sharply decreased and the number 
of personnel in the military trading system has been halved, an 
unjustifiably cumbersome and ramified structure for 
administering it has been preserved to this day. With the 
organization of direct ties between military trade enterprises 
and suppliers, many supply and purchasing bases have been left 
with practically no work. But the chronic shortage of 
circulating capital and the poor stocking of stores with 
essential goods have not prompted the Ministry of Defense Main 
Trade Directorate to cut superfluous levels or identify ways to 
economize. On the contrary, administration organs' 
establishments are inordinately inflated, while their staffers 
-- officers and civilian personnel -- have received premiums 
exceeding their basic pay in addition to their wages. 
  It has become the practice to hold back at bases the most 
popular goods in order to sell them for less than their market 
value in inflationary conditions through the trade network to a 
narrow circle of people, which has caused indignation and 
complaints among servicemen. Considerable sums of money have 
been diverted into nontrading activities. A total of around 20 
billion rubles was deposited in bank savings accounts, which 
adversely affected the procurement of industrial and food goods 
for sale in stores. 
  In all military districts and fleets instances of giving 
consumers short measure and overcharging them, concealing scarce 
goods, and deliberate inflation of prices have been discovered. 
Overcharging occurred in one-half of the control purchases made. 
These outrages were most prevalent in the Pacific Fleet, the 
Siberian Military District, and the Western Group of Forces. 
  Work to bring down the cost of food is not being conducted 
actively enough. Even when, under the defense minister's 
directive No. D-34, military units and institutions are 
providing the military trading system with transport, premises, 
and free electricity, fuel, water, and other utilities, the cost 
of food in military trade cafeterias remains very high, and in a 
number of cases higher than in the open public catering network. 
For example, in Volgograd Garrison (North Caucasus Military 
District) prices in military trade cafeterias were 1.2-1.6 times 
higher than prices in the city's cafeterias. It is no accident 
that lately the number of officers and staffers using military 
trade cafeterias has decreased by between one-third and one-half. 
  The Russian defense minister has issued an order based on 
the 
results of the audit of the military trading system's financial 
and economic work. It notes the aforementioned and other 
serious shortcomings, punishes the culprits, and outlines 
radical organizational and economic measures to improve the 
military trading system's activity forthwith. This question 
will be discussed in the near future at a Defense Ministry 
Collegium session.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau February 1 TASS -- The Dniester authorities 
will thwart the elections to the Moldovan parliament on its 
territory, Valeri Litskay, state secretary of the unrecognised 
Dniester republic, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  If the Moldovan leadership sends mobile polling stations and 
foreign observers to the Dniester region, they will be barred by 
armed patrols which are stationed on bridges across the Dniester 
in compliance with the state of emergency proclaimed in the 
Dniester region. 
  Incidentally, the Dniester parliament adopted a decision on 
Tuesday to hold elections to local bodies of self-rule next 
April. 
  Within the next two months, a special commission is to 
submit 
a new concept of local self-rule to the Dniester parliament in 
connection with the new political and economic situation in the 
region. Several local lawmakers suggested that a referendum on 
the Dniester republic's future should be held along with the 
elections. 
  Moldovan Deputy Parliament Speaker Viktor Pushkash described 
these actions of Tiraspol authorities as "anticonstitutional and 
contravening international laws". According to the deputy 
speaker, many voters on the Dniester west bank wish to 
participate in the elections, which is corroborated by letters 
coming to Chisinau and telephone calls. 
  "However, armed patrols stationed by the Tiraspol leaders on 
all roads turned the territory into a reservation of a kind," 
Pushkash stressed. "I'm sure," he continued, "that the Dniester 
leaders will raise difficulties for those who will want to vote 
and try to prevent people from going to the right bank. 
  "Despite an opposition from the Tiraspol leaders, we meet 
and 
will meet our voters in left-bank districts and will try to 
provide them will a chance to vote on the election day."

  [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur said it was in 
Moldova's vital interests to maintain its links with other 
former Soviet republics. 
  This would provide a basis for surmounting the present 
economic crisis in Moldova, Snegur told U.S. Congress expert 
Sergio Verona in Chisinau on Monday. 
  But Moldova would join no political or military CIS 
treaties, 
for it wanted to remain "genuinely neutral," he said. 
  Going over to the problem of Transdniestria, Snegur said the 
leaders of the mainly Russian-speaking enclave refused to start 
a dialogue with the Moldovan government, since the latter 
rejected their idea of confederative structure for Moldova. 
  Commenting on Moldova's relations with Romania, Snegur said 
those advocating unification between Moldova and Romania 
"thereby put up obstacles to the economic and cultural mutual 
integration of the two states."

  [Text] Moldova's Premier Andrey Sangeli said that Moldova 
must restore all economic relations with the former USSR 
republics and introduce itself to these states' markets in fresh 
way. He said in an interview with Interfax that Moldova would 
"be paying for its recent errors for a long time." 
  "Many states' producers are happy to have a stable market 
for 
realization of their production. We voluntarily turned away 
from the Eastern market," the premier remarked. 
  Sangeli emphasized that the current government was 
energetically working to restore the relations with the eastern 
neighbors and to enhance the relations with the Western states. 
  "It is very important that the law on investment start 
working. We have it but we need political stability to make it 
work. This is essential," Sangeli emphasized. 
  In his opinion, the coming parliamentary elections on 
February 27 will allow to lay a foundation for stability in the 
republic. "These are specific decisive elections. The problem 
is: now or never," Sangeli said. 
  He believes that a political force must come to power which 
will form the government and resolve other issues: the 
constitution's adoption, the issue on Transdniestria and the 
country's territorial integrity. 
  Sangeli is now on holidays due to the fact that he is 
running 
for the parliamentary elections from the Agrarian Democratic 
Party's ticket.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Ivan Rybkin, speaker of 
the State Duma (lower chamber of the Russian parliament), 
presented President Boris Yeltsin with a bouquet of red roses, 
since Yeltsin's name-day is on Tuesday [1 February]. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt from Valeriy Gerasimov, head of the State 
Duma's office, that "the meeting between the two lasted 45 
minutes instead of the planned ten". The sides discussed 
cooperation between the president and the lower house. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS about the meaning of the notion 
"succession of the State Duma" which will be debated at the 
Duma's session this Friday, Gerasimov replied that "we mean 
succession from pre-revolutionary time, since the present State 
Duma is not the first in Russian history". 
  According to Gerasimov, legislators intend to study valuable 
experience accumulated by Russian dumas before and after 1917, 
mindful also of positive achievements of the former Russian 
parliament. 
  Gerasimov refuted rumours about a possible intention by the 
State Duma to put forth property claims, saying that the lower 
chamber intends to dissociate itself from petty property issues. 
  According to Gerasimov, the State Duma will deal only with 
projects which cannot be financed from local budgets, including 
the State Duma library in St. Petersburg as well as the 
Tavricheskiy Palace in the same city where inter-parliamentary 
assemblies of the Commonwealth of Independent States are held.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
1320 GMT on 1 February broadcasts a report by Aleksandr 
Ruvinskiy in the studio. He says that many Federation Council 
deputies came to Chekhov St. to pay their last respects to actor 
Yevgeniy Leonov. As there was no morning session the deputies 
had plenty of spare time. They spent the time holding the first 
organizational sessions of committees and commissions of the 
Federation Council. 
  Whereas, he says, in the Duma, the Duma Council met and 
agreed on who would head the committees, these people were 
ratified by overall vote and then each deputy could register in 
one committee or another. 
  On the other hand, here in the Federation Council it was 
different. First, the composition of the actual committees was 
formed, and then within these committees the deputies themselves 
elected their own chairmen. This is because a factional party 
principle does not operate in the Federation Council. 
  There were some surprises, Ruvinskiy continues. Vyacheslav 
Zvolinskiy became chairman of the Agrarian Committee. He is 
director of the scientific production association Nizhnyaya 
Volga in Astrakhan. On this committee are such deputies as 
Vasiliy Starodubtsev, [Vyacheslav] Lyubimov from Ryazan, an 
active member of the Communist Party, and others. Today, the 
first session of the committee was held. 
  The first session of the Committee for Budget and Finance 
was 
also held. On this committee, deputies elected Nikolay Gonchar 
as their chairman, former chairman of Mossovet. Also on this 
committee are such deputies as Yuriy Boldyrev, well-known from 
the Congress of USSR People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet. 
  Ruvinskiy then speaks to Boldyrev. He says that Boldyrev 
told him that he considers one of his main tasks as being to do 
everything necessary to fight corruption. He thinks a chamber 
of accounts should be set up and there should be a law on 
responsibility of government members for nonimplementation of 
legislation and for inappropriate expenditure. 
  Ruvinskiy and the announcer discuss the question of 
extending 
the emergency in North Ossetia and Ingushetia.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Zaynashev report under the general headline: </F>
"Crimea: Kiev Is Preparing an Attack, Russia Prefers To 
Abstain"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the Federation Council in Moscow 
discussed the Crimean issue only in the lobby. In an interview 
for MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, Eduard Rossel, the failed governor 
of the Urals Republic, waved his hand enthusiastically: "Crimea 
is a Russian land, and I favor its being reclaimed by Russia as 
soon as possible." When asked by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS how 
much time the construction of a dam or a bridge across the Kerch 
strait will take, Mr. Rossel, of German origin, revealed that he 
knew firms that could cope with such an order fairly quickly. 
The bridge that would connect the Russian Federation with 
Crimea could be built vertically and lowered later when the 
situation allows. The cautious Nikolay Gonchar, guarding his 
reputation as a centrist, said that Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov is a good and calm person, but that Moscow and Kiev 
should touch upon the Crimean issue very carefully so as not to 
carry matters to the brink of war. Mr. Gonchar called on both 
the president and the Federation Council to agree on a common 
stand on the Crimean issue so as not to transplant local 
passions to Moscow. Formerly, the stances of the president and 
the Russian Supreme Soviet regarding Crimea were diametrically 
opposed, a fact that was skillfully exploited by Crimean 
extremists.

  [Text] Moscow February 2 TASS -- The Federation Council 
(upper chamber of the Russian Parliament) started debating on 
Wednesday amendments to its draft regulations. The editing 
commission made 173 amendments to the draft. 
  Two amendments were made by the Russian president. He 
proposed that the upper chamber should take into account, when 
voting, the total number of Federation Council members (178 
under the constitution) and not the number of elected 
legislators (171) if the chamber votes on such decisions as 
release from the posts of upper chamber speaker and his depties 
as well as elections of members of upper chamber committees. 
  The presidential amendments were turned down. 
  The Federation Council continues discussing the draft 
regulations, and, to all appearances, the debate will take the 
rest of the day.

<F P=106> [Unscheduled interview with Valentin Kovalev, deputy </F>
chairman of the State Duma, by correspondent V.Perfilyev; place 
and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Perfilyev] Valentin Alekseyevich, the State 
Duma is to continue its work tomorrow. So, what are the 
priority aims you are setting yourselves? 
  [Kovalev] The first package of bills the State Duma will 
adopt urgently concerns the economic sphere of our state's life. 
What concept are we proceeding from in doing this? Nowhere in 
the world is there such a thing as a free market, an absolutely 
free market. Therefore, if we strive for a free market, we are 
going nowhere -- mankind has long gone elsewhere. There exists 
a regulated market, and moreover, I am going to utter a word 
which is not at all popular in our country at the moment -- a 
market which can be planned. [passage omitted] 
  It is important to overcome the crisis resulting from 
nonpayments; it is important to restore economic ties that have 
been severed. If necessary, the question of the composition of 
enterprises may be raised. [passage omitted] 
  Now about some of our plans in more detail. It happens that 
the military-industrial complex plays an important role in our 
country's economy. One can be critical of such an orientation 
of our economy in the past, but nevertheless this is a fact 
which we cannot disregard. Therefore, our goal is to rebuild 
the high technology market and to reestablish our status on the 
world market. 
  [Perfilyev] Judging by your attitude to economic issues and 
to how reforms should be carried out, the State Duma should have 
no problems with the government and with the policy of reform 
currently being pursued by Viktor Chernomyrdin? 
  [Kovalev] The Russian Federation State Duma will have its 
own 
point of view on these issues. As for the new government, we 
are planning to hear a report of the chairman of the Council of 
Ministers on this matter. I think this will help to clarify 
many points and to determine the Duma's standpoint with regard 
to the present government and to the economic development of the 
country as a whole. [passage omitted] 
  We also have a number of questions to the government, some 
of 
them not too pleasant. One of them concerns privatization. We 
consider that the issue of privatization should be viewed from a 
broader angle. [passage omitted] We consider that other forms 
of reorganization and denationalization are possible. More 
specifically, a large group of deputies believes that the fixed 
capital of enterprises could be transferred to work collectives 
which would be responsible for its operational management, while 
the products made by those work collectives should certainly be 
their property and be fully owned and disposable by them. 
  [Perfilyev] Valentin Alekseyevich, many officials in our 
country have undertaken to fight crime but somehow their 
attempts have always fallen through. Will the State Duma be 
able to do anything in this respect? 
  [Kovalev] I can give you my own view on why those laws have 
never worked. The reason is that they have not been aimed to 
affect the causes and conditions from which crime springs. 
[passage omitted] Our viewers should know that issues of 
fighting crime are in the focus of attention of the State Duma. 
At this time we are preparing a large package of special 
proposals aimed at combating corruption and fighting organized 
crime. Possibly as soon as next Friday we shall discuss a 
number of amendments and additions to the criminal code. The 
amendments will include expanding the limits of self-defense 
[weapons and devices] 
  [Perfilyev] You attend all the sessions and have inside 
information about the life of the State Duma. Would you like to 
sketch a collective potrait of the State Duma for our viewers? 
  [Kovalev] The people who have been elected are people who 
act 
and not just talk. They know how to work and how to translate 
their words into deeds. So I think the Duma has very good 
prospects.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Shokorev, from the All-Russia Center for </F>
the Study of Public Opinion, under the "Survey" rubric: "The 
Population Denied Confidence Neither to the Premier, Nor to 
Yegor Gaydar"] 
  [Text] The population's first reaction to the government 
crisis, or more precisely, to Yegor Gaydar's quitting the post 
of vice premier, was indifference. This sense prevails over all 
others in a little bit more than a third of those polled. It 
can be added that some 10 percent found it hard to answer the 
question on what they felt about Yegor Gaydar's quitting. 
Anxiety was experienced by 18 percent, distress by 15 percent. 
The main feeling in 17 percent was satisfaction, and if one 
takes into account the fact that nearly half of them are 
supporters of communists and national patriots, that feeling is 
quite deep. 
  The answers to the question on confidence in some political 
leaders asked in the same All-Russia Center for the Study of 
Public Opinion survey can be divided into two parts: the number 
of those who answered or did not answer the question on trusting 
a political leader, and the correlation between trusting and 
mistrusting. The first parameter seems to be as significant as 
the second one. Whereas the trust-mistrust balance is in the 
positive area, with more than half the respondents unable to say 
what they thought about the leaders, the result obtained seems 
to be doubtful. 
  The trust-mistrust correlation and the known-unknown degree 
for all the leaders are represented below [diagram omitted]. 
The group of Grigoriy Yavlinskiy-Viktor Chernomyrdin-Boris 
Yeltsin-Yegor Gaydar is unified by the rather high degree of 
their being "well- known." The distribution of views about 
Grigoriy Yavlinskiy evinces what can be termed as the 
"Yavlinskiy phenomenon." He is trusted by twice as many people 
as those who do not trust him; nearly 35 percent, however, did 
not say what they thought about him. 
  The prime minister's position appears to be ideal in the 
positive area with a rather low share of those who found the 
question hard to answer. The poll, however, had been conducted 
even before the final composition of the government was 
announced. The Boris Yeltsin- Yegor Gaydar crew remained in the 
minds of the respondents for some time after 20 January. 
Despite Mr. Gaydar's resignation, his name remains associated 
with the president's course. 
  The other group is Andrey Kozyrev-Boris Fedorov. They are 
united by a positive trust-mistrust correlation, and a big 
number of those who found the question hard to answer. Vladimir 
Shumeyko and Anatoliy Chubays are found in the negative area 
with approximately the same number of those who assessed their 
activities. 
  Two figures -- Gennadiy Burbulis and Gennadiy Zyuganov -- 
are 
found separately, and way below them is Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
whose scandalous fame makes him known to a great number of 
respondents. Only 17 percent trust him, however, while 63 
percent do not. Way down on the extreme right of the scale is 
newly elected State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin. The number of 
those who did not answer the question on trusting him is 
two-thirds of those polled, whereas the trust-mistrust 
correlation lies in the negative area.

  [Text] Petersburg -- Leningrad Oblast residents will now 
have to get used to new names of the territories of former 
village soviets -- they will be called volosts, "in the old 
fashion." Under the directive of oblast administration head 
Aleksandr Belyakov, 219 volosts have been formed to replace 230 
village soviets. Executive power in them will be exercised by 
headmen [starosta]. The oblast administration is also receding 
into the past: It is being transformed into the government of 
Leningrad Oblast. The head of the administration becomes 
chairman of the Council of Ministers and simultaneously 
governor, while his four deputies are elevated to the rank of 
vice premiers. Instead of departments, ministries are now being 
created. For the time being the territory of Leningrad Oblast 
will retain administrative rayons to be led by the rayon 
administration. But the new government does not rule out the 
possibility that they will in time be transformed into uyezds.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1521 GMT on 1 February carries a 
"Path to Accord" program, which examines the continuing problem 
of ensuring the return of people displaced by the conflict 
between North Ossetia and Ingushetia. In the first 11 minutes 
of the program, the announcer interviews ordinary people on both 
sides of the conflict, some of them refugees. The program then 
shows alternating excerpts of separate interviews with North 
Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and President of Ingushetia 
Ruslan Aushev. 
  In his interview, Galazov denies that any interethnic 
conflict has occurred in North Ossetia, saying that what 
happened was "an aggression by Ingush national extremists." 
Aushev says on this topic: "The motives behind this conflict 
were to push out the Ingush, carry out ethnic cleansing, then to 
declare that coexistence was impossible, and then to play at 
these lengthy negotiations." 
  Galazov says: "North Ossetia is, essentially, the only 
republic, not just in the North Caucasus but in the Caucasus as 
a whole, to which so-called Russian-speaking people flee. Today 
we have approximately 50,000 refugees. These are refugees from 
Georgia, from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Abkhazia, Chechnya, and 
Ingushetia, and this fact alone probably says much." Aushev says 
that but for the housing problem the influx of Russian-speaking 
refugees into his republic would be more intensive. He claims 
that Ingushetia has done more for its ethnic minorities than 
Ossetia, for instance by guaranteeing them a set number of seats 
in parliament. 
  Asked if he regards the tens of thousands of Ingush refugees 
who fled from North Ossetia to Ingushetia as citizens of his 
republic, Galazov disputes the numbers and questions whether all 
of them were refugees, adding: "I believe that the Kislovodsk 
agreement is a very reasonable agreement and it should be 
implemented in full. There must be an investigation into who 
was not involved in the bloody tragedy which was committed on 
the territory of North Ossetia. After all, no one even fired 
from a toy catapult on the territory of the Ingush Republic. 
The tragedy occurred on the territory of North Ossetia and the 
North Ossetian side, that is the leadership and public 
organizations and movements can bear no responsibility 
whatsoever for what occurred." 
  On the question of whether the two peoples could live 
together, Aushev says: "Whoever does not wish to live with the 
Ingush is free to leave. All the more so, since they have been 
living in other people's houses since 1944. According to 
highland customs, they should really have long since asked 
forgiveness of the Ingush for moving into their homes and should 
have left, as was done in Georgia, Dagestan, and Stavropol Kray." 
  Asked about the idea of joint ownership of the disputed 
territory, Galazov says that he finds such attempts to resolve 
the problem at a stroke "unacceptable," and adds: "In actual 
fact there is no disputed territory in North Ossetia. 
Prigorodnyy Rayon, like all the other rayons of North Ossetia, 
is an integral part of the Republic of North Ossetia. And 
according to the constitution of the Russian Federation and our 
constitution, the whole territory of North Ossetia is at the 
disposal of the multinational people of that republic alone. 
Neither the president nor the Supreme Soviet [as heard] has the 
right to do anything with this territory. And I would ask both 
the leadership of the Russian Federation, and moreover the 
leadership of the Ingush Republic, to stop conducting 
experiments." 
  Aushev says that his attitude to people's ideas is positive 
"as long as they produce results" and adds: "I believe that at 
this stage we should not be talking about new formulae. The 
first stage should be a stage of people returning to their homes 
and a stabilization of the situation to the level of October 
1992." 
  Galazov says: "The impossibility of the coexistence of 
Ingush, Ossetians, and representatives of other nationalities is 
not an Ossetian nor a Russian invention. This is something 
which people of Ingush nationality have proved in practice." On 
this same subject, Aushev says: "This is a fascist slogan. How 
can one speak of the impossibility of one living with another?" 
  In conclusion, Galazov says: "All conflicts on this planet 
will sooner or later be resolved peacefully. There is no other 
way. But I believe that events should not be hastened because 
any use of force, any attempt to settle the problem immediately 
will result in more tragedy, will result in more bloodshed and 
human victims." 
  Aushev concludes: "In order to emerge from this conflict we 
need to live strictly according to the law and to the 
constitution and to observe human rights." 
  Vladimir Lozovoy, head of the Interim Administration on the 
territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, rounds up the 
program by saying that the only way to settle the conflict and 
reconcile people is by political methods. He adds: "I believe 
the main thing today is for the leaders of these two republics 
to sit down at the negotiating table and work out there what 
each side should do, not only to extinguish but also to settle 
the conflict and to begin returning people to their previous 
homes."

  [Text] Chita -- Chechnya continues its diplomatic moves to 
secure the release from the Lefortovo detention center of former 
Russian parliamentary speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, who is 
regarded in the republic as having been unlawfully arrested. 
This was reported in an INTERFAX interview on Thursday by 
Eduard Khashkayev, a member of the Chechnya cabinet. 
  In Khashkayev's opinion, the October events in Moscow 
resulted from "a whole series of unlawful actions committed by 
the Russian leadership, which was opposed by Ruslan Khasbulatov, 
who strictly complied with all the provisions of the then 
Russian Federation Constitution." 
  Chechen State Counselor Ruslan Akhtakhanov, who took part in 
the conversation with the INTERFAX correspondent, stated that 
denying Ruslan Khasbulatov, who is a citizen of Chechnya, the 
opportunity to run for election to the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly is regarded by the republic's population as 
another violation of human rights by Moscow officialdom.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Akimov and Amangeldiy </F>
Akhmetalimov] 
  [Text] Almaty January 31 TASS -- The foreign minister of 
Kazakhstan denied allegations that his country is revising its 
nuclear-free status and said republican authorities will probe 
all circumstances which led to a publication in the Iranian 
"JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI" newspaper which said that the Central Asian 
republic will not give up its nuclear arsenal. 
  "This is a newspaper canard which does not deserve any 
attention", Tuleutay Suleymenov said on Monday. 
  The newspaper quoted Kazakh Ambassador in Tehran Myrzatay 
Dzholdasbekov as saying that Kazakhstan does not intend to 
eliminate or relocate its nuclear weapons to any other place 
until non-use of such weapons is guaranteed at the world level 
and the planet gets rid of them. 
  It was stressed that this was the official position which 
was 
to be conveyed to the U.S. Administration during a visit of 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev to the United States which is to 
take place in two weeks. 
  Kazakhstan "joined the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last 
December and ratified it, as well as the START I treaty", 
Suleymenov said adding that instruments of ratification will be 
exchanged with the United States during the visit of Nazarbayev 
in mid-February. 
  "Moreover, Kazakhstan together with Belarus made a 
considerable contribution to the work which was completed in 
Moscow by Presidents of Russia, the United States and ukraine", 
Suleymenov said referring to the trilateral agreement according 
to which Ukraine gives up its nuclear weapons. 
  "Our republic never strived to be a nuclear state. It has 
experienced its deadly danger. Five hundred nuclear tests have 
been conducted at the Semipalatinsk range which is closed now. 
Hundreds of thousands of Kazakhs are still suffering from their 
aftermath and we all view disposing of the weapons as a 
benefit", the minister said. He added that Kazakh official 
authorities are trying to probe all the circumstances which 
resulted in the publication in "JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI" which "rudely 
distorted the republican position on nuclear weapons". Most 
evidently, the newspaper is guilty of wishful thinking, but it 
is not ruled out that the words of the ambassador were distorted 
for some reason.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev told Interfax that a 
military cooperation treaty with Russia would be signed shortly. 
He had sent a draft of the treaty to Russia's Boris Yeltsin 
"back in March," following which the two governments were told 
to finalize the document. 
  The document "tackles the issues of military cooperation and 
use of testing grounds in Kazakhstan and the Baykonur space 
launch pad." Nazarbayev explained that the treaty also provided 
for training of Kazakh officers in Russia, cooperation in 
manufacture of weapons and coordination in drafting a common 
military doctrine. 
  "If we are to create a common defense space, which is what 
Kazakhstan wants, we have to cooperate very closely in border 
protection, personnel training, military doctrine and other 
areas, the president said. 
  In his view, the Russian army would have to spend huge sums 
of money to build new testing grounds if it ceased to use those 
in Kazakhstan. Over 32.5 Mn hectares were in the past used for 
testing grounds while making such large areas available for 
military needs is out of the question now. Kazakhstan is 
prepared to lease the installations there on mutually beneficial 
conditions. 
  The Kazakh president dismissed the reports that Almaty had 
demanded that Russia pay $7 Bn yearly rent for the Baykonur 
launch pad. He emphasized, however, that Russia was not the 
sole country that kept Baykonur in working order. Kazakhstan 
supplied 1 Bn kW hrs of energy yearly to Baykonur which also 
used underground water, which "is in short supply in the 
Syr-Daria River." New buildings in Baykonur were constructed of 
Kazakh materials. "For this reason, the expenses of renting 
Baykonur for joint operation by Ukrainian, Russian and Kazakh 
rocketry are being computed," Nazarbayev said. 
  (Interfax Note: Russian and Kazakh negotiating teams in the 
talks which started in Moscow Monday are discussing the text of 
a new agreement on the status and operation of the launch pad 
and the town of Leninsk. According to a spokesman for the 
Russian Space Agency, the treaty on the lease of Baykonur and 
the issue of which legislation would be in existence in the 
areas rented from Kazakhstan are issues that will be discussed 
shortly.) 
  The president thinks that discussion of the status of 
Russian 
troops in Kazakhstan would be premature at this stage. He said 
that he had an understanding with Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, with whom he had met in Davos, Switzerland, during 
the World Economic Forum, on having experts to meet in early 
February in order to hammer out an agreement on the issues 
involved. 
  Nazarbayev rejected accusations of conservative thinking 
leveled at Chernomyrdin and his new government by the Russian 
press and recalled that Chernomyrdin's activities during the 
Moscow events of October 3 and 4, when he was unambiguously on 
President Yeltsin's side, had been welcomed by the mass media. 
Now it is wrong to describe him as a hardliner even before the 
government has announced its program, the Kazakh president said. 
  Currently any Russian government "will have to stay on the 
course of reform," Nazarbayev thinks.

<F P=106> [Article by Baykonur Cosmodrome Chief Aleksandr Shumilin </F>
under the "Space" rubric: "Rockets Still Blast Off. What Lies 
in Store for Baykonur?"] 
  [Text] The mass media of many countries readily publish 
materials on the fate of Baykonur Cosmodrome. The business, 
scientific, and political world is concerned about the problem 
of preserving this unique creation of human hands. 
  "Farewell, Baykonur," "The Destruction of Baykonur Is the 
Tragedy of the Century," "Nightmare at the Cosmodrome" -- this 
is a far from complete list of the headlines in Russian and 
foreign newspapers and magazines. 
  But what is the true state of affairs? In an attempt to 
answer this question, representatives of the U.S. firm of Anser 
-- Messrs. R. Dalby and B. Alexander -- visited Baykonur last 
year. After spending less than two days at the cosmodrome and 
viewing the launch and technical complexes of the Soyuz, Proton, 
and Energiya carrier rockets (30 minutes at each complex), the 
guests happily set off home. Not even a high-class specialist 
is able to assess the technical condition of very complex 
systems in such a short space of time, apart from forming an 
impression of their outward appearance. But the U.S. experts 
drew hasty conclusions without a moment's hesitation: "The 
breakup of the USSR has not affected Baykonur's potential." In 
their haste the gentlemen from across the ocean did not attach 
any significance to the following "trifle": Of the 40 major 
organizations involved in implementing space programs in past 
years, just over 10 are left today. The test cosmodrome now 
functions only thanks to military specialists carrying out their 
official duty in bleak climatic conditions and in the 
humiliating position of an indeterminate legal status. The 
potential of the military contingent, which is fatigued as a 
result of everyday troubles, is not infinite, however. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. experts maintain that the tragic situation 
in which the servicemen find themselves has been "greatly and 
deliberately" exaggerated. This is allegedly being done for the 
sole purpose of "squeezing" more money out of the government. 
  But why did the Americans need to "put a gloss" on the 
situation? It is no secret that a worldwide struggle is being 
waged for a place in the "space Klondyke." And anything goes in 
this struggle, as the saying goes. Baykonur really is in need 
of serious assistance to maintain impeccable technical 
readiness. One or two glitches in carrying out international 
programs, and it would mean the end of the world reputation of 
the unique complex. Is this not the version that the gentlemen 
from Anser had in mind? 
  P. Berlin, another U.S. expert, is still more subtly cunning 
when he concludes: "The risk in contracts for commercial 
launches appears insignificant." In short, the cosmodrome is in 
full order, with the exception that there is "no comfort" at 
Leninsk. Not that this will hamper commercial launches in any 
way. And yet Mr. Berlin must know that it is only possible to 
win the competition for a commercial satellite launch by giving 
the client solid service, including a high-class hotel, "car 
keys," excellent roads to the launch site, and so on. Leninsk 
is not ready for this today. Additional capital investments are 
also needed, otherwise Russia will quit the space market 
empty-handed. 
  More than 20 delegations from the United States, France, 
Germany, India, Turkey, and other countries have visited the 
cosmodrome recently. Guests arrive at the invitation and under 
the patronage of Russian firms such as the "Energiya" Science 
and Production Association, the M.V. Khrunichev Association, the 
Space Research Institute, the Russian Space Agency, and the 
National Aerospace Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The 
delegations are different, but they are all united by one thing: 
Not once has anyone deemed it necessary to notify the 
cosmodrome's command of their visit. 
  On the other hand, both the Kazakhstani press and Russian 
newspapers keep "chewing" over an old story with a persistence 
worthy of better application -- the cosmodrome's servicemen want 
to create a military space base on the republic's territory. 
The local newspaper altogether accuses us of wishing to 
"militarize space." 
  The most popular "refrain" in numerous local press 
statements 
is the assertion that the Republic of Kazakhstan is the 
cosmodrome's master. Askar Nurmanov, a specialist of the 
Kazakhstani Aerospace Agency, declared: "We unexpectedly found 
ourselves the possessors of such a structure and were not ready 
to exploit it." I will comment that considerable funds, in 
addition to high-class specialists (whom Kazakhstan does not 
have today), are needed for the normal "exploitation" of the 
cosmodrome. According to last year's estimates, 38 billion 
rubles are needed annually. 
  Until this year, however, this sum was distributed between 
Russia and Kazakhstan in the following proportion: Russia paid 
94 percent, and Kazakhstan just 6 percent. Since Baykonur is 
located on Kazakhstani soil, this implied that the rest was 
covered by leasing the land allocated to the cosmodrome and the 
landing zone. 
  As far as this is legitimate, let the economists and 
financiers -- in short, those whose job it is -- resolve 
matters. To date a whole package of documents regulating many 
questions has already been adopted. There is the creation of an 
open-type joint-stock company at the cosmodrome. The granting 
of privileges to all specialists who come to us to work. 
Finally, a memorandum has been signed which attempts to 
regulate the interests of all the sides involved in fulfilling 
space programs. 
  Unfortunately, as practice has shown, many documents do not 
entirely remove the tension. But the main point is that efforts 
are being made to this end. 
  We are prepared to meet journalists and experts, specialists 
and dilettantes, to show and tell them everything the way it is. 
Our only request is one which Mikhail Bulgakov expressed 
exhaustively on addressing young litterateurs: "Write what you 
see, and do not write what you do not see!"

  [Text] Almaty February 1 TASS -- Kazakhstan is to get a one 
billion 344,100 thousand USD worth of credits from foreign 
countries and international banks in 1994, Akejan Kazhegeldin, 
first deputy prime minister of Kazakhstan told a press 
conference on Tuesday. 
  The International Monetary Fund allots 255 mln [million] USD 
for the National Bank of Kazakhstan to support the national 
currency. Another 719.3 mln USD are to enable the government to 
compensate for the deficit of the balance of payments and 
support the budget. 
  Credits on goods are expected to total 96.9 mln USD which 
will be used to pay for products and services imported from the 
creditor countries. 
  The technical loan offered by foreign countries will total 
72.9 mln USD which will be used to repay the costs of visiting 
foreign experts and training students. 
  Japan has provided credits to Kazakhstan for the first time 
in history: It has alloted 220 mln USD with 20 to 25-year-long 
period of repayment. 
  The loans are given on rather favourable terms, the first 
deputy prime minister pointed out in reply to a question. 
  He described a system of control to be implemented to 
supervise the actual use of all types of the loans. The money 
will mostly be used to fund specific economic and industrial 
projects. The borrowers will assume responsibility for the 
loans.

  [Text] [Tajikistan's] Prime Minister Abduljalil Samadov 
says attempts to try to maintain the command system of economic 
management are hopeless. 
  In a published appeal to the people, Samadov said that all 
official talks were now focused on mutual sales and payments but 
not on former obligatory sale to the state. He says the 
existing realities place the need for program correctives and 
the arrangement of normal market relations in domestic and 
foreign trade. 
  Samadov called on Tajik citizens to come up with coherent 
proposals on how to improve the functioning of economic 
mechanisms and effectively utilize the country's natural and 
human resources. He hopes that the system of accounting for as 
diversity of views will work on a permanent basis rather than 
being a short-lived time campaign. [sentence as received] 
  Many say the Prime Minister's call is intended to arrange 
close cooperation between the government and private sector in 
the effort to embrace economic reforms.

  [Text] Yerevan, February 1 (SNARK)--Today the Armenian 
Parliament has almost unanimously given its consent to institute 
criminal proceedings against Myasnik Hakopyan, the chairman of 
the Council of Businessmen, Leaseholders and Cooperators. He is 
prosecuted for misappropriation of state property of great 
dimensions. 
  Artavazd Gevorkyan, the general prosecutor of Armenia, 
states 
the chairman of the Businessmen's Council misappropriated by 
means of machinations and forgery more than 34 million rubles. 
2000 cartridges were found during his apartment's search. 
  Myasnik Hakopyan was one of the candidates on the 
president's 
post. 
  The parliament's consent was necessary because 
Dashnaktsutyun 
Party had proposed Hakopyan as a candidate to the Supreme Soviet 
of Armenia. Therefore, Dashnaktsutyun demanded his immediate 
release and remonstrated at the Office of Public Prosecutor.

  [Text] Yerevan, February 1 (SNARK)--Armenia falls into the 
medium degree of classification with the status of a less 
developed country. There is nothing wrong with this 
international status we got not so long ago, for over the last 
three years the gross national product has abruptly fallen. 
This information was told to SNARK today by the Armenian 
Minister for Economics Armen Yegiazaryan. He states that the 
real gross national product in 1990 was on the level of 4 700 
[figure as received] dollars per head. Last year it became 
700-800 dollars per head. 
  In Yegiazaryan's opinion, it would be incorrect to increase 
the incomes artificially, and at this stage there is no 
alternative to the policy of "tightening the belt". The 
minister thinks the three indexations of wages since January 1 
speak in favor of this assertion, as in conformity with the 
expectations there was no essential rise of the prices. "We have 
a situation in Armenia when the insolvency of the mainstream led 
to the drastic consumers' market contraction and, therefore, 
supply decrease", concluded the minister for economics.

year a forum of the country's democratic forces to mark the 50th 
anniversary of Estonia's liberation from fascist occupation. 
  The assembly suggests that the forum work out a program for 
joint action under the motto, "For healing the society, against 
nationalism, interethnic animosity and moral degradation." 
  "The seemingly eradicated fascism is again raising its head, 
sometimes under the guise of false liberalism, sometimes hiding 
behind patriotic slogans, and sometimes even quite openly," the 
assembly said in a statement adopted at its Jan. 29 session. 
"Not to notice it is dangerous; not to take action, criminal." 
  The assembly calls on all Estonian social and political 
forces to aim their efforts at stabilizing the society, 
improving interethnic relations and "guaranteeing human rights 
in reality."

  [Text] Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs returned today from 
the World Economic Forum in Davos. In the following recording, 
you will hear an assessment of this forum given by Birkavs at 
the airport right after he returned to Riga: 
  [Begin Birkavs recording] Defining the Baltic lands in 
Europe 
and the world...in fact, one must conclude that what the 
previous economic forums defined--declaring in 1973 that they 
were going from fixed to floating exchange rates in the 
world--that this is the end of the economic consequences of 
World War II. And in 1989, when the Singing Revolution and all 
other kinds of revolutions began in Europe, they declared that 
that was the end of the political consequences of World War II. 
Neither the economic nor the political consequences of World 
War II have, in fact, been liquidated, and, in this sense, the 
Baltic question is one of those consequences of World War II 
that have not been liquidated. This was very 
significant--especially because it was not a Baltic seminar, but 
a Baltic-Nordic one, and this is where we were linked. 
  The question of Baltic unity: It was a fairly fundamental 
emphasis to demonstrate our unity even though Russia was trying 
to introduce a certain dissonance, for which perhaps there is 
some small basis. And there was talk from the rostrum that only 
two countries, Estonia and Latvia, have developed in a direction 
that distances them ever further from Russia. Lithuania is 
bound by its policies more to Russia. At the World Economic 
Forum, nearly all the conversations ended, one way or another, 
with Russia. The world is concerned about Russia's future 
because the high inflation [words indistinct] and the view that 
the ultimate result will lead to some sort of cataclysm, the 
prognosis for which at the moment is relatively difficult. In 
practice, we have felt the clearly expressed view from 
everywhere that we have gone quite far. Four countries have 
distanced themselvesa from Russia more: the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Estonia, and Latvia. Estonia is being described as the 
locomotive of central and eastern Europe, with the most rapid 
development.

Defense and Interior Affairs Committee prepared a national 
security bill to determine the notion of national security and 
its implementation, said committee head Ivars Silars. 
  The law would outline the powers of the National Security 
Council and the government in managing security-related 
institutions. 
  The projected Satversme (Constitution) Protection Bureau, 
the 
Defense Ministry's military counterintelligence service, the 
Home Guards informative service and the Interior Ministry's 
security police are the basic institutions to ensure the 
national security, under the bill. 
  The laws on the Satversme Protection Bureau and the national 
security could become a foundation for the country's all-round 
security doctrine, the committee said. 
  The Defense Committee's bill is designed as an alternative 
to 
the Cabinet's counterintelligence plan. 
  Silars claims that the bill is ready for acceptance in the 
first reading in the Saeima plenary session. 
  The committee meeting was attended by Defense Minister 
Valdis 
Pavlovskis, Interior Minister Girts Kristovskis and related 
security officers.

<F P=106> [Besik Urigashvili article: "Following Defeat in Abkhazia </F>
Georgia Expects a Miracle from Boris Yeltsin"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- Eduard Shevardnadze has stated 
categorically that President Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi is the 
most important event in the entire history of Russian-Georgian 
relations going back over 200 years. According to Shevardnadze, 
the president of a great neighboring friendly state is coming to 
independent Georgia, and anyone who thinks differently is 
divorced from real politics and real life. "We will not allow 
anyone to wreck this visit," the Georgian leader stressed. 
  The worried tone of Shevardnadze's statement is 
understandable -- both the parliamentary and nonparliamentary 
opposition are taking a negative view of the visit and of Russia 
in general, primarily owing to Moscow's stance during the 
Abkhazian war. However, most of Georgia's inhabitants do see 
Russia as the sole guarantor of a stabilization of the extremely 
grave economic and political situation within Georgia itself. 
  There is an extremely simple explanation for this rapid 
metamorphosis in Georgian public thinking: The people have been 
enraged by poverty and rampant banditry. Hopelessness and lack 
of confidence in the future are making Joe Public look for a 
miracle. And Boris Yeltsin must appear as a miracle worker to a 
Georgian audience. 
  The reason for Yeltsin's visit to Georgia is to sign the 
long-awaited treaty on friendship and cooperation between the 
two countries. Georgia has already signed similar treaties with 
all its closest neighbors. The delay in signing the 
Russian-Georgian treaty is due primarily to the war in Abkhazia, 
during which, in Tbilisi's opinion, Russia has espoused an 
extremely equivocal position by generally backing the 
separatists. But Shevardnadze and his immediate entourage 
always tried to attribute this to the fact that a powerful war 
party was at work within the Russian political establishment. 
The reference being to the former Supreme Soviet and the former 
vice president [Rutskoy], who once promised to muster aircraft 
and bomb Tbilisi. Since they quit the political arena, people 
here have begun to think that the situation is propitious for 
Georgia. 
  A key question in the coming Russian-Georgian meeting will 
undoubtedly be the settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. And 
the Georgian side's main irreducible demand is for the refugees, 
of whom there are over 200,000, to be brought back. In 
accordance with the talks held in Geneva, the first group of 
refugees is to return to Abkhazia 10 February. In the main they 
are residents of the border Galskiy Rayon. 
  Abkhazian leaders have voiced their opinion of Yeltsin's 
upcoming visit to Tbilisi. Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, one of 
Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba's closest comrades in arms, 
said that this visit means that Russia is giving Georgia carte 
blanche for military revenge. Dzhindzholiya gave assurances 
that the Russians have given the Georgian Army a large quantity 
of military hardware, including modern ground-attack aircraft 
and fighters. In the opinion of the Abkhazians, the delay in 
deploying Russian Armed Forces under UN auspices in the conflict 
zone is also an alarming factor. "Abkhazia has never trusted 
the United Nations, and now Russia too is losing our trust," 
Dzhindzholiya stressed. 
  The question of Georgia's joining the ruble zone will 
undoubtedly be broached during the talks in Tbilisi. At any 
rate the official press and television have long been preparing 
the public for this step. Strictly speaking, this propaganda 
softening-up process is directed not so much at ordinary 
mortals, who amid the soaring inflation of the local coupon have 
long been prepared for their government to take these steps, but 
at the political opposition, which sees this as a loss of 
independence. "Understandably, if it joins the ruble zone 
Georgia will be unable to implement its own finance and credit 
policy and will be entirely dependent on the Russian Central 
Bank. Also understandably, Russia can have no economic grounds 
for allowing a country with such a ravaged economy as Georgia 
into its currency zone. So, the idea is purely political and 
pursues a single objective -- to restore the former empire in 
one way or another," Revaz Shavishvili, chairman of the Georgian 
monitoring agency [kontrolnaya palata], said. 
  The shadow of the broken Soviet Union is increasingly 
alarming Georgian oppositionists. That is precisely the light 
in which the opposition views the Georgian leader's moves toward 
rapprochement. 
  The Georgian leader responds to the opposition's attacks 
with 
his customary confidence, but not without a dash of populism. 
Shevardnadze feels fairly confident since former Georgian 
president Zviad Gamsakhurdia quit the scene once and for all. 
He is aware that he has the outward support of a population 
exhausted by economic and political adversities for the policy 
of close rapprochement with Russia. In response to the 
countless accusations that he is promoting the revival of the 
empire in a new form, Shevardnadze said that his policy of 
rapprochement with Russia is designed to ensure that the empire 
is never reborn. Only political aesthetes can assess the 
novelty of these statements in Georgia today and, since they are 
few and far between, Shevardnadze is simply taken on trust. 
  Meanwhile preparations are well and truly under way in the 
Georgian capital to receive the eminent visitor. The "Green" 
party has decided to clear the garbage that has accumulated over 
several alarming months from the city's central streets. The 
police are temporarily removing the concrete slabs along the 
highway from the airport, and real Georgian wines and cognacs 
are being taken to the state dacha where the Russian president 
will be staying.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 1 Feb -- According to IBERIA news agency, 
the first item on the agenda at today's session of the Georgian 
parliament was information by Deputy Boris Kakubava. 
  Boris Kakubava, who had been elected to the Georgian 
parliament by the population of the Abkhaz region, said that the 
Union of Liberation of Abkhazia, headed by him, did not wish to 
confront the current Georgian authorities. That was why the 
union was not planning protest rallies on the eve of the 
official visit to Georgia by the Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin; although, after Boris Yeltsin's departure these rallies 
would undoubtedly be held if Georgian authorities failed to meet 
the following demands worked out by the union: 
  a. By no means should Russian or any other country's armed 
formations be brought into the territory of the Abkhaz region. 
  b. Russian armed formations currently stationed in the 
Abkhaz region should leave the territory of the Georgian 
Republic. 
  c. The Russian-Georgian border on the river Psou should 
be restored. 
  d. Russia should admit her participation in the war 
against Georgia and repent for the crime. 
  e. Beginning of the negotiations with the Gudauta 
authorities should be considered as a serious mistake by the 
Georgian authorities, and a vote of no confidence should be 
passed in the entire Georgian delegation at the Geneva talks. 
  f. The status of Abkhazia within the composition of 
Georgia should be decided in the process of working out 
Georgia's new constitution.

  [Text] The Georgian Parliament resumed work yesterday under 
the chairmanship of Parliament Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze. 
  In connection with the first issue on the agenda, the 
meeting 
was addressed by the chairman of the Abkhazia Liberation 
Organization, Boris Kakubava, who informed participants about 
his union's attitude towards the issue of Abkhazia, and read out 
the text of a resolution adopted by the union. On behalf of a 
group of deputies from Abkhazia, Boris Kakubava demanded that a 
delegation of refugees from Abkhazia meet Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin during his visit to Georgia. 
  After a short debate, the examination of the issue was 
postponed. 
  After a break, members of parliament once again began a 
discussion of a draft law on arms submitted by Mr. Givi 
Lominadze [chairman of the provisional Committee for Emergencies 
in Western Georgia]. As it was at earlier meetings, the debate 
on this issue was very sharp and it continued for the rest of 
the day. In the end, no decision was adopted on the above 
mentioned draft law and the meeting ended. 
  [Tbilisi Radio Tbilisi Network in Georgian at 1400 GMT on 1 
February carried a live relay of the parliamentary proceedings, 
which was intercepted in progress. A draft law on the 
manufacturing and possession of arms was put to the vote and 
adopted. However, after the vote some members of parliament 
challenged its results, claiming that the results included the 
votes of several deputies not present at the meeting, cast for 
them by their fellow MPs.]

  [Text] Vladikavkaz February 2 TASS -- The South Ossetian 
parliament adopted today an appeal to the Russian president, 
asking him to "work out security guarantees of the Republic of 
South Ossetia, of its free and democratic development before 
signing the Russian-Georgian treaty." 
  Members of parliament adopted as well an appeal to the 
Federation Council and the State Duma of the Russian Federation, 
asking them to "refrain from the ratification of a full-scale 
treaty between Russia and Georgia until a complete settlement of 
Ossetian-Georgian relations and not to regard the republic of 
South Ossetia as part of the Republic of Georgia." 
  In its turn, the Information and Press Committee of South 
Ossetia circulated today a statement of the republican 
parliament, which pointed out that the signing of the 
Russian-Georgian treaty "while the problem of the status of 
South Ossetia has not yet been resolved, is direct violation of 
the previous four-party agreements. This infringement on the 
rights of the Ossetian people will inevitably lead to the 
escalation of violence in the Republic of South Ossetia and 
around it."

  [Nesirov] The commander of the Russian border guards wanted 
us to defend the borders jointly. That is, Azerbaijan's border 
with Iran. We said at that time, and even earlier, and during 
the talks with Lieutenant-General (Mikhalayov) in Baku that we 
ourselves will defend our own borders. It will not be correct 
if we allow the Russian border guards to defend Azerbaijan's 
border with Iran jointly with us. It will mean the loss of 
sovereignty. We have a sovereign state and border guards. We 
must defend our own borders with our own border guards. 
Undoubtedly we will achieve this. [end recording]

  [Text] Baku, February 1 (TURAN)--Special Russian Envoy, 
Vladimir Kazimirov, left for Moscow last night from Baku's Bina 
Airport. 
  Kazimirov, who recently travelled to Khankendi [Stepanakert] 
and Yerevan arrived in the late evening on January 30 to Baku 
with the Russian plan for regulating the Armenian-Azeri conflict. 
  An official from the Azeri Presidential Cabinet told TURAN 
that the plan proposed a withdrawal of Armenian forces from six 
occupied south-western regions of Azerbaijan and the stationing 
of buffer-forces all along the line of hostilities. The 
question about the fate of the two other occupied Azeri regions, 
Lachinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy, and the status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, will be discussed at a later date. The first 
stage of implementation of the plan would be a 2-3 week long 
cease-fire which was scheduled to be signed on February 1. 
  However, Geydar Aliyev rejected the proposal and told 
Kazimirov yesterday that "we will discuss the question of a 
cease-fire only after the complete withdrawal of Armenian forces 
from the occupied Azeri territories." He also said, "Azerbaijan 
will not be humiliated by such cease-fire terms." 
  One Azeri diplomat said, "The regulation of the conflict can 
be discussed seriously only if the plan provides for a complete 
withdrawal of Armenian troops from all the occupied regions and 
the return of Azeris to the Shushinskiy Region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. Under these conditions, Azerbaijan would 
guarantee the restoration of road travel between 
Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia", one Azeri diplomat said. 
  The fact that Kazimirov left with an unagreed upon plan, 
postpones the settlement of the question for an indefinite 
period of time. In this connection, reports of the Russian 
media about today's scheduled meeting between Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the Foreign Ministers of Armenia and 
Azerbaijan, and with the representatives of the Armenian 
community of Nagorno- Karabakh are appear to be premature. 
Moreover, Azeri Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov did not leave 
for Moscow. This morning he received the UK ambassador Thomas 
Young.

  [Text] Baku February 2 TASS -- Five people died in a 
midnight explosion which rocked the Baku railway terminal on 
Tuesday. Seven other people were injured and hospitalized in 
critical condition, after the explosion shattered tens of 
railway wagons. 
  The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. The 
train, in which one of the cars exploded when passengers were 
getting into it, arrived earlier from Kislovodsk, southern 
Russia. It was duly inspected in the local depot and put into 
service again because of the rolling stock shortage. 
  Competent sources close to the investigation of the accident 
do not rule out an act of subversion as the cause of the blast.

  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Russia is satisfied with a 
report saying the Yugoslav authorities have offered information 
on their Armed Forces as of January 1, 1994, to CSCE for the 
first time since disintegration of former Yugoslavia, head of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department 
Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing here today. 
  A document circulated by Yugoslav representatives in Vienna 
says the Yugoslav Army does not plan to deploy additional types 
of heavy armaments or combat systems on Yugoslav territory in 
1994, said the Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesman. 
  "Information on location of forces and their armaments 
against the background of the on-going combat operations in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina testifies to the Yugoslav interest in 
military security and stability in the region," said Karasin.

  [Text] Russia calls for a negotiated settlement to the 
conflict in Afghanistan on the basis of compromise by the 
Afghans themselves, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Moscow 
on Tuesday [1 February]. 
  Reports from Afghanistan, he said, speak of continuing 
clashes between different factions. Obviously, not only does 
the emerging situation run counter to the interests of the 
Afghan people but poses a real threat to regional security as 
well, the spokesman said. 
  The official says Moscow is taking necessary steps within 
the 
framework of the UN and during bilateral contacts with states 
concerned as part of efforts to step up international help 
towards a political settlement in Afghanistan. 
  One of the elements of Russia's Afghanistan policy is to try 
to get Central Asian states involved in multilateral efforts for 
normalization in that country, the spokesman said. In his 
words, appropriate consultations are now under way with 
Uzbekistan. 
  A series of reports trying to gauge Uzbekistan's actions in 
connection with the Afghan crisis do not reflect Moscow's 
official position, the spokesman said.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Confrontation" column: "As </F>
of February, Ukraine Will Begin To Remove 490 Warheads to Its 
Own Bases. The Russian Army Is Preparing To Evacuate Missile 
Troop Officers"] 
  [Text] The joint Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement of 14 
January on the terms for the abolition of the "Ukrainian" 
nuclear weapons, signed in Moscow by the three presidents, has 
apparently not proved more long-lasting than previous such 
accords. A week after the ink had dried on the Moscow 
declaration, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry began, without any 
coordination with Moscow, an operation of actually seizing the 
strategic nuclear weapons. 
  On 21 January Army General Lieutenant Vladimir Mikhtyuk, 
commander of the 43d Missile Army, and also the commanders of 
the 46th (Pervomayskaya) and 19th (Khmelnitskaya) missile 
divisions were summoned to Kiev to a session of the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry Collegium "on matters of military discipline 
and training." The army commander reported this to Moscow, to 
the Main Command of the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF), because 
under an order that has been in effect for 33 years, the SRF 
army or division commander may not leave his unit without 
permission from the SRF commander in chief. In Kiev, however, 
the generals were suddenly ordered to swear the Ukrainian oath 
of allegiance. Gen. Mikhtyuk and Nikolay Filatov, commander of 
the 46th Division, under what one of the participants in the 
conference described as tough pressure, swore the Ukrainian 
oath. Rustam Karimov, commander of the 19th division, refused. 
  After that, the 43d Missile Army was actually placed outside 
the SRF Main Command's operational control. General Karimov has 
been removed from the post of division commander and is to fly 
to Moscow within the next few days. Today or tomorrow a new, 
"Ukrainian" commander will arrive at the 19th Missile Division 
who will be appointed by the Ukrainian defense minister without 
any coordination with Moscow. The SRF Command stated that they 
do not even know the new commander's name. Prior to that, 
during the last two years, all cadre reshuffles in the missile 
troops in Ukraine were made only by a joint order after they 
were coordinated in Moscow and Kiev. 
  On 22 January the Ukrainian defense minister signed Order 
001 
(classified as top secret) whereby the troops of the 43d Army 
must be prepared as of 1 February to begin removing the nuclear 
ammunition from the depots of the 19th and 46th divisions (all 
in all, 490 units) to "S" installations, from where Russian 
specialists were withdrawn last year and where the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry has deployed its own nuclear units, manned 
partly by officers of the 12th Main Directorate of the Russian 
Defense Ministry who stayed in Ukraine and partly by reserve 
officers. Colonel General Igor Smirnov, SRF commander in chief, 
sent a coded telegram to the Ukrainian defense minister 
expressing in a polite form his professional concern over the 
situation, but has not received any answer yet. 
  The SRF Main Command is currently making preparations for an 
urgent evacuation to Russia of all missile officers who refuse 
to swear the Ukrainian oath. According to SRF Main Command 
estimates, between 40 and 50 percent of the officers will leave. 
The divisions will become combat-incapable, the combat duty 
system will be disrupted, and political confrontation in missile 
unit crews between "pro-Ukrainian" and "pro-Russian" officers is 
possible. 
  Up until now Russia has been rendering the 43d Army 
technical 
assistance in maintaining its entire extremely complex strategic 
missile systems while officers have been undergoing regular 
retraining within the SRF framework. Now supplies and technical 
assistance for the army have been stopped. The Russian military 
is no longer in control of the situation. It believes that it 
has done everything possible within its jurisdiction and that 
now the problem of the Ukrainian nuclear weapons will again have 
to be decided by politicians in Moscow, Kiev, and Washington.

  [Text] Kiev -- At the evening plenary session of the 
Supreme Council today [Speaker] Ivan Plyushch reported on the 
defense council meeting which took place on 31 January. The 
meeting came to the conclusion, Ivan Plyushch said, that the 
president and government should find sources for financing "a 
sensible number" of the armed forces of Ukraine. In connection 
with this a number of measures have been elaborated which will 
allow the number of personnel to be reduced by almost 100,000 
persons and it is planned to conduct a substantial inventory of 
military property. After this the president and government will 
present proposals to parliament regarding the financing of 
defense expenditure. This point was included in the Supreme 
Council resolution on implementation of the law on the state 
budget for 1994. 
  Despite many protests by people's deputies against the tax 
which, in accordance with Article 23 of the state budget, will 
be imposed on corporate and physical entities for each page of 
written appeals to bodies of executive and legislative 
authority, the article was not withdrawn from the adopted 
document. In accordance with a proposal by Andriy Pecherov, 
chairman of the commission for issues of planning, budget, 
finances, and prices, Article 23 will be put into practice by a 
separate legislative act. 
  The calls by some deputies not to grant subventions to the 
Republic of Crimea until the legislation of that autonomous 
region is brought into line with the laws of Ukraine were not 
supported. Following the adoption of the Supreme Council 
resolution on implementation of the law on the state budget for 
1994, which envisions it being reconfirmed every quarter, the 
question of submitting to a Ukraine-wide referendum the 
fundamental constitutional provisions on the organization of 
state authority and [local] self-government in Ukraine was 
presented for discussion. 
  The latest version of the document was subjected to harsh 
criticism. After an hour's discussion not a single decision was 
made. The Supreme Council will continue its work 2 February.

amnesty submitted by the president to the State Duma seems 
extremely disputable. This is the view expressed by Yegor 
Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice parliamentary faction, in 
a conversation with correspondents today. Next Friday the State 
Duma will resume its sittings and the amnesty issue looks likely 
to be one of the items on the agenda. 
  "We are very doubtful about the provisions of the draft 
which 
reduce punishments for serious criminal offenses," Gaydar said.

  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Russia's new parliament 
will not repeat the mistakes of the previous legislature and 
avoid extremist declarations on the situation in the Crimea, 
Vice Chairman of the Russian Parliamentary Committee on 
Commonwealth Affairs Vyacheslav Igrunov told ITAR-TASS Tuesday 
[1 February], commenting on the results of the presidential 
elections in the peninsula. 
  He evidently referred to the extremist statement of former 
legislature to declare the major Black Sea Fleet base in the 
Crimea, the port of Sevastopol, as Russian territory. 
  However, Russia should increase its political activity in 
the 
peninsula and be a guarantor of the stability in this autonomous 
republic of Ukraine, Igrunov stressed. 
  He welcomed the idea of establishing a Russian consulate or 
a 
permanent mission of the Russian parliament in Simferopol, the 
Crimean administrative centre. The parliamentarian also spoke 
in favour of the exchange of lawmakers' delegations between 
Russia and the Crimea. 
  Kiev should only praise such cooperation, as Moscow is not 
interested in the Crimean separatism, he stressed. Igrunov 
believes Ukraine should prefer the civilized cooperation with 
Russia to "an endless tug-of-war". 
  The parliamentarian said that he had just returned from the 
Crimea and Kiev after the on-spot examination of the situation. 
According to him, the first popularly elected president of the 
autonomy, Yuriy Meshkov should avoid hasty steps and rely on the 
renowned local politicians and parliament leaders.

<F P=106> [Boris Vinogradov report: "Andrey Kozyrev: Russia Is Not </F>
Creating a New Military Alliance in the Caucasus"] 
  [Text] The Russian President's trip to Georgia will be B. 
Yeltsin's first official visit to a Commonwealth state, leaving 
aside his fleeting visit to Ashgabat and his talks with 
Saparmurad Niyazov. 
  The political nuances of the visit were examined at Andrey 
Kozyrev's conference with North Caucasus leaders. As the 
minister remarked, this is a major step aimed at implementing a 
strategic line in the Caucasus, which Russia has traditionally 
regarded as a zone of its geopolitical interests. Russia would 
not like to have on its border a state torn apart by internal 
conflicts and drowning in economic chaos and crime. 
  The preconditions for establishing cooperation have been 
created. Georgia has become a member of the CIS and the 
Collective Security Council. But it remains the only neighbor 
with which Moscow does not have a framework treaty on the bases 
of relations or agreements on border questions. The Russian 
delegation is taking a set of these documents with it to 
Tbilisi, where it intends to sign them. There is nothing in 
them that conflicts with the interests of the North Caucasus 
republics. They have no grounds for suspecting that any kind of 
"military-political alliance" is being prepared between Russia 
and Georgia against Abkhazia, the minister stressed. 
  One of the main tasks of the visit is to promote the 
settlement of conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 
  Andrey Kozyrev pointed out that in principle Russia has 
decided to conduct peace-keeping operations in Abkhazia and 
intends to seek the participation of UN and CSCE international 
observers in it. The minister recognized at this point that 
Russia bears the main burden of the peacemaking work and the 
protection of people's lives, Georgia's sovereignty, and the 
rights of the ethnic minorities.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 01, BNS--The Estonian and the Russian 
negotiators met today for another round of talks near Moscow. 
  On the agenda are the withdrawal of the Russian troops from 
Estonia, the social protection of Russian military pensioners 
living in Estonia, and other questions of bilateral relations. 
  Vasily Svirin, Russia's top negotiator, said earlier Russia 
will now present the detailed timetable for the troop withdrawal 
from January through August. 
  Svirin said the timetable contains the dates for the pullout 
of all units as well as the number of men serving in them. "We 
hope this gesture of good will inspire also Estonia to 
constructive action," the Russian diplomat said. 
  As reported earlier, Estonia accepted Russia's proposal to 
withdraw its troops from Estonia by Aug. 31, but insisted that 
Russia present a detailed schedule for the pullout.

  [Text] The rearmament of the Lithuanian Army in accordance 
with NATO standards can be hardly achieved in the near future. 
Having signed the basic program of the Partnership for Peace 
last week, Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas said the 
Lithuanian Army would have to be rearmed, so that it could meet 
NATO standards. 
  Lithuanian Military Chief of Staff Stasys Knezys told the 
Baltic News Service that the prospects of standardization in the 
army were unclear and that no concrete steps had been taken in 
this respect. According to Mr. Knezys, Lithuania should first of 
all decide what quality and quantity of armaments and defense 
systems it needs. 
  Meanwhile NATO officials believe that rearmament should be 
started with replacing communication systems and not weapons. 
At present Lithuania is using 10 various (?such) systems, and 
their adaptation to NATO standards would require huge funds, 
which the national defense system doesn't possess.

  [Text] Baku February 1 TASS -- Azerbaijan puts the fullest 
responsibility for the growing tensions in the zone of 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on Armenia, says a statement of 
the presidential press service circulated here on Tuesday 
evening. 
  Armenia "will not give up attempts to expand the so-called 
"security zone" in Nagorno-Karabakh by occupying new Azerbaijani 
regions", the press service said. 
  "Within the framework of this annexationist policy, the 
military and political leadership of Armenia undertook an 
unsuccessful attempt at intervention into the Beilangan and 
Tertery districts of Azerbaijan last December," the press 
service said. 
  According to the statement, this action made Azerbaijan 
resort to defensive counter measures and resulted in numerous 
casualties and a new spiral in the armed confrontation between 
the two states. 
  On the other hand, the press service once again stated that 
Azerbaijan came out against the war and would insist on a 
peaceful settlement to the conflict based on "withdrawal of the 
Armenian forces from all occupied territories and respect for 
sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-violation of 
Azerbaijan's borders". 
  In this connection, the Azerbaijani president calls on the 
Armenian leadership to give up the fruitless policy of armed 
conflict which brings ever increasing sacrifices and 
tribulations to the Armenian people, the press service said. 
  The president also calls on Armenians living in 
Nagorno-Karabakh who are citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan 
to reject participating in military operations on the part of 
the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia and surrender arms, 
according to the statement. 
  He guarantees that as Azerbaijani citizens they will 
exercise 
their constitutional rights to a safe and peaceful future within 
the bounds of a single and indivisible Azerbaijan.

Publishing Cooperative, 75,000 copies, 143 pages. COPYRIGHT: 
Zhirinovskiy V.V.] 
  [Text] Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, the widely known 
politician, was born 25 April 1946 in the city of Alma-Ata 
[Almaty] in a family belonging to the intelligentsia. He 
graduated from the Institute of Asian and African Countries at 
the Moscow State University named for M.V. Lomonosov and the 
Moscow State University law faculty. He is a specialist on 
problems of Central Asia, the Transcaucasus, and the Near East. 
He is fluent in English, French, German, and Turkish. He 
served as a staff officer in the Transcaucasus Military District 
and headed the "Mir" Publishing House legal service. In 1990 he 
set up and became head of the Liberal Democratic Party; he is a 
politician of the modern mold and advocates a natural historical 
path of development and the preservation of Russia's territorial 
integrity. He is dynamic, has great political astuteness, and 
he is a magnificent polemicist and speaker. In his public 
activity he looks toward satisfying the people's vital 
interests. In 1991 he ran for president of the RSFSR and won 
almost one-tenth of Russian voters' votes. He is married with a 
son. 
  1. My disadvantaged personal life helped make me a 
good student. I tried to find some sort of satisfaction from 
this.... 
  2. I am in favor of the broadest development -- the 
most important thing is that there be no enmity, no dominance by 
any one nation, no discrimination. 
  3. The last dash to the south, Russia's outlet to the 
shores of the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Ocean is really the 
task of saving the Russian nation. 
  4. You cannot govern by waving chocolate bars in the 
face of your subjects, or only by brandishing a whip.... 
  5. It is undesirable to tie everybody to one party, to 
one idea, to one blueprint. That is deadening. While a 
multitude of ideas makes the country more luxuriant, like a 
bouquet of flowers. 
  6. So let's have less heroism.... If we all sacrifice 
ourselves, who then is going to live in our country? 
  7. This will be a new Russia, without "devils," 
without fanaticism, a Russia where Orthodoxy and the Christian 
religion hold a dominant position. 
  8. Russians, proud people, the 21st century will 
belong to us despite everything! 
  This is an analytical narrative mixed with a 
biographical outline, the encapsulation of my philosophical and 
geopolitical views on present-day reality. It is the juice of 
my brain, the point I have reached during my 46 years. 
  So I will begin right at the beginning. I am Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. I have a Russian name -- Vladimir -- but my 
father's name was Volf; that is what his birth certificate and 
passport said. Mom used to call him simply Volodya, and it 
would have been simpler for me to have been called Vladimir 
Vladimirovich, but whether because of bureaucracy or red tape, I 
don't know, but one way or another I am Vladimir Volfovich. I'm 
proud of either name because it was my father's, although it 
sounds rather odd to Russian ears. 
  I was born 25 April 1946 in Alma-Ata. It was 11 on a 
Thursday evening. Rain was falling. It was the first spring 
after the war. We lived in a two-story house on Dunganskaya 
Street in a city that had once been called Vernyy and was 
founded by Russian Cossacks in 1854. Russian people founded 
this city. So I am always entitled to consider that I was born 
in Russia among Russians. It was later that first the Kazakh 
ASSR [Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic] and then the Kazakh 
SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] would be created by edict of 
Stalin, and then in "CIS" times even the independent state of 
Kazakhstan. As though Russians are merely fertilizer for the 
ground on which states belonging to someone else are to emerge 
and Russians themselves do not need their own state. For some 
reason Russians are not supposed to have their own state where 
they were born, where they live, where their forebears died, and 
where they founded cities -- by rights, not as conquerors, for 
there was no state there when the Russian Cossacks arrived. 
There was their stanitsa [Cossack village] on the bank of the 
Alma-Atinka River. A small stanitsa inhabited by Cossacks. 
There was no aul [Kazakh village] nearby. Unfortunately the 
Russian words kazak [Cossack] and kazakh [Kazakh] -- the name of 
the local indigenous population -- sound very similar. 
  I was born in a two-story house where only Russians lived, 
and the whole city was largely Russian -- to this day 80 percent 
of the population are Russians. So I have always considered 
myself Russian, being born of a Russian woman, Aleksandra 
Pavlovna Zhirinovskaya, nee Makarova, whose mother, my 
grandmother, was Fiona Nikiforovna Makarova, nee Sergucheva. 
She had a brother called Mikhail Nikiforovich. And also 
another brother. One worked in Moscow at the State Mint. My 
grandmother herself worked in Moscow, in the Botanical Garden, 
during the thirties. Fate scattered my relatives throughout the 
country. They have lived all over the place! Moscow, 
Leningrad, Penza, Syzran, Sasovo, Kemerovo, Bratsk, Arkhangelsk, 
Ulyanovsk, Pyatigorsk, Gomel, the Far East, Armavir in Krasnodar 
Kray, Sakhalin, Frunze, Dushanbe -- all over the country. And 
also in Ukraine, the Caucasus, and Maykop, because my mother had 
two brothers and two sisters, there were five children in the 
family. And they all had children, and they all got married. 
If you assembled the whole family there would probably be about 
100 people. Naturally, there were people of various 
nationalities. There was a cleaner and a candidate of sciences 
in our family. An ordinary soldier and a colonel. People who 
had graduated from higher educational institutions and people 
who had failed to graduate. It was a typical average Russian 
family. A multinational family. The husbands of several 
cousins were non-Russians. My aunt's husband was a Mordvinian, 
Viktor Izmaylov. My cousin Rena's husband was an Ossetian or an 
Adygean. So we were a bit of a mix. But all the same, we were 
mostly Russians. My grandfather Pavel Ivanovich Makarov died of 
typhus in 1919; he was a soldier in the old czarist Russian 
army. I, his grandson, cannot say today which side he was on -- 
the Reds' or the Whites'. Judging by his last photograph he was 
a soldier in the czarist army. But he may have made his choice 
before October 1917. I do not know whose side he was on after 
October 1917. Today we cannot accuse each other of anything. 
How can we assess the events of the start of the century when 
today, though we are eyewitnesses and participants in modern 
history, we cannot always make a correct assessment of 
particular events?... 
  I was born right there in the apartment, in the very room 
where I spent the next 18 years until the day, 3 July 1964, I 
left my native city of Alma-Ata forever and moved to Moscow. 
The ambulance did not manage to reach Mom in time, so they went 
to fetch a neighbor, a pensioner and midwife. It was raining 
and she lived some way away, so she too did not arrive in time. 
Our neighbors were relations. My uncle, my aunt's husband, 
helped my mother and cut the cord with a kitchen knife. He did 
a good job, no worse than they do in maternity homes. 
Eventually the ambulance arrived, and Mom and I were taken off 
to a maternity home. Maybe this moment of birth also had some 
kind of effect on my future fate? Maybe I myself provoked it 
somehow? I could not wait. I was the sixth child in the 
healthy body of my mother, where the entire childbearing 
machinery had been tried out by my siblings, three sisters and 
two brothers. 
  Despite Mom's half-starved life, I was clearly a strong boy 
and entered this world unaided. I was average weight, average 
size, and later I was to develop curly fair hair and blue eyes. 
My mother looked after me for three years and then, because of 
material circumstances, she was forced to get a job. My father, 
Volf Andreyevich Zhirinovskiy, was an ordinary legal adviser, 
worked at the Turkestan-Siberian Railroad Administration, and 
died early as a result of a car crash. Mom was left without a 
livelihood. We had a cow, but it had to be sold because there 
was no feed. Eventually Mom went to work in a cafeteria. That 
meant a better-fed and more secure existence. She would eat 
there and bring me something. From that time I was practically 
on state support. All my food came via the cafeteria. It was 
revolting food, of course, and it naturally wrecked my digestion 
and promoted the development of gastritis, cholecystitis, and so 
forth. But what could I, a small boy, do? I was always hungry. 
After school I would go to see Mom at work and wait until she 
managed to bring me something to eat. She did this on the sly, 
because it was against the rules. They were given meals at 
work, but this was extra. She would grovelingly beg the cook 
for a plate of soup and some rusty croquettes, and I would eat 
the lot and go home. Sometimes this would not happen. Mom would 
not be at work, or there would be some kind of problem. I would 
go hungry. So all my childhood memories are associated with the 
fact that I never had enough to eat. And the food was always 
monotonous and of poor quality. It was the same story with 
clothing. I never had decent good-quality clothes. I almost 
never had anything new, it was always somebody's old 
hand-me-downs. My clothes would be bought at the flea market -- 
from people who had grown out of them, or from dead people. At 
any rate, the clothes were old and secondhand and belonged to 
someone else. 
  One time, I remember, Mom had made me a bright check shirt 
out of scraps of material -- an overshirt, as the fashion was 
then, with little slits. I went with some boys to the park to 
bathe in the local pond, and when I got back to my clothes I 
could not find the shirt, someone had stolen it. Later somebody 
stole my satchel. I encountered social phenomena right from 
earliest childhood, from birth. The late arrival of the 
ambulance, then a hungry childhood and cold. The winters were 
relatively harsh, down to minus 20 degrees, but I had poor 
footwear, I never had warm boots or felt boots or decent 
clothes. I remember I used to go around in a sleeveless padded 
jacket. In some threadbare old overcoat given me by my cousin. 
  It was a joyless childhood. All 18 years. Maybe at 17 there 
were a few glimmers of light -- my first expectations, my first 
kisses.... But there is nothing to recall about home: I had no 
corner of my own. Even my bed was not my own. I slept on a 
trunk, and then on a sofa that everyone used to sit on, so that 
was not mine. At night, when nobody was sitting on it, I slept. 
I could not go quietly off to sleep because it was a room in a 
communal apartment. And there were sometimes up to five people 
in that room. Even if there were just three, the light would be 
on, the radio would be playing, and people would be wandering 
about. When I was small, very small, I wanted to go to bed 
earlier, at nine or ten, and I would always go to sleep while 
the light was on and there was noise all around. So even from 
childhood I felt somehow uncomfortable and unpleasant. I was 
deprived of the most basic family comfort and human warmth. 
  Mom never had any time, she was working. I was asleep when 
she left for work and had gone to bed when she got home. 
Sometimes I would not see her for days on end. Even on Sunday, 
the only day off -- Saturday became a day off only after I had 
left home -- on Sunday she would also be busy with something, 
she was always busy. There was the laundry to do, and on top of 
that it was a communal apartment. We were not allowed into the 
kitchen. Mom would cook meals on our kerosene stove, which 
stood in the corridor on top of a trunk. It used to take a long 
time, because there was just one stove and you had to cook the 
potatoes and also boil water for tea. The food was as basic as 
could be. Cabbage soup, sometimes borshch, and meat only on 
rare occasions. Kasha, or fried potatoes, and sometimes a bit 
of herring. There was never much meat or sausage. We would 
have sweets only on red-letter days, and even then only ordinary 
waffles or the cheapest chocolates at 1 ruble [R] 50 kopeks, 
"Domino" brand or sometimes some other kind. It was really hard 
living in a communal apartment. But at one time the entire 
apartment had belonged to us. My mother's first husband got it 
in 1940. He was a colonel. He, his wife, and five children 
were given the three-room apartment for the seven of them. But 
then the war began and they began to move other people in as 
well. First they took one room, then another. By the end of 
the war Mom was left with just one room. Mom's husband died of 
tuberculosis in 1944, and Mom married my father in 1945, then he 
died in 1946. So we stayed in that communal apartment with the 
right to just one room. Mom's sister lived next door. My 
father had asked her to move in with us: Better have relatives 
living there than families of outsiders and refugees. So Mom's 
sister and her family lived in the next room, and Mariya 
Nikolayevna, a refugee, lived in the third with her son. Mom's 
sister grabbed the entire kitchen in our three-room apartment, 
and Mom and our neighbor had to cook in the corridor. 
  I had absolutely nowhere to play -- either in the room or in 
the corridor. You always had to wait in line to use the toilet 
and it always stank, because a toilet always smells bad if there 
is no air freshener, especially when people use it one after 
another. If all 10 or 11 people use the toilet in the morning, 
then air fresheners are no use. Some people would smoke in 
there, which was also unpleasant. Mariya Nikolayevna used to 
smoke in the corridor while she was letting the smoke out of her 
room. From childhood I was surrounded by these poisonous puffs 
of tobacco smoke. The cigarettes were always the cheapest to be 
had, filterless "Prima" and suchlike. I was in everybody's way, 
I was the smallest. Then there was the "hazing" you get in a 
communal apartment -- people pick on the smallest person. They 
kick him and say rude things. Who will defend him? No brother, 
no father. And on top of everything else, there was my 
stepfather. In 1950 Mom decided she could not live on her own, 
she was only 38, she needed a man. She brought into the house a 
23-year-old student from the communications technical college. 
He was a stupid lad. But he was comfortable. He had a bed and 
food, he had his washing and mending done. What could he give 
us when he was a student at a technical college? His grant was 
not even enough for him, so not only was he no help to us, he 
was just an extra mouth in our poor family. And my mother was 
forced to feed him, herself, and me as well at the cafeteria. 
This was not always possible. When she had to choose between 
us, she chose him because he was her lover. They did not make 
it official, they did not go to the register office, although 
they could have done so; for some reason there was no particular 
need. My stepfather lived with us for 12 years. He caused us a 
lot of grief. Sometimes he would come home drunk, and he always 
used to smoke in the room. Now our room too was full of tobacco 
smoke. The room, the corridor, the toilet.... The small boy 
breathed this filth and fretted. I was badly fed and had almost 
no education. There was no opportunity for any contact with 
culture. Not only was there no children's corner, not only were 
there no toys. There was not a single children's book, we 
subscribed to no newspapers, there was no phone, there was 
nothing. I might as well have been living in a cave. I had a 
hankering for culture. I would open books for grown-ups. My 
mother loved reading Dreiser's "An American Tragedy" and "Queen 
Margot." I couldn't make much of them, I wanted to be reading 
children's books but I didn't have any. I wanted to be playing 
children's games, but there weren't any. Life itself seemed to 
force me to suffer from the day, from the moment, from the 
instant I was born. Society could offer me nothing. 
  Mom fixed me up at a 24-hour nursery. And from the age of 
two or three I was practically never home. I spent six days a 
week in a room with 26 beds and 12 little kids. I remember that 
nursery to this day, it was on Artilleriyskaya Street, the 
corner of Uzbekskaya Street, near the bathhouse. One time I had 
a great fright. We were asleep in our room when some drunk came 
up to our glass door -- we were on the ground floor -- tried to 
peer in, and knocked on the door. I was very frightened: My 
bed was right by the door. I also remember how we were fed 
cod-liver oil. We were supposed to go to the nurse and stand in 
line, and she would pour cod-liver oil into our mouths using the 
same tablespoon and the same bottle. For some reason many 
children did not like it -- it was even regarded as a kind of 
punishment to have to take it. But at the time it was thought 
to be good for children, so we were given cod-liver oil. I 
remember how we were wakened at 11 in the evening. We were put 
to bed at 9, then wakened at 11 so we could urinate into a 
bucket. Some of us could not get through the night and would 
wet the bed. And the nursery staff, in order to avoid having to 
change the linen and dry the sheets, would use the following 
method: They would wake the whole group, put two buckets in the 
middle of the room, and switch on the light. Boys would urinate 
in one bucket, girls in the other. It may have been then, at 
the age of three or four, that I felt the first stirrings of 
something sexual and I saw totally naked girls. We all slept 
naked, and when we went to urinate when the light was on it was 
naturally easy to see the contours of the body. At the time I 
understood nothing, but I was already aware that we were boys 
and they were girls, their bodies were a different shape and 
they had different organs. Of course, this was not physical 
attraction in the pure form, but I already grasped that they 
were girls. 
  Then I was moved to a kindergarten a bit further from home, 
but actually on Artilleriyskaya Street. This was not a 24-hour 
nursery but an ordinary kindergarten, and I was there from the 
ages of three to six. I was literally one month short of seven 
years old. In March 1953 my mother was asked to remove me 
because I was an uncontrollable child, got up to mischief, and 
disobeyed the teachers. I remember that one time at this 
kindergarten I pretended to be sick. I badly wanted not to be 
there, and I had heard that if you coughed a bit, they would say 
it was whooping cough and send you home. So one time I began to 
cough and cough and to pretend I had whooping cough. I don't 
remember whether the ruse worked and I was allowed to go home, 
but that is the kind of quick-wittedness I had even then. 
  I also remember how we were summoned to help unload the food 
that had been brought to the storeroom of the cafeteria at our 
kindergarten. Obviously, it was the older boys of five, six, 
and seven who did this. We played a trick on this occasion too. 
I remember we were unloading watermelons, and one melon 
happened to burst. One of the adults, the supply chief or cook, 
said we would have to eat the melon because it could not be 
kept, it would leak, so then we cunningly ensured that several 
more small melons burst. And we were allowed to eat those too. 
That was the kind of cunning and guile that arose in children's 
little heads even at that very early age. 
  I remember our games. We were all forced together to haul 
some large car. We trudged after each other hauling the car on 
a rope.... For some reason I did not like collective games. I 
liked to go off somewhere and play on my own. I remember the 
smell of these kindergartens, a specific smell -- children's 
underwear, children's food, children's bodies. And all the 
adults towering over us. I remember being punished. I was 
running along the corridor, and another boy was running along 
the corridor around the corner toward me. We collided at the 
corner since we had not seen each other, and for some reason he 
began to bleed. He was asked (I remember he was called Misha 
Iskhakov, he was a Kazakh, but a Russianized Kazakh): "What 
happened, Misha?" He pointed to me. And they immediately jumped 
to the conclusion that I had beaten the boy. No one had seen 
that we had simply had a clash of heads. This injustice in very 
early childhood hurt me badly. I was almost declared a 
hooligan. Throughout my later life I was often to encounter 
injustice. I would be detained, accused, and blamed for 
something although it was not my fault. But even after 40 years 
I remember this childhood incident as though it were today, so 
deep an impression did it make on me. 
  I remember 6 March 1953. I was running along the 
kindergarten corridor and I saw the nursery staff standing by 
the public-address system -- big black speakers, the very first 
ones. They were standing there and crying. Apparently there 
had been some kind of news that someone by the name of Stalin 
had died somewhere in Moscow. And I, a child with absolutely no 
grasp of politics, of course, nevertheless even then could not 
fathom why grown-ups, nursery assistants, the nurse, and 
teachers, were standing in a kindergarten corridor such a long 
way from Moscow and weeping. I ran on my way. Maybe this was 
the first glimmer of political consciousness, my first protest 
against the personality cult. For I believed even then that 
people should not weep if some alien person dies somewhere. At 
the time I did not know that he was regarded as the leader of 
the peoples and was the head of our state. But this very fact 
irritated and perplexed me even then: Why should everyone cry 
because someone dies somewhere? 
  In general that was my kindergarten, and I often did not 
want to go there. I would even forcibly dig my heels in, and my 
older sister Vera would almost beat me because Mom had given her 
the chore of taking me to kindergarten. Sometimes they asked 
the boy next door to take me there by deception. The main thing 
was to get rid of me, to ensure that I went through the gates 
and was out of sight for five or six hours. Sometimes I would 
run away from the kindergarten, and eventually I was taken away 
from there. I felt hurt, because I had seen the kind of sendoff 
that the older children got from the kindergarten. They were 
all already seven years old and a month or two before school, in 
the summer, some time in June, before the vacation, when parents 
would take children to dachas or simply on leave with them, the 
group of older children who would no longer return to the 
kindergarten but would go to school in September were usually 
lined up and presented with gifts -- school satchels, school 
things of one kind or another, pens, pencil cases, rulers. They 
were happy to be saying farewell to kindergarten, happy that 
they were being feted. But I was deprived of this red-letter 
day. Several times later in my life I was to be deprived of 
these children's red-letter days. I was left to myself. The 
few months before school flitted by quite imperceptibly, 
half-starving. I did a little to support myself by "foraging 
for food." Near home there were a lot of private houses with 
orchards, and I was one of the naughty boys who used to climb 
with friends into these gardens and take apples, pears, plums, 
and cherries. The extra food saved me somehow. On top of that 
there was the abundant summer sunshine and I wore almost nothing 
-- just shorts and sometimes a little T-shirt -- and almost 
always went around barefoot. This hardened my constitution. I 
grew up relatively healthy. Although I was always aware of not 
having enough to eat, I was always thin. There was nothing 
special about my clothing, either. 
  Then I turned seven. I have no recollection of my birthdays 
ever being celebrated in early childhood. The first time was 
when I was 12, and my aunt gave me R25 -- the old, prereform 
money -- and I was able to buy a fountain pen. I bought myself 
the first gift I had ever had. Later my sister gave me a chess 
set for one birthday. But I was given practically nothing. My 
birthday was first celebrated when I was 16, then 17 and 18. 
That was the end of my childhood, and I bade farewell to my 
mother's place. 
  First grade. I remember walking home from school. I was 
walking on my own, without Mom -- she was at work -- carrying my 
satchel. For the first time I had a sense of my new status. At 
the first lesson my first teacher, Mariya Petrovna Semisalova, 
told us: "Kids, you are now not merely boys, you are pupils, 
you are schoolboys." And I was conscious of this. From second 
grade we were to have coeducational classes, but in 1953 it was 
still just a boys' school. There I was, walking home after the 
first lesson, some time around noon, but no one was waiting for 
me at home. I put down my new satchel and took off my uniform. 
It was my first uniform, a little white high-collared jacket 
with buttons such as sailors or railroad workers wear and 
trousers. Mom had gotten hold of a bit of material from 
somewhere and had made me this outfit on a neighbor's sewing 
machine. It was expensive to buy it readymade, but you could 
get hold of the material cheaply or maybe even for free. I had 
no joy from this first day at school. Nobody saw me off to 
school, nobody met me. From birth I went everywhere alone, on 
my own, taking the direct route regardless of obstacles. And I 
always had a feeling of a kind of annoyance, bitterness, and 
dissatisfaction because I never experienced joy, any joy. No 
one feted me, no one hugged me, no one fondled me, no one said: 
"Well, Vova, you're off to school" or "Well, Vova, so now 
you're seven." My mother never had any time because she had to 
keep me. She left for work at 8 in the morning, returned 
exhausted at 6 or 7, cooked the meal, did the laundry, did the 
mending, did the cleaning. I remember my mother perpetually at 
the washtub, or doing the ironing, or going shopping. She was 
doing something her whole life, she never had any rest. She was 
not on the books at any rest home or sanatorium. And when she 
was on leave she never knew what to do with herself, my poor 
Mom, she would just wait for the start of work. She spent her 
whole life, all her 73 years in torment. Two months before her 
death she was to say to me: "Volodya, I have nothing to 
remember, not a single happy day." And when she died in May 
1985 I looked back over her life and I felt so bad that she had 
indeed experienced no joy. Nothing but humiliation and 
suffering all her life. 
  This was clearly the lot of our entire people. My mother 
and my father were born under the Russian Empire, my father in 
1907 and my mother in 1912. They were in torment throughout 
their lifetime. First the czar and the Russian empire, then 
revolution and civil war, then the Great Patriotic War, and 
those perpetual removals, perpetual formalities, passports, 
registrations, yes-you-cans and no you can'ts. They moved 
across the whole country, from Europe to Asia and went to an 
early grave. Their whole life was one big removal. So many 
cities, so many changes of apartment.... We put the whole 
nation on the move. The whole Russian people in a cart jingling 
along the ruts on country roads. For the entire 20th century. 
We got into space, we smashed the Germans. But we destroyed 
every family, every foundation, we lost all archives and ties of 
kinship. How many people were the subject of mix-ups and were 
mislaid. But how good things were at the beginning of the 
century. The Russian Empire. Both my father and my mother were 
equally subjects of the Russian Empire. Later borders would be 
drawn and it would no longer be Penza Guberniya but the 
Mordovian Republic, no longer the city of Vernyy but the Kazakh 
autonomous formation, then Union republic, and eventually 
independent Kazakhstan. Why, why this disaster for the 
family?... 
  So my memory of first grade is of me walking on my own in a 
little white outfit with a satchel up Dzherzhinskiy Street 
toward Dunganskaya Street, where I lived. Later it was renamed 
Masanchi Street. The Eurasian city of Alma-Ata. There was 
almost nothing Asian about the place, but geography made it 
necessary to regard it as Asian. Some 4,000 km southeast of 
Moscow. China and India were closer to us than Moscow. I 
studied for 11 years at the same school. A secondary school 
providing production training. We were trained as category II 
motor mechanics. From eighth grade we went to Alma-Ata's No 2 
Motor Repair Plant twice a week for hands-on training. We spent 
virtually the whole workday there, from 0800 to 1600 hours. 
  For the first four grades in elementary school we were taken 
by Mariya Petrovna Semisalova. Obviously kindergarten had left 
me a disobedient child, I was forever clashing with the teachers 
and getting low marks for behavior. Then I moved into fifth 
grade, where we had different teachers for different subjects. 
At some point in fifth or sixth grade I began to lag behind in 
arithmetic and algebra. Later I had difficulty with all these 
precise sciences. Especially as we began to do geometry and 
trigonometry. There were some failures, I could not remember the 
formulas and I found it hard to resolve the examples and 
problems, to draw geometry assignments, and to resolve 
trigonometrical formulas. Physics and chemistry didn't go very 
well, either. 
  In seventh grade I began to make something of an impression, 
and I was elected chairman of the detachment council. Our class 
teacher was Vera Yevgenyevna Chebotova, a mathematics teacher. 
By eighth grade we had a different class teacher. They often 
changed, our class had no luck. In ninth grade our class 
teacher was Yelena Mikhaylovna Blinder. I later learned that 
her real name was Esterna Moiseyevna. She had obviously 
Russianized her forename and patronymic under the influence of 
anti-Semitism. She was a strong, determined woman; she took our 
class for three years and did many useful things. At first she 
picked me out and helped my election as Komsomol [Leninist 
Communist Youth League] organizer for class 9. But after a few 
months she became disappointed with me, realizing that I was 
unbiddable and was not a "tame" Komsomol organizer. Then she 
used her authority in the opposite direction, and told another 
Komsomol meeting to hold fresh elections for my post. This was 
yet another blow, because I realized perfectly well that there 
were no grounds for fresh elections, that this was merely her 
wish because I did not suit her. But there were some toadies 
who began to make accusations against me, and eventually 
elections were held for my post and I again became an ordinary 
Komsomol member. 
  Was this perhaps the moment that marked the start of my 
opposition? At the age of 16 I became an oppositionist. I did 
not like the authoritarian style of the class teacher, who did 
not value a pupil in the senior grade as an individual but tried 
to steer him as a helmsman steers his craft. And a few small 
elements of my future political soul began to crystallize in 
this opposition. I disagreed with the fact that the class 
teacher was engaging in overreporting. In order to make the 
class one of the best and improve the grade figures, she would 
take a book herself, open it at any page, and put a "3" next to 
somebody else's "2," so we had fewer laggard pupils. But I 
realized that this was false. And she realized that I disagreed 
with this approach. Our paths diverged. In the future I would 
never be one of those people who would form the foundation of 
the nomenklatura, a functionary sucking up to his boss, someone 
who later ruined our whole country. I never became a 
"Democratic Russia" supporter and I never became a Communist. I 
was in opposition to both. 
  Naturally, the class teacher took surreptitious revenge on 
me. For instance, knowing that I was going to go to a higher 
educational establishment specializing in languages and was 
intending to go to Moscow, she did not give me a "5" for English 
language. Although she did give a "5" to another boy who didn't 
know the language as well as me. But he was very affectionate 
with her. In my time at school I had repeatedly run up against 
the fact that some pupils get good marks not for knowledge but 
because their parents treat the teachers well and bring gifts to 
school. My poor Mom did not bring gifts and almost never came 
to school. She had no time. But in the school and in the class 
there were many children from affluent families where the 
mothers did not work and could often come to school and often 
talk with the teachers, which naturally influenced attitudes 
toward their children. My Mom only rarely visited the school 
and there were no gifts, so I was treated either with 
indifference or with distaste. 
  Someone such as I was often chosen as a target for 
criticism. 
In some respects I myself gave grounds for this, since I was 
perhaps not always very forthcoming, broke the rules, and 
whispered during lessons. 
  I was a fidgety lad with rather curly hair and a loud voice 
-- in general, I got myself noticed. And one teacher had only 
to start criticizing me for all the rest to weigh in with more 
criticism. I often got low marks for behavior in the results 
for the term. But I experienced no particular trouble at 
school. Although I remember that in eighth grade there was a 
fight. One boy, his name was Oleg Kalinichenko, attacked me and 
I defended myself, this whole thing was deemed to be a fight, 
and we were both barred from school, I think for three days. 
Then we were put in different classes, he in 8b, me in 8a, and 
in a couple of months we were both put back in our original 8b. 
So there were some incidents at school. 
  The school director was called Selitskiy and the director of 
studies was Boris Funder (I don't remember his patronymic). 
There were a lot of Jews in Alma-Ata, both in class and in the 
city -- the Jewish community was strong in those years. The 
consequences of the population movements and migration were 
clearly a factor here. From the west, Jews had headed a long 
way east, and some ended up in Alma-Ata. They were particularly 
numerous among the intelligentsia, including teachers. And 
especially among the school leadership. There were also 
Germans. In general it was a multinational city -- there were 
Uighurs, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, Germans, Jews, Greeks, many 
different peoples. There were Koreans. There was a Korean in 
our class -- Volodya Kim -- and Sasha Pak was in the parallel 
class. There were some Kazakhs, but very few. I remember one 
-- Khalimova -- because her father was Kazakhstan's minister of 
motor transport. It later transpired that his education was 
limited to just four grades, but he was a Kazakh, so he became a 
minister in the republic. I experienced this ethnic oppression 
from the very earliest childhood. I would ask Mom: Why do we 
have such bad housing conditions? Why can't we get an 
individual apartment? Mom replied: "We aren't Kazakhs. It's 
hard for us to get an apartment here. Kazakhs get priority." 
Mom worked in an institute cafeteria, and the lecturers would 
often tell her about the examinations and about how they felt 
sorry for the Russian kids. A Russian would give an answer and 
get a "2," a Kazakh would give just the same answer and get a 
"4." The reason was that there was a need for national cadres. 
And Russian lads would be left feeling bitter outside higher 
educational establishments. While Kazakhs who did not have 
sufficient knowledge would be studying just because they were 
Kazakhs. Is this not ethnic discrimination, is this not ethnic 
oppression? Surely all this affected my heart and mind? I was 
more socially concerned because I had experienced "hazing" in 
the communal apartment when I was very small. And because I had 
had problems with my relationships in kindergarten and at 
school. I had no good friends or a girl with whom I was in 
love. By the age of 18 I was already socially concerned. 
  I graduated from 11th grade at School No 25 in Alma-Ata, 
where I had studied from 1 through 11b. We had a photograph 
taken of the whole class one last time. Mostly everyone 
remained in Alma-Ata, just two or three people left for other 
cities, including me. There were girls in our class and the 
neighboring class I rather liked, there were dates, kisses, 
calls, meetings. There were very pure youthful feelings, and 
then all this burned out. 
  I was thinking about the trip to Moscow, where once again I 
would have to adapt, once again there would be material 
hardships, once again there would be dormitories, hostels, all 
that communal living when there are four people to a room. 
Again there would be communal toilets, cafeterias, public 
catering, and on top of that, difficult studies in the language 
institute, where there were many new disciplines and standards 
were high -- all this weighed on the body and heart of the 
20-year-old young man. And at a time when you ought to be 
falling head over heels in love and dating girls, I was sitting 
at my studies. And later on, when I was 20-24, it was not the 
same, something had burned out, I had somehow missed out on this 
particularly early surge of the lyricism of love, there was 
nobody to set me on the right road, and this naturally 
impoverished my heart, and as a result I never really fell in 
love with anyone. And throughout my later life I have never met 
the woman I need, the woman I can love. 
  My love for my mother may have played a part. After all, I 
grew up without a father, and on top of that with a stepfather 
who treated me badly. Everything my child's heart was capable 
of feeling was channeled toward my mother, I loved her very 
much. I could not imagine her dying or disappearing somewhere. 
Probably my entire potential for love was taken over by filial 
mother love, including the potential for boy-girl love. You 
only have one heart, one impulse to love, and mine was entirely 
focused on my mother. I loved her. Loved her very much. It 
was a double love, a triple love. Double because I loved her 
for my father as well, and triple because I saw her sufferings. 
I felt great sympathy for her, and sometimes I would see her 
tears and ask: "Mom, why are you crying?" And she would reply: 
"When you're grown up, son, you'll understand." And later I 
did understand that her life was unhappy. She had had a hard 
time with her first husband because she married as a 16-year-old 
who knew nothing about life. A couple of years were added to 
her age so she could marry. And she immediately had a baby, 
then another, until there were five. Her whole youth passed by 
while she spent a couple of years of sleepless nights looking 
after each child. She had virtually no sleep for nine years! 
She did not get on with her relatives. For some reason her 
brothers and sisters disliked her. Her sisters may have been 
envious that she had made a successful marriage to a military 
man -- they enjoyed certain privileges at that time. Relations 
were poor for some reason, and because her first husband was a 
communist and his work was special, military service, he did not 
want my mother to meet very often with members of her family or 
with her mother, my grandmother, because grandmother had been 
stripped of the right to vote. During the NEP [Lenin's New 
Economic Policy] years, when my grandfather had already died, my 
grandmother Fiona Nikiforovna Makarova, with five children to 
look after, opened a business. That was the slogan at the time. 
On the ground floor of her two-story wooden house she opened a 
small cafeteria which the local prosecutor, deputy, and judges 
used to visit. Then the NEP was wound up. And my grandmother 
was exiled to Solovki. By this time Mom and her elder sister 
were already married, but her younger sister Anna and brothers 
Petr and Vasiliy were unlucky, they were left with nobody to 
look after them. Sometimes they would go to my mother to get 
something to eat, but her husband, Andrey Vasilyevich, did not 
like this. He did not want my mother to meet with persons who 
were regarded as enemies of the people and were alien elements. 
This social hostility turned into family hostility. 
  Mom used to recall how during the thirties it was demanded 
that all servicemen's wives surrender all their gold. For the 
benefit of the Red Army, in order to strengthen defenses. And 
Mom gave up everything she had -- some lightweight jewelry, a 
ring, earrings -- because her husband was a colonel in the Red 
Army. All this was accepted merely by weight, and she received 
half a kilogram of candy, a few sweets, for the gold things she 
had inherited from her grandmother and great-grandmother. 
  So from childhood I experienced snubs on all sides, social 
hostility, and hostility among relatives. I grew up in an 
atmosphere where there was no warmth, not from anyone -- neither 
from relatives nor from friends and teachers. Nobody ever 
wanted me around, I was always in everybody's way, I was the 
target of criticism. I was almost never praised, usually they 
would "go on at" me about my bad points. There was nothing I 
was good at, I was not a very strong boy. I had no sporting 
achievements, although I tried my hand at unarmed combat, 
cycling, soccer, fencing, and shooting -- I tried everything. 
But there was nobody to show me the ropes so I could really get 
to grips with any type of sport. I wanted to do gymnastics, but 
it didn't work out. I had a bit of success at shooting. Prone, 
with a small-caliber rifle, I would score 96 out of 100. 
Apparently that was category three for men. I had no special 
talents in art or science either. I badly wanted to play the 
piano, but we didn't have a piano at home. I joined the brass 
band at the House of Young Pioneers. I think the instrument I 
played was called the tenor. But because I had no particular 
aptitude I gave it up after a few months. Then I joined a 
string ensemble at school. I played a folk instrument, the 
domra. I used to strum a bit as well, but I gave that up too. 
I tried to learn the guitar on my own, I bought a 
teach-yourself book and began learning, but it didn't work out. 
I bred pigeons, rabbits, and chickens. We even had a couple of 
goats at home. I worked for a couple of hours as a herdsman. 
That was probably my first-ever job. We did not have a dacha 
or relatives in the country, so as a schoolboy I used to run 
around the house during the vacations. Our neighbor had a cow. 
She noticed I was at a loose end and decided to use me as a 
herdsman, for half a liter of milk. One fine day I agreed, and 
I looked after her cow for a few hours, then drove it back to 
the shed. I was given half a liter of milk and I took it home, 
thinking Mom would be pleased I had earned half a liter of milk. 
But on the contrary Mom was annoyed, she didn't like her son 
being a herdsman. For some reason the lower people's social 
status is, the more they want their children's to be higher. So 
Mom forbade me to do this. 
  I remember I had a go at trading. Someone once brought us 
some peas and I decided to sell them. Ours was a quiet street 
not far from the market. I sat down and laid out my peas, but 
no one bought any of them from me. On the roof of our two-story 
house (you could clamber out onto the roof) was a long plank you 
could sunbathe on, and we boys from the same block would often 
dream up schemes for getting rich. Raise 100 chickens, sell 
them, buy a sheep, raise 20 sheep, buy a cow, raise cows, buy an 
elephant.... 
  Those were our dreams.... We watched the bees and fish going 
about their daily lives, we started smoking, we ran to the 
river, we tried to learn to swim, and I myself learned to swim. 
The river was called the Vesnovka. The boys in the 
neighborhood were embittered and quarrelsome. But there were 
almost none like that among my immediate neighbors. My postwar 
childhood passed in relative tranquility -- almost without 
hooliganism, half-starving, half in rags. Most of the kids 
around me were just as badly dressed as I was, and no one was 
particularly wealthy. I remember how amazed I was by a 
ballpoint pen belonging to a girl in our class. At the time 
these pens had only just appeared and I did not have one. Later 
we went to the girl's birthday, and their house had hot water. 
I was amazed -- our house didn't have hot water. We did not 
have a bath, just a toilet. If I wanted a bath I had to take a 
walk to the bathhouse. I hated waiting in line for a couple of 
hours at the bathhouse -- it was a company bathhouse, it 
belonged to the Turkestan-Siberia Railroad, and railroad workers 
did not have to wait in line. I remember the wooden cubicles 
where we undressed, the men all had the same shorts -- 
knee-length sateen. Everything was the same, even the color of 
men's shorts. There were four colors at most -- black, brown, 
blue, and dark green. Any other color, let alone anything with 
flowers on, or stripes, or like swimming trunks, would have been 
regarded as meaning you were crazy. Such were the times and 
attitudes. So much time was spent waiting in line at the 
bathhouse because we had no bath or shower. The little boy Vova 
would spend several hours a week sitting in line at the communal 
bathhouse, where you could not always find even a washbasin, 
standing in line for the hot taps, where the dirt and soapsuds 
dribbled across the floor.... All this was my childhood. 
  Along with the Alatau mountains, with their non-Russian 
name. 
We called them simply the mountains. We would go to the 
mountains and I would pick wild cherry-plums and pears. We 
would make dams and bathe. We smashed light bulbs and windows, 
engaged in a bit of petty hooliganism and even a bit of 
shoplifting. I remember the first self-service stores had 
opened, and we used to go there to steal candy. You could walk 
in because the sales staff were only at the exit, where people 
presented their shopping, and put candy inside your shirt or in 
your pocket. It was simply mischief, and it's a good job we 
didn't get into the habit of it. But we might have done, and 
then life would have turned out differently. We would have 
begun to do the rounds of correctional labor colonies and jails. 
It doesn't take much for a boy to go astray. 
  We were taken along to the militia on several occasions. One 
time we were returning from a swim, and we thought we had 
crossed the street where you were not allowed to. All of a 
sudden we heard a militiaman's whistle and the sound of 
footsteps, as though he was running toward us. We were scared 
and "ran for it." He began to gain ground on us, so we 
scattered, and for some reason he chose to follow me. He caught 
up with me, and I resisted, shouting and yelling. Naturally, 
nobody intervened or came to my assistance, and he led me off 
and handed me over to the nearest children's unit [detskaya 
komnata]. Later he explained that apparently he had been told 
that we had taken some woman's bag. Someone had complained to 
him, saying: Those are the boys, they were the hooligans. And 
he had run after us. We were scared of him because we thought 
we had crossed the street in the wrong place. That was how I 
ended up in a militia children's unit for the first time. I 
held out for a long time and would not say where I lived or who 
my parents were. But later I reached my parents via our 
neighbors' phone and Mom came along with my stepfather, and I 
was released. 
  The second time I was picked up for walking in the wrong 
place. Not far from home there was a new stadium, and the street 
had not yet been divided into roadway and sidewalk. There was 
gravel everywhere. People always used the whole width of the 
street -- roadway and sidewalk -- when they walked to the 
stadium. And I, a boy, also did this one day when there was no 
soccer match, and a Kazakh militiaman decided that this was a 
violation. He grabbed me, put me in a dump truck, and took me 
to the children's unit. He obviously had a target to meet. For 
bringing in offenders. They held me for a while then let me go. 
  Finally, on the third occasion, I was taken to the militia 
precinct house. I had been returning with Mom and my stepfather 
from the movies. When we reached the trolleybus stop there were 
some kids there from our block and they were laughing and 
talking. I stayed there with them, and my parents went home. We 
were standing near a smashed-up bench. A militia car drove up 
and a militiaman got out and came over to us, because he was 
obviously interested in a group of boys talking loudly about 
something and gesticulating. At this moment an elderly woman 
nearby muttered: "Those hooligans, they've been smashing up the 
benches." Barely pausing for thought, the militiaman grabbed 
the two nearest boys, one of whom was me: He put us in the car 
and drove us to the precinct house. He told the duty officer: 
They've been engaging in hooliganism. So I was taken in to the 
militia three times during my childhood. By the age of 18 I had 
learned a lot. Although I did not become a thief, did not 
become a hooligan, swindled no one, did not beat anyone, and did 
not do anything bad, it was a near thing. Such was life. I 
remember we threw smoke bombs into a trolleybus -- this was 
wrong, of course, someone could have been hurt. It was 
mischief. We wanted adventures. We would buy pacifiers from 
the drugstore, blow them up, make a little hole, fill them with 
water, and splash ourselves -- and cars and passersby. We 
sought adventures, we needed something because we were not sent 
to sections, hobby groups, or technical hobby centers, we did 
not have enough to do. So, left to ourselves, we made our own 
amusements, but, thank God, this was just mischief and 
naughtiness. I did not overstep the mark beyond which crime 
begins. This was clearly part of my father's genes. High 
culture. There were instances where I could have joined other 
boys in attacking and beating someone, but I did not do so. I 
was not cut out for thieving and crime. Only pranks -- climbing 
into somebody else's orchard and picking apples -- and anyhow, 
in the senior grades I put all this behind me. 
  Social problems were now beginning to concern me, and I was 
buying books: fundamentals of political knowledge, basic 
principles of economics and philosophy. Popular books on the 
social sciences like that were published at that time. I used 
to read them, I wanted to read them. I began to think about my 
future profession. My first wish was to join the army and 
become an officer. My two older brothers were in the army -- 
this may have been a factor. Military units marched past our 
home -- cavalry, military hardware, and ordinary soldiers. This 
made a strong impression on me. There were a great many movies 
about the war at that time. And military themes prompted me to 
become an officer and graduate from military school. Then I was 
drawn toward a legal speciality, I wanted to be an investigator. 
Obviously I was also excited by movies about criminals, 
murderers, thieves, and investigators. Finally, my third desire 
was to become a diplomat. A relative, my cousin's husband, once 
said: "Volodya, go to Moscow, enter the Moscow State Institute 
of International Relations, and become a diplomat. That's the 
life." I was indeed interested in foreign policy. I spent a 
long time looking at the atlas, I was attracted by other 
countries, I knew what the continents are, I loved geography 
lessons. I was attracted to politics. Philosophy, economics, 
foreign policy, social problems, the nationalities question -- I 
had already somehow experienced all this for myself in practice. 
Eventually I mastered everything, and I decided to go to Moscow 
and to enter if not the Moscow State Institute of International 
Relations, then at least its oriental counterpart -- the Moscow 
State University Institute of Oriental Languages. I did not 
become an officer -- at the military commissariat I was told 
there was no military school of the sort I wanted to enter. For 
some reason I was attracted to the internal troops. I had gone 
to the military commissariat and said that I wanted to enter a 
military school training officers for the internal troops. 
Maybe at the time there was indeed no such school or there were 
very few of them. At any rate, I was told: No, we don't know 
of any. And that was it. After that couldn't-care-less 
attitude on the part of the official at the military 
commissariat -- well, since there was no such school, my 
connection with the army was severed and I went in the foreign 
policy direction. 
  I graduated from school with no "3's"; my certificate showed 
mostly "4's," with two or three "5's," and I had a certificate 
awarding me the qualification of category two motor mechanic. I 
said goodbye to my girl, toward whom my feelings had already 
cooled. She was called Sveta. By this time I was 18, like her. 
  Moscow boys at this time already had a real sex life. But 
so far all I, a boy from a provincial city, had had was my first 
kisses. My first attempts to have sex were unsuccessful. At 
the age of 17 and 18 I was very timid and shy. I remember once 
at a sanatorium near Sochi to which I had gone with the class 
for a vacation on the Black Sea, I lay down with a girl, she was 
wearing a swimsuit, we got along fine, we were friendly. And I 
asked her to take off her panties. But what girl would take the 
initiative in removing her panties? I didn't know I ought to 
have done this myself, I ought to have helped her, I too was 
embarrassed. So we lay there until someone disturbed us. This 
shyness and timidity prevented me from starting my sex life when 
I already wanted to. Later on I may actually have been very 
insolent in my behavior with girls, but at first I was pure. I 
was very timid. Maybe even shy. I think I inherited this from 
my father. 
  Now came my social maturity. On 3 June 1964 I flew to 
Moscow, to Vnukovo Airport, in an IL-18 with a small suitcase 
containing the most basic necessities -- a shirt, a change of 
underwear, I don't even think I had a spare pair of boots. In 
my other hand I had a basket of strawberries and tomatoes. At 
home they began to ripen very early and were comparatively 
cheap. Mom said: Take them, maybe you can give them to someone 
on the admissions panel and they will treat you better. She did 
not realize that this would certainly have been the first bribe 
in my life if I had indeed taken the basket of strawberries to 
the admissions panel. But I was young, I did not have any 
thoughts like that in my head. For convenience I simply left the 
basket in a baggage locker. Why lug it around when I still 
didn't know where I was going? I arrived right in the center of 
Moscow, on Red Square. The airport bus stopped outside the 
Lenin museum, and I found out the address of the Institute of 
Oriental Languages from the information bureau. The institute 
was opposite, on the other side of the Manezh, near the Hotel 
"Natsional." I went there and presented my documents, and then 
came the first blow. The documents did not meet the 
requirements for entrants to the higher educational 
establishment. One of the main documents was missing: the 
recommendation from the Komsomol rayon committee. I did not 
know this. Before this I had written to my brother, who lived 
in Moscow and was a soldier, asking him to find out the terms 
for admission to the Moscow State Institute of International 
Relations. He was told that the Moscow State Institute of 
International Relations did not have a hostel. That was 
deception. It did have a hostel. But that was how they stopped 
boys from out of town entering this institute. So I did not 
enter the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, if 
only because they could not provide me with a hostel. Anyhow, I 
would not have been able to get though the entrance competition, 
because you had to muster 15 points, and I would have had no 
chance of getting "5's" for geography, composition, and English. 
I had stopped studying geography in ninth grade, and I had 
never taken a refresher course. It's practically impossible to 
get a "5" for composition. And it would be unrealistic of me to 
expect a graduate from an ordinary school in a provincial city 
to pass English when boys from Moscow special schools could not 
always get a "5" even when they had lived abroad with their 
parents. So I went to the Institute of Oriental Languages. But 
there, too, you had to have a letter of recommendation. I went 
to stay with my brother near Moscow and urgently wrote a letter 
to Mom. She managed somehow to get the letter of recommendation 
from the local Komsomol rayon committee and sent it to me, and I 
submitted the documents to the institute. 
  I was assigned to a hostel, I got a bed, and I began to 
prepare for the examinations. I knew my knowledge of English 
was inadequate. But I had to take five exams. Oral and written 
Russian, history, oral and written English. I went to the 
institute and directly asked a woman whether she could help me 
to find an English language teacher. I apparently made a good 
impression on her -- at any rate, she gave me the phone number 
of a woman teacher. This teacher lived somewhere in Rechnoy 
Vokzal [area around riverboat station in northwest Moscow], so I 
went there and began to study. After the first class she said I 
had to pay R10. I was very surprised, it seemed an enormous sum 
to me. I wrote Mom again, she was on leave at the time, but she 
went to work so she could send me the money for the tutor. In 
total I think I paid R100. That was a tremendous sum for me. 
But I passed the exams. I got a "3" for composition, "4" for 
oral Russian and literature, "5" for history, "3" for written 
English, and "3" for oral English. That was enough to get in. 
Humanities higher education establishments were not in demand 
at that time. Everyone was trying to get into the Moscow 
Engineering and Physics Institute, the Physico-Technical 
Institute, and the Baumanskiy Institute. The Institute of 
Oriental Languages was not especially popular among humanities 
institutes. There was not much competition, just three people 
per place. And in practice everyone who passed the last exam 
was enrolled. 
  I received my student card and my first reprimand from the 
dean. He asked why I was unshaven. I had still not begun to 
shave; I had fluff on my chin. I was warned there would be no 
grant because of my "3's" in the entrance exams. This was yet 
another blow. So I constantly received blows, every month. 
This was to continue until the present time. Thank God they 
did not refuse me a place in the hostel. And despite everything 
they did give me a grant, R35. Also Mom promised to send R30. 
So I studied for five years on those R65. Of course, once 
again I ate badly and was badly dressed. What could I buy for 
R65? I had to pay for the hostel, I had to buy books. Pens, 
notebooks, ice cream, movie tickets -- all these cost money 
too. Then there was food every day. I could not spend more 
than R2 on the lot, since I had only R65, R3 of which went on 
the hostel, and I also had to get around, so I had a maximum of 
R2 a day. But I was young. And if we were going to go to a 
cafe, for instance, and order something, I naturally always had 
problems. To say nothing of dates with girls, movie tickets, or 
tickets for concerts and dances. My whole life was poverty. I 
never had money for anything. But on the other hand I applied 
myself with frenzy to my studies. 
  It was a humanities higher educational establishment, so 
there was no more of my least favorite subjects -- mathematics, 
physics, chemistry, drawing, biology. There were only 
humanities subjects. But here too there were ones I disliked. 
For instance, an introduction to special philology -- in 
general I disliked the philological disciplines. I liked 
history, but the faculty was called the historico-philological 
faculty. I got into the philology department. Was this because 
I had written on my application: Turkish language and 
literature? I found myself in the philology department. That 
was another mistake. Thank God I got into the Turkish 
department; after all, I could have ended up in the Mongolian or 
Vietnamese department, or doing some African language -- Bambara 
or Malinke. 
  So there I was, a student with a miserly grant and a bed in 
a 
hostel, without friends, on my own in an unfamiliar city. It 
took a lot of effort to adjust and acquire my first comrades and 
a few personal contacts. But my main efforts were devoted to my 
studies. I began to do well, and literally in my second year I 
began to receive a bigger grant. This was R47.50. I received a 
bigger grant for several semesters in succession. I was elected 
group senior, and then Komsomol organizer in years four through 
six. I began to be politically active in 1967. I sent a letter 
to the CPSU Central Committee on 15 April 1967 and in an appeal 
to the country's leadership I proposed carrying out reforms in 
the spheres of agriculture, education, and industry. I felt we 
were heading in the wrong direction and developing the wrong 
way, the life around me suggested this. There were classes on 
political economy, philosophy, and the history of the CPSU and 
contacts with my contemporaries and lecturers. So 15 April 1967 
marks the start of my conscious, active political life. In 
December 1967 I took another step. I made a hard-hitting speech 
at a debate on "Democracy Over There (that is, in the West) and 
in Our Country (that is, the USSR)." This displeased some 
people. Thus I came to the notice of the leadership of the 
Institute of Oriental Languages, particularly of Rector A.A. 
Kovalev and Prorector M.F. Yuryev. Then in January 1968 the 
first political blow came. My character reference for a 
one-month trip to Turkey as a translator with a sporting 
delegation was rejected on the grounds that I was politically 
unreliable. This was very annoying. At that time dissidents 
had already emerged and there were trials. Daniel, Sinyavskiy, 
Solzhenitsyn.... Some people were banned, some were expelled. 
But I was not in this league, I had merely spoken out 
spontaneously, but even this was enough for me to be regarded as 
unreliable. This naturally made me angry. Especially as our 
period of study abroad was coming up, our whole fifth year was 
devoted to practical experience. I was assigned to the Radio 
Committee and I spent eight months there as a student trainee 
working on the Turkish desk in the section broadcasting to 
foreign countries. Then I switched to practical training at the 
State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations. I badly wanted 
to travel to Turkey; after all, I was studying the country and 
the language. But relations were weak and none of the students 
went there. I learned that there was a possibility of traveling 
to Turkey with a delegation of engineers via the State Committee 
for Foreign Economic Relations and I made the maximum effort to 
ensure that my character reference was approved, despite 
everything. In April 1969 I traveled to a capitalist country 
for the first time. Before this, in 1966, I had had my first 
trip abroad -- to Hungary, as a member of the Moscow State 
University student construction detachment. As I now recall, we 
passed through the Csop border station and we were on the 
Hungarian side, and there was a Hungarian girl pushing a cart 
with sweets and drinks. I realized for the first time that I 
was abroad, here it was, a foreign country. I greatly liked 
Budapest and I fell in love there with a Hungarian girl called 
Anike. There were dates and kisses, then we exchanged letters 
for a few months. That was all. But 6 weeks in Budapest! We 
spent a month working on a construction project, then we 
traveled around the country. We had a vacation at Lake Balaton. 
  I also went to a student camp near Anapa on the Black Sea 
and to a vacation center at Krasnovidovo outside Moscow under 
the auspices of Moscow State University -- once again there were 
dances and a few acquaintances with girls. But during these 
student years I really had no girl. I badly wanted to fall in 
love with someone and date her, but it did not work out, I could 
not. Obviously I myself was to blame. I was too concerned with 
social problems; I was devoting too much effort and energy to my 
studies. The price of this was lack of a personal life. 
  So I virtually sent myself on an eight-month stint abroad in 
Turkey. There was a bit of an incident there; they tried to 
accuse me of conducting communist propaganda because I had given 
Soviet badges to local Turkish kids. Once again I was unlucky. 
There were constant blows of fate the whole time. Every month, 
every year. My mother's husband died, another blow. I had to 
travel to Alma-Ata and help Mom to pay her last respects. In 
general, there was little joy. And when my mother said she had 
lived her life and there had not been a single happy day, there 
was nothing to remember, I thought in similar terms about 
myself: I too had already lived a sizable part of my life, I 
too had had almost no happy day. I remember starting school -- 
there was no joy, no one shared this joy with me. I graduated 
from school -- once again there was little joy because I had to 
go to an alien city, I was short of money, and I did not know 
whether or not I would get into the institute.... I graduated 
from my higher educational establishment with distinction, but 
once again there was nobody to share the joy with. I graduated 
from Moscow University with distinction and received my Red 
Diploma in the Moscow State University assembly hall on the 
Lenin Hills. But no one was there with me, there was no one to 
be happy for me and share my joy. I took the Red Diploma back 
to my room in the hostel, and there was not even anyone to drink 
a glass of champagne with. I was entirely alone. 
  When I graduated from the higher educational establishment I 
wanted to buy a car. Using the certificates I had earned in 
Turkey, I bought myself a Zaporozhets, and it stood outside the 
window, without a garage. I was assigned to the army. And 
where -- Tbilisi! Once again an alien city and an alien 
republic. I had only just gotten back from Turkey, where there 
had been all that trouble, and now I was off to Georgia. Why 
not Russia, why was I being assigned to the army, why not 
others? That cholera-stricken summer of 1970 I drove in my 
Zaporozhets to Tbilisi via Anapa. I stayed for the last time in 
the student camp where I had been in 1968, where on one visit I 
met my future comrade, the mathematician Vladimir Aleksin. He 
did not become a great friend of mine, but we kept in touch for 
about 20 years or even more, about 25 years. Once again I was 
unlucky. We were acquaintances, but not friends. There was 
someone else I knew, again we met via university. Aleksandr, a 
physicist. Again it was the same story. We called each other, 
we traveled together to vacation centers. But there was no 
friendship.... 
  My youth.... I had no luck in life because I think I had no 
close friend. In the block where I was born there were five or 
six local boys, and they were all different, but there was no 
warm friendship with any of them. Clearly, this was my fate, 
never really to experience anything of either love or 
friendship. Relations with my family were not all that warm 
either. Obviously it was fate. And all this, taken together, 
affected my life. Maybe it's like an artist or a composer who 
needs unhappiness in order to create, in order to bring 
inspiration. It was the same with me -- so I could develop a 
better and more profound understanding of political processes in 
society, I experienced a degree of disadvantage in all other 
respects. The wrong food, the wrong clothes, maybe the wrong 
comrades, the wrong entertainments, the lack of brilliant 
successes during my early education, in sport, and in any other 
forms of activity. In fact maybe this is an objective process. 
All my energy had to be focused on one thing. If there had 
been a girl I loved maybe I would have devoted half my energy or 
a large part to her, if I had had a very close friend this would 
have taken up time. If I had had very good relations with my 
family once again I would have spent a lot of time on contacts 
with them. But things worked out in such a way that, 
willy-nilly, I constantly devoted myself to social questions. I 
felt constant social concern, and I thought about society and 
its problems, about social questions, and about relations 
between people. The constant sense of dissatisfaction was a 
stimulus. 
  After all, you cannot engage in politics for no particular 
reason. It's not a favorite school subject, physics, say, where 
there are specific laws associated with the theory and the 
subject. Politics as an art is a special sphere of activity, 
and not everyone can grasp it. Perhaps anybody can go to a 
rally, stand there, and listen; anyone can make a few comments 
of their own and put forward slogans, but to get thoroughly to 
grips with politics requires knowledge, above all of the 
humanities. Knowledge of history, economics, philosophy, and 
jurisprudence. And also the potential to make you want to do 
this. Like an artist, someone who wants to engage in politics 
must formulate his own ideas, find an opportunity to express 
them, and meet with approval. Without recognition, a politician 
will get nowhere. Just like an artist who cannot find anyone who 
admires his talent. But artists sometimes get posthumous 
recognition. It is harder for politicians. A politician has to 
secure recognition during his lifetime. Otherwise he simply 
does not make it as a politician, people simply forget about 
him, and his name does not feature anywhere. "Does not feature 
on the lists." An artist can leave pictures, a writer an 
unpublished work, but it is very difficult for a politician to 
appear anywhere in the annals of history. He is usually 
topical. He is of the present. 
  My disadvantaged personal life helped make me a good 
student, 
I tried to find some sort of satisfaction from this, and I 
graduated with distinction from the Institute of Asian and 
African Countries. Then came the army. For some reason 
everybody is reluctant to join the army, but I felt I needed 
this. I was drawn to politics, and I realized that army service 
would help me, even with regard to my biography, because people 
can always ask: Why did you not serve in the army? Why did you 
avoid this extremely important institution in our social life? 
Especially as I served as an officer in the Transcaucasus 
Military District Staff Political Directorate. At that time 
Georgia was still ruled by Mzhavanadze, he was the next-to-last 
Georgian "czar" and first secretary of the Georgian Communist 
Party Central Committee. Bribery and nepotism flourished 
luxuriantly under him. This was the period I encountered, but 
after I had left, in 1972 they appointed Shevardnadze, who 
attempted to use Andropov-style methods to impose order in 
Georgia for the whole period through 1985, until Gorbachev moved 
him to Moscow. 
  My two years in the army were very useful to me. First, I 
got to know the army itself, I got to know political work. I 
got to know some aspects connected with special propaganda and 
intelligence and I made a deeper study of the nationalities 
question. I had quite a good knowledge of nationalities 
problems even previously, but the Transcaucasus area was 
different from Central Asia. Here I also saw the situation that 
later led to the perestroyka factors. There was really no 
Soviet power there and there were no real communists -- all this 
rottenness and communist scum effectively corrupted the Russian 
communists too. And the main problem emanated from there, from 
the south. All Russia's problems are in the south. So until we 
resolve our southern problem [uzel] we will never extricate 
ourselves from the protracted crisis, which will periodically 
worsen. 
  I managed to get myself a room -- 26 square meters. It would 
have been difficult and expensive to live in a hotel. It was 
hard to get a room, but I approached the members of the military 
council, the chief of the political directorate, and some other 
people.... I paid just R3. Once again it meant long corridors 
and communal kitchens and toilets. But one room was my own. I 
found myself a neighbor, Valya Malik, a lad from Ukraine who had 
been to the special communications school in Sumy that trains 
specialists for the eighth sections of staffs. I lived there 
with him for almost two years. I lived on my own for the last 
few months. 
  I got to know Georgia and visited Armenia and Tskhinvali. I 
studied the people's life, customs, and culture. For some 
reason I had no desire to study Georgian. In two years of 
contact with the Georgians I could have studied the language, 
but I knew just two or three common phrases and understood 
nothing more. And I did not want to, I had absolutely no desire 
to study this language. I was probably tired of learning 
foreign languages since everywhere I felt myself discriminated 
against -- in Alma-Ata, where Kazakh was the dominant language. 
In Turkey, where it was Turkish. But at least Turkey was 
indeed a different country. Now in Georgia it was Georgian, and 
Azerbaijan was nearby, where it was Azeri.... 
  I often went on assignments. I delivered lectures among 
the troops. I wrote pamphlets. I studied Turkey, Iran, the 
Near East, the Arab world. All this was useful for my general 
development. I gained a deeper grasp of domestic and foreign 
policy processes in the country. I was now a specialist, a 
orientalist with practical experience. I had been to Turkey, I 
had been to the Caucasus, as a child I had lived in Central Asia 
-- all this helped me gain a deeper knowledge of problems 
associated with the Muslim religion. There was the Georgian 
church, the Armenian church, and the Kurds. I could directly 
see and observe them in the Transcaucasus and in Turkey. All 
this was useful. Although there were also moments of sadness. 
My wife refused to come with me, she was writing a thesis. She 
did not want to leave Moscow. We would meet mostly on holidays 
-- sometimes she would visit me, sometimes I would visit her. 
This nomadic way of life for almost 18 months brought no joy, 
of course. Nevertheless, I saved up a sum of money and returned 
home with the first payment for a cooperative three-room 
apartment. I made the payment independently. Later I earned 
the money for a set of furniture. My wife's parents helped us 
to buy bedroom furniture, and we joined forces to equip the 
kitchen, so bit by bit we furnished our three-room apartment. 
  One time I stayed at my mother-in-law's for almost a year. 
This too was unpleasant. We got along okay, I was not treated 
badly. But I felt a degree of hostility and incompatibility. 
Finally, 9 May 1973, I was a civilian with a wife and son, in 
my own apartment. But once again in a remote and inconvenient 
place, on the outskirts of Moscow. Teplyy Stan. There was no 
subway station nearby, no movie theaters, no phone. Nothing but 
a construction site almost at the beltway. We were on the 
ground floor, it was cold, and in general we were frightened. 
Once again we had to change our apartment. We did not succeed 
in moving somewhere else in the same block. With great 
difficulty I became chairman of the cooperative, worked for a 
year or 18 months, and came up with a possible exchange in 
another block where people were moving out of five apartments. 
So I found myself in a different block, on the eighth floor. 
Once again I was at the end of my strength and, most of all, 
how tired I felt at the ages of 27, 28, and 29 -- I had a new 
job, I was starting out on ordinary family life together, the 
child meant kindergarten and sicknesses, the cooperative 
apartment was expensive, and we needed to move to a different 
floor, and that meant voluntary work. And at work I had to take 
on some additional voluntary responsibilities, teach French as 
well, improve my English, and learn German. On top of that I 
continued to study at the Moscow State University law faculty 
night school. All this was a terrible workload, I have no idea 
how I endured it. My best years were frittered away on trivial 
concerns which I could have been relieved of. But once again, 
everything seemed to be pushing me toward just one thing -- more 
knowledge, a better grasp of social problems -- cooperative 
housing construction, family matters, my relations with my 
in-laws, my job, the problems of labor collectives, trade union 
committees, party committees, leaders, party meetings, CPSU 
Congresses, discussion of the 1977 new constitution -- I took 
part in all this, it was like hail, like rain, like a hurricane, 
this all hardened me. It did not make me a dissident, an enemy, 
but it helped to shape my identity, my political identity. I 
saw the shortcomings, saw the blunders, saw the mistakes. At 
the same time I did not feel bitter toward the ordinary 
communists alongside me, they worked just the same, they were 
not enemies of our country. But at one time they had been 
forced to join the party, otherwise they would not have been 
able to study or to take up a post. I understood this, and I 
experienced similar difficulty because, without a party card and 
without joining the CPSU, my opportunities for promotion, for 
moving to other establishments, and for studies -- for instance, 
postgraduate work or studies in an academy -- were limited. All 
that was closed to me. You see the world as a world of 
apartheid when you're a nonparty person. From childhood I had 
experienced ethnic oppression since I had lived in non-Russian 
regions. Now I was living in Moscow. I seemed to be in Russia, 
in the capital, but here too there was oppression -- political 
oppression. I was n/p, a nonparty person. What was more, this 
was especially keenly felt in work verging upon the political, 
for by virtue of both my first and second educations I was 
connected in one way or another with the state apparatus and 
with work in central institutions, where party connections were 
an essential, mandatory phenomenon and I was, so to speak, 
condemned in advance to a secondary role and nobody wanted me. 
Personnel officers would set aside my "file" as soon as they 
saw the entry for "party membership" -- n/p. I belonged to a 
different caste, as it were. At the Communist Party meetings 
which I would sometimes attend, they would say: Now we're going 
to have the closed part of the meeting, Vladimir Volfovich, 
you'd better go. So I would go. This was very annoying. 
  All these factors seemed to be coming on top of each other. 
My unhappy childhood, the lack of good friends, poor everyday 
living conditions, bad food, poor leisure, nonparty status, the 
fact that I had lived in various regions -- all this was the 
foundation on which my political identity began to mature. If I 
had been born in an affluent family in a Russian city, among 
Russian people, and had never moved anywhere, if my childhood 
friends and the girl I loved had been right there next to me, 
then maybe I would have turned my back on politics. 
  Gorbachev had an easy life. Why did he ruin the country, why 
could he not do any good? He was weak because he had it all. 
He was the son of a kolkhoz chairman, in other words, the son 
of a landowner. He lived like a little lord even then. Then he 
entered Moscow University and began to do Komsomol work. He got 
it all straightaway and enjoyed life. He did not have the 
potential to be a political leader. It was an ordinary career 
for a functionary. So he could not become a statesman and 
became a destroyer, an adventurist, a voluntarist. Khrushchev 
was the same. He worked in a mine. Then he graduated from the 
"Red" academy. He had absolutely no education in the 
humanities. Andropov too was an uneducated person. There is 
that stupid little line in his biography: He has higher 
education. What did that mean? Party correspondence school. 
Well, what kind of an education is that? Brezhnev. Some 
metallurgical night institute, some technical college, again 
neither one thing nor the other. So all Russia's rulers have 
lacked a classical education. Even Ulyanov [Lenin]. He was 
expelled from everywhere and eventually he passed his exams as 
an external student. That is no education. These are students 
that nobody wants. He was graded, then he went abroad and 
practically never lived in the country. That is the whole 
problem. There was Nicholas, who was simply tired. The last of 
the Romanov dynasty. To rule a state for 300 years! Naturally 
they were tired and could do no more. The people who took their 
place were totally unprepared for this and had no grounding in 
the classics. They rose as somebody's favorites, did their 
dirty work, and died. Terror, arbitrariness, perestroyka, 
Khrushchev's "spring," the thaw, stagnation, the Andropov 
regime.... It was all temporary, temporary, temporary.... All 
that linked them was the party, that political organization. 
But it too collapsed because it was rotting since it had no 
competitors or firm base within society because of its personnel 
approach. People hated communists because all the leaders were 
communists. Any communist worker would work like a nonparty 
person. A communist kolkhoz member would work just like a 
nonparty kolkhoz member. A nonparty lecturer would teach just 
like a communist lecturer. But the hatred arose because all the 
leaders in the country, from the team leader on a construction 
project to ministers, were exclusively CPSU members. So every 
shortcoming was linked with the party. The bribes, the failures 
in the economy, the failure to keep promises, the failures in 
foreign policy, the various clashes and conflicts -- everything 
was linked with it, with the party. Wherever someone turned 
with any problem, everywhere he would run up against a 
communist. Communists were everywhere, so to speak. So slight 
anticommunism ripened in people's minds even before perestroyka. 
During the period of perestroyka, when they began to preach 
anticommunism at the top, this became a current, a sickness, an 
ideology and took hold of the minds of millions of people. It 
is now difficult for the new communists to succeed, very 
difficult. Anticommunism is firmly established in the minds of 
millions of potential voters. This helped me to form a 
foundation. I did not become a fierce anticommunist. So I did 
not find myself among the dissidents. I was not jailed, I was 
not thrown into a mental hospital, I was not forced to leave. I 
was not talented enough to write something or make something 
that could be banned, not put on show, or not publicized. So I 
did not experience harassment by the authorities. There was 
some slight pressure with regard to my career. I could not work 
where I wanted to, I could not fill the post I wanted to. But 
all these negative experiences, brick by brick, formed the 
foundation and, when certain external conditions were created, 
this combined with my accumulated inner positive potential for 
political activity. 
  At 30, having reached the age of maturity, I wanted to 
really 
engage in politics and to be in some new political party without 
fail, I dreamed that this party would have its own deputies in 
parliament when it became a multiparty parliament, and I dreamed 
of heading the parliamentary opposition, my party's faction in 
parliament. Maybe in the long term of getting a ministerial 
post. I had thought about high posts before as well, but this 
was not any kind of an obsession with me or a soldier's dream of 
becoming a general. It was just that I saw these people, their 
entourage, their inability to lead the country. I realized that 
these dull-witted, sometimes simply stupid people reached the 
heights merely thanks to the system that allowed them to do so. 
Under a multiparty system I was sure, talented people would have 
more opportunities to pursue their own political career. So I 
did not set the aim of necessarily becoming president. I had an 
initial aim -- to create or join a new political party, to get 
into parliament, and to act within the framework of the faction 
of the political party thanks to which I had gotten into 
parliament in order to uphold my party's ideas there, work to 
increase its prestige, and ensure that it became the ruling 
party. 
  For me as an individual there was never any fanaticism 
about necessarily reaching any particular height. But there 
probably was fanaticism about implementing the goal, the idea 
whose supporter I had become. This also finds expression in 
ensuring that we all begin to live well in our country. Because 
when I was not able to work where I wished, this may have 
humiliated and aggrieved me, but I never dreamed of taking 
revenge on anyone because I had not been allowed to become a 
diplomat and had not been given the opportunity to work in the 
Foreign Ministry or other prestigious institutions. I was 
prepared to find my niche in another sphere and to make use of 
my potential. 
  But even in early childhood something dawned on me. It was a 
kind of ultimate idea which was like the intellect governing the 
world. Even when I was a small boy walking along the quiet 
street from home toward the Nikolskaya church and Nikolskiy 
market, there was something -- even then, as a barefoot boy, 
thoughts of something great were hovering in my head. At that 
time I could not grasp this in specific terms. But even then I 
intuitively foresaw that I was obviously destined for big-league 
politics. And this came to pass. This was no accident. 
Occasionally some of my opponents say: Where did he come from, 
we never knew him, we were stuck in jail, we were in the CPSU, 
we were abroad, but where did he pop up from all of a sudden? 
He wasn't in jail, or in the CPSU, or in a mental hospital, or 
abroad, he was not part of the galaxy of people who were 
expelled or exiled and whose works were not printed. This has 
evoked wariness, even bitterness, and mistrust. And envy, of 
course. An educated man with two university degrees who speaks 
European languages -- where did he pop up from, this throwback 
to the prosperous Russia of the last century. The rest felt 
themselves to be misfits, proletarians, members of the unknown 
and unrecognized intelligentsia.... I have naturally occupied a 
special niche in the Russian political arena in the last few 
years. But this followed organically from my previous life. 
  My subsequent career was this: After the army I worked in 
the Committee for the Defense of Peace, in the international 
relations section. There happened to be a vacancy for a 
consultant who knew French, which was not a very popular 
language in Moscow, so I turned up, having only just finished my 
service in the army, in political organs. I was hired. At the 
time I was still a Komsomol member. I think I was very lucky, 
despite everything there has been some luck in my life. After 
all, there might have been a vacancy for a consultant on Africa. 
  I did a lot of work with delegations from Western countries 
-- France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, and a number of other 
countries. I took part in holding the congress of peace 
supporters in Moscow in October 1973 and the World Congress of 
Youth and Students, which was held in Berlin that same year, in 
the summer, I think. I plunged into real political life, with 
the broadest contacts. Even when I was studying at the 
Institute of Asian and African Countries, I worked as a 
translator with various delegations via the Writers Union and 
other organizations. I had very frequent contacts with 
foreigners, a lot of foreigners studied at our university on the 
Lenin Hills. At the time in the student residence I very much 
wanted to share a room or at least an apartment with a 
Frenchman, but for a year I had to share with a Mongolian. The 
student department once told me to share an apartment with an 
Italian, but for some reason I thought that I would not need 
Italian and I refused. I was probably wrong to do so -- 
knowledge of Italian would perhaps have come in useful for me 
now. Nevertheless, I wanted to use even sharing an apartment 
with a foreign student in order to improve my linguistic 
knowledge. Thus, the foreign element in my life was a constant 
presence, and I was surrounded from childhood by representatives 
of different peoples. So the following was a concept close to 
my heart: There are different cultures, different 
civilizations, different mentalities. I could not be an 
isolated chauvinist wearing national blinders. I am in favor of 
the broadest development -- the most important thing is that 
there be no enmity, no dominance by any one nation, no 
discrimination. This consciousness developed gradually. I 
studied South Kazakhstan, Central Asia, then the whole of Russia 
and Moscow. I worked abroad, I had contacts with foreign 
delegations from Western Europe and America, I helped prepare 
international congresses -- and eventually my planetary world 
outlook began to emerge: We are all citizens of the same planet. 
  I had frequent contacts with an organization like World 
Federalists, which even at that time, 30-50 years ago, began to 
preach the idea of the all-European home. And Dr. Max Khabbit 
[surname as transliterated], a Swiss lawyer who was a candidate 
for the post of president of the Swiss Confederation, was a good 
acquaintance of mine, we had a lot of contact. He invited me to 
visit him, but at that time it was very difficult to visit a 
nonrelative in a capitalist country. So our contacts were 
mostly limited to him coming here. He visited Moscow several 
times and gave me his literature. 
  In the army my work was also connected with foreign affairs, 
and I studied the Near East and at the same time the West and 
other regions. My subsequent work also made it possible one way 
or another to have contact with foreigners. Even at the "Mir" 
Publishing House, where I worked for the last few years before I 
quit for big-league politics, there were foreigners and I had to 
conclude contracts with foreign firms. All this helped to 
ensure that I studied foreign experience a great deal at work. 
So my entire labor activity helped ultimately to develop my 
world outlook and inner concept. Knowledge of economics, for 
instance. "Mir" was a major publishing house. It encompassed 
production, culture, ideology, and legal work -- all spheres. I 
know economics not from textbooks but from practical experience 
-- plants, agricultural enterprises, work in various 
institutions, business trips. 
  I was lucky, I traveled the whole country from Izmail to 
Chukotka. I would go on leave by air. I have long known our 
whole country. It comes as no revelation to me what people live 
in what region in our country, what their religion, way of life, 
and problems are, and so forth. I am very familiar with all 
this, I have seen it all. I have often talked with people on 
trains and chatted on aircraft. Everything I had accumulated by 
the age of 45 can be described as experience of life and a 
degree of worldly wisdom, and I am not bragging here. After 
all, some 25-year-old boys regard themselves as politicians 
because they have read a few slender theoretical books. But a 
young man who has graduated from a medical institute is not yet 
a surgeon. It takes time for him to gain experience. This is 
especially necessary for a politician. You get talented surgeons 
even of 30. And 28-year-old physicists and doctors of sciences. 
But it is very difficult for a politician to show his mettle in 
every respect at a young age, because you have to have knowledge 
of life. You cannot skip this stage, at the age of 28 or 29 you 
cannot travel everywhere, learn everything, and have an 
all-around education. All this is difficult, it takes years and 
years. Maturity arrives somewhere around the age of 40. The 
time of wisdom begins, and a person is now capable of making 
decisions and answering for them. After all, it is one thing to 
be a political scientist studying politics as a science, as a 
subject. It is a different matter to be an active politician 
capable of making a decision. 
  Two years ago I took part in a roundtable at the "Nauka" 
Publishing House. At the end of the session the moderator asked 
the representatives of other parties (there were several of them 
there): Are you ready to form a government right now? They 
were dismayed. They said: No, we need to hold consultations, 
we need to give it some thought. But when they turned to me, I 
replied: Yes, we're ready. That is also the difference. You 
can describe yourself as a political party but not take part in 
elections and not be able or ready to put forward your candidate 
for deputy in a local representative organ or at some higher 
level, let alone a candidate for president. 
  Elections were held for the president of Russia. No party 
put forward its candidate. Yet there are 43 parties in the 
country today. And around 100 different movements and 
organizations. But there were not 40 candidates for president. 
There was just one candidate from a political party -- myself. 
Many may regard themselves as politicians, but they will be 
dilettantes. It's the same with sport. Little kids play soccer 
in every back yard, especially in the countryside. But they 
cannot call themselves footballers and high-class sportsmen. 
You get pilots of different levels, too. You get pilots of 
agricultural crop-sprayers, and pilot-cosmonauts. Some go into 
space, others fly at a height of 300 meters and spray 
pesticides. Both perform a necessary job, but the level of the 
job is different. It's the same in medicine. There is the nurse 
who hands the surgeon the instruments, but it is the leading 
surgeon who stands at the operating table. He's the one who 
saves the patient. Although the nurse who hands him the 
instruments is also necessary. Like the one who sterilizes the 
instruments, and the ones who prepare the patient for the 
operation. But they have different levels of knowledge. In 
politics situations sometimes arise where you have to save a 
country, you have to make decisions on that level. 
  Take Gorbachev in Foros in August 1991. He could have 
acted differently. Everything depended on him alone. And 
events would have developed quite differently. Because a 
statesman, a politician who considers the possibility of 
occupying top state posts, that is an exceptional, special 
sphere of labor activity. You cannot be just an average worker 
here. You can be an ordinary engineer, doctor, or coach. But 
politics, which involves the lives of millions of people, is the 
most responsible of jobs. You could not think up anything more 
responsible. Even the defense minister has less responsibility. 
He only has the armed forces. But here you have the whole 
country. And sometimes the whole planet. Because a great 
thermonuclear power like Russia, or America, or China, means 
making decisions on a planetary scale. This is no task for 
lightweights. Many young people are trying to create parties 
today, but these are fly-by-night parties, parties as a fashion. 
"I've got a party. I'm the party leader. We publish our own 
newspaper. We hold a congress. We demand that so-and-so 
resign, that so-and-so be punished...." That is merely playing 
at politics, and it is coming to an end. That is scum that will 
pass. Any world country is left with five or six parties that 
make up the political spectrum. But 40, 50, or 100 parties will 
not exist for long, of course. We need time now. After all, 
people want to express themselves, especially in our country, 
where for there was a single-party regime for so long. 
Naturally after such a single-party regime, there will be a 
very, very multiparty regime. But eventually, everything will be 
reduced to a three-, four-, or five-party system. That is 
sufficient to express the basic political views of the 
population and groups of voters. 
  I think that to engage in politics is useful, noble, and 
dangerous all at once, like any other profession. But education 
is essential here. Essential. When I read the biographies of 
the leaders of some of Russia's political parties, I often find 
category five electrician, or chess player, or writer, or 
biologist.... This always astonishes me. How can you engage in 
politics when you have such a narrow base of knowledge? You 
need extremely broad horizons here. You need knowledge of 
philosophy, history, philology, literature, sociology, 
jurisprudence, political science -- the broadest spectrum. You 
need to be a bit of a journalist, writer, leader, and orator, to 
know foreign languages, and to have a grasp of economic 
problems, ecology, child-raising, the activity of law 
enforcement bodies, and state security. The army, young people, 
sports, art -- you have to study a great many problems. A 
writer is free to write about anything, but he can avoid 
touching on a topic where his knowledge is poor. A political 
leader has to have knowledge in all spheres. You can't be a 
lathe operator one day and a party leader the next. He knows 
all about it now, he says: We will have a Russian republic, and 
that's that. We will have nothing. And this party, too, will 
soon cease to exist. But it is everybody's right to proclaim 
their own party and to believe that they are capable even of 
heading the government. There's nothing to be done. I greatly 
respect them. Viktor Ivanovich Korchagin, Barkashov, the writer 
Limonov, and a number of other figures are also trying to head 
political groupings. But it would be better for each person to 
mind his own business. Russia has very often been run by 
technical specialists. Almost all of them went to technical 
higher educational establishments. Some to agricultural 
institutes, some to trade institutes. But there have been 
almost no people in the country's leadership with an education 
in the humanities, still less a double one. And there have 
never been people in the leadership with a fluent knowledge of 
European languages and experience of foreign countries before 
they have come to power. There are even fewer people with a good 
knowledge of their own country. They would not have discovered 
it even if they had had 60 years. 
  Politics. You need to have a lot of free time for this. And 
a father with a lot of children will naturally be unable to go 
in for this because he has to devote all his emotional and 
physical efforts to his family. I have never been deeply in 
love with my wife. Our personal relationship has been OK, but 
we have not been head over heels in love. So I have been able 
to conserve my strength for politics. The same goes for my 
attitude toward my son. At one time during the earliest stages, 
I felt more affectionate toward him. But now that he is over 
20, all this has, in practice, become very moderate and 
extremely calm. So I have plenty of time, which is taken up by 
political activity. 
  I have to read a huge quantity of all sorts of newspapers, 
the programs of various parties, leaflets, proclamations, 
religious and philosophical literature, economic and historical 
literature, memoirs, and literature on geography and the most 
diverse fields of knowledge -- sociology, the armed forces, 
foreign countries, foreign parties. Twenty years ago I wrote a 
monograph entitled "Turkey's Political Parties." So I have been 
studying the systematization of parties for many years. I have 
given very long thought to the machinery of state power: What 
does it consist of? What are the components of the machinery of 
state power? How are society and the state administered? You 
cannot come to grips with this if yesterday you were a physicist 
in a laboratory or a biologist but today you are beginning to 
think about the state and about how to govern. This takes a 
decade, it takes a certain state intellect, part of your brain 
has to be tuned in to this. You have to train for decades, 
decades. You have to think about this, analyze, and compare. 
Stalin died, and there was the population's reaction to the 
death of Stalin. Then Khrushchev came along. They got rid of 
Khrushchev. Then Brezhnev was general secretary, then they 
removed Podgornyy. Then Kulakov died. Then Andropov appeared. 
Chernenko. Gorbachev. Yeltsin. I experienced, mulled over, 
and analyzed all these stages. And arrived at an understanding 
of the deep-seated processes of political life and state turning 
points. 
  I have a huge layer of political experience on the basis of 
practical life. You cannot get this from textbooks. You 
cannot, for instance, study the history of France, go there, and 
begin to engage in politics there. A journalist can go to some 
leader and interview him. But you can engage in practical 
political activity only in your own country, provided that you 
have accumulated a huge wealth of knowledge. So for me politics 
has not been something unknown and mysterious. I have always 
wanted to go in for this. Any narrow field depressed me. An 
orientalist studies only the East. A lawyer studies only the 
many branches of law. Only criminal law or only civil law -- 
that's boring. All in all, to be a lawyer is also very narrow. 
Or take economics. Nothing but taxes, circulating capital, 
money, immovable property -- all this is associated with a 
single narrow specialism. But the desire to embrace everything 
means that you develop a philosophical attitude toward life, you 
begin to understand what the theory of knowledge of life really 
is. I studied at an orientalist higher educational 
establishment, and I remember that in second or third year I 
wrote some course work for the philosophy department. 
Unfortunately, this was forbidden, you were supposed to write 
only for the department you were attached to. But I was drawn 
to philosophy, to broad knowledge of life and to the laws of 
dialectics, to understanding matter, spirit, and so forth. I 
might perhaps have studied at the faculty of political science, 
but at the time there was none. They had them in the Sorbonne 
and in London, but in our country you would have had to combine 
the faculties of history, philosophy, economics, and law, or our 
Institute of Asian and African Countries and a sociological 
institute. Then maybe out of six faculties you would produce a 
faculty of political science. But I had to study lots of 
unnecessary subjects. It would have been ideal if I could 
simply have graduated from the Moscow State University Faculty 
of Political Science. Then I could have gone into practical 
politics from the age of 23. But the conditions for this did 
not exist, there was no opportunity to acquire such an education 
straightaway, and it was impossible to immediately enter 
politics in view of the specific nature of the regime in our 
country before 1985. 
  That's not all. I simply did not want to go in for politics. 
I had already begun to develop my own geopolitical concept. I 
don't want to give it my name, the Zhirinovskiy formula, say, 
but the last "dash" to the south and Russia's outlet to the 
shores of the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea are really the 
task of saving the Russian nation. For when the other parties 
talk about cutting off Kazakhstan, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], and 
Central Asia, they do not realize that we are pushing Russian 
into the tundra, where mineral resources are all that can exist, 
where nothing can live and develop. The development of 
civilization has always begun in the south. People moved to the 
north because there were a great many of them, they had 
accumulated in the south, and movement developed in various 
directions, but people did not yet realize that they were 
leaving the best places. They left in a quest for food. And 
today we may quite unnecessarily drive ourselves into unviable 
regions and destroy the nation once and for all. 
  So the idea emerged of the last "dash" -- last because it 
will probably be the last repartition of the world and it must 
be carried out in a state of shock therapy, suddenly, swiftly, 
and effectively. This immediately solves all the problems, 
because we gain tranquility. We gain a four-zone platform. 
When we can rest on the Arctic Ocean in the north, the Pacific 
Ocean in the east, and the Atlantic via the Black, 
Mediterranean, and Baltic Seas, and, finally, when we can rest 
on the shores of the Indian Ocean in the south like a huge 
pillar, we will also gain tranquil neighbors. Friendly India. 
Enmity will cease forever. The quiet and tranquil 
Russian-Indian border. We will have to make the Russian-Chinese 
border like that too, and with the Japanese we have a maritime 
border. There is only sea there, and it must not be hostile. 
We have made ourselves secure [past tense as published] once 
and for all from the viewpoint of borders by creating a 
situation in which dismemberment or the removal of any parts is 
impossible because we will have abandoned the principle of 
ethnic division and the principle of division will be purely 
territorial inside the country -- guberniyas, oblasts, 
provinces, uezds, whatever you like. Without any ethnic tinge. 
The blending of peoples as a result of the economy, the 
dominance of the Russian language and the Russian ruble, and the 
dominant position of the Russian Army as the most 
combat-capable, this is a historical fact. We must ensure 
stability throughout our region for Russia and for the world 
community as a whole. This is historically natural, it is not 
an invention, not a fantasy. It is a reality. We stand on the 
south, but it is unstable, it is ablaze, it is in revolt. 
Because the tribes are again pressing from the rear. The 
Tajiks are under pressure from the Afghan tribes, the Turkmens 
from the Iranian tribes, North Azerbaijan from South Azerbaijan. 
Armenia is being squeezed by Azerbaijan from one direction. 
Georgia is being squeezed by Ossetia and Abkhazia. All this is 
unstable. They are all in a state of open warfare and 
hostility. And since these peoples have often fought, they now 
have a blood feud, they can no longer calm down, they will 
always fight. 
  But mankind cannot allow constant war in the south of 
Russia. 
In the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Near East. The world is 
tired of aircraft taking off, missiles being launched, things 
exploding. We must quiet things down in this spot on the globe. 
There was the mighty conflict in Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Laos. 
Cambodia.... Both the Americans and we were involved. And I 
said: This war will end eventually. But the war in the Near 
East will not end and may ultimately trigger World War III. So 
Russia's last "dash" to the south will also preclude World War 
III. It is not only the solution to Russia's internal problem 
and the pacification of the peoples of this region, from Kabul 
to Istanbul. It is also the resolution of a global task, of 
planetary significance. America too will have tranquillity 
because wars have ended in this region and there are no Red, or 
Muslim, or Turkic, or Islamic fundamentalist threats. Tasks of 
geopolitical significance will be resolved. 
  The last "dash" to the south. I dream of Russian soldiers 
washing their boots in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and 
switching to summer uniform forever. Lightweight boots, 
lightweight trousers, short-sleeved open-necked shirts with no 
tie, lightweight caps. And a small modern Russian assault rifle 
produced by the Izhevsk plant. These assault rifles are much 
better than UZI's. So any platoon of Russian soldiers can 
impose order anywhere. And, even better, so that there is no 
need for this. We must pacify this region forever. So that 
there are vacation centers, youth camps, sanatoriums, and 
preventive treatment centers there on the shores of the Indian 
Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Huge areas could be opened up for 
vacations. The whole south could become one big zone of 
sanatoriums and rest homes for the industrial north and for 
people of all nationalities. All. The single economy and 
single legal and political space would create favorable 
conditions for the development of all trades and for culture, 
education, life, and the family structure, as everyone wants. 
  Where there are compact Muslim populations, let them have 
their own customs and maybe even retain bigamy, let women there 
wear the veil, and let houses be divided into women's and men's 
halves. And some of the population will always live in the 
steppe, in the mountains, or in the desert; in tents, in 
mountain huts, in yurts [tents], leading a nomadic life. They 
will engage mainly in raising livestock. That is normal. And 
cities will develop. We don't want huge megalopolies. Let 
there be small towns where it is convenient to live. Let them 
all have water, sewerage, small plants and factories, the 
necessary infrastructure, transport, and communications. All 
this will become possible if we make this last "dash" to the 
south. We badly need this, it is medicine that we must take. 
  Medicine is not always sweet. Some people in Kabul, 
Tehran, and Ankara may not like this. But millions of people 
will feel better as a result. Take Tajikistan today, for 
instance -- it is all ablaze. There are gunmen all around, 
people are fleeing abroad, some people are refugees inside the 
country. People are starving and dying. Is this better than a 
mighty power that will prevent the emergence of strongarm 
solutions to any questions? Human lives must be saved. You 
cannot experience democracy when you are wallowing in blood, 
when there is robbing and killing, when 6-year-old girls are 
being raped. Children's souls are being traumatized, they are 
losing, perhaps forever, the desire to live, and they are 
already mentally scarred, special homes should already be being 
built for them, otherwise they will be unable to live, they will 
die. After all, not only are there killings, but mental scars 
are also being inflicted which make part of the population 
practically unable to function. A mine is being planted for the 
future. Huge sums of money will be required to treat the 
front-line population that has experienced the new war. The 
territory from Leselidze to Dushanbe is all covered in corpses. 
Sukhumi, Ochamchira, Nagorno-Karabakh, Fergana, Dushanbe. It 
is all covered in blood and corpses, entire families, entire 
peoples are being butchered. Uzbekistan decided to expel the 
Turks, just think, the Turks, what kind of a people are they? 
They threw out 30,000 in a few days. Now they will want to 
slaughter the Koreans, they will say: Why do we want Koreans 
here? This is Uzbekistan, this is no place for Koreans. It is 
terrible. 
  So we must ensure that in the future there are no conflicts 
costing the lives of millions of people. We fear natural 
disasters -- the earthquake in Spitak or the floods in India. 
Hurricanes sweep across America. But surely the elemental 
political forces artificially created by certain political 
forces which want to express themselves in this way are equally 
terrible? Radicals, both left and right, want to change things 
fundamentally, forgetting that you cannot abruptly change human 
nature. So any radical elements, any extremists spoil the 
situation. Hitler was an extremist, Bonaparte was an extremist, 
even Peter I was in some respects an extremist. Russia has 
mostly taken part in multilateral wars, won victories, and 
received territories and advantages for itself as compensation 
for taking part. But the fanaticism, radicalism, and extremism 
characteristic of certain historical figures have led to world 
cataclysms. So we need to mold a consciousness among people and 
create institutions of power precluding obscurantism, whereby an 
entire region is covered in blood. We must preclude situations 
where all issues are decided by force of arms. Whoever has more 
assault rifles and bullets gets power. And thereby passes 
judgment. But on whom? On his own citizens. So if you come 
from Kurgan-Tyube and you have more assault rifles, you will 
beat the people of Kulyab who have fewer rifles. What is this 
-- a children's game: Who has more stones? This is barbarism, 
it is monstrous. And this too is politics. 
  Disasters for Russia have always and will always come from 
the south. All corruption began in the south, when Stalin 
created favorable conditions for his native Georgia. This 
despot ruled Russia for 30 years. And during this time Georgia 
was perverted and infected with corruption, which spread to 
Armenia and Azerbaijan. Then this filth spread to the East, to 
Central Asia, and crept upward, and eventually enveloped the 
entire country. The rulers did not understand this after the 
death of Stalin. At least he had a definite aim. He paid due 
tribute to his own nationality. He realized that the whole 
country might have a bad time, but at least the Georgians would 
have a good time. After his death this trend persisted under 
Khrushchev. The denunciation of the personality cult aggrieved 
Georgians, so once again Georgia was given a let-off. It ended 
in the destruction of the entire country. Maybe Georgia was a 
country that should not have been admitted to the Russian 
empire. And today Turkey would be our neighbor. It would be 
much less troublesome for us to trade with Turkey than it is 
now, when there is this bleeding wound -- Georgia -- between us. 
Georgia is in our way. We need a different border. We should 
either emerge onto the shores of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, 
or cut the south off from us behind a "Great Wall of China." 
But in the latter case our trade ties with Iran and Turkey and 
with Afghanistan would deteriorate. This would make us poorer. 
We clearly cannot countenance this. So there is only one 
option. We must carry out this operation, code-named the "last 
dash to the south." 
  Our Army will perform this task. This will be a method of 
ensuring the survival of the nation as a whole, it will be the 
basis for the renaissance of the Russian Army. New armed forces 
can be reborn only as a result of a combat operation. The Army 
cannot grow stronger in military commissariats and barracks. It 
needs a goal, a task. Just as when there was the task of 
repelling the threat of German occupation, Red regiments and 
divisions emerged to combat the foreign invaders. That was how 
the strong Red Army arose. Today the Russian Army is bound to 
undergo a renaissance if it puts a stop to the gunmen in Central 
Asia, the Caucasus, and Moldavia [Moldova] and carries out an 
operation to establish new Russian borders in the southern 
salient. All this provides a stimulus for the development of 
the economy, transport, and communications and for obtaining raw 
materials for food and light industry, cheap manpower, the 
opportunity to construct new main railroads -- in Delhi, Tehran, 
and Baghdad -- new air routes and highways. We need to restore 
the great silk road from China and India to Europe. It will 
pass through Russia, and Russia will grow rich. Our plants will 
always have enough manpower in the north and in Siberia because 
the population will migrate from south to north in a quest for 
work. Unfortunately, some of the population will die because 
the south does not currently have sufficient medicines and a 
sufficient level of culture. So natural survival, assimilation, 
and adaptation will take place. This is a natural process. But 
the economy will become healthy because the industrial north 
will supply all the necessary products for the south, and food 
and light industry will traditionally develop in the south. 
This kind of exchange of products, this kind of sensible 
combination will make it possible for everybody to lead 
confident and secure lives. 
  Last "Dash" to the South.... 
  There was Bonaparte's march across the whole of Europe to 
Russia, there was the march of Charles XII at the head of 
Swedish forces far to the south, down to the Black Sea, there 
was Hitler's march far to the east. And now there is the 
attempt by the Americans to influence all regions of the world 
-- in Japan, the Philippines, Panama, Africa, and Greece. So 
far the Americans have managed to dominate all over the planet. 
But the idea of world domination is fallacious. Regional 
cooperation is better. The division of spheres of influence is 
better; according to the north-south principle. If we intersect 
again, we will again be in one another's way. We must reach 
agreement, and let it be a world treaty to the effect that we 
divide up the whole planet and spheres of economic influence and 
operate in the north-south direction. The Japanese and Chinese 
can go south into Southeast Asia, the Philippines, Indonesia, 
and Australia. Russian can go south into Afghanistan, Iran, and 
Turkey. West Europe can go south into the African continent. 
Finally, Canada and the United States can go south -- the whole 
of Latin America. This is all on equal terms. No one has any 
advantages here. The direction is the same -- southward. The 
territories are contiguous. Vietnam and Malaysia are much 
closer to Japan and China than to us. Or, Afghanistan, Iran, 
and Turkey directly adjoin Russia, not France and Britain. The 
African continent borders Europe across the Mediterranean. And 
Latin America forms practically a single whole with the United 
States. 
  So allocation according to this geopolitical formula would 
be 
very favorable for all mankind. Warm, clear weather would be 
established over the entire planet. Cloudless weather, without 
hurricanes and storms. There would be less expenditure on 
energy, transportation, and communications. After all, the 
Japanese, for instance, ship their goods virtually all over the 
planet, and they could reduce these shipments by opening up our 
Far East and looking to China, Australia, and the Philippines. 
We would concentrate our economic ties mainly on Afghanistan, 
Iran, and Turkey for as long as these countries exist and are 
not drawn into Russia's orbit, becoming a component part of the 
Russian state. And Europe would trade successfully with Africa. 
Especially as France and Britain have colonies there and old 
connections. Both world order in general and economic order -- 
via external ties -- would be established. We would also save 
the planet environmentally. There would be fewer aircraft 
flying around. After all, they now fly from Istambul to Africa, 
but they could fly mostly here, to the north, and get what they 
need here. The number of regions would decrease. And fewer 
aircraft would fly from Russia to take goods to Africa. The 
refocusing of contacts and ties on the nearby region, on 
neighbors, would be cheaper and would require less energy. We 
would make it easier for people to exist on the planet. 
  And there would be no need to scatter the army. The 
Russian Army was in Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Cuba, 
Nicaragua, and Vietnam. But this is pointless, it is too far 
away, it is too expensive. Our Army would be only on Russia's 
territory, on the shore of the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean 
Sea -- no further afield. Further down there is friendly Iraq. 
So everything would be reduced, space would be freed up, and 
the energy needed for the production of food and medicines and 
for leisure would be released. There would be fewer military 
bases because confrontation would decrease. What would be the 
point of America ringing Russia with bases or in our submarines 
sailing around Hudson Bay off American shores? It is more 
advantageous for us to concentrate our efforts here in the 
south. The Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean Sea -- everything 
immediately around Russia. And everybody else would act in a 
similar way. Looking a bit closer at hand, closer to home. 
  For instance, I have lived all over the country. But if I 
had lived in just one city, in Alma-Ata, I would have saved 
money. I would have a little orchard, I would have an apartment 
and acquaintances. But I have traveled all over the country, I 
have had to start over, I have expended tremendous effort, 
energy, and resources! So if we stayed put and acted locally, 
in the area around us and near to us, we would have better 
living conditions. All peoples seek this. So the idea of the 
last "dash" to the south is noble, it entails only positive 
consequences. However, despite everything, this is a method of 
treatment, and it is possible that someone may have a negative 
reaction. But this is a solution of world problems, and not 
everyone can be happy. 
  Today America is blockading Iraq, Libya, and Serbia. Are the 
peoples of these countries happy? But America believes it is 
acting correctly. And if we blockade Afghanistan, Iran, and 
Turkey, maybe some residents of these countries will be unhappy. 
But the world world must believe that if Russia has to do this, 
this is fine. You have to proceed from the will of the 
majority. It is to the advantage of the majority of mankind for 
the Muslim world to be cut up [rassechen]. The Muslim danger 
must be prevented. Other religions are incapable of leading to 
religious wars today. The Turkic-speaking world must be cut up. 
For only there is the task set of creating a Turkic state -- 
from Istanbul to Altay. Other countries have no such impulses 
to create a greater Ireland, a greater Nigeria, a greater 
Panama. Finally, Russia's southern borders are troubled, they 
perturb both Russia itself and the whole of Europe. From all 
viewpoints the last "dash" to the south, the Russian Army's 
campaign culminating in an outlet to the shores of the Indian 
Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, spells freedom for 20 million Kurds 
and hundreds of thousands of Baluchis, Pushtuns, Daris, and 
representatives of other peoples inhabiting the region. It 
means precluding the possibility of war between Iran and Iraq, 
between Iran and Turkey, between Afghanistan and Tajikistan, and 
between Pakistan and India. The hundreds of millions of people 
inhabiting this region will be able to avoid the bitter fate of 
refugees. Finally, we will prevent thermonuclear war, 
explosions at nuclear stations, and the mass extermination of 
people. And the death of huge numbers of people as a result of 
various epidemics spread all over the country at present. The 
pros of carrying out this operation considerably outweigh the 
cons which may naturally be perceived. And the Russian Army 
also needs this so that our guys can flex their muscle, tired as 
they are of "hazing," instead of sitting around in barracks, in 
the depths of Russia, waiting for the end of their term of 
service, not knowing where the enemy is, who the adversary is, 
or what they need to prepare themselves morally and physically 
for. This would be a cleansing for us all. And the peal of 
bells in Russian Orthodox churches on the shore of the Indian 
Ocean and Mediterranean Sea would proclaim peace to the region's 
peoples, fraternity to the peoples, prosperity, affluence, 
tranquillity, and an end to any military conflicts and 
interethnic clashes. It would be good for us all, because 
everybody would gain. The only one who might not like this is 
America, but it will not interfere. The other scenario for the 
development of events is too serious for it if it intervenes, 
there will be too many negative consequences if it impedes the 
establishment of Russia's southern borders. 
  Russia will only do what is foreordained and will fulfill 
the 
great historical mission -- liberate the world from wars, which 
always begin in the south. And this operation -- the last 
"dash" to the south -- is not the Barbarossa plan [Hitler's plan 
for the invasion of Russia], not Napoleon's plans, not the 
military ventures of Swedish King Charles XII. It is a purely 
Russian variant, it has been elaborated by Russia's very fate, 
otherwise Russia will be unable to develop and will perish and 
we will be crammed with nuclear stations and nuclear weapons 
which will eventually blow up and destroy the whole planet. We 
cannot allow this to happen. So everybody must agree that 
Russia must inevitably establish its own borders in a new 
region, and let Tajiks, Turkmens, and Uzbeks live freely there. 
But there must be no national entities there. 
  At one time in Central Asia, just 60 or 70 years ago, there 
was just Khiva, Urgench, Khorezm, Fergana, and Tashkent. There 
was no Uzbek SSR. The "children of different peoples" lived in 
these city-republics or city-khanates. And today let there 
again be a multitude of cities -- Bukhara, Khorezm, Tashkent, 
Urgench, Kabul, Dushanbe, Pyandzh, Pamir, Tehran, Tabriz. 
Different city-republics. Territorial units. Kurdistan with 
its capital in Diyarbakir, Armenia will restore its borders. 
The western borders of Armenia will debouch onto the shore of 
the Black Sea. Georgia will get the little bit of the Black Sea 
south of Batumi in order to compensate for its losses in 
Abkhazia. They will all get what they want. Okay, they will be 
a bit unhappy in Ankara. Okay, some people will be unhappy in 
Tehran and Kabul. But millions of people and the entire planet 
will receive a positive solution. Ultimately the Turks came to 
Istanbul from somewhere near Tashkent, and Tashkent remains a 
city to which they can return, it is their birthplace. Or they 
can stay where they are currently living. But the Kurds, 
Armenians, Baluchis, and hundreds of other peoples must not be 
oppressed. And how many Greeks, Bulgarians, and other Slavs are 
there in Istanbul? Why do they have to conceal their 
nationality? Why can't they use their own language? This will 
be a multilingual world. But of course from Constantinople to 
Kabul it will choose one language for communication, as they 
have done in the city of Sukhumi. There they have chosen not 
Georgian, not Abkhazian, not Greek, not Armenian, but the 
Russian language. It is easier for them all to speak Russian 
than to learn five languages. And throughout this new space 
extending to the shore of the Indian Ocean everybody will speak 
Russian. Dozens of different peoples of different religions, 
Turkic-speakers and Farsi-speakers, Slavs and Greeks, Kurds and 
Arabs. This will be a common motherland for all. But a 
motherland without wars, because the borders will be secure. 
The Indian Ocean, and further north the limitless expanses of 
Russia. And Russian Army garrisons, like beacons warning of the 
danger of resorting to arms. All questions will be resolved 
only by peaceful means. Everyone will do what they like. And 
pursue the way of life that is closest to them. 
  If we do not pacify [uspokoit] this region, disturbances, 
corruption, disease, and war will rise higher and engulf the 
whole of Russia. And then we will have the situation where 
someone had to cut off a finger to avoid gangrene, but refused 
to do so. And then he died because the gangrene affected his 
entire body. It's the same in the history of mankind. Maybe 
the rights of a small group of citizens have to be infringed, 
but even they fully retain both their lives and their way of 
life. And tranquility is established for millions of people and 
the danger that they will be exterminated or hurt in any way is 
precluded. You cannot govern by waving chocolate bars in 
the face of your subjects. Or only by brandishing a whip. 
  The main problem remains the nationalities problem. How can 
envy and competition between nations be allayed? How can 
everyone be made to realize that we are citizens. Citizens. 
Not Turks, not Persians, not Tajiks -- we are citizens. This 
is my home, I live here, I work here, my family is here. And I 
must not go and rob the house next door, kill the children in 
someone else's family, and have the right to rape anyone or 
engage in looting -- all this must be prohibited everywhere. No 
violence. But we will establish correct borders, we will create 
a stabilizing factor. It is like religion. After all, 
believers know you have the Russian Orthodox Church. You have 
the patriarch of all Russia. You have the supreme synod of the 
Russian church. You have the major cathedrals in Moscow. But 
what if none of this existed? Just crosses and bells would not 
attract this huge mass of Orthodox believers. It the same with 
the nationalities question. There has to be a mighty state 
around, and within the framework of this mighty state 
representatives of different nations and nationalities have to 
be afraid of each other and not even think of attacking each 
other. 
  Clashes between peoples must not be provoked. Take the 
events of February 1988 in Sumgait. Was this a natural action? 
For no apparent reason, all of a sudden students from a 
vocational and technical school get drunk, get some sticks, and 
go off to kill Armenians in the city? This was a considered 
action. Certain forces in the Transcaucasus had to create a 
seat of injustice. Communist ideology had been abandoned, and 
they wanted to replace it with a national ideology. But how 
could this be done if everybody took a calm, normal view of each 
other. How? Make the Azerbaijanis hate the Armenians. You 
have to create conflict. You have to create a small war. And 
they did this in Sumgait. There was carnage. People were 
burned alive. That is terrible. The same happened in Baku as 
well. An eyewitness from Baku told me how an old Armenian man 
was caught at the station and burned alive right there on the 
station square. And people helped do it. One old lady brought 
a mattress to make it easier to burn him, someone brought wood, 
branches, matches, and gasoline. They helped drag the old man 
there. They threw him on the heap, set fire to it, and stood 
there. People! At the end of the 20th century! They burned 
someone alive for being of a different nationality! It is 
monstrous. Can such things be allowed to happen? And all this 
is in order to revive a national ideology. To make Azerbaijanis 
hate Armenians. They are Azerbaijanis. There is an enemy -- 
the Armenians. The enemy must be fought. People must put up 
with these temporary difficulties, but defeat the enemy -- the 
Armenians. And then we will live happily ever after. It was on 
the basis of that formula that clashes began throughout the 
country. They found a "scapegoat" in Uzbekistan -- Meskhetian 
Turks. Uzbeks and Kirghiz clashed in the Osh valley of 
Kirghizia. Tajiks and Uzbeks clashed somewhere else. In this 
way it is possible to cause clashes between peoples throughout 
our country. Abkhazians and Georgians, Ingush and Ossetians, 
Kabardinians, Cherkessians, Adygeans -- hundreds of peoples. It 
is possible to provoke a fratricidal war that will be perpetual. 
War will go on forever. How easy it is to kill today.... 
  I have often returned to my childhood and youth, to the 
period of my army service, and to my friends. I have not been 
able to cover the entire period of my childhood. There were 
instances when I was insulted because I was not a physically 
strong boy, there are also some good memories, childish 
friendship in a Young Pioneer camp, for instance. I did 
excellently at university, I had certificates for participation 
in social work. I also had a certificate for taking part in 
preparing the Congress of Peaceloving Forces and taking part in 
preparing the World Festival of Youth. I was debarred from some 
things, I had no state awards, of course, I had no significant 
academic works either, or academic degree. Although after my 
first higher educational establishment, after graduating from 
the Institute of Asian and African Countries, which earlier was 
called the Institute of Oriental Languages, I was offered around 
five postgraduate opportunities. In both philology and 
philosophy -- I could have gone further in this direction. But 
I did not feel particularly drawn to science. You needed 
application, you needed to do a lot of work with literature. I 
was more attracted to the life that was really going on today -- 
outside the window of the building where I was, or outside the 
window of the trolleybus in which I was traveling. The living 
and the contemporary were what attracted me. And I wanted to 
deal with this. And with the same kind of politics -- real, 
living politics. This is why I took pleasure in creating a new 
political party and began to work vigorously in it. Many people 
were prepared to do the same, but this requires great efforts. 
After all, ultimately you have to quit your job. And if 
someone has a job they love, they find this difficult. The 
option I took was that at this time I was doing a job I 
disliked, and then I switched to doing something I loved, namely 
creating a political party and taking part in its work. 
  The most important thing is the opportunity not only to 
speak 
out, but also to attempt to propagandize your ideas. The most 
important thing is pluralism in everything. I would put it in a 
nutshell as follows. Pluralism in democracy, in resolving the 
nationalities question, and in the concept of ownership, the 
state, and the raising of children -- a multiplicity of views in 
everything. There cannot be a single line -- for instance, all 
children are educated in boarding schools, or everybody works in 
plants, or everybody serves in the army, or everybody studies 
Marxism. This totalitarian attitude is what I was sick of. But 
at the same time I am an advocate of tough measures in certain 
situations -- involving crime and attempts to dismember the 
state, smash the economy, and destroy certain structures. So 
there is a need to make a distinction: between being an 
advocate of a totalitarian regime or being an advocate of a 
democratic free regime under which some tough measures may be 
applied. For instance, this is simply essential today. 
Tajikistan. They are killing people at every corner. How can 
the violence be stopped by democratic means? Clearly, there is 
a need to apply strong-arm measures here. Thus in creating a 
party I can express my ideas and attempt to ensure that these 
ideas are understood and taken to heart by many citizens in our 
country and to find as many supporters as possible. 
  The path to victory is the implementation of ideas via the 
victory of the party and its leader. This is all 
interconnected. Because your program can be finally really 
implemented when you have the opportunity to put it into effect, 
if the political force in question controls the levers of state. 
When you are in opposition you can express ideas as much as you 
like, but there is little likelihood that they will be put into 
effect unless you come to power. Although it is possible for 
the opposition to have a positive influence on ruling structures 
in the sense that a ruling party can borrow all its ideas from 
certain elements of them and put them into effect. So the role 
of an opposition party can have positive consequences all the 
same. So despite everything the very system of political 
parties means that the universal positive desire for prosperity 
finds a niche. 
  There are many parties in Russia today, over 40, and many 
social movements and groups. These parties and movements 
emerge, disintegrate, and join various alliances and coalitions 
-- this is a perfectly normal process. Although ultimately, of 
course, five or six leading parties will be left. But now there 
are a great many people who want to express themselves somehow. 
They are like hungry people. After all, a hungry person will 
fall upon any food. He wants more and more, as fast as 
possible. It's the same in political life. Under the one-party 
system everyone who did not join the CPSU experienced a sense of 
political hunger. They were totally cut off from political 
life. This is the trouble with the one-party system. The point 
is not just that communists formed the basis of the one-party 
system. In itself a one-party system is unviable. In those 
circumstances in general there is no need for any party, since 
there are no competitors and there is no opportunity for various 
political forces to take part in elections. 
  The one-party system exists as cover for dictatorship by a 
force in power, for there is a need to maintain an apparatus at 
local level that can be used somehow to influence the masses. 
That is why there is a need for a party. Clearly, this is 
necessary at a certain historical stage. But this was a 
one-party regime not in purely state interests, for the benefit 
of Russia as such -- it also had an ideological complexion. 
There was the idea of building communism, and also its spread 
beyond the country. This was the communists' second mistake. 
Okay, have a one-party regime only in our country and try to 
build communism, but what was the point in going further? 
Because if all the aid that was given to foreign countries had 
been left in the USSR, we would have been a very rich, highly 
developed, cultured country even under the one-party regime. 
Because even with all the flaws we have tremendous 
achievements. What if we had not had these flaws? The 
one-party regime is flawed in itself because there is no 
competition between ideas, competition between positions. They 
decided to implement the idea of communism here -- both here and 
abroad. All the efforts and resources were expended on this. 
In any case, you need a multiparty regime to ensure that there 
are no protracted experiments. If a party comes to power and 
for five years tries to squander resources, distributing them 
all over the world, it will lose the next elections, and this 
experiment will end. So, for all the pros and cons of both a 
one-party and a multiparty regime, the latter nevertheless comes 
out on top. Pluralism is better. It's better when there is a 
choice. 
  Here is a simple illustration from personal life. Imagine 
you get married at 25 and have no right ever to form any 
relationship with a woman. That you have got that woman for all 
time, until death do you part. Well, that's fine if there is 
deep, pure honest love on both sides. But what if there isn't? 
What if it has run dry? What if it was one-sided? What then? 
Are you supposed to lay down your life for the sake of the idea 
of just one marriage, just one woman? In reality this does not 
happen. In reality the overwhelming majority of men and women 
have several sexual partners in a lifetime. Even if they have 
only one marriage. It's the same in politics, only more so. 
It is undesirable to tie everybody to one party, to one 
idea, to one blueprint. That is deadening. Meanwhile, a 
multitude of ideas makes the country more luxuriant, like a 
bouquet of flowers. After all, a bouquet always looks brighter, 
more elegant, and more attractive than a single flower. 
Like an orchard. An orchard is beautiful when it contains 
different kinds of trees. Or take a birch forest -- you have to 
admit, it's tedious. Nothing but birches and birches, all those 
white trunks.... It's more attractive when you have mixed 
woodland. And when you have mixed weather too. Just imagine 
constant heat, with a temperature of 35-40 degrees. This 
exhausts and destroys people. Because you need spring, you need 
fall, rain, wind, chilly weather, overcast weather, sunshine -- 
all sorts. People need choice and a varied life in varied 
forms. It's just like a man's life. You have childhood, then 
the teenage years, youth, maturity, more advanced years, old 
age, and finally decrepitude and departure from life. Man 
experiences all this, he has 10 years of adolescence and 10 
years of youth. And each decade offers certain joys and some 
knowledge of life, offers its own methods of expression. All 
this has to exist in political life too. So that man can be 
free. 
  But in political life itself it is desirable to stick to one 
idea. It is good for this to be a family tradition -- voting 
for a political party. For instance, the entire family -- the 
grandfather, his son, his grandson -- they have always been 
supporters of the Liberal Democratic Party. And they 
traditionally vote for the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia]. Another family supports the Social Democratic Party. 
A third is tied to the Christian Democrats, a fourth to the 
Constitutional Democrats, a fifth to the monarchists, and a 
sixth to some left-wing forces. It would be good if there was 
political education along with general education within the 
family itself. In this sphere too tastes can be established in 
childhood, when from infancy people see that their father is 
attached to a party, see that he constantly votes for that party 
and attends its events. And maybe is even a member of the 
party. This is a good tendency -- being a supporter of a single 
party -- but this all takes place within the context of a 
multiparty system, it's only when there are other parties that 
you can compare and rejoice at your party's victory. It's the 
same in sport -- there are lots of teams, but from an early age 
a youth may support "Spartak," for instance. He always supports 
this team, he likes it. Whether it loses or wins, he knows this 
team, its coach, and its players and follows its games. This is 
also an element in social life. Political life is part of our 
social life, here too people have their own tastes, their own 
views, their own habits. So there is a need for pluralism. 
There is a need for a multiparty system. 
  Just imagine that "Spartak" was the only team in sport. 
And everybody supported "Spartak." Nobody would support it, 
because they pick one sports team out of different ones, on the 
soccer field during matches they choose a powerful team or a 
classier one that plays more skillfully. But if there was just 
one team, it would simply have nobody to play. It simply would 
not exist, that team. What is the point of supporting "Spartak" 
if there are no matches? No soccer cup, no championship, no 
wins and losses, just the name: "Spartak." And its coach. 
Like the CPSU general secretary. He's the only one for 20 
years, and there will be no changes until he dies. So there 
always has to be pluralism. It is also necessary in personal 
life. In all spheres. But at the same time you need a certain 
focus and commitment to a single idea. A man may have an 
amorous nature, but you cannot get married every year because, 
clearly, society would not entirely understand this. But the 
Muslims' polygamy, which people sometimes take an ironical, 
skeptical view of, also has its good points. This could be a 
policy for solving the problem of prostitution, a way of 
combating loneliness, and a way of ensuring that all children 
have a father. And also a remedy against poverty because a 
Muslim with three or four wives tries to support them all and to 
maintain his family honor. This family is like a small tribe, a 
small clan, it has a big house and the children play. Everyone 
looks after each other. This too has its plus points. So you 
cannot reject everything. This too is a form of pluralism. And 
in some places, in northern Europe, say, marriages between men 
are permitted. These are two polar aspects of pluralism. Both 
may evoke hostility from the average European: polygamy among 
the Muslims and officially sanctioned marriage between men in 
Nordic Europe -- Britain, Sweden, Canada. But this is 
universal, planetary pluralism. 
  All peoples are made for particular forms of relations. In 
the Transcaucasus and in the East people, men included, kiss 
when they meet. In Russia for some reason it is not customary 
for two young men to go up to one another and kiss. But in 
Yerevan, Tbilisi, and Baku it is the norm. These are probably 
different manifestations of human relations and different forms 
of them. This too is pluralism. Although some customs and 
traditions may evoke misunderstanding. It's the same in 
politics -- in some places political opponents are killed, their 
cars are blown up, there are explosions in parliaments, 
terrorist acts are committed. And in some places the struggle 
proceeds calmly, the different positions of different parties 
are upheld in the most cultured of expressions, there is no 
malice, no violence in relations, there are no calls to stifle 
the opposition -- take France, the Netherlands, or Denmark. 
Pluralism is very widely developed in all spheres of human 
relations. 
  Of course, every party is to some extent reminiscent of a 
kind of political mafia gang, because it has a leader and it has 
certain internal laws. Sometimes there are people in the party 
leadership who are not always honest or scrupulous, not always 
noble, not always patriots, people who use power solely to get 
rich. Of course, there is a danger that in a given party people 
with base interests could seize the leadership, and that party 
could become the ruling party and gain the opportunity to put 
its base objectives into practice. Take the history of the 
Latin American countries, or again, Germany, Hitler and his 
party. The idea did not look as bad as all that -- the National 
Socialist Party of Germany. What is wrong with that? A 
socialist workers party. National, because it is for Germany's 
rebirth. But Hitler's ideology meant the party drifted, in the 
end, toward the extreme right sector -- the brown sector of 
political life. This led to violence. Yet at the first stage 
everything was relatively calm. Well, maybe the forms of 
combating opponents within the party and other rivals were too 
drastic. But ultimately the party turned into a repressive 
apparatus for the whole country. It rejected all opposition, 
and in effect stifled it. The leader's personal qualities 
played a part in this. Conversely, in France it was thanks to 
his personal qualities that Bonaparte was able for a prolonged 
period to make the French Army invincible, and that was possible 
specifically because of his personality. The same with the 
Russian Army. For instance, Bagration or the other generals 
could not have fulfilled Kutuzov's [Russian field marshal during 
Napoleanic war] role. Suvorov [18th century Russian field 
marshal], at one time, played a significant role. Personality 
always plays a role in history -- both highly positive and 
highly negative. Peter I. A great czar, big reforms. But the 
city of Petersburg is built, in effect, on the bones of peasant 
serfs. How many of them died that this palace city might arise 
amid the marshes? It is a palace today, but what was there 300 
years ago? And how was it built? The Baykal-Amur Railroad was 
built by prisoners and soldiers. Who now remembers 1974, 1975, 
1979? And how many people fled from there, how many accidents 
occurred? How many people's lives were ruined? 
  The role of personality and particular events are usually 
assessed more positively or, conversely, more negatively with 
the passage of time. Everyone applauded Stalin while he was 
alive. But now many people are repelled by what they have 
learned about those events. When Czar Nicholas [II] renounced 
the throne, Petersburg rejoiced. Everyone -- courtiers, 
workers, landowners, ministers, leaders of all parties -- 
everyone rejoiced. The end of the monarchy, the end of the 
autocracy! But 70 years have passed, and today monarchist 
parties are springing up in our country, today we are prepared 
to consider that the monarchy was a good thing for Russia. But 
back then, in February 1917, everyone greeted the czar's 
abdication with delight. Because they felt that the regime was 
rotten, that the czar could no longer govern, had been unable to 
govern for some years already. And his entourage could do 
nothing, either. I am sure that Mikhail, his brother, also 
would not have been able to rule for long. 
  Sometimes we return to certain events and try to assess them 
in a new way. But they should be assessed as they were at the 
time they happened. In February 1917 the czar renounced the 
throne virtually voluntarily, and the people received this 
positively, they did not take to the streets chanting the slogan 
"Restore the autocracy!" -- on the contrary, they rejoiced, they 
saw it as a revolution -- a peaceful, quiet revolution, a way of 
aligning themselves with the states of Europe that had also 
renounced their monarchies. It was a festival for Russia. But 
time passed, and now we think it was more or less a tragedy. 
History marches on, it cannot be deflected or turned back, you 
cannot keep reassessing things. It must be realized that, 
clearly, there are two ways of assessing every phenomenon. Czar 
Peter I was great by virtue of his victories, but there were 
also many sacrifices on the altar of those victories. Because 
the too rapid Europeanization of Russia had not only positive, 
but also negative consequences. The destruction of the 
traditions of the patriarchal Russian family -- that too had 
negative consequences. Drunkenness and absenteeism certainly 
date from those days, from Peter's time. And smoking, and other 
features of European life. So, in addition to civilization, 
Europe also brought to Russia a corrupting element. Say under 
Stalin's regime we were a closed country. That was also 
positive to some extent. For instance, with respect to the fact 
that we were almost completely free of venereal diseases. And 
morality in general was at a high level. I was at school from 
1953 to 1964, and all the girls in our class were virgins. And 
if any girl happened to give us reason to think that she had 
already embarked on a sex life, this was seen in very negative 
terms. At the age of 17 or 18 we guys were pure, with a 
well-balanced mentality, we did not have a drug addiction. We 
did not sniff anything, and as for alcohol, just a little, at 
home with our parents, on festive days. And nobody made any 
comments to us about whether we drank a lot or a little, it did 
not even enter our heads. Even the word "restaurant" was 
considered not quite nice, and people who went to such places 
were certainly seen as people with extremely bad characters. Of 
course, this was a provincial outlook, but there was a positive 
side to it. After all, in the majority of cases young people 
got married and the girl was a virgin. The young man, her 
husband, was her first man, and a marriage like that is 
stronger, it is a better foundation for future family life. 
  Every time has its pluses and minuses. And we should be 
conservatives, we should preserve what is good. There was 
something good in czarist Russia. There were merchants, there 
were courtiers, workers, civil servants, the police, the 
gendarmerie, the army. The territorial division, the insurance 
system, the system of medical services. All this should have 
been perfected. But we stopped it all, all that we could, we 
destroyed it and started again from zero. You should never 
start again from zero! Just imagine you have a family but no 
home, nothing, so you go out into the fields and start from 
zero. You will die. How can you build a house, where will you 
work, how will you live? Yet when it comes to the state, we 
have permitted ourselves, several times this century, to raze 
everything to the ground and start again from zero. On with the 
market economy! What is wrong with the administrative economy? 
It has drawbacks, but why destroy it? A huge number of plants 
and kolkhozes are working and producing output which we all 
need. So let us create different legal conditions for work. 
Let us give them the maximum degree of autonomy. Let us use 
the lease system as much as possible. But why destroy? That is 
a pernicious policy. But it happens, because the Mensheviks are 
in power. In 1917 the Bolsheviks came to power, in 1991 the 
Mensheviks -- they are all part of one and the same political 
party. The RSDRP [Russian Social Democratic Workers Party], or 
VKPb [All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)], or RKPb [Russian 
Communist Party (Bolsheviks)], or RCP [Russian Communist Party], 
or CPSU. But it is still the same communist party. So the 
power factor continues. This should not happen! Maybe Russia's 
characteristic economic structure is one where the state sector 
accounts for 70-80 percent. Our private sector will be only 20 
percent. Why not proceed on that basis, why do we have to 
destroy the entire state sector, say "on with privatization!" 
and let us have only private ownership? We swing from one 
extreme to the other, for the umpteenth time in the 20th century. 
  Russia's golden age was the 19th century. Everything 
proceeded gradually. The Decembrists acted -- it did not work 
out; they went. Some of them were exiled to Siberia, some were 
executed. That is to say, a process was going on. In time 
serfdom was abolished, but this reform had not reached its 
conclusion when new reformers came along -- Alexander II, and 
then Witte and Stolypin. Russia was slowly gathering speed. By 
1913 we had achieved "4" for everything, in Europe-wide and even 
worldwide terms. Why do we destroy that "4"? We go "back to 
zero," and have difficulty rising as high as a "3." Why, when 
by 1940 we could have turned our "4" into a "4 plus"? But by 
1940 we were barely achieving "3 minus." Now, by 1991 we had "4 
minus" again. So let us achieve a "4," and, by the beginning of 
the century, "4 plus." But no -- we go back to the "zero 
option" and now we have "2 plus." Why does all this happen?! 
It is not only the economy that is ruined -- people are dying, 
all the time people are dying. A covert civil war is in 
progress, and in some regions it has become open. Like a 
disease. There are hidden forms, but the disease is still a 
disease. It saps the living organism. So it is with a covert 
civil war. In Tajikistan, in the Caucasus, it is open. In the 
Baltic region and Ukraine it is in its covert form. But it is 
happening, this civil war! It is destroying us from within. 
This is more dangerous. The war in Tajikistan now may actually 
be less dangerous. It will end, such wars end quickly. The 
acute form of the disease can be treated more easily and 
diagnosed more quickly, a favorable outcome is more likely. The 
covert form is like a fire. Something is burning somewhere, 
smoke is coming from underground, but we cannot find it. Like 
in a mine. The shale burns, or the coal -- it burns for years, 
and then it all comes out onto the surface, bursts out, and half 
a city is destroyed instantly. It is easier to put out a 
burning house, even if it is a very dangerous fire. 
  We need pluralism, we need openness, calm. Our Motherland 
must no longer be tormented, she is tired, we have worn her out 
with these name changes. The artificial name USSR, the still 
more artificial CIS. The state has its own name -- Russia. 
This is a historical name, it is a geographical concept. It 
does not by any means denote a state for Russians. It is the 
Eurasian continent. It is 22 million square kilometers. It is 
the Arctic Ocean which washes our northern borders; it is the 
Pacific Ocean in the Far East. It is the Atlantic, via the 
Black and Baltic Seas. And in the future the Indian Ocean, when 
we have accomplished our final "southern dash." 
  The state's own name is better than an artificial title. The 
land cannot be divided. National borders cannot be drawn in a 
state which existed 1,000 years ago. Just try and divide France 
once again into Gaul, Brittany, etc. Or let us divide Spain 
once again into the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Spain proper. 
After all, anything could be divided. Italy into Sicily and 
Northern Italy. Let us separate Corsica from France, let us 
take away its overseas territories. Let us divide up the whole 
world -- borders and customs posts. Does mankind really want 
this? We should calm down, we should realize: Only a single 
state, with the name of Russia, can exist. But without 
suppressing other ideas or particular population groups, without 
any kind of political diktat, without a monopoly in the economy 
or in culture. Pluralism, multiplicity in everything, diversity 
in everything. 
  Not everyone understands the word "pluralism," so it is 
better to use Russian words. Diversity instead of "pluralism." 
"Free prices" instead of "price liberalization." We have the 
words "private ownership." "Privatization" -- all it means is 
going over to private ownership. Why should we use so many 
foreign words? We have our own words. The dismantling of state 
ownership, that is, the switch to personal ownership, private 
ownership, ownership by the labor collective, etc. Or take 
"vouchers." Why do we need a grating foreign word? We could 
call them "checks" or "coupon for the purchase of ownership 
rights," or find some other name that might be shorter. Less of 
these foreign words. Of course, foreign words cannot be 
entirely avoided. There should be a single language that unites 
us. Esperanto is needed as a separate language, not in the form 
of the penetration of our own language by foreign words, so that 
it becomes virtually unrecognizable. Children now have to be 
given explanations, told what this or that non-Russian word 
means, while old people fail to understand whole sentences and 
words in television and radio broadcasts. 
  So politics is part of our life, and we encounter it every 
day. If a new person appears in this world, he is born in a 
maternity home, and the state looks after the new generation. 
Or an old man dies -- the cemetery or the morgue is one last 
contact with the state. A birth certificate is a state 
document, a death certificate is also a state document. Between 
these two documents, there are links with the state everywhere. 
You go to school -- you become part of the education system. 
You get married -- again, contact with a state institution. 
Even if it is a church wedding. Because the institution of the 
church exists within society, and society exists within the 
framework of some kind of state. For instance, ours is the 
Orthodox Church, not Lutheran or Protestant. Again, this has to 
do with the state in which we live. Our labor activity. 
"State-employer" relations. There are private enterprises, but 
one way or another everything is linked to the state. 
Insurance, for instance. Pensions -- again, state involvement. 
And so it is for every step we take. Traffic inspector, 
doctor, teacher, notary, apartment block manager, fitter, cab 
driver, pedestrian crossing, park, bar, bathhouse, train, 
customs house, border guards, plane. However hard we try to 
find a place to hide, we are always linked to the state 
institution in the society in which we live. 
  A tribe at the earliest stage of mankind's development did 
not have a state. Nature, the cave, an animal skin, a fire. 
People were part of nature. But at today's stage in mankind's 
development we constantly have cells of some kind that are 
connected with the structure of a given state system. And the 
regulation of relations is carried out, for the most part, 
through political parties. That is what mankind has devised. 
These are groups of people who adhere to a particular system of 
views on the state system. And sometimes they have very similar 
systems of views on the state system. Although there may be 
different party names, different leaders. This offers the 
opportunity to compete, not to merge into one big political 
group. People differ in their views, in temperament, and 
because of this we will always have many parties. If some 
dictatorial regime is in power, it bans certain political 
parties. But in general the way of life, the system of 
existence, in the sphere of politics is through the interaction 
of political parties. An artist may be a loner, and indeed not 
all countries have artists' unions. A writer may also be a 
loner. But he is still linked to the state. He needs a 
publisher, he needs a book distribution system, advertising, 
meetings with readers. Therefore he is still obliged to join 
certain corporations and link himself in some way to the state, 
to society. He may, of course, hide out somewhere in a dacha, 
for a year, or two, or three, and write his novel; but he needs 
paper, ink, information, other books, archives -- in the end he 
cannot cut himself off from the state. And the same is true of 
the system of political parties. Here we are linked, we are 
different, and through different parties we express our views, 
we seek the success of our party. These are the elements of 
political life. Successes, defeats, failures, ups and downs. 
As in personal life, as in production or working life, as in 
creative work, as for a sportsman or a scientist. There will 
always be some positive and some negative aspects. 
  But politics has its own peculiarities, its own internal 
laws, which also require clearly defined relations. A party 
needs an organization centrally and locally; it needs rules, 
fundamental documents, a program; periodical meetings, 
conferences, congresses, plenums, supreme councils. A party's 
activity takes the form of rallies, demonstrations, pickets, 
activity through the faction in parliament, the use of the 
press, all kinds of forms. Like sportsmen -- competitions, 
championships, the Olympic Games, training sessions, various 
regional meetings, etc. There are many similarities here, 
generations succeed each other in the same way, there are the 
same changes of leadership, adjustments of one kind or another 
to programs and methods of operation. Parties have their 
diseases too: A party grows decrepit or suddenly gets younger, 
it begins to lean to the left or to the right, it acquires more 
liberalism or more conservatism. All this is political life. It 
is very interesting. The political life is probably the most 
interesting of all, because it does not get boring, something 
fresh is always coming along. 
  This work is always associated with youth, there is always a 
new, fresh, living impetus. Young hearts and souls become 
mature and enter adult life. A political party is a school too. 
Here too, new people arrive. There are the elders, the party 
veterans, and leaders' departures may be painful. Not every 
leader is ready to go of his own accord, sometimes they stay 
longer than they should. Sometimes this is a good thing, it 
means that a kind of continuity of course, stability, the 
party's face, is maintained. Or else there may simply be no 
other leader at a given stage. But there are parties where it 
is entirely possible for a change of leaders to occur every two 
or three years, or else a collective leadership is possible, the 
institution of cochairmanship. All this diversity makes up the 
bouquet that is political life. Sometimes it is fragrant, this 
bouquet, but sometimes it dies, or is swept aside by a 
dictatorial regime. 
  On the whole I personally am satisfied with my life, I have 
achieved what I wanted, even if I would only give myself a " 3 
." I am leader of a political party and I have been a candidate 
for the presidency of the republic. Today the whole world knows 
about me, not just the whole country -- from Kaliningrad to 
Kamchatka. They know me in Iraq as maybe the closest friend of 
the Iraqi people. In Finland, conversely, they are afraid of 
me. They are not too fond of me in Poland, but in Germany they 
are well disposed; certain political forces in France and South 
Africa are sympathetic, and Russian emigres in Australia, Spain, 
and Germany are well disposed toward me. I have supporters and 
opponents in every country of the world. I am famous. I have 
met personally with Saddam Husayn, who, for two years after the 
war, received no foreigners at all, least of all Russians. 
Deputies from the Russian parliament, leaders of various 
parties, and journalists went to see him, but he received only 
me in November 1992. We talked for four hours in his palace in 
Baghdad. It was an interesting trip. By plane to Amman, then 
nearly 14 hours through the desert to Baghdad. A week in 
Baghdad. A meeting with the country's supreme leader on 
Saturday 21 November. We talked for a long time; Saddam Husayn 
listened and asked questions. 
  I have seen the world, traveled to dozens of countries, met 
with leaders of political parties, and spoken in parliaments. I 
have been to the United Nations in New York and Geneva. At 
least I have seen enough of the world to gain the all-around 
outlook that is needed in order to head a political party in 
your own country. Many of our party leaders have never traveled 
anywhere at all. Some of them do not know their own country very 
well; they even have a poor command of their own language, not 
to mention foreign languages. 
  So I can say confidently that I have reached certain targets 
for a politician -- both from the viewpoint of domestic politics 
and in terms of the international situation. I am included 
among the group of eight leaders of right-wing political parties 
of the world, along with leaders from Germany, France, Italy, 
Britain, and Austria. My name is in various directories, there 
are reports on me by various intelligence services of the world, 
I am mentioned in ambassadors' dispatches, in correspondence 
between officials at the highest level, in reports to the 
presidents of the world's leading countries. For the most part, 
my self-esteem and vanity as a politician is satisfied. But it 
never was fanatical, and I was always an advocate of compromise. 
Tell me today: Cease all political activity, disband your 
party, it will help Russia, it will have a beneficial effect on 
the political situation. And I will do it. Maybe in six months 
I will be forgotten, I will be a "has-been," and maybe people 
will call me a failure -- so be it. It will be a good thing for 
my country, and that is the main aim. Not some idea, and not my 
name. The idea must be universal and comprehensible to 
everyone: Normal living conditions for everyone, pluralism in 
everything, democracy for everyone. A rule-of-law state, a 
multiparty parliament, a mixed economy, immutability of borders, 
the exclusion of violence from all relationships, from all 
spheres of human life. All this is understood, everyone wants 
it. But I see my place. And I am satisfied with the political 
outcome of my life, although maybe it is not the outcome, but 
just one of the first landings on the staircase I have climbed 
up, and I will be able to climb even higher and help the party I 
head, and help all Russians. 
  I very often hear words of support in various parts of 
Russia, from ordinary citizens, be it a Cossack from Krasnodar 
Kray or an inhabitant of the Urals or Siberia, or a Muscovite, 
or a Petersburger. And I am not perturbed by the false data of 
certain "sociological polls." I know a significant percentage 
is behind me, and if Russian presidential elections were held 
today, I would have a chance of victory. About 40 million 
voters may vote for me. And that is only natural, because when 
6 million voted for me two years ago, I was still virtually 
unknown. Independent sociological services conducted a poll 
among Muscovites -- this was in November 1992 -- in the waiting 
lines at Moscow's stores. Voting papers for elections for the 
president of the republic were distributed. Citizens filled 
them out again. After the count, in transpired that 29 percent 
were for me. The remaining candidates, Yeltsin included, did 
not even get 10 percent each. What better proof could there be? 
I received five or six times more votes than any other 
candidate. And that is a chance of victory. 
  I think there are still bright prospects ahead of us, and 
1993 is the last year of delay, instability, uncertainty. In 
1994, progress in a positive direction will begin. For sure, we 
will be able after all to form a new political leadership and 
establish a new concept as the foundation of all areas of our 
domestic and foreign policy. And we will go further, in order 
to safeguard the interests of all citizens of Russia without 
discrimination, so that life is good for everyone in Rus. This 
may, of course, look to some people like a fantasy, a dream, and 
it is indeed hard to do. But there is no need to promise 
"pineapple in champagne," you can promise a quiet life, a life 
of sufficiency. If a pensioner gets bread and butter, cheese, 
and kasha in the mornings and can have tea, coffee, or cocoa to 
drink. If he has a bit of salad to eat for lunch, a meatless 
cabbage soup or broth, a cutlet, and a fruit drink. And in the 
evening he has a bit of herring, some potatoes, and maybe a 
glass of kefir. If, when he feels like it, he can drink a glass 
of tea with honey cakes -- I think all this will be enough for 
him, he will be satisfied. And sometimes he will have fruit and 
candies, he will have enough money for a bath and to go to the 
movies, to pay the apartment expenses, and sometimes to buy a 
little present for the grandchildren. I think the pensioner 
will support us, he will be at peace. He will have a roof over 
his head, he will always have something to eat, something to 
wear. He should have a certain minimum. And it means that some 
of the population may even live well, very well, because people 
will have the opportunity to work honestly, and after that -- a 
secure old age. Because there will be no more revolutions and 
perestroykas in our country, we must put an end to all that. 
And in order to put an end to it and secure a decent life for 
ourselves for several hundred years to come, we must make the 
transition to a new geopolitical formula for the development of 
the Russian state. We must accomplish this surge of ours 
to the south, this last southern "Dash," the Russians' last 
campaign, in order once and for all to put an end to the danger 
on the Fatherland's southern borders and to help the peoples who 
are Russia's neighbors to gain a peaceful life and eliminate all 
hotbeds of war and tension, which lead to clashes and 
conflicts. 
  The southern campaign.... Once, the Red Cavalry was marching 
on Warsaw, and this was the slogan: "Forward, to the English 
Channel," "On to Warsaw, Berlin, the Channel." Then our 
cavalry, moving to the east, reached the Pacific Ocean, where 
their march ended. In 1979-1989 the Red Army went down to 
Afghanistan, and at one time, in 1919, the cavalry was marching 
from the west via Bulgaria to Constantinople, and there was no 
one in the path of this cavalry, only the Entente stopped its 
progress and the taking of Constantinople. And in 1916 the 
Russians reached the Iraqi border. And they were in northern 
Iran for many years, until 1946, I think. So the advance to the 
south is nothing new for Russia. 
  This is a normal direction of movement for Russia, its 
military structures, and its economic and cultural institutions. 
We should feel comfortable here -- both Persians and Turkmens. 
Turkmenia should not be divided into south and north. And the 
Tajiks should not live only in Afghanistan. There will simply 
be a liberated space where Uzbeks will live, and other peoples 
too -- Baluchis, Kurds, Assyrians. And how many peoples live in 
Dagestan? We should all live freely in this region -- from 
Kabul to Istanbul -- and put an end to the hotbeds of war, 
hostility, and hatred, and ensure prosperity and well-being for 
all the peoples, including the Russian people, who would be a 
stabilizing factor, an advanced post on the shore of the Indian 
Ocean. And they would be a restraining factor, to rule out 
clashes between Christians and Muslims, between Turkic speakers 
and Farsi speakers, between Shiites and Sunnites, field 
commanders, and so forth. Therefore Russia should go south and 
reach the shores of the warm Indian Ocean. This is not just my 
whim. It is Russia's destiny. It is fate. It is Russia's 
great exploit. We must do it, because we have no choice. There 
is no other way for us. It is geopolitics. Our development 
demands it. Like a child who has outgrown his clothes and must 
put on new ones. 
  And it is not a question of enslaving other peoples or 
seizing others' territories. There is a perpetual state of war 
there. Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, the Kurds. The peoples are 
waiting for some kind of final solution to the problem. Take 
Dagestan -- if it was autonomous, could it exist? No, because 
every village has its own nationality. And each one would try 
to secure certain advantages. Dagestan is part of Russia, and 
its name, translated into Russian, means "mountain republic," 
without any national coloring. There are Avars, Tats, Kumyks, 
Nogai -- scores of peoples live there. And Chechens, and 
Ingush, and Russians, and Azerbaijanis -- the most diverse 
peoples. Take away Russia as a stabilizing factor -- and you 
have war there. Because even today the peoples there do not 
have clearly demarcated borders, their own national attributes, 
or special opportunities for national self-expression. Even 
given the existence of Russia as a stabilizing factor, not 
everything develops successfully there. Russia is a platform, a 
buffer, a wall, which every people can lean on in order to exist 
in peace, develop, and not seek to create its own "greater" 
state. Just as there is no "great" Russia. Because the word 
"great," in its original meaning, means big. Simply a big 
country. And it is indeed big -- from the Baltic to 
Vladivostok. That is how things have turned out. Denmark is a 
small country, you could not call it Great Denmark. There are 
big trees and small trees. A small tree may yield a great deal 
of fruit. For instance, a small peach or mandarin tree may 
yield a great deal of fruit, while a tall tree standing next to 
it yields no fruit at all. And yields nothing of any special 
usefulness. Just like people. A person's height does not 
determine his position in society. And the same is true of a 
nation. It is purely a quantitative indicator. Small and great 
peoples -- this is only a matter of numbers. And it need not 
even be mentioned, the nationalities question need not be 
touched on at all. In future, clearly, this could become as 
improper as talking about whether someone is beautiful or ugly. 
What is ugly to you may be beautiful to someone else. That is 
the way they were born. Take birds. There are sparrows, and 
there are eagles. The eagle is a beauty, with a strong beak and 
a wide wingspan. But the sparrow is alive, it wants to live, 
this is its life. Or dogs. There are unprepossessing 
watchdogs, and then there are powerful wolfhounds and English 
mastiffs -- pedigree dogs. But that is not to their credit. It 
is an inherent quality which does not give them any privileges. 
But even these examples are not entirely appropriate, because 
man is the highest entity, the highest being in nature. It is 
often impossible to draw analogies here. 
  But usually that is precisely what happens -- a small 
people is exterminated just because it is small and unable to 
defend itself. For instance, today the Georgians are waging war 
on the Ossetians in South Ossetia and on the Abkhaz in Abkhazia. 
But they are afraid to rise up against the Russians, or even 
against the Azerbaijanis, because there are more of them. So 
that means that if a people is small, you can kick it. But if 
it is big, you are afraid of it. Nobody would really dare to 
wage war on the Chinese, but they might risk it against the 
Mongolians or Tibetans. 
  So here in the south we will create equal conditions for all 
peoples. Everyone is entitled to describe himself as belonging 
to this or that nation. But passports will not contain the 
section "nationality," and that section will not appear on 
forms. Nationality will not determine a person's rights in any 
way. In the long term, even citizenship should not determine 
rights. Someone without citizenship is a person; he lives here, 
he has no local passport, he is a person without citizenship, 
but all the same he is a part of human society. A person cannot 
be deprived of rights because he has no citizenship, any more 
than because of particular political convictions, or because he 
is of a different nationality or a different religion, or his 
skin is a different color, or he is from a different tribe or a 
different locality. There should be no discriminatory factors. 
The south must be freed from this plague -- nationalism, 
chauvinism on the part of a big nation toward a small one, or 
nationalism on the part of a small nation with regard to a big 
neighbor. We must learn to respect ourselves as citizens, as 
men and women, as adults and children, with a common right to a 
normal, peaceful life. And nobody is entitled to resort to 
violence. Law and order should be the same everywhere. Human 
rights belong to everyone, everyone should be under the 
protection of the law, under the shelter of the law, which 
operates in time and space throughout this territory -- from 
Kabul to Istanbul, from the southern Indian Ocean coast to the 
coast of the Arctic Ocean. In Murmansk and on the shores of the 
Indian Ocean, we are all citizens of a single Russian state. It 
is the same whether you are in Kaliningrad or Chukotka, in 
Izmail or Taymyr, in St. Petersburg or on the Amur -- it is all 
one legal, economic, political, and financial area. 
  It is difficult to make it a single ecological area, because 
different places have different levels of environmental 
pollution. We are dependent -- on natural disasters and on the 
pollution of nature. It is therefore all the more necessary to 
create an atmosphere in relations precluding a transition to 
violent actions in resolving disputes of any kind -- any 
question, be it drainage systems, the division of land, housing 
questions, jobs, leisure, education, the army draft -- any 
question should be resolved only from the standpoint of civic 
responsibility. You live in a given locality, laws are in force 
here that are identical for all of us, we live in accordance 
with those laws, and all the commandments -- Christian, 
Biblical, Muslim, Judaic. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not 
steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Thou shalt not 
commit violence. Help one another. All this is common 
knowledge. All this is in folklore, in fairy stories, in 
sermons, in moral teachings, in everyday life. All the grandmas 
and grandpas in the world teach their grandchildren well. But 
why do some children grow up to be good and kind, while others 
become murderers and rapists? Obviously something goes wrong in 
their education, and maybe there is not enough state 
participation in this. We do not take children away from bad 
families in time. Given that we have failed to prevent the 
emergence of a bad family, the state should have the resources 
to take a child away from such a family if only for a time, and 
to raise him in the conditions of a state children's home, 
school, or boarding school. And where children's homes exist, 
it is possible, on the other hand, to go over to family 
children's homes, to create the conditions so that adults can 
take children from these homes, so that the child can grow up in 
a family. This will not be 100 percent successful, but it is 
necessary to reduce to the minimum the number of children in 
state institutions. 
  Ultimately, the aim of any policy is the happiness of real 
people. It is not hard to put forward this formula: What does 
it matter if I am unhappy, as long as Russia is happy. But will 
Russia be happy if we are all unhappy? Obviously, sensible 
coexistence is needed, so that each of us lives well and the 
country as a whole lives well. So let's have less 
heroism, less renunciation: "I am prepared to sacrifice myself 
as long as my country is happy." If we all sacrifice ourselves, 
who is going to live in our country? Happiness and joy 
constitute the general well-being in the country. The health of 
every one of us is the country's happiness. Therefore our every 
day, our every effort of labor, every moment of our 
participation in any political sphere, should have this noble 
goal: To create, not destroy; to help. To give people joy, not 
to provoke their hatred; to be tolerant. We cannot have mobs of 
people running somewhere or other carrying sticks, beating 
somebody up, we cannot have stones and glass being thrown, cars 
being overturned and set on fire.... We cannot. 
  August 1991 in Moscow -- it is terrible. Armored personnel 
carriers are moving under the bridge over Kalinin Prospekt, and 
a mob of frenzied, half-drunk Muscovites stop an armored 
personnel carrier, drag the tank driver out, and try to set fire 
to the combat vehicle. Is this not barbaric? After all, even 
if it was to some extent unjustified -- to some extent barbaric 
-- to send in the troops, the attack on the troops and the 
attempts to beat up the tankmen or armored vehicle drivers and 
commit violence against them were even more barbaric. After 
all, the troops would simply have advanced further. Three 
Muscovites would not have been killed had it not been for this 
artificial clash, the attempts to provoke, to arouse hatred. 
Those guys, the tankmen, went into Moscow and stopped at 
specific places, they did not shoot, they did not threaten 
anyone, they climbed out of their tanks, bought ice creams, 
chatted up girls. Children and adults clambered onto the tanks 
and there was no threat. They were our tanks, they were our 
boys, it was our army. And they tried to blow this up into 
hostile acts of some kind, to provoke people into a major 
conflict. And the result was casualties. It was not the SCSE 
[State Committee for the State of Emergency] that did this, but 
the "Democratic Russians," certain adventurist forces who wanted 
to exacerbate the situation. 
  Then the same thing was repeated in Tajikistan. But here 
there were tens of thousands of casualties. So August 1991 in 
Moscow was not three days of the "putsch." It was the start of 
civil war in Russia. This war is already blazing in the North 
Caucasus. It is blazing in the Dniester region and in Central 
Asia. It is developing at a slower pace in the Baltic region, 
Tataria, and other regions. It is terrible. Therefore measures 
are needed, so that the country can provide itself with secure 
living conditions. In the late 20th century you cannot play with 
fire. We cannot move to other regions and start life all over 
again. We can only live where we live today. We need no great 
conquerors now -- no Alexander the Great, no Bonaparte, no 
Hitler. We do not need Pinochet today either. Although we have 
candidates for the Pinochet role -- General Lebed, Moscow 
militia chief Pankratov. There will always be those in Russia 
who are prepared to brandish the big stick and shout: "Grab 
them, arrest them, throw them in jail!" They will always exist 
elsewhere too, and this is plain to see today. Former criminals 
and lawbreakers who have served 20 years for murder suddenly 
become all but heads of state in the former territories of the 
USSR. At least, they head the Armed Forces or form part of the 
political leadership in those amorphous, artificial, pygmy 
states. These political games are impermissible. Therefore 
democracy also allows for violence. 
  How do I see Russia? I do not see Russia weeping, 
Berdyayev-style. I see a proud Russia, a Russia wherein the 
glorious traditions of its army will once again be realized, 
where talented Russian engineers and industrialists will create 
examples of the latest technology. After all, even today we 
could conquer the world with our electric motors. We should not 
try to catch up with Japan in electronics and computers. We 
have fallen behind in this sphere, and here we can use 
international experience. But we do have electric motors. We 
do have power engineering. That is one thing. Another thing -- 
space. We have fallen behind in motor vehicle building, but we 
can continue to develop the space industry and aviation. We 
could obtain the maximum advantages in this, to make up for our 
laggardness in motor vehicle building. Ours is a forest 
country. Therefore priority should be given to the timber 
industry. We should have the best furniture in the world. And 
we should only export the surplus. But today we are sending raw 
materials abroad. Gas, oil -- in the main these should be 
retained for domestic consumption, for future generations. It 
is wrong -- to pump it to other countries day and night via 
pipelines. Our economic policy and development priorities 
should be intelligent. 
  The new Russia will be technically well equipped with new 
plants, motors, engines, ecologically clean machinery; with 
medium-sized cities -- 500,000 or 1 million people. We do not 
want vast cities of 10 million people. A Russia that does not 
harm nature, that is sensible in its use of its water resources, 
forests, steppes, deserts, mountains -- all this is used in the 
interests of man, not in the interests of implementing the idea 
of some scientist or other who might die, while we would go on 
suffering for a long time after, trying to put his idea into 
practice, although this idea will be of no benefit to us. But 
on the other hand, we must help our scientists to realize their 
ideas here, in our country, and not to go abroad. We have a 
huge number of inventors, rationalizers, self-taught men, we 
have people who are ready to create an entirely new technology, 
to create conditions such that our industry will take a leading 
place in the world in every respect. Trade must be developed. 
Russian mercantile traditions must be restored so that Russian 
merchants import from abroad and from overseas the things that 
we ourselves lack, and export from Russia only what we have a 
surplus of. 
  That is how I see Russia. It will have the world's 
strongest army, strategic forces, our missiles with multiple 
launchers. Our space combat platforms, our "Buran" spaceship 
and "Energiya" rockets -- this is the country's rocket shield. 
Total security, we have no rival. But nor should we lay claim 
to world domination, to tell other peoples how they should live, 
to interfere in their affairs -- in no circumstances. 
  It will be a new Russia, without "devils," without 
fanaticism, a Russia where Orthodoxy and the Christian religion 
hold the dominant position. We must not permit alien religions 
to disturb the minds of the young generation of Russians, that 
does not lead to rapprochement between the peoples, it hampers 
the correct perception of the realities around us. We must 
help the Russian Orthodox religion to take its proper place, but 
at the same time we must be tolerant. We must take the 
nationalities issue off the agenda, so that nobody should ever 
suffer a moment's hesitation over the thought that something 
might violate his rights on national grounds. Still less should 
there be any grounds for discrimination on the basis of 
political or economic convictions. The new Russia means a 
rule-of-law state, a secular state, it means a strong 
presidential regime, a strong multiparty parliament, it means 
legislation that lasts for centuries, that does not have to be 
changed every 10 years. It means a Constitution respected by 
everyone -- from children to old people. It means a single set 
of symbols across the country -- the black, yellow, and white 
flag, the state flag of Russia. It should fly over all state 
institutions, in every region of our vast Fatherland. It means 
the national anthem, a single anthem. It means a state 
language, the language of interethnic intercourse -- Russian. 
It means a single monetary unit -- the ruble. It means a 
single system of finance, transportation, communications, 
energy, ecology, defense, and foreign policy. And at the same 
time self-government everywhere, in every region and territory 
-- full self-government, the resolution of all local issues 
autonomously, through the local dumas, state assemblies, organs 
of representative, power and organs of administration. Why go 
to Moscow to tackle day-to-day tasks? 
<H3>  RUSSIANS, THE DESTINY OF RUSSIA IS IN THE HANDS OF EVERY ONE 
OF YOU </H3>
  Men and women, wherever you live, whatever your life is like 
-- joyful or joyless, whether you live with a family or on your 
own, whether you have achieved success in your professional 
field or in the pleasures of love, whether you are a sportsman 
or an unsuccessful artist, an actor at the beginning of your 
career or an eminent architect, a sewage worker or an engineer, 
a traffic inspector or a medical orderly -- you are Russians, 
and you should not expect anyone to bring you joy and happiness. 
But whereas lunch, breakfast, and dinner really do depend on 
your own pocketbook, which may at any given moment be full or 
empty, as for being able to walk peacefully through the streets 
of your native city, look any passerby frankly and directly in 
the eyes, feel that you are a citizen of your state -- everyone 
should be able to do that. To live in security, to look with 
pride on your country's state flag, to listen to its state 
anthem with a lump in your throat -- whenever you hear it, at 
the stadium, in the concert hall, on the radio, abroad, to stand 
still at that moment, as the country's state flag flutters or is 
hoisted on the flagstaff in the square. As a military unit goes 
past, to stop at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the 
monument to the heroes who fell in the struggle for our 
Motherland's freedom. To know that while you are out walking, 
or calling on friends, or at work, nobody is going to break into 
your apartment, that your daughter is not going to be raped, 
that she will grow up in peace and get married, to know that 
your son is not going to be beaten up and maimed in the street 
by the local hooligans, or in the army, or while away on 
business, or while on vacation somewhere, especially in the 
south -- all these things should be the attributes of the state 
in which you live. And all this is our Russia, yours and mine, a 
cold and hungry Russia, with its rain, its impassable roads, its 
contaminations, its malnutrition, its great victories, the 
smiles of our "great leaders," our so-called leaders, and the 
glum faces of those who succeed them -- but still it is our 
Russia, yours and mine. The Russia that has fought every enemy 
-- from East, West, North, and South, the Russia that is somehow 
incapable of resolving the problem of impassable roads. If only 
it were resolved. If roads were finally built all over Russia. 
Good, concrete roads, with a solid median strip and a telephone 
every three kilometers. And vehicle servicing stations, and gas 
pumps everywhere, and everything all lit up, and signposts, 
intersections, and viaducts everywhere. We have done it in 
space. Now our achievements must be brought down to earth. 
  Bring the achievements of space to the earth. Make life 
pleasant for every one of us. We were delighted when the first 
cosmonauts returned, in the first years of space exploration. 
But when we went out in the streets of our city and saw the 
poor state of the road, the gates falling down, a clattering 
streetcar or decrepit trolleybus, and the eternal, eternal 
waiting lines outside all the stores -- all this quickly spoiled 
our mood. We really "lived for victories." First, victory in 
the civil war, but who vanquished whom? Brother killed brother. 
Then victory in collectivization. Again, at whose expense? 
Good, strong peasants were driven out of the villages, the 
weak, the scum, and the drunkards were declared kolkhoz members, 
and they called that the victory of the kolkhoz system. Then the 
next victory, when, by the labor of "zeks" [convicts] without 
rights, vast plants were built. But how many died, in wooden 
huts, in terrible conditions! And that was a victory too -- for 
industrialization. And when many thousands of army commanders 
were liquidated to make way for ignoble, incompetent, weak 
officers -- that was a victory too. For cadre policy. Finally, 
with all our might, with bloodshed, we stopped the fascist beast 
and pushed him back to the West -- that was a victory too. At 
the cost, on their side, in numerical terms, of 10 million dead, 
and on our side, 26 million -- nearly one to three. If it had 
been one to one, we would not have won. There were just more of 
us. And it's colder here. And the roads are bad. If Russia 
had had roads like Europe, and the same climate, and 
proportionately the same population, Germany would have 
conquered us, as it conquered France, where there was the same 
climate, the same roads, and approximately the same population 
-- 50-60 million people. You cannot achieve victory by sending 
millions to the grave. You cannot go into space but leave 
entire sectors of industry undeveloped. You cannot produce a 
vast quantity of arms and not produce the most essential goods 
for the population, for every one of us. We are perpetually 
waiting in line for something or other -- socks, underpants, 
light bulbs, razors, batteries, teapots, condoms, furniture, 
cars. Well, all the time. Never a day or a year, not a single 
region, where everything is available and there are no waiting 
lines. But in Germany and France, all over Europe, this is not 
so, and we can reach their level, if every Russian takes 
Russia's fate in his own hands. You have to feel you are a 
citizen, you have to finally achieve national self-awareness -- 
I am Russian [russkiy], I am a citizen of Russia [rossiyanin]. 
I want to live in a rich, civilized country where human rights 
are implemented, where nobody looks at a form to see what party 
you belong to, what is your nationality, your social origin. 
Nobody reads your resume, the personnel people do not call and 
ask: How well did he work for you? What are his views, what 
did you notice about him? That should not happen. And your 
passport should be simple. Surname, first name, date and place 
of birth -- and that is all, nothing more should concern the 
state. Everything else is personal. Nationality, religion, 
family status, and so forth -- that is everyone's personal 
business. We are given a name to distinguish us from other 
people, and you have to know someone's age, since it is a kind 
of measure of progress through life. But everything else is of 
no significance, should be of no significance. A time will come 
when there will be no passports in Russia. The residence permit 
is already disappearing, although for the time being it is still 
needed in order to combat the pilgrimage of southerners to 
Russia's European centers. They have already crept across the 
Urals. Like toadstools, or cockroaches.... 
  Russians, proud people, the 21st century will belong to us 
despite everything! In the next seven years we will finally 
stop all the revolutions, all the perestroykas, all the 
Gorbystroykas, we will put an end to Yeltsinism and 
Burbulitsism. The Poltoranins and Gaydars will depart. All 
this will go. And we will enter the 21st century changed and 
pure. Right now we are in the bath. We are washing away the 
scabs, the dirt that have accumulated throughout the 20th 
century. Sometimes this draws blood. That is bad. But clearly 
even this was necessary to us, to our sorrowful country, in 
order finally to wash away the contagion, the Satanic infection, 
that afflicted us early in the century, that was unloosed on 
central Russia from the West in order to poison the country and 
undermine it from within -- through communism, through 
nationalism, through cosmopolitanism, through the influence of 
alien religions, alien ideas, an alien way of life. We will put 
an end to this. We will emerge as the most fire-hardened nation. 
  But we must feel it, we must begin to think in national 
terms, we must at last become Russian. Not communists, not 
"Democratic Russians," but first we must become Russian, we must 
become citizens of Russia, we must at long last become citizens 
of our Fatherland, of our Eurasian continent. And we will be 
pleased to become part of a common European home, but a big 
home, a home for everyone -- from the English Channel to 
Vladivostok. The Mitterrand option will not work. We do not 
want a curtailed Europe, we do not want a game reserve for those 
who robbed Africa and Russia and now want to fence themselves 
off from us and live for their own pleasure. Let us live 
honestly, openly. We Russians are prepared for that. By 
Russians we mean all who speak and think in Russian, who do not 
extol their own nation above others, do not taunt others, do not 
yearn for violence or world domination. We do not want world 
domination. Nor do we want some other power to take steps to 
become the sole superpower and rule the world. 
  We say to the Americans: Stop in time. We say to Bill 
Clinton: Do not repeat the mistakes of Napoleon and Hitler. 
You, Bill Clinton, are my age, you and I belong to the same 
generation in the same world. America will also soon begin to 
disintegrate, there too, much that is negative has accumulated, 
there too, many problems and interethnic clashes will spring up. 
Ahead of you lies your own perestroyka, your sickness, your 
degradation. And we Russians will not gloat when some of the 
states begin to secede, when your plants shut down, when you do 
not have enough food or medicines, when people start leaving 
America for Europe, Russia, Japan, South Africa, Australia. We 
will not gloat when California goes over to Mexico, when a negro 
republic is founded in Miami, when the Russians take back 
Alaska. When you no longer have the United States of America, 
but the Commonwealth of New States of America, and Washington 
does not govern the United States, but there are separate 
governments in San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia, Texas.... 
We will not humiliate you if you have to ask the international 
banks for a loan or ask for the repayment of past debts to be 
deferred. You already have a huge domestic and foreign debt 
today. You already have a huge number of problems today. So do 
not dig a hole for others, and do not spit in the well that you 
too will have to drink from. 
  We Russians have no hostile feelings toward Americans. We 
have never been involved in a direct conflict with them; on the 
contrary, we shook hands as allies on the Elbe River, in 
Germany, after together overcoming the most terrible aggressor 
of the 20th century. And today you should make no mistake. The 
Chinese stopped in time. Mao's ideas did not grip the world, 
and the Maoist revolution did not go beyond the borders of 
China. The Japanese also lay no claim to world domination. The 
Germans have had enough of war forever and do not want to take 
part in any military conflict. And Sweden has completely 
forgotten what war is. After a defeat by the Russian Army, the 
Swedes renounced waging war anywhere ever again. You Americans 
remain the last nation, the last people, the last state, that 
still makes a noise, that still sends in its quick reaction 
forces, that dictates, imposes its will on Iraq, Libya, Serbia. 
Leave these peoples in peace. Stop the blockade of Iraq, 
Libya, and Serbia, do not interfere in the affairs of Europe, 
Asia, Africa, Latin America, Australia. Look after your own 
problems. Let us at long last go over to regional cooperation. 
Let us really end the Cold War. Do not tell us what to do in 
the Baltic, in Central Asia, in the Dniester region, in the 
Transcaucasus. And we will not tell you what to do in the 
southern states, or ask why you kidnapped the legitimate 
president of Panama, Noriega, why you sent a landing force to 
the island of Grenada and destroyed the Maurice Bishop regime 
there -- although this is barbarity, naked aggression, 
interference in other peoples's affairs, and violation of 
international and national law. A time may come when you will 
have to answer for it. You demand arms cuts. Fine, let's make 
cuts. But simultaneously. We will not disarm unilaterally. We 
agree to withdraw the troops from Europe, but you withdraw yours 
too. The Germans, for instance, are keener for you to get out 
of Europe than us. They would rather be left with Russian 
troops in their country than Americans. And in many countries 
of the world there is a desire for you to remove your bases. 
Americans, let us put an end to the tension in the world which 
emanates from you as well as us. Let us not make mutual 
accusations, humiliate each other, and look to see who has more 
warheads, tanks, aircraft, or submarines, let us agree to a 
balance of forces in the world, the division of spheres of 
influence, the principle of regional cooperation, the principle 
of North-South relations, let us end all tension in West-East 
relations and rule out war forever. So you Americans must leave 
the Balkans and the Near East. The world will say "thank you." 
Otherwise one fine day it will put you in the dock, and you 
will face the threat of a new Nuremberg, if your hotheads do not 
cool down. 
  But we believe in the Americans' good sense, because they 
are a fusion of representatives of different nations from all 
over the world. We have no chauvinism or frenzied nationalism. 
We would like to believe that you do not seek domination by 
your nation over others. Remember, you survive thanks to theft 
under the cloak of state institutions. First you plundered 
Latin America and Africa and grew rich out of two world wars, 
and for the last 50 years you have been stealing "brains," and 
that is the most valuable thing in the world -- the human brain. 
Throughout the 20th century, the best minds have been sailing, 
flying, journeying to your country from all over the world. A 
scientist may experience some temporary difficulties and 
depression, so he goes to your country to work. But at the same 
time he automatically enriches you, makes you stronger. You 
must know that your wealth is not the achievement of the 
indigenous people of America or of those first settlers. This 
wealth was created by Russians, among others, because nearly all 
America's mathematicians are Soviet Jews who left the USSR. A 
great many Russians work in various American laboratories today. 
It is the same in Germany, where there is not only the blood of 
Russian soldiers, but the sweat of Russian workers who worked in 
Germany for 30-40 years more after the war, restoring it and 
making it rich. Therefore everything that America has achieved 
was achieved by the labor of all nations and ethnic groups. 
  We are today divided by artificial borders, the population 
is 
now intermingled everywhere. There are Russians living 
everywhere today -- in Germany, France, America, Australia, 
Spain -- hundreds of thousands, millions of Russians have 
dispersed across the world. The same is true of representatives 
of other peoples: There are Italians, for instance, living 
everywhere -- in Europe and America. These are artificial 
borders, formalities, and we should not wage war because of 
this. So let us calm down, let us concern ourselves with our 
domestic problems and problems associated with the immediate 
region. For America, that will be the southern states and 
Mexico and the adjacent localities -- the Caribbean region. For 
France, it is North Africa. And for Russia it is Afghanistan, 
Iran, Turkey. People must agree on this and not get in the way, 
not interfere. The same for China. It has interests in 
Mongolia and South Asia. But it should not be taking sidelong 
looks at what the Russians are doing in Afghanistan, still less 
in Iran or Turkey. The same for Japan. It is prepared to agree 
to Russia having access to the shores of the Indian Ocean, but 
it wants certain islands in the Kuril chain. A solution could 
be found here, maybe Japan could be given something. For 
instance, somewhere or other in that great archipelago of 
islands which we have not fully exploited, but which Japan very 
much wants. A formula could be found whereby Japan's interests 
would also be taken into account. Thus, favorable conditions 
could be created for all mankind, so that our planet is not 
stricken by political AIDS or a political Chernobyl. And the 
Russians will have the last word, because the Americans will 
ultimately agree with our stance, with our formula for the 
geopolitical development of the world, as a result of which 
Russia will complete the establishment of its southern borders 
and accomplish its last "dash" to the south. 
  Russia once saved the world from the Ottoman Empire by 
sending its troops to the south, and the Ottoman Empire, which 
had extended over three continents -- North Africa, southern 
Europe, Asia Minor -- fell as a result of 30 wars with Russia. 
Maybe, had it not been for Russia, all of Europe would have 
been Turkicized, because the Turks had already seized Budapest 
and besieged Vienna, so it was not much farther to Berlin, 
Paris, and the Channel. And seven centuries ago we stopped the 
Mongols. We could have let them pass and accepted their 
domination. And what would have been left of Europe then? We 
have saved it several times: From the south, from the east, 
from the north, and from the center of Europe itself, when the 
fascist plague triumphed in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and 
Greece. Thanks to the Russians, Europe was liberated from 
fascism. Europe helped Russia to liberate itself from 
communism. We helped each other. But the Russians suffered 
more losses, because Russia is located on the Eurasian 
continent, and therefore we stopped the most terrible aggressor 
in the world -- seven centuries ago, and again 50 years ago. So 
other peoples ought to be grateful to the Russians. The 
Russians have carried freedom on their shoulders, whatever 
uniform they wear -- that of the czarist Army, the Soviet Army, 
or the Russian Army. We have not enslaved peoples, driven them 
into slavery, or made them work for us. To this day we have not 
received adequate compensation from the Germans, from the 
French, from the Japanese, from the Swedes, from the Turks, from 
the Poles -- from a single one of the aggressors who have 
trampled and destroyed our country and our people. 
  The world should be grateful to Russia for its role as 
savior. And this is not Russia's reward for the troubles it has 
borne in fulfilling its historic mission every 100 years. It is 
Russia's natural development. It is its awakening and its 
ability once again to help the peoples of the south to gain true 
liberation, that the hour of silence may come at last in the 
Near and Middle East, in Asia Minor and Central Asia. Only 
Russia can help here. The Russian Army will assemble for the 
last time for its southern campaign and will stop forever on the 
shores of the Indian Ocean. Beyond that there is nowhere to go, 
beyond that are the warm waters of the Indian Ocean which wash 
the shores of our eternal friend India, of Iraq, of our 
strategic allies. The warm ocean breeze will soothe everyone 
living in this new geopolitical area, within these new borders 
of Russia. The Russian flag will threaten no one, and the 
Russian fleet in the Indian Ocean will pay friendly visits to 
the ports of India, the Persian Gulf, and East Africa. We will 
be friends with everyone, and especially South Africa. We are 
linked to it by special interests in the sphere of the economy, 
culture, and geopolitics. And these will be North-South 
relations. We will not overlap with the interests of the 
Chinese and Japanese, who will have special relations with the 
Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia. We will 
not go to West Africa, where Western Europe has interests. 
Still less will our path ever cross that of Latin America or 
the interests of the North American states. The world gains the 
order it has long needed, with no swastikas and no red stars, no 
Gestapo and no KGB. The world wants a firm, guaranteed order at 
long last, and the rivers will be cleaner, the water we drink 
will be cleaner. We will be able to relax more, we will become 
calmer. 
  We will understand each other, because every family will 
have 
the home it wants -- in a big city or a small one, in a mountain 
village or settlement, in the tropics, in the forest, on the 
mountainside, and in that home will be whoever you like. One 
wife or three, or none. One child or 10. You can have cows and 
sheep, or scientific instruments. It is up to you. Every 
family will live by its own laws, but respecting the laws of the 
neighboring family, the nearby settlement or city. The law is 
general, universal, according to a single formula: Do not kill, 
do not steal, do not deceive. That is what is needed, if we are 
to have equal opportunities. 
  All peoples are talented. Some people are good at grazing 
livestock, some grow flowers, some are good at fishing. Let us 
give each the task that suits him. In sport, in science, in 
creative work, in art, in any profession, under any climate. We 
will live peacefully and there will be no dominant ideology, no 
power will be able to claim authority or the right to establish 
a world order. And we will not threaten each other with 
"Russian Ivan" or "Uncle Sam." There will be fewer diseases. 
Hunger should disappear, because there is enough food and we 
will be able to distribute it to the needy. And all this will 
become possible when Russia gains its national self-awareness in 
tandem with the international -- not in order to raise up the 
Russians and send other peoples down to the depths. But in 
order, by raising up the Russians, to raise up all those who 
live alongside them, this whole Eurasian continent from Brest to 
Kabul and from Yamal to Istanbul. 
  Some people may say: The peoples of the south do not want 
your help or your geopolitical concepts. We will resist, we 
will wage war on you, eternal war, we will give you an eternal 
Afghanistan. This is a misconception, because in 1979-1989 the 
Red Army was in Afghanistan under communist banners. If this 
had been a czarist foreign policy, all the questions there would 
have been resolved long ago. The psychological factor is of 
great significance -- who it is who is implementing a given 
policy. There is no room for debate here. 
  Latvia will be part of Russia. There will be a small 
Lithuanian state within Russia. If you really want to live in a 
small, close-knit Ukraine, then there could be a small Ukrainian 
Republic. 
  But all this is only possible on condition that Russia 
reaches the south and stops at the shores of the Indian Ocean. 
Therefore the Finns, Lithuanians, and Estonians have an 
interest in ensuring that Russia establishes new borders. The 
Japanese, Chinese, and Hindus also have an interest in this. 
Arabs and Europeans too. This is the only way they will be 
freed from the Israeli trap, and America will finally gain 
tranquillity, being freed from megalomania, from the need to 
maintain its authority and remain the sole superpower. It will 
be easier for everyone, the world will breathe more freely, 
having acquired a recipe for reliability. 
  But the planet is vast. Peoples are different. You cannot 
implement a policy that will please absolutely everyone. That is 
not possible even within one state, or, indeed, within a family. 
Where you have mom, pop, and two children, someone is always 
going to be dissatisfied. Especially if you add a grandma and a 
grandpa. There will always be a "hornet's nest," always 
conflicts of some kind. We cannot make the world free from 
conflict, but we can deliver it from the threat of 
self-annihilation. 
  We cannot rid mankind entirely of disease. We will always 
catch colds, which will be called upper respiratory tract 
infections, flu, tonsillitis, pharyngitis. Conflicts are 
inevitable, after all. Just as you cannot avoid conflicts 
between man and woman. We will never be able to make everyone 
happy without exception. So that all women get husbands, all 
men get wives, and all of them have children, and they are all 
lively and healthy. This will never happen. It is every young 
couple's wish to become man and wife, to have children, to have 
their own home, the job they want, and to raise the children. 
But often this does not happen. There is no housing, the 
children get sick, the family breaks up, there are problems at 
work, conflicts with relatives -- this will always happen. And 
it is the same between peoples. 
  People will still tell jokes about Chukchis or Jews, about 
Russian Ivan or about the Caucasians, about khokhols [derogatory 
term for Ukrainians] -- one way or another, we will always go in 
for some kind of "hazing." But it should not end in the grave, 
as happens in our army. 
  A river carries away stones, sand, and silt. It moves. This 
is nature, and man is part of nature. But it is essential to 
regulate the processes -- so as to eliminate fascism, so as to 
eliminate communism, so as to eliminate the seizing of other 
people's countries, lands, airplanes. Suppose one of the 
passengers on an aircraft has too much to drink. By doing this, 
he harms himself. But if a terrorist comes along, a hijacker -- 
that is a threat to hundreds of people's lives. We must resist 
him. His actions must be neutralized. 
  Similarly, in a geopolitical formula, you cannot find some 
kind of ideal solution for everyone. I know there will be many 
protests in Kabul, Tehran, Ankara. But why do they think we 
should not be opposed to their plans for creating a greater 
Turkic state? What was Colonel Turkes, founder of the party of 
national order, put in prison for? For his ideas about Turan, a 
greater Turkic state from Istanbul to the Altay. The Turks 
themselves put him in prison for that. These nationalist ideas, 
these pan-Turkic sentiments, have come to the fore periodically, 
but in any case they have always existed in Turkish society, 
among academics, students, civil servants. The same is true of 
Tehran's attempt to disseminate the ideas of the Islamic 
revolution. In Afghanistan this has almost succeeded, but Iran 
has not yet succeeded, but is clearly trying to extend this to 
Azerbaijan and subsequently Turkey. Do pan-Islamic ideas help 
to improve the world order? Do they not constitute a threat to 
mankind? To all mankind. What about Kabul? It is perpetual 
war there. Zahir Shah, President Daud, the Afghan communists -- 
from Nur Mohamed Taraki to Najibullah. There is no such people 
as the Afghan people. There are various peoples -- Uzbeks, 
Kharizeytsy [as transliterated], Tajiks, Pushtuns, Daris. Why 
should they not live as they wish, without breaking up into 
gangs headed by field commanders? Is this not a threat to 
peace? And what about the perpetual clashes between Pakistan 
and India? All this must come to an end some time. 
  There has been, is, and will be dissatisfaction with our 
idea. But just as in an individual family there is always 
someone who is dissatisfied with the established order there, so 
in the big family of people of our planet not everyone will 
agree with the order that could be established. They should 
accept it, be reconciled to it, for the sake of the majority. 
Just as Russia's communists should accept that the majority of 
Russians do not want the kind of communism that they tried to 
implement in the form of the Stalinist-Brezhnevite model. 
  Russia's move to the south is primarily a defensive measure, 
a countermeasure, because today there is a threat to Russia from 
the south: From the direction of Afghanistan, which is already 
attacking Tajikistan, from the direction of Tehran, which is 
building plans for the pan-Islamic seizure of vast territories, 
from the direction of Ankara, where plans for a greater Turkic 
state were prepared long ago. Pan-Turkism is a threat to 
Russia, because it has a large Turkic-speaking population, 
Muslim, Farsi-speaking -- and all this is useful soil, a good 
incentive for Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey to move up toward 
the north, creating a greater Afghanistan, a greater Iran, a 
greater Turkey. As a minimum, Turkey dreams of Azerbaijan and 
the Caucasus, of Georgia, so as to become a land of four seas -- 
the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, the Caspian, and the Sea of 
Marmara, and even the Aegean. And Russia loses everything -- 
the "great and talented" Turkish people deserve to live at the 
very center of the world, in a fragrant region, on the shores of 
six seas, while the weak, impotent Russian people should perish. 
Is that how you determine the history of mankind? No, that is 
impossible. 
  Nothing will happen to the world even if the entire 
Turkish nation perishes, although I do not wish that upon it. 
But let the Turks remember how they came to Asia Minor, 
barbarously seized Constantinople and plundered it, and 
butchered and subjugated all the peoples inhabiting Asia 
Minor. Let them remember how they butchered 1.5 million 
Armenians in April 1915. Let them remember that, and let 
mankind's conscience shudder when a whole people is butchered in 
three nights. And millions of Kurds languish under the Turkish 
yoke and cannot live in a Kurdish state. A bitter fate has 
divided them. A large number live in eastern Anatolia, in 
Turkish territory, while some live in the territory of Syria, 
northern Iraq, western Iran, and the Transcaucasus. This is a 
people 30 millions strong. And they have the right to gain 
national freedom. And who can give them that right? Only 
Russia. 
  The aggressor and his victim cannot be placed in the same 
pan 
of the scales today. We must finally understand who brought 
civilization to this world. Who opened up outer space; and who 
occupied foreign countries, plundered other peoples, drove them 
into slavery, and burned Christian churches or turned them into 
mosques. 
  What culture did the Turks bring to the territory of Asia 
Minor? Tourists from the West traveling in Turkey are to this 
day shown the remains of Byzantine culture. There is no such 
thing as Turkish culture, culture does not go with the bare 
saber. And who formed the basis of the new Turkish Army? The 
Janissaries. What were they? Slav boys taken captive along 
with their parents. The parents were killed, but the boys were 
raised in the Turkish spirit and formed the might of their 
forces. It was a strange thing for Slav boys to wipe out Slav 
peoples under Turkish flags. Who will answer for that? Who 
will pay for the violence against Byzantine culture, against the 
Slav peoples? There was no Nuremberg trial for the Turks who 
committed genocide against the Armenian people. Yet what is the 
difference between Turks and Germans? The fascist regime was to 
blame for 50 million deaths. There were only 70-80 million 
Germans. It was the same when the 17-million-strong Turkish 
people annihilated 1.5 million Armenians. The proportion is the 
same. The Turks brought as much evil upon mankind as the 
Germans. But the Germans, their party, their ideology, were put 
on trial. They were placed under international tutelage. There 
are still troops in Germany to this day. But nobody punished 
the Turks. It seems you can annihilate the Armenians because 
they are a small people. But you cannot annihilate the French, 
the Russians, or the English, you will be put on trial for that. 
All peoples are equal. Nobody is permitted to perpetrate 
genocide. Today Georgia is annihilating the Abkhaz and the 
Ossetians, and Europe is silent. Go ahead, crush Sukhumi with 
tanks. Dismember Abkhaz bodies. After all, your leader 
Shevardnadze helped to shake the USSR's position in Europe and 
to shatter the USSR's military might throughout the world. And 
in gratitude for this, Mr. Shevardnadze is permitted to engage 
in political gangsterism. There are not many Abkhaz, but they 
are a people, they want to live, to live in their own land and 
freely. But they are deprived of that right. This is genocide, 
it is racism, it is fascism, and it is happening today. Who 
will stop all this? 
  And what about the clashes between Azerbaijanis and 
Armenians? How long will this go on? Until the Armenian people 
are wiped out. Only not by Turks this time, but by 
Azerbaijanis. Another Turkic-speaking people. After all, 
basically Azerbaijanis and Turks are the same thing. In 1915 
the Turks butchered 1.5 million Armenians, and the Azerbaijanis 
have been butchering them since February 1986, that is five 
years now. The Turks did it in three nights, but the 
Azerbaijanis will go on for 15 years. And they will try to wipe 
out the Armenians totally, so as ultimately to wipe out the 
Armenian state entirely. Why? Because it is a Christian state. 
It is preventing two Turkic-speaking peoples, the Azerbaijanis 
and the Turks, from uniting. What is Nakhichevan? It is an 
artificial formation. An Azerbaijani population on Armenian 
territory. That was Armenia of old, that has always been 
Armenia. A land of three seas -- the Caspian, the Black Sea, the 
Mediterranean. And what has become of Armenia today? A little 
belt of land is all that remains of a great state, a state with 
a great culture, it was the first slaveowning state on the 
territory of what is now Russia. 
  Urartu. A civilization began there, and spread further. Its 
own church. Its own script. As for the Azerbaijanis, they are 
a Persian tribe who rose to the top as conquerors. At that time 
the Turks were advancing from the east. They Turkicized this 
Persian tribe. What are the Azerbaijanis? A tribe that lived 
on the shores of the Caspian Sea -- in Khazer [as 
transliterated]. That is not the name of a country, it 
designates a locality where citizens live. It is like the 
inhabitants of Sokolniki -- that is not a nationality, it is 
just a district of Moscow. It is the same with Azerbaijan. It 
is an inhabited region on the shores of the Caspian Sea. 
  So there is nothing to reproach the Russians with. We do 
not intend to punish the Turkish, Iranian, or Afghan peoples. 
But we want freedom for the peoples who live in the south. But 
today the whole of the south is bathed in blood. And the 
guardians of the Islamic revolution are wiping out all the 
dissidents in Iran. They made war on Iraq for 10 years. What 
for? For what purpose? The Kurds' actions in pursuit of 
freedom have been suppressed for 10 years. Turkish forces bomb 
civilians from the air, they crush Kurdish settlements with 
tanks. So let the Kurdish people perish -- and they are by no 
means a small people. There are 30 million of them. A big 
state, by European standards. But Europe is silent. Relations 
with Ankara are advantageous to it. There is your European 
"hazing." Let us close our eyes to the Kurdish problem, and 
then the Turks will have good relations with us Europeans. And 
what did the Turks do with the communists? They lured them into 
boats, took them out into the Black Sea, slaughtered them, and 
threw the bodies into the sea. That is how to deal with the 
political opposition. And that's democracy? That is barbarity, 
that is savagery. 
  Lenin thought Kemal was a Turkish Bolshevik. He gave him 
weapons and money. What was the result? In World War II Turkey 
was supposed to attack the Caucasus, and many of our troops were 
there waiting for this attack. The Turkish command had all its 
plans ready. Stalin's mistake was not to punish Turkey at the 
end of World War II. Turkey should have been punished, it was 
to blame for the deaths of many Russian soldiers at the 
Klukhorskiy Pass and other Caucasus crossings, because Beriya 
did not allow the fresh Transcaucasian divisions to be used to 
help the northern Caucasus in the fight against the Germans who 
were surging toward Groznyy, Baku, Makhachkala -- all because of 
the threat of attack from the Turks. So Turkey really did take 
part in World War II, just like Japan, which we punished. But 
only because the Americans wanted that. Japan attacked Pearl 
Harbor. The Turks did not attack Vienna or Paris, so nobody 
demanded punishment for Turkey. Yet Turkey hindered our war on 
the Germans. Because of Turkey's stance, more of our soldiers 
died and more of our territories were seized. So Turkey was 
also a participant in World War II on the side of fascist 
Germany. But it was not punished. 
  There may be a different opinion and different views on 
this. 
And who will be the judge? Will we Russians be wrong to defend 
the Armenians not only as Christians, but as a people who have 
over many centuries been undergoing destruction from the south, 
east, and west? Will we be wrong if we give freedom to the 
Kurdish people and the Baluchis? Will we not be right to make 
it possible for Uzbeks, Tajiks, Pushtuns, and Daris to live in 
that whole area -- from Tashkent to Kabul -- to live freely and 
go where they want, as long as there are no gangs. Will they 
not be grateful to us? And southern Azerbaijan, for the 
opportunity of unification with northern Azerbaijan? It is one 
Azerbaijani people. But there are around 16 million of them 
living in northern Iran, and they cannot speak their native 
language and consider themselves Azerbaijanis. What about the 
Baluchis? What about the Arabs in the southern part of Iran? 
They will all be grateful to us, including the Persians, 
including the Turks. Because today they live on the island of 
Cyprus as if in a fortress under siege. It is a Greek island, 
it was never Turkish. And it should become Greek again. It 
should be a free Cypriot republic, or else part of Greece. But 
Cyprus should not be occupied by Turkish troops. How many 
Greeks were wiped out? How many Greek women were raped? They 
can tell you that in Athens. Did the Dardanelles ever belong to 
the Turks? It always belonged to Greece. And Thrace? That is 
the territory of Bulgaria and Greece. So why are the occupiers 
still there from the period when the great powers were at war 
among themselves? Now that we are going over to regional 
cooperation, everything could be returned to its rightful place 
here. So that there will be no labels -- aggressor, occupier. 
And the Turks can live throughout that area, they can come back 
as far as Tashkent and Ashgabat, to Karakalpakia, further down, 
to the Aral Sea -- to where they came from in the quest for 
better lands. 
  But you should improve the lands where you were born and 
where you live, rather than seizing other people's cities and 
countries by wiping out the citizens who live there and wiping 
out that culture. To this day they have created nothing in Asia 
Minor to replace what was once there. Asia Minor, Greece, Rome, 
Mesopotamia, Egypt -- all this was under Turkish dominion, all 
this was seized by force and languished in slavery for 
centuries. And only Russia liberated North Africa and southern 
Europe from Turkish dominion, from Ottoman domination. Millions 
of people are grateful to Russia for this to this day. So is 
Russia not capable of one last gesture, and should it not 
accomplish that gesture? Make one more push, a small push to 
the south, so that Russian railroads can be laid there and the 
trains can run -- Moscow to Delhi, Moscow to Kabul, Moscow to 
the Indian Ocean, Moscow to Tehran, Moscow to Baghdad, Moscow to 
Ankara -- run day and night, carrying freight and people there 
and back, and all in safe conditions. All for the economy, for 
the development of culture. 
  We must exclude the possibility of the outbreak of war in 
this region, exclude the threat of destruction of the region's 
peoples, bring them freedom and reliable conditions for 
development. The Germans want this, they will agree. Today, 
they themselves do not know what to do with 4 million Turks. 
And many Gypsies, Romanians, Czechs, and Russians have recently 
been added to that. What are they to do with that number of 
foreigners? The Germans are returning from Russia to Germany. 
We are creating a crisis for Germany, fascist parties are 
springing up there again. And we in Russia are responsible for 
this too. If we make this "southern dash," we will stop the 
exodus of Russian Germans to Germany and we will promote the 
Turks' return home from Germany. We are prepared to accept 
Turkish workers in our country too, some are already working in 
Moscow and other regions. So all our actions with regard to the 
south are well thought out; they have a geopolitical, national, 
and ideological justification. 
  This could be assessed as a discovery by political science 
with the aim of establishing new conditions in our region and 
exerting a subsequent favorable influence on the entire world 
order. All the world's capitals will understand us. I have 
spoken about this with Americans, French, Germans, Japanese, 
Greeks, Serbs -- with many people. The Finns, again -- Vyborg 
could be theirs, it will be Viipuri again. They may have 
certain priorities in Karelia. So there is reassurance for 
northern Europe. Germany will gain the opportunity to 
reestablish East Prussia on the basis of the territory of Poland 
-- part of it. And maybe take part of Moravia from the Czech 
Republic. And the Germans will be reassured and will never move 
eastward again. And if we stop the flow of our Germans to 
Germany, and are even able, on the contrary, to take from them 
some of their unemployed population who cannot find an 
occupation -- doctors, architects, engineers. In Germany there 
is a shortage of manual workers, but an excess of specialists. 
They could be summoned here, to Russia, to the regions of 
Central Asia, for joint exploitation of resources -- space, oil, 
industrial construction, farming. We would take back our 
Germans -- there are 2 million of them -- and take an additional 
3 million or so. It would be advantageous to France too. We 
would help it to rid itself of the American and Zionist 
influence. Otherwise, by the next century, by the year 2000, 
the capital of France will have turned into an Arab city. 
Because the Algerians are surreptitiously taking over Paris and 
going beyond that. Europe needs our help. 
  A great historical mission has fallen to Russia. It may be 
its last. After that, it must go over to the resolution of 
purely national tasks, the development of infrastructures, the 
construction of good roads, storage facilities, cold stores, 
transport arteries, communications networks, and new housing 
construction. Russia will in part become a single-story country 
again -- with cottages, saunas, garages, country estates, 
gardens. These are better conditions for existence than these 
stone jungles and concrete blocks. It will be a good thing for 
India, because the conflict with Pakistan will end. Russia will 
acquire a border with India. The conflicts will cease between 
Mongolia and China, China and Southeast Asia, China and India. 
Japan will finally define its position in terms of its own 
national interests. There will be reassurance for everyone. 
South Africa will have guarantees of the existence of a White 
republic in southern Africa. 
  But nobody will help Russia itself. Even America may turn 
out to need Russia's help. The expansion of Spanish speakers 
from Mexico and other Latin countries in the north [as 
published] of the United States and the multiplication of the 
black population, which could reach 40-50 million; together, 
this already totals around 100 million. Half of America will be 
colored. And in the longer term, bearing in mind that the 
colored population increases more rapidly, there will be a 
further growth of crime in America, the destruction of the white 
population and the simultaneous multiplication of the colored 
population. And who knows whether America will not ask for a 
helping hand from Russia in the mid-21st century? But Russia 
must quickly become a healthy, strong, powerful state, which 
must have ocean expanses on its borders. The Pacific Ocean is 
not warm, but it washes Russia's Far Eastern borders. Then 
there is the longest border in the world -- with China. That 
border should be calm once and for all, because China is 
oriented toward the south, not the north. Friendly India. And 
finally, the Indian Ocean. And friendly Iraq. And in the West 
-- those countries that will gain advantages. Romania might get 
something -- say, a little piece of Moldavia. Hungary could 
have a little bit of Romania, and something in Transcarpathia. 
The Poles seem to be losers, because they would like to have 
Lvov, but the West Ukrainian Republic needs Lvov. And the 
Germans will crowd out the Poles. Maybe there will be something 
to suit Poland in the region of Volyn and Brest. 
  We could resolve all these questions for our western and 
eastern neighbors, and the southeastern neighbors, but only on 
one condition -- first Russia gets what it needs; the same with 
trade -- first the goods come to Russia, and then we make 
concessions to our neighbors. And only after checking the 
quality and quantity of the goods. And prepayment. For Russia 
to concede something, and for Russia then to be let down -- we 
will not accept that. The "Democratic Russians" accepted that. 
Gorbachev and Yeltsin made all kinds of concessions to the 
West, the United States, the CIA, Israel. And what did they get 
in exchange? Nothing. Nothing, they were let down. Neither 
the Stavropol bear nor the Ural bear knows how to make a deal. 
A different kind of intellect is needed here. "A different 
kind of thinking is needed here" -- Gorbachev was right there. 
Only not the thinking of a kolkhoz member's son, the grandson 
of a Stavropol kolkhoz chairman. What is needed here is a man 
who thinks on a cosmic scale, at the very least a planetary 
scale. Then a result could be achieved which will lead to a 
reasonable kind of existence and the implementation of a 
geopolitical formula to ensure the interests of the majority on 
the planet. 
  And this is the formula we have spoken of in the pages of 
our 
book -- it is crucial to the success of world politics at the 
end of the 20th century. And we will enter the 21st century 
with new principles, new views of world politics, of the policy 
of regional cooperation. We will cease to make mutual 
accusations, we will cease to demand compensation for debts, we 
must promote harmonious relations; as in nature. We do not want 
a burning sun, but it is hard for us to be constantly amid 
gloomy weather. We do not want torrential rain -- a light 
summer drizzle is enough; we do not want snowstorms and 
hurricanes -- a light snow, fluffy and rapidly melting, is 
enough. 
  Fewer political disasters. Rule out war. Let there be 
conflicts between neighbors -- over whose goat or hog escaped 
into someone else's kitchen garden and ate up their swedes. But 
no ransom demands for the bodies of hostages seized during 
clashes. An end must be put to that situation forever. Just as 
Russia once put an end to the plague, cholera, and tuberculosis. 
But recently these diseases have reappeared in some places. 
Because we failed to maintain the correct regime -- a hygienic 
regime, medical controls, correct nutrition for the population. 
We have let our house fall into disorder, and diseases have 
begun to appear. It is the same in politics. Minimal conflicts 
are possible -- maybe over the route of ships in the warm 
Mediterranean Sea. Maybe some fishermen will accidentally stray 
into someone's territorial waters. These disputes are possible, 
but they will be resolved by arbitration. The main thing is 
that the guns must be silent. Lethal shells must not rain down 
on our citizens' heads from above. 
  It is sometimes reported in dispatches that women, old men, 
and children have been killed -- as if this is an aggravating 
circumstance. But is the death of young men a normal 
phenomenon? The flower of the nation is dying. Nobody should 
die. Numbers have nothing to do with it. If a plane is shot 
down and only the pilot dies -- it is just as much a tragedy as 
if 50, 100, or 200 people had died. Everyone's life should be 
precious. If 1 billion, 100 million people live in China and 50 
million die, there will still be a great many Chinese. Whereas 
if 6 million die in the Czech Republic, there will be no Czech 
Republic left. This approach is unacceptable. You cannot 
divide people and nations into great and not great. We must 
move toward a civil society. We are all citizens of our planet. 
We are all citizens of earth. We are Europeans, Asians, 
Africans, Americans -- we are Russians. We must live and act 
under the shelter of the law. Only this can save us. But we 
must take a final, decisive step. We must establish new borders 
and finally share out spheres of influence, so that we have no 
clashes of interstate interests. And that would not lead to 
wars. We must end all wars at the end of the 20th century and 
enter the third millenium with only minor private conflicts 
between individual citizens. And the decisive factor is: In no 
circumstances must a person's nationality be used as a 
discriminating factor. 
  So, a civil society. So, planetary thinking. The 
safeguarding of rights for each and every one. Freedom in 
everything and for everyone. But limited by a law that operates 
in time and space throughout our planet, which could be a 
blossoming and fragrant planet, but could also become a scorched 
desert with charred remnants of trees and houses. It all 
depends on us alone. 
  Moscow and Washington must realize that you cannot wait any 
longer, you cannot experiment, you cannot dismember Russia, 
because that means the ruin of Europe and of mankind. We must 
put an end to interference in the internal affairs of other 
peoples and countries, and share out spheres of influence for 
the last time. Let Russia successfully accomplish its 
last "dash" to the south. I see Russian soldiers gathering for 
this last southern campaign. I see Russian commanding officers 
in the headquarters of Russian divisions and armies, sketching 
the lines of march of troop formations and the end points of 
their marches. I see planes at airbases in the southern 
districts of Russia. I see submarines surfacing off the shores 
of the Indian Ocean and landing craft approaching the shores, 
where soldiers of the Russian Army are already marching, 
infantry combat vehicles are advancing, and vast numbers of 
tanks are on the move. Russia is at last accomplishing its 
final military campaign. War is excluded forever from the south 
for Russia, and in the north it has long been impossible. People 
in the West will understand that. And people in the East will 
understand it too.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "CIS" rubric: </F>
"Federation Council Delegation to Interparliamentary Assembly 
Named. `Russia Remains Main Sponsor of Legislation'"] 
  [Text] The Federation Council has prepared a list of its 
representatives to attend the upcoming meeting of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly [IPA]. The delegation will 
apparently include Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko; 
Vadim Gustov, chairman of the Federation Council's committee for 
CIS affairs; Yevgeniy Pavlov, his deputy; and Viktor Stepanov, 
Federation Council member and chairman of the Karelian Supreme 
Soviet. 
  Vadim Gustov recalled that the meeting of CIS parliamentary 
heads at St. Petersburg on 8-9 February will focus on the 
election of an Interparliamentary Assembly chairman "to replace 
the departed Ruslan Khasbulatov." According to Gustov, reports 
that Vladimir Shumeyko has recently offered the post of "CIS 
speaker" to the "fired" Stanislav Shushkevich "do not square 
with reality, because this post can only be held by an acting 
head of parliament." He said that "talk about Shushkevich took 
place before all the recent events." 
  The chairman of the Federation Council's committee for CIS 
affairs listed legislative enactments that would be worked out 
under "Russia's sponsorship." Some of them are based on the CIS 
"Treaty on Collective Security" (many provisions of which 
Stanislav Shushkevich opposed as speaker of the Belarusian 
Supreme Soviet); they include enactments on the procedure for 
imposing martial law on CIS territory, "On Mobilization," "On 
the Procedure for the Development, Production, Testing, and 
Delivery of Armaments and Military Hardware," and so forth. 
  The IPA plenary session scheduled for the beginning of March 
will set up a number of commissions which, the CIS committee 
chairman assured, "Russia will join, bringing all its ideas 
along, because in the light of its experience it has always been 
and will be the main source and drafter of legislation within 
the CIS."

  [Text] Minsk February 2 TASS -- A meeting of the 
parliamentary assembly of the CIS will be held in the Tavria 
Palace in St. Petersburg on February 8-9. The delegations will 
be represented by heads of parliament of CIS countries. The 
assembly will concentrate on debating the candidature of 
chairman of the interparliamentary assembly, Ivan Korotchenya, 
executive secretary of the CIS, told BELINFORM. Korotchenya

Shumeyko, Russian representatives, being appointed chairman of 
the parliamentary assembly. 
  The 15 items planned to be debated include legal regulation 
of relations between the CIS countries in the framework of the 
economic union -- coordination and unification of the economic

  [Text] A spokesman for the Black Sea Navy Command has 
called on Ukrainian naval officials to refrain from "dangerous 
assessments running counter to the opinion of the Russian and 
Ukrainian presidents and to the spirit of the Russian-Ukrainian 
naval accords. [no closing quotation marks as received] 
  This statement came in reply to a cable addressed to the 
Naval Headquarters Chief, Vice-Admiral Svyatashov, by his 
Ukrainian counterpart, Rear-Admiral Ryzhenko, who has described 
the Black Sea Marine Brigade as "a foreign unit on Ukraine's 
territory." 
  The spokesman emphasized that in line with the Yalta 
agreement, the brigade, like the entire fleet, is subordinate to 
the Ukrainian president. Thus, Ryzhenko's declaration 
contradicts the document signed by the president as the Supreme 
Commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 2 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the 
state of affairs in the Viktor Chernomyrdin cabinet: 
  "Observers note the consolidation of the positions of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin who has evolved from a business executive premier 
to a politician-premier. He is reckoned a person capable of 
guaranteeing stability in society, which is so importnat to 
President Boris Yeltsin now. Chernomyrdin is backed, albeit 
with reservations, by the president, the leaders of regions, 
autonomous entities, the Federation Council, by many deputies to 
the State Duma, and by executives of powerful ministries..." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with security 
Council Secretary Oleg Lobov, who comments on the work of the 
commission for the certification of the leading personnel of 
Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service. 
  Asked about criteria for the certification of officers, 
Lobov 
said: "A thorough selection is under way on the strength of 
criteria which are applied to counterintelligence service 
personnel, primarily professional ones. 
  "The commission takes into account the ability to get one's 
bearings under new conditions, knowledge, and experience. 
Political views will also be taken into consideration, of 
course to judge to what extent a person seeking a job in the 
newly established service supports the reform policy". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the demographic situation in Russia. 
  The newspaper carries an article headlined "A Demographic 
Disaster Has Become a Reality. According to Even Most 
Optimistic Forecasts, the Russian Population Decrease Will Not 
Come to a Stop Earlier Than 1997". 
  "Owing to discrepancy between mounting mortality and 
decreasing birth rate, the Russian Federation (particularly its 
Russian- populated regions) is clearly defined as a country with 
a population decline. Over the first half of 1993 alone, the 
population of Russians decreased by 352,000, and the process 
rapidly accelerates." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on former parliamentary opposition 
leader's hunger strike: 
  "Ilya Konstantinov, leader of the National Salvation Front 
and former leader of the parliamentary opposition, who is kept 
in the Lefortovo Prison, went on a hunger strike on Tuesday. 
  "In the morning of January 31, he wrote an application 
addressed to the investigator and the prosecutor-general, in 
which he pointed out that, firstly, he was arrestted unlawfully 
because he was entitled to parliamentary immunity -- at any 
rate, it remained in effect until the latest elections -- at 
the moment of the arrest -- and, secondly, there are no 
investigation proceedings with regard to Kosntantinov..." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Daoud Barakat, 
the ambassador of Palestine to the Russian Federation, who 
touches upon matters concerning the Middle East peace process. 
His opinion is that "Russian interests in the Middle East are 
no longer of as great importance to Russia as they used to be. 
Neverthless Russia is a reliable partner in the Mideast peace 
process". 
  IZVESTIYA on the start of elections to local governemnt 
bodies: 
  "Penza region has been one of the first to hold the 
elections. The outcome is disquieting: nomenclatura (former 
Communist Party and industrial appointees) have gained the upper 
hand. Forty out of 45 seats in the regional legislature have 
been gained by former secretaries of Communist Party committees 
and deputies to the abolished local governing councils, 
administration chiefs and deputy chiefs, and directors of state 
farms and factories." 
  IZVESTIYA on the problem of inflation: 
  "The rate of inflation somewhat slowed down by the end of 
January compared to rather high weekly inflation rates recorded 
at the beginning and the middle of the month. Over the period 
of January 18 to 25, prices went up by 3.4 percent. 
Nevertheless the overall inflation rate since the beginning of 
the year is almost 21 percent" 
  TRUD runs an interview with former Belarusian parliament 
chief Stanislav Shushkevich, who said in particular that those 
who expect a Russian magic wand to save them would "badly 
miscalculate in the end. I view the merger of the monetary 
systems as a forced act but still an act of inter-state 
relations. I do not visualise this merger as surrender of 
statehood, which government officials maintain in their 
market-related helplessness" 
  TRUD carries an interview with Sergey Almazov, director of 
the tax police department. 
  "The results of our work are determined not only by the 
amount of revealed or prevented tax-related offences but also by 
a real income to the state budget," Almazov said. 
  "Last year, together with the state taxation service, we 
spotted and prevented more than 15,000 breaches of tax 
legislation. We revealed more than 1,000 enterprises and 
organisations which were not registered in state taxation 
agencies. It has been estimated that there are 100 roubles of 
revenue per rouble invested by the state in the maintenance of 
tax police". 
  St. Petersburg VEDOMOSTI reports that the Greens Party has 
won a suit in the regional court against the Leningrad region 
administration in a demand for the reversal of the decision to 
allot land for the construction of an Ust Luga merchant seaport. 
  Ilya Baskin, president of the Garant holding company, which 
intends to build a seaport at Ust Luga with the aid of 
investors, believes that the court ruling would not stop the 
cport construction process but will only make it difficult. The 
company has filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of the 
Russian Federation.

  [Text] Moscow February 3 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's Russian 
newspapers focus on President Boris Yeltsin's official visit to 
Georgia. 
  In this connection, the TRUD newspaper publishes opinions of 
some Georgian parliament members. All of them point to the 
importance of Yeltsin's arrival in Tbilisi. "Ruslan Beridze 
hopes that the sides will find ways for mutually advantageous 
relations during the visit," the newspaper stresses. 
  "In addition, Russia, provided there is a desire, can play a 
decisive role in a just political settlement of the Abkhazian 
issue." However, the legislator claims, Georgia's admission to 
the rouble zone would mean for the republic the loss of a main 
attribute of an independent state -- national currency. 
  In the opinion of Irina Starishvili, the solution of the 
Abkhazian-Georgian conflict entirely depends on Russia after 
Georgia joined the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
  However, the legislator is against the rouble zone and 
believes that, even if Georgia joins it, the state will be 
unable to narrow the gap between prices and wages. 
  "The Russian president's visit to Tbilisi may become one of 
the most difficult trips in Yeltsin's diplomatic career," the 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes. "The rouble threatens to 
turn from a 'semi-currency' into a mixture of the Belarusian 
`hare' (Eds: the image of a hare is depicted on Belarusian 
currency) and the Ukrainian coupon. 
  "Geopolitical successes turn to be futile as soon as 
attention is focussed on the domestic situation in Russia. 
Boris Yeltsin goes to the deadend of the Russian policy in the 
caucasus," the newspaper writes. 
  "The signing of an agreement on the status of Russian border 
troops in Georgia will be an important element of the visit," 
the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper notes. "Let us hope that the 
agreement will put an end to numerous `misunderstandings' with 
respect to Russian servicemen." 
  The newspaper calls attention to the fact that "short before 
the arrival of the Russian president, Eduard Shevardnadze issued 
personal orders to return immediately all flats to Russian Army 
officers, illegally seized by various armed detachments during 
the recent strife". 
  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev stressed in an 
exclusive interview with the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper on the 
eve of the Russian president's official visit to Georgia that 
"the military delegation will raise the question at the talks on 
the responsibility of nationalist extremist forces whose actions 
resulted in the death of Russian servicemen". 
  The presidential elections in the Crimea is another 
important 
topic discussed by Russian newspapers. In the opinion of the 
IZVESTIYA newspaper, "Crimeans saw the way out of the crisis in 
unification with Russia" by electing Yuriy Meshkov as president. 
  "The implementaton of Meshkov's election platform -- 
accession to the rouble zone, payment of pensions and wages in 
roubles, a referendum on the status of the Crimea, solution of 
the problem of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol and 
establishment of a new union state -- will depend on the extent 
to which the new president will find a common language with 
statesmen from Kiev and Moscow and the extent to which his 
proposals will be economically feasible." 
  The newspaper stresses that "two issues -- the problem of 
Crimean Tatars and the status of the Crimea -- will be sources 
of tension which the new president will find impossible to avoid 
or put off". 
  Touching on the coming meeting between Crimean President 
Meshkov and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA expresses opinion that "Meshkov ducks the question on the 
need for holding a Crimean referendum on independence. 
  "He also avoids the question of concluding a treaty with 
Russia on duel citizenship. Local analysts believe that the 
Crimean president will not change anything in relations with 
Ukraine in order to avoid unnecessary confrontation," the 
newspaper writes. "It becomes evident that it will be difficult 
for Meshkov to implement his election promises." 
  Writing on the same topic, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA notes that 
"there is no need for dramatising the departure of Bagrov (Eds: 
Bagrov was a presidential candidate and former speaker of the 
Crimean parliament before presidential elections) from the 
political scene. 
  "Meshkov clearly intimated to journalists and voters the 
next 
day after his election as president that his position on the key 
political and economic problems of the Crimea would not differ 
much from that of his former rival. 
  "He does not intend to make a drastic reshuffling of the 
government and administrative structures as well as to 
exacerbate relations with Kiev and hence "to join" the Crimea to 
Russia." 
  "What is the explanation for the present wave of crime?" 
This 
question was addressed to St. Petersburg citizens by the 
sociological research centre in the city. 
  As many as 40 per cent of respondents attributed rampant 
crime to dropping living standards, the same number -- to 
passivity of authorities, 36 per cent -- to the loss of ideals 
and morals and 30 per cent -- lack of discipline as well as law 
and order. 
  Publishing the results of the poll, the SANKT PETERBURGSKIE 
VEDOMOSTI newspaper notes that, although citizens did not single 
out specially one of the reasons, growing numbers of respondents 
point to the loss of moral ideals with every passing year. 
  The VECHERNIY PETERBURG newspaper reports that the St. 
petersburg procurator's office issued a charge against Viktor 
Kharchenko, the former president of the Baltic shipping line 
joint stock society. 
  Despite expectations of his numerous supporters, the 
ex-president of the joint stock society faces "an array" of 
articles from the criminal code, providing criminal 
responsibility for abuse of power and office, negligence, 
forgery, evasion of tax payments in large sums and, last but not 
least, embezzlement of state and public property on a large 
scale.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuliya Mostovaya: "Partnership for Peace -- </F>
Insurance Policy Without Guarantees. Does Ukraine Need It?"] 
  [Text] We drew similar castles in our childhood -- 
graceful and inaccessible, hoisting tower spires tipped with 
cast iron flags and weathervanes into the sky over Brussels. 
There are not many trees in the city, but those we saw were 
decoratively trimmed. Their leafless limbs would have finally 
convinced us of the fabulousness of the city if their gothic 
crowns had not been ornamented with neon lights by Cartier, 
Gucci, or Citroen... During our four-day visit in Brussels, we 
did not have the opportunity to see Brussels in daylight. A 
Ukrainian delegation headed by Supreme Council Deputy Chairman 
Vasyl Durdynets would leave its hotel early in the morning, and 
when it was returning after a strenuous day filled with 
negotiations, briefings, and consultations, it would already be 
dark. Although it was an unofficial visit, the delegation 
included presidential advisers, an aide to the defense minister, 
and top officials from the Foreign Ministry. The visit had been 
organized and prepared by the Ukrainian Center for Studying 
Issues of International Security. The main goal of the visit 
was to obtain as much information as possible about the 
"Partnership for Peace" -- the latest NATO initiative -- which, 
in the opinion of NATO politicians, generals of the NATO Allied 
Forces Command in Europe, representatives of the North Atlantic 
Assembly, and all the people with whom the Ukrainian delegation 
met, "should build not barriers but bridges." 
  "Let us get involved in combat, and later we will see," used 
to say an outstanding commander. Ukraine did this by announcing 
its support for the "Partnership for Peace" immediately after a 
NATO summit, at which leaders of 16 members of the bloc had 
decided what to do with Eastern and Central European countries 
knocking on NATO's doors. As is known, it had been decided at 
the summit not to open the doors but to let them look from 
behind the fence. Certain countries have received the NATO (or 
rather U.S.) initiative as a nice surprise, other states such as 
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary have seen it 
as a big disappointment. Why? First of all, because they wanted 
to receive security guaranties from NATO, to outdistance 
unstable, bordering Russia, to ensure themselves against 
possible adventures from internal opposition, and to quiet the 
issue of redrawing borders, which has recently been voiced more 
and more often. However, the status of countries that are to 
join the "Partnership for Peace" is much more different than the 
one of the 16 permanent NATO members. Whereas the main goal of 
NATO has always been to protect its members from outside 
aggression, the "Partnership for Peace" does not mention any 
protection. This is the first point. Additionally, while 
soberly assessing reality, it becomes obvious that countries of 
the former Warsaw Pact are not in conflict with the West but 
with one another. Presuming that membership in NATO would 
prevent these conflicts from becoming more radical, they wanted 
to merge with NATO. However, many NATO officials with whom we 
met in Brussels emphasized that the Allied Forces defend the 
bloc members from external attack, not interfering in internal 
conflicts among themselves. Usually, they would cite the 
example of Turkey and Greece in this regard. This way, even if 
small countries of the former Warsaw Pact became NATO members, 
this would not have any influence on, for example, relations 
between Romania and Hungary. It is not even worth recalling 
that the "Partnership for Peace" does not provide such 
guarantees. 
  One should not hope that this initiative can prevent 
possible 
aggression from Russia (in case the ideas of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia prevail). Moreover, the "Partnership 
for Peace" is a compromise between two superpowers; one of them 
dominates in the West, the other -- in the East. Undoubtedly, 
the United States, which plays first fiddle in NATO, was not 
against extending its sphere of influence to countries of 
Eastern and Central Europe. However, officials in Washington and 
Brussels take into account, first of all, the unstable situation 
in those countries, which may crack the monolith of the bloc, 
and second, the danger of isolating Russia. After all, I, 
personally, do not have any doubts that NATO does not want to 
infuriate Russia. Unfortunately, countries of the former USSR, 
except for the Baltics and Ukraine, unconditionally approve 
Russia's sphere of influence. Brussels is far more interested 
in the above-mentioned republics and countries which border with 
NATO countries. When the talks touched upon using NATO's 
peacekeeping forces under the aegis of UN or CSCE, a NATO 
official stated that the Western troops will never crisscross 
borders of the former USSR. In general, in his opinion, 
peacekeeping operations in this region should be conducted by a 
state which has direct interests there, and NATO apparently does 
not have any interests in our region, and the more so in the 
Asian part of the CIS. "We did not even know how to spell 
Tajikistan," admitted another NATO official. Yet, for the sake 
of justice, it must be admitted that there are also differing 
opinions in Brussels. For instance, one of the officials of the 
International Secretariat said that, in case a conflict erupts 
in the Crimea, NATO will not stand by indifferently. 
Nevertheless, the "Partnership for Peace" does not downgrade 
Russia's interests on "its territory." Hence, the following 
question arises: What are the real provisions of this idea? 
  The Ukrainian delegation could not obtain an exhaustive 
answer, since NATO officials also do not have an idea with what 
the framework of "Partnership for Peace" will be filled. The 
idea was formulated not long ago, and it became officially 
presented on the occasion of the visit by comrade Clinton to 
Europe. It is expected that countries that will participate in 
the initiative will conduct military training and form 
peacekeeping forces in cooperation with NATO. The process of 
joint activities should lead to rapprochement of military 
authorities, strategic plans, and technical equipment. Only 
after this preparatory period, which, in the opinion of NATO 
generals, will take eight or 10 years, admission of new NATO 
members may be addressed. During the next several months, a 
structure for encouraging friendly relations among countries 
that have applied for membership in the "Partnership for Peace" 
and NATO will be established. Officers-representatives of 
"Partnership for Peace" members and 16 NATO countries will work 
out this structure. As of today, this all the information that 
is available, and it is followed by an array of unanswered 
questions. Among them are, for example, the following ones: 
What effect will the participation of CIS countries in the 
"Partnership for Peace" have on the CIS collective security 
system? In which countries and how often will training be 
conducted? (This is not an inappropriate question, since, for 
example, Poland would not like to host German troops on its 
territory during joint military training. There is also 
suspicion that many countries, particularly former socialist 
states, will not be delighted by the presence of Russian units 
on their territories.) What expenditures are needed to reach 
comparable standards of technical equipment? What will the 
procedures be for admitting new countries to NATO, following the 
"preparatory period?": Will they be admitted all at once or 
separately? (According to Western politicians, the "Partnership 
for Peace" was not been meant as an affront to anyone.) 
  A great many things depend on the answer to the last 
question. After all, as of today, NATO is not in the best years 
of its existence. Not the Warsaw Pact but the common taxpayer 
has become its worst enemy by refusing to finance defense 
expenditures since the collapse of the totalitarian system. By 
the year 1995, the number of NATO Allied Forces will have been 
reduced by 25 percent, and certain units -- even by 45 percent. 
  The lack of a common enemy may boil down NATO to a UN 
military unit designed to protect or reestablish peace in 
troubled points. It has not been ruled out that, having expanded 
itself to the entire northern hemisphere, NATO will catch a 
second breath while facing a potential South-North conflict. 
Still, NATO is the only guarantee for stability in Western 
Europe, and this alone is sufficient justification for its 
existence in today's unstable times. 
  Nonetheless, the concept of global security is as follows: 
The times of blocs have gone. For many, it is hard to realize 
that. Not taking into account the fact that the "Partnership for 
Peace" was meant to calm Russia's fury but considering it as a 
bridge unifying the entire northern hemisphere from Vancouver to 
Vladivostok, it becomes clear that Ukraine should participate in 
it. After all, the system of global security is to last dozens 
of years, and we should participate in digging its foundation. 
It is particularly important to realize this today, when the 
"Partnership for Peace" is merely an insurance policy without 
any guarantees for Ukraine, and we do not have money to pay for 
it. Ukraine itself will have to finance military training and 
the modernization of equipment, since NATO is not interested in 
our outdated defense industry complex or TU-160 airplanes. 
Therefore, the decision concerning Ukraine's participation in 
the "Partnership for Peace" is a political decision aimed at a 
long perspective rather than the present moment. Today, it is 
necessary to concentrate our attention on the economy, conduct 
reforms, and make all possible efforts to include the entire 
potential of the state in this process. This is the only way we 
can receive security guarantees. Only having revived our 
economy, we will be reckoned with. Only this way, we will be 
able to withhold our decisions and integrate into a civilized 
Europe. 
  For the time being however... For the time being however, at 
the NATO headquarters in Brussels, at the conference room where 
the Ukrainian delegation met with top officials of the NATO 
International Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretariat, two maps of 
the world hang on the wall: One depicts 15 states, the other 
displays four black letters painted against a pink background -- 
USSR. The sooner we will convince the whole world and NATO 
members that the second map is obsolete the better...

economic life and Poland's active help in this will facilitate 
the strengthening of Ukraine's statehood and independence.

  [Text] Kiev, 2 Feb -- At the morning sitting of the Supreme 
Council session, having postponed examination of the issue of a 
Ukraine-wide referendum on the fundamental constitutional 
provisions on the organization of state authority and local 
self-government in Ukraine, the deputies began to examine a 
draft law on making amendments and additions to the law of 
Ukraine on elections of people's deputies of Ukraine, which 
people's deputy Oleksiy Shakhovtsov spoke about on behalf of the 
commission for issues of legislation. 
  Deputies supported the proposal of people's deputy Serhiy 
Holovatyy, who proposed "to ensure a quorum of live deputies, 
and not button ones [ones who have substitutes to press the 
button in votes], and to send out telegrams to them so that 
there are not less than 300 deputies in the session hall 
tomorrow, 3 February." In his speech, Serhiy Holovatyy said that 
if the amendments to the law on elections are not approved, the 
elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 27 March would 
not take place. But elections for the president are set for 26 
June. "To whom will power belong over this period?" -- Serhiy 
Holovatyy asked. Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme 
Council, who was chairing the session, agreed with this 
proposal, instructing Vasyl Durdynets, first deputy chairman of 
the Supreme Council, to assemble a quorum.

  [Text] The speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, Ivan 
Plyushch, has expressed disfavor for a referendum on the basic 
constitutional provisions in Ukraine. The proposal on holding 
the referendum March 27 was earlier advanced by Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  Speaking in parliament on Wednesday morning, Plyushch said 
that the constitutional law on power should be adopted by 
parliament. 
  According to the draft law that is to be debated in 
parliament Thursday, the local executive power should be in the 
hands of the heads of locals councils who are to be elected. 
  The institute of the president's representatives, Plyushch 
proposed, is to be annulled after the constitutional law comes 
into force.

  [Text] At its evening plenary session on 2 February, the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine approved the draft Law "On Energy 
Supply" after the first reading. During the debate on this 
draft law, people's deputies expressed two opposite stands: 
Anatoliy Yahoferov and Ivan Makar believe the provisions of the 
law are geared to restoring the administrative methods of 
managing economy while Borys Mokin and others were convinced 
that they stimulate energy by saving production methods. The 
laws concerning legal proceedings will come into force on the 
day of their promulgation, in particular the law "On the Bodies 
of the Judges' Self-Government" (formerly called "On Conferences 
and Congresses of Judges"); "On Qualification Commissions, 
Qualification Certification, and Disciplinary Responsibility of 
Ukraine's Judges"; and "On Introducing Amendments to the Law `On 
the Status of Judges.'" Changes have been introduced to the 
Supreme Council resolution "On Putting the Law of Ukraine `On 
Road Traffic' in force." The people's deputies expressed most 
of their interest during the debate on two draft laws: "On 
Introducing Amendments and Additions to the Cabinet of 
Ministers' Decree `On the Regime of Foreign Investments'" and to 
the Land Code of Ukraine (concerning the privatization of plots 
of land under incomplete construction projects). People's 
Deputy Volodymyr Petrenko pointed out: "We must examine this 
issue as a concept. Does the Supreme Council give the 
opportunity to foreign natural persons and legal entities and 
also to persons without citizenship to buy plots of land under 
the current inflation and distorted exchange rate of the coupon 
[karbovanets] in relation to the dollar?" The majority of the 
speakers agreed with his opinion that it is impossible to grant 
foreign citizens or persons without citizenship the right to buy 
land and remarked that their right to lease plots of land could 
be envisaged in the completed variant of the documents. The 
deputies voted for introducing amendments to the Cabinet of 
Ministers' decree "On the Regime of Foreign Investments." 
  Chairman of the Supreme Council Ivan Plyushch said that on 3 
February two important issues would be considered: the draft 
law on local self-government; and conformity with the trilateral 
statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and 
Russia to the Supreme Council resolution on START I ratification.

  [Text] Lvov February 3 TASS--The Ukrainian 
Procurator-General's Office accepted for examination a message 
by legislator Khmara and some of his colleagues where they 
demand that a criminal case be instituted against acting Premier 
Yukhym Zvyahilskyy who permitted 17 leading engineering 
factories to ship their products to countries of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) without preliminary 
payment. 
  In legislators' opinion, this is "an illegal order 
inflicting 
material damage on Ukraine". 
  The difficult economic situation in the CIS countries has 
brought about a situation when some enterprises and 
organisations went bankrupt and did not pay for delivered goods 
or paid with great delays. 
  Former Ukrainian Premier Leonid Kuchma forbid to ship goods 
to former Soviet republics without preliminary payment or 
without guarantees by a foreign bank which could vouch for 
payments in time. 
  But, six months later, Zvyahilskyy signed a decision 
permitting the Kiev Elektronmash, Kharkov bicycle factories and 
other leading engineering enterprises to deliver goods to the 
CIS countries without the confirmation of preliminary payments.

<F P=106> [Interview with Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov by Fiammetta </F>
Cucurnia; place and date not given: "`Citizens of Crimea, 
Referendum Now' -- Independence According to Meshkov"] 
  [Excerpt] Simferopol -- [introductory passage omitted] Some 
oppositionists here say that Yuriy Meshkov -- this 45-year-old 
lawyer who boasts of his expertise in martial arts, a judo 
blackbelt -- is merely a transitional figure, as unavoidable as 
a bitter medicine. The promise to bring Crimea back into the 
ruble area under the Russian umbrella, abandoning the ruined 
Ukrainian economy to itself, will be short-lived, they say, in 
view of Moscow's indifference and [Ukrainian President] 
Kravchuk's hostility. So he will soon be a president with no 
powers, like the queen of England. 
  But Yuriy Meshkov does not seem at all like a queen. And 
Crimea is not reminiscent of England. It is much more like 
Karabakh, Georgia, and the Moldovan lands of the Dniester, where 
offended and desolate men have been attacking each other, first 
in the elections and the referendum, then with ultimatums, and 
last with hatred and weapons, in order to defend their own 
"sacrosanct" rights. 
  [Cucurnia] Mr. President, you said today that soon the 
citizens of Crimea will be summoned to a referendum on 
independence. You went on to explain that you do not intend to 
take the republic out of Ukraine and that there will be no 
territorial problems. In our country we say that you cannot eat 
soup and blow on it at the same time. How do you intend to 
reconcile these two positions? 
  [Meshkov] The status of an independent republic is not an 
end 
in itself. We have only one wish: to salvage ourselves. That 
is, to set our economy back on a sound footing. If in order to 
do so it is not necessary to modify Crimea's status, then we 
will not do so. But if anyone tries to obstruct us, then we will 
be forced somehow to guarantee our autonomy in the economic 
field. 
  [Cucurnia] Do you mean that you reserve the right to leave 
Ukraine? 
  [Meshkov] I personally do not see the need for it, but the 
political situation is very complex and unpredictable, precisely 
because of the disastrous economic situation. In our country 
there is no longer any stability, there is so much crime, so 
much disintegration and poverty that social explosions and 
revolts cannot be ruled out, and we must defend our citizens. 
  [Cucurnia] At your news conference you said that you want to 
turn Crimea into a bridge between Russia and Ukraine. But apart 
from the deafening silence on Russia's part and Kravchuk's 
attempts at reconciliation, the whole of western Ukraine rejects 
the very idea of your independence. Do you not think that 
somebody will try to blow up your bridge? 
  [Meshkov] The experience of the former Soviet republics has 
set in motion some obscure and ambivalent mechanisms, a mixture 
of centrifugal thrusts and hopes of reintegration. 
Unfortunately the former prevailed in the initial phase and 
paved the way for a tide of nationalism in the lands of the 
former USSR. Leadership groups came to power that have 
neglected economic problems, since they were busy with gaining 
and retaining power. Those who were most keen to break the 
bridges and to isolate themselves, such as Ukraine, have 
suffered the most. Crimea's territorial problem is certainly 
not the most serious problem that Ukraine has to face, keeping 
in mind the fact that even outside Crimea feelings have changed 
and many people long for what they have lost. 
  [Cucurnia] Mr. President, according to the official figures, 
over a million people voted for you yesterday. How many of them 
do you think voted for a reunion with Russia? 
  [Meshkov] The nostalgia that we all feel for that stable and 
secure past that we knew is perfectly understandable; the memory 
has not disappeared from our awareness. Just as communist 
ideology has not disappeared. It is wrong for the international 
economic structures to lay down the law, without taking account 
of the situation and minds of the people who make this economy 
function. And people now are being forced to choose: Behind us 
we have left a secure world that turned into decline and poverty 
when we were promised a market economy. Whether to move forward 
toward these horrors, or to rebuild a decent life? Those who 
voted for me do not want a return to communism, but they do want 
to reform the economy and to restore everyone's fundamental 
rights. We give priority to the rights of the citizens, not 
those of the state. The state must concern itself with the 
people, and not vice versa. But if the international community 
abandons us, unless it tries to influence the decisions adopted 
by Kiev, which has shown itself to be incapable of economic 
management, unless Ukraine's brutal actions are discouraged, the 
situation in Crimea could really become red hot. 
  [Cucurnia] But are you aware that Crimea is surrounded by 
the interests of two nuclear powers, Ukraine and Russia, not to 
mention Turkey, which has promised support to the Tatar 
minority, who hail from these lands? 
  [Meshkov] I feel the full burden of the responsibility that 
I 
have shouldered. These are hard and embittered times. I am 
perfectly well aware of the gravity of the situation, especially 
since I learned that the director of the CIA devoted his report 
to the issue of the elections in Crimea. But nobody will 
understand our problems and the fact that Crimea's internal 
structure rules out the explosion of conflicts. The only thing 
that could provoke these people is economic collapse, in which 
case social processes will become impossible to control. But we 
have no internal ethnic or religious conflicts or any 
nationalist movements seeking justice against history. Russia 
and Ukraine have always been good neighbors. The only serious 
problem is the Black Sea Fleet, and Ukraine should have the 
courage to admit that it is Russian and indivisible. 
  [Cucurnia] What about the Tatars, who opposed your elections 
with all their strength? 
  [Meshkov] I am disappointed about the statements by their 
leader Mustafa Dzhemilev [name as received], who has said that 
he cannot rule out armed resistance by the Tatars for a solution 
of their national problems. This really is too much. 
Fortunately, the Tatar intelligentsia and a large proportion of 
the people do not agree with these statements. Be that as it 
may, it cannot influence the Crimean citizens' legitimate desire 
to build a viable future.

  [Text] Crimea's first president, Yuriy Meshkov, told 
Interfax in an exclusive interview that his republic's economic 
independence was the first-priority aspect of his policy. 
  He said that the results of the presidential elections had 
"confirmed the orientation to economic and cultural cooperation 
with Russia." 
  The referendum on independence to be held next March is 
expected to put Crimea's economic independence on a juridical 
footing, he continued. 
  "Crimea must be an independent and full-fledged member of 
the 
CIS economic system," said Meshkov. 
  Asked about Kiev's possible negative reaction to the results 
of the presidential elections, he said that the more than one 
million votes cast in his support were the guarantor which no 
decree or political statement can shake. 
  Speaking about the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, he said: 
"The fleet must be indivisible and Russian, and must be based in 
Sevastopol -- an inalienable part of Crimea." 
  He said that the other serious problem facing Crimea was the 
problem of the Crimean Tatars. He said he favored the idea of 
compensating the Crimean Tatars for the state damage inflicted 
on them. He believes that Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, the 
countries where part of the deported Crimean Tatars now live, 
must finance their return to their historical homeland. 
  Asked if he would use the white Lincoln given to him by the 
Crimean billionaire Sergey Shuriga, he said: "I don't think I'll 
use it very often. But it won't hurt to have a Lincoln for 
welcoming Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk or Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin."

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Tkachuk, deputy chairman of the </F>
Committee for Legislative and Legal Issues, by Yu. 
Nepomnyashcha; place and date not given: "Bagrov Won With 
Kravchuk But Lost the Crimean Presidency" -- first two 
paragraphs are KYYIVSKA PRAVDA introduction] 
  [Text] The Crimea has its own president. Although he has 
been supported by the majority of the peninsula's population, he 
has placed many uneasy questions before Ukraine's leadership and 
alarmed the world. 
  The following interview was given on the eve of the Crimean 
elections. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] The situation in the Crimea has been 
precisely described beyond Ukraine's borders. The Crimea is 
compared with Afghanistan as a potential threat to peace and 
stability. Has everything been done in Ukraine to prevent this 
threat? 
  [Tkachuk] Since the spring of 1992, our committee has been 
delivering to the president and the Supreme Council documents 
saying that events in the Crimea have been developing in a 
different direction than was expected when Crimean autonomy was 
proclaimed. We have come forward with proposals to cancel 
certain presidential decrees, including the one on establishing 
a free economic zone, and pointed out that the Crimean 
Constitution contradicts the Ukrainian one, as well as signaled 
that Ukraine's property have been illegally confiscated. The 
president has kept saying: We know about all these issues and 
are in control of the situation. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] Apparently, he has been afraid that a 
tough position of the center would call forth a similar reaction 
in the Crimea. 
  [Tkachuk] First of all, this is a characteristic feature of 
Ukraine's mentality: It will be somehow... Second, every 
politician has believed that he is the wisest. What has 
happened with Bagrov is an appalling example. He won with 
Kravchuk, having de facto established his own state -- an 
independent Crimea -- and now, he also is outside the board. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] In Kiev, officials have bet on Bagrov, 
expecting that he will win the elections and remember that the 
center has showed support for him. 
  [Tkachuk] Yes, they have bet on him, which demonstrates the 
weakness of our political prognoses. There is a certain common 
law -- the expansion of power. If somebody assumes a certain 
amount of power, this power tends to expand. Having granted 
autonomy to the Crimea, we allowed the Oblast Council to be 
transformed into a Supreme Council. However, this should have 
happened by means of elections, since oblast councils have 
completely different personnel and intellectual potentials than 
a supreme one. It was naive to believe that the Oblast Council 
would improve its way of thinking. This is our analysis. The 
quicker the powers of Crimean authorities grew, the more 
subsidies they demanded from the center. Today, although per 
capita income in the Crimea ranks in the top 20 among other 
oblasts, the region is in the top 10 in terms of consumption. 
  When Crimean deputies adopted a law on education, which 
practically eliminated the Ukrainian language, we swallowed 
this. We also swallowed an electoral law which eliminated 
Ukrainian parties from the Crimean electoral process. They have 
established their own banks and customs services to separate 
even further from Ukraine. In Kiev meanwhile, we have observed 
this and kept silent, hoping that Bagrov would not forget and 
repay our services. Today, Bagrov has ceased to exist as a 
political figure. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] How do you assess the position of 
Yuriy Meshkov? Where will he lead the Crimea, having become 
president? 
  [Tkachuk] I have heard several of his speeches delivered in 
the Crimean Supreme Council. I will quote him by heart: The 
yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag wants to once again tie a noose 
around the necks of the long-suffering people of the Crimea... 
This is his style. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] While signing the tripartite statement 
on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, the Ukrainian side put 
emphasis on a paragraph concerning the inviolability of borders, 
assuming that the statement will contribute to positive 
resolution of the Crimean issue. 
  [Tkachuk] What does a statement mean? If they had signed an 
agreement or treaty, which would have legal consequences -- 
meaning that it does not matter if Yeltsin or someone else is in 
power in Moscow, and that a country is obliged to fulfill the 
agreement... What, I repeat, is the legal status of a statement? 
  [Nepomnyashcha] What is your prognosis for the 
development of events on the peninsula? 
  [Tkachuk] Unfortunately, one can smell gunpowder in the air 
there. The situation will much depend on the Crimean Tatars' 
position. The Russian population of the peninsula is not very 
happy about returning there [to Russia]. Yuriy Meshkov 
emphasized this issue during his campaign. Many Ukrainians who 
have settled in the Crimea have lost their national roots, and 
the mentality of our people is rather peaceful. Tatars, on the 
other hand, have repeatedly stated in the Mejlis [National 
Assembly] their intention to fight for national liberation. 
Should this occur, we may see very unpleasant events in the 
Crimea. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] Are there any possibilities to relieve 
the tensions? 
  [Tkachuk] There are many possibilities. All that is needed 
is the political will, since one should take harsh steps, in 
particular, introduce presidential rule. 
  [Nepomnyashcha] ...which will trigger even greater 
opposition on part of the new president and political forces 
that back him. 
  [Tkachuk] Do you think that if we do nothing there will be 
peace? We used to think that way. We argued in the 
legislature, saying that it is better to listen to the noise of 
microphones here than to the cannonade of automatic weapons 
there. But, the latest assassination of Bagrov's aide testifies 
to the fact that silence does not solve problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Demenyev: "The Chernobyl Nuclear Power </F>
Plant Generates 5 Percent of Ukraine's Nuclear Energy. Soon It 
Could Generate More"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian parliament adopted four different 
resolutions regarding the Chernobyl nuclear plant over the past 
four years. The station was "executed" three times (deadlines 
for its stoppage were set for the beginning of 1995, then 1992, 
and 1993); and in October 1993, the Supreme Council "pardoned" 
it, permitting it to function until the exhaustion of its 
technical resources. The last decision was forced by life 
itself, with the parliament just affirming it. Losing 5 percent 
of Ukraine's electric energy, generated by the Chernobyl plant, 
means death for our state -- electricity frequency is on the 
verge of normal levels, reaching at times 49 hertz. Experts 
know very well that if the frequency goes down, this might 
trigger a ripple effect paralyzing all industries. 
  This is another case confirming the proverb that every cloud 
has a silver lining. It is not the market economy or 
competition but the station's dire situation that forced its 
staff to fight for survival on three fronts at a time -- to 
maintain the system of nuclear units, to prepare those units for 
their decommissioning, and to produce electricity with a 110-118 
percent completion of its monthly production plans. As long as 
the government was handing out subsidies to unprofitable 
enterprises or even entire industries, fueling inflation, the 
Chernobyl plant undertook expensive safety measures and at its 
own cost, carried out a considerable amount of work necessary to 
put the plant out of commission. During nine months of 1994 
alone, safety and reliability outlays amounted to 14 billion 
karbovanets -- one-fourth of the revenues. At the same time, 
production costs for one kilowatt-hour produced at the Chernobyl 
plant proved 1.5-fold less than at thermal electric stations, 
even though it pays world prices for its nuclear fuel. 
  In terms of security, Chernobyl nuclear units today are as 
good as comparable Russian ones. As the honorary president of 
the World Association of Nuclear Plant User States (WANO), Lord 
Marshall, emphasized ("ATOMNAYA TECHNIKA ZA RUBEZHOM" [Foreign 
Atomic Engineering], No. 6, 1993), that the "safety of RBMK-type 
reactors was brought up to quite acceptable levels." 
Paradoxically, it was opponents of nuclear engineering that 
helped achieve this condition. Following the accident in 1986, 
the plant has been working under the constant pressure from the 
"Green" Party, politicians, media, as well as an enhanced 
scrutiny of foreign and national experts and monitoring 
institutions. In December alone, the Chernobyl plant was 
visited by Mykola Shteynberg, head of the Ukrainian State Atomic 
Supervising Committee, George Kallman, one the leading experts 
at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (analogous to the 
Ukrainian State Atomic Supervising Committee), and Morris Rosen, 
deputy general manager of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency]. 
  During the last visit, in addition to the usual problems, a 
new issue was raised -- preparation for resuming the work of the 
No. 2 unit, which was stopped after the fire on the No. 4 
turbogenerator in October 1991. That accident was caused by the 
malfunction of one of the electric cables, and was not connected 
with nuclear and radiation safety of the reactor. According to 
a timetable set at the station, the No. 2 unit is to be ready 
for reactivation as early as November 1994. Although the 
Chernobyl plant will again defray most of the costs, government 
support will be necessary because, as the station's experts say, 
the bloc's reactivation costs will pay off relatively quickly, 
funneling net profits to the state budget. 
  However favorable the situation for the plant might be, the 
Chernobyl plant experts realize that the date of the plant 
closure is not too many years from now. This is why the 
decommission works will be continued. The construction of a new 
boiler house and a storage facility for liquid and radioactive 
waste will be completed. 
  What would replace the energy potential in the north of 
Ukraine following a shutdown of the Chernobyl plant? The 
Chernihiv Oblast administration endorsed a project to build a 
new electrical plant near Slavutych with a 2,000 megawatt 
capacity. Its type and the kind of fuel will be selected during 
a technical and economic evaluation of the project, and 
subsequently put to a referendum by the local population. This 
is exactly how they act in civilized states when planning to 
build a new industrial enterprise. 
  When decommissioned, the Chernobyl plant might still be of 
some value. For example, it may serve as a foundation for a 
facility for storing and processing nuclear waste.

  [Text] Minsk February 2 TASS -- Belarusian Parliament 
Chairman Myecheslaw Hryb instructed the Republican KGB to probe 
the decision of the National Strike Committee which, according 
to him, contains appeals to topple authorities. 
  The Strike Committee decided on Wednesday to call an 
indefinite political strike on February 15. The major demand is 
the resignation of the government and early parliamentary 
elections. 
  "If there are criminal aspects in the issue, criminal 
proceedings should be instituted jointly with the prosecutor's 
office and an investigation carried out", Hryb instructed Acting 
KGB Chairman Gennadiy Lavitskiy. 
  Hryb informed parliamentarians about his order during the 
evening session on Wednesday.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Strike Committee at its 
meeting on 2 February resolved to form worker detachments for 
maintaining order during the strikes. It was also resolved to 
request the Belarusian Association of Servicemen to help 
maintain order. According to BELAPAN, Strike Committee 
representatives intend to request that the Armed Forces and 
internal troops not interfere in the upcoming events. A meeting 
with representatives of a number of political parties and trade 
unions is also scheduled for 7 February, during which the 
members of the Council of the Strike Commitees will detail their 
protest action. Due to organizational reasons, BELAPAN has not 
been informed of the list of enterprises that agreed to 
participate in the political strike. However, one can assuredly 
say that they include the largest enterprises of the country.

<F P=106> [Report attributed to BELINFORM: "Vyacheslav Kebich: </F>
Belarusian Reforms Will Be Continued"] 
  [Text] On 28 January, the closing meeting of the national 
seminar on "Key Trends in Overcoming the Social and Economic 
Crisis and Speeding Up Market Reform, and the Immediate Goals of 
Executive Committees at Local Soviets of People's Deputies" took 
place at the Government Building. 
  The meeting was addressed by Vyacheslav Kebich, chairman of 
the Belarusian Council of Ministers. Focusing on economic 
reform, he confirmed the government's unfailing devotion to a 
market economy with well-considered changes excluding "shock 
therapy," which proved to be the wrong course of action in other 
states. 
  "Belarusian reforms will be continued," said the prime 
minister. "Slowing them down is completely out of the question. 
At the same time, our policy will be aimed at deepening our 
economic integration with Russia. However, we will have the 
actual result only after the unification of the two monetary 
systems and the establishment of an exchange rate acceptable to 
Belarus." 
  Concerning the practical side of the given issue, the head 
of 
the Cabinet of Ministers noted the positive progress of 
negotiations. V. Kebich reported that a group of specialists 
from the Russian Central Bank was working in Minsk. They were 
finalizing the coordination of exchange rates for the national 
currencies and the policy of issuing money. 
  The issue of balancing prices for energy resources imported 
to Belarus from Russia also requires a resolution. According to 
the Belarusian side, import prices must be unified and 
approximated to local oil and gas prices for Russian enterprises. 
  The chairman of the Council of Ministers denied 
categorically 
the accusations from the Belarusian Popular Front directed 
against the government regarding its "restrictions on the 
sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Belarus." 
According to V. Kebich, "the course toward the deepening of 
Belarusian integration with Russia is a way toward the salvation 
of its economic and national interests."

  [Text] According to reliable sources, a large group of 
Russian financial and economic experts arrived in Minsk today. 
The group also includes representatives of the State 
Cooperation Committee, Customs Control Committee, and the 
Central Bank of Russia. The visit is connected with 
preparations for the signing of documents necessary to merge the 
two countries' monetary systems. An official from the 
Belarusian Cabinet of Ministers, who agreed to speak on 
condition of anonymity, did not rule out a decision to gradually 
replace the Belarusian currency with Russian rubles sometime 
this year. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets is 
expected to arrive in Minsk later this week to finally resolve 
this issue.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav </F>
Shushkevich, by Uladzimir Samoilaw, in Shushkevich's summer 
house; date not given: "I Am Not Going To Put a Period to My 
Political Career"] 
  [Text] [Samoylaw] It is three days since you were 
recalled. How do you feel; was this scenario a surprise? 
  [Shushkevich] I am feeling well. I think that should have 
happened a year and a half ago; it is strange that it did not. 
  [Samoylaw] Why? 
  [Shushkevich] A legislative chairman whose views differ 
categorically from the views of an organized majority of 
lawmakers cannot expect to work long. 
  [Samoylaw] What kinds of views? 
  [Shushkevich] First of all, views on Belarusian statehood 
and the development of the national economy. No matter how much 
they talk about reforming the economy, they are doing nothing. 
This is why the nation is standing on the verge of a grand 
collapse. This collapse has begun in industries and may gravely 
afflict agriculture, which would be very dangerous. 
  [Samoylaw] The common belief is that there is just one way 
to save the situation -- by merging Russian and Belarusian 
monetary systems. Will this merger become a panacea or do we 
pin too many hopes on it? 
  [Shushkevich] I would also like Belarus and Russia to sign a 
sound agreement in the sphere of monetary relations. However, I 
believe that the most important issue is parity of prices for 
power resources. This is very relevant to our economy. 
  [Samoylaw] Still, it seems that there are many issues on 
which the sides cannot reach accord, for instance that of 
exchange rates. 
  [Shushkevich] I am not worried by exchange rates; let 
experts resolve that. I am worried about prices. If we 
continue to pursue the same silly policy as in 1993, paying $128 
for a tonne of oil that cost $90 in Rotterdam material 
exchange.... Where will it bring us? It is impossible to find 
out who is to blame; who is responsible for this kind of 
silliness. Nobody was found and punished. A system of 
responsibility does not exist here. 
  When 70 percent of the enterprises close down and people are 
paid two-thirds of their wages, what kind of state can put up 
with this? The tragedy is that the policy of wasting what our 
fathers and grandfathers earned is continuing. All measures 
must be taken to change this trend, but I do not believe that 
the government is capable of doing this. 
  [Samoylaw] In light of this, do you think that we will never 
introduce our national currency? 
  [Shushkevich] There are many reasons for introducing the 
national currency. Yet, there are enough reasons not to do so. 
The main factor is the industrialists' persuasion that it is 
more convenient to use Russian rubles. In fact this makes 
absolutely no difference because money is just a measuring 
device. No matter if we measure with a wooden or a metal ruler 
-- one meter will remain one meter. 
  [Samoylaw] Did you personally make any mistakes when in the 
post of Supreme Soviet chairman? 
  [Shushkevich] I cannot be blamed for strategic mistakes. I 
wanted to do many things differently but under the circumstances 
I could not. It is understood that nobody is perfect, but I 
have no grounds for blaming myself for any political drawbacks. 
  [Samoylaw] However, you were accused of serious 
shortcomings, including the destruction of the legislature's 
work. 
  [Shushkevich] The point is that those who accused me were 
experts in a centrally administered economy. Market mechanisms 
have not been launched in our country yet; they simply do not 
exist. At the same time, our laws do not permit properly 
managing the national economy. This is very dangerous. 
  We lack courage and consistency to pursue a declared policy. 
This is a proper policy but nothing is being done to implement 
it. We are not moving toward privatization or even simple 
commercialization. 
  [Samoylaw] Is it true that you have been proposed for a post 
in the CIS leadership? 
  [Shushkevich] This post can only be proposed to a 
legislative chairman. 
  [Samoylaw] What are you going to do in the future? 
  [Shushkevich] I have already received written offers of 
employment. 
  [Samoylaw] What are they? 
  [Shushkevich] It is still a secret, because I have not made 
a final decision yet. Believe me that the offer is very serious. 
  [Samoylaw] What about your legislative duties? 
  [Shushkevich] I will actively work, although frankly 
speaking, I see no chance of changing anything. I could not 
change anything being the chairman. I will probably work on the 
educational or cultural committee. 
  There is still much obscurantism in our economy. I want to 
point out that I do not feel myself a dilettante in the sphere 
of macroeconomics. I am proud that I have received an 
invitation from abroad to deliver a lecture on this subject. 
  [Samoylaw] Do you believe that the new Supreme Council will 
be more economically educated? 
  [Shushkevich] This is what bothers me. I do not know 
whether it will be more educated, but I believe that it will be 
more intelligent. 
  [Samoylaw] Will you participate in the new legislative 
elections? 
  [Shushkevich] I am not going to finish with politics. 
  [Samoylaw] What can you say regarding Lukashenka's 
accusations? 
  [Shushkevich] Believe me or not, but neither me nor my 
family will ever stoop to abuse a position for profit. In this 
summer house I made everything with my own hands, and I turned 
to repair companies only when I could not do something. 
However, I paid for everything. Lukashenka could have come and 
seen for himself -- other people would have done this. 
  Before you, a foreign correspondent visited me here. He 
thought he would see a palace and was very surprised that the 
former Supreme Council chairman has such a "ranch." 
  [Samoylaw] What advice would you give to NARODNAYA GAZETA 
readers? What should they anticipate and hope for? 
  [Shushkevich] I am a NARODNAYA GAZETA reader myself. Press 
should exist for those who are ruled and not for those who rule. 
Your newspaper is that kind. I want to tell readers that they 
should count on themselves, sow, and work. Frankly speaking, I 
do not expect any improvement soon. I wish our readers had a 
government that would do what it promises. Unfortunately, I 
cannot say anything cheerful. Still, man cannot live without 
hope.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stanislav Shushkevich, former chairman of </F>
the Belarusian Supreme Soviet, by Yadviga Yuferova on 30 January 
near Minsk: "Stanislav Shushkevich: I Am Not Leaving Big-League 
Politics"] 
  [Text] [Yuferova] Stanislav Stanislavovich, I hope we are 
living in civilized times when resignation is no grounds for 
personal tragedy but merely part of one's career, so my 
questions are addressed to the active politician Shushkevich: 
Why did the chairman of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet resign? 
  [Shushkevich] The reasons were quite aptly formulated by 
numerous commentators: The restoration of nomenklatura power. 
The formal pretexts simply do not stand up to criticism: 
Anyone who has seen my ordinary dacha, which I began to build 
with my own hands, knows that not by the remotest stretch of the 
imagination can it be termed "personal vanity." 
  It is something else that surprises me: I managed to work on 
for 18 months after the disposition of forces in the Belarusian 
parliament had become obvious, where the majority did not need a 
democrat or centrist as a speaker. 
  [Yuferova] Politics are a tough team game. You did not have 
your own party, your own faction in parliament, or even, they 
say, your own team. Are you a lone politician? 
  [Shushkevich] I could not make the majority think 
differently 
but some newcomers started to think like me -- and that is good 
for our power inclined toward old convictions. I have always 
had complete mutual understanding with politicians from stable 
democratic countries. 
  I was a political romantic; I had no political support among 
the social strata; some of the intelligentsia understood me. 
The trouble is that the mass media in our country are entirely 
in the hands of those who actually rule and have now finally 
taken all power. The first organizational meeting of the 
present government was held by the first secretary of the 
Communist Party of Belarus Central Committee; this government 
has in fact brought the republic's economy to its knees. The 
legislative base for the transition to the market, although it 
is not the best base, has nonetheless been created. 
  [Yuferova] But does it not seem to you that the rapid 
deterioration of the people's life, galloping inflation, also 
voted against the head of state? 
  [Shushkevich] Not a single parliament can neglect 
production. Through the will of the government not a single 
market mechanism is operating in our country. The state cannot 
pay two-thirds of their wages to 50 percent of the plants for 
the umpteenth month when people are doing nothing. We are 
consuming our fixed capital, everything which our predecessors 
accumulated. 
  No one from outside will rectify our own stupidity. They can 
help, but they cannot cure us from the outside. 
  [Yuferova] Stanislav Stanislavovich, in that case should the 
Russian ruble fulfill its "international duty" on Belarusian 
territory? Many economists in Moscow are less than delighted, 
to put it mildly, in connection with the union of the two 
states' monetary systems. For some people the ruble zone will 
simply be a zone.... 
  [Shushkevich] Nothing threatens the Russian ruble for a 
reason which has already been cited: The majority of 
enterprises are out of it -- that means we should not expect an 
eruption of inflation. Our neighbors' empty coffers present no 
danger. The complication will lie in the mutual settling of 
accounts. The Russian ruble will help but will not lead us out 
of the impasse. What difference will it make: There used to be 
no Belarusian rubles, now there will be no Russian rubles. In 
my view the unification of the two monetary systems is becoming 
more problematical with every passing day. 
  [Yuferova] What was the reaction in the republic to your 
resignation? 
  [Shushkevich] I remember a well-known anecdote: Khrushchev 
was at home shortly after being sent into retirement when his 
telephone rang. He lifted the receiver: "Hello, at your 
service." And he heard in reply: "In the past you had to be of 
service, but now you can come downstairs with us to play 
dominoes." So what can I say now.... There is a pile of 
reassuring telegrams, there are people who support me, there are 
my friends and my family. 
  [Yuferova] Was there any official or unofficial reaction 
from Moscow or Kiev? After all the three Belovezhskaya Forest 
"bison" -- Yeltsin, Kravchuk, and Shushkevich -- crossed the 
Viskuli [reference unknown] together into history. 
  [Shushkevich] No. A resignation is a state's internal 
affair. And the conservation of friendly relations is our 
personal business. 
  [Yuferova] How did the rumor appear that Shumeyko had 
offered you the post of chairman of the CIS countries' 
interparliamentary assembly? 
  [Shushkevich] I have nothing to do with it. The rumor was 
obviously generated by ignorant people. According to the 
established rules, only an acting head can head the assembly. 
  [Yuferova] Who is your successor, elected recently as head 
of the Belarusian parliament? 
  [Shushkevich] Myechyslaw Ivanovich Hryb, a retired 
lieutenant general, headed the national security commission in 
the parliament, and I once even asked him to be my deputy. And 
even now I do not cast doubt on his fitting human qualities. 
Let us see how he does in this position although it is an open 
secret that a disposition of forces convenient to the government 
is taking shape in parliament. I should like to wish him 
success in establishing Belarusian statehood. 
  [Yuferova] There is a feeling that the present speaker is 
temporary. No analyst predicted this figure's appearance on the 
political Olympus. 
  [Shushkevich] That is a problem for the analysts, not for 
the speaker now chosen. At the sessions there was frequent talk 
on the subject but early parliamentary elections were not in 
fact scheduled (the deputies are utterly reluctant to part with 
their mandates acquired in the USSR). According to the existing 
Constitution this parliament has one year and two months to work 
-- until new elections in March 1995. 
  [Yuferova] If Belarus decides on presidential elections, 
will you run? 
  [Shushkevich] For the time being I shall say just one thing: 
I do not intend to leave political life. 
  [Yuferova] But considering past mistakes you cannot 
seriously count on anything as a lone politician. On whom do 
you intend to rely in the future? 
  [Shushkevich] Give me two weeks to think. At present it is 
the fashion to play numerous parts, I want to retain my 
convictions. 
  [Yuferova] How have you spent these difficult days since 
your resignation, who has been by your side? 
  [Shushkevich] To be honest, I wanted to be quite alone, in 
the sticks, at my dacha. But it did not work out that way. 
Close friends have arrived and now I have my daughter, my 
son-in-law, and my dog Kuzka with me. I regret not having gone 
to the writers' center today to bid farewell to Ales 
Mikhaylovich Adamovich. I did not have time. It is 3 km to the 
local station and another 50 km to Minsk. And my 1983 Zhiguli 
would not start. 
  [Yuferova] Stanislav Stanislavovich, it seems to me there is 
actually another reason here. It is not that simple to mingle 
with people in a different capacity even at a time of grief. 
  [Shushkevich] Perhaps there is some truth there.... Ales 
Adamovich was a man of great principle and honesty. 
  The people and rulers should have been proud of such a son, 
but he was obliged to spend the past six years in his favorite 
foreign land -- Russia. Sometimes a man has to die to be 
understood in his own Fatherland. How painful it was to learn 
that when Bulat Okudzhava last came to Minsk there was a crowd 
which abused him. That is our shame, that is the same crew 
which drove Adamovich from the republic. 
  [Yuferova] Your immediate plans? 
  [Shushkevich] Over the past few years I have taken virtually 
no leave; I will finally enjoy this right and then continue work 
in parliament as a deputy. 
  [Yuferova] Have you not thought of the destiny of the 
professors who went straight from meetings into big-league 
politics: Akayev, Ter-Petrosyan, Khasbulatov, Landsbergis, 
Popov, Shushkevich. Can a scholar change profession in his 
maturity without personal drama? What is your personal 
experience? 
  [Shushkevich] The need to understand the thrust of a 
phenomenon, the need to focus efforts on a specific avenue leads 
some people to victory, others to resignation. Most likely here 
it is a case not of their profession but of the size of their 
personality. [Shushkevich ends] 
  Shushkevich gave this interview over the telephone on Sunday 
evening while he was at his dacha near Minsk, of which even 
PRAVDA, always biased against the former speaker, wrote that the 
parliamentary commission's claims looked ridiculously inadequate. 
  They settled accounts with him over a different subject.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 1/2/1994 -- The new head of 
CSCE [Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe] Mission 
to Moldova Richard Christopher Samuel (Great Britain), had today 
his first meeting with Ion Botnaru, Minister ad interim of 
Foreign Affairs (temporarily dismissed during the elections). 
Botnaru stated that so far Moldovan officials are satisfied 
with the results of CSCE Mission's activity. CSCE Mission 
recommendations on setting the Dniester conflict were examined 
at the highest level and are accepted as a basis for continuing 
the negotiations. The minister said the recent events in 
Dniester denote an agony of the unconstitutional structures and 
that Tiraspol regime loses its social basis. "We almost reached 
an agreement on granting a special juridical status to East 
districts, in the context of territorial and administrative 
reform and decentralization of power. Of course, it does not 
mean federalization or division of territories," pointed out 
Botnaru. He added the most destabilizing external factor is the 
presence of Russian 14th Army in Moldova. Samuel stated to BASA 
that he is just getting acquainted with Mission's activity. He 
wishes to travel trough Moldova and waits for the Thursday [3 
February] meeting with President Snegur in order to contact the 
sides involved in the controversies. Samuel also asserted that 
"Mission's main purpose is to accomplish the CSCE Mandate 
continuing to activate in directions established and supported 
by his predecessors." It is not the moment to make concrete 
proposals; we will resume our work where it was finished and we 
will find new possibilities for positive involvement of CSCE," 
said Samuel.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 1/2/1994 -- Alexandru Buruiana, 
chairman of Parliament Commission for Foreign Relations, back 
from an official visit to Strasbourg, told BASA that Council of 
Europe representatives he had met support the idea of a national 
poll in Moldova on its independence. "Experts of European 
structures believe that, though without juridical effect, such 
poll would not allow Tiraspol leaders invoke the reason of 
`eventual unification,'" Buruiana asserted. The Moldovan 
delegation met with Catherine Lalumiere, Secretary General of 
Council of Europe and discussed the Ilascu group problem, 
working out future steps for releasing the political prisoners. 
At meetings with top European dignitaries between January 19th 
and 29th, questions regarding Moldova's adherence to the Council 
of Europe were examined. Recommendations were issued, also 
regarding the enhancement of Moldova legislation in accordance 
with European standards, separation of state powers. The 
participation of Council of Europe observers in February 27th 
parliamentary elections was discusses, states a Parliament Press 
Service communique.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 22 for 2 </F>
February 1994; by Andrey Pershin, Andrey Petrovskiy, and 
Vladimir Shishlin; edited by Boris Grishchenko] 
  [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur admits that the 
Tiraspol leaders could organize various provocations, including 
armed ones, which could lead to bloodshed. This was said in the 
address to the heads of state and governments of Russia, 
Ukraine, and Romania (the members of the quadrilateral group on 
a peaceful settlement of conflicts in Transdniester) and to UN 
Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali published on Wednesday. 
  Snegur pointed out that the socio/political situation in the 
Moldovan left-bank regions had significantly deteriorated. The 
leadership of the Transdniestrian anti-constitutional bodies 
continues to hamper possible settlement of this conflict 
regardless of the efforts to resolve the conflict by peaceful 
political means displayed by Moldova, the Moldovan president 
said. 
  According to the Moldovan leadership, the main goal of the 
Transdniestrian leaders is to prevent the inhabitants of 
Moldova's left-bank regions from participating in the early 
parliamentary elections in Moldova, planned for February 27. 
  Snegur addressed the Russian, Ukrainian, Romanian, and UN 
leaders with a demand to use all their authority and other means 
in order to influence the Tiraspol anti-constitutional bodies 
and to create conditions necessary for normal preparations for 
parliamentary elections. According to the Moldovan president, 
this could be a move forward toward a final settlement of the 
conflict in Transdniester.

<F P=106> [Mircea Dascaliuc report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] President Mircea Snegur's counselor, Ceslav Ciobanu, 
today characterized the demand recently made by the leader of 
the Tiraspol separatists, Igor Smirnov, namely that the Republic 
of Moldova should join the ruble zone as soon as possible, as 
telling proof of his lack of vision about the economic future of 
the region and his defiance of the actual situation of the 
Republic of Moldova and the Eastern rayons. 
  We have started the reform program in accordance with the 
memorandum negotiated with the IMF, Mr. Ciobanu also added, 
whereas nothing is being done in the self-proclaimed Dniester 
Republic, no kind of reform is carried out. 
  Through the intention of joining the ruble zone, the 
Tiraspol 
authorities want to perpetuate their power and to preserve the 
status quo of the separatist leadership. Moreover, they want to 
reestablish -- through various ways and means -- the situation 
of the former Soviet Union, Mr. Ceslav Ciobanu, President Mircea 
Snegur's counselor in charge of economic issues, emphasized. 
  Also today, a meeting was held in Tiraspol by the City 
Soviet 
at which a report on the activity of the Executive Committee and 
on the budget for the current year were presented. The request 
by some deputies to include into the agenda other problems, such 
as rationing foodstuffs, the dismissal of the public education 
chief, Mrs. Vera Dvoreanu, who is defending the Latin writing in 
schools in that area, led to fiery discussions, which ended with 
the initiators leaving the hall in the hope that they would be 
able to block the proceedings. 
  On behalf of the Union of Civic Movements and political 
parties in the Dniester region, Igor Smirnov was asked to 
dissolve the Tiraspol City Soviet until the elections for local 
bodies, which are scheduled to be held in April this year. 
Until then, it was demanded, the local leadership should be 
handled by Vladimir Emilianov as the representative of Igor 
Smirnov, the local correspondent of the Chisinau 
radio-television reports.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 1/2/1994 -- Foreign experts 
consider, contrary to our opinions, that the taxation system in 
Moldova is reasonable, states to the newspaper NEZAVISIMAYA 
MOLDOVA (INDEPENDENT MOLDOVA) Claudia Melnic, Moldovan minister 
of finance. In 1993 the total sum of taxes, including the 
special fund represented 11-12 percent of the national gross 
product. In 1991, it represented 38 percent; in 1994 it is 
planned to represent 15 percent-16 percent. The incomes in 
state budget in 1993 exceeded the expected amount by 4.3 
percent. Referring to the big difference between the 
consumption basket and salaries, she said the budget was 
calculated taking into the account that the average salary 
represents 15 lei and that it will gradually rise afterwards 
each three months. Statistics for November show the average 
salary represented 63.4 lei for a state apparatus employee, 58.7 
lei for transport employee, 84.2 lei for industry employee and 
35.5 lei for agroindustrial employee. The minister of finance 
pleads for improving the remuneration system. "We have to avoid 
the disbalance between 20 lei at some enterprises and 200 lei at 
others; this difference has nothing to do with productivity of 
labour. Perhaps we shall have to reduce the level of 
remuneration to 25 lei minimum salaries; this system is applied 
in Japan, Switzerland etc." Claudia Melnic, the only woman in 
Sangheli cabinet, states: "It is difficult for a woman to stand 
a 16-18 hour work. I hope the new Parliament appoints a man in 
this post," concludes the minister of finance.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 02, BNS -- Several Estonian companies 
have expressed interest in producing 5.56 mm, 9 mm and 7.62 mm 
ammunition that conforms to the NATO standards, but BNS has 
information the Defense Ministry hasn't yet made a final 
decision. 
  Former Defense Minister Juri Luik told BNS at the end of 
last 
year that his ministry is looking into three possibilities to 
produce NATO standard cartridges in Estonia, and that 
negotiations with some companies are in progress. 
  Toomas Noorem, director of the Tartu-based Tarkon company, 
told BNS it is possible to produce cartridges at Tarkon. 
  "For this, only a couple of machine tools and some skilled 
men are needed," he said. "We haven't so far been approached, 
however, nor have we held any talks, but we would certainly be 
interested in such an offer." 
  Noorem said Tarkon is capable of producing other equipment 
for the defense forces, including communications systems. He 
told BNS, however, that it seems to him Estonian officials are 
at present not sufficiently interested in local production of 
necessary equipment. 
  "Estonia has until now tried to buy everything from other 
countries, although we could manufacture some things locally," 
he said. 
  BNS has information the Turi-based Arbalett joint-stock 
company approached the Defense Ministry with a proposal for 
manufacturing cartridges. The Defense League Foundation is one 
of the partners in the company. 
  Leonid Pivovarov, commercial director of Narva's Balti ES 
firm (former Baltiyets), told BNS the Defense Ministry has made 
no concrete proposals to his company. 
  "Six months ago the factory submitted its offers to the 
Defense Forces general staff," he said. "The factory produces 
dosimeters and radiometers that are used by the Estonian customs 
officials. 
  "Balti ES could make also armored doors, electronic locks, 
security systems, medical equipment, and simulators for training 
soldiers," Pivovarov said. 
  Vladimir Galkin, Dvigatel's director general, also told BNS 
nobody has approached his factory with a proposal to produce 
cartridges. 
  "We are considering cooperation offers from more than 40 
companies," he said. "We need clarity on who places the order 
and who pays, what the scope of the project is and what experts 
think, but we expect to iron out all problems through 
negotiations."

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 02, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar attended the World Economic Forum that ended Tuesday 
[1 February] in Davos, Switzerland. The premier was pleased to 
note that Estonia made a breakthrough at the forum. "Estonia was 
all the time spoken about as a real partner," he said. 
  Laar said at a press conference today that economies in 
transition became the focus of attention at the Davos forum. 
"The participants arrived at the conclusion that the transition 
of many states from a planned economy to a market economy makes 
also developed countries undergo major changes," he claimed. 
  The premier said the forum attached great importance to free 
trade and opening of borders as the best ways to develop world 
economy. "The protectionist attitude is considered the greatest 
danger to world economy," he noted. 
  Laar said a high-level Russian delegation arrived in Davos 
to 
convince Western businessmen and politicians that economic 
reforms continue in Russia. "I gathered they didn't succeed very 
well in this," he said. 
  The Estonian premier had several bilateral and three-way 
meetings in Davos. He was pleasantly surprised by the Palestine 
Liberation Organization leader Yasir 'Arafat's high regard for 
Estonia. 
  Laar met in Davos with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. 
The two agreed in principle to conclude as soon as possible a 
free-trade agreement between the two countries. 
  The Estonian premier met also with his Swedish and Finnish 
counterparts, Carl Bildt and Esko Aho. Laar said he and Bildt 
had a thorough discussion of the situation in Paldiski. "Sweden 
is prepared to assist Estonia in cleaning up the environment in 
that town," he said.

  [Text] Riga, Feb 02, BNS -- U.S. President Bill Clinton 
and Vice President Al Gore met with Latvian diplomats and MP's 
Wednesday [2 February] and said they hoped the visit would help 
Latvia to face the serious challenge of the Russian troop 
withdrawal and the Skrunda problem. 
  The U.S.-Latvian military cooperation will substantially 
expand this year, said Willian Perry, under secretary for 
defense. The cooperation will include visits of U.S. warships 
to Latvia's ports, joint maneuvers with U.S. and NATO's Armed 
Forces. 
  The U.S. president has received a draft resolution to lift 
restrictions of shipments of all kind of war materials to the 
Baltic states, Perry said. 
  Latvian parliamentarians voiced a concern over the lack of 
any security guarantees what was said to be potentially 
dangerous against the background of the political climate in 
Russia becoming worse. 
  U.S. officials reiterated that the Baltics were granted a 
priority status in the American foreign policies. Consequently, 
the absence of concrete security guarantees should not be 
overdramatized because formal guarantees are actually redundant. 
  The United States had never signed a formal security treaty 
with Israel but the existing relationship allows to attain the 
desired result without a formal document, U.S. speakers said. 
  The Latvian-U.S. relationship is also very close to similar 
attitudes, they noted. 
  The Latvian delegation met with Senator Carl Levin and 
discussed the potential U.S. financial support for the 
dismantling of the Russian military early-warning antimissile 
radar in Skrunda, Latvia. The senator promised to study the 
request. 
  The group also visited Anthony Lake, president's adviser on 
national security issues.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>
  [Text] Riga February 2 TASS -- Latvia's delegation ended 
talks on Latvian-Russian relations, the withdrawal of Russian 
troops from the republic and the fate of the Russian radar in 
Skrunda in Washington on Wednesday. 
  The delegation met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, Pentagon officials and members of the National 
Security Council. They assured Latvia that no joint tactics of 
troop withdrawal or radar station close-down had been worked out 
during the U.S.-Russian summit meeting in Moscow last month. 
  Their statements ran counter to a NEW YORK TIMES publication 
of January 30, 1994 which said that American and Russian 
specialists had agreed to keep the station for another four 
years and dismantle it within 18 months after that. Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis did not rule out the possibility of 
holding a referendum on the radar station. However, Parliament 
Chairman Anatoliy Gorbunovs believes the referendum may disrupt 
negotiations. 
  Latvian parliamentarians who attended the session of the 
Europarliament Inter-parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg this 
week expressed concern that some influential deputies from 
France, Germany and Britain prioritise the signing of agreements 
between Estonia, Latvia and Russia on troop withdrawal rather 
than the pullout itself. 
  Local observers are at a loss trying to find possible 
explanations to this position. Latvia insists on strict 
observance of resolutions of the United Nations and the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe which call for 
fast and organised withdrawal of troops. At the same time, head 
of the Latvian Parliamentary Commission for Foreign Affairs, 
Aleksandrs Kirsteins, vows that the troops can be withdrawn 
without any agreement. 
  The delegation left the U.S. and flew to Sweden where it 
intends to continue the talks.

  [Text] In the event the Baltic countries or Latvia join the 
Partnership for Peace program and a real danger from Russia 
threatens its security, NATO will not only have consultations 
with the Baltic countries but will try to influence Russia to 
cease its aggressive activity, the delegation of the Latvian 
Defense Ministry was told today in Brussels by (Dick Zandie), 
spokesmen for the political affairs department. 
  (Zandie) added that there are virtually no such threats from 
Russia in reality, and that much would be done for Latvia's 
security by Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace 
program. In (Zandie's) view, cooperation with Russia would also 
be good for NATO. At NATO headquarters today, the Latvian 
Defense Ministry delegation met with two other NATO spokesmen. 
During the meeting they mainly discussed European security 
problems and the involvement of NATO in solving them.

  [Text] Riga, Feb 02, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima 
(parliament) Foreign Affairs' Committee approved the historic 
motivation of a draft document on the occupation and annexation 
of Latvia by the Soviet Union in 1940. 
  The Saeima decided Jan. 27 that this document should be 
submitted to the United Nations together with a request to 
officially recognize that Latvia was occupied in 1940. 
  The adoption of the document does not solve the Russian 
troop 
withdrawal problem but it is still important as an instrument to 
press on Russia, said Indulis Berzins, of the Latvia's Way. 
  If the United Nations approves of the document, Latvia would 
become aware of the attitude of the world community toward the 
occupation, Berzins said. 
  The United Nations, however, may reject or ignore the 
statement if Latvia has not duly prepared its presentation, said 
Janis Jurkans, another speaker at the committee meeting. 
  Democratic Party's Ilga Grava suggested that Lithuanian and 
Estonian parliaments should be invited to draft a common 
statement on occupation. 
  The preliminary coordination of that declaration could take 
place during the Baltic-Nordic seminar, scheduled for Feb. 4-5 
in Riga. 
  Estonia has prepared a similar statement. 
  The committee wants to consult Russian parliamentarians to 
clarify Russia's official stance on the acknowledgement of 
Latvia's occupation. 
  The Foreign Affairs Committee will also contact the Latvian 
envoy to the United Nations, Aivars Baumanis, to find out the 
anticipated reaction of this international organization to the 
Latvian application.

  [Text] It is Germany's duty to promote Latvia's 
incorporation into the European Union emphasized the new German 
Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Reinhard Holubek, 
meeting today with Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs. The envoy 
noted that Latvia's integration into Europe is currently delayed 
by the Russian troops. Therefore, Germany supports Latvia's 
demand for the withdrawal of the troops. Holubek expressed the 
conviction that, thanks to international pressure, the Russian 
troops will be withdrawn from Latvia by 31 August this year. 
Another delaying factor in Latvia's integration into Europe, 
the envoy believes, is the problem of the Skrunda radar station.

  The government will supplement the budget incomes with 30 
million lats of Bank of Latvia's profit payments and cut the 
administrative reform's fund by 1.2 million lats, Gailis said. 
  The group also confirmed a plan to form a working party for 
free trade talks with the European Union and passed for Saeima

international labor conventions. 
  The Cabinet failed to accept a resolution on social 
guarantees for parentless children and regulations on easier 
public transportation tariffs to certain categories of 
residents, said government spokesman Sergei Ancupov.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 02, BNS -- Ole Bierring, Denmark's 
ambassador to NATO, told reporters in Vilnius Wednesday [2 
February] that the visit to Lithuania by a NATO delegation that 
he headed was "fruitful." 
  The delegation is one of the three that are scheduled to 
visit several post-communist countries this and next week, to 
help launch the preparation of individual programs within the 
framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace agreement. 
  Bierring said the principal issue at talks in Lithuania were 
consultations on how to prepare a presentation document, which 
is the first step toward developing an individual partnership 
program with NATO. In Lithuania, the delegation held 
consultations with a special working group that was created 
immediately after Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas 
signed up for the partnership plan at the NATO headquarters in 
Brussels last week. 
  Albinas Januska, deputy minister of foreign affairs and head 
of the group, said the presentation document will be ready quite 
soon. "It is a matter of several months," he said. 
  "Lithuania is on the way to active participation" in the 
partnership, Hermann Freiherr von Richthofen, German ambassador 
to NATO, said, commenting on whether Lithuania is now considered 
"an active partnership member." According to the Partnership for 
Peace framework document, NATO will consult with any active 
participant in the partnership if that partner perceives a 
direct threat to its territorial integrity, political 
independence or security. 
  Januska said Lithuania's goal is absolutely clear - 
transition from partnership to membership in NATO. Hence, the 
Lithuanian version of the presentation document will identify 
the steps that should be taken to achieve this goal, including 
joint military exercises and changing arms according to NATO 
standards, he said. 
  "It is necessary to direct the money that Lithuania spends 
on 
defense toward closer cooperation with NATO. Lithuania is not 
so rich as to spend money on cheap things," Januska said. 
  Sarunas Vasiliauskas, Lithuanian deputy minister of foreign 
affairs, said Lithuania is prepared to invest in projects that 
would meet NATO standards. "A system of air space control would 
be an example of this." 
  Januska said Lithuania intends to ask NATO countries to 
donate some of their arms. 
  But the visiting NATO officials did not mention any 
advancement in discussions on possibly donating weapons that 
must be destroyed according to international agreements. 
  Colonel Richard Cohen, branch chief of the NATO Military 
Cooperation, Plans and Policy Division, said the United States 
and Great Britain earlier cascaded weapons to Turkey, Spain and 
Portugal. But the colonel doubted whether there is any suitable 
equipment left for the purpose. 
  Cohen said, however, that the Baltics might get something 
through separate agreements with NATO countries. 
  The NATO delegation leaves for Tallinn Wednesday evening. It 
also includes Klaus Steinkopff, special assistant to the Supreme 
Allied Command Europe, and John Barret, representative of the 
NATO Political Affairs Division.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 2, ELTA -- Speed of the agricultural 
reform is not satisfying neither to the government nor 
landowners, Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius told the national 
radio on Wednesday. 
  But he added that land was being returned quicker at the 
moment. He said in 1991-1992, the documents returning the 
property were handed to 12.6 thousand former landowners and only 
in 1993 -- 25.2 thousand. 
  Slezevicius said the reform would be speeded up when local 
authorities hire enough officials working with the land issues.

  [Baciulis] The meeting of Andrzey Zakrzewski, envoy of the 
Polish President and secretary of state at the presidential 
office, and the Polish delegation headed by him with President 
Algirdas Brazauskas was planned for 45 minutes, however, the 
diplomats spent more than an hour at the president's office. 
  Andrzey Zakrzewski told the journalists that the discussion 
was about the signing of the Lithuanian-Polish interstate 
treaty, and about coming closer to this objective. 
  However, the state secretary said, we do not define friendly 
relations between the states and nations by treaties alone. 
What is important is that even without this treaty, 
Lithuanian-Polish relations today are already good. 
  When asked whether the declaration would be signed together 
with the treaty, Andrzey Zakrzewski answered that he had no 
powers to decide this. He said that he had proposed several new 
formulations of several articles of the treaty to the Lithuanian 
side which had been prepared by the new Polish foreign minister. 
  Iwo Buszatski, deputy foreign minister, stressed that 
although the minister of foreign affairs in Poland was new, 
Polish foreign policy remained unchanged, if only perhaps some 
matters were being dealt with more speedily. We must not think 
that a breakthrough in the process of negotiations can be 
reached in several hours of negotiations, Andrzey Zakrzewski 
said. However, he said, common thinking was demonstrated by both 
sides aspiring to sign the treaty as soon as possible. He 
admitted that during the talks with Algirdas Brazauskas historic 
issues were touched upon as well, and here he immediately quoted 
Lech Walesa' words saying that the history must not (?suppress) 
the future. According to Andrzey Zakrzewski, this formula was 
regarded rather favorably by the Lithuanian side. 
  Immediately after the meeting the envoy of the Polish 
president will inform Lech Walesa about the results of the 
meeting. He also confirmed that the invitation for the 
Lithuanian negotiation delegation to come to Warsaw was still 
valid and that it will be given a warm welcome there. He said 
that this also applied to the Lithuanian president if he wished 
to visit Warsaw. This is Audrius Baciulis from Seimas.

  [Text] On the eve of the Russian leader's visit to 
Georgia, our correspondent, Yuriy Dekanosidze, met with Givi 
Lominadze, minister for state of the Republic of Georgia, 
chairman of the interim extraordinary committee for western 
Georgia and a member of parliament. The journalist asked 
Lominadze to comment on the Abkhaz issue which, it is supposed, 
will be one of the key issues at tomorrow's meeting. 
  [Begin recording] [Lominadze] My attitude toward and point 
of 
view on Yeltsin's visit is positive. I shall say more: I am 
pinning definite hopes on it. First of all, any visit of such a 
high ranking leader, moreover an official one, is in itself an 
event. Second, we know how many official visits by Russian 
leaders there have been before and whatever the quality of our 
relations with Russia may be in future, there will still be a 
touch of offense among the Georgian people as -- I do not hold 
the Russian official authorities and personally the Russian 
president in high esteem. They helped the Abkhaz separatists 
with all they could, literally using all available means. 
  I am sure that our relations will be normal. We have no 
other option. We are destined to be not only neighbors but 
genuine friends. It is our past, our common faith, community of 
culture, and links which have been maintained with Russia for 
centuries now. Therefore, although difficult, still a big step 
is being taken toward improving these relations and -- I am 
looking into the future -- Russia can and must play the most 
important role in resolving this [Abkhaz] issue. 
  [Dekanosidze] Let us hope that tomorrow's official visit by 
Boris Yeltsin will give us cause to hope that at least one step 
forward will be taken toward resolving the Abkhaz issue. 
  [Lominadze] Personally, I hope and am sure that this issue 
will have a certain backing, undoubtedly will have backing 
because when such high ranking leaders meet against the 
background of all those events they cannot but discuss and come 
to a unanimous decision to resolve the conflict between the 
Georgian and Abkhaz population in Abkhazia. I am sure that 
Russia's realistic policy will positively influence a solution 
to this issue, and personally I am sure that Russia's president 
wishes to resolve this issue. Yeltsin's visit is one of the 
most essential factors which, in my opinion, can settle the 
conflict positively. [end recording]

  [Text] Tbilisi February 2 Tass -- The government-in-exile 
of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic "pins great hopes on Russia 
for restoring justice: the restoration of the territorial 
integrity of the Georgian state", the Abkhazian government, 
temporarily operating in Tbilisi, issued a statement on 
Wednesday. 
  The statement notes that "the earliest organised return of 
refugees to their homes in Abkhazia without any preliminary 
conditions and restrictions is among the main issues for 
restoring mutual trust between Georgia and Russia". 
  The government asks the Russian leadership "to declare 
unequivocally its negative attitude to statements by the Gudauta 
leaders on the establishment of an independent Abkhazian state 
or its accession to Russia". 
  The government "hopes that the visit by President Boris 
Yeltsin to Tbilisi, the signing of a package of documents and 
planned measures will help to achieve a large-scale settlement 
in Abkhazia, unity and integrity of Georgia in the interests of 
its multinational population as well as to ensure stability and 
peace in the Caucasus as a whole, in Russia and throughout the 
world".

  [Text] Tbilisi, 2 Feb -- Immediately upon arrival at 
Vazyaniy Airport of the group of Russian troops in 
Transcaucasia, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev paid a 
visit to the 405th motor rifle Regiment stationed here. 
Accompanied by commanders of the group of Russian troops in

professionalism of its personnel, and their morale. 
  During his meeting with commanders and officers of the unit

the barracks of the personnel, Grachev discussed the procurement 
of material and technical supplies, foodstuffs, and finances, as

military and civilian campuses, schools, and community 
facilities, in a good condition. 
  In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the Russian 
defense minister expressed satisfaction with his visit to the 
regiment. "I came to Tbilisi on a working visit today to 
familiarize myself with the condition of the Russian military 
facilities located here, and to meet and talk with people, from 
the rank and file to the generals. But tomorrow I shall be 
taking part as a member of a Russian Government delegation in 
talks between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Georgian Head 
of State Eduard Shevardnadze," the minister said.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Feb -- The future of military and 
political cooperation between Russia and Georgia depends on 
stabilizing the sociopolitical situation in the republic, 
deciding the political status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and 
on Georgia's readiness to adhere to the framework of the 
collective security treaty. Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev said this today at a meeting with the personnel of the 
405th motor-rifle regiment in Vozian. 
  A meeting between the Russian defense minister and Georgian 
leader Eduard Shevardnadze with a limited number of people 
present is scheduled for this evening. The meeting will take 
place behind closed doors. 
  Touching upon the total numerical strength of the Russian 
Armed Forces, Pavel Grachev said the figure of 1.5 million 
defined by the defense law is not enough to guarantee the 
country's security. In the minister's opinion, "a reliable 
Russian army, capable of fulfilling the tasks laid upon it, 
should number between 2 and 2.1 million by 1995." He said that 
the president and the head of the Russian government have agreed 
in principle to the defense department's proposal. 
  It is proposed that tomorrow's summit will discuss the 
protocols on exchanges by military delegations and on ensuring 
aviation and technical provisions for aviation equipment on 
Russian and Georgian territories, and also a draft agreement on 
the CIS common borders and their protection.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 2 Feb -- Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense 
minister, arrived in Tbilisi today. His visit is taking place 
within the framework of the visit by the president of the 
Russian Federation, which starts tomorrow. 
  The key military question to be decided during the Russian 
president's visit is the question of establishing Russian 
military bases on Georgian territory, Pavel Grachev told 
journalists on arrival. 
  The interim agreement on the status of Russian forces in 
Georgia expires in 1995, he recalled. "We are willing to keep 
our troops in Georgia provided military bases are established 
for them. This fits in with the CIS's treaty on collective 
security. If the two heads of state resolve the bases issue 
satisfactorily tomorrow, the agreement will be worked out by 
military experts," the minister said. There is a possibility 
that a protocol of intent on the establishment of Russian 
military bases in Georgia could be signed, he added. 
  If agreement is reached on the bases, the Russian side 
expects to have three military bases on Georgian territory, 
making a total of five in the Transcaucasus area, with a 
combined strength of about 23,000 men. The main task of this 
grouping, Pavel Grachev said, is to safeguard security in the 
Transcaucasus and North Caucasus regions against outside 
threats, within the framework of the CIS's collective treaty. 
  Pavel Grachev also noted that the question of assisting 
Georgia with the formation of an army "would be resolved 
provided political stability is established in the republic, and 
the political status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia defined". 
Pavel Grachev considers it possible that Russian peacekeeping 
forces might be used to settle the situation in Abkhazia, 
provided that both the Georgian and Abkhaz sides ask for this.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pelts: "Russian Federation Defense </F>
Minister Arrives in Tbilisi"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- On the eve of the official visit by 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin Army General Pavel Grachev, 
minister of defense of the Russian Federation, has arrived in 
Tbilisi; he will take part in talks at the highest level. 
  On 2 February the defense minister and officials 
accompanying 
him visited the Russian Motorized Infantry Regiment. At a 
meeting with officers Army General Grachev stressed that the 
question of the possibility of setting up Russian military bases 
in Georgia will be raised at the talks. The Georgian leadership 
on the whole supports this idea and is ready to discuss it. In 
particular, Russia proposes to set up bases in Batumi, 
Akhalkalaki, and Vaziani. 
  Pavel Grachev stressed that, if this proposal is accepted, 
the character of the tasks which Russian troops are performing 
in Georgia and the conditions of their stay will change, insofar 
as the cost of their upkeep will be shared equally. The 
functions of the Russian troops will also change significantly 
-- they will take part in collectively safeguarding the security 
of the Transcaucasian region. Russia intends to maintain a 
grouping of 23,000 servicemen in the Transcaucasus. In 
addition, it is planned to locate a further base in Armenia and 
a military facility in Azerbaijan. 
  Pavel Grachev stated that the heads of the two states will 
be 
presented with the prepared draft of a "Protocol Between the 
Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia on the Intended 
Creation of Russian Military Bases on Georgian Territory." Two 
further protocols have been prepared -- on the exchange of 
military delegations and on technical aviation support for 
aircraft and equipment on both Russian and Georgian territory. 
  The Russian Federation defense minister rejected Abkhazian 
fears that Russia intends to significantly reinforce the 
Georgian Army in technical respects. He stated that any steps 
in this direction are possible only in the event of the solution 
of the Abkhazian problem by political methods. 
  In an exclusive interview with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Army General 
Grachev stressed that the military delegation will raise at the 
talks the issue of the inescapable liability of nationalist 
extremist forces whose actions have led to the deaths of Russian 
servicemen.

  [Excerpts] Tbilisi, Feb 2 (AFP) -- A Russian request to 
station 18,000 troops in Georgia in three military bases is to 
be at the centre of talks here Thursday between Presidents Boris 
Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze, a top Russian official said. 
  The official, Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, arrived here 
Wednesday [2 February] on the eve of the summit, highlighting 
the importance of military issues in the meeting between the two 
heads of state, independent Georgian sources said. 
  The defence minister said Russia would be willing to keep 
troops in Georgia, where they have been instrumental in putting 
down an insurgency against Shevardnadze, as long as three bases 
are set up for them after an interim agreement expires in 1995. 
  Russia is also planning to station forces at two other bases 
in the troubled Caucasus region -- Georgia, Armenia and 
Azerbaijan -- where it currently has 23,000 men under arms. 
  Moscow has said it plans to remain involved in the security 
of many of the former Soviet states and will station troops in 
the area that it now calls "the near-abroad." 
  But while the talks in Tbilisi will focus on bilateral 
relations, the bloody Abkhaz rebellion in western Georgia is 
likely to preoccupy both sides. 
  Yeltsin bodyguards have warned they fear possible incidents 
sparked by anger in Georgia over perceived Russian support for 
the Abkhaz separatists who wrested control of the Black Sea 
region from Tbilisi in September. 
  The summit, which comes after two years of frosty relations, 
could reverse perceived alliances with the Abkhaz fearing Russia 
is about to offer a military alliance to Georgia, at the expense 
of their separatist republic. 
  Already, the Abkhaz government leader, Sokrat Dzhindzholia, 
has protested at the proposed signing in Tbilisi on Thursday of 
a "friendship and cooperation" treaty between Russia and 
Georgia, which he claims would "open the Russian arsenal to 
Tbilisi." [passage omitted] 
  More than 100 Russian officials have arrived in Tbilisi 
ahead 
of the summit, notably to ensure Yeltsin's safety.

<F P=106> [Report by Petr Zhuravlev under the "Visit" rubric: "Boris </F>
Yeltsin in Georgia. Moscow and Tbilisi Sign Good-Neighbor 
Treaty"] 
  [Text] On Thursday morning the Russian Federation 
president arrived in Tbilisi, where he is expected to sign a 
wide-ranging treaty with Georgia. In addition it is planned to 
sign a whole series of documents, including agreements on the 
status and conditions of the presence of Russian border troops 
in Georgia and a free-trade agreement between the two countries. 
According to Andrey Kozyrev, a centerpiece of the Tbilisi talks 
will be the problem of conflict settlement in Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia. 
  The friendship treaty between the Russian Federation and 
Georgia would not be different from other documents of such type 
were it not for two articles in the text that make it sound more 
like a military-political agreement. What is at issue in the 
first place is Article 3, which stipulates that Moscow and 
Tbilisi "conclude an agreement on providing assistance in 
organizing the armed forces of the Republic of Georgia; 
equipping them and procuring armaments, military hardware, and 
technology without the right to transfer them to third persons 
other than upon consent of the Russian Federation." Under 
Article 4, Russia and Georgia undertake to "take measures to 
stop attempts to use their territories to create subversive 
groups" and also to prevent "the infiltration into the territory 
of the other side of formations planning to overthrow or to 
change its constitutional order or to violate its territorial 
integrity." 
  In light of the above two articles, Eduard Shevardnadze's 
recent statements that the thaw in Georgian-Russian relations is 
not to the Abkhazian leaders' advantage because it robs them of 
"a base for separatism" is becoming more understandable. In 
fact, that section of the treaty is clearly pro-Georgian or 
anti-Abkhazian, which is actually the same thing. To all 
appearances, it will be difficult to have the treaty ratified in 
the Federal Assembly. At any rate, yesterday the leaders of the 
agrarians, communists, "Russia's Choice," and "Yabloko" signaled 
their negative attitude to its current phrasing. 
  As for President Yeltsin's immediate entourage, the greatest 
doubts were raised by the very idea of a head of the Russian 
state's paying a visit to Georgia. An authoritative 
presidential adviser said that the visit was supported only by 
Andrey Kozyrev. The other day Mr. Yeltsin had to learn a whole 
series of openly critical opinions from his consultants on 
international problems. In particular, although the duration of 
the visit was reduced to one day instead of two, its itinerary 
still included a meeting with representatives of the Georgian 
intelligentsia. In the view of presidential experts, Tbilisi's 
intellectuals have an extremely disapproving view of Eduard 
Shevardnadze, who will, naturally, accompany his Russian 
counterpart to the meeting. That same presidential adviser told 
SEGODNYA that "what is at issue is not whether the meeting will 
be conclusive and fruitful, but whether we will be able to avoid 
incidents." 
  The problem of possible "incidents" was considered among the 
most serious ones during the preparation for the visit. An 
advance team of the Kremlin security service, which traveled to 
Tbilisi a few days ago "to study the situation on the ground," 
presented a detailed report to their patron, a reliable source 
said. The report concluded that going to the Georgian capital 
was simply impermissible given the degree of the spread of the 
most diverse firearms left from the time of the Abkhazian war. 
Boris Yeltsin, however, ignored the opinion of his own 
bodyguards. 
  Georgian special services, too, have been taking emergency 
security measures on the eve of the visit. According to news 
agencies, the operations to protect and to keep track of the 
Russian president's route will involve 5,000 policemen and 
around 300 officers of the Georgian Security Ministry.

  [Text] Tbilisi February 3 TASS -- Russo-Georgian summit 
talks began at the Georgian Government House here on Thursday 
morning. The heads of the two states -- Boris Yeltsin and Eduard 
Shevardnadze -- are now having tete-a-tete talks. 
  Members of the two official delegations are meeting at the 
same time behind closed doors in order to make the negotiations 
more comprehensive and constructive. 
  ITAR-TASS has learned that bilateral, primarily economic 
relations between the two countries are now being discussed by 
First Vice-Chairman of the Russian council of Ministers Oleg 
Soskovets and Chairman of the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers Otar 
Patsatsia. 
  Political aspects of inter-state cooperation are being 
discussed by Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Aleksandr 
Chikvaydze. Taking part in the talks from the Georgian side is 
Chairman of the Provisional Committee for the Emergency 
Situation in the Republic Jaba Ioseliani and Head of the Human 
Rights and Inter-Ethnic Relations Committee Aleksandr Kavsadze. 
  Judging by the participants of this part of the 
negotiations, 
they are dealing not only with Russo-Georgian relations as a 
whole, but also with some aspects of the Abkhazian and South 
Ossetian problems, as well as with the rights of non-indigenous 
nationalities, particularly the Russian-speaking population. 
  Heads of the defence establishments of the two countries are 
discussing a package of draft documents on cooperation in the 
military sphere. Future military-political cooperation between 
Russia and Georgia depends on the stabilisation of the 
socio-political situation in the republic. This was stated by 
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev on the eve of President 
Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. In his opinion, this also depends 
on the settlement of problems linked with the political statuses 
of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as on Georgia's readiness 
to act in keeping with the Collective Security Treaty. 
  Then the talks were continued on a broader scale with the 
participation of the official delegations of the two countries. 
A package of bilateral Russo-Georgian documents are expected to 
be signed after them. The most important document, of course, 
is the Treaty on Friendship, Good-Neighbourly Relations, and 
Cooperation. 
  ITAR-TASS has learned from circles close to the Georgian 
delegation that the republic's leadership believes that "the 
signing of this treaty will restore the disrupted ancient ties, 
will add new substance to bilateral relations, fully meeting the 
interests of the two nations". 
  A joint press conference will be held by President Yeltsin 
and Eduard Shevardnadze after the signing ceremony. President 
Yeltsin will meet Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia Iliya II 
in the second half of the day. Then the Russian president and 
Eduard Shevardnadze will meet Georgian intellectuals. 
  An official dinner will be given in honour of the Russian 
president in the evening of the same day on behalf of head of 
the Georgian state Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  President Yeltsin will return to Moscow late on Thursday 
evening.

<F P=106> [L.T.-signed report under the "Details" rubric: "Staff </F>
Brings Itself in Line. Russian Presidential Administration 
Launches Perestroyka"] 
  [Text] The new Constitution has once again raised the 
question of authority. The Fundamental Law requires that it be 
concentrated primarily in the hands of a president. The 
president, apparently, does not object. Still, can this 
objective be achieved without a strong and qualified staff -- at 
least as qualified as, say, the government's? After the 
successful adoption of the Constitution there has been only one 
answer to the question: the presidential staff should be 
brought "in line." 
  They say that at least two reorganization plans competed in 
the Kremlin lobbies. The author of the first plan was Viktor 
Ilyushin, the second one was drawn up by Sergey Filatov. As 
soon as Sergey Filatov gave up his deputy seat to stay on in his 
office, however, it became clear that it would be he who will 
evidently head the presidential administration's perestroyka. 
At present not only has Sergey Filatov prepared a plan for this 
restructuring, but certain provisions of it have already been 
implemented. Yeltsin, however, has yet to approve its general 
concept. So, what is it that Sergey Filatov is going to propose 
to the president? 
  In the first place, he suggested that the president's 
information support should be dealt with in a more thorough 
fashion. To this end, two analytical centers -- for general 
policy and for socioeconomic policy -- will be merged into one. 
It is not yet clear who will head the new center. One thing is 
clear, however: Neither Anatoliy Rakitov, nor Petr Filippov, who 
headed the former analytical structures, are considered among 
candidates for the new post. The single analytical service will 
bring together all information flows: government and Federal 
Assembly documents, reports from the ground, and also mass media 
publications. At the same time the so-called "situation room," 
in which information will be processed by special software, will 
start operating. 
  Aside from the information service, a center for drawing up 
presidential programs (possibly under Nikolay Malashev) will be 
set up. 
  It is also proposed to expand the powers of the service in 
charge of relations with the territories and the control 
administration. There is a plan whereby the control 
administration will set up its local branches. 
  Another service will deal with parties and public 
organizations. It cannot be ruled out that it will be set up on 
the basis of Georgiy Satarov's Sociopolitical Center. A 
structure on international problems is also in the works. 
  To all appearances, the president will want to increase his 
own control over personnel in various echelons of power, 
including through setting up appropriate services within his 
administration. 
  But for the time being these are only blueprints... But why 
has Yeltsin not okayed them yet? The president has already 
approved the post of his representative at the Federal Assembly 
and appointed Aleksandr Yakovlev to the office. The first step 
"to bring the staff in line" has thus been taken. What remains 
is to wait for the next one.

  [Text] Moscow February 2 TASS -- The resignation of Yegor 
Gaydar, Boris Fedorov and Ella Pamfilova has considerably 
weakened the government, Russian Vice-Prime Minister Anatoliy 
Chubays said. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday, 
Chubays 
said that "there is a threat to the course of reform, although a 
potential one." "There is not a single decision of the 
government which could be regarded as a move to slow down or 
stop reforms," he said. 
  Chubays stressed that the government will adopt a budget for 
the first quarter of the year shortly. "Only after that will we 
be able to understand whether the government is ready to 
continue the course of reform which was pursued in 1993. It 
will also become clear whether the government will continue the 
programme adopted in September 1993," he said. 
  "Only after that can one give a final assessment of the 
government reshuffle," the vice-premier said. 
  Speaking about his plans for the future, Chubays said that 
he 
"intends to bear responsibility for the course of privatisation 
to the end." "The programme of privatisation continues to 
develop. According to our programme, bigger and more efficient 
enterprises will be put on auction in February, March and 
April," he added. 
  Chubays expressed the confidence that the "programme of 
privatisation will be implemented in full and within the terms 
envisaged by the presidential decree."

Shatalin and others to work on adjusting reforms. According to 
Interfax's information, these economists have recently drawn up 
a report with a negative assessment of the course of economic 
reforms pursued for the past two years, and concluding that it 
was necessary to draw up a new socio-economic strategy.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Vyzhutovich report: "The Return of the </F>
`Party-Economic Nomenklatura' to Power in the Regions Could 
Force Yeltsin To Make Concessions"] 
  [Text] Nikolay Medvedev, chief of the Administration for 
Work With Territories under the Russian president's staff, has 
stated that he does not rule out the possibility of the 
formation of a kind of "red belt" around Moscow consisting of 
regions with strong anti-reform and anti-president tendencies. 
The danger of this in connection with the elections to the 
local organs of power was also noted by Sergey Filatov at a 
conference with the president's representatives in the provinces. 
  The first signs of the return of the party-economic 
nomenklatura to power at local level were convincingly and 
graphically demonstrated by Penza Oblast, where 40 out of the 45 
seats in the legislative assembly went to former party committee 
secretaries, deputies of abolished soviets, heads of 
administrations and their deputies, and directors of plants and 
sovkhozes. In a report in IZVESTIYA yesterday our correspondent 
in Penza said that one reason for this triumph was manipulation 
by the local electoral committee, which formed the district in 
such a way as to ensure that the number of voters in the city 
district exceeded the rural electorate two to three times over. 
However, according to the Statute on Elections approved by the 
president's edict, that discrepancy in size should not exceed 10 
percent. 
  "This norm, however, is purely a recommendation," Aleksandr 
Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, 
told your IZVESTIYA commentator. "That is why the outright 
violations of the Statute on Elections in the actions of the 
Penza authorities are not being examined. The election 
procedure in the provinces is determined by the heads of 
administrations, according to Article 77 of the Constitution, 
which prescribes that the system of organs of state power in the 
republics, krays, oblasts, cities of federal significance, the 
autonomous oblast, and autonomous okrugs is established by the 
components of the Russian Federation independently. The Central 
Electoral Commission has no right to impose rigid standards on 
the regions. These may be established only by the federal law 
on elections when that is adopted." 
  The lack of any possibility of effectively influencing the 
manner and procedure of elections in the provinces is presenting 
the central authorities with a dilemma: Either they indulge in 
propaganda rhetoric with routine complaints about local 
conservatism and the fueling of alarm about imminent 
nomenklatura revenge or else they adjust their course and bring 
it closer to the real moods and expectations of the Russian 
regions. 
  As Nikolay Medvedev told IZVESTIYA, the election association 
of democratic forces which some party romantics are ceaselessly 
calling for is hardly possible. The leader of the 
administration for work with the regions believes that, no 
matter what propaganda efforts are made, the representatives of 
opposition organizations (above all, Communists, Agrarians, and 
Zhirinovskiy supporters) will score at least 43 percent in the 
elections. The areas that look most desperate in this regard, 
according to Medvedev, are Lipetsk, Tambov, Orel, Ryazan, 
Voronezh.... This feeling is aggravated by the "absence of 
really structured democratic parties" with broad social support 
in the provinces. 
  Judging by this statement, the political distance between 
the 
"reformist" federal authorities and the "conservative" local 
authorities will be narrowed during the elections. There is 
already candid talk about an adjustment of the economic course 
and its considerable social orientation. For the first time it 
is officially confirmed that it is no longer just the premier 
but also the president himself who will personify and guarantee 
this course. 
  Given this prospect, fears of a possible confrontation 
between the central and local authorities seem exaggerated. It 
seems that the president himself will not permit anything of the 
kind: His political course will most probably undergo changes 
in directions already defined by Viktor Chernomyrdin.

<F P=106> [Maksim Sokolov analysis: "Relationship Between Yeltsin and </F>
Chernomyrdin. Waiting for a Flop"] 
  [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was expected to address 
the Federation Council on Monday, indicated at yesterday's press 
conference that he is only going to address the parliamentarians 
after Boris Yeltsin has spoken in the Federal Assembly. The 
president is expected to attend the joint session of the 
chambers on 18 February. Relations between the president and 
the premier are analyzed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY observer Maksim 
Sokolov: 
  The president's desire to distance himself from the prime 
minister's new economic course would have been surprising only 
if the talk about "humanization," "easing," and so forth of 
reforms corresponded to reality. If an "era of humanism" does 
arrive, Yeltsin's saying "It wasn't me who did it," would truly 
sound absurd -- who would voluntarily refuse to accept the title 
of a good ruler? But it is far simpler and more logical to 
suppose that far from being made humane, the economic policy is 
being made only different -- because gaining the upper hand at 
the present moment, to use the language of Marxism, is the 
detachment of the monopoly bourgeoisie (the raw material lobby) 
that is oriented to inflation. 
  The politician cannot obviously ignore the present 
correlation of forces in the detachments of the monopoly 
bourgeoisie -- hence the presidential ratification of the new 
Chernomyrdin cabinet. He cannot, however, ignore the fact that 
the new economic policy has no way of being more popular than 
the previous one. The novel by Melnikov-Pecherskiy "On the 
Hills" has one fish merchant reproaching another for dumping: 
"Think about your neighbors." The rejoinder is: "Our 
neighbors are not all fish merchants." Realizing that our 
neighbors are not all directors, it would be strange to gamble 
on what remains of presidential prestige in a bid just to wet 
the appetites of that lobby. It is more advantageous by far to 
preserve those remnants and to demonstrate publicly his absolute 
readiness to dump Chernomyrdin at the first opportunity. 
  In this sense, Yeltsin, Gaydar, Zhirinovskiy, and Yavlinskiy 
-- otherwise dissimilar in all respects -- are related by their 
rational or instinctive realization of the fact that given the 
rather weak Russian finances, the resource for jacking up 
inflation is very small, and the short-lived and small initial 
pleasure (if it comes at all) would rapidly deteriorate into the 
hard and prolonged Ukrainian morning after. Instead of having 
to suffer through no fault of your own, it is much wiser to step 
aside, later to reappear in spotless snow-white garb. Such a 
unanimous desire to let the agrarian-industrial gargantuans get 
roaring drunk has been dictated by the realization that a flop 
is inevitable, by the realization of the inability to stave it 
off, or by the desire at least to turn it to one's own political 
advantage. 
  The situation would have been trivial, and Chernomyrdin's 
prospects totally hopeless, had the premier not realized how 
eagerly everyone is awaiting his looming debacle. In order to 
frustrate everyone's expectations of such a thing, a politician 
during his brief time at bat should try to make the situation 
irreversible. Either economically -- like Gaydar did in letting 
prices go, thinking that you cannot make them come back with a 
stick. Or politically -- like Premier Pavlov, who in summer 
1991 sought for himself dictatorial powers that would, if 
realized, have shriveled President Gorbachev into a purely 
decorative figure. Striving for this irreversibility, it would 
be logical for Chernomyrdin to increase the scope of his powers 
sharply, pulling into his orbit of influence the "power 
ministers" so far subordinated to the president on the one hand, 
and on the other, to get the economy solidly on the needle of 
inflation injections. Correspondingly, Yeltsin's logic is to 
retain the "power men" at any price, and pray to God that 
hangover from the issuance of credits comes as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "Viktor Chernomyrdin Makes </F>
Modifications to Andrey Kozyrev's Stance"] 
  [Text] Disagreements within the Russian Government, which 
until recently manifested themselves mostly in the economic 
sphere, have spread to diplomacy. The foreign policy course 
associated with the name of Andrey Kozyrev and broadly meeting 
with the support of Boris Yeltsin has apparently acquired a 
serious opponent in the shape of Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  Until now the only foreign policy issue to which the head of 
government has devoted attention has been the territorial 
dispute with Japan. On Tuesday, to the surprise of many, 
Chernomyrdin expressed his views on the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia, stating that Russia is categorically against Western 
air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions. These words were 
spoken several hours after a news conference given by Andrey 
Kozyrev at which the minister did not rule out air strikes 
against the Serbs, Croats, or Muslims, in the event of an attack 
by them on the UN peacekeeping forces. 
  All the signs suggest that Chernomyrdin considered the 
stance 
of the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs insufficiently 
firm, and hastened to modify it. The foreign media reacted 
immediately to the prime minister's words, devoting lengthy 
commentaries to "the disagreements between Kozyrev and 
Chernomyrdin." 
  Smolensk Square [site of RF Foreign Ministry] is not 
inclined 
to dramatize the situation. "I believe Chernomyrdin is not in 
possession of detailed information. In opposing the bombing of 
Serb positions he was evidently thinking of the `punitive 
strikes' for which some politicians in the West are calling. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated its 
negative attitude toward such plans. So there are no 
fundamental disagreements between the prime minister and the 
minister of foreign affairs," a high-ranking Russian diplomat 
believes. 
  Nevertheless, Chernomyrdin's encroachment into the 
diplomatic 
sphere is an alarming signal for Andrey Kozyrev. It cannot be 
ruled out that the prime minister is already thinking about the 
1996 presidential elections, in the runup to which he must 
present to voters not only an economic but also a foreign policy 
program. 
  Since Chernomyrdin will most likely look to the conservative 
part of the electorate, it is logical to assume that his remarks 
will not infrequently differ from the views of the foreign 
minister and approach the stances of the national-communist 
majority in the Duma.

  [Text] Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice bloc, 
has called on the Democratic Russia Movement to set up a 
political alliance. Such a party could coordinate actions to 
defend civil rights, counter communist and fascist propaganda, 
and conduct election campaigns more effectively. 
  Interfax has learned that Yegor Gaydar notes in a letter 
sent 
to the leadership of Democratic Russia that the December 
elections demonstrated what a broad base the conservatives and 
right-wing radicals have in our country. The present wavering 
government could kill the beginnings of stabilization and a new 
spiral of crisis could open the way to power for forces that 
would threaten Russia's very existence, Yegor Gaydar's message 
says. He also stresses that given the circumstances, all 
democratic forces needed to unite.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Oleg Lobov, Russian Security </F>
Council secretary, by Aleksandr Mikhaylov: "`The Federal 
Counterintelligence Service Must Protect Russia, Its Economic 
Interests, and the President.' Certification of 
Counterintelligence Leadership Has Begun" -- place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] At the end of January an organizational session of 
the of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service's 
Certification Commission took place, chaired by Security Council 
Secretary O. Lobov. At the end of the session O. Lobov gave an 
exclusive interview. 
  [Mikhaylov] What is the composition of the Certification 
Commission? 
  [Lobov] It includes counterintelligence service director 
Golushko and his first deputy Stepashin, as well as the 
president's national security adviser and officials from the 
presidential administration and the Security Council apparatus. 
The commission has the right to invite other people and demand 
any materials related to certification. 
  [Mikhaylov] What criteria will be used in certifying the 
officer corps? 
  [Lobov] Careful vetting will be ensured, based on criteria 
which are set on officers of this service, primarily 
professional requirements. Also their ability to operate under 
new conditions, their knowledge and experience. And naturally 
their political views: to what extent a person wishing to work 
in the new service supports the reform course. 
  The commission's task is to pursue an extremely objective 
approach in this process. 
  [Mikhaylov] A certain lull around the counterintelligence 
service arouses concern not only within this department itself 
but also around it. Many are interested in knowing when the 
certification will end and when the department will be able to 
get down to real business. 
  [Lobov] I do not think that there should be any break 
related to the commission's activity. Subject to certification 
are approximately 200 to 250 top officials who are to be 
approved under a presidential edict. This work is fairly 
responsible. Therefore we believe that the commission must not 
be rushed. The president signed his edict on 21 January and 
gave us until 1 March. No one should get nervous. I would like 
to say that even those who will be dismissed -- for age or 
health reasons -- will have considerably greater privileges than 
those that existed in the what is now known in the country's 
history as the period of stagnation. There should not be much 
anxiety that the commission has been set up to undertake any 
radical turnabouts. It is to ensure a qualified selection of 
cadres without the participation of those political structures 
that were earlier involved in such work. 
  [Mikhaylov] Being head of the Security Council, what would 
you like the Russian Counterintelligence Service to be? 
  [Lobov] I think that it should be a service protecting 
Russia's new interests. It must uphold the reforms and 
democratization. This service must support the president. For 
the first time Russia has presidential rule. It was not born 
easily. Even now it is confronted with tremendous difficulties, 
but the counterintelligence service is called upon to defend 
this new presidential rule. 
  Russia's economic interests are also becoming one of the top 
priorities. Because it is not easy to understand the meaning of 
the ruble zone or whether a union with Belarus is beneficial. 
What about the interests of Russian-speakers in the neighboring 
states or the former socialist countries? What should 
interrelations and economic links be like today? This is very 
complicated work. I would like the counterintelligence service 
to meet the demands of our times.

  [Text] Yesterday, for the first time in the past four 
months, journalists were allowed into the "White House" -- 
nowadays Government House. In the course of the next two weeks 
the entire apparatus will move here from Staraya Ploshchad. 
[Former Interior Minister] V. Barannikov's office has been 
given to First Vice Premier O. Soskovets, and Minister of 
Agriculture A. Zaveryukha has been accommodated in A. Rutskoy's 
former apartments. The building, which was 30 percent 
destroyed, has been repaired in record time. A total of 7,500 
persons were involved in the restoration work, according to 
information given by Petr Surov, deputy chairman of the 
government commission. Eight foreign firms, selected on a 
competitive basis from 209 commercial structures which expressed 
the desire "not just to earn money but also sincerely to help," 
were involved in the whole program. For example, the Turkish 
firm Gamma undertook to restore the facade of the building and 
accomplished this within 85 days. Whereas Russian construction 
organizations would not agree to start the work before April. 
Members of the government commission officially put the total 
damage caused to the building at 170 billion rubles [R]. As of 
1 January 1994 the state had already spent R56 billion and $50 
million on the restoration work.

  [Text] Moscow February 2 TASS -- Viktor Barannikov, former 
security minister who was arrested on charges of organising the 
armed opposition revolt last October 3-4 in Moscow, was released 
from jail because of health reasons, according to a decision 
adopted on Wednesday by Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik. 
  The press service of the prosecutor's office said that 
Kazannik had adopted the decision after acquainting himself with 
a medical statement which said that Barannikov "needs a special 
medical examination in hospital to decide on the necessity of 
surgical treatment which makes it impossible for him to remain 
in an investigation prison". 
  Barannikov was released on conditions that he does not leave 
Moscow. 
  Barannikov's lawyer had several times complained that his 
client was suffering from heart problems. 
  In January Barannikov was transferred from prison to a 
specially guarded hospital and his lawyer demanded that he be 
placed under house arrest.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Feb -- Anatoliy Chubays regards it as 
unthinkable to freeze the prices of raw materials and energy 
sources, since that would, in his view, lead to huge state 
subsidies for the fuel and energy complex. Answering 
journalists' questions during a news conference, the vice 
premier declared that that proposal, which is contained in a 
report drawn up by academicians Leonid Abalkin, Nikolay 
Petrakov, and Stanislav Shatalin, was dictated by nothing more 
than political expediency. "I don't think there is anything in 
the document that merits serious government discussion," he 
added. 
  Anatoliy Chubays also stated that economists (meaning the 
leaders of the Russian Central Bank) who seriously propose that 
a fixed exchange rate should be set for the ruble "are not 
suitable for responsible work in the Russian leadership." 
  Speaking of the balance of forces within the reformed 
Russian 
government, Anatoliy Chubays described it as "very difficult." 
But the positions of these forces, he continued, "are not set 
for all time to come." "The very fact that Fedorov and Gaydar 
have moved on has already brought about a situation in which the 
arduous and thankless function that they performed will be taken 
on by other members of the government. So I would not be in a 
hurry to state that the reformers in the government have 
suffered a complete reverse and that they have no resources 
left," the vice premier stressed. 
  Anatoliy Chubays announced that he has no plans to leave the 
present Russian government. "My plans are to do everything 
possible to see that the government conducts the reform policy 
for which I have worked within it for the past two years." 
  He also said that he has "good, working" relations with 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets. 
Anatoliy Chubays added that he can find a common position with 
them, even though there are differences of approach.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin </F>
by correspondent Matvey Ganapolskiy on 1 February; from the 
"Horse's Mouth" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Ganapolskiy] A strange thing has happened to our 
guest, a high-ranking state official and member of the new 
Russian cabinet. His close associates in the old cabinet 
refused to join the new one, whereas he did not. Since the new 
cabinet is already being accused of abandoning reforms, 
consequently today's interlocutor is abandoning reforms, too. 
He holds one of the most important fundamental posts, that of 
economics minister. 
  Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin, frankly speaking, when I 
learned not just about your appointment but only about your 
agreement, why did you agree? You know perfectly well that you 
will come under fire and already have. Everybody is talking 
about this, and first of all Chernomyrdin. 
  [Shokhin] I would like to recall some words from my election 
speeches, maybe even spoken in this very studio, I do not 
remember now. I said that when excessive radicalism threatens 
reforms I become a conservative, and, on the contrary, when I 
see that reforms are in danger I become a reformer. It is true 
that the situation is now such that, although reforms are not 
quite in danger, we all indeed are going through a crucial time, 
and whether this course of reforms continues or not depends to a 
great degree on each individual who has stayed in the 
government. This is the first thing. 
  Second, I think that it is not that our colleagues in the 
previous government, Gaydar and Fedorov, left because they felt 
a turn in the government's course, but to a great degree it is 
precisely because they left that there is a certain danger of 
this turn taking place. I have to state with regret that these 
colleagues of mine -- and not only in the previous government 
but perhaps in two previous governments -- have also left 
because they became frightened, they were afraid to take 
responsibility, despite the fact that they were the architects 
of many decisions, architects of reforms, responsible at this 
difficult period of reforms when many consequences, including 
the negative consequences of reforms, are having their effect. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Gaydar and Fedorov were the prime movers of 
this engine. Now it seems that, since you have stayed, you are 
a kind of second fiddle, the reverse of the coin, you are 
secondary. 
  [Shokhin] You know, it is true that both Gaydar and Fedorov 
played leading parts in the economic reforms, although there is 
a nuance which goes unnoticed. For the first nine months of 
last year Fedorov regarded himself as the main reformer, but 
after Gaydar came they tried to share the laurels of chief 
reformer for the remaining four months, and many problems were 
caused precisely by the fact that there were two chief 
reformers. The finance minister was directly subordinated to 
the prime minister, and Gaydar, who returned in the government 
to take the post of the chief ideologue of reforms, was left 
without yjr main levers of influence on the economy. 
  Incidentally, the presidential decree on the reorganization 
of the federal bodies of power at the center gave Gaydar what he 
had not had in the last four months of last year. Namely, the 
decree gave him control over the finance minister, the 
privatization minister, and the minister for foreign economic 
ties with CIS countries. That is, the three vice premiers who 
for the last few months of last year were independent, and had 
direct access to the premier -- I refer to Fedorov, Chubays, and 
Shokhin. Under the new decree, in its first version, they 
became ordinary ministers subordinate to Gaydar. Frankly 
speaking, had Gaydar gone through that period without any 
dramatic political statements he would have become a real figure 
in charge of reforms. It seems that this was exactly what the 
president's plan was -- and maybe the premier's too. But Gaydar 
decided against taking this opportunity, among other things 
probably because it was becoming clear that he himself would be 
held chiefly accountable in this scenario. So he courteously -- 
I cannot really think of any other word -- ceded responsibility 
to Chernomyrdin. 
  [Ganapolskiy] All right, we've been talking about them but 
they are not here, and so we can't hear what they have to say in 
return, as I am sure they would. But now, Aleksandr 
Nikolayevich, let's turn to you, the economics minister. I 
remember you saying that, whereas before there were abrupt 
movements, what is being done now should rather resemble working 
with a scalpel. In other words, the work has to be done with 
caution. Nonetheless, Mr. Economics Minister, I am looking at 
you, and there are some kind of hopes pinned on you -- hopes of 
all those who are watching this program, and my hopes too. I 
would very much like to believe that you are about to say 
something, not something populist, like things we can only laugh 
at now, but something realistic. 
  [Shokhin] We do indeed have to work with a scalpel now, but 
this certainly does not mean that all the decisions made last 
year have to be carried out unquestioningly, without taking any 
new measures. What is the main thing we can do now? To my 
mind, the main thing is to introduce, as it were, market 
discipline, using all possible methods, including legislative 
and economic ones. Now we have no market discipline. Something 
quite interesting has happened here. All the economic entities 
have adapted to the mess we have -- that is, to non-payments, to 
the state not meeting its obligations. If the state does not 
meet its obligations, why should an enterprise do so, why should 
it pay taxes? So, the introduction of a strict system under 
market conditions, in which everybody meets his obligation, is 
most important. Perhaps there will be a need for a few unusual 
measures of an administrative nature for installing order here. 
  [Galapolskiy] What do you mean by unusual measures? I am 
expecting you to be saying something about taxes. To all 
appearances they will rise. 
  [Shokhin] I would not like us to tackle this question in the 
way this formula was expressed last year -- there is no other 
way of drafting a good budget apart from increasing taxes and 
cutting expenditure. 
  [Galapolskiy] So that means you know some kind of secret 
which hitherto was not known to anyone. What is it now? 
  [Shokhin] It is no secret. All these secrets long ago became 
open secrets. This is, first, increasing the sphere of tax by 
decreasing the burden of tax and by increasing the toughness, 
the discipline of tax payments, into the budget. 
  [Galapolskiy] How is this to be done? In our country we have 
a kind of new police; we have a tax service, and the Ministry of 
Finance is in operation. 
  [Shokhin] You asked me a question: how is it to be done? It 
can be done by means of tax reform. For many months now, even 
before the elections, I have spoken among other things about the 
fact that there is a need for more tax rights and financial 
resources to be transferred not only to the subjects of the 
Federation but also to the level of local self-government, to 
the level of the towns and villages, for as little resources as 
possible to be driven into the center. 
  We will hardly be able to achieve a replenishment of the 
treasury from such simple instruments, like increasing the rates 
of tax. Therefore, I would resolve at some moment, while 
maintaining the same tax rates, to embark on some broad 
concessions understandable to all, connected with stimulating 
investments and particular types of activity, specific types of 
activity, primarily connected with increasing production of 
output and services, and so on. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Is that your point of view or is it a proposal 
which was somehow discussed? 
  [Shokhin] These are not just my proposals. These are the 
proposals of the ministry. They cannot be solely considered the 
proposals of the Ministry of Economics. We are working closely 
with the Ministry of Finance, too. I do not think that the 
Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Finance should be 
antagonists. One department lobbies for favorable credits. The 
Ministry of Economics is usually this kind of department. And 
the Ministry of Finance will stand guard over financial 
stabilization. 
  Unless we agree on ways of implementing credit policy and 
specific investment projects, there will be many cracks for 
pro-inflationary decisions to get through. There is a classic 
example on which we will probably concentrate our efforts. This 
is the notorious selective policy. Already this phrase has 
become a term of abuse for the government's opponents, who 
consider the selective policy a device by which the government 
will hand out money left and right. 
  But the most important thing for us now is not simply the 
distribution of money to certain restricted projects, but the 
way in which the projects are selected. Up to now money tended 
to go to plants, regions, industries, industrial ministries, and 
committees which selected the projects themselves. Naturally 
money often disappeared without trace. Our objective is to 
evaluate every project on a banking basis, on commercial 
criteria perhaps, to assess its effectiveness and the likely 
return. Only after these projects have been assessed by the 
same standards, after they have passed through the eye of this 
needle, will they qualify for financial support, bearing in mind 
that budget resources available for this purpose are 
exceptionally small. 
  [Ganapolskiy] I am very anxious that the primary aim of this 
program -- in the context of our meeting with you, the economics 
minister, at any rate -- should be to extol hope in our viewers. 
Although you are not new people -- you are all well known -- 
there has been a bit of a reshuffle and we are taking a further 
move toward common sense, toward a kind of logic. If a man like 
Mikhail Zadornov, not the satirical writer, although as chairman 
of the parliamentary committee on budget and finance you could 
say that Zadornov is a kind of satirical writer. But his 
remarks about economic reform are far from funny. He says it 
has no point in the immediate future and that a steep rise in 
inflation is inevitable. He was quite emphatic about it. If he 
can say this, what does it mean? Why am I asking this? Not 
because I want you to reject or confirm what he says. My point 
is this: Despite your good intentions, won't you be simply 
overwhelmed by the overall tendency which has now come about, by 
the turnabout in policy? 
  [Shokhin] The turnabout which has been sketched has been 
sketched by specific people. This is not a spontaneous protest 
by, say, the public or the regions, and so on. This is really a 
carefully planned political show. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Can you now give me any guarantee that you 
are not, by your presence in government, an element of a 
different political show, dictated by the need to leave a few 
figures associated with reform in the government, so as to avoid 
a great outcry and strikes? Once you are no longer needed... 
  [Shokhin, interrupting] Once the deed has been done? 
  [Ganapolskiy] Yes, I didn't want to be so explicit, once the 
deed has been done, they can shake your hand and say goodbye. 
  [Shokhin] I could of course suspect that such a scenario has 
also been written. However, to be frank, if this scenario 
suddenly turns out to be a reality, I will not allow myself to 
be exploited, of course. 
  [Ganapolskiy] All right. What do you think the ruble 
exchange rate will be by the end of the year, what is your 
figure? 
  [Shokhin] I believe the rate will grow in line with 
inflation, more or less, but I would not like to forecast the 
rate of inflation, so as not to stir up inflationary 
expectations. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Do you ask your wife for advice -- she is an 
economist -- on state matters? 
  [Shokhin] I do. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Have there been many failures in your life? 
  [Shokhin] All the failures I have had later turned into 
successes. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Do you expect an upsurge in strikes? Yes or 
no? 
  [Shokhin] There will be strikes. 
  [Ganapolskiy] What has to happen to force you to resign? One 
development. 
  [Shokhin] Only one development and I talked about it 
earlier: 
I have to find myself in a situation whereby I feel that I have 
no levers to influence the situation, and that I am not looked 
upon as a key figure in the cabinet. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Did you want to take this post or another one? 
  [Shokhin] Another one. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Which one? 
  [Shokhin] I wanted to retain the post I had been holding. 
  [Ganapolskiy] That of a vice premier. 
  [Shokhin] A vice premier in charge of foreign economic ties 
and the CIS. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Are you still on good terms with Gaydar? 
  [Shokhin] My relations with Gaydar were wrecked in December 
1992, when he was leaving the government for the first time. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Do you hope to solve some questions directly 
with Yeltsin, bypassing Chernomyrdin? 
  [Shokhin, sighing] Yes. 
  [Ganapolskiy] I understand. What sport do you go in for? 
  [Shokhin] Lately I have been playing tennis twice a week for 
at least two hours, on Sundays, and late in the evening during 
the week. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Here comes the final question. It is an 
abstract one but do try to answer. When shall we have a good 
life? 
  [Shokhin] Our forecasts indicate [Ganapolskiy laughing] 
sometime in 1996. 
  [Ganapolskiy] Our forecasts indeed! Well, that's the man -- 
Russia's economics minister. Just one quote to end with: After 
two years' work under Yeltsin and one year's work under 
Chernomyrdin, one can hardly suspect Shokhin or Chubays of 
political naivety. That's from the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI 
newspaper. I would like to thank you, Aleksandr Nikolayevich, 
and you, dear viewers. See you in a week's time.

  [Text] Grigoriy Yavlinskiy is the leader of Yabloko, which 
means "apple" in Russian, and it is by no mere chance that its 
first two letters are the same as the first two in his surname. 
"I am an economist forced to throw myself into politics," he 
says with a smile. "My party has about 8.5 percent of the vote 
in this country, and it is enough to get my voice heard." 
Yavlinskiy is playing the role of the anti-Chernomyrdin at the 
Davos international economic conference, almost hounding him 
from seminar to news conference and keeping up a constant stream 
of dissent. "It is time we had new faces too in Russia." 
  [Salimbeni] What do you mean, you have no more faith even in 
Fedorov, in Gaydar? 
  [Yavlinskiy] The time has come for them, too, to step aside. 
They both need to take some time out. A new generation of 
political leaders has now emerged both in and outside Moscow, 
who are fully in tune with the needs of a radical reform of the 
Russian economy and Russian society. If it were up to me to 
form a new government, I would have the names ready: Zadornov, 
head of the parliamentary commission on the budget and banking, 
Mikhaylov of the commission on economic policy, Ivanenko of the 
commission on privatization. 
  [Salimbeni] There has just been a government reshuffle, so 
it is unlikely that Yeltsin will make any more changes, don't 
you think? 
  [Yavlinskiy] We shall see. There is no doubt about one 
thing: The individual ministers still count for little in my 
country, and it is the "premier" who gives the orders. That was 
how it was with Gorbachev, how it was with Gaydar, so it's 
hardly likely to be any different with Chernomyrdin. In my 
opinion, Russia has reached rock-bottom with this reshuffle and 
the ejection of Fedorov. The present government is more 
homogeneous than its predecessor; there will be no more 
paralyzing conflicts between the finance minister and the 
minister of agriculture or industry. The problem in this case 
is that homogeneity serves to slow down the reform, or rather 
the counterreform. 
  [Salimbeni] Here in Davos, the prime minister presented 
himself as the valiant defender of "neomonetarist policies" ... 
  [Yavlinskiy] I do not believe him. How many times have his 
inflation forecasts been adjusted? Just ask Fedorov: First it 
was from 3 to 5 percent, then 8 or 9, and now from 15 to 18 
percent. My forecast is 30-percent monthly inflation in early 
spring, with a drastic drop in production. After a period of 
relative stability during the summer, we shall have a black 
autumn: 50 percent a month. It will be nothing short of an 
explosion. 
  [Salimbeni] Will Gerashchenko's central bank continue 
printing money? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Gerashchenko is on slippery ground, and he too 
will somehow have to avoid measures that result in the 
government losing financial control. He will have to choose. 
The problem is that Chernomyrdin is proceeding as he has done 
to date, replacing the liquidity that the industrial and 
military enterprises need. The domestic and foreign markets 
continue to decline, and no one is laying up currency reserves. 
There is a constant drain on capital, and there is no 
stabilization program: $50 billion have vanished to the west 
and Asia. The pattern of relations between the state and 
businesses, the state and producers has now become 
schizophrenic: Either they churn out rubles and distribute them 
or they fail to pay for the products. If you had been a Russian 
farmer full of good intentions at the time of the Gaydar 
government, how would you have reacted if the state had bought 
your grain without paying for it? And do you know why the 
farmers were so trusting as to give their grain to the state? 
They had no choice, they simply would not have been able to 
sell it any other way. Our distribution system is paralyzed or 
run by the Mafia. And they managed not to step up the pace of 
agricultural reform so as not to dismantle the old state trading 
departments. 
  [Salimbeni] After the two years of the Gaydar-Fedorov 
government, the balance was not entirely negative, but the 
"shock therapy" that we heard so much about only lasted for the 
first four months of 1992; nevertheless, it reduced the 
inflation rate and the public deficit. 
  [Yavlinskiy] That is true. Gaydar took pretty firm action 
against inflation, he had clear ideas on reform, he did not want 
to print paper money to meet the needs of the big military and 
industrial structures. But he very soon lost the support of the 
people. However, we were living in different times then. 
Chernomyrdin, today, has no governing strategy in mind. I do 
not even believe he can have seen the story of his own life. 
The only thing he believes in is increasing production at any 
cost, without considering structural issues, those of a new 
balance of power, the currency, the urgent need to give the 
ruble a real market value, to resume monetary relations between 
Russia and the other CIS states on a realistic footing. 
  [Salimbeni] Does Yavlinskiy the reformer also accept the 
idea of the "great ruble"? 
  [Yavlinskiy] First and foremost, both Russia and the other 
states must be aware of what is happening. When the Ukrainian 
Government contacted me to ask advice on monetary policy, I 
asked whether they had any idea of the status of their balance 
of payments, of their domestic and foreign debt. Nothing, they 
knew nothing. A great black hole. My dear friends, we will get 
together some other time, I told them. 
  [Salimbeni] What is your greatest fear at this time? 
  [Yavlinskiy] A raising of nationalist barriers: The 
political orientation and the very mentality of the team of 
ministers have narrowed as regards both financial and 
international policy. The priorities have changed. Look, I 
have no faith even in all this talk about western aid. They 
profess themselves worried, but at heart they know we shall be 
able to get by. What is more, not even I think that western 
capital can solve our problems: Neither the government nor 
Russian society are ready to make use of it. What I would ask 
of the West is massive technical support in drawing up the 
programs for reforming the financial and industrial structures, 
in getting the state to exercise its proper functions. U.S. 
Vice President Gore was wrong to launch the "less shock, more 
therapy" slogan. Of course, it is a fine idea in theory, but, 
as my grandmother would say, it is better to be rich and happy 
than desperate.

  [Text] Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin called for 
keeping the price rises at a monthly rate of 12 percent and for 
keeping the national budget deficit within eight to 10 percent 
of the gross domestic product in 1994. 
  In his first public speech after his appointment Dubinin 
told 
the Duma Budgetary Commission Wednesday night that there had to 
be no replay of 1993 "when the budget indices were unduly high." 
That approach, he said, was justly criticized by numerous 
ministries who complained of shortage of funds, in particular 
for defense orders and agriculture. 
  "We agree that the projects planned in 1993 for the first 
quarter (of 1994) have to be financed. We are looking for 
additional sources of revenue and believe that financial 
priorities must be set," Dubinin said. In his words, 4 Tn 
[trillion] rubles will be appropriated for that purpose in the 
first quarter of 1994 but "now priorities are being set for 
using this amount." 
  The acting minister said: "We know that tax revenues in the 
first quarter of the year will amount to 8.5 Tn rubles and we 
will receive nothing over that amount. Therefore the expenses 
must be kept within these limits. We also know for sure that 
the tax revenues will not exceed 80 to 100 Tn rubles during the 
year." 
  Dubinin thought that significant revenues were not to be 
expected from foreign trade because the export prices of Russian 
goods have become nearly equal to world market prices. 
  He said that the 1994 budget draft would be submitted to the 
government before Monday, February 7.

  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Russian budget expenses in 
1993 were close to 61 trillion roubles and comprised 37.8 per 
cent of the gross national product, according to the Finance 
Ministry. 
  The figure for 1992 equalled 33 per cent and the 1993 
increase was caused mostly by the budget article called "Other 
Expenses" which the ministry did not specify in its report on 
Tuesday. 
  The "other expenses" grew from 13.4 per cent in 1992 to 21.4 
per cent in 1993. 
  Defence expenses dropped from 14.3 to 12.4 per cent. 
  Although the major share of appropriations goes to the 
national economy, it decreased from 34.5 to 27.3 per cent. 
  More money was allocated to "social and cultural measures" - 
23.1 per cent in 1992 and 24.9 per cent in 1993. 
  Approrpiations for science, police, governing and 
controlling 
bodies, as well as for foreign economic activities varied from 
1.6 to 5.1 per cent in 1993. 
  Finance Ministry experts said that budget spendings 
increased 
because of credits for grain purchases in Russia, for conversion 
and loans to CIS states.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1700 GMT on 2 February, in its "Vesti" newscast, 
broadcasts a 3-minute report by correspondent Gindileyev on 
problems in the security service. The announcer introduces the 
report by saying: "Our correspondent met with another 
representative of the security service today. He said that an 
entire subunit of the Interior Ministry has resigned." 
  The correspondent then takes up the story. He says: "The 
`Vympel' team, one of the most secret subunits of the former 
KGB'S directorate of intelligence services, was created in 1979. 
Its aim was to carry out special operations, often military 
operations on the territory of foreign states, for example, such 
as the seizure of Amin's palace in Afghanistan. Nobody would 
ever know about this unique subunit if it were not for the 
October storm at the White House. Officers of `Vympel' and the 
`Alfa' team at that moment refused to shoot and seized the White 
House without a single shot. They saved thousands of lives. It 
seems likely that some politicians did not like this 
disobedience. The Russian president has issued an edict 
according to which `Vympel' has been transferred to the Interior 
Ministry. As a result, 110 out of 180 operational officers of 
`Vympel' have resigned." The video shows the building of the 
former KGB, then views of Afghanistan, then the seizure of the 
White House in Moscow in October, and the faces of Khasbulatov 
and Rutskoy when they surrendered. The video then cuts to show 
the back of an unidentified person in a car speaking about 
resignations in the "Vympel" team, who says: 
  "It is possible that we are talking emotionally at the 
present time but nevertheless, the opinion of many employees 
shows that this decree messed up, or more precisely, put an end 
to the existence of subunits such as `Vympel.' In practice, 
there will be nobody there soon. It seems likely that 
practically the entire officers' corps will leave. Probably 
some of them will go to commercial structures." 
  The announcer then concludes the report by saying: "It is 
clear that we should pay special attention to the fate of these 
people. In the end, peace of mind and security of the leaders of 
the state themselves depend on where they will go and whom they 
will join."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report over video entitled "When Missiles Are </F>
Dying..." detailing missile deactivation process, attributed in 
the credits to "Radar" Studio and Ministry of Defense Central 
Television and Radio Studio, August-December 1993; from the 
"Test Range" program] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Correspondent over video 
captioned "Radar-TV" showing missile transporters on the move] 
The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties concluded between the 
United States and Russia and known as START I and START II have, 
apart from verbal support, evoked no steps in response from the 
other members of the nuclear club. START II is yet to be 
ratified by Russia. Meanwhile the latter's missiles, including 
the heavy SS-18, continue to be removed from operational sites. 
This work was at its height during the summer and fall of last 
year. As in the past, missile men and defense experts displayed 
prompt and coordinated action at all the stages of the reduction 
process right up to the removal of missiles from silos and the 
draining off of missile fuel components. On the one hand, they 
were working under pressure of a tight schedule since every 
missile had to be removed from alert duty on strictly preset 
days and hours, while on the other hand they had to ensure that 
all the operations were carried out without any dangerous 
pollution of the environment ensuing. [video shows missile being 
removed from silo, personnel donning gas masks, fuel being 
siphoned off] [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent over aerial view of missile test range 
captioned "Radar-TV, VoyenTV"] Our industry cannot do something 
that it was never equipped to do, in other words to salvage 
simultaneously up to 2,000 ICBM's, hundreds of thousands of 
tonnes of special fluids and nuclear and chemical munitions. 
What is more, we lack the necessary resources. 
  This also applies to cleaning up the Russian Missile Forces' 
sole test range which covers an area of 175,000 hectares. 
During test launches certain parts of the delivery vehicle 
separate. They contain toxic rocket fuel residue. All this 
does not burn up in the atmosphere but falls to the ground and 
into water reservoirs. Two years ago the leadership of the 
Missile Forces together with (?"Transres"), a special science 
and production center, tried for the first time to carry out a 
mass cleanup of the test range, using their own resources. More 
than 2,000 tonnes of delivery vehicle debris was collected, but 
only a small part of the test range was cleared. 
  By agreeing to sweeping reductions of the most powerful and 
technically most sophisticated missiles, Russia has not only 
forfeited its status as an influential partner in resolving 
strategic issues, but it also finds itself in a most 
disadvantageous position in terms of the need to observe all the 
necessary ecological and environmental protection safeguards 
during the elimination of the stockpiled weapons. [video shows 
aerial view of missile test range, test launch, computer 
graphics, debris littering the test range] [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent over video of operation to remove nose 
section 
from silo, captioned "RADAR TV"] Today Russia is reaping the 
fruits of the most critical period of its military policy when, 
as a result of cuts in military production, it was forced to 
extend the guaranteed period of service of nuclear missiles on 
alert duty. Consequently, the safe service life of 30 percent 
of these missiles has already expired. And another 30 percent 
will turn into a potential nuclear threat in two years' time. 
Russia is faced with the task of scrapping more than 20,000 
nuclear munitions by the year 2000. And since the pace of the 
salvage process is very slow, we may again fall hostages to the 
nuclear threat, but this time because of being incapable of 
carrying out mass industrial salvaging of such a vast quantity 
of nuclear charges. 
  The radiation background at the launch site is only just 
above the permissible limit [video shows counter reading]. 
Furthermore, all the operations are controlled by several 
specialists simultaneously. Therefore the removal of the nose 
section at the launch site is by no means the most dangerous 
operation. [video shows operations above ground and detailed 
view of interior of missile silo] [passage omitted] 
  [Video shows nose section removal operation over largely 
unintelligible exchanges between officers] [passage omitted] 
  [Unit Commander A. Gribov, over video of site being guarded 
by a soldier, sign reading "Mines," nose section being loaded 
onto truck] It has to be said that this is by no means the 
least important or worst of our weapons. Fortunately, it has 
never been used in practice. But the tests that were carried 
out showed that both the missile and the warheads are excellent 
and highly effective. 
  [Correspondent over closeup of nose section being loaded 
onto 
truck] The nuclear nose cone of the SS-18 missile can carry 10 
nuclear warheads. At the moment there is nothing to compare 
with it in the world. 
  This unusual cargo will be carried in this neat truck only 
as 
far as the nearest depot. Before entering the industrial 
salvaging process, it has a difficult journey along worn-out 
Russian roads ahead. [video shows warhead being loaded, truck on 
the move] [passage omitted] 
  [Aleksandr Volkov, first deputy commander in chief of 
Strategic Missiles Forces, over video of missiles on railroad 
platforms in a siding in snowy location] We have established 
two bases for scrapping missiles, the Surovatikha base, and 
Pibanshur near the city of Izhevsk. 
  [Correspondent over video of missiles being dismantled in 
large hangar] Pibanshur and Surovatikha are Russia's first 
bases for scrapping ICBM's using resource-saving technologies. 
Following the removal of the dangerous fuel components, each 
SS-17 and SS-18 missile will be carefully dismantled. In this 
way the Surovatikha base will be able to scrap more than 40 
heavy missiles a year. This means that thousands of tonnes of 
expensive metals and alloys will be returned to industry. 
  As is known, the previous class of missiles -- 
intermediate- and shorter-range missiles -- were scrapped by 
means of explosions. To the general amazement of our 
compatriots, billions of rubles were turned into ashes and 
smoke, quite apart from the damage that was done to the 
environment. This is why the two new enterprises -- which, 
incidentally, have been set up by the missile forces themselves 
within their department -- unquestionably mark a long-overdue 
step toward savings of state resources spent on disarmament. 
  For the time being inadequate funding is hampering the 
entire 
federal program for recycling ecologically dangerous materials 
from scrapped weapons. The Surovatikha base could make up this 
shortage of funds through the sale of part of the salvaged 
materials to other enterprises for processing. But the latter 
do not have any money either. 
  While a search for coordinated action by the ministries and 
departments interested in industrial recycling is under way at 
the top, the missile men have to bear the full burden of this 
work themselves. [video shows detailed views of salvage 
operation with camera switching back to railroad siding at the 
end] [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent over video of an SS-18 on a truck, followed 
by 
computer graphics, captioned "RADAR-TV" and "VoyenTV"] To 
replace the multiple reentry vehicle missiles which are being 
scrapped, Russia is planning to build another multiple-warhead 
missile [mnogoblochnaya raketa] based on the SS-25. However, as 
distinct from the heavy SS-18 missile, the new missile cannot be 
guaranteed to penetrate the opponent's anti-missile defenses, 
since the SS-18 was capable of releasing, in addition to its 10 
warheads, up to 1,000 false targets into orbit. Scientists at 
the Moscow Heat Technology Institute intend to make up for this 
forced minus-point in the design of the nose section of the new 
missile by making these missiles easily reequipable into the 
"Start" system which can be used for launches for scientific 
purposes either right now or in the event of arms reduction. 
Admittedly, the engineers and designers will have to find the 
money to further develop this project themselves in order to 
preserve the scientific potential of Russia's only institute of 
this kind. [video shows computer graphics demonstrating new 
missile, brief shot of interior of scientific institute, mockup 
of "Start" system] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Nadezhda Garifullina: "Caucasus United Prior to </F>
President's Visit to Georgia"] 
  [Text] B. Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi and the forthcoming 
signing of the treaty between Georgia and Russia have become the 
subject of discussion at the meeting in the Foreign Ministry 
between A. Kozyrev and leaders of the North Caucasus republics. 
They expressed their critical attitude toward the draft treaty. 
Meeting with some of the participants in the meeting, our 
correspondent asked them to explain their position. 
  Akhsarbek Galazov, president of the Republic of North 
Ossetia: 
  "I believe that Russia should not sign any treaty with 
Georgia until there is a political settlement of the problem of 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia. If a treaty is signed clearly 
determining the fate of these two republics and they finally 
receive a political settlement of their problems -- I am wholly 
in favor. 
  "I believe that South Ossetia should be recognized as a 
republic and that through the joint efforts of Georgia and 
Russia an economic basis should be placed under that decision, 
that the regions which were in fact seized should be returned to 
South Ossetia and all refugees should return. 
  "Second, and that is perhaps the main thing, we are also in 
favor of Georgia's integrity. But it will not be preserved as a 
single state unless the Georgian people's leaders realize that 
they must consider realities. After all, in fact Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia are now outside Georgia. To ensure that they are 
part of Georgia they must sit down with them at the conference 
table, sign a treaty, and satisfy their peoples' demands to the 
maximum. 
  "All questions existing today in the North Caucasus cannot 
be 
examined only within that region. The Caucasus is united and 
its division into the North Caucasus and the Transcaucasus seems 
to me utterly artificial. At the meeting at the Foreign 
Ministry there were statements in which Georgia was called the 
aggressor, with whom a treaty cannot be signed. And indeed, it 
did after all in fact perpetrate aggression. Seeking to drive 
non-Georgians out of South Ossetia, Georgia seized the territory 
of what was then still an autonomous oblast. 
  "As for Abkhazia it was artificially joined to Georgia back 
in Soviet times and Georgia also perpetrated aggression against 
Abkhazia using the national extremists' forces. And we believe 
that today Russia should not sign a wide-ranging treaty with 
Georgia. The problems of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are 
closely, directly linked with Russia. Nearly all the North 
Caucasus republics, krays, and oblasts took part in the defense 
of Abkhazia. And what happened in Abkhazia has found a response 
in Adygeya, Karachayevo-Cherkesiya, Krasnodar and Stavropol 
krays, and Kabardino-Balkariya.... 
  "And surely South Ossetia's troubles cannot be viewed in 
isolation from North Ossetia? Any shot in the south echoes in 
North Ossetia. For the fourth year now not a single kilogram of 
food, not a single tablet or tube of medicine has reached South 
Ossetia from Georgia, nor have necessities been arriving. South 
Ossetia is supplied via North Ossetia and is in fact maintained 
by Russia. So surely Russia cannot sign a treaty until the 
problems of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are settled?" 
  Magomedali Magomedov, chairman of the Republic of Dagestan 
Supreme Soviet: 
  "Before discussing the draft treaty we were not familiarized 
with it in advance. I believe that as a whole the treaty is 
aimed at establishing normal mutual relations between Russia and 
Georgia. But we are worried by the position of South Ossetia 
and Abkhazia and we said that agreements with the Georgian 
leadership should be reached on these issues, that is these 
questions should not be bypassed when concluding a treaty". 
  Vladimir Khubiyev, chairman of the Karachayevo-Cherkess 
Republic Council of Ministers: 
  "I think that reason will nonetheless triumph and a 
political 
solution will be found for ensuring these republics' peaceful 
coexistence and the rights of each republic should be as they 
are determined by the peoples themselves -- of Abkhazia, South 
Ossetia, and Georgia. Now is not the time when someone can be 
switched to someone else's subordination and when a big nation 
can dictate its will to a small people. I know the opinion of 
the Abkhazians -- both the ordinary citizens and the leaders. 
They all, down to the last person, favor independence. In what 
form is another question."

"Elections for Sverdlovsk Oblast Duma Set for 10 April. City 
Duma Will be Elected at the Same Time To Save Funds"] 
  [Text] Aleksey Strakhov, new head of the Sverdlovsk Oblast 
administration, has issued a decree regarding elections for the 
oblast Duma. It sets 10 April as the precise date of the event. 
Oblast residents are to elect 28 deputies. As little as 
two-fifths of this number of people's choices are going to draw 
up normative acts on a permanent basis, with the rest working in 
the Duma while continuing in their normal jobs. 
  The elections will be held in seven districts already 
familiar to the population from the recent electoral campaign. 
They will be held on the basis of the majority system, i.e. 
four deputies in each district shall be elected by a majority of 
votes. 
  The oblast and party organizations have actively joined in 
preparing for the elections. Vyacheslav Senko, coordinator of 
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia in the Urals and western 
Siberia, has stated that 16 deputies out of the 28 would without 
fail be elected on the Zhirinovskiy party ticket. 
  Yekaterinburg Mayor Arkadiy Chernetskiy has drawn attention 
to the fact that in order to save funds, the elections for the 
city Duma will be held simultaneously with the elections for the 
Sverdlovsk Oblast Duma. It should be pointed out that no 
regulations on the elections for the city Duma have been signed 
or published yet.

<F P=106> [By G. Nikolayev, V. Myznikov, M. Faytelberg; from the </F>
"Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Nikolayev over video of open-cut coal mine] The 
Borodinskiy open-cut coal mine in Krasnoyarsk Kray is operating 
"in a state of anxious anticipation," so to speak. The term 
"strike" is no longer used here, as it has been banned by law. 
But nobody can outlaw the fact that as of 1 February the 
dispatch of fuel to persistent debtors will be suspended. The 
Krasnoyarsk Kray leadership, in a bid to recover billions in 
outstanding debts, has obtained certain allowances for its own 
region. However, the consumers -- heat and electric power 
stations and boiler houses in Novosibirsk and Irkutsk Oblasts 
and in Altay and Khabarovsk Krays -- are faced with the choice 
of either paying up or going without. As of February that means 
cutting electricity and heat supplies to industrial enterprises 
first of all, and then to the domestic sector. A state 
commission visiting the Borodinskiy open-cut coal mine was 
convinced of the justice of the coal workers' basic demands: 
Payment arrears will ultimately bring extraction to a halt, 
because equipment is not being repaired and it is deteriorating. 
Coal sector workers believe that only Moscow can unravel this 
complex financial knot. [Video shows work at the open-cut mine,

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kotlyarov: "Kuzbass on Verge of Strike"] </F>
  [Text] An all-Kuzbass conference of labor collective 
representatives has been held in Kemerovo. It was attended by 
delegates from enterprises in various industrial sectors, the 
budget-funded sphere, and rural residents; leaders of a number 
of firms, joint-stock companies, and sectoral trade unions; as 
well as V. Goncharov, deputy chairman of the Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions of Russia. Despite being officially 
invited, the oblast administration, which, incidentally, 
unilaterally terminated its involvement in the tripartite oblast 
commission for the resolution of labor conflicts shortly 
beforehand, ignored this representative assembly. 
  But the question under discussion at the conference is 
highly 
topical: "The socioeconomic situation in the Kuzbass and 
tactics in the prevailing conditions." The situation in the 
region is extraordinary and is steadily deteriorating. One by 
one enterprises are coming to a standstill. The total credit 
indebtedness has topped 2 trillion rubles [R]. And production 
is continuing to decline. Thus production dropped 21 percent 
last year in sectors working for the consumer market. Workers' 
wages depreciated 20 percent a month. Miners alone have 
currently failed to receive R29 billion in wages and the figure 
is around R24 billion for budget-funded personnel.... 
  The further stratification of society is proceeding at an 
accelerated pace. Some 18-24 months ago the income of the poor 
was one-third or one-fourth that of the rich, now it is lower by 
a factor of 26! And what about underlying unemployment? There 
are now 78,000 people on enforced extended leave or working a 
reduced working day. 
  The conference participants adopted a set of demands to put 
to the government and the president. The main ones being that a 
program for socioeconomic transformations and a solution to the 
economic crisis be published within one month and that a 
mechanism be established to provide compensation for the damage 
done to the health of the oblast's population by environmental 
pollution. 
  In view of the prevailing situation and the opinion of labor 
collectives, it was decided to declare a general strike in the 
oblast and elect a coordinating council of labor collective 
representatives.

<F P=106> [Appeal to Boris Yeltsin from Federation Council Deputy A. </F>
Tuleyev under general heading: "Russia Pregnant With Strike"] 
  [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich, 
  As a Federation Council deputy I am obliged to send you a 
written request and obliged to tell you the following. 
  In the Kuzbass, where you were nominated for president and 
where miners have been your constant support, an extreme 
economic and political emergency has taken shape. 
  You know that it is connected with the stoppage of 
enterprises, reciprocal nonpayments, the nonfulfillment of your 
edicts and instructions, and unemployment. People have been 
unable to get their wages for five months. There is a wild, 
uncontrolled increase in prices. And most important, people are 
not protected from the rampage of crime, they live in fear of 
their lives in the full sense of the word. 
  My frequent appeals to the government and to you personally 
are left without proper attention. Unless urgent and effective 
steps are taken right now, the most terrible thing -- a general 
strike -- could occur in the Kuzbass. In terms of its strength 
it would be the 1989 strike, in which you took part, but 
squared. If it is allowed it will deal a terrible blow to the 
Russian economy because the lack of coal will bring everything 
to a standstill. 
  My conscience is clear. I have done everything I could to 
warn of this social eruption when I was chairman of the oblast 
soviet before you dissolved the representative organs. As God 
is my witness people's demands are entirely just; the miners did 
not go on strike in 1989 in order to live in poverty and fear, 
experiencing every day the violation of human rights. I support 
the Kuzbass people's demands and, of course, I shall be with 
them. 
  I appeal to you once again as president to take urgent and 
effective steps, including those I have suggested and which are 
at present in the hands of your apparatus. 
  [Signed] Federation Council Deputy A. Tuleyev

  [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk February 2 TASS -- Reports that 
the Sakhalin governor intends to make the south Kuril Islands a 
no-entry zone, which were run by a number of the Japanese media 
last week, were disproved by Vitaliy Dubov, acting head of a 
department of the Sakhalin administration. He said these 
reports meant sensation-seeking and attempts to pass "white for 
black". 
  Chiefs of the administration now draft a resolution 
connected 
with the Russian law on the state border. Jurists consider the 
proposal to allocate in a number of districts of the Sakhalin 
region five kilometre frontier belts with special regulations 
for the stay of Russian and foreign citizens, but not the 
prohibition of their stay. 
  It is yet early to dwell on specific features of the 
document. One thing is certain: it will be fully in keeping with 
the law on the Russian border. 
  The Sakhalin governor himself favours the freedom of travel 
of citizens in the territory of their country in accordance with 
accepted norms.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Suslikov: "Dismissal of Omsk's Mayor </F>
Result of Long Political Intrigue. Boris Yeltsin Dismisses Omsk 
Mayor Yuriy Shoykhet and Cancels 20 March Mayoral Elections"] 
  [Text] On the eve of the dismissal, Omsk Oblast Governor 
L. Polezhayev announced at a routine press conference his 
decision to hold the Omsk mayoral elections 20 March. A week 
has passed and the decree on the elections, already signed by 
the governor, has not been published in the press. We have 
learned that the likely mayoral candidates -- Yu. Shoykhet and 
V. Obraztsov -- were persistently urged not to run, so as not to 
impede the candidate whom the governnor wanted to see as mayor 
of Omsk. Shoykhet and Obraztsov refused to accept these terms, 
and this sealed the fate of both the mayor of Omsk and the 
mayoral elections. Leonid Polezhayev flew to Moscow, met with 
President Yeltsin and, according to the governor himself, 
decided on the dismissal in the course of a conversation with 
the head of state. 
  "A friend telephoned me round midnight and told me a piece 
of 
news that sounded like a practical joke," Yu. Shoykhet said. 
"`Mayak' was reporting that Yeltsin had dismissed me for 
'destabilizing the situation' and 'exceeding my powers.'" 
  The meticulous journalists at the press conference put some 
very specific questions to Governor L. Polezhayev. Just what 
constitutes a "destabilization of the situation," if there has 
not ben a single strike in Omsk and the city has heat and the 
cheapest food in Siberia? What exactly constitutes "exceeding 
one's powers" if, according to the mayor of Omsk, there has not 
been a single prosecutor's appeal against city administration 
decisions? And, finally, why did he seek redress against a 
mayor who had exceeded his powers not in the people's court but 
in the president's office? 
  Polezhayev tried to get away with general phrases; he was 
nervous, and finally stated that the main reason for Shoykhet's 
dismissal was that the mayor of Omsk, who had run for the 
Federal Assembly representing "Russia's Choice," had failed in 
the election and had lost the voters' confidence. The answer 
can hardly be said to have been successful.... 
  Now it turns out that it was not the governor who deprived 
Omsk people of their right to elect their mayor.... Polezhayev 
was merely implementing the edict from President B. Yeltsin, who 
deemed the election inexpedient. It was the president who took 
the extreme action [kraynim okazalsya prezident]. 
  Here is one more theory. Governor Polezhayev, skillfully 
exploiting the political situation, has settled a personal score 
with the mayor. These men have long been rivals. Shoykhet was 
the first cooperative member in Omsk to set up a joint-stock 
company with private capital. Then L. Polezhayev, as chairman 
of the oblast soviet executive committee, set up the "Omskiy 
Torgovyy Dom" [Omsk Trading House] Joint-Stock Company founded 
by major monopoly state enterprises producing scarce goods such 
as television sets, washing machines, tires.... Without 
quitting as head of the oblast executive, Polezhayev became 
president of the trading house. Small businesses were shocked. 
In order to ship a tonne of condensed milk out of the oblast, 
it was necessary to go all over to get permission from 
Polezhayev's deputy. The trading house, naturally, had no 
problems. There was a scandal. There followed a presidential 
edict, under which Polezhayev was to have stood down as 
president of the commercial structure. A deputies' commission 
which exposed cases of the most basic kind of speculation in 
state goods was silenced. 
  Last year the oblast inner soviet, on the initiative of 
Governor L. Polezhayev, decided to end payments to the federal 
budget. The next morning Mayor Shoykhet issued a radio 
statement to Omsk people to the effect that Polezhayev and the 
soviet were destroying Russia economically. On the basis of an 
appeal by the oblast prosecutor, who had ruled the soviet 
decision illegal, Shoykhet announced that the city would be 
meticulous about paying its taxes. 
  A September-October session of the oblast administration 
collegium decided to support the president. Shoykhet asked 
bluntly whether that meant Rutskoy, who had taken the oath, or 
Yeltsin. They took a vote -- Yeltsin won by a margin of two. 
But in the Omsk newspapers the next day Yeltsin's name had been 
dropped from the oblast administration decision. And that is 
Polezhayev all over as a politician. 
  The story of the mayor of Omsk's dismissal brings to mind 
some sad thoughts. The legal mechanisms for instituting 
proceedings or removing someone from his job are not working, 
but intrigues and telephone law are increasingly gaining ground.

<F P=106> [Boris Sherman report under "The Kremlin" rubric: </F>
"Authorities Tired of Truce. President Tired of Standstill"] 
  [Text] The peaceful or, at any rate, tacitly indifferent 
coexistence of Boris Yeltsin's administration and the newly 
elected chambers of Russia's Federal Assembly must have appeared 
to the republic's president unconscionably drawn-out as early as 
five weeks after the day of the December elections. Having 
signed on 24 January his Appeal to Members of the Federation 
Council and Deputies of the State Duma, he seems to be 
demonstrating a firm intention to end the situation of mutual 
neutrality and noninterference that he finds unusual and clearly 
unpleasant. 
  The document that is being circulated on an ever wider scale 
on Bolshaya Dmitrovka and Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya 
[respectively, seats of the Federation Council and the Duma] 
these days speaks in form only about a purely procedural 
problem: the president reminds the deputies that in setting the 
50-percent quorum necessary for the chambers to approve their 
temporary rules of procedure, they proceeded from the number of 
seats that were actually distributed in the 12 December 
elections -- six seats in the Duma and seven in the Federation 
Council, while they did not consider at all the seats remaining 
vacant. Such a violation gives Boris Yeltsin occasion to 
express "extreme anxiety" over the fact that, already in the 
first days of their work, parliamentarians "violated the most 
important provisions of the Constitution," and that "real 
prerequisites have been created for the making, in the future by 
either of the chambers, decisions not only on rules of procedure 
but also on federal laws and other decisions" contrary to the 
requirements of the Fundamental Law. "The Russian Federation 
Constitution does not provide for the presence of chambers of 
the Federal Assembly consisting of 171 and 444 deputies, hence 
the decisions of such chambers cannot be recognized as 
constitutional," the president remarks in an easily 
distinguishable metallic voice. 
  In the meantime, the method for determining the quorum 
causes 
extremely tense debates already in the first hours that the Duma 
and the Federation Council were in session. Going back to what 
seems to be a closed-door session threatens them with a 
tremendous scandal. Accepting the president's claims would 
amount in the case of the State Duma, in particular, no more and 
no less than cancellation of the results of the voting for its 
chairman: Ivan Rybkin won the race for the position of speaker 
by one single vote, gathering a false quorum, as Yeltsin sees it. 
  One should hardly see in the president's demarche the desire 
to dismiss the agro-communist, who so far is acting quite 
modestly and circumspectly. Mr. Yeltsin must have set a much 
bigger task: to remind the deputies that they all still walk 
under the president, as well as to demonstrate that this 
president sits up high and sees far afield. 
  As a matter of fact, the standoff indicated by the Kremlin's 
resolute action will inevitably call for an arbiter. In the 
given case, it may only happen to be the Russian Federation 
Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court now proves to 
have regained its ambitious hopes and wishes just in time. A 
worthy cause is all that was lacking to go back to the line of 
fire. Well, here it is.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pelts report and KRASNAYA ZVEZDA note under the </F>
general heading "Federal Assembly Upper Chamber Committees Start 
Work"] 
  [Text] The Federation Council spent its morning session 
yesterday in various committees. During these sessions, the 
final composition of these committees was determined, and there 
were also discussions about the paramount questions which the 
upper chamber's deputies will soon be addressing. A chairman of 
the Committee for Security and Defense Questions was also 
elected. This was Petr Shirshov. 
  Compared to some of the other committees, this one is not 
particularly large. It comprises only 18 people, one of whom is 
a woman. The committee members represent practically all of 
Russia's regions, including the eight Far Eastern regions. It 
is to be noted that the committee's deputy chairman is a seaman, 
Captain First Rank Petr Premyak, who is also chairman of 
Kamchatka Supreme Soviet of People's Deputies. The committee 
also comprises many former and "active" servicemen. For 
example, readers are quite familiar with Committee Member Ruslan 
Aushev who basically needs no introduction. Other committee 
members are just as well known -- Maritime Kray Administration 
Head Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, and also defense industry lobbyist 
Petr Romanov who ran for the post of deputy chairman of the 
upper chamber. 
  They will be expected to tackle a considerable work load. 
They know about the decision by Army General Pavel Grachev, 
Russian Federation minister of defense, to establish a special 
group to cooperate with the upper chamber committee, including 
cooperation on security and defense issues. It will comprise 
four people. 
  Following discussion of the main spheres of its activity, 
the 
committee leaders proceeded to allocate the responsibilities and 
work organization of the apparatus. 
  From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA file: Committee Chairman Petr 
Petrovich Shirshov is a major general of the reserve. He was 
born in 1945. He is a Russian. He graduated from Orenburg 
Higher Surface-to-Air Missile Command School. He has served in 
the Air Defense Forces. He has performed military service in 12 
locations. His most recent posting is the city of Bryansk.

  [Text] The Federation Council Committee for Security and 
Defense Questions has begun work. Yesterday there was a meeting 
with representatives of the Defense Ministry, and a special 
group was formed for dealings with the Federation Council 
Committee. Your ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this by Petr 
Shirshov, chairman of the Committee for Security and Defense 
Questions. 
  In its work the committee intends to "cooperate with the 
corresponding committees of the State Duma and also to expand 
contacts with the corresponding committees of the CIS 
countries." Petr Premyak, deputy chairman of the Committee for 
Security and Defense Questions, believes that the committee 
especially needs to cooperate with the corresponding committees 
in the Ukrainian parliament and in the parliaments of the Baltic 
states. 
  In Petr Shirshov's opinion, the committee will be guided in 
its activity by the Russian Federation Constitution, will also 
monitor the execution of the laws, and where necessary will 
prepare proposals and submit them in the form of legislative 
initiatives.

  [Text] Moscow February 2 TASS -- The Federation Council 
adopted today on the whole the procedural rules of the upper 
chamber, which consist of 13 chapters, as well as a resolution 
on the procedural rules of the first Federation Council. The 
legislators discussed amendments to two out of the three parts 
of the rules, which deal with general procedural regulations of 
holding sessions of the upper chamber, as well as the procedure 
of the discussion of laws adopted by the State Duma. 
  The Editing Commission will submit its remarks concerning 
the 
third part of the procedural rules before March 1. This part 
deals with the discussion of issues, which, in accordance with 
Article 102 of the Constitution, are within the authority of the 
federation Council. These include the approval of the changing 
of borders between subjects of the Russian federation, of 
presidential decrees on imposing martial law, the taking of a 
decision on whether or not Russian troops should be used outside 
the Russian territory, the naming of the date of presidential 
elections, the impeachment of the president and so on. 
  Members of the Federation Council assigned the Committee for 
the Affairs of the Federation, the Federal Treaty and Regional 
Policy to take part in the forthcoming talks in Moscow between 
Russian and Tatarstan on concluding a federal treaty. They 
decided as well to assign the committee to analyse the problem

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 22 for 2 </F>
February 1994; by Andrey Pershin, Andrey Petrovskiy, and 
Vladimir Shishlin, edited by Boris Grishchenko] 
  [Text] President Yeltsin has called on deputies of the 
Federal Assembly to bring the temporary rules of the Federation 
Council and the State Duma in line with the Russian 
Constitution. In compliance with the Constitution, the houses 
of the Federal Assembly pass decisions by a majority vote from 
the total number of members of the Federation Council and 
deputies to the State Duma correspondingly in all cases except 
where the Constitution says otherwise, reads the president's 
address spread on Tuesday in the Russian parliament. 
  When the houses passed the temporary rules, the notion "the 
total number of deputies" was interpreted as the number of 
effectively elected of each of the houses. In line with the 
Constitution, the total number of deputies in the Duma is 450 
and in the Federation Council-- 178, while elected were 444 and 
171 respectively. 
  The interpretation of the notion "total number of deputies" 
as the number of the elected deputies suggests the recognition 
that the houses consist of a different number of deputies than 
that envisaged by the Russian Constitution. Thus the decisions 
of the houses cannot be considered constitutional, believes the 
Russian president. It follows that when the houses adopted their 
provisional rules, deputies violated provisions of Articles 95, 
102 and 103 of the Russian Constitution, said Yeltsin. 
  The presidential message says that the loose interpretation 
of the constitutional norms enables both houses of the Federal 
Assembly in the future to adopt laws and other decisions 
contrary to the requirements of the Russian Constitution. 
  IF Note: In connection with the president's message, 
parliamentary observers note that the speaker of the State Duma 
Ivan Rybkin had received 223 votes in his favor to become 
speaker. This means he was elected by a one vote majority out 
of the number of the elected deputies. The points made by 
Yeltsin virtually call into question the fact that Rybkin was 
elected constitutionally, which, some experts believe, could 
lead to a deterioration in the relationships between the 
president and the Duma. 
  Meanwhile, at the Federation Council session Wednesday, 
deputies turned down the presidential amendments which proposed 
to count votes out of the total number of the Federation Council 
members, not from among those elected. If passed, such a 
decision would have meant the relieving of the chairman of the 
Federation Council and his deputies and the election of members 
of Federation Council committees.
