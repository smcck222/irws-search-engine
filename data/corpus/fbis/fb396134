  [Text] Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze has sent 
an appeal to the Russia's President Boris Yeltsin. The appeal 
says in particular: 
  We have chosen a peaceful way of settling the conflict in 
Abkhazia. The hallmark of the Abkhazian separatists is easily 
recognized in the tragedy which has unfolded recently. They are 
continuing their practice of ethnic cleansing and terror against 
civilians. All this shows that the Abkhazian side is not 
interested in establishing, since the latest tragedy which 
unfolded in Gali rayon coincided with the timing of the return 
of displaced people to Abkhazia, as envisaged by the Geneva 
talks. 
  The only solution is to speed up a UN-sanctioned deployment 
of peace-keeping forces in Abkhazia and to establish strict 
international supervision. 
  The start of the normalization of relations between Russia 
and Georgia, which by itself is the foundation for the 
establishment of peace in the Transcaucasus, has evoked a wide 
response from beyond the borders of our countries. 
  I appeal to the leadership of Russia, on whose mediation and 
peacemaking role largely depends the future of peace in Georgia, 
in particular Abkhazia, to take all measures for a peaceful 
settlement of the conflict and a (?dignified) return of the 
refugees.

<F P=106> [Letter from Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze to UN </F>
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali; read by announcer] 
  [Text] To His Excellency UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  Esteemed Mr. Secretary General, I would like to greet you 
and 
convey to you my people's best wishes. 
  I had to write this letter because of a further 
deterioration 
of the situation in Abkhazia, which, as you know full well, was 
already extremely tense. The Abkhaz separatists have repudiated 
their obligations under the memorandum signed in Geneva on 1 
December 1993 and the communique adopted on 13 January 1994, and 
on 7 and 8 February of this year launched a new Fascist action. 
  An about 1,000-strong group with heavy equipment attacked 
Georgian villages in Gali Rayon, burned down up to 800 
residential houses, and staged the mass killing of civilians. 
Several thousand Georgians were uprooted from their permanent 
places of residence and joined the tens of thousands of 
displaced people and refugees. Mountain villages in Gali Rayon 
beyond the reach of the armed groups of separatists were shelled 
with heavy artillery. 
  The hallmark of Abkhaz separatists can be easily recognized 
in the latest disaster. Their common practice of ethnic 
cleansing and terror against civilians is continuing. All this 
shows that the Abkhaz side is not interested in the 
establishment of peace. 
  Let me remind you, Mr. Secretary General, that the 
large-scale punitive operation was carried out against the 
population of the rayon where, under the Geneva communique of 13 
January 1994, the first stage of the return of the displaced 
persons and refugees should have started on 10 February. Events 
of the last few days suggest that the stepping up of military 
operations by the Abkhaz separatists is aimed at wrecking the UN 
Security Council resolutions, the process of normalization in 
relations between Russia and Georgia, and the establishment of 
peace throughout the Caucasus region. 
  We have chosen a peaceful way of conflict settlement. An 
alternative to this way is military escalation and the 
resumption of hostilities, which will result in the spreading of 
the conflict zone, enormous casualties, and a great disaster -- 
not only for Georgia. 
  The only solution is to speed up the sanctioning by the 
United Nations of the deployment of peace-keeping forces in 
Abkhazia and to introduce strict international supervision. 
  I appeal once again to the United Nations Organization, the 
Security Council, all its members-states. I appeal to you to 
take a decision without delay on the deployment of a 
peacekeeping force and the immediate return of the refugees. 
  I appeal to the leadership of Russia, on whose mediation and 
peace mission to a large extent depends the future of peace in 
Georgia and, in particular, Abkhazia. Take all measures for a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict and a timely return of the 
refugees. 
  I hope that at this most difficult time for the Georgian 
people, the United Nations and its Security Council in 
particular will have a principled examination of this issue, 
which causes us so much pain, and will take a decision to send 
peacekeeping forces to the conflict area immediately. 
  In the event of the opposite, an escalation of the conflict 
can be expected not only in Abkhazia but also in the whole of 
Georgia, which may result in unforeseen tragic consequences 
throughout the Caucasus. 
  I would like to express my gratitude for your constant 
striving for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia 
and assure you of my best [word indistinct]. 
  Yours sincerely, 
  [Signed] Eduard Shevardnadze, Tbilisi. 
  [dated] (?9) February 1994.

  [Text] Georgian Leader Eduard Shevardnadze believes that 
there are signs of the beginning of economic restoration in the 
country. He said this at the enlarged meeting of the Georgian 
Cabinet of Ministers on Wednesday. 
  According to Shevardnadze, Georgia has overcome its 
political 
and economic isolation. Namely, it has recently signed a 
Russian-Georgian treaty and economic agreements. 
  On the way out of the crisis, the Georgian leader pointed 
out 
that the economic processes, including the transition to a 
market economy, must be controlled by the state. 
  Shevardnadze pointed out that this primarily meant control 
over wages and prices which must be in mutual conformity. 
Taking into consideration the sharp decrease in the Georgian 
national currency's (coupons) exchange rate he said that another 
currency might be introduced in the republic and be in parallel 
use with Georgian coupons. This currency could be rubles or 
dollars. However, Shevardnadze emphasized that the coupons must 
be made competitive to the foreign currency.

  [Text] Peter Hancock, ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary of Canada to Turkey and Georgia, today handed 
his credentials to head of the Georgian state Eduard 
Shevardnadze. 
  Prospects of future cooperation between Georgia and Canada 
were discussed at the meeting. The necessity for creating a 
legal basis for relations between the two countries was 
mentioned. 
  The head of state familiarized the ambassador with the 
results of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit. He noted 
that the day of the meeting was a historic one in the relations 
of the two neighborly countries and that it gave momentum to 
establishing new and kind relations between Russia and Georgia. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze thanked the Canadian Government for its 
support at international organizations for granting Georgia the 
status of a developing country.

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Pavshentsev: "In Georgia Not a Day Passes </F>
Without an Emergency"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- Russian President B. Yeltsin's recent 
visit to the republic remains the central theme which is being 
actively discussed both in the press and at an everyday level. 
And whereas the set of economic agreements has not inspired any 
particularly emotional assessments, the agreement designed to 
regulate the presence of the Russian military contingent on 
Georgian territory has not been spared that fate. It was that 
fact which predetermined Russia's decision to sign a full 25 
documents with the leadership of the one of the most unstable 
states in the Commonwealth. And this was the main theme of the 
head of the state's traditional radio interview. 
  "The presence of foreign troops on the country's territory 
is 
not a source of pleasure to anyone," E. Shevardnadze stated. 
"Georgia, which wants to create its own armed forces, has 
neither the corresponding base nor the armaments. The 
functioning of the internal troops and the police is being held 
up by this problem. We have been forced to agree to compromises 
in order to resolve these questions and obtain the corresponding 
aid from Russia." 
  There has been no reaction from the Georgian parliament yet. 
Parliamentarians preferred to leave the satisfaction of setting 
Shevardnadze another obstacle till later -- until the next 
session -- so as first to analyze the agreements which have been 
reached and then be better prepared for the general battle ahead. 
  Meanwhile, on 8 February the head of state signed an edict 
on 
the creation of working groups for the preparation of the state 
symbols of the Republic of Georgia and also for the drafting of 
an anti-crisis program and the main principles and predictable 
parameters of economic and social development for 1994-1995. 
  Yesterday Shevardnadze paid an urgent visit to Western 
Georgia where two passenger trains had collided near the village 
of Kharagauli 200 km from Tbilisi. According to preliminary 
information three people were killed.

  [Text] Russia's own television and radio journalists will, 
it seems, also have to unite, but for a different reason. They 
will have to join forces with their viewers in order to defend 
the broadcasting industry. We continue to receive reports from 
regions where programs from Moscow are no longer being received. 
ITAR-TASS has reported that 40 percent of listeners could no

  [Text] Krasnoyarsk, 10 February -- Immediately after the 
end of the "Ostankino" TV company's program, "Utro," Krasnoyarsk 
communications workers switched off the transmitters. Neither 
are Russian TV programs going out today in the town on the 
Yenisey. Only the local independent TV company "Afontovo," with 
its own transmitter, continues transmitting to Krasnoyarsk. 
  "We are not satisfied at the government's decision on a 
stage-by-stage repayment of debts," the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
was told by Aleksandr Molchanov, the head of Krasnsoyarsk Radio 
and TV transmitting station. "We have heard more declaratory 
statements not backed up by any specific deadlines. The debts 
to our station alone in the last three months amount to 1 
billion rubles, and it is not known when this money will arrive." 
  TV journalists reacted promptly to the communications 
workers' threat. Last night they put more than 10 million 
rubles in cash into the communications workers' coffers, and 
local programs will go on the air this evening.

  [Text] TV and radio programs from Moscow and Chita TV and 
Radio company went off the air throughout the entire territory 
of Chita Oblast early this morning. Vyacheslav Shirokiy, our 
correspondent, reports: 
  [Shirokiy] Chita communications workers have finally carried 
out their threat. Having found themselves practically isolated 
today they decided to stand firm till the end. The point is 
that Viktor Malakiyev, head of the local territorial radio 
broadcasting center, received a telegram from the Communications 
Ministry to the effect that as a result of talks, an accord was 
reached with the government on a stage-by-stage repayment of all 
the existing debts. 
  However, the Transbaykal communications workers could not be 
satisfied with this kind of response -- all too often in the 
recent past they received similar promises that usually remained 
nothing more than just so many hollow gestures. 
  Currently, and due to the fact that the TV and radio company 
has failed to pay its debts to the communications workers, they 
owe almost 1 billion rubles to the Transbaykal power engineering 
people alone and they, in turn, constantly threaten to pull the 
plugs at the main relay stations in Chita Oblast. 
  There have already been several instances of this kind, when 
the radio fell silent in the eastern Transbaykal area for more 
than 24 hours at a time. Today, too, almost 2 million 
Transbaykal people are left without up-to-date information about 
events taking place in the country. 
  In his short interview for Radio Rossii, Viktor Malakiyev, 
the head of the territorial Radio Broadcasting and 
Communications Center, noted that we all became hostages of the 
economic chaos caused by the government itself that prevaricated 
till the last moment with the financing for the country's TV and 
radio companies, and that never bothered to repay the existing 
debts in good time, end of quote. 
  Whatever the merits of this case are, people in Chita Oblast 
now understand that the present stoppage in TV and radio 
broadcasts being put out represents the first and a completely 
real step toward destroying the country's unified information 
space. One would like to believe that the government will, at 
long last, reach the same conclusion.

  [Summary] Omsk RV-49, one of the biggest radio stations 
beyond the Urals fell silent for the first time today. 
  Correspondent Mikhail Shakhnovich reports that the 
communication workers have one and the same reason -- acute 
financial crisis. The country's television and radio companies 
owe Omsk over 600 million rubles and, as a result, there is no 
money to pay for electricity, and employees of relaying centers 
have not received their wages since November. But the switches 
have been turned off not just at RV-49. A VHF station and 
television transmitters have stopped working on the oblast's 
territory. 
  Communications workers intend to strike until all their 
demands are met. A government telegram that arrived in Omsk 
this morning unfortunately does not give answers to any of their 
questions, including the main one, namely when the debt will be 
settled. To all appearances, the switches on transmitters are 
not going to be turned on very soon, although local television 
and radio channels are continuing work, because the Omsk 
communication workers have no complaints against the Irtysh 
television and radio company. They are not taking part in in 
the information blockade. Radio relay and cable links are 
working. All the oblast's radio transmitters relay the Moscow 
channel.

Petersburg TV, and Mayak, Yunost, and Radio Odin radio stations 
were also stopped. On all three TV channels Ivanovo people will 
only be able to view evening news bulletins. Local TV programs 
will be transmitted without change since the Ivanovo TV and 
radio company has no debt to the communications workers, our 
correspondent in that town, Oleg Alalykin, reports.

  [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- Central Television 
broadcasts have been cut off in Tver, Kostroma, and Belgorod. 
  Sergey Lomako, chief of the Tver radio and television 
broadcasting center, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent: "Like our 
colleagues in other Russian towns, we have also gone off the air 
because we are not fully satisfied with the government decision 
regarding our demands. To date, the television companies owe us 
310 million rubles. Primarily they are Ostankino and the Second 
Channel. We will be broadcasting Tver television programs 
because the local company settles payments with us properly. We 
await a clear decision from the government." 
  The communication workers of Kostroma warned of an imminent 
strike yesterday. Although the information on talks at the 
government brought some reassurance, broadcasts were cut. 
Communication workers refused to give any interviews, saying 
they were too busy. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the Belgorod radio 
and television broadcasting center that the relaying of 
television programs from Moscow had been halted because of 
arrears for the work of radio and television transmitters. The 
debt exceeds 200 million rubles.

  [Text] Yaroslavl, 10 Feb--The radio and television 
broadcasting center in Yaroslavl has joined the "broadcasting 
warning" action. 
  The morning news bulletins were broadcast, and then all 
central channels went off the air. Until the issue is settled, 
the oblast's Yaroslavia company and City Television, which have 
no debts, will be the only companies to broadcast without 
restrictions. 
  "The central and the Petersburg companies owe us more than 
200 million rubles, and this causes us problems in paying for 
electricity and spare parts". This is how Boris Belyayev, 
deputy head of the Yaroslavl Radio and Television Broadcasting 
Center commented on its participation in the action. He 
acknowledged that "this action is not the best measure to take, 
but it is a serious warning that attention must be paid to the 
critical situation in which communications workers are finding 
themselves."

  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has 
instructed the Finance Ministry to raise funds to help phase out 
the state TV companies' debt of 80 Bn rubles to the 
Communications Ministry. His decision came after an emergency 
meeting with Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak and 
Chairman of the Ostankino TV Company Aleksandr Yakovlev on 
Wednesday. 
  The meeting follows a threat by the communications workers 
trade unions to cut down TV broadcasts to morning and evening 
newscasts beginning Thursday unless the TV companies service 
their debt. 
  The prime minister expressed concern over the TV companies' 
arrears over 1993 and this year, his press office told Interfax. 
He instructed the Finance Ministry to start covering the debt 
by paying out wages to the communications workers, now several 
months overdue.

  [Text] Moscow February 10 TASS -- The Russian Government 
promised to pay debts to striking communication workers in the 
first quarter of 1994 and asked them to resume broadcasts of 
state-run TV companies which they cut off in various regions on 
Thursday demanding the 80-billion rouble debt back. 
  "Payment of debts to regional radio and TV centres for the 
fourth quarter of 1993 has begun today and will be carried out 
according to a schedule approved by the Finance Ministry", 
government spokesman Valentin Sergeyev said on Thursday quoting 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  He added that all the debts will be paid in the first three 
months of 1994. 
  According to the spokesman, the prime minister will meet the 
demand of leaders of the communication trade union who urged a 
meeting with him. 
  The prime minister "understands the complexity of the 
situation and requests the heads and work collectives of 
regional radio and TV relay centres to continue work", according 
to the spokesman. 
  On Wednesday the prime minister promised that the debt would 
be paid by stages, however, communication workers said they had 
heard enough of such declarations and urged a concrete decision 
on the matter. 
  In the meantime, communication workers in Azerbaijan decided 
to follow suit and threatened to cut off broadcasts from Russia 
if Moscow fails to its half a billion rouble debt for leasing TV 
relay stations in Azerbaijan.

  [Text] Limits on the amount of TV broadcasting imposed in 
over 30 areas of Russia on Thursday will be in force till the 
debts to communications facilities, which have reached about 80 
Bn rubles, are paid up. 
  Interfax learned this on Thursday from Anatoliy Nazeikin, 
the 
chairman of the Communications Workers' Trade Union. Nazeikin 
qualified Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's resolution on "paying 
these debts gradually" as "vague and indefinite". He described 
Wednesday's conference, urgently held by the premier with the 
Communications Minister, Vladimir Bulgak, and with the leader of 
the state-sponsored Ostankino television company, Aleksandr 
Yakovlev, as "intergovernmental talks". 
  Limits on the volume of telecasts were imposed with a view 
to 
saving electricity, the leader of the Communications Workers' 
Union pointed out. According to Nazeikin, this action will be 
ceased only after negotiations between government officials, the 
coordinating council of communications facilities' staffs and 
the central committee of their union, to be held to fix concrete 
dates for paying the debts and the sums allocated for these 
needs. 
  Earlier the chief of the radio communications, broadcasting 
and television department of Russia's Communications Ministry, 
Stanislav Glubokov, told Interfax that at noon on Thursday over 
30 cities in Russia reduced the amount of telecasts on the two 
state-sponsored channels to news programs alone. Cuts in the 
telecasts were imposed in St. Petersburg and its region, in 
Rostov, Volgograd, Krasnoyarsk. 
  In Moscow telecasts will continue as before, Glubokov noted.

  [Text] We have just received a letter from the central 
committee of the Communications Workers' Union, signed by Mr. 
Nazeykin. It says: 
  The mass media are distorting the facts regarding 
implementation of the demands by the work forces at 
communications enterprises serving in the Russian information 
sphere--namely, by saying that communication workers are 
demanding trillions of rubles and that the Union's central 
committee has allegedly agreed to the government's decision. 
  The central committee of the Communication Workers' Union 
has 
protested to [Oleg] Poptsov, chairman of the All-Russian 
Television and Radio Company, on this issue and has demanded 
live air time to explain the situation. Despite demands by work 
forces for talks with the government, the latter has not deemed 
it necessary to meet either the Union's central committee or the 
coordinating committee. Since they have no received no specific 
realistic decision from the government, the coordinating 
committee and the Union's central committee are insisting again 
on talks with the government.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb -- The Coordinating Committee of the 
communications industry enterprises insists on meeting Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and on adopting a specific decision 
to eliminate the industry's indebtedness, an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told by Anatoliy Nazeykin, the chairman of the 
Russian Federation Communication Workers' Trade Union. 
  He said that "measures taken yesterday were insufficient, 
because the government issued more than 10 written instructions 
to resolve the issue last year. Yet another written instruction 
will not resolve the problems that have become extremely 
exacerbated," he said, and noted that the coordinating committee 
expected the government's official response. If no solution is 
found, the industry's workers will continue their Russia-wide 
protest action, emphasized Anatoliy Nazeykin. 
  Currently numerous regional communications systems in the 
Far 
East, Siberia, central non-black soil zone, and a number of 
other regions are taking part in the protest action. According 
to the Communications Ministry, approximately 40 percent of 
Russian radio communications facilities were taking part in the 
protest action as of midday 10 February. 
  At an emergency meeting on Wednesday with Russian Federation 
Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak and Aleksandr Yakovlev, 
head of the national Ostankino Russian state TV and radio 
company, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin instructed 
the Finance Ministry "to find an opportunity of a stage-by-stage 
repayment of the 80 trillion rubles debt that the state TV and 
radio companies owe to the communications enterprises." This 
measure was taken in response to a threat from the Russian 
Federation Communications Workers Trade Union addressed to the 
government and the TV companies that from 10 February onward 
"only the news bulletins from Ostankino and the national state 
TV and radio company would be put out in the morning and 
evening" until the debts to the communications enterprises were 
settled in full.

  [Text] [Announcer Tatyana Khudobina] Today, probably for 
the first time, we go on the air without knowing who is able to 
watch our program. Transmission of TV programs ceased in 
Krasnoyarsk, Barnaul, Khabarovsk, Krasnodar, Irkutsk, St. 
Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Penza, Tver, Kostroma, and 
Belgorod after the morning news from Moscow. Islanders on 
Sakhalin and the Kurils have also been cut off from Russia's 
information network. No doubt the list will have increased by 
the end of the day. Valeriy Belyayev, the managing director of 
the Sakhalin TV and Radio Company, says the artificial creation 
of an information vacuum could have serious political 
consequences, when viewed against the background of the oblast 
Duma election campaign underway on the islands. 
  The strike has gone ahead despite the urgent meeting held 
yesterday evening with Russian Federation Communications 
Minister Vladimir Bulgak and Aleksandr Yakovlev, the head of the 
VGTRK [All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting 
Company] and Ostankino, during which Viktor Chernomyrdin, the 
chairman of the Russian Government, instructed the Finance 
Ministry to find funds for stage-by-stage repayment of the 
80-billion debts owed by the state TV and radio companies to 
transmission enterprises. In spite of this, the 
telecommunications workers have acted on their threats. 
  Can one really restore order in a country where the prime 
minister's word means nothing, and the roost is ruled by the 
person whose finger is closest to the off button? I feel that 
this subject will provide serious food for thought throughout 
the day. Meanwhile, we continue "Vesti" for those viewers who 
can still see and hear us.

  [Text] Oleg Poptsov, chairman of the All-Russian Television 
and Radio Company [VGTRK], informed us overnight by telephone 
that the meeting between the heads of VGTRK departments and 
First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets ended late yesterday 
evening. The meeting addressed, among other things, ways to 
combine commercial and state television services. No specific 
decisions have yet been made. At the same time, Poptsov told 
the meeting that Russia's Finance Ministry was demonstrating 
what he called "total hostility" toward state television. The 
VGTRK chairman said the Finance Ministry seemed to think that 
state television lives on a different planet, while the Ministry 
of Finance is the main planet--where policy is decided by Yuriy 
Dubinin. 
  At roughly the same time, it was learned that Viktor 
Chernomyrdin had instructed the Finance Ministry to draw up a 
range of measures to ensure that the state television companies' 
80 billion [rubles] in debts to the Communications Ministry are 
paid off in stages. At 0600 Moscow time, however, we received 
an ITAR-TASS report that Krasnoyarsk telecommunications 
personnel had switched off the transmitters immediately after 
Ostankino's "Utro" program. Russian television programs are not 
being broadcast in Krasnoyarsk either.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 9 February carries a documentary 
presented by Sergey Dorenko giving the background on the current 
dispute between the government and communications workers in 
Russia. Dorenko says that the communications sector does not 
get money directly from the government but from the television 
companies it services, but bills have not been paid since 
December 1992. 
  He says that Moscow is not suffering the consequences of the 
cash crisis in the communications sector as much as other 
regions of Russia. But as a result of satellites deteriorating 
from orbit, television broadcasts to the Far East are likely to 
stop this spring. Satellites servicing western Siberia and the 
Urals will go down a bit later, he says. 
  In addition, the state broadcasting sector is not getting 
the 
state funds it needs. "At the moment the government refuses to 
allow state channels to become share-holding companies, but it 
does not finance them itself," he says. 
  Dorenko then talks about corruption in the various editorial 
departments of state television when advertizing airtime is 
being sold. Many ad agencies resell air time bought cheaply at 
a profit, and the editorial departments compete with them. 
  There is no shortage of independent companies ready to help 
state broadcasting out of its cash crisis, Dorenko adds, using 
Ostankino's Channel 1 as an example, where this is already 
happening. 
  Next, Irena Lesnevskaya, president of REN TV [a private 
company that began broadcasting via Ostankino in 1992], is 
interviewed. She says: "Any talk about state television is mere 
bluff, because 78 percent of programs on Channel 1 are made by 
independent television companies, and each of Ostankino's 
state-funded studios has its own financial structure." She 
continues: "Today, they cannot make one program on state 
financing."

  [Text] "It looks as if the fate of the media does not 
interest anyone in Russia's leadership," Anatoliy Nazeykin, the 
chairman of the Communication Workers Union, declared in an 
exclusive interview with Interfax on Wednesday. 
  In his words, such an attitude is born out by the 
government's total neglect for the telecommunications industry. 
By the end of last year the state-run TV and radio companies 
owed 67.5 Bn rubles to the telecommunications staff, and since 
then the figure has risen to 80 Bn rubles. As a result of the 
chronic debts, as Nazeykin reported, more than 50,000 
telecommunications workers have been underpaid for up to 4 
months and are now working for free. 
  These facts and proposals on how to offset the debts make up 
the package of documents addressed to the government by 
participants in a conference of telecommunications workers on 
January 21. There has been no response to the package, nor has 
there been any reaction to the telecommunications staff's 
warning that programs from Ostankino and other TV centers will 
be significantly cut.

  [Text] [Announcer] Here are some reactions about the 
situation. Oleg Poptsov, the chairman of the All-Russian 
Television and Radio Company: 
  [Begin Poptsov recording] I believe that this action cannot 
be seen as antistate or without logic. It is an apolitical 
action. When [Finance Minister] Dubinin says that someone 
should take political action but that he has nothing to do with 
it, I have to say that such a strange stance by the Finance 
Ministry of a state called Russia begins to puzzle me somewhat. 
We have to insure one thing, namely that when those people 
sitting in high office give their word, they use their 
professionalism, their authority, and their responsibility to 
keep that word. If you cannot give the money, give the freedom 
instead, but once you have given the freedom do not complain and 
do not claim to be governing the state. In other words, having 
renounced your obligations to finance television and radio, you 
have to renounce your right to govern both of them. Then other 
forces will govern them -- not the government and not the 
president. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Igor Golembiovskiy, the editor in chief of the 
IZVESTIYA newspaper. 
  [Begin Golembiovskiy recording] The danger has arisen of a 
situation in which Russia television and radio could fall 
silent. In our paper we have called this situation a national 
disgrace. It is a simply ludicrous situation. Both the 
television and radio, at any rate those channels in question, 
are state ones. Thus the state bears full responsibility for 
their work. I do not think there is a country anywhere in the 
world that would deliberately take the path of severing all 
links with society, and this fact is evidence of the collapse of 
our government and the state. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Nikolay Sergeyev report: "Situation in PRAVDA. Chief </F>
Editors Talk in Different Languages"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, representatives of some PRAVDA 
executives proposed to the State Duma that a draft law 
forbidding foreign control over the Russian mass media be 
introduced. It is to be recalled that on 4 February, members of 
the editorial office held a meeting of the work collective where 
Viktor Linnik was removed from the position of chief editor and 
Aleksandr Ilin appointed instead. Mr. Linnik and Mr. Ilin told 
your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the split in the 
collective had happened over the difference of opinion on 
whether to continue cooperation with the PRAVDA publisher -- the 
Greek Stilayt Holdings Ltd [as transliterated]. As the former 
chief editor put it, a "Greek coup" had happened in the 
newspaper. Aleksandr Ilin for his part stated that "he and Mr. 
Linnik are like two heads talking in different languages." 
  Viktor Linnik told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that 
in April 1992, when the newspaper PRAVDA experienced serious 
financial difficulties, its chiefs started looking for sponsors. 
It was then that the Greek company Stilayt Holdings Ltd offered 
its services as the newspaper's publisher. As a result, a joint 
venture "PRAVDA International" was set up in which the 
controlling block of shares (55 percent) belonged to the Greek 
side, and the rest belonged to PRAVDA work collective. Mr. 
Linnik points out that "It has already been 16 months since the 
joint venture was created but newspaper employees have not yet 
received their shares." According to Mr. Linnik, the newspaper 
kept appearing after the joint venture had been formed despite 
all the difficulties and small salaries (16,000 to 20,000 
rubles). Relationships between PRAVDA chiefs and the Greek side 
were "tolerable" all that time. But only until the point where 
the Greek side demanded its inclusion among the publication's 
founders. 
  Viktor Linnik stated: "I was against letting the Greeks have 
the newspaper." In his opinion, the Greek partners want to own 
the newspaper in order to get a big credit against it. 
According to Mr. Linnik, the Greek side had provoked a meeting 
of the work collective on 4 February where a decision was made 
on dismissing the chief editor. Mr. Linnik described the voting 
and the meeting itself as illegal because only 90 out of the 216 
employees on the payroll voted to dismiss him. According to 
Viktor Linnik, he has information attesting that taking part in 
the voting were mainly employees of the Greek firm (bar women, 
cleaning women, and other service personnel). Mr. Linnik added 
that in his view, the meeting was illegal. He also stated that 
if the PRAVDA work collective themselves fail to resolve the 
conflict, he would go to court to resolve the dispute. Mr. 
Linnik noted that taking part in putting out the newspaper now 
are the part of the collective who had supported the appointment 
of Mr. Ilin to the position of chief editor right from the start 
of the conflict. Interestingly, members of the current 
editorial board do not wish this announced in the newspaper. 
  Aleksandr Ilin, today's chief editor of PRAVDA, pointed out 
in an interview to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the 
Greek company had been the only one that helped the newspaper in 
its hard times. In his view, now "it would be unethical to 
break off relations with the Greek friends." Mr. Ilin said that 
Viktor Linnik had long been looking for Russian partners but 
that not all his efforts had been crowned with success. He 
stressed that subscribers who had paid their money do not care 
about whom the publication cooperates with, and the collective 
has no right to deny them the newspaper over their own internal 
conflicts. To your KOMMERSANT- DAILY correspondent's question 
on whether the Greek partners were going to become founders of 
the newspaper, Mr. Ilin categorically declared that this "was 
not, is not, and will not be the point." He also pointed out 
that PRAVDA's former and current chiefs made a mistake by airing 
their internal problems publicly. The chief editor said that 
despite their personal ambitions, the colleagues who "split off" 
continue to help put out the newspaper.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 10 TASS -- The ruling of the 
Frunzenskiy People's Court to sequestrate all property of the 
PRAVDA newspaper came as an absolute surprise for its staff 
members. 
  The argument over the property between the joint-stock 
company PRAVDA International Steelight Holdings Limited and the 
PRAVDA staff members looks like a detective story. On April 23, 
1991, Gennadiy Seleznev, then PRAVDA editor-in-chief, signed an 
agreement with the Cyprus firm Steelight Holdings Limited, under 
which all rights to the publication of the newspaper were passed 
over to the joint-stock company, in which the Cyprus firm has 
the controlling block of stocks (55 per cent). According to 
PRAVDA workers, they learned about the terms of the deal some 
time later. 
  The board of the PRAVDA journalists' organisation regards 
the 
court ruling as illegal. PRAVDA staff members intend to defend 
their rights, using all legal means. Despite legal 
complications, they are going to continue the publication of the 
newspaper. Aside from it, they intend to bring a couter-charge, 
questioning the validity of the agreements signed by Seleznev 
and the Cyprus firm.

  [Text] Multilateral consultations will begin in Moscow on 
Thursday, under the chairmanship of Russia's Choice leader Yegor 
Gaydar, on the establishment of a new political organization -- 
"a union or party" -- a competent source told Interfax. He said 
that consultations would begin at 10:00 at the Institute of 
Economic Problems of the Transitional Period (5 Ogaryova Street) 
and will be attended by leading politicians, public and cultural 
figures, and representatives of trade unions and associations of 
entrepreneurs. 
  "The talks will concentrate on the establishment of a new 
political association involving politicians close to Russia's 
Choice and representatives of a wide range of non-political 
organizations, said the source. 
  The same problem will be discussed during closed emergency 
consultations at one of Moscow's suburban recreational 
facilities over the weekend, involving deputies of the Russia's 
Choice parliamentary faction.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 9 TASS -- A new party has emerged 
lately in the Russian political firmament. The national 
patriotic organisation called the movement for Russia's National 
Revival was set by the nationalistic front Pamyat, the centrist 
bloc of political parties and movements and the Conservative 
Union. 
  The presentation of the new party was held in Moscow on 
Wednesday in one of the rooms of the Federation of Peace and 
Accord decorated with a huge portrait of Russia's last Czar 
Nicholas the Second and a table with an icon and traditional 
Russian bread and salt in the middle. The ceremony was attended 
by several dozen Pamyat members clad in black uniform and a 
large number of foreign journalists. 
  The party's concept is based on the "holy unity of god, the 
czar and the nation." The statement of its organising committee 
read out by Pamyat leader Dmitry Vasilyev was written in old 
Russian and contained many provisions eulogising autocracy, the 
Orthodox Church and its traditional virtues, and blasphemed 
bolsheviks and communists. 
  A large portion of the statement was devoted to the economic 
programme of the party. "Our course is towards reviving the 
strong peasantry on the basis of state, collective and 
individual forms of land ownership by freeing fledgling land 
users from taxes and establishing a system of deductions and a 
tax-free and balanced economy," the statement read. 
  Speaking at a news conference after the presentation, 
Vasilyev said that the movement will not "take part in all these 
elections" because there is something unpleasant "in the fight 
for power." On the other hand, he stressed that it "will not 
quit political life." 
  Vladimir Voronin, leader of the centrist bloc who failed to 
pass registration in the 1991 presidential elections, said that 
he "remains a candidate for presidency." Vasilyev refused to 
comment on the movement's tactics. He added that he would not 
name his supporters in the upper echelons of power, fearing they 
may "come under attack." 
  He denounced Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the ultra 
nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, saying his 
emergence "is not incidental." It was carefully prepared by 
someone standing behind him. He described Zhirinovskiy's 
statements as a "dangerous political provocation," adding that 
he (Zhirinovskiy) "provokes revenge-seeking sentiments and 
discredits the idea of the Russian issue." 
  Vasilyev also spoke extremely critically about Aleksandr 
Sterligov, leader of the Russian national assembly. Vasilyev 
distanced himself from some of Sterligov's former associates, 
including Nazi Aleksey Barkashov and Communist Nikolay Lysenko. 
  Asked about the movement's place in Russia's political 
spectrum, Vasilyev replied that "there is no place for us there.

  [Text] Since the beginning of the year, Russian border 
guards have detained about 300 trespassers. 
  Colonel Aleksandr Manilov, the head of the information and 
analytical department of the Russian border troops' General 
Staff, announced that jointly with customs personnel Russian 
border guards had also detained about 80 units of firearms and 
400 kilograms of drugs. 
  The situation on the Tajik-Afghan borders is the most 
serious. Since the beginning of the year, more than 20 attempts 
have been made to cross this border. On 14 occasions border 
guards had clashes with bandit units during which 18 trespassers 
were killed. The border posts have been attacked 47 times, 
including 14 times from Afghan territory. The Russian border 
guards have not sustained any losses. 
  Manilov believes that armed provocations and attempts to 
cross the border will continue, most of all in the section 
controlled by the Pyanj detachment. 
  Speaking about the Japanese vessels' illegal fishing in the 
Russian territorial waters near the Kuril islands, Manilov said 
that border troops fully controlled the situation and would curb 
any violations according to the law on state borders.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 10 TASS--Thirty five million people 
crossed Russia's border last year, and 3,500 trespassers were 
arrested by frontier guards. The troops were engaged in 
fighting with armed gangs some 400 times on the Tajik-Afghan 
border and killed 700 of them. On that border section alone 
they confiscated five tonnes of narcotics, as well as other 
contraband to the sum of four billion roubles. Those figures 
were cited by Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, 
commander-in-chief of the Russian frontier guard troops, 
published today in the new weekly GRANITSA ROSSII (Russia's 
Border). Its first issue was brought out today. 
  The issue opens with an appeal by Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, who believes the newspaper should become an 
effective instrument of the implementation of Russia's border 
policy, of the military-patriotic education of frontier guard 
troops and the population in the interests of ensuring reliable 
protection of Russia's borders and its territorial integrity. 
  The weekly gives wide coverage to the Army service of 
Russian 
frontier guard troops at the borders of Russia and the new 
commonwealth and carries reports from the Pacific coast, the 
south Kurile islands and other regions, as well as from the 
Tajik-Afghan border where the situation has not changed much of 
late. The troops are continuing their routine studies and 
training sessions.

<F P=106> [Interview with S.N. Voronin, chief designer of nuclear </F>
charges and munitions of the Russian Federal Nuclear Center, by 
Aleksandr Nezhnyy, place and date not given: "The Bomb"] 
  [Text] In 1927 Soviet power sealed the Sarov monastery, 
renowned for the spiritual deeds of the venerable Serafim, once 
and for all. One year later an NKVD child labor colony was 
housed in the monastery buildings. In 1933 the colony was 
replaced by a camp where not only criminals but also Article 58 
victims served their time. In 1938 a small plant was built 
there which produced iron bedsteads, kitchen utensils, and 
skates, and it was from this latter product that the plant 
derived its nickname. During the war the "skate" plant 
manufactured howitzer shells and later produced Katyusha 
rockets. On 8 April 1946 a three-man commission arrived at 
Sarov: One member of that commission was Yu.B. Khariton, now a 
successful academician and three times a Hero. Within a year a 
special secrecy regime was introduced here and the city 
disappeared from the maps. 
  In present-day Arzamas-16 little remains of the Sarov 
Monastery. Only the bell tower and the guest buildings escaped 
destruction.... In addition to the municipal museum and the 
"Sarov Monastery" museum, founded by local history enthusiasts, 
the city also has a most unique museum of nuclear weapons. Here 
you can touch the first Soviet atomic bomb with your own hands, 
reel in horror at the appalling dimensions of the thermonuclear 
bomb, see fragments of once top-secret films on atomic and 
hydrogen bomb tests, and hear the stern but, at the same time, 
exultant voice of the announcer saying: "A blinding flash! The 
raging elements destroy all the test installations within a 
radius of 4 km." When describing the super-bomb tests a kindly 
woman says, not without a note of pride, that the explosion 
produced a shock wave of such force that it would have gone 
round the globe three times. There used to be a monastery here 
-- it became a vast workshop producing weapons of awesome force. 
That is one image of the 20th century. 
  [Nezhnyy] Stanislav Nikolayevich, a man in your post is 
something of an unknown quantity in a society like ours. So 
would you be so kind as to tell us a little about yourself. 
  [Voronin] With pleasure. I am 63 years old, I was born in 
Yaroslavl, and in 1942 my brother and I were left without a 
father, our mother without a husband. It was wartime. After 
secondary school in Yaroslavl I studied at the weapons 
department of the Leningrad shipbuilding institute, where I 
received my diploma in 1954, specializing in torpedoes. I came 
to Arzamas-16 right away in order to make the bomb. As you can 
see, I am still here. I got married here and our children were 
born here... I have met and worked with some very interesting 
people here and learned a lot from them. Let me mention two 
names: Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov and Yuliy Borisovich 
Khariton. Yuliy Borisovich is 90 years old but he is still 
working hard; you can find him at the institute on weekends and 
late in the evening. 
  [Nezhnyy] What does it mean to create a nuclear weapon? 
  [Voronin] First of all it is a very complex process. We are 
dealing with the very small segments of time in which the high 
precision mechanism of the charge and the munition operates, 
very high temperatures and very high pressures, which do not 
exist in practice in laboratory conditions. That is why 
experiments are very important for us.... 
  [Nezhnyy] Nuclear tests? 
  [Voronin] Yes. The magnitudes which we work in can only be 
calibrated by experiment. 
  [Nezhnyy] Otherwise, the result is failure? 
  [Voronin] We may not achieve the expected result. There 
were quite a few instances of that kind, and this makes us come 
back to the question of nuclear tests. Without them we cannot 
improve our weaponry. We can make minor improvements but there 
will be no major progress. 
  [Nezhnyy] You say that tests are necessary, but the 
overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of our planet would say 
if asked: To hell with you and all your explosions! Isn't that 
so? 
  [Voronin] Do not portray us as some kind of monsters burning 
with a desire to carry out one test after another, ad infintum. 
No! Nevertheless, since life has forced the country to equip 
itself with its own nuclear weapons and since we have had to 
constantly improve them, they must be under reliable control. 
Control is all the more necessary in the conditions of our 
industry today, with its severed production ties and changes of 
suppliers and materials. After all, the replacement of 
materials could influence the characteristics of our product. 
Meanwhile we give a guarantee for the whole sequence of 
operations, as it were. That is why we simply have to check the 
condition that the products are in, whether they are still in a 
high state of readiness and reliability, and so forth. 
Otherwise they could become a threat to their owners. It is 
not only our specialists who adhere to that view but the 
Americans, too. We believe that as long as nuclear weapons 
exist they must be tested. In limited quantities and with very 
rigorous conditions regarding ecological cleanliness and safety 
-- but they must be tested. There is no other way. 
  [Nezhnyy] So the aim is, on the one hand, to guarantee the 
reliability of the existing nuclear weapons arsenals and, on the 
other, to make progress in improving them. Is that why tests 
are necessary? 
  [Voronin] Yes. 
  [Nezhnyy] You have undoubtedly been present at nuclear 
tests? 
  [Voronin] I went to Novaya Zemlya virtually every year from 
1969 through 1989. Since 1963, as you know, testing has taken 
place exclusively underground. This costs more than testing in 
the atmosphere, of course, but it is ecologically cleaner and 
safer. They drill a well or, in mountainous locations, they cut 
a gallery, lower the charge into it... 
  [Nezhnyy] Deep down? 
  [Voronin] That depends on the yield. But as a rule it is 
usually deeper than 500 meters -- to prevent any discharges. 
  [Nezhnyy] How do you feel during all this? 
  [Voronin] Please do not think that I am saying this for 
effect, but you await an explosion with a tension which is 
really hard to describe. And then.... Then the ground begins 
to move under your feet -- and we are 10 km from the site of the 
explosion, sometimes closer. A roar begins. It is probably 
somewhat like an earthquake. 
  [Nezhnyy] Does your institute conduct tests here around 
Arzamas-16? 
  [Voronin] Yes. At sites a long way from the city. This is 
essential. Then you need a conventional explosive. We do not 
work with fissile materials here. 
  [Nezhnyy] So the talk that everything here in this district 
is contaminated with radiation is.... 
  [Voronin] Nonsense. We have a special service which 
monitors the air and the water. They are cleaner here than in 
Moscow. 
  [Nezhnyy] That is fine. But then what you call a new 
product is created here. How long does that take? 
  [Voronin] From conception to the completion of research work 
-- 5-8 years. The product contains the achievements of 
virtually all sectors of science and technology. Our institute 
is a multidisciplinary scientific center where all the spheres 
of physics, mechanics, mathematics, physical metallurgy, 
chemistry, and electronics are represented... It has one of the 
most powerful computer centers in the country. 
  [Nezhnyy] Is the quantity determined by the state order? 
  [Voronin] We have nothing to do with that. The client 
orders as much as he needs. For our part we monitor every 
product from beginning to end: manufacture, operation, 
dismantling, and recycling. 
  [Nezhnyy] What is the perfection that you are striving to 
achieve? Does it consist in increasing the destructive force of 
a nuclear weapon? Or is it something else? 
  [Voronin] We resolved different tasks at different periods. 
The main thing now is safety. The world has changed. Whereas 
previously we aimed for order and the strict observance of 
technological discipline, now, in my opinion, top priority has 
been given to freedom as it is commonly understood. Freedom as 
meaning total license. For example, how many people are there 
with weapons nowadays?! And if a bullet were by chance or 
design to hit our product -- what would be the consequences 
then?! Previously we did not give much thought to that, but now 
we take it seriously. But once again, security measures 
envisage fairly major changes to the design itself. And it must 
be tested. 
  [Nezhnyy] How do Russia's present nuclear weapons compare 
with those that the United States has? 
  [Voronin] I would answer that question this way: Until the 
early eighties our products were no worse and, in some respects, 
even better than theirs. But since then there has effectively 
been a moratorium every year. Just isolated explosions -- the 
last almost 5 years ago. However, the Americans paid no 
attention to our moratorium until recently, they carried out six 
to eight blasts a year and of course they got ahead of us. 
Specifically as regards safety. 
  [Nezhnyy] But as regards weapon effectiveness? 
  [Voronin] As regards effectiveness -- no. In that sense we 
are still as good as they are. But, as you know, we do not have 
the same work opportunities as they have. Unfortunately...the 
financing conditions are now such that it is very difficult to 
organize normal work. Understand me: It is the state alone 
which needs us. So it all comes down to the budget, without 
which we cannot survive. 
  [Nezhnyy] Pardon me for interrupting you, Stanislav 
Nikolayevich, but what about conversion? Can the nuclear center 
not use conversion to earn its own living and pay for science 
and production? 
  [Voronin] We are already carrying out research work in the 
interests of the national economy. Our technologies can be used 
successfully in the nuclear power industry, in medicine, 
particularly in eye surgery, and in the oil and gas extraction 
industry, where explosive devices produce a considerable 
increase in the yield of wells, for example. But, no matter 
what revenue the federal nuclear center earns from conversion 
projects, we will never earn enough that way to finance our main 
area of work. I repeat that without the budget we cannot 
survive. But the budget has been playing some fairly nasty 
tricks on us -- until recently at any rate. It is in the order 
of things to keep the nuclear center waiting two months for its 
pay. The average wage here is 80,000 rubles [R]. True, they 
are promising to raise it to R140,000 in the near future and to 
R160,000 for the average on the designer's pay scale. 
  [Nezhnyy] I am not even going to ask precisely how much a 
bomb designer and builder earns in the United States... 
Incidentally, have you ever been over there? 
  [Voronin] I recently visited their nuclear centers at 
Albuquerque and Los Alamos for the first time. The Americans 
had organized a symposium on safety questions. This includes 
the problems of waste products, the risk involved in shipment by 
different means of transport, and the means of testing storage 
containers for fissile materials and munitions. 
  [Nezhnyy] Stanislav Nikolayevich, you acquainted me with an 
"Appeal" signed by a group of scientists and specialists from 
the federal nuclear center and addressed to the citizens and 
governments of Ukraine, Russia, and other countries of the world 
in connection with the intolerable situation with nuclear 
weapons in Ukraine. (Our conversation with S.N. Voronin took 
place before the signing of the agreement between Russia, 
Ukraine, and the United States. Unfortunately recent reports 
from Kiev inspire alarm rather than confidence that the accords 
which have been reached will be fulfilled unconditionally -- 
A.N. note) How do you explain Ukraine's stance? 
  [Voronin] What we have here, in my opinion, are political 
aims, a desire to get something from the United States, and the 
fear that if Ukraine becomes a non-nuclear state it will lose 
its international prestige. It is hard for me to discuss all 
this because I am not a politician. But one thing is beyond 
doubt for me -- nationalistic feelings are clearly being 
inflamed. I went to Ukraine, to the missile division base at 
Pervomaysk, and there I read Ukrainian Army journals and books 
and, you know, I was simply appalled at the distorted way in 
which they portray Russia. The number one enemy -- nothing more 
or less than that! Everything is presented in such a way as to 
make it seem that Ukrainians fought Russians even before the 
christianization of Rus, that they have been fighting ever 
since, and that they will go on fighting in the future. 
  [Nezhnyy] The combination of an ideology like that with 
nuclear weapons is dangerous, is it not? 
  [Voronin] It is more loathsome than dangerous. After all, 
they cannot use their weapons. The danger -- and this is the 
reason for our "Appeal" -- is that they treat them in a barbaric 
way. It could end badly. What is more, they are making life 
difficult for us at the nuclear center. Because of the 
incorrect treatment of the weapons, processes are taking place 
in them which increase the level of danger when it comes to 
dismantling them. And we are the ones who have to dismantle 
them. The later these products reach us, the greater the number 
of problems that we encounter. That is the trouble. True, some 
people on the Ukrainian side do say: We will dismantle them 
ourselves. But they will not. They will cause trouble -- and 
that is all. 
  [Nezhnyy] What could happen in an extreme case, for example? 
  [Voronin] There could be an explosion. 
  [Nezhnyy] A nuclear explosion? 
  [Voronin] No, it would not be a nuclear explosion. It would 
be a conventional explosion, but the plutonium contained in the 
warhead would spread over a fairly large area. Furthermore, if 
all this happened at an arms dump the consequences would be a 
second Chernobyl. One explosion is enough to render a city like 
ours uninhabitable... 
  [Nezhnyy] Stanislav Nikolayevich, you are one of the 
creators of the weapon which, if used, and God forbid that, 
would take so many lives that it is horrible to even 
contemplate... 
  [Voronin] You want to ask me what my feelings are? 
  [Nezhnyy] Yes. 
  [Voronin] I always tell my colleagues: We make our weapons 
so as not to go to war with them. I do not think that 
intelligent people can ever use them. My whole life I have 
worked to ensure that this weapon makes it impossible even to 
contemplate the idea of beginning a war! In 1945 the Americans 
were able to drop "Little Boy" and "Fat Boy," but very soon even 
they had to think about the possibility of a retaliatory strike. 
Since then the task has been to preserve a balance of forces 
which makes it impossible to use nuclear weapons under any 
conditions. In this regard, admittedly, we and the United 
States overdid it and stockpiled vast nuclear arsenals. Now it 
is time to sort things out. Living alongside yields of this 
magnitude is inconceivable! Reduction is a noble cause. 
Nevertheless I do not think that the 20th century will see a 
final end to these weapons. Our children will still have to 
rack their brains to decide how to get rid of these weapons once 
and for all. 
  [Nezhnyy] Stanislav Nikolayevich, what is the average age of 
staff at the All-Russia Experimental Physics Scientific Research 
Institute? 
  [Voronin] Forty-two. 
  [Nezhnyy] Is that high? 
  [Voronin] Yes. But the average age of workers in science is 
46. That is really high. The problem is that now we have 
virtually no young specialists coming through to replace them. 
In the past our work had prestige, and here at Arzamas-16 the 
young specialist could enjoy a series of social benefits that 
were difficult to obtain back in European Russia, such as 
apartments, good medical services, recreation -- but now things 
are not only no better here than elsewhere, they are even worse. 
So no one comes out here to join us. 
  [Nezhnyy] Yet the Federal Nuclear Center is Russia's 
national asset. Does the government really not understand that, 
does the president not realize it? 
  [Voronin] Destroying a center is easy, creating one is 
incredibly difficult and nowadays I think that it is simply 
impossible. Just recently, it is true, things do seem to have 
happened. I told you that it takes us eight years to create a 
new product. That means that it needs a program. We proposed 
such programs long ago but they were ignored. Now interest has 
been shown in them, the government is creating the corresponding 
structures, and I am confident that in the end everything will 
work out right, these political games will end, and people will 
get down to work. 
  [Nezhnyy] Does the brain drain not worry you any more? 
  [Voronin] There are people who worked with us and who left 
for other republics of the CIS. They number just a few. No 
one, as far as I am aware, has yet gone further afield than 
that. In the main this brain drain is toward commercial 
structures, and these are good people who are leaving. 
Generally speaking if the economic situation gets worse the 
danger of the proliferation of nuclear technologies will 
increase. The state's duty and paramount obligation is to do 
everything it can to prevent this.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Podlipskiy report: "The Economy Ministry Has Found </F>
Points of Convergence With Academicians"] 
  [Text] Judging by the results of yesterday's session of the 
Economy Ministry Collegium, the scholars who have been actively 
developing alternative economic programs lately should not 
expect the government publicly to admit the erroneousness of the 
present economic policy. Rather, the scenario for the further 
course of events will essentially repeat the patterns of the 
cabinet's collaboration with "non-nomenklatura" economists: 
Some of their proposals will be incorporated into the 
government action plan while the alternative programs themselves 
are in for protracted discussions in parliamentary committees 
and at party caucuses, to be subsequently buried in oblivion. 
  This is a win-win scenario for the government. On one hand, 
the leading members of the cabinet stress that the reform 
program in effect since last August will not be canceled under 
any circumstances. On the other, it is admitted that to 
overcome the economic crisis it is necessary to go outside the 
framework of purely monetary methods of economic regulation. It 
is expected that the main directions in economic policy 
adjustments will be promulgated at an expanded government 
session on 17 February (the president's speech to the Federation 
Council scheduled for 18 February, however, can shift the date 
of this event somewhat). In this case the incorporation of some 
provisions from the alternative programs (at present there are 
three: a memorandum by a group of academicians led by Stanislav 
Shatalin; a program by Sergey Glazyev and Dmitriy Lvov; and the 
"heterodox" plan by Yevgeniy Saburov) will allow the government 
to avert possible accusations from its opponents of monopolist 
practices in working out an economic course. As for the fate of 
the "academic" reforms as a whole, speaking at yesterday's press 
conference, Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin stated that all 
of them will be considered at a State Duma session today, 
together with the forecast for Russia's sociopolitical 
development in 1994 prepared by his ministry and a report by the 
State Statistics Committee -- which could well become the 
beginning of a lengthy process of coordinating these programs, 
which differ substantially. Usually the search for such 
compromise formulas ends inconclusively. 
  Even so, as an Economy Ministry official said after the 
collegium session, any programs drawn up now have very little 
chance of being implemented -- regardless of their quality. 
This is primarily due to the fact that in today's Russia any 
prediction of socioeconomic development becomes outdated and 
unrealistic very soon. Furthermore, the experience of 
implementing such plans shows that they -- even judging by the 
number of corresponding government documents adopted -- are 
implemented by less than half. Thus, for instance, the August 
plan of government actions in the sphere of financial policy was 
fulfilled by 20 percent (out of the required 15 documents a mere 
three were adopted); in the sphere of institutional changes, out 
of 19 resolutions, five were approved; in structural policy, 
only one-third of the documents planned were signed. In 
addition to these, the ministry official singled out yet another 
fact: In spite of the reorganization of the government 
structure, it has proved impossible to overcome the "redundancy 
of decisionmaking channels" -- the majority of government 
members are busy "putting out fires" involved in the operation 
of particular branches and enterprises, which does not allow the 
government to attend to strategic planning. 

<H3>    Main directions of action by the Russian Federation 
Government in 1994 </H3>
  creation of a commission on economic reform under the 
government chairman; 
  rigid state regulation of monopoly activity, including 
control of prices for their output; 
  enhancing financial settlement discipline: all enterprises 
must submit information about all of their bank accounts; 
  elaboration of several models of government actions 
contingent on the actual situation; 
  elaboration of a system of limit indicators in the social 
sphere which must be exceeded; 
  implementation of institutional transformations aimed at 
promoting competition on the domestic market; 
  lifting export quotas on a number of goods beginning in the 
second half of the year.

  [Text] Moscow February 10 TASS--"I support a multistructure 
economy and claim that our country should have both large 
agricultural enterprises and small farms," Russian Central Bank 
Governor Viktor Gerashchenko said here on Thursday, addressing 
the Fifth Congress of Russian Farmers. 
  Speaking of banking activities last year, the governor 
admitted that the bank made substantial mistakes which 
aggravated the economic situation of both farmers and the 
agro-industrial complex as a whole. 
  "This year," he said, "a decision was taken to grant a delay 
up to the end of this year to agricultural producers from paying 
interest on issued credits." In Gerashchenko's opinion, this 
will defuse somewhat the difficult financial situation in the 
countryside.He supported congress delegates who favoured the 
establishment of peasants' banks in Russia and promised every 
kind of support on his part. 
  Former Russian Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar challenged a 
thesis, 
now in vogue, on the equality of all forms of farming in the 
countryside. Gaydar stressed that, taking into account unequal 
starting conditions in the first years of their operation, 
farmers cannot compete with big agricultural producers. 
  Mindful of this, the present government, he said, "should 
give farmers greater support", including that for establishing 
peasants banks. There is no need for new bright ideas, Gaydar 
continued, since Russia has already the agricultural bank's 
network. 
  It is only necessary to create adequate conditions and grant 
privileges at the initial stage in issuing both long-term and 
short- term credits for the countryside, he added. 
  In Gaydar's opinion, the present government should continue 
previous work to liberalise the export of Russian agricultural 
produce and to take additional moves to establish a land market.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 9 Feb -- Russian Economics Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin spoke out in support of pursuing a policy of 
state regulation in the economy in a rational manner. At a news 
conference that took place today he told journalists about the 
expanded session of the collegium of the Ministry of Economics, 
which has been held. At the collegium, new economic programs 
were presented that had been drawn up by creative collectives 
under the leadership of academician Stanislav Shatalin, Yevgeniy 
Saburov, director of the Center of Information and Social 
Technologies under the Russian Government, as well as the joint 
program of Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Committee for the 
State Duma's Economic Policy, and Dmitriy Lvov, corresponding 
member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Shatalin's program 
will moreover be presented to the deputies of the State Duma on 
10 February. 
  Shokhin thinks that the government should pursue a policy of 
state control over the prices of monopolists in some sectors of 
industry. According to the minister, such monopolists as the 
power generating engineers and the railmen have already started 
to have an effect on the economy as a whole by raising 
production tariffs. This is something that the government cannot 
properly reconcile itself to. Besides this, Shokhin spoke out 
in favor of reforms in society being socially oriented. In this 
connection, he noted, some kind of alarm indicators should be 
worked out that set the maximum admissible state of the economy 
and, in particular, of the social sphere, the bounds of which 
one should not overstep. Otherwise the government will lose its 
control over the economy, he stressed. 
  Shokhin criticized a number of provisions presented in the 
new economic programs. These were, for example, the striving to 
freeze the ruble exchange rate, as well as Shatalin's proposal 
that inflation should be lowered by freezing prices for three to 
five months. However, Shokhin upheld the proposal that it was 
necessary for the government to work out more stringent measures 
for the making of payments and computations with regard to 
producers. 
  Shokhin mentioned -- as one of the main results of today's 
discussion -- the mutual desire of all those taking part to form 
an authoritative commission that would collect the ideas of the 
government and society's economic elite. The economics minister 
thinks that quotas may be abolished in the second quarter. This 
is explained, he added, by the fact that Russian prices are 
already comparable with world prices in many cases. 
  Shatalin, who took part in the meeting, noted that people 
were by no means unanimous on all points at the collegium. 
Those taking part in the discussion, he noted, expressed 
various points of view on such issues as the pursuing of a 
social policy, a system of state price regulation, as well as a 
tax policy.

  [Text] Moscow February 9 TASS -- The Russian Government 
held a conference on problems of the oil industry on Wednesday 
evening. The conference, chaired by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, was attended by heads of ministries and 
departments and managers of largest oil enterprises of the 
country. 
  The conference was held behind closed doors, but according 
to 
information received by ITAR-TASS, representatives of the oil 
industry raised the problem of overdue payments to oil and gas 
enterprises, exorbitant taxes and inadequate price policies 
pursued by the state in the field of energy resources. 
  It was pointed out that 28 different kinds of taxes are 
currently levied on one tonne of oil, which makes up 77 per cent 
of its cost. Besides, new taxes are going to be levied by local 
authorities in 1994, which will render normal development of the 
industry impossible. 
  Participants coordinated a package of documents aimed at 
resolving these problems. The package is expected to include a 
decree of the Russian president and a number of resolutions 
adopted by the government which shall be finalized in a week's 
time. 
  Commenting on the results of the conference, Russian 
Minister 
for Fuel and Energy Yuriy Shafrannik said that participants 
adopted a decision to increase the share of free oil sales for 
oil enterprises. A concrete figure specifying the increased 
amount of free oil sales will be determined in the near future, 
Shafrannik said. He pointed out that in 1994, oil exports from 
Russia are expected to remain at the 1993 level.

  [Text] Moscow, 9 February -- "The Russian Government's 
course of reforming the agro-industrial complex remains 
unchanged." This was stated today by Russian Deputy Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha. He was addressing delegates at 
the fifth congress of the Private Farms and Agricultural 
Cooperatives Association [AKKOR]. 
  The deputy prime minister gave a positive assessment of the 
work in 1993 of the private farmers who have been "by their 
example showing the whole of the peasantry how it is necessary 
in very complex conditions to strive to achieve production 
efficiency. Unfortunately, as a whole there is still not enough 
of this efficiency." The deputy prime minister stated that the 
government is now earnestly engaged in untying the "tight 
knots." In particular he stated that "a government decision is 
being prepared that will define the relationship between the 
state and the agricultural producers in 1994." 
  On long-term problems, Aleksandr Zaveryukha suggested to 
those assembled that they become earnestly engaged in setting up 
peasant banks and organizing insurance companies that could help 
private farmers resolve questions of credit and compensation for 
losses arising from unforeseen circumstances. 
  The fifth congress of AKKOR is to continue its work on 10 
February.

<F P=106> [Interview with First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets conducted </F>
by Aleksandr Golyayev under the "In the Russian Federation 
Government" rubric; place and date not given: "Where Unpaid 
Debts End Up"] 
  [Text] Questions concerned with setting up investment 
funds in the fuel and energy complex and measures to regulate 
the system of tariffs for electricity and heating in 1994 were 
discussed at the latest session of the government commission on 
current issues. Prior to it First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets 
gave a briefing to Russian journalists. 
  [Soskovets] The main thing is to solve the problem of 
inflation. Credit will be allocated more strictly and we will 
have to get down to organizing production at the same time. 
What does that mean? The system of settlements must be 
adjusted, not in the sense that the budget be used to clear 
enterprises' reciprocal debts but in the sense of helping those 
who are linked by a common manufacturing process or 
production-sharing relationship to find a mutually acceptable 
method. Pricing policy must be improved. Prices for services, 
transport, and energy are going to grow, and the government's 
actions in that area must be understood by all. 
  [Golyayev] Oleg Nikolayevich, I have heard people say that 
the whole problem of the state's insolvency is down to 
enterprises and the debts owed by one plant to another or one 
sector -- subcontractors -- to another. The government, which 
is failing to draw up a program to regulate relations among 
enterprises, is guilty. 
  [Soskovets] The problem of nonpayments is a topical one, and 
here one thing is bound up with another: Enterprises don't have 
money and consequently the state's pocket is empty. 
Manufacturers are a prime source of finance for the exchequer. 
But what are they doing to ensure they get back what they are 
owed? Nonpayments have always existed, and I know from my own 
experience that whether an enterprise recovers the money it has 
earned depends to a large extent on its leader. If you just sit 
around and wait, you won't get a red cent. The money doesn't 
disappear, after all, it's there, someone who does not deem it 
necessary to return it unless he receives a demand has got it in 
his possesion. 
  Let's take the chain constituted by VAZ [the Volga 
Automobile 
Plant], the Lipetsk metallugical combine, Vorkutaugol, and the 
Lebedinskiy ore-dressing combine. One provides raw materials, 
another the power supply, a third the sheet metal, and the 
fourth the actual vehicles. They have reciprocal debts while 
the Zhiguli is the most popular, if one may put it that way, 
automobile on sale, but money does not move along the chain. 
That is to say, there are structures -- commercial or banking 
-- which find this advantageous. How will the government help 
here? Under market relations the government does not lay down 
the law, people have to be accustomed to be self-reliant. I 
asked the leaders of VAZ: What's the problem? You will 
understand, they answered: the structures of the stores are 
such... But who founded LogoVAZ? Make your demands there! 
  You have the same situation with petroleum: There is the 
well-refinery-gas station chain. The product is in great 
demand, but there's no money. And what's the government's got 
to do with this? Yes, it is a taxing, dreary chore prising 
money out of people, but it has to be done -- links must be 
forged, otherwise you go bankrupt. 
  [Golyayev] Has the "beefing" about nonpayments within 
sectors been exaggerated, are there people doing this 
deliberately? 
  [Soskovets] I'm not in doubt. There are many ways of 
"wearing down" a debtor -- the tax police, the tax inspectorate, 
and much else besides. You have to act rather than waiting to 
hear what the government will say on this score. While people 
are waiting for a piece of paper from above, there's no knowing 
where tens of trillions of rubles are fetching up. 
  Many examples of proper market relations could be cited 
where 
goods are delivered on time and paid for in full. We have 
people in this country who understand the market and know how to 
work and live not just in terms of the present. Unfortunately, 
the majority ask the state to provide, and if they receive 
nothing they curse the government for not having organized the 
system of reciprocal settlements and for consequently being the 
wrong kind of reformers.

  [Text] Moscow February 9 TASS -- The implementation of 
laws of the Russian Federation, of the Russian president's 
decrees and orders by executive authorities is verified by the 
Control Agency. The agency has summed up the results of its work 
for a year. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA publishes fragments from the 
report on Wednesday. 
  The economic reform is in the focus of the Control Agency's 
attention. It follows the implementation of the president's 
decree on urgent measures for land reform. Radical 
restructuring of agricultural production has been carried out as 
a result of implementing provisions of the decree. Measures to 
privatise considerable part of land used by collective and state 
farms have been implemented. As many as 23,798 economies, or 93 
per cent of their total number, have been reorganised and 
reregistered as of October 1, 1993. As many as 14,540 
joint-stock companies, peasant economies associations, 
partnerships and farming cooperatives have been formed on the 
basis of reregistered economies. 267 thousand peasant (farmer) 
economies having a total of 11.2 million hectares of land have 
also been set up. 
  At the same time surveys indicated that the pace of the land 
reform is not quite rapid in a number of regions. Sometimes new 
forms of farming economies are not backed by heads of local 
administrations. 
  There were delays about providing plots of land to citizens 
in the Altay and Krasnodar territories, Omsk and Vladimir 
regions. Executive authorities and heads of collective and state 
farms are to blame for this. Sometimes they even put oblstacles 
to the distribution of plots of land. Sanctions envisaged for 
law violations have not been appllied. 
  Gross violations of the land legislation were made during 
the 
privatisation of land. 
  The pace of the setting up of peasant economies in the 
country has slackened. As many as 47 thousand peasant economies 
were formed in the first quarter of 1993, 28,300 in the second 
quarter, 7,200 in the third quarter and only 3,400 in October 
and November. What is more, 15,700 peasant economies gave up 
their plots of land by late 1993. Farmers are not given the 
necessary material and technical support, are unsatisfactorily 
supplied with funds and other resources. Quite often they are 
given plots unsuitable for farming. As many as 117 peasant 
economies, or 6.2 per cent, were liquidated for this reason in 
the Ryazan region by early October in 1993. More than 500 
peasant economies, or 16 per cent, were liquidated in the 
Sverglovsk region. 
  Funds allocated by the state to aid farmer economies are 
quite often spent for other purposes. The enhancing of the 
efficiency of farmers is checked by delayed payment for the 
produced and marketed output. The state owes more than 800 
billion roubles to grain growers. 
  Efforts of officials of the control agency were also aimed 
at 
veryfying the implementation of the Russian president's decrees 
"On the Speedy Privatisation of State and Municipal 
Entreprises", "On Organisational measures To Transform State-Run 
Entreprises and Voluntary Associations of State Entreprises into 
Joint-Stock Companies", "On the Regulation of Lease and 
Privatisation of Property of Leased State and Municipal 
Entreprises". During checks special attention was given to 
enhancing the effectiveness of privatised facilities. 
  Checks indicated that committees for the management of the 
state property of territories and regions in many cases failed 
duly to organise privatisation of state property and 
veryfication of the procedure. Questions of turning 
entreprises into joint-stock companies are resolved with delay. 
State funds resulting from privatisation are sometimes used for 
other purposes. The Russian president's decree envisaging that 
the transformation of state-run entreprises and their voluntary 
associations into joint-stock companies be completed in 1992 has 
not been fullfield completely in all of the surveyed regions. 
According to the information of the Russian State Property 
Committee, out of the 4,859 entreprises that were to be turned 
into joint-stock companies, only 2,545 joint-stock companies, or 
just over half the expected number, were registered as of 
December 1, 1993.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] Reliable sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry 
have told Interfax that the Russian president's special envoy, 
deputy Russian Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, leaves 
Wednesday for Geneva to take part in the Thursday round of talks 
on settlement of the Bosnian crisis. 
  Under consideration in Geneva will be the Russian proposal 
on 
demilitarization of the area around Sarajevo and its transfer 
under UN authority for a transitional period, a senior diplomat 
has told Interfax. 
  He believes under present conditions the Russian initiative 
has a good chance of being approved by the conflicting Bosnian 
factions. In addition to the representatives of the warring 
sides, taking part in the talks will be co-chairmen of the 
international conference on settlement in the former Yugoslavia 
Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, as well as special envoys of 
the Russian and U.S. presidents, Vitaliy Churkin and Charles 
Redman. 
  The diplomat said that the Russian initiative opens the way 
for a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian crisis. "We believe 
that the proposal on air strikes to support UN forces in the 
former Yugoslavia is the worst of all possible options," he 
said. The implementation of the Russian initiative would solve 
the problem, said the diplomat. 
  He said that most European countries believe that there are 
enough UN Security Council resolutions to allow NATO air strikes 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina if the Secretary-General asks for them. 
Russia does not share such an approach because it believes the 
decision on air strikes should be taken by the UN Security 
Council, he said. 
  The diplomat said that the NATO countries would advance a 
sort of ultimatum to the conflicting sides. Judging by 
everything, he said, they will be demanded to stop shelling of 
Sarajevo, withdraw within seven days all heavy weaponry from the 
adjacent region, and hand it over under UN control. If the 
demands are not met, NATO planes will be ready to make air 
strikes on the violating party, he said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by analyst Eduard Sorokin; from the "News &amp; </F>
Views" program] 
  [Text] The NATO countries have warned that unless Bosnian 
Serbs move their hardware and tanks to at least 20 kms from 
Sarajevo, the allied aircraft will have to resort to air strikes 
on their positions. Our analyst Sorokin comments: 
  As for the world's reaction to the decision taken by the 
North Atlantic Alliance, some countries support it to a certain 
extent while others are against, for one Russia. Reports say 
that President Yeltsin has spoken on the phone with a number of 
Western politicians and told them that the planned measure was 
pointless. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has sent a letter to 
the United Nations warning against serious consequences for 
NATO's direct meddling into Bosnia's conflict. There are several 
reasons for Russia's position, which may be grouped in a certain 
way. 
  The first range of issues refers to the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is no evidence so far that it is the 
Serbs who are responsible for the tragedy that took place in 
Sarajevo last Saturday. Military experts find it difficult to 
locate the place from which the fatal mortar blow was made 
killing 68 people. As for the Serbs, they deny their 
involvement in the crime and argue that the tragic outcome runs 
counter to their interests. Such events could only play into 
the hands of their rivals, the Bosnian Muslims. Therefore, 
Moscow believes it is necessary to look into what happened 
first. And the Russian leadership also believes the military 
operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be stopped by their 
escalation, that is by resorting to NATO's air strikes. 
Moreover, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has warned any 
assault plane will be shot down and UN peacekeepers in former 
Yugoslavia are jeopardized, though NATO has said that in case 
they are attacked retaliatory strikes will follow immediately. 
But in this case Serbia may interfere and the scope of military 
operations will considerably expand. 
  On 28 June 1914, the heir to the Austrian throne Archduke 
Franz Ferdinand was killed in Sarajevo and that sparked off 
World War I. The tragedy in Sarajevo on 5 February 1994 could 
prompt a chain reaction, the tragic outcome of which is 
difficult to foresee. 
  Russia's negative attitude to the NATO ultimatum determines 
another set of questions which have a direct bearing on the 
internal situation in the country. One has to view the historic 
past in this particular case; as a rule it is closely linked 
with the present. With Russia it was a tradition to support the 
Serbs, the ethnic Slav people who are Orthodox Christians. 
  After they suffered a defeat at the battle of Kosovo in 
1389, 
the Serbs came under the rule of the Ottoman empire but they 
would not accept such a destiny. The Serb uprisings at the 
beginning of the past century caused wide sympathy among the 
Russians toward their Slav brothers. There were Russian 
volunteers among these Serbian rebels. With Russia's active 
support, Serbia became an autonomous principality in the year 
1833, attaining its full independence at the 1878 Berlin 
Congress. During the Balkan wars earlier this century, Russia 
took the Serbian side once again, and in World War II the Soviet 
Army liberated the Serbian territory from the German Fascists 
together with the Yugoslav People's Army. 
  It goes without saying that the Russian leadership takes 
into 
account all these historic facts and circumstances. It is also 
forced to account for the opinions of members of the State Duma, 
the lower house of the Russian Parliament, which is clearly 
dominated by the pro-Serbian majority. It is not Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy alone who counts in this case. He is trying to 
stake on the Serbs in his own political interests. A political 
settlement that will fully meet the Serbs' interests is actively 
sought not only by Russia's political elite but wide sections of 
the Russian public as well. 
  Generally speaking, Moscow is no less than others interested 
in halting the Bosnian tragedy that has already lasted for two 
years. But to attain this goal one needs to resort to different 
policies which will break the deadlock of the problems that are 
at issue. This is the standpoint Moscow shares. A force policy 
by the NATO alliance can hardly help resolve this issue.

<F P=106> [A. Aleksandrov article: "Thinking (dumayushchiy -- </F>
containing word "duma" in bold print) Ambassador. Is Lukin 
Wearing His Deputy's or His Ambassador's Hat Today?"] 
  [Text] The State Duma International Affairs Committee 
intends to send President Boris Yeltsin an interesting document. 
This is its approximate content: Having considered your 
inquiry about the recall of Vladimir Lukin from the post of 
Russian Federation Ambassador to Washington, we express our 
agreement with his recall. At the same time we must inform you 
that probably for technical reasons your inquiry failed to reach 
our committee. 
  Through this message the committee is reminding the 
president 
of his constitutional obligations or, to be more accurate, of 
his obligation to appoint and recall ambassadors only after 
consultations with the International Affairs Committees of both 
Federal Assembly chambers. But a strange situation has come 
about: Vladimir Lukin, elected a State Duma deputy and soon 
after chairman of a State Duma committee, has not yet been 
officially recalled from his previous position as ambassador and 
is consequently technically speaking serving in two roles. 
Whichever way you look at it, the Constitution is being 
contravened. Not at all because Lukin wants this but owing to 
the forgetfulness of the people in the presidential apparatus 
who should be making sure that the Constitution is being 
implemented -- especially in such minor and simple matters as an 
ambassador's recall. 
  This situation is, however, certainly not absolutely 
unimportant. There has not until now been a sufficiently clear 
idea in the committee of how to interpret the reference in the 
Constitution to "consultations." The enquiry sent to the 
Russian Foreign Ministry seeking clarification by 1 February 
remained unanswered several days after the deadline. 
  People within the committee think that there is no point in 
insisting on the American procedure for appointing ambassadors 
whereby the final say rests with the Senate. 
  In Lukin's view, notification should be given in writing, 
after which hearings should take place in which experts and, of 
course, the nominees themselves participate, then the committee 
should make a decision which is brought to the president's 
attention and automatically made public. If the committee 
supports a candidacy proposed by the president, there is no 
problem. If, on the other hand, there are objections and the 
president nevertheless insists on his choice, then, Lukin says, 
the ambassador will have to live with the knowledge that people 
throughout the world, as well as in the country where he is 
posted, will know that parliament rejected his candidacy. 
Incidentally, the "unwanted" ambassador is not to be envied in 
these circumstances. 
  The committee will have to try out this mechanism in 
practice 
in the very near future. Several key ambassadorial appointments 
are expected: Yuliy Vorontsov will replace Lukin in Washington, 
and current Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will replace 
Vorontsov at the United Nations. Lukin will finally have to be 
recalled....

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 09, BNS -- A fast integration of the 
Baltic states into NATO would be of advantage to the whole of 
Europe, Norwegian Defense Minister Jorgen Kosmo said today. 
  Kosmo made the remarks in his speech at the Viking Revue '94 
conference of NATO's North European group. 
  The mayor of Russia's St. Petersburg, Anatoliy Sobchak, in 
his response termed the position of the Norwegian minister as 
"very dangerous." 
  Sobchak in his address to the conference among other issues 
reasserted Russia's stance that the regions of Jaanilinn 
(Ivangorod) and Petseri were traditional Russian lands and that 
Estonia's claims for these areas were lacking any grounds. 
  He also said that "a rise of nationalism" was in evidence in 
many former republics of what was once the Soviet Union. 
  The Estonian delegation to the Viking Revue meeting 
comprises 
the commander-in-chief of the country's defense forces, General 
Aleksander Einseln, and deputy chancellor of the Defense 
Ministry, Tarmo Molder.

  [Text] The number four children's hospital in Minsk, which

drugs -- prostafilin -- that it received from her, but the 
celebrations were short-lived. It seems that the these 
antibiotics had passed their use-by date back in 1992. The 
doctors were afraid to give children medicine that was not 
absolutely fresh. They decided to "pass up" the gift from the

instead.

  [Text] Almaty February 9 TASS -- Delegations of the Russian 
and Kazakh Foreign Ministries which met for talks in Almaty on 
Wednesday [9 February] expressed a unanimous opinion about an 
entire range of problems they discussed. 
  In addition to agreements reached several hours ago by 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Kazakh President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev and proposals expressed in a personal 
message by Russian President Boris Yeltsin addressed to the 
Kazakh president, a decision was adopted to form three working 
groups from each side to search for ways of resolving the most 
tense problems in the relations between the two countries. 
  Under the patronage of the two foreign ministers the working 
groups shall, within a month or a month and a half, to prepare a 
package of agreements between Russia and Kazakhstan on the basis 
of earlier projects, pertaining to problems of citizenship, 
military cooperation and the joint use of the Baykonur 
cosmodrome to subsequently submit these agreements for approval 
to heads of state in order to give them a legal character. This 
is expected to take place during a forthcoming summit meeting 
scheduled to be held no later than at the end of March, 1994. 
  Simultaneously, Russian foreign minister and his Kazakh 
counterpart Tuleutay Suleymenov agreed to step up preparations 
for signing other draft documents expected to promote further 
cooperation between the two countries. The matter primarily 
concerns the signing of a consular convention and a protocol on 
regular consultations between Russian and Kazakh Foreign 
Ministries. Mutual understanding was reached on the organisation 
of a conference of heads of Caspian states on ways of resolving 
problems of the Caspian Sea.

  [Text] Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius claims 
that Lithuania and Ukraine are entering a very important stage 
of developing and extending bilateral relations. Bearing in 
mind the overall situation in our neighboring eastern countries, 
the development of relations with Ukraine is very important both 
in the political and the economic sense. 
  This was stated in today's radio broadcast by the prime 
minister. He noted that economic instability in Ukraine causes 
many difficulties in settling accounts between states and he 
devoted a great deal of attention to this problem during his 
meeting with President Leonid Kravchuk on Tuesday. 
  Slezevicius expects that an agreement between the central 
banks signed in Vilnius will help the settlement of accounts. 
The contribution by the central bank should be very important, 
he noted, although, according to him, the part played by the 
commercial banks is also increasing. As is known, after his 
dismissal last autumn as chairman of the Bank of Lithuania, 
Romualdas Visokavicius was accused, among other things, of 
inability to introduce order in the settlement of accounts with 
CIS countries.

  [Text] Sochi February 10 TASS--The Abkhazian leadership has 
agreed with the proposed deployment of peace-keeping forces 
along the border river of Inguri, but not in Abkhazia itself. 
  Abkhazian Prime-Minister Sokrat Dzhindzholia told ITAR-TASS 
on Thursday that "this is necessary to prevent new combat 
activities and stabilize the situation". 
  Commenting on the joint message sent by Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and head of the Georgian state Eduard Shevardnadze 
to the U.N. secretary-general, Dzhindzholia agreed that the 
U.N.-and Russia-brokered accords between Georgia and Abkhazia in 
Geneva indeed "mentioned the deployment of peace-keepers just 
along the border line but not on the territory of Abkhazia 
itself". 
  Yeltsin and Shevardnadze proposed that the Security Council 
discuss "the launching, by the United Nations or with its 
approval, of a peace-making operation, involving, if necessary, 
a Russian military contingent". 
  Dzhindzholia said it was inadmissible for peace-keepers to 
carry out police functions giving them the right to maintain 
public order and disarm the Abkhazian Army. 
  The prime minister rejected Georgian media reports, which 
claimed that the recent military operation staged by the 
Abkhazian forces in the Gali region was directed against the 
civilian population of Georgian villages. "The operation was 
aimed against groups of terrorists, not against civilians", he 
stressed. 
  "Every state has the right to maintain order on its 
territory 
using its own forces. That is exactly what we are doing", 
Dzhindzholia said.

  [Text] The Georgian parliament has appealed to the Russian 
Federal Assembly over the latest outbreak of the Georgian-Abkhaz 
conflict. 
  It has emerged that some Russian parliamentarians link the 
normalization of Georgian-Russian interstate relations to the 
settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. Owing to this, 
they, together with Abkhaz separatists, went as far as demanding 
that President Boris Yeltsin's offical visit to Tbilisi should 
have been canceled. The historic visit did go ahead and a 
package of interstate agreements was signed, which answers the 
(?vital strategic) interests of our peoples. 
  As if to avenge the frustration of their plans, Abkhaz 
separatists, actively supported by North Caucasian militants and 
other mercenaries from the Russian Federation, launched a new 
punitive action against the Georgian population still remaining 
in Gali rayon, in effect, completing the ethnic cleansing and 
genocide of the Georgians in Abkhazia. 
  All this is happening at a time when, according to the 
Geneva 
accords, a stage-by-stage return of the refugees and displaced 
persons to Abkhazia was due to start on 10 February, while on 8 
February, a Georgian delegation, as part of a joint group of 
experts, began talks in Moscow on Abkhazia's future status. 
  We call on you, says the appeal, to go deep in understanding 
the essence of the tragedy unfolding in Georgia, to assess in 
time the threat posed by aggressive separatism not only to our 
country but also to all multi-ethnic states, to take necessary 
measures, so that the Russian Federation can perform the 
function of guarantor and mediator in the peaceful settlement of 
the conflict, to ensure the inviolability of the state border 
between Russia and Georgia and prevent armed formations from 
crossing it from Russian territory into Georgia. 
  We also call on you to start an interparliamentary dialogue, 
since our supreme legislative bodies have the responsibility for 
choosing the right political course aimed at saving our peoples 
from the horrors of fratricidal war, destruction and chaos.

<F P=106> [Report by Rustam Arifdhzanov: "Threat to Black-Out </F>
Television on 10 February is Signal for Strikes Throughout 
Russia"] 
  [Text] The mass strikes that had been expected in March, 
with actions by workers employed in the oil and gas, coal, and 
part of the timber industry forming the traditional vanguard, 
could begin as early as 10 February. 
  But the communications workers are the first to go on the 
warpath against the reformed government. Feeling that in the 
absence of Gaydar and Fedorov you can get money out of the 
present government, at any rate having seen that the agrarian 
lobby, led by Aleksandr Zaveryukha is succeeding in doing so, 
the communications workers, who do not have such powerful 
support in high places, have decided on an unexpected, but 
pretty massive attack. 
  On 10 February we will not see any programs, aside from 
morning and evening news bulletins, on the "Ostankino" and 
Russian state television companies' channels. 
  The decision was made by the communications workers' trade 
union central committee. In all other respects the latest 
all-Russian strike is no different from previous strikes by 
workers in other sectors. They are putting forward economic 
demands, above all the payment of debts. The state television 
and radio companies, and, therefore, the state, owed the 
communications workers around 70 billion rubles [R] at the end 
of last year. Not that much compared with the debts to other 
sectors. At the end of last year the government directed the 
Finance Ministry to pay the debt. This was not done, so the 
debt continued to mount in January. 
  The doubling of electricity tariffs and the increase in 
other 
costs have already forced radio communications lines to shut 
down in a number of cities in the country. The strikers intend 
to continue the blackout until the debt is paid in full. 
Television, which was the pawn of the old system, whereby the 
viewer paid for its work by buying a television set, and then 
part of the money added to the value of the television set was 
redistributed at the top, now has to depend on government 
charity. A government that recently slashed the Russian radio 
and television company's budget by exactly 50 percent can hardly 
be described as particularly charitable. What is, in the 
circumstances, a reasonable decision to introduce television by 
subscription nonetheless could have serious social consequences. 
  The former leaders of the strike movement are hard on the 
heels of the striking communications workers. Although the 
strike by oilworkers at "Yuganskneftegaz," one of the country's 
biggest associations, planned for the same day, 10 February, has 
been postponed, the association's working people have not 
dropped their demands for the payment of debts. And we are 
talking here about R500 billion. They are demanding a revision 
of the system for the taxation of fuel and energy complex 
enterprises and are proposing that Viktor Chernomyrdin 
immediately hold an all-Russian conference of leaders of oil and 
gas enterprises, trade unions, and strike committees. At the 
same time, L. Mironov, chairman of the Russian oil and gas 
enterprise construction workers' trade union, appealed to the 
country's president. His open letter says that "the 
behind-the-scenes games of politicians in the government...are 
provoking mass actions by working people and the suspension of 
oil and gas production in the winter, which is bound to have the 
most disastrous consequences..." 
  Another trade union leader -- V. Ochekurov, chairman of the 
timber industry workers' trade union central committee -- 
appealed to the leaders of parliament. The timber workers 
warned that "there is a danger that timber processing 
enterprises will close down." The reasons are the same. No pay 
for five months. 
  Finally, we have the miners. The leaders of the Kuzbass 
workers' movement have just stated at a Moscow press conference 
that a major strike will begin on 1 March unless the government 
presents by then a program to resolve the economic crisis. 
  Blank television screens could certainly spark off new 
strikes this very winter.

  [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, 10 Feb -- The residents of 
Sakhalin and the Kurils found themselves "switched off" from 
Russia's information space today. The local telecommunications 
workers who are owed 200 million rubles just for last year by 
the "Sakhalin" television and radio company have expressed 
complete solidarity with their colleagues on the mainland. 
  The specific nature of the remote island region is that 
central newspapers take at least a week to get here. The only 
way of receiving up-to-date news is on the television.

<F P=106> [Report by Plaksyuk from Lvov] </F>
  [Text] Today in Lvov, a declaration was signed by members 
of the Joint Polish-Ukrainian Commission for Border Cooperation. 
Zamosc Vice Voivoda Bohdan Kowalko, leader and coordinator of 
the commission, delivered a speech. 
  [Begin Kowalko recording, in Polish fading into Ukrainian 
translation] The agreements which were signed demonstrate the 
striving of the two parties to achieve better mutual 
understanding and foster cooperation between two good, old 
neighbors. All the participants in the negotiations could speak 
out on the issue and could propose ways of resolving disputable 
issues on a mutually advantageous basis. We have reached a 
consensus on these issues, at least for the coming two years. 
[end recording] 
  The declaration reads: The parties to the declaration find 
it to be a stable form of cooperation between the local 
Ukrainian and Polish administration of the border regions. 
Cooperation on border issues should include the active 
participation of representatives of these border regions in the 
formulation of state policy in the sphere of border cooperation 
and the promotion of cooperation between small and medium-sized 
enterprises, between local and regional trade-industrial 
chambers, etc. In addition, the 1994-95 program of work on the 
Joint Polish-Ukrainian Commission for Border Cooperation was 
drafted. Next, participants in the meeting issued a statement 
in which they address the Polish and Ukrainian Governments and 
hold out hopes for the rapid resolution of the issue of putting 
the Khyrov-Kroscienko customs checkpoint into operation and the 
speeding up of construction of an international railway and 
motor vehicle checkpoint at Yagodin-Dorohusk. The operation of 
these checkpoints will enable citizens of the bordering 
mountainous regions [words indistinct] to develop bilateral 
cooperation.

  [Text] The National Space Agency of Ukraine has reached an 
agreement with the well-known European company Matra-Marconi 
Space on the latter's participation in the satellite program 
Lebid. The European Community has allocated $400,000 for its 
development. Such well-known Ukrainian enterprises and 
institutes as Dnipropetrovsk's Pivdenmash, Kiev's Kvant and 
Saturn, and Symferopol's Musson have also been included in the 
program. It is expected that, through the cooperation of the 
French, British, and Ukrainian firms, a communications satellite 
will be sent into geostationary orbit in 1997, most probably 
from the Baykonur launch facility. This was reported today by 
the national Space Agency of Ukraine.

  [Text] Taking account of its geopolitical situation, 
independent and democratic Ukraine will play an important part 
in creating security on the continent. This was stated by 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko while on an official 
visit to Brussels. He met journalists during the ceremony of 
signing a document on Ukraine's participation in the Partnership 
for Peace program. 
  What can our country offer NATO as a partner? Answering this 
question, the head of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said that 
participation in the Partnership for Peace would be in three 
directions: Primarily, this is joint military personnel 
exercises and training; participation in peace-keeping 
operations; and the development of these peacekeeping 
operations. He emphasized that Ukraine would take part in all 
programs linked with (?maintaining peace). 
  Journalists also showed interest in Zlenko's opinion with 
regard to what the reaction of Russia would be to Ukraine's 
involvement in the Partnership for Peace. To all appearances it 
will be positive, Anatoliy Zlenko answered.

  [Text] Russia and Ukraine, the two big Slav republics, 
maintain their total opposition to any kind of action by NATO 
forces against the Serbs in Bosnia. Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko, who has just made a speech in Madrid after his 
visit with Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana, repeated his 
view that air strikes could cause an escalation of the war. 
  He particularly underlined the danger involved for the 
civilian population, as well as for the Blue Helmet contingents 
stationed in the area. 
  [Begin Zlenko recording, in Spanish] I am very worried about 
the present situation in this region because the military 
contingent from my country is in Sarajevo, and you know that 
this situation makes us search for other solutions. [end

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Shekhovtsov] </F>
  [Text] Madrid February 10 TASS -- The first day of my visit 
to Spain was very strenuous and effective, Ukrainian Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, now on an official visit here, told 
ITAR-TASS. He said his conversation with head of the Spanish 
Government Felipe Gonzalez was interesting and substantial. 
They discussed a number of international problems, as well as 
prospects of the development of Spanish-Ukrainian relations. 
  On the same day, Zlenko continued, he had talks with his 
Spanish counterpart Javier Solana. The two sides initialled the 
Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Ukraine and Spain, 
signed a document on the freedom of movement of their citizens 
on each other's territory and discussed a number of agreements 
due to be signed soon. Aside from it, during the talks some 
matters were settled, which are connected with the preparation 
of an official visit of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to 
Spain, which is planned to take place in the first half of the 
current year. 
  According to Zlenko, a lively interest of Spanish business 
people in developing cooperation with Ukraine came as a surprise 
to him. He discussed the development of economic relations with 
Minister of Trade and Tourism Javier Gomez Navarro and at a 
meeting with representatives of the Spanish business and 
financial circles. 
  During the talks with Defence Minister Julian Garcia Vargas 
the sides devoted much attention to the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where both Spanish and Ukrainian soldiers 
are serving as part of the U.N. peace-keeping contingent. They 
exchanged views concerning the propopsals on the settlement of 
the Balkan conflict, which are being discussed at the NATO 
headquarters. The stands of Ukraine and Spain on those 
proposals are almost identical. Both sides believe it is 
necessary to further look for political ways of settling the 
conflict. Maximum effort should be exerted for attaining a 
peaceful settlement without permitting the militarisation of 
that region. Otherwise U.N. troops made up of soldiers from 
Spain, Ukraine, Russia and other countries may become hostages 
of the ill-considered decisions taken by politicians or 
diplomats, Zlenko said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko by Rafael </F>
Poch; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Poch] Kravchuk agreed in 
Massandra last year to hand over the whole Black Sea Fleet to 
Russia. Will that agreement be carried out? 
  [Zlenko] Kravchuk and Yeltsin had already discussed that 
matter at meetings before Massandra, such as those in Yalta and 
Dagomis. Ukraine's stance was clear. As an heir to the former 
USSR, it is entitled to part of its property, including part of 
the Black Sea Fleet. This fact, acknowledged by everybody, was 
confirmed at the Yalta meeting. It was agreed there that the 
Black Sea Fleet would be divided into two parts -- a Ukrainian 
part and a Russian part -- and also that the fleet would remain 
under joint command until complete agreement on its 
apportionment. Proceeding from its economic and military 
interests, Ukraine, as a sovereign state, is entitled to dispose 
of its part of the fleet. That is why in Massandra Yeltsin and 
Kravchuk signed a document which mentioned the possibility of 
Ukraine's selling to Russia its part of the fleet. Following 
Massandra, we are discussing aspects of the valuation and 
apportionment of the fleet, but it is premature to speak of a 
final agreement and even of its implementation. 
  [Poch] Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk said that any 
attempt to exploit the situation in Crimea will call into 
question the agreement on disarmament signed by Kravchuk, 
Clinton, and Yeltsin. Are you making the disarmament agreement, 
which has now been signed, conditional upon stability in Crimea? 
  [Zlenko] The situation in Crimea in general and its 
presidential election are internal matters of Crimea and 
Ukraine, and are outside the Foreign Ministry's scope. With 
respect to the agreement's signatories' reactions to the 
election, we do not see what you would call clear official 
attempts on Russia's part to use the situation in Crimea to its 
advantage. The United States has deemed Ukraine's stance on 
this matter balanced, and has warned Russia against actions 
which could destabilize the region.... Parliament's decision to 
lift its conditions for the ratification of the START I 
agreement and the Lisbon agreement should finally dispel any 
doubt: Ukraine remains firm on the path of nuclear disarmament 
and in its resolve to fulfill its international commitments, 
including the tripartite agreement. 
  [Poch] CIA Director Woolsey has said that it is possible 
that Ukraine will fragment over the next two years. Crimea and 
the Donbass want at least greater integration with Russia. 
Western Ukraine does not. What is the government's policy to 
prevent Ukraine's disintegration? 
  [Zlenko] The danger of separatism must in no event be 
underestimated.... We are aware of the economic, cultural, and 
social differences which history has created in Ukraine's 
various regions. Some irresponsible politicians, who, using the 
economic problems, are repeatedly inspiring separatist ideas, 
are trying to exploit them. However, even taking into account 
the enormous difficulties existing in Ukraine today, I cannot 
agree with the assertion that our state is on the verge of 
disintegration.... Ukraine is one of the CIS' most stable 
states, where the ethnic minorities' rights are respected. 
  [Poch] Russian nationalism, which is growing, is breaking 
you up. Why do you not acknowledge that economic and military 
reintegration with Russia is vital for Ukraine? 
  [Zlenko] We deem it a priority to develop good-neighborly 
relations with Russia.... Far from rejecting economic relations 
with Moscow and the CIS, we wish to bring them to a new 
qualitative level. As far as military union is concerned, 
Ukraine's stance was laid down in the declaration of 
sovereignty, which says that we are a neutral state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko by Enrique </F>
Serbeto in Kiev; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Serbeto] How do you believe 
Ukraine is viewed from Spain? 
  [Zlenko] Well, we have no pending problem with Spain. I 
believe that we are on very good terms. Spain's embassy is 
working very well in Kiev, and we are considering setting up our 
embassy in Madrid, and this will be one of the topics of 
conversation [during Zlenko's visit to Spain], since we hope to 
do so in the course of this year. We have many joint 
enterprises which are making their way in trade, and we hope 
that this process will be accelerated with the treaty of 
friendship and cooperation which we will sign and with President 
Leonid Kravchuk's visit, for which we will also be preparing 
during these days. Ukraine has been independent for two years, 
and has already established relations with many countries, 
including Spain. Now it is necessary to begin with the legal 
basis of our relationship, and this treaty represents a very 
real step toward our relations' embodiment in law. 
  [Serbeto] One of things which link Spain and Ukraine is that 
both countries are keeping troops in the former Yugoslavia. 
What is Kiev's stance on the possibility of a decision to 
launch air strikes in Bosnia in order to support the Blue 
Helmets' work? 
  [Zlenko] Ukraine believes that all possibilities of a 
negotiated solution should be sought, and through an overall 
view. It seems to us that the embargo against Serbia and 
Montenegro is creating a terrible situation in which only the 
children, who have no medicines, and the civilians, who are now 
beginning to have problems in feeding themselves, are suffering. 
I believe that this is creating bitterness and very great 
resentment among people who could believe that they now have 
nothing to lose, and so we would be fostering an uncontrolled 
reaction which could go beyond the Balkans and perhaps extend 
throughout Europe. I therefore believe that we should study the 
possibility of scaling down the blockade in return for being 
able to extend the humanitarian action to Serbia as well. 
People who do not eat and are desperate are capable of anything. 
  [Serbeto] Would Ukraine withdraw its troops if the United 
Nations had recourse to retaliation by air? 
  [Zlenko] Spain contributes 1,200 troops to the UN 
peacekeeping forces, who are on the spot like the Ukrainian 
troops. We do not want an escalation or an internationalization 
of the conflict, because our troops and the Spanish troops would 
become hostages of this situation.

  [Excerpts] Officials from Ukraine's leadership circles have 
falsified the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution of 3 
February 1994 [ratifying the START I Treaty]. This was a 
statement made by People's Deputy of Ukraine Serhiy Holovatyy at 
a news conference held in Kiev. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Holovatyy recording] My opinion is that officials 
from 
Ukraine's leadership circles have falsified the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council's resolution of 3 February 1994 [ratifying the 
START I Treaty]. These actions fall within those provided by the 
Criminal Code of Ukraine with regard to the crime under the name 
of falsification when in civil service. 
  The matter here is this. The initial version of Paragraph 2 
of the draft of this resolution submitted by the Ukrainian 
president, was as follows: The Government of Ukraine will be 
instructed to exchange the ratification certificates relating to 
the START Treaty. 
  During the discussion of this paragraph, I put forward an 
amendment, the essence of which was as follows: The sentence in 
the president's draft is to be augmented as follows: And to 
this end the government will step up its activity to conclude 
specific international agreements that follow from the 
reservations in the Supreme Council's resolution on the 
ratification of the START I Treaty [the resolution in question 
now is the original one of 18 November 1993]. 
  The second paragraph of the resolution, with my amendment in 
it, was put to the vote and adopted. 
  However, the official text of the Supreme Council's 
resolution, printed in government newspapers, offers a different 
version. It reads as follows: The Government of Ukraine will 
be instructed to exchange the certificates on the ratification 
of the START Treaty and will step up its activity to conclude 
specific international agreements that follow from the 
reservations in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution on 
the ratification of the START I Treaty. 
  The words -- to this end -- have been excluded from my 
amendment. I regard this as a correction that has essentially 
altered the text of the decision, rather than linguistically 
correcting or editing it. This is because the three words -- to 
this end -- and the sentence, or the decision, in Paragraph 2 
with these three words, envisage that the sequence of the 
government's actions relating to the START I will be as follows: 
First, concluding international agreements that follow from the 
resolution of 18 November [1993] -- when putting forward this 
amendment, in particular, I primarily had in mind security 
guarantees -- and then exchanging the ratification certificates. 
  The falsified text lacks this sequence. The conjunction -- 
and -- enabled the government to make a statement that Ukraine 
had lifted all reservations concerning the START I Treaty and, 
accordingly, security guarantees. So, I cannot interpret the 
lack of correspondence between the text of the shorthand record 
and the text of the official document published in the press, as 
anything other than a crime when in public service. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Zhirnikhin] </F>
  [Text] Budapest February 9 TASS -- Hungary and Ukraine have 
the same view as to the essence and key elements of the NATO 
Partnership for Peace programme, Ukrainian Defence Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy said upon the completion of today's talks with 
Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky in Budapest. After 
Ukraine signs in Brussels a document about joining the NATO 
programme, it intends "to put its possibilities into practice as 
soon as possible", he noted. 
  Answering questions from journalists, Radetskyy flatly 
dismissed assertions about increasing tensions between Russia 
and Ukraine. "Quite the contrary, now we are solving the 
problems which have long complicated relations between Kiev and 
Moscow, at least military technical aspects of these problems", 
the minister stressed. 
  When asked about the Crimean leaders' aspirations for a 
greater autonomy, Radetskyy assessed the current situation on 
the peninsula as "a normal and sound process". "The Crimea is 
part of Ukraine, therefore one can speak only about an autonomy 
stipulated by Ukraine's Constitution and laws and subordinate to 
them... This issue should not give rise to any problems or 
illusions", the minister emphasised. 
  Radetskyy also told reporters that during the talks with 
Jeszenszky, the two ministers came to the conclusion that "all 
existing problems should be solved by means of a calm and 
well-considered dialogue". The Ukrainian defence minister 
believes that all problems are eventually rooted in economic 
conditions. It is the economy that determines a country's 
policy, inter-state relations and public order on the whole, 
Radetskyy noted.

  [Text] Kiev, 9 Feb -- An agreement between Ukraine and 
Croatia on a visa-free entry procedure has been signed at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "In essence, Croatia and Ukraine 
were one state 80 years ago, noted Onesin Cvitan, ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Croatia to Ukraine. 
"Friendly links connected our countries during the time of 
Soviet power. I hope that Ukrainian-Croatian cooperation will 
grow stronger and reach a qualitatively new level by the end of 
the 20th Century." Valentyn Lipatov, deputy minister of foreign 
affairs of Ukraine, who took part in the signing of the document 
from the Ukrainian side, supported this opinion too. He 
emphasized: "The agreement between our countries on a visa-free 
entry procedure extends the possibilities of Ukrainian-Croatian 
cooperation in the area of trade links, exchanges of tourist 
delegations, and so on." 
  The ceremonial opening of Croatia's embassy and trade 
mission 
in Ukraine will take place in Kiev today.

  [Text] Moscow (February 9) TURAN -- The Russian Ambassador 
to Kyrgyzstan, Mikhail Romanov, met with Kyrgystan's Minister of 
Defense, Myrzakhan Subanov, in late January. A source at the 
Russian Foreign Ministry has reported the signing of a 
trilateral pact on military cooperation between Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. This plan to form a strong military 
coalition in Central Asia came as a surprise to Russia. 
According to available information, even Boris Gromov, Deputy 
Defense Minister of Russia, who visited Bishkek recently, was 
not informed about the treaty signing. 
  During the talks, Subanov expressed his preparedness to sign 
a bilateral treaty with Russia. The parties agreed to begin 
immediate preparations of the documents. These documents will 
be signed during Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's 
visit to Kyrgyzstan in late February.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 10, BNS -- The Human Rights Institute 
released a protest against Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev's recent statement in which he claims the Baltic states 
violate human rights. 
  Kozyrev's statement said the Baltic states violate the 
rights 
of people of Russian origin on an ethnic basis. He accused them 
of planning forcible deportation of thousands of people and an 
ethnic cleansing. 
  The institute declared that the international CSCE, U.N. and 
Council of Europe commissions have not observed in the Baltic 
states violations of human rights on an ethnic basis. 
  The institute voiced the opinion that accusations of human 
rights violations stem from Russia's interest in keeping its 
forces in the Baltic states and subjecting those countries to 
its imperialistic ambitions.

  [Text] The event we are talking about happened about three 
weeks ago, yet we have to report it just to ask this one 
question: Why did the first auction held in our navy, and 
perhaps in the whole of the Russian army, take place in secret? 
They were not selling the most up-to-date equipment, just 
obsolete naval vessels. Three were purchased by St. Petersburg 
firms to break up for scrap and the fourth -- a medium 
amphibious warfare ship -- to be converted into a freighter. 
  On the whole the auction was deemed a success. However, the 
command of the Baltic Fleet was in no hurry to appraise it; 
indeed it had earlier been sharply criticized by the Ministry of 
Defense for its commercial activity. That is why there was a 
shroud of secrecy over the auction and why no journalists were 
there, even though we have all known for a long time that with 
the loss of the bases in the Baltic countries and with the fleet 
being cut back auctions like this could well resolve one of the 
most acute issues -- that of financing the housing program for 
servicemen and their families.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 11 -- The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
newspaper focuses today on the problem of crime in Russia. The 
newspaper informs its readers of a meeting held by the Interior 
Ministry collegium, which called on the Russian Government "not 
to save money on support for law enforcement bodies". 
  The same newspaper writes about a legislative initiative by 
the Russia's Choice faction at the State Duma (lower house of 
the Russian parliament) on crime control considered by the 
faction as the main present-day problem. 
  However, the newspaper notes, the Russia's Choice initiative 
is blocked at the Duma by the factions of Agrarians, Communists 
and the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  Pointing to the fact that "a new stage starts in the 
development of organised crime in Russia", the NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA newspaper regards this as "the beginning of political 
terrorism". 
  The same newspaper states that "Russia now experiences dire 
hunger for an ideology of reforms". It notes in this connection 
that "the creation of an economic policy out of illusory 
contradictory ideas on restoring industry and on continued cuts 
of state expenditures has now more to do with public relations 
than with real possibilities of the government to pursue this 
policy". 
  Newspapers also concentrate attention on the continuing 
strike by mine builders at some collieries in Vorkuta (Russia's 
north). Noting that Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin will meet the 
miners' delegation on Friday, the TRUD newspaper expresses hope 
that the conflict will be settled. 
  The PRAVDA newspaper, comparing mining strikes with "a 
winter 
hurricane after a shock therapy", stresses that other strikes 
also started. For instance, "Thousands of lecturers from 
hundreds of Russian higher educational establishments" went on 
strike. 
  TRUD features an interview with Chairman of the State 
Property Committee Anatoliy Chubays, dealing with progress in 
privatisation in Russia. 
  Examining the situation with privatisation in Russia, he 
notes that "to all appearances, privatisation has been 
accomplished. It has been accomplished, despite the fierce 
resistance of bureaucratic structures at all levels and some 
political forces". 
  Commenting on the results of a trip by Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev to Central Asian republics, the KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA newspaper stresses that "the joint statement made by the 
Russian and Uzbek Foreign Ministries in Tashkent on February 9 
reflects the principal position on Afghanistan". 
  "Apart from expressing deep concern over events in the 
neighbouring state, the statement confirms principles of strict 
neutrality and non-interference in Afghanistan's domestic 
affairs." 
  The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper carries an article by 
prominent American politilogist Steven Cohen entitled "Who Lost 
Russia". The author writes that "seriously wounded, polarised 
and riled Russia direly needs reasonable, concerted and gradual 
reforms". 
  He notes in this connection that a broad coalition of 
Russian 
moderate centrist politicians seeks to become a political force 
which could review the process of reforms. 
  This moderate bloc is Russia's hope, possibly, its last 
chance to carry out democratic changes based on market 
relations, Cohen stresses. 
  Commenting on international events, the press singles out 
the 
aggravated problem of the Bosnian crisis. Newspapers point to 
the determination of NATO, using the ultimatum put forth before 
Bosnian Serbs, to tackle the problem by force. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA points to different approaches of NATO 
and Russia to this problem. The newspaper even writes that 
"although it is highly improbable, but a full-scale war may 
break out nine days later" (eds: deadline of NATO's ultimatum to 
Serbs).

  [Text] Moscow February 10 TASS -- Chairman of the Russian 
State Duma Ivan Rybkin said that by participating in the 
December 1993 elections the deputies admitted the 
constitutionality of the presidential decision to disband the 
former parliament. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday [10 
February], Rybkin said that he did not see any sin in the 
establishment of a commission to investigate into the October 
1993 revolt in Moscow, making it clear that whatever the 
findings they will be of no more than academic value. 
  The news conference was held in a peaceful atmosphere. The 
Duma chairman tried to smooth out sharp issues and stick to the 
constructive-reconciliatory tone which he has assumed from the 
day of his election. 
  He spoke about good cooperation between the Duma and the 
president, the government and the Federation Council and denied 
statements that he was seeking to subjugate the whole house and 
receive unlimited powers similar to those of his predecessor, 
Ruslan Khasbulatov. 
  Asked about the attitude of the Duma towards and his own 
position on the trial of scientist Vil Mirzayanov accused of 
betraying state secrets about chemical weapons, Rybkin replied 
that the Duma human rights committee is now considering this 
issue. 
  Speaking about the situation in connection with the upcoming 
local elections, he described it as rather complicated, adding 
that the State Duma's position is "very delicate." "We can 
determine the basic principles of the electoral laws for the 
subjects of the Federation, but we do not want to impose 
anything on anyone," Rybkin said. 
  He opposed calls for revising the constitution, saying that 
"since it is adopted, we, as loyal citizens, should abide by 
it." He stressed, however, that amendments can be adopted 
because the constitution has many flaws. 
  Commenting on the situation in agriculture, Rybkin admitted 
that often huge state subsidies to the agro-industrial complex 
were ineffective. But now subsidies should be targeted. "Those 
who are ripe for bankruptcy, should be declared bankrupt," he 
said. 
  Speaking about foreign debts, Rybkin stressed that Russia is 
owed 1.5 times more than it owes others. This question has been 
ignored for a long time in the government, he added. Rybkin 
suggested selling other countries's debts to Russia at 65-80 per 
cent of their nominal value.

  [Text] Moscow February 12 TASS -- The State Duma of Russia 
has demanded today from the Russian Government to take urgent 
measures to resolve the crisis in the northern regions. A 
resolution adopted by the Duma has proposed to the executive and 
legislature to form a working group jointly with trade unions of 
the north for promptly adopting decisions to find a way out of 
the social and economic crisis that prevails in northern 
regions, and also to monitor the implementation of these 
decisions. 
  While preparing a draft budget for 1994, the government has 
also been recommended to foresee the purposeful formation of 
economic mechanisms for finding a way out of the crisis and to 
ensure social guarantees to citizens living and working in the 
northern regions. 
  The State Duma has instructed the Federal and Political 
Affairs Committee of the house, in particular, to prepare a 
draft concept of a federal law on state policy in northern 
regions of the Russian Federation and present for consideration 
of the Duma by April 20 this year. 
  This State Duma has made it binding on this committee to 
prepare and present for consideration of the house proposals 
about introducing changes and addenda into the Russian 
Federation law "on state guarantees and compensations to people 
living and working in areas of the farthest north and equated to 
them localities." The Duma considers to give priority to review 
this draft bill in this year, and also other documents, which 
will be prepared in context of the social-economic situation 
created in the northern regions of Russia.

  [Text] Moscow February 11 TASS -- The State Duma adopted 
today a revised draft resolution on the legal basis for the 
election of state bodies in subjects of the Russian Federation, 
as well as local government bodies, and on ensuring electoral 
rights of citizens. The discussion of the first version of the 
draft law several days ago was too passionate, and the draft law 
did not get the needed number of votes. Today the document was 
approved by the majority of deputies. 
  Following the coming into force of the new constitution and 
the need for bringing legislative acts of subjects of the 
Russian Federation into line with it, as well as in connection 
with elections to the representative bodies of power and local 
government bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, at 
which violations of the federal legislation took place, the 
State Duma resolved to give some recommendations to the 
president of the Russian Federation as the guarantor of the 
constitution, of human rights and freedoms. 
  It recommended to the president to take measures for putting 
an end to the violation of electoral rights of individuals and 
the rights of local government bodies in the legal acts of 
subjects of the Russian Federation, adopted by their executive 
authorities, including a possible suspension of those legal 
acts. In the opinion of the State Duma, it is also necessary to 
take measures for bringing into line with the new Russian 
Constitution the presidential decrees and normative acts of 
subjects of the Russian Federation, which regulate general 
principles of the organisation of representative and executive 
bodies of state power of subjects of the Russian Federation, as 
well as of local government authorities. 
  It was suggested to bodies of state power of subjects of the 
Russian Federation, the Russian prosecutor-general and the 
Central Electoral Commission that they take measures for 
bringing into line with the Russian Constitution and legislation 
legal acts of subjects of the Russian Federation on the election 
of bodies of state power and local government authorities. 
  The Committee for the Affairs of the Federation and Regional 
Policy and the Committee for Local Government Problems of the 
State Duma were assigned to work out as a matter of priority 
federal draft laws on general principles of the organisation of 
the system of state bodies in subjects of the Russian 
Federation, as well as local government bodies.

  [Text] Moscow February 11 TASS -- Meeting on Thursday [10 
February], the council of the Russian State Duma, which consists 
of the heads of parliamentary factions, has appointed Andrey 
Voykov to head the lower chamber's apparatus, Duma Speaker Ivan 
Rybkin told the chamber today. 
  Although, in principle, the appointment could have been 
regarded as a fait accompli and, therefore, was not included in 
the agenda of the session, figuring only as the speaker's 
announcement, it triggered a stormy debate in the chamber today. 
This is explained by the fact that Andrey Voykov had so far 
held the post of assistant head of the presidential 
administration and this determined the attitude of some deputies 
to his candidature. 
  In the course of the debate, triggered by the speaker's 
announcement, it became clear that representatives of the 
factions of the Agrarian Party, the Communist Party, and the 
Liberal-Democratic Party were in principle against this 
candidature. Finally, however, the right to make the final 
decision was left to the speaker. Most deputies, attending the 
session, voted against Rybkin presenting the new head of the 
Duma apparatus to them today.

  [Text] Moscow February 11 TASS -- Speaker of the Russian 
State Duma Ivan Rybkin made it clear that he would not run the 
lower chamber the way former parliament Chairman Ruslan 
Khasbulatov did and is going to cooperate with the president and 
the prime minister. 
  "My main task in the assembly hall is to conduct sessions in 
such a way, so that, without imposing my own point of view, all 
opinions of deputies are clarified and the rights of the 
minority protected", Rybkin told the "NEW WEEKLY GAZETTE" 
[NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA] on Friday. 
  Former parliament Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov, who was 
arrested after the October opposition revolt in Moscow, acted in 
a completely different way, denying the floor to his opponents 
and imposing his own will on the parliament. 
  Rybkin also said that since the moment of his election as 
the 
speaker he had seen no opposition from the president and the 
prime minister. 
  "From the very beginning of my activities as the chairman of 
the Duma all contacts with the president, the prime minister, 
mayors of Moscow and St. Petersburg show that there is no 
hostility between us. These are normal businesslike relations", 
Rybkin said and added that some politicians would like it to be 
otherwise. 
  "Some people, because of their own political interests, do 
not like such a normal cooperation. But that is their own 
problem. The question is not whether they belong to Communists 
or Agrarians, but in whether they want or do not want to work 
normally", Rybkin stressed. 
  The speaker added that he wants to accumulate in his work 
everything positive from the experience of pre-revolutionary 
Russian Duma and the former parliament.

  [Text] Closed parliamentary hearings on the issue of 
Russo-Georgian relations in connection with the signing of the 
treaty of friendship, good-neighborliness and mutual assistance 
and other issues in Russo-Georgian relations are taking place in 
the State Duma. Our correspondent Yevgeniy Zherebenkov reports: 
  [Zherebenkov] Judging from the information which it has been 
possible to obtain from some of the participants in the 
hearings, the essence of the proposals made by parliamentarians 
boils down to the fact that the recently signed Russian-Georgian 
treaty needs to be substantially amended and in its present form 
virtually stands no chance of being ratified in the Russian 
parliament. This is what I was in told in particular by deputy 
Yevgeniy Ambartsumov: 
  [Begin Ambartsumov recording] This has to do with the 
discussion of the Russo-Georgian treaty and of its consequences, 
especially the hidden consequences. Various points of view on 
this score are being voiced. The fear is being expressed that 
the assistance through this treaty to Shevardnadze and the 
government in order to stabilize the situation in Georgia could 
turn into the destabilization of the situation in Russia itself, 
specifically in the area of the northern Caucasus. For 
instance, the following question arose of what the cost to 
Russia will be of this -- supporting Georgia, equipping military 
bases, military aid, humanitarian aid, well, taking into account 
Russia's grave economic situation. The most important problem 
is relations with the republics of the Northern Caucasus, plus 
Abkhazia, North Ossetia, etc. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov, Andrey Lekant report under the "CIS" </F>
rubric: "Russia-Georgia Treaty Discussed in Duma. The Ranks of 
its Opponents Changing Formation"] 
  [Text] The Duma committee for CIS affairs and relations 
with compatriots held closed-door hearings yesterday on 
questions of Russia-Georgia relations in connection with the 
treaty of friendship, good-neighborliness, and cooperation 
between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia 
signed by Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze on 3 February. 
  The pivotal topics of the hearings were points 3 and 4 of 
the 
treaty "on aid in the creation of armed forces of the Republic 
of Georgia, equipping them, and the acquisition of armaments, 
military hardware and technology," and on border troops of 
Russia and Georgia, as well as a point on the recognition of the 
republic's territorial integrity -- that is to say, questions 
which in sum could lead to an exacerbation of the situation in 
the region. Aired at the hearings were messages from many 
Caucasus regions whose authorities doubt that the Georgian side 
could guarantee that arms provided by Russia will not end up in 
the hands of criminal elements, while Mr. Zatulin, chairman of 
the committee for CIS affairs, voiced bewilderment in connection 
with the appearance in the text of the treaty of the names of 
concrete military bases and of their "branches" on the territory 
of Georgia. 
  Present at the hearings were deputations of the Foreign 
Ministry; the Defense Ministry; the State Committee on Civil 
Defense, Emergency Situations, and Recovery from Natural 
Disasters; the Ministry for CIS Affairs; the Finance Ministry, 
and of the other executive branch agencies privy to the 
elaboration of the treaty and the concomitant agreements, and in 
addition to them, separately, representatives of the contracting 
parties of Georgia and Abkhazia. 
  The arguments in favor of signing the treaty presented by 
Mr. 
Pastukhov, deputy foreign minister; by Colonel General Galkin, 
Defense Ministry representative; and by Mr. Smirnov of the 
Ministry for CIS Affairs, were sufficiently well considered, 
according to parliamentary analysts, and raised no special 
objections from deputies and experts. The main opponent of the 
arguments was a representative of Abkhazia, Mr. Dzhevgeniya, who 
put the main stress on the unsettled status of relations between 
Sukhumi and Tbilisi. 
  At the close of the session, journalists were admitted to 
the 
room to hear commentaries from participants in the hearings. 
Konstantin Zatulin promised a corresponding statement from his 
committee, but not before Monday. On the whole, the deputies' 
dissatisfactions with the agreement boiled down to two: first, 
the text of the documents; second, the signing procedure. The 
latter dissatisfaction seems to have especially hurt the 
committee on CIS affairs and its chairman personally: The 
documents had been prepared without their knowledge, the appeal 
by all Duma factions to the president not to sign the treaty for 
the time being had been ignored, and Boris Yeltsin's word that 
he was not going to submit the document for ratification before 
Georgian-Abkhaz and Georgian-Ossetian relations have been 
normalized, placed the authors of the above appeal in an idiotic 
situation. Mr. Zatulin tried to get out of it by pointing out, 
on one hand, the fruitful contacts with the executive branch at 
the time of organizing the hearings; and on the other, by 
supposing that it was the appeal of the Duma factions that made 
the president wait a little for the ratification of the treaty. 
A plausible version, but too elaborate. 
  Most likely, the main objective of those who arranged the 
hearings was to demonstrate their ability to organize calm 
multilateral negotiations and discussions, while their motive 
was the fact that Mr. Zatulin apparently did not wish to be 
branded for causing yet another standoff between the two power 
branches.

  [Text] Moscow February 11 TASS -- An influential faction of 
the Russian State Duma resolutely protested against possible air 
strikes on Bosnia and called on the Russian leadership to veto 
them if the issue is discussed in the UN Security Council. 
  "The Russian representative in the Security Council should 
use the right of the veto in case the issue of air operations of 
NATO (in Bosnia) is discussed", the Party of Russian Unity and 
Accord (PRES), headed by Sergey Shakhray, said in a statement 
circulated in the Duma on Friday. 
  On Thursday Russia called for an emergency meeting of the UN 
Security Council on Bosnia. 
  Air strikes on the conflicting sides in Bosnia are 
"inadmissible and extremely dangerous", PRES said in the 
statement, adding that the strikes will cause much more 
casualties than the mortar attack on Sarajevo market on Saturday 
which claimed at least 68 lives. 
  "In the concrete conditions of Bosnia-Herzegovina air 
strikes 
cannot be either limited or selective. The tragedy in Sarajevo 
market will be multiplied in case of bombardments", the faction 
said. 
  The direct involvement of NATO forces in combat actions will 
escalate violence which can spread to other countries and result 
in unpredictable consequences, the faction warned and said that 
it is only possible to ensure ground protection of UN 
humanitarian convoys in Bosnia.

  [Text] Moscow, February 11 TASS -- Russian lawmakers voted 
down on Friday a proposal of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) 
of nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to send an official 
delegation of the State Duma to former Yugoslavia for a 
fact-finding mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The proposal to include the issue into the Friday agenda was 
made by LDPR member Aleksey Mitrofanov, but was rejected. 
  During a recent tour of former Yugoslavia, Zhirinovskiy 
warned the West that he would view any air strikes on Bosnian 
Serbs as an attack on Russia and pledged full support to the 
Serbian population. 
  Also on Friday another Duma faction, the Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord, released a statement calling for a Russian 
veto on air strikes if the issue is discussed in the UN Security 
Council.

<F P=106> [From the "Panorama" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Kalyagin] We have invited to our studio today 
Vladimir Petrovich Lukin, the chairman of the Committee for 
International Affairs of the Russian State Duma, who was until 
very recently Russian ambassador in Washington, and councillor 
at the embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Mr. Djuro 
(?Kreneta). Vladimir Petrovich, certain differences have 
emerged between Russia and its Western partners. What do you 
think, is this a result of the Zhirinovskiy factor? Or is it a 
question of deeper, fundamental changes in our foreign policy? 
  [Lukin] Well, in the first place I would not dramatize, or 
globalize the Zhirinovskiy factor. What is the Zhirinovskiy 
factor? Sometimes a politician here only has to start squealing 
like a piglet or screaming like a woman in labor, and some 
factors or other start appearing. We are talking about one of 
the factions, not a majority faction. The statement adopted by 
the State Duma on Yugoslavia was not a statement proposed by the 
Liberal Democrats. So we are talking about the mood of the 
Russian people, and as an expression of this mood, the mood in 
the Duma itself, not in one faction, but in many, practically 
the overwhelming majority of factions. This is the mood of our 
public, which consists of this, that what is needed is 
international efforts to eliminate this crisis, and in this we 
differ radically from the Liberal Democrats, they are needed not 
by way of using violence -- violence will entail further 
violence, not stop violence. [passage omitted] 
  [Lukin] I was speaking to the well-known U.S. politician and 
diplomat James Collins yesterday, at his request, and he 
admitted that the process is under way, that both the Serbs and 
Muslims are surrendering their artillery, that is, the process 
of disarmament is really under way. 
  [Kalyagin] So you think force will not be used by NATO? 
  [Lukin] I cannot think that, because there could be two 
alternatives here. The alternative of genuine interest on the 
part of NATO and the Western countries in Sarajevo not being 
shelled -- this is a legitimate interest -- and the alternative 
of looking for any pretext, which is unfortunately being whipped 
up by some of the Muslim leaders, to intervene at any price and 
foist their own understanding and their own solution to this 
matter. Just look at what happened with the so-called mortar 
bomb at the Sarajevo market. This is really very similar to the 
Reichstag fire, it was as though it was done to order 
immediately prior to the foreign ministers' conference, the day 
before. 
  [Kalyagin] And if the bombing still goes ahead? What could 
that lead to? What do you think? 
  [Lukin] If that happens, it could lead to very bad 
consequences in terms of Russia's relations, our trust in the 
countries of the West. You see, there are two kinds of 
relations -- relations between partners, and relations with a 
boss. When a decision is made first, and then the other side is 
informed of the decision that has already been made, that is 
relations with a boss. Relations between partners mean that 
first of all there is very careful and serious discussion of the 
issues, and then a joint, considered decision is made. That is 
what I am in favor of. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Irek Namyz report in the "Russian Federation" column: "The </F>
`Roundtable' on Nationalities Issues. Sergey Shakhray Advises 
Attending to Chechen Problems"] 
  [Text] The "roundtable" on nationalities problems in 
Moscow yesterday heard statements by Ramazan Abdulatipov, 
Federation Council speaker; and Sergey Shakhray, nationalities 
and regional policy minister. According to Ramazan Abdulatipov, 
in the present situation it is necessary to study the problem of 
self-determination of the Russian people and to devote a 
separate scientific conference to the Russian question in 
Russia. Sergey Shakhray formulated three principles of his 
department's activity: National parity, self-organization, and 
national paternalism. "I do not agree with the thesis that the 
curve of interethnic conflicts in Russia is falling," Sergey 
Shakhray stated. In his words, the ongoing division of 
portfolios at the center has left the Russian regions to their 
own devices. The nationalities minister believes that self- 
organization by part of the Russian population in crisis areas 
can bring about a situation where Russians also become an armed 
party to interethnic conflicts. He said that the ministry will 
form three subdivisions on three blocks of problems. The first 
will deal exclusively with nationalities issues; the second, 
with the financial and economic aspects of regional policy; and 
the third, with northern problems. 
  Responding to a question about his attitude to Chechnya, 
Sergey Shakhray stated that the federal power bodies must 
finally express their position on this issue, not sweep it under 
the rug. He thinks that at present the Chechen Republic is part 
of the Russian Federation de jure but in fact has no economic or 
political links with Russia, only criminal ones. A preliminary 
condition for the start of negotiations with Groznyy, according 
to the minister, should be free democratic elections to power 
bodies in the Chechen Republic, necessarily with opposition 
participation. Sergey Shakhray cited the pending treaty with 
Tatarstan as an example of constructive cooperation between the 
center and the regions and the building of a new federal policy. 
In his opinion, such treaties are the sole possible method of 
removing contradictions between the Russian Federation 
constitution and the constitutions of the republics.

  [Text] Groznyy February 13 TASS -- Yaragiy Mamodayev, head 
of the Chechen Government of People's Confidence dissolved by 
President Dzhokhar Dudayev, demanded that the republic's 
authorities immediately release General Ibragim Suleymenov. 
  He said in a press release on Sunday that General Suleymenov 
"was and remains a member of Chechnya's legally elected 
parliament, as well as defence minister in the Government of 
People's Confidence of the Chechen Republic". 
  "His illegal arrest by supporters of the Chechen ruling 
regime may exhaust the patience of our government and force it 
to take adequate measures" if Suleymenov is not set free in the 
near future, Mamodayev warned. He did not elaborate on 
"adequate measures" and did not specify the date from which his 
ultimatum was to come into force. But he stressed that "the 
Government of People's Confidence has everything it needs for 
taking such measures". 
  General Suleymenov headed armed opposition in Chechnya after 
Dudayev disbanded the Chechen Parliament last spring and 
declared open war on political opposition. The general formed 
an opposition army of several hundreds of fighters. In early 
February, he conducted military exercises of his army and 
demanded President Dudayev's resignation. On February 9, 
Suleymenov and his bodyguards were arrested by Chechen Security 
Department officers. So far, he has not been officially charged 
with any crime.

  [Text] The strike of nearly 300 mine construction workers 
in pit No. 33 in Vorkuta, Komi Republic of Russia, is five days 
old. Igor Nikoforov, leader of the Independent Miners' Union in 
the Pechorashakhtstroy concern told Interfax that the workers 
would continue their protest action until back payment was 
guaranteed to them. 
  Currently, 121 strikers are staying underground and about 
the 
same number of them engaging in a sit-in at surface 
installations. Nearly 20 of them have come down with the flu. 
  Nikoforov, who stayed the weekend with the strikers trying 
to 
convince them to leave the pit and continue their action in 
surface installations, said that the men were desperate. "They 
are increasingly irritated with the indifference on the part of 
the government and some of them suggest addressing the Liberal 
Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on the theory that 
he would respond, at least," Nikiforov said. 
  "The strikers are demanding what they have earned and are 
tired of problems in collecting the cash due them," Nikiforov 
continued. They told him that they did not care who the 
president or the prime minister is when their families are 
starving. 
  The union has run out of the strike fund and has no cash to 
buy foodstuffs for the mine construction workers, Nikiforov said.

  [Text] After he said he would not run for Ingush president 
on February 27, Ruslan Aushev said he has changed his mind. 
  In a statement he published jointly with current Ingush Vice 
President Boris Agapov in Nazran today, Aushev pointed out that 
"the people's will was above all for him." 
  During his meeting with candidates to the new republican 
parliament which will be re-elected on the same day, Aushev was 
told that the people will boycott the elections and a referendum 
on the new Ingush constitution if he refused nomination for 
president. 
  The statement points out: "We, with respect to the revival 
of 
the statehood of the Ingush people, consolidation of the people 
of Ingushetia in the name of peace and prosperity, having 
respect for numerous requests, oral and written addresses by 
workers, elders, clergymen, youth and representatives of all 
other layers of society and considering it impossible not to 
meet their wishes, express our consent to fulfil the duties of 
president and vice president of Ingushetia, if our powers are 
confirmed at the elections on February 27, 1994." 
  Observers believe that their statement is actually a form of 
registration for president and vice president. Their opinion 
was later confirmed by the central election commission chairman, 
Batyr Taldiyev.

  [Text] Moscow, 12 Feb -- The telephone conversation between 
the Russian and U.S. presidents over the Bosnian problem took 
place on 11 February, rather than on 9 or 10 February as 
expected earlier. This delay caused speculations in the media 
over the state of repair of the Russian Federation 
communications system. 
  On this matter, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told 
ITAR-TASS today that "there are absolutely no technical 
communications problems on our part, it would be better to ask 
the other side about this." "All allegations that one cannot get 
a line to Moscow are absolutely unfounded," he emphasized. 
  Andrey Kozyrev also said that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin 
is in good shape and he has had a phone conversation with him. 
"There are no problems at all in this respect either," the 
minister remarked.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "W. Clinton Could Have Gotten </F>
Through to B. Yeltsin If He Had Wanted To"] 
  [Text] On 11 February world agencies reported on a 
briefing at the White House on the adoption by the NATO Council, 
at the level of representatives of the member countries, of a 
decision which, as is known, presupposes the possibility of 
bombing raids on Serbian positions in Bosnia. 
  During the briefing, White House press secretary Dee Dee 
Myers said, in particular, that President Clinton had "tried to 
get through to Yeltsin before the announcement of NATO's 
decision. Unfortunately, their conversation did not take place." 
  This statement clearly qualifies as sensational on two 
counts. Even in the cold war years there was no occasion when 
the leaders of the two great powers were unable to hear one 
another in an emergency. Second, your IZVESTIYA correspondent 
has seen the mobile presidential communications switchboards 
which are set up wherever he might be at any time of the day or 
night: in a car, in an aircraft (from the big presidential 
TU-154 M to the small Yak-40, on which he occasionally makes 
short flights, and the helicopter, which is used for trips to 
his out-of-town residence, and so on). 
  V. Ilyushin, the president's principal assistant [pervyy 
pomoshchnik], told INTERFAX that B. Yeltsin had been ready to 
talk for 90 minutes and had waited for the call "for as long as 
he decently could." 
  Your IZVESTIYA correspondent also managed to establish that 
"non-hotline" communications between the two presidents are 
conducted via a switchboard at the Foreign Ministry. A. Lake, 
the U.S. president's national security assistant, got through to 
Moscow via this switchboard, and this fact might refute Mrs. 
Myers' words about technical difficulties. 
  So what we are talking about probably is political 
"difficulties." Washington wanted to wait for the NATO Council 
decision on the Serbian question, and only then perhaps inform 
the Russian president.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Veslo report under the "Hello" rubric: "Clinton </F>
Tried To Reach Yeltsin for Three Days. Yavlinskiy Did Not Sleep 
an Entire Night"] 
  [Excerpts] Last night a telephone conversation between the 
presidents of the United States and Russia finally took place. 
Earlier, according to REUTER, Bill Clinton tried to reach Boris 
Yeltsin to discuss NATO's decision on an ultimatum to the 
Bosnian Serbs, but to no avail. [passage omitted] 
  Anatoliy Krasikov, chief of the Russian president's press 
service, said to your SEGODNYA correspondent that all 
communications services were in 100 percent working condition, 
and that Boris Yeltsin was waiting for the call at the agreed 
time. So, interference, if any, must have been outside Russia. 
  Viktor Ilyushin, first aide of the Russian president, 
expressed his view to INTERFAX's correspondent: "This is the 
first such incident in our practice. What remains is to express 
regret that the two sides did not manage to organize the 
dialogue." 
  Mr. Ilyushin noted, however, that in order for a telephone 
conversation to take place both interlocutors should be on the 
phone. For instance, on Thursday, President Yeltsin was ready 
to talk for an hour and a half. He had been waiting for a 
conversation with the White House "for as long as the rules of 
propriety allow," the presidential aide said. 
  The reaction from politicians, particularly democratic 
leaders close to the president, was fairly balanced: "Boris 
Yeltsin has disappeared from the horizon -- so what? This is 
not the first time." Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, however, complained 
to your SEGODNYA correspondent that he did not sleep on the 
night of Thursday and Friday, because his Western acquaintances 
besieged him with the question of where the Russian president 
had gone.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] Today marks the start of the alarming 
count-down of the 10-day ultimatum which representatives of the 
North Atlantic Alliance have given the Serbs. If the siege of 
Sarajevo is not lifted, NATO will begin bombing Serb positions. 
  [Commentator F. Tavrovskiy] This is far from the first 
ultimatum that has been given. One can cite similarities with 
the years of the Cold War when China gave the United States its 
547th serious and final warning for violating its territorial 
waters. Things are different here, and the most important 
difference in this ultimatum is the existence of a strictly 
defined 10-day period. Moreover, now NATO does not need to 
spend a long time seeking consent from the large UN bureaucracy. 
The decision to start bombing will be taken directly with the 
participation of Butrus-Ghali. 
  Now there is only Russia which can lift the threat from the 
Serbs. Today Russia called for the urgent convening of the UN 
Security Council to discuss the crisis. As Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Adamishin stated, Russia is calling for a 
settlement of the Bosnian conflict by means of demilitarizing 
Sarajevo and handing over the city to UN control. Adamishin 
expressed disagreement with the view that Butrus-Ghali has given 
NATO authority to carry out bombing strikes. Butrus-Ghali has 
only asked whether the North Atalantic Alliance is ready, if 
necessary, to make its aviation available but he did not hand 
over UN functions to NATO, Adamishin stressed. 
  The deputy foreign minister said that in the near future 
Boris Yeltsin will have telephone conversations with the leaders 
of Western countries on the question of Bosnia. 
  [Announcer] All the same, it should be noted that the 
statement made by Russia today puts it in a rather complicated 
position. In the first place, the decision by the North 
Atlantic Alliance is already based on a UN Security Council 
resolution which allows military force to be used in extreme 
cases. Therefore, the attempts of the Russian leaders to 
transfer the discussion of the Bosnian question to the Security 
Council will, most likely, not be successful. This dissenting 
position by Russia, perhaps for the first time in recent years, 
is putting it on the path toward confrontation with Western 
diplomacy.

<F P=106> [Report from Moscow by correspondent Catherine Jentile] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Jentile] In Moscow, the time has come to gather 
support for the Bosnian Serbs. The now-famous extremist, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy took a first step a few days ago. 
Displaying one of his acolytes dressed in Serbian combat 
uniform he explained: With this uniform, but with Russian 
weapons, the Serbs will respond to every aggression. 
  Last night the ultranationalist leader rammed his message 
home, at the very time when NATO was delivering its ultimatum: 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording, in French] If French airmen 
bomb the cities of Bosnia, then one day we will bomb French 
cities, and even Paris. [end recording] 
  [Jentile] This morning, the Russian government also made its 
voice heard, questioning NATO's right to decide on air strikes, 
and appealing to the United Nations. A little later, the 
Russian Army announced that it was beginning early warning 
exercises [exercices de mise en alerte] for the headquarters of 
their strategic nuclear forces. For now, however, there is no 
question of crossing the boundary between exercises and reality: 
  [Begin recording of Anatoliy Adamishin, deputy Russian 
foreign minister, in Russian, with superimposed French 
translation] What could we do if NATO were to carry out such air 
strikes? We obviously do not have the material means to oppose 
them. So we will not go to war with NATO. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Kalintsev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 11 TASS -- Vice-President of the 
North Atlantic Assembly - NATO parliament and expert of foreign 
policy affairs of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDPG) 
in Bundestag (Germany's Parliament) Karsten Voigt expressed 
doubts in the expediency of the NATO ultimatum given to the 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  He told journalists in Moscow today that the decision 
regarding the ultimatum was adopted at a high-level session of 
the European Union (EU) and session of the NATO Permanent 
Council in Brussels. The ultimatum's essence is a threat of 
carrying out air strikes on Serb positions, if the Serbs do not 
pull out their heavy weapons from the security zone around 
Sarajevo by a specified date, he said. 
  The problem is not to put an end to the inhuman siege of the 
Bosnian capital, the German parliamentarian added, nobody is 
opposed to it. The question concerns consequences of such a 
step, which are difficult to predict now. In order to put the 
ultimatum into action, inevitably further decisions will have to 
be adopted, which will not only involve a military, but also a 
political risk. At stake is the prestige of the U.N. and the 
capability of the world organization to carry out further 
actions in order to settle the Sarajevo conflict. 
  Besides this, Sarajevo is not an isolated incident. There 
are other cities in Bosnia which have been besieged not only by 
the Serbs, but also by the Moslems and Croats. That is why 
while resolving the Bosnian problem, all politicians should also 
take into consideration its complexity and diversity, Voigt 
noted. 
  Replying to a question asked by this correspondent, the 
Bundestag member expressed an understanding of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry's position. I share the apprehensions of 
Russian diplomats regarding the use of military means in order 
to resolve the problem, Voigt said. Like them, I also think 
that the use of force will lead to a further escalation of 
violence. Difference of opinions exist in the assessment of the 
situation, which has emerged after the declaration of the 
ultimatum, he emphasised. Now the U.N. and the North Atlantic 
Union should seek its implementation, so as to maintain the 
convincingness [as received] of its policy and capability in the 
future, he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 12 Feb -- "Our position on the Bosnian 
settlement is absolutely clear, it was defined by the president 
of the Russian Federation," Andrey Kozyrev, minister of foreign 
affairs of Russia, said in conversation with journalists in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation today. 
The Security Council, the United Nations should take additional 
measures to guarantee safe areas in Bosnia, including, 
naturally, Sarajevo, and "exclude the possiblity of continuous 
cease-fire violations in the region," the minister said. 
  If there are exchanges of fire, attacks on places where UN 
forces are deployed, where they are carrying out their tasks, 
the command of UN forces appeals to the organization's secretary 
general who, after a vote in the Security Council, makes the 
appropriate decisions on supporting them, including aerial 
support, that is, on the possibility of launching an air strike 
to defend the UN contingent in Bosnia, the Russian minister 
continued. 
  "Our position is immutable," Andrey Kozyrev stressed. It's 
another matter, he noted, whether such military support needs to 
be 'obtained' in every specific case, at every specific moment. 
This question still remains open. 
  But Russia does not exclude aerial support in principle, 
since it is provided for directly in the Security Council 
resolution, which Moscow voted for. 
  Three weeks ago, the Russian side put forward the proposal 
to 
reinforce safe areas and to take additional measures, the 
minister recalled. "Unfortunately, it took the tragedy at 
Sarajevo market (I want to express special gratitude to CNN, 
thanks to whom the world learned of the horror) for our partners 
to be concerned about reinforcing safe areas, for the United 
Nations, the Security Council, the UN forces to step up their 
participation in resolving the problem," he noted. "I want to 
reiterate that an air strike is not excluded in principle, but 
for that to happen, the UN forces on the spot should raise the 
specific question, on a specific situation, and the UN secretary 
general will make a decision in coordination with the members of 
the Security Council." 
  Speaking of the proposals by the ministers of foreign 
affairs 
of France and Germany for Russia to join in the settlement plan, 
Andrey Kozyrev said that these proposals were the basis of the 
plan of the European Union. This document contains many 
elements which were discussed by the minister of foreign affairs 
of the Russian Federation and Klaus Kinkel, and which Vitaliy 
Churkin, Lord Owen and Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the London 
conference on the former Yugoslavia, are working on now. The 
United States has now put forward its proposals for seeking a 
peaceful settlement. 
  As far as the NATO ultimatum is concerned, the minister 
noted, this decision by NATO accords with the Security Council 
resolution, the part which provides for involving individual 
states or regional organizations (in this instance, NATO) in 
aerial support, if the UN command on the spot appeals for help 
to defend its personnel. "There is no point in joining this," 
Andrey Kozyrev thinks, "but we said immediately that the NATO 
decision contains elements which the Security Council resolution 
does not spell out, at least clearly." Heavy artillery is not 
enumerated, nor are the UN forces' functions to take heavy arms 
under control, while this is mentioned in the text of the NATO 
decision. 
  We think, the minister continued, that the decision on the 
UN 
forces should be made by the UN Security Council. And the 
letter by the organization's secretary general says that the 
United Nations will instruct its forces to carry out certain 
functions, and NATO's proposal to defend these forces accords 
with this. 
  The letter says that the UN mandate must be clarified. The 
minister recalled that he wrote two letters to the UN secretary 
general on these questions even before the UN ultimatum on the 
need to reinforce the functions of the UN forces, to defend safe 
areas. Had it been done earlier, CNN might not have had to show 
the tragedy at the market in Sarajevo. 
  But in this case the point is not competition, or priority, 
but acting together, without any claim to the truth, to bring 
the matter of a settlement to a conclusion. 
  We all now have to work in the Security Council, the Russian 
minister said, and in Geneva on the "Sarajevo group" (of 
issues), that is, to address the problems of withdrawing heavy 
weapons and strengthening the security zone, and on guarantees, 
including, if such a specific need should arise, "perhaps, also 
carrying out air strikes." The second group of issues, he 
continued, is the actual Bosnian settlement. 
  Speaking of Russia's position on the Bosnian settlement, 
Andrey Kozyrev pointed out that the essence of the problem lay 
in the fact that Bosnia will have to be divided, while 
preserving the framework of a single state, into parts that are 
quite independent according to the ethnic principle. There are 
various options for division, he said. One of them is the 
well-known Vance-Owen plan, now there is another -- simpler and 
easier. 
  The point is that Russia and the European Union have 
elaborated a plan which determines the division of Bosnian 
territory between the three sides. We are pressing these sides 
to agree to a compromise in solving territorial questions. 
Until recently the United States did not join us, the minister 
said, it did not give us full support, displaying restraint in 
this matter. But now Washington supports the plan and is 
pressing all three sides in the conflict to agree to a 
compromise. "In the main we have been working with the Serbian 
side," Andrey Kozyrev said, and Germany with the Croatian, and 
there was a kind of "missing link" -- the Muslim side. Maybe 
the United States could exert a certain pressure and work with 
the Bosnian Government. This is why, the minister believes, it 
is good news that Washington is joining the efforts of the 
European Union and Russia in trying to reach agreement. 
  "As concerns the Russian side," Andrey Kozyrev said, "we 
will 
continue what we were doing before -- cooperating with the 
European Union and the United States in seeking a peace 
settlement in Bosnia." 
  Talk about air strikes is leading some representatives of 
the 
Bosnian sides to be tempted temporarily to postpone making a 
decision on a settlement, and to direct all attention to the 
problem of air strikes, the Russian minister stressed. 
Unfortunately, this talk is stimulating some people in Serbia 
itself, since they understand that in military terms such air 
strikes will be quite limited, but in moral terms it frees their 
hands for various kinds of military campaigns and actions. 
  The Russian minister said in conclusion that for the defense 
of UN forces "air strikes may be used, if the UN forces 
themselves ask for this, as it must not be allowed for 
peacekeeping forces to be left defenseless, and not only in 
Bosnia, but also in Somalia, Abkhazia and other places. This is 
why we are taking such a cautious attitude toward the idea of 
air strikes, as this distracts world attention from the search 
for a political settlement in Bosnia."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, 13 Feb -- Slobodan Milosevic, president of 
Serbia, received Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the president 
of Russia and deputy minister of foreign affairs of the Russian 
Federation, today. Ways of stopping the civil war in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and achieving a political solution of the crisis 
were discussed during the meeting. In this connection, the 
common opinion was expressed that the defusing of the situation 
in and around Sarajevo would be an important contribution to 
resolving this task. This would help remove the danger of 
foreign military intervention and the escalation of military 
actions fraught with serious consequences for peace and 
stability in the whole region. It was pointed out during the 
conversation that the recent decision by NATO on the possibility 
of air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions would damage the 
Bosnian talks' process. Both sides stressed that a political 
framework for the Bosnian settlement is the only sensible path 
to peace and stability in this region and there is no 
alternative to this path. 
  At a meeting with Russian journalists in Belgrade, Vitaliy 
Churkin stressed that the main task of his new trip to the 
republics of the former Yugoslavia is to prevent strikes against 
the positions of the Bosnian Serbs. With this objective, he 
intends in the next few days to visit Zagreb, and also the 
Serbian and, possibly, Muslim parts of Sarajevo in order to 
study the situation there first hand and to find out the 
opinions of the UN forces command. The Russian diplomat 
pointed, in particular, to the need to learn such an important 
detail as the deployment of the sides' heavy artillery. NATO, he 
said, is demanding the withdrawal of the Serbian artillery 20 km 
from Sarajevo, but the Serbian side states it has reached an 
agreement with Yasusi Akashi, the UN Secretary General's special 
envoy in the former Yugoslavia, not on a withdrawal but on the 
transfer of its artillery over to the control of the "blue 
berets". The Serbian side says that the reason for this is that 
otherwise it may be left without means of self-defense, which 
may be used to their advantage by the Muslim formations who are 
in larger numbers. 
  It is also necessary to raise the question of stepping up 
the 
work of the international commission to investigate the recent 
tragic incident in the Sarajevan market, V. Churkin went on. It 
is an unacceptable situation where everyone is outraged, but 
emotions hold sway over the facts and no one knows who is 
responsible for the mass deaths of innocent civilians. In his 
opinion, if it can be established that it was not the Serbs who 
did this, then this may affect progress in the negotiations 
process, since the Muslim side would have to go back on its 
extreme demands and come to an understanding. 
  The Russian diplomat welcomed a greater degree of 
involvement 
of the United States in the process of the Bosnian settlement, 
because a major lever has thus appeared for putting pressure on 
the Muslim side and drawing it towards peace accords. He also 
advocated a realistic approach in terms of not asking too much 
from the Serb side. Bosnian Serbs have already made major 
concessions, agreeing first to ensure that Muslims have 30 
percent, now put up to 33.3 percent of the territory of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, he said. They have no more flexibility left, 
and only a new, more acceptable for all sides "geometry of the 
territorial division" can be now discussed. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS whether Russia possesses at present 
political implements that would stop NATO from strikes against 
positions of Bosnian Serbs, Vitaliy Churkin said that the West 
is attempting to interpret in its own way texts of previous 
resolutions of the UN Security Council on Bosnia, claiming that 
NATO can act without a further discussion in the Security 
Council. We believe that such a crucial step must be discussed. 
In fact, the West began acting through NATO, rather than 
through the UN, fearing a Russian veto. I have an impression, 
however, that nobody has an interest in seeing the situation 
aggravated, and a peaceful settlement will be reached, the 
Russian diplomat said in conclusion.

  [Text] Vitaliy Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister and 
presidential special envoy, has called the last round of Geneva 
talks on Bosnia "the most unsuccessful" one, but the negotiating 
process will continue, and Russia diplomacy intends to play an 
active role in this, he stated in an interview with RIA. 
  On Tuesday [15 February], the Bosnian problem will be 
discussed at talks in Moscow with British Prime Minister John 
Major, and on Friday Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
will have a meeting in Athens with his counterparts from Greece, 
Germany, and Belgium, and then possibly with representatives of 
the United States. 
  Vitaliy Churkin himself had talks in Belgrade today with 
President of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic. He will have a meeting 
in Skopje tomorrow with President of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov, 
and will then leave for Sarajevo to assess the situation and 
talk with the Bosnian leadership.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Anin report under the "Opinion" rubric: "Bosnian </F>
Crisis: What Should Russia Do? Why Could the U.S. President 
Not Contact the Russian One?"] 
  [Text] Bill Clinton said that he could not reach Boris 
Yeltsin due to technical reasons to discuss the latest turn in 
the Bosnian crisis. This may mean two things: either the 
Russian president is on his deathbed, or he has nothing to say 
to his American counterpart. 
  I do not believe that Boris Yeltsin's announced slight 
indisposition has even the slightest bearing on his loss of 
speech. Hence, the "technical reasons" must be related to the 
proposed NATO air strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia. What 
matters is not so much that the Russian president cannot say 
"Yes" in principle, but a bombing strike in response to his "No" 
would have greatly damaged the Russian leader's prestige. The 
consequences of a punitive solution to the Bosnian crisis could 
be incomparably more serious that moral damage, even if it was 
done to a head of state. 
  One may guess as long as one wishes about the peacemaking 
potential of the NATO action. In what may turn out to be its 
immediate effect, however, the Serbs may start hunting the UN 
"blue helmets" and start out-and-out guerrilla warfare. Then 
the "Atlantists'" next step would be to bring ground troops into 
the region, troops that are capable, unlike a peacekeeping 
contingent, of carrying out full-blown combat operations. In 
practice this will amount to the West's war to eliminate the 
Serb people. Neither more nor less -- simply because the Serbs 
do not surrender (there has not been such a thing in their 
history) and, having earned a reputation of a guerrilla people, 
they would fight to the last man. 
  And then Russia will have to make a choice. Either, staying 
neutral, to take part in the Serb-NATO war at the diplomatic 
level, or to stand up for the underdog and send its troops 
there. This will be a new big war in which Russia will be 
effectively left alone against all, because in Bosnia the 
interests of the "Atlantists" and the Muslim world coincide 
surprisingly. This third world war would bring about what did 
not happen in World War I and what was about to happen in World 
War II: Russia would be crushed and, maybe, would cease to 
exist as a state. Its territory would be divided into 
protectorates, the borders of the North and the South would 
close, and the ruined Orthodox civilization would no longer be 
there to prevent the two sides from warring, trading, and simply 
having direct contacts. 
  There will be no World War III if Russia does not stand up 
for the Serbs should something happen. To do so, in order to 
counter the pressure of radicals from among pro-Serb nationalist 
patriots, the Kremlin will need only to organize a national 
referendum. "Pan- Slavism" was a new word for those who lived a 
century and a half ago. For the current generation of the 
Empire's heirs it is completely unfamiliar. So the results of a 
referendum featuring a question like "Do the Russians want war?" 
can be foretold right now. 
  By doing so Russia will retain its statehood, but its 
authority in the world would be measured in negative values from 
that very instance with all the ensuing consequences. After 
all, nuclear weapons themselves do not guarantee great power 
status to a state. Without an ideological underpinning an A-bomb 
is nothing more than a box of matches in the hands of a foolish 
kid. The ideological underpinning, however, is the so-called 
postponed threat factor, which is the foundation of modern 
military-political rivalry. How strong this factor is as an 
indicator of the strength of one world leader or another can be 
revealed in a specific crisis situation -- those leaders, once 
broken, would be dismissed as outsiders. 
  So the position of President Yeltsin, who has a slight 
indisposition in Zavidovo, is unenviable: Every alley is a dead 
end. He will probably still talk to Clinton, but there is just 
one hope left -- that NATO will back away from its decision and, 
contenting itself with effectively meaningless concessions from 
the Serbs, will not bomb them after all.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin article: "Clinton Was Unable To Contact </F>
Yeltsin for Two Days. The Bosnian Crisis Has Thrown Moscow Into 
Confusion"] 
  [Text] A serious conflict is brewing between Moscow and 
the West for the first time in 10 years. By rejecting the NATO 
ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs and demanding the urgent 
convening of the UN Security Council, Russia is running the risk 
of ending up in international isolation. 
  Of the European states only Greece -- the Serbs' traditional 
ally -- has displayed full solidarity with Moscow's position. 
The distribution of forces in the Security Council is also 
extremely unfavorable: In the event of a vote 13 out of the 15 
Security Council members will support the NATO line, China will 
abstain, and only Moscow will come out against. 
  Although it does not look as if there will even be a vote. 
The United States and its allies disagree with Russia's opinion 
that a special Security Council resolution is necessary to carry 
out air operations in Bosnia. Washington, Paris, and London 
believe that there have been quite enough previous UN decisions, 
which Russia, incidentally, could have blocked but did not. 
  Thus Moscow is losing the only real prospect of preventing 
the implementation of the NATO ultimatum. The further 
development of events no longer depends on the will of the 
Kremlin. Whatever bellicose calls are made from the Duma 
rostrum, Yeltsin cannot fail to realize that Moscow's potential 
is limited. 
  Recently, it is true, certain politicians (and not just of a 
Zyuganov-Zhirinovskiy orientation -- Sergey Shakhray, for 
example) have discoursed in earnest on the possibility of World 
War III in the event of a strike against the Bosnian Serbs. You 
really have to possess a rich imagination to imagine that the 
Russian Government would agree to plunge its people into a 
nuclear conflict so that Radovan Karadzic's soldiers can calmly 
lay siege to Sarajevo, stationing their guns 5 km from the city 
center rather than 20 km away, as the NATO countries demand! 
  In supporting the Serbs, the Russian authorities are guided 
chiefly by emotions and the logic of the internal political 
struggle: Moscow has no serious economic or political interests 
in Serbia. The possibility cannot be ruled out that Yeltsin and 
Kozyrev arrived at the conclusion that readiness to resort to a 
diplomatic conflict with the West would strengthen their 
positions inside the country. But here it is important not to 
cross the line where disagreements between allies (this is 
precisely what Yeltsin has recently been calling Western states) 
become an unbridgeable gulf. 
  You get the impression that the Russian president is 
searching agonizingly for this line. It was no coincidence that 
Bill Clinton was unable to get through to him by telephone for 
two days. Moscow replied hardly plausibly that it was 
"impossible to communicate with Boris Nikolayevich for technical 
reasons." Most likely Yeltsin simply was not ready to talk with 
his U.S. colleague. By going quite far in its support for the 
Serbs, the Kremlin has now been forced to resolve a very complex 
task: How to prevent a rupture with the West and, at the same 
time, save face. 
  Russian diplomacy is in disarray. Signs of a certain 
softening of the position have already appeared. Yuliy 
Vorontsov, permanent representative at the United Nations, 
unexpectedly declared that Moscow would not stand in the way of 
attempts by NATO aircraft to lift the siege of Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb -- Russia is proposing that the UN 
Security Council [UNSC] be immediately convened to examine 
practical ways for the demilitarization of Sarajevo and the 
introduction of UN administration there. This was stated at a 
briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian 
Federation Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department. 
  He said that "Russia proposes that this session be made open 
for the participation in the discussion not only of Security 
Council members but also other interested countries, especially 
those whose interests are in Bosnia and Herzegovina." 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the NATO 
Council had adopted a statement on the problem of the Bosnian 
crisis. In it the Council urged all the sides -- Serbs and 
Muslims -- to urgently place their heavy armaments in the 
Sarajevo region under UN control or to remove them from the 
area. Essentially, this is close to the position taken by 
Russia that has more than once come out with an initiative for 
the urgent demilitarization of Sarajevo and the imposition of UN 
administrative control in that city. In Grigoriy Karasin's 
opinion, such measures would be a most important step toward a 
settlement of the Bosnian conflict. 
  He expressed satisfaction that the NATO Council, like 
Russia, 
had reaffirmed its support for talks as the way to a settlement 
of the conflict in Bosnia. It is precisely this path that 
demands vigorous pressure on the part of the world community on 
all the sides involved in the conflict. 
  Unfortunately, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman 
believes, in the position of a number of NATO members one can 
sense an attempt to interpret this pressure as a unilateral 
ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs by threatening them with air 
strikes. The Russian Federation, Grigoriy Karasin stressed, 
cannot agree with this unilateral approach. 
  "We are also convinced," the Russian diplomat said, "that it 
is the Security Council that must adopt decisions on the problem 
of lifting the siege of Sarajevo," as Russia proposed two weeks 
ago. Unfortunately, Russia's proposal was not adopted. G. 
Karasin said that at the same time, this problem had been put to 
the NATO council which, as is known, has no authority to adopt 
decisions on the matter of a Bosnian settlement. The UN 
secretary general had earlier approached NATO with a proposal to 
state the alliance's readiness to use aircraft if the United 
Nations asks for it. A decision on such a request should be 
adopted by the secretary general following consultations with 
the Security Council members. This procedure, which has been 
established by the Security Council, should be rigorously 
followed, Grigoriy Karasin emphasized. 
  He noted that a few hours before the announcement of NATO's 
decision, reports had come in that the Bosnian Serbs and 
Muslims, through United Nations mediation, had reached agreement 
on a cease- fire, and had agreed on specific measures for the 
withdrawal of armaments from Sarajevo. "Hasty decisions outside 
the framework of the United Nations carry the risk of wrecking 
this encouraging process. Progress toward a settlement is 
possible only if neither side gains advantage while the 
demilitarization measures are being carried out by UN forces," 
the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.

  [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb -- The Russian Federation's Foreign 
Ministry is satisfied with the preliminary results of the 
Russian- Ukrainian talks on implementing the results of the 
January meeting between the Presidents of Russia, the United 
States, and Ukraine. This was said at a briefing today by 
Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the Department of Information 
and Press of the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  At the talks, that took place in Kiev on 8th and 9th 
February, a package of documents was agreed between the Russian 
Federation and Ukraine on measures to implement the trilateral 
Russian-U.S.- Ukrainian accords. The drafts of these documents 
will be presented for examination by the Russian Federation 
leaders and Ukraine. 
  "There are good grounds to suppose," Grigoriy Karasin 
stressed, "that after the documents are examined and confirmed 
by the leadership of Russia and Ukraine, they can become an 
undoubted benefit for both states and for the whole of the 
international community." 
  Russia's state delegation at the talks on 8th and 9th 
February in Kiev was headed by Yuriy Dubinin, roving ambassador 
of the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Ukrainian delegation was 
headed by Valeriy Shmarov, deputy prime minister of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Report by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoi and others] 
  [Text] A spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, Grigoriy 
Karasin, said at Thursday's [10 February] briefing in Moscow 
that the head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, in his 
capacity of chairman of the CIS Foreign Ministers Council, had 
requested the UN Secretary-General to include in the agenda of 
the 48th General Assembly session the issue of granting the CIS 
the status of observer at the General Assembly. 
  According to Kozyrev, the status of observer at the General 
Assembly would make it possible to strengthen interaction 
between the CIS and the UN in real terms. 
  Karasin also said that UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali will be on a visit in Moscow between the 1st and 
the 5th of April. 
  During his visit he will discuss the ways to strengthen 
cooperation between Russia and the UN with a view to raising the 
effectiveness of the UN, and building up its potential in 
securing peace, stability and international cooperation, Karasin 
said. 
  Sensations or "historic breakthroughs" can hardly be 
expected 
from the official visit to Russia to be paid by the British 
Prime Minister, John Major, on February 14-16, Karasin said. 
  According to him, Moscow believes that the talks between 
President Boris Yeltsin and John Major will consolidate Russian- 
British partnership. 
  Britain is one of the Western powers particularly active and 
consistent in their efforts to support economic reforms in 
Russia, promote free-market relations and implement extensive 
social programs in our country, Karasin noted. 
  Besides Moscow, the British prime minister will visit Nizhny 
Novgorod, a major center of reviving Russian entrepreneurship, 
he said. 
  Karasin also said that Russia's Foreign Ministry prepared 
and 
submitted to the State Duma a list of international treaties and 
agreements to be ratified by Russia's Federal Assembly. 
  International agreements and treaties to be given top 
priority in the process of ratification are singled out in the 
105-point list. They include documents regulating Russia's 
relations with such countries as Austria, Azerbaijan, Armenia, 
Belarus, Germany, Greece, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Korea, 
Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Slovakia, the USA, 
Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Czechia, Estonia, and others. "Some of 
the documents included in the list concern disarmament issues 
(chemical arms, START-II), confidence-building measures (open 
skies), and Russia's joining a number of international 
conventions and protocols," Karasin said. 
  According to him, the Foreign Ministry has also submitted to 
the State Duma its proposals on working out over 20 draft bills, 
including those on international agreements, on diplomatic 
service, on procedures connected with Russia's participation in 
peacekeeping activity sponsored by the UN, the CSCE, and the 
CIS, and others.

  [Text] The POSTFACTUM Agency reports that Yuriy Meshkov, 
the recently elected president of the Republic of Crimea, 
arrived in Moscow last night. The president of Crimea is being 
accompanied on his trip by a very small group of his closest 
aides and advisers. 
  The program for his visit includes meetings and talks with 
deputies in Russia's State Duma and with individual members of 
the Russian Government. The president of Crimea's visit to 
Moscow is not an official one: In the words of one of Yuriy 
Meshkov's closest aides, this is not really a visit, rather a 
trip to Moscow by the president of Crimea to build bridges 
toward economic cooperation between Russia and Crimea. How long 
Yuriy Meshkov spends in Moscow will be determined by how the 
talks and meetings with Russia's leaders go.

<F P=106> [Interview with Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov with </F>
moderator Andrey Skryabin, correspondent Lyudimila Olegovna 
Telen of MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, and Mayak commentator Yuliy 
Semenov in Moscow; from the "Live Dialogue" program--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Skryabin] Hello, esteemed viewers. The guest 
on "Live Dialogue" today is Yuriy Aleksandrovich Meshkov, the 
first president of the Republic of Crimea. May I congratulate 
you on your election and wish you all the best. 
  [Meshkov] Thank you, Andrey Georgiyevich. 
  [Skryabin] I would like to introduce my colleagues working 
with me in the studio today. They are Lyudmila Olegovna Telen, 
commentator for the MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI newspaper, and Yuliy 
Aleksandrovich Semenov, commentator for Mayak radio. I am 
Andrey Skryabin, commentator for Ostankino television. [passage 
omitted] 
  Your questions, please. 
  [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, you have become the first 
president of the Republic of Crimea within the composition of 
Ukraine. All the same, however, everyone knows that the 
disputes surrounding Crimea's status have not yet abated. They 
were especially acute during your electoral campaign. Every 
candidate running for this top post had his own special view on 
the status of Crimea. How do you see this status, and how do 
you intend to act? 
  [Meshkov] The status is defined in the Constitution of the 
Republic of Crimea--the Constitution that was adopted on 6 May 
1992. Then, as you know, there were some changes in the contents 
of the Constitution. There were some illegal changes, but the 
genuine and first Constitution of the Republic of Crimea says 
that mutual relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine 
are built on the basis of treaties and agreements. These are 
reasonable, normal, and civilized relations between republics. 
  [Skryabin] Continuing from what you have just said, there is 
persistent talk in the media--in Ukraine, in particular--about a 
federal and territorial organization of Ukraine. How do you see 
the possibility of such a federal organization of Ukraine and, 
accordingly, of Crimea being part of the federation? 
  [Meshkov] Well, first of all, this is economically based, 
and there is an economic need for the federalization of Ukraine. 
Initially, the idea was rejected completely, but now it is 
winning support in Ukraine. I expect the Kuchma-Grinev bloc 
will use a similar proposal to reorganize the state. The bloc 
is gathering strength, and obviously there will be a chance to 
implement this proposed federal organization of Ukraine. 
  [Telen] Do you expect that, in that case, some sort of 
federation treaty would be signed within a Ukrainian framework, 
or would the relations between Kiev and the future territories 
be built on the basis of some sort of bilateral relations? 
  [Meshkov] Well, that is the Ukrainian leadership's problem, 
and the way the question is solved will depend on which forces 
win at the elections for the Supreme Soviet and then for the 
Ukrainian president. 
  [Semenov] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, I would like to join my 
question with a comment by viewer Mukhamed Minachev, a 
Muscovite. [passage omitted] 
  He makes an interesting remark: It is one thing to be a 
candidate and to make biting statements during an election 
campaign, and another when you become an elected president who 
has to make responsible decisions. People following events 
closely have noted a certain change in the nuances of your 
position. For instance, your electoral campaign focused on the 
idea of Crimean independence. How do you think this idea looks 
now, and how can it be implemented? [passage omitted] 
  [Meshkov] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, the question already 
contains 
part of the answer: Naturally, I have a lesser degree of freedom 
now. It is sad but true that an official has less opportunity 
to make frank--or if you like, sharp--statements. They have to 
correspond more to the real political situation, and they must 
take into account anticipated changes in the situation. This 
responsibility leaves less room for maneuver. That does not 
mean, however, renouncing declared principles and aims. The 
methods and forms of implementation may undergo certain changes, 
but not the content. [passage omitted] 
  [Telen] All the same, let us come back to the referendum 
question. What is your attitude toward this idea? How 
realistic is its implementation? And, perhaps the most acute 
question, what does Crimean independence mean if the question is 
put to a referendum? 
  [Meshkov] It is as realistic as the implementation of a law 
on a referendum is realistic. The question of independence is 
not being posed at the level of independence as separation. It 
is based on a directly opposite idea--the separation or tendency 
toward separation of the Ukrainian economy from the Russian 
economy. We stated quite emphatically right from the outset 
that this would be ruinous for Ukraine. Reality has more than 
confirmed even our most gloomy fears. What is now happening to 
the Ukrainian economy is hard to bear for both the people of 
Ukraine and the people of Crimea. 
  The question is formulated as follows, however: Are you in 
favor of an independent Republic of Crimea in union with other 
states? The main point in holding a referendum and implementing 
its results lies precisely in the words at the end of the 
question: in union with other states. That is to say, this is 
our natural and understandable economically-based desire to be 
united with the economic zone of Russia and the CIS countries 
and Ukraine too, but on a fundamentally new basis, which takes 
the interests of the Republic of Crimea into account to a 
maximum degree. 
  [Skryabin] Thank you, and my colleagues -- and, Yuriy 
Aleksandrovich, permit me to read out a number of questions, 
which have come from television viewers and I have put together. 
  [Meshkov] Please do, I am ready. 
  [Skryabin] Georgiy Alekseyevich Tukhmanov from Moscow asks 
whether you are not worried about finding yourself in the 
situation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh 
and that that is where it started too -- if Karabakh was given 
to Azerbaijan in 1921 then the Crimea was given by Khrushchev in 
1956. Please respond to this analogy put to you respectfully 
from the Muscovite Tukhmanov -- this is his question. 
  [Meshkov] Dear Georgiy Alekseyevich, my reply to you will be 
as follows: Unfortunately, you have been affected by a campaign 
around Crimea that is on the conscience of certain people 
working in the media, a campaign to compare the situation in 
Crimea with the hot spots on the territory of the former USSR. 
  There are no grounds whatsoever for this. Thank God, there 
are no preconditions whatsoever for even the possibility of such 
a situation evolving in Crimea. I am sure now, especially now, 
when the people of Crimea expressed their will unanimously -- 
you know the figures, of course, what powerful support the first 
Crimean president and his program received -- this rules out any 
precondition whatsoever for this inside Crimea. 
  As for outside, there is a danger of some forces outside 
Crimea imposing some instability on us and making attempts to 
organize confrontation. But these forces are so insignificant 
and odious that one is not really seriously afraid of them. 
  So, Georgiy Alekseyevich, you can plan your next vacation in 
Crimea. I invite you and your family to Crimea which is and 
will be peaceful, completely peaceful. 
  [Skryabin] That is if you have enough money. 
  [Meshkov] Well, that is another matter. 
  [Skryabin] Yuriy Alekseyevich Tkachenko gives his phone 
number: How will you form your team? I have experience of 
high-level work in the state administration, I am a Crimean, I 
am 42-years-old, and am ready to work with you. So how will 
you form your team? 
  [Meshkov] I can tell Yuriy Alekseyevich and everyone else 
that the main criterion of selection is professionalism. My 
political opponents are stating that the Russia block that I 
represented in the presidential elections does not have its own 
team. Now it can be said completely calmly: There is a team. 
Authoritative experts, well-known in Russia, have agreed to 
take part in the program of emergence of the economy of the 
Crimea. And of course, your proposal and the proposals of all 
those who wish the Crimean Republic well, and who have the 
forces and intention to carry out their potential in the Crimea, 
are in the surprising and unique situation now when everyone can 
give real help and support. We are ready to accept this help 
and place it in any organization -- the government, 
administration of the president -- wherever you can show 
yourself to your maximum. And thank you for your offer. 
  [Telen] Could I continue a bit? You said that talks were 
already being conducted with some people about joining your team 
and you said these were well-known names. Could you name them? 
  [Meshkov] You know, I have an urge to present everything 
literally and share my joy above all with my compatriots in the 
Crimean Republic and with my compatriots in Russia. But allow 
me nevertheless, to restrain myself a little. My Moscow program 
is not yet exhausted and when it is entirely fulfilled I will be 
able to answer that question. 
  [Simenov] I think our conversation started rather rosily. I 
hear you saying that the Crimea is so quiet, come and visit us 
and so on. But surely you have a crime problem that has in fact 
grown into a problem of terrorism... 
  [Meshkov, interrupting] Politic... 
  [Simenov, continuing]...even political terrorism, and if you 
will excuse me, even you were hunted by such terrorists. What 
can you say about this and how do you intend to resolve this 
problem? 
  [Meshkov] Yuliy Aleksandrovich, the fact is the hunters and 
the prey have swapped places since 30 January. And there is 
every reason, and I can with full responsibility assure all 
Russians, that by the start of the spa season everything in this 
sense will be quiet. 
  It was not a crime problem. It was not a political terrorism 
problem. It was a problem of power -- fragile, helpless, 
incapable of reacting to change in the surrounding situation. 
They were people who were always placed in the hierarchical 
pyramid of power where they were sheltered from above and 
carried out everything from above, taking it down to the lower 
strata of the pyramid, but who never took and could not take 
responsibility upon themselves and could not react to change in 
the surrounding situation. They could not do anything with that 
avalanche of crime and outburst of political terrorism which 
yes, unfortunately, did take place in the Crimea. All that will 
be stopped by the toughest methods, well of course in the 
framework of... 
  [Simenov, interrupting] They were professionals acting on 
political orders? 
  [Meshkov] Yes. 
  [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, our paper wrote widely about 
the murder of Andrey Lazebnikov, the Black Sea Fleet press 
secretary. Naturally, MOSCOW NEWS readers are interested now in 
how the investigation of this crime is progressing. It was 
specifically this murder that was evidence of the terror that 
existed, as you said, in the Crimea. Could you give a more 
detailed account of it? 
  [Meshkov] It is premature to give the details because 
I--restricted by my professional limitations, one could 
say--cannot talk extensively about an investigation that has not 
been concluded. This is the more so because the results of an 
investigation are summed up by the court, as you know. I can 
say, however, that there is no doubt that it was a political 
act. There is no doubt that professionals were involved, and 
attempts were made during the initial stages of the 
investigation to prevent the officials of the Russian federal 
services from investigating this case. I can assure you, 
however, that the presidential administration, and now the state 
bodies of the republic of Crimea, will give the maximum 
necessary assistance in investigating, searching for, and 
punishing the criminals that organized and carried out this act 
of political terror. 
  [Skryabin] I see, Lyudmila, that you have a large set of 
questions on the economy. Nonetheless, this set of questions 
from our television viewers is, evidently, a considerably larger 
one, as I can show you now. These are questions connected with 
the problem of the Tatars, the Crimean Tatars. So I will take 
the liberty of reading out several questions on behalf of the 
television viewers that I will ask you to answer. 
  Idrisov, from the town of Yevpatoriya: Are you going to 
apologize to the Crimean Tatars for the ethnic genocide carried 
out by the hand of Moscow in May 1944, as Mr. Kohl has done to 
the world concerning the Germans? Do you recognize the right of 
the Crimean Tatars to self-determination? The Crimea is 
multinational, like Moscow, Ufa, and Kazan, but each nation has 
a state, a motherland. For the Crimean Tatars, it is the Crimea. 
  Arkadiy Nikolayevich Semenov asks what your attitude is 
toward the slogans that can be seen in the Crimea, such as: No 
to the totalization of the Crimea! Do you not think that this 
is a fascist slogan? 
  Ernest Kudusov: Does Mr. Meshkov intend to strive to gain 
the 
acknowledgement and respect of the indigenous contingent of the 
Crimean population? It voted against him. If that is his 
intention, what steps is he going to take? What solution do you 
envisage for the settlement of the Crimean Tatar problem? 
  Well, there are many other questions. Galina Romanovna 
Batskevich: What does the Crimean president think about 
relations with a small, indigenous Crimean people--the Crimean 
Tatars? 
  Ismet Khalyukovich Sheykh-Zade asks how you envisage 
relations with the indigenous people? Well, and so on. Is 
there a program for the return of the Crimean Tatars? There are 
many, many more questions. 
  [Meshkov] it is an extremely serious question because it 
touches upon the most painful and sensitive--and widely 
exploited-- ethnic feelings. I can say to Mr. Idrisov that 
neither Moscow, nor I, as Crimean president, nor the citizens of 
the Republic of Crimea have any reasons for apologizing for 
those illegal measures in which he sees the hand of Moscow. It 
was not the hand of Moscow, but an absolutely concrete policy of 
the thing that we call a totalitarian regime. The situation has 
no comparison with the situation of Mr. Kohl and the German 
people. 
  The Republic of Crimea is a multinational republic. There is 
no reason to single out or isolate any ethnic group on any 
grounds. We would never have achieved peace and accord in the 
Crimea. We have achieved these, and the president and the 
state authorities will make every effort to preserve this 
national peace. The basis for it is an equal attitude toward 
all the citizens of the Republic of Crimea, without exceptions. 
There can be no question of us singling out an ethnic group 
and, moreover, giving it political powers on the grounds of its 
ethnicity. I have not seen the slogan--No to the Tatarization 
of the Crimea--in all the time that I have lived in the Crimea 
on any wall or any poster, and I travel all the time. So let 
Mr. Semenov have this slogan that he cited on his conscience. 
  As for the claim that the Crimean Tatars unanimously voted 
against the Russia bloc representative and against me as a 
candidate for the presidency of the Republic of Crimea, this is 
an erroneous statement and does not correspond to the facts. 
Moreover, I can say that numerous branches and groups within 
the Crimean Tatars' national movement openly proclaimed their 
support. They were openly saying that they supported my 
candidacy. At some polling stations, thousands out of a 
2,000-strong [figure as heard] electorate, thousands of Crimean 
Tatars voted for me. This is a problem of relations between the 
powers that have gone and the bosses of the Crimean national 
movement and the leadership of the Majles. That is their 
problem. It is not a problem of relations between the president 
and the Crimean Tatars, citizens of the republic of Crimea. 
  This is because in the presidential administration--and I 
can 
say this--key posts are occupied by Professor Memetov, whom I 
deeply respect and who is in charge of a very important part of 
the administration. (Anife Situmer Kyzy Ilyasova) is in one of 
the key posts. This is normal and should be so, and it is. As 
to what future decision will be made and whether there is a 
program, I, in particular, demanded that such a program should 
be adopted. I demanded that the process of the return of the 
Crimean Tatars should be based on an officially adopted program. 
It was not adopted, and with the exception of sops that were 
even insulting to some extent-- nothing was implemented. 
  I have said before and I can confirm now that the state 
must compensate for damage it inflicted on its citizens and for 
the damage it inflicted on the citizens of the Republic of 
Crimea--on the Crimean Tatar nationality, in particular. This 
is one of the topics at the talks I am having here in Moscow. I 
do not know yet. I cannot tell you what the final result will 
be. I have asked, however, for 50 billion rubles for this 
program. 
  [Skryabin] Thank you. 
  [Semenov] Lets talk about the economy. One of your slogans 
during the election campaign was the wish to set up direct 
economic ties with Russia, to enrich them, and maybe even to 
join the ruble zone. How do you envisage this? In particular, 
do you see the ruble as a national monetary unit? And what 
about the karbovanets? Do you understand what can happen to the 
Crimean financial market if both currencies are used 
simultaneously? And, in general, what is the general concept, 
at least the main points? 
  [Meshkov] I understand, Yuliy Aleksandrovich. I gather from 
your question that you are more concerned, not with what will 
happen to the ruble, but with what will happen to the 
karbovanets? That is nearer the truth. Well, so far they will 
circulate simultaneously. The Kiev administration and a top 
official have agreed to the circulation of the ruble in the 
Crimea. We have drawn up and prepared all that is needed for 
the implementation of the program for the ruble to be a means of 
payment in the Crimea. So the preparations can proceed 
smoothly, and I hope no political intrigues over the Crimea will 
hinder the restoration of Crimea's economy and the presence of 
the ruble in our republic. There is already a bank for this 
presence.... 
  [Semenov, interrupting] I just wanted to ask what are the 
functions of the bank? 
  [Meshkov, continuing] ... with its definite functions, the 
function of monitoring money circulation in the Crimea, the 
function of permission, i.e. the registration of banks of other 
republics on Crimean territory. With respect to the budget and 
the taxes, all 100 percent will remain in the Republic of 
Crimea. Only the joint programs of Ukraine and the Crimea will 
be financed. Such will be the first steps. 
  [Semenov] That is a precedent. 
  [Meshkov] I hope that this will help to implement the 
general 
tendencies that unite the economic space. This will happen 
inevitably. The Republic of Crimea is marching forward. 
  [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, excuse me, but I do not quite 
understand the setup for Crimea's entry into the ruble zone, 
because an accord with Kiev allowing the use of a parallel 
currency is one thing, while agreement with Russia is something 
else. After all, Russia is the center issuing the currency, and 
apparently you are counting on receiving rubles from Russia. 
  [Meshkov] Well, naturally there is nowhere else to get them, 
but we will not be obtaining them through any issues by the 
Central Bank of Russia. We will be getting them as a result of 
normal economic relations--by fulfilling orders, providing 
services to the Navy, and marketing, say, those material values 
that will be freed as a result of conversion. This will include 
the supply of our own goods and our own agricultural produce and 
also, I hope, a strong influx of tourists and what we call 
holidaymakers, with their rubles, during the holiday period in 
Crimea. 
  Indeed, everyone with cash rubles will feel very comfortable 
since the exchange relationship of the ruble to the coupon is, 
as you know, approximately at a ratio of one ruble to 30 
coupons. That is to say, all of this will help us to tackle 
this problem without holding out our hand and without 
sacrificing Russia's good relationship toward Crimea to the need 
for issuing currency and to a complication of the economic 
situation in Russia. This is all a chain of actions steadily 
bringing us back into a unified economic zone without any 
complication of the situation in Russia and without any conflict 
situations in Crimea. 
  [Skryabin] Following on from that question, what should come 
via you? 
  [Meshkov] Since the fleet is situated on the territory of 
the 
Republic of Crimea, the financing of the fleet should naturally 
be via the Republic of Crimea. [passage omitted] 
  I regard it as my primary duty to defend the legal rights 
and 
interests of the citizens of the Republic of Crimea, and what 
strength I have will be put into carrying out that defense, 
above all, in the economic sphere. [passage omitted] 
  [Telen] All the same, let me go back to the ruble zone. Have 
any, at least preliminary, talks been held with the Russian 
leadership, with the Russian Government, with the financial 
circles and the Russian bank on the introduction of the ruble in 
Crimea? 
  [Meshkov] This program has been talked about with 
specialists 
of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Crimea. The specialists 
have reached agreement and have devised a unified and 
streamlined program. It will be implemented with the help of 
Ukrainian specialists and Ukrainian banks and by relying on the 
Ukrainian economy. Of course, it will be done primarily by 
relying on Russian banks--by that, I mean commercial banks--and 
on relations with the Russian economy and Russian specialists. 
  [Telen] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, I am sorry to be so 
persistent, 
but are these specialists or officials? 
  [Meshkov] Lyudmila Olegovna. Until we have finally decided 
the press release and the communique on the results of the 
talks, I (?cannot) answer this question. I realize that it 
worries and concerns you. It worries the citizens of Crimea 
just as much; however, I can reassure them. The fact is that 
results have been achieved that exceed the hopes with which I 
went to Moscow. [passage omitted] 
  [Semenov] How do you see the future of the fleet? And, in 
your idea of the structure of Crimea, do you think there is a 
special role or special status for Sevastopol? [passage omitted] 
  [Meshkov] Regarding the problem of the fleet, I was 
reproached for saying one thing before the election campaign and 
subsequently making a completely contrary statement. My remarks 
to the effect that the problem of the fleet had been resolved by 
the presidents were cited. The problem of the fleet has indeed 
been resolved by the presidents. I mean the Massandra 
agreement. However, it has to be implemented. If the principle 
of international law that treaties should be implemented exists 
and is recognized by the Ukrainian leadership, then this treaty, 
this agreement, should be implemented. It envisages a single 
Russian Black Sea Fleet. 
  This fully reflects the interests of the Republic of Crimea. 
Our naval seamen--we will not divide them--will have the 
maximum protection that is provided for citizens of the Republic 
of Crimea. Regarding the Sevastopol permit system, it is 
unnatural, abnormal. We will, of course, be removing this 
abnormality. 
  The issue of dual citizenship is urgent and will be resolved 
by a law on dual citizenship. This, of course, requires 
coordination with the Russian Federation. Russia put forward an 
initiative long ago. The Ukrainian Government has a draft on 
dual citizenship proposed by Russia, but it has been put on the 
back burner and has not yet been examined. I think the Republic 
of Ukraine could resolve the citizenship problem more quickly. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Telen] Is the Crimean leadership willing to some extent to 
share the burden of some of these problems with Russia? Does 
Crimea have the financial resources? 
  [Meshkov] Regarding financial resources, let me say 
straightaway that it does not. As for sharing the burden of 
maintaining the Black Sea Fleet, yes, it will. Crimea is as 
committed as possible to this because the presence of the Black 
Sea Fleet in the Republic of Crimea is a guarantee, a long-term 
guarantee, of stability and peace in Crimea. [passage omitted] 
  [Telen] Some of Russia's nationalistic organizations see 
Crimea as a base for themselves and a chance to apply their 
forces. How dangerous is Russian nationalism to Crimea? 
  [Meshkov] Fortunately--and thank God that I live in Crimea 
and that the citizens of our republic also live in Crimea--a 
thousand years of Crimean history prove that Crimea has never 
had what is described as interethnic strife. All waves of 
nationalism, irrespective of where they came from, subsided on 
approach to Crimea. They found no support here. The 
nationalistic forces can count on no support at all, or on the 
support of 3 percent of the people at the most, if the 
circumstances are extremely favorable. There is no nationalism 
in Crimea, and there never will be, God forbid. 
  [Skryabin] Can I ask you the last question? It is not a very 
serious question, but I think it might be of interest to many 
people. During the August 1991 putsch, you were the first 
person who tried to get into Gorbachev's dacha. As far as I 
know, they simply did not let the future Crimean president in. 
  [Meshkov] They even arrested me. 
  [Skryabin] Yes, arrested you. What is happening now to 
Gorbachev's dacha? Presidents seem to be superstitious, and 
nobody wants to move in. Nonetheless, something is going to be 
done with it, right? 
  [Meshkov] Nobody, including me, wants to live in Mikhail 
Sergeyevich's dacha. I really tried to help him against the 
will of our Supreme Soviet and its head. Moreover, I even 
resorted to open insults. I told them: It is your general 
secretary there, after all. Forget that you are officials and 
act as communists at least. You must change the situation, and 
you must help him. Mikhail Sergeyevich was probably aware who 
did what--when and how. Yes, I was actually arrested during 
that attempt, but everything turned out all right. 
  The interest in Gorbachev's dacha in Crimea is very great. 
It should, of course, belong wholly to the Crimean Republic. 
At present, it is not used for recreational purposes, and no 
one wants to use it as a holiday place. As for us--I mean the 
Crimean republic--we should do everything we can to turn it into 
a site for the general public. Such interest and such attention 
exist. After all, people should be allowed to see what they 
want to see. Gorbachev's dacha should be opened to the public, 
since it is no longer an individual's property but a symbol of 
the entire period in our history. The Crimea is rich in symbols 
and monuments, and this one should be added to them. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Skryabin] A question from Anna Grigoryevna Kulakova. Do you 
think that the same tactics are used both in Abkhazia and in 
Crimea-- namely, first to cut off these territories and then 
hand them over to Russia? 
  [Meshkov] I do not think so. This is not the expansionism 
and imperial manner of the Russia of the past, but a natural 
desire of the former regions and the present regions that are 
detached from the single economic area. This is an economic 
problem. If this problem is resolved, all political problems 
will disappear. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to answer a question that you have given to me.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] The Ukrainian parliament's position on the nuclear 
arms issue remains "unclear" to Russia, a senior Russian source 
said. 
  Yuriy Dubinin, head of the Russian delegation to 
negotiations with Ukraine, told Interfax: "It is still difficult 
to make out what kind of decision on the START-I treaty the 
Supreme Soviet of Ukraine took on February 4, 1994, and why it 
preferred not to immediately join the Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons." 
  On Monday, Dubinin said in an interview with Interfax that 
there were several moot points in the Ukrainian legislature's 
resolution ratifying START-I. It is unclear, for example, what 
proportion of the nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine are to be 
destroyed. "There hasn't been any more clarity since Monday," 
Dubinin said. 
  He said Russian-Ukrainian talks which took place in Kiev and 
ended on Thursday had been held "in a good atmosphere and 
produced positive results." In particular, agreement was 
reached on a package of documents to provide for measures to 
implement the Moscow January 14 accord between the presidents of 
Russia, the United States and Ukraine, under which America is to 
provide funds for the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine 
and their dismantling, while Ukraine is to receive compensation. 
  Dubinin declined to go into details about the results of the 
Kiev negotiations, which, he said, had to be reported to 
President Boris Yeltsin before being made public. "We hope the 
drafts will be approved by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid 
Kravchuk and will help to find a final solution to the problem 
of the nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian territory," he 
said. 
  The Ukrainian delegation to the Kiev talks included Deputy 
Premier Valeriy Shmarov and Deputy Foreign Minister Boris 
Tarasyuk.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pelts and Anatoliy Ladin report: "Time for </F>
Disagreements Is Past. Results of Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev's Tour of Central Asian Republics"] 
  [Text] A joint Russian and Uzbek Foreign Ministry 
statement issued 9 February in Tashkent reflects their 
principled stance on Afghanistan, where, as you know, an armed 
fight for power is flaring up with renewed vigor. In addition 
to expressing profound concern at events in the neighboring 
state, the statement reaffirms the principles of strict 
neutrality and noninterference in the internal affairs of the 
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 
  Andrey Kozyrev also discussed a wide range of issues of 
mutual interest during his conversation with Kazakhstani 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev. He discussed problems involved 
in preparing for the meeting of the Commonwealth heads of state 
too. What is more, it was decided to set up working groups to 
seek a solution to the most burning problems in relations 
between the two countries. 
  Asked by your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent about the 
results 
of his talks in Almaty, Andrey Kozyrev replied that he did not 
have the task of signing any documents. It was a question of 
preparing a whole package of treaties and agreements. Primarily 
on Russian-Kazakhstani military cooperation. The sides 
discussed the possibility of dismantling the nuclear weapons 
stationed on Kazakhstan's territory and taking them back to 
Russia. While agreeing, Kozyrev stressed, appropriate 
compensation for the strategic nuclear materials. It was 
likewise deemed necessary to formulate an agreement on legal and 
humanitarian questions, including a treaty on citizenship. And 
a number of other documents dealing with the problems of the 
Russian-speaking population. The issue of joint use of the 
Baykonur cosmodrome was discussed separately. 
  "My task," the Russian foreign minister said, "was to 
discuss 
these matters in detail with the Kazakhstani side and give 
President Nazarbayev a personal message from Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin, which I did." 
  Andrey Kozyrev expressed the hope that when the bilateral 
agreements are signed the scope for demagoguery over many 
difficult issues will be exhausted. He pointed to the total 
coincidence of views on a whole series of matters under 
discussion. 
  Andrey Kozyrev visited the Baykonur cosmodrome 10 February.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Eggert report: "Moscow Continues Fight for </F>
Baykonur"] 
  [Text] Baykonur-Moscow -- Baykonur, the world's biggest 
space rocket complex, still remains the subject of disagreements 
between Moscow and Almaty. The visit to the cosmodrome and the 
satellite city of Leninsk by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and his Kazakhstani counterpart Tuleutay Suleymenov, 
which was the final item on the program of the Russian 
diplomatic head's visit to Kazakhstan, confirmed yet again that 
only Presidents Yeltsin and Nazarbayev will be able to secure a 
definitive solution of the Baykonur problem. 
  In 1993 the Russian Defense Ministry spent 47 billion rubles 
[R] on Baykonur. According to the military, at least R259 
billion will be required this year, but only R6 billion have 
been received so far. Almaty, which according to the interstate 
agreements assumes 6 percent of the estimated costs, has not 
paid a ruble so far this year. 
  Two militias and two judicial systems operate in Leninsk. 
There is no Russian security service at the military facilities 
-- all the special personnel are under the command of Almaty. 
Senior Lieutenant Chugunov, a representative of the special 
department, rather unceremoniously threw the press out of the 
building where "Soyuz" and "Progress" complexes are prepared for 
flights. Mentioning Kozyrev's name was no help. 
  Baykonur has become the object of a sharp struggle not only 
between Russia and Kazakhstan but also between various 
departments in Moscow. Until recently there was the idea of 
transferring the cosmodrome to an international consortium with 
the participation of Western investors. However, at a session 
of the Russian Government Presidium in December it was decided 
to concentrate on the proposals of the Defense Ministry, which 
advocates leasing Baykonur and turning it formally into a 
facility run under bilateral cooperation arrangements but 
effectively into a Russian military base. The principle of 
leasing was enshrined in a special protocol by the prime 
ministers of Russia and Kazakhstan. 
  The arguments of Pavel Grachev's department are as follows: 
The lion's share of work under Russia's military space program 
is carried out at Baykonur, and commercialization of the 
cosmodrome would be a painful blow to it. Moreover, Russian and 
Western technologies in this sphere are often incompatible. 
  However, there is also an alternative opinion which holds 
that the "internationalization" of Baykonur could be carried out 
without detriment to Russian strategic interests, but the 
Military Space Forces command is opposed to this since in this 
situation, unlike ordinary military specialists, it would 
essentially be out of a job. If it lost control of Baykonur, it 
would be forced to content itself with running the small 
Plesetsk cosmodrome on the Kola Peninsula and the moribund 
Kapustin Yar test site. "General Ivanov, commander of the 
Russian Military Space Forces, and his subordinates want to 
reduce the cosmodrome to such a state that the Kazakhs will 
themselves say: 'Take it.' Then it will be possible to obtain 
from Moscow credits whose use it will be very difficult to 
monitor," one civilian resident of Leninsk believes. He claimed 
that the servicemen were instructed to show Kozyrev the blackest 
picture, to lay it on thick, and to complain about the civilian 
administration of Leninsk. 
  Be that as it may, the Russian-Kazakhstani talks about the 
future of Baykonur will proceed with particular intensity over 
the next few weeks. According to information from diplomatic 
sources, Moscow is intending to propose that a 30-year term be 
set for the lease contract. Fundamental disagreements remain 
over the question of the rental. Unofficially Kazakhstani 
experts have mentioned to their Russian colleagues a sum of $3.5 
billion this year, plus compensation for environmental damage 
over the previous two years. Unquestionably the main task of 
Almaty, which is incapable of implementing an independent 
aerospace program today, is to make a lot of money out of 
Baykonur. Smolenskaya Square believes such terms to be 
unacceptable, stating that there can be no question of payments 
in hard currency.

  [Text] Moscow, 11 Feb -- "We have discussed the most 
topical issues of political life in the republic and those 
problems that exist around Tajikistan, with the aim of 
stabilizing political activity and attracting all forces 
interested in Tajikistan's prosperity, or at least in Tajikistan 
overcoming the political and economic crisis," Abduzhalil 
Samadov, chairman of Tajikistan Council of Ministers, told 
journalists today after a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the 
Tajikistan Council of Ministers chairman said that significant 
progress was reached in the development of bilateral ties 
between the republic and its Central Asian neighbors. Working 
groups have been set up at an intergovernment level. They will 
deal with developing trade and economic cooperation between the 
states and we believe that this will inevitably lead to positive 
results. 
  In Andrey Kozyrev's view, it is necessary to work together 
in 
order not to miss currently available opportunities in the 
settlement of the crisis in Tajikistan. "The prospects for such 
settlement," the Russian minister stressed, "will depend totally 
on the purposefulness and coordination of our actions." He said 
that he had discussed these issues during his recent tours of 
the countries of the region and with other Commonwealth states. 
  In the opinion of the Russian minister, by joining efforts 
and "by relying on the realistic and business-like approach of 
Tajikistan's leadership," it is possible to make these prospects 
both real and peaceful and find a way out of the crisis. "It is 
possible to resolve this complex problem by joining efforts," 
the minister stressed. "There was great confidence in this 
respect."

  [Text] All residents of Pechorskiy Rayon of the Russian 
Federation's Pskov Oblast are being "issued Estonian passports" 
according to a "simplified procedure," even without having to 
pass exams testing their knowledge of the Estonian language, or 
without certificates on privatization of objects on the rayon's 
territory. This was stated in a press conference in Moscow on 
Thursday by Vladimir Lukin, chief of the State Duma 
international affairs committee, and Vladimir Podoprigora, 
chairman of a similar Federation Council committee, who both 
visited the border area the day before. According to Mr. Lukin, 
the Estonian side, as it refers to the borders established by 
the 1920 Tartu Peace treaty between the RSFSR and the Estonian 
Republic, considers this rayon of Russia to be its own 
territory, which is reflected in its constitution.

correspondent Aleksandr Gurnov on 10 February in London] 
  [Text] [Gurnov] The next Russian-British summit is becoming 
a reality. The British delegation, led by John Major, will 
depart for Moscow on 14 January [as heard]. The main objective 
of the talks with our leadership is obvious: to assess the new 
balance of forces in Russia after all those reshuffles -- on the 
spot. After that, there will be a visit to Nizhnyy Novgorod, 
which the British view as a model for creating market 
infrastructure with Western help. 
  What about British interests? After all, if they are coming 
to us, they must also want something. We came to Downing Street 
to ask this question. 
  [Begin recording] [Gurnov] Mr. Major, there is a lot of talk 
now about helping Russia, but is there anything Russia can do to 
help Britain? 
  [Major, in English with superimposed Russian translation] 
Russia is an enormous and strong power, and it is in British 
interests to have good relations with you. Therefore, we are 
ready to help you try to overcome your difficulties, but you are 
right. Russia has something to offer, not only to Britain but 
to the whole world. The president, the prime minister, and I 
will be discussing this during the summit. 
  [Gurnov] The British prime minister will be the first 
Western leader to visit the Kremlin after the NATO decision on 
Yugoslavia, which was adopted today and which now threatens to 
mar Russia's relations with the West. In the light of this, 
what will be John Major's main task in Moscow? 
  [Major] I would like to stress that NATO is not taking 
anyone's side in this conflict. We want to find a way to stop 
the bloodshed while negotiations continue. We have no other 
option. I am sure that Russia's objective is the same. Because 
we have similar aims, we have a basis for dialogue. [end 
recording] 
  [Gurnov] Moscow's task will be to give Major a message for 
the Western world at a moment when both our home and foreign 
policies certainly need explaining; that is, if Russia still 
wants to continue being a part of this world.

  [Text] London, 11 February -- "I am, of course, going to 
Russia with very warm feelings toward the Russian people. I am 
satisfied with my previous visits to your country and the 
meetings with Russian leaders I have had here in England." 
British Prime Minister John Major, who will pay a official 
visit to Russia on 14-16 February, said this in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS, Russian TV, and Ostankino. President Yeltsin 
and I are planning to discuss a wide range of issues that will 
include the situation in Russia, bilateral relations, and, 
naturally, a wide range of international problems and economic 
and political issues, he said. The discussions will be very 
broad in scope. 
  John Major stressed that he considered the recent changes in 
the Russian Government's cabinet to be the business of the 
Russian people. I and all my colleagues in Great Britain am 
interested in seeing the continuation of the program of reforms 
in your country and the achievement of success on the path 
toward economic prosperity, he said. This is in the interests 
of Russia, and we too are striving for this. Russia is a great 
and powerful country and we are interested in having equal 
relations with it. We are happy to help it in any way we can, 
but Russia too can offer a great deal to the rest of the world, 
including Great Britain. I intend to discuss this in Moscow 
with the Russian president and prime minister, John Major said. 
  Concerning the situation in the former Yugoslavia, the head 
of the British Government pointed out that he was looking 
forward to the talks in Moscow on this problem. We believe the 
aims of the Russian Government are similar to those the West is 
also setting itself. We want a halt to the military actions and 
to the unnecessary and senseless loss of lives. The main aim, 
which I think is also shared by Russia, is to achieve a 
political settlement to the conflict through talks, the prime 
minister stressed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 12 TASS -- An official Russian visit 
of British Prime Minister John Major is expected to result in 
signing of two intergovernmental documents to consolidate the 
Russian- British agreement relations, director of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry's Second European Department Yuriy Fokin told 
ITAR-TASS here today. 
  The finalization of a convention against double taxation is 
of special importance, as the document will help to regulate 
economic and financial relations. The second document will be a 
framework agreement on cooperation in education, science and 
culture. Both documents have been fully prepared for signing by 
foreign ministers in the presence of the Russian and British 
leaders. 
  In the opinion of the diplomat, there are no serious 
problems 
in the Russian-British relations. "All major stumbling stones 
have been removed," he said. 
  As for international issues, the Russian Foreign Ministry 
hopes to discuss the European situation, including the creation 
of security system and development of Russian relations with 
"the seven". The latter may become "the eight" in future. 
  The sides will also focus on Russian and British future 
actions at the U.N. Security Council or CSCE. 
  The British prime minister will be informed about the 
Russian 
situation and its relations with former Soviet republics. A 
special item on the agenda will be relations with the Baltic 
states, where "considerable progress has been achieved". 
  The Baltic theme will also be analyzed by Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and British Secretary of State for 
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Douglas Hurd. The latter will 
leave Moscow for Riga on February 16 to meet foreign ministers 
of the three Baltic republics. 
  "Russia and Great Britain have long discussed the Baltic 
issue and Russia is grateful for British readiness to help 
settlement of the remaining problems," said Fokin. 
  In his words, the negotiations may result in signing of 
other 
documents, including those on security.

<F P=106> [Anastasiya Romashkevich report in the "North Korea and </F>
Nuclear Security" column: "Pyongyang Believes that `The DPRK 
Cannot Be Strangled With Sanctions'"] 
  [Excerpt] Yesterday the leadership of the IAEA supported 
the U.S. Senate's initiative to impose economic sanctions 
against North Korea. The IAEA and Pyongyang still adhere to 
opposite views on the possibility of inspecting the two North 
Korean installations, where, the agency suspects, work is under 
way to create a nuclear bomb. In such a situation, the 
possibility of the sides' reaching a compromise appears unlikely. 
<H3>  Pyongyang "has neither the capability nor the wish to create 
a bomb" </H3>
  In an exclusive interview with KOMMERSANT-DAILY, North Korea 
ambassador to Russia, Comrade Son Song-pil stated that 
Pyongyang, contrary to U.S. assertions, "has neither the 
capability nor the wish to create a bomb." Up until recently, 
he noted, the United States, in an effort to justify the conduct 
of military exercises and to preserve its contingent in the 
south of the Korean Peninsula, has talked about a threat to 
South Korea on the part of the USSR and the DPRK. Now there is 
no USSR, and Washington needs "new excuses." "The essence of the 
North Korean nuclear problem," the ambassador said, was 
explained by Great Leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year 
speech: It is the "product of U.S. hostile policy." 
  Pyongyang, however, believes that the problem can be 
resolved 
only through negotiations with the United States. According to 
Son Song-pil, immediately after the consultations, a general 
outline for resolving the problem was delineated. The DPRK 
promised to suspend its withdrawal from the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty, stop using the nuclear reactor with 
graphite moderator, and freeze all nuclear programs. Washington 
for its part promised to abandon the policy of "threatening the 
DPRK" by stopping its joint Team Spirit military exercises with 
South Korea. At the same time, Pyongyang will agree to IAEA 
inspection "on a limited scale." As the ambassador noted, 
however, the IAEA has again "irresponsibly" demanded a 
full-scale inspection, which does not correspond to North 
Korea's "special status" under the nonproliferation treaty. The 
United States, the diplomat believes, not only is not seeking to 
adjust the IAEA's position, but has actually renounced the 
obligations it assumed earlier, thereby violating the principle 
of using a comprehensive approach in dealing with the problem. 
And now, according to the ambassador, Pyongyang is right to 
abandon its promises (although the decision to suspend the 
withdrawal from the treaty still stands). As for the economic 
sanctions, the DPRK, "which has a powerful industry, will not be 
stifled." The United States, in the ambassador's opinion, may 
try to exert pressure by military methods. Washington has 
already announced its intention to deploy Patriot missiles in 
South Korea and hold new exercises analogous to Team Spirit. In 
this event the DPRK, according to the diplomat, will take 
"adequate measures" (he did not specify which). 
  Son Song-pil also stated that even in the event of a 
full-scale inspection (which will become possible only after 
Pyongyang has returned to the nonproliferation treaty), North 
Korea will not admit the IAEA to the two installations it wants 
to inspect. He explained that only nuclear installations are 
subject to inspection, while these two are not such. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, by </F>
Sergey Turchenko; place and date not given: "Sharpening of 
Claws. DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil Assesses the 
Military Adventure That Is Being Prepared"] 
  [Text] In recent days a propaganda campaign directed 
against North Korea has been surging ahead strongly in the West 
and on the other side of the ocean. In terms of its scale and 
tone it is commensurate with what happened on the eve of the 
ill-starred Desert Storm. Numerous voices are to be heard 
saying that it is necessary to "punish" the DPRK and "crush" it 
by military might. The reasoning is the traditional pharisaical 
reasoning: shouts about some threat to peace in Northeast Asia 
supposedly stemming from this small socialist state. Our 
correspondent met with Comrade Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to 
Russia, and asked him to answer questions connected with these 
extremely alarming circumstances. 
  [Turchenko] Comrade Son Song-pil, there can be few people 
now who would doubt that when the world policeman shouts "Stop 
thief!" this is nothing but a propaganda smoke screen to conceal 
from public opinion the machinations going on behind the scenes. 
Where is the dog buried in this instance? 
  [Son] In Japan. A powerful nuclear reactor was started up 
in that country a few days ago. Japan has become capable of 
producing nuclear weapons. Capacities for the production of 800 
tonnes [figure as published] of plutonium a year have been 
commissioned. In terms of this indicator the Japanese have 
emerged into third place in the world after the United States 
and France. On Japanese territory now there is 1.6 tonnes of 
plutonium, plus it has 2.9 tonnes abroad. Up to 50 tonnes is 
being forecast by the start of the next millennium. That would 
be enough to provide 6,200 nuclear weapons. In addition, Japan 
possesses ICBM's capable of carrying them. 
  In the past North and South Korea signed a declaration on 
turning the Korean Peninsula into a nuclear-free zone. We are 
working to extend this status to the whole of Northeast Asia. 
But if Japan becomes a nuclear power, that will pose a 
tremendous threat to the Korean Peninsula, and the said 
declaration will lose all meaning. Such a militarist step will 
encourage other countries in the region, including ours, to take 
appropriate measures. We are convinced that the world community 
must show vigilance and halt this process in a timely manner. 
Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on this 4 
February. But, instead of exerting appropriate influence over 
Japan, the United States raised a propaganda ballyhoo over our 
country, accusing it of what the Japanese ought to have been 
accused of. The DPRK, however, has neither the intention nor 
the material potential to produce nuclear weapons. 
  [Turchenko] This propaganda ballyhoo does not seem to have 
been raised just to cover Japan's militarist aspirations. Are 
there any other aims? 
  [Son] There are several. When the Soviet Union existed, the 
Americans had military bases in South Korea on the pretext of a 
supposed threat from the USSR. Now that pretext has fallen 
away. Now they make a bugaboo out of North Korea so as to 
provide at least some reason for a military presence in 
Northeast Asia. 
  Another aim is connected with the long-standing U.S. desire 
to destroy our socialist state. In order to create a propaganda 
base for the use of military force, they accuse us of allegedly 
not only having long-range missiles ourselves but also selling 
them to Near East countries, thereby destabilizing the 
situation. Basing themselves on these propaganda fabrications, 
U.S. militarist circles insist on military sanctions against the 
DPRK. I wish to emphasize: Our armed forces are built on the 
principle of self-defense and threaten no one. On the contrary, 
proceeding from the essence of the socialist system, the DPRK 
strives to strengthen peace by all means. It is, however, the 
firm will of the people and the Army to uphold the country's 
sovereignty. We are ready for any surprise attack and are 
always true to our position: to respond to dialogue with 
dialogue, and to war with war. 
  [Turchenko] How real is the threat of an attack on the DPRK, 
and what do you see as the time frame of this sinister prospect? 
  [Son] The United States is already taking specific steps to 
this end. In recent days, for example, intensive work has been 
under way to site U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea. 
Unfortunately, I have to state that an attack might be made at 
any moment. 
  [Turchenko] Of course, the entire world community is obliged 
to prevent such a development of events, but the primary duty 
lies with the countries with which you have treaties of mutual 
assistance. Please name them. 
  [Son] We have such treaties, including treaties in military 
spheres, with China and the USSR. Russia is the successor to 
the USSR, and our treaty has not lost its force. 
  [Turchenko] How did the Russian authorities react to the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry's 4 February statement? 
  [Son] The Russian Federation Foreign Ministry told us that 
it would study it, but there has not yet been an official 
reaction. In this connection I must emphasize the following. 
The maintenance of peace is undoubtedly the common concern of 
all countries. The more people who are found to help us at a 
difficult moment, the better. But it is not always possible to 
count on anyone in the business of upholding sovereignty. Our 
people and our Army are ready for very determined actions. If 
we are attacked, the whole people will be mobilized and together 
with the Army will rise to the motherland's defense. Let those 
who are planning aggression in North Korea ponder that.

<F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 12 Feb -- Vladimir Kazimirov, roving 
ambassador of the Russian Foreign Ministry, and Morteza Bank, 
director general in the Iranian Foreign Ministry expressed deep 
concern over the sharp escalation in military activities in 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Russian-Iranian talks on settling the Karabakh conflict have 
taken place in Moscow. The sides expressed particular disquiet 
at the growing scale of combat actions, their worsening severity 
and the increasing bloodshed, which is intensifying the inhuman 
nature of the conflict. 
  As ITAR-TASS was told at the Department of Information and 
the Russian Foreign Ministry press center, both sides noted that 
the increasing internationalization of the conflict represents a 
great danger to the cause of peace and regional stability. It 
carries the threat of a major conflict with unpredictable 
consequences for the region and for the whole world. 
  During the consultations it was acknowledged that only by 
relying on peaceful political means and on the capability of the 
sides to reach a sensible reciprocal compromise will it be 
possible realistically to lay down a firm and long-term basis 
for a settlement. The Russian side stressed that the main 
priority is to reach an immediate cease-fire, the cessation of 
all combat actions, and the conclusion of an agreement on this. 
  The sides confirmed their conviction that it was possible 
and 
essential to reach a bloodless political solution to all the 
problems of the conflict exclusively by peaceful means, 
including the liberation of territories, the restoration of 
transport and power links, and the return of refugees. 
  The participants in the consultations noted that Russia and 
Iran support the efforts of the world community to settle the 
conflict. Russia and Iran are in direct proximity to and have 
interests in achieving a settlement of this conflict and they 
have frequently put forward initiatives toward reaching a 
peaceful resolution and they are continuing their efforts and 
maintaining constant contact with each other.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk believes that the problem 
of air strikes on positions of Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo should 
be considered by the UN Security Council [UNSC]. 
  If there is no other way, measures should be taken. Not only 
one or several states, but the entire world community should 
decide on this, he told journalists in Kiev Thursday. 
  The president believes the coincidence of positions of 
Ukraine and Russia on the issue is incidental. "I am sure that 
our positions will continue to coincide," he said. 
  Answering questions about the internal political situation 
in 
Ukraine, including on the republic's federalization, Kravchuk 
said that he favored broad economic freedom to all regions of 
Ukraine. However, he said: "I believe the question is premature 
from a political point of view." At the same time the president 
admits that the idea could be expedient in the future. 
  Asked what political structure for Ukraine - presidential or 
parliamentary - would seem preferable for him, Kravchuk said: "I 
prefer the political structure of France, where, he said, a 
strong parliament co-exists with the president who has large 
powers. 
  Foreign Minister Zlenko told reporters in Madrid that the 
NATO decision on air strikes if Bosnian Serbs refuse to lay down 
arms may aggravate the situation around Sarajevo and will put 
under threat the lives of Ukrainian servicemen who are part of 
the UN peacekeeping contingent in the zone. 
  Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy told journalists in Kiev 
Thursday that in case of air raids, the Ukrainian battalion will 
be withdrawn to a safer place. He also said that Ukraine does 
not intend to give up its preliminary understanding with the 
United Nations on tripling its military presence within the 
framework of the UN peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Late last year the Ukrainian parliament decided to increase 
the Ukrainian battalion in Sarajevo from 400 to 1,220 servicemen.

  [Text] A few minutes ago, we received a statement from the 
press service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of 
Ministers. On 10 February, REUTER inaccurately reported on the 
stance of Leonid Kravchuk on the possible bombardment of Bosnian 
Serb military positions around Sarajevo. In particular, REUTER 
claims that the Ukrainian president said that he does not see 
any alternative to the onset of air attacks on the Serbian 
positions sanctioned by the United Nations. In connection with 
this, REUTER reported on the evident change in the Ukrainian 
president's previous position on this issue. This does not 
correspond to reality. 
  The statement from the press service of the Ukrainian 
president and the Cabinet of Ministers cites the entire text of 
Kravchuk's interview with REUTER. This text shows that 
President Kravchuk confirmed REUTER's supposition that the 
stances of Ukraine and Russia, which are opposed to air strikes 
on the Bosnian Serbs, are close to each other. In addition, 
Leonid Kravchuk stated that, in general, this is not the first 
time the stances of Ukraine and Russia have been close to each 
other. I am convinced that our stances on such international 
issues as strengthening global peace, the social protection of 
people and their human rights and freedoms, and on other 
international issues were, are, and will be close. We will 
cooperate and coordinate our policy with Russia, said Leonid 
Kravchuk. Answering a question as to who -- NATO or the UN 
Security Council -- will decide on the bombardment of Bosnian 
Serbs, Leonid Kravchuk definitely spoke in favor of the UN 
Security Council, because the issue under discussion is 
connected with a forceful invasion. Next, Leonid Kravchuk said: 
I admit this option when there is no other way out, when blood 
is shed and people are dying. Simply put, my hair stands on end 
when I hear the reports of how people, including children, are 
dying there, in what terrible conditions they are living, and 
how much has been destroyed. Both the land and people's soul 
are devastated. If there is no other way to stop this 
nightmare, we have to use other approaches, however, this should 
not be the decision of a single country, this should be a 
decision made by the entire international community. I always 
favored and still favor this option. [Words indistinct], 
however, there are international organizations -- the United 
Nations and its Security Council, the EC, and others. This 
issue should be resolved by the highest level international 
organizations. 
  Therefore, you can see that the REUTER report does not at 
all 
correspond to what Leonid Kravchuk really said. The press 
service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers 
is authorized to denounce the REUTER report as totally changing 
the gist of the Ukrainian president's remarks.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Presidential Cabinet press service 
circulated a statement which refutes REUTER's 10 February report 
as distorting President Kravchuk's utterances on the issue of 
retaliatory bombardment of the Bosnian Serbs' positions around 
Sarajevo. The REUTER story quotes President Kravchuk as saying 
that he sees no alternative to a UN-sanctioned air strike and 
makes a conclusion about the president's altered position on 
this issue. In fact, though, as the full transcript of Mr. 
Kravchuk's replies testifies, the Ukrainian president confirmed 
the correspondent's assumption about coincidence of opinions on 
the subject held by Ukraine's and Russia's presidents, who are 
against the bombardment. Replying to a question about who should 
make the air strike decision, NATO or the UN Security Council, 
President Kravchuk said quite unambiguously that it should be 
made by the UN Security Council since it would be a decision on 
a forceful interference. President Kravchuk further said that he 
was aware that a variant of developments was possible with 
bloodshed and massacre which there would be no other way to stop 
but make such a decision. [sentence as heard] But such a 
decision must be made by the world community, not just one 
nation, the Ukrainian president said.

  [Text] Kiev--Asked by journalists on 10 February to comment 
on Ukraine's stance on the prospect of bombing Bosnian Serbs, 
the aggressors in the former Yugoslavia, Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk said, in particular, that the joint Russian and 
Ukrainian position on this issue--that these countries spoke 
against this action--should not be a surprise. Kravchuk said he 
was convinced that Ukraine and Russia would also share common 
views on issues relating to peace and security in the future. 
While the Russian stance categorically objects, however, to the 
possibility of bombing, Kravchuk noted: "This step should be 
taken if there are no other ways to stop the insanity, but this 
must be settled by the world community--through the United 
Nations or the CSCE--rather than by one state". 
  On 11 February, Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Anatoliy 
Zlenko telephoned the head of the Russia Foreign Ministry 
regarding the initiative. They discussed the issue of 
Russian-Ukrainian relations and the development of the 
international situation. They examined the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in particular, in the light of the latest 
NATO Council's decisions. Both sides expressed the opinion that 
the settlement of the situation should take place through 
stepping up political efforts-- primarily within the framework 
of the UN Security Council--rather than through escalating 
combat actions.

a press conference in Kiev on Thursday [10 February] that the 
Ukrainian battalion would be withdrawn to safe positions if air 
attacks were carried out against Bosnian Serbs. 
  However, he emphasized that Ukraine did not intend to back 
down from the earlier agreement with the UN concerning an 
increase in Ukraine's military presence in the former Yugoslavia 
by 3 times its current number within the scope of UN peacemaking 
forces. 
  The Ukrainian parliament decided to increase the personnel 
of 
the Ukrainian battalion within the UN forces in Sarajevo from 
400 to 1,220 people in late 1993.

  [Text] Kiev, 11 Feb -- Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the 
Supreme Council Commission for Foreign Affairs, supported the 
view upholding the necessity of air strikes against Serbian 
positions in the outskirts of Sarajevo. He warned, however, 
that the strike can cause deaths among UN servicemen, 
specifically members of the Ukrainian battalion. 
  "Despite the opinion of the Ukrainian leader, I dare say 
that 
this problem needs to be discussed and thought out," Dmytro 
Pavlychko said. "Russia is trying to scare the world saying that 
NATO air forces' intervention in Bosnia's problems would mean a 
war against Russia. But if the world community continues to 
tolerate murderers, this can end up in the extermination of 
Muslims. If we stand by this view, we are acting in an inhumane 
way. I am in favor of returning to this problem at the level of 
top responsible political leaders of the great powers," Dmytro 
Pavlychko emphasized. 
  It is worth mentioning that Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk in a conversation with journalists in fact supported 
Russia's stand refusing to interfere in the affairs of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Ukraine's Ambassador Extraordinary and 
Plenipotentiary to the United States of America Oleg Bilorus 
handed U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott the text of 
the 3 February 1994 resolution by the Supreme Council of Ukraine 
on full-scale ratification of START I and the Lisbon Protocol. 
During the conversation at the U.S. State Department, Oleg 
Bilorus stressed that Ukraine legally confirmed the consistency 
of the policy toward achieving a non-nuclear status, conducted 
by the president and the government. 
  On his part, Strobe Talbott pointed out that the decision by 
the Ukrainian parliament makes its possible to significantly 
increase U.S. aid to our state toward the implementation of the 
programs of dismantling and eliminating nuclear weapons 
stationed on its territory. He also put special emphasis on the 
personal contribution and political courage of the president of 
Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, who had been defending consistently 
and selflessly the necessity of the full-scale ratification of 
START I and the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty by 
Ukraine.

  [Text] Kiev -- In his interview with a UNIAN correspondent 
on 10 February, Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy 
commented on certain aspects of Ukraine's accession to the 
"Partnership for Peace" treaty. "I have not been calculating the 
cost of Ukraine's participation in the partnership," he said. 
"However, regional security is in the forefront of the treaty, 
while issues which require payments go next. I consider the 
signing of the treaty to be undoubtedly necessary and urgent. 
As for the prospects for Ukraine's accession to NATO, our 
military doctrine stipulates non- alignment, however our army, 
undoubtedly, has all prerequisites for reforming its 
infrastructure following the NATO states' pattern."

  [Text] As a result of a meeting between the Ukrainian and 
Russian Government delegations held in Kiev last week, with the 
aim of working out a mechanism of dismantling Ukrainian nuclear 
warheads, Ukraine managed to achieve an agreement in principle, 
which provides for far more advantageous compensation conditions 
to Ukraine for the warheads that are being withdrawn [from 
Ukraine's territory]. This was reported by Nur Nihmatulin, the 
deputy chairman of the State Committee of Ukraine for the Use of 
Nuclear Power. Russia can compensate by supplying fuel for the 
nine reactors operating at Ukrainian nuclear power stations, in 
an amount ample to maintain the work of the stations throughout 
36 to 42 months. The compensation can also be made in the form 
of writing off or writing down Ukraine's debt for the power 
sources imported from Russia. 
  Earlier, the Russian side flatly rejected the possibility of 
writing off this debt as compensation for the dismantling of the 
warheads. Ukraine's debt for the oil and gas supplied by Russia 
now amounts to no less than 800 billion rubles and about 120 
billion rubles for the fuel for nuclear power stations. 
  Undoubtedly, the recent ratification of START I by the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council has received an unequivocally positive 
response throughout the world and contributed to relaxing 
Russia's stand.

  [Text] Disruptive measures are being taken by local 
communications workers. Mayak programs were switched off in the 
oblast on 6 February, while today, even the "Utro" television 
news program was not broadcast. However, commercial channels are 
continuing to operate, broadcasting semilegal Western clips and 
local advertisements. The local television program will not be 
switched off as its management has reached agreement with the 
communications workers to earn millions [as heard] and pay them 
off. Even so, local television and the two commercial channels 
are working only a few hours a day. Meanwhile, local 
inhabitants watch Polish, Swedish and other Western programs, 
which can be received well here. 
  When I asked Kostantin Votpusko, head of the oblast's radio 
and television transmission center what he thought of this 
situation, he said that state television had long been a burden 
to the transmission workers. It is much simpler to sell the air 
time to the multitude of private commercial companies, which 
agree to pay large amounts of money. This would be in the 
interests of the transmission workers, he said. I think that 
this is what lies behind the boycott and its logic. But who is 
giving thought to the interests of Russian viewers and 
listeners?

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The demands of the 
communication workers' trade union will be closely examined and 
satisfied, proceeding from what is possible in reality. A 
meeting between Viktor Chernomyrdin and the leaders of the trade 
union is planned for the next few days. 
  Understanding how difficult the situation is, the chairman 
of 
the government appeals to the heads and workforces of oblast 
radio and TV relay centers to continue work in accordance with 
the radio and TV broadcasting schedules. 
  Nevertheless, we continue receiving reports from the regions 
on TV and radio broadcasting being cut. In Murmansk, 
Kandalaksha, Zapolyarnyy, and Kirovsk only Russian Television 
programs will be broadcast. On the instruction of the head of 
the Tomsk Radio and TV Center, broadcasting of the All-Russian 
TV and Radio Company has been halted and only news bulletins go 
on the air. The situation in Buryatia is similar. More than 
one-third of Russia's transmitters are not operating at all or 
are operating only partially. Such major TV and radio centers 
like the Chita, Novosibirsk, Yuzhnosakhalinsk, and Kamchatka 
ones are not operating at all. 
  Volgograd's communication workers have reported that only 
because of severe frost has broadcasting not been switched there.

  [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb -- Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of 
the Russian Government, told journalists today that debts 
incurred by television companies to communication workers will 
be paid stage-by-stage during the first quarter of this year. 
"Debts must be paid," he said, meaning the 220 billion ruble 
debt of television companies to the Ministry of Communications. 
  At the same time Viktor Chernomyrdin said that it is 
necessary "to sort out to whom and how we broadcast." He 
believes that not all programs should be broadcast on state 
channels. The head of the Russian Cabinet did not rule out that 
in very near future a number of channels and TV studios may be 
privatized or sold off. 
  Chernomyrdin expressed doubt in the necessity to continue 
the 
practice of broadcasting on all channels until 0300. "There 
should be broadcasting, but not on all channels," the premier 
underlined.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 10 Feb--The current action by communications 
workers in which the first and second TV channels were switched 
off in some Russian Federation regions shows once again that the 
government should promptly draw up a comprehensive concept for 
the functioning of the electronic media, Grigoriy Shevelev, 
first deputy chairman of "Ostankino" Russian state TV and radio 
company, believes. He told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that, 
"with all due understanding for the problems of communications 
workers, to deprive television viewers cannot be the only way to 
solve the problems of the industry". 
  Having mentioned that "Ostankino" was taking measures to 
reduce nighttime and daytime broadcasting, Shevelev does not 
believe, however, that such economical measures will help on a 
large scale. In his view, the solution lies in a search for ways 
to ensure a more efficient signal propagation in the Russian 
Federation and in the use of more advanced and economical 
technologies. According to Shevelev, introducing the payment of 
rent for television will improve the situation to a degree, a 
measure that will make television directly dependent on the 
interests of viewers at the same time. 
  Shevelev sees the primary need to be a state program for 
developing the electronic media, which would determine a 
correlation between federal and regional television, prospects 
for developing cable networks, and other problems.

<F P=106> [Irina Petrovskaya report in the "Television" column: "On </F>
10 February Communication Workers Switched Off TV Nearly in the 
Whole of Russia. Funds To Pay Debts Have Been Raised but 
Problems Remain"] 
  [Excerpts] The day of 10 February will go down in the 
history of domestic TV and radio broadcasting next to the other 
"black" date -- 3 October. Communication workers managed to do 
more than the coupists: in October, when Ostankino went off the 
air, Russian TV and radio worked all night. This time, however, 
both TV and radio went out completely in more than 60 regions of 
Russia. In a number of regions only morning and evening news 
bulletins were broadcast. Reports coming into Ostankino from the 
morning were reminiscent of front-line reports as though they 
were about an enemy capturing cities, one by one: Yakutsk, 
Irkutsk, Kirov, Kazan, Kemerovo, Nizhniy Novgorod, Saratov, 
Ivanovo, Ulyanovsk, Arkhangelsk, Smolensk, Voronezh, Volgograd, 
and Chita -- a total blackout. Tver, St. Petersburg, Novgorod, 
Krasnodar, and Izhevsk: Only "Novosti" and "Vesti" were aired. 
The greater part of Russia's population was on the verge of a 
full information vacuum. Moscow has avoided such a fate: the 
communication workers saved this "argument" as a last resort. 
According to another version, the director of the Moscow TV and 
Radio Center (as well as the main communication centers in 
several more oblasts) did not obey the decision of their trade 
union and boycotted the protest action. 
  Be that as it may, the threat by the communication workers 
to 
reduce or stop TV and radio broadcasting, which many dismissed 
as not serious enough, was made good. And it worked, confirming 
the eternal Russian truth: Until thunder has struck, the muzhik 
will not cross himself. [passage omitted] 
  What happened on 10 February has shown that our perception 
of 
the present information system as democratic is illusory. The 
system whereby TV is controlled from one point and can instantly 
be switched off throughout the country remains essentially 
totalitarian. [passage omitted] 
  This time it turned out all right in the end. But everyone 
understands: The situation can be repeated. Something must be 
done. Even Viktor Chernomyrdin, who only a month and a half ago 
at a meeting with Ostankino's board of directors stated 
decisively: "The government will provide for state TV no matter 
what," on 10 February, in an interview with "Novosti," called 
into question the need for such a proportion of state 
TV (in Russia there are three federal and 90 regional 
companies): "One should look to see what needs to be 
corporatized and what should be privatized." 
  Ostankino alone will require 1.267 trillion from the budget 
in 1994. Out of this amount, 88 percent will go to pay for 
communication services. 
  Valentin Lazutkin, deputy chairman of the Russian Federal TV 
and Radio Broadcasting Service, is certain: the nongovernmental 
sphere does not have this sort of money. Additional funds 
received from corporatizing Ostankino (if it takes place) will 
allow to recoup program production costs, not pay for the 
transmission. Even if several large financial groups become 
stock holders, there will not be enough money to pay the 
communication workers. 
  Nor is it possible, according to V. Lazutkin, to introduce 
subscription fees or a TV tax: First, the condition of the tax 
system and the way taxes are collected are well known; second, 
the population cannot be coerced to pay TV bills; third, it is 
politically inexpedient to impose high charges while the modest 
sums that will eventually be returned will not cover the 
expenses. 
  Therefore, TV cannot do without large state subsidies. V. 
Lazutkin believes it necessary to undertake a qualified economic 
assessment of the whole system of financial settlements: with 
the communication services, the power services, and so forth. 
Many prices have been established arbitrarily: real prices, on 
the other hand, will allow to reduce these astronomical sums 
substantially. 
  Reorganization within the companies themselves -- cutting 
bloated staffs (especially in Ostankino), streamlining 
advertising, rationalizing the broadcasting regime (eliminating 
what sociologists call idle time) -- all this will also save 
budget resources and allow state TV to survive. And that it is 
on the verge of collapse is clear to everybody. [passage

  [Text] Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has 
spoken in favor of fewer deputy premiers. Addressing 
coal-mining managers and trade union officials in Moscow on 
Friday, he said, "There have been fewer deputy premiers. I 
think that there could be still fewer of them." Chernomyrdin 
explained that, "there are now four deputy premiers, but their 
number will be reduced even more." 
  IF Note: After the Cabinet reshuffle, the deputy prime 
ministers in place are: Oleg Soskovets -- first deputy prime 
minister, and Yuriy Yarov, Aleksander Zaveryukha, and Anatoliy 
Chubays -- deputy prime ministers. 
  Chernomyrdin called for enhancing the role of ministries, 
federal departments, and large industrial companies. 
  "If we make the government free of the duties that are alien 
to it and transfer them to ministries, major companies and 
regions, questions will be solved in a more prompt fashion," 
Chernomyrdin remarked. In his words, the time when only Moscow 
decided whether to build an enterprise or close one has gone and 
will never return. 
  He recalled that as the USSR Gas Minister he cut the number 
of his deputies from 11 to 2 with no adverse effect on the 
industry.

  [Text] Leader of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin faction in 
the State Duma, Grigory Yavlinskiy, said that Russia had not 
become more democratic since 1991 when Yeltsin came to power in 
comparison with the situation under Mikhail Gorbachev. "I see no 
changes in the sphere of dialogue with people, listening to 
them, decrease in the number of officials, struggle with 
corruption," Yavlinskiy said in the Moscow House of Scientists 
on Friday evening. 
  "Gorbachev carried out political reforms ignoring the 
economic ones. Yeltsin has acted vice versa since 1991," 
Yavlinskiy pointed out. In his opinion, the way to abolishment 
of the USSR chosen in 1991 could resist no critic from the point 
of view of logic, market economy and democracy. "We have to pay 
for this, especially in the sphere of the economy," he said. 
  Yavlinskiy also believes that the executive power was to 
blame for the October events in Moscow to a bigger extent. All 
this must be taken into consideration when assessing Yeltsin, 
Yavlinskiy emphasized. 
  On the economic situation, he pointed out that he would 
focus 
on fighting inflation if he were given an opportunity to form 
the government. "It is very important to keep inflation this 
autumn from reaching 40-50%," Yavlinskiy believes. 
  However, Yavlinskiy repeated that he had been critical of 
Gaydar's policy, saying that "constant endless struggle with 
inflation was unreasonable." "Inflation is only a symptom of the 
affected economy. De-monopolization of the economy, 
establishment of a strong and large private sector and real 
competitiveness are needed," he pointed out. 
  Yavlinskiy said that we could hope for Russian money 
returning to Russia from abroad. Its amount is put from $25 Bn 
to $50 Bn, according to different estimates. "We need a system 
under which it will be beneficial for the owners to bring money 
back to Russia," Yavlinskiy emphasized.

  [Text] Establishment of a democratic party on the basis of 
Russia's Choice was discussed at a meeting between Russia's 
Choice leader Yegor Gaydar and public representatives in Moscow 
on Thursday [10 February]. 
  Commenting on the issue, Presidential Press Secretary 
Vyacheslav Kostikov pointed out that democrats, after denying 
the party structure which had led to the arbitrary rule of the 
Soviet Communist Party, started to realize that a "strong, 
well-organized democratic party will guarantee development of 
democracy and continuation of the reforms in Russia." On 
possible interaction between this party and the Russian 
president, Kostikov emphasized that the president was a 
long-time democrat. 
  "Boris Yeltsin has determined his place in the history of 
new 
Russia primarily as a democrat. That is why an ideological 
connection between the president and the democratically-oriented 
party to be established is quite natural. This stems from the 
president's whole policy," Kostikov remarked. 
  Different political groups currently argue who will receive 
the "president's banner." According to Kostikov, this proves 
that society has realized what strong political potential the 
president has. Kostikov expressed his confidence that this 
potential was applied in favor of democracy and contributed to 
the development of reforms. 
  However, Kostikov pointed out that "democrats should take a 
more active position towards the president, introducing 
themselves as an active political force, friendly to Boris 
Yeltsin and ready to support his policy." 
  Also participating in the meeting were Deputy Prime Minister 
Anatoliy Chubays; Sergey Kovalev, a well-known fighter for human 
rights; Yelena Bonner, widow of Academician Andrey Sakharov; 
writer and Federation Council deputy Yuriy Chernichenko; actors 
Zinoviy Gerdt, Mikhail Gluzskiy, and Mikhail Ulyanov; movie 
director Rolan Bykov; satiric poet Aleksandr Ivanov; writer 
Fazil Iskander; and others.

  [Text] Ex-first vice premier and leader of the Russia's 
Choice reform bloc Yegor Gaydar criticized the new government 
for inactivity. Speaking about the new Cabinet, he said that 
"there is no government united by one idea or one logic." 
  "There is a group of leaders of different ministries 
concerned about the future of these ministries. In the absence 
of a central economic concept it is difficult and 
psychologically impossible to withstand the lobbyists' demands 
coming from everywhere," he told the newspaper Izvestiya. 
  To quote Gaydar, the old government managed to prevent 
hyperinflation, although inflation fever continues to torment 
the economy. The situation in foreign trade has changed and 
exports far exceed imports. The hard-currency reserve 
considerably increased: whereas at the end of 1991 the state 
treasury was almost empty, by the end of 1993 Russia's 
hard-currency reserves exceeded $4.5 Bn. 
  The absolute deadlock in November 1991 was overcome avoiding 
an economic collapse, civil war and dictatorship, he said. 
  He also said that his faction in the State Duma would 
rigorously and consistently work for broadening the citizens' 
right to individual and collective self-defense, toughening 
punishment for crimes and for involvement in organized crimes. 
  In the current situation, a humane attitude to criminals at 
their victims' expense is at best out of place. I mean the 
decree on amnesty. Society will challenge such a decree and 
will be quite right, stated Gaydar.

"Reformers, Unite! Yegor Gaydar Appeals to Leaders of Reformist 
and Democratic Organizations"] 
  [Text] The elections for the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly, the appeal says, have shown convincingly that a 
weighty reason for the extreme reactionary political forces' 
relative success was the inability or unwillingness of various 
democratic blocs and parties to agree on genuine coordination of 
their actions. Sergey Baburin, Yuriy Vlasov, Aleksandr Nevzorov, 
and many others of their ilk broke into the State Duma because 
of a lack of coordination in our activity. The cost of what 
might be a "genetic" whim of Russian democrats is the 
considerable worsening of political and economic instability and 
uncertainty in the country. 
  Have we drawn lessons from what has happened? 
  The experience of the very first regional elections shows 
that we have not. Again, one "revenge-seeking" candidate is 
opposed by at least three or four democratic ones, clinched in 
much more heated polemics with each other than with him. Unless 
we break this tradition, local elections may bring about the 
recreation of the old Soviet power under new names. 
  Yegor Gaydar proposed that a joint election campaign 
strategy 
be worked out as early as the next two or three weeks. The 
experience of the December elections has shown that relying on 
the withdrawal of the already nominated candidates would be 
utopian. This is why the following principle should be agreed 
upon: one candidate from all the democratic and reformist 
forces for one mandate. 
  To implement this principle, they may reach agreement on 
regional quotas for each organization. Comparative results of 
the electoral support enjoyed by the associations in specific 
regions could also serve as indicators.

  [Text] It has transpired from sources at the Russian 
Democratic Reform Movement [RDRM] leadership that a draft 
directive on the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation has 
been presented to President Boris Yeltsin. Some time ago, RDRM 
Chairman Gavriil Popov advanced this initiative at the 
movement's congress. According to the sources, the Public 
Chamber is to be set up to ensure coordination between the 
Russian Federation federal executive agencies and public 
associations, to draw up presidential and government decisions 
on the most important social and political matters taking into 
account public opinion, and to create a feedback channel between 
public association and state authorities. It is expected that 
if the directive is signed the first meeting of the Public 
Chamber may take place as early as one of the last 10 days of 
February.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin's chief aide said 
the aim of the current reform of the presidential staff was to 
ensure its maximum efficiency. 
  Viktor Ilyushin, in an exclusive interview given to Interfax 
on Saturday, said news media reports that one of the purposes of 
the reform was to put the Foreign Ministry and the power 
ministries outside the government structure were "a lot of 
rubbish." This should be clear to anyone who has any idea of 
how government works, he said. 
  He also denied media reports about the existence of "dual 
authority" in the presidential staff. "I am a member of 
presidential staff myself. (Chief of staff) Sergey Filatov and 
I have so many serious tasks to do that we have no time to go 
into such fibs," he said. 
  Ilyushin said there were many "complicated problems" that he 
and Filatov had been discussing in connection with the 
restructuring of the presidential staff. 
  He said he and Filatov would give their opinions on the new 
structure of the staff to journalists after the president 
approved it. 
  He said he regretted the fact that journalists, in search of 
sensation, sometimes represented their own conjectures as the 
truth. "I don't question journalists' right to comment even on 
facts which are insufficiently verified, but I don't think one 
can make such categorical statements about them," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Presidential Aide Georgiy Saratov by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given; from the 
"Novosti" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] This week was marked not only by sackings, but by 
appointments as well. Forty-six year old Georgiy Satarov was 
given the post of presidential aide. He is a Muscovite, and he 
graduated from the Moscow State Teachers Training College. He 
worked there until 1991, studying the application of 
mathematical methods to social sciences. After that he became 
head of the Center of Applied Political Research, which he 
himself had set up. Since 1993 he has been a member of the 
Presidential Council. He is married, and has two daughters. 
  [Correspondent] First of all, Georgiy Aleksandrovich, allow 
me to congratulate you on your appointment. But what made you 
stop being a freelance and become an official? 
  [Satarov] Possibly it is a Joan of Arc type complex: Who if 
not I? Because I know no other good reasons for a person with a 
good academic career and a more or less successful life to 
become a functionary. That is first. Second, there is, of 
course an element of a sort of basic curiosity. It is one thing 
to analyze and advise, and quite another thing to try and put 
things into practice. 
  [Correspondent] You automatically cease being a member of 
the 
Presidential Council? 
  [Satarov] Yes. 
  [Correspondent] What will your responsibilities be? 
  [Satarov] They will encompass a range of political issues 
connected with the interaction of the president with the Federal 
Assembly and with parties and public bodies; the problem of his 
constitutional powers in connection with the interaction between 
society and authority; the building of a civic society, etc. 
  [Correspondent] The president is presently reorganizing his 
staff, we all know this. Is the president trying to strengthen 
his home front as he sees Chernomyrdin's team becoming stronger?. 
  [Satarov] That is not the case for the simple reason that 
the 
reorganization of the administration that is to take place in 
the near future, as well as the new appointments that were made 
just now, mine included, were planned a very long time ago, even 
before the start of the elections. 
  [Correspondent] When the government is criticized do people 
criticize the president as well? 
  [Satarov] Yes and no. At present there is a certain 
distancing, of course. In particular, this is also connected 
with the constitution, this new system of powers. On the other 
hand, the president is responsible for the Cabinet, because the 
prime minister was chosen by him. So he cannot avoid 
responsibility completely, and it is clear that any criticism of 
the government also reflects upon the president, there can be no 
doubt about that.

statement under the "Politics" rubric: "Boris Yeltsin Realizes 
That It Is Better To Rely on Those Who Put Up Resistance, Says 
Georgiy Satarov, Aide to the Russian Federation President"] 
  [Text] The president has a range of political problems 
concerning relations with the Federal Assembly, parties, and 
public organizations. I have been called upon to help him in 
this work. My current role, that of presidential adviser, as I 
see it is basically a continuation of what I have done as a 
member of the Presidential Council, that is, to help the 
president collaborate with other bodies of power. 
  As for my specific steps, in the near future I plan to 
present to the president my program, my vision of the problems, 
but so far I would not like to talk about that. As I have said, 
I see my new role as creating a requisite political atmosphere 
where relations between the president and the Federal Assembly 
would be based on information flows coming from both sides. 
  As I mull over why Boris Yeltsin chose me as an aide, 
although I have far from always "expressed my full approval," I 
come to the conclusion that the president realizes that he needs 
to rely on those who put up resistance, who are not afraid to 
speak up and to defend their views.

  [Text] Analysis of the latest events in the Russian 
Federation shows that the executive power has either collapsed 
and can no longer rule in the country or it is consciously 
leading to mass protests in order to help the regions to release 
tension, Leader of the Russian Communist Party's faction in the 
State Duma, Gennadiy Zuganov, said at a press conference on 
Friday. 
  Zuganov mentioned the issue of non-payment to enterprises, 
unpreparedness for the cold weather, the reorganization of the 
power structures of the defense and former security ministries, 
and attempts to hinder the State Duma's activities among the 
factors deteriorating the situation. 
  According to Zuganov, the recently signed Russian-Georgian 
Treaty, which was not coordinated with the North Caucasian 
republics, was one of the most significant destabilizing 
factors. This treaty might stir up mass disturbances in North 
Caucasus, Zuganov pointed out.

  [Text] St. Petersburg, 10 Feb--"The situation in Russia 
will change drastically this year," Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) of Russia, 
stated today. He has arrived at the city on the Neva at the 
head of a group of LDPR deputies of the Russian parliament. He 
asserted that the LDPR was already prepared to form a new 
government since it "did not need to look for candidates for the 
top posts". 
  In his characteristic manner, the LDPR chairman warned 
journalists that they would be held responsible for attacks on 
his party and for discrediting its program and methods of work. 
He also threatened to take their television and radio 
microphones and their newspapers. 
  In order to strengthen the position of the LDPR, its leader 
again tried to exploit the problem of the position of the 
Russian-speaking population in the republics of the former USSR 
and also the foreign political aspects of the party's 
activities. In particular, Zhirinovskiy stated that he viewed 
relations with Japan and India as priorities. India, he 
asserted, "is prepared to feed and clothe the whole of Russia if 
it is allowed to have the products of the St. Petersburg 
military industrial complex."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Ivanidze report: "Zhirinovskiy's `Pirated' Book? </F>
Unliterary Passions Surrounding Last Dash to the 
South"] 
  [Text] "The publication of Vladimir Volfovich's book 
Last Dash to the South was pirated! Everything in it 
is distorted! This is a provocation!" the art critic Irina 
Sergeyevna Kulikova, who prepared Zhirinovskiy's text for 
publication, told IZVESTIYA. 
  This strange and unexpected statement by one of the most 
loyal supporters of the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia [LDPR] seems absurd. In the four months since its 
publication the book has caused Zhirinovskiy and his comrades in 
arms nothing but delight. There is only one explanation for 
this contradiction -- the criminal investigation which the 
Russian General Prosecutor's Office started against Zhirinovskiy 
a few days ago. He may be charged under Article 71 of the Penal 
Code concerning war propaganda contained in the pages of "The 
Last Dash to the South." The real prospect of spending at least 
three years behind barbed wire is forcing Zhirinovskiy to look 
for a way out of the dangerous situation he has found himself 
in. It seems that it is specifically for this purpose that what 
at first appears to be a senseless scandal is now being hatched. 
  Ms. Kulikova claims that the book's "sponsors" have 
perpetrated a forgery. Her arguments sound pretty strange and 
even illogical, however. "You can see places in the book which 
have been purposely printed in boldface so as to attract the 
attention of corrupt journalists, like you IZVESTIYA 
journalists," Ms. Kulikova said. Struck by the typeface, I asked 
her about these evil sponsors. "I am not going to give you 
their names, but, believe me, they are to blame for everything!" 
came the answer. 
  Apart from the "boldface" in certain places, Ms. Kulikova 
drew attention to two other terrible circumstances. 
"Zhirinovskiy's real text contains bits of his speeches, and we 
removed all the repetitions. But in the pirated book, the text 
looks as though Vladimir Volfovich keeps saying the same thing, 
over and over!" 
  Irina Sergeyevna's bitter observation is entirely just, but 
only from the viewpoint of an art critic. Maybe she does not 
know that deliberate repetitions in the structure of a speech 
were considered to be the most successful propagandist device, 
even among orators in ancient Greece. After all, the crowd does 
not hear, it feels. In order for the sense of what has been said 
to be brought home, the same thing has to be drummed into it 
several times. 
  Carried away by the conversation, Ms. Kulikova said that she 
personally placed the floppy containing the text of the book in 
the "sponsors'" hands. This text was simply dictated by 
Zhirinovskiy. On Kulikova's own admission, she is not so much 
his editor as a proofreader, and she never changes the sense of 
what has been said. From the day of publication and up until 
the end of January, when the investigators from the General 
Prosecutor's Office finally got down to reading the book, it did 
not enter anyone's head that this was a forgery. Even 
Zhirinovskiy's head. Aside from that, there are more rational 
proofs of identity. 
  The secret "sponsors" are in fact indicated at the end of 
Zhirinovskiy's book -- the "Pisatel" Limited Partnership and the 
"Bukvitsa" Publishing Cooperative. It was they who put in an 
order at Moscow Printing Works No. 13 to publish the book. 
  As Yuliya Mikhaylovna Lobacheva, chief of the production 
department of this printing works, assures us, the clients' 
license was perfectly in order. Admittedly, of the 75,000 
copies of Last Dash to the South ordered, the 
printing works only printed 35,000. 
  "You see, we do not take orders without prepayment, and 
they only paid for half of the print run. We printed 34,000 in 
the normal cover, and another 1,000 in a prepublication cover, 
just as they asked. Aside from that, I do not understand how 
this book can be `pirated' if Zhirinovskiy waves it around at 
every news conference he holds," Ms. Lobacheva said. 
  These 1,000 copies -- in the prepublication version -- were 
sold to deputies in the State Duma. From this you can conclude 
that Zhirinovskiy is unbelievably prudent in matters of 
propaganda. But the interference of the General Prosecutor's 
Office upset some of his plans. The sale of the book within the 
walls of the State Duma, organized by the LDPR leader, in no way 
squares with the idea of a "pirated" publication. In any case, 
Zhirinovskiy in no way looks like a victim here. But Ms. 
Kulikova is so keen on the piracy theme that she has completely 
rejected the fact of the sale of the book in the State Duma. 
  "Don't believe it, it's lies!" the art critic exclaimed. 
"There is no such book as Last Dash to the South and 
there never has been. This is only the second part of 
Zhirinovskiy's trilogy On the Fate of Russia ripped 
out of context! That book will be on sale soon." 
  Let us sum up. So, no one has changed the essence of the 
published text but, admittedly, objections have been made about 
the typeface. This is evidently not enough to confuse the 
investigators from the General Prosecutor's Office. 
Particularly since the title page of Last Dash to the 
South bears the "V.V. Zhirinovskiy" copyright symbol. 
Maybe this is a completely different "V.V."? It does not seem 
possible to ask Zhirinovskiy himself about this. Irina 
Sergeyevna reported with great satisfaction that he is demanding 
$100 per minute for interviews. At rates like that you could 
never save up enough money to get to see the LDPR leader. 
Incidentally, this constitutes illegal operations with foreign 
currency. Article 88 of the Russian Federation Penal Code goes 
as far as execution by firing squad. After you have paid your 
taxes, of course. 
  But long before my conversation with Ms. Kulikova I had the 
good fortune to meet with Mr. Vengerovskiy, chief of the LDPR's 
intelligence unit. In his boss's office he handed me a copy of 
Last Dash to the South with the words: "Here you 
will find the answers to all questions!" The cunning nature of 
the journalist and the feeling of simple human vanity did the 
intelligence agent a bad turn, and he gladly left a dedication 
and his autograph on the sleeve. 
  Irina Sergeyevna's reaction to the story about my meeting 
with Vengerovskiy and his autograph suggests to me that the 
General Prosecutor's Office will not find it easy going. She 
immediately changed her stance and started to defend the pirated 
book, stating that there is no war propaganda in it and that no 
one intends to attack Turkey or Iran. 
  "Vladimir Volfovich has always been opposed to weapons. He 
is simply proposing to station Russian military settlements in a 
corridor leading to the Indian Ocean. You would have to know 
history. The Cossacks have always defended the Russian state's 
borders," Ms. Kulikova stated. 
  The fact that Turkey and Iran, as well as Georgia, 
Azerbaijan, and Armenia, which have inadvertently found 
themselves in that "corridor," do not consider themselves to be 
part of Russia was not taken into consideration by Irina 
Sergeyevna. What would happen in that "corridor" is obvious to 
an idiot. 
  Quests for "pirates" and "sponsors" are not preventing Irina 
Sergeyevna from now being involved in gathering orders for the 
translation and publication of the book abroad. 
  "We have had such offers from Britain, Japan, and the United 
States. But we will choose the ones which are most profitable 
for us. Those who pay the most will get the publishing rights. 
Admittedly, I do not remember how many offers we have had and 
which publishing houses they came from, but we have had offers. 
One of Russia's representatives at the United Nations is 
conducting talks on our behalf with American publishers. It 
doesn't matter what his name is!" Ms. Kulikova stressed. 
  The latest publication offer came from Paris recently. A 
small French publishing house, F2F, has decided to publish the 
book Last Dash to the South. The publishing house 
department which is fortuitously called "Material Evidence" is 
already prepared to get down to the translation. 
  When Rene Bousquet, an old French collaborationist, was 
shot in Paris, F2F found and published his anti-Semitic 
resolutions drawn up under the Vichy regime, during World War 
II. This publishing house recently published the last issue of 
PRAVDA when it was banned by Yeltsin during the October events 
in Moscow. 
  Incidentally, something about the expected royalties and the 
right to publish. If Ms. Kulikova is telling the truth and 
Zhirinovskiy himself confirms the "piracy" of the book "Last 
Dash for the South Seas," then the French will be able to 
publish it without paying the LDPR leader a centime.

  [Text] Petrozavodsk February 11 TASS--Thirty three years 
ago the former Soviet Union dumped thousands of tonnes of 
chemical shells in northern seas and scientists fear the secret 
burial grounds may be the reason for a high mortality rate among 
the local population, according to a Russian daily which quoted 
a participant of the secret dumping operation. 
  Ero Pavilainen, a resident of the northern Russian city of 
Petrozavodsk, served in early 60's in a military unit near the 
town of Pechenga, close to the Norwegian border. He told the 
Petrozavodsk-based newspaper "NORTHERN COURIER" on Friday that 
he and other soldiers had unloaded numerous railway cars with 
bombs with mustard gas. 
  "These were the Soviet chemical weapons accumulated since 
the 
(World) War (Two). They were delivered by trains from various 
military units of the Soviet Union and dumped in the Arctic 
Ocean", Pavilainen was quoted as saying. 
  The newspaper added that measurements taken by experts in 
certain parts of the White Sea showed that the water and soil 
there are contaminated and unsuitable for living organisms. 
  It added that the secret burial places of chemical weapons 
may be the reason for a high mortality rate, especially among 
newborns, registered in several settlement along the coast.

  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin says the 
government has no plans of adopting new programs and that the 
question is one of building on the existing concept. 
  Speaking on Friday, he told the leaders of West Siberian 
trade unions, which threaten a strike over pay delays, to 
consider the workers' demands when developing a new social and 
economic policy. At the same time, Chernomyrdin made it clear he 
would not bow to the threat of strikes and would take "unpopular 
measures" if need be. 
  He called for defaults to be negotiated between consumers, 
producers and the unions by way of agreements on prices, tariffs 
and wages, saying the government had no money to oblige their 
demands. 
  Leader of the trade unions federation of the Kuznetsk 
coal-mining region Anatoliy Chekis said he was dissatisfied with 
the outcome of talks with the prime minister who had failed to 
give a coherent answer to the questions in hand. 
  However, he suggested Chernomyrdin may not have been 
informed 
"about our demands though we sent them before." If wages are 
not paid in time, "there will be a social explosion," he said. 
  Employment Minister Gennadiy Melikyan and union activists 
are 
to hold more talks on Saturday.

  [Text] Moscow, 11 Feb -- The head of the Russian Government 
has issued an instruction that the state's debts to the 
coalminers should be settled immediately. Viktor Chernomyrdin 
issued this directive to the Russian Federation Finance Ministry 
after this morning's meeting with coal-industry managers and 
trade-union leaders. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin also proposed that a study should be 
made 
of the idea of gradually paying off the debts to the coalminers 
by means of bills of exchange that would be freely accepted for 
encashment by the Russian Central Bank.

  [Text] Moscow February 11 TASS -- "The present situation in 
the Russian economy is difficult but not disastrous," Premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday at a meeting with Siberian 
trade union activists and workers who intended to inform the 
cabinet head of the deplorable situation in industry and low 
living standards in Siberia. 
  Chernomyrdin promised them to take into account all their 
requirements concerning the social and economic situation in 
Siberia when finalising the federal budget for 1994, the main 
parameters of which will be made public in the Russian 
president's message to parliament on February 18. 
  The premier said that the draft provides for a big federal 
budget deficit which, in his opinion, was caused above all by 
the continued industrial slump in Russia. To prevent the 
acceleration of the slump and inflation, Chernomyrdin said that 
it was necessary to conclude an agreement between producers, 
trade unions and consumers on fixing prices, tariffs and wages. 
The premier sees a non-monetary approach of pulling the country 
out of the crisis in such an agreement. 
  Representatives of Siberian unions and workers squarely put 
the question of settling, at long last, the problems of debts to 
enterprises, timely payments of wages to civil servants, 
legislative guarantees of the general tariff agreement, changes 
of the taxation system in the country and payments of debts to 
peasants. 
  The prime minister promised that all proposals on state 
financing will be undoubtedly taken into account when finalising 
the federal budget for 1994. As for debts for agricultural 
products purchased by the state from peasants last autumn, 
totalling some 1,000 billion roubles, payments will start 
literally in the next few days, the premier assured. At the 
same time, he warned that the state will not fully pay all debts 
at once. 
  The prime minister stressed that the government intends, in 
future too, to take utmost efforts for social maintenance of 
poor segments of population and civil servants as well as to 
examine closely possibilities of creating new jobs. He also 
spoke against holding strikes at this difficult time for the 
country.

  [Text] Moscow February 10 TASS -- The draft budget for 1994 
will be finalised in the near future, Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Thursday at a meeting with 
representatives of the parliamentary bloc New Regional Policy, 
which has the second largest faction in the State Duma. 
  The faction members who represent the interests of Russian 
regions brought up the problem of non-payments, state support 
for the Far North, inflation and the problem of refugees at the 
meeting. 
  Chernomyrdin said that the draft budget for 1994 may 
envisage 
a "big deficit." He urged the enterprises to provide their 
guarantees that they will continue making vital products in the 
required volume. 
  He stressed the need to foster closer "working" ties between 
the government and the Federal Assembly.

  [Text] Valentin Sergeyev, the head of the government press 
service, has described information saying that a group of 
economists, including Shatalin, Abalkin, Saburov, and Lvov, are 
working on alternative programs for restructuring the economy on 
the orders of the government as not corresponding to reality. 
The course of reforms and the plan of measures aimed at 
implementing them was adopted in August last year at a sitting 
of the Council of Ministers and endorsed by the president. This 
course remains unchanged, the statement says. A working group 
has been set up by the government to draw up a plan of urgent 
and high priority measures and actions for this year. It is 
headed by Sergey Vasilyev, deputy economics minister. It 
examines every proposal submitted by scientists and 
industrialists irrespective of their stance, the statement by 
Sergeyev notes. The group will submit a corresponding document 
to the head of the government having taken into account the 
proposals and a message from the Russian president to the 
Federal Assembly, which is to be made public on 18 February.

  [Text] The prominent economist and leader of the Yavlinskiy 
bloc, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, has said that, as a result of the 
policy pursued by Russia's government in 1992-1993, the monthly 
rates of inflation had reached 25% to 30%, the 
budget deficit 
in real terms reached about 20% of the Gross National 
Product, 
and the ruble rate fell from 100 to 1600 rubles for one dollar. 
  According to Yavlinskiy, in the current year the slump in 
production will make up about 50% against 1989. In 1993 
industrial investment was virtually nil, and the outflow of 
foreign currency to the West totaled 15 billion dollars. 
  Analysing the complicated political situation in the 
country, 
Yavlinskiy said in an interview with the Nezavisimaya 
(Independent) Gazeta that under the circumstances Russia's 
government, no matter who leads it, is virtually in no position 
to do anything constructive. 
  "Since the political crisis is bottomless, on the whole no 
good can be expected from the present government," Yavlinskiy 
said.

  [Text] Moscow, 11 Feb -- Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy 
prime minister of the Russian Federation Government, has 
admitted that the government has partly lost control of the 
economy through financial and credit resources. 
  Speaking today at an expanded session of the collegium of 
the 
Ministry of Fuel and Energy Resources, the first deputy prime 
minister also said that "the problem of non-payments with which 
the Russian economy is afflicted has not yet been studied very 
well." He commented critically on the current pricing and tax 
policy. "It ought to unite and not separate the government and 
the producers," he said. 
  Oleg Soskovets sees one of the principal goals of the 
present 
cabinet in "creating conditions that will enable producers and 
consumers to agree among themselves normally." 
  The first deputy prime minister said that the credit and 
finance system needed adjustment, as did the banking system. He 
called upon specialists working in the fuel and energy complex 
to pursue "a policy of partnership with other industries." 
Otherwise we will be unable to form a civilized market, he said. 
  In the opinion of Oleg Soskovets, active attempts were being 
made "to discredit the policy of reforms, especially after some 
members of the previous cabinet left the government." But "no 
one talks about skilled workers and managers leaving, though it 
is they who make the whole economy tick," he added.

  [Text] Moscow February 12 TASS -- A Cyclone-3 space booster 
rocket carried six satellites in the Cosmos series -- the 
Cosmos-2,268 -- Cosmos-2,273 of the low-orbit satellite 
communications system, at 11.54 Moscow time from the Plesetsk 
cosmodrome on Saturday. 
  The launch was conducted by Russia's Space Defence Forces 
(SDF) in the interests of the Russian Defence Ministry. 
  The launch was successful. All the six satellites are 
following flight paths close to the pre-calculated ones and are 
being controlled by the main centre for Cosmos satellite control 
and testing, a spokesman at the SDF press centre told ITAR-TASS. 
  The Cosmos-2,269 has become the 1,800th satellite launched 
into a low-earth orbit from Plesetsk over the 28 years of the 
existence of Russia's northern cosmodrome.

"Crimea"] 
  [Text] The Crimean president has been continuing to form 
his administration, which will include 40 assistants and 
advisers. Observers think it is a very large staff. In 
addition, the president as a head of state and of the executive 
branch has the entire Crimean Council of Ministers at his 
disposal. As a matter of fact, on 8 February Yuriy Meshkov had 
separate meetings with the power ministers and the rest of the 
Republic of Crimea's government members. No information about 
the results of the meetings, however, has been made public. 
Participants in the meetings have said to your NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA correspondent that Meshkov told them that he had come 
without his own team and asked them all to stay on in their 
offices. 
  On 10 February, when Meshkov was absent, various people from 
the presidential administration called Crimean Economy Minister 
Tatyana Shandra four times during the day. They demanded that a 
fact sheet on the state of affairs in the peninsula be drawn up 
and her proposals for ways to lift the economy out of the crisis 
be presented. Tatyana Shandra told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent that the documents had been prepared.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 12 Feb -- Ukraine's Defense Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy arrived in the city on the occasion of the 
flag-hoisting on board the new anti-submarine ship "Lutsk". 
This is already the second visit by the minister to Sevastopol, 
however, this time his meeting with the Black Sea Fleet 
Commander Eduard Baltin again failed to take place. 
  Replying to a question from the journalists on whether the 
statement by President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov, on the beginning 
of the peninsula's demilitarization at the expense of reducing 
Ukraine's Armed Forces in the Crimea would cause aggravation of 
Ukrainian-Russian relations, Vitaliy Radetskyy stated that such 
decisions are outside Yuriy Meshkov's competence. Only the 
president and the Supreme Council of Ukraine can take such 
decisions. 
  Vitaliy Radetskyy told the journalists about the development 
of the naval forces. The headquarters and the main naval base 
will be in Sevastopol. The defense minister positively assessed 
Ukraine's accession to the "Partnership for Peace." He pointed 
to the erroneous nature of the idea that the Black Sea Fleet was 
almost the only guarantor of Ukraine's security. "The guarantor 
of Ukraine's security is its people," pointed out the defense 
minister. 
  Replying to the journalists' questions, Vitaliy Radetskyy, 
in 
particular, stated that in solving the fate of the fleet one 
should, first and foremost, draw up an inventory of the fleet 
and carry out its reduction.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Bizhan by Marat </F>
Pohorelov; place and date not given; from the "Independence" 
program -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Pohorelov] Many lances have been broken on the 
issue of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine. The concrete 
steps toward the resolution of this issue are often assessed 
without taking into account the actual reality and the set of 
all existent factors, that is to say, in a one-sided parochial 
view. Therefore, the issue returns once and again to be viewed 
in our programs. Today we will take a look at this with the help 
of General Colonel Ivan Bizhan, deputy defense minister. 
  [Bizhan] Despite the fact that a great deal has been said 
about this issue in the press, television, and on the radio, 
many people are still interested in it. I would like to say one 
more time that not a treaty but a declaration and an annex to 
this declaration were signed by the presidents of Ukraine, the 
Russian Federation, and the United States in Moscow. There are 
no significant discrepancies between this declaration and the 
Supreme Council resolution on ratifying the START I treaty. I 
would also want to emphasize that Ukraine's nuclear disarmament 
issue involves the United States as well. This is exactly what 
we have wanted from the very beginning, when we began to address 
this issue. 
  Carefully looking at the annex to the statement signed by 
the 
presidents, one can see that the Russian Federation for the 
first time committed to service the nuclear warheads deployed in 
Ukraine, and which, according to the agreement, will be 
gradually transferred to Russia for dismantling. This is also 
one of the problems which we had been trying to solve, but which 
Russia had been refusing to solve, intending to exert pressure 
on Ukraine through this or to force it to adopt certain 
decisions. You know that we ourselves cannot maintain these 
nuclear warheads. Now, one does not have to convince anybody 
that the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine are our property. 
As you remember, one had to do this until recently, because the 
Russian Federation by no means wanted to admit that. It claimed 
that these weapons once belonged to the Soviet Union, and now 
they should be inherited by the Russian Federation. Therefore, 
it considered itself the only inheritor of these nuclear 
weapons. Now, when this problem has ceased to exist, another one 
arises: What should our state do with these nuclear weapons 
inherited after the downfall of the Soviet Union? For example, 
what could be done with the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine? 
Some people say that Ukraine should be a nuclear state. If 
this problem is examined in the context of nuclear weapons 
deployed in Ukraine, then how can Ukraine become a nuclear 
state? If we agree with the Russian Federation that Russia will 
service the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine, and that it 
will replace nuclear warheads whose warranty and shelf life have 
expired, and that it will hand over to us the systems of 
control. However, while saying that, we should ask ourselves a 
question: Will Russia agree with that? Will the United States 
agree? Will other states agree? And a whole range of other 
questions. This is unreal. To link our nuclear weapons to the 
nuclear status of the state is the only way, however unreal. 
  Assuming that Ukraine should become a nuclear state, it will 
be necessary to adopt a resolution to establish an entire 
infrastructure which a nuclear state should have. We do not 
have such a structure. Specialists should give their opinion on 
whether it is possible or not to do this. Although they have 
already said a lot about this, let them say more. What will 
this involve; what problems will this cause; what costs are 
entailed? What will be the consequences of this decision? Do 
we need that? Will this increase our security? There are also 
other problems we should resolve in this regard. Thus, the 
nuclear weapons deployed on the territory of our state and the 
nuclear status of our state are two different issues. Now we 
should solve this issue. The declaration signed by the 
president of our state and the annex to it concern nuclear 
weapons that we inherited from the Soviet Union and we currently 
possess. However, while solving this issue, we should proceed 
from objective circumstances. No matter what we say and what 
decisions are adopted, the circumstances are dictating [their 
terms] now. What kind of circumstances? For example, every 
nuclear warhead has a certain warranty period. You know that 
President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk, at a news conference given 
at Boryspil airport following his return from Moscow, said that 
the warranties of all the nuclear weapons deployed in our state 
will expire in 1999 or 2000. However, they begin to expire as 
early as this year. Therefore, a certain number of nuclear 
warheads will surpass their shelf life this year. This means 
that we will have to deal with this problem every year. No 
matter what decisions we adopt, we should resolve the problem of 
nuclear weapons which have surpassed their shelf life. 
Actually, nuclear weapons are one of the powerful security 
guarantees for a state, but only if a state is really a nuclear 
one. 
  For example, if we had all those elements, or all that 
infrastructure that accounts for the status of a nuclear state, 
this would unquestionably be a guarantee of our security. 
However, the things are not like that. The nuclear weapons 
deployed in Ukraine today cannot be a guarantee of our security 
because these weapons are nothing more than our property. The 
entire control system, the entire production system, the entire 
servicing and testing system is in the Russian Federation. No 
matter what our desires are, this is true. For some reason, we 
have recently discussed only those nuclear weapons which are 
deployed on our territory, having in mind the problems, or 
aspects, of our security. However, we should not forget the 
fact that, with regard to conventional arms, to conventional 
armed forces, our state is the second power on the continent, 
after the Russian Federation. Is this not an aspect of our 
state's security? It is, and it is an aspect that we can 
maintain on such a level of combat readiness, which would allow 
our Armed Forces to defend our state. It could be done at the 
expense of resolving the issue of nuclear weapons which are now 
in Ukraine. First of all, I have in mind financial aspects, 
when we will be able to allot larger funds to our conventional 
Armed Forces. Therefore, I think that we should not forget 
about this issue, too. Besides, the issue of our state security 
is an issue of our integration with European structures, 
including the Partnership for Peace program adopted during the 
recent NATO session. We should participate. We should 
integrate with NATO and other structures. It will also be one of 
the guarantees of our security. 
  I do not want to mention such issues as friendly relations 
with other states, in particular, with neighboring states, or 
the resolution of our many heavy economic problems. The 
resolution of these problems will also grant us security 
guarantees. Having resolved the issue of nuclear weapons 
deployed in our state, we will be able to resolve those other 
problems and aspects that constitute the entire body of our 
state security. 
  [Pohorelov] Ivan Vasylyovich, let us close our interview 
with the following summation of the nuclear weapon issue in 
Ukraine today: One cannot be a king for only one day; one must 
also think about the future. 
  [Bizhan] Yes, you are right. Our status with regard to 
nuclear weapons, which are actually our property, is a temporary 
situation. This temporary situation will terminate at the end 
of the year of 2000. The number of nuclear warheads will be 
decreasing every year. No matter what resolution we adopt, the 
objective circumstances will drive us toward a reduction of 
nuclear warheads deployed on Ukraine's territory. It is because 
of objective circumstances and the connection with serious 
issues related to the nuclear and ecological security of our 
state. I do not think anyone will adopt a resolution which 
could bring tragedy, either nuclear or environmental.

<F P=106> [Article by Vilen Martirosyan, chairman of the Council of </F>
Ministers Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen: "What 
`Accomplishments' Turned Defense Minister's Head?"] 
  [Text] Presuming that a new stage of building the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces started after General V. Radetskiy 
assumed the post of defense minister, we must admit that at this 
stage the Army's social problems have not only exacerbated but 
also acquired a specific quality. Over the last two years, we 
spared no effort to return thousands of Ukrainian servicemen 
from the hotspots of the former USSR to Ukraine, in accordance 
with a presidential edict. About 20,000 servicemen returned 
home while we were expecting 150,000. 
  Thus, our expectations fell flat. Very rapidly, the number 
of those who wanted to serve in the Ukrainian Army dramatically 
plummeted. Today, a contrary process is gaining momentum: A 
mass drain of officers has started. Some 60 percent of young 
officers have recently requested dismissal. In Odessa Military 
District alone, some 2,500 officers resigned in 1992, while in 
1993 this figure increased by 30 percent. 
  It is sad that among those who do everything in their power 
to resign, there are many high-skilled professionals who only 
yesterday dreamed of coming back to Ukraine and continue serving 
under the national banner. 
  Enlisted men also do not wish to serve in our Army. Most 
military units are 30 percent under strength. Desertion 
continues to be a commonplace phenomenon. The number of young 
people who want to enter military high-education institutions 
has decreased threefold. Even those whose dissertations are 
almost ready are leaving. 
  What makes our servicemen shun the Army that we created? Of 
course, some of the reasons are widely known, including the 
acute housing problem (we have more than 80,000 homeless 
servicemen), low wages, and a dramatic downturn in the prestige 
of the military profession. 
  However, there is another reason which is equally important. 
The point is that over a long period of time, officers have 
been living in a state of uncertainty. They feel that nobody 
needs their professional skills. What will happen to them 
tomorrow? What does the upcoming reduction of the Army have in 
store for them? Will their social problems be resolved? Nobody 
gives them any answers. Besides, the Army has no ideological 
platform, which in turn causes complete confusion. 
  The servicemen's uncertainty is aggravated with serious 
mistakes made by the Defense Ministry leadership in the sphere 
of personnel policy. In the initial stage of forming the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces, at the initiative of the Officers' Union 
led by General Major V. Mulyava, an open purge of the officers' 
corps was carried out. Preference was given to people 
recommended by those political forces that supported General 
Colonel K. Morozov. 
  Since General V. Radetskyy came to the Army, there have been 
attempts to improve the situation. However, very soon, 
ministerial offices were manned by people from the new 
minister's team. Incidentally, these people do not always have 
necessary education and experience. 
  For example, we once resolutely opposed the policies of 
General V. Mulyava who arranged it so that specialists employed 
in his department were not responsible for anything. Nobody was 
allowed to hold them responsible for desertion of soldiers, 
hazing of conscripts, or conflicts in military units. We hoped 
that the appointment of General V. Kobzar would bring positive 
changes. However, the ministry has started to form bodies that 
resemble former political departments, which is even more 
dangerous than former inaction. 
  People in the Army are enraged by the fact that military 
colleges that had a long tradition of training officers are 
being closed down and their property looted. At the same time, 
it is hard to understand why the ministry appoints a 
professional commander who has no concept of resolving 
pedagogical and scientific problems to the post of Department of 
Military Education chief. This person's lack of flexibility can 
do more harm than former chiefs' activities. 
  It is hard to put up with the return of those military 
chiefs 
who were lying in wait while our Army was being built. Today, 
they all rushed to divide the spoils of victory. This leads to 
never ending reshuffles and fights for cushy jobs. 
  I understand that this overabundance of generals seems 
quite natural to Defense Ministry officials, but among the 
military this trend meets with ever growing indignation. 
Officers keep asking me: Is this a feast in times of trouble 
or intoxication with success? Are the degeneration of military 
training in units, the deterioration of combat readiness, and 
the destruction of the system of military education considered 
accomplishments? 
  I understand perfectly well that General V. Radetskiy is 
making his first steps in his new post and it would be unfair to 
blame everything on him. I also understand that after the 
publishing of this article I am going to become an object of 
harsh criticism. 
  However, being one of those who initiated the fight for the 
creation of a new Ukrainian Army, I cannot put up with the fact 
that our most elated ideals may be rejected as worthless junk 
and buried under the trash of personal ambitions and militant 
nonprofessionalism. I am grieved to see that having discarded 
many useful things that existed in the Soviet Army, we have 
inherited solely its negative traits. The people hoped that we 
would build an Army from which servicemen would return home 
unharmed, where officer's honor would be the most valuable 
virtue, and where brotherhood in arms would not be a meaningless 
phrase. It seems that today, we are farther from this ideal 
than we were two years ago. 
  The Committee for the Social Protection of Servicemen is not 
going to turn a blind eye to these drawbacks. We will continue 
to fight for rooting out these disgraceful phenomena, even if 
somebody does not like this. 
  The Defense Ministry Chief Personnel Directorate can serve 
as 
a vivid example of an over-staffed department. In the former 
Soviet Army, 100 specialists were dealing with personnel issues 
of servicemen deployed in three military districts. The same 
number of officers led by Lieutenant General A. Ignatenko 
resolved the complex issues of the formation of the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces. Right now, when the numerical strength of the 
Army has been reduced twofold, the number of personnel clerks 
has doubled. 
  The race for ranks and posts has reached exorbitant 
dimensions. I remember how we were planning that there would be 
no more than 100 generals in the Ukrainian Army. However, as 
early as this year, there are more than 300 of them. Thirty two 
officers were promoted to the rank of general on Ukrainian Army 
Day alone. I want to point out that there are only 200 generals 
in all of NATO. 
  We have become accustomed to breakneck careers. The 
unheard-of promotion of V. Mulyava from sergeant to general has 
become the talk of the town, but the fact that V. Kobzar in 
three months covered the distance between colonel to lieutenant 
general is also far from normal. I, for one, was a regiment 
commander for 13 years before being promoted to general. 
  K. Paustovskiy once wrote that in times of flourishing, 
states produce heroes and in times of decline -- bureaucrats.

<F P=106> [Report by Ivan Hladki on speech by Prime Minister </F>
Vyacheslav Kebich on 11 February; place not given -- Kebich's 
remarks recorded] 
  [Text] [Hladki] Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
delivered a speech to journalists today to clarify the statement 
of the Belarusian Government on the recent events in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. These events concern every honest person, 
the prime minister emphasized. Therefore, the Belarusian 
Government decided to issue this statement, he stressed. 
  [Kebich] The Republic of Belarus is extremely concerned with 
the latest explosion in Sarajevo on 5 February, which increases 
the aggressiveness and escalates the tension of the conflict. 
The Republic of Belarus, as well as all mankind, condemns the 
forces who carried out this extremely cruel operation. Belarus 
thinks that such actions cannot be currently tolerated, 
especially as the issue of settling this crisis is the focus of 
attention of the United Nations, the EC, and other regional 
organizations as they look for political ways of settling the 
dispute. Under these conditions, Belarus was and is 
consistently and decisively adhering to nonforceful methods of 
alleviating the crisis. The resolution of this conflict can 
only be based on a thorough investigation and analysis of the 
events that occurred, on joint consultations under UN Security 
Council guidance and that of other regional international 
organizations. Under the increased tension, the involved 
parties should demonstrate extreme caution, political wisdom, 
and, to the greatest degree possible, restrain from military 
action. This policy will be the best option for the interests 
of all the states of Europe and the world. 
  [Hladki] Then Vyacheslav Frantsevich added: 
  [Kebich] We proceed from the thought that if the air strikes 
are carried out, this could actually divide not only Europe but 
the entire world as well. Moreover, we had a sour experience 
when World War I began with a similar conflict in the same 
region. Therefore, the Republic of Belarus considers that this 
conflict could be settled by peaceful methods. Even if these 
events have not been excited by someone else, they would not 
have happened at all. [sentence as heard] 
  [Hladki] Participants in this meeting also discussed a 
political strike which is being prepared by certain political 
circles in Belarus. Though the Cabinet of Ministers has already 
published a statement on this issue, Vyacheslav Kebich stated: 
  [Kebich] The strike, which is scheduled for 15 February, is 
of a purely political character. Its aim is to forcibly seize 
power by using the people. Many people have already sorted out 
this situation as to who heads this political action. 
Industrial trade unions have behaved correctly, because they 
understood the political character of this strike and [words 
indistinct]. I must say that this political action is carried 
by someone's very dirty hands. [Words indistinct] we try to do 
everything to avoid incidents. We know that the main aim of 
this political strike is to frustrate the government and trigger 
various incidents. However, this will not happen. Rumors of 
our readiness to use troops and special militia detachments are 
a simple provocation and a lie that are directed first and 
foremost against the government. I must say that I do not see 
any danger for the government [words indistinct]. The 
government is working and performing its functions. As for the 
measures to prevent the strike, they can only be legal.

  [Text] The unification of the Belarusian and Russian 
monetary systems does not mean that Belarus will advance towards 
market relations the Russian way, stated Belarusian Prime 
Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. 
  He told Interfax in an exclusive interview that the 
forthcoming unification of the two monetary systems should not 
be viewed as a political-economic union. "Neither is it true 
that Belarus and Russia have betrayed the idea of creating a 
single economic system within the CIS," he said. "On the 
contrary, by uniting our monetary systems we are giving a real 
content to this idea, and strengthen and broaden the common 
economic system," he added. 
  He said that the recent reshuffling in the government will 
not tell on the Belarusian policies. "As to the monetary union 
with Russia, it will allow Belarus to advance towards market 
relations more rapidly," said Kebich. He admitted that the 
resignation of Shushkevich had not made the prime minister's 
work any easier, but gave to understand that Shushkevich's 
resignation from the post of parliament speaker had opened the 
door on the ratification of the CIS agreement on collective 
security by the Belarusian parliament. 
  Speaking about cuts in the Belarusian offensive weapons, 
Kebich said that if Belarus was not given financial assistance 
in disarmament, it would not be able to eliminate tanks and 
aircraft at the old rate according to international agreements. 
He said that Belarus bore all of the related expenses on its 
own. 
  The economic problems complicate the financing of the 
disarmament program, said Kebich. He also pointed out that 
Belarus was honestly and consistently implementing its 
commitments to cut down armaments and would continue to do so in 
the future.

  [Text] Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Russian 
Border Troops, and Yawgen Bacharow, commander of the Belarus 
Border Troops, initialled the draft of an intergovernmental 
agreement on border questions at their meeting in Zaslavl. Here 
is Yuriy Sverko, our Minsk correspondent with the details. 
  Bacharow did not rule out the possibility that this 
agreement 
could be signed by the prime ministers of the two countries 
during Viktor Chernomyrdin's forthcoming visit to Minsk. 
Nikolayev stated at a news conference in Zaslavl that this was 
the first such agreement between Russia and another CIS country. 
  Replying to a question from the correspondent about the 
future of the Russian-Belarus border, Nikolayev said: If not 
just [Belarus] national interests but also Russian interests are 
protected on the borders between Belarus and non-Commonwealth 
states and the interests of Belarus are protected on Russian 
borders, if the heads of government sign the document that has 
been initialled, then totally new relations will begin and there 
will be no reason for having any special regime on the border 
between Russia and Belarus. 
  In the opinion of the head of Russia's Federal Border 
Service, the border with Belarus should be open. This will 
require the drawing together of the two countries' laws and 
other normative documents, the coordination of customs services 
activities and health control. If the internal borders of the 
CIS are to be closed, Nikolayev noted, then the economic 
alliance between the countries of the Commonwealth will never 
begin to operate properly. 
  At the meeting near Minsk there was also discussion on the 
question of creating identical border regimes on Russia's and 
Belarus' borders with Latvia and Lithuania. Nikolayev said that 
the Russian Federation was ready to carry out an expert 
examination of the work carried out in Belarus and to pay its 
share. This, Bacharow stated, would comprise up to 50 percent 
of Belarus' expenditure in building and equipping installations 
on the borders with the Baltic countries.

<F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondent Larisa Lazar for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Minsk, 10 Feb -- The current socioeconomic crisis in 
the republic is a direct consequence of destroying integration 
processes in the economy, says a statement which the Presidium 
of the Belarusian Council of Ministers adopted today. In this 
connection the document says that the "consistent and 
well-thought- out moves by the republic's government aimed at a 
close economic union with Russia mean, above all, a policy of 
common sense, socio- economic stabilization and overcoming the 
crisis". 
  As is known, an indefinite political strike is planned for 
15 
February. Its participants intend to demand the government's 
resignation, holding early elections to the Supreme Soviet and 
electing a government of national confidence. The Presidium of 
the Council of Ministers describes these demands as "political 
adventurism and violation of the constitution" and as an attempt 
by certain political forces "to drive the republic to chaos and 
to put it on the verge of civil confrontation". 
  "Calls for a political strike and social disobedience are 
nothing else but an attempt to eliminate the legally elected 
power," the statement says. The document also says that the 
sovereignty and independence of the state are being built on the 
basis of a solid economic foundation. The foundation cannot be 
laid by internal self-isolation and by trying to fence ourselves 
off from neighboring states with whom we have not only common 
history in the past and present but in the future as well. 
  The statement says "both fraternal peoples, close in their 
spirit, culture and history, equally need social stability at 
present. The guarantor of this stability is the economic union 
of the two states. The two states have natural interest in each 
other and will not allow any attempts to create political and 
human barriers between them."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Armenian President Levon </F>
Ter-Petrosyan by Amir Taheri in London on 10 February] 
  [Text] The Armenian president said yesterday that there 
are more than 2,000 "Afghan" fighters from various states in 
Azerbaijan taking part in the war around Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  In a press interview the Armenian president claimed that 500 
Turkish officers and some 1,000 officers and noncommissioned 
officers from the former Soviet republics are currently training 
the new Azerbaijani Army, which has recently achieved some 
success in the war, which has been going on for six years. 
  Levon Ter-Petrosyan says that he has received assurances 
from 
London that there are no British "mercenaries" with the 
Azerbaijan Armed Forces. There have been reports that Western 
oil companies which have interests in Azerbaijan are recruiting 
Britons to help the Baku government recover the land it has lost 
to the Armenians. 
  According to Western sources, the Armenians are occupying 
about 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory. Nearly 1 million 
Azerbaijanis, that is one-sixth of the country's population, 
have been driven out of their cities and villages. Many of them 
are refugees on the border with Iran. 
  Ter-Petrosyan said that the West and Russia must work 
together to end the conflict before it expands to include the 
entire region. 
  Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan concludes a four-day 
visit to Britain today. At a working breakfast yesterday the 
president answered questions put to him by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: 
  [Taheri] What is the aim of your visit to London? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] The main aim of my visit is to ask British 
Prime Minister John Major to raise the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh 
during his upcoming visit to Moscow. He has agreed to renew 
peace endeavors. 
  [Taheri] What exactly do you want to see happen in 
Nagorno-Karabakh? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] The ideal formula is for the people of 
Nagorno-Karabakh to obtain their right to self-determination. 
However, I am aware that the ideal formula cannot always be 
achieved. This is why we are looking for a compromise formula 
to end the war. We proposed that this aim be attained in three 
stages: First, a cease-fire. Second, consolidating the legal 
status of Nagorno-Karabakh through international arbitration, 
and that should be done in a manner that does not allow 
Azerbaijan to revoke or reverse the decision. And finally, 
lifting the blockade Azerbaijan is imposing on Armenia so as to 
coincide with the Armenian forces' withdrawal from the 
Azerbaijani territory it is currently occupying. 
  [Taheri] You maintain that your government is not 
interfering in the Nagorno-Karabakh war. In what circumstances 
will you intervene? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] An all-out war will take place if the 
Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh are exposed to the danger of mass 
deportation or mass murder. 
  [Taheri] Is that likely to happen? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] I hope not. But we have behind us a stormy 
and harsh history and we must always be on our guard. 
  [Taheri] Did you expect the current state of war and the 
terrible suffering inflicted on all parties when you set up the 
"Nagorno-Karabakh Committee" some six years ago? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Looking back from today's position often 
sheds a different light on historic events. However, let me 
tell you that we did not invent the Nagorno-Karabakh problem. 
It has existed since Stalin decided to offer it as a gift to 
Azerbaijan in 1921. The situation was going to explode there 
whether or not Armenia made a move. 
  [Taheri] It seems that you want a special role for Russia 
in the region. Does that mean the effective return of "big 
brother" to the field? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Yes. I must say that I understand that. 
There are Russian forces in all the former Soviet republics 
except Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Belarus. Russia will return 
because it can see that other players are trying to control its 
zones of influence. 
  [Taheri) What do you mean by "other players?" 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] NATO forces, and regionally Turkey and Iran. 
  [Taheri] How would you assess these players' role? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] The United States accepts Russia playing a 
peacekeeping role -- which is important. But Turkey and Iran 
have not achieved what they had hoped to achieve years ago, for 
example. 
  [Taheri] What about your relationship with Iran and Turkey? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Iran is a friendly state and a close 
partner. I am confident that that our relationship will deepen 
further. Iran has been neutral in the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, 
even though its public opinion naturally sympathizes with their 
Shiite Muslims in Azerbaijan. The West sees Iran as a state 
exporting fundamentalism. But it is in our region. Although it 
is an Islamic republic, it does not side with the Azerbaijani 
Shiites, whereas Turkey --- the secular government -- is 100 
percent behind Azerbaijan. We want normal relations with 
Turkey, because it is our neighbor. But Turkish leaders -- so 
it seems -- cannot act against the feelings aroused against us 
by the media services and other pressure groups there. 
Nevertheless, we will not give up hope. We wish to establish 
normal relations, regardless of the harsh past. 
  [Taheri] You dealt with several Azerbaijani presidents, 
including Ayaz Mutalibov, Geydar Aliyev, and Abdulfaz Elchibey. 
What is your opinion of these men? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] We had positive dealings with Mutalibov, but 
he was overthrown. Elchibey was the best one for us, because he 
angered both Iran and Russia, thus imposing isolation on 
himself. He naively played the Turkish nationalism card. Aliyev 
is the more intelligent and experienced. And he is trying to 
repair relations between Iran and Russia. 
  [Taheri] What is the role of oil in this conflict? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Azerbaijan has oil, and we get nothing from 
it. The West and Russia are interested in Azerbaijan's oil -- 
which is understood. But utilizing oil sources requires 
securing peaceful conditions first. Which is why everyone is 
seeking to end the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  [Taheri] You are subject to an Azerbaijani blockade. Where 
do you obtain vital supplies from? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Through Iran and Georgia by land and air. 
Of course, what we get is not sufficient, and our economy is 
suffering as a result of this situation. The blockade has 
prevented us from rebuilding what the earthquakes destroyed in 
cities and villages and putting the wheel of industry on the 
right track again. Our people are suffering a great deal. This 
reality is being exploited by former communists and other 
enemies of democracy. 
  [Taheri] I sense from your statements that you are 
pessimistic. Are we to understand that economic difficulties 
are compelling you to take a reconciliatory position on 
Nagorno-Karabakh? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] We have economic difficulties, but I am not 
broke. As for the reconciliatory position, we agreed on the 
framework set by the peace agreement in Minsk, and we insist on 
its speedy implementation. Our region needs peace more than 
anything else today. Everyone in our region wants peace. 
  [Taheri] A personal question: You and Kyrgyzstan President 
Askar Akayev are the only presidents in the former Soviet 
republics who have never been affiliated to the Comminist Party. 
Do you feel lonely and isolated at present? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] Even Akayev was a member of the Communist 
Party, but he was not among the high cadre. So I am really 
lonely. But all the people of Armenia support me.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Voronkov] </F>
  [Text] London February 12 TASS -- General principles for 
cooperation between the two countries are now being established. 
They found their manifestation in the signed declaration on 
basic principles for inter-state relations and in a number of 
other agreements, President Levon Ter-Petrosyan of Armenia told 
ITAR-TASS, summing up the results of his first official visit to 
Britain. 
  The Armenian president described it as very important that 
during the talks with Prime Minister John Major he received 
assurances about future support for Armenia in international 
financial organisations. 
  Problems concerning a settlement of the Karabakh conflict 
and 
Britain's relations with Azerbaijan were discussed during the 
meetings. London is interested in Azerbaijani oil. Therefore, 
one of the aims of the visit was to secure that this economic 
aspect of the problem has no negative political consequences for 
Armenia and that the British Government pursues a balanced 
policy promoting the establishment of peace, Ter-Petrosyan 
emphasised. Such promises were received. Moreover, Britain 
intends to make more active efforts in the Nagorno-Karabakh 
peace process in the near future, he added. 
  In this connection, British representatives were provided 
with detailed information about actions being undertaken within 
the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe and about Russia's proposals aimed at solving the 
Karabakh problem. 
  The Armenian president confirmed that Armenia and 
Nagorno-Karabakh supported the International Olympic Committee's 
proposal to declare an "Olympic truce" in the area of 
Azerbaijan-Karabakh confrontation for the period of the 1994 
Winter Olympics without any pre-conditions.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan, 11 Feb -- Armenia has been left completely 
without gas once again. Late on the night of 10 February, the 
only pipeline still supplying gas to the republic, which crosses 
the Georgian territory, was blown up once again. The ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told at the press service of the Armenian 
Government that the subversive act was committed at 2330 hours 
on 10 February near the river Khrami in Marneulskiy Rayon in the 
southeast of Georgia. A group of Armenian gas workers have been 
sent to the site to examine and repair the damaged section of 
the pipeline, the government said. 
  Gas supply to Armenia via Georgia had been cut off on the 
previous day. According to the Gruzgazprom association, this 
was caused by a drop in gas supply from Turkmenistan. The 
Armenian side says that at that point, Georgia was receiving 
9-10 million cubic meters of gas a day, while Armenia had been 
receiving 0.8 to 1.2 million cubic meters a day for the past two 
months. This tiny amount was just enough to satisfy the bare 
minimum of the needs of the Armenian economy, and first and 
foremost, vital facilities, such as hospitals, bakeries, 
transport, communications, and administrative offices. 
  Since yesterday noon, Yerevan residents have not had any 
electricity; in the afternoon, the subway was stopped. Domestic 
heating and hot water are unavailable. Despite the critical 
situation, 60 industrial enterprises have been working in 
Armenia today, and trams have been in operation in Yerevan. 
Buses have been standing idle in the Armenian capital due to 
lack of fuel.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 10, BNS -- The situation in the 
Estonian-Russian relations is grave, Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar said in an interview with BNS and the Estonian 
Television. 
  "Russia's recent statements make it clear that Moscow is 
attempting to effect a turnabout in its relations with Estonia," 
Laar said. "Already there's open talk about the insufficiency of 
diplomatic means to resolve the situation." 
  The premier said, however, that there's no reason for 
particular anxiety. 
  "Estonia will stick to the same steady and calm course as 
before," Laar said. "History teaches us this is the only way to 
make progress in relations with Russia. We intend also in the 
future to state our views to our eastern neighbor clearly and 
unambiguously. The government will not retreat from its policy." 
  The premier affirmed Estonia doesn't intend to conclude with 
Russia any pact on the lines of the 1939 agreement on military 
bases. "Those forces in Russia that hope for it hope in vain," 
he said. 
  Foreign Minister Juri Luik said today in a comment on 
Estonian- Russian relations that there's no reason for panic. 
"But Russia's leaders must be shown calmly, through clear 
foreign political moves, what the bounds of international 
behavior are," he stated. 
  Vaino Reinart, head of the Estonian delegation for talks 
with 
Russia, told BNS Russia's stepping up the propaganda war is not 
conducive to an improvement in the relations between the two 
countries. "Estonian-Russian relations haven't improved," 
Reinart said. 
  Commenting on the Latvian government's consent to give 
Russia 
the right to continue using the Skrunda radar base for four 
years, Laar said the basic issue is the status of the base. 
  "If it becomes a demilitarized facility as proposed, it 
cannot be regarded as a Russian military base on Latvian 
territory," the Estonian premier said. "What is of primary 
importance is that Russia should withdraw its troops from Latvia 
by Aug. 31." 
  The premier said the preservation of the Skrunda radar base 
in Latvia can have no consequences for Estonia. 
  "What Russia has been aiming to do of late is to cause a 
rift 
in Baltic unity. We're up against clear tactics: by playing 
the Lithuanian card, Russia accuses Estonia and Latvia of human 
rights violations, then concentrates its attention on Latvia. 
Since all Russia's attempts to drive a wedge between the Baltic 
states have failed, it is again quoting all three Baltic states 
as a negative example," Laar said. 
  The Estonian premier assumed that, after solving the Skrunda 
radar base problem, Russia will again focus on Lithuania that 
faces a major problem connected with the numerous Russian troops 
in the Kaliningrad region. 
  Luik told BNS an agreement on the Skrunda radar base hasn't 
actually been concluded yet. "The term of its use is only one 
aspect of the agreement, which is connected with the Latvian 
authorities' access to the base, the sum to be paid for its use, 
and the number of military at the base," Luik said. 
  The foreign minister claimed Russia wants to leave about 
1,000 men at the Skrunda radar base, while Latvia wants to limit 
their number at 80.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 10, BNS -- The Estonian parliament 
today with 69 votes for adopted a statement to protest against 
the "deepening imperialistic tendencies" in Russian foreign 
policy, which place the Baltic states in Russia's sphere of 
influence. 
  "Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has systematically 
been justifying the continued presence of Russian troops on 
Estonian territory against the will of the Estonian people and 
in violation of norms of international law," the lawmakers said 
in the statement. 
  The statement maintains that Russian government members' 
anti- Estonian statements are inconsistent with the U.N. Charter 
and the CSCE final acts, which Russia must observe in its 
foreign policy. 
  The parliament draws the attention of all states' 
legislatures to the fact that Russia assumed at the CSCE 
Helsinki summit in 1992 the obligation to withdraw its troops 
from the Baltic states "in an orderly manner, speedily and 
completely" without additional conditions. Since the obligation 
vis-a-vis Estonia and Latvia hasn't been fulfilled, the 
development of Estonian-Russian relations has come to a stop, 
the statement notes.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 14, BNS -- The Russian Embassy in 
Estonia issued a statement taxing Estonian politicians and mass 
media with interpreting a recent statement by Russian Foreign 
Ministry official Mikhail Demurin in an "uncivilized manner." 
Demurin, speaking about a program "to protect ethnic Russians 
in the CIS countries and the Baltic states," noted that 
"diplomatic means are not sufficient to resolve the problem." 
  Estonia's reaction to Demurin's statement was sharp: 
Estonian ambassador to Moscow was instructed to present a 
demarche and President Lennart Meri asked Russian ambassador in 
Tallinn for explanations. 
  The Russian embassy in Tallinn disseminated the full text of 
Demurin's address. It reads as follows: "The program is being 
drafted because, in our opinion, solely diplomatic means are 
insufficient to solve the problem of Russians in the territory 
of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltic states. 
The work on a program to protect the interests of and to 
support ethnic Russians began over a year ago. It concerns 
measures such as special tele- and broadcasts, humanitarian aid 
to the needy, support for Russian businessmen, customs and other 
preferences, support for enterprises that mostly employ 
Russians, cooperation between banks, etc." 
  "It is perplexing that some Estonian mass media and 
politicians should take one phrase out of context and interpret 
it as another threat," the statement of the Russian Embassy says.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 10, BNS -- The meeting with Danish 
Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen outlined the limits of 
aid available within NATO's Partnership for Peace program, 
Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik said today after his return 
from Denmark where the three Baltic foreign ministers met with 
their Danish counterpart. 
  Luik said that Denmark as a NATO member state admits the 
possibility of NATO taking part in building out Estonia's border 
defense system. 
  The foreign minister said the possibility of joint military 
exercises was also discussed. "The first major joint maneuvers 
will be conducted in 1994," he said. "Germany, Poland and 
Denmark, and most probably also the Baltic states will take part 
in maritime exercises this summer." 
  Luik said great importance was attached to Estonia sending 
in 
the near future a liaison officer to NATO planning division that 
works out the plans for all the alliance's military operations. 
  The Baltic foreign ministers and their Danish counterpart 
discussed also the formation of a Baltic peacekeeping unit. 
Luik said the Danish officials regard it as having good 
prospects and are prepared to train military personnel for it. 
  Luik said the Danish parliament is going to discuss 
financial 
aid for the Baltic peacekeeping battalion and the Estonian 
border guards. "If the parliament approves an aid program, we 
will probably receive more up-to-date communications and 
transport equipment," he predicted. 
  The meeting between the foreign ministers touched on the 
Baltic states' relations with the European Union. "European 
Union member states accept us as future members of the union," 
Luik said. 
  Another subject discussed in Copenhagen was the situation in 
Russia. Luik said Danish foreign policy leaders expressed great 
concern over the state of affairs in Russia. "There's no reason 
for panic, of course, but Russia's leaders must be shown calmly, 
through clear foreign political moves, what the bounds of 
international behavior are," the Estonian foreign minister 
declared.

<F P=106> [Annual report presented by President Algirdas Brazauskas at </F>
a Seimas plenary session in Vilnius -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Social and legal security is, 
to my mind, the most important concern of the state. We must 
all, together, create such a system of a democratic society and 
social order which in itself is favorably disposed toward man. 
Lithuania will then be a secure, flourishing, democratic 
country where concord and honesty will be dominant. [passage 
omitted] 
  The nature of the political system of our democratic state 
became much stronger in 1993. It was very important that all 
the most important institutions provided for by the republic's 
Constitution, which did not exist in 1992, came into being. 
They are the president of the Republic of Lithuania and, for 
the first time in the history of the Lithuanian state, the 
Constitutional Court. [passage omitted] 
  Visiting various towns and districts in Lithuania, I noticed 
that there has been no positive progress in local government. 
The reform of local government is overdue; corresponding draft 
laws have been drawn up. It is most important that reform does 
not take place for the sake of reform, but serves the solution 
of everyday problems of every person, not destroying what has 
been proved to be useful in practice. We now have our 
independent state, but we have failed to reorganize our state 
apparatus in such a way that it qualitatively differs from the 
previous one. This is bad. The implementation of the general 
state policy depends on the work of state officials and on their 
competence. Of course, the formation of a civilized state 
apparatus is a long-term process. Therefore it is important to 
adopt at present a law which establishes the rights and duties 
of state officials, their responsibilities and social 
guarantees. This would be followed by more radical decisions. 
  I am a realist; therefore I do not deny that not all the 
residents of Lithuania have a favorable attitude to the present 
government and its policy. But, I think, nobody will dispute 
the fact that the political atmosphere in our country became 
calmer last year after we stopped looking for internal enemies 
and fighting against them. [passage omitted] 
  On 1 January 1993 the republic's nationality was 19.4 
percent 
non-Lithuanian. Eighteen of Lithuania's national minorities and 
ethnic groups have more than 100 public organizations. The 
Lithuanian legislation and practical policy regulating national 
relations is being positively assessed both in the country and 
on the international scale. A careful, consistent and at the 
same time a principled policy enabled the Republic of Lithuania 
to avoid the troubles and difficulties experienced by some other 
countries. This is capital which must not be thoughtlessly 
squandered. [passage omitted] 
  I wish to note on this occasion that the adoption of a law 
on 
preventive detention, which has been the object of many 
disputes, has become an objective and unavoidable reaction to 
the organized crimes and enabled the law enforcement bodies to 
take the initiative. But the combat against organized crime 
with political and legal means can be successful only up to a 
certain extent. Economic and social causes of crime must be 
eliminated. [passage omitted] 
  The national defense system is being reorganized according 
to 
the Western model. I must say that the rapprochement with the 
NATO structures is taking place, above all, by reorganizing the 
structure of our Ministry of National Defense according to 
Western standards. In solving these problems, we expect serious 
assistance from Western military experts. Nonstatutory 
relations and other negative phenomena in our army are among the 
most pressing problems. There cannot be concessions or 
compromises in this sphere. Nonstatutory relations in our army 
must be uprooted by mercilessly punishing the culprits. This, 
for me, as the supreme commander of the armed forces, is a 
strict and clear demand to the leadership of the Ministry of 
National Defense, the army commander and to all military 
commanders. [passage omitted] 
  The decline of production slowed in the second half of 1993, 
and the signs of stability and even growth could be noticed in 
some branches of the economy. Some enterprises adapt themselves 
to new conditions of the manufacture and sale of products, and 
find themselves partners. Inflation was a very heavy burden 
last year. Joint efforts by the government and the Bank of 
Lithuania stopped it in the middle of the year. This was an 
essential condition for the introduction of the litas. After 
the introduction of the litas the rate of inflation declined 
even more, and constituted in the second half of the year 
[figure indistinct] percent. Since the prices of raw materials 
and energy resources have reached the world level I think there 
will be no great increase in prices this year. [passage omitted] 
  The government program provides for concluding the stage of 
primary privatization in the first half of this year. But 
almost half of all investment checks remain unused. It is 
becoming obvious that it is not expedient to convert them into 
state bonds. In order to use all checks in the first stage it 
is essential to inform the residents as soon as possible about 
what will be privatized and to define the final date of the 
validity of the investment checks. [passage omitted] 
  The government must effectively guide the process of 
privatization. I consider the work of the Central Privatization 
Commission to be unsatisfactory. Foreign investments in 
Lithuania's economy are not increasing as we expected. At 
present no foreign investors compete among themselves in 
striving to dominate Lithuania's market, but, on the contrary, 
the states are competing among themselves for foreign 
investments, including the Baltic states. In order to win this 
competition, it is esential to pay more attention to 
advertising, propagate our investment projects, supply 
information and all other services to foreign investors, and 
simplify the order of the use of foreign credits. [passage 
omitted] 
  Many problems have accumulated in agriculture. In carrying 
out the agricultural reform the seed of the current confusion 
was sown, which almost halted the reform. As a result of a 
limited understanding of the problem of social justice the 
principles of rational farming were ignored. [passage omitted] 
Yet contrary to what our opponents and sometimes even 
misinformed foreign experts maintained, the agricultural reform 
was not impeded. [passage omitted] 
  According to the latest figures, every third farmer has been 
given all the documents proving his rights to land and property. 
About 30 percent of land suitable for farming is currently used 
by the Lithuanian farmers. In 1993, privatization of the 
property owned by the agricultural enterprises was virtually 
completed. The remaining property of agricultural enterprises 
due to be privatized comprises only one percent of the value of 
that which is to be privatized. However, the general situation 
in agriculture and the financial state of agricultural subjects 
so far is not satisfactory. The slump in production which 
started three years ago continued last year. The volume of 
production in comparison with 1992 has decreased by eight 
percent. 
  Farmers and agricultural enterprises encounter great 
financial difficulties, the reasons for which are: A decrease 
in the solvent demand by the population resulting in contraction 
of the internal market; limited export possibilities; and an 
ever-increasing flow of imported food products. The 
possibilities of the state to support the farmers in one way or 
another are also limited. However, most probably the main reason 
for the current situation are the debts to the agricultural 
suppliers by the food processing enterprises. [passage omitted] 
  Although not long ago the farmers demanded freedom for 
economic activity, now they are attacking the government, 
demanding rather strict state control. Without going into fine 
detail I would like to say this: In a nutshell, the support 
must correspond to the financial possibilities of the state 
budget, it must help to coordinate the interests of producers 
and consumers, it must lower social tensions in rural areas and 
not increase them in the cities. It must not contradict the 
essential concepts of the agreement concluded with the World 
Bank and the IMF. [passage omitted] 
  The Partnership for Peace program signed in Brussels on 27 
January is a real step in ensuring the security of the state. 
It is becoming obvious that membership in the European 
Community and NATO is only a means of striving for further aims. 
I think that there is no need to discuss Lithuania's 
(?position). From the point of view of culture and of the 
geopolitical situation, it is a Central European country. But 
there is no need to artificially thrust ourselves into some 
single region and thus limit our opportunities. We are both in 
Central Europe and in the region of the Baltic Sea. The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs should define Lithuania's strategy 
both toward the states of the Baltic Sea and of Central Europe, 
the Visegrad group, and other states. 
  Many changes have taken place in the relations between the 
Baltic states. Cooperation between Lithuania, Estonia and 
Latvia, which has often been declaratory and which almost ceased 
in the autumn of 1991, acquired new features last year. Several 
meetings of the presidents, parliaments and heads of governments 
took place. The tripartite free trade agreement was signed and 
ratified, the memorandum on consular relations and the joint 
visa area of the Baltic states was signed. A Baltic Council is 
to be formed from the existing interparliamentary Baltic 
Assembly and the future Baltic [words indistinct]. 
  A formula of three-plus-five is being consolidated in 
Lithuanian foreign policy. This is the prospect of cooperation 
between the three Baltic states and five Nordic states. But 
there are problems here, too. In relations with the Nordic 
states we are as yet unable to make use of the proposed aid. We 
not always display initiative. 
  Our foreign policy contains the striving to establish and 
develop bilateral relations with Western states. I would like 
to mention relations with Germany as an example. They are 
intensive and can serve as an example of good relations with a 
powerful Western state, if only we can make better use of the 
opportunities of economic cooperation. The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, making use of this example, could develop in a more 
inventive way our state relations with Great Britain, France, 
Italy, and the United States. It would be advantageous to 
Lithuania to establish closer relations with the Balkan states 
and those in the Near East, and also with such countries as 
Austria, Switzerland, Turkey, Israel and Canada. 
  The relations between Lithuania and Poland have so far not 
been regulated by a joint political treaty. We must more boldly 
take the necessary step and sign such a treaty. The delay is 
very detrimental to Lithuania's interests. 
  We must make better use of all opportunities in working in 
international organizations. This is a good opportunity to 
develop bilateral relations, especially bearing in mind our 
limited material and technical resources and shortage of 
experienced specialists. Relations with Russia and the CIS 
countries are important to us. Relations with Russia rather 
improved in 1993. This is testified by my meeting with the 
Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, and a packet of bilateral 
agreements signed during the visit of the Russian prime 
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, in Vilnius. This provides good 
grounds for the development of Lithuanian-Russian economic 
cooperation. So far I do not see any need to revise our policy 
toward Russia, although, in time, corrections might be 
necessary. If an imperial stand becomes stronger in the foreign 
policy of that country, Lithuania's policy will change toward 
Russia, too. 
  The most important thing for us is to remain realists. 
Lithuania's relations with other countries will continue to be 
based on bilateral agreements, and various issues, both with 
Russia and with other CIS countries will be solved by Lithuania 
by way of negotiations. The visits to Kazakhstan and China 
demonstrated what huge and untapped possibilities exist in the 
Asian region. This is an immense market, the source of 
inexhaustible raw materials, the fastest developing economy, new 
technologies, financial and credit resources. 
  I would like to mention that Lithuanian Government 
structures 
have not always smoothly coordinated their foreign policy. By 
my decree, the Council for the Coordination of Foreign Policy 
was formed. We should expect basic changes, although this 
council has no constitutional power to make decisions, but the 
authorizations of the heads and representatives of the state 
institutions make it possible to strive by way of coordination 
for the optimal decisions for our country. 
  It is very important to form a positive image of Lithuania 
in 
the world. Disputes, dialogues and sharp criticism on the 
domestic issues of Lithuania should not become an object of 
international investigation or even derision, unless attempts 
are being made to discredit the state of Lithuania and frighten 
away our potential partners. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Almaty, 13 Feb -- Today President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev left for an official visit to the United States at 
the invitation of that country's president, Bill Clinton. 
  Speaking to journalists prior to his departure, Nazarbayev 
said this visit, his second to the United States, promises to be 
highly productive. He voiced the hope that the forthcoming 
summit talks and meetings with business circles will inject a 
new economic and political quality to diverse Kazakhstan-U.S. 
ties. Increased mutually beneficial cooperation with the United 
States, he said, will greatly help the republic to lift its 
economy. 
  The leader of Kazakhstan also announced that on the return 
journey, he will stop over in Paris at the invitation of 
President Francois Mitterrand. Their meeting will look at ways 
of developing existing agreements on bilateral cooperation.

media on a meeting between the Russian and Kazakhstan presidents 
expected in the next few days. The dates given for the meeting 
in the majority of reports are either before or immediately 
after Nazarbayev's official visit to the United States, which is 
scheduled for 13-17 February. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by the press service of 
the Kazakh president that the exact dates for the meeting of the 
two leaders is not yet being discussed. The meeting can take 
place only after the documents on which agreement was reached 
during the recent talks between the foreign ministers of Russia 
and Kazakhstan in Almaty are prepared for signing.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>
  [Text] Leninsk February 10 TASS -- During his official 
visit to Kazakhstan, which ended today, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev had talks with Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev on the Baykonur cosmodrome. It was agreed to set up 
a special working team to study the problem. It is to draw up a 
draft agreement on this unique scientific complex for the 
Russo-Kazakh summit, scheduled for the end of March. 
  Kozyrev visited the Baykonur cosmodrome on the last day of 
his official visit. He was accompanied by Kazakh Foreign 
Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov. 
  Baykonur holds pride of place in the history of world 
science, especially cosmonautics. This is from where mankind 
had for the first time ventured into outer space, turning a new 
page in the history of civilisation. The world's first 
artificial earth satellite was orbited from Baykonur in October 
1957. The first cosmonaut, Yuriy Gagarin, was launched into 
outer space from there in April 1961. 
  The first "Buran" reusable vehicle was launched from 
Baykonur 
in 1988. The international space observatory "Granat", orbited 
from there in December 1989, is still functioning in outer 
space. It is designed to carry out strategic observations and 
to study cosmic, roentgen and gamma rays. Russia, France, 
Bulgaria and Denmark are taking part in the project. 
  A spaceship, carrying a Soviet-Australian expedition, 
including a representative of Kazakhstan, was launched from 
Baykonur for the first time in the 40-year-long history of the 
space centre, on October 2, 1991. The next stage of the 
cosmodrome's history was marked by the launching of a Soyuz 
TM-13 rocket. This event ushered in a new era in the 
cosmodrome's history. 
  Kozyrev overflew the installations of the cosmodrome and 
talked to the heads of Baykonur's military and civilian 
personnels. Taking part in the talk was Colonel-General 
Vladimir Ivanov, commander of the Military Space Forces of the 
Russian Defence Ministry, Acting Chief of the Baykonur 
Cosmodrome Major-General Viktor Grafinin, and head of the 
Leninsk Administration Vitaliy Brynkin. 
  In accordance with a decree signed by the Kazakh president 
in 
1991, all the enterprises, organisations and institutions on the 
territory of Kazakhstan were declared Kazakh state property, 
including the Baykonur cosmodrome. Naturally, this posed new 
difficult problems before the complex. It will not be an 
exaggeration to say that Kazakhstan is unable to cope with all 
the problems linked with the exploitation of this unique space 
complex. Suffice it to say that Russia had spent 47 billion 
roubles to keep Baykonur going in 1993 alone. Ninety-four per 
cent of all the spendings on the complex are borne by Russia and 
only six per cent by Kazakhstan in accordance with an agreement 
concluded between the two countries. As much as 259 billion 
roubles will be required to finance Baykonur in 1994. 
  During the meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Chief 
of the Cosmodrome Viktor Grafinin said that 22 launchings of 
different space vehicles, both military and civilian, were 
effected from Baykonur in 1992, and four in 1994, including one 
piloted vehicle. Dwelling on problems facing the cosmodrome 
today, he laid accent on two main problems -- determination of 
the cosmodrome's status and solution of tasks linked with the 
social protection of its personnel. 
  Kozyrev flew to Moscow right after his tour of Baykonur 
installations.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Nursultan Nazarbayev by Manfred </F>
Quiring; place and date not given: "Now He Is Keeping His 
Distance From Moscow"] 
  [Text] [Quiring] You reject dual citizenship. Why? 
  [Nazarbayev] I am afraid that this infamous dual citizenship 
would split our society. With a recently issued ukase I have 
fundamentally changed some not particularly fortunate passages 
of the Kazakh Law on Citizenship. I passed on to Boris Yeltsin 
and Viktor Chernomyrdin the draft treaty on principles 
associated with the acquisition of citizenship in Kazakhstan and 
in Russia. We should adopt laws that facilitate this. 
  [Quiring] On the eve of elections in Russia statements by 
Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev that Russia wants to protect 
the interests of its fellow citizens in the former Union 
republics caused excitement. How do you see this today, after 
Zhirinovskiy's election success? 
  [Nazarbayev] The key phrase is "on the eve of elections." 
An election campaign has its own laws. However, I am also 
quite sure that such statements have not at all reassured the 
Russians who live in national republics -- in particular not 
those who never had these problems. 
  [Quiring] In Kazakhstan almost 50 percent of the population 
are Russian. What is your point of view about this fact? 
  [Nazarbayev] I am completely calm when I think of the act 
that in Kazakhstan there are 8 million Kazakhs and 5 million 
Russians. Some media want to see a problem where there is none. 
Often there is talk of migration. However, this process is 
unavoidable also under normal circumstances, all the more so 
when an empire collapses. 
  Kazakhstan, like Russia, is a multinational state. For many 
centuries Kazakhs here have lived together not only with 
Russians, but also with Ukrainians, Belarusians, Germans, Poles, 
Uigurs, Dunganes, and -- since the fateful time of the Stalinist 
deportations -- also with Koreans, Chechens, Ingushes, and 
Turko- Mezhets. I am convinced that there will be no ethnic 
conflict in Kazakhstan. 
  [Quiring] But emigration continues to increase? 
  [Nazarbayev] I am seriously worried about that. Many 
Germans, for instance, are leaving us. As regards the Russians, 
I can give you the following figures: Last year more than 
200,000 left the country, not only for Russia. By 1990 80,000 
to 100,000 people left our republic every year. An 
approximately equal number came to us. However, when listing the 
current migration figures, one forgets -- for whatever reason -- 
to note that last year about 160,000 Russians came to Kazakhstan. 
  [Quiring] Among the political personalities who brought 
about the end of the USSR, you are considered to be one of the 
most far-sighted. Most recently, you have distanced yourself 
from Moscow. How do you see the development of relations with 
Russia? 
  [Nazarbayev] Thank you for the compliment, but I was not 
invited to "seal the end." In fact, I have always advocated 
integration in all spheres of our life. Now, also, I am of the 
view that only together can we can find a way out of the crisis. 
  I cannot agree with the second part of your question. We are 
not distancing ourselves from Moscow. On the contrary, we are 
striving for closer contacts within the framework of the CIS. 
For this purpose, however, we must bring our laws closer 
together; we must form a common parliament and a common 
government, for which one could take the Consultative 
Coordination Committee of the CIS as a basis. We must 
immediately establish customs, banking, payment, and other 
unions, as they are envisaged in our treaty on the economic 
union. 
  [Quiring] For a long time you were one of the most active 
advocates of the CIS. After the collapse of the ruble zone, do 
you still believe that the CIS has a future? 
  [Nazarbayev] The introduction of an independent currency -- 
and I have said so often -- was a forced step. Right to the end 
we hoped to find a joint solution with Russia for the ruble 
problem. However, the conditions proved to be unacceptable. 
However, nothing bad happened for anybody. The difficulties, 
which are linked with the introduction of national currencies, 
are unavoidable in view of the temporary delineation. However, 
it cannot be ruled out that we can come to a common circulation 
of money in the future, perhaps even to the creation of a common 
currency, following the model of the European Union. 
  [Quiring] In contrast to Russia, the parliament and the 
local soviets in Kazakhstan have dissolved peacefully. Still, 
is this a rejection of parliamentary democracy? 
  [Nazarbayev] Not at all! Now more than ever the republic 
needs a professional, constantly working parliament, which is 
able to adopt laws of a high quality and thus to establish a 
reliable basis for the reforms, which we are implementing. The 
special powers given to the president are valid only until a new 
parliament is convened and apply only to issues, which are 
linked with the economic reform. The elections for the new 
parliament will be held on 7 March 1994.

  [Excerpts] State adviser Tulegen Zhukeyev described as 
absolutely untrue the story: Nuclear magazines in Kazakhstan 
are on the brink of an accident, published by IZVESTIYA on 12 
February. At a news conference it was said that: This 
publication is very likely to have been ordered and inspired by 
those who are interested in introducing additional complications 
into the negotiations that are likely to be started between the 
two states on the issues of nuclear weapons, and a search for 
mutually acceptable decisions on a parity basis, taking into 
account mutual benefits. 
  Zhukeyev voiced the opinion that the Russian military and 
industrial complex can be such a party, because it aims at 
enhancing its influence on the elaboration of the policy in the 
corridors of power of the Russian Federation and wants to take 
upon itself individual decision-making, though it has succeeded 
in this too much already. It practically has disavowed the 
agreement between the CIS nuclear states about mutual control 
over nuclear stocks, and the strategic designation troops are 
completely under the Russian military leadership's command. The 
state adviser said further: Probably, the fact that Kazakhstan 
has suspended the export of intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
which has been done entirely through Kazakhstan's own goodwill, 
is causing this displeasure among certain forces. [passage 
omitted] 
  Zhukeyev said: It makes us think that the Russian military 
and industrial complex is counting on the possibility that the 
world community would apply additional pressure on Kazakhstan in 
connection with the nuclear weapons problem. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS 9/2/1994 -- Russia will deliver 
to Moldova "special technique and other types of production for 
needs of defence and security," as stipulated in the 
Moldo-Russian Agreement on Economic and Commercial Collaboration 
for 1994, signed on 7 February in Moscow. The Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations and the State Stock Company 
"Oboronpromkomplex" of Russia, and the Moldovan Defence Ministry 
are authorized to perform such imports. Deliveries of "military 
equipment will be legalized by a separate protocol (agreement) 
and made on the basis of reciprocity (clearing)," states the 
document. It is stressed that these commercial exchanges are 
free of customs taxes, Ion Mastac, head of Moldovan Defence 
Ministry Press Secretariat, told BASAPRESS that previously a 
meeting was planned between representatives of both states' 
ministries, in order to sign an agreement on deliveries of 
equipment. However, these deliveries do not include any 
weaponry, said Mastac. Sources from the Ministry of Commerce 
and Material Resources said "we import absolutely everything the 
Army needs, from cloth to technical means," without specifying 
what sort of technique. Same sources inform that an agreement 
on these deliveries was signed, but once the State Company 
"Oboronpromkomplex" was created, imports were stopped. A 
division at the Ministry of Commerce and Material Resources is 
specialized in imports of equipment for needs of state defence 
and security.

  [Excerpt] "In the event of a large-scale military 
conflict, regardless of who might provoke it, the 14th Russian 
Army shall reserve the right to cool the hotheads." 
  This was announced by the 14th Russian Army Military 
Council. 
The statement, circulated on 9 February, was prompted by the 
emergency situation in the region. The statement is addressed 
to residents on either bank of the Dniester. In the run-up to 
parliamentary elections in Moldova, the statement stresses that 
"the flying wheel of military psychosis is being spun both by 
Dniester and Moldova TV." The authors of the document cite 
political negotiations as the sole method of achieving accord. 
As Aleksandr Baranov, 14th Army assistant commander, explained 
to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent, this statement has been 
forwarded to the leadership of Tiraspol and Chisinau. [passage

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 10/2/1994 -- Assuming the 
responsibility it was not granted, the Russian 14th Army has an 
obviously careless tone, proceeding to frank threat using force 
against Moldova unless conditions it had imposed are satisfied, 
states a declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAF), 
spread today. On January 8th 1994, the 14th Army Military 
Council declared that if a new conflict unleashes in Moldova's 
east, the 14th Army reserves the right to involve in the 
conflict's solution. The Army does not want to recognize the 
doubtless truth that it is a foreign army dislocated on the 
territory of an independent and sovereign state with which it 
cannot talk in a language of dictation and blackmail, states the 
declaration. "It seems unbelievable that the published document 
was not inspired and coordinated with the Russian Defence 
Ministry." The declaration mentions that "by the said 
declaration of its Military Council, the Russian 14th Army 
proves again that it is the main destabilizing factor in the 
region. The exaggerate militarizing of east regions, the 
persecution of those with different opinions, circulation 
restrictions and the banned participation in Moldovan Parliament 
elections leave no doubt on where the instigator and the actual 
centre of an eventual armed conflict and provocation is, states 
the MAF declaration.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev February 11 TASS -- Plagued with dissent in 
its provinces as the election date is drawing closer, the 
Moldovan leadership is seeking to consolidate the voters by 
scaring them with a finger pointing at "an enemy". 
  The Foreign Ministry of this ex-Soviet republic accused the 
command of the 14th Russian Army deployed in the Moldovan 
breakaway Dniester Province of "crude interference into the 
affairs of the republic" and said in a statement issued on 
Friday the Russian Army was "the main destabilising factor in 
the Dniester region". 
  However, ealier this week, the Russian Army Command warned 
all sides against "the illusion that the conflict can be solved 
by force". It did say though that it would not stand on the 
sidelines if anything untowards happened and promised that "the 
organizers of armed provocations from either bank (of the 
Dniester River) will get severe punishment for any attempt to 
unleash a new conflict". 
  The Foreign Ministry said that such statements "undermine 
bilateral negotiations on the future of the 14th Army" and 
reiterated that the Moldovan leadership "insists on an 
unconditional pullout of the army". 
  The statement then switched away from the Russian Army and 
blasted the leadership of the Dniester region for "blocking any 
constructive effort of Kishinev aiming to ensure peace in the 
region" and for not allowing the area residents to participate 
in Moldova's parliamentary elections scheduled for February 27. 
The tone for the criticism must have been set by Moldovan 
Presdient Mircea Snegur, who, still earlier in the week, accused 
Tiraspol, the Dniester area administrative centre, of attempting 
to further aggravate the social and political situation in the 
republic. 
  The situation is evidently hotting up in the Dniester 
Province. Already on Wednesday, the parliament of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic responded to verbal attacks by 
calling on the United Nations, the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the heads of the CIS states to 
send observers for "the objective assessment of the situation". 
  "The presence of international observers may prevent an 
economic siege and a new military conflict in the region", the 
appeal of the Dniester parliament said. The call was prompted 
by the sense of an impending strike. "A single act of 
provocation will be enough to have a military conflict 
unleashed", Valeriy Prudnikov, chief of police in the Dniester 
town of Bendery told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  To complicate the matter, the Russian Army and the Dniester 
area are not the only pains in the back for Kishinev. The 
leaders of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic in southern 
Moldova poured oil in the fire by insisting that the 14th 
Russian Army deployed in the former Soviet republic must be 
granted the status of a peace-keeping force. This will prevent 
Kishinev's possible attempts at solving by force the problem of 
Moldova's two provinces - Dniester and Gagauz, said a statement 
signed by Gagauz leaders. 
  Rather mollifying sounded the Friday statement of a CSCE 
official Slavomir Dabrova, a Pole working for the CSCE mission 
in Moldova. He predicted there would be no new military 
conflicts since "the 1992 conflict with no winner was a good 
lesson for politicians in Kishinev and Tiraspol". 
  "However, it is still a long way to the complete settlement 
of the Moldovan conflicts, and international organisations 
should work hard to untie this knot", he added.

Democratic Party of Moldova: I Am Against Territorial

  [Text] On Monday, 8 February, BBC radio broadcasted a 
statement by Dumitru Motpan, leader of the Agrarian Democratic 
Party of Moldova [PDAM], in which he denied making any 
declaration about unification with a part of Romanian territory 
[Moldavia]. Moreover, Mr. Motpan said that the official position 
of his party is to ensure the independence of the Republic of 
Moldova, without any territorial claims from Romania or any 
other state. As far as the future of the Republic of Moldova's 
relations with Romania is concerned, the PDAM leader said that 
he favors: "A real integration in the economic, cultural, 
educational, and other areas but not on issues connected with 
annexation, unification, and so forth. I personally, as well as 
our party, am categorically against territorial unification with 
Romania."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 10/2/1994 -- During today's 
press conference of Moldovan Christian National Party (PCNM), 
the leadership presented its electoral program mentioning that 
they represent "those who know themselves to be Romanians and 
want to unite with the Motherland, Romania." Vladimir Nicu, 
PCNM chairman, said that "PCNM is a political party of Romanians 
from territories east to Prut and of Christian Orthodox spirit 
of this suffering land." The party enters the electoral battle 
to liquidate in law and in fact the consequences of 
Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact with "the sacred goal to reintegrate the 
Romanian nation," said Nicu. Referring to the Congress of 
Moldovan Civic Alliance, PCNM representatives stated that the 
congress was held from Moldovan Government's initiative. They 
called it "an insult to the Romanian's dignity, tricolor, hymn 
and blazon." "These insults were made in the present of 
President Mircea Snegur, Speaker Petru Lucinschi and Premier 
Andrei Sangheli, and they applauded at them," said Nicu. He 
asked rhetorically "what sort of common house is Moldova if PCNM 
representatives were not allowed to take part in the congress?" 
PCNM representatives called the movement "Pro Moldova" a 
subdivision of "Moldovans' Alliance" in Dniester organized by 
KGB and Maracuta. PCNM declared itself a nationalist party, 
saying that "it would be better for Moldova to be a Romanian 
province than a Russian colony." "Our chances in elections are 
little, but we shall prepare ourselves for the next elections," 
said Nicu. He added that "if we obtain the majority of seats in 
future Parliament, the next day we leave for Bucharest where we 
shall decide the fate of Moldova, together with the Romanian 
Parliament."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 12/2/1994 -- "Moldova has a 
strategically important geo-political situation and therefore 
Europe and the whole world wants Moldova to be stable," states 
to the newspaper PAMANT SI OAMENI (LAND AND PEOPLE) Dumitru 
Diacov, head of the political section of the Moldovan Embassy in 
Russia and Moldovan Democratic Agrarian Party [PDAM] candidate 
in the [27 February parliamentary] elections. Concerning the 
unionist options expressed on both banks of Prut [unification 
with Romania], Diacov says that "even though it seems a paradox, 
there are people against the unification in Romania itself. 
These are first of all young people, engineers, and 
intellectuals who fear to become unemployed as a consequence of 
the unification. He refers to a poll made in Romania in 1992, 
"which had surprising results." It revealed that "19 percent of 
the polled persons were against Moldova's unification with 
Romania and 35 percent said this process could take place in the 
future. Hence the conclusion that most Romanians do not want to 
unite," says Diacov. "During four years of my staying in 
Romania (as bureau head of the TASS news agency in Bucharest) I 
realized that I have there a lot of real friends. We could 
learn much from each other, and as to the issue of unification 
let our grandsons who will be less interested in the `heritage 
of the past' decide," says Diacov. According to him, any 
attempt to revise the borders in Europe might cause danger and 
due to several objective causes it will remain so for a long 
time. Russia should not consider Moldova a region that 
threatens its stability; it should have a more clear attitude 
regarding the issues of the Dniester Republic and that of the 
14th Russian Army. Moldovan diplomacy should promote a more 
active, clear, and better coordinated policy in its relations 
with Russia. Small countries should have only friends and not 
enemies, states Diacov.

<F P=106> [Irina Negrea article: "Snegur Gives Moscow Reason for </F>
Satisfaction"] 
  [Text] In the final period of the election campaign for 
parliamentary elections in the Republic of Moldova, the 
conservative, procommunist, and pro-imperial forces, which hold 
political and economic power in Chisinau, have intensified their 
attack. The recent meeting entitled "Our Home -- the Republic 
of Moldova" fulfilled all the functions of former traditional 
congresses of the Communist Party by formulating "directives" 
and "theses" for the coming period. The anti-Romanian 
atmosphere of the proceedings and the anti-unification promoted 
by all speakers triggered lively applause in Moscow. Here is 
how Radio Moscow and Ostankino Television acclaimed the said 
congress: "The participants in the forum condemned the 
political forces and media opposing the state's independence and 
spread national feuding (...) Moldova's President Mircea Snegur 
delivered a profoundly substantiated speech in front of those 
present. The ultra-patriotic slogans supported by a number of 
parties and movements led to a split not only of the people of 
different ethnic origin, but also among the ranks of Moldovans." 
And at the end of the report, which apparently is not linked to 
what was reported before, but which actually testifies to the 
fact that Moscow endorses Chisinau's official stance, it is 
emphasized: "The same day (6 February), Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin signed an intergovernmental draft accord that 
establishes the rules and conditions for the stationing of 
Russian troops on the territory of Moldova." Once again this 
proves that Snegur's previous statements in connection with the 
need for the 14th Army to withdraw were false. 
  Even the organization of the congress (by the so-called 
Civic 
Alliance in Chisinau, a formation that was set up recently, and 
the Government of the Republic of Moldova) does not differ in 
any way from the former measures of defense and security adopted 
by the communists. The proceedings were attended by delegations 
from several countries, including from former Soviet republics; 
Romania was not invited. Access to the congress was very 
restricted. The invitations had been issued by state 
structures. The same procedure was also in force for most of 
the journalists, who, not having the authorities' approval, had 
to withdraw when faced by the cordons of policemen. Chisinau 
radio and television carried live relays of the congress, so 
that the citizens' indoctrination would be more effective. In 
practical terms, the speakers respected the electoral platform 
of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova [PDAM] by trying, 
first and foremost, to slander the pro-union political forces 
and promoting Romania-phobia and an exaggerated, abnormal 
Moldovanism. 
  Adrian Usatai, general director of the national radio 
television in Moldova and leader of the Civic Alliance in 
Chisinau, went as far as to contest the national ideal of the 
country's reintegration, thus questioning -- with sinister 
sarcasm -- the supreme sacrifice accepted by Ilie Ilascu: "Mr. 
Ilascu, it is one thing to defend the integrity of the Republic 
of Moldova in Tiraspol, and another, if you state, in your cage, 
that Romania is your homeland. In what capacity were you there 
and what was the purpose of being in Tiraspol?" 
  Not wanting the Republic of Moldova to become "a province or 
domain of other countries," Dumitru Motpan, PDAM leader, 
supports the presidential point of view militating for an 
independent Republic of Moldova, eventually united with Moldavia 
on this side of the Prut River. 
  During a recent meeting with the electorate of the Cantemir 
Rayon, Motpan said that, after the genuine consolidation of 
Moldova's statehood, the PDAM "will proceed to the unification, 
but not with the whole of Romania, but merely with Romanian 
Moldavia." 
  Unfortunately, the agrarians are the ones who can most 
easily 
manipulate public opinion in villages, both at the 27 February 
1994 elections and during the so-called sociological referendum 
on 6 March 1994, considering that the majority of peasants rely 
on the kolkhoz and sovkhoz leaders, who constantly put pressure 
on them due to the directives received from the "center."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 11/2/1994 -- The Moldovan 
Government entirely supports the CSCE mission to Moldova and 
creates good conditions of activity, states Slavomir Dabrova, 
head of the CSCE mission to Moldova in PACEA CIVICA (CIVIC 
PEACE.) The attitude of the Tiraspol authorities is completely 
different. In Tiraspol some are ready to cooperate with us in 
normal conditions, while other think we are spies, the quoted 
source states. Our mission's mandate is valid for one single 
state -- the Republic of Moldova, recognized by the world 
community. Any attempt to create an artificial state within 
Moldova is doomed to failure, as it had not and will not have 
the support of world community. For the conflict's solution, 
the CSCE mission's recommendations suggest, on one hand, the 
consolidation of the independence, sovereignty, and territorial 
integrity of Moldova, and, on the other, the necessity to grant 
a special statute to the Dniester region, which would provide a 
series of rights for this region, said the interviewed. Dabrova 
referred to the peace-maker role Russia assumed, mentioning that 
it declares "wherever and whenever possible that it promotes 
peace in various conflict zones on Earth" and it "demands from 
international organizations, CSCE in particular, material, 
moral, and political support of this role it assumed." At the 
same time, "to provide this support we would like first to see 
how Russia asks for support while it provides no proof to 
persuade us what and how actually happens." Theoretically, 
Russia accepts to cooperate with the CSCE mission to Moldova, 
but practically hinders its cooperation with the Joint Control 
Commission. I believe Moldova will not stand another military 
conflict, but it is long until the conflict is solved. The 
prospects over the next years cannot be optimistic for Moldova, 
which, as all other states in the region, has a period of 
dismantling a system and searching for another, more favorable 
one, the quoted source notes.

  [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 12/2/1994 -- The press service 
of the president and government of the so-called Dniester 
Republic has published a declaration on the future elections for 
the Moldovan Parliament. The document states that the Tiraspol 
government does not intend to hinder the participation of the 
Dniester inhabitants in the elections, but they will be able to 
do that "solely on the territory of the Republic of Moldova." 
International observers are invited to make sure that elections 
will not be held in the Dniester Republic. Previously, Tiraspol 
leaders tried to dam elections in Moldova's eastern regions, by 
introducing the emergency state and visa regime for entering the 
Dniester Republic.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 10/2/1994 -- The session of 
Moldovan Government presided by Mircea Snegur was held today. 
The social and economic development for 1993 and the reforms 
were discussed during it. Sergiu Certan, minister of national 
economy, presented a report in which he stated that social and 
economic situation is "quite serious," and that it is determined 
by "very unfavourable internal and external factors." Although 
a stabilizing trend is observed in economy from June 1993, the 
people's living level keeps falling. Certan pointed out that 
from the first month of 1994, the production in many fields 
started to fall again under the existing political divergences. 
President Snegur said that industrial production decreased in 
January 1994 in comparison with the same period of 1993 by 20 
percent. Snegur said that nevertheless "warehouses are full of 
goods." The president blamed the audience of inconsequence in 
promoting the reforms and demanded them to add to the adopted 
decisions facts, terms and concrete responsible people because 
the proposed project contains nothing but slogans.

  [Text] A group of Tajik opposition guerrillas on Friday [11 
February] evening assaulted a detail of Russian guards on the 
section of the Tajik- Afghan border controlled by Post No. 3 of 
the Pyandzh Border Guard Detachment. 
  A source in the press bureau of the Russian Border Guard 
told 
INTERFAX the detail and a reinforcement that had arrived from 
the post beat off the assault, one Russian serviceman being 
wounded. 
  The same day, another clash occurred on the same section of 
the border, the Tajik militants retreating and dispersing in 
rush thickets on the bank of the Pyandzh River. 
  The press bureau reported that Tajik guerrillas on Friday 
launched four attacks, using small arms, rocket missiles and 
grenade projectors, on Russian squads guarding the strip of the 
border controlled by post No. 12 of the Moskovskiy Border Guard 
Detachment. The Russians suppressed all the firing points of the 
guerrillas, the bureau said. It said none of the Russian 
servicemen were hurt, the guerrillas' losses being so far 
unknown.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleg Panfilov in the "Tajikistan" column] </F>
  [Text] A resolution by the Tajikistan Supreme Soviet 
Presidium has changed the structure of the government, which now 
includes 23 ministries and three committees. The number of 
deputy heads of government has been cut from eight to five. In 
his first weeks in office new Prime Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov 
appealed to his countrymen to "submit constructive proposals" on 
improving the operation of the national economy, at the same 
time apologizing that he cannot respond to each letter from 
citizens. 
  The new prime minister's concern is understandable: The 
economy has been brought to a critical point. Since last 
October, Uzbeksgaztrans has reduced gas deliveries to Tajikistan 
by 70 percent, and in particular the Dushanbe thermal power 
station has had to operate at only 30 percent of capacity. As a 
result, trees began to be cut in Dushanbe in late fall, just 
like in Yerevan some time in the past. As the economic crisis 
mounted, the flow of Russian-speakers from the country 
increased. And although the Tajik press still writes that the 
cause is the language law adopted a few years ago, in fact the 
true reason lies in increased confrontation by armed groupings 
inside the "winners'" camp. The uncontrolled movement of arms; 
more than a thousand criminals at large, released by People's 
Front gunmen from the Kurgan Tyube prison in summer 1992; and 
finally, the makeup of the Internal Affairs Ministry, including 
officers with a criminal record -- these are the reasons which 
will hardly be conducive to improving the situation. And 
although writing in VECHERNIY DUSHANBE, city prosecutor 
Salomiddin Sharopov suggested that crime has fallen, he could 
not hide the fact that the number of serious offenses in 
Dushanbe has increased by 19.3 percent, including murders, 2.2 
times, and robberies, by 31.9 percent. 
  Nonetheless, the Supreme Soviet Presidium decided not to 
dismiss power ministry chiefs for failing their duties, but 
quite the contrary upgraded the level of the state security 
committee to a ministry. It seems that this will have only 
marginal effect because the political and economic crisis will 
hardly allow the law enforcement bodies, "diluted" with former 
racketeers, to make the population more secure. Tajik security 
officers more or less show their worth only on the border, but 
even then with heavy losses.

and the enemy sustained heavy losses in manpower and materiel. 
  The Defence Ministry reported the activisation of Armenian 
sharp-shooters on the frontline. They fired at a filming group 
of the Azeri TV, injuring Adil Nasirov, a TV journalist, and 
destroying video cameras.

  [Text] Ankara February 11 TASS -- Armenia should leave 
Azeri lands without any conditions, Azerbaijani President Geydar 
Aliyev told a press conference in Istanbul on Friday. 
  The Azerbaijani leader said that "some states and groups" 
render a material and moral support to Armenia. "This makes the 
fight to liberate our territory tougher," Aliyev stressed. 
"Azerbaijan seeks to resolve the problem by peaceful means, but 
Armenia wants to resolve it by force and bring Azerbaijan to the 
knees," the Azerbaijani president noted. 
  Azerbaijan did not request Turkey to render military 
assistance. The two sides agreed about "supplies of wheat and 
granting of credits, as well as capital investments in the 
economy of Azerbaijan," Aliyev emphasised said. 
  The Azerbaijani leader noted that Azerbaijan itself will 
resolve military questions, but would like to "take advantage of 
prestigious military academies in Turkey to train experienced 
officers for the Azeri Army." The president said that his visit 
to Turkey was "very useful" from the point of view of the 
development of "friendly and fraternal relations" with the 
Turkish Republic. 
  Geydar Aliyev is expected to leave Turkey on Friday.

  [Text] President Aliyev's official visit to Turkey ended on 
11 February. He has met with Deniz Baykal, leader of the 
Republican People's Party. Baykal said: We are closely 
following the important developments in the social and political 
fields in Azerbaijan. We have approved all the steps you have 
taken to consolidate your independence. 
  President Aliyev pointed to the mutually beneficial 
relations 
between the two friendly countries and explained in detail 
Armenia's occupationist war against Azerbaijan. He said: Our 
people are fighting to give a deserving reply to the enemy. 
  Professor Ihsan Dogramaci, chairman of the Bilkent 
University 
Executive Committee who is a great friend of our people, invited 
President Aliyev and his delegation to his house. Dogramaci 
outlined the friendly and fraternal relations between the two 
countries' peoples. On his part, President Aliyev thanked him 
and said that Ihsan Dogramaci, who has devoted his entire life 
to the improvement of the educational system, is also respected 
in Azerbaijan. Aliyev also noted the importance of the effort 
to strengthen the friendly and fraternal relations between the 
two peoples and explained in detail the current social and 
political work in Azerbaijan and the progress of the war. 
  President Aliyev visited the Turkish Grand National Assembly 
[TGNA]. He held talks with Speaker of the National Assembly 
Husamettin Cindoruk. On behalf of Azerbaijan, he presented an 
exquisite carpet to the Turkish parliament. He attended the 
TGNA session after his meeting with Cindoruk and addressed the 
Turkish parliament. His speech was warmly applauded by the 
Turkish deputies. 
  A ceremony was held in the Turkish president's residence for 
the signing of agreements between the two countries. President 
Suleyman Demirel and President Aliyev addressed the ceremony. 
They highly assessed the agreements between the two friendly 
and fraternal countries and said that they will play an 
important role on the effort made to further strengthen and 
deepen the relations between Azerbaijan and Turkey. 
  President Aliyev and President Suleyman Demirel signed an 
agreement for friendship, mutual solidarity, and multifaceted 
cooperation between the two countries. The foreign ministers of 
the two countries signed several important documents. 
Agreements were concluded on mutual cooperation between 
Azerbaijan and Turkey in the economic, health, financial, 
educational, and cultural fields. Agreements were also concluded 
on customs and matters related to other domains. In toto, 16 
documents were signed. 
  President Aliyev held talks with the foreign ambassadors and 
diplomatic representatives in Turkey. He explained in detail 
the situation in Azerbaijan and the Republic's foreign policy. 
He said: We uphold the principle of establishing mutually 
beneficial relations with all countries on the basis of 
equality. So, we maintain our foreign policy in that direction. 
Azerbaijan is a member of the UN organization and the CSCE, 
which are the most influential organizations in the world. We 
are trying to establish relations with all the international 
organizations as much as possible. Azerbaijan is a recognized 
independent country in the world. Our republic is making an 
effort to strengthen its relations with all the countries in the 
world. Meanwhile, it focuses particular attention on 
cooperation with its neighbors. We attach great importance to 
the further improvement of our relations with Turkey because the 
peoples of the two countries have been bound by a common history 
for many centuries. 
  President Aliyev outlined in detail the war in Azerbaijan 
and 
the problems of more than one million very miserable people who 
have become refugees in their own homeland as a result of 
Armenia's aggression, and explained the true nature of the 
Karabakh dispute, which was artificially created. He also 
explained Azerbaijan's effort to end the war through talks, the 
mediation effort of international organizations, and the peace 
initiatives made by several influential countries in the world. 
He reiterated that Azerbaijan does not wish to fight a war and 
stressed: Azerbaijan's people have arisen to struggle to 
liberate their territory from the aggressor, which has 
disregarded the resolutions adopted by international 
organizations and the mediation effort made by several countries. 
  President Aliyev also outlined the democratic developments 
in 
Azerbaijan.

"Cabinet of Ministers Denies Secret Censorship Has Been Imposed. 
The Question, However, Has Nevertheless Been Discussed in the 
Corridors of Power"] 
  [Text] The other day POSTFACTUM distributed a report that 
staffers of the Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers have been 
prohibited, in violation of the republic's current legislation, 
from giving information to the independent mass media. The news 
agency's correspondent, citing reliable sources, said that the 
decision was made 7 February at a government meeting chaired by 
Vagif Nagiyev, Cabinet of Ministers chief of staff. All 
staffers were given an instruction prohibiting direct contacts 
with the press. Only the Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers press 
service was allowed to deal with independent journalists. 
  Your SEGODNYA correspondent asked Kyamal Katibli, chief of 
the Cabinet of Ministers press service, to comment on the 
report. Mr. Katibli said in a telephone conversation that the 
matter had never been discussed at any level and that the press 
reports did not square with reality. "No one has barred members 
of the Cabinet of Ministers from contacting the mass media," Mr. 
Katibli said. 
  Meanwhile, your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned that the 
problem was in fact discussed unofficially in Azerbaijani 
corridors of power. Government members were recommended not to 
disclose information anonymously. A person speaking to 
journalists should introduce himself and bear responsibility for 
his words. Seeing that no government members would dare make 
any sensational statements for the press given the difficult 
sociopolitical situation in the republic, POSTFACTUM's report 
should not be seen as false. It has simply not been fully 
clarified.

  [Text] Bishkek, 12 Feb [date as received] -- Today Askar 
Akayev, the president of Kyrgyzstan, addressed his compatriots. 
He thanked his fellow citizens who had expressed confidence in 
him at the nationwide referendum on 30 January. Akayev 
confirmed his adherence to the policy of interethnic accord and 
said that this policy was and will be the important priority of 
his state activities. The president said that he will use the 
political results of the referendum to strengthen all branches 
of power and to coordinate their activities to work efficiently 
for solving the most important problems of the society. The 
head of the state expressed the belief that the present 
situation in Kyrgyzstan demands firm and decisive actions, and 
these will follow soon. Decrees "On Urgent Measures on 
Strengthening State and Financial Discipline" and "On Urgent 
Measures on Strengthening Law and Order and Reinforcing the 
Fight Against Infringers of the Law," which were signed today by 
the president, have become the first steps in this direction. 
  The president said: We consider democracy, above all, as the 
strictest maintenance of law and public order. He said that he 
is confident that unity, friendship, and accord between the 
peoples of Kyrgyzstan will help the country to overcome 
difficult ordeals.

  [Text] Bishkek, 10 Feb -- President Askar Akayev has today 
signed a decree "On Urgent Measures To Strengthen State and 
Finance Discipline," introducing tough measures aimed at 
bringing Kyrgyzstan out of the economic crisis. 
  The document says that the republic continues sliding into 
the economic abyss. This is caused, among other things, by a 
sharp deterioration of finance, tax, and budget discipline. For 
example, in the fourth quarter of 1993 taxes accounted for 7.2 
percent of the gross domestic product, whereas the appropriate 
level would have been 20 to 25 percent; in January 1994 this 
figure dropped to just 2.6 percent. 
  The president regards this situation as undermining the 
country's economic independence. To prevent this, he has 
introduced a number of measures by decree. These include 
creating a department of tax police, substantial fines, 
withdrawal of registration certificates from companies, 
instituting criminal proceedings against those concealing their 
incomes, a tenfold increase in state excise tariffs, and a 
20-fold increase in tax on land and in tax on private vehicles. 
Under the decree, no tax or customs rebates will be granted. 
It orders that a single computer network listing all tax-payers 
be created in the country. 
  Declarations of all company accounts as they were on 1 
January 1994 are to be submitted. The decree instructs the 
National Bank to exercise strict control over credits and 
monetary emission, introduces a limit for bank credits, and 
completely forbids granting hard currency credits to 
enterprises. The National Bank is requested to begin 
immediately those actions aimed at preventing insolvency, 
including reorganization and -- if necessary -- liquidation of 
insolvent state enterprises.

  [Text] Bishkek, 10 Feb--Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev 
today issued an edict "On Urgent Measures to Strengthen Law and 
Order and to Step Up the Struggle Against Violations of the 
Law". The document describes the state of law and order in the 
republic as critical. The main reasons for this, as spelled out 
in the text of the edict, "are the worsening socioeconomic and 
political situation, a fall in people's living standards, a 
lowering of public morals, and the legal nihilism that has 
gripped society and the power structures". 
  The president believes that the problem is so acute that it 
must be made a priority, a nationwide task upon which the 
stabilization of the situation and the fate of economic reforms 
in the country is depending. The edict instructs the government 
to work out before 1 April a state program on the strengthening 
of public order. Power ministries must organize the patrolling 
of urban streets and residential areas. To achieve this, it is 
being proposed that the general public be drawn into this 
process and that material incentives for this work be introduced. 
  At the same time, measures are being stepped up in the 
procedure for checking passports. The document provides the 
media with the opportunity to inform the population about how 
the state's anti-crime program is proceeding.

that Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has decided to take

supreme commander-in-chief, Shevardnadze's aide Teimuraz 
Stepanov, who is currently in Moscow, told ITAR-TASS on Monday. 
  Stepanov believes that Shevardnadze has made this decision 
in 
order not to create new tension in society. Perhaps in 
conditions of instability this is the only correct decision, the 
aide added.

  [Text] The Georgian head of state, Eduard Shevardnadze, 
made a speech at the session of the Georgian parliament today. 
He spoke briefly about the results of the recent Russo-Georgian 
talks, emphasizing that the signing of the bilateral 
comprehensive agreement was the most important occasion in the 
history of new Georgia. The head of state said that this had 
put an end to the political and economic isolation of the 
republic and initiated a legal basis in the relations between 
the two states. 
  In Eduard Shevardnadze's view, the unsettled political and 
economic state of Georgia has a very adverse effect upon the 
country. A deep paralysis covers all spheres of economy in 
Georgia. Eduard Shevardnadze emphasized that the escalation of 
confrontation between Russia and Georgia has a profound effect 
on the issue of Abkhazia and the situation in Samachablo [South 
Ossetia], thus making the problem of the settlement of conflicts 
in the autonomous regions of the country more difficult. It 
also impedes an important process of the creation of the 
national army. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze expressed the view that Georgia's 
membership in the CIS became the first step toward the 
Russo-Georgian treaty being signed then in Tbilisi and serving 
interests of the two countries. 
  The chairman of the Georgian parliament drew the 
parliament's 
attention to the fact that Russia, in making economic 
commitments, would allow the republic to catch its breath, and 
that this really is very important. 
  The head of state expressed the thought that it is very 
important that the two countries agree to have a contingent of 
Russian frontier forces guard the border [with Turkey] until 
professional Georgian cadres are trained. Otherwise, Georgia's 
borders will be unprotected. 
  Mr. Shevardnadze said that arms required for the Georgian 
armed forces and interior troops would be received through 
Russian channels. As for the settlement of the Abkhazian 
conflict, Russia will have a decisive role in this issue, 
whatever resolutions the UN Security Council will have passed. 
  Speaking of military cooperation between Russia and Georgia, 
Eduard Shevardnadze said that this is a matter of strategic 
alliance of the two countries linked historically and in many 
other ways. 
  The Georgian leader appealed to the deputies to take a 
realistic approach to the existing situation and to make an 
unbiased assessment of the possibilities of alternative variants 
when making a decision on any issue. 
  When answering questions asked by members of parliament, the 
head of state requested that they demonstrate better manners and 
proper reciprocal respect when working at the highest 
legislative body of the country.

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze, addressing the 
parliament session in Tbilisi Thursday, has said that without 
restoring economic relations with Russia the republic will be 
unable to pull out of the crisis. There is no alternative to 
relations with Russia and this refers to all spheres: social, 
cultural, economic, military and others, he said. The 
parliament session discussed measures to stabilize the coupon 
(monetary unit) of the Georgian National Bank and the situation 
in the Ghali Region of Abkhazia. 
  Commenting on the signing of the Russian-Georgian agreements 
during the recent visit to Tbilisi by Russian President Yeltsin, 
Shevardnadze said that this had created the legal basis for 
equal relations between the two countries. Of special 
importance for Georgia, he said, is the package of economic 
agreements. Shevardnadze has said that it is necessary now to do 
everything so that the two countries' parliaments to ratify the 
signed agreements. 
  Speaking about the situation in the Ghali Region of 
Abkhazia, 
the Georgian leader described the actions by the Abkhazian armed 
units as another fascist sortie. There is only one way out, he 
said. It is to settle the conflict politically. This could be 
achieved, he said, if UN peacekeeping forces or Russian troops 
are deployed in the zone of conflict.

<F P=106> [From the "Details" program] </F>
  [Text] [Svanidze] "Details" is in Georgia following in the 
steps of the Russian president's visit to Georgia. Good day to 
you. 
  Previously Georgia was associated with the sea, fruit and 
loving brunettes. Now life is tough in this country. Average 
wages amount to approximately 3-4,000 rubles a month. Prices 
are almost the same as those in Moscow. People do not venture 
into the streets after 1900. Lord knows how they manage to live 
here. Nobody has given us a clear answer to this. Georgia is 
actually standing on the edge of the precipice, and that is why 
the people were expecting a miracle to happen after President 
Yeltsin's visit. A person writing to a local newspaper said that 
he was waiting for Yeltsin's visit more than for one from his 
own mother. 
  [Video cuts to show Svanidze interviewing Eduard 
Shevardnadze 
in a room] 
  [Svanidze] Georgia is in a very difficult situation. 
President Yeltsin paid a visit to Georgia. A whole package of 
documents was signed. What will change now if something is 
expected to change? 
  [Shevardnadze] A lot will change for the better if we really 
get down to implementing all that was discussed and signed, and 
if this process is not dragged out. 
  [Svanadze] The living standards are far higher in Russia 
compared with those in Georgia. So, was the aim to tie up with 
Russia? 
  [Shevardnadze] The matter was about restoring the economic 
ties between enterprises, towns and regions that had been set up 
during many decades and the two past centuries. I think that 
the breaching of those ties was an anomaly. There was that 
naive approach toward this matter. 
  [Svanadze] Did you always think like this? 
  [Shevarnadze] I always thought like this. 
  [Svanadze] What is your attitude toward the expansion of the 
ruble zone into Georgia? 
  [Shevardnadze] This issue has not yet been examined. We are 
having extensive debate on this issue. First, I am not sure 
that Russia will simply open the door and that tomorrow we will 
find ourselves in the ruble zone. 
  [Svanadze] Would you like this to happen? 
  [Shevardnadze] One will have to think about that. If we 
strive to achieve, and achieve the revival of economic life -- 
this should be virtually achieved in matter of several months -- 
then there will be a better picture on whether the national 
currency has any prospects. Naturally, the present financial 
situation is deplorable; this was inevitable. 
  [Svanidze] What made Boris Yeltsin sign the treaty with 
Georgia at this particular moment? 
  [Shevardnadze] In connection with the Georgian-Ossetian and 
the Georgian-Abkhazian conflicts, some of the Russian leaders 
thought it was necessary to retain this lever for exerting 
pressure on the Georgian leadership. They meant that this is in 
Georgia's interest, while Russia could live without a treaty. 
We have lost a great deal by not signing it earlier. I am 
convinced that if a year ago we had signed a large-scale treaty, 
a major agreement, and all the documents on military cooperation 
we have signed now, perhaps it would have been possible to avert 
the Abkhazian tragedy. 
  [Svanidze] I know that when Sukhumi was virtually on the 
brink of capitulation, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 
proposed that you introduce a considerable contingent of Russian 
troops -- up to two divisions, as far as I know -- in order to 
help you to take the situation in control. You refused then. 
Now, under the present treaty, you are in fact agreeing to more 
than just that. Do you think you then made a mistake? 
  [Shevardnadze] Yes, that's true, the question then was 
whether we would manage to defend Sukhumi, because considerable 
forces were advancing, including not only Abkhazians, but 
mercenaries as well. At the time I did not act with sufficient 
firmness of principle and courage. There were my young 
colleagues at my side and I was told that if this happened -- I 
mean if the two divisions were brought in -- they would resign. 
If this demonstrative resignation had taken place, it would 
have had a very negative effect on the then situation in 
Georgia. Therefore, I started looking for some compromise 
solutions, but Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev found them 
unacceptable. Several days later the situation became 
aggravated. I think this was a miscalculation on my part. I 
should have done it, although the Georgian people were not ready 
for this, so to speak. 
  [Svanidze] Are they ready for it now? 
  [Shevardnadze] I think that if one takes the whole complex 
of 
agreements, which had already been signed, the majority of 
people approve of them. Approximately 70 percent of the 
population now support my line, as it were, as far as this 
matter is concerned. 
  [Svanidze] During his meeting with you, President Yeltsin 
spoke not just about establishing friendly relations between 
Russia and Georgia but also about becoming allies. What does it 
imply for Russia and Georgia? It means the construction of a 
network of military bases on the territory of Georgia. 
Officially, they are talking about three bases, but as far as I 
know they are talking, in fact, about the creation of seven 
military bases. This would mean that -- bearing in mind the 
difference in population and might of the two countries -- 
Georgia becomes Russia's outpost in the Caucasus, and if one 
were to call things by their own names these relations will 
acquire a vassal nature. Are you happy with this scenario? 
Don't you think that this treaty is a diplomatic defeat for 
Georgia? 
  [Shevardnadze] As for the military bases -- and you are 
saying there might be up to seven -- we have them in 
approximately three locations. They already exist. We really 
ought to be talking about the duration of the stay of the 
Russian Army in Georgia. There is a division stationed in 
Batumi. There is another division stationed in Akhalkalaki. 
There are also military units near Tbilisi and in some of the 
Tbilisi districts. There is a Russian battalion in Sukhumi and 
there is another one in Gudauta. So if one looks at the present 
state of things they will not really change much. Our relations 
are being put on a civilized footing. 
  [Svanidze] Incidentally, you have just counted five 
locations. 
  [Shevardnadze] Uh? 
  [Svanidze] You have just counted five locations. 
  [Shevardnadze] No, I do not think that you can count Sukhumi 
and Gudauta as bases. There are units which are stationed there 
temporarily. They can be moved to Batumi, or if we do not agree 
to it...[pauses] But we are more likely than not to agree 
because their future presence here is simply necessary. Let us 
see if there are other options. Where Georgia's interests lie, 
so to speak? Just now we have looked into Russia's interests. 
Yes, naturally, Russia is interested in having its armed forces 
here in Georgia, in the Transcaucasian region. It is interested 
in this -- again, for the sake of stability in the southern part 
of the country, a large part of it -- and the question, as you 
know, is not that simple. And Georgia? I have already spoken 
about stability in general. How Georgia will build its own army 
if there is no proper support from Russia. 
  [Svanidze] Speaking about this treaty: In the view of the 
conditions put forward initially, who gets the best deal as a 
result -- Russia or Georgia? 
  [Shevardnadze] I think that so far Russia has got more out 
of 
it. But in the long term I think Georgia will get what is due 
to it. 
  [Svanidze] Is it true that you have on several occasions 
suggested to Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin that you will be prepared 
to resign from the post of head of the Georgian state in the 
interests of improving relations between Russia and Georgia? 
  [Shevardnadze] I have always said and will say it again -- I 
am ready to do so. If Russia is not unequivocally happy with 
Shevardnadze as a political figure, and if, as is in some 
circles, he is even viewed with hostility -- I am prepared to 
leave. I have tried to do this before. Unfortunately, I did 
not succeed. 
  [Svanidze] Am I to understand then that the question of 
whether you remain head of the Georgian state is mainly 
determined by Yeltsin? 
  [Shevardnadze] No, that is not so. It is not Yeltsin who 
decides this, but I am prepared, all the same. If Russia 
believes that Shevardnadze can be an impediment to the 
development of normal, good and neighborly relations between the 
two states, I am prepared to leave. Even now, right after this 
conversation is over.

  [Text] Tbilisi, February 12 (SNARK)--"The agreement on 
collaboration signed in Tbilisi by Boris Yeltsin and Eduard 
Shevardnadze puts a great responsibility on the interior troops 
of Georgia. I am convinced that the stabilization of the 
internal political situation in our country will promote the 
ratification of the Russian-Georgian agreement in State Duma", 
Vladimir Chikovani, commander of Georgian Interior Ministry's 
troops has told today SNARK in his exclusive interview. 
  "I hope very much that consultations and experience exchange 
with our Russian colleagues will help us to form interior troops 
and to improve their activity", said General Chikovani. 
  Refuting the statements that Russian troops take part in 
order providing in criminal regions of Georgia, Vladimir 
Chikovani declared: "It is out of the question. The Russian 
guys are not engaged in any incident on Georgian territory, but 
those connected with the Group of Russian troops in 
Transcaucasia." 
  Speaking on the Abkhazian problem, Vladimir Chikovani 
mentioned that for realization of the Geneva Agreement on 
Abkhazia a necessity may arise to return to the idea of creation 
joint Georgian-Russian Interior troops. Earlier this idea was 
discussed last year at the Sochi negotiations, devoted to the 
Abkhazian conflict's settlement.

  [Text] Moscow February 11 TASS -- In order to prevent a new 
outbreak of hostilities on the territory of Abkhazia, the 
republic's government has asked the president of the 
Confederation of Caucasian Peoples Yuriy Shanibov to send 50 
observers, representing all the peoples affiliated to the 
confederation, who will be posted along the Inguri River, 
marking the border between Georgia and Abkhazia, the press 
service of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet reports. 
  The letter notes that the Russian leadership had concluded a 
treaty with Georgia at a time when the situation is most 
unstable in the region and the Georgian leadership has started 
to exploit it in its aggressive plans against the people of 
Abkhazia. The Abkhazian side claims that Georgian special 
services are staging subversive and terroristic acts against 
Abkhazian servicemen in the border Gali District.

  [Text] At the consultations on the political status of 
Abkhazia which ended in Moscow today, Georgian and Abkhazian 
experts discussed setting up a special body for handling issues 
of the two republics' joint jurisdiction. 
  The Abkhazian permanent representative to Moscow, Igor 
Akhba, 
who also took part in the consultations and the head of the 
Georgian experts' group, Irakly Machavariani, told Interfax that 
the joint jurisdiction was supposed to include issues related to 
foreign policy and trade, customs service and border guards, 
human rights protection, the energy sector, transportation and 
the credit and financial systems. 
  The two sides decided not to speculate on the question as to 
whether Abkhazia will remain part of Georgia or not, but to 
solve specific issues. Both Akhba and Machavariani consider 
this as a constructive side of the dialogue. The Georgian 
expert even noted that he had not expected such progress. 
  At the same time, neither of the sides retreated from its 
positions. The Abkhazian delegation supports the republic's 
independence from Georgia, equal relations, and does not rule 
out the possibility of creating a confederation of the two 
states. On the contrary, the Georgian side insists on 
preserving Georgia as a single state embracing Abkhazia. 
  Machavariani said that the head of the experts' group, UN 
representative and professor at the University of Geneva Giorgio 
Malinverni, will prepare a report on the results of the 
consultations for the third round of the Georgian-Abkhazian 
talks in Geneva scheduled for February 22. Malinverni asked 
both sides to prepare their proposals as to which powers they 
wanted to delegate to the joint power body.

  [Text] Today, a CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY correspondent 
spoke to Mr. Otar Beridze, minister of justice of the Abkhazian 
Autonomous Republic, who is a member of a group of experts at 
the Moscow negotiations over the statute of Abkhazia. During 
the telephone conversation, he said that in comparison with the 
first round of the negotiations, the second one was a step 
forward because detailed discussion started on the issue of a 
future political statute of Abkhazia, of course, within the 
context of Georgia's integrity. Delimitation of functions of the 
central governing bodies, the parliament, various government 
agencies, and other issues have been discussed. The 
negotiations stopped at this stage. 
  During the negotiations, Mr. Otar Beridze said, we had to 
speak about the recent tragedy in Galiy Rayon. Based on the 
official statements made by our government and the parliament, 
our group of experts made an appropriate statement, as well. It 
has been published in the Russian press. The text of the 
statement was sent to representatives of the United Nations and 
the CSCE. The Abkhazian party reacted to our statement in 
silence claiming that they did not want to be involved in 
arguments since they had their own views on the events. 
  The issue of the return of refugees was also discussed 
during 
the negotiations. However, the Abkhazian party still insisted 
that the return of the displaced be carried out on the basis of 
the filtration. Unfortunately, the Russian representatives 
backed up this idea. The Georgian party considered this way of 
formulating the problem as absolutely unacceptable. 
  In conclusion, Otar Beridze said that the group of experts 
would still have meetings in Moscow after the third round of 
negotiations on the settlement of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict, 
planned to be held in Geneva on 22 February.

  [Text] Moscow February 11 TASS -- Four-day consultations of 
experts from Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia, the United Nations 
Organization and CSCE have failed to coordinate stands of the 
conflicting sides on the Abkhazian political status. 
  Any center and region are out of the question, since Georgia 
and Abkhazia will be equal partners, head of the Abkhazian 
delegation Andrey Dzhirgenia told ITAR-TASS. 
  The Abkhazian side insists on greater autonomy in many 
aspects of state life. It has offered to create a special body 
in charge of joint competence in foreign policy, trade, customs 
and border services, power engineering, transport and 
credit-financial policy. In the opinion of the Abkhazian side, 
the rest should be in the exclusive competence of Georgian and 
Abkhazian power structures. 
  The Abkhazian delegation does not agree to make its republic 
a Georgian land, whose powers will not exceed social issues, 
culture and fishing. 
  Sources at the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet's press service told 
ITAR-TASS, the sides are to submit more detailed proposals by 
the next round of Geneva negotiations scheduled for February 23.

  [Text] Tbilisi, February 10. (SNARK) -- "Recent events in 
Abkhazia which resulted in new victims among the civilian 
Georgian population represent an intended action aiming to 
prevent the peace settlement process of conflict", said in his 
exclusive interview to SNARK Shalva Pitchkhadze, the state 
adviser of Georgian President. Characterizing the military 
actions in Feb. 7 and 8 as "bacchanalia", developed by Gudauta 
separatists against the Georgian population, the result of which 
were hundreds of innocent civilians, Eduard Shevardnadze's 
adviser observed: "Abkhazians deliberately torpedoed the Geneva 
negotiations process. Naturally, the refugee's return to Gali 
region since Feb. 10, as agreed in Geneva, is out of question". 
  On these days, said Pitchkhaladze, Eduard Shevardnadze will 
appear with a statement on recent events in Abkhazia.

"Abkhazia"] 
  [Excerpt] The Republic of Abkhazia Supreme Soviet 
circulated a statement yesterday contending that "there is no 
single bilateral document today attesting to the fact that 
Abkhazia and Georgia are a single state having common 
territory." It is also stressed in the statement that no 
international-law agreement concluded by Georgia's leadership 
has either anything to do with Abkhazia or is valid on its 
territory. 
  Observers believe such a statement has appeared now because 
the Georgian leaders have stepped up their foreign policy 
activities and signed on behalf of Georgia, as a single state, a 
number of interstate agreements. [passage omitted]

of the Head of State. [passage omitted] 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What does your service concern 
itself with in the main? 
  [Kandelaki] First and foremost, the interests of the state. 
I consider it intolerable when the mass media distorts certain 
facts and interprets them in its own way, while not attaching 
great significance to this. In such cases, it is a question of 
the violation of the interests of the state. We demand from all 
the mass media -- we also cooperate with the opposition press -- 
accuracy and authenticity. [passage omitted] 
  [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Finally, the matter of 
censorship. Does it exist or not? Moreover, to what extent is 
its existence justified in general? 
  [Kandelaki] I believe there is no censorship now. It is 
another matter that each journalist should have, so to speak, 
his own internal censorship that functions regardless of his 
personal sympathies and antipathies. Moreover, the criterion 
for assessing phenomena of one kind or another should be the 
interests of the state.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>
  [Text] Washington February 11 TASS -- The main objective of 
the NATO policy in Bosnia is not the armed struggle against 
Serbs, but the protection of the integrity of Sarajevo and of 
residents of that city, U.S. President Bill Clinton told 
journalists on Thursday [10 February]. 
  Responding to the question on whether or not the NATO 
countries are ready to start bombing Serbian positions in Bosnia 
without the "silent consent" of Moscow, Clinton said one should 
bear in mind that NATO's actions are in line with U.N. actions. 
Russia, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, 
took part in the drawing up of the U.N. policy in Bosnia. 
  Clinton said he had received a letter from the Russian 
president on Wednesday morning. He would like to use it as a 
basis for a telephone conversation with Boris Yeltsin, but could 
not reach him by telephone. He hopes the Russian president will 
agree to help in promoting the process of a peaceful settlement 
in Bosnia. 
  The U.S. President said he did not know what technical 
problems may prevent him from reaching Yeltsin by telephone for 
the second day in succession. However, senior officials of the 
two countries have been holding for two days active 
consultations on the situation in Bosnia. Specifically, such 
consultations were held by U.S. Representative at the United 
Nations Organisation Madeleine Albright and U.S. Ambassador to 
Russia Thomas Pickering. According to Clinton, there is no 
reason to believe that some serious problem may hamper the joint 
advance of the two countries. 
  Dee Dee Myers, press secretary of the U.S. President, said 
at 
a briefing in the White House that Clinton and Yeltsin had not 
been able to speak on the telephone for technical reasons and a 
considerable time difference. President Clinton tried to reach 
Yeltsin by telephone on Wednesday, but, unfortunately, they did 
not have a conversation, the press secretary continued. He 
repeated his attempt on Thursday. They have not managed to 
speak so far, and she hopes Clinton will make it on Friday.

  [Text] Moscow February 11 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin was prepared for telephone talks with President Bill 
Clinton on Bosnia on February 9 and 10, as proposed by the U.S. 
side, but the talks did not take place for reasons beyond the 
Russian side's control, according to a competent source in the 
Russian president's staff. 
  Officials of the presidential communications service told 
ITAR-TASS the Russian side had ensured all the required 
technical prerequisites for the telephone talks between the two 
presidents.

  [Text] Odessa February 10 TASS -- A transport airliner 
carrying a group of servicemen from the Odessa Military District 
left the Ukrainian city of Nikolayev for Sarajevo on Thursday. 
They are to replace the fighters of the Ukrainian battalion who 
have already served their time in U.N. Peacekeeping Forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to Commander of the Odessa Military District 
Vladimir Shkidchenko, the current rotation is not a usual one, 
since a unit of Ukrainian volunteers will for the first time 
include eight women, largely surgical nurses. Earlier, 
Ukrainian servicemen had to seek for medical assistance in 
American and German hospitals and to pay for this in hard 
currency. 
  The Ukrainian parliament passed a decision to increase the 
numerical strength of the Ukrainian battalion in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina up to 1,220 fighters, the commander reported. 
Preparations for this have already got underway, including on 
the basis of the Nikolayev garrison's training centre.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian carries in its "Novosti" newscast at 
1500 GMT on 10 February three reports from correspondents in 
Nizhniy Novgorod, Novosibirsk, and Omsk on how the communication 
workers' action is affecting radio and television broadcasting. 
  Aleksandr Tsirulnikov reports from Nizhniy Novgorod that the 
local communications workers have just ended blocking Ostankino 
radio and television programs. The Russian channel has been 
switched on, too. Television viewers in the town and oblast 
will therefore be able to watch the scheduled evening programs. 
Earlier, Ostankino Television's first channel carried nothing 
except the three "Novosti" bulletins. The second channel 
carried only two "Vesti" bulletins. The oblast's governor has 
promised the communication workers help in securing funding for 
maintenance work on broadcasting equipment. 
  Oleg Ryzhov reports from Novosibirsk that the main 
television 
channels have remained silent since the morning. 
  Vera Morozova reports from Omsk that television screens 
during the day were blank until the screening in the early 
evening of news bulletins on all three channels including the 
St. Petersburg channel.

  [Text] Viewers in more than 30 Russian cities are now able 
to watch only news reels on two state-run channels of the 
Ostankino and Russian TV companies, head of the Communications 
Ministry's radio and TV relay stations Stanislav Glubokov told 
Interfax. The measure does not affect Moscow though the number 
of broadcasts in St. Petersburg have been reduced, he said. 
  Cutbacks in the number of TV programs on two state-run 
channels follows a decision by communications workers in 
response to a Rbl 80 Bn debt run by the Ostankino and All Russia 
TV companies. 
  Russian PM Viktor Chernomyrdin after Wednesday's meeting 
with 
Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak and Ostankino TV Company 
Chairman Alexander Yakovlev instructed the Finance Ministry to 
raise funds to help phase out the debt. 
  Glubokov said regional broadcasting would resume as 
repayment 
was made.

Baltin"] 
  [Text] Yuriy Meshkov, president of the Crimean Republic, 
on 7 February met with Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander of the 
Black Sea Fleet, in Sevastopol at the Black Sea Fleet 
Headquarters. Yu. Meshkov pointed out that the Black Sea Fleet 
"has been and continues to be a guarantor of stability on the 
peninsula." In his opinion, the problem of the Black Sea Fleet 
must be resolved in the interests of all CIS members, taking 
into account the expression of will of the peoples residing in 
the Crimea and of its supreme legislative and executive bodies. 
"The question of the fleet, Sevastopol, and the Crimea is a 
triune problem of the relations between Russia and Ukraine," 
stressed Meshkov. Admiral E. Baltin, in turn, expressed the 
hope that the problem of the Black Sea Fleet would be resolved 
as soon as possible. He is convinced that the problem of the 
Black Sea Fleet will be resolved "with an account of the 
opinions of the Black Sea sailors and residents of Sevastopol."

  [Text] An war plane with unidentified markings violated the 
Armenian Republic's airspace over its southern border at 1130 
today and flew at great height toward Kapanskiy Rayon. The 
invading airplane dropped two cluster bombs near the defensive 
positions around Yegvard in the rayon. Unfortunately, the foggy 
weather prevented determining from which country the airplane 
came. 
  The Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported that it 
is assumed that it took off from the Iranian border. 
  Armenia's air-defense forces have taken relevant measures. 
Data on the fate of the warplane are being determined. 
  The same source reported that two SU-25 war planes, this 
time 
certainly from Iranian territory, invaded Megrinskiy Rayon and 
dropped two cluster bombs on the railway station at 1540. 
  They later flew toward Kapanskiy Rayon and dropped two more 
cluster bombs on the borders. The two aircraft then flew toward 
Iran. 
  Data on the consequences of the bombing are being 
determined. 
  Taking into consideration that the war planes appeared from 
the territory of a neutral country, Armenia's air-defense forces 
did not take counter-measures. 
  The aforesaid violations were also registered by the Russian 
border troops stationed in Armenia, and the Armenian Armed 
Forces command was informed about it.

  [Text] We begin our news bulletin with a report from 
Norway. Correspondent Saulius [name indistinct] reports: 
  [Correspondent] The Lithuanian president stopped in Oslo 
yesterday evening on his way to the Lillehammer Olympic Games. 
In the Norwegian capital, Algirdas Brazauskas met Norwegian 
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, Foreign Minister Bjoern 
Tore Godal, and members of the Storting Foreign Affairs 
Committee. 
  In his conversation with the Norwegian prime minister, 
Brazauskas expressed gratitude to the Nordic states for their 
constant concern and support for Lithuania and for ever closer 
contacts linking the Nordic Council and the Baltic states. It 
was noted that it is useful for Lithuania--which wishes to sign 
a free trade treaty with the European Union, is preparing to 
join the European Union, and is negotiating with the European 
Community--to get acquainted with Norway's experience. 
Lithuania has expressed its wish to become a NATO member and 
has signed the Partnership for Peace document. Norway, which 
has already joined that organization, could help Lithuania to 
become full member. 
  Satisfaction was expressed at the developing cooperation in 
economics, science, and culture. During the meeting with the 
parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee members, relations 
between the Seimas and the Storting were discussed. A great 
deal of attention was devoted to Lithuania's relations with 
Russia and their prospects. The Norwegians were interested in 
our relations with our closest neighbors, Belarus and Ukraine. 
It was noted that the relations of great states and their 
diktat to the smaller states are not correct and [passage 
indistinct]. 
  A similar discussion took place at the Norwegian Foreign 
Ministry with Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal, who was 
interested in the results of the negotiations with Ukraine and 
how relations with Belarus will develop. 
  Brazauskas arrived in Lillehammer late at night. The 
Lithuanian president will meet Norwegian King Harald V today and 
will attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Duma Chairman Ivan Petrovich Rybkin </F>
by Sergio Sergi in Moscow; date not given] 
  [Text] Moscow -- He cites the most famous Russian 
fairy-tale writers, but he likes Lenin the "social democrat." 
He cites French intellectuals and recalls popular proverbs. 
"Professor" Ivan Rybkin spoke with us in his office on the 18th 
floor of a glass skyscraper where the Duma, over which he 
presides, is located. 
  [Sergi] My first question: What concerns you most in the 
uncertain Russia of today? 
  [Rybkin] My chief concern is seeking consensus, seeking 
interaction between the various branches of power, between 
parliament and the president. I am dedicating a great deal of 
effort to this, and I do not think I have been wasting my time. 
The Duma representatives support me. We are convinced that 
nothing can be achieved in Russia without civil peace and 
consensus. The events in October put us on our guard: Russia's 
problems cannot be resolved by one force alone. 
  [Sergi] You talk about unity but how do you explain the 
Duma's vote concerning the establishment of a commission to 
inquire into the October happenings. Is that a challenge to 
Yeltsin? 
  [Rybkin] Absolutely not. We must always search for the 
truth. 
  [Sergi] Do you think the president will take this badly? 
  [Rybkin] I don't think so. We had a meeting and found that 
we were speaking the same language on many issues. 
  [Sergi] Can you rule out further clashes? 
  [Rybkin] Life is complicated. When we return home we never 
know how our wife will greet us... 
  [Sergi] And you always get home late... 
  [Rybkin] Let us say that on the whole there can be good 
relations with the president. Many people are starting to 
realize that sharing power does not mean causing rifts, by any 
means. The people want cooperation in power. 
  [Sergi] But I am not sure having the same parliamentary 
makeup helps. Yeltsin would have preferred a different 
parliament. 
  [Rybkin] I don't know; he has never expressed his 
disapproval. Moreover, how can he take it out on his own people? 
The citizens have their representatives. The parliamentary 
makeup reflects the moods of the people. 
  [Sergi] Would you call yourself a former Communist? 
  [Rybkin] Yes, I have already spoken about this. As far back 
as 1991 it was quite clear that there was a strong social 
democratic faction in the CPUS. Its declared program was quite 
clear and enshrined the principles of the plurality of property 
and economic management, and the principle of democratic unity 
instead of democratic centralism. The only name we can give 
that is social democracy. I think of Lenin, the NEP [New 
Economic Policy], and my grandfather who was right to say that, 
if Lenin had lived longer, a lot of things would have gone 
differently. Today I am saying that an accord can be reached 
between parliament, government, and the president. 
  [Sergi] So Fedorov did the right thing by resigning over the 
change in policy? 
  [Rybkin] Every cloud has a silver lining. 
  [Sergi] Your problem in the Duma is Zhirinovskiy. 
  [Rybkin] I would call that a problem of political and human 
temperament. 
  [Sergi] Do you consider him simply an intemperate deputy? 
  [Rybkin] What I just said is true, but there is something 
else as well. Probably he perceives keenly what others also 
perceive, for example a certain restlessness nationwide. He is 
seeking his electorate and finding it, just like any other 
politician. Is there any restlessness? Yes, and it can be 
exploited. That is what he is doing. Perhaps some people like 
that and find it useful. 
  [Sergi] The Duma and the war in Bosnia: Yes or no to the 
bombing? 
  [Rybkin] The whole world, especially Europe, has seen 
twice how easy it is to enter Serbia and also how difficult it 
is to get out. My experience tells me that those threatening to 
use weapons have not done their military service. My father was 
injured during the war in 1944 when he was 17, I wore my boots 
out during my military service, so did my brothers, and we have 
no desire to put them on again. Some would very much like to 
test new weapons in today's Europe. How many potential 
Chernobyl's lie hidden in Bosnia? 
  [Sergi] To what extent have nationalistic feelings 
influenced Russia's position? 
  [Rybkin] That is not true. The Russian people know what war 
is, they have had frequent firsthand experience. Think of the 
suffering in Leningrad. The feeling for suffering has always 
been a part of Russian awareness. Certain facts cannot be 
forgotten. 
  [Sergi] Let us talk about the government. Has the policy 
changed? No more shock therapy? 
  [Rybkin] It is always dangerous to make sudden changes. 
Doing "everything all at once" is very dangerous. Our 
monopolistic system cannot be destroyed with just one cavalier 
blow, nor was there any need to destroy it. Instead, many noses 
were broken. The country must simply try to gradually make the 
private and public sectors live together. 
  [Sergi] The Constitution does not assign much power to your 
parliament. 
  [Rybkin] Power is a subtle thing. Parliamentary power is 
even subtler. The fact is that what we rest on are the moods of 
the people, the great legitimacy of being elected 
representatives. We possess a powerful weapon called the 
formation of public awareness. What power does a priest have? 
Formally none. But... 
  [Sergi] Wouldn't you like to modify the Constitution? 
  [Rybkin] There are four or five points that qualify for 
change. But I would not worry about that now. The people 
understand. They know that there is too much power on one side. 
It is a matter of time. How much power did De Gaulle have in 
France? Yet parliament and the country helped him. It is a 
matter of time... 
  [Sergi] Except outside parliament... 
  [Rybkin] Those who think they can govern in that way are 
grossly mistaken. What happened in October was a defeat for 
everybody. 
  [Sergi] Yeltsin will adress the houses next Friday [18 
February]. Do you hope that he will hold out a hand? 
  [Rybkin] I am hoping for an unprejudiced view of the Russian 
political and economic situation. An honest analysis of what we 
have achieved and of what remains to be done. And how the 
president proposes to resolve the crisis. Including the help we 
can give him.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "State Duma Examines Amnesty </F>
Issue"] 
  [Text] On Friday the State Duma completed its first month's 
work. It is remarkable that during this time it has not only 
failed to adopt a single draft law regarding the pressing 
problems currently facing Russia, but it has also failed to 
submit any for examination. It is also symbolic that the Duma 
began its session Friday with the issue of providing backup 
services for its work. Deputy Nikolay Travkin reproached his 
colleagues with the fact that "having received 800,000 rubles 
each," they have been in no hurry to get down to lawmaking work. 
  Another "anniversary" observation. Joint sessions begin with 
"warm-up sessions" or discussions of the agenda lasting two 
hours or 90 minutes. As a rule, these are a kind of "stream of 
consciousness" during which it is possible to hear political 
statements, outbursts directed at arch-opponents, and comments 
on the business in hand. However, having worn out their nerves 
and wasted time on sorting out the agenda, its subsequent 
implementation is never brought to a conclusion. The same 
proposals are submitted at the next session all over again to be 
accompanied by the same discussion. 
  Basically, the Duma is being dragged into discrediting 
itself. It sometimes seems that certain forces are doing this 
deliberately. It is not at all hard to lead the nervous 
parliamentary audience on. 
  Thus on Friday 90 minutes were devoted to the agenda. It was 
not until midday that the deputies addressed legislative issues 
directly. These included the draft decree on the amnesty in 
connection with the adoption of the Russian Federation 
Constitution. In accordance with a decision made by the 
deputies, the issue of a general political and economic amnesty 
has also been submitted for examination. The issue chiefly 
involves the defendants in the State Committee for the State of 
Emergency case and people who are currently being investigated 
following their arrest in the events of October 1993. This is 
the first category. The second includes people who have received 
jail terms for economic crimes which are no longer considered 
offenses. 
  The State Duma's draft decree "On an Amnesty in Connection 
With the Adoption of the Russian Federation Constitution" 
proposes, among other things, that "defendants who have 
performed military service in operational armies and combined 
units and taken part in hostilities in defense of the Motherland 
or while performing military duties in connection with this" are 
to be let off. Moreover, a general pardon awaits men and women 
above the age of 60 and first and second category invalids. The 
list of names eligible for an amnesty is fairly wide. The only 
people to whom the state's mercy does not extend are recidivists 
and murderers.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 14 TASS--Sergey Filatov, head of the 
Russian president's administration, said that "All I's have been 
dotted and all T's have been crossed" in relations between 
Russia and Tatarstan. 
  Commenting on the situation on the eve of the signing of the 
Russian-Tatar treaty on relations due to take place on Tuesday, 
Filatov said that "the new Constitution, not ultimatums, has 
changed the situation in relations between Russia and Tatarstan." 
  He believes that the treaty will allow Russia "not to force 
the republic to sign the federal treaty, but conclude a 
bilateral agreement with it which would take into account the 
specific features of Tatarstan." 
  By saying this, Filatov has admitted the possibility of 
signing bilateral agreements between Russia and its constituent 
republics, which, as he believes, will not run counter to the 
Constitution. 
  "No one intends to prevent Tatarstan from raising the level 
of management in the republic to a higher level than in other 
subjects of the federation," Filatov said. 
  He expressed the hope that the signing of the treaty will 
promote trust between society and power and "people will be able 
to realise that there are no unsolvable deadlocks or situations." 
  Tatar President Mintimer Shaymiyev arrived in Moscow on 
Monday to take part in the signing ceremony.

  [Text] A relative calm has been prevailing on Armenia's 
borders for the past three days. The Armenian Defense Ministry 
press service reports that the only incident occurred on the 
evening of [date indistinct] February. An exchange of fire took 
place between 2120 and 2140 at the border near Diran in 
Idzhevanskiy Rayon. The enemy used howitzers, machine guns and 
automatic weapons. There were no casualties. 
  According to the Karabakh Defense Army press service, the 
Karabakh side managed to occupy another two strategically 
important heights in Kelbadzharskiy Rayon on the evening of 11 
February. In the afternoon, the enemy air force dropped bombs 
on Martuninskiy Rayon. 
  After a relative lull on Saturday, active combat operations 
resumed along most of the Karabakh front on Sunday. The main 
fighting took place in northern Kelbadzharskiy Rayon. The 
Karabakh formations launched a counterattack and managed to 
regain control of a number of heights near the Omar mountain 
pass. 
  On the same day, the Karabakh formations managed to halt a 
number of attacks by the Azerbaijani troops on the southeastern 
sector of the battlefront. After destroying one enemy tank and 
killing 30 soldiers, the Armenian fighters threw the 
Azerbaijanis back from the eastern borders of Martuninskiy Rayon. 
  A relative calm has again been prevailing along the entire 
war front since this morning.

  [Text] Stepanakert, February 14 (SNARK) -- The reports 
issued by TURAN NEWS AGENCY caused at least a surprise -- to the 
great surprise of Levon Melik-Shakhnazaryan, a parliamentary of 
the Karabakh Supreme Soviet, a Chairman of the Permanent 
Commission on External Relations, [who] according to these 
reports participated in a alleged meeting of the social and 
political leaders of Armenia with the representative of the Kurd 
Labour Party [Kurdish Workers Party, PKK] Zahir Bardani. TURAN 
says the meeting took place in Echmiadzin (Armenia) at the end 
of 1993. 
  "It was for the first time when I knew about such a meeting 
and my participation in it from TURAN reports issued on February 
12", Mr. Melik-Shakhnazaryan told SNARK. 
  The report mentions that the result of the as if [i.e. 
supposed] meeting was the as if partial move of the PKK 
Headquarters from Turkey to Armenia and the appearance of 600 
Kurd mercenaries within the Armenian detachments fighting in 
Azerbaijan. 
  "Official Baku is for numerous times trying to play the 
`Kurd 
game' to justify his unprecedented military failures at the 
Karabakh fronts", Mr. Melik-Shakhnazaryan underlined. According 
to him, the Azerbaijani authorities sometimes announce the 
Lachinskiy, Kubatlinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy regions which are 
under the control of Karabakh forces to be "Kurd lands", 
sometimes accuse Armenians of the cooperation with Kurds. The 
fact that the Echmiadzin town was elected by them as a place of 
the as if meeting is not occasional, Levon Melik-Shakhnazaryan 
considers. It's known, the Echmiadzin town is the center of the 
Armenians' spiritual life. So, Azeris make their provocation 
report the religious coloring. 
  Nevertheless, such statements are of the aim to justify the 
Afghan mujahedeens' participation in clashes against Armenians, 
the Azerbaijani Army's training of military instructors from 
Turkey, the USA and some states of the CIS. But such statement 
can't mislead the world community.

  [Text] Baku, February 14 (TURAN) -- It was reported during 
today's briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Azerbaijan that yesterday, Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov sent a 
letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressing 
Baku's positive attitude towards the NATO programme "Partnership 
for the sake of peace". Gasanov sees the programme as an 
important element of European security. 
  The letter also expresses hope that Azerbaijan will join 
this 
partnership since the programme includes regulations on 
respecting borders. 
  Today's scheduled visit of Georgian Foreign Minister, 
Alexander Chikvaidze, to Azerbaijan was postponed due to bad 
weather. However, towards the end of the day, the leader of the 
Georgian diplomatic representation is due to arrive in Baku. 
Important aspects to Azerbaijani-Georgian relations will be 
considered at this meeting. 
  Today the delegation of the Polish Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs is due to arrive in Baku as well. During meetings with 
Azeri Foreign Ministry officials, development of bilateral 
relations in policy, economy, culture will be discussed. The 
ratification of the treaty on friendship and cooperation, as 
well as bilateral treaties on cooperation in spheres of science, 
technology and culture are expected to take place. 
  Agshin Mehktiyev, a Foreign Ministry official said that due 
to diplomatic efforts by Baku, there has been positive movement 
towards U.S. policy vis-a-vis Congressional restrictions on 
government aid to Azerbaijan, which might lead to their 
abolition. Azeri Foreign Ministry officials say the White House 
and State Department have called for the annulment of Senator 
Kerry's amendment that was attached to the "Freedom Suport Act" 
(Title IX, Section 907). However, it is Congress that must vote 
the final decision. This Congressional amendment bans U.S. 
Government assistance, of most types, to the Government of 
Azerbaijan. 
  The representative of the Azeri Foreign Ministry expressed 
hope that the U.S. Congress will take a constructive position on 
this problem. 
  A visit by the Azeri president to the United Kingdom is 
expected in late December. The programme of this visit is being 
worked out now. Aliyev will meet and negotiate with British 
Prime-Minister John Major. The signing of the contract on 
friendship, cultural, scientific and technical cooperation is 
expected. The signing of bilateral treaty on cooperation in oil 
production is also expected.

  [Text] The transmission of programs by the Ostankino and 
Russian television channels could cease across the whole 
republic of Azerbaijan very soon. Since last November, Russia's 
major television companies have owed Azerbaijan's Communications 
Ministry over 500 million rubles for the hire of technical 
equipment and other services. This has obviously had its effect 
on payments between the communications and the energy sectors 
and has also delayed the salaries of specialists by several 
months. 
  A telegram demanding that the debt be cleared was sent to 
Moscow, and the reply--signed by the heads of technical services 
at the two television companies--came quite quickly: We have no 
money, and accept that transmission of our programs will be 
stopped. 
  The lack of a solution to the financial problems could lead 
to cuts in broadcasts by Azerbaijan's own national television. 
In the first two months of this year, the republic's Finance 
Ministry allocated only one quarter of the funds it needed to 
pay communications workers. 
  So, television could very well be added to our list of 
shortages very soon.

  [Text] Baku, February 14 (TURAN) -- During the last day 
attempts by the Armenians to attack Kelbadzharskiy, Terterskiy 
and Fizulinskiy failed, says the press-centre of the Azerbaijan 
Defense Ministry. The same source reports that all of Armenia's 
attempts of advance forward have been stopped. Sustaining 
tremendous losses, the Armenian units were forced to retreat to 
their previous positions. The Press-centre of the Defense 
Ministry denied information from Armenian sources saying that in 
the northern Kelbadzharskiy region 300 Azeri soldiers were 
surrounded. According to the Azeri Defense Ministry, the 
Armenian Army only placed some orderlies on a predominant hill 
and shelled the road connecting the Northern section of the 
Kelbadzharskiy region (which is controlled by the Azeri Army) 
with the remaining regions of the republic.

  [Text] Azerbaijani State Advisor for Military Issues 
Nuraddin Sadykhov told Interfax that the Azerbaijani army had 
"finally learned to fight and is now capable of defensive 
battle." "At last, it has learned to offer due resistance to 
Armenian offensives," he pointed out. 
  Sadykhov said that all Armenian attempts to launch an 
offensive over the last months "have been successfully repelled." 
  The state advisor indicated two reasons for Azerbaijan's 
military successes for the last month and a half. Firstly, the 
Azerbaijani armed forces have stood up on their own feet, 
surmounting obstacles, gaining strength, raising combat 
readiness, and forming various units. 
  Secondly, the Azerbaijani army got a second wind after 
Geydar 
Aliyev's election as president and his appeal to the people last 
November. "Then, all people recovered their self-confidence, 
many deserters started to return to their units, and the army 
became better equipped with hardware," the state advisor said. 
  As a result, the situation along the front line has 
gradually 
stabilized. An avalanche-like Armenian offensive was stopped, 
and a possibility to start "clearing Azerbaijan's territory from 
occupants" appeared. Sadykhov said "we had managed to free 
certain parts of the occupied territories." 
  At the same time, the official admitted that the republican 
army's current state could hardly be characterized as "high 
combat readiness." He said Azerbaijan desperately lacked 
military experts. 
  Sadykhov added that "last autumn's army draft plan was over- 
fulfilled." He pointed out that people started to ask to be 
sent to the army, to the front line, after the president's 
appeal."

  [Text] Kiev, 14 Feb -- Vasyl Durdynets, first deputy 
chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council and coordinator of the 
group of deputies for issues to do with ratification of the 
START Treaty, was interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent on 
nuclear problems and conditions for Ukraine to accede to the 
Lisbon protocol. 
  Durdynets noted that for these issues to be settled by the 
current parliament first of all guarantees from nuclear states 
are needed. There should be documents, in his opinion, which 
would make it legally binding on them not to use nuclear and 
conventional weapons against Ukraine, rule out economic pressure 
and guarantee the integrity and inviolability of our borders. 
  The Foreign Ministry is now at work developing the form of 
guarantees. Mr. Durdynets emphasized that the accession of 
Ukraine to the Lisbon protocol and the nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty as a non-nuclear state is unrealistic. This contravenes 
both its military doctrine and official foreign policy. Mr. 
Durdynets's view is that "a state owning nuclear weapons" is the 
most acceptable formula for Ukraine. 
  On the question of the funds required to dismantle Ukrainian 
nuclear weapons, Vasyl Durdynets said a group of experts from 
Kharkov's physics and technology institute worked out an 
estimate for this. It came up with the minimum sum of $2.8 
billion. This sum is at today's rate. Durdynets spoke in favor 
of setting up a nuclear disarmament fund under UN auspices. 
  With regard to selling conventional weapons, Mr. Durdynets 
stressed that 38 percent of the USSR's military industrial 
complex was concentrated in Ukraine, although this issue so far 
remains unresolved. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, in his 
view, ought to defend somewhat more actively Ukraine's right to 
trade arms with the international community. 
  Vasyl Kryuchkov, member of the standing committee for issues 
of defense and state security, is of the opinion that the 
minimum sum required to dismantle Ukrainian nuclear weapons is 
$5 billion. If done professionally, it could be as much as $10 
billion.

  [Text] RIA has learned that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's address to deputies of the Federal Assembly planned 
for Friday [18 February] was postponed to 24 February. A source 
close to the president, who wished to remain anonymous, said 
that the formal reason for the postponement could be the fact 
that the Kremlin's Marble Hall is not ready to hold such an 
event. However, it is not ruled out that the text of the annual 
address of the president may undergo some changes. At today's 
session of the Russian State Duma's Committee on Budget, its 
chairman, Mikhail Zadornov, told deputies that they could become 
acquainted with the text of the address, which had been received 
by the Duma.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Bykovskiy "Observer's Comments": "A Propos the </F>
Cold"] 
  [Text] When the current political elite began its ascent 
of the Mount Olympus of Russian politics at the end of the 
eighties it on the whole justly criticized many practices which 
existed in the Soviet Union. Amongst the most often cited sins 
in this regard was the absolute secrecy surrounding the personal 
life of the country's top officials, their health... 
  Since then only six or seven years have passed. But how much 
has changed! (Admittedly, we won't specify here in which 
direction this has been). However, the changes have scarcely 
really affected the aforementioned "delicate" question. People 
may object to this by saying that only last week the Russian 
president's administration reported that the president was 
working in his out-of-town residence because he was suffering 
from a cold. 
  All true: A report was issued and requisite explanation 
furnished. But this can hardly be regarded as adequate or 
exhaustive in a situation where the head of state is involved, 
particularly as we Russians have been continually urged by top 
officials in recent years to follow the example of "civilized" 
countries. Let's look at how such questions are resolved over 
there in the West and the United States, in particular. 
  The president's health, I read in an publicity handout 
specially prepared for President Clinton's visit to Moscow, is a 
significant indicator to Americans. When they vote in elections 
for a particular candidate they want to see not just that the 
future head of state's election manifesto meets their interests, 
they also want to see, the authors of the publicity handout 
specially stress this, a new White House incumbent who is 
vigorous, active, and undoubtedly healthy. 
  It is not surprising when the U.S. president is ill that 
journalists lay siege to the physicians who are treating him. 
And they answer numerous questions. Experts on American life 
claim that medical confidentiality does not exist in this 
instance. 
  However, while citing the American example I have no doubt 
at 
all that in a matter of days Boris Yeltsin's health will be 
restored and he will be delivering a message to the deputies of 
the Federal Assembly. So there would seem to be no special need 
to blow up the topic of the Russian president's suffering from a 
cold, there wouldn't be but for a radio report: Speaking to 
journalists, the American president complained that for some 
unknown technical reasons he had been unable to speak to Boris 
Yeltsin by telephone for two days. 
  The conversation between the presidents did, as you will 
know, eventually take place. However, it was somewhat late, in 
my opinion: After all, just a few days ago Bill Clinton was 
still wondering whether it was worthwhile for NATO to bomb 
Serbian positions near Sarajevo, while now it seems he is ready 
to support the NATO decision. 
  And the question is a really crucial one. If NATO starts 
bombing the Serbs, this will inevitably lead to heavy civilian 
casualties. Many military specialists, including Russian ones, 
have pointed out this danger. Moreover, there are serious fears 
that the possible bombing could be the start of World War III... 
  Incidentally, the (U.S.) White House press secretary already 
knows by 0800 hours the president's whole schedule for the next 
24 hours and can comment on much that is of interest to 
journalists. 
  And I have no doubt that if circumstances forced Clinton to 
leave for his out-of-town residence at Camp David, his press 
secretary would promptly and as fully as possible satisfy the 
far-from-idle interest in this event on the part of the mass 
media. 
  But what about in our country? In Russia we are beset by a 
very grave socioeconomic crisis; the number of strikes is 
growing; miners, gas, communications, agricultural workers and 
representatives of other sectors are demanding that the 
government settle its debts; conflicts are blazing in danagerous 
proximity to our country -- and we have silence! No one in the 
president's large administration takes the trouble to explain 
whether these questions come within the president's purview or 
whether they are being resolved.

  [Text] Moscow February 14 TASS--The government is in 
confusion and has no clear-cut plan of activity, former Finance 
Minister Boris Fedorov said. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Monday [14 
February], Fedorov said that the government adopts political 
decisions but has no means to carry them out. 
  Fedorov described the figures in the proposed budget for 
1994 
as unrealistic and accused the government of lack of political 
will in order to reduce unjustified expenses. 
  He also criticised the government for making concessions to 
coal miners and blasted the agrarian lobby for extorting state 
subsidies for the agro-industrial complex. Fedorov warned that 
this will only fuel inflation. 
  He denied that he delayed the payment of state debts in 
December 1993 in order to curb inflation.

  [Text] The All-Russia Center for the Study of Public 
Opinion conducted a representative poll between 10 January and 2 
February 1994 among 3,977 residents of Russia. 
  The answers to one of the questions in this survey -- Do 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's activities help the emergence out of 
today's crisis? -- is in percentages: 
  They do -- 11 
  They do not -- 43 
  They make no appreciable impact -- 11 
  Hard to say -- 35 
  Those who believe that Zhirinovskiy's activities facilitate 
a 
way out of the crisis are relatively more often workers and 
generally men (twice as many as women), persons below 30 years 
of age with an education less than secondary, with the lowest 
monthly incomes per one family member and living in a rural area 
and in Russia's south. 
  Those who, on the contrary, believe that the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia leader's activities are not helping 
resolve the crisis are more often than not entrepreneurs running 
their own businesses, managers of various ranks, women 
generally, and people below 30 (responding to this question, 
they have the greatest number of both positive and negative 
answers and the smallest number of neutral answers), with a 
higher, unfinished higher education, with high and medium per 
capita incomes, who live in capitals, big cities, and in the 
Urals. 
  Thus, the forecasts that Zhirinovskiy would augment the 
support received in the elections are not coming true.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Russian journalists will 
boycott news involving the government if Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin refuses to pay government subsidies owed to the 
media, their spokesman announced on Monday [14 February]. 
  The threat was made at a news conference here by Anatoly 
Ezhelev, president of the Emergency Committee for the Protection 
of the Press. 
  The committee, formed last month by the Union of Russian 
Journalists, called on the government to take urgent measures to 
"save freedom of the press" by paying debts and subsidies it 
owes to state radio and television, as well as the country's 
largest newspapers. 
  "People's right to receive news has become very expensive," 
said Ivan Laptev, president of Izvestia publishing house. 
  President of Russian state radio-television Oleg Popchov 
said 
that the relationship between journalists and the government 
amounts to "a dialogue of the deaf." 
  Half of Russia went without television programming on 
Thursday after communications companies went on strike over the 
government's refusal to pay an 80-billion ruble ($50 million) 
debt. The strike ended when the prime minister promised to pay 
the debt.

  [Text] Moscow February 14 TASS -- Journalists are going to 
continue the struggle for their economic survival, heads of 
journalists' unions of Russia and Moscow, the Glasnost 
Protection Fund and other organisations announced today at a 
press conference of the Committee for Emergency Measures to 
Protect the Press. 
  The immediate reason for calling the press conference was 
the 
situation at the TV. However, there are many other problems to 
be discussed. Journalists, who are considered the fourth power 
in Russia, insist that the government should keep the promises 
it gave to them, specifically, the January resolution dealing 
with providing support for the publication and circulation of 
mass media organs. 
  Oleg Poptsov, head of the Russian TV company, said that by 
today the government had decided to allocate to state-owned TV 
companies 51 per cent of the money they need. However, the 
Ministry of Finance allocated 18 per cent of what they need, 
without taking into account their debt to communication services 
in 1993. Poptsov regards the step taken by communication 
workers as a call for a general political strike and is sure 
that three days without radio and TV will be enough for the 
country to get out of control. 
  According to Anatoliy Yezhelev, chairman of the Committee 
for 
Emergency Measures to Protect the Press, journalists intend to 
display solidarity, defending their professional interests and 
the right of citizens to information. It is quite probable that 
another stoppage of TV and radio broadcasting will be followed 
by a call for the information boycott of the government's work. 
  Measures, suggested to the government by the Federal 
Committee for the Press, may change radically the economic 
situation of the press. According to chairman of the committee 
Boris Mironov, these include tax privileges, the granting of 
easy-term credits, the exemption from customs duties of the 
imported printing equipment and paper, etc. Vsevolod Bogdanov, 
chairman of the Russian Journalists' Union, believes that the 
state should take upon itself the legal protection of 
journalists and guarantee their access to information. 
  Heads of journalists' unions are going to insist on the 
keeping of promises. Editors-in-chief will have a meeting 
tonight with press secretary of the president Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, where they will discuss problems of journalists, 
Bogdanov told ITAR-TASS.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Feb -- Vyacheslav Kostikov, press 
secretary of the Russian president, has promised editors of 
central newspapers assistance in holding another meeting with 
the Russian Federation president. It is likely to take place in 
late February or early March, depending on the president's 
working schedule. 
  This was one of the main upshots of the conversation that 
Kostikov had today with editors in chief of leading 
publications. In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, 
the president's press secretary clarified that the meeting was 
called for by the growing concern of the media over "the 
abnormal situation in the press market". 
  "Newspapers are going bankrupt, and complex contradictions 
have emerged between the striving of newspapers to be 
independent and the understanding of the fact that the press 
will not survive without assistance from the state", he said. 
According to Kostikov, "it is necessary to find a precise 
combination of state aid to the press without infringing upon 
glasnost". 
  The head of state's press secretary added that the purpose 
of 
the meeting is to obtain first-hand, critical information that 
should be made known to the Russian Federation president.

Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Defense 
Ministry General Staff, handed in a request to resign before 
last weekend. 
  The chief of the General Staff sent the request to Supreme 
Commander Boris Yeltsin right after Kolesnikov had met with 
Pavel Grachev in person. In requesting his resignation, the 
colonel general writes that he wants no part in the further 
disintegration of the Russian Armed Forces. It is still unknown 
for how long the president will consider the request. 
Consultative meetings of Yeltsin with Grachev, his deputies, 
and commanders of combat arms are being planned already this 
week, however, where the question of the resignation of the 
chief of the General Staff will no doubt be raised.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "President Yeltsin's Mobile </F>
Soldiers. Army Will Deal With Terrorism"] 
  [Text] MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned from government 
sources that the Defense Ministry's elaboration of a statute on 
mobile forces is going full blast. To be created within the 
ministry's structure is a Mobile Forces directorate to be headed 
by a commander in chief of the Mobile Forces of Russia. He will 
probably be subordinated directly to the president. 
  This step would at least probably enable the Russian Army to 
come closer to the combat readiness standard of the Soviet Army, 
which as little as five years ago was capable of simultaneously 
landing two airborne divisions with all their equipment at any 
point on the globe. 
  The idea for the creation of mobile forces was first 
proposed 
by Colonel General Achalov, who commanded the airborne troops 
and who now is a Lefortovo prisoner. Gen. Achalov came forward 
with sensational proposals at a closed-door military-scientific 
conference in summer 1991, taking stock of the Persian Gulf war. 
It was also then that he was appointed to what was at the time 
a new position in the army -- deputy defense minister for 
emergency situations and special tasks. After a brief hiatus 
owing to the activities of Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, the last 
defense minister of the USSR, the mobile forces concept began to 
be carried out as a strategic direction of organizational 
development of the Russian Army. 
  Airborne Troops Commander Yevgeniy Podkolzin said in a 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS interview last summer that the mobile 
forces would consist of immediate reaction forces and rapid 
deployment forces. The former are supposed to react inside 24 
hours, while the latter are allowed three days to get their act 
together. 
  After the New Year, the organizational development of Mobile 
Forces started to pick up pace. To be completely absorbed by 
the Mobile Forces are the Airborne Troops and the Military 
Transport Aviation, whose main headquarters are located a 
stone's throw away from each other on Matrosskaya Tishina. 
Attached to the airborne troops were a number of more battle 
worthy units including the brigade from Teplyy Stan [a Moscow 
neighborhood] that was in the past belonged to the KGB. Being 
transferred from military districts are units and formations 
that are capable of getting ready to move within 24 hours. 
  The tasks of the new troops consist in carrying out 
subversion and peacemaking operations, providing cover for 
nuclear facilities, preventing the use of nuclear weapons, and 
even the carrying out of special operations to combat terrorism, 
organized crime, and nonconventional armed structures. 
  The importance of the Airborne Troops in the army has 
sharply 
increased. The Airborne Troops command actually is already now 
a high command. Yevgeniy Podkolzin was one of the few people 
invited to Boris Yeltsin's birthday party. No Airborne Troops 
subunit can be alerted without the president's personal 
directive. 
  Direct training of crews will begin in summer 1994. In fall 
1994, the first serious exercises of the new troops may be held. 
At any rate, all depends on the spring draft that will man the 
subunits. If there are no soldiers, there is no army.

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report under "Russia's Military Development </F>
Program" rubric: "The Russian Army Will Become Smaller but More 
Mobile"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Defense Ministry hopes as 
early as this year to resolve one of the main strategic tasks -- 
to reach understanding with the former USSR republics and, as 
far as possible, conclude with them bilateral agreements on 
creating Russian military bases on their territory. The total 
number of bases and Russian military servicemen will be 
specified. As for the other units and formations, in spite of 
the difficulties involved in redeploying and stationing troops, 
it is planned to begin their withdrawal this year. 
  It is deemed expedient to start transferring military 
districts to the territorial command and control principle: in 
other words, district commanders will become sole masters of the 
troops located on their territory regardless of their branch. 
This should enhance the effectiveness of troop command and 
control because commanders will have greater operational command 
powers in the event of aggression on the part of other states. 
In 1994 it is planned to complete theoretical work in this 
sphere (to be subsequently approved by the president) and as of 
next year, this plan will begin to be implemented starting with 
the Far East region. 
  By 1995 it is planned to complete the process of downsizing 
the armed forces. According to Pavel Grachev, "the ultimate 
limit" will be an army of 2 million men, which responds to the 
country's security interests and its economic capabilities. 
Given that after last fall's call-up (i.e., by January 1995) 
the Defense Ministry is hoping to man the army by 85 to 90 
percent, the real troop strength will approximate 1.8 million. 
  Owing to the need to have small but battleworthy and mobile 
units capable of promptly arriving at a conflict point in any 
part of the country, the Defense Ministry intends to finalize 
the elaboration of operational plans for a new type of 
operational-strategic formation -- the mobile forces. 
  Bodies responsible for contacts with personnel will also be 
reformed. In addition to the deputy commander in charge of 
indoctrination, a psychological, legal, and sociological service 
will be created in the troops. The Main Personnel Directorate 
will be reorganized as the Indoctrination Directorate.

  [Text] Vladivostok February 15 TASS -- Under conditions of 
a severe energy crisis the Administration of the Maritime Region 
decided to look into possibilities of the use of nuclear 
reactors installed on board submarines of the Russian Pacific 
Fleet for energy supplies to the regional centre. 
  A conference attended by representatives of the regional 
administration, the Pacific Fleet and Far Eastern scientific 
institutions was held in Vladivostok on Tuesday to discuss 
technical and economic aspects of this unusual project. 
  Experts believe that the high quality of domestic 
technologies and a guaranteed system of maintenance will ensure 
full radiation and ecological safety of the population. 
  Representatives of the fleet said that the energy potential 
of one submarine is enough to ensure energy supplies to no lees 
than 50 big apartment houses.

  [Text] Moscow 11 February TASS -- The U.S. and Russian 
ground mission control centers applauded today as the Discovery 
shuttle spacecraft carrying a U.S.-Russian crew on board 
successfully landed today at the Kennedy Space Center. 
  Charles Bolden, Ken Reightler, Franklin Chang-Diaz, Jan 
Davis, Ronald Sega and Sergey Krikalev spent slightly more than 
eight days in space and returned to the earth at 22:19 (Moscow 
time). The landing was postponed by almost two hours due to bad 
weather. 
  The crew conducted 35 scientific experiments in the sphere 
of 
material science, medicine and biology with the use of the 
spacehab laboratory and an installation for the production of 
super-clean thin films. The research was made to order of 
scientific and industrial organizations of the U.S. and Russia. 
  The flight is the first stage in the bilateral Mir-shuttle 
program, which will continue to the planned Alfa International 
orbiting station after several joint flights. 
  As for the immediate plans, a flight of Vladimir Titov 
(whose 
back-up is Sergey Krikalev) with a joint crew on board the U.S. 
shuttle is scheduled for January 1995. Titov is training at the 
Johnson Center (Houston, U.S.A.). Both U.S. astronauts, whose 
flight is scheduled for March 1, 1995, with the 18th main 
expedition of the Mir orbiting station have started training 
this week. 
  Bonnie Dunbar, the wife of U.S. astronaut Ronald Sega, and 
Norman Thagard are training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut training 
Center, the Moscow region.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov: "Krikalev's Debut on `Discovery' </F>
Was Successful, But the Satellite's Debut was Not"] 
  [Text] The landing of the "Discovery" space shuttle at the 
Canaveral space center at 2050 on 11 February marks the end of 
the first ever flight when U.S. astronauts and a Russian 
cosmonaut have been members of the same crew. Unfortunately, 
the attempts to place the "Wake Shield" satellite in orbit ended 
in failure. Sergey Krikalev was going to work with the 
satellite, which had been carried in the cargo bay. 
  The satellite was to have moved to a distance of 75 km from 
the space shuttle. At that distance, with no microgravitation 
at all and no effect from the station's exhaust gases, there 
would have been an experiment to grow extremely pure 
semiconductor films for new-generation computers. But the 
guidance system of the manipulator, which would have been used 
to move the satellite, turned out to be faulty. 
  This failure is very regrettable, since this faulty 
manipulator will be used to assemble the components of the 
"Alfa" international station when it is created. After many 
attempts the astronauts did manage to obtain seven laminated 
electronic components of reasonable quality in the satellite 
factory, but they were not as fine as had been expected. 
  According to the U.S. specialists, Sergey Krikalev performed 
very well, despite the relative failure of the main experiment. 
Any aberrations in the operation of the vehicle were instantly 
eliminated by our engineer. 
  In a year's time a second Russian cosmonaut -- Colonel 
Vladimir Titov -- will fly in the shuttle. During this flight 
the shuttle will approach our "Mir" station for the first time 
and Titov will perform a spacewalk. A docking between "Mir" and 
the shuttle is planned for spring 1995. Incidentally, this week 
U.S. astronauts Norman Thagard, 51, and Bonnie Dunbar, 45 (wife 
of astronaut Ronald Sega, who was on the "Discovery" flight), 
started training sessions at the Cosmonaut Training Center near 
Moscow. The long flight by a U.S. astronaut on the Russian 
"Mir" station is to begin on 1 March 1995.

<F P=106> [Joint interview with Eduard Shevardnadze and Armenian </F>
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan by unidentified correspondent in 
Tbilisi, given at the end of Ter-Petrosyan's one-day visit on 14 
February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Ter-Petrosyan] My visit had the following aim. 
Eduard Amvrosiyevich [Shevardnadze] and myself have a good 
tradition of meeting each other as often as possible. We take 
every opportunity to maintain a constant working spirit. We 
took this opportunity in Ashgabat before meeting each other here. 
  Naturally, we discussed practical problems relating to cargo 
deliveries, the progress of the implementation of trade and 
economic agreements, and we addressed regional problems, such as 
the settlement of the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and 
Abkhazia. We concluded that there is no alternative to a 
peaceful solution of these conflicts. To solve these conflicts, 
we should use the good offices of international organizations -- 
the CSCE and the United Nations, as well as Russia's special 
initiative. We reaffirmed the intention expressed at the 
meeting between Eduard Amvrosiyevich with Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin [on 3 February in Tbilisi] to organize a regional 
meeting that will bring together the leaders of Russia, Georgia, 
Armenia, and Azerbaijan. 
  These, in fact, are all the problems that we discussed 
today, 
during our private meeting and during the meeting between the 
delegations. 
  We reaffirmed our intention to organize a summit among 
Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. 
  [Shevardnadze] I confirm that there are internal needs that 
prompt us to meet. The current situation in our countries 
prompts us to meet more often and promote relations between the 
two neighboring states, which have a centuries-old tradition of 
friendship, cooperation, and fraternity. I think that every 
such meeting is another step toward the strengthening of our 
contacts and cooperation. This is what has happened just now. 
It seems to me that on all problems which are of interest and 
concern to our countries, we managed to work out a common 
approach and common principles. 
  The main thing is to achieve, as soon as possible, the 
completion of the conflict settlement process. Levon Akopovich 
and myself became convinced that, despite some individual 
peculiarities, there are common laws regarding conflict 
settlement. We are convinced that the leadership of Armenia, in 
particular, Levon Akopovich and his colleagues, can do something 
considerable to settle the conflict in Abkhazia. And, perhaps, 
we could also be useful regarding the settlement of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh issue. 
  An agreement in principle was reached today that we both 
deem 
useful the development of Caucasian dialogue, as we said. This 
problem was discussed at the meeting with Boris Nikolayevich 
Yeltsin. I am aware of the opinion of President of Azerbaijan 
Geydar Aliyevich Aliyev. It seems that we, the leaders of the 
four states, consider very important and useful to hold such a 
dialogue on a regular basis. In the beginning, it will probably 
be held at the summit level. But later, these contacts will 
include ministries, and there will be meetings between the prime 
ministers and foreign ministers. You were surprised why the 
security [sentence as received]. The security and interior 
ministers will also meet. If we cooperate as neighbors, 
everything will be possible. All issues should be settled. 
  Therefore, the main result of our meeting is perhaps the 
fact 
that we decided to work on this idea until it is implemented. 
  [Correspondent] What is the position of the CIS member 
states 
leaders regarding the decision to launch air strikes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] This is a difficult question. I think that 
now the world has to pay for its failure to react adequately in 
order to solve this problem. This is my point of view. 
  It is an extreme measure, the most unwelcome one out of 
everything that could have been chosen. I am still hoping that 
things will not go that far. There is still time. Perhaps, the 
international community will use all its efforts to avoid an air 
strike. 
  [Shevardnadze] I agree with what Levon Akopovich says. 
  I will say that, in principle, I am in favor of the 
implementation of decisions adopted by international 
organizations. However painful and difficult they may be, I am 
in favor of decisive measures, because any indecisiveness and 
uncertainty leads to even more serious consequences. This 
happened to us in Abkhazia, as it did in other conflicts. 
  Of course, there is some time, but not too much.

  [Text] Tbilisi, February 14 (SNARK) --"Such summits should 
become traditional. One should use every opportunity to create 
a permanent work tone in our cooperation, said today in Tbilisi 
the President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan. At a 
press-conference following immediately their private meeting 
with Eduard Shevardnadze, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who came here 
with a single-day visit, observed that practically all problems 
of mutual interest were concerned during the visit. Much 
attention has been given in particular to the regional problems, 
to situation in Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  "Together with Eduard Shevardnadze we came to a conclusion 
that there is no alternative to the peaceful settlement of such 
conflicts, declared Ter-Petrosyan. He also noted that it is 
highly undesirable if the Armenians living here would be 
involved in the ethnical conflict in Georgia. 
  Answering the SNARK's question, what is the position of 
Armenian President to the idea of a Caucasian 3+1 [Armenia, 
Azerbaijan and Georgia plus Russia] dialogue, proposed earlier 
by the Georgian head, Ter-Petrosyan told: "We have confirmed our 
intention to organize the meetings at high-level between 
Armenia, Turkey [as received] and Azerbaijan in presence of 
Russia. They must become traditional".

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgian Supreme Council chairman Eduard </F>
Shevardnadze by correspondent Nato Oniani in Tbilisi -- live] 
  [Text] [Oniani] Good morning, friends. We are presenting a 
radio interview with the chairman of the Georgian parliament and 
head of state, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze. Batono Eduard, the 
Abkhazian side again violated an agreement, the Geneva 
Memorandum last week. In addition, the work of the commission 
for drawing up the statute of Abkhazia, held in Moscow under UN 
auspices and with the participation of the CSCE, was virtually 
fruitless. Jointly with Yeltsin you have addressed Butrus 
Ghali, emphasizing that all chances of a peaceful settlement 
should be tried. 
  [Words indistinct] said on TV that any political decision is 
better than war. And if this does not produce a result, if the 
killing of the civilian population continues, what way will 
remain? 
  [Shevardnadze] Good morning. I would not say that the Moscow 
talks on a statute for Abkhazia were a complete failure. 
Generally, talks about the statute will be complex and [words 
indistinct]. The next stage should be in Geneva on the 22d and I 
think the issue will be clearer then. 
  As for the principal problem of the issue, I mean an overall 
settlement of the conflict, I believe there should be no doubt 
that we were right to have chosen a peaceful way toward a 
settlement from the very beginning in spite of the fact that it 
appeared to be ineffective. A peaceful way is the best and most 
reassuring way to settle conflicts in our time. Those who can 
analyze all that has been happening on our planet for the last 
20, 30, or 40 years will be convinced that a peaceful settlement 
is the most reliable way. 
  Both the Russian president and I were guided by this as we 
appealed to the UN Secretary General to have international 
peacekeeping forces in their classical form deployed or, if that 
were impossible, a Russian contingent would be a major force 
there. 
  Every opportunity should be used. I realize that many 
people feel upset when I keep speaking of a peaceful settlement 
to the conflict. I am not really surprised that this can upset 
someone whose house has been burned down and who does not know 
when he will be able to return home. He will naturally be 
looking for an extreme decision, which in his opinion could 
represent an earlier return home and the beginning of a normal 
life. But this is a superficial impression which is created by 
emotions and it cannot be fruitful. I would like to say the 
following. If we fail to bring in peacekeeping forces -- and 
this is the only way out and the shortest way to peace -- if we 
fail to bring in peacekeeping forces, (although I believe that 
this can be done as a result of consultations in New York and 
other capitals), if this fails and proves useless, everyone 
should remember that if this proves to be ineffectual, the worst 
thing will happen, there will be bloodshed. 
  I see this as a dreadful prospect. This will happen 
spontaneously irrespective of the will of the Georgian 
authorities or bodies of other countries. Processes will become 
uncontrollable and the conflict will spread over large areas, 
however grave it might be to think of this. Everyone should 
understand this. As I say this I mean our listeners, the 
listeners of our country, I mean the Abkhazian leaders who are 
in Gudauta and Sukhumi, and of course members of the UN Security 
Council and Russia in the first instance, because Russia has 
understood the reality of this danger of the spread of the 
conflict over large areas. Regardless of what we want, 
additional forces will be dragged into the conflict and this 
would be a disaster not only for Georgia but for this big region 
as a whole. 
  [Oniani] You say that Russia understood it partially and 
this was felt when several members of the Russian State Duma 
made a statement on television last night. Almost the same 
ideas were expressed. However, a politician differs from an 
ordinary mortal by the need to take unpopular decisions without 
being guided by emotions. At a parliament sitting you said that 
the Abkhazian issue could not be settled without Russia's 
participation. Your and Yeltsin's appeal says that if UN forces 
cannot be deployed in the conflict zone, Russia is ready for 
this. We are said to be asking Russia to do what Russia itself 
has taken an interest in. 
  [Shevardnadze] I would like to make the official Russian 
stance clear. Either international forces in their classical 
form arrive, and Russia agrees to the participation of the 
international forces and it will cooperate with the forces even 
by being a part of those, or it will make a commitment to bring 
in its contingent on a peace mission. There is no other way. 
If we speak of a peace settlement, there should be either 
international forces or a Russian contingent. 
  There is a third way, I mean another decision can be taken 
within the CIS but this will apparently be a repetition of a 
Tajik model. And this is obviously not quite desirable. It is 
difficult to argue against the righteousness of this stance. I 
mean the Russian statement that supports the introduction of 
international forces but, if that is not possible, Russia will 
undertake to bring in its contingent. It is really difficult to 
argue against this. We ourselves are primarily interested in 
what we are asking Russia to do. The idea that we are asking 
Russia to do what Russia is interested in can be reversed like 
this: We are asking Russia to do what we ourselves are 
interested in. No other way out can be seen. 
  [Oniani] One deputy has suggested that Russia close off the 
border and we shall fix Abkhazia. 
  [Shevardnadze] There is that idea. But this request is 
rather naive and I think the main point is what I have just said. 
  [Oniani] I would like to remind you of your words said at 
the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers. The whole country 
should turn toward the economy. A morbid politization of our 
community is a deviation from the proper coursel. 
  An anticrisis government program was made public last week. 
How effective do you think this program will be and how likely 
do you think the government crisis or even resignation is in the 
near future in the light of numerous complaints against the 
government and an idea that our government is not a unified 
team? 
  [Shevardnadze] The presented program is a maximum of current 
abilities. All existing forces participated in the work; I mean 
ministries, agencies, institutes, individual experts, and so on. 
The work took months. I also joined at the final stage and I 
was also involved, in a way. The principal thing is that the 
country should really turn toward the economy and everyone 
should care about the economy and think and care about escaping 
from the crisis. 
  The presented program is realistic. I said in a speech that 
an optimistic scenario was mentioned as well as a pessimistic 
scenario. I can say that the maximal version is a realistic 
one. But it can be realistic only if we are able to find 
additional resources to overcome the energy crisis. 
  Armenia receives several-fold less power and fuel and they 
run 70 percent of their industry. The population experiences 
extreme hardships there but they all realize that if the economy 
stopped the country would lose all prospects for the future. 
  I do not mean that we can still take something away from the 
population but we obviously have to look for additional 
resources, additional sources of fuel and power. This could be 
received either through foreign credits or other ways, such as 
through relations with Russia or with Iran and a lot of other 
ways. 
  As for an idea that there is not a unified team, I am not 
aware of anyone in Georgia who is capable of summoning his 
people and creating a united team. I think these ideas create a 
very primitive image of a team. A team cannot be created just 
like that. In order to create a team, like-minded people, 
people who understand each other easily are needed and, in 
addition, a very high professional level should be guaranteed 
and this takes years. It needs years of experience and 
sometimes decades. 
  Thus, we cannot demand that the present authorities do 
something that is very difficult and almost impossible to do. 
We have not got an ideal and strong team like this at the 
moment but, anyway, the present Cabinet of Ministers is the most 
we could afford in a difficult situation like this. 
  As for a government crisis, there will probably be certain 
complications during the endorsement of the members of the 
government by the parliament. I would like to ask everyone to 
refrain from extreme demands. A government crisis will make the 
desperate situation in the economy even more complicated and 
difficult. Those who put forward revolutionary slogans 
demanding, in particular, that the Cabinet of Ministers be 
replaced, certain statesmen resign and so on are driving the 
country to a deeper crisis. It is impossible that a person 
learn how to be a minister in just three or four months. This 
should be realized. 
  When we were changing the previous Cabinet, I was against it 
because one needs at least one or two years to have an idea 
about one's department. That is why we have to take care of the 
people and we have to be more kind to individual statesmen and 
even to the Cabinet. Today, we have to be guided by a common 
responsibility rather than by a desire to amuse ourselves. 
Unfortunately, the latter is often observed in one part of the 
community and especially in the parliament. 
  [Oniani] I would like to recall yet another point from your 
speech at the Cabinet of Ministers. You said: We have to 
introduce private ownership as soon as possible. There are 
people in the government, including the staff of the head of 
state, who hamper the activities of entrepreneurs. 
  Incidentally, the mafia is not happy because of the 
development of entrepreneurship in Georgia, either. They have a 
significant network and not only in our republic, unfortunately. 
  [Shevardnadze] Speaking of the country's development in the 
long run, of course proprietors, businessmen, industrialists 
should be considered as major components of the society required 
for the expansion of the economy. We have to do our best to 
switch to the market economy as soon as possible. I agree with 
you that this idea scares certain structures and it scares the 
mafia, too, because a proprietor has a well-developed sense of 
responsibility and aspiration to protect his own property, which 
is the basis of his personal happiness. 
  Despite the opposition, this process must be sped up and it 
will be sped up. Apart from that, our population has to realize 
that something should be done so that a proprietor, an 
entrepreneur will not become a leech. An antagonistic attitude 
to leeches can be observed in people at the initial stage. We 
have to support and help the establishment of serious business 
and the preparation of a whole school of businessmen, the 
businessmen who will come forward thanks to their intelligence, 
cleverness, and hard work rather than dishonest ways. The 
earlier we manage to establish businesslike ties and have such 
proprietors on the scene, the sooner the country will find a way 
to improve the situation. 
  [Oniani] You accepted the defense minister's resignation 
last week and temporarily assumed the duties of minister. I 
would like to recall your words at the meeting with the army 
high command. I have been quoting you very often today but this 
is due to necessity. The state has to provide for the army. The 
army cannot exist on charity or depend on someone's mood. The 
army cannot be built on sand. You also spoke about building a 
modern Georgian Army. On what is your optimism based? Is there 
a basis in Georgia to allow the building of a new army? 
  [Shevardnadze] When I speak about a new army I do not mean 
that those who are in the armed forces now have to quit and new 
people have to come in. When speaking with a certain optimism 
that we will soon have a truly modern national army, I mean the 
cadres who comprise the basis of our army now and who already 
have combat experience. Many of those are model heroes and 
brave fighters fully devoted to the interests of the country. 
We were defeated but this loss is also a certain experience 
which this generation has acquired. This is obviously one of 
the bases for my optimism. The main thing is that we have 
cadres. 
  Second, there are people, I mean in our community, who 
realize the importance of the army and its purpose for the 
building of an independent state. I believe that youth will say 
a decisive word in the building of the army. I will do my best 
to make military service the highest duty, an honorable mission, 
and even a kind of privilege for the best of our youths. 
  My direct and active involvement in this process is due to 
my 
desire to use all my power and rights and have the army built on 
a legal basis and financed through legal sources. And this 
should improve two- and three-fold the conditions of the 
servicemen rather than aggravate them. I did not use the word 
privilege accidentally. Speaking of the army I also mean border 
guards, interior troops, and all [word indistinct]. 
  [Oniani] And a final question. An Armenian delegation led 
by President Levon Ter-Petrosyan is arriving in Georgia today. 
What is the chief purpose of this visit and is it not linked 
with an idea you expressed during President Yeltsin's visit to 
Tbilisi, namely, that it is necessary that leaders of the three 
large Transcaucasian states meet regularly to handle conflicts 
in the area. Plus Russia. 
  [Shevardnadze] We agreed to meet before. The Armenian 
president was in London and he asked me to arrange this meeting 
as soon as he returned. I spoke to Mr. Aliyev as well as Mr. 
Ter-Petrosyan about the necessity of such meetings. All three 
of us share a view that the meetings; regular, systematic 
meetings are essential. These may start on a bilateral basis 
and then later all three of us will probably meet. Then Russia 
as well as other countries will be able to join us. 
  Obviously, a major topic will be a Caucasian dialogue and 
how 
promising, how reassuring, and realistic the beginning of a 
Caucasian dialogue will be. Speaking of dialogue, I do not mean 
an ordinary conversation. I mean a certain (?quorum) which will 
be regulated chronologically; in other words we will meet two or 
three times a year and discuss problems. 
  In addition, bilateral relations could predominate today, 
problems that concern the two countries. We will have a serious 
conversation. We have many interests in Armenia, and the 
Armenians strongly depend on how well the Georgian 
communications network works. 
  I would like to add that Mr. Aliyev will not be involved in 
our present dialogue personally but I have had preliminary talks 
with him and after my meeting with the Armenian president has 
ended, my meeting with the Azernaijani president will take 
place. I think we are approaching the phase when our contacts 
are to become more vigorous and we have to do our best so that 
the Caucasian factor will play its decisive role in fighting for 
peace and stability in the region.

  [Text] Up to the present date, three out of 14 generating 
sets at Ukraine's nuclear electric stations have found 
themselves on the verge of a stoppage due to the insufficient 
amount of nuclear fuel available. In the words of Nur 
Nihmatulin, the first deputy chairman of the State Committee for 
the Use of Nuclear Power [DerzhKomAtom], problems with the 
supply of nuclear fuel from Russia have to do with the lack of 
funds to pay for energy carriers. In order to provide Ukraine's 
nuclear electric power station's with fuel and spare parts for 
this year, 350 billion rubles are needed. So far, DerzhKomAtom 
has no such a sum. The leadership of the committee sees the 
settlement of this issue in putting into practice the trilateral 
agreement signed in Moscow.

  [Text] As of today, three of the 14 generating units in 
Ukrainian nuclear power plants are on the verge of being shut 
down due to the lack of nuclear fuel. The radio agency NOVYNY 
asked [name indistinct], first deputy head of the State 
Committee for Nuclear Power, to comment. According to him, the 
problems with nuclear fuel supplies from Russia are due to the 
lack of funds for energy resources. To secure this year's 
supplies of fuel and spare parts for Ukrainian nuclear power 
plants, Ukraine needs 350 billion rubles. At present, the State 
Committee for Nuclear Power does not possess such a sum. The 
Committee leadership believes that this problem could be 
resolved when the trilateral agreement signed in Moscow is 
implemented.

  [Text] As we have already reported, Yevgeniy Saburov, 
former Russian minister of the economy, has been offered the 
post of prime minister of the Crimean Government. At the 
moment, Saburov is a director of the Center for Information and 
Social Technology under the Russian Government, and intends to 
remain in this post. Our correspondent Irina Akhiyeva got in 
touch with Saburov on the telephone and asked him to say to whom 
-- the Ukraine or Russia -- will Crimea chiefly direct its 
economic policy? 
  [Begin recording] [Saburov] Crimea will direct it in such a 
way as will be best for the Crimean population from an economic 
standpoint. 
  There is no question of a secession or a withdrawal from 
Ukraine. It is a question of using Crimea's economic potential 
to the utmost and to improve the well-being of the people living 
there. Naturally, all these actions of Crimea's will be 
directed, as they always have been, toward all the republics of 
the CIS -- people from the Baltics have come to us and have been 
pleased, and if any other countries come to us, then that will 
be even better. 
  [Akhiyeva] But Crimea will require a great deal of money for 
this. 
  [Saburov] Of course. That is why it will welcome any 
investments, wherever they may come from. 
  [Akhiyeva] You submitted your economic program to the 
government. Will you try and implement this program in Crimea? 
  [Saburov] Crimea is not a separate country and it does not 
have its own monetary system. Therefore, the opportunities to 
work in this direction are extremely limited in Crimea. As far 
as the Russian program -- of which I am the author -- is 
concerned, it is directed toward an instant halt in inflation. 
It is being examined at the moment in a pretty serious way; it 
has, in my view, very great purpose. Indeed, it is my firm 
conviction that there is no other way for us, and we will have 
to do this in any case, and the sooner the better. This is an 
unpopular belief. 
  [Akhiyeva] What do you mean by an instant halt in inflation? 
Today, straightaway? 
  [Saburov] Yes. 
  [Akhiyeva] Let us put it this way: I am an ordinary citizen, 
how will it affect me? 
  [Saburov] The standard of living will fall, in the first 
instance. Incomes (?will rise). Then there will be no 
inflation and life will be normal. It is not very pleasant, but 
there is no other way to go. Otherwise, we will just have 
disastrous unemployment. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by G. Potapenko: "Yu. Meshkov: `We Have Inherited </F>
a Mountain of Problems'"] 
  [Text] The first news conference by Yuriy Meshkov, the 
first Crimean president, was held in the session hall of the 
Supreme Soviet on 31 January and was attended by Crimean and 
foreign journalists. 
  Yuriy Meshkov began his news conference with a brief appeal 
to Crimean citizens thanking them for voting, saying: "At a 
time when society is in material and spiritual poverty, we have 
to deal with a mountain of inherited problems -- a collapsed 
economy, incompetent authorities, and a sharp increase in crime. 
A tremendously creative job is in front of us. Without your 
support, we will be unable to retain power. I am ready to 
cooperate with all political leaders of the Crimea, with 
representatives of all nationalities, and with every one who 
values peace and prosperity in the Crimea. The election results 
showed that the people of the Crimea are a single nation. The 
Crimea can and should become a bridge of friendship and 
cooperation between Ukraine and Russia." 
  One of the main questions at the conference was how the 
president plans to build this bridge. 
  "We will restore the destroyed relations with Russia and 
pursue normal economic cooperation with Ukraine." 
  Speaking on interethnic relations in the Crimea, he said: 
"The situation in the Crimea and hotspots of the former Soviet 
Union continue to be compared with a persistence that I do not 
understand, though they have nothing in common.... First of 
all, we have no such preconditions in the Crimea. We have 
nothing that could make us fear such developments. Such views 
are not supported within the Crimea. If the Ukrainian economy 
does not collapse and we are able to rescue ourselves, 
everything will be okay. At the same time, our stance on the 
Black Sea Fleet remains the same -- a single Black Sea Fleet, 
owned by Russia, is the key factor of stability in the Crimea." 
  Yuriy Meshkov stressed that his election victory does not 
mean that a period of mass purges will follow. He said that it 
would be irrational not to use the experience of the old guard. 
Of course, people who have compromised themselves and broken 
the law will have to leave their posts. 
  Speaking about relations with the Crimean Mejlis, Yu. 
Meshkov 
said: "You should not think that all Tatars in the Crimea 
represent a single monolithic movement. The Tatar movement 
contains several movements and trends. We are in close contact 
with some of them and coordinate our actions with their 
representatives. I know that many Crimean Tatars voted for us. 
That is enough to ensure peace and stability in the Crimea. A 
key task of our policy is to ensure the implementation of our 
citizens' rights. We admit that the human rights of the 
deported peoples were violated. The state must compensate them 
for their moral and material losses. The Republic of the Crimea 
must draw up a legal basis for the state's obligations toward 
the people whose rights were violated. It is quite another 
matter that our poor budget will not let us provide compensation 
for those losses. However, we are conducting talks with Russia, 
Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and other republics on this issue. I hope 
that the state will settle accounts with its citizens." 
  Yu. Meshkov emphasized that the political rights of the 
Crimean Tatars will be assured in accordance with their 
requirements, the demands of human rights, and international 
agreements.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Kiev Ukrayinske Radio First Program in 
Ukrainian at 1305 GMT on 14 February carries the live call-in 
program "Independence" attended by Supreme Council Chairman Ivan 
Plyushch. The program is moderated by Vadym Zadorozhnyy. 
  At the beginning of the program, Plyushch is asked who is to 
blame for the current economic crisis in Ukraine. Plyushch 
responds that the reason for the economic plight of Ukraine, as 
well as other republics of the former Soviet Union, is the 
irrational structure of the production sector: In Ukraine, 
about 70 percent of the labor force is employed in the 
production of the means of production, while only 30 percent is 
involved in consumer production. During 70 years of Soviet 
rule, he continues, Ukraine was a supplier of coal from Donbass 
and iron from Krivbass for Warsaw Pact countries, while now 
Ukraine "has been left alone" not only with the problems of 
Donbass and Krivbass, but also with the consequences of the 
Chernobyl disaster and a large military-industrial complex. 
Plyushch states that these three factors account for over 
one-third of Ukraine's budget expenditures. However, he 
emphasizes that these expenditures must be made because there 
are 1.2 million miners employed in Donbass and "hundreds of 
thousands" of workers in Krivbass. As for the 
military-industrial complex, the Supreme Council chairman says: 
"We do not need such a big Army. However, what are we to do 
with those people tomorrow? We started with an Army of 1 
million men, now we have reduced that number to 500,000. As a 
result, budget allocations to pensioned soldiers are much bigger 
than those for regular servicemen." 
  Asked to name specific measures for overcoming the country's 
economic crisis, Plyushch states that the Ukrainian people 
should cardinally change production relations and implement 
reforms so as to "make a worker master of his own labor." 
  Commenting on the activity of the Supreme Council, Plyushch 
states that the Ukrainian parliament has done a lot to build up 
Ukrainian statehood, but contributed little to the 
implementation of economic reform. 
  Asking a question concerning a possible split of the Crimea 
from Ukraine following the recent presidential elections on the 
peninsula, Plyushch states that Ukraine's territorial integrity 
is assured by "all our documents," and Ukraine "will never back 
down" in this regard. The Supreme Council chairman goes on to 
emphasize that there are no countries which would encroach upon 
Ukraine's territorial integrity. He reminds listeners that the 
Moscow trilateral declaration by Presidents Clinton, Yeltsin, 
and Kravchuk provides for noninterference in internal matters 
and asserts that all the sides will cooperate in securing the 
territorial integrity of their countries. 
  Commenting on the remark that the Ukrainian parliament has 
done little to support the use of the Ukrainian language on all 
levels of state life, Plyushch says that the process of 
introducing the Ukrainian language require a great amount of 
time and money. As of today, Plyushch claims, Ukraine is not 
able to publish a sufficient amount of Ukrainian textbooks and 
train a sufficient number of teachers of Ukrainian language. 
  Asked to explain the "associated membership" of Ukraine in 
the CIS economic union and cite concrete results of Ukraine's 
participation in this union, Plyushch states that these 
questions should be addressed to the government. He also says: 
"We have already concluded over 400 various agreements within 
the CIS framework, but none of them is working. Is there any 
need for such a union?" He states that cooperation between CIS 
countries is necessary, but it should be accomplished on the 
level of "permanent commissions and committees." Cooperation on 
the level of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly is assessed by 
him as "pulling one another's leg." 
  At the end of the program, Supreme Council Chairman Plyushch 
is asked to comment on the balance between legislative and 
executive power in Ukraine. He states that Ukraine had been 
living too long under unified authoritarian rule, both in 
czarist and Soviet times. Therefore, he adds, Ukraine needs a 
redistribution of power between the legislative, executive, and 
judicial branches. He admits that the distribution of power 
between legislative and executive bodies has not been 
accomplished "very well."

  [Text] In Kiev the police arrested 35 members of the 
Ukrainian Self-Defense Organization (USDO) on charges of 
belonging to paramilitary units. This was announced on Sunday 
in Lvov by the chairman of the local branch of the Ukrainian 
National Assembly (UNA), Andrey Shkil. 
  The Ukrainian National Assembly is an ultra-nationalist 
organization formed in 1990. USDO paramilitary units were 
formed under UNA auspices in early 1992. The same year its 
members joined military actions in Moldova on the side of the 
self-proclaimed Republic of Trans-Dniester on the pretext of 
protecting ethnic Ukrainians in the area. In early 1993 about 
100 USDO fighters joined hostilities between Georgians and 
Abkhazians on the side of Georgians. 
  Addressing the 2nd regional conference convened by the UNA 
and USDO, Shkil said that the arrests in Kiev had been followed 
by searches at his organization's headquarters and at the flats 
of 3 USDO activists. The police confiscated various documents, 
identity cards of candidates for parliamentary elections, and 
registration lists. 
  With reference to the arrests Andrey Shkil declared, "This 
was the first day of reprisals against the UNA. We are 
beginning to inspire fear, because we have become a powerful 
force." The UNA/USDO was prepared for such confrontation when 
it was taking its decision to join the election campaign, he 
said. 
  "We'll come to power anyway, even if all our members are 
arrested," he declared. 
  The press center of Ukraine's Security Service told 
Interfax-Ukraina that the Service is aware of the measures the 
police took recently toward the UNA/USDO. "But this is a police 
matter," spokesmen for the Service stressed. 
  USDO's commander in chief, Yuriy Shukhevich, told 
journalists: "We are ready to fight anywhere -- in the Crimea, 
in the Donetsk coal mining area, in Moscow, in St.Petersburg -- 
wherever a war is on." 
  The UNA/USDO conference demanded that its members be freed, 
and declared that it views their arrest as the beginning of 
repression on the eve of elections. 
  Shkil also said: "We shall not issue declarations concerning 
developments in the Crimea. We are men of action: the Crimea 
will be either Ukrainian, or depopulated." 
  On Sunday the UNA\USDO leadership published data on their 
membership: there are 510 UNA/USDO members in Lvov Region. 
Besides, there are 388 USDO "fighters" and 286 candidates for 
"fighters" in Lvov Region. 865 men are viewed as reservists. 
400 more members of the organization are known to live in 
Ternopol, Povno and Western Ukraine.

  [Text] Riga, February 14 (LETA) -- Anatolijs Gorbunovs, 
chairman of the Saeima or parliament of Latvia, on Friday [11 
February] met with German Ambassador to Latvia, Reinhard 
Holubek, on his first visit to the speaker of the Latvian 
legislature. According to the Saeima press service, during the 
meeting Anatolijs Gorbunovs pointed out that the two countries 
in recent years had succeeded in forging close cooperation in 
political and economic matters. He praised the role of the 
German embassy, as well as that of the support group for Latvia 
set up in German Bundestag, in stepping up the process. 
  The ambassador on his part stressed that Latvia was a part 
of 
Europe and the process of its integration into European 
structures had to be continued. He said Latvian politicians had 
yet to face two major problems, notably, withdrawal of Russian 
troops and passing the law on citizenship. 
  Anatolijs Gorbunovs stated that Latvia should push forward 
with its efforts to reach a concrete agreement on Russian troops 
pull-out, which would include conditions set by Latvian 
negotiators. The chairman of the Saeima also said he considered 
it an urgent necessity to find the best formula for solving the 
citizenship controversy, which would be acceptable for the 
majority of people of this country. Asked to comment on the 
recent remarks on the Latvian draft law on citizenship voiced by 
the high commissioner with the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, Max Van der Stoel, Anatolijs Gorbunovs 
noted that he personally still did not see arguments which would 
ease anxiety about the future fate of their nation, felt by 
majority of the Latvians. 
  Asked about his opinion on another controversy of the day, 
namely, of including non-citizens into electorate eligible to 
participate in the local elections, scheduled to be held in late 
May, the speaker of the Saeima pointed out that the decision 
which provided a vote for Latvian citizens only, proved to be 
the right one at the last summer's parliamentary elections. He 
added that the decision had ensured legitimacy of the sitting 
legislature, as well as had endorsed it with rights to solve any 
problem of national interest. 
  Latvia is threading the right path in resolving its 
political 
problems, the newly appointed German Ambassador to Latvia 
Reinhard Holubek told reporters after his meeting with the 
Chairman of the Saeima Anatolijs Gorbunovs. 
  The ambassador said he was certain this year was going to be 
of great importance for Latvia, marked with significant events 
both in adopting key legislations and in settling relations with 
its neighbours, notably with Russia. 
  Holubek pledged his country would spare no efforts to seek 
closer ties to be forged between Latvia and the European 
Community.

  [Text] The talks between Latvia and Russia on the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia were resumed this 
afternoon at the House of Science at Lielupe. 
  As the press center of the Cabinet of Ministers informs, the 
talks will focus on a general agreement on the withdrawal of 
troops, the conditions for the future operation and dismantling 
of the Skrunda radar station, the problems of social security of 
Russian military personnel, and questions connected with the 
activity of representatives of both states in the vicinity of 
the border between Latvia and Russia. 
  Based on the political will of Latvia and Russia and on the 
work accomplished during the previous talks, all the agreements 
included in the agreement package on the withdrawal of the 
Russian troops could be coordinated during this round of talks. 
This was predicted today at the airport by Sergey Zotov, head 
of the Russian delegation, upon his arrival in Riga. Zotov 
added that there were grounds for hope also for a ratification 
of these documents at the Russian parliament. These agreements 
were being drawn up and concluded taking into account the 
interests of both Latvia and Russia. 
  It is anticipated that at tomorrow's sitting of the Cabinet 
of Ministers, the Latvian delegation will be given the authority 
to agree with the last proposal recommended by Russia of 
maintaining the operation of the Skrunda radar station for four 
years, and after that, dismantling it in the course of 18 months. 
  The talks will continue until 16 February.

<F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "LNNK Faction Announces Crisis in </F>
Parliament and Government"] 
  [Text] Riga, 2 Feb -- The Movement for Latvia's National 
Independence [LNNK] faction in the Saeima [parliament] is of the 
opinion that due to the ill-considered actions of the 
government, there is a crisis in the Saeima, as well as the 
government, the LNNK deputies announced at a press conference 
today. The deputies stated at the conference that the 
opposition is going to establish a "shadow cabinet." However, 
they still have to wait for the right moment -- among other 
reasons, because of lack of resources. The LNNK deputies said 
that the government itself could solve the situation by 
seriously reconsidering its actions. 
  The LNNK faction has also disseminated a statement, in which 
it asks all inhabitants of Latvia to express their views on the 
actions of the Latvia's Way and Farmers Union coalition, as well 
as those of the government that was established by this 
coalition. The LNNK also urged representatives of all Saeima 
factions to respect the interests of the Latvian nation, instead 
of supporting "various interest groups." 
  As Maris Budovskis stated at the conference, the reason for 
the government crisis is the great haste with which the 
government strives to take over all possible power. As an 
example, M. Budovskis pointed to the cabinet's 28 December 1993 
decision to put the Radio and Television Council under the 
control of the Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture. In 
his opinion, this is a dangerous precedent which shows their 
desire to control the mass media. According to M. Budovskis, 
the Parliamentary Commission of State Administration and 
Municipality has informed the government that several 
parliamentary commissions have protested against this 
subordination of the Radio and Television Council. He also 
recalled the unfortunate laws passed by the cabinet, under 
Article 81 of the Constitution during parliamentary recesses, 
and expressed doubt as to their legality and the need for such 
haste in passing them. 
  M. Budovskis stressed that many of the government laws were 
passed in contradiction to Article 81, because they introduced 
changes in laws that had already been passed by the existing 
Saeima. Moreover, several of these laws had been drafted and 
submitted at the time to the Saeima and were awaiting 
discussion. By adopting those laws, the government has shown a 
lack of trust in the Saeima's competence and has reduced the 
powers of the municipalities. M. Budovskis also stated that the 
ill-considered behavior of the cabinet apparently has created 
conflict in the Latvia's Way faction, because certain voting 
results bear evident signs of a breakdown in faction discipline. 
At the same time, Aristids Lambergs predicted that in the very 
near future the ruling coalition would find itself in danger of 
splitting, and that it should think of attracting partners from 
other factions. LNNK Deputy Anna Seile expressed the opinion 
that currently "the government dictates the rules to the 
governing coalition," while the coalition should be the one to 
regulate the activities of the government that was created by it.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, February 15 (TASS) -- It is a year today 
since Algirdas Brazauskas was elected president of Lithuania. 
In the country's first universal democratic elections 60.03 
percent of voters cast their ballots in his favour. 
  Responding to a question from the country's most popular 
daily LIETUVOS RITAS about what successes the president feels 
proud of, Brazauskas said that when he won the elections, news 
was circulated all over the world that Lithuania was again ruled 
by communists. 
  "Since that time Europe, and not Europe alone, has come to 
realize that all power institutions in the republic were elected 
democratically, that reforms continue and that Lithuania is 
pursuing a predictable foreign policy. No one in Europe can say 
that some uncertain types were in power. It was an important 
task for as to change the image of Lithuania in the eyes of the 
world community", Brazauskas said. 
  "The adoption of Lithuania in the Council of Europe confirms 
the fact that our country has won international recognition. We 
see good relations which have been formed lately with the 
European Union, NATO and other international organizations as 
our great achievement," the Lithuanian president said. 
  "In the field of foreign policy we managed to avoid major 
conflicts through planning, and the Russian Army was withdrawn 
on time," Brazauskas said. 
  He also said that his successes as president also included 
better relations among people. "Suspiciousness is vanishing and 
there is no more search for internal enemies," Brazauskas 
stressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vytautas Landsbergis, chairman of the </F>
Fatherland Union Party and leader of the Lithuanian Seimas 
opposition, by an unidentified correspondent in Vilnius on 14 
February--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Last week, Russian news agencies 
quoted the annual report on the situation in the country made by 
President Algirdas Brazauskas saying, incidentally, that 
President Brazauskas emphasized the improvement in relations 
between Russia and Lithuania in 1993. 
  Esteemed Professor, you have expressed concern about the 
relations between the big neighbor and Lithuania at today's news 
conference. 
  [Landsbergis] It is evident, and what is evident is not open 
to question--that Russia's official policy toward its neighbors, 
including the Baltic states, is hostile. This is expressed by 
threats, pressure, by constant demands and reproaches, and even 
by accusations. The Baltic states cannot feel secure at a time 
when such official military and foreign policy doctrines as 
those recently proclaimed by Russia claim that Russia allegedly 
has the right to interfere into our affairs using force. In 
general, the whole policy concerning the encirclement of Russia 
has been fabricated, which is labelled "the near abroad". 
  This would mean the surrounding world (?according to) the 
Russian politicians is divided into two categories. Some 
foreign countries appear to be just normal, regular, foreign 
sovereign countries, and others are especially subject to 
influence and even domination by Russia. 
  This fact makes not only the Baltic states, but also the 
states of Central Europe, to look for support in the structures 
of European stability and security that have proved their worth. 
  In response to this, Russia once again accuses these 
countries, including the Baltic states, of anti-Russian or 
anti-Russia policies. This is a specific aggravation of the 
political and psychological atmosphere that is coming from 
Moscow. Therefore, it is rather difficult to give an assessment 
of this entire unfolding process, including the growing 
pro-imperialist and aggressive forces in Russia. It is 
difficult to regard all this as an improvement of the situation 
in general. 
  Of course, the former and current governments of Lithuania 
have been trying to maintain good relations with Russia; 
however, this cannot be said about the Russian side. Perhaps 
what Russia regards as good relations is not partnership based 
on equal rights but something else altogether. 
  [Correspondent] As is known, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev has been stressing of late that a program has been 
prepared in Russia that will defend the interests of the ethnic 
Russians living outside the territory of Russia, i.e. in the 
near abroad. He also stressed the problem of anti-Semitism 
especially in the Baltic states. [passage omitted] 
  Brazauskas said that the pressing problems raised at the 
Vienna summit were also topical to Lithuania. These problems 
were: Aggressive nationalism, a problem of racism, and Zionism. 
  [Landsbergis] This is propaganda and diplomatic murk that is 
sometimes used in the campaign for international public opinion, 
and which has been known to us for several years already. We 
encountered it when attempts were made to harm Lithuania, and 
this was coming from Moscow. Quite often, Lithuania and other 
Baltic states were represented as anti-Semitic, nationalistic, 
anti- Russian, and what not. 
  Of course, one of their objectives was to make influential 
financial circles in the West become hostile, which would then 
refuse to help or would refrain from cooperation with the Baltic 
states--in particular, with Lithuania. [passage omitted] 
  It seems that this card is being used again, since Mr. 
Kozyrev is accusing anyone and whoever he likes of 
anti-Semitism. No doubt, at the same time, he fails to mention 
Russia, where very strong anti-Semitic organizations and groups 
are active that create an atmosphere of threat or even terror 
against Jews. [passage omitted] 
  The fact that the mention of Zionism as a topical problem in 
Lithuania occurred in the annual report of President Brazauskas 
is completely incomprehensible to me. This is such an old card 
of the Brezhnev era, which was used to pacify perhaps the Arab 
partners. However, to claim that this is a topical issue in 
Lithuania today is simply nonsense. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 436] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 14, ELTA -- Russian military transit 
through Lithuania, legalized by the agreement, equals to the 
presence of Russian military forces in the Lithuanian territory, 
the opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis told a news 
conference. 
  In case of such agreement an ex-territorial corridor would 
be 
created and a number of rights and guarantees ensured for 
Russia, Landsbergis noted. 
  He emphasized that lately the political and economic crisis 
had been aggravated in Kaliningrad enclave. Thus, deep 
concentration of Russian military forces there represents danger 
for Lithuania. 
  Landsbergis noted that the former Lithuanian government 
constantly raised questions on the demilitarization of 
Kaliningrad enclave. President Brazauskas raised this question 
at the United Nations as well. It would be paradoxical that 
Lithuania would add to the militarization of the enclave now, 
which would become a fact if Lithuania signed the agreement on 
the military transit. 
  Landsbergis reproached the Lithuanian Government that it did 
not express its protest against Russia ignoring the Helsinki 
agreements signed in 1992. The agreements say that a foreign 
army can not be present in the territory of any state which does 
not give its agreement on it. 
  Landsbergis thinks that the best way out would be to divert 
Russian military transit through territories of other states, 
like it happens now with the passanger trains. Any other 
agreements represent danger for Lithuania despite the presence 
of any international monitors which will be invited to Lithuania.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 14, BNS -- Lithuanian border guards 
detained three Russian officers Sunday [13 February] night as 
they attempted to illegally enter Lithuanian territory. 
  The trespassers were caught on a bridge across the Nemunas 
river in the western Lithuanian town of Pagegiai and were sent 
back to the Kaliningrad region. 
  Seventeen Russian re-enlistees were taken off the St. 
Petersburg- Kaliningrad train at the Turmantas border crossing 
in eastern Lithuania. The Russians, who headed for the 
Kaliningrad region without permission of Lithuanian authorities, 
were returned to the territory of Belarus. 
  The weekend "catch" of Lithuanian border guards also 
included 
a drug smuggler. Pranas Dragunaitis, head of the Lithuanian 
Border Defense Service Headquarters, said a man who attempted to 
smuggle drugs in his train compartment was detained on the 
Lvov-St. Petersburg train Sunday.

  [Text] The Belarusian free trade unions began an indefinite 
political strike in Minsk on Tuesday [15 February]. The goal of 
this action is to force the parliament and government to resign. 
  About 2,000 people gathered in Independence Square in front 
of the government building. Approaches to the government 
offices have been blocked by the police. 
  INTERFAX correspondents have not noticed any military 
equipment in the streets adjacent to the square. 
  A police officer in charge of ensuring the security of the 
place, who preferred to remain anonymous, told INTERFAX that the 
law-enforcement bodies had to put up with volitions [as 
received] of the Independence Square's status, according to 
which no mass actions can be held in it except celebrations of 
the official national holidays. He also said that the police 
did not disperse so as not to fan tensions. [sentence as 
received] 
  Belarusian Parliament Speaker Mechyslav Hryb told INTERFAX 
that the current political situation was complicated. He also 
said that his attitude to the strike was negative. All 
political problems must be tackled without pressure or violence, 
and at the negotiating table, he said. 
  Hryb believes that the idea of holding the strike was 
initiated by the Belarusian strike committee and the opposition 
Belarusian Popular Front, not by the workers. "These 
organizations pursue their own goals which have nothing to do 
with the interests of ordinary workers," he said. 
  He noted that the political strike may delay the conclusion 
of the monetary agreement with Russia. 
  He also pointed out that in the current situation the law 
enforcement bodies will act strictly within the limits of the 
law, and that all illegal actions will be curbed. 
  Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich told INTERFAX 
that the strike committee was manipulating the current economic 
problems to destabilize the economy. 
  To quote Kebich, the strike leaders' assertions that many 
industrial enterprises had stopped work at their call were 
ungrounded. Many factories stopped working for economic 
reasons, long before the strike was announced, he said. 
  Neither the strike committee, nor the Belarusian Government 
could tell INTERFAX how many people had gone on strike.

  [Text] On 15 February, a meeting was held at 1100 local 
time [1000 GMT] at the Independence Square in Minsk, attended by 
7,000-8,000 people. Representatives of the Belarusian Popular 
Front [BNF] and the Belarusian Strike Committee Council spoke to 
the participants. BNF Chairman Zyanon Paznyak appealed to the 
workers to continue the strike, which in his opinion is the only 
way to achieve early legislative elections and bring about the 
government's resignation. Syarhey Antonchyk, Strike Committee 
Council deputy chairman, pointed out that pressure was exerted 
on the organizers of the strike. Many enterprises, including 
the Minsk motor vehicle plant, announced 15 February a day off. 
The participants in the meeting demanded that the government 
led by Vyacheslav Kebich be dissolved by 22 February, and new 
elections to the Supreme Council be called. After the meeting, 
the strikers marched along Skaryna prospect to the Supreme 
Soviet building. The building was surrounded by metal barriers 
and a line of militiamen, so the meeting was held in front of 
the right entrance facing Engels street. While amplifiers and 
loudspeakers were being installed, the strikers were shouting: 
"Resignation! Resignation!" 
  The meeting near the Supreme Soviet was opened by Syarhey 
Antonchyk, after which the floor was given to Minsk City Soviet 
Deputy Anatol Hurynovych, Supreme Soviet Deputies Yawhen 
Tsumaraw, Zyanon Paznyak, and Syarhey Navumchyk, as well as to 
intellectuals, students, and workers. The speakers bitterly 
criticized the activities of the legislature and the government 
which "having led the nation to complete poverty are continuing 
to sell Belarus." 
  Syarhey Antonchyk called on the people to help appoint 
former 
Interior Minister Uladzimir Yahoraw to the same post in the new 
Council of Ministers. The participants reiterated their 
demands: The resignation of the Kebich government, the 
formation of a provisional government of people's trust, early 
elections in March 1994, and granting strike committees 15 
minutes of broadcast time every night after the Panorama 
newscast [1900 GMT]. The Supreme Soviet has been given until 
1200 on 22 February to discuss these demands. 
  After reading their demands, the demonstrators started to 
exclaim: "We want Hryb," because they expected that the Supreme 
Soviet chairman would come out of the building to receive the 
petition. After Mechyslaw Hryb failed to show up, a delegation 
was formed to hand the petition to him. The delegation 
represented by People's Deputies Syarhey Navumchyk and Aleh 
Papkow and Belarusian Strike Committee members Mikalay Zimin and 
Alyaksandr Lysenka entered the building and handed the petition 
over to Mechyslaw Hryb. According to Syarhey Navumchyk, "we 
received no concrete answer, but Hryb pointed out that the main 
thing to be done for Belarus now is the adoption of the state 
[word indistinct]. Asked about his attitude toward the 
government's resignation Hryb said that he could do nothing 
about it. I understood that the Supreme Soviet chairman was 
dumbfounded." 
  At 1340 the meeting at the Supreme Council finished. There 
were no incidents involving either the militia or the strikers.

  [Text] Minsk, February 15 (BELINFORM-TASS) -- The 
resignation of the Viacheslav Kebich government, the election of 
a new government of popular trust and the early elections to the 
parliament are the three demands formulated by participants in 
the indefinite general political strike called in Belarus today. 
  The mass action is organized by the republic's striking 
committee, whose headquarters told BELINFORM that the most 
serious events are expected in the capital, as well as in Orsha, 
a major railway junction, and Soligorsk, the republic's mining 
center. 
  It appears that the call to strike has not met with support 
in most work collectives. The official trade unions have said 
in a statement that the action was premature, and many major 
industrial enterprises have declaimed to join. The call for 
mass action was condemned by the leaders of the parliament and 
government. 
  As of this hour, the action concentrates on independence 
square in Minsk, where tens of thousands of strikers from across 
the republic first met in April 1991. Now no more than 2-3 
thousand people have converged on the square.

  [Text] Minsk, February 15 (TASS) -- The political strike 
scheduled for today failed, as the majority of Minsk enterprises 
are working in a normal regime. The car plant has a day-off due 
to the absence of spares. 
  A rally of participants in a political strike began at 11 
A.M. Today [0800 GMT] on Minsk Nezavisimost Square to attract 
4,000 local residents, much less than it was expected. 
  People's deputies, representatives of parties, movements and 
labor collectives demanded resignation of the current 
authorities, creation of a coalition government and early 
parliament elections. 
  Speakers of the one-hour-long rally, including 
representatives of the Minsk tractor plant and Soligorsk miners, 
criticized the government and the parliament for economic 
crisis, corruption of high places and low wages and salaries. 
An average plant salary is enough to buy several kilos of 
sausages. 
  Then the rally participants moved from the government 
building to the Supreme Soviet to hand over their demands to 
parliament leaders. 
  A proposal on universal elections of the Belarussian 
president will be put forward at a parliament session to begin 
in a week, parliament speaker Mechyslaw Hryb told a meeting with 
representatives of the strikers. If the parliament supports the 
proposal the elections can be held in late May-June. It will 
also be necessary to adopt a new Belarusian constitution, as the 
current fundamental law does not provide for presidency. 
  The Belarusian leader said he is ready to initiate a 
republican referendum on presidential rule. 
  A meeting of the Supreme Soviet Presidium will consider 
demands of the strikers on Thursday. "If these demands are an 
ultimatum, I do not accept ultimatums," said Hryb.

The commentary appeared on the "Step" program and was broadcast 
on Belarusian television on 12 February. According to the 
program, the defense minister's planned meeting with personnel 
of the unit was aimed at instructing soldiers on how to fight 
strikers. The declaration stresses that the Defense Ministry is 
not going to change the existing training schedules so that they 
comply with the current political situation, adding that nobody 
can order soldiers out of their barracks to take part in 
political adventures.

  [Text] Belarus Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich said in a 
television interview on Sunday [13 February] that his government 
intended to take control of food prices. 
  Today the prices of all foodstuffs in the republic, except 
bread and milk products, are not under government control. The 
government plans to introduce a system under which food will be 
sold at fixed prices for special coupons. The prices of sugar 
and alcoholic beverages will remain free from government 
intervention. 
  Describing the proposed monetary union between Belarus and 
Russia as a "salvation," Kebich said the opinions of its 
opponents, Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, could not prevent 
relevant documents from being signed. 
  "Effectively we are in a ruble zone even now," Kebich said. 
He said CIS countries used Russian rubles in their mutual 
transactions. 
  "For example, Kazakhstan is ready to sell us wheat for 
Russian money," Kebich said. 
  "We've reached the peak of the crisis, after which we'll 
start living better," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktar Stryzhak: "Belarusian National Party </F>
Supports a Third Way"] 
  [Text] As we have learned, the organizational committee of 
yet another political organization -- the Belarusian National 
Party [BNP] -- has been established in Minsk. 
  In a telephone conversation with Mikola Kurak, secretary of 
the organizational committee and a reserve officer, Kurak noted 
that his party should not be confused with the existing 
Belarusian National Democratic Party. According to Kurak, the 
main goal of BNP is to unify Belarusians around national ideas, 
establish and strengthen the Belarusian state, integrate into 
Europe, conduct privatization while preserving promising state 
enterprises and kolkhozes, develop national Belarusian business, 
and open the path for foreign capital investments. 
  The BNP organizational committee has issued an appeal to 
citizens of Belarus. The main slogan of the appeal is 
"Belarusians, help yourselves!" In the opinion of the new 
party's founders, Belarusians should consider themselves the 
masters of their land. "We must not allow foreigners to oppress 
us. They are only guests in our common home of Belarus," the 
appeal stresses. "The BNP believes that neither the communist 
way nor the current pseudodemocratic one will lead the country 
out of political disorder and the economic abyss. The BNP 
supports a third way -- the unification of all genuine 
Belarusians on a national basis." 
  The new party is to advocate the supremacy of Belarusians in 
all spheres of the country's life. The founders of BNP believe 
that the democratic development of our state is a matter of the 
future. 
  As Mikola Kurak said, the constituent assembly of the BNP 
will be held in late February or early March. According to 
Kurak, a number of signatures exceeding the minimum required to 
register a party with the Ministry of Justice has been collected 
in the capital alone. Kurak stated that the organizational 
committee has supporters in Brest, Homel, and Mahilew Oblasts, 
who have agreed to establish the BNP.

  - emphasising that the two countries' cooperation in the 
efforts to strengthen European and global security and build 
non-confrontational international relations is the basic element 
of these partnership relations,

the two sides and proceeding from a desire to make a tangible 
contribution to strengthening strategic stability in the world, 
  the president of the Russian Federation and the prime 
minister of the United Kingdom are stating that they will issue 
the necessary instructions on mutual non-targeting of strategic 
nuclear missiles which are under their respective command, so

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Feb -- Russia's President Boris Yeltsin 
and UK Prime Minister John Major "reached agreement in 
principle" that subunits of the Russian Federation and United 
Kingdom armed forces will hold a series of joint exercises 
starting in 1995. They stated this today at the end of their 
talks. 
  The aim of the exercises is to enhance the ability of the 
two 
countries' armies to cooperate during peacekeeping operations. 
The exercises will be the first experience of major armed 
cooperation between the UK and Russian armed forces since the 
World War II. 
  The exercises will be "of both military and political 
significance." As such they will be completely in keeping with 
the spirit of the idea of "partnership for peace" proposed at 
the NATO summit in Brussels in January 1994.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] Official negotiations between Russia and Great 
Britain ended in the Kremlin a few minutes ago. The documents 
signed at them are a mutual acknowledgement of the fact that the 
Russian Federation and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland are not enemies. This was said in the official 
joint statement by the president of the Russian Federation and 
the Prime Minister of Great Britain. 
  [Correspondent Sergey Suntsov] The official visit to Moscow 
of the British Prime Minister John Major began today. [passage 
omitted] 
  A joint statement was signed following the talks. It says 
that the two leaders will give necessary instructions on mutual 
non-targeting of strategic nuclear missiles, to be accomplished 
not later than 30 May 1994. 
  Answering questions, Boris Yeltsin and John Major praised 
the 
state of bilateral relations. The British premier said he 
supports the Russian reforms and observed that cooperation is 
developing in political, trade, and military spheres. 
  The situation in the former Yugoslavia was also discussed 
during the talks. 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] I must say that our positions 
generally coincide. They coincide in the main thing - that is 
that heavy equipment around Sarajevo should be handed over to 
the UN forces, and so the shelling there will stop. Second - 
both the Serbs and the Muslims should be forced, by way of 
negotiations, to sit down at the negotiation table and resolve 
the issue by a peaceful political way and stop the war in 
Yugoslavia. 
  Some are trying to resolve the Bosnian issue without 
Russia's 
participation. I would like to stress that this will fail, we 
will not allow it. Of course Russia will participate actively 
both in the negotiations and in the peaceful solution to the 
tragic events in Yugoslavia. I am happy that Mr. Major is 
supportive of our view. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- Russia is against air

ITAR-TASS after meeting his British counterpart in the Russian 
government building in Moscow. 
  John Major told reporters that Russia, the United States and 
the European Community should use their influence to resolve the 
conflict in Bosnia. 
  The British prime minister said Russia and NATO had the same 
goal in this respect -- we want to put an end to the shelling of 
Sarajevo and reach a long-term political settlement of the 
conflict. 
  Chernomyrdin told journalists that the British prime 
minister 
and himself focused on the development of trade and economic 
relations between the two countries and specific projects 
relating, among other things, to the reconstruction of the 
Moscow telephone network and some technologies for the Russian 
fuel and energy sector. The British prime minister spoke in 
favour of expanding European investments in the Russian industry. 
  Chernomyrdin said the two countries are enjoying the most 
favourable climate for their trade and economic relations: in 
1993, Britain came to rank third among Russia's western foreign 
trade partners.

  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- The British prime 
minister said on Tuesday [15 February] he had found no major 
contradictions with Russia on the Bosnian problem. 
  John Major told reporters after signing joint 
Russian-British 
agreements that the positions of both sides are completely 
identical on the necessity to continue searching for ways of a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict. 
  He added that he and the Russian leader had agreed that such 
a settlement should be stable and that peace cannot be achieved 
by military means. 
  According to Major, the positions of both sides also 
coincide 
on the necessity to place under UN control the heavy armaments 
of the warring sides near Sarajevo. 
  The process has already begun and Major characterised it as 
a 
good chance for achieveing peace and urged Russia, the United 
States and the European Union to join efforts in order not to 
miss the chance. 
  The British prime minister believes that the Russian 
negative 
reaction to the possibility of air strikes on Bosnian Serbs was 
caused by a certain misunderstanding of the essence of the NATO 
decision. 
  He added that this was a competent and balanced decision 
which was limited by the concrete problem of Sarajevo and 
adopted according to a request of the UN secretary general. 
  Major said he shared the conviction of the Russian president 
that British-Russian relations had reached the highest level in 
decades. This concerns trade, politics and military cooperation. 
Such a level of practical cooperation did not exist in the last 
50 years, the British prime minister said. 
  Major added that he had invited Boris Yeltsin to Great 
Britain and that the time of the visit will be agreed upon later.

  [Terxt] Moscow February 15 TASS -- British Prime Minister 
John Major laid a wreath at the unknown soldier's tomb here 
today morning, prior to the ceremony of his official meeting 
with the Russian president. 
  The anthems of Great Britain and Russia were played. A guard 
of honour and a military band marched past the tomb. 
  The traditional wreath-laying ceremony was an expression of 
the British people's gratitude to their ally under the 
anti-Hitlerite coalition, to the country that had saved mankind 
from fascism. 
  Duddley Pound, First Lord of the Admiralty of Great Britain, 
wrote to Admiral King, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy, on 
May 18, 1942, that he deemed it necessary to render every 
possible aid to the Russians at that difficult time. These 
words attested to the British people's deep realisation of their 
allied duty. 
  The British have contributed immensely to the aid rendered 
the Soviet Union in those years. It was marked by unprecedented 
scope, courage and solidarity. As many as 78 famous northern 
convoys, totalling about 1,500 transport ships, had sailed 
thousands of miles to Murmansk and Arkhangelsk through extremely 
dangerous waters during the four years of the Great Patriotic 
War. They delivered food and military hardware, ammunition and 
medicines to the Russian people. Russia will never forget that 
Great Britain had sacrificed the lives of many of its sons to 
help its Russian allies.

  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- Defence cooperation 
between Russia and the United Kingdom is developing 
successfully, Russian Defence Minister and British Secretary of 
State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Douglas Hurd, who is 
accompanying the British prime minister on his visit to Moscow, 
agreed during their meeting here today. 
  The 30-minute conversation of the two ministers centered 
around the Partnership for Peace programme. Russian Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev said on Monday, the Russian Defence 
Ministry fully supports the programme, but views differ on how 
the programme should be implemented, with each country insisting 
on its own viewpoint. 
  Pavel Grachev told the British secretary of state that an 
instrument should be worked out for joining the programme of 
Partnership for Peace. An intermediate plan is needed for this, 
under which European countries would join political alliances by 
region or bilaterally with the Conference for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe playing the dominant role.

Russian side would participate actively in negotiations on the 
Bosnian problem in order to put an end to the war in former 
Yugoslavia through negotiations. 
  Yeltsin told journalists after the signing of the joint 
Russo- British statement on the reciprocal non-targeting of 
strategic missiles, that the Bosnian problem was discussed in 
detail during his negotiations with the British prime minister. 
Our stands are identical on the main point -- it is necessary 
to hand over to the united nations forces the heavy guns, 
deployed around Sarajevo. "This measure," the president said, 
"will allow us to stop the shelling of that city." 
  "Moreover," Yeltsin stated, "both sides have confirmed 
during 
the negotiations that the Bosnian problem should be resolved 
primarily by peaceful means, through negotiations. This will 
allow us to put an end to the war in former Yugoslavia." 
  Yeltsin recalled that the Bosnian problem was now being 
discussed in the U.N. Security Council. "This body must issue a 
mandate to the Blue Helmets to accept the guns removed from 
positions around Sarajevo. This is most important," he stated. 
The president believes the positions of the hostile parties in 
Bosnia could be bombed only if the Blue Helmets were attacked 
and called for help. "if somebody attacks the U.N. forces, he 
must be punished," he stressed. 
  Touching on bilateral relations, Boris Yeltsin noted that 
the 
dynamics of their development since his visit to London was 
borne out by the joint statement on the reciprocal non-targeting 
of strategic nuclear missiles, signed here today, which is the 
first document of this kind in the world. 
  The joint statement, signed by Boris Yeltsin and John Major 
today, says that they would issue orders not to target at each 
other the strategic nuclear missiles under their command. This 
will be done not later than May 30, 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin by </F>
V. Martynov; place and date not given; fron the "Vesti" newscast 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Martynov] What was the aim of your visit to 
Yugoslavia, the territory of the former Yugoslavia, today? 
  [Churkin] It was very simple: to prevent the renowned air 
strikes around Sarajevo. 
  [Martynov] What do you think, can Russia really prevent the 
bombing of the Serb positions and, more generally, the bombing 
of Bosnia by NATO forces? 
  [Churkin] All of our efforts are directed toward this, but I 
would like to stress the following, that we have a dual task. I 
have tried to underline this. Although the prevention of air 
strikes is important, the lifting of the blockade of Sarajevo is 
important too, because we really can no longer tolerate what has 
been happening around this city for almost two years now. We 
were perhaps even the first to state after the well-known, 
tragic events in Sarajevo on 5 February that it there should be 
agreement during the next few days, that this task, the lifting 
of the blockade on the city, should be carried out.

  [Text] Zagreb, 15 Feb -- "The aim of my visit to Zagreb can 
be put in a single phrase: to prevent air strikes in the 
Sarajevo region," Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian Federation 
president's special envoy and deputy foreign affairs minister, 
stated on Monday [14 February] evening to the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent. But this is a dual task, he said. The blockade 
of Sarajevo absolutely must be lifted. 
  This issue was given absolute priority at the Russian 
diplomat's meeting yesterday with Yasushi Akashi, the UN 
secretary general's special representative to the former 
Yugoslavia, as well as at consultations planned for today in 
Sarajevo with General Michael Rose, the commander of the UN 
forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and with the commanders of the 
Bosnian Serbs and Muslims. 
  Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent about 
the actions that Russia will take if strikes were not 
successfully averted, Vitaliy Churkin stressed that "everything 
will depend on the specific situation." "If strikes are made 
under conditions that we do not consider justifiable, then the 
consequences for our relations with the world around us are 
inevitable," the high-ranking Russian diplomat said, stressing 
that this was his personal view.

  [Text] Zagreb, February 15 (TASS) -- Vitaliy Churkin, 
special representative of the Russian president and deputy 
foreign minister, had a series of meetings here on Monday night 
to discuss ways to settle conflicts between the republics of the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  Churkin met in particular with Yashushi Akashi, the U.N. 
secretary-general's special representative in the former 
Yugoslavia, and General Michael Rose, commander of the U.N. 
Force. 
  "The purpose of my arrival in Zagreb can be formulated in 
one 
phrase: to secure that there are no air strikes in the area of 
Sarajevo. This is a dual task, though. The siege of Sarajevo 
must be lifted", Churkin told ITAR-TASS. 
  Asked what would be Russia's actions if air strikes are not 
avoided, Churkin emphasised that "everything will depend on a 
specific situation". 
  "If air strikes are delivered under conditions which we 
would 
deem unjustified, that would have inevitable consequences for 
our relations with the rest of the world," he said, pointing out 
that this is his personal point of view. 
  On Tuesday Churkin is to visit Sarajevo and then return to 
Zagreb for a continuation of the talks.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 15 Feb -- The main aim of Russian diplomacy 
at the present stage of efforts to settle the conflict in former 
Yugoslavia is to forestall the possibility that the warring 
sides' positions around Sarajevo might be bombed. Vladimir 
Ivanovskiy, a Russian Foreign Ministry representative, said this 
today at parliamentary hearings, which the State Duma's 
committee on geopolitical issues is holding. He accused both 
Serbs and Muslims of committing genocide against their own 
people, stressing that the aim of Russian diplomacy is to 
actively "encourage the use of political means to settle the 
conflict." 
  At the same time Vladimir Ivanovskiy described suggestions 
that peacekeeping forces should be pulled out of former 
Yugoslavia as "premature." He stressed that Russian diplomatic 
efforts were directed at achieving a single approach to the way 
that all interested parties -- Russia, the United States, and 
the European states -- view a political resolution of the 
conflict.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations, February 15 (TASS) -- "The NATO 
Council has not been empowered to adopt decisions on the essence 
of the Bosnian settlement, including the decision to deal air 
strikes in Bosnia. Such decisions must be adopted by the U.N. 
Security Council," says a statement by the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, circulated here as a document of the Security Council 
on Monday [14 February]. 
  "The NATO Council has adopted a statement on the Bosnian 
crisis problem. The council has urged all the sides involved 
--the Serbs and the Moslems -- to urgently place all their heavy 
armaments in Sarajevo district under U.N. control and to 
withdraw them from the city. This, in fact, is close to our 
stand. Russia has repeatedly advanced the initiative to 
urgently demilitarise Sarajevo and place the city under U.N. 
administrative control. We regard such measures as the most 
important step leading to the settlement of the Bosnian conflict 
as a whole. We are also pleased that the NATO Council, just as 
Russia, has confirmed its support to the idea of settling the 
conflict in Bosnia through negotiations. This calls for the 
world community's vigorous pressure on all the sides involved in 
the conflict. Unfortunately, an attempt to interpret this 
statement as a unilateral ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, who 
are threatened by air strikes, can be traced in the positions of 
several NATO members. The Russian Federation cannot agree with 
such one-sidedness," the statement points out. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry stresses: "We are also sure 
that 
the Security Council should adopt, as we have proposed two weeks 
ago, decisions on the problem of de-blocking Sarajevo. 
Unfortunately, Russia's proposal was not accepted. This 
problem was at the same time submitted to the NATO council 
which, as we know, is not vested with the right to adopt 
decisions on the essence of the Bosnian settlement. The U.N. 
secretary-general had previously asked NATO to report on the 
alliance's readiness to use its Air Force if requested by the 
United Nations. A decision on such a request must be adopted by 
the secretary-general after consultations with members of the 
Security Council. This procedure, established by the Security 
Council, must be observed without fail." 
  The document notes that reports were received a few hours 
before the announcement on the NATO decision that the Bosnian 
Serbs and the Moslems had reached, with U.N. mediation, an 
agreement to cease fire, and had agreed on concrete measures to 
withdraw their armaments from Sarajevo. "The hasty decision, 
adopted outside the United Nations, may thwart this promising 
process. Progress towards a settlement is possible only if 
neither side gets advantages in the process of demilitarisation, 
effected by U.N. Forces," the document stresses. 
  The Russian Federation, the statement points out, offers the 
U.N. Security Council to urgently consider "practical ways to 
demilitarise Sarajevo and establish U.N. administration in it".

  [Text] UN Headquarters, 14 Feb -- Russia put forward an 
important initiative at the UN Security Council on urgently 
demilitarizing Sarajevo and introducing UN control in this town, 
Yuliy Vorontsov, Russian Federation permanent representative at 
the United Nations, said at today's open discussion of the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the Security Council. 
  "We note with satisfaction the agreement that UN Protection 
Force [UNPROFOR] leaders have attained with Bosnian Serbs and 
the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina on a cease-fire and 
measures to ensure that all the sides, both Serbs and Muslims, 
urgently put their heavy armaments in the area of Sarajevo under 
UNPROFOR control or withdraw them from there. This is close to 
our positon. Russia has already more than once put forward an 
initiative of urgently demilitarizing Sarajevo and putting this 
town under UN control. We regard such measures as an important 
step toward settling the entire Bosnian conflictm," Vorontsov 
said.

  [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev reiterated 
his opposition to bomb attacks on the Serb positions near 
Sarajevo. He told journalists on Monday [14 February] that bomb 
attacks could escalate the military crisis in the center of 
Europe. 
  To quote Grachev, bomb attacks, even if they are carried out 
with extreme precision, which he doubts would be the case, would 
kill many people. 
  He also said that the decision on the withdrawal of the 
Russian peacekeeping force from Bosnia, if bomb attacks begin, 
must be taken by the country's political leaders. He said that 
Russian servicemen would have to perform their peacekeeping 
mission all the same. "So I don't think the Russian troops 
should be removed even after bombings," he said. 
  Speaking about Russia's possible participation in the 
Partnership for Peace project, Grachev said that this document 
had not yet been discussed by all the parties concerned. Every 
country interprets this document in its own way, he said. For 
instance, Eastern Europe and the Baltic States view this 
document in the context of a transitional period till joining 
NATO. 
  "For us this is a document which has to do with all European 
countries because it is expected to ensure European security," 
said Grachev. He also noted that Russia considered the 
Partnership for Peace project to be an intermediary step towards 
an even closer European political alliance under the leading 
role of the CSCE. 
  On the whole, Russia supports the Partnership for Peace 
project, he said. He did not say, though, when Russia would 
join it because, he said, the final instrument of joining this 
program has not been worked out yet.

  [Text] Moscow February 14 TASS--"If upon the expiration of 
the ten-day ultimatum NATO begins bombing Bosnian Serb positions 
around Sarajevo, the public reaction in Russia will be 
negative," Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian president's 
administration, told ITAR- TASS on Monday. 
  Filatov supported the position of Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev who said that force against Bosnian Serbs can be 
used only in extreme situations when all other means of conflict 
settlement prove unsuccessful. 
  Earlier today, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said 
that Russia is against air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Grachev spoke out against solving the Bosnian problem by 
force. The war experience of the United States in Vietnam and 
the Soviet Union in Afghanistan shows that inter-ethnic 
conflicts should be settled by political means, he added. 
  "If the bombing takes place, it will do no good to anyone," 
the Russian defence minister said. He stressed that Russian 
peacekeepers will stay in former Yugoslavia and continue their 
mission.

  "I think this might inflict psychological damage to this 
diplomatic initiative," Kostikov told Interfax on Tuesday. 
  "The concept of this program has not been explained or 
understood fully," he went on to say, "many may perceive air 
strikes on the Serb positions by the NATO forces, in which the 
U.S. plays the leading role, as the implementation of this 
project. Given this, the operation might be viewed as the false 
start of the American initiative." 
  Kostikov also said that it was in the United States' and 
Russia's common interests to find a political solution to the 
Bosnia conflict.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Malinov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- Greek plenipotentiary 
ambassador to Russia Kiriakos Rodhousakis said in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS on Monday [14 February] that the position taken 
by Greece as regards launching air-strikes on Serbian positions 
in the area of Sarajevo is absolutely clear. Greece is, 
perhaps, the only country of the North Atlantic alliance which 
declared that it disagrees with the NATO decision, which was 
officially registered in its document, the ambassador said. He 
spoke at a meeting of Russian and Greek businessmen arranged at 
the Greek embassy in Moscow. 
  The ambassador pointed out that if the bombardment and 
military intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina begin, none of 
the Balkan countries should take part in these operations. 
Turkey, for instance, declared its readiness to send combat 
aircraft and take part in possible military operations which 
might entail more serious consequences, the ambassador said. 
  The situation in former Yugoslavia and issues of Russo-Greek 
bilateral relations and cooperation between the European Union 
and Russia will be in the focus of attention during Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's one-day visit to Athens 
scheduled on February 18, the ambassador said. 
  The Russian foreign minister will have talks with the Greek 
government and members of the so-called EC trio consisting of 
heads of foreign ministries of the former, future and present 
chairman of the European Union - Belgium, Germany and Greece, 
respectively. 
  According to the ambassador, the development of Russo-Greek 
relations goes ahead, especially following Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin's visit to Greece. However, there was some 
stalemate in these relations because of parliamentary elections 
held in the two countries. However, Russo-Greek agreements will 
be given a new impetus by visits to Moscow by the Greek foreign, 
economics, defence and culture ministers and representatives of 
other departments. 
  Recently, new possibilities for the development of bilateral 
relations appeared, the ambassador added. A few days ago a 
delegation of the greek olympic airways company arrived in 
Moscow to discuss with their Russian colleagues the 
possibilities for the soonest possible opening of direct air 
routes connecting the capitals of both countries. 
  A delegation of the Greek Tourist Organisation (ZOT) is 
expected to visit Moscow soon to prepare expositions of Greek 
companies organising trips to Greece. A forum of Greek and 
Russian entrepreneurs is expected to be held in Moscow to 
discuss ways for further development of bilateral cooperation.

<F P=106> [Observer Aleksandr Golts article under the "Topic of the </F>
Week" rubric: "Bosnian Knot and Moscow's Policy"] 
  [Text] Do you remember the cheerful mustached idiot in the 
film "Intervention" with his "regular army with a capital R -- 
now that's something special"? It seemed to this inhabitant of 
Odessa, traumatized by the civil war, that the jolly French guys 
coming ashore from their ships were a foreign army that would 
finally bring order to the war-torn country. All this week, 
while NATO's political leaders and military have been hastily 
composing plans for air attacks and agreeing the text of an 
ultimatum to the warring parties in Bosnia, I have been 
recalling this character. Because once again seemingly sensible 
politicians are being taken in by the dangerous illusion that, 
by using military might, they can settle a regional conflict. 
  Having found themselves in a truly unpleasant situation 
following the Sarajevo market tragedy (a tragedy which, let me 
note, was largely attributable to the inconsistency of those who 
have been drawn into settling the conflict), the Western states 
as if by magic resolved to resort to the threat of using 
military force. Judging by reports coming from Sarajevo, the 
various sides in the conflict have apparently agreed to a 
cease-fire; they have also agreed to withdraw their heavy 
weapons or hand them over to UN representatives. However, the 
contracting parties themselves are not hiding their considerable 
skepticism about the likelihood of the agreement being 
implemented. 
  So it is entirely possible that those who issued the 
ultimatum will find they have to carry out their threats in the 
next few days. In previous editions of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA the 
complete dubiousness of the air strikes that are being prepared 
has in my view been convincingly demonstrated. Both from the 
military and the moral viewpoint. It is quite clear that air 
attacks will not disarm those who are training their guns on the 
peaceful inhabitants. And of course, those who really are 
guilty of this crime will escape retribution. I am suggesting 
that we should concentrate on a purely utilitarian approach, so 
to speak. Is it ultimately possible for a foreign "regular army 
with a capital R" to put a stop to an internal conflict which 
has already reached the scale of a full-blown war? 
  All the experience of the last few years, which is, let us 
be 
frank, a sad experience (let us recall Somalia, for example) 
unequivocally demonstrates that however hard such an army tries 
to stay neutral and "give each sister a pair of earrings," the 
use of force in itself inevitably drags this army down to 
playing the role of one of the parties to the conflict. With 
all the consequences that this entails. Then the medicine 
really does become more dangerous than the actual disease. 
  This is precisely the reason why Russia is demanding that 
the 
issue of air strikes be discussed in the UN Security Council. 
As Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev indicates in his letter to 
the UN secretary general, the resolutions adopted earlier by the 
Security Council certainly do not give a "green light" to 
bombing missions. The fact that this approach suits Russian 
interests is demonstrated by its almost unanimous support in the 
State Duma. And if talk of partnership with the West is not 
just idle chatter, NATO cannot fail to take account of the 
Russian position. 
  It would seem that the unanimous Russian refusal to 
countenance a "forced peace" in the former Yugoslavia should 
provide guarantees about a reappraisal of strong-arm methods 
regarding Russia's policy toward Commonwealth countries. 
However, in this instance not everything is so clear-cut. In 
my view, the tragic Yugoslav experience and the West's feeble 
attempts to settle the conflict have not been duly taken on 
board in our policy toward Commonwealth countries. 
  This is the policy expressed in a blueprint which in the 
West is already being called the "Kozyrev doctrine." The issue 
revolves around the statement which has been made in a number of 
the foreign minister's speeches regarding the obvious fact that 
the CIS is a zone of vital Russian interests. Moreover, the 
minister has warned against hastily withdrawing contingents of 
Russian troops from CIS states, rightly regarding our military 
presence as a factor contributing to stability. 
  I completely disagree with those who have been quick to see 
a 
manifestation of imperial ambitions in this approach. The fact 
is that Kozyrev's blueprint is not sustained by speculative 
theories about the resurgence of the Russian empire, but by the 
harsh reality of virulent or smoldering conflicts in the 
post-Soviet area. These are conflicts which pose a direct 
threat to Russia's security. 
  However, the implementation of this blueprint could, in my 
view, conceal a quite different sort of danger. Our politicians 
could rush from one extreme to the other: From their familiar 
disregard for the role of the army to attempts to shift onto it 
all activity connected with ensuring Russian interests in 
conflict zones. 
  Practically any "trouble spot" could serve as an example of 
this. Take Tajikistan. The coalition peacekeeping forces, the 
main role in which is played by the Russian contingent, have 
managed to stabilize the situation and at least somehow to halt 
infiltration of the republic from outside. But has a lull -- a 
temporary lull, as many army commanders believe -- simply been 
exploited as a real settlement? It cannot be said that we have 
pushed official Dushanbe and the opposition toward talks. But 
fact remains a fact: The efforts of our diplomacy have 
certainly not had any real result. And will it not be the case 
that reliance on the army will be our only hope when hostilities 
flare up again in the republic with renewed force? 
  Or take the situation in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. 
The ink had hardly had time to dry on the treaty between Moscow 
and Tbilisi, a document which yet again focuses on the 
military-political aspect in the clearest and most explicit 
terms, than hostilities began all over again. It is hard to say 
who initiated these new military clashes. Either the Abkhazian 
forces want to check the truth of Moscow's statements that no 
military assistance will be given to Georgia before a settlement 
is achieved, or Tbilisi is trying to exploit if not the actual 
then at least the psychological advantages of the treaty. 
  It is clear, however, that this treaty has not been a way of 
prompting both sides to seek a political settlement. Nor is it 
evident at the present time that Russia is taking the 
opportunity to pursue a more active policy in the region. At 
the same time the issue of deploying Russian peacekeeping forces 
has been raised. But if this happens when the truce is 
constantly being violated, what sort of peacekeeping are we 
talking about? Our troops will once again find themselves 
between a rock and a hard place. 
  It is probably not Russian politicians' fault that the Army 
is the main instrument for settling military conflicts which 
politicians can then exploit. But it is quite clear that the 
Army cannot and should not be the only instrument. Its 
involvement is effective at the completion rather than the 
initial stage of a settlement, when it is necessary to ensure 
that the agreements which have been secured are carried out. 
However, the idea of using force to compel people to accept 
peace is a dangerous illusion. I am convinced that it will not 
work in Bosnia or in the post-Soviet area. Using the army 
without a consistent political and economic strategy for 
ensuring a settlement gives rise to far more problems than it 
solves.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Liberal Democratic Party Chairman </F>
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy by Petra Prochazkova and Jaromir Stetina 
in Moscow; date not given: "The Czechs Will Clean the Boots of 
German Officers"] 
  [Text] The going rate for a three-minute interview with 
Russian Liberal Democratic Party Chairman Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
is $100. We caught up with him at his general headquarters in 
the center of Moscow. The building's corridors are festooned 
with notice-boards covered in photographs of Vladimir Volfovich 
[Zhirinovskiy]. Telegrams expressing gratitude and 
congratulations are displayed in front of the entrance to the 
grandiose office. Members of the Russian Party of the Crimea 
ask him to "assist historical justice and definitively affiliate 
the Crimea to Russia." The head of the secretariat explains 
that we must pay first and then we will be granted an interview. 
Russian journalists are exempt from the charge. After a 
two-hour wait, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy granted an exclusive 
interview to LIDOVE NOVINY and Czech Television. Free of charge. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, have you received an 
invitation from anyone to visit the Czech Republic? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] You cannot imagine how many different 
invitations I receive. Yes, I received a fax from the 
Republican Party. I will be very happy to visit your country. 
Moreover, on 2 and 3 April we are organizing in Moscow a world 
congress of Slavic and Orthodox peoples. We will also invite 
politicians and deputies from the Czech lands. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] What is your view of the talks on the 
possible bombing of Serb positions in Bosnia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I am opposed to any kind of force against the 
Serbs. I warn you, I view the bombing of Serb cities as if it 
were the bombing of Russian cities. This would absolutely alter 
Russia's foreign policy. If the bombing takes place, we will -- 
of course -- send protests to the countries whose pilots take 
part in it. We will warn them that what they are doing to Serb 
cities will be done to their countries. Bombs will be dropped 
on the cities of those countries that bomb Serb cities. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Apparently, you believe that the Czechs are 
not a full-fledged nation. At the same time, you want to visit 
our country. What is your attitude toward us? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I declare that, regardless of the collapse of 
the USSR and the socialist camp, Russians enjoy the best of 
relations with all Slavs, including the Czechs. I know your 
films, culture, and products well, and I would not like there to 
be any animosity between Czechs and Russians. I invite all 
representatives of political parties, ministers, and deputies to 
our World Slavic Congress. After all, we are one people, one 
culture.... We have to put an end to the animosity that started 
after 1968. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Are you aware that there is a great deal of 
discussion in our country about your visit to the Czech Republic 
and that not everyone is favorably inclined toward it? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It would be strange if everyone loved me. 
That is politics. Democracy. And do you think that everyone 
adores your Hasek? [as published] 
  I do not need to have everyone kissing my hand. For 
instance, in the Czech lands, people have a cooler attitude 
toward me, while in Poland it is even hostile. Therefore, if 
Vaclav Havel is unhappy, then I am also unhappy that a playwrite 
can become the president of a country. I will not write the 
Cherry Orchard, I am not Chekhov. Why is a playwrite a president? 
  Your country is on the decline. I assure you that in 10 
years from now, there will be no Moravia and no Sudetenland. In 
10 years time, the entire Czech nation will curse Havel the way 
the Russian people are cursing Gorbachev. Everyone, including 
myself, applauded him. After Chernenko, Gorbachev was good to 
us. Now we curse this rogue. It will be the same with you. 
Vaclav Havel will die, and in 10 years young Czechs will curse 
him. They will be forced to speak German, to forget their 
mother tongue, to go to German churches, and to clean the boots 
of German officers. This is what will become of the Czechs in a 
few years from now. I am very sorry about this. Therefore, we 
want to talk to everyone at the congress of Slavic peoples. 
After all, there are 300 million of us and we will live 
together in an Eastern European Slavic community. We will not 
serve the West.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Feb -- Russia is not in favor of rocket 
and bomb strikes by the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said today at a meeting 
with Klaus Naumann, inspector-general of the German Bundeswehr. 
General Nuamann is in Russia on an official visit at the 
invitation of the chief of the general staff of the Russian 
Armed Forces. 
  Grachev spoke against the use of force in resolving the 
Bosnian problem. According to him, the experience of U.S. 
military actions in Vietnam and of the Soviet Army in 
Afghanistan proves that one must find political ways for 
resolving international disputes and overcoming armed conflicts. 
  Grachev thinks that if the bomb strikes are still carried 
out, no good will come of it. The Russian defense minister 
pointed out that, in any case, the Russian peacekeeping forces 
would remain in the former Yugoslavia and would continue their 
peacekeeping mission there.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Feb -- Russia and Germany may lead the 
way in ensuring European and world security. The prospects for 
bilateral military and political cooperation reveal such a 
possibility, it was stressed today at a meeting between Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and General Klaus Naumann, the 
inspector general of the German Bundeswehr. 
  The Russian Defense Ministry, Grachev said at the meeting, 
supports the Partnership for Peace program. However, the 
Russian minister noted, there are different approaches to the 
implementation of the program. He believes that it is necessary 
to develop a mechanism for joining the partnership program. 
This requires an intermediate plan that would envisage the 
unification of European countries into political unions, with 
the CSCE playing the leading role both in the regions and on a 
bilateral basis. 
  The program of Naumann's visit to Russia is an intensive 
one. 
Tomorrow he will meet Colonel General Viktor Samsonov, chief of 
staff for the coordination of military cooperation of the CIS 
member-states. During the visit, which ends on 18 February, he 
will also have meetings with First Deputy Defense Minister 
Andrey Kokoshin and Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of general staff 
of the Russian Armed Forces. The German guest is to address 
students and instructors of the General Staff's military 
academy. He will visit troop units stationed on the outskirts 
of Moscow, the 27th Guards Division of Russian peace-keeping 
forces in the Volga military district, and also Volgograd and 
St. Petersburg.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Nikolay Kalintsev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 14 Feb--The first working contact has been 
established between the State Duma and the German Bundestag. 
This was the main result of a visit to Moscow by Karsten Voigt, 
chairman of the German-Russian group in the FRG parliament, 
which ended today. 
  The aim of the visit was to "establish links, immediately 
after the elections, with the political parties and groups in 
the State Duma that might become partners for FRG 
parliamentarians", Voigt noted in a conversation with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. Virtually the entire political 
spectrum in the Russian parliament, including the communists, 
was involved in his meetings. "As for Zhirinovskiy's party, it 
doesn't have any partners in the Bundestag. We hope that it 
will have none in the future either, although the elections to 
the FRG parliament in October this year might bring some 
surprises," the German parliamentarian stated. 
  We, he continued, requested that a group be formed as soon 
as 
possible from among those deputies who are dealing with the FRG 
on links with the Bundestag. "As vice president of the North 
Atlantic Assembly--the NATO parliament," Voigt stressed, "I also 
requested that a delegation be formed to take part in its work 
with the rights of an associated member". This request also met 
with agreement. 
  Representatives of the Russian parliament's committees for 
international issues and defense matters, he said, would take 
part in a seminar on security issues that the Assembly will hold 
in February this year. 
  Voigt expressed the conviction that the cooperation that was 
developing between the State Duma and the Bundestag would "make 
a contribution toward the strengthening of good-neighborly 
relations between Germany and Russia, which are not subject to 
opportunism and are not directed against the interests of third 
countries." He thinks it would be possible to discuss both 
issues of bilateral political and economic cooperation and 
pan-European security problems during regular meetings.

<F P=106> [Vadim Markushin report: "Do Not Create a New Cordon </F>
Sanitaire"] 
  [Text] The decision by the Berlin Senat to hold a 
ceremonial send-off for the Russian motorized infantry brigade 
separately from the other foreign contingents which are leaving 
Berlin this year has been seen as political. In the same breath 
people are saying that it was dictated by the expectations of 
West Berliners, who retain feelings of gratitude to the 
countries which supported the city materially at the height of 
the Cold War. 
  Just who in particular "expects" this is impossible to 
determine, of course. It all reminds you of the well-worn 
cliche: "The general opinion is that...." 
  Meanwhile, questions are being asked. Why, for example, has 
a decision on such an important matter, which should certainly 
not be "kept within the family," been made by the Berlin 
authorities? Why was the decision not made by representatives 
of the governments of the countries of the former anti-Hitler 
coalition in conjunction with the German Federal Government? 
Why are attempts being made to split reunited Berlin again by 
artificially resurrecting these old antagonisms? After all, 
whatever reservations may surround the aforementioned "policy 
decision," it is basically a discriminatory measure against our 
victorious army, our country, and our people. 
  This is how things look: At the time when the vast machinery 
involved in withdrawing the Western Group of Forces had only 
just begun to roll and nothing but hard work could be seen on 
the road ahead, Russian servicemen were buoyed up by speeches 
about a new era and a new partnership. Now, however, when all 
that was needed was a kind and sincere word of farewell, they 
are having to look awkwardly over their shoulders and scrutinize 
those gloomy times in search of reasons to justify their own 
inconsistency. 
  And all this at a time when a joint ceremonial send-off 
would 
appear to offer the most natural ground for strengthening the 
partnership, mutual liking, and personal contacts that are being 
established. A failure to take advantage of this event just to 
pander to someone's nearsightedness and capriciousness would be 
unpardonable.

"Russian-Ukrainian Nuclear Missile Marathon Continues. Kiev Is 
Ready To Get Rid of the Weapons, But After Some Bargaining"] 
  [Text] This week a high-ranking delegation including Yuriy 
Dubinin, special envoy and chief of the Russian Federation state 
delegation to talks with Ukraine; Atomic Energy Minister Viktor 
Mikhaylov; and Colonel General Yevgeniy Maslin, from the 12th 
Main Directorate of the Defense Ministry, held difficult talks 
in Kiev on specific measures to eliminate Ukrainian nuclear 
weapons. 
  Upon returning to Moscow, Ambassador Yuriy Dubinin told your 
SEGODNYA correspondent that "we have agreed on the content of 
the document that will enable us to implement the agreements on 
eliminating nuclear arms in Ukraine, which were reached by 
Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, and Clinton on 14 January." 
Presently, the results of the talks are being "reported" to the 
presidents of Ukraine and Russia. According to official 
reports, however, President Yeltsin has caught a cold and is 
currently inaccessible. 
  Meanwhile, the Russian and Ukrainian delegations agreed that 
until the results achieved in Kiev are approved, no details 
about the process of the talks should be made public. No press 
conferences. It was disclosed, however, that they had "entirely 
substantive talks in Kiev" that were held in "a constructive and 
businesslike atmosphere." Translated from diplomatic-speak into 
plain language, this usually means a tough showdown. 
  The Kiev military and political establishment had long ago 
decided in principle to get rid of what it sees as costly, 
dangerous, and rather useless nuclear weapons, but the 
bargaining over the deal's specifics is set to be long and 
tedious.

Momentum"] 
  [Text] William Perry, the new U.S. defense secretary, 
recently addressed the International Conference on Security 
Questions, confirming that a joint Russian-U.S. exercise is to 
be held in July as scheduled to rehearse collaboration in 
peacekeeping operations. Some of the forces of the Russian 27th 
Motorized Rifle Division in the Volga Military District and the 
U.S. 3d Mechanized Division stationed in Germany will be 
involved in the exercise. 
  Preparations for this, the first joint exercise in the 
history of the two armies, are gaining momentum. The KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA editorial office learned that General Leonard Holder, 
commander of the U.S. 3d Division, is arriving in Russia Sunday 
13 February. After a brief stopover in Moscow he will head off 
to the Volga Military District, where the exercise will be held, 
and will meet there with Major General Anatoliy Sidyakin, 
commander of the Russian 27th Division. 
  The coming exercise will be a command-staff exercise. It is 
thought that around 250 men on each side will be involved in it 
-- officers from both armies' divisions, regiments, and 
battalions.

  [Text] New York February 14 TASS--The Russian-American

<F P=106> ["Second part" of interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, </F>
chairman of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, by an 
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "The Key 
Is Equal Rights"] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] The fire of the international 
opinion industry against you keeps mounting and is gradually 
turning into an inferno, which has hardly been conceivable 
before. For the past few days you have not been accused of 
plans to destroy Germany but of something much worse in the eyes 
of the mass media: You would welcome it if the Oder-Neisse line 
were revised and Germany got back its eastern parts, including 
Stettin [Szczecin], Danzig [Gdansk], Koenigsberg [Kaliningrad], 
and Breslau [Wroclaw]. Moreover, you want to give Poland access 
to the sea between Gdansk and Kaliningrad and, at the same time, 
expand Poland eastward with the area around Lemberg [Lvov] as 
compensation. A revision of the injustice of the deportation of 
the east Germans is certainly the worst that the tabloid press 
in Germany can imagine. After all, how these people have 
suffered because of the unification of FRG and GDR! 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, this was certainly a terrible shock for 
the enemies of the Germans. I have been involved in geopolitics 
ever since my youth. I am also the chairman of the Geopolitical 
Committee of the Russian parliament, the Duma. Naturally, I 
think very much about just solutions. A U.S. president once 
said that nothing is settled that is not settled justly. Why 
should it not be permitted to discuss a revision, that is, a 
completely peaceful solution for eastern Germany, which would 
conform to international law and would be achieved by means of 
negotiations? Why should a lesser law be applied to the German 
people? After all, it is not as though Poland has derived any 
benefit from Germany's eastern areas and that eastern Germany is 
now a flourishing land. Such considerations cannot be taboo any 
more. I rely on a healthy and strong, self-confident, 
sovereign, and once again German Germany as an equal partner 
with Russia. 
  [Correspondent] You have also commented on the problem of 
South Tirol. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] So much is being talked about the right to 
self-determination. Hardly anyone in the world will doubt that 
the South Tiroleans are Germans. No one will want to deny that 
about three-quarters of the population of South Tirol belong to 
the German ethnic Group and the Ladinian ethnic group, which is 
closely linked to the German group. Why should this issue not 
best be settled by the voters, as in the Crimea? Why do we not 
let ourselves be guided by democratic principles? 
  [Correspondent] How do you see the development of democracy 
in Central Europe? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] To what extent is it a democracy and to what 
extent is it a media democracy? To what extent do the masses of 
the voters decide and to what extent are decisions made by a few 
thousand journalists, some of whom bitterly hate their 
fatherland? To what extent does the law decide whether 
undesirable events are permitted, and to what extent is this 
decision made by a few thousand bandits of the so-called 
autonomous scene? The state is strong enough to show criminals 
their place. Desired rallies take place without problems. The 
rule-of-law state is called upon to punish criminal gangs, which 
are specialized in terror against rallies. 
  [Correspondent] The judiciary in our country is overtaxed 
when, half a century after World War II, it is still having to 
pursue proceedings against more than 8,000 accused on the 
defeated side for war crimes or Nazi crimes that were committed 
half a century ago or more. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] What is the purpose of that supposed to be? 
How is one supposed to reach just judgments such a long time 
after the alleged deeds? These defendants must be very old and 
seriously ill. How can a clever and intelligent people like the 
German people permit this to be done to it? Germany must be 
freed from this Babylonian captivity, and it can be freed by 
Russia as a partner and a friend, by a Russia that loves the 
Germans. 
  [Correspondent] Such statements.... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] ...will increase the hatred of the 
anti-German opinion industry against me. 
  [Correspondent] It is implied that you do not want to 
withdraw Russian troops from Germany but increase them by a 
factor of 10. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Quite the contrary: I have repeatedly 
demanded that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Germany. I 
cannot understand that, on the one hand, the Bundeswehr is to be 
reduced and, on the other hand, U.S. soldiers, British, French, 
Belgians, Dutch, and even 100 Canadians are to remain stationed 
in Germany. Do the German people expect any protection by a few 
tens of thousands of foreign soldiers? Naturally, Germany needs 
effective, strong armed forces, but it needs German armed 
forces. Anyone who does not want to afford a sufficiently 
strong army of his own incurs the danger of having a foreign 
army put into his country. 
  And what is the purpose of splitting the Bundeswehr into 
multinational units, in particular under foreign command? Why 
is the German army not solely subordinate to a German General 
Staff? After all, the Germans certainly need not be ashamed of 
their soldiers and their military tradition. 
  [Correspondent] The opinion industry does not like your 
views at all. 
  [Zhirinovksiy] Yes, unfortunately this is true. But the 
Germans must understand that I, as a Russian, pursue a Russian 
policy, and that I love the Russian people and also the German 
people. What kind of a Russian would I be, if I were to pursue 
an anti-Russian policy and the carving up of Russia? When I 
advocate a large and strong Russia, I do not want to build up 
any conflict with Washington. But having several great powers, 
to which Russia and others belong, in addition to Germany and 
the United States, is better for the world than a single 
globocop, to whose tune the world dances. 
  Equal rights in the family of peoples and states is the key 
to real partnership. I abhor war and any kind of military 
conflict, but I am for the peoples' right to self-determination. 
When, for instance, the people in the Crimea, in free 
self-determination and in democratic elections, are of an 
opinion that differs from the one of the Ukrainian Khrushchev, 
who "gave" the Crimea to Ukraine, for me it is the opinion of 
the people that counts and not the decision of a dictator. 
  [Correspondent] Attempts are being made to present you to 
the people as an opponent or even an enemy of President Yeltsin. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] But this is not so at all. I respect and 
value President Yeltsin, and this is mutual. President Yeltsin 
may occasionally make mistakes, but he wants the best for 
Russia. I was not involved at all in the putsch against him 
and, as is generally known; I had nothing to do with it. By the 
way, at that time I was with the German People's Union in the 
Nibelungen Hall [in Passau]. 
  [Correspondent] But you have a constructive and not at all 
hostile or even just opposition relationship with the Russian 
communists in the Duma. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] The communists in the Duma are in no way 
responsible for what happened under Stalin. Today's Russians 
and today's Germans should live and work and shape their future 
freely and completely free of the burden of the pasts. Today's 
Russian communists are, by the way, honorable people and not 
traitors who served a foreign power at some time in the past. 
Why should we dig artificial trenches and establish 
contradictions in the current, terrible situation in Russia, 
which reminds us of Germany's situation after the war. 
  [Correspondent] If no miracle happens, and no murder or any 
other evil deed prevents it, you will be Russia's next 
president. How will you tackle the country's internal problems? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We will pursue a mixture of well thought-out 
planned economy and moderate market economy and give the people 
in Russia hope and work again; we will stop inflation and help 
the Russians to live a dignified life. Within three months I 
will destroy the several hundred mafia gangs that dominate 
business in our country by, among other things, so-called 
protection money, and every kind of serious criminals, who make 
our streets unsafe, with the entire rigor of the law and a 
police force that is free of any corruption. Law and order must 
be restored. I guarantee it. And the Russians know that.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Liberal Democrat Deputy Volfovich </F>
Zhirinovskiy by Vivien Lando in Moscow "shortly before leaving 
for a tour of the Balkans"] 
  [Text] [Lando] What explanation do you have for the good 
results obtained by your party, the Liberal Democratic Party, 
during the recent election? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Our party is completely new and we have an 
open and realistic program. I emphasize three issues: First, 
end all economic aid to the former USSR republics; second, 
interrupt the reconversion of the military industry for civilian 
purposes; and third, adopt tight measures against crime. Only 
by doing this will we be able to improve the living standards of 
the entire country. Moreover, I was never a communist and that 
is in my favor. 
  [Lando] Your adversaries claim that if you had not been a 
Communist Party member you would not have made the career that 
you made. Is it possible? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I have never been a communist, and I am happy 
with that. That is precisely what helped me and what is still 
helping me now, because all the other leaders of our party are 
old Communist Party members. 
  [Lando] St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak said you are a 
former KGB agent, and that the Soviet political police created 
your party to bother Boris Yeltsin. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Never. All that is propaganda. Just like they 
say that I am a Zionist, anti-Jewish, a member of the radical 
right or left, or Jewish. Nothing of the sort. I am Russian, 
Russian, Russian. 
  [Lando] You were elected thanks to a million-dollar 
campaign, 
by Russian standards, with expenses surpassing $800,000. Who 
sponsored that financial support? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Everyone. Two years ago, in the elections for 
president, I received more than 6 million votes. If each one of 
them had given me 1,000 rubles, I would have had 6 billion 
rubles, which is equivalent to approximately $3.5 million. 
Everybody? We receive money through the mail. But I will not 
disclose the name of the main sponsors: Secrecy is the essence 
of business. 
  [Lando] What are the grounds for your criticism of U.S. 
foreign policy? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We believe the U.S. people are good-natured. 
And this is the reason why they should stop meddling in world 
affairs. I warn President Bill Clinton: Do not repeat the 
mistakes of Napoleon and Hitler. The United States will soon 
begin to deteriorate because of its ethnic conflicts. It then 
will have its own perestroyka, with its degradation and 
iniquities. We, the Russians, will not hail the day when the 
United States stops being united, when factories stop, when 
there is no more food and medicine, and when all the U.S. people 
migrate to Russia, Europe, or Japan. The United States exists 
simply because it robbed Latin America and Africa. It became 
rich with two world wars and because, over the past 50 years, it 
took the best brains -- almost all U.S. mathematicians are 
Russian Jews. 
  [Lando] Can you give your opinion on some outstanding 
figures 
in Russian history, beginning with Mikhail Gorbachev? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Very weak and very naive. 
  [Lando] Leonid Brezhnev. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] A selfish person who lived only for his own 
family and himself, but not for Russia. 
  [Lando] Stalin. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Rude and criminal. 
  [Lando] Lenin. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Magnificent. A genius, as a theoretician. A 
wise man, but a failure as a politician. 
  [Lando] What was the best and the worst of the communist 
government during the USSR's existence? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] There were many victims; we lost 60 million 
people. It is absurd. But there are positive things in the 
economy -- the construction sector, the schools. Even with that, 
the balance is negative. 
  [Lando] In your autobiography, you say that Russia's natural 
borders are the Indian Ocean. To implement this idea, it would 
be necessary to conquer several countries, among them 
Afghanistan. Are you proposing a colonial war? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We are not against the existing borders. But 
since they are being changed, we want to return to Russia's 
historical, natural borders; obviously, through peaceful 
methods, through our economic links. We will thus be able to 
satisfy the desires of people who live next to our borders and 
who are anxious to once again be part of Russia. 
  [Lando] You also dream of putting the countries of the old 
Soviet bloc in East Europe under Moscow's control? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I am for solidarity between Slav countries: 
We are neighbors and we have the same economic and cultural 
background. But I want a union without military interference and 
without one country dominating the others. The government should 
not be exercised from Moscow. The center can be located in 
Prague, Sofia, or Warsaw. 
  [Lando] You said on many occasions that you would not 
hesitate to use nuclear weapons. Are you ready to press the 
button? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I will never use nuclear weapons, and I am 
against the use of even conventional arms. It is like using 
violence against a woman: It is a crime. The same thing happens 
between states and peoples. I prefer dialogue. 
  [Lando] What is your opinion of the comparison made between 
your ideas and the fascist ideology? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It's mere propaganda aimed at reducing my 
influence on voters. Rather than harming me, it ends up helping 
me because many Russian say: "If the chief of the party for 
whom we voted is a fascist and if the party for which we voted 
is fascist, then we are also fascist." The result is the 
opposite of what they sought. I must thank them for it. 
  [Lando] Do you think democracy can work in countries of 
continental size like Brazil and Russia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Very slowly. It can succeed in the long term, 
but not now. 
  [Lando] Would you agree to an alliance with communists? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I might use some communists as ministers. But 
by no means a totally communist government. The ideal is to give 
10 percent to Communists, 10 percent to Radical Democrats, 10 
percent to other parties, and 70 percent for us. 
  [Lando] Why didn't you engage in the White House battle in 
October 1993, when Yeltsin dissolved the conservative congress? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It was not our war. It was a war between red 
and pink communists. I am not a communist; I am a democrat. 
  [Lando] What does Russia expect from the West? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Nothing! We do not need any help from the 
West. And we beg, leave us alone. That is the best thing they 
can do for us. 
  [Lando] Why don't you believe in Western help? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] There is no help at all. It's all lies. They 
send old clothes, spoiled canned food that no one wants to eat. 
Send cars, because we do not need rags! 
  [Lando] You have proposed redividing the world in areas of 
influence, like during the Cold War. Only this time it will be a 
North-South division. How does that work? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Why should the United States meddle with 
European affairs? Let it take care of Latin America; let Europe 
take care of Africa; let China and Japan to take care of 
Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand; and let Russia take 
care of Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. This vertical domination 
will produce a good, warm climate all over the world. We will 
spend less in transportation, communications. Fewer planes will 
fly, thus making air and water cleaner, and the environment will 
be preserved. I might live in just one city, my Alma-Ata. 
  [Lando] Some people believe you are trying to become rapidly 
rich because you know that your presence on the political stage 
will be brief. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No, I am not interested in money, women, 
alcohol, or drugs. I am only interested in my country. I want to 
see the honest eyes of my voters while they call me Vladimir and 
kiss my hand (he makes the gesture). 
  [Lando] Is Vladimir Zhirinovskiy a hero? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Possibly, because this new era calls for a 
leader. The people need a center behind which to close ranks, a 
star in the sky, the moon in the middle of the night. Under this 
viewpoint, I might be mythical. It is not because I want it, but 
because the people want it. 
  [Lando] Do you think it is possible to be optimistic in 
Russia? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Of course. Our country has marked history 
with 
its heroism. It has a big bright area and various climates. We 
play an essential role in the world. Neither Africa, nor Latin 
America, nor Asia have such significance. Only France, Germany, 
Great Britain, and Russia.

  [Excerpt] Washington, 14 Feb -- [passage omitted] The 
current official visit to the United States marks an important 
stage in the development of relations between Kazakhstan and the 
United States, President Nazarbayev said. The talks with the 
U.S. President proceeded "in a cordial and friendly atmosphere," 
the Kazakh leader stressed, expressing satisfaction with the 
fact that the White House meeting had proved "productive." 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev noted that the Charter of Democratic 
Partnership signed by the two presidents "marks a qualitatively 
new stage in our relations, which are now assuming a more 
comprehensive and long-term character." The document "embraces 
such areas as politics, economics, military cooperation, 
science, and technology, ecology, health care, and more." 
Security guarantees from the United States contained in the 
Charter, as well as Kazakhstan's participation in the 
multilateral cooperation in the framework of the Partnership for 
Peace program adopted by NATO, strengthen our confidence in 
Kazakhstan's future as a sovereign state, President Nazarbayev 
stressed. 
  Earlier on Monday Kazakhstan's president met representatives 
of the U.S. business community. An agreement was signed on the 
principles of cooperation between the Republic of Kazakhstan, 
the U.S. Government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation, 
and the U.S.-Kazakhstan Council for Economic Development.

Akhmetalimov and Igor Barsukov] 
  [Text] Washington February 15 TASS -- A meeting between 
Bill Clinton and President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan 
took place in the White House on Monday. Nazarbayev had arrived 
in the United States for an official visit. 
  At the close of the talks, the two presidents signed a 
charter of democratic partnership between Kazakhstan and the 
U.S. Nazarbayev handed Mr Clinton a deed of accession of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan to the treaty on non-proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Speaking at an ensuing press conference, the U.S. President 
said this was his first meeting with the president of Kazakhstan 
and it turned up to be a very good one. The two countries' 
efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons are one 
of the most important aspects of bilateral cooperation, Mr 
Clinton said. 
  The handing over of a deed of accession to the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty as a historic step which gives an 
example to the whole world at the time that is crucial for 
international efforts as regards non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons, he added. 
  The U.S. President announced that in order to strengthen 
partnership between the two countries and support reforms being 
effected by Kazakhstan, the U.S. will give Kazakhstan 311 
million dollars this year as against 91 million dollars last 
year. "We also agreed to develop trade between the two 
countries", Mr Clinton said.

  The talks centered on matters aimed at further refining 
bilateral cooperation and at strengthening security in the 
world, the development of the situation in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States and in Central Asia. 
  The signed charter on democratic partnership "marks a 
qualitatively new stage in our relations which gain in scope and 
assume a long-term character", Nazarbayev said. 
  During the visit, the two sides signed a memorandum of 
understanding and cooperation between the Defence Ministries of 
the two countries, an agreement on cooperation between the U.S. 
and Kazakhstan in science and technology, as well as a bilateral 
agreement on the exchanges of technical information and 
cooperation in nuclear safety. 
  Later on a three-sided agreement was signed between 
Kazakhstan, the U.S. and Russia on technological guarantees in 
view of the launch of a U.S.-made Inmarsat-3 satellite from 
Baykonur cosmodrome by a Russian Proton booster rocket. 
  Nazarbayev later visited the Pentagon. A U.S.-Kazakh accord 
was signed on joint defence cooperation and providing U.S. help 
to the new republic in converting its arms industry to civilian 
use. 
  Defence Secretary William Perry said he would visit 
Kazakhstan next month to begin implementation of the accord.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Nadein: "United States Wants Showcase </F>
Cooperation With Kazakhstan"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of 
Kazkahstan, currently in Washington, is better known here than 
his country, although this is not surprising for the United 
States, where geography is not a separate subject in schools. 
  The Russian bias, of which the present U.S. administration 
has long been accused, recently found yet another critic -- 
serious and unexpected -- in the shape of Nazarbayev. 
  In contrast to the Ukrainians, for example, the Kazakhstan 
leader has invariably been courteous toward Moscow. That is now 
a thing of the past. Last week, on the eve of his second U.S. 
visit, Nazarbayev added his voice to the chorus of those for 
whom assistance for Moscow has long since ceased to be a symbol 
of the general rush to democracy. 
  Two years ago Nazarbayev's position contrasted sharply with 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's pronouncements. At that 
time the Kazakhstan leader did not follow the Ukrainian guest's 
example and refused to criticize Russia, which made a very 
favorable impression on the former administration. 
  This time Kravchuk will be coming to Washington a few weeks 
after Nazarbayev. Specialists believe that on this occasion 
their views of Moscow, while not coinciding, will not be too 
different. 
  Following the dramatic changes in Russian domestic and 
foreign policy, Kazakhstan has acquired special importance for 
the West. It is the only one of the major post-Soviet nuclear 
states to move toward nuclear-free status, somewhat more slowly 
than Washington probably would have liked, but not by fits and 
starts. Small and large enterprises are being privatized here 
consistently and more quickly than anywhere else in the former 
USSR. The enormous oil deposits, surpassed only by the reserves 
in the Persian Gulf, give hope of an influx of hard currency and 
financial stabilization. 
  Of course, hard currency for Baykonur -- that is, joint 
missile launches, participation in international 
telecommunications programs, and admittance to the high 
technology club -- remains a dream. That was the motivation 
behind Nazarbayev's agreement to join the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation treaty. For its 104 heavy ICBM's, each with 10 
nuclear warheads, Kazakhstan will get $311 million next year -- 
three times as much as expected. When Secretary of State 
Christopher visited the Kazkahstan capital last fall he insisted 
that Nazarbayev sign the nonproliferation treaty. Nazarbayev 
refused. Well aware that the possession of nuclear weapons 
makes his country the object of international attention, the 
president of Kazakhstan would only agree to a ceremony in the 
White House -- with President Clinton. The Clinton 
administration would be happy to arrange some kind of showcase 
cooperation, in particular in the economic sphere. But this 
depends only to a limited extent on the administration. More 
than 50 major U.S. corporations are already operating in 
Kazakhstan, but they are cautious and in no rush, and their 
participation falls far short of what the country needs.

  [Text] The U.S. Embassy in Kazakhstan has issued a 
statement. It announces that no U.S. Government official is in 
any way involved in the dispute between the mayor of Almaty and 
a Kazakhstan business leader. Articles that have recently 
appeared in the local press which contained detailed 
implications do not have any foundation. Apart from that, it

  [Text] Moscow February 14 TASS -- "The Bosnian conflict 
cannot be resolved by means of force," said Viktor Ustinov, 
chairman of the State Duma Committee for Issues of Geopolitics. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS Ustinov expressed concern 
over 
the notorious ultimatum made by NATO countries, saying that the 
use of force against Bosnian Serbs cannot bring military 
operations in former Yugoslavia to an end. "There is a threat 
that air-strikes on Serbian positions around Sarajevo might be 
followed by intervention of NATO troops into Bosnia," Ustinov 
said. 
  Ustinov believes that in order to prevent the conflict from 
being raised to a higher level of confrontation all 
peace-keeping forces should be withdrawn from Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and "former Yugoslavia should be given a chance to 
resolve its problems itself." 
  According to Ustinov, the Duma Committee for Issues of 
Geopolitics is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss the 
Balkan crisis.

  [Text] Parliamentary hearings on the possibility of an 
escalation in the conflict on the territory of former Yugoslavia 
were held in the State Duma on Tuesday. Our correspondent 
Yevgeniy Zherebenkov reports: 
  [Zherebenkov] This is not the first time the State Duma has 
turned its attention to the Yugoslav problem. Hearings on the 
situation in former Yugoslavia have already been held by the 
committee on international affairs. One of the Duma's first 
documents was a resolution on ways of settling the Yugoslav 
conflict. But the latest hearings, held by the Liberal 
Democrat-dominated committee on geopolitical issues, have not 
really heard any fundamentally new proposals. Deputies again 
demanded that the president use his right of veto in the UN 
Security Council against NATO's decision on air strikes in 
Yugoslavia. They also want him to tackle the question of 
lifting Russia's economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
  Vladimir Ivanovskiy, a Foreign Ministry representative, 
assured the deputies that Russia would do all it could to 
prevent an escalation of the conflict. Here is what he said to 
me in an interview: 
  [Begin Ivanovskiy recording] I arrived at the hearings 
straight from consultations at the Foreign Ministry with British 
Foreign Office officials. As you know, Major is here at the 
moment. Yugoslav problems will be one of the central topics at 
the talks. We are doing everything we can, working with the 
different sides. I said that the president's special 
representative had spent almost the whole of Saturday night in 
talks with Milosevic. It is also envisaged that our president 
will have further contacts with the presidents of the leading 
countries, those that are playing an active part in the 
settlement process. The minister is in constant contact with 
them. So everything possible is being done to avert the worst. 
There is only one method available to us -- talks and 
clarification of positions, the search for a joint solution.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy </F>
Sobchak by Nils Morten Udgaard in Oslo; date not given] 
  [Text] "Russia's officers who supported Zhirinovskiy are 
now being given free land -- to dampen down discontent," the St. 
Petersburg mayor said. 
  Anatoliy Sobchak warned the West against believing in a 
Russia where reforms are at an end and where the nationalists 
hold power when he met the press in Oslo City Hall as one of the 
heavyweight figures in Russian political life. "Before I travel 
home on Monday I am going for a medal for the Russian team, 
because 60 percent of them come from the St. Petersburg area." 
He is patriotic on behalf of the 5 million people in the 
metropolis that was long called Leningrad. 
  "The fact that half the officers and soldiers voted for 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy the nationalist is a protest with a 
nonpolitical content directed against the conditions facing the 
soldiers who are being brought home from abroad. Often they 
have nowhere for themselves and their families to live; some of 
them have to move into tents out on the plains. These are 
people who in other countries have been used to good living 
conditions and some of their wages in hard currency. The 
important thing now is to get them good homes, also with help 
from the West. They must also be guaranteed civilian jobs, and 
here the authorities have set in motion a rapid program for the 
handing out of free land to officers and soldiers, and this is 
helping," Sobchak told AFTENPOSTEN. 
  "The important thing that has happened in Russia -- as 
important as the revolution in 1917 -- is that in the elections 
in December we also adopted a new democratic constitution. This 
put a final end to the Soviet era; for the first time a Russian 
constitution contains guarantees of fundamental human rights. 
This -- and the fact that we had elections that were fought 
between several parties -- means more than Zhirinovskiy, whom 
the media in the West have blown up out of all proportion," he 
said. 
  [Udgaard] But economic policy has been changed. The IMF is 
skeptical. 
  "It has not been right to give loans from abroad to the 
government. It has not succeeded in using this money in a 
sensible way. Loans from abroad must be given directly to 
enterprises, to those who can increase production and earn money 
again quickly," Sobchak said. 
  Now Norway's Kvaerner and a group of firms in St. Petersburg 
-- former military enterprises which today are looking for a new 
role -- are to come together to build a new installation for 
waste treatment in St. Petersburg, he said after a meeting with 
the Kvaerner management. He is prioritizing closer ties with 
neighboring regions in the Nordic area, and said with manifest 
pride that the borders are now so open that in 1993 for the 
first time there were more Russians who visited Finland than 
there were Finns who crossed the border in the opposite 
direction. 
  This week Sobchak, along with his counterpart from Moscow, 
has been taking part in Oslo local council's conference on 
industry and commerce and he is hoping for more economic 
contacts. 
  "I have met with Mayor Ann-Marit Saebones and we will try to 
bring the exhibition of Edvard Munch's portraits over to St. 
Petersburg. We ourselves want to send works from the Hermitage, 
the czar's magnificent art collection, and from the Russian 
Museum to Oslo," Sobchak said. 
  Sobchak's stay in Oslo will last almost a week, with a 
detour 
to Lillehammer. But it is in fact NATO's supreme commander at 
Kolsas, British General Sir Garry Johnson, who has brought him 
to Norway -- and into the mountain where the alliance sits on 
its secrets. Not many Russians have been there as yet, as far 
as we know. Sobchak has taken part in the "closed" conference, 
Viking Review, and spoken on the subject of collective security 
in northwestern Russia and the Baltic Sea region.

  [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine's nuclear power industry is on the 
verge of stopping. Nuclear fuel stocks at nuclear power plants 
are running out while fresh supplies from Russia have been 
stopped as of the beginning of this year. The TVEL concern, 
Russia's sole producer of nuclear power fuel, cites the ban by 
the State Committee for Supervision over the Safety of Work in 
Industry and Atomic Power Engineering [Gosatomnadzor]. The 
latter for its part points to the expiration at the end of last 
year of a corresponding interstate Russian-Ukrainian agreement. 
The problem has grown from purely economic into a political 
one. 
  The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed its 
Ukrainian colleagues that deliveries of nuclear fuel may be 
resumed only if Ukraine accedes to the nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty. The Kiev leadership has asked Chernomyrdin to lift 
restrictions on nuclear fuel deliveries from Russia. It is 
hardly accidental that the conflict has flared up during the 
Russian-Ukrainian negotiations on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament 
in Kiev. It seems that the Russian side decided to play a trump 
which can effectively shut down Ukraine's nuclear power industry.

  [Text] Moscow -- According to information from competent 
sources, the chiefs of major commercial enterprises are worried 
over stubborn rumors about Russian Federation President Boris 
Yeltsin's being very seriously ill. According to information 
allegedly received from people around the president, Boris 
Yeltsin has a serious pneumonia, which called for hemodialysis 
[gemodializ], rather than a slight cold as the president's press 
service maintains. According to experts, these rumors were 
provoked by U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement about a 
"technical impossibility" of contacting the Russian Federation 
president.

  [Text] A delegation from the Republic of Armenia, led by 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan, the country's president, arrived in Tbilisi 
today, 14 February, for an official one-day visit. 
  The delegation included Deputy Prime Ministers Gagik 
Martirosyan and Gagik Shakhbazyan, Transport Minister Henrik 
Kochinyan, Davit Shakhnazarian, the chairman of the National 
Security Department, the head of the president's office, Shagen 
(Kara-Muntyan), and other government officials. 
  Levon Ter-Petrosyan and the other guests were given a hearty 
welcome at Tbilisi airport by Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman 
of the Georgian Supreme Council and head of state, Prime 
Minister Otar Patsatsia, the chief of the head of state's 
office, Vazha Lordkipanidze, and other officials. 
  A face-to-face meeting between Eduard Shevardnadze and Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan lasted for almost one and a half hours. 
  At the same time, Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia and 
officials 
from the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Georgia 
discussed with the other guests a number of economic issues that 
are pressing for the two countries. 
  After this, the full delegation was received by Eduard 
Shevardnadze. 
  The head of state told members of the Armenian delegation 
that a good tradition had developed. We are meeting each other 
to examine problems facing us and, for me, every such meeting is 
a step forward toward achieving objectives that have been set, 
and toward strengthening traditional friendly ties between our 
two neighboring countries and peoples. 
  Mr. Levon Ter-Petrosyan thanked the Georgian leader for 
allowing this visit to be organized at short notice. The 
Armenian president said that apart from personal relations that 
are playing a productive role, an effective mechanism for 
interstate relations had been created. Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
announced that during the face-to-face meeting with Eduard 
Shevardnadze, they examined issues relating to economic 
cooperation problems and aspects of regional conflicts. It was 
stated that both countries supported the implementation of an 
idea of Caucasian dialogue and a meeting between the leaders of 
the Transcaucasian states with the participation of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
  The talks discussed problems relating to the organization of 
the delivery to Armenia of bread products and fuel, in 
particular, gas. The sides agreed that grain intended for the 
people of Armenia would be delivered to them as soon as possible 
by rail from the seaports of Batumi and Poti. Special 
interstate treaties would be very important to speed up this 
process. In this connection, it was admitted that agreements 
reached at the level of broker firms and organizations were 
often not very effective and could even delay the process of 
delivery. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze supported taking quick measures to 
establish unhindered work of the railway and other transport, on 
which the situation in neighboring countries depends to a large 
extent. He also addressed other problems, stressing the 
importance of a (?common) approach by the two country's official 
leadership toward solving regional problems. 
  Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, Jaba Ioseliani, the chairman 
of the Provisional Committee for the State of Emergency, Zurab 
Kervalishvili, the first deputy prime minister, Security 
Minister Igor Giorgadze, the chief of the head of state's 
office, Vazha Lordkipanidze, the chief of the Customs 
Department, Viktor Lordkipanidze, and the chief of the head of 
state's Information Bureau, Ramaz Sakvarelidze, took part in the 
talks. 
  The sides signed a protocol on the implementation of the 
accords reached during the talks. 
  On the same day, the delegation from the Republic of Armenia 
returned to Yerevan.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Ivan Ivanov and Gennadi </F>
Talalayev] 
  [Text] Moscow, February 15 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and British Prime Minister John Major have met for 
one-to-one talks in the Green Hall of the grand Kremlin Palace. 
  Welcoming the British prime minister Boris Yeltsin said: "We 
have met more than once and know each other well. This is why I 
am confident that our talks will be held in an atmosphere of 
mutual understanding and success". 
  The two leaders are expected to sum up the results of 
cooperation between the two countries in recent years, which, 
according to Russian diplomats, have developed without any 
serious problems. The summit talks will certainly center around 
further strengthening of the legal and treaty basis of bilateral 
relations. 
  According to Russian diplomats, Boris Yeltsin and John Major 
will also focus on the situation in Europe and its security 
system, relations between Russia and the group of seven 
countries and the latter's gradual transformation into a group 
of eight. 
  The conflict in the former Yugoslavia and the situation in 
Bosnia is also likely to feature prominently during the talks, 
as well as steps that Russia and Britain can take within the 
U.N. Security Council and the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ardy Stoutjesdijk, Netherlands World Bank </F>
director in Moscow, by Wierd Duk, in Moscow; date not given: 
"`The Money Is Going to the Wrong People'-- Netherlands World 
Bank Director In Moscow Fears A Catastrophe"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Ardy Stoutjesdijk, age 55, a 
Rotterdammer in Russia, is the director of the World Bank's 
Moscow office. How does he think the stumbling Russian economy 
will fare? 
  "It is not the best time to ask that question," Stoutjesdijk 
said. "The new Chernomyrdin Government has only just been 
formed. But given the way things are developing, the following 
scenario is feasible: A catastrophe will take place in three to 
six months. Then the last reformers will resign and the 
government will have to completely reverse its policies, or an 
entirely new team will replace it." Perhaps they would again be 
reformers, Stoutjesdijk added, but he did not exclude the 
possibility that the ultra- nationalist and communist opposition 
would then strike. 
  Stoutjesdijk came to Moscow two years ago from Washington. 
"And it is only now that all the logistical problems have been 
solved," he said. "At last we are in a good building." He 
pointed to his desk. "Normally these telephones should work." 
The World Bank has sixty offices in lender countries, according 
to the economist who left the Netherlands in 1964. "And Moscow 
is one of the biggest," he added. 
  [Duk] Should Russia carry out more or less economic reforms? 
  [Stoutjesdijk] There were a number of positive developments 
in 1993, like price liberalization, privatization and the 
budgetary policies which were strengthened considerably under 
Fedorov. This has led to a significant drop in inflation. The 
rouble's exchange rate has been stable for a long time. 
  But some things did not happen and that is very bad. It is 
very negative that agricultural reforms failed to occur. They 
started privatization very late in this sector. The agriculture 
sector is completed dominated by large state companies with a 
generally reactionary sort of management. [passage omitted] 
  [Duk] Can the reforms be delayed, as Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin is now suggesting? 
  [Stoutjesdijk] The number of options is far more limited 
than 
generally assumed. The priority remains the inflation problem, 
which is causing a flight of capital, lack of investment and 
loss in purchasing power. The poor are now able to pay for just 
their food and nothing more. Inflation must be curbed, and 
therefore in any event the government budget must be limited. 
Especially in a country where so much money goes to the defense 
industry and industries which are linked to defense, to people 
employed by the government or in subsidies to other industries. 
Views such as Chernomyrdin's, that the reforms can be "slowed 
down," are only understandable if people like him really believe 
that another way is possible. Perhaps they think that, but 
often they have not been educated in macro-economics. 
  [Duk] The conditions set by the IMF and the World Bank are 
criticized because they impose an excessive social and political 
toll. There will be massive unemployment if inflation is 
tackled hard, subsidies and cheap credit are stopped and 
unprofitable companies go bankrupt. That can cause social 
unrest and play into the hands of extremist politicians like 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  [Stoutjesdijk] Our advice is based on experience in a large 
number of countries. There is practically no economic subject 
where we have not reached agreement with the reformers in 
Russia. They even use the IMF and World Bank as an argument in 
cabinet meetings. 
  Far-reaching reforms and fighting inflation are indeed 
unthinkable without increased unemployment. [passage omitted] 
  [Duk] Are those people [the wrong people receiving money] in 
or close to the Russian Government? 
  [Stoutjesdijk] I would be particularly pleased to know who 
is 
getting that money. 
  [Duk] Tell that story to the average Russian voter and he 
will immediately vote for far-reaching reforms. 
  [Stoutjesdijk] That is also my criticism of the reformers. 
They have not sold their policies to the people well. Perhaps 
their approach is painful in the short term, but in the long 
term a majority will benefit. 
  But I must also acknowledge that the sort of advice given to 
the Russian Government, and the attitudes of the actual 
reformers, are strongly influenced by the U.S. model. An 
orientation to Western Europe could have already reduced the 
hardest consequences of the reforms. But social security has to 
be financed and we must not forget that foreign aid has been far 
less than promised. The aid is mainly provided in the form of 
debt rescheduling. 
  To return to the criticism that the IMF's and World Bank's 
conditions are exacting too high a toll: As yet there is no 
prospect of measures which would lead to a large increase in 
unemployment. In fact, we are even seeing that Russian 
production is to be protected, that import tariffs will increase 
and there even seems to be talk of possible price controls. In 
brief: There is a real possibility that in a few months we will 
have a situation here which is just as catastrophic as that in 
Ukraine or Romania. Perhaps this government will then see that 
tough measures are necessary and perhaps the Russian people will 
accept these measures if they are taken by former communist 
managers like Chernomyrdin. These policies are not accepted from 
an academic like Gaydar. 
  [Duk] Anatoliy Chubays, the liberal privatization minister, 
has stayed on. How important is that? 
  [Stoutjesdijk] Privatization policies are crucial. At 
present between 70 and 80 percent of small enterprises have been 
privatized. Now the privatization of medium-sized enterprises 
with less than 25,000 employees is taking place. That is 
happening very quickly. Every month between 2 and 3,000 
companies are privatized. 
  The dinosaurs of 25,000 employees and over are a problem. 
They are all in a terrible state and as such can scarcely be 
privatized. Sometimes whole communities have been built up round 
such companies. If you close the company, then you close the 
community. These companies will have to continue to be 
supported in the future. You cannot leave that to the market, 
but you can say to their managers: In the coming years look to 
see what can be saved from such a company. 
  [Duk] What would the World Bank do if Russian policies 
changed significantly? 
  [Stoutjesdijk] If we see that things are becoming disastrous 
here, then we will have to modify our lending policies. Should 
there be an arrears in repayments, then we would stop. Look, of 
course we understand too that all policies must have a basis in 
society. For example there was a big conflict between reformers 
and the old conservative parliament on the desirability of loans 
and setting up the privatization program, but here I am with the 
hard fact that I have $2.5 billion available for various 
projects, including $500 million for reorganizing agriculture. 
Whether and how this is to be used depends on the political 
will in Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, Zhirinovskiy's close </F>
associate, by Wierd Duk in Moscow; date not given: "The Army Is 
on our Side"] 
  [Excerpts] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is the civilized world's 
terror. We do know him. But who are the people who surround 
Zhirinovskiy in the Duma? What are the views the "liberal- 
democratic" representatives are defending or opposing in this 
chaotic Russian Lower House? 
  Their top man is Aleksandr Vengerovskiy (40). He is the 
runner-up, the "shadow prime minister" of the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP). Last week, he was elected vice-chairman of the 
Duma. [passage omitted] 
  [Duk] Your political leader is not afraid of uttering 
nuclear 
threats. 
  [Vengerovskiy] You should not think that we are devising 
plans in this office to drop nuclear bombs over the United 
States or Germany. Russia never attacked or occupied any other 
countries. The nations always appealed to us for protection. 
  [Duk] Then how should we interpret Zhirinovskiy's statements 
on a "new Hiroshima?" 
  [Vengerovskiy] Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy is our 
leader, 
and he is responsible for his words. However, I stick to our 
party program, which does not refer to any "Hiroshimas." 
  As far as international politics are concerned: We are no 
government party, so our influence will be limited. However, we 
will exert as much pressure as possible in Parliament through 
the committees. Russia must resume its historic role as 
defender of Europe. At the time, the Mongolian-Tatar hordes had 
to be stopped, at present it is Muslim fundamentalism. Just 
imagine what might happen if Russia would disintegrate and leave 
a vacuum here. 
  [Duk] Your ideology is described as being "fascist." 
  [Vengerovskiy] This is typically Russian rhetoric. Former 
communists who now claim to be democrats, refer to us, liberals, 
as being fascists. This is nonsense, we are a normal, liberal 
party which takes up a center position. Which means: Between 
the revanchist communists who refuse to abandon the planned 
economy, and the radicals of Russia's Choice, who have disrupted 
our national economy and the entire society. We are opting for 
a "third way," we are the only ones who can carry out this 
program, because our society's elite has teamed up within the 
LDP. 
  [Duk] What does this program look like? 
  [Vengerovskiy] Our first important proposal is a general 
amnesty for political and economic crimes committed since the 
early days of Perestroika. We must forgive and forget, the 
capitals which have flowed abroad, must return to Russia. As 
far as we are concerned, this amnesty also applies to the mob, 
as long as their hands are clean. 
  We are in favor of protecting our national economy, and 
against the shock therapy as proposed by the IMF. At present, 
Russia is a dump for low-quality products from the rest of the 
world, and at the same time a cheap market for natural resources 
and beautiful girls. This is wrong. The LDP advocates 
progressive reforms, and opposes a government which harms our 
national interests, destroys the state sector, and makes our 
country an extension of the United States. We are in favor of 
privatization, but in the interest of the citizens, not in that 
of the mob. The financial support to former Soviet Republics 
must be stopped. All former Politburo members are now president 
somewhere: Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Shevardnadze, etc. Yeltsin is 
helping his comrades at the Russian people's expense. In the 
meantime, the world is supporting the former communists, and we 
are being branded as fascists. Does that make any sense to you? 
  [Duk] Will Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy become Russian 
president in 1996? 
  [Vengerovskiy] There is not the slightest doubt in my mind. 
He might even become president much sooner. The parliamentary 
elections have shown that Snickers and cornflakes failed to 
achieve their main objective. The Russian people has not lost 
its own identity. Now is the time for new faces, for young, 
physically strong people. These people can be found within the 
LDP: Experts who speak several languages, who have been abroad, 
and who are not afraid of communicating with the West. We are 
the new political and cultural factor in Russia. A man like 
Gaydar has thriven on his grandfather's name (a popular writer 
of children's books, ed.). We made ourselves, we had to fight 
for our success. Every day, I am sitting in the subway among 
common people, and I know their worries. The present leaders 
have no idea, and never had any idea. That is why they will 
always lose. 
  [Duk] Do you anticipate a recurrence of the October events? 
  [Vengerovskiy] There will be no second "October." Indeed, 
Zhirinovskiy has massive support from the army. So this 
scenario is out of the question.

  [Text] Moscow, February 7, RIA -- The press centre of the 
Russian Navy issued a statement today. The statement says that 
recent articles have been putting a wrong and incompetent 
interpretation on the retirement of some air-capable cruisers 
from the Russian Navy. The point is that early in the 90s these 
ships have served their time and required repairs. But repair 
facilities being the property of Ukraine, placement of orders 
became impossible. Creation of specialised facilities by Russia 
would have taken much time and money. 
  In view of these factors it was decided to retire the first- 
generation cruisers Minsk and Novorossiisk in the Pacific Fleet 
and the Kiev in the Northern Fleet. 
  At the same time, the press service indicates, an 
air-capable 
cruiser of the next generation, Admiral Kuznetsov, as well as 
its aircraft, is being put through its paces.

  [Text] Moscow, February 11, RIA -- The solution of the 
problem of non-payments depends in many respects not on the 
government but on the readiness of representatives of the 
Directors' Corps to come to an agreement among themselves. This 
was stated at an enlarged collegium of the Ministry of Fuel and 
Energy of the Russian Federation by first Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets. "The miners deliver coal to metallurgists who give 
metal for cars which are now in great demand. If the directors 
come to an agreement among themselves, it will be possible to 
pay the debts both to the metallurgists and miners after selling 
these cars." Such is the opinion of the vice premier. 
  He said that this year nobody would forgive debts to 
anybody. 
However, "there is no going away from this problem any longer," 
said Soskovets and added that "it is useless to harbour 
illusions that somebody will come and do everything for the 
directors of enterprises." 
  As an example of the non-balanced work of the Directors' 
Corps Soskovets adduced the fact of purchasing 700,000 tons of 
pipes in Japan, Italy and Austria, while the Russian 
pipe-producing plants had to cut their output last year.

  [Text] Moscow, February 2, RIA -- The Council of the 
Federation which is discussing the articles in the chamber's 
regulations dealing with the general procedure of the work and 
the rules in considering the laws adopted by the State Duma has 
declined the amendments of the president of the Russian 
Federation concerning the adoption of decisions by the Council 
of the Federation. 
  In his letter to both chambers of the Federal Assembly Boris 
Yeltsin proposed that in adopting decisions they should proceed 
from the total number of the deputies provided for by the 
Constitution of the Russian Federation -- 178 for the Council of 
the Federation and 450 for the State Duma, not from the number 
of the actually elected members of the two chambers which is 
somewhat smaller than that named in the fundamental law. 
  By declining the presidential amendments, the Council of the 
Federation has created a precedent for the State Duma whose 
chairman Ivan Rybkin was elected by a majority of one vote from 
the number of actually elected deputies to the lower chamber 
(223 from 444), not from the number of the deputies which should 
be elected under the Constitution.

<F P=106> [Report by RIA special correspondent Lev Aksenov] </F>
  [Text] St. Petersburg, February 7, RIA - "The 
Inter-Parliamentary Assembly has prepared many documents, 
especially on constitutional problems. I do not think this was 
a wasted effort, rather we now have here real capital to work 
with," St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak said. 
  In an interview with RIA, in the run-up to a session of the 
CIS Inter-Parliamentary Assembly Council which opens tomorrow, 
Sobchak noted that forum participants are to tackle many new 
issues in view of an altered political situation. 
  In particular, he noted, it is necessary to elect a new 
chairman of the council. 
  In his view, a representative of Russia could fill this 
post, 
for example, Vladimir Shumeyko, the chairman of the Federation 
Council of the Federal Assembly. 
  Speaking of the situation in the CIS, Sobchak praised the 
work of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, which, according to 
him, "promoted integration processes" in the Commonwealth. 
  The very fact that its headquarters is in this city, 
continued the mayor, "will make it a focus of attraction for all 
CIS member-countries". 
  Sobchak stressed the need to step up integration processes 
in 
the CIS, above all in the economic area. 
  Citing the Russian president's recent visit to Georgia, the 
mayor pointed out that it became apparent there "where a civil 
war can bring a country". [sentence as received] 
  "Realisation that by disrupting economic links we did 
tremendous damage to each other is helping us to take past 
mistakes into account". 
  "If," he went on, "we want to get out of the crisis 
together, 
the best thing is to do it jointly. 
  "Today, in view of the depth of crisis in some CIS 
countries, 
even Russia finds it simply unprofitable economically to make 
agreements without protecting its rouble and its interests".

  [Text] Kazan, February 7, RIA -- "One should be a 
pragmatist and realist and see what is in actual fact and not 
what one wishes," Tatar President Mintimer Shaymiyev said at the 
19th session of Tatarstan's Parliament today. "It's such an 
approach that we're guided by in building relations between 
Tatarstan and the Russian Federation." 
  Mr. Shaymiyev said problems of Tatar-Russian relations are 
central to the republic's political life. He stressed that the 
treaty on delimiting the subjects of supervision and mutual 
delegation of powers by Tatar and Russia state power bodies is 
based on the coordination on the two constitutions and 
unconditional respect for human rights, irrespective of 
nationality, sex, and religion. 
  "...an absolutely new, hitherto unknown in practice document 
is coming into being," pointed out Mr. Shaymiyev. "It 
highlights the competence of Russian and Tatar state power 
bodies and will evidence Russia's reformation and renewal on 
democratic principles and become a guarantor of Tatarstan's 
statehood." 
  Touching upon his January meeting with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, Mr. Shaymiyev said the sides agreed on the 
completion of preparations of other intergovernmental agreement 
concerning foreign economic activity, the combating of crime, as 
well as budgetary, taxation, military, and banking problems.

  [Text] Kazan, February 5, RIA -- "The Communists of the 
Republic of Tatarstan have taken a decision to take part in the 
spring elections to the State Duma of the Russian Federation," 
the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tatarstan 
Aleksandr Saliy said in a RIA interview. 
  Previously, obedient to Saliy's call to boycott the last 
December 12 elections and the national referendum on Russia's 
new Constitution, his supporters did not go to the polls. Now 
the neo- Bolsheviks have however changed their attitude toward 
elections. According to the leader of Tatar communists, Russia's 
political course may only be influenced and the status of 
Tatarstan may be determined with the help of the State Duma. 
  Saliy told the press that the activists of his party will 
run 
for the elections in each of the five one-mandate constituencies 
located on the territory of Tatarstan, where the December 12 
elections were not held.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Ukrainian President Leonid </F>
Kravchuk by Chrystia Freeland on 10 February; place not given] 
  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was delivering 
an impassioned warning about the consequences of a war between 
his country and Russia when an aide interrupted him: "Chancellor 
Kohl is on the telephone, Mr President." Mr Kravchuk wrapped up 
his sentence with the words "nuclear nightmare", shook his 
lacquered white helmet of hair and was gone. 
  A telephone call from the German chancellor is one sign of 
the international attention being paid to Ukraine. Another is 
Mr Kravchuk's forthcoming visit to the US, which has been moved 
forward from March 16 to March 3. 
  Ukraine is in the spotlight because various factors -- 
resurgent nationalism in Russia, last month's victory for 
Russian separatists in Ukraine's breakaway Crimean peninsular, 
and economic collapse -- have converged over the past few weeks. 
Many observers, from the CIA to Britain's Royal United Services 
Institute, a defence think- tank, have come to a worrying 
consensus that "a probable conflict" is looming between Ukraine 
and Russia. 
  Mr Kravchuk, the first democratically elected president in 
the 1,000-year history of this nation of 53 million, makes clear 
that the effects of war would be widespread. "Remember that 
Ukraine still has 176 nuclear missiles and that Russia has three 
times as many," he told the Financial Times yesterday. "Let no 
one imagine that if a war were to explode between two such 
countries, he could be somehow immune to the nuclear poison that 
would be released." 
  For Ukraine, keeping the peace with Russia is a particularly 
tricky balancing act. On one hand, as Mr Kravchuk repeats again 
and again, Ukraine is eager to have "good neighbourly relations 
with Russia", which is, after all, its single biggest trading 
partner. On the other hand, he is equally emphatic that Ukraine 
will not surrender a single inch of sovereignty. 
  "I repeat again what I have from the very beginning: I will 
never take a single step in the direction of reducing Ukrainian 
independence. I will never change my position on this issue," 
Mr Kravchuk insisted in the cultivated Ukrainian which he 
pointedly speaks at all public appearances. 
  This deep-seated commitment to independence, which is shared 
even by the Russified and Russian-speaking members of the 
Ukrainian elite, is why Mr Kravchuk rejects the steps 
neighbouring Belarus has taken to ensure friendly relations with 
Russia -- rejoining the rouble zone and re-entering Russia's 
foreign policy sphere of influence. 
  Although Ukraine's inflation rate of 80 per cent in December 
gives some indication of how rocky Kiev's road to independence 
has been, Mr Kravchuk is adamant that the Belarussian route "is 
not a resolution of the problem. It is just a return of the old 
ways." Worryingly, economic chaos is prompting a similar desire 
for reintegration with Russia in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. 
  Walking the tightrope between friendly relations and 
reabsorption is a task to which the wily Mr Kravchuk is perhaps 
particularly well suited. Since 1991, when he underwent a 
conversion from communist ideologue to nationalist leader, Mr 
Kravchuk has won a certain notoriety as a man who has elevated 
vacillation into a political philosophy. 
  Now the politician who prides himself on his ranking as a 
chess Grand Master believes he has discovered a move which will 
help Ukraine maintain its precarious geopolitical balance -- a 
strong relationship with the west. Mr Kravchuk's opening gambit 
came last month when he signed a historic tripartite agreement 
with the US and Russia, under which Ukraine pledged to give up 
all its nuclear weapons. He succeeded in an even more difficult 
move last week, when he persuaded Ukrainian parliamentarians 
many of whom greeted the initial agreement with cries of treason 
and calls for impeachment -- to remove obstacles to ratification 
of the accord. 
  Mr Kravchuk and US diplomats in Kiev, who are effusive in 
their praise of the president's "remarkable political skills," 
say the nuclear issue is decided. They believe Ukraine will 
surrender all its nuclear weapons and Mr Kravchuk himself thinks 
it is just a matter of time -- perhaps later this month -- 
before the Ukrainian parliament joins the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  But the president has not orchestrated this newly amenable 
stance on the nuclear issue without expecting something in 
return. In addition to upwards of $1bn, which Ukraine is slated 
to receive from a company sponsored by the US government for the 
enriched uranium in its nuclear warheads, Mr Kravchuk is also 
counting on massive western assistance for the economic reforms 
he believes are crucial. 
  "We have no alternative but the market," he says with the 
zeal of a convert. "Without economic reforms Ukraine as a state 
will not survive." 
  Heart-warming words, but when asked to name a target monthly 
inflation rate for December 1994, Mr Kravchuk says he would be 
happy with 50 per cent. While this would be an improvement over 
December's figure, it is hardly likely to be what the 
International Monetary Fund team, due to arrive in Kiev on 
Sunday, has in mind. 
  Just as he hopes to find a narrow middle road in his 
relations with Russia, Mr Kravchuk is searching for a path 
towards economic therapy without the shock. He says the 
Ukrainian National Bank cannot stop printing money because "that 
would stop the entire economy", yet he wants to stabilise the 
currency, the Ukrainian coupon, and speaks of introducing a 
harder national currency this year. 
  To bridge the gap between the market reforms that he would 
like to get under way and the social stability he is intent on 
maintaining, he is counting on hefty aid from the west. "We 
will need a stabilising fund of between $3bn and $4bn to 
introduce our new currency," he says. 
  Mr Roman Shpek, the young, urbane minister of the economy 
charged with conducting negotiations with the IMF, said Ukraine 
would like a "bridge loan" of $300m from the US, a $700m 
"systemic transformation loan" from the IMF, and $400m for 
sectoral reform from the World Bank. 
  In future conversations with the German chancellor, and when 
he visits Washington, Mr Kravchuk will perhaps try to explain 
that a few billion dollars are a small price to pay if the 
alternative is war between Ukraine and Russia. But if he fails 
to persuade the west to give him money, as Russia's experience 
suggests he might, it is hard to imagine what sort of gambit Mr 
Kravchuk could devise next to preserve his country's 
independence.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Armenian President Levon </F>
Ter-Petrosyan by Annika Savill in London on 10 February] 
  [Text] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan concedes that neither 
side in the six-year war over Nagorno-Karabakh -- the bloodiest 
conflict in the former Soviet Union -- is prepared to compromise 
at all to achieve a settlement. But, the Armenian leader added 
yesterday on a visit to London, the only scenario which could 
lead to an all-out war between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be 
if the people of the enclave faced the threat of genocide. 
  Mr Ter-Petrosyan was told by John Major during his official 
visit that Britain wanted to help end the war, in which more 
than 15,000 people have died and more than a million have become 
refugees. The enclave of 100,000 Christian Armenians inside 
mainly Muslim Azerbaijan initially wanted to join neighbouring 
Armenia, but it is now fighting for independence. 
  "The ideal would be a solution to satisfy the population of 
Nagorno-Karabakh," Mr Ter-Petrosyan said. "Under this ideal 
lies the principle of self-determination." 
  "In terms of reality, the only real solution could be one 
based on compromise," he added. "If we are basing things on 
today's psychology, neither the Armenians nor the Azeris are 
prepared to give anything away. That is today's psychology and 
both parties are not ready." 
  He said "any talk of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh only 
makes it more difficult". The Conference on Security and 
Co-operation in Europe, he noted, had accepted "this 
methodology" in its mediation efforts. "The CSCE does not refer 
at all to the status of Nagorno-Karabakh," he said, only to the 
"first aim of a ceasefire and a withdrawal of occupying forces". 
  The President has enjoyed a statesman's treatment during his 
four-day visit. He has been received in audience by the Queen, 
held more than two hours of talks with the Prime Minister and 
laid a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. 
  Mr Ter-Petrosyan was content with assurances from the 
Foreign 
Office that it had no knowledge of a reported scheme by British 
businessmen to try to send mercenaries to Azerbaijan via 
northern Cyprus. "We are satisfied with the answer, so 
satisfied I did not raise it in my meeting with John Major," he 
said. 
  A mixture of erudition and rugged charisma, Mr Ter-Petrosyan 
chainsmokes red Rothmans for breakfast. Born in Aleppo, Syria, 
49 years ago, he has a PhD in Armenian-Assyrian literature of 
the 4th and 5th centuries. He understands but does not speak 
English, except to say "May I smoke?" A founding member of the 
Armenian Karabakh Committe in 1988 -- which saw the start of the 
war -- he has been president since Armenia's independence in 
1991.

  [Text] London ("AZG" daily), 11/02/94--"The war which is 
now carried between the Mountainous Karabakh and Azerbaijan may 
possibly grow soon into a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, 
the president of the Republic of Armenia declared today during 
the meeting with journalists in the Carlton hotel of London. 
This was probably the first time when the RA [Republic of 
Armenia] president officially declared that Armenia will 
interfere with the Karabakh conflict if a danger of genocide or 
moving the population of Karabakh appears. In this case, Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan stressed, Armenia will participate in the conflict 
no regard who will be in power by that time. This will depend 
on the will of the people. Our people will not allow a new 
genocide", the president noted.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR" daily), 03/02/94 -- Azerbaijan 
continues the military operations in spite of its recent 
failures at the fronts. According to the press service of RMK 
[Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] Defense Army, yesterday in 
the morning Azeri troops restarted the offensive in the 
direction to the east from Martuninskiy regional center. Azeri 
formations tried to break the Armenian defense lines but had to 
retreat to the initial positions after Karabakh forces 
retaliated. 
  The battles were also continuing in northern direction. The 
enemy tried change the situation at the north of Kelbadzharskiy 
district. Its goal was most probably to provide aid to the 
surrounded formations near the Omar gorge. According to the 
latest verified information this surrounded formations involves 
more than 3,000 soldiers. Armenian formations stopped the 
attempts of the enemy. Information about losses is being 
verified. 
  Meanwhile "SNARK" news agency reports, that American and 
Turkish councillors were sent to Hadzhikabul military bases 
which is in 80 km. from Baku. The councillors are teaching 
about 6 thousands of Azeri Army which were especially chosen for 
this training. 
  According to a western politician, 25 resigned American 
officers are working now in Azerbaijan paid by the American 
"Mega Oil" corporation. Training of Azeri army is costing "Mega 
Oil" some 10- 15 mln. dollars and is a part of the contract 
signed last year with Azeri official bodies. 
  Russian councillors are training about 400 Azeris in Ganja. 
Recently some 500 Russian specialists arrived to the military 
base Goran, near Ganja. Many people in Azerbaijan believe, that 
Americans are training personal guards of the President Aliyev, 
while Russians are teaching the supporters of Prime Minister 
Guseynov. "ASSOCIATED PRESS" reports increasing contradictions 
between these two.

  [Text] Yerevan, 12/02/94 ("RESPUBLICA ARMENIA" daily--NOYAN 
TAPAN)--During the press conference on February 8 the Ambassador 
of the USA in Armenia Harry Gilmore was questioned whether the 
presence of 23 Turkish builders in the U.S. Embassy is 
appropriate to the current conditions. 
  The Ambassador replied: "According to the decision of the 
U.S. State Department the reconstruction of all U.S. embassies 
in the territory of the former USSR is done by the engineering 
department of the U.S. Army. The main office of this agency in 
the region is in Ankara. This office is collaborating with a 
number of private Turkish companies and when the reconstruction 
of the American Embassy in Yerevan started, the American side 
invited the experienced Turkish building specialists. Currently 
about 20 Turkish builders are working at the embassy. I 
personally made quite a lot of efforts for the Turkish 
specialists to come to Armenia since I thought this would be a 
sort of Armenian-Turkish collaboration on the individual level". 
The ambassador also reported that he is trying to use the 
Armenian builders as much as possible in the reconstruction, and 
to use Armenian materials when possible. "I would like to 
especially stress that Armenian builders are very experienced 
and I saw myself the Turkish-Armenian collaboration", Harry 
Gilmore added.

  [Text] Yerevan ("GOLOS ARMENII" daily), 10/02/94 -- We 
learnt recently some details of Ashot Manucharyan's meetings 
with the representatives of parliamentary fractions. 
  Particularly, the former adviser of the president reported 
that the directors of profitable enterprises (cognac and jewelry 
factories etc.) are being assigned by V. Siradegyan. During an 
entertainment trip of Vano Siradegyan to Paris a Moscow Armenian 
accompanying him spent 200,000 dollars. The Ministry of the 
Interior has not only organized the attempt of Serzh Jilavyan's 
murder but was also suppressing the opposition parties. 
Siradegyan established complete control over the sphere of 
economy. Four leaders are illegally living in the governmental 
summer residence and they are taking governmental decisions 
during the parties. Police officials are spending their summer 
holidays in United Arab Emirates. More than 10 KGB agents are 
involved in the current government. A report including all 
names and details regarding the export of copper from the 
republic has been sent to the President.

<F P=106> [Interview with Boris Kakubava, leader of the Organization </F>
for the Liberation of Abkhazia, by unidentified IBERIA News 
Agency correspondent; place and date not given: "The Geneva 
Communique... Has Been Prepared at the Level of Treason"] 
  [Text] [IBERIA] Batono [Georgian polite form of 
address] Boris, could you briefly tell us about your 
organization? 
  [Kakubava] The Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia 
was set up on 6 December 1991 on the basis of the council of the 
Abkhazian National Movement. This council is an organization 
elected by the Georgian population in Abkhazia that has been 
expelled from Abkhazia by the existing authorities there. Our 
aim is to secure the return of the 250,000 refugees to their 
permanent places of residence. 
  [IBERIA] How do you plan to achieve your aim? 
  [Kakubava] We intend to achieve our aim by political means. 
The authorities are currently conducting negotiations via those 
people who believe that Abkhazia is not a part of Georgia. It 
is precisely as a result of this that Abkhazia has been granted 
the status of a state subject in the world. However, we, the 
Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia, declare that a 
separatist grouping is currently functioning in Abkhazia that 
cannot be granted the status of a state. We are the sole body 
that is able to conduct negotiations in Geneva and that has 
found a way to get the refugees back. 
  The Georgian people have the ability to defend their 
motherland. Negotiations are not the only policy -- war is also 
a policy! True, we are unable to conduct expansionist wars, but 
we will always have the strength and military potential to 
protect our motherland. It is an insult to the nation to say 
that we have lost the war against the Abkhazians. The world 
should see that we are struggling not against 1 percent of the 
Georgian population, but against the Russian regular army with 
its military hardware, aviation, and fleet. 
  Georgia lost Abkhazia as a result of Gamsakhurdia's 
stupidity 
while the inaction of the present authorities is contributing to 
the formation of Abkhazia as an independent state. Those issues 
regarding the fact that Georgian land bearing the name of 
Abkhazia should be part of Georgia, that the jurisdiction of the 
Republic of Georgia should extend there, and that the invading 
army should be withdrawn from its territory should always stand 
at the forefront of the negotiations. 
  The Georgian authorities should stop proceeding along a 
criminal path and give us the opportunity to raise these three 
issues and make the world understand what has happened in 
Abkhazia. Our organization unites 250,000 refugees. We are a 
semi-paramilitary organization. Each one of us is ready to 
return to his home with weapon in hand and, if another way is 
not found, this is what will indeed happen. 
  We will not permit Jaba Ioseliani to take charge of the 
negotiations in Geneva and Abkhazia's interests to be defended 
by Ada Marshania, an Abkhazian woman who said in an interview 
that Abkhazia was independent and that we should grant it 
statehood. The Geneva communique on a settlement of the 
Abkhazian conflict signed on 13 January, which was presented to 
the people by the authorities as the result of great work, has 
been prepared at the level of treason. The Georgian authorities 
should immediately stop deceiving the people. The commission 
should be changed for the next round of talks and the work of 
the present commission should become a subject for discussion. 
Otherwise, if the government is not willing to hear what we 
have to say, we will raise the question of its resignation. 
  [IBERIA] How realistic is it to talk about the return 
of the refugees given the current situation? 
  [Kakubava] As regards the return of refugees to Gali rayon, 
I believe that whoever raised this question is far removed from 
politics. This means that we are dispatching the Georgian 
population as emigrants onto that territory that is under 
Abkhazian jurisdiction and where they can expect to be shot by 
separatists. It is written in this Geneva agreement that the 
Abkhazian authorities are entrusted with ensuring the return, 
reception, and protection of the refugees. However, this 
signifies our recognition of Abkhazia's statehood. Until 
Georgian jurisdiction is restored in Abkhazia, it is a crime to 
speak about the return of the refugees; the people are being 
deceived! 
  We do not want to be in opposition to the Georgian 
Government 
but, if the authorities do not listen to us, we will try to 
apply pressure in every way (I do not have in mind 
demonstrations as the situation in Georgia is tense enough 
already) since the road to Abkhazia does not pass through Geneva. 
  [IBERIA] Finally, what is your attitude toward the 
Union of Georgia's Citizens? 
  [Kakubava] The Union of Georgia's Citizens is a recently 
restored communist organization. It is an attempt to resurrect 
the Bolshevik-communist structures and will not bring the people 
anything good.

  [Text] Riga, February 11, RIA -- As has been reported today 
by the press centre of the North-Western Group of troops, the 
commander of this group, Col. Gen. Leonid Mayorov, has sent a 
letter to Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs in which he 
expressed his concern about the repeated attempts to evict 
servicemen of the Russian Army from their flats and about the 
ultimatum form of such actions. The commander wrote that this 
behaviour was typical especially of the heads of the Vidzei 
suburban territory and the Kurzem District of Riga. They had 
sent notices about the necessity of leaving their flats to 
several Russian officers and generals, including Anatoliy 
Gaponov, deputy commander of the North-Western Group of troops, 
and Anatoliy Vodopyanov, assistant commander. 
  The commander of the North-Western Group troops reminds the 
prime minister that the flats of Russian servicemen belong to 
the housing resources of the Russian Defence Ministry, and that 
their further use is a subject of inter-state negotiations 
between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Latvia. In 
his letter the commander points out that unilateral actions, 
more so the use of force, by local authorities may again 
exacerbate the situation with regard to the temporary presence 
of the Russian troops in Latvia.

  [Text] Moscow, February 11, RIA -- The supposed 
participation of the Russian Federation in NATO's Partnership 
for Peace programme will have its own specific feature, that is, 
it will reflect Russia's role as a military and nuclear power. 
This was stated in a conversation with a RIA correspondent by a 
high-ranking spokesman of the Russian foreign minister. He said 
that the Russian side will announce this at the consultations 
with NATO experts in Moscow on February 21 in discussing the 
procedure of Russia's joining the Partnership for Peace 
programme. According to the Russian diplomat, Russia's 
participation in this programme should include not only military 
components but also the issues of conversion. The Partnership 
for Peace programme, adopted at the January session of the heads 
of NATO member-states in Brussels, provides for gradual 
inclusion of the former Warsaw Treaty Organisation's members in 
NATO's political and military structures. The agreement on 
joining this programme has already been signed by Poland, 
Romania, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine. 
Latvia and Bulgaria are about to do it. 
  "Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace 
programme should markedly differ from the participation of the 
countries which have already jointed it," said the spokesman of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Moscow, February 1, RIA -- "Russia does not want, 
nor is going, to barge its way into world markets like a 
barbarian," Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told a 
news conference today. 
  "We do not want to force prices down, any more than destroy 
western markets," he said. 
  Chernomyrdin emphasised that Russia is prepared to press for 
entry into the world economic community on a parity basis. 
  He was against discrimination of Russian commodity 
producers, 
who should enjoy equal opportunities with other western 
exporters. 
  The Russian prime minister noted that reforms in the country 
require immense funds, which, in his view, can be obtained by 
selling Russian products in other countries. 
  Chernomyrdin further indicated that Russia's leadership 
invites western businessmen with their merchandise to the 
Russian market. 
  The prime minister believes that in a number of cases the 
Russian market may prove more promising than the European one.

  [Text] Moscow, February 1, RIA -- Russia is not going to 
join the Organisation of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC), 
but will continue consultations with it, Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin said at a news conference. In his opinion, 
conditions are not yet ripe to enter this international 
organisation, but he emphasised the need of coordinating 
activity on world oil markets. Russia and OPEC, he said, are 
largely concerned over the drop in oil prices, and they intend 
to take measures to stabilise them. This considered, meetings 
between Russia and OPEC will be continued on the ministerial 
level. 
  As Viktor Chernomyrdin and OPEC Secretary-General Subroto 
met 
in Davos, Switzerland, the sides discussed mutual reductions of 
oil export quotas with a view to stabilising prices for the 
product.

  [Text] Moscow, February 7, RIA -- The Prime Ministers of 
Russia and Moldova, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Andrei Sangheli, 
today signed an inter-government agreement in Moscow on trade 
and economic cooperation for 1994. 
  The agreement, according to the Russian prime minister, 
provides for switching to world prices in trade between the two 
countries. 
  Chernomyrdin noted that in 1994 Russia will be using world 
prices in trading with all former Soviet republics, although he 
recalled that energy prices for CIS states were differentiated 
last year. 
  The Russian prime minister pointed out that Russia and 
Moldova have a good trade balance. Moldova has almost fully 
paid for the Russian commodities. It owes only for the energy. 
  Sangheli added that Moldova is planning to pay its energy 
arrears within the next 30 to 45 days. 
  Chernomyrdin told journalists that Russia is planning to buy 
maize, seeds and non-ferrous metals from Moldova and added that 
specific trade figures are yet to be determined.

  [Text] Moscow, February 5, RIA--At a reception held in 
honour of the visiting French defence minister, Oleg Soskovets, 
Russia's first deputy prime minister, said that Russia should 
restructure its economy in accordance with the French industrial 
model rather than the American one. He noted that many of the 
country's latest hardships were the result of the emulation of 
the American monetarist model. "Reforming the Russian economy is 
a prolonged process, which will take years," Mr. Soskovets said. 
  He said he doubted that the United States would provide any 
substantial assistance for the development of the Russian 
economy and that France was a more proximate and reliable 
partner for Russia. 
  Mr. Soskovets said that Russia and France could co-operate 
in 
metallurgy and aerospace industry and hold consultations on the 
price, investment and banking policies. 
  The French defence minister, for his part, assured the 
Russian vice-premier that his country was prepared "to follow 
the logic of partnership" and wished to see Russia "a leading 
manufacturing power rather than a supplier of raw materials".

  [Text] Istanbul, February 6, RIA -- Russian-Turkish 
relations are acquiring a more expressed constructive shape, 
which gives way to real prospects of a mature political 
partnership between the two countries, as was emphasised during 
Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin's 
meeting here with Turkey's Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. 
  The Turkish side put a special emphasis on its interest in 
implementing the Russian Federation president's official visit 
to Turkey according to the agreement achieved, reported the 
information and press department of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, based on information received from Russia's 
consulate-general in Turkey.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- The international 
conference "Russia's federal structure and the implementation of 
the principles of pluralistic democaracy, rule-of-law state and 
human rights" opened in Moscow on Tuesday. It has been 
organised with the participation of the Council of Europe. 
  "The problems you are to discuss assume special importance 
at 
the present stage of the formation of Russian statehood the 
beginning to which has been set by the adoption of the new 
Constitution and election of the Federal Assembly. Every 
condition has now been created for the stable activity of state 
institutions and for Russia's democratic development, 
harmoniously combining the interests of the Federation and its 
regions", Russian President Boris Yeltsin said in a message of 
greetings to the conference. 
  It is important "to complete the formation of the 
Federation's legislative structure, to ensure for the 
Federation's subjects genuine independence in dealing with 
matters in their jurisdiction, to adjust mechanisms of 
cooperation and interaction of local and central structures of 
power", the message says. "Stability and security in Russia and 
far beyond its limits largely depend on how effectively these 
problems are resolved in Russia. I hope Russia will be able 
fully to rely on the experience of democracies in coping with 
difficulties". 
  The fundamental law of the country "includes the federal 
model envisaging the equality of subjects," said Boris 
Pastukhov, Russian deputy foreign minister, presiding over the 
conference. However, provisions of the Constitution are yet to 
be filled with contents of law. "We are not going to copy the 
experience of European states, but we should use everything 
positive in it", he said.

  [Text] United Nations February 15 TASS -- A Russian-Uzbek 
statement adopted on February 8 by Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev and his Uzbek counterpart Saidmukhtar Saidkasymov 
was circulated here today as a document of the United Nations 
Security Council. 
  "The foreign ministers of the Russian Federation and the 
Republic of Uzbekistan confirm the principled stand of their 
states on non- interference in internal affairs of Afghanistan 
and express profound concern with a new outburst of armed 
confrontation there... 
  "They call for termination of fratricidal war in Afghanistan 
and insistently urge all Afghan military-political forces to 
abandon the stake on force methods and begin a joint search for 
political compromises in the name of national consolidation and 
reconciliation. 
  "The sides believe that the conflict in Afghanistan is a 
consequence of domestic contradictions and it threatens to 
security and stability in the region. They are extremely 
alarmed with increased tension near southern borders of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States... The sides intend to keep 
to strict neutrality and the principle of non-interference in 
internal affairs of Afghanistan." 
  Russia and Uzbekistan expressed their readiness for maximum 
assistance to the settlement of Afghan differences and the 
search for way of further Afghan development "within the 
framework of international efforts, on coordination with the 
United Nations Organization and all interested states".

Federation Council is to open on 25 February and not the 18th as 
was announced earlier, the ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at 
the chamber's office. This is due to the postponement of the 
parliamentary address of the president of the Russian Federation. 
  We remind you, that the majority of the deputies to the 
upper 
chamber of the Federal Assembly, working on a non-permanent 
basis, are now in the regions where they are carrying out their

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report: "The Committee Head Opposes </F>
`Airfield Diplomacy'"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Lukin, newly elected chairman of the State 
Duma's international affairs committee, completed the transfer 
of his duties in the Russian Embassy in the United States and on 
Monday got down to the business of being a deputy. The extent 
to which the committee head is critical of the Russian Foreign 
Affairs Ministry can be seen from his interview given to 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent in which Mr. Lukin has 
apparently skipped none of the topical foreign policy issues. 
  Assessing the performance by the Foreign Affairs Ministry 
over the recent period, Vladimir Lukin stressed that compared to 
1992, the foreign policy department has begun to work better. 
Diplomats have begun gradually to find their own identity, and 
talk with their partners more actively, professionally, and 
independently. Yet many weaknesses have remained. The main one 
among them is that so far there is more showing-off and 
pretentiousness than real activity. At the same time Mr. Lukin 
noted that there are enough professionals in the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry who are doing real business. Their efforts so far, 
however, are not sufficiently coordinated, while the 
ostentatious "airfield" ["aerodromnaya"] diplomacy remains the 
ministry's prevailing style. 
  The committee chairman intends to change this style by 
accessible and legitimate methods: hearings, consultations, and 
parliamentary debates on Russia's international treaties. Mr. 
Lukin also plans to transfer to Russian soil the experience of 
the United States, where candidates for responsible posts have 
to pass congressional hearings while the president is obligated 
to take the lawmakers' decision into account. 
  Touching on the issue of protection of Russia's economic 
interests as part of its foreign policy, the committee chairman 
expressed his certainty that the main thing here is not to 
engage in ideology, but to count money. For instance, in 
concluding the "Indian" deal, it was necessary to count how much 
would be gained and how much lost, also considering that the 
space agreement with the United States in that event would be 
impossible. The opinion that Russia is in no position now to 
maintain its space complex took the upper hand. But the 
agreement with India was not canceled either. According to Mr. 
Lukin, thereby Moscow killed two birds with one stone. 
  Russia's support of sanctions against Libya, Iraq, and 
Yugoslavia was quite warranted. But Russia has had to pay a 
higher price for that than anybody else. The committee chairman 
is determined, with Duma assistance, to change the situation 
where "some people dance, while others get paid." Incidentally, 
he thinks that Iraq is essentially observing the UN resolutions, 
and the question about alleviating the sanctions against it has 
now grown urgent. As for the situation in Yugoslavia, it is 
vital to avoid a double standard approach here: As soon as it 
comes to the Serbs, sanctions are used against them; but when 
the Croats are involved, the FRG and other countries oppose it: 
"Yet both are guilty to approximately the same extent." 
  The most acute problem today, according to Mr. Lukin, is the 
situation of Russian-speakers in the former USSR. Here, the 
head of the Duma committee intends to do everything "to make 
sure that these people can either live normally outside Russia 
or come here, with dignity." The Foreign Affairs Ministry has 
been reacting too slowly to this problem: "Its leadership 
resisted even when the problem was literally pushed under the 
ministry's nose." Now the Foreign Ministry is paying lip 
service to it. The problem with Russophones in the Baltics can, 
in his opinion, be resolved in a very simple way: "Speak softly 
but carry what has to be carried in your hands. There is no need 
to keep saying that we shall not withdraw the troops, but this 
can actually be done while smiling nicely and gently." 
  As for integration within the CIS framework, some form of 
unification, according to Mr. Lukin, is historically inevitable. 
He favors a gradual and soft form of association, economic 
interdependence, and a single cultural space. Russia should 
find such a formula for integration whereby it would pay less 
(although it will have to pay in any event). "As to who will be 
the little king in what area, I could not care less," Mr. Lukin 
said. Touching on the territorial problems that can arise in 
the former USSR owing to the aspirations by, for instance, 
Crimea, South Ossetia, or the Dniestr Republic to join Russia, 
Mr. Lukin recalled the story of Shura Balaganov [a character in 
the novel "The Golden Calf" by Ilf and Petrov] who, having 
received a thousand rubles, picked someone's pocket for a 
three-ruble bill. He was caught and everything he had was taken 
away from him. Russia must not follow these rules. On the 
issue of the Kuril islands, the committee head advised to 
remember the wise Deng Xiaoping, who once said about a 
territorial dispute with Japan: A compromise needs to be 
sought, but if this proves impossible, our children will be 
wiser than us. 
<H5>  Commentary by the international department </H5>
  The news about Vladimir Lukin's appointment as head of the 
Duma committee has been received negatively on Smolenskaya 
Square [Foreign Ministry], to put it mildly. People there would 
have preferred to see Anatoliy Adamishin in this capacity. Now 
Andrey Kozyrev has an active and influential opponent in the 
Duma: Lukin is known not only as a critic of Foreign Ministry 
policy as a whole, but also as a person who has a "difficult" 
personal relationship with this department's head. Lukin has 
never made any secret of this and while ambassador to the United 
States, he approached the president directly, bypassing the 
Foreign Ministry hierarchy. Signs are that Lukin's relations 
with the Foreign Ministry on a number of issues will be even 
more acute than under Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, who headed a 
corresponding committee in the Russian Supreme Soviet. The 
situation in the Duma is objectively conducive to this: The 
mood in the chamber is often marked by a sharpened feeling of 
patriotism understood in its own peculiar way. In this light 
the conflict in the former Yugoslavia could become a subject of 
foreign policy debates. The point about "gentle smiling" on the 
issue of troop withdrawal from the Baltics apparently contains a 
serious problem. 
  Now Vladimir Lukin is trying to put himself across as a man 
of business. It can be supposed that even with the outward 
similarity of his conceptual positions with those of the Foreign 
Ministry (the interview gives reason for that), Lukin will try 
to use his present position as a springboard for the ministerial 
post.

<F P=106> [Robert Minasov report under "In the State Duma" rubric: </F>
"What Sort of Commission Is This, Creator?"] 
  [Text] As is well known, at S. Baburin's suggestion a 
majority of State Duma members included on the agenda the 
question of forming a parliamentary commission to investigate 
the causes and circumstances of the events of September-October 
last year. This was despite the perfectly reasonable argument 
that an official investigation is being conducted. 
  "How do you explain your persistence in forming the 
commission," I asked Baburin. 
  "We must call a spade a spade," he said. "There have been 
many mutually exclusive political statements on this subject, so 
deputies have agreed to investigate what's what themselves. 
People are saying that Yeltsin was defending the constitution 
in September-October last year, while most Russians hold the 
opposite opinion, as they confirmed in the 12 December 
elections." 
  It seems that Baburin is deliberately exaggerating the 
election results while completely ignoring another result of 12 
December -- the referendum on the draft constitution, which was 
proposed by the presidential side and supported by Russians. 
  Let us turn to another State Duma deputy -- Pavel Bunich. 
What does he think about the inclusion of the item about 
forming a parliamentary commission on the agenda of the lower 
house's plenary session? 
  "Dangerous tendencies are increasing in the State Duma. For 
example, one can sense a predisposition toward the controversial 
program of the Russian Academy of Sciences Economics Department 
and Reform Foundation, which essentially returns us to a 
command-distributive system. This could `galvanize' the 
government and incline it toward implementing this doubtful 
program. 
  "As regards the formation of a parliamentary commission to 
investigate the causes and circumstances of the events of 
September-October 1993, it is an attempt to provoke a conflict 
with the president and General Prosecutor's Office. Baburin and 
his supporters are using this commission to try to achieve a 
global aim -- to prove that the president's actions were 
anticonstitutional and consequently that it is time to oust him."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin by </F>
Flemming Rose in Moscow; date not given] 
  [Text] Moscow -- On 4 October last year the then leader of 
the parliamentary group of Russia's communists, Ivan Rybkin, was 
sitting in the Supreme Soviet when President Boris Yeltsin gave 
order to bomb the building. Eighteen months of bitter power 
struggle had brought Russia to the brink of civil war. Yeltsin 
and Rybkin found themselves on different sides of the barricades. 
  A month ago 46-year-old Ivan Rybkin was elected speaker of 
the Russian parliament's lower chamber and everyone expected 
that the seemingly convinced communist, a member of the Agrarian 
Party group in the State Duma, would immediately begin a 
campaign of revenge against his political opponent in the 
Kremlin and take every opportunity to make life difficult for 
Yeltsin. 
  However, the reverse has happened. Most surprisingly Rybkin 
has defended President Yeltsin in several critical situations in 
the course of the first month of the new parliament. When 
BERLINGSKE TIDENDE spoke to Ivan Rybkin here in Moscow at the 
weekend it was natural to ask him about his relations with 
President Yeltsin. 
  "On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the lifting of 
the siege of Leningrad I stood by President Yeltsin's side in 
Piskarev Cemetery in St. Petersburg where almost half a million 
victims of the siege are buried. I saw how the tears ran down 
the president's cheeks and at that moment I realized that more 
than anything else Russia needs peace and calm and cooperation," 
said Rybkin, who is so busy trying to get cooperation with the 
government and with President Yeltsin to work that he has become 
unpopular among the ranks of his own party. 
  "The three times I have spoken to President Yeltsin the 
conversations have been chiefly about the need for unity in 
society. President Yeltsin and I are agreed that the political 
forces in society must be consolidated, that the country needs 
peace and quiet in which it can work. Without peace we cannot 
continue the reforms," said Rybkin who comes from the southern 
Russian region of Volgograd, where he trained as an engineer. 
  Rybkin talks so much about peace and quiet and cooperation 
that many people view him with deep suspicion. 
  "Some people would like to see us coming to blows again, but 
I have had the scent of civil war in my nostrils and the main 
point of everything that I am doing now is about preventing a 
repeat of the civil war which the country experienced in 
1918-20." 
  Rybkin recalled a story by Soviet Russian author and Nobel 
Prize winner Mikhail Shokolov which takes place during the civil 
war after the revolution in 1917. Without realizing it an 
elderly Bolshevik kills his own son who is fighting on the side 
of the White rebel forces, and when he recognizes the birthmark 
on his son's leg he shoots himself through the forehead. 
  "Russia will not survive such a confrontation again," the 
speaker said emphatically and a quiver in his voice. 
  Rybkin said of himself that today he is as much a communist 
as Boris Yeltsin, Mikhail Gorbachev, or Aleksandr Yakovlev. The 
newly elected parlaimentary speaker described his own platform 
as social democratic. 
  "Today President Yeltsin is the unifying political figure in 
Russia. My own party or a similar party in the center of the 
political spectrum could well become Yeltsin's political 
platform. It is here that the sympathies of the emerging middle 
class will lie, and it is obvious that every reformer must win 
the support of the middle class."

  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk's visit to the U.S. 
scheduled for early March should take relations between the two 
countries to a new level, head of the foreign political service 
of the Ukrainian president Anton Buteyko told "Interfax-Ukraine" 
news agency. In his words, the visit will become "a real 
realization of the words of the American president that if 1993 
was the year of Russia, 1994 will become the year of Ukraine". 
  Buteyko pointed out that during the visit "the Ukrainian 
president hopes to confirm the development of cooperation", 
paying special attention to "the transformation of political 
agreements into economic ones". He said that the Charter on 
principles of relations between Ukraine and the U.S. will be 
adopted in Washington. 
  Besides, Buteyko said that documents on the development of 
economic ties and trade, cooperation in the space field and aid 
for conversion of the Ukrainian military complex, as well as on 
humanitarian and financial aid, had been prepared for the 
signing. Treaties on mutual protection of investment and 
prevention of dual taxation have also been prepared for the 
signing. 
  In Buteyko's opinion, "the American administration is 
finishing the re-evaluation of its attitude to Ukraine".

  [Text] Some foreign information sources have circulated 
reports, from which it follows that the energy crisis enveloping 
Ukraine is so strong that it has forced it to suspend not only 
its energy deliveries to Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech 
Republic, and Austria, but also the transit Russian energy 
deliveries. To what extent does this correspond to reality? 
  A UKRINFORM correspondent was informed at Ukraine's Ministry 
of Power and Electrification, that a tense situation with 
supplying electric power stations with organic fuel really did 
arise in Ukraine in the autumn-winter period of 1993-94. The 
main reasons were the more than hundredfold price increase for 
imported gas and oil products, tariffs on electric power lagging 
behind the general increase in the price of fuel, and also 
consumers' not wishing to pay the power industry. 
  Left alone with its fuel problems, Ukraine's unified power 
supply was forced to lower the frequency of the alternating 
current in the grid. Namely for this reason the power systems 
of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary separated 
from it, and the export of electric power by the Lvov interstate 
(?crossing) was suspended. 
  The suspension of its deliveries naturally did not evoke 
especial enthusiasm from [Ukraine's] foreign partners. However, 
they had an understanding attitude to the problems of their 
eastern neighbors and expressed their readiness for further 
cooperation after the situation improves. At the same time, 
they emphasized at the ministry of power and electrification, 
Ukrainian power engineers are continuing to carry out the 
transit of electric power from Russia to Bulgaria and Austria, 
although to date the Russian side has not extended the relevant 
agreement. 
  They assert at the ministry that other events in the said 
reports do not correspond to reality either, for example, those 
concerning Ukraine's losses of one and a half billion from the 
suspension of exports or [concerning] the urgent measures by 
parliamentarians of eastern European countries regarding uniting 
with western countries and excluding Ukraine from the number of 
partners. 
  It was noted at the ministry of power and electrification 
that the process of integrating the economies of eastern 
European states into the west European economic system, 
initiated by the leaders of the Visegrad Four countries in 1992, 
also includes gradual preparation for the transition by the 
power systems of these countries into a west European union. In 
order to resolve this problem the power engineers of Hungary, 
Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic set up the 
organization (?Centrel), to which Ukraine was accepted as an 
observer. 
  In particular the organization called for a resolution to 
the 
issue of keeping the technical possibilities for Central and 
Western Europe to receive electric power from Ukraine and 
Russia. A regular Centrel consultation in Warsaw on 16-17 
February will be about this with the participation of a 
Ukrainian delegation. 
  Similarly the Russian plans to construct new lines of 
electricity transfer to Europe via Belarus are not caused by the 
current fuel situation in Ukraine, but are a part of a long-term 
program of integrating Russia's power system in the Europe-wide 
power house. 
  And so, although the situation in Ukraine's power 
engineering 
continues to remain tense, they summarized at the country's 
minister of power and electrification, it is not a catastrophic 
one.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy by Zoltan </F>
Gyevai in Budapest; date not given: "A Ukrainian-Russian War Is 
Mere Speculation"] 
  [Text] According to the Ukrainian defense minister, the 
breaking out of an armed conflict between Moscow and Kiev is 
impossible. Air attacks in Bosnia would only exacerbate the 
situation and the addressees would not be the ones to suffer 
from it, Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy declared 
in a short interview to MAGYAR HIRLAP prior to his departure 
after a visit in Budapest. 
  [Gyevai] Some Western predictions warn of the possibility of 
a war between Russia and Ukraine because of the critical 
economic situation in Ukraine. Does Kiev feel such a danger? 
  [Radetskyy] No, and I find this impossible. The economy is 
in a serious state in both Ukraine and in Russia. A war does 
not strengthen the economic situation; on the contrary, it 
weakens the economy. Therefore, in my view, the predictions you 
have mentioned are mere speculations. 
  [Gyevai] How did Kiev receive the Russian request that the 
United Nations authorize Moscow to carry out peacekeeping 
activity in the sensitive points of the former Soviet Union? 
  [Radetskyy] I must say that we have not yet dealt with this 
issue. At the same time, we think it is important that every 
such peacekeeping mission should take place under UN auspices. 
I do not find it expedient to carry out such tasks separately, 
especially not in the CIS. 
  [Gyevai] On what does Ukraine want to focus in implementing 
the Partnership for Peace program proposed by NATO? 
  [Radetskyy] First of all, we have a positive approach toward 
the initiative itself. We are in favor of accepting 
peacekeeping tasks in various regional conflicts. We discussed 
the issue and, in my opinion, this seems to be the optimal and 
most acceptable solution. 
  [Gyevai] What is your opinion of the idea that NATO should 
use air attacks as a response to the attack in Sarajevo last 
week? 
  [Radetskyy] I oppose the use of the air force because this 
will not solve the problem we are facing. It will not only fail 
to solve the problem, but it will even exacerbate the situation. 
In addition, such an action would cause civilians, children, 
old people, and women to suffer, rather than the warring 
factions. I think that we should seek a solution in two 
directions. On the one hand, the sides involved in this 
conflict should settle their internal differences of views. On 
the other hand, this endeavor should be supported not only by 
words but also by deeds. However, the supply of arms and 
military equipment is not the proper way of support.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Yavorskyy: "Why Have We Been </F>
Disarmed?"] 
  [Text] It is sad but true: Ukraine is giving up its 
nuclear weapons -- the same kind of weapons that other countries 
seek to obtain by all legitimate and illegitimate means, and 
that countries which already have them do not want to let slip 
from their hands. Ukraine is giving them up voluntarily. And to 
whom? To Russia -- a state that trod Ukraine down for 300 
years, and which is currently putting forward territorial claims 
against us; a state from which direct threats are addressed 
against us, and in which the rapid advancement of chauvinistic 
forces is plain for all to see. 
  Perhaps we are handing over our nuclear weapons because they 
have lost their value? Not at all. Their value remains 
colossal. Moreover, they serve as the only sure protection 
against aggression from any state. No wonder that certain 
countries -- Israel, Pakistan, India, and others -- have either 
already acquired them, or are very close to developing them. 
The material and financial value of nuclear weapons is also 
astronomically high. Their enormous value is beyond question. 
  So why is Ukraine voluntarily giving up this enormous 
treasure that is so desired by others? Perhaps because we love 
peace more than all other nations of the world? Or maybe we do 
not realize what we have really obtained by the will of God? 
  Neither. Everything is much more prosaic. It is simply that 
other states, primarily Russia and the United States, are 
forcing us to hand over our nuclear weapons. They are forcing 
us by threats, moral and economic pressure, and other means. 
Ukraine is not giving up its nuclear weapons voluntarily but 
under duress. One should be deeply aware of this truth, which 
is shameful for us Ukrainians. 
  From the dense demagogy of the president, who is trying to 
portray Ukraine's defeat in the issue of nuclear weapons almost 
as a victory, we could single out one argument that is being 
repeated with many variations: Ukraine is unable to keep its 
nuclear weapons because it does not have enough strength to 
withstand the pressure from Russia, the United States, and other 
countries. It does not have the strength because the Ukrainian 
people are not united, the economy is in shambles, our 
scientific potential is poorly organized, and because it has not 
found allies on the international arena. 
  It is really hard for Ukraine to resist the external 
pressure 
in this situation. Who has reduced Ukraine to such a condition? 
  Are we to believe that the complex circumstances in which 
Ukraine finds itself are the objective reasons why it is 
impossible to preserve our nuclear weapons? "Ukraine cannot 
keep its nuclear weapons because this is objectively 
impossible!" -- the media keep telling us. Is that really true? 
  It is only half the truth. Ukraine really cannot preserve 
its nuclear weapons -- not because of objective reasons, 
however, but because of subjective ones. This does not mean 
that it is totally impossible, but that President Kravchuk and 
his team are unable to do it. The current Ukrainian leadership 
is unable to cope with the numerous problems facing the state, 
and it frequently surrenders in the face of those difficulties. 
The problem is not the nuclear weapons themselves, but the 
ability to conduct a clear and consistent foreign policy, unify 
the Ukrainian people, speed up economic reforms, mobilize the 
country's scientific potential, and find strong and reliable 
allies abroad. How is it possible to speak about a state 
without these aspects? 
  Having something of colossal value such as nuclear weapons, 
one could use them as a powerful lever to solve all economic and 
political problems. Had Ukraine decided to proclaim unilateral 
nuclear disarmament, it would have obtained concessions and 
guarantees from Russia, the United States, and other countries, 
which would have put it among the leading countries of Europe. 
Still, what is possible for the strong is impossible for the 
weak, such as our leadership.

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- The treaty signed 
today by the Russian Federation and Tatarstan shows that 
"dictates from the center are being replaced by mutual respect 
for the interests of the Russian Federation as a whole, and for 
each component of the federation, in particular," Boris Yeltsin 
said at the signing ceremony. 
  The president emphasized the importance of the formula 
arrived at during the drafting of the treaty. The treaty's 
preamble states that the Republic of Tatarstan is unified, as a 
state, with the RF by the constitution of the Russian 
Federation, by the constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, 
and by the treaty on delimitation of responsibilities and mutual 
delegation of powers. The Republic of Tatarstan takes part in 
international relations and foreign economic activity. 
  "This formula," the president said, "also reflects the 
actual 
unity of the Russian state, as it exists now, and its new 
federal structure. It is developed on the basis of the 
constitution of the Russian Federation, backed up by treaty 
procedures, that is, by harmonization of interests." 
  The head of state stressed that "treaties of this kind are, 
basically, the sole constitutional way of removing 
contradictions between the Russian Federation Constitution and 
republican constitutions in a civilized way, without twisting 
anyone's arm." 
  "Everyone should see that this is not a conspiracy among 
bosses, another carve-up of powers, but a positive political and 
economic development," the president said.

  [Text] Russian Nationalities and Regional Policy Minister 
Sergey Shakhray, who has prepared the text of the treaty on the 
mutual delegation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan, has 
called the document "a great breakthrough in development of 
federative relations." In his interview with Interfax he 
declared that "for Russia Federation [this] does not mean 
weakening of the state but is the sole means to preserve the 
nation's territorial integrity." 
  Shakhray pointed out that laws and Russia's Constitution 
have 
actually not acted on Tatarstan's territory over the last three 
years (the term during which the treaty was being developed). 
As he said, this situation could have led to a political crisis. 
  Shakhray reported that a new method to develop documents had 
given impetus to the success of the negotiations. "We were 
moving to the text of the basic treaty basing on concrete 
agreements. Thanks to this we managed to prepare both the 
document itself and mechanisms to implement it," he said. In 
Shakhray's opinion, this method makes it possible to sign an 
identical treaty with Chechnya as well. At the same time he 
underlined that the text of the document to be signed with 
Groznyy would differ from the one signed with Tatarstan. 
  Tatarstan's participation in the elections to Russia's 
Federal Assembly is the political result of the treaty, said 
Shakhray. "This means recognition of Russian Federation's 
sovereignty, its legislation, and Constitution on the part of 
the republic," he underlined. 
  Shakhray does not rule out possibility that other 
constituent 
members would wish to take the course of agreed relations with 
federal bodies of state power. Development of such a process, 
to quote Shakhray, corresponds to the country's Constitution 
which stipulates that economic and regional "self-tuning of the 
federation" should be built with the help of treaties. Shakhray 
also underlined that the federal parliament should adopt a 
decree on principles of division of objects of responsibility 
and authorities to regulate this process. 
  According to Shakhray, in the future Tatarstan may join the 
Federative Treaty in the field of provisions which coincide with 
the provisions of the treaty on division of objects of 
responsibility and authorities signed on Tuesday.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Todres commentary: "Federation Treaty Outlives </F>
Its Usefulness"] 
  [Excerpts] Both Moscow and Kazan are satisfied with the 
signing of the treaty between the Russian Federation and 
Tatarstan. The Tatar leaders rejoice that they have finally, 
after a three-year tug-of-war, wrenched from Moscow recognition 
of their independence. Boris Yeltsin is pleased that he had been 
able to remove from the document a clearly separatist spirit 
expunging the former autonomous entity's sovereignty slogans. 
The authorities of the other republics, components of Russia, 
are hoping to use the path beaten by Tatarstan. But yesterday 
seems to have become critical for the future of the Federation 
Treaty, upon which, some people some time ago were going to 
build "a new, stable Russian statehood." [passage omitted] 
  The Tatar leaders sacrificed political rhetoric for getting 
all the benefits in the economic sphere. It is these agreements 
(especially the budget agreement), rather than the treaty 
itself, that were the hardest to secure. The day before, the 
republic's premier admitted that "Boris Fedorov's departure made 
the entire process substantially easier." 
  The historic Tuesday is nevertheless fraught precisely with 
political complications. Its smaller consequence consists in 
the fact that the concluded treaty is not going to add 
predictability in relationships between Moscow and Kazan: Even 
if Tatarstan contravenes the constitution of the former 
autonomous entity, nobody there for this reason will alter their 
own Fundamental Law, by Mr. Sabirov's admission. This signifies 
that also still remaining is the legal basis for fresh claims 
(should they arise) to the federal authority. Thus, when Boris 
Yeltsin states that the treaty is going to be a model "of 
removing differences between the federal and republican 
constitutions," he, to put it mildly, overestimates the 
achievement. 
  Here is the greater consequence: Russia has a further 87 
regions, not counting Chechnya. The new federal constitution 
has proclaimed them all equal. The question "If the Tatars can 
do it, why can't we?" is quite natural. Why should the other 
regional leaders swallow this treaty in silence? By the way, 
their kurultay -- the Federation Council -- already wants to 
consider the Russo- Tatar treaty at its session, for precisely 
these reasons, it seems. [passage omitted]
