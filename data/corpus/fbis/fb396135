<F P=106> [Interview with Mintimer Shaymiyev, president of Republic of </F>
Tatarstan, by ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Sorokin; place and 
date not given: "Mintimer Shaymiyev: The Market Is No 
Hindrance to Tatarstan"] 
  [Text] Of all the evils of the present period Tatarstan 
seems to have chosen the very least: A moderate, wise policy 
has been adopted in the republic -- to create something new 
while destroying as little as possible of the old. The tactic 
of "gently" entering the market has proved correct. With this 
topic I began my conversation with Mintimer Shaymiyev, president 
of the Republic of Tatarstan. 
  [Shaymiyev] We should not flatter ourselves, for negative 
tendencies do, unfortunately, remain: Stability has not come 
about in the economy, and the financial position of major 
commodity producers is critical. The situation is exacerbated 
by the fact that a natural slump has occurred in oil extraction 
-- the fields, which have produced 2.5 billion tonnes of oil, 
are getting old. One-third of the oil wells are unprofitable, 
and many are standing idle. This and the increase in 
nonpyaments are creating additional difficulties: 
Subcontractors -- petrochemical enterprises -- are on the verge 
of coming to a halt. 
  [Sorokin] To this has been added the tragedy at KamAZ [Kama 
Truck Plant].... 
  [Shaymiyev] Yes, the thread breaks where it is weakest. At 
the most critical moment, in April 1993, the head plant -- the 
engine plant -- of the "KamAZ" Joint-Stock Company burned to the 
ground. By concentrating 100 heavy cranes and 10,000 workers on 
the site and organizing round-the-clock work according to a 
flextime schedule, we managed to eliminate the consequences of 
the tragedy in a shorter time. Construction workers cleared the 
debris of 90,000 tonnes of metal structures in three months. 
The final roofing unit was recently installed, and the engine 
plant will soon start working at full capacity. 
  At the same time I wish to speak about the fate of YelAZ 
[Yelabuga Motor Vehicle Plant], which is under construction. 
The intergovernmental agreement "On the Joint Creation of the 
Motor Vehicle Plant in the City of Yelabuga" was signed in Minsk 
last year. The proportions of the investments by the 
participants -- Russia, Tatarstan, Ukraine, Bashkortostan, 
Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and 
Tajikistan -- were determined. The "YelAZ-invest" interstate 
corporation was set up in Tatarstan for the purpose of 
concentrating the investors' funds for the construction project. 
It was planned to form the incorporation capital in full within 
a year. The world's major motor vehicle companies have joined 
in the YelAZ project. All the conditions are being created for 
the creation of a modern, competitive motor vehicle production 
facility. 
  [Sorokin] On the other hand, things are improving in the 
agro-industrial complex. 
  [Shaymiyev] Our general line is to give the countryside all 
possible support. The government has channeled from the state 
budget 156 billion rubles [R], or half the expenditure, into 
improving the land's fertility, increasing spending on 
reclamation, supporting seed growing and pedigree breeding, 
developing the food and processing industries, and constructing 
housing. As a result, not only has the slump in production 
volumes been eliminated in the countryside but an increase has 
also been achieved. Livestock numbers have been restored, and a 
record harvest for recent years was grown -- 23 quintals per 
hectare. The volume of purchases, compared with 1992, stood at 
107 percent for meat and poultry, 109 percent for milk, and 104 
percent for eggs. These indicators stand at 85, 94, and 99 
percent respectively for Russia. This year we intend to 
preserve the system of procurements of the products of fields 
and livestock units on the basis of contracts. The 
restructuring of kolkhozes has begun: Kolkhoz members are being 
allocated a share of property and an allotment of land. 
  [Sorokin] Two years of hard, unpredictable reforms. What 
are the lessons? 
  [Shaymiyev] The reforms begun in 1992 have become 
irreversible -- this is the most important result. What are the 
landmarks of the reforms? First, a partial price liberalization 
has been carried out. The abandonment of state regulation has 
brought inflation from a hidden state out into the open. This 
has made it possible to assess the state of the economy 
correctly at the macro level and the micro level. Consequently, 
management has become more efficient. Second, partial 
convertibility of the ruble has been introduced. Fluctuations 
in the ruble rate have become one of the indicators and a real 
tool regulating the movement of capital and, partly, the 
dynamics of prices. But it is a disturbing fact that inflation 
has acquired a stable, self-producing nature. Third, the 
privatization process has begun. Approximately half the 
property in Tatarstan has already been privatized. Plans have 
been approved for the privatization of 360 more enterprises with 
an incorporation capital of more than R500 billion. 
Unfortunately, small-scale privatization is lagging behind. 
Before the end of the year we plan to create conditions so that 
at least two-thirds of small cafes, cafeterias, workshops, and 
hairdressers find owners. The privatization of housing has 
begun, and a housing market is coming into being. 
  [Sorokin] What is a strategic area in Tatarstan's economy? 
  [Shaymiyev] Life has brought us to the truth that we will 
not emerge from the crisis without structural restructuring of 
the entire economy. It is an alarming fact that labor 
productivity has not increased but has fallen in some places 
since the start of the reforms. Compared with 1992, it stood at 
just 89 percent last year. It will be possible to overcome the 
monopolized economy with its cost-led mechanism and to attain a 
competitive level only through painstaking, long-term work. 
This cannot be done quickly. 
  The Government of Tatarstan has concluded an agreement with 
the "Mashinoeksport" Association on the joint implementation of 
18 projects of innovation and conversion. The republic's former 
military plants will produce 70 kinds of new products of 
interest to the world market. There are positive examples. 
Kazan's "Terminal" Association has been entirely deprived of 
military orders, which a year ago made up 90 percent of its 
output. The enterprise has quickly started up production of 
domestic appliances and other products and has emerged from a 
complex situation without standing idle and without cutting the 
work force. We intend to give selective support to 
life-supporting sectors -- the agro-industrial complex above 
all. It is planned to reduce oil extraction by 10 percent, 
while, on the other hand, production of polyethylene, rubber, 
bricks, foodstuffs, clothes, and furniture will increase. 
  [Sorokin] How is it possible to assess the social position 
in the republic? 
  [Shaymiyev] The average wage stood at R128,000 in December. 
In February the living wage is forecast at the level of R30,000, 
and we intend to increase the minimum wage to the same level. 
The state subsidizes each city resident for housing and 
municipal services, transport, food, and medicines to the tune 
of R39,000. Additional funds will be allocated to maintain 
children's preschool establishments. 
  [Sorokin] Finally, what is the state of Tatarstan's 
relations with Russia? Two years have elapsed since work began 
on a draft treaty. 
  [Shaymiyev] The protracted break in the treaty process has 
now ended. In addition to examining questions of the economy at 
the January meeting in Moscow with President Boris Yeltsin, an 
accord was reached on completing the preparation of the treaty 
and intergovernmental agreements. An entirely new, previously 
unknown document is coming into being which proclaims the 
primacy of the person and the principles of Tatarstan's 
relations with the Russian Federation, foreign states, and 
international organizations. It is proposed to form 
plenipotentiary missions of Russia and Tatarstan in Kazan and 
Moscow. The treaty, on which we have been working for a long 
time, will soon happen. It will be a document of the reforming 
of Russia and of the Federation's renewal on democratic 
principles and the guarantor of Tatarstan's statehood. 
  Strange though it may seem, politicians have appeared who 
oppose the treaty. Living by the principles of "the worse, the 
better," they call for self-isolation. But the people do not 
support them. It is senseless, to say the least, to speak of 
Tatarstan's isolation. Are we not seeing how sovereign states 
are asking to join the CIS and wish to establish or restore 
economic ties? The people have gotten nothing from wholesale 
disintegration but new misfortunes. We cannot disregard this. 
Therefore we favor the treaty. The people are now inclined 
toward the elections, which will be held a second time in 
Tatarstan 13 March. We hope that deputies will be elected to 
the Federal Assembly and the State Duma.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Lukashov report under the "Candidates" rubric: </F>
"Elections in Tatarstan: Part Two"] 
  [Text] By midnight on 14 February the process of 
collecting signatures and applications from local citizens 
wishing to compete for seats in the federal legislature ended in 
Tatarstan's five State Duma districts and one Federation Council 
district. A record was set by Privolzhskiy district No. 27: A 
total of 11 candidates plan to run for parliament there. A 
curious situation came about in Moskovskiy district No. 24, 
where the coveted seat will be contested by columnist Fedor 
Burlatskiy (it is yet unknown what relation to Tatarstan he has 
-- SEGODNYA) and Yuriy Voronin, former deputy Russian Federation 
Supreme Soviet chairman, who had earlier been chairman of the 
Tatarstan State Planning Committee and had been nominated there 
for the Russian parliament. Aside from these, there are another 
five candidates registered in the district. 
  At least five candidates have been registered in three other 
State Duma districts also. Virtually all lists feature 
Tatarstan Communist Party nominees and candidates from "Equality 
and Rule-and- Law," Tatarstan's democratic bloc. Political 
observers have noted that there are few Tatar names in the lists 
of candidates who have already submitted documents. As in all 
of Russia in the latest elections, journalists and charismatic 
local leaders account for a significant share of the candidates. 
  As for the Federation Council, Tatarstan President Mintimer 
Shaymiyev and Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid Mukhametshin will 
apparently honor its meetings with their presence in the not so 
distant future. At least they have already submitted the 
requisite number of signatures. People in Kazan think that they 
both have virtually 100 percent chances of success, because 
their sole opponent is Aleksandr Lozovoy, a deputy chairman of 
the local parliament. It has been pointed out, however, that he 
may "draw" a certain share of votes of the Russian-speaking 
population thanks to his Slavic name. 
  On 18 February all electoral commissions are required to 
compete the authentication of electoral lists and other 
documents, after which registered candidates will be given 
appropriate certificates. 
  The new round of the Federal Assembly elections, which were 
deemed to have been invalid in December, is scheduled for 13 
March.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 15 Feb -- Citizens of Crimea should 
undergo military service on the territory of the Republic of 
Crimea. Yuriy Meshkov, president of the republic of Crimea, has 
sent this instruction addressed to the command of Ukraine's 
Navy. With regard to this, representatives of Ukraine's navy 
have stated that they are subordinate to Ukraine's Ministry of 
Defense and to Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president and 
commander of the Ukraine armed forces. In their opinion, the 
president of the Republic of Crimea does not have jurisdiction 
over the command of Ukraine's Navy.

  [Text] The statement Yuriy Meshkov, the Crimean President, 
made about making the Russian ruble a legal tender in the 
peninsula was "ill-conceived and premature." Ukrainian Deputy 
Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who said so in an 
Interfax-Ukraine interview, added that "the Russian ruble will 
never be legal in Ukraine." 
  He said that the Ukrainian leaders were thinking of "ways 
and 
means" of allowing the Crimean authorities a maximum of 
self-government but "the budgetary relations will remain largely 
unchanged." 
  He described the Black Sea Fleet as "a powerful cover of the 
entire south of both Ukraine and Russia" but emphasized that 
"the Black Sea coast is, above all, our southern border."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>
  [Text] On February 4, leader of the Republican Party of 
Crimea Yuriy Meshkov was sworn in as Crimea's first president. 
In January, Interfax-Exclusive acquainted the reader with Yuriy 
Meshkov as a candidate to the presidential post. Political 
scientists believe that Meshkov's pro-Russian position may 
complicated relations between Moscow and Kiev. Moreover, some 
analysts predict that Crimea may become a second Karabakh. 
Interfax correspondent Sergey Safronov talks with Yuriy Meshkov. 
  IF: Some assert that the forthcoming referendum on Crimea's 
independence is the main element of your policy. 
  MESHKOV: The main aspect of my policy is Crimea's 
independence. Independence alone will allow us to solve our 
economic problems. The results of the presidential elections 
confirmed the population's orientation to economic, cultural and 
other links with Russia, and to a union with Russia. As to the 
referendum, there is a law on the referendum which must be 
observed. 
  IF: Do you mean economic aspects when you talk about 
Crimea's 
independence? 
  MESHKOV: Economy comes first. The forthcoming referendum is 
expected to put Crimea's economic independence on a juridical 
footing. 
  IF: Do you favor Crimea's integration with Russia or 
Crimea's 
complete independence? 
  MESHKOV: Our goal is an independent and self-sufficient 
Crimea. It will not be isolated from the CIS, however, but be a 
full-fledged member of a single economic system. 
  IF: Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told Interfax 
recently that Ukraine was planning to depart from the Massandra 
agreements on the Black Sea Fleet and get back to the Yalta 
agreements. What is actually meant here is Kiev's refusal to 
pass the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia. What 
would you say about this? 
  MESHKOV: This is not the first time Kiev violates the 
international principle of observance of agreements. Agreement 
must be implemented, said the Roman law more than 2000 years 
ago. Ukraine's position has nothing to do with the principles 
and norms of international law. The Black Sea Fleet must be 
indivisible, belong to Russia and be based in Sevastopol which 
is an inalienable part of the Republic of Crimea. 
  IF: Suppose the Black Sea Fleet will belong to Russia. 
Simferopol may claim a compensation for the utilization of the 
fleet's infrastructure. What will relations be like between the 
Crimean authorities and the Black Sea Fleet? 
  MESHKOV: I hope these relations will be good and either side 
will observe its own interests. 
  IF: Moscow anxiously followed both rounds of presidential 
elections in Crimea. How do you assess Kiev's official reaction 
to your success and the defeat of the Crimean parliament speaker 
Nikolai Bagrov? 
  MESHKOV: How can one respond to almost unanimous results? 
(Last Friday the Crimean president had talks in Kiev with 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. To quote Meshkov, the 
talks were sincere and gave a fresh impetus to Crimean-Ukrainian 
relations. "I returned to Simferopol with a shield," said 
Meshkov. Journalists note, however, that Meshkov looked 
depressed after the talks -- Interfax). 
  IF: Some argue that the elections in Crimea were illegal, 
because they were at variance with the Ukrainian constitution, 
so their results might be challenged. Do you think such a 
situation may evolve into open military confrontation? 
  MESHKOV: No, it can't. One may say whatever one chooses, but 
no one can cancel the more than a million votes cast for the 
president. The elections were juridically grounded and no one 
should anticipate any unreasonable steps on the part of Kiev. 
  IF: Crimea is faced with many problems, including the 
problem 
of the Crimean Tatars. How are you going to tackle it? 
  MESHKOV: We shall seek a solution of this problem on the 
basis of international law and the laws of the Republic of 
Crimea. The material damage inflicted on the citizens of the 
Republic of Crimea must be compensated. The government must do 
so by all means and Simferopol will provide such guarantees. 
However, in tackling this problem Crimea must act in close 
cooperation with Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan (most of the 
Crimean Tatars banished from Crimea in 1944 live in Uzbekistan 
-- Interfax). 
  IF: What would you say about the white Lincoln which a 
Crimean billionaire promised to give you? 
  MESHKOV: If he keeps the promise which he gave before the 
elections, when nobody knew who would become president, I will 
not consider this limo as something given to a specific person. 
I don't think I'll use it very often. But I might make use of 
it to welcome Leonid Kravchuk or Boris Yeltsin here in Crimea.

  [Text] It took the leadership of the Ukrainian Civic 
Congress of the Crimea [UHCC] more than two months to have its 
party registered. The documents were returned several times for 
amendment. Finally, the long-awaited registration certificate 
has been received at the Crimean Ministry of Justice. The party 
is in favor of strengthening the status of the Crimean Republic 
as an autonomous and integral part of Ukraine. It will defend 
the interests of the peninsula's Ukrainian population. It will 
give much attention to military issues, especially the political 
and social protection of those Ukrainian servicemen who are 
serving in the Crimean Republic. The party intends to 
participate in the Crimean Supreme Council elections.

  [Text] Kiev, 15 Feb -- A working consultation took place at 
Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers on 15 February under the 
chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, at which 
a set of economic, financial, property, and other problems were 
examined, in particular the implementation of resolutions and 
agreements between Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea on 
agriculture, the water industry, and municipal services. 
  The heads of the Ministry of Machine-Building, 
Military-Industrial Complex and Conversion, the Ministry of 
Energy and Electrification, the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food, the Ministry of Transport, and other ministries and 
departments of Ukraine, the leaders of Crimean Government 
structures headed by Anatoliy Franchuk, first deputy chairman of 
the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea, and 
directors of a number of Crimean enterprises, took part in the 
consultations. 
  The press service of the president and Cabinet of Ministers 
of Ukraine reported that "the consultations proceeded in the 
spirit of full mutual understanding," and that Ukraine's 
Government will most likely take a decision on the results of 
its work. 
  A UNIAN correspondent has learned from unofficial sources 
that during the consultations, the Crimean delegation insisted 
on the resolution of the issue of resubordinating the town of 
Sevastopol to the Republic of Crimea. In an interview with a 
UNIAN correspondent Yaroslav Shpak, chief of Krymenerho [Crimea 
power] and a member of Crimea's delegation, reported that it has 
also been proposed to abolish the pass system in Sevastopol.

  [Text] Kiev, 15 Feb -- As UNIAN already reported on 14 
February, Yevgeniy Saburov -- a well-known Russian economist, 
who will in fact be heading the Crimean Government -- is to 
begin fulfilling the duties of Crimea's deputy prime minister 
[as received] in the near future. Crimea's Constitution does 
not envisage the post of prime minister; the Cabinet of 
Ministers is led by the president of the autonomous republic. 
  In a conversation with a UNIAN correspondent on 15 February, 
Mykola Mykhalchenko, head of the service of the president of 
Ukraine for domestic policy issues, noted that Saburov cannot be 
appointed to any state post as this runs counter to Ukrainian 
legislation, in particular Article 4: On public service in 
Ukraine, which indicates that the right to a state post belongs 
to citizens of Ukraine. 
  According to Mykhalchenko, without Ukrainian citizenship 
Saburov can only lay claim to a consultant's role in the 
apparatus of Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. The head of the 
service of the president of Ukraine for domestic policy issues 
also stressed that he considers Saburov's utterances on 
introducing the Russian ruble on the peninsula in parallel with 
the Ukrainian karbovanets to be populist ones.

  [Text] Odessa -- A UNIAN correspondent learned that a 
regional branch of the Interregional Bloc for Reforms 
[Kuchma-Hrynyov bloc] was set up on 14 February. It was founded 
on the initiative of Hryhoriy Rychahov, chairman of the regional 
branch of the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine; Andriy 
Krupnyk, city council deputy; Yuriy Zaporozhchenko, regional 
council deputy; and Viktor Tymofeyenko, chairman of the local 
branch of the New Ukraine association. The latter is notorious 
for the statement he made at last year's regional council 
session. He said he could prove that "it is Ukraine that is an 
empire which for 30 years has been sending its politicians to 
lead the Soviet Union, in which time these politicians ruined 
Russia". 
  The reform bloc regional branch's two latter founding 
members 
also coauthored the Odessa Oblast Council's ultimatum statement

Journalists"] 
  [Text] In the Crimea, the forces of the "Republican 
Movement of the Crimea" and of the "Russian Society of the 
Crimea" have intensified their campaign of pressure against 
dissident journalists. Picketing is organized of the Crimean 
and Sevastopol television and radio broadcasting companies and 
demands are advanced to dismiss television and radio journalists 
Tatyana Korobova, Lilya Budzhurova, Leonid Pilunskyy, and Halyna 
Khmelyovska, who occupy the position of common sense. 
  Clouds are gathering over president of the "Crimea" 
Television and Radio Broadcasting company Valeriy Astakhov, who 
is accused of pro-Ukrainian sentiments. In reality, Astakhov 
occupies a balanced centrist position. Some people even assert 
that a competition has been announced for the presently occupied 
post of president of the "Crimea" Television and Radio 
Broadcasting company. Those who claim this post include former 
head of the company Anatoliy Sivachenko, one of the leaders of 
the "Republican Movement of the Crimea" Boris Kizilov, and 
leader of the "Russian Party of the Crimea" Sergey Shuvaynikov.

<F P=106> [Article by Ihor Tarnopilskyy: "And the Defense Ministry </F>
Assures Us That the Army Is Outside Politics"] 
  [Text] The declaration by the presidents of Ukraine, 
Russia, and the United States on the nuclear weapons stationed 
on our territory is one of the most important events of last 
January and it triggered mixed reactions, especially in Ukraine. 
It will probably have significant influence on the fate of the 
Ukrainian people and state. President Leonid Kravchuk and his 
team, for example, claim that Ukraine's future will be bright 
and cloudless as soon as we give up or, to be more precise, hand 
over our nuclear arsenal to Russia. For the first time, 
officers and generals of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, headed by 
Defense Minister Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, were actively 
involved in the campaign to support and propagate this idea. 
The extreme zeal with which the Ukrainian military pressed for 
the "nuclear trash" to be sent to our northern neighbor raises 
the suspicion that they might not get their pay only from 
Ukrainian funds. Whatever the case, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev could not even dream of better advocates of his 
country's policies; and President Bill Clinton would definitely 
promise them high positions in the Pentagon (remember how they 
offered our president the job of press secretary for the U.S. 
President?). 
  On the other hand, one can understand Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry officials -- they simply obey instruction from on high. 
As for the Defense Minister, however, it was expected that he 
would give a frank opinion about the situation. But Gen. 
Radetskyy did not have the guts to do this. It was done for him 
by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Supreme 
Council deputies during the examination of the Moscow tripartite 
treaty and its annex. Following that session, it became obvious 
that the president's campaign is nothing but a fig leaf covering 
his and other high-ranking officials' blunders. 
  So Ukraine has lost the battle over the right to have its 
interests respected, and it was left at the mercy of two 
empires. Very soon, under a slight dollar anesthetic -- and 
maybe even without it -- it will have its "nuclear teeth" 
removed. Moscow's playing of the "Crimean card," however, may 
stop this operation. 
  Incidentally, as this situation would certainly work to the 
Kremlin's advantage, the temptation to use it is very great. 
The newly elected Crimean khan, Meshkov, does not even conceal 
his pro-Moscow orientation, while the dropping of the moratorium 
on the all-Crimean referendum gives the green light to 
separatists. The self-assuredness of chauvinists will be 
boosted by the knowledge that standing behind them is the Black 
Sea Fleet -- a heavy military fist -- whose commander, Admiral 
Baltin, habitually "forgets" that he is accountable to two 
presidents. In late January, Baltin had another opportunity to 
pay tribute to the Kremlin and do some saber-rattling, which he 
certainly did according to the best imperial traditions. As a 
countermeasure to the Ukrainian strategic territorial defense 
exercises conducted in Kiev and led by the commander in chief, 
L. Kravchuk -- which the Moscow media exaggerated to call 
"large-scale maneuvers in southern Ukraine" -- Adm. Baltin 
ordered heightened combat readiness in the Coastal Guard 
Division and marine division exercises, including the loading of 
military equipment onto assault vessels and the support of about 
20 vessels. At the same time, it was explained to personnel 
that Ukrainian military units and Ukrainian National 
Self-Defense detachments were hatching plans for the seizure of 
the Crimea. By these means, the Black Sea Fleet Command proved 
that it was resolutely protecting the Ukrainian Crimea against 
the Ukrainians. 
  One should also note that during these exercises, 43d Rocket 
Army Commander Volodymyr Mykhtyuk was promoted to colonel 
general. This "gift" from the president is explained by the 
fact that the commander eventually stopped vacillating and 
pledged allegiance to Ukraine. Hopefully, this example will be 
followed by other officers. By the way, Ukraine obtained one 
more general in January -- Valeriy Hubenko, head of the State 
Committee for State Border Protection, who was promoted to this 
high rank. 
  It is not difficult to notice that with the ever increasing 
number of generals in the Ukrainian Army, the number of its 
problems is not decreasing. While some of these problems 
require considerable amounts of money and time to resolve, it is 
absurd to make a problem out of introducing the state language 
into the Army, particularly since the former defense minister, 
Gen. Morozov, proved this himself. He learned Ukrainian in a 
short time and spoke it with his subordinates. He also made 
sure that the language became predominate in the military. Once 
the leadership was changed, this process stopped and even 
reversed. Today, all commanders that have already switched over 
to Ukrainian in their everyday operations are forced to make 
their reports in Russian because the Defense Ministry "does not 
understand it well." Maybe they simply do not want to, Mr. 
Radetskyy?

  [Text] The Armenian Foreign Ministry expresses its concern 
over the actions of the Azerbaijani party aimed at stirring up 
the conflict in the region, the ministry's statement published 
in Yerevan on Tuesday says. It underlines that there was a 
recently emerged tendency for internationalization of the 
Karabakh conflict, meaning involvement of foreign advisors and 
recruits and utilization of foreign weaponry by Azerbaijan. 
  The Armenian Foreign Ministry believes that the dangerous 
deterioration of the situation in the region was due to the 
Azerbaijani official strategic policy aimed at resolving the 
conflict in Karabakh by force of weapons. The document says 
that Baku rejected the peaceful proposals put forward by the 
CSCE Minsk group welcomed by Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh, the 
mediating activities of Russia and the appeal of the 
International Olympic Committee's president to establish a 
temporary cease-fire for the period of the winter Olympic Games 
in Lillehammer. 
  The Armenian Foreign Ministry regretted that the 
international community had not blamed Azerbaijan for this.

  [Text] The European Parliament adopted a joint decision on 
10 February in which it expressed its unease over the continuing 
conflict between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis, which has 
created an alarming situation in the region. 
  The text of the decision reads: Concerned about the danger 
of the internationalization of the conflict, the European 
Parliament advises the regional countries and governments and 
all other powerful countries to refrain from providing any 
military assistance to the conflicting sides. 
  Every country, especially Turkey, that neighbors Armenia and 
Azerbaijan is called upon to allow free transport of freight 
destined for both countries. 
  The European Parliament supports the presidency's statement, 
which calls on the sides to show restraint and not to create new 
suffering for the population, which has already suffered cruelly 
because of the war. 
  It reaffirms its adherence to the principle of the 
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and calls on all the 
involved sides to resolve the conflict peacefully by respecting 
the UN Security Council resolutions. 
  Commenting on the European Parliament decision, the Armenian 
Foreign Ministry Press and Public Relations Service expressed 
concern that the document finds the European Parliament 
continuing to tell the international public that the years of 
conflict between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh are a conflict 
between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Identifying the sides directly 
involved and those dragged into the conflict would help them to 
understand the real essence of the conflict and the more 
goal-oriented [word indistinct] of the peace process.

  [Text] 
<H3>  Baku's View on Settlement of Armenian-Azeri 
Conflict </H3>
  In one of its recent issues Interfax-Exclusive acquainted 
its 
readers with the position of the leadership of the 
self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic on ways to unblock the 
bloody conflict in Azerbaijan. Today it is the turn of the 
Azeri side. The state adviser for foreign political affairs of 
Azerbaijan VAFA GULUZADE talks to the Interfax correspondent in 
Baku. 
  IF: The Russian special envoy Vladimir Kazimirov stayed for 
several days in Azerbaijan. He attempted to achieve progress in 
the process aimed at the political settlement of the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict within the framework of the Russian 
mediation. What does Baku think about the visit? 
  GULUZADE: As is known, late in November Vladimir Kazimirov 
was in Baku. He discussed with the Azeri side a Russian plan 
and took into account all our remarks. Then the head of the 
Russian mediatory mission was to leave for Yerevan to discuss 
the plan with the Armenian side. Then his car was fired at from 
Armenian positions. It was a serious incident which was not 
settled immediately because the Armenian side refused to 
apologize. 
  I believe the current visit by Kazimirov to Yerevan and Baku 
is the continuation of the November mission. 
  Russia is the mediator in the conflict and acts accordingly. 
However, the time that has passed since November was missed 
since there were fierce battles at the fronts. There were many 
casualties and there are even now. 
  I put the responsibility for all these developments on the 
Armenian side. Azerbaijan is attempting to solve the problem 
peacefully, through political talks. 
  IF: Namely? 
  GULUZADE: This means that Armenia must withdraw its troops 
from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan. (Yerevan claims 
that involved in the hostilities are the Nagorno Karabakh 
self-defense forces, not Armenian troops--"IF"). This may cause 
the beginning of the talks on the essence of the Armenian-Azeri 
conflict. 
  However, the Armenian side want to stay on the occupied 
territories to settle there and build fortifications. The world 
public does not know about this in full measure. At the same 
time, Yerevan deludes the world public opinion claiming that 
Armenia stands for a peaceful settlement of the conflict and 
fully shares the schedule of the settlement developed by the 
CSCE Minsk Group under which Yerevan put its signature. 
  It took part in the recent meetings of the Minsk Group in 
Vienna, and I say with full responsibility that the Armenian 
side disagrees with the schedule. 
  The signing of the schedule was a diplomatic maneuvering. 
Armenia has added a letter to the signature in which it puts 
some conditions. For example, the Armenian side conditions the 
compliance with the schedule with the guarantee of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh safety in a way seen by Yerevan. 
  On the other hand, Armenians say that they understand the 
notion "side" as the recognition of the Nagorno-Karabakh status. 
Could it be said that the Armenian delegation signed the Vienna 
schedule? I believe now the peaceful settlement of the conflict 
fully depends on the will of the Armenian side. 
  There is a resolution of the UN Security Council and there 
are universally acknowledged norms which say that any talks may 
be conducted only after the occupied territories are liberated. 
In conditions of the occupation of one-fifth of the Azeri 
territory, it is out of the question to speak about any peaceful 
talks, I believe. It is possible to hold a Minsk conference and 
speak about the status of Nagorno-Karabakh only after the 
withdrawal of the Armenian troops. 
  IF: What does the Russian peace plan specify? 
  GULUZADE: The Russian plan mainly coincides with the CSCE 
schedule. It has similar demands and a similar schedule for the 
withdrawal of Armenian troops from the occupied territories. It 
is premature to speak about it once it is not yet coordinated. 
(As is known, later the Azeri side turned down Moscow's 
proposal on cease-fire since February 1 for at least 2-3 weeks 
and put a condition of the withdrawal of the Armenian troops 
from Azerbaijan -- "IF"). 
  IF: Does the Russian peace plan provide for the deployment 
of 
a Russian peacekeeping contingent in the zone of conflict? 
  GULUZADE: There is much speculation around the problem of 
the 
deployment of a Russian or a CSCE peacekeeping force. I believe 
these forces can be deployed.. First, they must be deployed 
along the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia because the 
aggression against Azerbaijan comes from the Armenian territory. 
Second, such forces could be deployed between the warring sides 
after Armenia withdraws its occupation troops from the captured 
Azeri territories. 
  The question about the peacekeeping force was also discussed 
in Rome last year, at the meeting of the CSCE foreign ministers. 
According to the decision taken there, the peacekeeping force 
may be deployed on the territory of this or that state only on 
the country's request, which is the manifestation of respect for 
its Constitution and territorial integrity. Naturally, if we 
wish, we shall apply to Russia. 
  IF: The official Baku demands the withdrawal of the Armenian 
troops from Azerbaijan. Does it mean that they must be pulled 
out from Nagorno-Karabakh, as well? 
  GULUZADE: Logically, from the point of view of justice, all 
Armenian armed forces must be withdrawn fro the territory of 
Azerbaijan. Nagorno-Karabakh is also part of Azerbaijan. 
  According to foreign sources, 8,000 Armenian nationals fight 
on the side of the so-called Karabakh forces against Azerbaijan. 
I believe it is a matter of complete cease-fire and full 
withdrawal of Armenian troops from Azerbaijan. 
  IF: What could be Baku's attitude to the deployment of the 
Russian forces along the border between Azerbaijan and Iran as 
CIS external borders? 
  GULUZADE: I believe it is a matter of the future. For us the 
border between Azerbaijan and Armenia is the most acute problem. 
This was mentioned by President Geydar Aliyev during the visit 
by the commander of the Russian Border Guard troops, General 
Andrey Nikolayev, to Baku. 
  As to our borders with Iran... well, Azerbaijan is a 
sovereign state. It will guard its borders itself. At the same 
time Azerbaijan is a CIS member-state. Baku may negotiate to 
what degree CIS can help ensure common interests. 
  IF: Which is the likelihood of a Moscow meeting between 
presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan which is a common talk over 
the past time? 
  GULUZADE: I believe a relevant political basis should be 
developed for such a meeting. If Russia acts as a mediator, it 
should take into account all factors for the conflict to be 
settled. If so, details could be discussed under Russia's 
auspices. But, by that period, the essence of the problem should 
be coordinated; that is, I repeat, the withdrawal of the 
Armenian troops from Azeri territories. 
  Azerbaijan poses no obstacles for a peaceful settlement. 
This is confirmed by many statements made by President Geydar 
Aliyev. For the peaceful process to start it is necessary that 
Armenia show a desire to such a settlement and make a statement 
that it will withdraw all its troops from Azerbaijan. This 
could be achieved given the goodwill of the Armenian side, and, 
I would say, the due decisiveness of Russia. I want to 
emphasize that Russia has levers of pressure on Armenia. The 
Russian Army is deployed on its territory. It is common 
knowledge that Yerevan uses the fact for acquiring armaments, 
ammunition and even uses Russian servicemen in the above 
conflict. 
  IF: What is known about the date of the meeting? 
  GULUZADE: I do not know anything about the date of the 
meeting. I believe the talks should be an aim in itself. The 
meeting could take place if the mediator will be able to prepare 
the necessary basis for it. Azerbaijan has enough of goodwill 
and constructive approach.

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" from interview with Georgian Head of State Eduard </F>
Shevardnadze by Russian Independent TV Company correspondent 
Nona Andiashvili in Tbilisi on 15 February, conducted in Russian 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Andiashvili] The Georgian Government issued a 
statement in the wake of the events which started on 7 February 
in Abkhazia. The statement says that although the Georgian 
government supports a peaceful settlement of the conflict, it 
will take all necessary measures to protect the Georgian 
population on the territory occupied by the Abkhaz separatists. 
Does this mean that the Georgian side is ready to start 
hostilities against Abkhazia? 
  [Shevardnadze] First of all, I would like to take this 
opportunity to say that we expected a more substantive reaction 
from the relevant Russian authorities, which were well informed 
about this tragedy. There has not been a single statement, not 
a single protest, not a single address condemning this. 
  I do not want Russia's television representatives to feel 
offended, but the information which was sent to them through 
official channels was not conveyed to the public. 
  I think that in this way it will be difficult for us to join 
efforts to solve the conflict peacefully. It is especially 
upsetting that all these dramatic events happened after a very 
successful visit to Georgia by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. 
  As for the part of the Georgian government's statement which 
you mentioned, I think that if we fail to deploy peacekeeping 
forces in the near future -- it does not matter how it happens 
and what proportions it takes -- this will happen spontaneously. 
We are finding it extremely difficult to restrain people, tens 
of thousands of people [words indistinct], a great number of 
weapons on the border in Zugdidi rayon and in other rayons 
adjacent to Abkhazia. 
  We are told openly: If you are not able to defend us, we 
will try to determine our fate ourselves. 
  I am afraid that everything will happen spontaneously and 
then it will be too late to speak about a peaceful settlement 
[words indistinct]]. We are naturally pinning high hopes on a 
Security Council resolution. A Security Council meeting will 
probably be held after the 20th. As regards the Security 
Council, Russia has, I would say, a sensible position there. 
  In principle, we determined our (?common) attitude during 
the 
visit to Tbilisi by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. 
  If this issue [sending peacekeepers to Georgia] is decided, 
then hope for a peaceful settlement remains.

that proceedings have been instigated against his closest

therefore, it is suggested that they be excluded from the list 
of persons accompanying the body of the ex-president; otherwise, 
they will be arrested.

  Under the bill, the islands of Suur-Pakri and Vaike-Pakri, 
as 
well as the Pakri Peninsula, will be transferred to the Padise 
and the Keila administrative districts, while the town of 
Paldiski is to be temporarily administered by the town of Keila. 
Thus, Paldiski may acquire the status of a district of Keila. 
  The bill terminates the authorities of the Paldiski Town 
Council and the mayor elected in 1989. The government has the 
right to restrict entrance into the town until hazardous 
radioactive substances are removed from it. 
  The bill stipulates that the special order of Paldiski's 
administration becomes invalid immediately after the election of 
new local government bodies in the town. 
  The government passed the bill to the parliament.

  [Text] Relations between Lithuania and Russia have improved 
after the withdrawal of Russian troops, but the dialogue "is 
going on with difficulty," the head of the Lithuanian working 
group for talks with the CIS countries, Virgilijus Bulovas, told 
a plenary session of Seimas today. 
  The diplomat regretted that the agreements reached by 
bilateral negotiation on various levels were being "implemented 
worse than was expected." In particular, he said the treaties 
signed during Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit 
to Vilnius had not been enforced yet. 
  The agreements on trade and economic agreements are not 
fulfilled either, because they "got stuck in corridors of the 
Russian power due to unknown reasons," as Bulovas put it. 
  The working group head dismissed the allegations by some 
opposition leaders that the current Lithuanian authorities were 
secretly negotiating Russian military transit to the Kaliningrad 
region and had allegedly signed "some secret protocols." 
  Bulovas said that the Russian side had submitted no 
proposals 
regarding military transit to the Kaliningrad region pointing 
out that "neither open, nor secret negotiations were held on the 
issue."

  [Text] The Russian president's special envoy Vitaliy 
Churkin tonight arrived in Zagreb where he talked to the press 
following his one-day visit to Sarajevo. Churkin described his 
visit to Sarajevo as very encouraging. All three sides are 
contemplating peace rather than a continuation of conflicts, the 
Russian envoy maintains. Asked by a reporter about his view on 
possible attacks by NATO on positions of Bosnian Serbs around 
Sarajevo, Churkin said: 
  [Begin recording of Churkin, in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] Let me explain my attitude. I am 
not speaking as a private individual but as a Russian official. 
First, regardless of what they are telling us, I believe that 
NATO's decision goes beyond what the UN Security Council 
resolutions stipulate. We should have taken it to the UN 
Security Council and then we would have total unanimity in the 
international community's stands. This was feasible since 
basically we are talking about the same views. We would have 
the UN Security Council's authority behind us. I believe that 
this method would have been far better. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb February 16 TASS -- "Problems linked with the 
normalisation of the situation around Sarajevo are extremely 
difficult. They call for serious efforts by all the sides 
involved, but some progress is already showing up. The sides 
involved in the conflict are beginning to think more in terms of 
peace and not military confrontation," special envoy of the 
Russian president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told 
a press conference here on Thursday [as received] after his trip 
to Sarajevo. 
  While in the Bosnian capital, Churkin met leaders of the 
Muslim community and commanders of the Bosnian Serb army, as 
well as representatives of the command of the U.N. Forces in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Russian special envoy said that the 
U.N. Forces were successfully establishing control over the 
heavy armaments of the conflicting sides, emplaced around 
Sarajevo. "It is difficult to say for sure that this process 
will be completed within 2-3 days," Churkin noted, "but the 
actions of the sides are reassuring." 
  The Russian diplomat again stressed the immutabilty of 
Russia's stand. He said that NATO air strikes at positions of 
the Bosnian Serbs could be considered only as an extreme 
measure, permissible in an emergency situation. "In any case," 
he stressed, "it is necessary to realise that this step will 
escalate the Bosnian conflict." 
  Touching on the possibility of a Russian military contingent 
taking part in the NATO-planned operation, Churkin noted that 
there was no reason for this. He does not think it possible 
that Russian soldiers could be sent to an area, where their 
lives and safety will be in danger, as a result of a decision 
adopted without Russia's participation. 
  The special envoy of the Russian president will arrive in 
Belgrade from Zagreb today.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Sidorov: "Intervention or Death! This </F>
Is the Price at Which the Sarajevo Authorities Are Trying To 
Provoke Foreign Interference"] 
  [Text] Do you remember the Sidney Lumet and Henry Fonda 
movie "Twelve Angry Men"? A youth accused of murder is in the 
dock. The jury must bring in a verdict of "guilty" or "not 
guilty" -- a unanimous verdict, moreover. Otherwise, according 
to the law, the jury will have to reconsider the case until they 
all, to a man, reach the same conclusion. 
  The jury member played by Fonda voted against a conviction 
and...found himself alone. By the end of the movie, at the cost 
of an incredible effort, he succeeds in changing the jury's 
mind. A "guilty" verdict proves groundless -- it is based on 
questionable evidence and is passed by jurors who treated the 
accused either with indifference or with prejudice. When doubt 
is interpreted in the accused's favor, this does not mean that 
any court is taking his side in advance. It is the democratic 
norm. So we had only to publish an item on the UN experts' 
report which did not fit in with the version about the Bosnian 
Serbs' involvement in the blast for the West at once to assign 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA to the "pro-Serbian camp." One Russian 
newspaper called our article on this subject "provocative." 
  Right from the start of the Yugoslav conflict KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA 
has not aimed to please anyone or win plaudits. We have always 
been interested only in the real situation and the conclusions 
to be drawn from it. This is the usual approach among the 
military. So it is unscrupulous, to say the least, to interpret 
our desire for objectivity as a manifestation of "pro-Serbian" 
(London's THE TIMES) sentiments or, equally, of "pro-Muslim" or 
"pro-Croatian" sentiments in the Russian Army. In our analysis 
we rely only on facts or on assessments by professionals. For 
example, we basically share the assessment of British General 
Michael Rose, commander of the "blue helmets" in Bosnia, who 
recently said in a BBC interview: "It is surprising that the 
(Muslim) formations which have refused to submit are trying to 
sabotage the cease-fire agreement (reached on the day the NATO 
ultimatum was put to the Bosnian Serbs -- S.S.) and thus prolong 
the suffering of their people in Sarajevo." Only, unlike Gen. 
Rose, we assert that it is not a matter of "formations which 
have refused to submit." It has, all along, been the tactic of 
the present leadership of the Bosnian Muslims to provoke 
military intervention from outside. 
  This conclusion is not unfounded and is based certainly not 
on "reports by the Serbian TANJUG state agency" but on 
long-standing observations and repeated personal conversations 
with Muslim and Serbian leaders in Sarajevo as well as with 
representatives of the UN forces in the Bosnian capital." 
[quotation marks as published] As an argument we publish for 
the first time a highly eloquent document with minor 
abridgments. It is the text of a report by Canadian Gen. Lewis 
Mackenzie, first commander of the UN force's Sarajevo sector, to 
Marrack Goulding, UN under secretary general for peacekeeping 
operations. The document is dated 14 July 1992. 
  "1. The situation in Sarajevo is continuing to deteriorate 
despite the arrival of humanitarian aid and its distribution in 
blockaded regions. We are keeping the airport open at the cost 
of an almost unacceptable degree of risk. Everything could 
collapse overnight. 
  "2. The UN force is being subjected to a slander campaign 
by the (Muslim) Presidency. But their leaders, including the 
president (Izetbegovic), deny this. Meanwhile the campaign of 
persecution is highly effective. The attitude of people on the 
Presidency's side to us is extremely negative. There have 
already been several incidents directed against our officers and 
men while they were discharging their official duties. 
  "3. My conversation yesterday convinced me once and for all 
that the president will agree only to military intervention or 
death for 'his' people as a final solution (his words). Over 
the past few days many opportunities for talks have presented 
themselves, which he rejected. He also rejected proposals from 
functionaries of his party, the SDA (Footnote) (Party of 
Democratic Action), wanting to meet with the Serbs. The 
necessary preparations had been made, but the president decided 
not to approve a meeting until there was a cease-fire throughout 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. My attempts to persuade him to meet with 
the opposing side at a working level, in order to discuss the 
details of demilitarizing the Dobrinja region, came up against a 
solid wall. He made it clear that, if the international 
community is not prepared to intervene, then he is prepared to 
'die twice' rather than have dealings with an 'aggressor.' 
  "The situation in Sarajevo points to the Presidency's desire 
to maintain the current crisis. The majority of the Serbian 
guns are silent, although the Serbs are not free of accusations 
either. As for the Presidency, they are continuing to provoke 
exchanges of fire in an attempt to improve their tactical 
position. It is rather difficult to prove this, although a 
trend can definitely be traced. 
  "Shelling in Sarajevo is now considerably less frequent, 
although the Presidency is continuing to exploit the myth that 
shells are being lobbed into the city. This does not tally with 
reality but is a version published by someone who expects 
foreign military aid. 
  "On the other hand, the Serbs propose that we station 'blue 
helmets' at all their positions, right down to the smallest 
subunit. This is an attractive idea, but I do not possess 
adequate resources or the mandate. 
  "The situation will probably deteriorate unless military 
intervention is undertaken. I personally, however, consider 
such a step impractical. Disappointed as a result of unrealized 
expectations, the Presidency's forces will continue attacking 
the `blue helmets' in an attempt to portray matters as though 
the Serbs are to blame. The artillery shelling of the 
headquarters building last night, which could be repeated, was 
probably carried out from the Presidency side's positions. I am 
most anxious for the military observers in the regions of 
concentration of heavy arms. They are isolated and are virtually 
sitting targets.... I believe that the time for tough decisions 
has come. For obvious reasons they cannot be adopted here. 
With best wishes, Mackenzie." 
  So, how did the Sarajevo leadership's tactic turn out for 
the 
Bosnian Muslims themselves? The hopes of military intervention 
were drawing now nearer, now more remote, but people were still 
dying. Ethnic cleansing was continuing, and numbers of both 
Muslims and Serbs, who were inconvenient to the West, were 
falling. But the Muslims remain the side which has suffered 
most. The number of dead among them long ago topped the 300,000 
mark. 
  As for the role of the mass media in this whole game, this 
is 
a separate topic. Probably never before in the history of 
conflicts has Joe Public been subjected to so many lies and so 
much disinformation. Following the television reports of the 
"Serbian shelling" of a bread line in the Old Town, the UN 
Security Council met and announced sanctions against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. It later came to light that the people 
had died as the result of a mine laid by Muslim extremists. 
London newspapers reprinted a UN experts' report on this, and 
the anti-Serbian campaign eased off a little. Then the 
emaciated figures of "prisoners of Serbian camps" appeared on 
the television screen. But, following inoculation with another 
dose of hatred, it came to light that the shots had been 
falsified, etc. 
  Suffice it to say of the role of official European diplomacy 
only that an ethnic war on an unprecedented scale in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina had been predicted 100 percent by experts in 
the event of a recognition of Bosnia's independence before all 
the contradictions had been resolved around the negotiating 
table. Bosnia's second-largest -- the Serbs -- disagreed 
categorically with secession from Yugoslavia. The majority of 
the Muslim population then was also in favor of a peaceful path. 
It was international recognition of Bosnia that gave the 
original boost precisely to the "party of war" headed by 
Izetbegovic. Now the moderate politician Fikret Abdic, who won 
300,000 more votes than Izetbegovic in the prewar election 
precisely on a platform of interethnic concord, has been forced 
to fight Izetbegovic's gunmen for the right to conclude a peace 
with the Serbs and Croats. Meanwhile the prospects for peace in 
Bosnia remain hazy. 
  Of course we should agree with French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe. After all, the most important thing is not to 
ascertain who was to blame for the recent tragedy in the 
Sarajevo market; the important thing is that people should no 
longer suffer shelling. But, as experience shows, to strive for 
that by increasing pressure on one of the warring sides and, 
still more so, by putting an ultimatum to it means playing into 
the hands of extremist forces among the Bosnian Muslims and 
pouring oil on the flames of the Bosnia conflict.

  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin has assured Premier John 
Major that Russia highly appreciates kind and trustful relations 
with Great Britain. Speaking at an official lunch in the 
Kremlin in honor of the British premier on Tuesday [15 
February], the Russian president stressed John Major's sincere 
attention to what happens in Russia, his real and concrete 
support of democratic reforms in the country. 
  Yeltsin indicated that Russia moves along this path not 
easily, like all countries which have already passed it. "But 
the most important thing is that a reliable foundation, the 
Constitution, has been laid beneath the reform building," 
Yeltsin said. 
  President Yeltsin expressed satisfaction with the talks in 
Moscow and the signed documents, noting that every meeting with 
John Major brings "something new and significant in relations 
between the two countries, brings them closer to each other and 
enriches their cooperation." 
  Boris Yeltsin pointed out that Russia and Great Britain 
share 
common goals and values -- to do everything possible so that 
people live in a safer and more prosperous world, be free and 
not worried about the fate of their children and grandchildren. 
  "Our approaches are not completely the same," the president 
said. "And naturally it is in common interests to find a correct 
and painless way toward reaching this great and noble goal." He 
said this is one of the most important guidelines of the 
Russian-British cooperation.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with British Prime Minister John </F>
Major by unidentified correspondent in Moscow on 15 February; 
Major and unidentified correspondent speak in English with 
superimposed Russian translation--recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed viewers, as you know British Prime Minister 
John Major is in our country on an official visit. Now we offer 
for your attention an exclusive interview which the high-ranking 
guest gave to the Russian television. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, there are different 
symbols and stereotypes: good and bad; a red star, a matreshka 
doll, rockets. For a long time they were the stereotypes of our 
country. What image of Russia do you have now? 
  [Major] I believe that many of the stereotypes you have just 
mentioned have given way to new realities and a new 
understanding. This morning President Yeltsin said that 
relations between Russia and the United Kingdom today are better 
than they had been in past decades. The main reason for this is 
that they have become closer. We know more about one another. 
Trade between our countries is developing, political contacts 
are expanding, and visits of top officials are becoming more 
frequent. The British now have a better understanding of what 
is going on in Russia, and the Russians have a better 
understanding of what Britain supports. 
  [Correspondent] What are the current potential areas of 
disagreement? Can you predict some of them at all? In general, 
we have a good idea as to where our positions are close and 
opinions coincide, but it is no less important to know where 
they do not coincide and how to overcome them. 
  [Major] I will be straightforward. Today in the course of 
the talks we were unable to identify many disagreements. But we 
discovered many areas where we coincide. For example, we 
actively support your reforms. They are rather painful, we know 
that. They are difficult. It is not easy to make the 
transition from the type of system you used to have to a free 
market system, but when the transition is completed, major 
advantages are revealed. At some point in time Russia's 
citizens saw that transformations were occurring in the old 
system, but the price of change entails difficulties, and the 
Russian people are carrying difficulties on their shoulders. 
  It is a time of heavy burdens and a time of change, but at 
the moment the advantages which will be revealed later--they 
will not fail to be revealed--are not very apparent to people, 
because people live for today. That is why the main thing is 
accord and support for bold actions. As we are in a position to 
help, we would like to do so. 
  [Correspondent] Disagreements and a divergence of views 
still 
exist, they exist here and there, but they exist. Where do you 
think they are apparent? 
  [Major] Really, there are not many such areas. Now, in 
bilateral relations between Russian and the United Kingdom the 
number of such disagreements is very small. Where there are 
some, we try to eliminate them. It is an amazing fact that only 
four and five and, even more so, seven and eight years ago, one 
could state numerous disagreements between our countries, and 
nowadays they are hard to find. What can be found straight away 
is accord. Coincidence of views on the issue of the reforms, 
agreement on Russia's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade and on Russia's joining the European Council, 
agreement regarding ways to bring an end to the bloodshed in 
Bosnia and, finally, the agreement, which we signed officially 
today, on not targeting Russian nuclear weapons on Great 
Britain. Our nuclear weapons will not be targeted against 
Russia. We have achieved a great deal of accord. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, in what areas of 
cooperation can you suggest a greater breakthrough was made and 
what prospects are most favorable? 
  [Major] I think that we reached great understanding in the 
economic sphere. There is every possibility of increasing the 
volumes of trade. At present out trade aircraft has just taken 
off, it is still touching the ground and has not yet gained any 
height. The potential for increasing mutual trade is immense. 
The potential for increasing capital investments is equally 
great. What is good for Russia will also be good for Great 
Britain. I think that as the reforms progress, Russia's 
attractiveness for foreign investors will increase sharply as 
stability increases. Then trade turnover with western 
countries, and with Great Britain in particular, will increase 
as a whole. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, would you please say a 
few words directly to Russian television viewers. 
  [Major] We have watched with great admiration from afar how 
in the past four-five years Russia has been carrying out amazing 
political reforms--difficult reforms, complex ones. Five years 
ago the British people could not imagine that your country 
would have a publicly elected president, a new constitution, and 
a democratically elected parliament, whose work can be followed 
on television. Very few people could imagine the considerable 
economic transformations which are taking place in your country. 
  These transformations include a great degree of price 
liberalization, an immense scale of privatization and, finally, 
the determination with which you are advancing toward a free 
market. Of course, this needs time, and this cannot be achieved 
without hard work, sweat, and pain, but I see that Russia and 
Russia's citizens are full of determination to advance in this 
direction and we support you in this.

  [Text] [Correspondent] Prime Minister John Major has spoken 
highly of the results of his visit to Moscow and his talks with 
President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Asked what he 
thinks of the prospects for future development of the 
relationship between the two countries, John Major said: 
  [Begin recording] [Major, in English with superimposed 
Russian translation] I think it will continue to develop 
further. I have invited President Yeltsin to come to Britain 
again this year on a reciprocal visit. I have also invited the 
prime minister. I hope they will come. We are now opening 
doors to political cooperation. We should also be opening doors 
to economic relations even wider. We have enormous opportunities 
here. First of all, it is necessary to increase trade and 
mutual investments -- this will be beneficial for Russia as well 
as for Britain. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] The British premier has also spoken highly 
about the progress of Russian reforms. He noted that, in his 
opinion, many people underestimate how far the Russian reforms 
have already progressed.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy commentary: "Partnership Dialogue </F>
between Russia and Britain"] 
  [Text] In at least one thing British Prime Prime Minister 
John Major has a head start on virtually any European or indeed 
transl-Atlantic politician -- scarcely anyone will be able to 
match him regarding the breadth and charm of his smile, and this 
regardless of the problems confronting Her Majesty's 
Conservative Government headed by John Major. There are enough 
of these problems: the split within the ruling party which is 
gradually coming to a head plus the opposition's attacks on the 
government's domestic economic positions. 
  Nevertheless, John Major is not downcast and he has arrived 
in Russia full, as always, of self-confidence and with a radiant 
smile. The official visit by the head of the British government 
is both symbolic and completely practical in nature. 
  Problems of bilateral relations between Russia and Great 
Britain were discussed during the meeting between President 
Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister John Major in the Kremlin on 
the morning of 15 February and also during talks with an 
enlarged delegation in attendance. Other items also figured on 
the agenda: the general situation in Europe, the CIS, and the 
other states of the former Soviet Union; joint efforts to combat 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and so forth. 
  As was to be expexcted, special attention was paid to the 
Yugoslav crisis during these top-level talks. Our countries' 
concern over the situation in former Yugoslavia and in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, in particular, is understandable. Common 
historical interests, traditional links, and influence in the 
Balkans draw Russia to this region gripped by civil war. 
However, Great Britain too has just as much interest in peace 
in former Yugoslavia. The 1st Motorized Infantry Battalion of 
the Cheshire Infantry Regiment and other subunits, numbering 
around 1,500 men, form part of the Blue Beret contingent in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, since last month the command 
of the UN Forces in Bosnia has been in the hands of a British 
general. A very great deal regarding the current situation in 
both Sarajevo and the republic as a whole depends on the way 
that Lieutenant General Michael Rose sees the situation and ways 
of overcoming the conflict. 
  The Russian and British leaders acknowledge that we have a 
common main goal: the earliest possible end to bloodshed, the 
achievement of a just peace, and a politoical settlement of the 
crisis. However, there are also differences in the sides' 
approaches to the means of achieving that earliest possible end 
to bloodshed. Russia does not regard the NATO decision on the 
possibility of air strikes against Serbian ground positions as 
ideal. Nevertheless, despite all the reservations, there is in 
general a recognition of a lack of will or ability on the part 
of the United Nations to achieve success in the Yugoslav 
settlement, although it is premature to put this down to 
impotence. 
  It is important that our dialogue -- equal, mutually 
respectful dialogue between partners -- continue, and not just 
with the United States but also with traditional European states 
friendly toward Russia, in whose ranks Great Britain rightly 
belongs.

  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- Russia and Germany are in 
different stages of their internal development, but this does 
not lessen the importance of constructive, equal and mutually- 
advantageous relations between them, also along the military- 
political lines. This idea was emphasised during an interview 
with ITAR-TASS on Tuesday by First Russian Deputy Defence 
Minister Andrey Kokoshin after his meeting with Bundeswehr's 
Inspector-General Klaus Naumann. 
  Problems of military-political cooperation and armed forces 
development were discussed during the dialogue. Special 
attention was given to the shaping of the military budget and 
the financing of research. The sides expressed the confidence 
that Russo-German relations are of huge stabilising importance 
not only for Europe but also for other regions. 
  Klaus Naumann will meet on Tuesday with Colonel-General 
Viktor Samsonov, chief of staff for coordination of military 
cooperation of the CIS country. 
  During the visit to last till February 18, Klaus Naumann 
will 
address listeners and teachers of the academy of the general 
staff and will visit the 27th Guards Division of the Russian 
peacemaking forces in the Volga Military District. He will also 
visit Volgograd and St. Petersburg.

<F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Korinenko] </F>
  [Text] Wuensdorf, 15 Feb -- An international inspection 
team has begun work at the positions of the Western Group of 
Forces [WGF] to check that the Russian Federation is complying 
with the provisions of the treaty on conventional armed Forces 
in Europe. The commision will comprise representatives of 
Canada, Italy, France, and Great Britain. As is known, the 
treaty which was signed in Paris on 19 November 1990 provides 
for each participant country to have certain quotas of armaments 
which can be achieved only by reductions in its existing combat 
equipment. 
  The main object of attention for the foreign inspectors who 
will be staying in the WGF's positions until 18 February will be 
the former tank repair works in Wuensdorf which since August 
1992 has been turned into a base for destroying armored 
equipment. 
  As the ITAR-TASS correspondent was told in the WGF press 
center, before the final withdrawal of the Russian forces from 
Germany, it is planned to reduce the armored combat vehicles by 
2,632, which represents 42 percent of the total number of these 
vehicles due to be reduced by the Russian Federation. To date 
2,279 have already been reduced including 1,679 armored 
transports (BTR-60) and 600 infantry combat vehicles. 
  Over the period that the base for the destruction of combat 
equipment in Wuensdorf has been in operation, representatives of 
the states which are signatories to the treaty have carried out 
six inspections. There have been no complaints from the 
inspectors.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Lysenko: "German Police Fear Nuclear </F>
Terror"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- The police are leaning toward the 
conclusion that the Lake Constance air crash (see IZVESTIYA Nos. 
23, 24, and 26) was probably just a clever trick by criminals 
trying to cover their tracks. 
  The Cessna's passengers -- Josef Rimmele and Klaus Eichler 
-- 
were in cahoots with the "Russian nuclear mafia." But the 
Cessna could not have been carrying 70 kilograms of cesium-137, 
since it would have required a four-tonne lead container in 
order to prevent radioactive emissions. A Cessna-425 cannot 
lift that kind of load. 
  The federal police and intelligence service are warning of a 
new threat from the east. The intelligence service submitted a 
report to the FRG chancellor entitled "Nuclear Black Market -- 
Nuclear Terror." 
  German specialists are particularly concerned about the 
increasing flow of radioactive materials from the CIS countries. 
Germany is acting as a staging post in the nuclear trade. In 
1990 the police recorded four instances of "nuclear trade." In 
1992 the figure was 158, while in 1993 there were exactly 200 
attempts to sell radioactive materials. 
  What kind of wares are the businessmen from the CIS 
offering? 
From plutonium and uranium-235 to cesium-137, cobalt-60, and 
strontium-90. 
  One-half of the 300 people suspected of trading in 
radioactive materials are from East Europe. The vast majority 
are citizens of Poland and Russia. According to German 
intelligence data, Kaunas and Vilnius are centers of "illegal 
nuclear activity." 
  German citizens, mainly from the former GDR, are also 
involved in all these attempts to organize the trade in 
radioactive materials. For example, the Cessna's missing 
passenger, Josef Rimmele, had connections with Klaus-Peter 
Nedvig [name as transliterated], son of the former chief of the 
GDR police. His successor, Klaus Eichler, caught Interpol's eye 
after he had attempted to buy a consignment of osmium from a 
Hungarian. 
  The Russian mafia has spread throughout Germany, the German 
papers write. 
  The German police frankly admit that, unbeknownst to state 
institutions, Russian emigres have been able to establish an 
entire network of firms as a front for illegal business. These 
firms are in close touch with criminal groups inside the CIS.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Generals Leonid Ivashov and Viktor </F>
Koslov by Flemming Rose in Moscow; date not given; from the 
MAGASIN section] 
  [Text] Moscow -- "Is it on?" General Leonid Ivashov asked 
nodding at the tape recorder on the table in front of him. 
  "Hm, hm," was the positive response. 
  General Ivashov reached out for his packet of Monte Carlo 
filter cigarettes, lit one, and began to talk about his 
skepticism toward NATO's plan for cooperation with Russia's 
former allies in central and Eastern Europe. 
  "NATO's Partnership for Peace means firstly a creeping 
expansion of the alliance. Second, it means that NATO's armed 
forces will suddenly be standing at Russia's western border," 
the uniformed general said, exhaling smoke into the room. There 
was a knock at the door. 
  "Come in," the general growled, interrupting himself. 
  A servant-like young man wearing a white shirt and a tie 
entered. He was carrying a tray with five cups of freshly made 
coffee and these were placed in front of those present in 
General Ivashov's office: two Russian generals, two Russian 
colonels, and one Danish journalist who would like to hear 
something of what people here at the Staff for the Coordination 
of Military Cooperation in the CIS think about security 
developments in Europe and why Moscow has contacted Denmark with 
a view to military and political cooperation. 
  The serving of the coffee was very discreet and stylish and 
light years removed from what people are used to at the majority 
of Russian restaurants in the city. 
  Each person present had been given a note pad; on the table 
there was a crystal container filled with newly sharpened green 
pencils, mineral water, Coca Cola, and a plate of cookies and 
chocolate waffles. 
  They had really spared no effort. 
  General Ivashov is worried that the world will again be 
split 
into military blocs in competition with each other. According 
to the general, NATO's military cooperation with the former 
Eastern European countries and the Baltic republics is directed 
against Russia. Joint exercises and maneuvers are not something 
you hold for their own sake. 
  "I ask myself the whole time who these military efforts are 
directed against. Is this really necessary? It seems extremely 
doubtful." 
  My question about why Russia itself does not simply sign up 
for NATO's Partnership for Peace gave rise first to a short 
silence. General Ivashov glanced at his colleague, General 
Viktor Koslov, and then answered hesitantly with an apologetic 
smile. 
  "Russia could of course participate, but the question is 
whether Russia wants to. NATO's cooperation model assumes that 
there a first-class allies -- that is, the old members of the 
alliance -- and second-class allies -- those countries which 
must undergo a process of admission which I would not perhaps 
call humiliating... but which would at least mean that Russia's 
legal status in the alliance would for a while be lower than 
that of Denmark and Luxembourg," said General Ivashov, whose 
words were being recorded by a uniformed colonel. 
  Here in the beautiful turquoise-colored building at 
Leningrad 
Boulevard 41 in the northern part of Moscow which was built on 
the initiative of Vasiliy Stalin, the dictator's son, 
immediately after World War II, the Warsaw Pact had its 
headquarters from 1955 up to its dissolution under Gorbachev. 
The CIS countries' defense staff moved into the aristocratic 
building in the spring of 1992. 
  The thermometer on the wall outside the main entrance 
showed minus 17 degrees on this Tuesday morning. The armed guard 
stood to attention and saluted as I drove into the staff's 
courtyard as an official guest. The snow crunched dryly under 
the tires. 
  The Russian generals think that NATO, instead of admitting 
Moscow's former allies by the back door, should begin strategic 
cooperation with the nine former Soviet republics which have 
joined in a collective security agreement in the CIS. It is 
Ivashov's view that the CIS and NATO should then jointly 
guarantee the security of the countries which stretch between 
the two blocs as a neutral belt. 
  "For example, I believe that the Baltic countries and Poland 
would feel just as safe with such an arrangement," said Ivashov, 
who fears that an expansion of NATO to the east will lead to the 
formation of new military blocs. 
  The four officers' uniforms are in contrast with the 
political aspect of the defense cooperation in the former Soviet 
Union. General Ivashov and his colleagues pushed the military 
aspects into the background the whole time and stressed the 
political aspects of cooperation. All decisions are made in 
line with the UN Charter and in consensus as in NATO. 
  It is partly in this context that the recent request from 
Moscow to Denmark with a call for cooperation on conflict 
prevention and peacekeeping operations must be seen. The CIS 
countries are tired of being ignored by NATO and are hoping that 
cooperation with Denmark within the framework of the North 
Atlantic Cooperation council will provide a better opportunity 
to make their voices heard in the international arena. 
  It is refreshing to see that there are no pictures of any 
bigwigs -- either old or new -- on the walls of General 
Ivashov's office. 
  The only decoration -- if you can call it decoration -- is 
the flags of the 12 CIS countries which stand in a row on the 
general's desk. 
  "The agreement on collective security in the former Soviet 
Union gives greater priority to political and international 
legal mechanisms than to the purely military aspect. Our 
experience shows that military intervention does not give rapid 
results, but rather leads a conflict into a blind alley," 
Ivashov said, taking a drink of coffee. 
  The general rejected the suggestion that Moscow is driven by 
imperialist ambitions in the former Soviet Union. Ivashov 
pointed out that in the past Moscow made all the decisions 
alone, and that it was then up to the republics to follow orders. 
  "It is not like that any more. The Soviet Union was a 
unified state. The CIS is a community of independent states. 
The collective security system presupposes civilized rules for 
interaction. Russia has no territorial claims on any country; 
we are all living up to our international commitments in the 
United Nations and the CSCE." 
  The Soviet Union fell apart at the end of 1991. To begin 
with a majority of the former Soviet republics tried to retain 
the Soviet army as a united army. However, these attempts 
failed. For a while the dream of a joint supreme command under 
the CIS lived on. People are now trying instead to cut their 
coat according to their cloth and for this reason the CIS 
command has had its name changed to the Staff for the 
Coordination of Military Cooperation in the CIS. 
  "We have now postponed the efforts to build a joint army 
because of economic difficulties and the political situation. 
Instead we are concentrating on coordination, so that 
individual national armies are built up according to the same 
principles," the general continued. 
  A post of secretary general has been created after the NATO 
model and for the first six months it is being filled by a 
Russian diplomat, Gennadiy Shabannikov, and not by a general, as 
would have been natural in the old days of the Soviet Union. 
  "We have thoroughly studied the lessons that NATO has 
learned 
and we are embracing the positive elements. However, unlike 
NATO we have no combat-ready troops under our command. We only 
have a coordinating role, we do not control armed forces, and 
unlike NATO we are not talking about expanding our area of 
responsibility," said General Ivashov, who did not shy away from 
commenting on new Russian comet and extremist Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's geopolitical ambitions. 
  With a twinkle in their eyes Ivashov and his colleagues 
said that at times you could be tempted to think that the West 
itself has invented Zhirinovskiy to frighten its citizens with 
the danger of fascism in Russia and to use Zhirinovskiy as a 
legitimate argument for expanding the NATO's area of 
responsibility for security policy eastward. 
  "Zhirinovskiy's success in the elections is not linked to 
his 
geopolitical plans. He simply promised every single social 
group something concrete. And people believed this in the light 
of the difficult economic situation. He will have problems at 
the next elections when he will have to explain to the 
population why their lives have not gotten better as he 
promised," said General Ivashov, who asked his amanuensis to 
accompany me as I left through the empty marble halls. 
  Out in the quiet park the February cold bites into your 
face. 
The fir trees are covered with snow. In the middle of the park 
a bird sits on the 3-foot snow drifts -- motionless despite the 
intense cold. 
  What sort of bird is it that has landed here in the CIS 
staff's park? 
  It looks like a raven. 
  It is at least neither a hawk nor a dove. Those sorts of 
birds are no longer suitable for describing what is happening in 
the field of defense policy in the former Soviet Union.

  [Text] Moscow 15 February TASS -- Russian Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev has congratulated PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on their agreement reached at 
bilateral negotiations in Cairo. 
  Russia estimates the Cairo document as a fore-sighted 
political step, that brought Israel and the PLO closer to the 
conclusion of a full-scale agreement on the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho, says a statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry 
circulated here today. 
  The agreements that regulate the implementation of the 
declaration on principles of temporary Palestinian 
self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are the 
result of a compromise. 
  The latter was made possible by thorough work for 
rapprochement of the sides' stands on complicated issues that 
had hampered the negotiations. These are communications, 
including corridors between Jericho and the Gaza Strip, 
security, in particular that of Israeli settlements, and check 
points. 
  The Foreign Ministry believes the most difficult part of 
implementation of the Gaza and Jericho formula has been done. 
  The Arab-Israeli negotiations are part of Russian-Israeli 
foreign political consultations underway in Moscow, said the 
statement.

  [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- A high ranking Russian 
diplomat who refused to be identified, explained here on 
Wednesday [16 February] the Russian position on demands to 
impose sanctions on North Korea in connection with its military 
nuclear programme. 
  According to the opinion the diplomat expressed in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS, talk on sanctions is premature while 
appropriate negotiations are under way, and possibilities of the 
negotiating process have not been exhausted. Besides, this 
issue will be discussed by the forthcoming session of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors. 
  The international community should display flexibility on 
this question and should use all available possibilities, he 
stressed.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 February -- It is politicians, not the 
military, who should decide the fate of the 14th Army deployed 
in the Dniester Region. We are ready to withdraw it as soon as 
tomorrow. This is the opinion of Russian Deputy Defense 
Minister Georgiy Kondratyev. 
  He flies to Tiraspol today. In a conversation with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent on the eve of his trip, the military 
commander said work in "hot spots" was his official 
responsibility. "I should see for myself how our soldier fulfils 
his duties and what he needs". 
  General Kondratyev plans to visit Russian units of the 27th 
division of the Volga military district who, together with 
Dniester Region and Moldovan servicemen, are performing 
peacemaking functions in the region. 
  According to the deputy defense minister, his trip to the 
Dniester Region is a routine one and is not connected with any 
special events in the troops. However, Georgiy Kondratyev said, 
there is bound to be a conversation with Lieutenant-General 
Lebed, commander of the 14th Army, about his "recent comments". 
The two generals will also exchange opinions of the situation 
in the region.

"Russia's Talks With CIS Partners. Central Asia Republics 
Update Their Positions"] 
  [Excerpts] Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan government 
delegations were in Moscow on Saturday. Agreed with Kyrgyzstan 
was the volume of mutual deliveries in 1994. The subject of 
negotiations with Tajik Premier Abdudzhalil Samadov was broader 
-- not only trade and economic cooperation in the current year, 
but also updating the side's positions in connection with the 
republic's joining the ruble zone. [passage omitted] 
  The Tajik delegation faced a more difficult task. Among 
other things, it was to finalize the questions of the country's 
joining the ruble zone. Those were also discussed with Economy 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin and Central Bank Chairman Viktor 
Gerashchenko. Tajikistan received the Bank of Russia's "okay" 
for setting aside for the republic the second batch of 60 
billion rubles in cash to be exchanged for the old money on 
condition that Dushanbe provides collateral in gold. It is this 
condition that proved unacceptable for Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan 
last November when projects for a ruble zone consisting of six 
states were actively discussed. To all appearances, neither can 
Tajikistan, despite the assurances that it is ready to enter the 
ruble zone, fully meet this condition. Instead, Moscow has been 
offered two electric power stations -- the Nurek and the Rogun. 
The Tajik side also promises to introduce into its legislation 
on foreign investments specific changes to safeguard Russia's 
interests. 
  The difficult military-political situation in Tajikistan 
makes the wisdom of such acquisitions rather debatable for 
Russia. A Russian government delegation led by German 
Kuznetsov, deputy minister for cooperation with the CIS 
countries, is leaving for Dushanbe today. The delegation is to 
specify the Russian side's stance on the questions of 
Tajikistan's joining the Russian monetary system.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Viktor Karpov under the "Behind the </F>
Screen of Big-Time Politics" rubric: "The Pechorskiy Rayon 
Card"] 
  [Excerpts] Pskov Oblast -- The Tartu (Yuryev) Treaty of 
1920, on which Estonia bases its current territorial claims to 
Pskov Oblast's Pechorskiy Rayon, is just an "ordinary scrap of 
worthless paper," State Duma Deputy Vladimir Lukin (until 
recently Russian ambassador to the United States) stated in 
Pechory 9 February, explaining that it was concluded on behalf 
of Russia "not by the country or the government but by one of 
the sides engaged in the civil war or, more precisely, by a 
group of antipeople politicians." Citing a telling historical 
parallel, the parliamentarian said that to recognize the Tartu 
Treaty as the foundation of today's interstate relations between 
Russia and Estonia would be like Hetman Semenov, who also signed 
a territorial agreement in Manchuria, concluding a treaty with 
China on the establishment of today's Russian state borders. 
Time itself and the existing historical realities have 
sidestepped and sidelined the unfortunate Tartu Treaty. 
  The statement is as unambiguous as it is significant, for it 
shows that at last a stance is developing on the part of Russian 
parliamentary circles toward the acute "Estonian question" or, 
more accurately, toward the "Pechorskiy Rayon card," which the 
Estonian side invariably plays in order to stymie the so far 
fruitless Russian-Estonian talks on interstate relations. The 
talks have been going on without any progress for a long time 
now because Estonia's appetite for Pechorskiy Rayon acts as a 
stumbling block. And this is evidenced not just in words but in 
deeds, for the "right" to Pechorskiy soil has already been 
enshrined in nothing less than the Constitution of the Republic 
of Estonia. [passage omitted] 
  It is surprising but true that all the Baltic state's 
maneuvers and intrigues were until recently met with drowsy 
indifference or, at best, a wait-and-see approach, thereby 
encouraging those bent on acquiring others' land to engage in 
more and more subversive acts. And here it is not just 
territorial appetites, not just rowdy scenes involving Estonian 
nationalist organizations periodically staged on the Russian 
border. The poisonous seeds of enmity toward Russians nurtured 
in Estonia's political inner sanctum can only cause you to 
wonder. [passage omitted] 
  Only the local authorities, in concert with the oblast 
administration, are now tackling the problem of the border 
territories and endeavoring to issue statements and reassure 
people that "not an inch of Russian soil will be ceded." 
(Incidentally, inhabitants of Pechorskiy Rayon also heard such 
assurances from Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and Chernomyrdin -- and 
what came of that?) Albeit worn out by the uncertainty, the 
inhabitants of the border region do nevertheless regard these 
statements with mistrust -- Pskov, after all, is not Moscow, 
where big-time politics is played, and they do not believe that 
the Russian authorities are capable of protecting them. 
  Thank God that the Pechorskiy Rayon question is finally 
being 
taken up in earnest by Russian parliamentarians, and 
high-ranking ones at that: Namely V. Lukin, chairman of the 
State Duma International Affiars Committee, and V. Podoprigora, 
chairman of the Federation Council's identically named 
committee. During their one-day trip to Pechorskiy Rayon they 
studied the work of the border control points and the problems 
of providing a border infrastructure, and met with customs 
officials, border guards, and representatives of the rayon 
public. A conference to sum up the results in which Oblast 
Governor V. Tumanov took part was held at the rayon 
administration. 
  "The aim of our trip was to study all the conflicts 
surrounding the "Pechorskiy Rayon question'" V. Podoprigora said 
in summation, "and to convey the full acuteness of the 
prevailing situation to parliament, the government, and the 
president. In our view, it is essential that special 
parliamentary hearings be held on this question to elaborate at 
last a clear Russian stance and to spur the supreme authorities 
to take practical measures to disavow the 'Pechorskiy card' once 
and for all." 
  It is time, high time this were done!

  [Text] Mechyslaw Hryb, Chairman of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet, received a delegation of the national strike committee 
sent to him by participants of the big rally in Minsk. 
  According to Interfax's sources, Hryb emphasized that the 
Supreme Soviet, which is to be convened one of these days, would 
discuss a new Constitution, in particular the state structure. 
  He promised the delegation that the petition he had from 
them 
would be discussed at the next Thursday's meeting of the Supreme 
Soviet presidium. 
  People's Deputy Sergey Antonchik, a strike committee member, 
said that the indefinite strike in the republic was continuing. 
The next rally will be held on Independence Square in Minsk on 
February 22, when parliament is scheduled to be reconvened. 
  Our correspondent in Minsk reports that the rally, attended 
by a crowd of about 6000, has moved from Independence Square to 
outside the parliament building. 
  Now the rally demands that the national strike committee be 
given 15 minutes on the television immediately after the evening 
news program, reinstatement Vladimir Yegorov as interior 
minister as well as resignation of the cabinet and dissolution 
of parliament. 
  Yegorov had been dismissed for allowing the arrest and 
removal to Vilnius of Lithuanian communist leaders Mikolas 
Burokevicius and Juozas Jermalavicius. 
  Belarusian Deputy Interior Minister Konstantin Platonov told 
Interfax that no trouble had erupted during the rally or march 
towards the parliament building. 
  He did not rule out the possibility, however, that "measures 
will be taken" against strike committee activists. For one 
thing, they had staged a rally on Independence Square where no 
public events other than national holidays can be held. What is 
more, the rally had not been authorized. 
  Platonov also said that the activities of the committees 
were 
illegal because it had not been officially registered.

  [Text] Belarusian Strike Committee Spokesman Alyaksandr 
Lysenka has told BELAPAN that rallies demanding early elections 
and the resignation of the government were held today in Minsk, 
Mogilev, Soligorsk, Zhodino, and Vileyka. Assessing the 
workers' actions, Lysenka pointed out: "This is a success. The 
situation in the Republic is so complicated that people found it 
hard to make the decision to join the political strike. 
However, mass actions did take place and tens of thousands of 
people took part in them. We believe that we will soon see the 
real political results of this undertaking." 
  Lysenka underlined that if the Strike Committee Council 
receives no answer to its petition by 1300 [1100 GMT] on 22 
February, the general political strike will be resumed on the 
morning of 23 February. The same will happen if the 
administration begins persecuting the organizers of the action. 
  Meanwhile, Kebich's Press Secretary Uladzimir Zamyatalin 
pointed out that "the ultimate decisive battle" urged by the 
strike's organizers had not taken place. Zamyatalin added that 
"common sense prevailed. This proves that our society is moving 
toward democracy."

<F P=106> [Correspondent Aleksandr Starikevich report: "Strike in </F>
Belarus Has Not Been General, But Situation Is Tense"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The first few hours of the strike give no 
grounds for concluding that any one has won the strike committee 
versus government confrontation. A draw seems to be the most 
likely outcome of the first round of the strike. 
  Right until the last moment the republic authorities did 
everything they could to slow the strike movement down somewhat. 
The day before several people who distributed pro-strike 
leaflets were arrested by the militia. Printing of SVABODA, one 
of the largest democratic newspapers, was wrecked thanks to an 
anonymous phone call. The telephones and the heating have been 
cut off at the republic strike committee building itself, so 
strike committee representatives lack complete information at 
present as to what is happening on the ground. They know that 
some workers at Soligorsk's no. 3 mine have joined in the 
strike. The management of that enterprise is threatening to 
count strike days as absenteeism. The strike committee members 
consider that a reliable picture of what is happening will 
become clear as evening approaches, but meanwhile they could be 
receiving both accurate information and disinformation. 
  Your IZVESTIYA correspondent visited several enterprises in 
the Belarusian capital in the morning, including notably Belvar 
and Tranzistor, which are the most explosive centers. But so 
far those plants are working as normal. They began paying out 
wages at Belvar at 0800 hours. 
  By 1100 hours around 5,000 people were gathered on Minsk's 
main square in front of the parliament building. These included 
representatives of the wheeled truck tractor, automated 
production line, and other Minsk plants. The demonstrators were 
kept back from the government residence by a cordon of 
militiamen. A rally began at which strike committee leaders and 
people's deputies of the Republic of Belarus spoke. 
  "I think that everything has begun better than could have 
been expected," Sergey Naumchik, one of the parliamentary 
opposition leaders, told your correspondent. "Those already 
gathered in the square and demanding the resignation of the 
government and the Supreme Council will be joined by others. I 
think that the strike will be wave-like in nature: It can fall 
and then rise. At any rate, the main events are due in the 
spring." 
  The strike committee members who spoke in the square hold 
roughly the same opinion. According to them, the strike is 
conceived as a permanent process. They think that from today 
the strike movement will be in the ascendant. 
  At the same time statements about either the success or the 
failure of the strike seem somewhat optimistic. On the one 
hand, the majority has not joined in the action so far. Thus 
one could say that the strike committee's efforts as of midday 
15th February have not yielded great results. But the 
nonaligned majority has not demonstrated support for the 
government either but has merely exploited the situation to 
extract the maximum material benefit out of it in the form, for 
example, of wages, which many had not received for two to three 
months. The government's carrot-proferring tactics are 
undoubtedly good, but, given that the stocks of those carrots 
are nearing their end, it is not clear what will restrain the 
workers next time. The strike committees have also shouldered a 
burden in this situation which they will scarcely be able to 
deal with: It will be virtually impossible to motivate people 
who are in the main politically apathetic by means of purely 
political demands.

  [Text] The nationwide indefinite political strike declared 
for 15 February ended early. Not a single worker in Minsk went 
out onto Independence Square in support of the demands of the 
strike committees. There was a rally on Independence Square. 
Among the speakers, there were only representatives of the 
strike committees and the BPF [Belarus People's Front]. They 
sharply criticized the government and the Supreme Soviet. From 
Independence Square, the people in the rally proceeded in a 
column to the Supreme Soviet building, where they passed on 
their demands to Chairman of Supreme Soviet Mechyslaw Hryb. The 
demands include the resignation of the government and elections 
to the Supreme Soviet in March. In the opinion of the ralliers, 
the speaker should give his reply not later than 22 February, 
the day the Supreme Soviet resumes work. The latest rally on 
Independence Square is set for precisely that time. The members 
of the strike committee are continuing to carry out 
organizational work, calling on the workers to strike.

  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit 
to Minsk has been repeatedly postponed due to a difficult 
situation in Russia, chief of the Belarusian government's 
Information Department Vasiliy Dragovets reported to Interfax. 
  In his words, Belarus' Council of Ministers has no grounds 
to 
think that the delay in the trip is connected with 
Chernomyrdin's unwillingness to sign documents on creation of a 
monetary union between two countries. 
  "Russian and Belarusian premiers have firmly agreed to unite 
monetary systems," noted Dragovets. 
  Referring to the opinion of the chairman of the Belarusian 
Council of Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, Dragovets said that the 
final date of Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Minsk would be 
coordinated after conclusion of the British Prime Minister John 
Major's visit to Moscow.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valdis Birkavs, prime minister of the </F>
Republic of Latvia, by Pol Mathil; place and date not given: "On 
Latvia, `Partnership For Peace'"] 
  [Text] [Mathil] With your accession, the three Baltic 
states are among the first eight countries to adhere to the 
Partnership for Peace. Do they have a particular reason for 
being in such a hurry? 
  [Birkavs] We are not in any more of a hurry than anyone 
else, 
but you only need to look at the map to understand. For us, 
security has its own dynamic, its own timetable, and nothing can 
be done before its time comes, and nothing after it has passed. 
I believe that now is the time. 
  [Mathil] Why precisely now? Have the results of the Russian 
elections exerted any pressure on the timetable? 
  [Birkavs] Certainly. After the Russian elections I stated 
that security was now the number one issue. We are very close 
neighbors, we are deeply interested in developments inside 
Russia. 
  [Mathil] Should we consider that you place yourself within 
what the Russians term as the "near abroad" where, in the words 
of Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev, Moscow has "legitimate 
interests"? 
  [Birkavs] Of course not. Admittedly, we are neighbors and I 
suppose will always remain so. Unfortunately, Mr. Kozyrev said 
some very muddled things about Russian "interests" in the Baltic 
states, without ever really explaining what this means. 
  [Mathil] It is this Monday also that discussions on the 
withdrawal of Russian soldiers are due to restart in Riga. How 
many remain in Latvia? 
  [Birkavs] About 10,000. 
  [Mathil] You are going to leave a major radar base in 
Skrunda 
(150 kilometers west of Riga) in Russian hands for another four 
years, followed by 18 months to dismantle it. Is it true that 
you agreed to this under pressure from NATO and the European 
Union? 
  [Birkavs] Clinton and Yeltsin set this timetable at their 
last summit. This compromise will be debated by our parliament. 
We do not want to adopt too rigid a position with regard to the 
West, but nothing will be done without parliament's approval. 
  [Mathil] Why is this base so important to the Russians? 
  [Birkavs] It is just one aspect of the pressure they are 
exerting on us. The Russians have three instruments: Their 
army, the Russian-speaking minority, and economic dependency. 
The military question is now being settled. The nationality 
law is being debated by parliament. We must face the 
consequences of a genuine colonization. 
  [Mathil] Do you accept dual nationality? 
  [Birkavs] Never. 
  [Mathil] There remains economic dependency: The Russian 
government has just threatened to cut off gas supplies to Latvia 
for non-payment of its debt. 
  [Birkavs] This debt does not exist. We signed an accord with 
GazProm (Russian gas company) which Moscow has unilaterally 
cancelled. 
  [Mathil] Is not the general manager of GazProm none other 
than Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's present prime minister? 
  [Birkavs] Yes. He knows that we owe them nothing. They are 
trying to make gas a political issue. That is how dependency is 
created, it is not only economic. 
  [Mathil] Do you believe the `Partnership For Peace' can help 
you to overcome this type of difficulty, and free you from 
various forms of dependency? 
  [Birkavs] The Partnership is a major step in the right 
direction, but it is no more than a step, the first step toward 
a satisfactory security structure. It contains no formal 
guarantee. 
  [Mathil] What is your analysis of the situation in Moscow? 
  [Birkavs] If the Russians really carry out the economic 
reforms they will have to face a number of very difficult years, 
but after that their prospects will be favorable. If they do 
not carry out the reforms, they will also have a number of very 
difficult years, with no other prospect in view. In other 
words, in two years time, at the time of the presidential 
elections, the situation is in any case going to be very tense 
and a radical and nationalist president could be voted into 
power. 
  [Mathil] You are not very optimistic. What to do about 
Russia? 
  [Birkavs] Recently, when I attended the economic forum in 
Davos everyone asked me that same question. Nobody had the 
answer. 
  [Mathil] How do you explain that Russia has not yet reacted 
to the `Partnership for Peace'? Do you think there is a debate 
on this subject within the Kremlin? 
  [Birkavs] Yes, I believe so. When we had to take a decision 
on this question, we consulted all the political forces in the 
country. It would be natural for such a debate to take place in 
the Kremlin. 
  [Birkavs] What do you think of NATO's ultimatum in Sarajevo? 
Do you think it sets a precedent? Would you like to see NATO 
intervene in a similar way in other European conflicts? In the 
Baltic region for example? 
  [Birkavs] Faced with a situation as explosive as in the 
former Yugoslavia, you must adopt a very strong but also a very 
prudent position. The NATO ultimatum satisfies these criteria. 
It is a positive step. It is just one means of action. We 
will see the result.

  [Text] Latvian Prime Minister Birkavs told journalists 
today that Latvia will actively--dependent on financial 
possibilities-- start cooperating within the framework of the 
NATO Partnership for Peace program. Birkavs comments came 
following his return from Brussels. On Monday in Brussels, 
Birkavs confirmed with his signature Latvia's agreement to the 
new NATO program. 
  Latvia will initially participate in the formation of a 
Baltic peacekeeping battalion, arranging its military structures 
so they correspond with NATO standards. Moreover, Latvia will 
try to use all the information received from the NATO, as well 
as taking part in NATO exercises and various educational 
seminars.

  [Text] Russian chief negotiator in talks with Latvia Sergey 
Zotov told INTERFAX that agreement was reached on two of the 
four papers on Russian pullout at the fresh round of talks, now 
under way in the resort town of Jurmala outside Riga. Both of 
them are ready for initialling, he said. 
  The question is one of the two draft deals on the withdrawal 
of Russian troops by August 31 and social security nets for 
servicemen over an interim period. Zotov says this provides for 
the servicemen's right to privatize their housing before selling 
it to local residents and to take out or transfer property to 
their relatives in Latvia and other property guarantees. 
  The two sides are holding further talks on Russia's radar 
installation at Skrunda and an agreement on social security 
safeguards for retired Russian servicemen residing in Latvia. 
  Moscow and Riga are still wide apart on the amount to be 
paid 
for the leasing of the facility. 
  Russia put forward a new proposal agreeing to pay in fuel 
exports to Latvia in exchange for the use of the installation, 
the diplomat said. 
  Earlier, agreement had been reached that Moscow would 
continue using its advanced warning radar station in the next 
four years and take a further 18 months to dismantle it. 
  On social security safeguards for retired Russian 
servicemen, 
Zotov said that differences remained on granting permanent 
residence to those who retired after Latvia gained independence 
in August 1991. (The Latvian bureau for monitoring Russian troop 
withdrawals puts their numbers at about 15,000 - IF) 
  "Russia will never renege on its demand that all Russian 
servicemen retiring before January 28, 1992 be granted permanent 
residency in Latvia even if the whole deal on troop withdrawals 
has to be thrown out", Zotov said. 
  The latest round is to end on Thursday but not on Wednesday 
as planned before.

  [Text] Jurmala, Latvia, Feb 15, BNS -- The issue on the 
rent or compensation Russia would pay Latvia for operating the 
military radar in Skrunda "is in the stage of discussion," chief 
Latvian negotiator Martins Virsis told reporters. 
  Virsis evaded from saying concretely whether Latvia will 
accept the Russian-proposed rent of 2 million U.S. dollars per 
year. 
  Russian chief negotiator Sergey Zotov told reporters today 
that Russia would be forced to extend the deadline of troop 
withdrawal if Latvia wanted more than 2 million dollars a year 
for the radar's operation. 
  On the one hand, Virsis said, Latvia was aware of Russia's 
economic problems but, on the other hand, the sum could also be 
regarded as too small. 
  In addition, Russia initially wanted to keep 900-member 
personnel in the station. During the negotiations, Russia 
agreed to cut the number of military personnel by a third if the 
civil staff is respectively increased. 
  Commenting on the dismantling of a newly-built installation 
in the territory of the Skrunda compound, Virsis said Russia "in 
principle agreed to pull it down but said it had no money to 
accomplish the task." 
  Russia wouldn't mind if Latvia helped it dismantle the 
installation, Virsis said. 
  Virsis abstained from predicting on the outcome of the 
talks. 
  As reported, Russia proposed Latvia to complete troop 
withdrawal by the end of August if Latvia allowed it keep the 
Skrunda radar for four years and dismantle it in 18 months. 
  The Latvian cabinet is expected to accept the proposal.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lashch report: "The Latvian Administration </F>
Harasses a Russian General"] 
  [Text] Another conflict has occurred in Latvia between a 
Russian general and the local authorities. The Latvian 
Citizenship and Immigration Department has confiscated from 
General Anatoliy Gaponov his USSR passport. Yesterday 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY learned some details of the incident. So far 
there has been no reaction from the Russian Defense Ministry. 
  It is noteworthy that the decision to confiscate the 
passport 
from the general was made by Andrejs Rucs, chief of the Vidzemsk 
district in Riga. Rucs is known for the fact that at the end of 
January he ordered two Russian generals, Vodopyanov and 
Taylakov, to be handcuffed and arrested. Their arrest led to 
the disruption of a regular round of the Russian-Latvian 
negotiations on the status of the Russian radar station in 
Skrunda while Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev put troops 
stationed in Latvia on high alert. After that incident the 
Latvian government ruled to dismiss Rucs from his post while the 
prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against him. Later 
on, however, deputies of the local council reinstated Rucs in 
his post. Apparently, after receiving a vote of confidence, 
Rucs has launched a harassment campaign against the Russian 
generals. 
  Rucs' first step in this direction has been an order to 
confiscate the passport from Russian General Anatoliy Gaponov. 
First, the local Latvian authorities invited General Gaponov to 
vacate his apartment. After the general's representative 
arrived at the Citizenship and Immigration Department with 
General Gapanov's passport to obtain documents confirming the 
legitimacy of the general's presence on Latvian territory, 
Latvian officials confiscated Gaponov's ID. According to the 
department leadership, he is simultaneously a private individual 
(by his passport) and a military serviceman (by his ID), which 
contradicts Latvian law. 
  A department employee, who asked not to be identified, said 
in a conversation with KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent that he 
has no information on this case: "The question of legality or 
illegality of confiscating the passport will be decided at the 
working level." Furthermore, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent 
has learned, the Latvian prosecutor's office is undertaking its 
own investigation into the incident with the Russian general. 
  Dmitriy Rogozin, chairman of the Congress of Russian 
Communities, told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent that he was 
not surprised by what has happened: "This is not a precedent but 
a relapse which will recur again and again. The arrest of 
Generals Vodopyanov and Taylakov and the seizure of Gaponov's 
passport is aimed at humiliating Russia and its officials."

  [Text] Riga, Feb 15, BNS -- The U.S. Army assistance 
chief, Owen Moon, left Latvia Saturday [12 February] after 
having headed the group for 10 months. His successor, Colonel 
Wayne Koppa, is scheduled to arrive this week. 
  During Moon's office, 33 U.S. defense delegations visited 
Latvia and consulted Latvian specialists in medicine, law, civil 
control over military structures and other specific issues. 
  Fifteen groups of Latvian defense officials joined various 
U.S. government-sponsored workshops and courses in America, 
Latvian Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis told reporters. 
  The U.S. Army assistance group consists of five specialists. 
It aims at helping Latvia create democratic armed forces after 
the Western sample. 
  Moon spoke highly of the skills of Latvian defense foces 
which have been achieved by minimal budget resources. But he 
criticized the centralized Soviet-style military administration 
as blocking Latvia from efficient integration into the European 
security structures.

  [Text] The Information Department of the Tajikistan's 
Foreign Ministry reported to INTERFAX that on Monday a frontier 
post deployed on the section of the 12th frontier post of the 
Moscow frontier department on the Tajik-Afghan border was fired 
at by four jet shells. The adversary's firing hardware was 
damaged by counterfire. The same day a frontier detachment 
stationed on the section of the Khorog frontier came under small 
arms fire from Afghanistan territory. No casualties are 
reported. 
  On the whole, Tajikistan's territory and Russian frontier 
detachments have been subjected to shelling from the Afghan 
territory 18 times over the month and a half of this year, said 
leader of the Information Department of the Tajik Foreign 
Ministry Zafar Saidov. In his words, this creates conditions 
for further destabilization of the situation on the Tajik-Afghan 
border.

<F P=106> [Sergey Knyazkov report: "Trouble on Banks of Dniester. </F>
14th Russian Army Once Again Center of Worsening 
Moldovan-Dniester Relations"] 
  [Text] The closer the early elections to the Moldovan 
parliament scheduled for 27 February get, the tenser the 
atmosphere in the republic becomes. In all, 1,024 candidates 
from 13 parties and blocs and 12 independent candidates are 
running for 104 seats in the new parliament. But the election 
represents not merely a formal change of deputies in Moldova's 
top legislative body, but also a kind of referendum on the 
future path of the state's development. 
  The Agrarian Democratic Party, clear favorite in the 
election 
marathon, is in favor of preserving state independence. The 
Socialist, Social Democratic, and other parties are fighting for 
votes with similar programs. To counterbalance them, the 
People's Front of Moldova and the "Civic Alliance of Romania" 
have come up with the idea of uniting the republic with Romania. 
But, according to the Moldovan Embassy in Moscow, these ideas 
have the backing of no more than 8 percent of the population. 
  The alarm over the possibility of more bloodshed seems not 
unfounded. In the Dniester Region, for instance, the creation 
of polling places and technical groups to hold the elections is 
forbidden. Dniester Moldovan Republic [DMR] President Igor 
Smirnov's edict introducing a special situation came into force 
20 January. Admittedly, the Central Electoral Commission is 
examining the possibility of organizing a ballot on the Right 
Bank of the Dniester for Moldovan citizens resident in Left Bank 
rayons. Despite Gagauz leaders' refusal to take part in 
elections, polling places will also be set up in some rayons of 
southern Moldova with compact Gagauz communities. 
  The 14th Russian Army has once again taken center stage in 
politics. After Commander Aleksandr Lebed announced the policy 
of "armed neutrality," it stopped the war between Moldova and 
the Dniester Region. DMR power structures are now accusing 
Lebed of attempting a coup d'etat, preparations for which 
allegedly began back in January last year. That naturally 
brought retaliation. In a statement disseminated by the mass 
media the 14th Army's Military Council drew attention to the 
exacerbation of the situation in the unrecognized DMR. The 
leadership of the 14th Army accused the managerial apparatus of 
the DMR of being corrupt and merging with the criminal world, 
which has created over 200 criminal groupings in the Dniester 
Region. Official circles in Moldova and the Dniester Region 
have been warned that they must abandon their illusions as to 
the possibility of resolving matters in the region by strong-arm 
methods. People organizing armed provocations from the Left 
Bank of the Dniester, the statement says, will be severely 
punished for attempting to unleash conflict. If large-scale 
armed provocation arises, no matter who is behind it, the 14th 
Army reserves the right to "cool overly hot heads."

Taranu, said that the Russian Federation is promoting a 
two-faced policy toward the Republic of Moldova and that the 
withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army from the territory of his 
country is being postponed deliberately, our correspondent 
Mircea Dascaliuc reported. 
  The eighth round of negotiations on the terms and conditions 
of the 14th Army withdrawal will not take place very soon, Mr. 
Taranu also said, for the simple reason that the Russian 
Federation hopes that after the 27 February elections in the 
Republic of Moldova, the Chisinau Parliament will include forces 
prepared to yield more easily and thus concessions may be 
obtained.

  [Text] Tiraspol -- The Dniester Moldovan Republic [DMR] 
Supreme Soviet has adopted an appeal to the UN secretary 
general, the CSCE, the worlds' parliaments, and the CIS 
countries. As we know, it points out, elections to neighboring 
Moldova's parliament are taking place 27 February in which the 
DMR is not participating. The DMR's nonparticipation 
essentially signals the Dniester Region's de jure separation 
from the Republic of Moldova. 
  The Moldovan authorities are making every effort to ensure 
that the elections do actually take place on DMR territory. 
Alongside the concentration of Moldovan armed formations on the 
border with the DMR, an attempt is being made to assail the 
Dniester Region from inside. It is being made first and 
foremost by General A. Lebed, commander of the Russian 
Federation 14th Army, and M. Bergman, commandant of the Tiraspol 
Garrison, around whom the local neobourgeois forces are 
grouping. Recently, Lebed more or less openly set out to 
overthrow the DMR's leadership by force. The general and his 
closest aide, Bergman, are appealing for a "march with 
pitchforks" against the organs of power, promising "to provide 
material assistance for the funerals" of the republic's 
leadership, as well as other such statements. 
  In its appeal, the republic's parliament requests the United 
Nations, the CSCE, the world's parliaments, and the CIS 
countries to urgently send observers to the DMR with a view to 
"preventing the worsening of the economic blockade and the 
outbreak of armed conflict."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Fyodor Angeliy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau February 16 TASS -- The future Moldovan 
parliament, which will be elected on February 27, should begin 
its work by solving the Dniester and Gagauz problems, should 
seek ways to surmount the country's deep crisis by political 
methods alone, taking into account the interests of all the 
sides involved and making concessions to each other for the sake 
of Moldova's integrity and independence," speaker of the 
Moldovan parliament Petr Luchinsky told TASS. Luchinsky is 
taking part in the election race as candidate from the 
Agrarian-Democratic Party of Moldova. 
  "The people of Moldova," he noted, "had to pay a high price 
for the adventurism and incompetence of politicians of the 
national- patriotic hue, who landed in the republic's governing 
structures by sheer chance. Blood was spilled. It will take 
not only the present generation, but many generations to come to 
disentangle this tangle. This is why the problem of the Dniester 
area and the southern part of the country should be regarded as 
the two most important issues," the speaker believes. 
  In his opinion, there are ways to solve the Dniester 
problem. 
One of them presupposes a gradual elimination of crisis 
phenomena within the bounds of an integral Moldovan state. "The 
Chisinau authorities should offer the Tiraspol leaders to 
restore a single budget and thereby lay the foundation for an 
early stabilisation of industrial production. A law should be 
drawn up at the same time guaranteeing a special legal status to 
the left-bank areas of Moldova, Luchinsky stated. He favours 
the eventual transfer of many governing functions to the 
regional authorities, which will placate the people. 
  The speaker of the Moldovan parliament noted that initially 
the Tiraspol leaders seemed to accept this idea. "But somewhat 
later their unwillingness to bring this seemingly found solution 
of the Dniester conflict to a logical end became apparent again. 
Ambitiousness, typical for them, and unwillingness to cooperate 
in the spirit of consensus, has obviously taken the upper hand 
and they are going out of their way to secure the republic's 
final dismemberment," he stated.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau February 16 TASS -- The breakaway southern 
Gagauz region of Moldova, which earlier refused to participate 
in parliamentary elections, has now changed its mind. Another 
breakaway region, that of Dniestr, has eased its negative 
attitude to elections. 
  President of Gagauz region Stepan Topal agreed to hold 
elections to Moldovan parliament on the territory of the region 
after talks with Moldovan Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli late on 
Tuesday [15 February]. 
  Earlier the Gagauz leadership conditioned the holding of 
elections by receiving the status of autonomy, while Moldovan 
President Mircea Snegur urged the Gagauz region to drop 
preliminary conditions, join the new parliament which would then 
solve the problem of the status. 
  It was agreed that polling stations will be open across the 
whole of the Gagauz region, Sangheli told TASS on Wednesday. 
  "This will undoubtedly result in a stabilisation of the 
situation, will strengthen mutual understanding bewteen various 
nationalities in Moldova", Sangheli commented adding that the 
final decision on the Gagauz participation in elections will be 
adopted by the local parliament on Thursday. 
  Also on Wednesday authorities of the Dniester region said 
they would not obstruct citizens wishing to take part in the 
parliamentary elections in Moldova, but reiterated there would 
be no election on the teritory of the region. 
  The press service of Igor Smirnov, the president of the 
unrecognised Dniester Republic, issued a statement saying that 
the Tiraspol authorities would continue to boycott the elections 
and would not open any voting stations on their territory. 
Nevertheless, they will not prevent citizens from crossing over 
to the other side of the Dniester River on the day of the 
elections in order to cast their ballots at voting stations 
there. 
  The Dniester leader invited observers from foreign states, 
including CIS countries, to come to the Dniester Republic and 
see on the spot that this assurance is fulfilled.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Shakhnoza Ganiyeva from Uzbekistan, </F>
including recording of remarks by K. Usmanov, head of 
Uzbekistan's Radio and Television Production Association; from 
the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] Ostankino TV's channel one and Russian TV were 
disconnected from 0900 this morning until this evening in 
Uzbekistan. The republican TV center did not receive these 
programs either. I remind you that transmission of Novosti 
programs has been partially disrupted here for almost a week. 
During the day viewers in the republic have only been able to 
see two editions of Novosti from Ostankino, at 1200 and 2100 
local time. Other programs were screened without alteration, 
but clearly, the chronic problem of non-payment has finally 
caught up. We turned to the republic's communications ministry 
for an explanation: 
  [Usmanov] The primary reason is that the Ostankino and 
Russian TV companies owe the Uzbek communications ministry about 
1 billion rubles for 1993. Second, no contracts have yet been 
signed for 1994. We sent off telegrams asking these TV 
companies to dispatch representatives so that contracts for 1994 
can be concluded. 
  [Ganiyeva] Well, at the end of the day, a sovereign state is 
entitled to relay or not to relay programs from Russia, but 
what, in that case, can viewers do? They are starved of both 
bread and circuses.

The 265 state farms remaining in the republic will adopt other 
forms of economic operation. 
  Relays of "Ostankino" news have also been terminated. The 
cap on broadcasts from Moscow is explained in Tashkent by the 
fact that "Ostankino" chiefs have not signed an accord on 
relaying their programs to Uzbekistan in 1994. The other 
programs (with the exception of news) of the "Ostankino" channel 
continue to be relayed to Uzbekistan in full.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1645 GMT on 15 February carries an 
untitled recorded program in which Sergey Filatov, presidential 
chief of staff, reviews last week's political events with an 
unidentified interviewer. 
  An introductory comment says: "Last week did not abound in 
vivid domestic policy events." What actually happened was that 
the State Duma, "which has not yet adopted a single important 
law," discussed the question of moving out of the old mayor's 
office and into the White House. It also set up a commission to 
look into the events of 3-4 October. Members of the old and new 
economic schools continued to argue about future government 
policy. "The president reduced his activities owing to illness. 
That may be why the latest package of decrees signed by him did 
not look as impressive as during the previous week." 
  After briefly surveying the various decrees on personnel 
changes, Filatov says: "In accordance with a directive from the 
president, the signing took place of a protocol on political 
consultations between the Russian Federation and the Republic of 
Azerbaijan. In general, I must say that it is a very good 
document, since it does place on a permanent footing the 
dialogue between the leadership of these republics at various 
levels and on all matters, and that is precisely what is said in 
the document, which is to be signed by the Foreign Ministry on 
the instructions of the president." 
  Asked about moves to bring the president into conflict with 
parliament, Filatov looks at the three possible sites that 
parliament could occupy, according to a suggestion from Lukyanov 
-- the Kremlin, Old Square, and the White House -- and dismissed 
each one as a practical impossibility. 
  The interviewer then asks about the state of the president's 
health, since there is considerable speculation about it. 
Filatov replies: "There is a lot of flu about in Moscow at the 
moment, as you all know. There have been many cases. As far as 
I remember, we expected Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin on Monday. 
He really did want to come, but later he felt unwell. You know 
the way it goes: Sometimes you get up and it passes off once you 
are on your feet, and, at other times, the illness knocks you 
out. I don't think that he managed to avoid that insidious 
illness. It seems quite normal to me."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS observer Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 15 Feb -- "The difference in principle in 
the Russian president's administration which is being reformed 
lies in the new constitutional functions of the head of state 
which must be guaranteed." This was how Sergey Filatov, the 
Russian president's head of administration, explained the 
meaning of the reorganization being conducted in the Kremlin's 
corridors of power in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  Two parallel branches, as it were, remain in the apparatus 
of 
the head of state: the staff of assistants of the president, 
headed by Viktor Ilyushin, and the administration proper, led by 
Sergey Filatov. Asked whether the presence of two parallel 
structures in the apparatus of the president is an unnecessary 
duplication, Sergey Filatov replied that he sees no 
contradiction in this because "all assistants of the president 
work for the head of state, using the administration apparatus 
for the fulfillment of their tasks." The number of assistants 
of the president in various fields of activity will be increased. 
  The head of administration named among the new structures 
the 
economic analysis service, the finance and budget section, and 
the international department. The head of state needs these 
structures because "the president, in accordance with the new 
constitution, no longer heads the government, but at the same 
time needs to be well informed on the state of the economy, the 
budget and tax policy," Sergey Filatov explained. However, the 
formation of sections with functions of executive power under 
the president is already arousing criticism to the effect that 
the norm of the division of powers enshrined in the Russian 
constitution are being violated. This collision could become an 
occasion for reproach against the president, as was recently 
declared, in particular, by State Duma Deputy Sergey Shakhray. 
  The administration staff will also include the new 
Directorate of the Federal State Service. The Council for Cadre 
Policies under the president, set up in spring last year, is 
headed by three co-chairmen -- Sergey Filatov, Oleg Soskovets, 
and Vladimir Shumeyko. Three commissions under this council 
"will deal with the preliminary assessment of cadres": They are 
the commissions for judicial cadres (headed by Minister of 
Justice Yuriy Kalmykov), for foreign cadres, and for senior 
military titles and posts. "Their task includes the accumulation 
of a data bank on cadres and their professional training," 
Sergey Filatov pointed out. 
  The president's analytical service is being substantially 
reformed. A Council of Experts is being set up in it which will 
very likely be headed by Sergey Filatov, and there will also be 
a Center of Special Presidential Programs and an analytical 
service proper. The composition of the Presidential Council 
will also be renewed and filled with new names. 
  The number of staff in the administration of the president 
of 
Russia is currently, according to its chief, 1,983 (but a full 
strength of 2,000 is proposed). 
  The president will approve the final scheme of the 
reorganization of his apparatus in the next few days, Sergey 
Filatov reported.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS analyst Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- Relations between the 
Russian president and the new legislature have aggravated again 
after the law-makers set up a lower house commission to 
investigate the armed rebellion in Moscow on October 3-4 and 
called for a new building to house the parliament, Yeltsin's 
chief of staff Sergey Filatov told ITAR-TASS and Ostankino 
Television. 
  Filatov disapproved of the setting up of a house 
investigatory commission because the Russian Federal 
Prosecutor's Office is already conducting an investigation into 
the matter on its own. He blamed the president's envoy to the 
parliament Aleksandr Yakovlev for the shortfall: He should have 
proposed that the law-makers hear the federal prosecutor first 
or wait until an official statement was made by the 
investigators. Any duplication of investigative efforts 
generates mistrust and confrontation, Filatov suggested. 
  As concerns a new residence for the State Duma, Filatov said 
Moscow simply did not have a building to suit the tastes of the 
lower house. Commenting on (former Soviet parliament speaker) 
Anatoliy Lukyanov's proposal that the Russian legislature be 
given the building of the former Soviet parliament in the 
Kremlin, Filatov said the building was now occupied by the 
president and his staff while the neighboring residence of the 
head of state was under repair, which is due to last for three 
years. 
  As for the former Communist Party Central Committee 
buildings 
in Staraya Square, for which the Duma asked as an alternative, 
it housed the federal government and some other departments, the 
Moscow regional duma and administration, and the presidential 
staff. Filatov said. 
  The number of rooms in the "White House" which was earlier 
occupied by the Russian parliament dissolved last September, is 
insufficient to provide offices for all the 450 deputies of the 
present legislature, each of whom wants to employ several 
assistants for the 80 minimal wages [as received] granted them. 
The house committees and commissions, factions and technical 
services as well as the Secretariat are also building up their 
staffs, who will need at least 1000 offices. 
  Filatov said a combined version will probably be offered to 
the Duma, including the building of the former State Planning 
Committee in Okhotny Ryad. 
  It is more important to avoid squabbling but arrange 
constructive interaction between the chambers of the Federal 
Assembly, the president and the government. Towards this are 
now working the president's representative in the parliament 
Aleksandr Yakovlev, Yeltsin's aide Georgiy Satarov and a 
department of the president's staff. "This is a daily uphill 
job, but I know that President Bill Clinton's staff thinks 
nothing is more important than interaction with the Congress", 
Filatov stressed. 
  He added that the presidential message to the parliament on 
the state of the federation will urge all three branches of 
power to interact constructively in making effective in practice 
the constitutional provisions which protect human rights, ensure 
reforms and combat crime. 
  The president has prepared a package of 60 bills on economic 
and court reforms, and on the state system, as well as draft 
civil, land and environmental codes, Filatov added.

  [Text] On Wednesday Ella Pamfilova, Russia's Social 
Security Minister, reported to INTERFAX about her "final and 
firm" intention to resign. "This decision is a result of much 
thinking and three notes on resignation which I have presented 
to the Cabinet's leadership since this January," Pamfilova said 
in her exclusive interview with our news agency. 
  "I do not want to be a screen nor to reassure in vain people 
who need social support and security. I cannot do anything in 
the government with such a composition. At the same time I do 
not want this government to fall because real chaos could come 
out of the ruin," said Pamfilova. 
  At the same time, she admits that an opportunity for the 
present Cabinet could be lost in the near "two-three months." I 
would not like to be among the people who are willy-nilly 
building the road to Zhrinovskiy's power," declared Pamfilova. 
In her words, the government would become viable if Yegor 
Gaydar returns to it as the first prime minister and Boris 
Fedorov -- as leader of the economic sphere. 
  "I hope I shall have an opportunity to explain my decision 
and my position to President Yeltsin in detail," said Pamfilova. 
  On Wednesday she conducted a conference with her 
department's 
staff and explained the motives for her resignation.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- Federalisation is the 
only way to preserve Russia as an integral state, said Sergey 
Shakhray, Russian minister for nationalities and regional 
policy. He addressed on Tuesday an international conference on 
Russia's federal structure and the implementation of the 
principles of pluralistic democracy, rule-of-law state and human 
rights. Federalisation does not mean the weakening of the 
state. It means an opportunity to combine rich potentials of 
all regions and democratic unification of society, Shakhray 
said. A new form of state structure has emerged and is 
developing. The notion of federalism includes economic and 
territorial aspects. 
  The new constitution ensures equal rights of all subjects of 
the federation, Shakhray said. He pointed to the importance of 
working out various forms in integration within Russia. The 
initial experience in this respect is the activity of 
interregional economic associations in whose framework subjects 
with different status interact. 
  The constitution laid down the principles of self-regulation 
of the federation, the minister said. Preserving Russia's 
character it registered the possibility of regulating processes 
of the separation of powers by federal and other treaties. It 
deals with matters that are in the competence of subjects and 
joint competence of central authorities and regions. A treaty 
with Tatarstan that may be concluded today is based on these 
articles of the constitution. 
  Prevention and settlement of ethnic conflicts is the 
priority 
task, the minister said. He believes these conflicts are 
caused by redivision of power, of property, by organised crime. 
  Shakhray said the ethnic form of conflicts is a most 
convenient camouflage for real aims of certain political forces. 
The Russian Federation is the common house where there is room 
for all forms of self-organisation -- republics, regions, 
autonomies, Shakhray said.

<F P=106> [Report by Larisa Yevtushik: "Minister Joins Government </F>
Presidium. Sergey Shakhray Has Obtained Special Status"] 
  [Excerpts] Sergey Shakhray, who has yet again performed a 
balancing act between a boost or a fall in his career, has won 
once more. He appears not only to have strengthened his 
position in the reformed government, but also to have secured a 
special status among his executive branch colleagues: Last 
weekend Boris Yeltsin issued an edict elevating Sergey Shakhray 
to the Council of Ministers Presidium. 
  Your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent was told at the Council 
of Ministers press service that the government presidium is made 
up of Viktor Chernomyrdin himself and his deputies. Their 
weekly meetings on Thursday are considered presidium sessions. 
Now the only "regular minister" -- Sergey Shakhray, chief of 
the ministry for nationalities and regional policy -- will 
attend the meetings as a full member. 
  Not long ago Sergey Shakhray complained to journalists that 
the most urgent problems, such as talks with Chechnya and 
Tatarstan, have been resolved without him. According to 
Shakhray, he obtained a copy of the draft bilateral treaty with 
Kazan only after he publicly expressed his bewilderment in that 
regard for the umpteenth time. 
  Sergey Shakhray, who has repeatedly said that he personally 
and his Party for Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] support Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, was nonetheless ready to quit unless the minister 
for nationalities and regional policy was given special status, 
because the situation in this area requires him to have the 
broadest possible powers to resolve the most sensitive matters. 
  Given that Boris Yeltsin has been disapprovingly viewing 
"all 
those Shakhrays" setting sights on the presidential office, and 
that the new structure does not envision the post of 
nationalities minister/deputy Council of Ministers chairman, one 
could surmise that Shakhray's days in the cabinet were numbered. 
But this time around, as has already been the case a number of 
times, it turned out that the high echelons of power cannot do 
without this man, who has worked in the hottest spots of 
political activity. [passage omitted] 
  It cannot be ruled out that Sergey Shakhray, who knows his 
way around legal rules and office relations perfectly well, may 
have himself proposed the compromise way out of the situation to 
the president and the prime minister (who had said, as a matter 
of fact, that he would not accept anyone's ultimatums when the 
issue was Boris Fedorov). His joining the presidium -- a body 
not envisioned by the constitution -- elevates the minister's 
status and enables him to take part in decisionmaking on matters 
concerning his ministry. At the same time, this step does not 
require the president to amend his edict on the structure of the 
Council of Ministers or to introduce yet another post of deputy 
prime minister above the quota, as was the case with Anatoliy 
Chubays. Understandably, such an appointment would only have 
intensified talk about Boris Yeltsin's inconsistency, something 
which does not add authority to presidents.

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Feb -- Russian Government Chairman Viktor 
Chernomyrdin today signed a decision on the distribution of 
responsibilities between the various deputy premiers. 
  First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets will coordinate, 
among other things, investment policy and defense industry. He 
will also head the government's commission on operational issues 
and coordinate the activities of 15 ministries, state 
committees, and departments. 
  Aleksandr Zaveryukha will concentrate mainly on agriculture 
and hydrometeorology, while Anatoliy Chubays will continue to 
handle the privatization program and anti-monopoly policy. 
Responsibilities for social policy and cooperation between the 
government and representative bodies, political parties and 
public organizations have been transferred to Yuriy Yarov. 
  Russia's economics minister, Aleksandr Shokhin -- who is a 
member of the government presidium -- will coordinate the 
economic reform and the work of the Russian Federation Ministry 
for Cooperation with CIS States.

<F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva report under the "Finances" rubric: </F>
"Boris Fedorov Prepared To Embrace Viktor Gerashchenko Should 
the Latter Submit to State Duma Report on Central Bank's 
Financial Activities"] 
  [Text] Former Vice Premier Boris Fedorov told journalists 
yesterday that Premier Chernomyrdin to all appearances had not 
expected what happened in the wake of his statement about 
correcting the course of reforms and about combating inflation 
by "nonmonetary methods." "The government is patently weak: It 
gives promises by the hour but does not realize that one can 
only give promises when each promise is realistically 
substantiated. The cabinet was reorganizing itself for a month, 
while ever fresh corrections of the budget were taking place," 
Mr. Fedorov stated. He also noted that while the Finance 
Ministry assessed real budget revenue at 80 to 90 trillion 
rubles a month ago, today it assesses it at 130 trillion 
although no new receipts have been registered. According to Mr. 
Fedorov, this is yet another attempt at window dressing. 
Correcting budget figures in this manner cannot result in 
stabilizing finances and, in Mr. Fedorov's view, is only 
applicable "in a bid to receive the next $1.5 billion from the 
IMF and to prove that reforms in Russia are continuing." The 
budget deficit, he declared, would amount under the present 
draft budget to 100 trillion rather than 40-50 trillion as was 
projected earlier, which would result in a collapse of the 
financial system and an explosion of hyperinflation three or so 
months after. 
  As a result of "the government's flailing around," Mr. 
Fedorov believes, "the Pandora box has been opened: Production 
workers are threatening strikes, and numerous lobbyists are 
demanding money." However, he said, now many members of the 
current cabinet (including both Mr. Soskovets and Mr. Grachev) 
"are now ready to agree with me. Zaveryukha's greedy appetites 
are too immense." 
  Boris Fedorov said that very soon the committee on budget, 
taxes, and prices is going to organize Duma hearings on the 
government's monetary policy, and he would like to hope that 
"these hearings will be different than the hearings on economic 
policy." Boris Fedorov, who last week was elected chairman of 
the Duma subcommittee on control over the Central Bank's 
activities, is obviously expecting Viktor Gerashchenko's report 
with interest. "I am prepared to embrace Mr. Gerashchenko," he 
declared, "I only still would like the Central Bank chairman to 
submit for Duma consideration not simply a one-page report as 
was the case in 1992, but to include in it a balance sheet of 
the bank's financial activities."

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Vyzhutovich: "`Russia's Choice' Holds </F>
Secret Council on the Banks of the Pakhra"] 
  [Text] Around 100 representatives of "Russia's Choice" 
spent Saturday and Sunday in Krasnaya Pakhra, where, hidden from 
the prying eyes of the press, they immediately got down to 
building the party they had announced the day before. 
  The foundation of this new party edifice, which is being 
erected in accordance with a radical plan, was laid by a program 
statement declaring that the "corrupt bureaucracy is 
increasingly taking the center stage of political life, together 
with right- and left-wing radical (fascist and communist) 
antireformist forces." According to the authors of the 
statement, the "executive branch, instead of countering 
reaction, is getting further and further away from the course of 
reforms, accompanying the revision of their basic principles 
with declarations of loyalty to them." Therefore, the "Russia's 
Choice" party (the name is still being worked on) intends to 
unite "all those for whom freedom, human dignity, and the 
prosperity of the Fatherland and its citizens are not empty 
words and who are prepared inside and outside parliament, in 
individual and mass actions, to act as guarantors of reforms, 
guarantors of Russia's renewal." 
  Predictably, the ideological declaration did not meet with 
any objections on the part of those attending the political 
weekend. After all, the Russian radical democrats exchange oaths 
of loyalty to liberalism as regularly as they do vehemently, 
which does not prevent them in any way from multiplying the 
splits and discord in their ranks and piling up mutual 
grievances and criticism. But what guarantees are there that 
the new political alliance of radical reformers will be viable 
and effective? 
  "Russian democracy is terrible at times of victory," Yegor 
Gaydar, the chief instigator of the future party, said in an 
exclusive interview for IZVESTIYA (the conversation took place 
in a luxury suite in the leisure complex near Moscow where the 
conference participants spent the two days). "When they win the 
democrats immediately start having deep and meaningful 
discussions, deciding who should do what, and arguing over 
trivia. But at moments of danger Russian democracy is capable 
of united, organized action. We are going through just such a 
time at the moment." 
  "What was the main source of disagreement during the two-day 
talks?" 
  "Organizational matters, as ever. The principle underlying 
the structure of the party. The founder-membership. The norms 
of representation on leading bodies." 
  One of the cofounders of the party, together with "Russia's 
Choice," is the "Democratic Russia" movement. Its regional 
structures, amorphous though they may be at present, will find a 
new use. But an argument has already developed between the 
leaders of the future alliance in the capital and in the 
provinces over the principle whereby the leasding body is to be 
formed, how many seats Moscow will get and how many the 
provinces will get. The allocation of party portfolios has 
begun. 
  Yegor Gaydar's intention is that the new party should not be 
a rehash of existing movements and organizations. A 
fundamentally new alliance of reformists is being created. It 
is clear from the program statement that it intends to pursue a 
"line of constructive dialogue with the federal government and 
local administrations, taking issue with them on vital matters." 
It was stipulated that "if the intention to curtail the reforms 
is put into practice, the party is prepared to oppose the 
present cabinet." The latter statement has considerable 
piquancy, given that Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays, who also 
participated in the talks near Moscow, will be one of the 
party's leaders. 
  Making it known that the party is not responsible for the 
government's activites and their results, the conference 
participants, in their program statement, skillfully delineated 
their attitude toward Boris Yeltsin: "We draw a clear line 
between the president and all the other structures of executive 
power. `Russia's Choice' will give social and political support 
to the course of reforms President Yeltsin has been conducting 
since 1991. We support a president who is conducting this 
course. We criticize the president insofar as he himself is 
deviating from this course under pressure from various 
circumstances." 
  Yegor Gaydar announced that the party's founding congress 
will take place at the end of May at the earliest. The former 
vice premier said that the delayed birth of the new political 
alliance is due to a multitude of organizational problems. But 
that is probably not the reason. The initiators and creators of 
the party probably want the founding forum to take place against 
a particular political and economic background. It is hard to 
predict what this background will be like by the beginning of 
the summer. The leaders of the new political alliance are 
intending to bring into their ranks small and medium-size 
entrepreneurs, skilled workers, and the intelligentsia and are 
hoping that a wave of social discontent in the spring and the 
summer will wash many more supporters to their party shore than 
they have at the moment.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report in the "Position" column: "PRES </F>
Will Vote To Amnesty Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. Not Because They 
Are Innocent, But for the Sake of National Concord"] 
  [Text] The Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] 
faction has decided to support a draft resolution on amnesty 
which is to be discussed in today's session of the Duma. As 
PRES leaders noted at a faction conference, this draft envisions 
in particular amnesty for convicts and defendants under article 
79 of the Penal Code -- "organization of mass disturbances," and 
if it is adopted, the ringleaders of the October rebellion will 
be set free. "But our faction will vote in favor, explaining 
that this is not recognition of their innocence but an act of 
national conciliation, and we say that after leaving prison, the 
organizers of the October disorders must not start everything 
all over again," Sergey Shakhray said. True, the PRES leader 
admitted that there are no guarantees that when Rutskoy and 
Khasbulatov are released, unrest will not begin again. 
Moreover, Shakhray said that this course of events is "very, 
very likely." His faction colleague Sergey Stankevich recalled 
that convicted under Article 79 were also those who organized 
riots in penal colonies or took hostages, outlining in this 
connection the "nice" prospects for Russia in the event that 
such "a humane action of total amnesty is undertaken." 
  Yet the doubts of Sergey Shakhray's comrades were dispelled 
by his "right-hand man," Konstantin Zatulin, who said, "If we do 
not support the draft, we shall be accused of being enemies of 
the people, seeking to keep Khasbulatov and Rutskoy in prison 
forever...." Furthermore Mr. Zatulin, saying that "part of the 
blame" for the October riots lies on the executive branch, 
assured that the ex-speaker and the ex-vice president "must not 
be amnestied but completely rehabilitated in their rights, based 
on investigation results." Therefore that part of the PRES 
representing Konstantin Zatulin's followers will apparently 
support the Communist Party, the Agrarian Party, the Liberal 
Democratic Party, and the Yavlinskiy bloc, which are planning to 
set up "a deputies commission to investigate the 3-4 October 
events," which issue will also be discussed in the Duma today. 
  To "emphasize the faction's commitment to the principles of 
national conciliation" the PRES members agreed on voting day to 
circulate a corresponding "clarification document" in the Duma." 
"Maybe Baburin and others will vote in favor simply because they 
want to see Khasbulatov and Rutskoy at large, but we shall vote 
for this for other motives," Sergey Stankevich summed up the 
PRES' position.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belskiy] </F>
  [text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- An organiser of the 1991 
abortive Soviet coup accused Mikhail Gorbachev, the former 
Soviet president and general secretary of the Communist Party, 
of hating the CPSU and losing control over the country which 
resulted in the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
  "The (Communist) Party hated Mikhail Gorbachev the way he 
hated it", Oleg Shenin, former secretary of the CPSU Central 
Committee, told the trial which probes the coup on Tuesday. 
  "The tragedy of the Soviet Union was that head of state 
Mikhail Gorbachev lost the reigns of control over the country", 
he added. 
  This was the subjective reason for the collapse of the 
Soviet 
Union, according to him. 
  "There were no major objective reasons for the collapse of 
the USSR -- there were only subjective reasons", Shenin said and 
added that the coup was organised in order "to save the union 
state". 
  He added that he had for long advocated extraordinary 
measures to improve the deteriorating economic situation in the 
former USSR.

  [Text] The last words Mikhail Gorbachev said to the 
plotters who visited him on August 18, 1991 at his summer 
cottage in Foros were: "Go Ahead", said the former secretary of 
the CPSU Central Committee Oleg Shenin. 
  Shenin is accused of state treason. Together with Valentin 
Varennikov and Oleg Baklanov he visited on August 18 the then 
Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev at his summer cottage in 
Foros (the Crimea). 
  Shenin said Gorbachev warmly welcomed their arrival and 
their 
talk lasted 45-50 minutes in a friendly atmosphere. Shenin 
emphasized that Gorbachev was aware of the difficulty the 
country was in and the fact that the signing of the Union treaty 
would cause the country's disintegration. 
  Shenin said that after the conversation the president 
approved the introduction of the state of emergency in the 
country, though he said that the decision should be taken by 
parliament or the Congress of People's Deputies. 
  Shenin said that in the presence of other plotters, 
Gorbachev 
began to write the message to parliament. However, he gave up 
the idea because he did not want to leave written evidence that 
he shared the idea of imposing a state of emergency. 
  Answering the questions put by the prosecution, Shenin said 
that no ultimatums were issued to Gorbachev and that the 
plotters treated him as the president. 
  According to Shenin, on August 18, 1991, Gorbachev declined 
Baklanov's proposal to return to Moscow together with the 
plotters saying he was not well. He claims Gorbachev had done 
this deliberately wait and see how the situation would develop. 
  Answering the prosecution's questions on the alleged 
blockade 
at Gorbachev's dacha, Shenin said that the president was free to 
do what he pleased. 
  Shenin's interrogation will be continued Wednesday, February 
16, at 10 A.M.

Article Type:BFN 

<F P=106> [Article by Stas Stremidlovskiy: "Falcons of the Airwaves </F>
Will Bend Everyone's Ears"] 
  [Text] First of all a quotation, excuse me for being 
immodest, from our own newspaper, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 15 
December 1993: "In Yelena Bonner's opinion, journalists who 
were too harsh in their criticism of the reforms are chiefly to 
blame for Zhirinovskiy's victory." This was said after the 
results of December's elections, which shocked us all. Let me 
remind readers that at the time journalists were also blamed for 
paying excessive attention to Vladimir Volfovich himself. 
  Until today, I personally have tried not to write about Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy, because any mention of his name in the press is an 
indirect advertisement for him. But having looked through some 
documents I received from an acquaintance in the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], I realized that the time has 
now come to refer to the leader of this party in print. 
  Well then. The first document is "A Blueprint for Broadcasts 
by the `Radio Zhirinovskiy' Radio Station." First of all we 
have the preamble: "The existence of his own radio 
station will make Vladimir Zhirinovskiy even more popular and 
boost the number of his potential voters." I invite you to 
memorize this statement carefully; we will have reason to recall 
it. 
  Now for the details. The authors of the blueprint give a 
detailed description of the planned items that will be broadcast 
on "Radio Zhirinovskiy." There will be Zhirinovskiy Hour -- an 
hour of listeners' questions answered live by the LDPR leader. 
Then there is music from Zhirinovskiy's childhood -- a program 
specially for older listeners. Zhirinovskiy request time will 
consist of several hours a week of the great man's musical 
requests dedicated to "Travkin, Burbulis, Yeltsin, Lukyanov, 
Saddam Husayn, and Clinton." Zhirinovskiy's favorite tunes will 
acquaint listeners with the leader's preferred melodies. 
Finally, It's Your Line to Zhirinovskiy means that anyone who 
wants to talk on air with Mr. Zhirinovskiy can send a postcard 
to the radio station indicating his telephone number. 
  Here is another quotation: "For people weighed down by 
constant problems who find themselves continually depressed 
owing to their unbearably difficult way of life, we propose the 
`Russian Dream' propaganda program. Analogous to the American 
version, the Russian dream means faith in one's future, a strong 
country, prosperity for one's children, peaceful twilight years, 
stability, and security. Studio guests will include people who 
have made something of themselves and overcome a host of 
problems." Most of the station's broadcasting time, 
according to the authors' plan, will be made up of patriotic 
music from all eras. 
  This is no joke. As far as I can tell, negotiations are 
already under way with two radio stations -- "Avto-radio" and 
"Vozrozhdeniye." It is planned to broadcast between 1900 hours 
and 0400 hours, presumably starting this March or April. 
  And so to the second document. "The `Zhirinovskiy Nighttime' 
Youth Club." Its founders believe that "the club's name 
will give rise to plenty of jokes regarding its activities, but 
the parties we intend to hold will always differ from those in 
other night clubs by their marked accessibility, immediacy, and 
quality program." So what are Zhirinovskiy's clowns 
planning? "While primarily intended for a youthful 
audience, the club will also enable us to hold parties for 
disabled people and pensioners, organize programs devoted to a 
particular event, or simply invite deputies from a particular 
faction to celebrate their leader's birthday." 
  The night club also plans free lunches for pensioners, 
performances by artistes for the residents of children's homes, 
and meetings with the press. 
  One can of course make fun of the unwieldiness of the plans 
put forward by Zhirinovskiy's supporters. It is possible to do 
so. Only we should remember the background against which all 
this is taking place. 
  Meanwhile in over 30 Russian cities television programming 
has been cut back exclusively to news broadcasts, since both 
Russian Television and "Ostankino" owe the Ministry of 
Communications approximately 80 billion rubles. Moreover, the 
Ministry of Finance has halved Russian Television's budget, and 
now Russian Television has been forced to halve its programming. 
  At the same time, in accordance with an instruction by 
government apparatus leader Vladimir Kvasov, even news agency 
and television correspondents are not being admitted to 
government sessions for the first time in two years. The 
explanation looks like a joke that has fallen flat -- we are 
being told that the sessions are a "working process, and 
therefore only mass media accredited to the Council of Ministers 
may attend the sessions, namely ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and the 
government newspapers." 
  In my opinion we are already witnessing a trend whereby the 
numerous press services, which were originally designed to 
impart as much information as possible about their department's 
work to the press and hence to society, are turning into a press 
whose purpose is to squeeze journalists out of the corridors of 
state structures. I am not even going to mention the country's 
top leaders. An acquaintance of mine shudders whenever he 
catches a speech by the president on television. Well, here is 
Yeltsin telling us about his edict which will stir up the entire 
country, he comments. 
  Of all Russia's politicians, Vladimir Volfovich is virtually 
the only one who converses with the people. He travels around 
the country, around our country, moreover, not America or 
Switzerland. He directs his appeals to specific groups of 
voters. He knows what he wants. I have no doubt that 
Zhirinovskiy will be our next president. 
  So what will you do then, Messrs. Democrats? Absolutely 
nothing. You seem to be implying that life will be awful if 
Comrade Zyukin comes to power. 
  Comrade Zyukin has already arrived. But he does not wear a 
sober suit from the "Bolshevik" factory, nor does he go around 
with a long face. Comrade Zyukin wears denims and listens to 
rap music. While you preserve a haughty silence, he is running 
a disco. 
  I can only hope that our people are more intelligent en 
masse 
than any one politician or minister. They may be able to see 
exactly what Comrade Zyukin represents. But you democrats, if 
you have learned nothing since 12 December, will never learn 
anything at all.

  [Text] A constituent congress of the Party of the Majority 
took place in Moscow Tuesday. 
  The Party's chairman Vyacheslav Grechnev told the congress 
delegates that the Party is being forced to protect the 
interests of the Russian middle class: representatives of the 
creative intellectuals, of small and medium businessmen, of 
youth, war and labor veterans, that is of the majority of 
Russia's population. 
  The party is needed, said Grechnev, because the country 
faces 
the threat of annihilating a vital stratum of society. Russia 
is threatened by the prospect of becoming a country of the 
proletariat. 
  Speakers said that the party was conservative and against 
radicalism of any form. 
  The Party sees as its allies any political forces in the 
country are oriented around the priority of the state being the 
guarantor of freedom, the rights and dignity of its citizens. 
  Grechnev said that during the next parliamentary elections 
the Party expects not simply to win seats in parliament, but to 
form a majority in it. 
  The Party of the Majority has its representatives in 50 
Russian regions, said its leader. 
  Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov sent a message of greetings to 
the 
delegates. 
  Observers believe that the Party considers the possibility 
of 
nominating Luzhkov for presidency during the 1996 elections.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- The politial face of the 
New Majority Party, whose congress is now under way in Moscow, 
can hardly be determined right away. There are no eminent 
politicians among its organisers. It claims to represent the 
interests of the middle class. But this is now done by 
practically all the political organisations of Russia. 
  However, representatives of the leadership of the Democratic 
Party of Russia, attending the congress as observers, believe 
that the party is being set up for Yuriy Luzhkov, the mayor of 
Moscow. In their opinion, this is borne out, among other 
things, by the presence of representatives from the Moscow and 
regional elites (no journalists were allowed to the congress 
hall). Indicative also is the fact that the congress was opened 
by a message of greetings from the mayor of Moscow. In the 
opinion of representatives of the Democratic Party of Russia 
Yuriy Luzhkov is thereby making his first preparations for the 
next presidential elections. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS, assistant head of the Russian 
president's 
administration Igor Kharichev, who was invited to the congress 
as guest, said he had wary feeling about the new party. 
  The proceedings of the congress show that the delegates are 
disinterested in such documents as procedural rules or party 
charter. The selfsame representatives of the Democratic Party 
of Russia believe that regional businessmen have gathered in 
Moscow to settle their financial problems and that they are not 
very much inclined to set up a new party. 
  Judging by the scope of the congress's organisation, the 
initiators of the party obviously have much money at their 
disposal. Quite staggering is the huge number of men from the 
party's security service. Everybody is searched with the help 
of metal-detectors. The cultural centre of the RIA-NOVISTI news 
agency, where the congress is being held, is full of security 
guards equipped with walkie-talkies. None of the party's 
organisers were able to explain why such a strict police regime 
was needed at a congress of a political party.

  [Text] Russian Minister for Fuel and Energy Yuriy Shafranik 
visiting the Kuzbas coal region, said Tuesday while meeting in 
the city of Kemerovo with leaders of fuel and energy businesses 
and heads of the Siberian regions, that the authorities would 
take effective measures to pay for the fuel already supplied. 
  The minister said that soon this problem of the Russian 
economy will be solved with the help of the presidential decree 
"On Responsibility for Payment Delays." Shafranik said that the 
draft decree envisages responsibility, even criminal, to be born 
by the leaders of businesses for non-payments. 
  The minister said that Siberian enterprises have lower rates 
of decline in production than those elsewhere in Russia 
(7% 
against 17% over Russia). Currently 60 Mn tons of 
unrequired 
coal have amassed in Siberia. 
  Speakers at the conference also talked about a program 
forseeing the closure of loss-making pits and about the creation 
of a bank for servicing the fuel and energy complex.

  [Text] RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC REFORMS COME 12 YEARS LATE, 
GERASHENKO 
  56-year-old Viktor Gerashenko worked his way from a rank and 
file accountant of the former USSR State Bank to the post of 
President of the Central Bank of Russia in 1992 and becoming a 
government member in the same year.. He also held foreign 
postings as director of the Moscow Narodny Bank's branches in 
London, Lebanon, West Germany and Singapore. The CBR has come 
under increased attacks for its inflationary policies by the 
finance ministry, leading economists and newspapers alike. In 
an interview with Interfax, Gerashenko was trying to rebuff 
those accusations. 
  IF [Interfax]: What sort of a relationship will there be 
between the Central Bank and the finance ministry following 
Boris Fedorov's resignation? 
  GERASHENKO: To begin with, relations between the State Bank, 
the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have always been 
business-like at all levels. I do not think there was anything 
unusual in my relations with the former finance minister as far 
as cooperation between the two departments is concerned. The 
Bank of Russia has never tried to put a spoke in anyone's wheel. 
On the contrary, we met with senior Finance Ministry officials 
at the end of last year to stabilize money supply. 
  As for the differences we had, this must be seen as a normal 
thing in any country with a compounded economic, social and 
political situation. The fact that this should have been leaked 
to the press or become the subject of formal and informal 
conversations is not our own fault. 
  As for Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin, he is a 
newcomer in the ministry but I have known him as deputy chairman 
of the state committee for CIS economic cooperation. I know him 
as pragmatist who has always looked for optimal solutions to any 
deadlock relating to the country's economic situation and the 
need to use austerity measures in budgetary or crediting 
policies. We have never had any major differences. I met 
Dubinin more often than the minister himself, so I can see no 
problems ahead. 
  IF: What are the main parameters of the budget for the first 
quarter of this year? 
  GERASHENKO: There are none so far. The finance ministry has 
been working hard in the past three weeks to try to cut spending 
and find new sources of revenues. Its task is to try to bring 
in whatever resources there are in the country but economic 
methods must be used to do so. The ministry also faces the task 
of resorting as less as possible to the CBR's emissions 
mechanism which may cover any outstanding expenditure but step 
up inflationary processes. 
  IF: During a recent visit to Orel (Central Russia) together 
with the Prime Minister, you mentioned about Rbl 4 Tn worth of 
"free money" accumulated by the commercial banks. Will the 
government try to bring it into play, do you think? 
  GERASHENKO: This can be done only on a voluntary basis. In 
fact, commercial banks are in need of incentives to invest into 
the vital sectors if the economy is to survive as a whole. 
These include tax benefits or interest rate subsidies. With 
the interest rate such as it is now, there can be no question of 
investments. What is needed is full confidence that the 
government economic policy approved by parliament will ensure 
support to key sectors such as energy, transport and housing 
construction. That is, investments by the commercial banks must 
to an extent be guaranteed by the country's economic policy 
itself. 
  A clear signal must be sent to the private sector that the 
government has serious plans of developing a securities market, 
especially government bonds. Similar bonds can be issued by 
first rate companies involved in key sectors designed to ensure 
the country's survival. A commercial bank must be assured that 
government or company securities can help it survive in the 
event of liquidity with the help from the Central Bank. The CBR 
must, as it were, promise to play the role of a secondary 
market. But this is something unknown in this country, so the 
details will have to be worked out together with IMF experts. 
  IF: What do make of media allegations saying the key 
reformists were dropped out of the cabinet following last 
month's government reshuffle? 
  GERASHENKO: I do not hold with such assertions at all 
because 
the need for government reforms arose back in the mid- 1970s 
when most of its members must have been post graduates. 
Unfortunately, the then government was not ready for such 
reforms which were delayed for 12 years at least. In fact, the 
policy of reforms started in 1987 and the main dispute is about 
methods and timing rather than strategic goals. 
  I cannot say the government has been reformed. The cabinet 
was trimmed down, especially in the number of Vice-Premiers, on 
a proposal from Boris Fedorov himself. Generally speaking, I 
think Gaydar and Fedorov resigned for entirely different reasons 
though using a similar smokescreen. 
  IF: In his speech at Orel, Chernomyrdin made it clear the 
Rbl 
4 Tn debt to the defence and farming sectors would have to be 
repaid. In what way is this likely to affect the budget? 
  GERASHENKO: This is something that Russia's freedom loving 
press is reluctant to write about. The huge debt owed to the 
defence and farming sectors is left over by the finance ministry 
last year. This also includes salaries to the non-industrial 
sector comprising teachers, physicians, the army, the police and 
so on. Such things must be taken very seriously. I think that 
as a good professional, Boris Fyodorov is well aware of the 
difficulties facing the country in the first quarter of this 
year and throughout 1994 as a whole. I think Fedorov is partly 
trying to pull off a face-saving exercise. 
  IF: But the Rbl 4 Tn debt will have to be repaid after all. 
  GERASHENKO: The question is how to extend the schedule of 
repayment. Some of the debt will have to be repaid now to help 
to break the chain of mass defaults and raise some revenues. 
But the rest of it will have to be suspended to avert excessive 
money supply in the first quarter of the year. This is a 
formidable task. 
  The CBR is in search of new ways to break the deadlock 
including the issue of securities or orientating the resources 
of all sorts of funds. Regrettably, the existing legislation 
does not provide for such eventualities apart from distributing 
credits among commercial structures. In the meantime, their 
resources are at risk because of a certain threat of bankruptcy.

  [Text] Moscow, February 15 (TASS) -- Chief of the General 
Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Colonel-General Mikhail 
Kolesnikov described as falsehoods reports of a number of the 
media that he had sent in a resignation to the Russian president. 
  Kolesnikov said these abominable publications are aimed at 
splitting the leadership of the Defence Ministry and thus 
weakening one of the most stable institutions of the state -- 
the armed forces. 
  In his statement for the press circulated by the Information 
and Press Agency of the Defence Ministry, the chief of the 
General Staff said no secret is made of the work of the Defence 
Ministry. Its work can always be discussed in an open and 
constructive way. Representatives of the media are informed of 
every important function of the Defence Ministry or of the 
General Staff. Those who are really interested in getting 
reliable information about the armed forces have every 
opportunity to receive this information, the statement says.

<F P=106> [Russian Defense Ministry Press and Information Directorate </F>
report: "Chief of the General Staff Has Not Handed In His 
Resignation"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's announcement by a number of mass media 
that Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian 
Armed Forces General Staff, has allegedly written out his 
resignation and sent it to the Russian president does not accord 
with reality. 
  Here is what Mikhail Kolesnikov himself said about the 
report 
of his resignation: 
  "This is another fabrication. The purpose of such articles, 
in my view, is to sow mutual enmity, force a split within the 
leadership of the Defense Ministry, and thus weaken one of the 
most stable of state institutions -- the Russian Armed Forces. 
These articles personally do no more than disgust me. This is 
all the more unpleasant since we have established good 
businesslike relations with many mass media. 
  "I would like to appeal to mass media leaders and 
journalists. We are open, we are always ready for frank, 
constructive discussion. We do not make a secret of our plans 
or the state of the Armed Forces, we do not make a secret of our 
work. Journalists are frequent visitors to us. Not a single 
function of public importance takes place at the Defense 
Ministry or the General Staff without representatives of the 
mass media being involved. So those people who are really 
interested in obtaining reliable information about the Armed 
Forces have every opportunity to do so."

<F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report: "Rumors of General Staff Chief </F>
Resignation. Gen. Kolesnikov Has Not Resigned"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Observers do not rule out 
that the rumors of Mikhail Kolesnikov's resignation have a 
connection with the intentions of the presidential entourage to 
go ahead with the so far postponed reorganization of the 
military agency envisioning the transfer of some of the defense 
minister's functions to the General Staff chief. In this event, 
the head of state would like to have a different general filling 
the position of General Staff chief, who will be subordinated 
directly to the president. Besides, news of differences among 
the top command may help discredit the military agency, thus 
providing an opportunity to reorganize the Defense Ministry and 
carry through shakeups there even despite the resistance of 
Pavel Grachev, whose relations with Boris Yeltsin have clearly 
soured of late.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Zhilin, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI military observer, </F>
report: "Fine Gesture, or General Staff Chief's Resignation?"] 
  [Text] The rumor that Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, 
allegedly presented his separation request to the president went 
around Moscow last Friday. On Tuesday, a Moscow newspaper 
reported it as a fait accompli, which caused confusion at the 
Defense Ministry. 
  The Defense Ministry's press center has flatly denied the 
information, calling it a provocation. What has actually 
happened? 
  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI has learned form sources close to the 
president that Defense Ministry chiefs have long had differences 
of views, particularly on how military reform should be carried 
out. Far from all generals support Pavel Grachev's stance on the 
matter. As a result, two camps have emerged in the ministry 
leadership, both with their own doctrines of military 
organization. As with Grachev's other opponents, Gen. 
Kolesnikov is not a proponent of radical reform. 
  According to officials from the Defense Ministry central 
staff, this stance has annoyed Pavel Grachev. Recently, 
appointments to high posts at the General Staff were made 
without Kolesnikov's consent. Other "working incidents" have 
also been reported. Small wonder that the other day Kolesnikov 
said in an outburst of emotion that if his opinion was not 
heeded, he was ready to resign. It cannot be ruled out that 
military bureaucrats interested in such a turn of events have 
deliberately leaked the information to the press, adding by 
themselves a finishing touch: Gen. Kolesnikov's separation 
request is already sitting on Yeltsin's table. 
  Still, the source told MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, it is possible 
that there may indeed be only one step from an oral statement to 
a written request. It is believed, however, that Boris Yeltsin 
is unlikely to accept the resignation, because he sees 
Kolesnikov as "a mighty counterweight to extreme reformers." 
  Come what may, Mikhail Kolesnikov has said in public that he 
is not going to resign and that he is fully intent on honestly 
performing his duties.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- The Russian Defence 
Ministry will pay this year debts to suppliers of weapons and 
combat materiel, totalling 2,200 billion roubles. 
  It has already paid out 46 per cent of debts, 
Colonel-General 
Vassiliy Vorobyev, head of the chief administration of the 
military budget and financing, said at a news conference at the 
Defence Ministry on Wednesday. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS about reasons for payment delays, 
Vorobyev 
said that the military budget for the last year was approved at 
8,300 billion roubles. However, the Finance Ministry 
transferred only 6,500 billion to the Defence Ministry. 
  The ministry's minimum needs are over 10,000 billion. The 
Finance Ministry satisfied only 65 per cent of the needs. This 
is the explanation for debts and delays with payment of money 
allowances and wages. 
  The colonel-general did not say anything about the 
ministry's 
solvency this year. Vorobyev noted that everything would depend 
on the federal budget which will be examined by parliament in 
the near future. 
  Provision is made for some increase in appropriations for 
purchasing weapons and combat materiel as well as for research 
and development. 
  According to Vorovyev's forecast, the practice of saving on 
all the spheres of army and naval activities will be continued 
this year.

<F P=106> [Igor Chernyak "Military Review": "The `Infantry Fighting </F>
Vehicle' of Political Support"] 
  [Text] Sources in Russia's military department inform us 
that, despite calls to depoliticize the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces, its personnel, and particularly its officer corps, 
politicization is continuing, moreover the process is developing 
in a direction which, to put it mildly, is not always what the 
president, government, and Ministry of Defense leadership would 
expect. This trend is even typical of the General Staff 
apparatus. 
  The military department leadership is looking for ways to 
stabilize the situation. One of the methods being planned is to 
carry out a major reshuffle of the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces leadership and appoint to key positions military 
commanders of proven loyalty. Among the candidates slated for 
replacement are a number of generals ranging from commanders in 
chief of branches of the services to Ground Forces Aviation 
Commander Vitaliy Pavlov, who refused to execute an order to 
open rocket fire on the White House. The presidential 
administration is in turn formulating plans to establish a 
special structure to ensure more effective control over the 
state of cadre work in the Army -- a kind of CPSU Central 
Committee Administrative Organs Department. 
  Special efforts are being made by the defense minister to 
bring about the transfer to Moscow of Western Group of Forces 
Commander M.P. Burlakov, nicknamed by his subordinates the 
infantry fighting vehicle. It is expected that Burlakov will 
give a considerable boost to the Army's "reformist wing." It is 
not being ruled out that he will be considered as a candidate 
either for chief of the General Staff (together with Andrey 
Nikolayev, current commander in chief of the Border Guards, who 
is less acceptable to Grachev) or commander of the key Moscow 
Military District. Our sources in the General Staff claim that 
the firm opinion has formed at the highest level that, following 
the events of 3-4 October, current Chief of the General Staff M. 
Kolesnikov and Moscow Military District Commander L. Kuznetsov 
cannot be completely relied on. Burlakov's uncommon political 
flexibility works in his favor, of course: He was one of the 
first to support the State Committee for the State of Emergency, 
but shortly afterward he roundly condemned D. Yazov and his 
supporters. However, it cannot be ruled out that this 
flexibility could give rise to doubts among the president's more 
sober-minded supporters: The fact that Burlakov was the only 
commander at P. Grachev's October conference who 
enthusiastically approved the results of the storming of the 
White House counts for nothing. There is also some perplexity 
surrounding the actions of the Western Group of Forces commander 
(including the fact that Burlakov flew to the wedding of Defense 
Minister Grachev's son and presented the newlyweds with the keys 
to a new Mercedes), not to mention the overall situation in the 
Western Group of Forces. In the opinion of military men, the 
favorable reports brought back by a group of journalists sent 
out to Germany on P. Grachev's instructions were bound to be 
convincing, but in order to be absolutely sure it might also be 
useful to publish the results of an investigation into the 
Western Group of Forces and Burlakov personally that was 
conducted before last October by the military prosecutor's 
office and military counterintelligence.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin article: "Elections to Local Organs of </F>
Power: For Whom Will We Vote This Time"] 
  [Text] Last week the Federal Assembly State Duma 
determined its attitude toward elections to representative 
organs in Federation components and organs of local 
self-government. It was acknowledged that not everything is 
going smoothly and within the framework of the Constitution, and 
so the president was asked to take steps "to eliminate the 
breaches of citizens' electoral rights and the rights of local 
self-government committed in the legal acts of Russian 
Federation components." 
  What is at issue here? An explanatory note circulated among 
deputies says in particular that "on the whole the elections in 
the regions are rapidly gaining momentum." However, I would 
remind you that each region has set the date of its ballot 
autonomously. According to the president's edict of 26 October 
1993, June is the deadline for the elections, and 64 regions 
have decided to hold their elections in March. Karelia, 
Sverdlovsk Oblast, and Chukotka are voting in April, while 
Dagestan, Chelyabinsk and Saratov Oblasts, and Krasnodar Kray 
are doing so in July [month as published]. And several regions 
(Adygea, Bashkortostan, Buryatia, Kalmykia, Komi, Tatarstan, and 
Khakassia) have still not made up their mind about elections. 
  But the range of dates is not the most terrible sin 
committed 
by the Federation components. Parliamentary lawyers have 
observed constitutional violations with regard to citizens' 
rights to equal representation in organs of state power (in 
Krasnodar Kray and Tver and Perm Oblasts), the restriction of 
the electoral rights of certain groups of citizens in St. 
Petersburg, the removal of elections from public control (in 
most regions), and other unofficial constitutional "amendments." 
  As expected, there have been doubts in some areas as to the 
advisability of servicemen on compulsory service voting (in St. 
Petersburg and Murmansk Oblast). The logic here is as follows: 
Why should someone temporarily living in our area interfere in 
local affairs? And there is also the unvoiced but real idea 
that in certain circumstances the disciplined military 
electorate will be able to supply a sizable influx of votes to 
the candidate who appeals to...the command. The desire to 
exclude as many servicemen as possible from the elections is due 
also to democrat leaders' fear that the Army will vote for 
representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and 
the Communists. The well known saying that "one-third of the 
Armed Forces voted for Zhirinovskiy" -- although repeatedly 
debunked by specialists who have specific figures at their 
disposal and, most importantly, study the Army on a professional 
basis -- still features in publications, surfaces at political 
rallies, and alarms the timid section of the Russian public. 
Leaving aside the citizen's unconditional right to hold any 
beliefs and express them in elections, let us not nonetheless 
denigrate the Army by reducing its natural diversity of thinking 
to a common denominator. The processes of analyzing and 
reanalyzing reality are just as complex in the Armed Forces 
today as they are throughout society. Attempts to "bar" the 
Army from the ballot box only reveal the frailty of the local 
authorities, who rely not on the might of their prestige among 
the people, but solely on the force of administrative levers. 
And, finally, one last point: Since we have decided to love the 
Constitution this time, let us remember Article 32, which speaks 
without any reservation about the Russian citizen's right to 
elect and be elected to organs of state power. 
  As for draft service, there may in the future be grounds 
for studying the experience of certain countries where a 
servicemen taken away from home for a year or two is sent a 
ballot paper from his native city (village) and thus 
participates in creating local self-government bodies. 
  The following question is a rhetorical one: Does the Army 
have its own interest in these elections? Any commander today 
will confirm that his subordinates' lives and living conditions 
depend to a considerable extent on how aware the local authority 
is of army problems. Rayon-scale politics can mean that the 
local population sees these "warriors" as spongers who also 
occupy the best land. And the whole life support system of the 
regiment, the division, etc., is obstructed with red tape, 
chicanery, and demagoguery. Needless to say, the worst-case 
scenarios come to mind. But even run-of-the-mill 
"misunderstandings" between the command and the local 
authorities over housing questions can completely ruin the lives 
of the defenders of the Fatherland. Admittedly, to be fair, I 
must point out that there are still more examples of the 
military and the authorities living in harmony in the localities 
than the opposite. 
  It cannot be denied that ideally the military should deal 
with strictly military business, while the civilian authorities 
should do all they can to ensure that the military lead a normal 
life. And there would be no need for a regiment commander to 
besiege self-government organs and keep vigil to see whether 
they are not about to violate the interests of the several 
hundred men in his charge. But things are not ideal at the 
moment. And so a local citizen who is a true friend of the 
Army, if not a military man, will invariably have servicemen's 
vote. They have their own interests, they should have their own 
man. I repeat, he can be a man of any profession at all, but 
essentially someone who necessarily possesses one quality -- 
awareness of how much Russia needs a strong, determined, 
self-confident Army today. And a stubborn organ of 
self-government afflicted with primitive pacifism will quite 
easily develop in a troop unit a cadging complex, a feeling of 
being a poor relation. We must take care to ensure that this 
does not happen now, when elections are taking place.

question. As a Russian officer I would say no. 
  My service has not taken place in offices and on parquet 
floors. (You know how some officers and generals advance 
through the central apparatus.) I spent 10 years serving in the 
Transcaucasus. I remember how it all started in Sumgait in 1988 
before my very eyes. I was involved in the events in Ganja. I 
saw our boys at the controls of the tanks confronted with a 
dilemma: Should they carry out orders and continue the convoy's 
advance? But that meant crushing women and children. (The 
People's Front "got busy" dragging kids out of baby buggies and 
putting them on the road). The order came that they must reach 
their objective right on schedule. Could our Russian lads, 
raised in school on Soviet traditions, have crushed women and 
children? Of course not. No one calling himself a man could 
have tried to force them or have ordered them to do that. 
  [Lenskiy] Could you please tell us the reason for the CIS 
Joint Armed Forces High Command being transformed into the Staff 
for Coordinating Military Cooperation? Does this move not 
indicate that the CIS heads of state and defense ministers are 
losing interest in common security problems? 
  [Samsonov] The reason for the change is that we regrettably 
failed to reach a common view regarding the need to preserve the 
unified defense area along with the unified early-warning, air 
defense, and space defense systems within the framework of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, nor did we succeed in 
creating Joint Armed Forces and a unified command and control 
system for the strategic nuclear forces. Although there was, 
and still is, an obvious need to do so. 
  Interest in problems of military security within the CIS has 
certainly not faded lately, indeed it has considerably 
increased. Late last year the number of CIS states party to the 
Treaty on Collective Security rose from six to nine. Now only 
three of the 12 CIS states -- Moldova, Ukraine, and Turkmenistan 
-- remain outside the treaty. They too have lately been showing 
great interest in military cooperation issues. 
  [Lenskiy] Did you try to stop the disintegration? 
  [Samsonov] Of course. When it was decided to switch to 
national armed forces we wanted to preserve at least the most 
important systems in our common interests. Let me cite a simple 
example. There was a common air defense system in the Central 
Asia region... At one time we suggested setting up the "Yug" 
[South] air defense system under joint command, covering the 
interests of Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, 
Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The point is that the 12th Army was 
deployed on the territory of several republics! You had a 
command post was in one republic, a corps in another, a division 
in a third, and a regiment in a fourth. Some system that was! 
We suggested that it should not be broken up, because borders 
cannot be drawn in the air. But to no avail: It was destroyed. 
Now we are about to recreate it. But that is a very costly 
business. And it will take a very long time. 
  [Lenskiy] What impact have these actions had on the combat 
readiness of the new independent states' armies? Can they 
rebuff outside aggression where necessary? 
  [Samsonov] That is something for these states' 
military-political leaderships to worry about, since it was they 
who set up the national armed forces. They are answerable to 
the people. But the fact that the systems that I mentioned have 
been destroyed means that we cannot talks seriously about the 
Commonwealth as a whole or its individual members' being totally 
secure. 
  The point is that readiness to rebuff such aggression, 
particularly by military means, is forged in peacetime. Common 
operational planning of the use of coalition armed forces is 
carried out along with advance training and coordination of 
national armies for conducting joint combat operations. Command 
and control systems are set up as well as the main types of 
support and a definite infrastructure. 
  [Lenskiy] But, to all intents and purposes, that kind of 
training is not being carried out today? 
  [Samsonov] No, it is not. The experience of setting up 
Collective Peacekeeping Forces [CPF] in Tajikistan is very 
indicative. It took over three months to get together just one 
battalion apiece from Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. And 
Kazakhstan's battalion has still not turned up! I do not know 
when we will set up groupings in case of major aggression. That 
should be pondered in peacetime. 
  [Lenskiy] What is hampering you: ambition, general 
confusion, objective difficulties? 
  [Samsonov] All of those. The current situation in the 
defense sphere is closely connected with economic and social 
decline. There can be no integration on defense questions 
against a backdrop of political and economic disintegration. 
  [Lenskiy] How are the republics fulfilling their commitments 
regarding funding your activity? 
  [Samsonov] To be frank, not a single document is being 
properly implemented. As for Russia's contribution, that is 
mainly what we are living off. We are even in its debt, since 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Belarus are not fully 
meeting their commitments. They are not, of course, refusing to 
pay. But they are citing difficulties with the mechanism for 
mutual settlements. 
  [Lenskiy] What conclusions can be drawn from the experience 
of the CPF in Tajikistan? 
  [Samsonov] I take a positive view of these forces' activity. 
Thanks to the CPF, conditions have been created for peace talks 
and dialogue with the opposition, and their presence acted as a 
stabilizing factor at the last parliament session in Tajikistan, 
where passions hotted up at one moment. The Tajik leadership 
should take advantage of the favorable conditions to conduct 
dialogue with the opposition. There is not that much time. 
According to our data, the Tajik armed opposition is preparing 
for decisive action in the spring. 
  [Lenskiy] Last July we were all shocked at the number of 
casualties sustained by the 12th Russian Border Outpost in 
stopping infiltration of the Tajik-Afghan border. Government 
and parliamentary commissions traveled to the scene of the 
incident, nonetheless the public never learned who was 
responsible -- the Defense Ministry, the Ministry of Security, 
or the border troops. Or perhaps it was just a tragic 
coincidence? 
  [Samsonov] I believe that the border troops leadership bears 
the bulk of the responsibility. Nonetheless it cannot be held 
entirely responsible. The border troops are greatly in need of 
hardware and arms, but most particularly of personnel. Many 
outposts, including the 12th Border Outpost, are by no means 
fully manned. I flew out there with a group of officers, we 
conducted an investigation and redeployed Defense Ministry 
battalions, but that is patently inadequate.... The attack on 
the 12th Outpost did not come as a surprise. Audacious, 
impudent attacks have been going on a long time. The proper 
response has not been forthcoming, the situation was not 
analyzed carefully, and steps were not taken. And any aggression 
has only expanded as it has not been rebuffed. That is the 
unfortunate lesson. 
  [Lenskiy] Are we insured against another tragedy? 
  [Samsonov] I am not certain right now. Attempts have been 
made, and outposts are bombarded with rocket shells and heavy 
machineguns several times a week. Enemy weapon positions are 
immediately suppressed by helicopter attack, artillery and 
mortar fire. However, our combat readiness and reactions 
continue to be tested and probed. 
  [Lenskiy] Following the breakup of the USSR the length of 
Russia's borders to be guarded (compared with the Union) dropped 
by a factor of 1.5. Why have the liberated hardware and arms 
not been operationally redeployed to the most dangerous part of 
the border, Tajikistan? 
  [Samsonov] Nothing has been liberated! It has all been 
"privatized" by the new independent states. In a not entirely 
civilized manner, to put it mildly. The principle employed was 
that everything on my republic's territory is "mine"! There was 
no discussion as to whether it was needed or not, whether there 
was an adequate supply or a surplus over requirements, and it 
was impossible to reach agreement. In the Transcaucasus, for 
instance, special technical equipment from the security strips 
was barbarically destroyed. The argument was as follows: Why 
have the border guards got so much land, when our sheep have 
nowhere to graze? 
  [Lenskiy] The commander of the border troops claims that 
13,000 km of border are open today. 
  [Samsonov] We have not even determined where to have a 
border, with whom, and what kind of border it should be. For 
instance, Azerbaijan effectively has no border with Iran and no 
one knows who is to guard it. Russia too has no border with 
Azerbaijan. In the proper meaning of the word. 
  [Lenskiy] What new opportunities do you see for settling 
local conflicts within the CIS (Karabakh, Abkhazia) in 
connection with Azerbaijan and Georgia's joining the 
Commonwealth? 
  [Samsonov] I think that the admission of Azerbaijan and 
Georgia to the collective security system will create favorable 
opportunities for these conflicts to be resolved by political 
means. Real conditions have emerged for groups of military 
observers and CPF troops to be used to localize and put a stop 
to conflict. Everything, or virtually everything, now depends 
on the good will of the political leadership in these states. 
We would remind you that peacekeeping forces have played their 
part in the Dniester Region and South Ossetia. 
  [Lenskiy] But the conflicting sides must mutually agree in 
order for this to occur. At the moment the only signs of that 
are in Abkhazia. Karabakh is another matter. Azerbaijan has, 
on the contrary, been observed to step up hostilities since the 
Ashgabat meeting. 
  [Samsonov] You were absolutely right to say that there must 
first be mutual agreement for a cease-fire. If that is secured, 
military observers can "maintain" the situation, prevent it from 
breaking away.... A political solution has to be found. At one 
time I thought that leaders had already had enough of war -- 
both peoples have suffered a great deal. But it turns out that 
I was mistaken. Someone thinks that the fighting must go on. 
  [Lenskiy] There are reports that foreign mercenaries are 
involved on both sides in the Karabakh war. There are 
increasingly frequent references to Afghan mojahedin. 
  [Samsonov] There is a lot of talk like that. I was told 
about this during an emergency meeting with the states' 
representatives -- the deputy chiefs of staff. I said: Show me 
just one prisoner of war on television who is a citizen of 
Afghanistan, Iran, or Pakistan. They are unable to do so! 
There is talk, but no facts. 
  [Lenskiy] On the other hand we have clearly seen Russian 
boys who have been fighting on either the Armenian or the 
Azerbaijani side and have then been captured. How do you regard 
that? 
  [Samsonov] There are only a handful of these mercenaries. 
However, that is the cost of the processes that occur during the 
breakup of a great empire. Who thought about the guys who were 
left on the territory of a particular republic regardless of 
what they wanted? They had one homeland -- the Soviet Union -- 
and it sent them to serve in Armenia or Azerbaijan. Overnight 
(there was no period of transition) these boys found themselves 
without a place to serve, without an apartment, without any 
certainty. 
  No one was asked who wanted to swear another oath and who 
did 
not. No, they just had people shouting at them: All you 
Ukrainians and Belarusians, go back home to your own country. 
They did so. But there are no jobs. For instance, 100 
engineers are needed, but 200 turn up. "But we don't need 200." 
Where are they to go? They will no longer be welcomed at their 
former post in Russia -- they have been crossed off the unit's 
rolls. They are told: Take discharge. These people have ended 
up wanted by no one. 
  We now have servicemen in Central Asia, for instance, who 
do not know to whom they belong. They have no status. They are 
not being given dual citizenship. Some would like to continue 
their service, but they are told: Take local citizenship. "I 
don't want to." "No? Get lost." Many problems would be 
settled if the parties to the Treaty on Collective Security 
signed an agreement on dual citizenship. 
  [Lenskiy] Won't the Baltic states' involvement in the NATO 
"Partnership for Peace" military program threaten the security 
of the Commonwealth? 
  [Samsonov] That is not an easy question. There must be an 
in-depth investigation into the real idea behind this program. 
  At first glance the NATO plan, as it is being presented to 
the Western public, does not aim to pose additional dangers to 
anyone. 
  However, the fact that this document emerged shortly after 
the North Atlantic alliance's official decision not to expand 
the bloc by admitting new members does cause some concern. This 
decision was adopted under pressure from the world and European 
public, as well as owing to Russia's tough stance. There is 
doubt as to whether the new program constitutes a veiled means 
of expanding NATO, establishing its strategic influence in East 
Europe, and bringing the bloc's front lines right up to Russia's 
western borders. 
  If that is the case, this move could upset the balance of 
forces in Europe as enshrined in the CFE Treaty -- which is 
unacceptable to us. 
  [Lenskiy] However, NATO does not cease to assure us of its 
peaceableness.... 
  [Samsonov] As if we had been friends for ever and ever. But 
then the commander in chief of the NATO southern theater travels 
to Greece and Turkey. To what end, do you think? 
  [Lenskiy] Probably to reduce their military presence. 
  [Samsonov] If only! He went to strengthen NATO's southern 
flank. That is the point. But you were saying about the 
Baltic.... 
  [Lenskiy] Do you believe in the future of a single security 
system in Europe with NATO and Russia under the same "umbrella"? 
  [Samsonov] Not right now. Only in the very long term. 
Judging by the statements and the arguments it all looks OK in 
theory. But not in practice. Our national interests are 
confined to Russia's borders or, in the last resort, to the 
territories of the CIS republics. But U.S. national interests 
are increasingly focusing on Europe, East Europe even, and Asia. 
Recent statements indicate that U.S. interests must be present 
worldwide! Once again something does not somehow gel here.... 
  [Lenskiy] Will you be making additional efforts to securer 
UN or CSCE status for the CIS states' peacekeeping forces? Is 
that necessary? 
  [Samsonov] Tackling these issues is not part of the Staff's 
functions. The Collective Security Council or the Council of 
Commonwealth Heads of State will probably tackle them. As for 
whether it is necessary, I think it is. After all, a UN mandate 
does not only relieve a state of possible accusations of 
expansionist policy but also considerably reduces the burden of 
its material expenditure on a peacekeeping operation, lends it 
an international character, and gives its mission UN or CSCE 
prestige. 
  [Lenskiy] How do you regard the prospect of Russian military 
bases being set up on the territory of certain other CIS 
countries (Baykonur, for instance)? 
  [Samsonov] If the Commonwealth countries reach a mutual 
agreement with Russia on the siting of such military bases, I 
take a positive view of this. By and large they are elements in 
the Commonwealth's common defense area. This step does nothing 
but strengthen CIS stability and security. 
  [Lenskiy] From time to time reports appear regarding your 
Staff's difficult -- to put it mildly -- relations with the 
Russian Federation Defense Ministry. What can you say about 
that? 
  [Samsonov] You know, there can never be easy relationships 
during a period of reorganization, when major reforms are being 
implemented and new approaches and views of those issues are 
being formulated. 
  Time will tell who is right and who is less so. 
  It is a fact that it has become easier lately to work, 
cooperate, and find mutually acceptable compromise solutions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Viktor Samsonov, chief of </F>
Staff for Coordinating CIS Military Cooperation, by Vyacheslav 
Kocherov under "Nearby Foreign Parts" rubric; place and date not 
given: "Sound the Signal To Assemble, Army Buglers!"] 
  [Text] As Colonel General Viktor Samsonov, chief of the 
Staff for Coordinating CIS Military Cooperation, declared in 
conversation with our correspondent, the creation of joint armed 
forces is a matter for the not so distant future. 
  [Kocherov] Viktor Nikolayevich, if everything really is 
moving toward the creation of the CIS JAF [Joint Armed Forces], 
how are to we understand the transformation of the CIS JAF High 
Command into the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation? 
Can this be considered a step forward in the development of 
military cooperation? 
  [Samsonov] Paradoxical though this may seem, at the present 
moment this really is so, although just two years ago the path 
toward military cooperation seemed quite different to all of us. 
The creation of the CIS JAF High Command in March 1992 was a 
consequence of reckoning on preserving a unified defense area 
and joint leadership of the General-Purpose Forces and of the 
systems of air defense, missile attack early warning, ABM 
defense, verification of strategic forces and weapons of mass 
destruction, etc. But life, as is known, has ordered things in 
its own way. 
  Military organizational development in the Commonwealth 
states took the path of creating national armies. By July 1992 
it was already clear that it would not be possible to create the 
General Purpose Forces. The post of commander of these forces 
was abolished. The process of disuniting the air defense, 
missile attack early warning, and ABM defense systems began in 
the first half of 1993. Elements of these systems were 
scattered about the territories of different, now sovereign CIS 
states and had, in point of fact, been "privatized" by them -- 
which led virtually to their destruction. 
  Then Russia's military-political leadership assumed the 
functions of managing the Strategic Forces. The High Command's 
sphere of managerial activity was shrinking like shagreen 
leather. Therefore in August 1993 the CIS Defense Ministers 
Council adopted the decision to reorganize the High Command into 
the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation, which was 
implemented at the meeting of heads of state in Ashgabat 24 
December last year. 
  Of course, we would all like very much to preserve the 
common 
defense area and its administration, unified defense systems and 
infrastructure, joint armed forces, and the common "nuclear 
umbrella" over the CIS, but.... None of this exists yet (or 
already). Not that anybody objects to coordination in the 
military sphere. Therefore, if we evaluate from these positions 
the transformation of the CIS JAF High Command into the Staff 
for Coordinating Military Cooperation, this is a natural 
phenomenon. But it can hardly be considered a positive fact that 
we failed to preserve the common defense area and to create 
joint armed forces. Nevertheless, I am firmly confident that the 
creation of such armed forces is a matter for the not so distant 
future. 
  [Kocherov] You have not spoken of another aspect of this 
problem -- the legislative basis on which the policy of military 
cooperation was founded. Or are the documents so universal that 
they easily fit in with the newly created structure of the Staff 
for Coordinating Military Cooperation? 
  [Samsonov] If only this were so. The High Command has 
spent two years working out approximately 100 documents on 
questions of defense. The role of the CIS JAF High Command 
found its place in such basic documents as the Commonwealth 
Charter and the Collective Security Treaty. Now this entire 
legislative base has to be revised -- which will take, according 
to the most modest estimates, at least two years, because no 
more than two military questions are being submitted to the 
Heads of State Council. Meanwhile new agreements are waiting in 
line, whose signing also brooks no delay. 
  [Kocherov] In the press today there are many contradictory 
reports about the Collective Peacemaking Force [CPF], which most 
frequently appears in the guise only of Russia's 201st Motorized 
Rifle Division. What is the composition of the CPF? 
  [Samsonov] The agreement on the CPF and the decision on 
forming the CPF, signed by the heads of five CIS states -- 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan -- 
prescribed that the CPF be formed by 1 October 1993 and that its 
arrival at its points of stationing on Tajik territory be 
ensured. Russia allocated the 201st Motorized Rifle Division and 
certain other units to make up the CPF. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
and Uzbekistan pledged to send subunits there, up to the 
strength of one motorized rifle battalion each. Since the 201st 
Motorized Rifle Division has long been in Tajikistan, the 
question of manning it and of its timely arrival on station did 
not arise. 
  Things were more complex with the allocation of subunits of 
the remaining countries for the CPF. This was all time lost. 
This is what it cost: four attacks on border posts and 
instances of hostage taking. This constituted moral, material, 
and political damage to both Russia and the CIS states, not to 
mention the threat to stability in the republics neighboring on 
Tajikistan. 
  In addition to the Russian troops, the CPF is now made up of 
a reinforced motorized rifle battalion of the Uzbek Armed 
Forces, an incomplete battalion of the Kyrgyz Armed Forces, and 
units of the Tajik Armed Forces. 
  [Kocherov] Nevertheless, how do you rate the position of our 
troops in Tajikistan? Are you sure that they will not find 
themselves drawn into another war on foreign territory? 
  [Samsonov] I would rate as stable the position of the CIS 
troops in Tajikistan as a whole and of the Russian troops in 
particular. They are successfully fulfilling the tasks 
entrusted to them, creating favorable conditions for the 
political settlement of crisis processes, and ensuring the 
covering of the Tajik-Afghan border. 
  With regard to forecasts, I would say that the CPF in itself 
cannot resolve all Tajik problems. It is merely creating 
conditions for reconciling the sides, reaching political accord 
between the Tajik Government and the opposition, and resolving 
the border question with Afghanistan. 
  Some people believe that Tajikistan can manage without the 
Commonwealth's military forces. I do not think so. The troops' 
withdrawal from there will not only not ease tension but will 
also lead to a new flareup of violence and the exacerbation of 
border problems. Therefore, however hard and costly it might be 
to maintain the CIS CPF, it is essential to the Commonwealth 
and, in particular, to Tajikistan. 
  Incidentally, a session of the republic Supreme Council was 
held in Tajikistan recently, during which a number of awkward 
problems were resolved and representatives of irreconcilable 
groupings were made to agree to compromises. Hope emerged of 
creating a coalition government. The very presence of the CPF 
played a stabilizing role here. 
  [Kocherov] What is the nature of the relationship between 
the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation and the 
Ministries of Defense of those states which are not in the 
collective security system? 
  [Samsonov] We cannot yet speak of any system of relations, 
since the staff was only created one month ago. But it is 
possible to speak of trends. The chief one is the interest 
which Moldova, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine are showing in military 
cooperation in very diverse spheres: from the 
military-technical sphere to the training of military cadres. 
  I would particularly like to point to the substantial change 
in the views of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry leadership on 
participation in the collective resolution of defense questions. 
Addressing the Ashgabat session of the Commonwealth Defense 
Ministers Council, Army General Vitaliy Hryhorovych Radetskyy, 
Ukrainian minister of defense, particularly emphasized that, in 
addition to developing bilateral interstate relations in the 
military sphere, the republic's leadership is examining the 
question of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's joining the CIS 
Defense Ministers Council. 
  This, in my estimation, is a substantial step forward in 
strengthening the Commonwealth's collective security, which 
confirms the general integrational sentiments in the former 
republics of the USSR. 
  A year ago people in Azerbaijan, for example, did not wish 
even to speak of any cooperation in the defense sphere. But 
today we are awaiting a representative of that republic's armed 
forces in the staff. Incidentally, this republic was the ninth 
to sign the Collective Security Treaty. I believe it will not 
be the last. 
  [Kocherov] Based on this, what is your forecast for the 
future of military cooperation in the CIS? 
  [Samsonov] To be brief, things will, in my opinion, evolve 
as follows -- from the coordination of military cooperation to a 
military-political alliance and the creation of joint armed 
forces. I will refrain at present from speaking about the 
schedule for carrying out this trend. I am convinced of one 
thing -- along with economic integration and the strengthening 
of political cooperation, questions of restoring the common 
defense area and creating joint armed forces will also be 
resolved. The CPF is the first step on this path.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Crimean president's talks 
with Russian leaders: 
  "Yuriy Meshkov had something to be at a loss: he was urged 
to 
bring about political stability in the Crimea... Meanwhile, the 
president of the Crimea knows better than anyone else that 
political stability on the peninsula depends not on Simferopol 
-- the key to stability is in other capitals. 
  "In Kiev and Moscow, Meshkov was referred to as a hostage of 
political stability, who would be easy to blame in the event of 
any exacerbation of the Crimean issue. 
  "It is no wonder that the Crimean president who is now 
rooted 
to the Crimean corridors of power, looks for new hostages among 
Moscow politicians, not among little-known Simferopol officials: 
yet another sensation marking Meshkov's visit was his proposal 
to Yevgeniy Saburov, who, it would seem, was irrevocably pushed 
away from real economic power, to head a Crimean government". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Yevgeniy 
Saburov. "It is precisely representatives from Ukraine, who 
constitute the flower of Russian economic science. Yavlinskiy 
is from Lvov, Yasin from Odessa, Belkin from Kharkov," Saburov 
said. 
  "Moscow has been all the time replenished wth cadres from 
the 
provinces... I return to the Crimea with the sole aim -- to 
promote economic reforms on the peninsula. Its potential has 
not been used to the full so far... It is too early to speak 
about a specific programme. It is necessary to cast a more 
attentive look around on the spot". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA runs a sensational item, in which it is 
asserted that Georgian ex-President Zviad Gamsakhurdia "is alive 
and will soon place himself at the head of a Georgian 
government-in- exile in a foreign country. This was stated in a 
rather categorical form by a Georgian Zviadista delegation who 
paid an unofficial visit to Stavropol, to their sympathisers, 
Russian nationalists, and the Georgian diaspora". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the fifth anniversary of the 
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and on the 
consequences of that war for Russian society: 
  "The main thing is to show care for Afghan war veterans -- 
commissioned and non-commissioned officers -- for them to remain 
on active duty and form the backbone of a new professional army, 
to draw on the combat experience as the basis of the training of 
troops, and to protect the people socially and morally". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on rumours about change in banknote 
denomination and the rouble rate: 
  "The rumours that the denomination of banknotes is expected 
to be changed and the rouble rate is expected to be set in a 
one-to-one ratio against the U.S. dollar are a sheer invention". 
  The newspaper quotes Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman 
of 
the Central Bank of Russia, as saying that he believes that "the 
question of a change in banknote denomination is usually raised 
only after prices in a country stabilise." 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA carries an interview with Yuriy Shafranik, 
Russian minister of fuel and power, who emphasises that 
"notwithstanding the overall slump in the Russian industry by 
16-17 percent on average, our fuel-producing sectors operated in 
a relatively steady way. Oil production decreased by only 12 
percent, that of coal by nine percent, gas by three percent, and 
the generation of electric power by six percent, thereby 
ensuring a sufficiently stable provision of the national economy 
with energy resources". 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA runs an an article by Yegor Ligachev, 
former Politburo member of the Soviet Communist Party Central 
Committee, who writes: "The work of the parties that are members 
of the Communist Parties' Union -- CPSU is as if a continuation 
of the CPSU activities but proceeds under new conditions. This 
must be taken into account. Previously the party set itself as 
a task to broaden the social and political rights of citizens, 
whereas now the point is to restore them". 
  PRAVDA carries a Russian Communist Party statement, which 
reads as follows: 
  "One has to state with deep regret that a campaign to 
destroy 
monuments of Russian and Soviet history and culture was launched 
on a large scale in the country in recent years. Monuments are 
pulled down and destroyed, the names of towns, streets, and 
squares are changed, and museums are closed down. Matters went 
to such lengths that the study of the creative legacy of a 
number of great Russian writers has been removed from school 
programmes, and the study of the country's recent history has 
been narrowed unbelievably".

  [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- Moscow-based newspapers 
highlight the Russian-British summit meeting. The press points 
out that the Tuesday signing of a joint Russian-British 
statement on the de-targeting of strategic nuclear missiles from 
each other became the chief result of the Moscow talks between 
President Boris Yeltsin and British Prime Minister John Major, 
who had arrived in Russia for his first official visit here. 
  Newspapers practically with one accord note the friendly 
partnership atmosphere of the talks, although, as NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA points out in particular, "There were complex issues 
under discussion, such as the situation in Bosnia." 
  Commenting on the Russian-British talks, TRUD points out 
that 
"Russia and Britain are not adversaries any longer". KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA (Red Star), describing the talks as a "dialogue of 
partners", writes: "it is important that our mutually respectful 
dialogue between equal partners is carried on. And not only 
with the United States but also with European countries that are 
friendly to Russia, with Britain rightfully among them". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, recalling the words of President Yeltsin 
that Russia and Britain have now developed the best-ever 
relations in their entire history, emphasises that "this 
conclusion has been backed up by a package of joint documents". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the signing of a bilateral 
Russo-Tatar 
treaty in the Kremlin on Tuesday as a result of talks between 
Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Mintimer Shaimiyev: 
  "The presidents of Russia and Tatarstan summed up the 
results 
of the three-year negotiating process between Moscow and Kazan. 
From now on, the Republic of Tatarstan is a state united with 
the Russian Federation on the basis of two constitutions and the 
treaty on the delimitation of the areas of jurisdiction and 
mutual delegating of powers between the state power bodies of 
the Russian Federation and Tatarstan. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with Shaimiyev, who 
recalled in particular that he had stated way back in January 
this year that Tatarstan "will sign a treaty with Russia before 
the beginning of March". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the signing of the Russia-Tatarstan 
treaty: 
  "An ossified centre is being replaced by a federal 
authority, 
the power of which is in the emancipation of the subjects of the 
federation". At the same time the newspaper points out that, 
for a variety of reasons, primarily socio-economic ones, Russia 
and Tatarstan" are just destined to be partners". 
  The newspaper ROSSIYA, under the rubric "a political 
portrait", carries an article about Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the 
fifth state Duma in Russian history. 
  ROSSIYA runs excerpts from a speech made by Moscow Mayor 
Yuriy Luzhkov at the congress dealing with "the reality and 
economic development prospects". 
  The newspaper notes "a critical tenor of the speech made by 
the mayor who, perhaps, for the first time unambiguously stated 
his disagreement with the way economic reforms are being carried 
out in Russia...Luzhkov in point of fact read out his own reform 
programme which differs from the government one". 
  At the same time ROSSIYA states that the mayor strongly 
criticised the privatisation policy being pursued under the 
guidance of russian state property committee chief Anatoliy 
Chubays, pointing out that "this privatisation is ruining the 
economy".

  [Text] A resolution adopted by the Duma Geopolitics 
Committee says that the world public demands non-interference 
into the affairs of the republics of the former Yugoslavia. 
  The committee held hearings Tuesday on the possible 
escalation of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The 
restoration of a single democratic state is the sole way to 
discontinue the military, political, economic and inter-ethnic 
crisis in the republics of the former Yugoslavia, says the 
resolution. 
  The document says that the implementation of a NATO decision 
on air strike against the Serb positions near Sarajevo should be 
considered as an act of international terrorism. 
  The Russian president is proposed to use his right of veto 
at 
the UN Security Council, as well as lift economic sanctions, 
imposed by Russia against Yugoslavia. 
  Representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Vladimir 
Ivanovskiy, told deputies that the UN resolution on Yugoslavia 
puts responsibility for unblocking Sarajevo on the UN Secretary 
General and it is not necessary to convene the Security Council 
to take decision on air raids. This means that the use by 
Russia of its right to veto could be discussed only 
"hypothetically", he said. The UN resolution, said Ivanovskiy, 
allows the use of the military force only if there is threat to 
the safety zones, including Sarajevo, and to the relief convoys 
and UN peacekeepers.

Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Presidents of Russia and Tatarstan Boris Yeltsin and 
Mintimer Shaymiyev met in Moscow on Tuesday to sign a power 
sharing agreement between Moscow and Kazan. 
  The agreement delineates the two sides' areas of 
responsibility and defines what they must run together. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, Yeltsin and Shaimiyev have 
both pointed to the significance of the deal stressing that 
political and economic reforms must be based on civic peace, 
ethnic harmony and human rights priorities. 
  The treaty is based on "recognition of each other's 
constitutions without encroaching on their substance", Shaymiyev 
told Interfax on Monday. 
  The Tatar leader spoke of the country's need to be 
represented in both houses of the Federal Assembly following a 
power sharing agreement. "We must get involved in Russian 
affairs, defend the republic's interests and pursue an overall 
Russian policy to seek the emergence of Russia as a federal 
state", he said. (Tatarstan holds elections to the Federal 
Assembly on March 13 -- IF). 
  He said Tatarstan had never insisted on full independence 
calling for close bonds with Russia instead. 
  Shaymiyev says Tatarstan has managed to cushion off the 
effects of shock treatment of the economy and somewhat halt 
production slump due to the government's economic policy. He 
says that despite difficulties, Russia has the chance of turning 
into an advanced state if it goes ahead with reforms and makes 
less political and economic mistakes. 
  For his part, Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy 
Sergey Shakhray who drafted the paper described it as "a 
substantial breakthrough in the promotion of federal relations". 
In an interview with Interfax, he said that "for Russia, a 
federal structure is the only way of retaining the country's 
integrity and does not amount to a weakening of the state". 
  He said that neither the federal constitution nor Russian 
laws had been effective in Tatarstan for the past three years 
adding this could have led to a political crisis if allowed to 
persist. 
  Shakhray says that a new way of preparing documents has 
helped towards a success in bilateral talks. "We moved from 
concrete agreements to drafting an outline treaty. This helped 
not only flesh out the document but also mechanisms of enforcing 
it", he said. Shakhray thinks the new method will also enable 
to strike a similar deal with the Chechen republic though it 
will be different from that signed with Kazan. 
  The political effect of the treaty is Tatarstan's agreement 
to take part in elections to the Federal Assembly "which amounts 
to the republic's recognition of the Russian Federation's 
sovereignty, laws and constitution", he said. 
  Shakhray does not rule that other parts of the country may 
want to strike similar deals with the center. In his words, 
such a process is in line with the federal constitution which 
says such treaties can help towards economic and regional 
self-adjustment of the federation. Shakhray believes the 
Federal Assembly must adopt a law on power sharing as a way of 
regulating the process. 
  In his view, Tatarstan may also join parts of the federal 
treaty which coincide with the power sharing agreement signed on 
Tuesday.

  [Text] Kaliningrad, Russia, Feb 14, BNS -- The picket at 
the Russian Navy headquarters in Tallinn today was "peaceful" 
and "there were no provocations," Rear Admiral Anatoliy 
Gavrilov, commander of Russian Navy's Tallinn base, admitted in 
an interview with BNS. 
  He added that no extremist slogans targeting Russian 
military 
could be heard during the protest action. The organizers of the 
picket had warned the Tallinn base command of it in advance. 
  Gavrilov said the pickets, which will be repeated every 
Monday, are "designed to put pressure" on Russian politics. He 
linked them with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's 
recent statements. 
  "Judging by the speeches and the behaviour of the 
participants, it was clear they gathered in order to reassure 
themselves, not to express hostility toward us," Gavrilov told 
BNS.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitry Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] If "somebody tries to resolve issues concerning 
Bosnia without Russia's participation, we shall not let it 
happen." This statement was made in Moscow on Tuesday by 
President Boris Yeltsin after signing a number of 
British-Russian documents. 
  In answer to a question from Interfax's correspondent the 
Russian leader said that his partner in the talks -- Prime 
Minister John Major -- shares Moscow's view that it's essential 
"to transfer the military hardware surrounding Sarajevo to the 
U.N. forces, and compel the warring Bosnian sides "to settle 
their conflict peacefully" by means of talks. 
  Yeltsin confirmed however that the organizers of the 
possible 
attacks on the contingent of U.N. peace-keepers should be 
"punished." 
  Earlier on Tuesday the president's press secretary, 
Vyacheslav Kostikov, said that the possible "NATO air strikes on 
Serb positions would be inevitably associated in the eyes of 
international and Russian public opinion with the USA and with 
the recently proclaimed "Partnership for Peace" program. 
  "In my view this may do psychological damage to that 
diplomatic initiative," he stressed in an interview with 
Interfax. 
  "The world has not fully grasped the concept of that program 
yet," Kostikov said. "Many people may consider the bombing of 
Serb positions by NATO forces, in which the USA plays the 
leading role, as reflecting the ideology of "Partnership for 
Peace" in concrete terms. Since such turn of events is quite 
possible, the proposed operation may be viewed as a false start 
of the American initiative." 
  In his view, the president's press secretary pointed out, to 
resolve the Bosnian conflict politically would be in the 
interests of both the USA and Russia. 
  In the meantime the State Duma's committee on geopolitics 
conducted hearings on Tuesday and decided that the international 
public must not interfere in the affairs of former Yugoslav 
republics. 
  Deputies issued a resolution which calls for restoring "a 
unified democratic state" in the territory of former Yugoslavia. 
According to them, this is the only way to stop the bloodshed. 
  According to the resolution, the practical implementation of 
NATO's decision to bomb Serb positions around Sarajevo "should 
be viewed as an act of international terrorism". The document 
suggests that the Russian president should "use the right to 
veto in the U.N. security Council in regard to air strikes in 
former Yugoslavia, and resolve the issue of lifting by Russia 
economic sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia". 
  These decisions were not affected when a spokesman for 
Russia's Foreign Ministry, Vladimir Ivanovsky, addressed those 
present. He tried to explain that the U.N. resolution 
concerning former Yugoslavia lays responsibility for breaking 
the siege of Sarajevo on the U.N. secretary-general, and that in 
fact there is no need to convene the U.N. security Council for 
taking a decision on the use of aircraft. Under the 
circumstances the possibility of Russia's using the right to 
veto is purely "hypothetical", the diplomat said.

diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Leader of the Belarusian Parliament Mechyslaw Hryb 
has given a negative response to the indefinite strike called by 
the country's independent trade unions on Tuesday [15 February]. 
  Speaking in Minsk, he described the situation as compounded 
and called for political issues to be resolved through dialogue 
but not pressure or violence. 
  Hryb is sure that the strike was not initiated on the ground 
but from on high -- "the republican strike committee and 
opposition People's Front which are in pursuit of their own 
political goals having nothing to do with the interests of 
ordinary workers." The strike organizers demand the resignation 
of the government and dissolution of parliament. 
  The Belarusian leader says the strike "may delay the signing 
of a monetary union with Russia." 
  He also said that in the emerging situation, "the law 
enforcement bodies would act "within the legal framework and 
check any illegal action." 
  For his part, Prime Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich told Interfax 
that "the strike committee is trying to disorganize the national 
economy by capitalizing on economic hardships". 
  He described as groundless committee claims of calling for 
widespread stoppages. The Prime Minister said a large part of 
the factories came to a standstill for economic reasons long 
before the strike was called. 
  Interfax correspondents in Minsk say that a crowd of about 
2,000 people gathered in front of the Government House in 
Independence Square at 12:00 Moscow Time, but all approaches to 
the House itself are blocked by police units. Our 
correspondents who inspected nearby streets say they found no 
military hardware there. 
  The police are having to put up with the protesters' 
violation of the government ban on any mass action, except on 
state occasions, in Independence Square, a senior police 
official told Interfax on condition of anonymity. He said the 
police did not intervene to avoid "fuelling tension." 
  The demonstrators demand the government resign before the 
parliament convenes on February 22 or face an indefinite strike. 
  The protesters have decided to stage a march to the 
parliament building to hand in a petition demanding the 
dissolution of parliament. 
  It is still unclear how many people are involved in the 
general strike though preliminary reports from the regions say 
the committee's call failed to drum up widespread support on the 
ground. 
  In the meantime, messages of support to the strikers have 
come from independent trade unions of Russia and Ukraine and 
Russia's independent mineworkers unions, committee spokesman 
Aleksandr Lysenko told Interfax.

  [Text] Washington February 16 TASS -- Kazakh President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev, currently paying an official visit to the 
United States, arrives in New York from Washington on Tuesday 
evening. 
  While in Washington, Nazarbayev met leaders of some major 
international financial organisations. On Tuesday he received 
World Bank President Lewis Preston at Blair-House, the official 
residence of heads of state and government visiting Washington. 
Later in the day he met managing director of the International 
Monetary Fund Michel Camdessus. Nazarbayev also had talks with 
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown and First Deputy 
Secretary of the Treasury Roger Oltman. 
  "Good relations are shaping up between the international 
financial organisations and Kazakhstan," Nazarbayev told 
ITAR-TASS. Thanks to the influence of the International Monetary 
Fund and the U.S. Treasury, representatives of Western 
donor-countries have decided to grant Kazakhstan financial aid 
amounting to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, thrice the expected sum. 
During the meeting with the U.S. secretary of commerce, the 
sides discussed the possibility of setting up a joint 
commercial-economic commission, which could be headed from the 
American side by the U.S. secretary of commerce, and from the 
Kazakh side -- by the minister for foreign economic relations. 
The talks with first deputy secretary of the treasury focused 
on the problem of expanding American aid to Kazakhstan. 
  President Clinton announced on Monday that the United States 
would allocate to Kazakhstan 311 million U.S. dollars as 
compared to 91 million dollars last year. "I believe our 
relations will develop normally," Nazarbayev stressed. 
  The Kazakh leader received later in the day James Baker, 
former U.S. secretary of state, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, 
prominent American political scientist and former presidential 
adviser on national security. Then Nazarbayev met 
representatives of U.S. science and the arts in one of the 
Washington hotels. He told them about the results of his talks 
and the agreements reached with the American administration. He 
also replied to questions, particularly on the situation in the 
region where Kazakhstan is located, on his country's relations 
with Russia, and on cooperation in space research. The Kazakh 
president called at the embassy of his country in the United 
States.

  [Text] The annual presidential message to the Federal 
Assembly will be read on February 24, the president's chief of 
staff Sergey Filatov told the meeting of the State Duma Council 
Tuesday night [15 February]. 
  In his words, the date was changed from February 18 because 
Boris Yeltsin has not completely recovered from his recent 
illness and because representatives of the country's regions 
think the message should be read on the eve of the expanded 
government meeting which is scheduled for February 25. 
  The Council agreed with Filatov's arguments and left the 
debate of the Constitutional Court bill out of the Duma's 
February 17 agenda because the president's headquarters had to 
discuss numerous provisions of the bill with its authors, the 
Court. 
  Filatov also informed the State Duma Council on the 
proposal, 
made by the president's headquarters, on the housing of the 
lower house. Two or three months after the repair in the 
Russian Management Academy building is complete the Duma can 
move into it and next fall, into the former Gosplan's building 
in Okhotny Ryad. A decision was made that this proposal should 
be discussed first by parliamentary groups and then by a plenary 
session of the State Duma. 
  The lower house speaker Ivan Rybkin told the Council that 
President Yeltsin had decided to let former people's deputies of 
the USSR and Russia stay in their Moscow flats provided to them 
by the government.

  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- Vyacheslav Kostikov, 
spokesman of the Russian president, warned against speculations 
about the health of the Russian president and hinted that Boris 
Yeltsin is healthy enough to run for the second term of office 
in 1996. 
  "Political speculations based on rumours and malevolence 
about the health of Boris Yeltsin look extremely ugly and 
unpatriotic. This does not correspond to the Russian character," 
Kostikov said in a statement on Tuesday. 
  "I have to tell those who would like to use the question of 
the health of the president for their political intrigues and 
ambitions that the health of Boris Yeltsin allows him to 
reliably and resolutely run the country during the term of 
office fixed by the constitution, and in case of state necessity 
and the choice of the people, also outside this term," the 
spokesman stressed. 
  He was evidently referring to those political forces who 
hope 
to replace Yeltsin in case he steps down because of health 
reasons before his term of office expires in 1996. According to 
the constitution, early presidential elections become inevitable 
in this case. 
  Kostikov confirmed that the president had suffered from a 
strong cold of late and said that Yeltsin had to breach the 
advised medical regime to hold talks with visiting British Prime 
Minister John Major on Tuesday. 
  The spokesman added that Yeltsin had not yet recovered 
completely and thus the presidential "state of the nation" 
address to parliament may be postponed.

  [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS - The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
publishes on Thursday an interview with Deputy Chairman of the 
Central Bank Aleksandr Khandruyev. "The main task of the Central 
Bank is to curtail inflation", the newspaper quoted him as 
saying. "Jointly with the IMF and the World Bank a package of 
anti-inflation measures has been drafted in order to keep the 
situation under control and then considerably decrease the rate 
of inflation. The moderately tough financial policy which was 
determined yet in November 1992 will be preserved. However, the 
Central Bank is not going to implement the course at any price 
which can result in mass unemployment and a further decrease in 
living standards", he said. 
  Among other priority tasks Khandruyev listed "further reform 
in the settlement system and improval of the work of commercial 
banks". The newspaper commented that the bank will call on 
commercial banks to increase their charter capital, improve the 
licensing system, introduce world banking standards. 
  The Russian VESTI newspaper published on the front page 
reports by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Fuel 
and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik. "The agro-industrial 
complex faces a very difficult economic and financial 
situation", the newspaper writes. "The debt to agriculture 
amounted to 2.3 trillion roubles by the beginning of 1994, while 
the agro-industrial complex, in its turn, owes 1.8 trillion 
roubles for material resources". Zaveryukha believes that "the 
situation in agriculture can be stabilised only by state 
subsidies". 
  Shafranik said that mutual non-payments "had aggravated the 
crisis situation in fuel and energy complex to the maximum". 
Russian and CIS consumers owe the industry 11.6 trillion roubles 
for 1993 which is a 6.6-time increase compared to the previous 
year. 
  "Russia should not turn into a dumping ground for poisonous 
waste from the world", the KRASNAYA ZAVEZDA said in an article 
devoted to the dumping problem. It stressed that, according to 
a Greenpeace report, 96 attempts to bring to Russia dangerous 
toxic waste with a total volume of 34 million tonnes has been 
registered since 1987. More than a half of the attempts - 58 - 
took place during the last two years. Over 80 per cent of waste 
brought to Russia is of the German origin. Besides Russia, in 
1990-1991 nearly eight thousand tonnes of toxic waste were 
brought to Poland, 5,000 tonnes to Estonia, 3,500 tonnes to 
Romania, 270 tonnes to Ukraine and 40 tonnes to Lithuania, the 
daily added. 
  The PRAVDA, commenting on the NATO ultimatum to Bosnian 
Serbs, noted that "one cannot by pay attention to the more than 
strange metamorphosis of the United Nations". Instead of 
fulfilling the peace-keeping mission it actually turns into a 
"world gendarme who is ready to punish and does punish mostly 
those who do not suit the forces lobbying in the UN 
headquarters, rather than than those who act against peace and 
humanitarian principles". "There is an impression that the 
United Nations is distancing itself from initially proclaimed 
principles and turns from an impartial world arbiter into an 
instrument of politics of a group of countries headed by the 
USA", the daily said. 
  The TRUD publishes an interview with Mayor of Moscow Yuriy 
Luzhkov who, speaking about privatisation, said: "I believe it 
is impossible to sell for nothing state property which was 
created and accumulated in decades of work of many generations. 
(Privatisation Minister Anatoliy) Chubays either conceals the 
true state of things or does not understand anything in what he 
is doing". 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA publishes the speech of Communist 
Leader Gennadiy Zyuganov who summed up the results of the party 
activities in the first year since the August 1991 ban on it was 
lifted. Zyuganov noted, in particular, that the Communist Party 
"is the biggest in strength and the third in the number of 
electorate, has organisations in all regions and enjoys a rather 
numerous and influential faction in the Federal Assembly".

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] Premier Vyacheslav Kebich has abolished the State 
Secretariat for Struggle with Crime and for National Security by 
his ordinance. 
  According to governmental sources, a department for 
coordination of administrative bodies' activities was 
established instead of the former state secretariat. The newly 
established department is led by Belarussian People's Deputy, 
former First Deputy State Secretary Valeriy Pavlov. 
  At the same time, Kebich introduced a new post in the 
Cabinet 
of Ministers -- the State Secretary for National Security, the 
rank of who in the official hierarchy is close to an envoy. 
Former State Secretary, Gennadiy Danilov, (who is considered 
by observers in Minsk as one of the most influential people in 
the circles close to the premier) was appointed to this post. 
  Among the new secretary's duties there is coordination of 
activities carried out by all law enforcement structures and by 
the army and aimed at combating the crime. According to 
governmental sources, Kebich demanded that Danilov urgently work 
out "a national program on very strict measures for struggle 
with this evil." 
  According to the results of the recently held public opinion 
poll published by the government's press service on Wednesday, 
as many as 32.7 percent of respondents believe that the crisis 
in the republic could be overcome through strengthening of the 
struggle with mafia and corruption. 
  Answering to the question who could withdraw the country 
from 
the crisis, a total of 10.3 percent of respondents called 
Kebich; 6.8 percent Head of the temporary parliamentary 
commission on struggle with corruption, Aleksandr Lukashenko; 
4.2 percent Mechyslaw Hryb; 3.4 percent Leader of the Belarusian 
People's Front, Zyanon Paznyak and 0.8 percent of respondents 
put their confidence in the parliament's former Speaker, 
Stanislav Shushkevich. 
  The rest of the respondents said there was no such leader in 
the republic or found it hard to give a definite answer.

<F P=106> [Statement read by Uladzimir Pyatrovich Zametalin, press </F>
secretary of Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, from the 
"Panorama" feature; place and date not given; live or recorded] 
  [Text] Good evening, viewers! In connection with the fact 
that some mass media -- first and foremost Ostankino Television 
-- are making tendentious comments on the recent developments in 
Belarus, I consider it my duty to comment on a statement that 
was issued on this occasion and distributed via all mass media 
channels today. The Belarusian nation, which lost one quarter 
of all its people during World War II, values stability and its 
joint historic roots with the fraternal Russian people more than 
anything else. The attempts to wreck the natural integration 
processes of the two sovereign states -- Belarus and Russia -- 
have no future because they lack common sense. Belarusian 
national extremists are pursuing this policy contrary to the 
desire of the absolute majority of Belarusian people to restore 
historical logic to the further development of the two fraternal 
states. This is why the public did not back the so-called 
all-Belarusian political strike on 15 February. The working 
people of Belarus proved themselves to be at a higher level and 
wiser than the nationalist adventurers, and they gave preference 
to the constitutional path of socially oriented reforms. The 
calls of the strike organizers had the opposite effect and 
brought people out into the squares of many Belarusian towns to 
demand firm social guarantees and rigid control over the 
economy, including the restoration of the USSR. 
  The strike, in which between 100,000 and 3,000 [as heard] 
people participated in various regions, allows us to state 
definitely that Belarus remains a democratic, constitutional, 
and stable state. The planned political action aimed at 
torpedoing the economic union that is being created between 
Belarus and Russia was a failure. In this situation, we greatly 
regret to report that Ostankino Television newscasts gave 
tendentious coverage to the developments in Belarus. Not only 
was the comment on the political strike in the newscasts 
extremely exaggerated, and not only was an absurd, preposterous 
conclusion made about instability in Belarus, but the right to 
speak on behalf of the Belarusian people was kindly given to 
Zyanon Paznyak, leader of the Belarusian Popular Front, who is 
known in the Republic for his extreme views rejecting everything 
that is Slavic and Russian. Ostankino Television did not see 
fit to consider that, according to opinion polls, the so-called 
Belarusian national democrats are supported by only 7 or 8 
percent of the population. 
  At sharp turning points in history, politics cannot and must 
not be out of step with public opinion [passage indistinct] in 
strict accordance with the international agreement on human 
political rights, by which I mean clauses 19 and 20 of that 
document. Thank you. I wish you all the best.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo February 17 TASS--The present Ukrainian 
parliament will have no time to settle the question of Ukraine's 
accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, handing over 
this problem to the new legislature to be elected on March 27, 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said in an interview with 
the Japanese ASAHI newspaper in Kiev on Thursday. 
  The president said, the newspaper notes, that he "favours 
stronger economic cooperation with Russia" but denies the 
existence of a territorial issue and that "the international 
community will not recognise" stronger political ties between 
the Crimea and Russia. 
  Kravchuk referred to the tripartite agreement on the 
withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, which was signed by 
him as well as by the Russian and U.S. presidents in Moscow. 
Under this agreement, Washington assumed the role of a 
guarantor of Ukraine's territorial integrity and inviolability 
of its borders. 
  Among outstanding issues between Ukraine and Russia, 
Kravchuk 
singled out a package of questions connected with the future of 
the Black Sea Fleet. For instance, he is worried over how and 
at what price to sell the Ukrainian part of the divided fleet to 
Russia. 
  The president also expressed hope for a success of his 
coming 
U.S. visit on March 4 and his meeting with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. According to Kravchuk, this visit will "help change 
the position of the international community on Ukraine which 
will become a nuclear-free state". 
  The Ukrainian president expressed his expectations that the 
United States will fulfill its obligations to boost financial 
aid to Ukraine. "Its total sum will possibly amount to 600 or 
700 million dollars," he said.

  [Text] On 12 February, in the Sevastopol port arrival and 
departure building, a ceremony was held of hoisting the 
Ukrainian naval flag on the small ASW ship "Lutsk". The ship 
was built at the Kiev "Leninska Kuznya" plant. After the 
completion of all the running and state tests, it was added to 
the Ukrainian Fleet. The ship is more that 70 meters long and 
more than 10 meters wide; its speed is more than 50 knots. 
Captain Third Rank Viktor Zaremba was appointed as the ship's 
captain. 
  The ceremony was attended by Ukraine's Minister of Defense, 
Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy; commander of Ukraine's Naval 
Forces Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, and leaders of Sevastopol, 
Lutsk, and Volyn Oblast state administrations. Metropolitan of 
Lutsk and of Volyn Oblast Ioann (the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, 
Kiev Patriarchate) consecrated the ship and blessed the sailors. 
  Near the ladder of the ship, Vitaliy Radetskyy gave a news 
conference. He confirmed that Sevastopol will be the main base 
and the headquarters of Ukraine's Naval Forces. Having given a 
high assessment to Ukraine's signing of the NATO Partnership for 
Peace program in Brussels, V. Radetskyy said that "Even now, 
Ukraine's armed forces have everything necessary to be an equal 
partner of NATO." According to him, the Ukrainian Army may 
conduct joint exercises with armies of other states and "the 
future presence of Ukraine's Naval Forces in the Mediterranean 
Sea is not ruled out," as is stipulated in the documents signed 
in Brussels. 
  In connection with Crimean president Yu. Meshkov's 
statements 
on the demilitarization of the Crimea at the expense of the 
Black Sea Fleet, Ukraine's army general pointed out that, in his 
opinion, this problem must be resolved in two stages. An 
inventory of the Black Sea Fleet, as of 1991, must be carried 
out, and its units and formations must be reduced to an 
optimally needed quantity. In general, "these questions may 
only be resolved by Ukraine's president and the Supreme Council."

  [Text] Ukraine's Defense Minister Army General Vitaliy 
Radetskyy met foreign officials accredited in our state. The 
leader of the military department [Defense Ministry of Ukraine] 
informed the guests about the development of the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces, about the problems emerging from this, and he replied to 
numerous questions from the foreign diplomats. The general 
underlined that Ukraine, as a peace-loving state, would 
gradually reduce its own Armed Forces and take an active part in 
tackling the problems of European and regional security. As far 
as the solution of the Yugoslav issue is concerned, the defense 
minister remarked that this could only be done in the course of 
a peaceful negotiation process with all the interested parties 
involved. 
  The diplomats also took an interest in the issue of the 
Black 
Sea Fleet's division. In the opinion of the military department 
leader, it is necessary, first and foremost, to draw up an 
inventory at state level of all the Black Sea Fleet's property 
as of December 1991, and subsequently reduce its numerical 
strength, and only then to decide on which share of the Black 
Sea Fleet belongs to whom.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations February 16 TASS -- The United 
Nations Security Council completed here on Tuesday its open 
debate on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition 
to 15 members of the Security Council, the floor was also taken 
by representatives of 57 other countries. 
  As on the previous day, the deliberations focused on the 
NATO 
Council's decision to deal air strikes in Bosnia. Algerian 
delegate Ramtane Lamanra urged the United Nations "to pursue a 
tough policy" in Bosnia, while Jordanian representative Fu'ad 
Batayinah reiterated the Western thesis that the "NATO decision 
to deal air strikes is in full accordance with resolutions of 
the Security Council". 
  Contrary to this, Ukrainian delegate Volodymyr Handohiy said 
that NATO air strikes in Bosnia were fraught with unpredictable 
military and political consequences for all the world, that such 
decisions should be adopted by the U.N. Security Council and not 
by individual states. 
  "Ukraine is deeply disturbed by the fact that U.N. forces 
could become targets of reply blows from radical Serbian field 
commanders if air strikes are launched even on a limited scale," 
Handohiy stressed. "Taking this into account, the United Nations 
may find itself deeply involved in a military confrontation with 
unpredictable military and political consequences not only for 
the region, but for the world as a whole," he added. 
  The Ukrainian representatative stressed that he did not rule 
out the use of all the available means, including armed forces, 
in reply to hostile actions in areas where U.N. forces are 
deployed, and also when there is no other way to stop the 
killing of innocent people. "However, such actions should be 
taken only when there is a clearly expressed decision of the 
Security Council," Handohiy stated. 
  "NATO air strikes in Bosnia will not help achieve a lasting 
political settlement of the Bosnian problem. They will merely 
cross out everything that has already been achieved during the 
peace talks," permanent delegate of the United Republic of 
Yugoslavia on the United Nations Dragomir Dzekic stated. "The 
United Republic of Yugoslavia bluntly objects to this decision," 
he stressed. "It will make the prospects for overcoming the 
crisis even more uncertain. Any attempt to deal air strikes will 
signify direct involvement in a civil war in behalf of one of 
the sides involved in it. Those who advocate this, will bear 
responsibility for the inevitable consequences and for the 
possible escalation of the conflict." 
  After the open debate, Chairman of the Security Council 
Roble 
Olhaye (Djibouti) told journalists that no decision would be 
passed on the results of the discussion. "We simply gave 
everybody a chance to express their view on the problem," Olhaye 
noted.

  [Text] Delegations from the Ukrainian and Kazakhstani 
Defense Ministries have concluded negotiations they held in 
Almaty by signing a joint communique. The delegations were led 
by Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Oliynyk and Alibek 
Kasimov, the Kazakhstani Armed Forces chief of staff. 
  The NOVYNY television and radio agency learned that the 
Ukrainian side said it was ready for technical and scientific 
cooperation in developing new types of equipment and in 
modernizing the already existing one. Mutual assistance between 
Kazakhstan and Ukraine in this sphere will enable this work to 
be carried out as efficiently as possible. The communique 
deemed promising the cooperation of both countries in developing 
their rocket and space capabilities. The Kazakhstani delegation 
expressed its interest in a more intensive utilization of 
Ukraine's repair facilities for the benefit of the Kazakhstani 
Armed Forces. A mechanism for settling mutual accounts will 
soon be determined, including the quick liquidation of debts. 
Both sides noted the vast opportunities for cooperation between 
the Kazakhstani and Ukrainian Defense Ministries in the sphere 
of logistical support, military training, and other military 
aspects. These kinds of bilateral consultations are in 
compliance with international commitments and do not encroach on 
the interests of third countries. During the negotiations, an 
agreement was reached to hasten work by Kazakhstan and Ukraine 
intended to finalize a military cooperation treaty.

  [Text] Russia has granted the Republic of Crimea the most 
favoured nations status, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov told a 
press conference on Wednesday, highlighting the results of his 
talks in Moscow. 
  "All the decisions taken in Moscow will be implemented and 
all of the necessary preliminary agreements have been reached," 
he said. The goal we have pursued for several years -- the 
economic unity of Russia and Crimea -- has been attained, he 
added. 
  Meshkov said that the problem of making the Russian ruble a 
legitimate payment unit in Crimea has practically been solved. 
  "The technique and methods of doing so is Crimea's affair," 
he said. He also added that it was vitally important for the 
Crimean economy to have the ruble as a payment unity by the 
beginning of summer. 
  "No one should shun benefit," he stated. 
  "In Crimea reforms will develop the traditional way, and the 
systems of civil laws will be levelled up to create a legal 
foundation for uniting the Crimean and Russian economies," he 
told Interfax-Ukraine. "We cannot neglect the processes which 
are going on in Russia and which will occur in Ukraine," he said. 
  To quote the Crimean president, Russia is well aware of 
Crimea's economic problems and has a favorable attitude to 
Crimea. "Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the officials 
representing the Ukrainian economy," he said. He noted, 
however, that Russia's positive attitude to Crimea did not mean 
a demonstrative rupture of economic ties with Ukraine. On the 
contrary, we'll have more opportunities for broadening our 
relations," he said. 
  He announced that Crimea's trade and economic mission will 
be 
established in Moscow to coordinate relations with Russia. He 
suggested that the missions of Russia and of Crimea's neighbors 
-- the Krasnodar and Stavropol territories and the Rostov-on-Don 
region -- would be set up in Simferopol. He said that only God 
Almighty was higher than the level of the Moscow talks. 
  Commenting on the appointment of Yevgeniy Saburov to the 
post 
of Crimea's premier, he said that this particular appointment 
was extremely advantageous. 
  He noted that he did not call Kiev to give an account of his 
talks in Moscow to the Ukrainian president. He said, however, 
that a delegation of the Crimean Cabinet, led by Acting Prime 
Minister Anatoliy Franchuk, had arrived in Kiev. The 
preliminary results of the talks are positive, he said.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Split" rubric: "Two </F>
Deputies Leave Zhirinovskiy. LDPR Leaders Claim the Renegades 
Have Discredited Themselves"] 
  [Text] The languishing scandal that began as early as two 
days ago has finally burst from within the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] faction into the open. Despite 
contradictory statements of various liberal democrats, we 
managed to find out the essence: Two deputies -- Viktor Kobelev 
(No. 2 on the party's electoral list) and Aleksandr Pronin -- 
have left the LDPR faction. Kobelev himself says it was his 
voluntary decision. His opponent, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, 
claims that "we have expelled them for actions that discredit 
the title of deputy." According to Mr. Kobelev, his walkout, 
which was prompted by personal relations, is a harbinger of a 
serious split. In fact, another energetic LDPR deputy, Mr. 
Marychev, said that he supported Viktor Kobelev's actions. "We 
have the entire St. Petersburg LDPR organization on our side and 
many other deputies," Mr. Marychev insisted. 
  In the rebels' view, however, they will be able to stay on 
in 
the party and even to counterpoise it to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
"I have headed the LDPR staff; I know the party from "A" to 
"Z," and I am a modest man in that regard," Mr. Kobelev said. 
In his opinion, the mutiny will be supported by a majority of 
Liberal Democrats, including by the deputies who "came to the 
Duma to work, not to boost their social status." As for the 
deputies, this threat does not appear to be ringing hollow. In 
fact there are a number of deputy groups within the LDPR that 
are made up of deputies who came to the State Duma in the hope 
of making their own political career. Naturally, they have been 
riled by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's contemptuous attitude to 
parliamentary activity and his bent for presidential elections. 
Mr. Zhirinovskiy himself does not make any bones about the fact 
that deputies are only his transient companions and that few of 
them will be trusted with accompanying him "along the path 
leading up to power." A group of deputies close to the 
communists under Mr. Kobelev was the first to have run out of 
patience. 
  Viktor Kobelev hopes that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will "take 
steps to meet them halfway," disavow his "personal statements 
and return to the LDPR rules and program." For dwarfish parties 
that are held together by one leader, splits are a common 
phenomenon. The LDPR is effectively also a dwarfish party, the 
only complication being the 59 deputy seats it holds. If 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy manages to find legal grounds for 
replacing his ambitious colleagues in parliament with 
trustworthy and devoted people, the "cleanliness of party ranks" 
will be guaranteed. In principle, an electoral association, 
such as the LDPR, may recall its defiant deputies. The snag is, 
however, that the numbers of those disgruntled by Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy's escapades may grow at the expense of other 
internal "cliques." Then the LDPR leader will lose his 
faction's support. Which will not come as a surprise given the 
peculiarities of Russian electoral legislation, which puts on 
the verge of a split all parties hastily set up according to God 
knows what principles.

<F P=106> [Yan Ulanskiy report in the "Scandal" column: "Divorce in </F>
the Family of V.V. Zh.," with commentary by Mikhail Shchipanov] 
  [Text] Speaking at a State Duma plenary session yesterday, 
Viktor Kobelev, who was number two on the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDPR] slate, announced his disagreement with the ways of 
V.V. Zh. [Zhirinovskiy], as well as his decision to leave the 
faction. He was joined by another LDPR member, Aleksandr Pronin. 
  V.V. Zh. would not put up with such an escapade from his 
associates, saying that the "scoundrels and scumbags Kobelev and 
Pronin have already been expelled from the party and the 
election slate for conduct impermissible for a deputy, and also 
for criminal offenses." 
  Kobelev, however, dismissed these accusations as false, 
noting that if V.V. Zh. does not calm down, he (Kobelev) would 
match each of these strikes with ten. "I remain in the LDPR 
Supreme Council because the question of my expulsion may be 
decided only by a party congress." Nonetheless, Kobelev has not 
so far decided whether he will create his own faction with his 
supporters in the LDPR, stressing, however, that many of them 
are ready to follow his suit and leave V.V. Zh.'s faction. 
According to Kobelev, V.V. Zh.'s extremist tricks, unauthorized 
by the LDPR congress, do not fit into the party program or 
rules. Therefore in the very near future one can expect not 
only the disintegration of the Zhirinovskiy faction, but also a 
split within the LDP. 
<H5>  Afterword </H5>
  The departure of two dissident liberals can be the thin end 
of a wedge that bodes no good for Zhirinovskiy. Indeed, there 
is nothing sensational in the mere fact of factional desertion: 
there have been plenty of precedents while small factions and 
groups, anxious to expand their base, are dead set against the 
principle: either you are loyal to your party commitment in the 
State Duma, or put your membership card down on the table. 
Moreover, to V.V. Zh.'s shame and humiliation, there is no 
mechanism for recalling a deputy. And therefore all of his 
threats to throw the fugitive out into the street are just as 
menacing as this promise to send five Russian divisions to the 
Balkans. 
  It is another matter that the great leader envisioned his 
"flock of falcons" lining up solidly behind him, and now this 
nuisance. Why? Have they finally seen the light? But this is 
simply ridiculous: Don't V.V. Zh.'s closest associates already 
know his true colors? This "recovery of sight," however, can be 
other than ideological. The people who have come into 
parliament on the LDP slate have been rumored to express their 
discontent with V.V. Zh.'s insufficient clout in distributing 
parliamentary posts and portfolios: apparently he has secured 
too few comfortable chairs in committees and subcommittees for 
his associates. Obviously, trust in Zhirinovskiy's omnipotence 
has been shaken. Moreover, some of his followers began to 
realize that in the leader's shadows one can easily catch a 
cold. At the same time, it was clear that the first person to 
challenge Zhirinovskiy on his own turf could immediately emerge 
from obscurity into the limelight, launching his own 
parliamentary career with a noisy scandal which has attracted 
the attention of the press and colleagues. 
  The design is fairly accurate. It is only that it speaks 
about the true motives of Zhirinovskiy's "falcons" a little too 
plainly.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- Russian Government Press 
Officer Valentin Sergeyev told a press conference in the 
Russian-American Information Centre today that the restriction 
of access to government meetings for journalists was a temporary 
measure caused by organisational difficulties associated with 
the moving of the government from Staraya Square to the "White 
House", the former seat of the disbanded Russian Parliament. 
Sergeyev rejected accusations of deliberate blocking of the 
press. 
  He assured journalists that a new press centre, seating 150 
reporters, will open in the government's new headquarters in two 
weeks. 
  He promised to help journalists in arranging interviews with 
cabinet ministers, but said government presidium meetings were 
not a show, and will be accessible only to correspondents of 
federal news agencies and state television. 
  Sergeyev stressed that the government was interested, as 
never before, in making its decisions, popular or otherwise, 
known and understandable to the people. He complained that the 
press was keen on criticising the government and was reluctant 
to promote educational publications about its activity.

<F P=106> [Article by Yiannis Yiannikos, president of PRAVDA </F>
International joint stock company: "We Respect PRAVDA's 
Traditions"] 
  [Excerpts] Recently there has been a lot of talk and many 
rumors surrounding PRAVDA and our company. So I cannot keep 
quiet and want to share with readers my view of what has 
happened. 
  We came to PRAVDA as friends. We came about two years ago 
when complete closure threatened the newspaper because of 
financial difficulties. Our company helped the editorial office 
to settle its debts, and as a result of our cooperation PRAVDA 
began to be published regularly, five times a week again instead 
of three. [passage omitted] 
  We have always respect, continue to respect, and will 
respect 
PRAVDA's traditions. Therefore we did not interfere before in 
either the creative process or the political line of the 
newspaper and we shall not do so in the future. Incidentally, 
the stories in some publications that someone was dismissed by 
the joint stock company directors' council for his political 
convictions is blatant slander. The company does not engage in 
such matters at all. The terms of our cooperation are enshrined 
in the contract: democracy and pluralism. We realize that we 
are dealing with an opposition newspaper but a genuine 
opposition is always creative because it does not destroy the 
country but helps the people to resolve their important problems. 
  But when the newspaper's new chief editor was elected in 
October the atmosphere at the PRAVDA International joint stock 
company changed drastically. For us it was a complete surprise: 
V. Linnik had been on the joint stock company directors' 
council for nearly two years and in contrast to G. Seleznev and 
A. Ilin he invariably supported any proposal of ours. Having 
become chief editor he and some of his supporters steered a 
course toward destroying the joint stock company, ruining the 
cooperation to which they had previously been loyal, and 
reneguing on agreements and commitments, including those backed 
by V. Linnik's signature (and I respect people who do not betray 
the promise they have made). For that they even agreed to stop 
PRAVDA's production. A campaign of lies and slander began. 
  Our relations of cooperation with the most esteemed Russian 
newspaper are now being restored. On 4 February this year a 
meeting of the editorial collective confirmed that the newspaper 
will be published within the framework of the PRAVDA 
International joint stock company. It will be published 
regularly and reach all subscribers, wherever they may live. It 
has already been decided to ensure stable and permanent 
financing for PRAVDA's printing. I hope that in the very near 
future the newspaper's staffers will have no complaints about 
their wages either. The statements issued in recent weeks that 
the Russian PRAVDA International company is bankrupts and has no 
money are completely untrue. Incidentally, we are now having to 
pay V. Linnik's debts too. 
  There is a great deal of speculation on the subject of 
whether PRAVDA has become a Greek newspaper. I have been 
investing money in it for about two years but never for a single 
day has it ceased to be a Russian publication concerned for the 
destiny of its own country?! And the permanent staff of PRAVDA 
International include about 200 Russian citizens and just one 
Greek -- the financial director of the joint stock company. It 
is clear that he cannot deal with the newspaper's creative 
business. His main concern is normal financing for PRAVDA. 
  I am reproached for refusing any contacts with Russian 
businessman and not wanting their cooperation in the company 
which we have created in conjunction with PRAVDA. That is 
utterly untrue. With the approval of the majority of PRAVDA 
employees substantial business contracts are now being concluded 
with major Russian entrepreneurs. Their aim is to elaborate 
long-term programs of cooperation for the benefit of PRAVDA, 
PRAVDA employees, and readers. I think they will end 
successfully. 
  I realize that my PRAVDA friends are working in complex 
conditions and that it is hard for PRAVDA readers to live. I 
respect those who make the newspaper and those at whom it is 
aimed. I want to help our common cause of peace, the friendship 
of the peoples, and the attainment of people's prosperity.

  [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- The publication of the 
weekly GLASNOST has been resumed. The weekly was funded by the 
former Central Committee of the CPSU. Its publication was 
stopped by the order of the former Ministry of the Press and 
Information of the Russian Federation after the events of August 
3-4 last year. Late in January the court annulled the ministry's 
decision, stating that the weekly had not been published from 
September 9 and so could not have been involved directly in the 
bloody events in Moscow. 
  The publication founded by the work collective of the 
editorial office has been renewed as an "all-union political 
weekly", Alexey Veretennikov, assistant editor of GLASNOST, told 
ITAR-TASS. The weekly has not changed its political positions. 
It declares "for the restoration of the USSR and unification of 
the communist parties". The assistant editor said that among 
contributors to the publication are Anatoliy Lukyanov, Oleg 
Shenin, Nikolay Ryzhkov.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on memorandum on organized crime drawn </F>
up by Socioeconomic Policy Analysis Center under president's 
administration: "Russian Mafia Compiling Dossier on Major 
Officials and Politicians"] 
  [Text] IZVESTIYA has a copy of a memorandum drawn up by 
the Socioeconomic Policy Analysis Center under the Russian 
Federation president's administration, which is headed by Petr 
Filippov. The document is called "Organized Crime and the 
Prospects of National Socialists Coming to Power in Russia." 
  It says, in particular, that the growth of organized crime, 
which is interwined with the Internal Affairs Ministry organs 
and local executive authorities, threatens Russia's political 
and economic development and creates real conditions for 
national socialists to come to power. In Russian cities and 
rayon centers literally all owners of stalls, stores, cafes, and 
restaurants pay money to bandit groups. All market vendors and 
car importers pay them money. Some 70-80 percent of privatized 
enterprises and commercial banks have been victims of extortion 
of late. The size of the payment (a kind of tax benefiting 
bandit groupings and corrupt officials) is 10-20 percent of the 
turnover, which often exceeds the enterprise's final profits. 
  Bandit formations have informers everywhere in the militia 
organs, traffic police, and banks. According to entrepreneurs 
in Tver, a vehicle will be stopped by racketeers if they get 
word from a traffic police checkpoint that it is carrying a 
valuable load. 
  Vladimir administration leaders confirmed that attempts to 
carry out surprise searches of bandit groupings' headquarters 
were blocked because they had been alerted through the traffic 
police-Internal Affairs Ministry system. In Moscow transport 
inspectors are unable to monitor the work of mobile service 
stations because the illegal traders are alerted by traffic 
police personnel. 
  In Kazan only bandits are allowed to drive foreign cars, 
Volgas, and Zhiguli-9's. Other citizens have these cars taken 
away from them. The same rule has applied for some time in St. 
Petersburg too. Bandit groupings have started to demand money 
from farmers, market gardeners, and inhabitants of suburban 
settlements in Kazan. A similar practice is now being 
introduced in the Moscow region. 
  In Tver entrepreneurs are required to obtain permission from 
the leaders of bandit groupings to set up a stall or open a 
store. Only with their consent will the local authorities issue 
licenses. Independent entrepreneurs have been driven out of some 
areas of activity altogether, since organized crime is financing 
on very favorable terms (a very large interest-free loan, for 
example) young people who are prepared to cooperate. As a 
result they have a significant advantage over their competitors 
(of course, when they achieve some success they surrender a 
large part of the profit as payment for the credit). 
Incidentally, this distingishes the situation in our country 
from the situation in Western Europe and the United States: 
There organized crime controls only "criminal" areas of 
activity, such as prostitution, the drugs trade, and gambling. 
In Russia organized crime controls all types of activity. 
  The extra tax paid to the bandits and the artificial 
restrictions on business activity for the purpose of obtaining 
massive monopoly profits lead to price rises of 20-30 percent. 
The population's living standards fall accordingly. 
  The memorandum notes that organized crime's accumulation of 
capital during 1991-1993 has been vast. Some of it is 
transferred abroad through banking structures (under threat of 
physical violence), but this does not save the bank managers. 
They are eliminated because they know about the secret deposits. 
Bankers have the highest death rate among entrepreneurs. 
  In Russian cities a large class of young hoods has 
developed, 
whose sole function is racketeering and obtaining money. In St. 
Petersburg there are tens of thousands of these hoods, 500 of 
whom are hardened criminals. They all have high incomes and 
drive foreign cars. They take over restaurants and cafes and do 
not allow ordinary mortals into them. 
  The boom in organized crime is closely linked to the 
economic 
status of entrepreneurs and privatized enterprises. The 
extremely intricate tax system that exists at the moment does 
not encourage enterprises to increase profits. For instance, 
according to the calculations of M. Kabakov, director of the 
machine building plant named for Kalinin, the plant's doubling 
of its profits through drastic economies and manpower cuts will 
only increase net profits by two percent. Under the present tax 
system an entrepreneur who owns a distillery can only ensure 
11-percent profitability, given an inflation level of 1,000 
percent per year. Entrepreneurs are forced to conceal income. 
Bandit groups find out about these things through agents and 
tell the entrepreneurs that if they do not pay them money they 
will be "handed over" to the tax police. The entrepreneurs 
reckon, not unreasonably, that it is better and safer to pay the 
bandits. 
  In the banking sphere centralized credits distributed 
outside 
the tender system are the economic basis of organized crime. 
Some 10-20 percent of the cash earned on commission is taken 
in exchange for these credits. The abandonment of targeted 
credits would make it possible to eliminate the economic basis 
of organized crime. 
  All the aforesaid, the memorandum says, means that an entire 
generation is growing up for whom the situation is normal and 
who, when in difficulty, turn not to the official authorities, 
but to the unofficial authorities. These people will sooner 
hire killers to punish a partner who has gone wrong than go to 
the courts or seek arbitration. 
  The Analysis Center concludes that if this continues, we may 
arrive at a situation similar to that in Latin America or, say, 
Italy, where policy is actually determined not by government or 
parliament, but by organized crime. In particular, there is no 
longer any doubt that the leaders of Russian organized crime are 
compiling a meticulous dossier on all major officials and 
politicians. In these conditions Zhirinovskiy's populist 
promises to establish strict order could attract tens of 
millions of Russians and -- which would be particularly 
dangerous -- hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs to the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] banners. A failure to take 
decisive steps to remove the economic roots of crime and provide 
the laws to combat organized crime amd the absence of political 
will in the fight against organized crime could bring the 
national socialists to power during the 1996 presidential 
elections. 
  What needs to be done, in the analysts' opinion? Practice 
shows that it is futile to depend on local militia departments 
to combat organized crime. Informers give the bandits several 
days' notice of impending raids so they can lie low. Only the 
creation of well equipped special formations, reporting direct 
to the president and located outside cities, will make for an 
effective fight against organized crime. These formations would 
have access to information stored in Internal Affairs Ministry 
organs. 
  According to experts, in order to arrest the organizers, 
leaders, and "godfathers" of bandit groupings in a city such as 
St. Petersburg all you need is special formations numbering 100 
men. These detachments must have extensive rights (for example, 
preventive detention for a period of several months) and major 
privileges, in particular: a large salary ($250-300 as of 
December 1993), an official apartment, of which the occupant 
automatically becomes owner on his retirement, compulsory life 
insurance, and so on. If evidence of corruption comes to light 
the employee will be automatically sacked and stripped of all 
privileges. These detachments should not include anyone who has 
served in the Internal Affairs Ministry or KGB (Security 
Ministry) in the past, but they should be given access to all 
the information collected by these departments. At the same 
time, a committee should be set up along the lines of the U.S. 
FBI. Its employees would monitor certain regions, with frequent 
changes of personnel. 
  If such structures were created, organized crime's current 
freedom from punishment would rebound on it, since at the 
present time its members have no fears and their names are well 
known in every militia station. 
  Internal Affairs Ministry personnel could be drafted in from 
from other cities for use in operations to put down organized 
crime. Having no links with organized crime in that particular 
city, they would be able to assist the president's special 
detachments. You can catch two or three members of bandit 
groupings these days by raiding restaurants or cafes. 
Practically all of them carry illegal weapons or they could be 
charged on other grounds. Since the organization of bandit 
groupings depends entirely on their leaders, the preventive 
detention of them for a period of several months and the 
severing of links with informers in Internal Affairs Ministry 
organs and the local administration will destroy the bandit 
groups. This is evidenced by the fact that even if a leader 
goes on "leave" for a month the bandit grouping is paralyzed. 
  Changes must be made to the Criminal and Criminal Procedure 
Codes providing the organs combating organized crime with wider 
rights. They should be given the right to preventively detain 
people suspected of involvement in organized crime for a period 
of up to three months without charge. Tax legislation should be 
radically reformed, with the emphasis switching to the taxation 
of resources and, above all, land. We should dramatically 
curtail the use of the mechanism of quotas and licenses, 
switching to the regulation of foreign economic relations 
through duties. The granting of targeted credits should be 
abandoned. We must switch to the allocation of Russian Central 
Bank credits on a competitive basis.

  [Text] Russia's Economics Ministry on Tuesday [15 February] 
submitted to the government an analysis of the economic 
situation in the country and proposals for its improvement. 
  The ministry's main conclusion is that "no radical, 
strategic 
changes should be made in the government's course," senior 
ministry official Mikhail Kopeikin told Interfax. But more 
emphasis should be put in the 1993-95 government program on 
social security measures, he said. Those proposals "largely 
correspond to what is suggested by Academicians Leonid Abalkin, 
Stanislav Shatalin and others," although the Economics Ministry 
disagrees with those who argue that the social security policy 
should be set out in the first section of the program and all 
further changes should depend on it, Kopeikin said. "We are 
against changing the structure of the government program," he 
said. 
  The social security measures proposed by the Economics 
Ministry include penalties for the violation of minimum social 
security guarantees, concrete measures to help the poorer 
population strata and the involvement of nongovernmental bodies 
in the financing of the social security policy. 
  The ministry also stands for tighter state control of the 
economy, Kopeikin said. 
  He said he was a member of a group, formed recently and 
headed by Deputy Economics Minister Sergei Vasilyev, which was 
working on a list of priority financial, economic, social 
security and other measures to be taken within the next two to 
three months. All proposals made by the group, which had its 
first sitting on February 12, would be sent to the prime 
minister, Kopeikin said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS -- The Russian national 
economy minister plans to contain the federal budget deficit at 
5-6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product in 1994 as against 11 
percent in 1993, and bring down the inflation rate to 8-10 
percent a month by end of year from more than 22 percent in 
January, according to Deputy Minister Yakov Urinson. Urinson 
said that if the plan worked, capital investments would 
increase, the production slump would halt and stabilization 
would begin along with the improvement of the living standards. 
  The ministry leaders are now "airing" their plans for 1994 
in 
the economic circles in a bid to drum up support for further 
market reforms and a moderately tough financial and monetary 
policy. 
  The ministry vows support to the most vulnerable groups of 
the population by fixing general spending on public needs at 16 
percent of the Gross Domestic Product. The exact amount will 
depend on revenues. To ensure these, the ministry intends to 
preserve the present taxation system, whose stability and 
predictability is expected to make it easier for the 
entrepreneurs to adapt, and the tax agencies to levy taxes in 
full measure. Urinson said this move can hardly be popular with 
most industrialists and entrepreneurs, who believe that high 
taxes are pernicious to any production. The deputy minister, on 
the contrary, believes that the development of production 
expands the taxable base and heaps up the revenues. 
  Last year, 17 percent of all Russian enterprises ended the 
year in the black, he said. They drained the federal budget, 
inflated its deficit and "froze" restructuring. Much has to be 
done to pull them out from under the budget umbrella and make 
them use their production potential to meet market demand. Some 
of them may end up in bankruptcy, while others, particularly 
those of special economic or public importance, will have to be 
helped out. This applies primarily to the most important coal 
and metallurgical enterprises and fertilizer producers. 
  Restructuring is closely linked to the liquidation of 
monopolies which are hampering the development of market 
relations and deflect state resources. As an example, 
considerable resources allocated to the agroindustrial sector 
never reach farmers but are intercepted by processors of farm 
produce, suppliers of means of production, banks and retailers, 
whose monopoly positions enable them to "redistribute" resources 
in their own favour.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Bay report: "Moscow Has Drafted Program for </F>
Protection of 30 Million Russians in Former Union Republics"] 
  [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry has drawn up an 
extensive program to protect the interests and support more than 
30 million ethnic Russians living outside the Russian Federation. 
  As Teymuraz Ramishvili, chief of the Foreign Ministry's 
International Humanitarian Cooperation and Human Rights 
Administration and an author of the program, told IZVESTIYA, 
this is a program designed for a period of years. 
  The program consists of three sections envisaging political, 
economic, and cultural measures. The section on the creation of 
the institution of dual citizenship stands out in particular. 
This is the main theme at bilateral talks on the rights of 
Russian-speaking minorities in the former republics. 
  The point on the creation of a special radio station, a TV 
channel, and a press organ which would unite the whole Russian 
community abroad is noteworthy. The program envisages help in 
preserving the old and opening new Russian universities, 
institutes, and high schools, and in funding Russian schools and 
theaters. 
  In the event of ethnic conflicts or any acute aggravation of 
the situation in any particular region it is proposed to 
elaborate a mechanism for the emergency evacuation of Russians 
and the provision of assistance to refugees and migrants in 
extreme circumstances. 
  A special role in the protection of Russians will be played 
by Russia's economic ties with the various states of the CIS. 
It is planned to impose rigorous restrictions on the export of 
Russian raw materials and energy sources to countries where the 
rights of ethnic Russians are violated. One point speaks about 
the establishment of a continuous, technically equipped state 
and customs border with those states. 
  In the allocation by Russia of upcoming credits to states of 
the former USSR it will be specially stipulated that a certain 
proportion of the resources in question (20-30 percent) must be 
used for the development of Russian education, language, and 
other needs of the Russian diaspora. 
  Teymuraz Ramishvili acknowledges that the program will work 
only if budget financing is found for it. According to 
preliminary estimates it will cost around 3 trillion rubles. 
Assistance from the private sector is a matter for the future, 
although that sector could be given an interest in the project 
through the generally accepted practice of a tax concession in 
exchange for philanthropic activity. 
  The authors of the plan hope that, despite the enormous 
financial difficulties, the program will be adopted as early as 
the second quarter of this year.

<F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy Boris Fedorov: "The </F>
Government Has Been at a Standstill for Two Months. Which Way 
Will It Go?"] 
  [Text] It is exactly two months since the elections. The 
first results can be summed up. The main one is that for two 
months now the government has been undergoing reorganization, 
rushing about aimlessly, and essentially doing no work. Not a 
single decision that could be described, even if you stretch the 
point, as reformist has been adopted. 
  On the other hand we have had a reorganization which dragged 
out over many weeks and culminated in the departure of three 
people and the demotion of Shokhin and Shakhray. Some members 
of the "new" government have been beating their breasts for 
weeks and loudly trying to persuade everybody, themselves 
included, that they are reformers. Others are saying day in, 
day out that they will not wind up but will deepen and 
expand the reforms. At one moment the goal is to combat 
inflation, at the next it is to repay debts. It is symptomatic 
that Soskovets and Grachev in concert are now criticizing A. 
Zaveryukha. 
  The premier did not think that by "reacting" to the election 
results by making gestures toward the sectorial lobbies he would 
be opening a "Pandora's box" whereby a wave of demands would 
threaten to sweep aside absolutely everything. Many people have 
now gone crazy on hearing talk of "payment of debts." They have 
decided: The time has come, we must extract everything we are 
entitled to and more. Coal industry workers, oil industry 
workers, agrarian workers, and communications workers are 
threatening to strike. Give us mutual offsetting of debts and 
indexation of circulating capital, cheap loans and selective 
support for bankrupts, the country must feed agrarian workers! 
  The government is running scared. On the one 
hand, the reaction to the government changes is 
forcing it to swear loyalty to the former course. On the other, 
its instincts are pushing it in the other direction. The 
debt problem caused by the lack of financial discipline, the 
constant adoption of more and more new expenditure decisions, 
and the lack of the political will to cancel nonpriority 
spending is gradually finding expression in an orgy of 
hysterical demands, and beneath the hail of demands Moscow is 
losing its ability to calculate and is hoping to change things 
by means of partial sops. The agrarian lobby had only to flex 
its muscle and the decision on duties was revoked. They 
are promising everything to everyone, but they are afraid to 
deliver. 
  The delay in making public the guidelines of the 
government's 
economic policy, the frantic conferences and statements -- all 
this is out of place and going on for an intolerably long time. 
The diagnosis is clear: The government has no clear 
line, has lost its bearings, and is aimlessly rushing about. 
  The quarterly session of the enlarged government that has 
been postponed until 24 February will resolve nothing. Clearly, 
they are expecting a speech by the president so as not to make 
fools of themselves. But only the submission of the budget to 
the Duma will dispel the doubts. Unless they make fools of us. 
  The government can save face only if it obtains results that 
are better than those in 1993. Initial reports about the budget 
have not increased optimism: expenditure of around 170 trillion 
rubles [R] and income of R120 trillion. Given that a month ago 
the Finance Ministry was estimating income at R80-90 trillion, 
there is a clear attempt to embellish the picture. It is 
doubtful that the government will be able to approve expenditure 
of R170 trillion unless the measures to revoke expenditure 
decisions that have been proposed for seven months are taken. 
Is there the political will for this? 
  In reality it is a question of a deficit not of R50 
trillion, but of R100 trillion, which will destroy the economy. 
Add to that the so-called united monetary system with Belarus 
and other countries, and financial disaster is inevitable. If 
the figures are "massaged" for the IMF and you and me, the 
result will be more chronic underpayments from the budget. We 
should also fear methods of decreasing the deficit like the sale 
of precious metals and gems by the government to the Central 
Bank without notifying parliament and the channeling of 
so-called Central Bank "profits" into budget needs -- all this 
is sheer emission, the deficit figures go down but inflation 
increases. 
  The new year began with the loss of one-third of the Central 
Bank's currency reserves in order to maintain the ruble exchange 
rate for purely political purposes -- to prove that the 
departure of one or two people does not mean a U-turn. That way 
it won't be long before all the reserves have been wasted and 
then an exchange rate fixed, which is something they are already 
talking about. 
  The government should prove its social orientation by 
setting 
tough targets for economic parameters such as inflation, the 
ruble exchange rate, the population's real income, average wages 
in dollar terms, real retail trade turnover, housing 
construction, and food consumption. These indicators were 
better in 1993 than they were in 1992, and they are the ones 
that determine living standards and social orientation. Is the 
government prepared to give specific pledges and to report back 
in January 1995? It remains only to place your bet. 
  By the beginning of 1994 a situation had emerged where it 
had 
become impossible to move forward with the same "quality" of 
government. It was even impossible to hold on to the position 
that had been achieved -- it was possible only to lose ground. 
Because a reorganization had been launched that substantially 
worsened the "quality," a U-turn was inevitable. The premier 
was scarcely seeking this, but a fundamentally new situation 
emerged. 
  There is no alternative to the policy pursued in 
1993. Having said that, there is a need for greater consistency 
and unity on the part of the government and the whole of the 
executive branch. It is especially sad to hear academicians 
whom the premier's volte-face has roused to produce another opus 
setting out "conceptual approaches" but lacking specific 
prescriptions or any hint of knowledge of the real state of 
affairs. Does this stem more from a sense of being unwanted or 
from honest delusion? 
  What is happening today was probably inevitable. The proud 
"red directors" probably have to have an opportunity to show 
everybody what they are actually capable of. Otherwise the myth 
that there is a real alternative, that there is an alternative 
road to the market whereby you can ignore macroeconomic 
realities and stage pseudocommunist experiments on living 
people, will remain forever. 
  My hope is pinned on the president. I do not believe that B. 
Yeltsin, who began real political and economic reforms after 70 
years of stagnation, can turn back. But I would like to believe 
that the prime minister, who for a year pursued, albeit 
inconsistently, a particular course, also will not venture to 
head for disaster. It is better to think again in time than to 
carry out more experiments on Russia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Svetlana Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] St.Petersburg February 16 TASS -- Since Wednesday 
the yield of the Leningradskaya nuclear power plant near St. 
Petersburg will be reduced by 50 per cent. Three reactors are 
being discharged, but even under such a fuel-saving regime the 
station's fuel reserves may run out in three months. 
  The plant has no money to buy fuel, because power consumers 
do not pay their debts. Moreover, the "Electrostal" works which 
produced nuclear fuel for the plant also halted lines -- as its 
debtors do not pay either. 
  The power plant from now on will be able to supply energy 
only to St. Petersburg and its region, while other consumers 
situated on a vast territory of the north-western part of Russia 
are likely to face energy shortages very soon. 
  It is for the second time this year when the station is on 
the verge of stoppage. Early in January it warned it may shut 
down reactors as it had no money to buy fuel. Two days later it 
received four billion roubles (about three million dollars) out 
of the total 34-billion rouble debt from its clients. 
  The plant's administration, however, warned that the four 
billion roubles would not last for long.

  [Text] Simferopol, 16 Feb -- On 16 February, the KRYMSKAYA 
PRAVDA [Crimean Truth] newspaper published an interview with 
President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov. In particular, he noted that 
confidential meetings with Russian government officials had 
taken place during the Crimean delegation's visit to Moscow. 
According to Meshkov, issues were discussed that are to be 
resolved in the near future: The supply of additional gas to 
the peninsula and the allocation of grain and agricultural 
produce. The Crimean president also stressed that the issue of 
opening an official mission of the Russian government in the 
Republic of Crimea had been examined. Meshkov confirmed that 
Yevgeniy Saburov, the well-known Russian economist, had agreed 
to occupy the post of deputy prime minister of the autonomous 
republic. All of Russia is behind Saburov. All Russian 
Federation officials have approved his decision, stated the 
Crimean president. He also reported that the deputy prime 
minister would be forming the Cabinet of Ministers of the 
autonomy.

  [Text] Ivan Timchenko, the head of the Ukrainian 
president's legal service says Yevgeniy Saburov cannot become 
prime minister of Crimea. He said that Ukrainian law does not 
ban foreign citizens from occupying such a post, but that, as a 
citizen of a foreign state, Saburov cannot have access to 
information that constitutes Ukraine's state secrets and that, 
without this, he cannot really carry out the duties of Crimean 
prime minister, Timchenko said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Republican Party Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Equal 
Opportunities for Everyone"] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Do you think that democratic principles 
will be observed in the upcoming legislative elections? 
  [Horyn] I believe that there are no grounds for grave 
concern, although certain forces will probably want to create an 
atmosphere of uncertainty and tension. In my opinion, the 
situation could be normalized if the executive bodies take 
preventive measures now. 
  [Reporter] Will the electoral law affect the results of the 
elections? 
  [Horyn] The electoral law was meant to limit the influence 
of parties on political life in Ukraine. We hoped that the 
elections would be a great chance for many young parties to 
grow, become stronger, and form the political basis of a 
democratic society, but this has not happened. The majority 
system has in fact put an end to hopes for a multiparty society. 
This has happened, although all of Ukraine's democratic forces 
demanded that a mixed proportional system be introduced. 
  [Reporter] How many candidates will the Republican Party 
field? 
  [Horyn] According to preliminary calculations, we will have 
more than 100. 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion about holding a referendum 
on the main provisions of the draft constitution on election day? 
  [Horyn] This would only complicate the electoral process. I 
would rather propose that this issue be resolved by the new 
legislature. It would be very unwise to vote on the main 
provisions without a preliminary discussion of the draft by 
either the newly elected Supreme Council or the Constitutional 
Assembly. I am against doing this. 
  [Reporter] Could you briefly outline your election platform? 
  [Horyn] Our economic, political, and military programs were 
drafted as early as 1992, because we were the first registered 
democratic organization and the first alternative to the 
Communist Party of Ukraine. We believe that Ukraine should be a 
multiparty parliamentary republic. Private property, coexisting 
with other forms of property, should be the driving force of the 
economy. We want the privatization program to provide equal 
opportunities for all Ukrainian citizens. 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion regarding the tripartite 
declaration signed in Moscow by Presidents Kravchuk, Clinton, 
and Yeltsin? 
  [Horyn] I believe that this is a very important document 
which requires thorough analysis. 
  [Reporter] How can this document affect Ukraine's national 
security? 
  [Horyn] In my opinion, the adoption of the current version 
of the document would deal a heavy blow to Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Aleksandr Belov, "one of the chiefs" </F>
of the Ukrainian Security Service Analysis Center, by 
unidentified UNIAN reporter; place and date not given: "CIA 
Director Demanded That His Functionaries Foresee Events and Not 
Write History"] 
  [Text] At the end of 1991, in compliance with the 
Ukrainian laws "On Security Service" and "On Investigative 
Operations," the analysis and information administration was 
established at the Ukrainian Security Service [SBU], which 
included a research unit called the analysis center. A UNIAN 
correspondent met with one of its chiefs, Colonel Aleksandr 
Belov. Here is what he said. 
  [Belov] Over the past two years, we have sent more than 
3,500 
documents on national security matters to the Ukrainian 
president, Supreme Council chairman, and prime minister. This 
enables the necessary measures to be taken on the legislative 
level and allows people to keep one step ahead of events. 
Instead of writing history, we try to foresee developments. By 
the way, this is what former CIA Director Robert Gates demanded 
from his people. We are now studying two major issues. The 
first is Ukraine and the system of collective security, because 
just like other East European states, our country seeks to enter 
international institutions in order to obtain firm guarantees of 
its security. We are trying to consider all the advantages and 
disadvantages stemming, for example, from entry into NATO or the 
EEC, integration into the Visegrad Group, or the creation of a 
Baltic and Black Sea Union. The second issue is to determine 
the likely centers for international terrorist organizations' 
operations on Ukrainian territory. 
  [Reporter] How often were your prognoses borne out? 
  [Belov] When the armed conflict in the Dniester region was 
in 
its initial stage, the Ukrainian leadership instructed the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, Foreign Ministry, border troops, 
and the SBU to prevent the spread of the conflict onto Ukraine's 
territory. At that time, we were preparing on a daily basis 
information for Leonid Kravchuk, Ivan Plyushch, and Anatoliy 
Zlenko on the situation in the region and the likely directions 
that events might take. Our prediction that the 14th Russian 
Army was likely to turn into an independent political force was 
borne out. 
  [Reporter] Do you have any evidence of any analytical 
operations by foreign special services in the Crimea? 
  [Belov] At present, the Crimea remains a potential crisis 
spot, not only in Ukraine but also in the context of a larger 
geopolitical area. This is why developments in that region are 
closely watched by Turkey, Romania, the United States, Germany, 
and Russia.

  [Text] The armed opposition to Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev is undertaking efforts in order to unite its forces. 
  "Lack of unity has hampered the opposition armed formations 
from taking radical measures to stabilize the situation in the 
republic," a spokesperson from the opposition headquarters told 
Interfax. 
  According to the same sources, after the final unification 
of 
the opposition forces, the regime of President Dzhokhar Dudayev 
will be "more precarious than ever." 
  Interfax asked several supporters of the opposition to 
comment on the proclamation of sovereignty by official Groznyy. 
  "I do not need that kind of independence such as when my 
mother is not paid her pension for two years," Rizvan Gairabekov 
said. 
  "Sovereignty proclaimed by a group of bandits, leads to 
surprising paradoxes: A person who was in prison at the same 
time with me is now a major of the Committee of National 
Security," he remarked. 
  According to Zaindi Khajimuradov, Chechnya is now a "hotbed 
of crime." 
  "Kidnapping of women, murders, vendettas have become wide 
spread and murderers and rapists are still free. We are an 
integral part of Russia. So why did it forget about us? Where 
are we living?" he said. 
  The opposition headquarters showed Interfax a list of 
weapons 
which could be acquired in Groznyy: a Kalashnikov automatic gun 
is sold for 700,000-850,000 rubles, a Makarov gun for $600, a 
short gun for $1000, a 76-millimeter canon without battle scale 
of ammunition will cost 50,000 rubles, a howitzer goes for 30 Mn 
rubles and an APC for 5-6 Mn rubles.

  [Text] Umar Avturkhanov, mayor of the Nadterechny District 
held by forces opposing the Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, 
called for holding elections to the Russian Federal Assembly on 
March 13. 
  He told Interfax that even if the complete sovereignty the 
official Grozny talks about is true, "we must share in the 
operation of the federal authorities. In my view, this would 
not harm our sovereignty." 
  Avturkhanov emphasized, however, that elections would not be 
held in the district if they were not held throughout the rest 
of Chechnya. 
  "I have no intention to separate myself from my people," he 
declared. 
  He said that Chechnya did not have proper sovereignty. 
  "The law of the jungle prevails under which only the 
strongest survive. People do not need this kind of 
sovereignty," he said. 
  In his words, Dudayev is supported only by those in the 
middle class who managed to get rich under his rule. 
  Dzhokhar Dudayev had earlier told Interfax that there would 
be no elections to the Federal Assembly on March 13.

  [Text] At its session in Saransk, the parliament of 
Mordovia has abolished its Constitutional Court. During the 
discussion, it was pointed out that the Russian Constitution 
makes no provision for the existence of constitutional courts in 
the republics. 
  It is interesting that, during the nine months of its 
existence, the Constitutional Court of Mordovia considered only 
three matters, while 44 million rubles of budget funds were 
spent on maintaining the court.

<F P=106> [By correspondents Sergey Goryachev, Aliya Nugmanova, and </F>
Vladimir Gerasev from Washington, including recorded remarks by 
President Nazarbayev; from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev has 
ended the official part of his U.S. visit. Our correspondents 
report on the details from Washington. 
  [Goryachev] [Video shows Nazarabayev walking with Clinton at 
press conference] President Clinton assessed relations with 
Kazakhstan as a long-term partnership of strategic importance. 
From now on Kazakhstan -- which is the ninth largest country in 
the world, and with its resources and its position at the 
meeting point of Europe and Asia -- will become an important 
player in the sphere of U.S. foreign policy, and not only 
policy. [video shows oil drilling] 
  [Nugmanova] Presidents Nazarbayev and Clinton reached 
agreement on setting up in Almaty the headquarters of the 
Central Asian Business Fund, for the activities of which the 
United States is allocating $30 million. The amount will be 
increased as specific projects are implemented. This is 
advantageous to us. 
  [Gerasev] What is advantageous for the United States is 
Kazakhstan's movement toward a market economy, which is 
considered here as being successful. But the main thing is the 
republic's nuclear disarmament. The official document on 
Kazakhstan's accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
is a success for Clinton. A success for Nazarbayev is major 
U.S. financial aid which, it was stated, will be trebled and 
will exceed $300 million. 
  The talks in Washington were bilateral, but Russia and its 
relations with Kazakhstan was an invisible participant in the 
talks. 
  [Nazarbayev] [Video shows Nazarbayev speaking to camera] 
Another question which I put to the leadership of Russia was of 
concluding a treaty on military cooperation between Russia and 
Kazakhstan, whereby we would in effect become military-political 
allies. Then it would have been possible to say to America that 
it is our business where our armed forces and our missiles are 
located in the interests of the security of the two states. 
However, the Russian side did not agree to that. That is where 
the whole question lies. 
  [Goryachev] Kazakhstan, Russia, and the other countries of 
the former USSR are increasingly acting individually in their 
relations with the United States. But perhaps understanding of 
the fact that there is strength in numbers is not too far away.

General Butrus Butrus-Ghali met here on Wednesday with Kazakh 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  During the meeting, Nazarbayev moved an initiative to 
convene 
a special session of the U.N. General Assembly on the 
post-confrontation period. The participants in the meeting also 
discussed the Kazakh initiative for creating a collective 
security system in Asia by concluding a treaty on coordination 
and trust-building measures on the continent. This initiative 
was put forward by the Kazakh president at the 47th session of 
the U.N. General Assembly in 1992. 
  The U.N. secretary general praised the initiatives moved by 
the Kazakh president. 
  Butrus-Ghali and Nazarbayev also discussed the current 
situation in Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Russia and the entire 
world. 
  After the meeting, the Kazakh president put his signature to 
the convention on child's rights. Kazakhstan became the 156th 
nation to join to this convention. 
  In conclusion of his staying at the U.N. headquarters, 
Nazarbayev met administrator of the United Nations Development

  [Text] United Nations Organisation February 17 TASS-- 
Kazakhstan's main ambition is to become one of the largest oil 
exporters, and its main problem is to ensure for itself an 
access to southern seas for exporting Kazakh oil, Kazakh 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev said, addressing a press 
conference at the U.N. headquarters on Wednesday, and called on 
foreign investors to help. 
  "I think that if we manage to attract investments in the 
necessary amounts, Kazakhstan may become a major exporter of 
crude oil, because our domestic demand is only 20 million tonnes 
and our oil output has already reached 27 million tonnes," 
Nazarbayev said. 
  "Now we should look for ways of ensuring oil transportation. 
There is no alternative so far to the laying of an oil pipeline 
to Novorossiisk across the Russian territory. Its capacity will 
be from 15 to 17 million tonnes, which will meet our demands for 
some 80 years to come. However, since we are planning to 
produce 100 to 120 million tonnes early in the coming century, 
we shall need alternative routes for oil export. This is a very 
important question for us," he continued. 
  "The former Soviet Union connected all its republics with 
Europe through Russia, and now this is the only (possible) way 
(of transportation). This is why we intend to establish railway 
communication with China and, through China, with the Pacific 
coast. We are examining plans of laying pipelines to the south, 
i.e. to the Persian Gulf, to Turkey and the Mediterranean via 
Iran and to the Mediterranean via the Caspian Sea and the 
Caucasus." The Kazakh president said. [punctuation as received] 
  The president described the signing of a major contract with 
the U.S. Chevron company last April as an important event. The 
contract deals with the oil field, which, according to 
Nazarbayev, is equal to the Alaska oil field. 
  He said that, aside from Chevron, a consortium will operate 
in Kazakhstan, specifically, in the West-Kazakh part of the oil 
and gas bearing area which, according to estimates, contains 25 
billion tonnes of hydrocarbons, suitable for extraction. 
  "Kazakhstan is fully self-sufficient in energy resources and 
is even exporting them. It is also self-sufficient in food and 
is exporting it. So, our problem is to gain access to southern 
seas and find ways to the world market as soon as possible", 
Nazarbayev stressed.

  [Text] New York February 17 TASS -- Wednesday [16 February] 
was a busy day for Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is 
now in the United States on an official visit. In the morning 
he had several meetings at the U.N. headquarters, including with 
U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, then he held a press 
conference for journalists accredited at the U.N. 
  Nazarbayev's speech at Columbia University, in which he set 
forth Kazakhstan's stand on problems of the world order, 
development and democracy, became the feature event of the day. 
He stressed that Kazakhstan, like any other young state, seeks 
to protect its sovereignty, independence and territorial 
integrity, to create conditions for the formation of a 
market-based economy, the strengthening of democratic 
institutions and the maintenance of harmonious inter-ethnic 
relations, and to ensure national security. 
  Speaking about Kazakhstan's foreign policy, Nazarbayev 
pointed out that its priority goal is the creation of a zone of 
confidence and good neighbourly relations along the whole 
parameter of its borders. "I have always been and continue to be 
an advocate of historically formed relations of friendship, 
cooperation and mutual understanding on the whole territory of 
the former USSR republics and I have consistently supported the 
idea of economic integration of the CIS member states," 
Nazarbayev said. 
  So far as Kazakh-American relations are concerned, their 
essence is reflected in the charter on democratic partnership, 
signed in Washington, the Kazakh president continued. He said 
the Clinton administration was actively encouraging large-scale 
American private investments in the Kazakh economy. 
  The U.S. Asian society gave a reception for the Kazakh 
president on Wednesday night. 
  Today Nazarbayev flies home to Almaty via Paris, where he is 
planning to meet French President Francois Mitterrand.

by the authoritative international organizations "Foundation 
Global for Community" and "International Alert" in arranging a 
meeting of Armenian and Azerbaijani experts, which was scheduled 
to be held in Oslo later this month. The meeting was to 
concentrate on possible ways of settling the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict. 
  Armenia accounted for its refusal by the fact that 
Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenian community was barred from 
negotiations, while Armenia thinks it necessary to grant this 
community the status of a party in the conflict, Azerbaijan's 
Foreign Ministry reported tonight.

  [Text] Baku, February 16 (AZERTAC)--Georgia and Azerbaijan 
have similar opinion on international and regional problems, 
prospects of bilateral cooperation, Aleksandr Chikvaidze, 
Georgian foreign minister stated yesterday. Mr. Chikvaidze 
arrived to Baku with a short-term visit on his route to Tehran. 
  Mr. Chikvaidze said that his meetings with President Aliyev 
and Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Gasan Gasanov were aimed to 
ascertain each others approaches to some issues. Such contacts 
are necessary, he said, because both the countries would like to 
appear with common position at various international forums. 
  According to the foreign minister of Georgia, issues 
concerning international conflicts in the region were discussed 
in the first place at his Baku meetings. We did not discuss 
measures that should be taken to stop conflicts, but pointed out 
that it was necessary to take efforts on resolution of the 
conflicts over Karabakh and Abkhazia, Aleksandr Chikvaidze 
stated. He appreciated the idea, of arranging a tripartite 
Transcaucasian summit, which was supported by Azerbaijan party. 
It is expected that the Russian party would be invited to take 
part in the summit. Now, he said, we should take measures to 
realize this idea and make concrete proposals. 
  Aleksandr Chikvaidze also informed that the parties agreed 
to 
open a Georgian embassy in Baku and an Azerbaijani one in 
Tbilisi. 
  The Georgian diplomat tendered an invitation of Eduard 
Shevardnadze to Geydar Aliyev to visit Georgia whenever it would 
be convenient.

  [Text] Azerbaijan wants numerous provisions of the CIS 
Collective Security Treaty revised and updated, especially those 
covering threats to security of its signatories from within, as 
well as outside, the CIS. Azeri President Geydar Aliyev and 
Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov made this known when they met 
with Aleksandre Chikvaidze, Georgian Foreign Minister, who had a 
stopover in Baku on his way to Iran. 
  Internal conflicts, the Azeri leaders think, are likely to 
make the CIS an unviable organizations. 
  Informed sources in the Azeri leader's headquarters told 
Interfax that economic cooperation between Georgia and 
Azerbaijan and the situation of Azeris in Georgia as well as 
cooperation between the two countries in the CIS framework had 
been discussed. An agreement was reached on opening a Georgian 
embassy in Baku and an Azeri embassy in Tbilisi.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Sovindzh Abdullayev and </F>
Viktor Shulman: "Azerbaijan: Oil Trump Card"] 
  [Text] Baku -- Representatives from a number of the 
world's oil companies who have secured a firm base in Baku 
heaved a sigh of relief this week. An oil contract is to be 
signed as soon as possible! -- this was the gist of the remarks 
made by Geydar Aliyev when he assembled the entire leadership of 
the State Oil Company a few days ago. The document signed here 
has given the go-ahead to all of the State Oil Company's 
proposals regarding the basic areas covered by talks with the 
BP-Statoil consortium, the U.S. companies Amoco, Unocal, 
Pennsoil, Remco, and MacDermott, and the Turkish company Tekis 
Petroleum. The Azerbaijani company has been empowered to 
prepare and conclude a contract with them. 
  Recently the fate of this contract has hung by a thread on a 
number of occasions. Following the change of government last 
June the Azerbaijani Government suspended the signing of this 
document, which caused confusion among the Western partners. 
But Geydar Aliyev explained away this step very simply: 
Azerbaijan is not rejecting the plan to develop the oil fields 
jointly, it merely wants everything to be done in a civilized 
manner with due account taken of national interests. 
  This may well have been an unpopular step. In a difficult 
situation when there was political infighting in the republic, 
and when it was suffering one military reversal after another at 
the front, this course of action paid no dividends to Geydar 
Aliyev, who had only just come to power. Articles started to 
appear in the world press, even in Turkey, that were sharply 
critical of Azerbaijan's position on the oil question. 
According to opposition forecasts, the republic ran the risk of 
advertising itself as an unreliable partner. But the new 
leadership stood firm and insisted on the need for a second 
expert analysis of the terms of this contract which was causing 
so much fuss. 
  During its work, the independent expert commission reviewed 
the percentage share of the anticipated profit in Azerbaijan's 
favor. The experts announced that they had managed to win back 
several tens of billions of dollars from the foreign partners. 
Admittedly, this did not happen without a great deal of huffing 
and puffing: The leader of the expert group was accused by a 
number of publications of extorting money from the Western 
firms, but the affair did not receive wide coverage, the talks 
continued, and all the indications are that they reached a 
successful conclusion. 
  A number of analysts are linking this surprising turn of 
events and the hasty conclusion of a contract with Geydar 
Aliyev's current visit to Turkey and his upcoming visit to 
Britain. Both these states are keen to develop Azerbaijani oil. 
Because, however economically interesting this contract proves 
to be for the republic, it is at the same time a powerful 
political trump card in Azerbaijan's hand which could 
potentially play a major role in establishing very close 
contacts with influential Western countries. Azerbaijan can 
thus provide itself with strong protectors and, most important 
of all, guarantors of the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS--The Russian State Duma 
voted down a proposal of the Liberal Democratic Party [of 
Russia, LDPR] of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to declare an amnesty to 
organisers of the 1991 abortive Soviet coup, of the October 1993 
opposition armed revolt in Moscow and of the bloodshed caused by 
hard-line opposition during May Day demonstration last year. 
  Member of the LDP Viktor Vishnyakov told lawmakers that the 
1991 coup organisers are being tried "for nothing" as, according 
to him "they protected the Constitution" and their only fault 
was the abuse of office. The 1991 coup plotters include several 
former Soviet top officials, two of who were elected to the new 
parliament. 
  Vishnyakov said that it is hard to legally assess the May 1 
developments and added that the clash between police and 
hard-line demonstrators was "a provocation from police". 
  The main organisers of the bloodshed, according to 
investigators, are die hard opposition members Viktor Anpilov 
and Ilya Konstantinov, both of who were arrested after the 
October armed revolt in Moscow. 
  Dwelling on the October events, Vishnyakov said he would not 
like to "lose time in order to provide a legal assessment" of 
the developments. He proposed to first declare an amnesty to 
the organisers and then probe the reasons of the standoff which 
ended when tanks sent by President Boris Yeltsin pounded the 
headquarters of the opposition. 
  The main culprits of the October events are former 
Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, former parliament speaker 
Ruslan Khasbulatov and former Security Minister Viktor 
Barannikov. 
  Although the Duma voted down the proposal of the LDP, it was 
forwarded, together with other versions of the amnesty, to the 
parliamentary committees on legislation and legal reform and on 
security and defence for improval. [sentence as heard]

  [Text] The State Duma, the lower house of the Russian 
parliament, has set up a commission to investigate the events of 
September 21-October 4, 1993. 
  The commission's 11 members represent all parliamentary 
groups. It includes Yuriy Vlasov from the Russian Path group and 
Stanislav Govorukhin from the Democratic Party group. 
  Meanwhile, the Liberal Democratic Party group drafted a 
resolution entitled "The Political and Economic Amnesty in 
Connection with the Adoption of the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation," which would quash the prosecution of all those 
involved in the attempted coup of August 1991, the Moscow riots 
of May 1, 1993, and the conservative revolt of October 3-4, 
1993. The draft will be put before the State Duma on Thursday. 
  The house took no decision on Wednesday on an amnesty 
resolution proposed by President Boris Yeltsin.

  [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- The state should control 
at least two television and radio broadcasting companies -- 
Ostankino and Russian, according to Mikhail Poltoranin, the 
former federal information centre chief, who spoke in the State 
Duma today. He said the country's mass media are on the decline 
and Russia is facing the possible loss of its national 
television, because "it costs three trillion roubles a year, and 
the Finance Ministry wants to drop it from the budget". 
  Poltoranin, who is now heading the House Committee on 
Information Policy and Communications, said a law on television 
is being drafted, and hearings about the economic situation of 
the mass media will be held in the parliament at the end of 
February. 
  Poltoranin said parliamentary correspondents are deprived of 
any possibility to cover the activity of the State Duma because 
the Duma Council, factions, groups and committees have developed 
a practice of meeting behind closed doors. Journalists are 
therefore unable to get any first-hand information. 
  The Duma decided to consider a draft federal law "on the 
coverage of the activity of the bodies of state authority of the 
Russian Federation by the mass media" before March 21, 1994.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Air Time" rubric: </F>
"Deputies Want Their TV Again. Mikhail Poltoranin Is Ready To 
Give Them Other Channels' Programs"] 
  [Text] The State Duma has also taken to heart "the 
questions of objective coverage" that used to concern the 
Supreme Soviet. The Committee for Information Policy and 
Communications under Mikhail Poltoranin has drawn up a draft 
State Duma decree designed to resolve the problem of television 
coverage of the State Duma's activity. In order to persuade the 
deputies to approve the decree, Mr. Poltoranin has promised them 
that a corresponding law will be enacted by 21 March. In 
addition, the deputies have been offered as a present one-third 
of the entire capacity of the "RTV-Parliament" complex left from 
the Supreme Soviet. The government and the Federation Council 
will also take over one-third each. 
  These abstract projects do not suit the deputies, however, 
who want to make their own television program. Mr. Poltoranin's 
committee has suggested that before the law is enacted they use 
a "provisional broadcasting schedule." The schedule, Mikhail 
Poltoranin said, which has already been approved by chiefs of 
the "Russia" and "Ostankino" channels, will give the deputies a 
good half of political programs. Aside from reports on the 
State Duma's deliberations on the "Russia" channel every Friday 
and daily reports in the "Vesti" and "Novosti" programs, it is 
planned to oblige other programs, such as "How We Are Going To 
Live," "Sirs-Comrades," "A Dialogue Live," and "The Peasants' 
Question," to give the floor to deputies, and also to have 
programs such as "Details," "Man and the Law," and so forth, 
feature "burning reports." 
  It is possible that the deputies will accept so "generous" a 
present from Mr. Poltoranin today. The chairman of the 
Committee for Information Policy and Communications, however, 
has not offered them anything new. It should be noted that even 
the fact that the television programs are state-owned does not 
entitle the State Duma to interfere in their authors' activity. 
This does not seem to be of great concern to Deputy Mikhail 
Poltoranin, who is trying to push a pig in a poke on his 
colleagues. 
  State Duma members themselves, as they urge "objective 
coverage," to all appearances will accept air time in other 
people's programs without any guarantees, meanwhile drafting a 
law on how their own activity should be covered. This process 
may drag on and on, so television viewers are for the time being 
insured against a torrent of State Duma broadcasts.

  [Text] Russia's political future was discussed today at a 
meeting of the State Duma. Some of the fundamental questions 
which were raised again revealed a rather sharp divergence of 
views. 
  [Sergey Suntsov] It was only yesterday that the treaty was 
signed with Tatarstan on delimiting the powers of the center but 
today deputy Sergey Baburin introduced a proposal -- true, it 
was not passed -- to examine it at a session of the Duma since 
he saw in the treaty a threat to the territorial integrity of 
Russia. 
  [Begin Baburin recording] As a lawyer I cannot understand 
how 
necessary and justified it is to sign a treaty between a state 
as a whole and a part of that state. [end recording] 
  [Suntsov] Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, 
expressed the opinion, although cautiously -- for no one has yet 
read the treaty -- that he suspects a departure from federation 
toward confederation. Sergey Shakhray noted in this connection: 
  [Begin Shakhray recording] The new Constitution of the 
Russian Federation and the Federation Treaty created the legal 
and methodological opportunity for the treaty. [end recording] 
  [Suntsov] Shakhray stressed that the treaty puts an end to a 
dangerous intrastate conflict. It was the result of three years 
of talks and was backed up by 11 intergovernmental agreements 
and also by a mechanism for implementing it which take account 
of the specific features of the region. It seems that the 
treaty with Tatarstan will become a subject of discussion at 
parliamentary hearings. 
  The draft decision on the coverage of the Duma's activities 
in the mass media caused a storm of activity. The essence of 
Mikhail Poltoranin's speech was that the Duma cannot impose its 
programs on independent publications. The essence of the 
majority of the speeches came down to one thing: The mass media 
are carrying out a political instruction and have gone out of 
control. It was proposed that journalists should be ordered 
whom to interview and what to show. A representative of the 
Communist Party, for example, who sensibly assessed this as an 
impermissible attempt at applying pressure, ended with a doleful 
proposal: simply to remove the accreditation of the journalists 
of those publications which incorrectly cover the work of the 
Duma. It was decided by 21 March to prepare a law on coverage 
of the activity of state organs of power in the state-owned mass 
media. 
  The draft presidential decision on an amnesty in connection 
with the adoption of the new Constitution did not receive 
support from the deputies. As Aleksandr Yakovlev, the 
president's representative, noted, the amnesty would cover no 
more than 20,000 prisoners who were of no danger to society. 
Many speakers demanded that the amnesty for criminal cases 
should be linked with a political amnesty for the participants 
in the October events. Here is the opinion of Sergey Shakhray: 
  [Begin Shakhray recording] There are no political prisoners 
in Russia. In Russia there is a situation in which individual 
political leaders are accused of having committed criminal 
offenses. [end recording] 
  [Suntsov] He did not rule out that an amnesty was possible 
if 
a civil truce was concluded in the country without appeals for 
violence, taking acount of the crisis situation. Work on the 
question will be continued in the Duma's committees.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tokareva report: "Where Is Politics Here, and Where </F>
Economics?"] 
  [Text] A week ago, when the anticrisis program submitted 
by the pillars of the socialist economy under the leadership of 
Academician Shatalin was widely publicized, Sergey Glazyev 
modestly reported at a news conference in the State Duma that 
the academicians' program for overcoming the crisis and for 
economic policy, to put it mildly, was not the only one. 
  The academicians' program, which, for want of any better 
ones, was printed in many periodicals, has proved to be one of 
many. The theses of four more reports aspiring to the role of 
programs and also the data of statistical reports characterizing 
the state of the economy were made public yesterday in 
parliamentary hearings in the State Duma. 
  According to a report by the chairman of the Russian 
Federation State Committee for Statistics, over the past year 
retail prices increased 900 percent, and wholesale prices 840 
percent. The federal budget deficit stood at 17 trillion rubles 
[R]. Profits amounted to R40 trillion. Some 17 percent of 
enterprises worked at a loss over the year. Mutual nonpayments 
amounted to R17 trillion. Industrial production fell 15 percent 
compared with the previous year. In the military-industrial 
complex it fell 29 percent. Capital investments fell 15 
percent. Of 652 capital construction projects, just 193 were 
commissioned. Grain production fell 7 percent compared with 
1992. 
  How do economists in opposing camps rate these results, and 
what prescriptions for the future do they propose? 
  Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of economics, who 
submitted an extensive report for the parliamentary hearings to 
Sergey Glazyev, who chaired those hearings, declared that the 
results of the economic year are contradictory. "Inflation has 
fallen, and the population's monetary incomes have increased. 
Enterprises are coming to a halt, and yet unprofitable 
enterprises are continuing to work, devouring resources. Some 
R12 trillion has gone on expenditure which was not provided for, 
and this when the state has a debt of R4 trillion to the 
military-industrial complex and the agrarian complex." 
  Ya. Urinson proposed a prescription for curing the crisis in 
the economy along the lines of the economic policy of Gaydar and 
Fedorov: not to change the tax policy for two years; to abolish 
tax breaks; to toughen up control over the expenditure part of 
the budget; to monitor the effectiveness of subsidies, capital 
investments, and subventions. To continue privatization, which, 
after completing the voucher stage, is to enter the stage of 
forming the "efficient private owner." To pursue a selective 
policy, reducing the number of priorities. Targeted support is 
needed for enterprises and particularly important sectors. 
  This is the forecast result: a budget deficit of 5 percent, 
a lowering of inflation to 2-3 percent, and an increase in 
unemployment from 3.8 to 7 million. 
  Deputies were not delighted with the plans of the leader of 
the Ministry of Economics. The discussion between them and 
Urinson was conducted in various languages. The deputies mostly 
used rally language, while Urinson employed economic concepts. 
  Boris Fedorov, now a member of the Committee for the Budget, 
Taxes, Banks, and Finances, delivered a brief speech which once 
again dotted the "i's" in the submitted summary of the program. 
In his speech Fedorov chiefly carried on polemics with 
Academician Shatalin and other admirers of "reforms with a human 
face." Briefly, concisely, and wittily, as always, Fedorov 
remarked that economic prosperity cannot be achieved just by 
printing money. He drew attention to the fact that we are 
already living in a market economy whether we want this or not 
and whether we call this market a bazaar or are moved by it. 
All the measures that were needed to create the market have 
already been taken, the former minister of finance said. Now it 
is only necessary to remove the inflationary tax. Fedorov 
remarked that there is no longer any need at all to write any 
programs. The government must adopt decisions every day in 
accordance with the principles of market economics. And, above 
all, the principles of financial discipline. 
  Sergey Glazyev, who submitted to the hearings a serious 
report which certainly does not categorize his economic views as 
socialist, emphasized that the main principles of future 
economic conduct are the reduction of preferential credits 
granted out of the state budget for purposes of funding the 
national economy and a ban on their use to fund trade 
operations. Particularly to acquire imported goods. The theme 
of protecting the Russian economy against the pernicious 
influence of competition with the Western economy loomed large 
in Glazyev's report. 
  Glazyev believes that the monetarists have achieved only an 
outward similarity with a market economy. That in the course of 
the reforms they failed to form a sensible structural policy. 
As a result of the policy of radical liberalization a 
spontaneous structural restructuring is taking place, consisting 
in the destruction of processing industry sectors and in the 
preferential development of raw material sectors. Thus, the 
potential of future growth is lost, and the economy goes over to 
depressed functioning as a raw materials periphery. Glazyev 
believes that it is necessary to encourage exports of 
commodities with a high proportion of VAT, not raw material 
goods. 
  Yevgeniy Saburov, who held the post of vice premier in Ivan 
Silayev's government, called the report by the academicians 
under Shatalin's leadership "good but not technical" in that it 
urges people to live well but does not say "how." He called 
Fedorov's report "technical" but said it does not inspire 
confidence that the prescription will lead to anything good. 
  In the conference lobby Yevgeniy Saburov explained his 
viewpoint: Only changes in the financial sphere are being made 
quickly and easily. But in the sphere of changing production 
and of new technologies there are no quick results. As a result 
of getting carried away with measures merely of a financial 
nature, we will get mass unemployment in addition to inflation. 
But even Saburov said words to the effect that a moderately 
tough credit policy is necessary. At the same time he 
pronounced some words which at first did not take appropriate 
shape in economic terms -- "accord with the people." But soon 
he got away from populist terminology and said that he had in 
mind cartel agreements among industrialists. 
  Lvov, corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences, had 
the biggest success with deputies. This was evidently because 
he put things in a manner comprehensible even to those deputies 
who have not mastered the subtleties of unadapted economic 
slang. But most likely it was because he pronounced out loud an 
intimate secret: The country will be ruined by disregard for the 
high-tech military-industrial complex and by enthusiasm for the 
fuel and energy complex. In our country the sectors of the 
latter produce 30 percent of the profit, and machine building 
just 1 percent. 
  Lvov called VAT a powerful factor for whipping up inflation. 
He proposed making rent the basis of a new system of taxation, 
as it does not have to be taken any further along the whole 
manufacturing chain but is levied just once, as well as a tax on 
pollution of the natural environment. 
  So there is diversity among the programs. There is even a 
certain similarity among them, at least on one question: a 
moderately tough credit policy. At the recent congress of the 
Association of Russian Peasant and Private Farms I also heard 
from peasants that more than half the credits are embezzled by 
banks and by commercial structures associated with them. 
  Understanding of this question, at least, is growing in 
society. But there are few prescriptions for treating the 
crisis of nonpayments, unemployment, and hopelessness for 
high-technology Russian industry. This is why the document 
entitled "Recommendations of Parliamentary Hearings on the 
Economic Situation in the Country" mainly contained bitter words 
about the present state of the economy. It recommends that the 
government adopt an anticrisis program within three weeks 
clearly indicating the substance of the measures, the deadlines 
for fulfillment, and the expected results. The State Duma is 
recommended to include draft laws in the plan of priority 
legislative work according to application. 
  Still to come is a "roundtable" with the participation of 
members of the Federal Assembly, the government, political 
parties, and public movements for the purpose of reaching public 
accord on the main areas of socioeconomic policy. 
  It is sad that no more than 25 deputies were left in the 
hall 
by the end of the session. To all appearances, the economy is 
of far less concern to them than purely political altercations. 
Deputy Fedorov left the hall as soon as it had heard his own 
speech. So Mr. Lvov spoke without his most important opponent 
being present.

  [Text] Sukhumi February 16 TASS -- A military grouping of 
Georgian troops is being intensively concentrated in the Zugdidi 
district of Georgia, the press service of the Abkhazian Defence 
Ministry reported today. 
  According to information from the Defence Ministry of 
Abkhazia, "over 2,000 soldiers and officers, more than 40 
armored cars, a large quantity of artillery guns and mortars 
have been concentrated there. Living force and materiel are 
being brought to the state border." 
  The augmentation of living force and materiel is also going 
on in the Kodor canyon. Similar military preparations by the 
Georgian side is a clear proof that Georgia did not give up the 
idea of resolving the problem of relations with the Republic of 
Abkhazia in a military way, a statement of the Abkhazian Defence 
Ministry said.

  [Text] In a talk with a CONTACT correspondent today, 
Vakhtang Kolbaia, head of the Gali Rayon administration and 
member of the Georgian parliament, said that the exodus of 
refugees from the territory occupied by Abkhazian separatists 
will not stop until the entire population of the rayon has left 
the disaster zone. 
  According to preliminary information, between 8 and 12,000 
inhabitants remain. They are in an extremely difficult 
situation, hiding in tea plantations in the daytime and 
gathering in groups of 10 to 15 people at night in order to flee 
via mountainous paths to safety. 
  Mr. Kolbaia called for the immediate arrival in Gali Rayon 
of 
international experts and observers to establish supervision in 
the Gali zone. In order to save the remaining population, it is 
necessary to set up a life corridor through which people could 
be evacuated. 
  The Abkhazian separatists and their hirelings are taking 
people prisoner, especially young people of Georgian 
nationality, whom they drive to Tkvarcheli and Ochamchire. The 
criminals commit their atrocities with such ingenuity that no 
traces are left. They bring both those who are alive and dead 
together into houses and set them on fire, turning residential 
quarters into ashes. Every day there are executions and acts of 
violence. Innocent people are being burned to death.

Nikolayev, saying that the incident at the first border post was 
a provocation against "border guards courageously fulfilling 
their duty and enjoying respect of the entire Abkhazian people". 
Nobody was injured during the attack.

  [Text] Tiraspol February 16 TASS -- Russian Deputy Defence 
Minister Georgiy Kondratyev arrived in the independence-seeking 
Dniester region of Moldova on Wednesday to inspect the 14th 
Russian Army which is acting as a peace-keeping force there. 
  "I am responsible for the peace-keeping forces of Russia and 
I have come here to see how they live and what problems they 
have to solve," Kondratyev said. 
  He said he will meet with the army commanders and Dniester 
authorities to discuss the future of Russian peace-keepers in 
the region. "They cannot stay here forever," he added. 
  He told ITAR-TASS that this is a routine inspection, but 
surely he would speak with army commander Aleksandr Lebed about 
his recent public statements. 
  The army commanders had warned all sides against "the 
illusion that the (Moldovan-Dniester) conflict can be solved by 
force." They said though that the Army would not stand on the 
sidelines if new hostilities erupt and promised that "the 
organisers of armed provocations from either bank (of the 
Dniestr River) will get severe punishment for any attempt to 
unleash a new conflict." 
  The Foreign Ministry of Moldova then accused the command of 
the 14th Army of "interference into the affairs of the republic" 
and said in a statement issued on Friday the Russian Army was 
"the main destabilising factor in the Dniester region." 
  The Foreign Ministry said that such statements "undermine 
bilateral negotiations on the future of the 14th Army" and 
reiterated that the Moldovan leadership "insists on an 
unconditional pullout of the Army." 
  Kondartyev told ITAR-TASS that the fate of the 14th Army is 
to be solved by politicians, not by the military and added that 
"we may withdraw it already tomorrow." 
  During the three-day visit, Kondratyev will tour the bases 
of 
Russian peace-keeping forces numbering 1,700 in the region and 
meet with Dniester President Igor Smirnov. He may also hold 
talks with representatives of the Moldovan Defence Ministry.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Report by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] The eighth round of the Moldovan-Russian talks on 
the status and the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army scheduled 
for February 16-17 has been postponed for an indefinite period, 
Interfax was told by the Moldovan Ambassador, chief Moldovan 
negotiator Anatol Taranu. 
  He gave no comment to the talks rescheduling. 
  He said that the invitation to the Russian side was sent on 
time. Russia insists on further work by expert teams because it 
believes the plenary meeting was not prepared completely. 
  Taranu believes the Russian delegation to be using this 
pretext so as to wait for the results of the parliamentary 
elections in Moldova and change the position concerning the 
Russian army in line with the results. 
  Local observers believe Moscow expects pro-Russian parties 
to 
come to power in Moldova. Such a result would strengthen 
Russia's negotiating position. 
  Taranu said that if Moldova's principled position concerning 
the schedule for the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army is 
changed, he will refuse to head the Moldovan delegation at the 
talks. 
  Moldova insists on the complete withdrawal of the 14th 
Russian Army before July 1, 1994. The Russian delegation 
believes in the mean time, that the army withdrawal should be 
conditioned by the adoption of a special status for the 
Transdniestrian region.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Mircea Dascaliuc report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] Today the president of the Republic of Moldova 
Mircea Snegur granted an interview to the correspondent of the 
German Radio Station Deutsche Welle, the Press Bureau of the 
Presidency announced. 
  A number of questions referred to the early parliamentary 
elections due on 27 February 1994. President Mircea Snegur 
stated that all necessary conditions have been created to ensure 
an appropriate electoral process in a democratic way. Regarding 
the citizens in the eastern rayons of the Republic of Moldova, 
he has prepared a decree according to which those citizens will 
be able to cast their votes one week earlier because the 
Tiraspol authorities do not want to set up electoral stations in 
the area they controlled. This decree was required by the 
president's duty to respect the claims of the population in that 
area, claims that have been expressed at recent meetings, Mircea 
Snegur also stated. 
  Referring to the issue of the 14th Army, which is deployed 
on 
the territory of the Republic of Moldova, President Snegur 
affirmed that this will be withdrawn unconditionally, which 
means that the Russian side will not ask for a special legal 
statute for Dniester as the price for the withdrawal. 
  President Mircea Snegur also referred to the Ilascu group in 
connection with this issue and said that the current 
constitution of the Republic of Moldova prefers to act more and 
talk less, currently making everything possible for the transfer 
of the group to Chisinau. 
  According to the report of the Presidency's Press, when 
asked 
for his views regarding the responses to the speech he made [on 
5 February] at the congress Our Home the Republic of Moldova, 
Snegur said, quote, the speech focused on concrete realities and 
on the current situation, unquote. Noting that he does not 
withdraw the remarks he made, President Snegur added that none 
of his critics remarked that the speech was deliberately based 
on the idea of maintaining the national and blood ties. 
  In concluding the Deutsche Welle interview, President Snegur 
said that the Republic of Moldova will join the formula proposed 
by the North Atlantic Alliance, that is, the Partnership for 
Peace, but, at the same time, it will not stop militating for 
the achievement of neutral status.

<F P=106> [Svetlana Gamova article: "The Suffering of the Young </F>
`Occupiers' on the Bridge across the Dniester"] 
  [Text] Chisinau -- The security zone defined by the treaty 
signed by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Mircea Snegur in July 
1992 extends 5 km from the right bank and 5 km from the left 
bank of the Dniester. 
  For 18 months the zone has been under the control of the 
Joint Peacemaking Forces: On the one side those of Moldova and 
Russia, on the opposite side those of Russia and the Dniester 
region. The left-bank security zone, once the scene of combat 
operations, is a zone of alienation. A "quiet" war for 
influence over the villages along the river is being waged there 
between Chisinau and Tiraspol. Some villages have -- by 
decision of their local assemblies -- placed themselves under 
the Dniester region's protectorate, while some have raised the 
state flag of Moldova. 
  The quietness in the neutral zone could be shattered: 
Unresolved political problems are building up unhealthy 
tension. According to local inhabitants, today's situation is 
reminiscent of March 1992 -- the start of the armed conflict in 
the eastern regions of Moldova. 
  Between Dubossary and Kochiery, whose streets run into each 
other, there is a traffic control barrier. In front of the 
barrier, where Russian soldiers warm themselves by a simple 
fire, is the Dniester region; beyond lies the territory of 
Moldova. Here plutoniers (the rank in the Moldovan police 
corresponding to sergeant) stamp their feet on the frost -- an 
unusual occurrence in the south. While not established by any 
laws or envisaged by the United Nations, the border is 
nevertheless marked out. 
  Vehicles are searched "for weapons" at the barrier. For the 
inhabitants, particularly the children who hurry from Dubossary 
to the Moldavian school in Kochiery and, the other way around, 
from Kochiery to Dubossary, the barrier is opened. The ban 
applies only to police, who are not allowed to show themselves 
in the city in uniform. But, according to the guard post 
sergeants, it is dangerous to travel to Dubossary even without 
their uniforms -- if they are recognized, they are beaten up. 
  The Moldovan guard post appeared alongside the peacemaking 
post recently, after the declaration of the special situation in 
the Dniester region and in response to the militia guard post. 
Both sides fear acts of provocation during the Moldovan 
parliamentary elections, which will be held in Kochiery but 
forbidden in Dubossary. 
  However, conflict could break out for reasons that have 
nothing do with politics. By decision of the Dniester region 
authorities 800 hectares of land in the use of Kochiery's 
Viktoriya sovkhoz is being expropriated. 
  Ths land struggle in Dubossarskiy Rayon, which is described 
by the Chisinau press as nothing less than provocation, is not 
the only ground for settling accounts between the right and left 
banks. Not far from Dubossary stands the only bridge across the 
Dniester left intact after the fighting. On the right bank is a 
Moldovan guard post, on the left bank a Dniester region guard 
post. On the bridge itself is a joint guard post with Russian 
peacemaking troops. Recently Russian soldiers have refused to 
do duty detail on the bridge: The bridge is in a defective 
state. Because of a widening lateral crack the joint monitoring 
commision has banned heavy trucks from crossing the bridge. 
Only cars and scheduled buses are permitted, and only then on 
condition that the passengers get out. Traffic nevertheless 
remains heavy. While the Moldovan and Dniester region sides are 
working out who is to repair the bridge and thus control the 
traffic, trucks carrying food use it, Moldovan peacemaking 
troops drive tracked vehicles across it, and Turkish wagons slip 
across on the quiet -- for the now customary bribe in dollars, 
rubles, or leis. Only "suvorovki," the Dniester region rubles 
overstamped with a picture of Suvorov, are not in use here. 
"Who wants them?" They make a charge for the crossing on both 
the left and the right bank. They also tell you amicably that 
the bridge could collapse. 
  The village of Dorotskoye, like the famous Malinovka from 
the well-known operetta, found itself caught between crossfire 
from "left" and "right" during the armed conflict. It has 
remained under dual control. There are two administrations in 
the village -- the rural soviet and the Moldovan primarie [city 
hall] -- and two detachments -- the police and the militia. A 
battalion of Russian peacemaking forces is quartered here. The 
emergency situation prevailing in the security zone is indicated 
not so much by the largest number of armed men per square 
kilometer in the CIS as by the frightened and anxious looks on 
the local peasants' faces. They have been afraid to talk to 
journalists. Just imagine having "Whites to the left of you and 
Reds to the right." Albeit that the Dniester region guards are 
perhaps the less welcome in the Moldovan village. 
  The Russian peacemakers are also "foreigners" here. A week 
ago a drunken picket at the guard post on the bridge demanded 
that Russian soldiers remove reinforced concrete blocks 
obstructing traffic and remove themselves at the same time. 
According to reports from the ordinary soldiers, they often 
receive threats of reprisals. The Moldovan peasants' attitude 
to the Russian soldiers is clear-cut -- they are occupiers. 
  Reminders that you are on foreign soil are also heard from 
the Dniester region side. You will hear all manner of things 
from the Cossacks and border troops whose guard posts are to be 
found, according to the battalion commander, on virtually every 
corner. 
  According to official figures the Joint Peacekmaking Forces 
lost around 20 men last year. This was for a variety of 
reasons, including mishandling of weapons and "drink-related" 
accidents. Just before the new year the battalion in Dorotskoye 
lost one of its men. The leadership of the local Moldovan 
kolkhoz could not find boards to make a coffin for the 
"occupier."

  [Text] Bucharest has to understand once and for all that 
Moldova is a sovereign state, stated Andrei Sangheli in an 
exclusive interview granted to the ITAR-TASS agency also 
received by ROMPRES. 
  Sangheli pointed out that we are brothers, but each of us 
has 
his own home and lives according to his own rules. Some 
representatives of Romania, as we know from our own sources, 
promote a two-faced policy concerning us, that is, openly they 
say that they acknowledge Moldova's independence, but behind our 
backs they claim that our republic is part of Romania, Sangheli 
stated. 
  What strikes me most, he continued, is the stance adopted by 
Romania's Foreign Affairs Ministry, the representative of which 
a few days ago stated that in order to solve the fate of Moldova 
all Romanians should be consulted. I think that the best answer 
to such offensive assertions is the statement made by our 
president, Mircea Snegur, during the [5 February] meeting 
entitled "Our Home, the Republic of Moldova," in which he 
condemned the forces that support unification with Romania, 
after which he issued a presidential decree on organizing a 
public opinion poll among the republic's population with respect 
to the issue of Moldova's independence. 
  It is regrettable that our desire to find out the opinion of 
our people has triggered such reactions on behalf of the 
Romanian press, proving that they do not understand history, and 
also triggered offensive assertions against Moldova's leaders. 
This is really foreign interference in the affairs of a 
sovereign state, the independence of which was first recognized 
by Romania, stated Sangheli in the interview he granted to 
ITAR-TASS.

  [Text] A meeting between Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev and Estonian Defense Forces Commander Major General 
Aleksander Einseln may take place in May, in Moscow. During 
today's meeting with foreign journalists, Einseln said that the 
proposal for such a meeting had originated from the Russian 
side. He noted that Estonia should strive for cooperation with 
all neighboring countries, including Russia. The major general, 
however, did not wish to elaborate on cooperation with its' 
eastern neighbor. 
  Speaking about Russia's military doctrine, Einseln 
emphasized 
that it looks quite acceptable on paper but one must look at how 
it is implemented. So far Russian statements have, in Einseln's 
opinion, sounded quite threatening. At the same time the army 
commander opined that a major part of Russia's aggressive 
statements are meant for domestic consumption or serve as 
blackmail. Einseln hopes that common sense will finally win in 
Russia too. 
  According to Einseln, he is on good terms with the Russian 
servicemen deployed in Estonia. Einseln explains the halt in 
the troop withdrawal with bad weather. Would you be keen to go 
anywhere in such weather? asked Einseln of journalists. Einseln 
supported the Latvian decision to agree to the Russian demands 
on Skrunda radar station. He is also in favor of reducing the 
number of Russian troops in Kaliningrad Oblast and the 
coordination of international aid provided to the Baltic Armed 
Forces. The (?forces) commander thinks that NATO's Partnership 
for Peace program, which Estonia joined on 3 February, is a step 
in the right direction, and at the right time. This has been 
reported by the Baltic News Service.

  [Text] In the interstate talks between Latvia and Russia on 
the functioning of the Skrunda radar station, the delegations 
have agreed on all issues except the payment of rent. This was 
explained today by Sergey Zotov, the leader of the Russian 
delegation. Zotov said that Russia has offered to pay $2 
million a year for the use of the Skrunda site. Latvia, for its 
part, is demanding an astronomical sum -- $400 million. 
  In turn, Latvian delegation head Martins Virsis said that 
$400 million a year is the figure mentioned by Latvia at the 
start of the talks, just as Russia named its sum. Virsis 
expressed the view that the site by its nature is not one that 
can be bargained for, but there is a possibility that a 
compromise could be reached during the talks. 
  On the question of the number of military personnel 
servicing 
the Skrunda radar, Zotov explained that Russia has accommodated 
Latvia's wishes, and has agreed to reduce their number from 817, 
which was initially requested, to 599. Virsis explained that 
Russia has not officially agreed to such a number of service 
personnel. Virsis noted that in the event the proposal is made 
officially, the number of personnel would be considerably 
reduced, and obviously the number would be necessary so that the 
station could function according to the technological process 
envisaged. 
  However, no agreement has yet been reached during the talks 
on the social provision for retired Russian military pensioners. 
Zotov stressed that Russia's agreement of a social nature is a 
part of the general agreement on the withdrawal of the army and 
the agreement on the Skrunda radar. Thereby the agreement on 
the withdrawal of the army cannot be signed separately. The 
talks will continue on Thursday.

  [Text] Riga, Feb 16, BNS -- Russia was the largest 
Latvia's trade partner in 1993, according to figures from the 
State Statistics Committee. 
  In 1993, Latvia imported 181.9 million lats in goods from 
Russia, or 28.5 percent of the total import volume. 
  From Germany, Latvia imported 63.7 million lats in goods, or 
10 percent of the total import. From Lithuania and Sweden, 
Latvia bought 61.2 million lats and 33.8 million lats in goods, 
or 9.6 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively. Latvia bought 
26.5 million lats in goods from Belarus, which is 4.1 percent of 
its total import. 
  The list of Latvia's imports was topped by energy and fuel 
resources which made up 45.3 percent of the total import volume. 
From the import, diesel fuel was 12.8 percent, gasoline was 8.7 
percent, crude oil -- 7.8 percent, natural gas -- 8.1 percent 
and electricity -- 3.7 percent. 
  Latvia also bought land transportation vehicles (8.9 
percent) 
and mechanical equipment (2.9 percent), basically, from Russia 
and Germany. 
  The trade analysis evidences that re-exports constitute 
large 
part of the country's 1993 export. 
  Mineral fuel and oil products made up 13.9 percent of the 
year's exports. From this, 8.4 percent was diesel fuel and jet 
engine fuel -- 2.1 percent. 
  The majority of these goods, or 48.3 percent, were sent to 
the Netherlands. Sweden received 17.4 percent of 
Latvia-exported fuel and oil products. 
  The electricity and natural gas exports were respective 0.7 
percent and 0.3 percent of the total export volume. All 
electricity and gas that Latvia sent Russia was part of its 
supplies to the Russian defense forces, according to the 
statistical reports. 
  An important export position (8.8 percent) is occupied by 
timber and timber products, ferrous metals (7.7 percent) and 
buses (5.3 percent). Timber was mainly sent Great Britain, 
which received 31.6 percent of Latvia's timber export, Sweden 
(21.1 percent) and Finland (13.1 percent). 
  Ferrous metals were chiefly sold to Thailand (23.6 percent), 
China (13.5 percent) and Poland (11.1 percent). 
  Latvia's largest export partner is Russia to which Latvia 
sent 200.1 million lats in goods. Russia is followed by the 
Netherlands which received 55.1 million lats in goods, Germany 
with 44.5 million lats in goods. Sweden bought 43.8 million 
lats in goods, Ukraine -- 40.1 million lats in goods and Belarus 
-- 34.4 million lats in goods from Latvia.

  [Text] Jurmala, Latvia, Feb 16, BNS -- Latvia attaches the 
first priority on the Russian troop withdrawal, the Baltic 
country's foreign minister, Georgs Andrejevs, told his British 
counterpart Douglas Hurd Wednesday in Jurmala. 
  Andrejevs cited the size of the military personnel at the 
Skrunda radar, the size of the radar's rent and the social 
status of retired servicemen in Latvia as the main obstacles 
that block Latvia and Russia from withdrawal agreement. 
  Commenting on the controversial citizenship issue, Andrejevs 
reminded Hurd that Latvia suffered from a heavy influx of 
Russian-speaking immigrants during the 50-year Soviet occupation. 
  At the same time, Andrejevs said, Latvia takes into account 
the reality of today and understands that "some compromises" are 
needed to implement a slow and careful process of naturalization. 
  Latvia regards its enrollment to NATO's Partnership for 
Peace 
program as the first step toward full-fledged membership in the 
Western alliance, Andrejevs said. 
  Hurd praised Latvia's efforts to return to Europe saying 
that 
"we see Latvia as part of the European family." 
  Hurd also spoke positively of Latvia's resolution to 
compromise with Russia on the Skrunda radar installation. 
  The foreign secretary pledged his countries' support to 
Latvia and other Baltic states in becoming active participants 
of the Partnership program.

  [Text] Our purpose is to prevent the implementation of the 
NATO ultimatum regarding Serbia, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey 
Lavrov told the State Duma on Wednesday [16 February]. He 
pointed out that the Foreign Ministry is considering the NATO 
ultimatum as "illegitimate and contradicting with the U.N. 
decisions". 
  Lavrov told parliamentarians that "the Russian Federation's 
representative in the U.N. Security Council had received 
instructions to object to air strike on Sarajevo". He said that 
at Russia's request a commission of the U.N. security Council 
was set up to investigate the explosion at the marketplace in 
the Muslim part of Sarajevo on February 5. 
  Lavrov said the special presidential envoy of the Russian 
Federation Vitaly Churkin reported from the former Yugoslavia 
that "the agreements reached by the Serbs and the Muslims a few 
days ago are being implemented, heavy equipment is being 
transferred to the U.N. forces or pulled out of Sarajaevo". 
Even limited air strikes of the NATO aviation on positions of 
the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo would mean qualitative changes 
in the military political situation not only in Bosnia, but all 
over Europe, a high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax on 
Wednesday. 
  In his words, such air strikes "would put an end to the plan 
of peaceful settlement of the Bosnian conflict, because they 
would embitter the Bosnian Serbs and make the Muslims even more 
irreconcilable". 
  The diplomat also said that the special envoy of the Russian 
president, deputy foreign minister Vitaliy Churkin, who is in 
the Balkans now, left Zagreb for Belgrade on Wednesday to meet 
again with the Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. The 
diplomat did not go into details about this unplanned trip 
noting only that it was urged by "supreme interests".

  [Text] One of the main subjects discussed at the talks 
between Boris Yeltsin and John Major was the Bosnian problem. 
The Russian president and the British prime minister reiterated 
that it should be resolved peacefully above all. Responding to 
journalists' questions after the signing at the Kremlin of the 
Russo-British declaration on strategic missiles, Boris Yeltsin 
said: Certain people are trying to decide Bosnian questions 
without Russia's participation. We will not allow this to 
happen. Russia will be an active participant in the talks, so 
that a peaceful end is found to the war in Yugoslavia. 
  On Monday the UN Forces Command in former Yugoslavia ordered 
the Russian battalion stationed in eastern Croatia to send 400 
men to Bosnia. RIA Novosti correspondent Sergey Gryzunov 
reports on the situation in former Yugoslavia: 
  [Begin Gryzunov recording] Russian diplomatic sources in 
Belgrade confirmed that the UN Command in former Yugoslavia had 
ordered the Russian battalion stationed in the Vukovar region of 
eastern Croatia to send a reinforced company to Bosnia and 
deploy it on the demarcation line between Serbs and Muslims. 
Unconfirmed reports say that after consultations with Moscow 
the battalion commander was instructed to stay put. According 
to unconfirmed reports, the Russian battalion did not receive a 
categorical order from the UN Command, but an inquiry about the 
possibility of transferring part of the battalion. In this 
instance the Russian paratroopers, who number 1,200, are 
subordinate to the peacekeeping forces in former Yugoslavia, not 
to the command of Russia's airborne assault forces. 
  Today, 16 February, Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's 
special representative at the talks on former Yugoslavia, 
changed his travel plans and made an urgent flight to Belgrade 
from Zagreb. He will probably hold a fresh round of meetings, 
his second during the last three days, with the Serbian 
leadership. The question of participation by Russian soldiers 
in the Bosnian conflict is bound to come up at these talks. 
Yesterday in Zagreb Churkin said that as long as the West makes 
decisions about Bosnia-Herzegovina without Russian 
participation, there could be absolutely no question of using 
the Russian army in operations on the territory of the present 
conflict. 
  A former criminal nicknamed Arkan, who set up his own Party 
of Serbian Unity and became a member of parliament, called on 
the Serbs to rally to the defense of the motherland if air 
strikes go ahead. Arkan, whose extradition is being 
unsuccessfully sought by Interpol, has said he is using Russian 
secret weapons that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy gave to him. Thus, 
one can say that attempts are being made to draw Russia into the 
Bosnian conflict under any pretext. [end recording]

  [Text] As is known, in accordance with the ultimatum issued 
by the UN Security Council, the bombing of the Bosnian Serb 
positions by NATO aviation may start 21 February. In this 
connection the redeployment has started of the blue berets in 
the region where military operations may take place. Russian 
blue berets also received this order, but they have refused to 
obey it. 
  We contacted Leonid Kerestedzhiyants, Russian ambassador to 
Croatia, by telephone and asked him to comment on this decision. 
  [Begin Kerestedzhiyants recording] It was not only the 
Russian battalion that received this order, but a number of 
other battalions as part of a plan to reinforce the blue berets' 
positions in Sarajevo, to separate the opposing sides. The 
battalion did not obey this order in agreement with Moscow 
because the action which is currently being undertaken in the 
area around Sarajevo with regard to the possible bombing of the 
Serb positions, an issue that has been resolved without the 
involvement of Russia and only within the framework of NATO 
frees us, in our opinion, from now acting, obeying the orders of 
commanders who do not regard it possible to take into account 
our position, our approach to untangling the Bosnian- Sarajevo 
knot. 
  Our battalion is located in the Vostok sector, a long way 
from Sarajevo, and in general it does not border on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is on the frontier between Croatia and 
Serbia. We do not consider it possible that our battalion, our 
soldiers should find themselves in the zone where military 
action may take place, which we are opposed to in principle.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Even limited NATO air strikes on positions of the 
Bosnian Serbs would mean qualitative changes in the 
military-political situation not only in Bosnia but all over 
Europe, a Russian senior diplomat told Interfax Wednesday. 
  He said the strikes would negatively influence a plan for a 
peaceful settlement because they would make the Bosnian Serbs 
more hostile and the Moslems more irreconcilable. 
  The diplomat said that the special envoy of the Russian 
President, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, currently in 
the Balkan countries, left Zagreb Wednesday for Belgrade to 
again meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The 
diplomat preferred not to provide the details of the trip. He 
only said that it was dictated by "supreme interests." 
  He confirmed that recently the command of the UN protection 
force in the former Yugoslavia attempted, ignoring Moscow, to 
send part of the Russian servicemen from the battalion stationed 
in Slavonia (Croatia), to Sarajevo. "We reacted with a 
demarche, after which the command of the UN Protection Force 
apologized and said that in the future the decision on the 
location of the Russian servicemen will be taken after 
preliminary consultations with Moscow, said the diplomat. 
  He, however, did not deny that the Russian "blue helmets" 
may 
be deployed near the Bosnian capital. He said, however, that 
this would only happen if the conflicting sides agree to such a 
measure, in which case the question of the NATO bombing would be 
crossed out from the agenda and reinforcements will be needed to 
back up the UN troops deployed around Sarajevo. But even in 
such a case, the last word would be Moscow's, he concluded. 
  Sources in the State Duma told Interfax that members of the 
parliamentary committee for geopolitics, which on Tuesday 
considered the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, decided, after 
the consultations with Russian Foreign Ministry experts, to give 
up the appeal to restore the former Yugoslavia. 
  According to one deputy, the new wording of the committee's 
resolution will contain an appeal to all Bosnian factions to 
halt, as early as possible, bloodshed and to forgive the 
offences of the past.

  [Text] Belgrade -- Unless the truth is established on this 
occasion, the Muslim side will commit further crimes, deceiving 
the world community and contributing to the escalation of war in 
the region. So said Radovan Karadzic, president of the Serbian 
Republic (Bosnia-Herzegovina), in a written appeal to Vitaliy 
Churkin, the Russian president's representative at the talks on 
Yugoslavia. 
  The leader of the Bosnian Serbs again urged the Russian 
leadership to ensure the establishment of an international 
independent commission of experts to investigate the explosion 
in Sarajevo which cost the lives of dozens of innocent people. 
Karadzic stressed that in the search for the truth it is 
necessary to carry out the political analysis Russian Federation 
President Boris Yeltsin mentioned. Such an analysis will show 
which of the warring sides in Bosnia has derived political 
benefit from the crime.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION Political Editor, in </F>
Nizhniy Novgorod] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister saw for himself today the fruits 
of Britain's multi-million pound know-how fund designed to boost 
the transformation of Russia's economy. But he can hardly have 
been impressed with what he saw on a trip to Nizhniy Novgorod, 
the place where President Boris Yeltsin's reforms are moving 
fastest. 
  The point of the visit was to see a trucking factory -- but 
it turned out to be little more than a collection of ramshackle 
buildings. A large, burly man, speaking in Russian, described 
the machinery to Mr Major, who tried to look interested. For 
most of his visit he has been wearing a typically Russian black 
fur hat, which seemed just a fraction too large, falling down 
his forehead to just above his eyes. He wore it this morning as 
he boarded the aircraft in Moscow but was bare-headed during his 
walkabout in Nizhniy Novgorod when he was mobbed by some 400 
people. 
  When someone asked him why he was not wearing it on such a 
cold day, Mr Major retorted with a smile: "Not a bit of it. It 
is a nice, pleasant spring day." In fact, the town was bleak 
and the temperature several degrees below freezing. 
  During his walkabout, Mr Major entered a habadasher's shop 
and later went into a restaurant for a buffet lunch. The news 
that he planned to meet the people was broadcast frequently on 
local radio and hundreds of people turned out to greet him. In 
crowded Poprovka Street, he plunged into the crowds and one 
woman told him with a smile: "It's good to see you here but you 
can't see Nizhniy Novgorod in a single day." 
  A smiling Mr Major replied: "One day here is better than a 
day sitting in my office back in London." 
  The Prime Minister is the first Western leader in office to 
visit Nizhny Novgorod since it was founded in 1221. 
  When one local dignitary urged him to promise that he would 
return, Mr Major told him: "It is 770 years since a Western 
leader came here -- I promise you that I will be back before 
another 770 years have elapsed." 
  Overall, however, his visit to Russia has been dominated by 
the civil war in Bosnia. The Russians have had centuries of 
affinity with the Serbs and would be reluctant to see air 
strikes on them if they failed to comply with the Nato demand to 
surrender control of their artillery on the outskirts of 
Sarajevo or remove it altogether. The Prime Minister assured Mr 
Yeltsin this would be a limited operation if an air strike had 
to happen at all. 
  Mr Yeltsin, although warning that Russia would not allow 
force to be used without her sanction, seemed to be moving 
towards the idea that air strikes might be necessary as one 
means of ending the war. 
  For his part, Mr Major said he believed they could now see 
peace starting up in Sarajevo and hoped this could lead to a 
settlement elsewhere in Bosnia. But he stressed -- and the view 
was shared by Mr Yeltsin -- that there could never be a military 
solution. 
  If the UN commanders on the ground appeal for more troops, 
Britain's policy would be that those countries which have not 
contributed troops so far should now be asked to do so. 
  But no details were available from the Prime Minister's 
office on whether such a request had been made by Britain to the 
UN headquarters in New York. 
  The visit included the signing of several economic and 
cultural agreements between the two countries. One was a pledge 
by both sides that nuclear missiles should be "de-targeted" from 
pointing at each of the two countries. They also signed an 
agreement that British and Russian troops, mostly Army 
personnel, would take part for the first time for 50 years in 
joint exercises, in Russia, and in the United Kingdom. It is 
expected that the UK exercises would be held on Salisbury Plain, 
although no firm decision has been taken. 
  Elsewhere, the Prime Minister met British and Russian 
businessmen, Russian parliamentarians and other influential 
figures. 
  He was accompanied in Moscow by Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd, who this morning split off from the main party and flew 
into Riga for talks with the leaders of the three Baltic states. 
  Mrs Norma Major, who accompanied her husband, visited a 
children's hospital in Moscow and the Bolshoi Ballet School. 
  Mr Major virtually refused to answer questions during his 
visit about Back to Basics and his domestic problems, including 
the resignation as a parliamentary private secretary of Tory MP 
Hartley Booth over his "kiss and cuddle" relationship with Emily 
Barr, his 22-year-old former assistant. He makes it a policy, 
other than in exceptional circumstances, to answer questions 
when he is abroad only about immediate business in hand.

Minister John Major put forward a new initiative at a meeting 
with local entrepreneurs at the joint stock society 
"Nizhnegorodksya Yarmarka" on Wednesday [16 February] to open a 
business centre in Nizhniy Novgorod which will render technical 
assistance to businessmen. 
  The British prime minister said that the move will promote 
people's personal interest in carrying out reforms. He pointed 
out that the best way for cooperation between Russia and Great 
Britain is the interaction between private sectors of the two 
countries. 
  Later in the day major visited a voucher auction centre and 
attended an auction held there. 
  On Wednesday evening the British prime minister left Nizhniy 
Novgorod for London.

  [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- Prime Ministers Viktor 
Chernomyrdin of Russia and Grant Bagratyan of Armenia signed an 
agreement on trade and economic cooperation in 1994 in Moscow 
late on Wednesday [16 February]. 
  Under the agreement, Russia will provide Armenia with 141.3 
million U.S. dollars worth of goods in 1994. Energy supplies to 
Armenia will remain at about the 1993 level. 
  Chernomyrdin stressed the need to boost trade between the 
two 
countries. He said Russia understands the difficulties facing 
Armenia but the question of Russian credits to Armenia was not 
discussed at the talks because "Russia's budget has not been 
approved yet." He added that "in any event only limited credits 
will be issued and only in extreme situations."

  [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS--Armenia, which faces an 
acute energy crisis, may restart its nuclear power plant with 
the Russian help this year, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister 
Oleg Soskovets and Armenian Prime Minister Hrant Bagratyan 
agreed on Thursday. They agreed that a corresponding agreement 
may be signed already next week. 
  The power plant, which was shut down after a major 
earthquake 
shook Armenia late in 1988, may resume operations already this 
year if Russia supplies the necessary equipment and personnel. 
Armenia pledged to bear all expenses and Soskovets advised that 
Armenian diaspora abroad could render financial assistance as 
well. 
  It is expected that the Russian personnel at the plant will 
number 560 experts and the plant will produce 800 megawatts of 
electricity. The restart of the Armenian nuclear power plant is 
opposed by Germany and Turkey, according to Bagratyan.

<F P=106> [Speech by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, at a meeting of </F>
Afghan war veterans on the fifth anniversary of the conclusion 
of the war, in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses in Moscow on 15 
February -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Aleksandr Shkirando, master of ceremonies] The 
first speaker, in accordance with military rank, will be Pavel 
Sergeyevich Grachev, Russian Defense Minister and Hero of the 
Soviet Union, who for many of those here is, above all, a 
comrade-in-arms who gave over four years to the war in 
Afghanistan. 
  Pavel Sergeyevich, a great deal has been said over the past 
five years about the Afghan war. Many appraisals have been 
made, mainly negative ones. But, you know, even we journalists 
cannot speak confidently about the results and figures. After 
all, it is a matter of concern to many that the numbers of our 
losses, the numbers even of those who took part in the war, are 
still unknown. Maybe today, after five years, you, as Defense 
Minister, will lift that veil for us. 
  [Grachev] Yes, after five years, we shall lift the veil, at 
last, from the tragedy that occurred several years ago. 
  Esteemed comrades and friends in battle. One of the most 
dramatic pages in our history is now in the past -- a war that 
lasted a long nine years and 51 days. A war that even today 
does not allow our memories to rest and evokes pain in our 
hearts. 
  Today's assessment of those events is well known. But no 
matter who describes the Afghan war and how he describes it, our 
casualties cannot be devalued, nor our wounds and illnesses, or 
the grey hairs of our mothers and wives. 
  We Afghan veterans, and there are 545,000 of us, performed 
our military duty honorably, and we are beyond reproach. The 
servicemen in Afghanistan during that war were soldiers of whom 
the vast majority did not spare themselves and displayed true 
courage, heroism and loyalty to the military oath, to the 
people, to the Motherland. Nearly 200,000 of them have been 
decorated with Orders and medals; 76 became Heroes of the Soviet 
Union, including 26 posthumously. Today their names are known 
to the whole country. 
  It is not our fault that the army had to pay with its own 
blood for the mistakes of the political leaders. So today, 15 
February, we are marking the anniversary not of the withdrawal 
of the troops, not of any jubilee. Today is a day of 
recollection and a day of mourning for us. A total of 13,833 of 
our comrades-in-arms did not return from the Afghan war. The 
lamentable number of the overall losses in Afghanistan is also 
well known -- 14,454 people. Eternal memory and glory to them, 
the officers and men, generals, manual and office workers, 
security men, MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] personnel, 
advisers, doctors, nurses, and journalists. We shall remember 
them, bowing our heads low, for as long as our hearts shall 
beat. I call on you to honor the bright memory of those who 
died with a minute's silence. [crowd rises and observes moment 
of silence] 
  Please be seated. Friends in battle, Afghan veterans. We 
paid a terrible price in that war. While carrying out combat 
operations on the territory of Afghanistan, 23,258 people were 
wounded, 26,798 people were injured, maimed or shocked, and over 
400,000 suffered illnesses of varying degrees of severity -- 
mainly infectious ones. We have no right to forget that in 
Russia alone 4,500 people maimed in Afghanistan live alongside 
us. Over 7,000 people in Russia, Russian families, are in 
mourning for sons, brothers or fathers. It is our sacred duty, 
the sacred duty of Russia, to do everything possible so as not 
to leave the mothers and widows of those who died, and the 
orphaned children alone with their grief. I think that today we 
are once again obliged to pose the questions of the social 
protection, psychological and moral support of Afghan veterans 
in society, with full regard for their acuteness. 
  Unfortunately, even today, someone is trying to depict the 
Afghan veterans as a ruined, lost generation. Such statements 
can only be made by people without honor or conscience. The 
Afghan veterans do not expect handouts or charity from anyone. 
Most of them have found a worthy place in society. They are 
working, studying, bringing up children, helping their friends 
in combat and, doing their utmost -- I'm not afraid to use a 
lofty word -- to build up and to help to reconstruct the country. 
  But society must value them properly. It is necessary to 
step up the efforts to search for our servicemen and bring them 
home -- the prisoners of war, whose numbers are still put at 
293. Practical, real business is essential in each specific 
case and in each destiny. 
  I am addressing these words not just to the people of 
Russia, 
but also to the Afghan veterans who are today the citizens of 
other Commonwealth states. They number 320,000. Today our 
armed forces comprise some 30,000 officers and ensigns who trod 
the fiery roads of Afghanistan. They are a particular class of 
servicemen, and I want to give them a special mention. Today 
the Afghan veterans form the real nucleus of the new Russian 
Army. The armed forces are proud of them and draw on their 
experience of life and combat. They bring into the teams of 
servicemen a spirit of comradeship, mutual help and true service 
to the Fatherland. Their role is extremely high in educational 
and patriotic work and in dealing with welfare matters. 
  As for the Afghan veterans' movement as a whole, we see in 
it 
a healthy force aimed at strengthening morale and the combat 
spirit of the army and navy, building up new armed forces, 
uniting and regenerating Russia. 
  Dear Afghan veterans. Dear members of the families, near and 
dear ones. I wish you on this day cheerfulness, optimism, joie 
de vivre, good health and happiness - to you and those who are 
close to you. Thank you. 
  [Shkirando] Thank you, Pavel Sergeyevich, The figures you 
have given are higher than those that were known previously, and 
it is, in general, surprising that it has taken five years to 
establish at least that truth. But, clearly, it is the fate of 
this war, as it is the fate of those who died there or who went 
through the war, that we find out the truth only years later. I 
personally am sure that this is not the whole truth either and 
that it has not been stated in full.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Oliynik: "Lingering Echo of the Afghan </F>
War"] 
  [Text] Think back to 15 February 1989.... This date, 
when, five years ago, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from 
Afghanistan was completed, is not marked in the calendar. But 
for the people is it a Day of Remembrance, when we remember 
those who did not come home. A ceremony was held 14 February in 
the Central House of the Russian Army to mark the fifth 
anniversary of the withdrawal of the 40th Army from Afghanistan. 
It was conducted by the Russian Federation Defense Ministry. 
  "Whatever society thinks of the Afghan war today," Hero of 
the Soviet Union Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation 
defense minister, said in his opening speech, "it is clear to 
us, the military, that the vast majority of Afgan war veterans, 
as soldiers in that undeclared war, displayed true courage and 
heroism and loyalty to the military oath and to the homeland. 
We are not to blame for the fact that the Army was forced to 
pay in blood for the political leaders' mistakes, and pay dearly 
-- 13,833 of our fighting comrades died brave deaths in 
Afghanistan. May their memory and reputation live forever!" 
  The ceremony participants observed a minute's silence in 
memory of the dead. 
  "There are around 30,000 commissioned and noncommissioned 
officers in the Russian Army at the moment who served in 
Afghanistan," Hero of the Soviet Union Colonel General Boris 
Gromov, Russian Federation deputy defense minister, stressed in 
his report. "The Defense Ministry has done and will continue to 
do everything possible to provide social protection for Afghan 
war veterans and in particular for the families of the dead and 
missing and for invalids." 
  He noted that, despite financial problems, the Defense 
Ministry has just recently given assistance to more than 7,000 
families of soldiers killed in the Afghan war and to around 
4,600 invalids living in Russia. 
  The meeting was addressed by Marshal of the Soviet Union 
Sergey Sokolov, retired Colonel General Yuriy Tukharinov, 
Aviation Colonel General Viktor Kot, and USSR People's Artist 
Iosif Kobzon. 
  Yesterday, 15 February, wreaths were laid on the Grave of 
the 
Unknown Soldier and at the Perovo memorial to Muscovites killed 
in the Afghan War on behalf of the Defense Ministry leadership 
and the Committee for Internationalist Soldiers' Affairs under 
the Council of Commonwealth States' Heads of Government.

committee for international affairs in making foreign-policy 
decisions. 
  Gaydar believes that it would be expedient to use part of 
the 
European Community's aid for creating efficient economic 
legislation and developing a system of economic education. He 
also emphasized the importance of promoting the development of 
the democratic institutions and supporting the regional 
democratic press which, he said, experiences serious economic 
problems and suffers from financial dependence on the local 
authorities. 
  Gaydar assured Klepsch that the Russia's Choice faction 
would 
support Russia's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. Commenting on the State Duma's position, he said that it 
was unpredictable.

  [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- Europarliament Chairman 
Egon Klepsch met with the leadership of the Russian State Duma 
to discuss prospects for enhancing bilateral cooperation between 
the two bodies. 
  The sides also focused on the situation in the European 
Union, the situation in Bosnia and EU [European Union] 
technological assistance to CIS coutnries. 
  Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his 
talks in Moscow here today, Klepsch said that he had met with 
Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to 
discuss the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and inform them 
about measures taken by the Europarliament to settle the 
conflict. 
  The Europarliament supported the NATO ultimatum urging 
Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy guns from around Sarajevo. 
  Magdaline Hoff, who is in charged of relations with CIS 
states and who also attended the news conference, called for 
holding talks in Bosnia on the basis of partnership and 
cooperation rather than dictating conditions to one side.

<F P=106> [From the "Espionage" program] </F>
  [Text] [First announcer] The Central Intelligence Agency is 
trying to earn money wherever it can. For example, a CIA 
foreign language teaching computer program, for Russian and 
Spanish in particular, recently appeared in American shops. 
These programs, known by the name Exito, were compiled by CIA 
experts specially for the teaching of their agents. According 
to a representative of the U.S. intelligence service, with the 
help of Exito most students start speaking Spanish, for example, 
after two weeks of taking the course for seven hours per day. 
The teaching program that has come onto the market has hardly 
been changed. Only the special terms and expressions that the 
CIA agents were to use in their espionage work have been 
eliminated. 
  [Second announcer] Naturally the commercial activity of the 
CIA does not cover all the expenses of that intelligence 
department. Therefore, in spite of the cuts announced in the 
state budget, the U.S. Administration has asked Congress for $28 
billion for the needs of the intelligence service. They should 
definitely get down to concentrating on our economic interests, 
Bill Clinton, the new U.S. President, explained. He evidently 
had in mind the wave of financial and industrial espionage which 
has gripped the western world at the present time. 
  [First announcer] The CIA is asserting that the United 
States 
is literally teeming with foreign agents at the present time. 
India, Russia, Germany, and Egypt are conducting active 
industrial espionage against the United States. French agents 
have almost infiltrated 49 U.S. companies. Taiwan has 280 spies 
in the United States. The CIA staff calls industrial espionage 
the main threat to national interests. According to the CIA, 
the United States lost $100 billion last year because of this. 
  [Second announcer] There are friendly states, but there are 
no friendly intelligence services, Allen Dulles, one of the 
founders of the CIA, reminds us. The enemies in this new 
special services' war are the former allies in the struggle 
against communism -- the Japanese, the French, and finally 
Mossad. Israel undertook espionage in the United States 
earlier, moreover. We draw your attention to an account about 
the Israeli intelligence service. 
  [Begin video report showing Mossad units, news clips of 
international events that involved Mossad] [Correspondent] 
Mossad: In actual fact that malicious-sounding, hissing word, 
the utterance of which by nationalist patriots is almost 
indecent simply means administration, the administration of the 
intelligence service, of special operations. It appeared in 
1951 following the reorganization of the Israeli special 
services. Apart from Mossad, there is also the Aman military 
intelligence service in Israel, the Shin Bet security service, 
and the department of research and planning of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. 
  Mossad is involved in political intelligence work and is 
responsible for all the operations of Israel's special services 
abroad. Mossad is financed from the military budget. It 
consists of nine directorates in which approximately 2,000 
members of staff are employed. Of these there were 500 
officers. Naturally there are more Mossad agents. All members 
of staff in the organization enjoy benefits. They enjoy a 
supplement of 30 percent to their wages for risk. They also 
have the right to import goods from abroad without paying duty 
on them. And they go to the top of the housing list. 
  When a person joins Mossad, military training is taken into 
account. Parachutists and navy divers are given preference. 
New recruits undergo training at two intelligence schools, in 
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. They spend the first six months 
studying the fundamentals of espionage, coding, mastering 
weapons, self-defense techniques, using electronic equipment, 
methods of shadowing and identification. Then they divide into 
specializations according to country. 
  Almost all Mossad's officers are obliged to speak Arabic 
fluently. For this purpose, Mossad and counterintelligence 
definitely sends members of its staff to the Gaza sector and to 
the West Bank for them to practice their Arabic for two years. 
Among the special training assignments are the following, for 
example. To penetrate Jordan and make one's way to the desert 
where only Bedouin live and to return alive, and not to cause 
any fuss while doing it. 
  So, throughout the world many Mossad staff members are 
working under the wing of state or private institutions. The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, travel agencies, as airline 
representatives of the El Al air company, and of trade unions. 
Officers of the Israeli intelligence service enjoy great 
freedom in carrying out specific operations. For example, when 
recruiting an agent, an officer is not obliged to consult the 
center every time. In recruiting agents Mossad makes 
considerable use of the Jewish diaspora which is known to be the 
most unified in the world. Incidentally this is precisely what 
explains the success of the Israeli intelligence service. 
  Moreover, in recruiting people, Mossad also uses false 
information. They may approach officers from various NATO 
countries, for example. 
  Naturally, Mossad is most active in the Arab world. It 
gathers information on literally everything, on arms, mutual 
relations between Arab leaders, the arms trade and in general on 
the political activity of the Arabs. Mossad actively pursues 
measures to influence the politics in those countries. It is 
widely known that it is not squeamish about political murders. 
The Italian magazine PANORAMA published a list of 24 
Palestinian leaders who were eliminated by Mossad from 1972 to 
1988. These were journalists, large-scale arms traders, 
intelligence officers, and PLO military leaders. The murders 
were carried out in Beirut, Rome, Paris, Athens, Tunis, and in 
Cyprus. 
  Mossad has a strong position on the African continent, in 
Kenya, Liberia, and Zaire. It has particularly close mutual 
relations with the Republic of South Africa intelligence 
service. In the 1960's Mossad received $80 million from the CIA 
to promote the activity of the Israeli intelligence service in 
Africa. Mossad instructors also trained sabotage experts in 
Honduras and Pakistan, and trained intelligence officers for a 
number of Latin American countries. 
  Mossad also carried out and is carrying out intelligence 
activity against the Soviet Union, Europe and even the United 
States, and the theft of nuclear materials, military technology, 
and secret documents. In 1968 the plans for the French Mirage 
fighter were stolen which formed the basis for a similar Israeli 
aircraft, the Kfir. In 1969, five of the latest missile patrol 
boats were stolen from the French port of Cherbourg. In 1979 
Israeli agents made a recording of a conversation between Andrew 
Young, the U.S. permanent representative at the United Nations, 
and the PLO observer. The CIA arrested the Israeli spy (J. 
Ford) for handing over classified documents. In 1986 Vanunu, a 
former member of staff of the Israeli nuclear center who told 
the public about Israel's nuclear potential was kidnapped in 
London, 
  Moreover the most considerable successes of any intelligence 
service always remain in the shadows. Therefore it is for the 
experts to judge whether all these notorious operations by 
Mossad should be considered successes. 
  In the view of the CIA expressed in a special report on 
Mossad, the specific task of the Israeli intelligence service 
consists of sowing discord among the Arabs and carrying out 
actions that will promote the sympathy of the West toward 
Israel. As far as the methods of the Israeli intelligence 
service are concerned, no one put it as eloquently as Yitzaq 
Shamir, Israel's former premier: After one shoots one's enemy, 
one fires a second shot to be sure that he is dead. 
  He should know. In his time this person had a dizzy career 
in Mossad, from an ordinary operative in 1955 to deputy director 
in 1965. 
  Yitzaq Shamir was not the first and not the last to start 
his 
career in the intelligence service. The intelligence service in 
various countries nurtured quite a few well known scientists, 
political scientists, and writers: Graham Green and Somerset 
Maugham, John Le Carre, and Daniel Defoe. In their time these 
people worked for the British intelligence service. We have 
examples like that, too.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel Petr Belov: "About Missiles, Their </F>
Uranium, and Targeting Information"] 
  [Text] As an independent expert on systems safety 
engineering I cannot fail to share my fears at the latest "gift" 
to the Russian people from the munificence of the presidents who 
gathered in Moscow at the start of the year. Let me remind you 
that a year previously there was a similar "gift" in the form of 
the hasty signing of the treaty on the reduction of strategic 
offensive arms -- START II -- which, even before it was 
ratified, had played a pernicious role for us. Here I shall 
dwell only on the latest new "partnership" initiatives which 
develop this treaty: the nontargeting of strategic missiles 
against each other, Ukraine's complete elimination of all 
nuclear weapons, and the United States' purchase of Russian 
weapons-grade uranium. 
  I think there is no better guarantee of stability under 
present conditions than the certainty of our potential for not 
leaving an aggressor unpunished. The correctness of my thoughts 
is confirmed not only by the lessons of history but also by the 
recent conclusions of the international conference in Rio de 
Janeiro, the statements by U.S. Vice President A. Gore, and the 
research of Academician N. Amosov. In that light you cannot 
help concluding that the agreements concluded in Moscow recently 
on the military-economic aspects of cooperation are similar in 
form and anti-Russian in content. Their danger lies in 
definitively depriving Russia of the potential for deterrence, 
in selling off for a song what belongs to its future generations. 
<H5>  Retargeting of Missiles </H5>
  Perhaps this is the most effective confirmation (for the 
uninitiated) of partnership relations between the former 
adversaries. Here there is a political dividend for all 
presidents at the same time and (although extremely implausible) 
a reduction in the gravity of the consequences of the 
unsanctioned launch of any missile: Its lethal charge will 
merely fall into the ocean or onto an uninhabited island. It is 
emphasized, it is true, that it is hardly possible to control 
the targeting information of modern strategic missiles and 
consequently this initiative is allegedly utterly "innocuous." 
  In reality everything will depend on the energy of the 
"partners'" political leadership and the degree of resistance to 
that initiative from military professionals. After all, only 
they know the other side: the loss of combat readiness is more 
dangerous to the victim than to the aggressor; mistakes and 
disruptions during retargeting are fraught with an excessive 
risk of accidents; the computing of missiles' new targeting 
information and the replacement of old ones give rise to 
colossal expenditure; the vigilance and responsibility of the 
combat crew on duty with "untargeted" missiles are reduced; and 
the actions of these crews when they receive a combat order 
becomes drastically more complicated. All this as a whole casts 
doubt on certainty as regards our combat readiness. 
  If this initiative is implemented Russia loses in the combat 
readiness of its multiple-warhead silo-based missiles 
considerable more than the United States. At least several 
minutes essential to re-record the "cancelled" targeting 
information. With our missiles' more radical "retargeting," 
which is indicated by the quite protracted deadline for its 
implementation (nearly five months) tens of minutes, if not 
hours, will be required to restore their combat readiness. In 
all cases our strategic nuclear forces could be deprived of 
their deterrent role in a retaliatory counter-strike, the only 
kind of strike acceptable to us, and will then be destroyed if 
necessary by high-precision, diversionary or other weapons. 
  In contrast to us, the U.S. side remains in a more 
advantageous position. After all, its combat might is based on 
high-precision cruise missiles and submarine-launched ballistic 
missiles. To all appearances it is not proposed to retarget the 
former and it is pointless to retarget the latter: They are 
already continuously and automatically retargeted in the process 
of combat patrol. It is virtually impossible to deprive them of 
this potential, still less to monitor the removal of targeting 
information from naval missiles. 
  You ask: Why was the United States previously skeptical 
about our statement on the nontargeting of Russian missiles on 
U.S. territory but is now itself coming out with a similar 
initiative? I think the reason here lies in the sincere 
readiness of present-day Russia's top political echelons to 
undertake unilateral disarmament. Nor is there any doubt that a 
gamble is being taken on the military's impotence: After all, 
it was the Russian Federation Defense Ministry leaders and above 
all the Strategic Rocket Forces who unconditionally agreed to 
the "destabilizing" role of our multiple-warhead silo-based 
missiles in favor of single-warhead mobile missiles. 
<H5>  Ukraine's Disarmament </H5>
  The surprising attention paid toward the problem of 
"Ukrainian" nuclear weapons, including by the new U.S. 
President, is generated by the same overtly expressed U.S. 
desire for absolute military superiority but not through its own 
arms upgrading but through the weakening of potential 
adversaries. It is Ukraine's obstinacy over adopting 
nuclear-free status and, worse, its intention to keep 46 of the 
most modern multiple-warhead silo-based SS-24 missiles with 460 
warheads which are not only preventing the destruction of 
similar Russian SS-18 missiles under START II but are also 
casting doubt on the U.S. THAAD antimissile program (a cheap 
SDI). 
  With the United States' present unconditional supremacy in 
offensive arms both conventional and nuclear, it also wants to 
have a guaranteed antimissile defense. The multiple-warhead 
silo-based missiles are an obstacle. Even the full-scale SDI, 
never mind its truncated version, cannot intercept their 
numerous warheads. The missiles on our submarines and the 
single-warhead SS-25 missiles are another matter: They have a 
minimal chance even of flying since as a result of their lack of 
defense they could easily be destroyed beforehand on their 
patrol routes or at the points of permanent deployment. If some 
of them do survive they will be able to take off only one after 
another and there will be very few of them (no more than 100) so 
the United States needs only a relatively cheap ground-based ABM 
system -- in other words the last stage of SDI geared to the 
destruction of up to 200 nuclear missiles. 
  Those are the reasons for B. Clinton's entirely natural 
interest in Ukrainian nuclear status and the United States' as 
yet unrealized wish to review the two first articles of the 1972 
ABM treaty formally banning the creation of even a restricted 
territorial ABM system. Thus very few obstacles are left on the 
path toward undivided rule and absolute impunity for any actions. 
  America's position can be understood but is unacceptable, 
not 
only to Russia and Ukraine, but also to the rest of the world. 
There are at least two reasons for this: The satisfaction of 
U.S. ambitions will not increase stability in the world and, if 
it does not immediately plunge the world into fresh anarchy, 
will at any rate make it violent. The U.S. pragmatists' 
cynicism is striking: After all, they intend to implement the 
United States' attainment of absolute military supremacy and its 
own safety at other people's expenses, primarily at Russian 
expense. 
  What lies behind their impudent treatment of "sovereign 
Ukraine?" The removal of its natural right to choose the 
minimum necessary and effective strategic deterrent means will 
hardly be compensated for by illusory economic and military 
guarantees. The billion promised for weapons-grade uranium plus 
the further two billion in the form of possible IMF credits will 
hardly resurrect its economy. Expectations for an even greater 
reduction by the Russian side of prices for energy carriers 
exported for the Ukrainians are also obviously naive: Prices on 
the world market have already been made as cheap as possible 
through the zeal of the Americans. 
<H5>  Uranium Deal </H5>
  But however paradoxical it may seem, the most destructive 
thing for Russia will be its "breakthrough" to the market in 
enriched uranium, where the Americans have always ruled. Nor 
will they lose our this time. If Russia received 12 billion for 
500 tonnes of uranium sold to the United States, the Americans 
as a result will pocket at least 300 billion -- such is the 
profitability of this "deal of the century." After all, the 
main second-hand dealer under the contract is the "Enrichment 
Corporation" firm, which has retained the right to review the 
terms of the deal annually, naturally in the direction of 
reducing the purchase price. 
  Most striking of all was official Moscow's agreement to the 
long term nature of this contract. After all, it is already 
known that at present world extraction rates the stocks of 
natural uranium, oil, and gas are sufficient for 50 years. Nor 
do we have guarantees of the development of thermonuclear energy 
and plutonium reactors. Having lost two thirds of its uranium 
sources with the collapse of the USSR, Russia is now selling 
nearly all its released weapons-grade uranium?! Without uranium 
nuclear electric power stations you will not get far with coal, 
logs, and hydroelectric power stations. 
  The actual atmosphere in which the "uranium deal" was 
prepared and the interpretation of this agreement for the public 
are also interesting. Nuclear Power Minister V. Mikhaylov, who 
explained to the Americans the figures for the quantity of 
weapons-great uranium we have and the number of nuclear 
warheads, took a most active part in creating a halo of "dire 
necessity" around this step. Since the revised figures exceeded 
estimates so far available by approximately 50 percent, this was 
reflected in a reduction of purchase prices for uranium. Having 
bought it the Americans will be able right now to resell the 
uranium at three to five times the price, and what will the 
price be in 20 years? 
  Nor can we fail to note one more aspect of this affair -- 
its 
link with our unilateral disarmament under START II. Russia's 
selling off of its uranium will have a deplorable effect on 
international stability. After all, even potentially Russia 
will be deprived of the opportunity to play a deterrent role 
since it will be unable to step up its nuclear potential in the 
event of a drastic aggravation of the situation. And who will 
guarantee that the need for this step will not be provoked by 
Washington itself, for instance, as a result of its unilateral 
rejection of ABM restrictions? In contrast to us, the United 
States retains its weapons-grade plutonium together with nuclear 
warheads and the platforms for them. 
  As a result the "uranium deal" will deprive our heirs of 
fuel 
for nuclear power engineering, no alternative to which can yet 
be seen, leaving in exchange mountains of radioactive waste. 
  I am sure that Russia does not need such bilateral and 
trilateral agreements. Their time passed with the collapse of 
the USSR, when it was possible and necessary to agree with the 
United States "as equals." With present realities, with the 
existence of only one superpower, all the others must be 
concerned for their own self-preservation autonomously or by 
cooperating. Russia and Ukraine need an independent military 
technology policy: We cannot do without the minimum necessary 
number of multiple-warhead silo-based missiles. We must 
preserve and modernize the existing 50 Ukrainian SS-24 missiles 
and 200 Russian SS-18 missiles together, helping each other. 
  I should like our parliaments to find the time to 
investigate 
and look into the results promised to us by the results of the 
Moscow meeting of presidents. I think the way out of the 
situation which is taking shape lies in the unification of the 
fraternal Slav and other peoples who have lived together since 
time immemorial in the face of the now real threat of their 
"depersonalization" and extinction and the "Europeanization" and 
"Americanization" of their natural resources. Instead of 
fueling passions over the nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory 
we must render Ukraine aid in ensuring their safeguarding and, 
if we are asked, in preserving some part of them. After all, we 
are also in extreme need of Ukraine's assistance in maintaining 
the combat readiness of the heavy Russian SS-18 missiles. 
  Russia's all-around cooperation with Ukraine in the military 
and economic fields is mutually advantageous. Our countries 
will become richer and stronger as a result. And with the 
good-neighborliness of powers like ours things will be more 
peaceful for others too -- the peoples know that.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kondratyev from the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>
  [Text] The DPRK allowed the specialists of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to inspect nuclear 
facilities. An IAEA spokesman said so on 15 February: This is 
good news. The news has been awaited since last March when 
Pyongyang declared its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and refused international inspections on 
North Korean nuclear facilities. 
  I recall that such measures proclaimed by Pyongyang had an 
effect of a suddenly exploded bomb. Many capitals, particularly 
in Asia-Pacific countries, expressed worry over the measures. 
This was because, eventually, nuclear weapons would keep 
proliferating in the world. 
  The DPRK was, and is still suspected to have developed 
nuclear bombs. Such suspicion has been strengthened after 
Pyongyang took the step. The IAEA applied pressure on North 
Korea with a view to resuming nuclear inspection. 
  A sound way of thinking was superior in Pyongyang. The 
inspection will begin after two or three weeks. It is clear that 
the decision of the DPRK leadership will exert affirmative 
influence on the situation on the Korean peninsula and in its 
surrounding areas. 
  First of all, it will open a road for North-South dialogue. 
In addition, the decision will bring about a possibility of 
proceeding talks between North Korea and the United States and 
between North Korea and Japan for normalization of relations. 
  Most importantly, people hope that the result of inspection 
will remove the suspicion on the intent of the DPRK to develop 
its own nuclear weapons. 
  Washington and Seoul have already expressed their support 
for 
Pyongyang's agreement on IAEA's nuclear inspection. Pyongyang's 
agreement will also arouse a similar reaction from the entire 
world.

<F P=106> [Leonid Levitskiy report: "Estonia Secretly Issues Its </F>
Passports to Russian Citizens...and Accuses Russian Foreign 
Ministry of Slander"] 
  [Text] Tallinn -- The Estonian State Assembly has adopted 
a statement-appeal to UN member states. The parliamentarians 
make a resolute protest against intensifying imperialist trends 
in Russia's foreign policy, according to which the Baltic states 
are included in Russia's sphere of influence. Statements made 
by Russian Government members directed against the Estonian 
state contravene the provisions of the UN Charter and the CSCE 
Final Act.... 
  The parliamentary statement was preceded by an Estonian 
Foreign Ministry statement assessing as slanderous utterances by 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev about serious violations 
of human rights in Estonia and Latvia and ethnic cleansing in 
these countries.... 
  A sentence spoken by Russian Foreign Ministry Information 
and 
Press Department spokesman Mikhail Demurin, to the effect that 
diplomatic resources alone are not enough to support Russians in 
CIS and Baltic countries, has provoked indignation among both 
politicians and diplomats. President Lennart Meri summoned 
Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Trofimov and demanded an 
explanation for the latest statement by the Russian Foreign 
Ministry leaders. President Meri's press service made the 
following statement: Estonian reality has nothing to do with the 
picture that radical-chauvinist politicians in Moscow are trying 
to paint. The "Russian threat" has rallied the parliament, the 
president, and the prime minister, who were in sharp conflict 
with each other until recently. Such anti-Russian tension is 
perhaps unprecedented in Estonia. It is as though a detonator 
has been activated to explode a charge of passions that had been 
stored up for a long time. 
  The Russian Embassy press service circulated the full text 
of 
Mikhail Demurin's statement: On the Foreign Ministry's 
initiative, a program to protect the interests of ethnic 
Russians abroad and give them support is being prepared. This 
envisages special television and radio broadcasting, 
humanitarian aid, support for Russian business and enterprises 
in which the Russian-speaking population is employed, 
collaboration in banking, and customs and economic privileges. 
That is why, Demurin says, diplomatic efforts and resources are 
insufficient -- decisions and active support from the Russian 
Government are needed. 
  Why is the story of the planned program perceived as a 
threat 
in Estonia? Surely it is not just because the Russian 
Government intends to help Russians to settle down more firmly 
in the countries where they have found themselves at the whim of 
fate, and does not intend to remove them back to their ethnic 
homeland?

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 16, BNS -- The Baltic free-trade 
agreement signed Sept. 13 in Tallinn comes into force as of 
April 1. 
  Lithuania was the last Baltic state to ratify the agreement 
in January and the Estonian Government, with whom the agreement 
is deposited, was officially notified of this in February. 
  The agreement integrates the three markets of Estonia, 
Latvia 
and Lithuania into one economic area with about 8 million 
consumers. The Estonian Foreign Ministry informs in its survey 
of the agreement that it is similar to the agreements which all 
the three countries have so far concluded with Finland, Sweden, 
Norway and Switzerland. 
  The agreement lays down the principles of trade in 
industrial 
goods, while an agreement on trade in agricultural produce will 
be concluded separately. 
  The agreement stipulates that all customs duties and import 
quotas in trade between the three countries will be abolished 
and no new duties on imports will be introduced. 
  At least for the initial period, however, some restrictions 
on exports will be maintained. Namely Latvia will limit exports 
of gypsum, limestone flux, raw hides, logs and timber, as well 
as scrap metal by export tariffs of 20-100 percent. 
  Lithuania will maintain tariffs on the export of raw hides, 
glands and certain types of timber. Estonia may limit exports 
of oil shale, gravel, clay and quartz sand by quotas. 
  The reason for maintaining the restrictions for the time 
being is to encourage domestic industries to use local raw 
materials and to prevent their exports so as to direct the 
development and structural reform of local processing industries. 
  An important feature of the Baltic free-trade agreement are 
the provisions of cumulation of the rules of origin which will 
enable the industries which use inputs originating in one 
country to export their manufactured production into Finland, 
Sweden, Norway and Switzerland free from tariff. Thus, the 
agreement widens the markets of EFTA [European Free Trade 
Association] for Baltic industries. 
  The agreement includes provisions on customs cooperation and 
defines the ways and means of determining the rules of origin 
under which goods qualify for tariff-free import. Certificates 
of origin issued by the respective customs authorities will be 
the documentary evidence for meeting these criteria. 
  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania agreed to liberalize trade, 
but 
also to create favorable conditions for competition. 
  State aid and dumping are not considered to be in line with 
the general functioning of the free-trade agreement. Emergency 
measures, however, can be taken if products originating in one 
country seriously threaten the market of any other party. The 
tariffs imposed must not exceed 25 percent and their term of 
validity must not be above five years. 
  The agreement allows temporary restrictions on export, 
import 
and transit to protect moral standards, national security, 
health and life of animals, people and plants, environment, 
intellectual property, and in some other cases. 
  The three states will set up a joint commission to supervise 
the functioning of the agreement, solve any possible problems, 
and develop closer cooperation in the future. 
  The agreement will stay in force indefinitely. 
  The Foreign Ministry survey notes that the Baltic states 
have 
earlier signed bilateral agreements on avoiding double taxation, 
which also foster trade between the three countries.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev report: "Number Two Man in Zhirinovskiy's </F>
Party Quits LDPR Faction and Accuses Vladimir Volfovich of 
Extremism"] 
  [Text] It is entirely justified to say that the speech by 
Deputy V. Kobelev was the chief sensation at the plenary session 
of the State Duma 16 February. The deputy demanded that he be 
allowed to read out a statement that he and party colleague A. 
Pronin were quitting the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
[LDPR] faction. Since the author of the statement was the 
"number two man" in Zhirinovskiy's party, observers believe that 
it is valid to talk about the possibility of a serious split in 
this large faction. 
  Clearly, these considerations also influenced the speech of 
the LDPR leader and intensified his traditional stridency. 
Zhirinovskiy told participants in the session that V. Kobelev 
cannot be considered either a member of the LDPR or a deputy 
since he has been excluded "by a party decision" from its ranks 
"for actions incompatible with the status of a deputy and a 
member of the LDPR." We will strip them of their mandate, 
Zhirinovskiy stressed, and promised to institute criminal 
proceedings against the renegades for improper actions allegedly 
committed by them in the past. 
  In conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent, Deputy 
Kobelev in turn termed Zhirinovskiy's accusations against him a 
lie and recalled that the LDPR leader is fond of insulting 
people. He also did not confirm the information about his 
expulsion from the party. 
  "I have left Zhirinovskiy's faction, not the LDPR, because I 
consider myself a representative in the Duma of the LDPR and not 
of one man's party," Kobelev stated. 
  In his opinion, Zhirinovskiy should be condemned for all his 
actions at the party congress because they are not commensurate 
with the LDPR program, which envisages neither extremism nor 
interference in the affairs of other countries. In conclusion, 
Kobelev promised Zhirinovskiy that if the latter continued his 
hostile actions against him he would fight fire with fire. 
  Meanwhile the situation which has developed within the LDPR 
faction as a result of this goes beyond the bounds of internal 
factional disputes. After all, the Duma standing orders have 
yet to be ratified and, consequently, one of the main questions 
has yet to be resolved, which is: Does a parliamentary faction 
have the right to recall deputies who entered parliament on the 
party lists if they "betray" the interests of the faction. It 
is possible that the scandal within the LDPR faction will 
influence the solution of this problem in such a way that the 
recall of deputies will be banned, because there is quite a 
large number of legislators who have an interest in a split in 
the ranks of Zhirinovskiy's supporters.

  [Text] Kazan February 16 TASS -- "The main thing is that 
the treaty was concluded of the basis of two constitutions now 
in force -- those of Russia and Tatarstan, not violating these 
fundamental laws but being guided by them," President Mintimer 
Shaymiyev of Tatarstan stressed in his speech on Tatarstan 
television devoted to the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan 
signed in Moscow. 
  This document, he said, recognizes the right to 
self-determination, equality, defense of sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, and the single economic space. Tatarstan 
exclusively owns and uses its land, bowels of the earth, and 
movable and immovable property. Simultaneously an instrument of 
the implementation of this treaty was adopted which represents 
11 inter-governmental agreements. 
  The position of Tatarstan, Mintimer Shaymiyev noted, is 
directed at the democratic formation of Russia. In the 
concluding part of his speech Mintimer Shaymiyev thanked 
President Boris Yeltsin for his "invariable and consistent 
position shown to the very end -- up to the signing of the 
treaty."

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry announced on 
Wednesday [16 February] that fighting continued in Azerbaijan's 
Kelbadzhar Region, as Armenian forces were making further 
efforts to regain control over the road linking Kelbadzhar and 
Agdere (Armenian name Mardakert). 
  During combat operations Armenians sustained many losses and 
lost an armored vehicle, says Baku. 
  Fighting also continued in the south of the Fizuli Region 
near the strategic railway station of Goradiz. The Azerbaijani 
Defense Ministry reports that over the past two days Armenians 
have lost about 600 men. 
  Sources in Stepanakert have not confirmed this information. 
  The headquarters of the Karabakh army told Interfax that 
Azerbaijani forces attempted to launch an attack on the village 
of Tonashen in the Mardakert Region. The Karabakh formations 
rebuffed that attack.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- The first round of the 
debate by the State Duma (lower house of the Russian parliament) 
of the Russian president's draft decision on amnesty in 
connection with the adoption of the Russian Constitution ended 
in a deadlock. 
  Several votes on various draft decisions by the Duma showed 
that the overwhelming majority of legislators rejected the 
president's draft in the form it was submitted. 
  Quite a number of critical remarks were levelled at the 
presidential document during the debate. Some deputies claimed 
that the amnesty in question will aggravate the situation in the 
country, although data from Interior Ministry specialists 
refuted these claims. 
  However, the prevailing demand was to divide amnesty into 
criminal and politico-economic and to adopt two documents: the 
presidential draft concerning criminal wrong-doings and the 
Duma's draft on political amnesty as well as amnesty to people 
convicted for economic crimes. 
  "It was clear from the very beginning for the legislation 
committee that the president's initiative would not pass as it 
is," its Chairman Vladimir Isakov said at the end of the morning 
session. 
  In Isakov's opinion, "lawmakers are now facing an 
alternative 
of whether to reject the presidential draft completely or amend 
it, taking two decisions: on criminal and political amnesties," 
he added. 
  A two-hour interval has been announced in the Duma sessions. 
Factions will hold consultations to hammer out new draft 
decisions of the lower chamber. These drafts will be put to 
vote at the evening session. 
  Under a political amnesty for the sake of national 
reconciliation, lawmakers understand, above all, an amnesty to 
people involved in the events of August 19 and 21, 1991, May 1 
and October 3-4, 1993. 
  Some claim that the question on amnesty to participants in 
the October events may be raised only after the parliamentary 
commission on their investigation completes its work. 
  The presidential draft decision has already been published 
in 
the press. In the opinion of many deputies this fact makes them 
hostages of the present situation. 
  "If we adopt the document, we'll be accused of rampant 
crime. 
If we reject the document, mass riots will take place in 
penitentiaries. The blame will be again laid at the Duma's 
door," said legislator Vassiliy Lipitsky.

  [Excerpt] Estonian Defense Minister Indrek Kannik said that 
during a meeting in Riga with Latvian Defense Minister Valdis 
Pavlovskis and Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius in 
Riga, the Baltic countries' further integration into the Western 
European institutions -- the European Union, NATO, and the West 
European Union -- have been under discussion, as well as further 
cooperation within NATO's Partnership for Peace program and the 
creation of the Baltic states' peacekeeping battalion. The 
defense ministers signed a joint communique. 
  Four joint working groups were formed, Kannik said. They 
will be dealing with communications, control of airspace and 
borders, weapon standardization, and preparations for the joint 
peacekeeping battalion. According to Kannik, the key aim in 
setting up a working group for weapon standardization is to 
discuss matters first with the other two Baltic countries -- 
should one of the Baltic states want to purchase weapons in the 
future -- or decide what kind of ammunition to use. It was 
agreed that the working groups must have a first meeting before 
15 March and draft their basic positions before 15 May. 
  At the beginning of (?April), a meeting of Nordic and Baltic 
defense ministers will take place in [word indistinct], the 
defense minister said. The Baltic defense ministers acknowledge 
in their joint communique the need to train and exchange 
military attaches between the three countries. Kannik said that 
an Estonian proposal for participation in the Partnership For 
Peace program is being coordinated by the Foreign Ministry. 
During the course of March it should become clear what shape 
the proposal will take. According to Kannik, this will depend 
on political and financial constraints. He thinks that so far, 
the biggest interest in the formation of a Baltic peacekeeping 
battalion has been displayed by the Nordic countries and 
Britain. They have also offered help. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Sergey Sidorov report: "NATO Disregards Russia's Position"] </F>
  [Text] The NATO Council does not have the authority to 
make decisions on a Bosnian settlement, including decisions on 
inflicting strikes inside Bosnia -- such decisions must be 
adopted by the UN Security Council. So says a Russian Foreign 
Ministry statement circulated at UN headquarters in New York as 
a Security Council document. 
  The first day of open debate on the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina demonstrated the three fundamental approaches 
taken by the NATO member countries, Russia, and the Muslim 
countries. The NATO countries' stance has not changed, they 
still insist that the decision to carry out air strikes does not 
require additional approval from the Security Council. 
Evidently NATO will continue to disregard Russia's 
diametrically opposed stance by preparing to undertake the first 
ever military operation outside the bloc's zone of 
responsibility. The representatives of the Muslim leadership of 
Bosnia, and of Iran and Turkey, reflected the Muslim side's 
stance in their speeches. They insisted that NATO attack 
Serbian positions not only in Sarajevo but also in other parts 
of Bosnia. 
  In all probability no one now knows how to coordinate the 
largely polarized notions of a Bosnian settlement without 
splitting the Security Council along cold war lines. A great 
deal will depend on the actions taken by the conflicting sides 
in Sarajevo over the next few days. Russia's proposal to 
immediately convene the Security Council to examine practical 
ways of demilitarizing Sarajevo and introducing a UN 
administration there could, evidently, be a compromise solution. 
That allows the NATO countries and Russia "to stick with their 
friends," so to speak, while resolving what is the main task at 
this stage -- the demilitarization of the Bosnian capital. 
Russia did incidentally submit this initiative long before the 
present deterioration in the situation in Bosnia and, had it 
been accepted by its Western partners in a timely fashion, it 
might have been possible to avoid the bloody drama in Sarajevo's 
market that spurred NATO to decide on bombing raids. Real moves 
to transfer Sarajevo to UN control could remove the threat of 
air strikes. 
  Nonetheless the way to secure a lasting peace in Bosnia lies 
in the formulation by the main interested parties -- the United 
States, the EU, and Russia -- of a unified concept of a 
political solution to the conflict. This was stated at the 
Russian State Duma hearings Tuesday. Indeed, if these sides 
want to keep Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unified state and member of 
the United Nations they should first remember that after World 
War II this republic was a state with three peoples -- Serbs, 
Croats, and Muslims -- where all vital decisions were adopted by 
consensus alone. Consequently, it is inadmissible at any stage 
in the settlement process to take anyone's side in the conflict, 
which may result in the escalation of the conflict. At the 
moment the Muslim side alone benefits from the bombing threats. 
The proposal made by the United States and most Islamic states 
that the embargo on arms shipments to Bosnia be lifted is also 
untenable since this means shipments of arms to the Bosnian 
Muslims alone. 
  The latest news from Sarajevo is depressing. Serbian forces 
have stopped handing over heavy arms to the "blue helmets" and 
are demanding UN monitoring of the numerically superior Muslim 
infantry. In its turn, the Muslim leadership is not showing 
willingness to do this.

  [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd met Baltic 
countries' foreign ministers in Riga. Urmas Loit provides the 
details. 
  [Begin recording] [Loit] Foreign Minister Juri Luik, what 
was 
most important about this meeting with British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd and your Baltic counterparts? 
  [Luik] The most important aspect was evidently the symbolic 
side of things. British Prime Minister John Major and Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd met the Russian leadership 15 February 
and it was seen as necessary to inform us of these talks. The 
fact that we are seen as partners who are to be taken seriously, 
that it is necessary to inform us and discuss matters with us -- 
this is perhaps the most important aspect of the meeting. 
  We discussed here, behind closed doors, also bilateral 
relations between the countries. We discussed integration into 
Europe and our membership in the European Union. Britain 
promised help with free- trade talks. We have small problems 
there with agriculture and textiles. Britain, as one of the 
most experienced supporters of free trade, promised to put in a 
word for us. You have heard here, Britain will be helping us to 
build our army and helping with the setting up of the Baltic 
peacekeeping battalion. And so, we have discussed quite a 
number of bilateral and multipartite issues. 
  [Loit] Obviously you also discussed the Baltic countries' 
relations with Russia. What is the British attitude to some of 
the contradictions here? 
  [Luik] Well, Douglas Hurd emphasized in a very [word 
indistinct] manner that in talking about the Baltic countries we 
are talking about sovereign states who have full rights to 
decide whom they choose to be friends with and whom not, and 
whose army is on their territory and whose is not. Full support 
was given to our policy of [Russian] troop withdrawal. Douglas 
Hurd promised to keep a higher focus on this issue than hitherto 
in Britain, and so we had quite a constructive discussion about 
relations with Russia. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Russian-Iranian Consultations </F>
on Karabakh End"] 
  [Text] Russian-Iranian consultations on the settlement of 
the Karabakh conflict have ended in Moscow. V.N. Kazimirov, the 
Russian Federation Foreign Ministry's special envoy, and M. 
Bank, general director of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, 
expressed profound concern in connection with the major 
escalation of hostilities in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  There was particular concern over the widening scale of 
combat actions, their ferocity, and the increasing bloodshed, 
which is making the conflict increasingly inhumane. 
  Both sides noted that the growing internationalization of 
the 
conflict is a great threat to the cause of peace and regional 
stability. 
  During the consultations it was admitted that a sound and 
long-term basis for a settlement can only realistically be 
established by relying on peaceful political methods and the 
sides' ability to reach a reasonable compromise. 
  The Russian side stressed that the chief priority is the 
achievement of an immediate cease-fire and the cessation of all 
combat actions, and the conclusion of the relevant agreement. 
  The participants in the consultations noted that Russia and 
Iran support the world community's efforts to settle the 
conflict. Being in direct proximity to and being committed to 
the settlement of the conflict, Russia and Iran have repeatedly 
put forward initiatives on its peaceful resolution and, 
maintaining constant contacts, will continue their efforts in 
this direction.

  [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS -- On Thursday, the interior 
ministers of the member countries of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States concluded their two-day meeting by signing a 
series of agreements on cooperation. The meeting was attended 
by delegations from all the CIS countries, as well as an 
observer delegation from Latvia. 
  The Russian delegation was headed by Interior Minister 
Viktor 
Yerin, ITAR-TASS learned in the Russian Interior Ministry's 
public communications centre. 
  During their meetings, the ministers examined the 
effectiveness of cooperation between their respective interior 
ministries. In particular, they looked to strengthen their 
joint measures in the fight against organized crime. 
  Decisions were adopted concerning the bureau for the 
coordination of the fight against organized crime and other 
forms of dangerous crimes committed on CIS territory. This 
bureau was formed in accordance with the decision of the council 
of CIS heads of state from September 24, 1993, and will be 
located in Moscow. The interior ministers confirmed S. 
Rukhlyadev, an official from the Belarusian Interior Ministry, 
as director of the bureau. His deputy, from the Armenian 
Interior Ministry, will be R. Kara-Pogosyan. 
  In addition, official representatives signed an agreement on 
cooperation between internal ministries in the fight against 
organized crime. 
  Other agreements were signed on regulations for the 
extradition of suspected criminals and on police escorts for 
especially valuable or strategic cargoes being transported from 
one country to another. 
  According to the Russian Internal Ministry, it is planned to 
hold the next meeting in Uzbekistan.

  [Text] Almaty February 17 TASS--Kazakh Prime Minister 
Sergey Tereshchenko sent a letter to Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin outlining his views on ways to strengthen 
the CIS economic union. 
  "The decisions adopted at the Ashgabat summit foster the 
hope 
for the development of integration processes in the 
commonwealth. The meeting confirmed the general understanding 
of the fact that coordinated activities will make it easier to 
resolve the protracted economic crisis. It is not incidental 
that all CIS countries announced their adherence to the economic 
union of the commonwealth," the letter said. 
  The Kazakh prime minister suggested discussing a set of 
urgent matters at the upcoming meetings of the CIS heads of 
state and heads of government to be held in March, in order to 
resolve the current crisis as soon as possible. 
  One of the major tasks is to step up work to establish a 
common customs zone and a free trade zone in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. Tereshchenko believes it desirable to 
accelerate the establishment of an inter-state association of 
free trade. 
  In order to overcome the payment crisis and normalise 
payment 
and credit relations between CIS states, it is necessary to 
adopt measures engaging the interstate bank which was set up 
over a year ago but has not begun operation yet, Tereshchenko 
said. He called for establishing a CIS payment centre within 
the bank and reorganising it later into a currency union with a 
common currency. 
  Tereshchenko believes that for the CIS economic union to 
function normally, a coordinating body should be set up. He 
suggested Moscow as the seat of such a body. 
  "The adoption of decisions on all these questions will 
enable 
(us) to begin practical realisation of the idea of the economic 
union and reach a new level of relations within the CIS," the 
Kazakh premier said. 
  Tereshchenko stressed that the Coordinating and Consultative 
Committee of the commonwealth could work on these questions and 
prepare respective documents. He suggested postponing the 
meeting of the CIS heads of government until a later date or 
holding it simultaneously with the meeting of the CIS heads of 
state due to take place in Moscow on March 31, 1994.

  [Text] At the CIS headquarters in Minsk, a group of 
experts has completed drafting an agreement on Ukraine's 
joining, as an associate member, the treaty on establishing the 
CIS economic union. The draft is to be submitted for 
consideration by the CIS Coordinative and Consultative 
Committee, which will hold its meeting in Moscow on 1 March. As 
Yevgeniy Gorelik, press secretary of the CIS Executive 
Committee, told an RID correspondent, the main controversies 
which arose during the drafting of the agreement concerned an 
article defining the status of Ukrainian representatives in the 
coordinative bodies of the economic union. 
  The Uzbek delegation insisted that Ukrainian experts and 
permanent representatives be entitled to only put forward their 
suggestions. The Ukrainian delegation, which arrived in Minsk 
to participate in the project, proposed that it should be 
defined in one of the articles that decisions adopted by the CIS 
coordinative bodies be considered as recommendations with regard 
to Ukraine. The majority of participants in the meeting did 
not, however, accept this proposal. The last word in this 
dispute rests with the prime ministers and presidents who will 
chair sessions of the Council of CIS Leaders and Government 
Heads at the end of March, said Yevgeniy Gorelik.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 18 (ITAR-TASS)--The ROSSIYSKIE VESTI 
newspaper carries several articles on taxation in the Russian 
Federation under the general headline "All Suffer From Taxation 
Press, However Treasury is Empty". 
  Referring to the opinion of experts from the Russian 
Economics Ministry, the newspaper writes: "The government now 
collects only 60-65 per cent of all taxes due for payment, which 
is clearly below the average of other countries. We have to 
achieve the receipt of up to 80 per cent of taxes to the state 
budget". 
  In the opinion of specialists from the American Heritage 
fund, income taxes from working people should be cut. Russian 
Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin believes that "to introduce 
new taxes now means to aggravate conditions for economic 
activities and to increase mistrust of tax legislation". 
  The TRUD newspaper writes that the recent visits by Fuel and 
Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik and Public Education Minister 
Yevgeniy Tkachenko to the Kuznetsk coal basin in Siberia 
somewhat defused the explosive situation there. 
  At the same time, the newspaper notes that the question on a 
strike by coal miners and other workers remains open in that 
area. For instance, 60 per cent of workers employed by light 
industry enterprises have nothing to do: warehouses are packed 
with ready-made goods, while trading firms prefer to buy imports. 
  Every third builder went on a forced leave: customers have 
no 
money to pay for the work done. "Some 20,000 projects stand 
partially built," the newspaper notes. 
  Appraising the work done by the cabinet of former Prime 
Minister Yegor Gaydar, prominent economist Nikolay Shmelev 
writes in the newspaper that "the reformers went too far". To 
change the situation in the country, it is necessary "to start, 
at long last, to conduct a stiff industrial policy", he claims. 
  The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper writes on the same topic, 
noting that "the long-term programme for production of weaponry 
and the government financial support for the conversion of the 
munitions industry" remain a headache for the government. 
  According to the newspaper, it is unprofitable up to this 
time to fill government military orders: they are paid at 
ridiculously low prices. 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper claims that the explosive 
social and economic situation in Russia can be explained, among 
other things, by the fact that the government has no action 
programme. 
  The PRAVDA newspaper notes that the situation in the Russian 
economy is very difficult after two years of "shock therapy". 
"It would be an empty talk to speak about stabilisation in the 
country," the newspaper adds. According to PRAVDA, the course 
of Russian reforms "needs immediate adjustments". 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper features an exclusive 
interview 
with Bundeswehr General Inspector Klaus Naumann who claims that 
the armed forces of Russia and Germany can cooperate in future. 
In his opinion, the two countries "play an important, if not 
decisive, role" in creating a system of European security. 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes about a spectre of 
a 
new cold war in connection with NATO's decision to use force if 
Bosnian Serbs do not withdraw heavy weaponry from the Sarajevo 
area. 
  "Russia, put before another difficult choice, tries to 
remain 
its own self," the newspaper writes. "The NATO ultimatum is 
declared 'illegitimate' and at variance with U.N. decisions. 
  The newspaper notes that the recent illness "has not 
weakened 
the political will of the Russian President who warned that 
'some people try to resolve the Bosnian question without Russia. 
We shall not permit this'". 
  PRAVDA front-pages a report on fanning up anti-Russian 
sentiments in Estonia. It points to a recent "resolute protest" 
by the Estonian parliament against allegedly "rising imperialist 
trends in Russia's foreign policy".

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 17 Feb -- Russia's Air Force will not take 
part in bombing Bosnia. This is in accord with the position 
adopted by Russia which has expressed its opposition to missile 
and bomb strikes against Bosnian Serbs. The ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told today in the press center of the Air 
Force that the Russian Air Force Command considers that the 
Bosnian conflict must be resolved by political methods. 
  Russian military airmen consider that with modern aerial 
equipment it is difficult to achieve high precision bombing of 
artillery positions. In conditions of mountainous, broken 
terrain in former Yugoslavia, the effect of aerial bombing will 
be insignificant. The Russian Air Force Command, in particular, 
is worried that totally innocent people and the civilian 
population could suffer during the bombing. 
  The press center of the Russian Air Force rules out the 
possibility of any future participation by Russian Air Forces in 
the peacekeeping forces under the UN's aegis.

  [Text] We have just received by fax a Russian Foreign 
Ministry statement. It says: 
  In recent days Russia has made additional efforts to give 
effect to its initiative on getting the blockade of Sarajevo 
removed and having the city handed over to the control of the 
UN. That initiative was put forward back at the 47th session of 
the General Assembly. We have been striving to implement this 
initiative by acting openly within the framework of Security 
Council resolutions. 
  This line is being continued by us also at the present time 
despite the grave exacerbation of the situation around Sarajevo 
for well-known reasons. 
  As a result of the steps undertaken by the Russian 
leadership 
and intense diplomatic work, this sustained and consistent line 
which rules out unilateral ultimatums has borne fruit. 
  In response to our appeal, the Bosnian Serbs at their 
assembly in Pale have taken a decision to withdraw their heavy 
armaments from the vicinity of Sarajevo. 
  We consider that this display of goodwill by one of the 
warring sides at a critical moment for a settlement will produce 
equally specific steps in return. 
  We call on the Bosnia Government without delay to place all 
its heavy armaments in the vicinity of Sarajevo under the 
control of the UN forces in accordance with the secretary 
general's plan, which he proposed in his letter of 10 February 
to the Security Council. 
  We also call on our partners in a Bosnian settlement, 
primarily the United States and the countries of the European 
Union, in the spirit of their statements on a preference for a 
political solution to the problem, to bring the necessary 
influence to bear on the Bosnian Government in order that it 
should cooperate with the UN as regards the total lifting of the 
siege of Sarajevo and its demilitarization. 
  At this crucial moment, it is extremely important to exclude 
the likelihood of any provocations and sabotage of this peace 
process. On this depends the fate not only of Sarajevo, but of 
the whole Bosnian settlement as well. 
  Once the siege of Sarajevo is lifted, the UN Security 
Council 
could, as we have suggested, proceed, as a matter of urgency, to 
examine ways of establishing a UN administrative directorate in 
the city, and also to examine measures to reinforce other 
dangerous areas on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Increasing its concrete contribution towards ensuring a turn 
towards peace, Russia is ready to send a part of its military 
contingent, which is within the UN forces, to ensure 
verification of the implementation of the understandings on the 
lifting of the Sarajevo siege.

  [Text] Moscow, 17 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry today issued a statement in which it calls on the 
United States and the countries of the European Union "to exert 
the necessary influence on the Bosnian Government in order to 
ensure that it cooperates with the United Nations in completely 
unblocking and demilitarizing Sarajevo." 
  The document notes that, as a result of the steps which have 
been undertaken by the Russian leadership, "the firm and 
consistent line, excluding unilateral ultimatums, has produced 
results." In response to an appeal from Russia, the Bosnian 
Serbs adopted a decision to withdraw their heavy weapons from 
the region of Sarajevo. 
  In this connection, the Russian Foreign Ministry calls on 
the 
Bosnian Government "without delay to place all its heavy weapons 
in the region of Sarajevo under the control of the UN forces." 
  Russia's Foreign Ministry considers that in addition to 
lifting the blockade from Sarajevo, the UN Security Council 
should "urgently begin searching for ways to establish UN 
administrative rule in the city, as well as implement measures 
aimed at reinforcing other safety areas on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Russia also announces that it is ready to send part of its 
military contingent within the UN forces "on a mission of 
ensuring that the agreements on removing the blockade from 
Sarajevo are observed."

  [Text] Belgrade, 17 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia's President 
B.N. Yeltsin today sent a message to S. Milosevic, president of 
the Republic of Serbia, and which is also addressed to R. 
Karadzic, other Serbian leaders, and the Serbian people. 
  The message contains Russia's request to the Serbs to 
withdraw their heavy weapons from Sarajevo in as short a time as 
possible in the interests of stopping the bloodshed, and 
expressing Russia's readiness to deploy its contingent in 
Sarajevo within the framework of the UN peacekeeping operation. 
  Yeltsin's message was handed over to S. Milosevic in 
Belgrade 
and to the Bosnian Serbs' leaders in Pale by Vitaliy Churkin, 
the Russian president's special envoy and Russian deputy foreign 
minister. 
  The Serbian leaders have accepted the Russian Federation's 
initiative with gratitude. R. Karadzic stated at a news press 
conference in Pale that the Bosnian Serbs will withdraw their 
heavy weapons within the next few days. At the same time, they 
count on the Muslim troops also halting all military actions in 
Sarajevo, and that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] will also 
keep their side of the bargain. 
  The Russian and Serbian sides expressed mutual hope that by 
solving the Sarajevo crisis they will help to end the war and to 
achieve a political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] The Bosnian Serbs agreed to meet the demands to 
withdraw their heavy artillery outside the 20-km zone around 
Sarajevo and to allow the subunits of the Russian troops 
stationed in Croatia with the UN peacekeeping forces to monitor 
this process. 
  Commenting on this situation in a telephone interview with 
the news service, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov 
expressed the opinion that there will not be any bombardment of 
Sarajevo. He believes that, after the decision made by the 
Bosnian Serbs, the problem of an ultimatum has been completely 
removed and that after Sarajevo is unblocked it will be 
necessary to take prompt measures to secure positive results. 
To accomplish this, the Security Council should establish a UN 
administrative authority in Sarajevo, take measures to 
strengthen safety in other areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 
resume talks in Geneva. 
  Touching on the reason Russia has been accused of holding a 
clearly-expressed pro-Serbian position, the Russian deputy 
foreign minister noted that, given many countries' unambiguous 
anti-Serbian position, Russia's position helped preserve the 
balance and provide equal rights to the participants in the 
conflict.

  [Text] "As a result of a hasty and unthoughtful policy" 
with respect to former Yugoslavia the European Community has 
appeared "on the brink of a widescale military conflict," says a 
joint statement of the parliamentary factions of the Russian 
Communist Party, the group Russian Way, and Agrarian Party of 
Russia adopted on Wednesday [16 February]. 
  The statement points out that the announcement of the NATO 
ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs with a threat to bomb their 
positions aggravates the Yugoslavian crisis still more. 
According to the authors of this document, the question 
concerns "an open interference" on the part of the NATO 
countries and the position of the Russian Foreign Ministry looks 
"unclear." 
  In order to overcome the conflict the deputies proposed to 
the Russian president and government to address the UN with an 
initiative to remove economic sanctions with respect to 
Yugoslavia and to prevent bombardment of the former Yugoslavia 
territory by using its right to a veto in the Security Council. 
In addition, the authors of this statement appealed to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's government to render economic and humanitarian 
aid to Yugoslavia's peoples. 
  The Russian State Duma has been recommended to send a 
parliamentary delegation to Yugoslavia and to the conflict zone 
to examine the situation in the region.

outside the U.S. Consulate General here to express their support 
of Bosnian Serbs. 
  After demonstrating for half an hour with a megaphone,

attempt to present self-made transparancies to consulate 
officials, but were not admitted into the building. After that, 
the gathering peacefully dispersed.

<F P=106> [Sergey Sidorov report: "Those Who Make Decisions Are </F>
Accountable for Them"] 
  [Text] It is intolerable that Russian soldiers should be 
sent to locations where their lives will be endangered as a 
result of decisions made without Russia's participation, Vitaliy 
Churkin, the Russian president's special spokesman on 
Yugoslavia, said in Zagreb with regard to the possible dispatch 
to Bosnia of the unit of Russian "blue helmets" stationed in 
Serb Krajina. 
  The order to transfer 400 servicemen (around one-third of 
the 
personnel of the Russian battalion) was given to battalion 
commander Colonel Sergey Voznesenskiy by the headquarters of the 
UN forces in Zagreb Monday without coordination with Moscow. 
Aside from the fact that there was a breach of normal procedure 
here, which presupposes consent to such measures on the part of 
the Russian leadership, French General Jean Cot, commander of 
the UN contingent in Yugoslavia, has acted improperly at the 
very least. On two counts, moreover. 
  Evidently the intention was to station the Russians in the 
Sarajevo region, where additional forces are now required -- and 
at the moment when the NATO ultimatum deadline is about to 
expire. That is, were NATO to carry out its threatened air 
strikes on Bosnian Serb positions, Russian soldiers would be 
required to suffer the disastrous consequences of the punitive 
bombing. But, first, the decision on bombing raids was taken by 
NATO without prior consultation with Russia and, what is more, 
Moscow was told that NATO "has no intention of being preached 
to." Second, France, Britain, and the United States have done 
everything they can to prevent the convening of the Security 
Council -- as Russia has proposed -- for the adoption of a 
special decision on the threats to bomb Bosnia. Therefore the 
Russian Defense and Foreign Ministries have quite justifiably 
forbidden the command of the Russian battalion to carry out the 
redeployment order. Evidently there is still serious talking to 
be done with our Western partners over future cooperation in 
peacekeeping operations. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. newspapers have reported that the Clinton 
administration indicated Tuesday that it will agree to a 
compromise that does not go as far as NATO's demand for the 
Bosnian Serbs' guns to be withdrawn from Sarajevo or placed 
under UN control by the end of the week. In the opinion of U.S. 
officials, some heavy artillery can stay on the hills above the 
Bosnian capital. However, the United States will insist on 
guarantees that these guns will not be fired. 
  According to reports from the Serbian part of Sarajevo, 
competitions have been held on Jahorina Hill in honor of the 
10th anniversary of the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. Thus, the 
Bosnian Serbs have demonstrated their respect for the 
International Olympic Committee's call for a truce during the 
Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Georgiy Pelisov: "The Metamorphosis </F>
of the United Nations"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- The world public is alarmed by the 
tragedy in Sarajevo. U.S. President Bill Clinton is angry, UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is indignant, and NATO is poised 
to put warplanes into the air. The real culprit has not been 
found but it is planned to punish the Serbs just as a warning, 
as it were. 
  You can understand the world public, and Bill Clinton, and 
Butrus-Ghali. The death of completely innocent people is, of 
course, an outrage and demands retribution, but only against 
those who are guilty of this crime against humanity. But we 
Russians cannot understand why the world public was not 
indignant at the tragedy in Russia 3-4 October 1993 when, 
according to the official figures, 145 people died and hundreds 
were injured during the firing on the House of the Soviets (the 
"White House"). The people responsible for this action, which 
was just as inhuman and criminal as the one in Sarajevo, have 
not been brought to justice even though the whole world knows 
who they are. Furthermore, they have received not only Russia's 
highest awards but also the applause of statesmen who imagine 
themselves the guardians of democracy. 
  One cannot help but notice the more than strange 
metamorphosis of the United Nations. Instead of performing a 
peacemaking, unifying function, it is being transformed right 
before our eyes into some kind of world policeman ready to 
punish and actually punishing not so much those who commit acts 
against peace and humanitarian principles but primarily those 
who have displeased the forces lobbying at UN headquarters. As 
evidence let us recall the bombing of Libya and the residential 
center of Baghdad and the military actions against opposition 
forces in Somalia undertaken under the international 
organization's flag by U.S. Army subunits. Decisions to carry 
out these and similar unlawful actions are most often made 
administratively without discussion by or the sanction of the 
Security Council. That is what the United Nations has done this 
time too. 
  There is another strange element in UN activity which can 
hardly be left without assessment. It is the fact that 
countries or, to be more accurate, the political forces which 
dominate them and which for the sake of their own ambitions are 
prepared to shed the blood of other peoples and even their own 
fellow countrymen and are actually doing so are going 
unpunished. Israel systematically bombs South Lebanon -- and 
the United Nations does not even wag a threatening finger. 
Neither the world public nor the United Nations was disturbed 
when Turkey, a member of the United Nations and NATO, wiped the 
Kurdish town of Lice from the face of the earth in the space of 
a few hours on 22 October 1993. 
  It is quite well known how much mental energy, how many 
diplomatic efforts, and how much money the United Nations 
expended to enable the Jews scattered throughout the world at 
last to acquire their own statehood. But the United Nations is 
totally incapable of forcing Israel to respect the Palestinians' 
right to their own state. Nor is this organization particularly 
concerned about the fate of the Kurdish people, numbering almost 
40 million -- the world's first farmers -- whose culture goes 
back many thousands of years. The Kurds' land is divided among 
Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. The Kurds' desire to reunite and 
form their own state according to the law and the provisions of 
the UN Charter is viewed as a manifestation of terrorism and 
separatism and is being suppressed most harshly with the tacit 
connivance of the United Nations. 
  The impression is being created that the United Nations is 
moving away from its initially proclaimed principles of being an 
impartial world arbiter toward being the instrument of the 
policy of a group of countries headed by the United States. 
Whereas in the past the ambitious tendencies of that group and 
the United States were countered by the USSR and the socialist 
countries, now that counterbalance has been removed and scope 
for unlimited domination of the world has opened up before those 
who were used to such sway until 1945. The colonial system 
collapsed after the victory over fascism but it seems that 
neocolonialism is being reborn on a new basis under the blue 
flag of the United Nations and with the assistance of its army 
of "blue helmets."

<F P=106> [Correspondent Vladimir Bolshakov report: "Before Something </F>
Irreparable Happens.... Are Western Democrats Really Capable of 
Stooping to Crimes Against Humanity? French General Pierre 
Gallois Asks"] 
  [Text] Paris, 16 Feb -- These days official France is 
somewhat reminiscent of a hypnotized person. Domestic policy 
has been put on the back burner. All thoughts and discussions 
in both the ruling right-wing parties and the opposition are 
associated with Bosnia, or to be precise the NATO ultimatum to 
the Serbs. It seems that everything revolves around this. This 
situation involuntarily prompts many people to reflect on the 
situation's preprogrammed nature. 
  First of all, people here are pondering whether the NATO 
ultimatum is itself in France's national interests, and likewise 
Paris' entire policy in Bosnia and the way it forms a bloc 
against the Serbs exclusively with the Muslim side or more 
rarely with the Croatian side. 
  Second, alarm is also being aroused by Washington's attempts 
to supplant the United Nations with the NATO bloc and with its 
help to mete out punishment to the world's peoples in the name 
of a "new world order." 
  Third, every day there are more and more press items 
questioning the official version of the mortar attack on the 
market in Sarajevo. 
  General Pierre M. Gallois, the eminent French strategist, 
shares his thoughts with PRAVDA readers: 
  "NATO is now completely subordinate to the United States. 
The Atlantic alliance's military organization has become a most 
powerful instrument in establishing a `new world order.' It is 
meant to punish and does not take the trouble to find out 
exactly who is really guilty. 
  "That was the case in June 1993, when the United States 
decided to 'punish' Iraq for 'attempting to assassinate 
President Bush.' B. Clinton sent cruise missiles to Baghdad even 
before the Iraqis' guilt had been proved. It was only later 
that the U.S. press admitted that there had been no attempt on 
Bush's life. But dozens of completely innocent people's lives 
had already been sacrificed to U.S. democracy. 
  "Washington and NATO Secretary General Woerner, a German, 
have just issued an ultimatum to the Serbs in order to punish 
them for the bloody massacre in Sarajevo, of which they are 
accusing only the Serbs. Without even waiting for the results 
of an investigation by a special commission. 
  "Something similar also occurred in Bosnia 27 May 1992, when 
the Serbs were accused of gunning down a peaceful bread line in 
Sarajevo. The Serbs were not guilty of this, but the 
investigating commission concealed the facts, including the fact 
that most of the people killed in this line were Serbs. 
  "Nevertheless, at the time this incident served as grounds 
to 
impose economic sanctions, as a result of which thousands of 
peaceful Serbian inhabitants who were just as completely 
innocent as those killed in that bread line suffered. 
  "What happened in the market in Markala is also strange in 
terms of both its presentation to the public and consequences. 
Just a single round from a mortar -- a rather inaccurate weapon 
-- could not, if fired from Serb positions, have hit a 
40-by-30-meter [m] target the first time. Nobody could have 
seen a mortar shell in flight, as certain 'witnesses' claimed. 
Alas, all they could have seen was the result of the explosion, 
not the mortar shell itself. Finally, the haste with which 
Western powers hurried to adopt sanctions against the Serbs 
without even having convened a commission of investigation looks 
highly suspicious. It is no less suspicious than the adoption 
of sanctions after the events of 27 May 1992. The Serbs were 
not responsible for that crime, as was later proved. 
  "What does this conspiracy mean? Surely Western 
governments did not deliberately hurry to make fools of 
themselves? Or is the German mark so strong and the desire for 
oil so overwhelming that because of this Western democracies are 
capable of stooping to crimes against humanity? In addition, 
they have started using unworthy methods of warfare: shooting 
at their own troops and accusing the enemy of this, so that it 
is condemned by the public for doing this." 
  In his own way Admiral Jacques Lanxade, French Armed Forces 
chief of staff, supplements Gen. Gallois' analysis. Speaking at 
a seminar in Munich, he said that in Bosnia it is impermissible 
to adopt any one side in such a complex conflict. "I also do 
not believe," he said, "that we can declare war on any one of 
the sides." Disagreeing with "simple solutions," the admiral 
spoke out against, in particular, calls for a unilateral lifting 
of the arms embargo in favor of the Bosnian Muslims. He noted 
that most of the 18 French soldiers killed and 300 wounded in 
Bosnia have died at the hands of Muslims and not Serbs. But 
these facts are being carefully concealed, and the press 
practically kept quiet about Adm. Lanxade's speech; only 
L'HUMANITE risked quoting it. 
  Material sent to PRAVDA's Paris office from Switzerland 
notes 
that, according to an analysis by certain military specialists, 
what was used at the market in Markala was not a mortar shell 
but a new type of antipersonnel ball-bearing mine developed at 
the "Slavko Rodic" Bosnian military plant in the city of Bugojno 
and taken into the Bosnian Muslim army's arsenal. This mine 
contains up to 5,000 steel balls 4-5 mm in diameter and has a 
casualty radius of 60-80 m. The nature of the effect on people 
and buildings confirms this. Especially as not a single mortar 
shell in the Yugoslav Army arsenal could have had this effect. 
  Another curious detail: The market in Markala is mainly 
Serbian and Croatian; it is practically not visited by Muslims. 
Even on the newsreel it could be observed that those killed at 
the market were buried in a Christian cemetery with crosses and 
not in a Muslim cemetery. Hence the Swiss authors conclude that 
this was a repetition of the provocation against Serbs based on 
the method of 27 May 1992. 
  There is a good Russian proverb: "Look before you leap." 
Russia, in the name of its historical friendship with Serbs and 
its common fate with them, must resolutely advise the world 
community to act according to this very principle in Bosnia. 
Before something irreparable happens in the Balkans. Before 
hundreds if not thousands of innocent people are killed. After 
all, the conflagration of a world war has erupted there twice 
already. A third must not be allowed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Vladimir Malyshev and </F>
Georgiy Shmelev] 
  [Text] Athens, 17 Feb -- Since the Russian Federation is a 
permanent member of the Security Council, Russia and the United 
Nations have nothing in common with NATO's ultimatum to the 
Bosnian Serbs, since they took no part in the adoption of that 
decision. This was stated by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev to an ITAR-TASS correspondent upon his arrival today in 
Athens. Russia, A. Kozyrev confirmed, is a permanent member of 
the Security Council, and the United Nations cannot make such a 
decision without us. 
  According to the minister, he has the impression that "we 
were not, at any rate, fully informed about the content of the 
NATO decision." "But we will not allow ourselves, no matter how 
much anyone might try, to be deflected from our chosen course 
toward a strategic partnership, about which there was a 
conversation quite recently between the presidents of Russia and 
the United States in Moscow, or to be deterred from the efforts 
that Russia has been making for the past 2-3 weeks in order to 
promote its initiative in Bosnia. The initiative, A. Kozyrev 
indicated, is aimed at strengthening the security zones, 
including, above all, the security zone in Sarajevo, and the 
withdrawal of the sides' armed formations and heavy weapons. 
  Vitaliy Churkin, who is now the Russian President's special 
representative, the Russian minister continued, is personally in 
the conflict zone and is conducting intricate talks. In the 
minister's opinion, it is necessary to follow most attentively 
the course of these talks and to listen to the news coming from 
there, since it is precisely at these talks that the question of 
lifting the siege of Sarajevo and removing armaments is really 
being tackled. 
  Speaking about relations between Russia and the Republic of 
Macedonia, the minister declared that Russia was ready, in 
principle, to make its good offices available to both states -- 
Greece and the Republic of Macedonia -- so as to help them find 
mutually acceptable solutions to the problems of relations 
between them.

  [Text] Athens February 17 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev arrived on Thursday night [17 February] to 
Athens, the first point of his eight-day tour. Upon arrival, he 
immediately met his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel to discuss 
preparations for the Russian president's visit to Germany 
scheduled for this coming spring, as well as a settlement of the 
Bosnian conflict. 
  The Bosnian settlement and relations with the European Union 
(EU) are to be in the focus of the upcoming political 
consultations between Kozyrev and the so-called EC "Troika" 
consisting of the foreign ministers of Belgium, Greece and 
Germany -- the former, present and future EC chairs. The Athens 
meeting is initiated by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. 
  The programme of Kozyrev's visit also provides for a meeting 
with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, talks on bilateral 
Russian- Greek relations and a meeting with the Cyprian foreign 
minister. 
  After visiting Greece, the Russian foreign minister is to 
make a tour of East European states entering the so-called 
Visegrad group. 
  The first country to be visited is the Czech Republic where 
Kozyrev is expected to continue a diologue on various aspects of 
Russia's relations with these countries and to look into the 
progress of implementation of the earlier signed agreements. 
The sides will also exchange opinions on the current situation 
in Europe, specifically on problems of conflict settlements, 
above all in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and on a new structure of 
European security. 
  While in Krakow, Poland, Kozyrev is to attend a 
Russian-Polish conference on cooperation, "Partnership Under New 
Conditions".

  [Text] Moscow February 17 ITAR-TASS -- In closing his 
official visit to Russia the British prime-minister, Mr John 
Major said, "We have been considering for some time the 
possibility of the queen visiting Russia. Her Majesty is keen 
to do it and I believe it is a very good idea. The Russians 
have now had democratic elections and have a democratically 
elected president. Now seems an appropriate time to proceed. 
It may happen as early as this autumn but final details are not 
yet arranged." 
  Asked what Britain hoped to achieve with the visit by the 
queen, Major replied: "The relationship between the United 
Kingdom and Russia has been getting closer over some time. I 
think that will set the seal on the much closer relationship we 
now have." he added that it will be "the first visit for a very 
long time, it may even be the first visit ever." 
  In response to a question about whether the queen will be 
seeing more than Moscow, Major said, "It is not yet clear how 
much she will see but I would think certainly more than Moscow. 
She is keen to make this visit." 
  "Her Majesty is one of the finest ambassadors the United 
Kingdom has ever had. I think from that point of view it is 
highly desirable that she should visit Russia," John Major said.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy article: "Optimism and Caution Voiced </F>
During John Major's Visit to Moscow"] 
  [Text] Statements by Russian and British leaders indicate 
that relations between the two countries are on the up and are 
cause for satisfaction on both sides. This primarily applies to 
the economy and trade. Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin 
pointed out during a meeting with his British counterpart John 
Major, who is paying an official visit to our country, that 
according to last year's results Britain was third in Western 
trade with Russia. Neither side intends to rest on its laurels. 
During the British delegation's visit to Moscow they discussed 
plans to step up cooperation in the field of fuel and energy and 
communications, as well as in education, science, and culture. 
  Such an important avenue of our cooperation as British 
firms' 
involvement in implementing the privatization program in Russia 
will be "inspected" by John Major in Nizhniy Novgorod, which he 
is to visit after Moscow 16 February. It is there that the 
practical aid that British capital has afforded the oblast 
administration's efforts is most palpable. 
  The day before in Moscow's Kremlin a symbolic line was drawn 
under the period of hostility between our states, a period which 
for several years now has effectively been at an end. The 
Russian president and Britain's prime minister signed a joint 
statement on nontargeting of their strategic nuclear weapons 
against one another. During the delegations' talks in the 
Kremlin it was also pointed out that military cooperation 
between our states gratifies the two countries' leaders. 
However, as far as developing this cooperation is concerned, 
the sides have at the moment confined themselves to a fairly 
cautious "agreement in principle" that Russian and British Army 
subunits should hold a series of joint exercises from early 1995 
on both Russian and British territory. 
  The politicians were also cautious in their statements on 
the 
military-political aspects of our relations during a meeting at 
the Russian Defense Ministry in the afternoon of 15 February. 
Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev received 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. In the opinion of 
Russia's defense minister, it was noted at this meeting that the 
"Partnership for Peace" principle proposed by NATO is a good, 
attractive principle. However, when talk turns to putting this 
into practice, it is obvious that the concrete programs for 
implementing this partnership are currently at the development 
stage. 
  John Major voiced a fairly optimistic opinion of the results 
of his discussion of the Bosnian crisis with Russia's leaders, 
noting the Russian-British (in this case also read NATO) mutual 
understanding "on many important aspects of a settlement to the 
conflict." President Yeltsin was more restrained in his 
opinions, saying that "some people are trying to resolve the 
Bosnian question without Russia's involvement. We will not 
allow that." It is easy to guess that the NATO 
military-political leadership is the unnamed "some people." 
Evidently one of the aims of John Major's visit was to try to 
win Russia over to NATO positions, secure its consent to the 
planned troop operation in Sarajevo, and thus invite Russia to 
take part in that resolution of the Bosnian conflict. However, 
both President Yeltsin and Premier Chernomyrdin clearly told the 
British premier that Russia has its own view of how the conflict 
should be resolved, namely that peace can only be secured in 
Bosnia via negotiation. 
  On the whole the British premier's visit to Russia clearly 
showed that Britain and Russia are profoundly committed to 
developing a mutually beneficial partnership and establishing 
the kind of relations that may indeed become partnership 
relations in the near future, as Boris Yeltsin suggested during 
his visit to London.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Vorontsov] </F>
  [Text] Berlin, 17 Feb -- The press center of the Western 
Group of Forces [WGF] has denied rumors appearing in the German 
press to the effect that, after the Russian troops withdraw, 
some of the ammunition belonging to them may remain in Germany. 
  Citing information from the Mixed Russian-German Commission, 
the WGF press center said today that, over the past three years, 
580,400 tonnes of ammunition belonging to the WGF has been 
removed from German territory, and a further 81,040 tonnes were 
used up during that time during military training. As of 1 
January this year, 15,560tonnes of ammunition remains in the 
possession of the WGF, which tallies with the envisaged plan. 
  Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, co-chairman of the Russian 
section of the Mixed Commission and WGF commander in chief, 
assured the German side back in mid-January that, by the time 
the troop withdrawal is complete, the remaining ammunition would 
be fully removed from German territory. 
  The WGF press center also rejected speculation over the 
norms 
for the expenditure of ammunition on military training. Each 
army has its own military training methods, so that comparing 
ammunition expenditure norms for these purposes in different 
armies would be inappropriate. 
  In the current treaties, the intensity and military training 
methods of the Russian troops who are still on German territory 
are not under discussion. They are exclusively an internal 
matter for the WGF command, a press center announcement says.

  [Text] Moscow (DDP/ADN) -- Klaus Naumann, chief of general 
staff of the Bundeswehr, believes cooperation between the German 
and Russian military is vital. Both countries play "a major, if 
not decisive role" in the creation of a European security 
system, Naumann said in an interview with (the Friday edition 
of) the Moscow army newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. Naumann does not 
rule out the joint deployment of German and Russian peace troops 
in UN missions. 
  Naumann voices the view that blame should not be apportioned 
to one side only in the conflict in Bosnia. He hopes all the 
warring parties will comply with the NATO ultimatum. 
  Naumann has been on a four-day visit to Russia this week, 
during which he met Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.

of the first generating set at Chernobyl Atomic Electric 
Station. The causes of the activation of the automatic device 
are being investigated. The first generating set, however, 
continues to work at the 450-MW load. The station's third 
generating set is only working at 50 percent of its capacity due 
to the suspension of nuclear fuel deliveries from Russia.

  [Text] Kiev--Oleksiy Sheberstov, first deputy minister of 
power engineering and electrification, reported at a news 
conference at the Ministry of Power Engineering and 
Electrification of Ukraine on 17 February that the situation 
taking shape at Ukraine's electric power stations is that the 
amount of fuel is ample for two or three days only. Last night 
the Tripolye station was put out of operation; a question has 
been raised about discontinuing the operation of the last unit 
at the Zaporozhye GRES [state district electric power station]; 
43 tons of coal are left at the Burshtyn station, which requires 
18,000 tons of coal per day. A similar situation is occuring at 
other stations. Oleksiy Sheberstov reported that if the stations 
are put out of operation completely, it would be virtually 
impossible to resume their work. 
  The main reasons for the critical situation which is 
happening at the electric power stations is the absence of coal 
and fuel oil. Only 100,000 tons of coal are being supplied, but 
the consumption need is 160,000 tons per day. There are ample 
quantities of fuel oil; however, the Ministry of Power 
Engineering and Electrification has no money to buy it, said 
Sheberstov. At the same time, it was pointed out that there are 
customers wishing to buy electric energy for Russian rubles, 
however, the "Law on currency regulation" allows the sale of 
electric energy for Ukrainian coupons only. 
  Dwelling on the process of setting up corporations and 
joint-stock companies within the industry, Sheberstov remarked 
that today this process is impossible to carry out without 
restructuring the industry, because Ukraine has a single 
centralized network. Therefore, the claims by Dnepropetrovsk, 
Lugansk, Donetsk, and Zaporozhye oblasts that the regional 
property, power transmission lines in particular, should be 
passed into their ownership are groundless. 
  Replying to the question whether the increase in tariffs for 
electric energy had positive consequences, Sheberstov said that 
"electric energy will not be saved until it is sold to domestic 
customers at a price which is lower than its current prime cost."

<F P=106> [All monetary amounts as received] </F>
  [Text] Kiev -- Ways to overcome the nonpayments crisis were 
discussed at the Ukraine Cabinet of Ministers sitting, held with 
the participation of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, First 
Deputy Chairman Vasyl Durdynets, and Acting Prime Minister 
Yukhym Zvyahilskyy on 17 February. 
  The data from the Economy Ministry reveals that the now 
regular nonpayments crisis in industry began in September 1993 
and the situation particularly exacerbated in December. As a 
result, production in December fell by 14 percent and the latest 
data shows it reached 43 percent in January 1994. The steps 
taken by the NBU [National Bank of Ukraine] and the government 
in January and February 1994 to combat the nonpayments crisis, 
such as extending stabilization credit to the amount of 5.4 
trillion karbovantsi and repayable financial assistance to the 
amount of 5.5 trillion karbovantsi, have so far not made the 
situation change for the better. 
  Economy Minister Roman Shpek announced at the Cabinet of 
Ministers sitting that various data pointed to the nonpayment by 
Ukrainian enterprises of 40 to 80 trillion karbovantsi, which 
caused industry to become uncontrollable. Roman Shpek demanded 
that the real causes of the nonpayments crisis should be 
established, thus making the secret become common knowledge. 
Both the plan and the budget, in the economy minister's view, 
should be revised. "Let us not pretend that the differences in 
the policies of the Economy Ministry, Finance Ministry, and the 
National Bank will somehow pass. Otherwise, no decisions will be 
taken." 
  Asked by the Ukrainian president whether the fall in 
inflation in January to 19 percent meant the government was 
winning, Roman Shpek answered in the positive but pointed out 
that this was "a victory over the people, pensioners, and the 
economy." The economy minister predicted that the consequence 
of this victory would be large emission which would push Ukraine 
"towards an unprepared monetary reform." 
  Before a speech by National Bank of Ukraine Chairman Viktor 
Yushchenko, a representative of PivdenMash [Southern Machine 
Building] production association said he could not understand 
how a situation was possible when "ministers cannot agree" and 
when the president should exercise strict control over the NBU. 
  In his speech, Viktor Yushchenko stressed that the 
nonpayments crisis "is not resolved by the amount of money 
available for enterprises but is a reflection of the economic 
crisis." Yushchenko's data shows that two to four trillion 
karbovantsi per month are at present not being exchanged for 
goods. As of 1 February alone, over 16 trillion karbovantsi in 
circulation "did not return." Viktor Yushchenko said there were 
different views on ways out of the crisis, rather than 
antagonism in relations between the National Bank, Finance 
Ministry, and Economy Ministry. Viktor Yushchenko called for 
consolidation in support of anti-inflation measures. Yushchenko 
added that "50 percent of price rises in May this year [as 
received] are the result of the emission that already is there." 
  Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy remarked 
that "all Yushchenko [National Bank of Ukraine chairman] is 
doing is inciting Ukraine and harming the policy of the Cabinet 
of Ministers." 
  Vice Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk also accused the NBU 
leadership of "subversive economic activities." Landyk spoke 
categorically against "flirting" with the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. 
  Finance Minister Heorhiy Pyatachenko stated that "we have 
successfully ruined the old financial system without having 
created a new one." Pyatachenko noted that credit resources 
were not being returned. The finance minister joined in the 
criticism of the National Bank and pointed out that the NBU "was 
not taking account of anyone's views." 
  Supreme Council of Ukraine [Budget &amp; Planning] Standing 
Committee Chairman Andriy Pecherov proposed to restrict "the 
influence of foreign economies." Pecherov spoke in favor of 
state regulation of the economy and called for "the introduction 
of an economic state of emergency." 
  The Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the 
leaders of which had been invited to this sitting, had on the 
previous day submitted for examination by the government its 
proposals regarding resolving the non-payments crisis. The 
Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is demanding 
in particular that an interbank offsetting of bills be 
conducted. In accordance with its results bankrupt enterprises 
will be determined, and it will be necessary to urgently begin 
clearing up [sanatsiya] inefficient enterprises with these 
bankrupt enterprises. 
  It is also proposed that the government appeals to Ukraine's 
Supreme Council, which will continue plenary sittings on 22 
February, so that the limit of primary emission for the first 
quarter of 1994 be confirmed at 50 trillion karbovantsi. The 
Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is also 
demanding that draft basic directions of monetary and credit 
policy in 1994 be submitted for examination by Ukraine's Supreme 
Council. The Cabinet of Ministers sitting continued after lunch.

  [Text] Kiev, 16 Feb--It was reported by the Defense 
Ministry's press center that a meeting took place between Army 
General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukrainian defense minister, and 
foreign states' ambassadors accredited to Ukraine. The defense 
minister stressed that Ukraine was a peaceful state, and the 
numerical strength of its Armed Forces would gradually decrease. 
Radetskyy added that Ukraine would actively take part in 
tackling European security issues. As for the conflict in the 
former Yugoslavia, he spoke in favor of its peaceful settlement. 
  On the subject of the Black Sea Fleet, the defense minister 
said Ukraine primarily needed to make an inventory of the Black 
Sea Fleet's property as of December 1991 [date as received]. 
This work could be done by an interstate commission with the 
participation of independent experts and observers. The next 
stage should be reducing the fleet's existing group of forces, 
which now is a burden both for Ukraine and Russia. Putting 
these measures into practice, in Radetskyy's view, will prompt 
what to do with the Black Sea Fleet in the long run. As for the 
main base of the Ukrainian Navy, it is and will be in Sevastopol.

  [Text] Moscow--In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN 
correspondent on 16 February, Yevgeniy Saburov, director of the 
Center for Informational and Social Technologies under the 
Russian Federation's Government--who intends to take up the 
performance of his duties as the Republic of the Crimea deputy 
prime minister [as received] in the very near future--said the 
principal aim of his activity at the new post, in his view, was 
to set up an effective economic mechanism that would make the 
life of the peninsula's population considerably easier. 
  "I will also seek to make the Crimea an open republic that 
will not secede from anyone. I am a man of well-considered 
views, and I think that politics must serve the people rather 
than making things difficult for them," Saburov said. 
  Under Ukrainian legislation, Saburov cannot be appointed to 
a 
state post because he is a Russian citizen. Answering a 
question from the UNIAN correspondent about his possibly 
obtaining Ukrainian citizenship, the Crimea's future deputy 
prime minister said he had not seen any relevant documents that 
would make it enforceable. This, in his words, is up to Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov, who proposed that he should form and 
lead the republican government. "I accepted his proposal, so the 
Crimean president--as a lawyer--must put it into practice. Of 
course, one can recall similar precedents in Estonia and Armenia 
where other states' citizens head government structures," 
Saburov noted. The wish of those concerned with their country, 
in his view, is to attract professionals to manage the economy. 
  On the subject of the Crimea's purely economic problems--in 
particular, introducing the parallel use of the Russian ruble 
and the Ukrainian karbovanets on the Crimean peninsula and the 
possible self-financing of this autonomous republic--Saburov 
added: "Telling representatives of the Russian mass media about 
agreeing with Kiev on the issue of the Crimea's `rublization', I 
quoted Yuriy Meshkov as saying this on his visit to Moscow. 
This step would be beneficial both to the Crimea and Ukraine. 
As for self-financing of the autonomy, this question is still 
to be studied. Everything depends on the taxation basis and 
budgetary regulation."

<F P=106> [Press Agency NOVYNY interview with Ukrainian Minister of </F>
Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko; place and date not 
given: "It Is Not Disarmament, But Stripping the State Bare"] 
  [Text] Being convinced that the tripartite agreement 
on the fate of Ukrainian strategic missiles that he signed 
conforms to the parliamentary decree on this issue, Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk asked the people's deputies to annul 
their reservations regarding Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol 
and to adopt a decision on Ukraine joining the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state. 
  This is how the Moscow statement was commented upon by Yuriy 
Kostenko, people's deputy, minister of environmental protection, 
and head of the special working group of deputies in charge of 
the preparation for ratifying START I and acquiring Ukraine's 
nonnuclear status. 
  [Kostenko] The Moscow tripartite statement has, in fact, 
offered an entirely different procedure for Ukraine's nuclear 
disarmament, a procedure different from what our Supreme Council 
decided on the issue. The new procedure does not take into 
account many aspects, associated both with Ukraine's national 
security and its economic interests. For this particular 
reason, the Moscow statement must be regarded as a totally 
different agreement and must be given a corresponding legal 
evaluation. 
  [NOVYNY] However, it is a statement and not an agreement. 
The parliament cannot ratify or refuse to ratify it. 
  [Kostenko] I realize this. The statement is formulated in 
such a manner as to make it impossible for the Supreme Council 
to consider it. These are so-called legal intrigues. However, 
one cannot overlook the fact that the supreme legislative body 
has adopted one procedure for nuclear disarmament and, at the 
same time, the executive power has proposed an entirely 
different one. That is why the Supreme Council, which has the 
right, ensured by the current Constitution, to discuss 
international agreements, also has the right to discuss this 
particular document and determine whether it is advantageous for 
Ukraine or, perhaps, it should be vetoed as being at variance 
with Ukraine's interests. Moreover, I want to stress the 
following point: The work conducted by the Supreme Council 
would, in my opinion, make it possible to more or less 
coordinate Ukraine's interests with those of other states that 
seek Ukraine's nonnuclear status. I do not see Ukraine's 
interests, either economic or military, in the Moscow document. 
Nor do I see there any security guarantees for Ukraine, 
guarantees about which there has been so much talk. 
  [NOVYNY] How would you comment upon the fact that neither 
the statement, nor the supplement to it makes any mention of 
compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons transferred to 
Russia? 
  [Kostenko] This once again emphasizes the fact that there 
exist certain discrepancies between what the Supreme Council 
adopted and what the president signed. The parliament's decree 
states clearly that there must also be compensation for the 
tactical nuclear weapons, whereas the Moscow statement does not 
deal with this issue separately. As far as I am concerned, 
Russia is just promising to consider this question and give some 
compensation. 
  [NOVYNY] Is there any deadline for giving Ukraine 
compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons? 
  [Kostenko] No, no deadline has been specified. Besides, 
this is difficult to do, because nobody knows at the expense of 
what this compensation must be made. If it is done from the 
money received for those 500 tonnes of highly enriched uranium 
that Russia will sell to the United States, compensation may 
only be given to Ukraine after the uranium is sold on the world 
market. Only after that will Russia receive some real money and 
be able to give some monetary compensation. Today, there are no 
funds, absolutely nothing. It is true that there also exists 
such a variant (it might be the most acceptable one for Ukraine) 
as compensation for the cost of every warhead. This could be 
done, because it is known how much uranium or plutonium they 
contain, and, therefore, the cost of the tactical weapons 
transferred by us might be determined. In accordance with 
preliminary estimates, it is more than $10 billion. If we 
proceed from this sum, Russia is indebted to Ukraine and not the 
other way round, as we are being assured today. Speaking about 
energy sources, in view of the fact that uranium and plutonium 
are extremely valuable energy sources, it might be possible to 
make an equivalent exchange: We can give them highly enriched 
uranium and plutonium and they can give us oil and gas. 
Unfortunately, however, this procedure was not adopted, 
moreover, during the negotiations, such an element as plutonium 
was totally "omitted." It is a very expensive element. By 
various estimates, 1 kg of highly enriched plutonium may cost up 
to $1 million and 1 kg of highly enriched uranium $100,000. 
Just imagine the cost of the materials that we have already 
transferred to Russia. 
  [NOVYNY] Transferred with tactical weapons? 
  [Kostenko] Yes, with tactical weapons alone, we transferred 
to Russia about 10 tonnes of highly enriched plutonium and about 
90 tonnes of highly enriched uranium. What happened in Moscow 
cannot be referred to as nuclear disarmament; it is the 
stripping of the state bare. Not only in military, but also in 
economic and political aspects. 
  [NOVYNY] The following information is known to have been 
leaked from presidential circles: If Ukraine had not agreed to 
concessions in Washington and in Boryspil, and then also in 
Moscow, it might have found itself in international political 
and economic isolation. What is your attitude to this? 
  [Kostenko] I cannot agree with this thesis, because it is 
not the availability of nuclear weapons that determines the 
possibility of international isolation, about which there is so 
much talk. Had it been so, all those states that presently 
create nuclear weapons would also have found themselves in 
isolation. Today, there are about 20 countries worldwide that 
either have their own nuclear weapons, or are about to create 
them. These are so-called threshold states, which are in 
violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Ukraine 
proceeds along the road toward nuclear disarmament, and, for 
that reason, it cannot constitute an obstacle to anyone. 
  That we do not, today, have effective economic ties with 
other countries points to one circumstance only -- the absence 
of reforms in Ukraine. We do not make a single step toward 
reforms, and as long as there are no reforms, industrial circles 
and financiers with large capital will not be interested in 
cooperating with Ukraine or in investing in its economy. That 
is why, if somebody says, today, that nuclear weapons have 
brought about Ukraine's international isolation, it will be an 
erroneous assessment of the situation that has taken shape. We 
will soon become convinced of this. Even after the entire 
disarmament strategy proposed by our president is implemented, 
investments will not flow into Ukraine all the same. They will 
nor flow as long as there are no real reforms. Incidentally, 
this was also stressed by Mr. Clinton, who said that Ukraine 
would only be given $175 million and the rest when economic 
reforms begin to be implemented.

Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. Instead, government sources report, 
a directorate on the coordination of administrative organs' 
activity led by Valeriy Pavlov, former first deputy state 
secretary, has been created. Simultaneously, a new position has 
been introduced in the Council of Ministers apparatus -- 
government secretary for national security, whose rank is close 
to that of ambassador at large. Appointed to this post has been 
the former state secretary, Gennadiy Danilov, whom observers in 
Minsk describe as one of the most influential people among those 
closest to the premier.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw </F>
Hryb by Aleh Hrudzilovich at the Dzyarzhynski kolkhoz on 12 
February: "Mechyslaw Hryb: `If We Do Not Restore Discipline 
and Order, We Will Get Nowhere'"] 
  [Text] As everybody knows, during his visit last 
Saturday [12 February] to the Dzyarzhynski kolkhoz in 
Dzyarzhynski rayon of Minsk Oblast, Supreme Soviet Chairman 
Mechyslaw Hryb outlined his program for political reforms. As a 
matter of fact, he repeated the same things he had said at a 
meeting with the staff of the Minsk pharmaceutical plant on the 
previous day. Also addressed at the meeting were today's most 
urgent problems. 
  "We have lost control over our Republic." With this sad 
remark, the chairman began his analysis of the current 
situation. He is convinced that the lack of control will be 
remedied when Belarus defines its political system (Belarus and 
Tajikistan are the only former republics of the USSR not to have 
done so yet), and the presidential office is instituted. 
Presidential elections could be held as early as June, and if 
the results are positive, the Supreme Soviet elections might be 
held another three months later. The president will form a 
government that will be approved by the new legislature. All 
these changes should be based on a new constitution and 
electoral law. As the chairman noted, the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium has already drafted such a law. Should the current 
Supreme Soviet be unable to adopt these documents, Mechyslaw 
Hryb does not rule out the possibility of holding a referendum. 
He is convinced that it is impossible to continue with the old 
Constitution. The local soviet elections should complete the 
political reforms in the spring of 1995. As the chairman 
emphasized, the advantages of this scheme are a consistency of 
reforms, no power vacuum during the various stages of the 
process, and eventually a strong vertical power structure. 
  Although his comments on the current problems were rather 
brief, they were quite specific. For example, Mechyslaw Hryb 
completely supports economic union with Russia and the 
unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, 
because he does not see any other possible way of saving our 
economy and agricultural sector, which are in worse shape than 
their equivalents to the east. He believes that the Supreme 
Soviet and its Presidium should not dodge urgent economic 
problems or pass the buck to the Cabinet of Ministers. 
Regarding relations with the government, Mechyslaw Hryb 
supports friendly cooperation, and believes that the 
confrontation "which has been seen lately," must be halted. 
  Following his meeting with the kolkhoz staff, the Supreme 
Soviet chairman answered the following questions from a 
NARODNAYA GAZETA reporter. 
  [Reporter] Yesterday, you discussed supplies of 
pharmaceuticals, and today you are dealing with agricultural 
problems. What results can the people expect from these "spot 
checks" by the new state leader? 
  [Hryb] It is very helpful to hear people speaking personally 
about their problems -- it is easier to find one's bearings and 
look for appropriate solutions. Regarding pharmaceuticals, I 
have come to the conclusion that it is better to define the 
groups of the most essential drugs, and concentrate our 
attention on them. Unless we concentrate on developing our 
pharmaceutical industry, drugs will be very expensive in 
Belarus, because we are still a far way from achieving Western 
standards of living. 
  [Reporter] Yesterday it was health care, today it is 
agriculture. There are, however, more problems. What, in your 
opinion, must be solved first and foremost? 
  [Hryb] I have already said -- we must define our political 
system, no matter which direction we orient ourselves -- West, 
East, South, or North. If we do not unite and restore 
discipline and order, we will get nowhere. Our people do not 
listen to anybody today. 
  [Reporter] When our paper is published on 15 February, 
strikers will be gathering in Independence Square, putting 
forward some very tough political demands. What would you like 
to tell them? 
  [Hryb] I have already explained that I am generally 
against strikes. I am for solving problems diplomatically. If 
you have problems, let us sit down at the negotiating table and 
look for solutions. Every strike is an attempt to forcibly 
affect the results of talks. Of course, everybody has the right 
to express their opinion, but what will a strike bring? I see 
the solution as lying in the economic union and unification of 
monetary systems. Will a political strike advance this? I doubt 
it. On the contrary, it will push us even further away from it. 
However, if the strike is held in accordance with the law, I 
will have no right to ban it.... 
  [Reporter] You do not rule out the possibility of 
sitting down at the negotiating table with the strikers? 
  [Hryb] No, I do not. There is only one "but".... We should 
respect one another. Nobody has yet called them criminals, as 
they are doing, for example, with regard to the government. 
Excuse me, but only a court is allowed to call someone a 
criminal. 
  [Reporter] The proposals for political reform that you 
voiced yesterday and today reflect the position of the Supreme 
Soviet Presidium. Was this position unequivocal, or were other 
opinions voiced? 
  [Hryb] The members of the Presidium were unequivocal, at 
least those who participated in the meeting. We decided that we 
should define our stance on all those issues -- the presidential 
and early legislative elections. We should not delay them any 
longer. We will try to convince the deputies to give us support. 
  [Reporter] There is an option of holding presidential 
elections at the Supreme Soviet, not in a nationwide ballot. 
What is your attitude toward this? 
  [Hryb] I know about this alternative, but I advocate 
nationwide elections. This, though, will depend on our decision 
on the political system. If we become a parliamentary republic, 
the president, as everybody knows, will have to be elected at a 
Supreme Soviet session -- there will be no sense in holding 
nationwide elections. Nevertheless, I am for a strong, 
democratically elected president, and I hope that the Supreme 
Soviet will support me on this. [end Hryb] 
  On the eve of the meeting with the kolkhoz workers and this 
interview, Mechyslaw Hryb was shown the working conditions of 
milkers and machine operators, and visited a kindergarten and 
high school in the village of Petkavichy.

<F P=106> [Statement by the press center of the Belarusian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Text] In spite of the fact that the Defense Ministry has 
repeatedly explained its position on the likely scenario of 
events that might take place on 15 February, political brouhaha 
and various kinds of speculation on this are continuing. 
Indeed, there is not a single stupid thing left which 
politically-minded journalists have not thought up by now. 
  The most vivid example of this is a commentary, featured in 
the "Krok" [Step] television program on 12 February 1994, on a 
visit by Defense Minister Colonel General Kozlovskiy with a 
military unit stationed in Maryina Gorka. The meeting of the 
minister with the personnel was blatantly and deliberately 
distorted and pitched to the audience as some kind of 
"instruction" to the unit on "how to combat strikers." 
  Meanwhile, the position of the Armed Forces at this 
difficult 
time remains constructive and clear: Stability and public 
accord are the precondition for successful reforms in our 
Republic and the bedrock for its well-being and prosperity. A 
systematic training process is under way in the Armed Forces 
now. Training events are to be conducted in subunits, units, 
and staffs in the immediate future, and thereafter. The Defense 
Ministry has no intention whatsoever of altering its combat 
training schedule to suit the current political situation. Let 
the politicians and journalists with too lively an imagination 
have their speculations on their own consciences. No one will 
manage to "bring the Army out of its barracks," out of the legal 
space prescribed to it by law which it occupies today. The 
Armed Forces have always been, and they will always be, the 
guarantor of public stability and security. 
  The dangerous virus of civil strifes and political feuds has 
not yet spread onto Belarusian territory. It is a strong 
conviction of the Defense Ministry that no one today, too, will 
manage to embroil the Belarusian people and their Armed Forces 
in political adventures!"

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Starikevich report: "Fixture Between the Strike </F>
Committee and the Government Postponed Until 22 February"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The events of 15 February showed that the 
workers' movement in the republic is not yet strong enough to 
dictate its will to the authorities or even to make them heed 
the opinion of the strike committees. The situation could 
change in the very near future, however, if the monetary systems 
of Russia and Belarus are not united. 
  The participants in the protest action handed demands for 
the 
government's resignation and for the holding of early 
parliamentary elections to Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw 
Hryb. The speaker was instructed to reply before 22 February. 
The next demonstration by strikers is scheduled for that day. 
But for the time being the strikers intend to utilize Polish 
experience and hold local strikes -- at two or three enterprises 
each day -- and to postpone mass measures until the said 
deadline expires. 
  Summing up the results of the first day of the strike, it is 
possible to point out that the government succeeded in keeping 
the situation under control thanks to simple measures: the 
payment of wages, the sending of potentially dangerous people on 
compulsory leave, etc. But the ground under its feet is 
becoming increasingly shaky. A social explosion could be 
provoked by any incident, even an insignificant one. It was no 
coincidence that the Supreme Council became hysterical over the 
recent increase in bread prices. The prime minister declared 
from the parliamentary rostrum at the time that the Council of 
Ministers had nothing to do with it and promised to reduce 
prices and to punish the guilty persons. It is hard to guess 
when and where "holes will appear" next time, and there is still 
a question mark over whether the government will have time to 
"stop up the holes." If the suspiciously delayed signing of the 
agreements on uniting the monetary systems does not take place 
or produce the desired results, then it is most likely that no 
additional grounds for the people to voice their displeasure 
will be required: Too many promissory notes for this economic 
miracle have been given out. 
  So far officials have made no comment at all on the first 
day 
of the strike. But their viewpoint on what is happening is 
already known. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich has called the 
strike a "loathsome step." He was, as usual, supported by the 
communists -- which shows once again who sits [zasedayet] in the 
government. The mass media controlled by the Council of 
Ministers have declared that the strike committees' action 
failed. But the government seems thereby to be trying to 
reassure primarily itself.

  [Text] Vladimir Hancharyk, chairman of the Council of the 
Belarusian Trade Union Federation, held a press conference today 
at the National Press Center. As is known, the Federation did 
not support the general political strike set for 15 February. 
Let us remind you that the question is open as the strike was 
postponed to 22 February -- the day when the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet will resume its session. The official trade unions, too, 
may join the strike movement. Explaining the position of 
Belarusian unions and, so to say, dotting all the i's and 
crossing all the t's, Vladimir Hancharyk, the Council chairman, 
commented on the current situation. 
  [Begin recording] [Hancharyk] The political strike did fail. 
That is a fact. But the fact also is that public discontent is 
extremely high. The reason why the strike has not taken place 
-- and we have repeatedly stressed this -- is that it was 
premature and poorly prepared. The main emphasis was put on 
spontaneous rallies rather than well organized ones. Generally 
speaking, the issue of strikes should be handled based on a good 
preparation, and not on reasoning. Let us hold up traffic, or 
something to this effect. This is especially conspicuous when we 
take a look at the strike participants. There were very few 
workers. Most of the strikers included intellectuals, students, 
and some of our activists. People avoid going to extremes. 
They are afraid to lose their jobs. This is why people decided 
to stay out of it. 
  [Announcer] To stabilize the social and economic situation 
of 
the Republic, the union Federation presented its demands. 
First, the Belarusian Supreme Soviet should call early 
legislative elections no later than this October. Second, the 
Cabinet of Ministers should urgently revamp and reconstruct the 
government during the ongoing session. Unless the above demands 
are not met, Hancharyk said the reaction of trade unions will be 
firm. 
  [Hancharyk] We have come to the conclusion that the 
Federation's position should be pretty tough. The clock will 
start ticking from 22 February, the session's first day of work 
after a break. The Federation's Presidium is to convene on 23 
February to determine our further actions. If the Supreme 
Soviet does not examine the above issue, we will have to cast a 
secret ballot, as provided by law, in our local organizations, 
followed by massive rallies in early March. But this time, 
these will be organized rallies. I am talking about a warning 
strike. According to the law, we have three hours. As for the 
laws, all of them have a distinct anti-union orientation. The 
issue of political strikes is still not settled in our country. 
So whether they want it or not, all protesters and strike 
organizers will violate the law. I would like to emphasize that 
what we did not like about the political strike is the very 
principle of resolving this issue. It boils down to the 
following [word indistinct]. The government should resign, while 
the Supreme Soviet sets a date for early elections and dissolves 
itself. 
  Following this plan, we would end up with a caretaker 
government, which is not legitimate, as a matter of fact. Of 
course, there are no guarantees that this process will unfold in 
a civilized way. 
  [Announcer] So, it is clear that the official trade unions 
are going to (?find a common language) with the government in 
the beginning of [words indistinct]. Asked about the political 
role of the Federation in Belarus, its chairman said the 
following. 
  [Hancharyk] We do not want to play any political role. Our 
Statute limits our political activities to participating in the 
elections. At present, however, it is impossible to solve 
economic problems in isolation with the political ones. 
Willy-nilly, trade unions cannot stay away from politics today.

  [Text] Alexander Tushinsky, First Deputy Defense Minister 
of Belarus, told Interfax Thursday [17 February] that he did not 
know what to do about the 13 SU-17 fighter planes that are the 
property of Iraq in Belarus. 
  Nearly three years ago when the USSR still existed the jets 
arrived in the city of Baranovichi for repairs. They could not 
be sent back because of the UN embargo that was imposed after 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
  Tushinsky said that they jets could be taken over by Russia 
when the former USSR's military hardware was divided between its 
republics but Russia did not want them.

  [Text] Two Azerbaijani warplanes, an Su-24 and an Su-25, 
entered Vardenisskiy Rayon at 1500 today. The first started to 
carry out a reconnaissance flight over Sodk [formerly Zod] and 
(Kurts). Overflying (Kurts), the second plane swerved toward the 
rayon center but had no time to bomb the city. It broke into 
pieces and fell in Vardenisskiy Rayon after being hit by a 
missile fired by the Armenian Republic's Air Defense Forces. 
The other plane quickly flew off. 
  The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service reported that 
the 
two pilots of the downed plane were captured. 
  While the neighboring republic expresses readiness to stop 
the military operations during the Olympic games, it also sends 
military airplanes to bomb our Republic's peaceful border 
settlements. 
  The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's [NKR] Air Defense Forces 
shot 
down another Azerbaijani Air Force plane today over the north of 
the Karabakh war front. Details of the case are not yet known. 
  According to reports received from the NKR Defense Army 
headquarters at 1700, the Karabakh units repulsed the attack 
launched by the Azerbaijani side against Agburun in Martuninskiy 
Rayon this morning. There was no report of casualty figures.

  [Text] The Armenian Armed Forces have maintained their 
attacks on Azerbaijan's positions in Kelbadzharskiy, Terterskiy, 
and Fizulinskiy Rayons without a halt during the past few days. 
The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry Press Service has revealed 
that the enemy attacks were rebuffed and the Armenian military 
units forced to retreat to their previous positions. 
  Reports from Azerbaijan's occupied areas said the Armenian 
military units are being forced to maintain their attacks 
regardless of the casualties they suffer. That's because they 
are being fired on by special obstructive units in the rear 
lines. Those units are made up of Armenians from Karabakh and 
other criminal elements. 
  The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry has informed a 
correspondent 
from [name indistinct] newspaper that the Azerbaijani National 
Army units killed 318 enemy troops, destroyed six tanks, and 
disabled seven armored vehicles and four trucks in their recent 
combat operations. 
  Reports say that 850 occupation units were urgently 
dispatched from Armenia to Azerbaijan's Karabakh region during 
the past two days. Most of them have not even had preliminary 
military training. 
  A wave of discontent and some disorderliness have been 
observed among the occupation units in Karabakh. A violent 
clash took place in Karmirgyukh between the occupation elements 
affiliated with two political parties in Armenia. Several of 
them were killed. Azerbaijan's defense units have reportedly 
approached the heights near Kelbadzhar that are held by the 
Armenian occupiers.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Zaur Kadymbekov report: "Cry for Help"] </F>
  [Text] Baku -- Representatives of 80 nationalities living 
in Azerbaijan -- Russians, Ukrainians, Lezghians, and 
Azerbaijanis -- including academics, peasants, workers, and 
people from the world of the arts, have sent a letter to UN 
Secretary General B. Butrus-Ghali. Their appeal reminds the 
international community and all well-disposed people of the need 
to expedite the withdrawal of Armenian troops from inhabited 
localities they seized earlier to a point beyond the sovereign 
state's borders. This step, in their opinion, could halt the 
six-year bloody conflict, save thousands of lives, and 
facilitate the start of peace talks. 
  The immediate reason for sending the message is the upcoming 
second anniversary of the Khodzhaly tragedy, a tragedy in which 
hundreds of peaceful inhabitants -- the children, women, and old 
men of this Azerbaijani village in Nagorno-Karabakh -- became 
victims of a barbaric act. 
  Subsequently, again outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh, 
another seven Azerbaijani rayons which are not disputed by the 
two sides were seized. Consequently, over one million people 
have become refugees on their own land. Their situation during 
these snowy winter days has deteriorated even further: Many are 
seeking shelter in cities of tents where cold and hunger are 
taking their toll. Their cry for help, the authors of the 
message to the UN secretary general believe, should also be 
heeded by world public opinion.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In the Republic of Georgia Cabinet </F>
of Ministers. The Aim: To Bring Georgia Out of the Crisis!"] 
  [Text] An extended session of the Republic of Georgia 
Cabinet of Ministers on 9 February was devoted to implementing 
an anticrisis program, outlining ways of reviving the economy, 
conducting a correct credit and monetary policy, strengthening 
the coupon's exchange rate, developing the private sector, and 
reviving the nation spiritually. 
  Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia delivered a report 
"on 
the Basic Results of the Functioning of the Economy in 1993 and 
on Immediate Tasks." The report delivered by Tamaz Chikvaidze, 
first deputy minister of the economy, was devoted to 
macroeconomic stability in the republic, an anticrisis program 
of systematic changes, and the first indicative plan for the 
country's socioeconomic development. This was then followed by 
a debate. 
  The speakers and the various participants in the debate, 
including ministers from various departments, the heads of 
institutes and large enterprises, rayon gamgebelis 
[administrative board chairmen], bank employees, and 
representatives from the private sector, pointed out that, in 
spite of the important measures that had been implemented in 
1993 to regulate and reform economic life in the Republic of 
Georgia, it had not been possible to activate factors aimed at 
stabilizing the economy or to reverse the trend toward a 
deepening of the crisis and the shortages of electricity and 
other resources. With the conditions of serious and, to a 
certain extent, chaotic economic processes currently prevailing, 
the effectiveness of laws and legislative acts that have already 
been adopted, as well as credit, monetary, taxation, and 
financial mechanisms, is extremely low. A significant part of 
the republic's economic potential has been excluded from 
economic life. 
  In terms of 1993 prices, the total GDP amounted to 1,878 
billion coupons, which is only 54 percent of that of the 
previous year. There was a reduction of 46.3 percent in gross 
national income, which fell to the level of 1964. 
  With the credit, monetary, and financial systems on the 
brink 
of almost total collapse, it was not possible last year to 
ratify the budget while the rate of devaluation of the temporary 
currency -- the coupon -- exceeded the most pessimistic 
forecasts and turned into hyperinflation. Along with objective 
factors that have deep roots, this state of affairs was due to 
the fact that it had not been possible to implement measures 
aimed at stabilizing the coupon's rate of exchange in time. 
  The speakers emphasized that one of the main reasons for 
inflation was the universal shortages on the consumer market. 
It was necessary, in a short period of time, to regulate the 
question of stocktaking in respect of all trade and implement 
measures aimed at saturating the consumer market with goods and 
services. 
  It is significant that all the speakers tried to give a 
thorough analysis of current processes in their individual 
sector and outline concrete proposals and measures aimed at 
extricating Georgia from the crisis. 
  A speech was delivered at the session by Eduard 
Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian parliament-head of 
state. 
  He said: "It is impossible to draw up a universal 
program. This program is the result of serious work carried out 
by many collectives over one year. At the moment, we are short 
of skills [kvalipikatsia] and experience. It is necessary for 
us to study together not only work but also new thinking. 
  "In the situation that has taken shape, we have to draw one 
most important conclusion: We should refrain from the sickly 
politicization of society as this will hurl us toward painful 
anarchy. 
  "As regards the program for bringing the country out of 
the crisis -- it makes no difference whether we call its 
variants pessimistic or optimistic, minimalist or maximalist -- 
the main thing is for us not to be skeptical, as there exist the 
preconditions for escaping from the crisis and positive shifts 
enabling us to begin an economic recovery. 
  "The main thing," said Eduard Shevardnadze, "is that 
Georgia avoids isolation and has the initial basis for 
extricating itself from the crisis. Emerging from its isolation 
will contribute to the restoration of economic ties. At the 
same time, we should not forget that the economy should be 
controlled." 
  Then, the head of state touched upon the development of 
the private sector: "It is necessary to open the way for 
businessmen and to help and support them, not brandish our 
swords at them. The state should be the instrument that manages 
the economy and struggles against chaos [stikiuroba]. We speak 
a lot about liberalization and do the opposite. Wages should 
increase along with prices. 
  "It is still not too late to halt the struggle for the 
Russian market. We should bring Georgian tea and Georgian wine 
onto the consumer market as quickly as possible; otherwise, if 
we delay, nothing will help this situation. Georgia has adopted 
the status of a developing country. This factor will contribute 
to the restoration of the economy but our country must tread 
this path quickly and within a short period of time. We should 
not be afraid of elements of planning being inserted into branch 
programs; all plans should work for the interests of the 
state. 
  Our relations with the IMF and the World Bank will open 
up new horizons and broad paths. We have to try to get the 
European Community to finance our programs. In order to do 
this, we have to acquire the reputation of a reliable partner. 
However, no single businessman or investor will come to Georgia 
until the country resembles a country and there is 
stability." 
  Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Eduard 
Shevardnadze touched upon the size of military expenditure. He 
said: "If necessary, we will give our right arms, but 
everything has to be legalized and decreed by the state; a 
military budget has to be determined that will maintain the 
army." 
  The head of state devoted significant attention to 
measures aimed at strengthening the coupon. "It was a mistake 
to introduce the coupon. Unless the economy is activated, it is 
impossible to strengthen it. It is probably necessary to have a 
parallel currency; otherwise what we have on the market today 
will also disappear. We cannot post a policeman at every stall. 
As for joining the ruble zone, the door is not yet open. There 
are many conditions that will have to be studied thoroughly. 
Working groups are being formed both in Georgia and Russia. We 
have to organize discussions on trade and hold debates." 
  Then, Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze spoke about the search 
for ways to overcome the electricity crisis. "Georgia is a 
country rich in hydroelectric resources and, therefore, this 
problem should be resolved in the shortest time. 
  "It is of great benefit to Georgia that Russia has 
agreed to supply us with gas. 
  "The delivery of gas from Turkmenistan is expensive. 
Therefore, this development will ease our financial 
situation. 
  "The use of non-traditional energy signifies 
inexhaustible sources for us. We should make the sun, wind, 
small hydroelectric power stations, and so forth serve the 
economy. It is possible that, with the help of UNESCO, Georgia 
will become one of the world centers for conducting this 
research." 
  He devoted a lot of attention to improving work on the 
railroads, highways, and waterways. 
  "The customs system, which represents an inexhaustible 
source of revenue for our budget, needs to be reorganized. 
  "In spite of the difficulties of our life, no one 
should forget that it is essential for us to save our culture 
and science. The entire nation should concern itself with 
this." 
  The extended session of the Cabinet of Ministers adopted the 
corresponding decrees on the questions discussed.

  [Text] Groznyy February 17 TASS -- The dead body of 
Georgia's former president Zviad Gamsakhurdia was air-lifted 
today from Western Georgia to the capital of the Chechen 
Republic in southern Russia. 
  The corpse was dug up from the grave made under a barn in a 
remote Georgian village of Djikhaskari, a member of the Chechen 
delegation who witnessed the exhumation told ITAR-TASS on 
Thursday. 
  In conformity with the will of the late president's family, 
the exhumation was atttended only by official representatives 
from Georgia, Lithuania, and the russian regions of Chechnya and 
Ingushetia. No autopsy was made and the commission limited 
itself to "strictly visual" identification. 
  Later the body was transfered to the Georgian town of Senaki 
where it was identified by three Georgian medical scientists. 
  Gamsakhurdia will be eventually reburied in Groznyy 
according 
to the will of his next of kin. The former Georgian president 
spent the bigger part of his political exile in Russia's 
break-away Republic of Chechnya after he was toppled in January 
1992. 
  Last autumn, he returned to western Georgia in a bid to 
restore his presidential status, but his supporters were ousted 
from Georgia by the army loyal to the existing Tbilisi 
government of Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  Gamsakhurdia then reportedly took his life after being 
cornered by his enemies in a west Georgian village.

  [Text] Kishinev, 17 Feb TASS -- Today President Mircea 
Snegur issued a decree giving the inhabitants of the Dniester's 
left bank regions and the town of Bendery the right to vote up 
to a week early in Moldova's forthcoming parliamentary 
elections. This has been done in view of the boycott of the 
elections announced by the Dniester authorities. 
  To prevent the opening of polling stations, a special 
situation was introduced there by a decree of Igor Smirnov, the 
Dnestr Region leader. Armed posts were placed in some populated 
areas and on bridges across the Dniester. People engaging in 
the election campaign are being detained. The Moldovan 
leadership fears that on the election day - 27 February - the 
population of the left bank regions will be afraid to cross the 
Dniester and come to the polling stations opened on the right 
bank. Therefore, under Mircea Snegur's decree, the citizens of 
the Dniester Region will be allowed to vote during the week 
beginning 21 February.

  [Text] Chisinau February 17 TASS--Igor Smirnov, leader of 
the Dniester region, has described as constructive the 
recommendations of the CSCE mission in Moldova on a peaceful 
settlement of the Dniester conflict. The mission is suggesting 
the division of authority between Chisinau and Tiraspol along 
with the preservation of the territorial integrity of Moldova. 
The Dniester region will be given the right to 
self-determination, if Moldova wishes to form a single state 
with Romania. 
  According to a statement of the Dniester leader, circulated 
today, Smirnov had a meeting with the CSCE mission in Tiraspol 
and asked its representatives to be mediators and guarantors at 
talks with the Moldovan leaders on a peaceful settlement of the 
conflict. The Tiraspol leader told representatives of the 
European conference that elections to the Moldovan parliament 
would not be held in the Dniester region, since the problem of 
granting a special legal status to the region has not yet been 
settled. 
  However, the authorities will not create obstacles for those 
who want to take part in the voting on the right-bank part of 
the Moldovan territory. Smirnov said he was ready to meet 
Moldovan leaders and hold talks with them on a peaceful 
settlement of the conflict.

  [Text] The parliamentary state defense commission thinks 
that the Defense Ministry must be advised to demand that the 
Israeli TAAS Israeli Industries Limited firm should remove the 
unusable weapons and ammunition which it had recently sent to 
Estonia from the territory of Estonia at its own expense. This 
is based on certificates of inspection issued by the defense 
forces headquarters on 1 and 16 February. The Riigikogu state 
defense commission cannot accept the defective weapons which 
arrived as part of the arms deal, as a gift to the Republic of 
Estonia. This is what a statement says, signed by both Rein 
Helme, chairman of the Riigikogu state defense commission, and 
his deputy Peeter Lorents. The statement was released after the 
commission's closed sitting today. The sitting heard 
explanations from Foreign Minister Juri Luik, Defense Minister 
Indrek Kannik, and Defense Forces Commander Aleksandr Einseln 
and discussed assessments made by experts at the defense forces' 
headquarters. State Secretary Ulo Kaevats had provided his 
explanations in writing. 
  The Estonian Government concluded an arms deal with TAAS 
Israeli Industries Ltd on 7 January of last year and the 
Riigikogu ratified it on 15 December. According to the 
agreement, the TAAS firm pledges to sell to Estonia various 
defense products and services. The arms deal contract 
stipulates that the Israeli TAAS firm guarantees the reliability 
of the products and effectiveness of materials. The total arms 
deal amounts to over 49 million U.S. dollars, over 680 million 
Estonian kroons, and Estonia is to pay this amount in (?eight) 
installments.

  [Text] Ashgabat February 14 TASS -- President of 
Turkmenistan Saparmurad Niyazov has resumed his duties after 
undergoing a successful operation in the United States. On 
Monday [14 February] he chaired a Cabinet of Ministers meeting, 
which was, appropriately, mainly devoted to health care problems. 
  Referring to the famous saying that "every cloud has a 
silver 
lining", the president stressed the importance of his stay in 
the U.S. in terms of establishing further contacts, especially 
in the field of medicine. According to Niyazov, that would help 
Turkmenistan soon begin implementing its health care programme. 
The current level of medical services is poor and makes such a 
programme necessary. 
  The Turkmenistan president, who had an operation done on his 
legs, was able achieve agreement on the establishment jointly 
with American specialists of a clinical centre of health care in 
Ashgabat.

  [Text] Jurmala, February 17 (TASS) -- The expected signing 
of the first treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops from 
Latvia has not taken place. Not a single of the four agreements 
under discussion has been signed at the Latvian-Russian talks 
which ended in Jurmala today. The next round of talks is 
scheduled for February 28. 
  Commenting on the results of the talks, Martins Virsis, head 
of the Latvian delegation, said that the two sides did not agree 
in views on three issues: The size of rent for the radio 
location station in Skrunda, the number of its personnel and the 
status of military pensioners. 
  Head of the Russian delegation Sergey Zotov noted that he 
was 
satisfied with the assurances given by Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs today that Latvia does not intend to restrict rights of 
military pensioners. 
  According to Russian Ambassador to Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh 
"the difficulties which arose at the talks, account for the 
complex internal political situation in Latvia. Failure to sign 
the treaty is disadvantageous for both sides, but much more for 
Latvia as it would be better if the radar worked within the 
framework of an agreement but not without it".

  [Text] Riga, Feb 17, BNS -- Latvia does not target 
isolation of Russia by setting sights on integration into 
Europe, Saeima (parliament) Chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs told 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd Wednesday [16 February]. 
  On the contrary, Latvia endorses Russia's participation in 
various European institutions to manifest its understanding of 
partnership and responsibility for the current processes, said 
Gorbunovs. 
  The anticipated citizenship law should provide a gradual 
growth of the body of citizens, said the Saeima speaker. If 
naturalization of non-citizens is too swift, the motion will 
bring on a great political counterreaction by ethnic Latvians. 
  Hurd noted that political instability could also be provoked 
by a vague status of a large group of population. 
  Gorbunovs agreed that the status of people who are not 
entitled for immediate naturalization should be politically and 
economically balanced. 
  As reported, Hurd met Wednesday with the Baltic foreign 
ministers and high-ranking Latvian officials.

  [Text] Riga, Feb 17, BNS -- BNS interviewed the Latvian 
ambassador to Russia, Janis Peters, on the atmosphere in Russia 
in view of relations with Latvia. 
  Q. Are Russian residents interested in the interstate talks 
between Latvia and Russia? 
  A. I have always said that Russia thinks about Latvia far 
less than Latvia (thinks) about Russia. We here (in Moscow) 
sometimes think that it is time for Russia to consider Latvian 
developments. I think, Latvian developments occupy a tiny 
proportion in Russia's consciousness. But, if we speak about 
the official Moscow, about the Russian Government, I think, that 
it is topical for Russia to settle relations with Latvia. The 
political forces in power missed in elections the moment of 
patriotism. I mean Russia's Choice. They had the chance, but 
they underestimated it and, consequently, the theme of 
patriotism was stolen from them by powers represented by 
Zhirinovskiy. (...) Now, many, including the foreign minister 
and many other political forces, moderate forces, democratic 
forces, are trying to outrun Zhirinovskiy but they cannot afford 
to use Zhirinovskiy's lexicon. The common Russian, the tired 
Russian, the humiliated Russian is forced to side with extremist 
views, with extremist slogans at least to set himself at ease. 
The Russian Government, in this case, faces a very serious 
challenge, including what regards relations with Latvia. That's 
why we can observe this very fierce attack on the Latvian 
legislation, the Latvian reality. Consequently, I think, that it 
is also important for Russia to settle relations with Latvia in 
the eyes of the international community. But Russia itself 
lacks a real understanding and concept as to what is, in fact, 
going on in Latvia. I think, they (Russian leaders) sometimes 
have not the time to go deep into Latvian processes. 
  Q. How much significance does Russia attach to the 
speculation by certain political forces with human rights 
problems in Latvia? 
  A. It is important but, what is interesting, the Russian 
propaganda speaks about the alleged human right infringements in 
Latvia in a very generalizing and abstract manner. In fact, no 
concrete cases are being cited. We watched a television 
broadcast, Voskresenije, last Sunday [13 February], in which the 
topics were highly invented. We must require Russia to name 
concrete cases, a list of human rights violations, then we will 
be able to answer. Presently, I think, the influence is not 
great, but it is so only on the one hand. On the other hand, 
all political forces in Russia regret the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. Even very democratically disposed people (are among 
them) because the dream about a good union still lives and is, 
maybe, haunting almost every Russian resident. These people 
would allot the Baltics the role of some kind of an associated 
member (in the dream union). The thought that the Baltics are 
on the Russian soil is alive in their (Russian people) 
consciousness. This makes it difficult to estimate the 
influence of these allegations but they are unlikely to 
seriously endanger Latvia. 
  Q. How to explain similar attitudes of Russian political 
forces? 
  A. The democratic forces would like to form a new union. 
You know the processes connected with the setup of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. Boris Yeltsin openly 
declared that Russia had a specific mission and task to create 
the CIS, that Russia is the number one amid equals. We perceive 
it with concern. We, being a small country, can criticize and 
reject the idea but for Russians a great power means something 
positive, a good life for everybody, an integrated economy. We 
should take this into account that in the world there are 
different unions, disintegrated unions, existing unions and it 
is nothing censurable. But this concrete model, a union with 
the enormous Russia, would not work, history has proved it. Too 
different are the numerical characters of the nations, the 
traditions, the economic showings, development and 
infrastructures. We think this is evidently incompatible but 
many Russians think it could work. It may turn into a kind of 
historic polemics. God save it from turning into a war. We 
should thank late Academician Andrei Sakharov, may he rest at 
peace, for his great contribution to the development of 
democracy in the former Soviet Union. But even he did not 
forsee in his constitution of European and Asian nations the 
collapse of the Union. What he had was a sweet illusion about a 
splendid union. This sweet illusion apparently lives in the 
minds of Russians and we have to prove them that we can live as 
an independent country. Russians do not believe in it yet 
because they have been brought up differently. I think, that, 
frankly speaking, Latvians also do not fully believe in it.

  [Text] The recent scandal in the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) group in the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian 
parliament, was a put-up job, the party leadership said. 
  LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and two members of the 
party's State Duma group, Viktor Kobelev and Aleksandr 
Vengerovskiy, told reporters on Thursday that Wednesday's stated 
resignation of Kobelev from the LDP group in the lower house had 
been a stratagem to reveal "dissenters" within the party and 
security services' machinations. 
  "We have never made it a secret that intelligence services, 
including the Russian ones, are taking systematic steps against 
the LDP and other patriotic parties," said Vengerovskiy, deputy 
speaker of the State Duma. 
  He said that, aware of intelligence services' plans to 
"split" the LDP at its next congress, scheduled for April 2, 
1994, the party leadership had resorted to a ploy "to reveal the 
possible sources of a split, all the people [that might cause 
it] and their contacts." 
  Zhirinovsky said that now "everything was OK." in the party 
and its parliamentary group, while "some of the intelligence 
services will receive no bonus payments for February." 
  Kobelev said he had "minor ideological disagreements" with 
Zhirinovskiy, taking a "milder position" than the party leader. 
As "the number-two person in the party," he would be meeting 
Zhirinovskiy more often now, he said. 
  Zhirinovskiy said the maneuver had made it possible to 
expose 
"secret agents" in the central bodies of the party, and in its 
regional organizations in Krasnoyarsk territory, St. Petersburg 
and Vologda. As a result, some of the party's senior officers 
in the LDP, whose total membership he puts at 120,000-150,000, 
were fired, he said. 
  He said that, following the party's victory at the 
parliamentary election, which came as a surprise to the whole 
world, "the intelligence services of all countries are concerned 
about the activities of the party" and demand information about 
it.

  [Text] Leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, confirmed in an interview on 
Thursday that he would go to a 3-day visit to Turkey on February 
18. According to him, he has been invited by some Turkish 
business companies and the Turkish newspaper SABBATH. 
  The LDP leader also announced that he had quite a number of 
invitations from abroad, for instance, from Czech Republic, 
Slovakia and Poland. However, he planned to pay most of his 
attention to visits to Russian constituencies. 
  Commenting on the refusal of the Spanish government to give 
him the entry visa, the LDP leader pointed out that the 
government had violated human rights. He repeated that he was 
to go to Spain under an invitation from the Spanish TV which had 
intended to interview him on television. 
  According to Zhirinovskiy, the move of the Spanish 
government 
was due to its "pro-American" position. Zhirinovskiy said that 
U.S. President Bill Clinton had wanted to meet the LDP leader 
during his visit to Moscow. However, the invitation was not in 
conformity with the appropriate order and was sent not 
personally to Zhirinovskiy but to the whole party. That is why 
just a rank-and-file LDP member went to the reception. 
  Zhirinovskiy said that the information that the U.S. 
President had expressed no desire to meet him was 
"misinformation" and that he had been waited for in the U.S. 
embassy. According to the LDP leader, the person who did not 
register the invitation to the reception in the appropriate 
order was punished. 
  Zhirinovskiy also announced that British Prime Minister John 
Major had met one of the LDP leaders, the State Duma's Vice 
Speaker, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, during his recent visit to 
Moscow. Aleksandr Vengerovskiy added that he would meet U.S. 
ambassador Thomas Pickering on the very day.

<F P=106> [Article by Azer Mursaliyev: "Bombs Dropped on Sarajevo </F>
Could Explode in the Kremlin"] 
  [Text] The NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs expires on 
the night of 20-21 February. Unless the Serbian armed 
formations' siege of Sarajevo is lifted, NATO aircraft already 
assembled in the combat zone will deliver the first strikes 
against Serbian positions at 0100 on 21 February. 
  The paradox is that the Sarajevo events will affect Bosnia 
least of all. They will have repercussions far beyond the 
confines of the former Yugoslavia, like the shot that was fired 
in that same city 80 years ago, in fact. Air strikes on Bosnia 
are unlikely to lead to the swift establishment of peace or to a 
change in the military balance in the region. In fact, they are 
more likely to provoke a further escalation of the conflict and 
intensify the militarist mood in the Serbian community. 
  But irrespective of whether the bombing takes place or not, 
the ultimatum has already dealt a mighty blow to the authority 
of Yeltsin and the westernizing wing of the Russian 
establishment within the country. Bombs dropped in the vicinity 
of Sarajevo could well blow up the Kremlin. 
  In this connection it is curious that the chief opponent of 
Russian foreign policy at the moment, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who 
probably stands to reap all the political benefits after 21 
February, is unexpectedly off to...Turkey on 18 February. At 
any rate, The Turkish Embassy in Moscow has issued him and 15 
members of his cohorts with visas. V. Zhirinovskiy intends to 
spend four days in the country, which figures strongly in his 
geopolitical designs. That is, V. Zhirinovskiy will be in the 
enemy's lair (Ankara is known to be a most consistent and active 
advocate of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs' positions) 
when the ultimatum expires. 
  What is this: an attempt to gain more than the maximum 
number of points, or a tactical diversion to screen an imminent 
attack on Yeltsin?

"Rutskoy `Presidential Party' Being Created? 
`Travkinites-Motorists' May Bury the Democratic Party of 
Russia"] 
  [Text] Valeriy Khomyakov, chairman of the board of the 
Democratic Party of Russia [DPR] (Travkin's party), who handed 
in his resignation the other day, has stated that one reason for 
such a step had been some sort of "economic" differences with 
Travkinites who have seats in the Duma. Asked for by regional 
party activists, Valeriy Khomyakov gave the names of Democratic 
Party of Russia men in the Duma who had voted for perks for 
deputies: Six members of the party, including Stanislav 
Govorukhin, voted for the provision of chauffeured cars for all 
deputies, something "even the Supreme Soviet did not venture to 
do." 
  According to his lights, during the party congress on 19 
February, Nikolay Travkin intends to alter the organization's 
structure and to distribute all key party positions among the 
"motorists" [avtolyubiteli] -- members of the parliament 
faction. Such shakeups at the party "top," Valeriy Khomyakov 
thinks, may result in that the relatively numerous regional 
structure of the Democratic Party of Russia would "crumble," and 
in such an event there is no knowing if the party would last 
until the next elections. 
  A certain part of the Democratic Party of Russia, in Mr. 
Khomyakov's words, is already turning to "Shakhray's party," 
another to "Gaydar's union." 
  As for Valeriy Khomyakov, he still ranks himself among 
Democratic Party of Russia members. He admitted, however, to 
already "having been offered to work together" with the "New 
Alliance" movement, now being created, which gambles on support 
from Aleksandr Rutskoy as future president. Nikolay Travkin's 
loyal comrade in arms, however, is deterred by the fact that, 
with the exception of Valeriy Zorkin, Aleksandr Tsipko, and Oleg 
Rumyantsev, "there are no outstanding leaders." Besides, 
Khomyakov, "an experienced party builder," is positive that "it 
would take several tens of billions of rubles just to get 
Rutskoy going," and the organizers have no other choice but to 
hope that "Aleksandr Tsipko of the Gorbachev Fund may not have 
joined the alliance for nothing, and that he has some commission 
from Mikhail Sergeyevich."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Sorokin] </F>
  [Text] Kazan February 18 TASS -- "The treaty between Russia 
and Tatarstan is getting nationwide support in our republic," 
Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev told a press conference 
here on Thursday evening. 
  Shaymiyev said he was receiving numerous telegrams and phone 
calls from representatives of Tatar diasporas in various regions 
of Russia and in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
They note that the Tatar population there was faced with 
certain problems and had definite fears, which have now been 
dispelled. At the same time, the Tatar president said he was 
disturbed by the fact that "feeble voices", as he put it, have 
appeared in the Russian State Duma and in Tatarstan, protesting 
against the treaty. Such people, in his opinion, are coming out 
not only against this historical document, but also against the 
peoples of Russia and Tatarstan. 
  Replying to those who demand self-isolation, President 
Shaymiyev said: "Sovereignty means self-restriction. It is not 
without reason that the former members of the Soviet Union, 
which have gained sovereignty, are now voluntarily restricting 
it and asking to be admitted to the CIS. Objective factors call 
for economic and political integration. The main task is to 
safeguard civil peace and tranquility in the republic and to 
concentrate all the available forces on construction. The first 
action will be to actively take part in the repeated elections 
to the Russian parliament, which will be held in Tatarstan on 
March 13. [no closing quotation marks as received]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 18 TASS -- Russian Nationalities 
Minister Sergey Shakhray welcomed the treaty signed by Russia 
with its self-style Republic of Tatarstan saying that it "ends a 
dangerous political crisis and the threat of an interethnic 
conflict" between Russians and Tatars. 
  Shakhray tried to dispell fears of conservative lawmakers 
that the treaty may ruin the federative structure of the country 
and is an infringement on its territorial intergrity. 
  The fact that Tatarstan had agreed to hold new parliamentary 
elections to the Russian parliament "is the recognition of the 
Russian sovereignty on the territory of the Republic of 
Tatarstan, as well as that Russian laws are acting there", he 
told lawmakers on Friday adding that "accusations of separatism 
against Tatarstan had also been lifted". 
  December 12 elections in Tatarstan failed mostly because of 
the opposition of its leadership to them. However, Russia and 
Tatarstan then reached a compromise that the federation agrees 
to sign a bilateral treaty with its republic, on which the 
latter insisted, while Tatarstan's leadership would hold new 
elections to the parliament. 
  The signing of the treaty became possible after the sides 
dropped their political and national ambitions and switched to 
concrete agreements to settle the disputes, according to 
Shakhray. It turned out that "it is possible to evade political 
tensions at negotiations", Shakhray said. The treaty does not 
raise the status of Tatarstan, he added. 
  "Relations by agreements (between Russia and Tatarstan) is a 
mechanism of self-tuning of the Russian Federation, while 
federation for Russia is a way of democratic organisation of 
society which is the only possible way of the development of the 
multi-national people of Russia without a crisis", Shakhray 
stressed.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Gavrilenko commentary under the "Postscript: </F>
Events and Commentaries" rubric: "Kazan Has `United' With 
Moscow Once Again, This Time on the Basis of Two Constitutions 
and the Treaty on the Demarcation of Areas of Responsibility and 
Powers"] 
  [Text] It is three years since Tatarstan declared its 
sovereignty. The whole period since then has been dominated by 
a single fundamental question: "Is Tatarstan part of Russia or 
not?" And all that time Kazan has issued one and the same 
answer, albeit with variations: The question of leaving or 
entering the Federation is not under discussion. Mintimer 
Shaymiyev, president of the Republic of Tatarstan, has expended 
considerable effort and time trying to explain to worried 
Russians that this is a question not of the republic's flight 
from the Russian Federation but of a change in its status and a 
precise demarcation of spheres of responsibility and influence. 
But within Russia. 
  Tatarstan's aspiration was somewhat hard to understand in 
Russia. Distrust gave way to suspicion, which in turn led to a 
desire to sort things out.... This slow-moving crisis in 
relations between Kazan and Moscow with uncertain prospects in 
the future forced the Russian Federation leadership to decide do 
something. Then came the failure of the second all-Russia 
referendum in Tatarstan and the elections to the Federal 
Assembly. And the realization dawned that it would be easier 
and more beneficial to negotiate with Kazan. 
  Now the treaty "On the Demarcation of Areas of 
Responsibility 
and the Mutual Delegation of Powers Between Organs of State 
Power in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan" 
has been signed. Of course, Kazan had to pay a price for the 
signing of this treaty. For example, the renunciation of the 
words "sovereign state" and "subject of international law." 
This also affected taxes: It had to abandon its former desire 
for a single-channel system and accept the general federal 
scheme. The important thing for us is that questions of defense 
remain in Russia's control. 
  When speaking about the treaty, Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin stressed that it "enshrines the really existing unity of 
the Russian state." And that is the main thing now. Tatarstan 
President Mintimer Shaymiyev declared in his turn that the 
treaty "affirms a new model of relations founded on the 
principles of law and justice." And he echoed Boris Yeltsin's 
words: "The treaty meets the urgent need to preserve integrity 
and stability in the Russian Federation." I am bound to recall 
the words of Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation minister for 
national and regional policy: "The object of the treaty," he 
said, "is not the special status of Tatarstan but the sphere of 
legal regulation...." And he added: "Regional policy will be 
developed on such principles as the equality of the components 
of the Russian Federation and the unity of the economic area." 
In other words, the minister was letting it be known that "the 
process has begun." Who is next in line? In all probability it 
will be Chechnya, where life in a state of legal chaos is 
becoming increasingly intolerable both for Chechnya itself and 
for Russia.

  [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS--Restrictions on the access 
of journalists to the government session on February 3 
objectively infringed on the right of citizens to obtaining 
reliable and prompt information. This conclusion was drawn 
today at its first session by the information judicial chamber, 
which examined an appeal of the guild of parliamentary 
journalists. 
  Valentin Sergeyev, head of the government press service, 
gave 
explanations on the incident. He said it had taken place when 
he had not been there, and the cause of the incident was some 
technical complications, connected with the moving of the 
Cabinet of Ministers to the "White House". 
  Commenting on the resolution of the judicial chamber, its 
Deputy Chairman Igor Yeremin said that "one should not dramatize 
the situation and present an individual fact as a trend." At 
the same time, the chamber's resolution suggested that the legal 
status, rights and duties of press services of state bodies, as 
well as matters related to the accreditation of journalists, 
should be clearly reflected in the legislation.

<F P=106> ["M.A." report: "Milan" Owner Buys Our Channel Five"] </F>
  [Text] It has been announced in St. Petersburg that 
beginning in April evening prime time on Channel Five will be 
handed over to its Italian partners, who are ready to fill that 
time with their own films and programs. No details have been 
reported so far. There are every grounds to think, however, 
that St. Petersburg television is rapidly being taken over by an 
international information tycoon, one of the richest Italians -- 
Silvio Berlusconi, who was one of the first to have launched his 
commercial television network in Europe. Berlusconi's 
representatives have spent the past two years working on 
Petersburg chiefs starting with Mayor Sobchak. They seem to 
have succeeded by finishing before other rivals who are eager to 
get the Neva [St. Petersburg] airwaves. Incidentally, the 
tycoon also owns the "Milan" soccer club. Does this mean they 
are not going to say anything good about "Spartak" on Channel 
Five?

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 17 February broadcasts the "Details" 
current affairs program introduced by Sergey Dorenko. Todays 
program was devoted to media relations with the Russian 
Government and State Duma and carried interviews with Duma 
opposition personalities, including Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
Georgiy Zyuganov, and Aleksandr Nevzorov. 
  Dorenko begins the program by suggesting that the present 
government was nostalgic for a previous age when it could 
maintain strict secrecy around its work. He then reports from 
the day's session of the Information Judicial Chamber under the 
Russian Federation president, over which Anatoliy Vengerov was 
presiding. The video shows the chamber at work. 
  Dorenko says that journalists attending the session had 
attacked the government for refusing media access to cabinet 
meetings two weeks previously. He then remarks that Vengerov 
had shown pro-government leanings at the actual session. 
Dorenko says that Vengerov had "twice thanked government 
representatives for attending, and said that the press had 
complaints to make, then corrected himself and said that they 
were not complaints, but requests." 
  Dorenko then interviews Vengerov. When he suggests that the 
public was being kept in the dark about government business, 
Vengerov replies that official statements were released after 
every cabinet meeting. 
  Returning to his commentary, Dorenko says that the 
government 
has defended its decision to bar access to journalists on the 
grounds that there was not sufficient space to accommodate them 
at the meetings. "Picture if you will, tens of thousands of 
journalists at a cabinet meeting. Truly a monstrous sight. It 
seems that it is not possible to find any bigger premises." 
  "The whole joke of it is," he continues, "that you will get 
to learn of everything anyway, only you will have to get your 
information from the government's enemies, among others." He 
goes on to say that the reason for the government's secrecy is 
that: "The government is busy with specific business. It is 
portioning out your quite specific money and is accounting for 
it not to you, but to the president." 
  The video then switches to Dorenko in the State Duma lobby, 
where he remarks that, in contrast to the government, the Duma 
is seeking as much media exposure as possible because it is 
suffering from an "orphan complex." He says that the anti-media 
sentiments of the last Russian parliament, which had "frequently 
attempted to do away with" the liberal Soviet-era press law, had 
continued into the Duma. A succession of opposition politicians 
then comment on the media: 
  Vladimir Marychev, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia says: "The attitude of the Duma to the press is quite 
simple. That is to say, that all deputies are united in saying 
that where the press is concerned, the deputies have no chance 
of the truth being told." 
  Communist Faction leader Gennadiy Zyuganov says: "It is 
perfectly clear that a qualitatively new weapon is being used to 
destroy and tear at our power: It is called the information 
manipulation of public awareness." 
  Independent Deputy Aleksandr Nevzorov says: "To be perfectly 
frank, I believe that there is nothing more filthy than the 
so-called Russian press, and that this press has, for a long 
time now, been waging a deliberate war against all directions of 
authority and its own people. An information war for which 
there is no reason and which is doing its utmost to befoul 
practically everything. It is criminal to entrust any press 
whatsoever with covering the activities of parliament." 
  Dorenko then quotes Zhirinovskiy as having written in "his 
book" that journalists were "lonely, unfortunate people." Then 
Zhirinovskiy is shown being interviewed: "I am the leader of the 
party that won the elections. On the lists, we won on the 12 
December. Therefore, journalists should be asking me about what 
I think of the president's helpers. But here the opposite is 
the case. Journalists ask the president's helpers what they 
think of the parties." 
  Then Duma Deputy Anatoliy Dolgopolov, dressed in 
Cossack-type regalia, complains that the press had reported that 
deputies had "multimillion salaries," "reserved cars," and 
"Bahamas lifestyles." Marychev then complains that media 
attention is focussed on a handful of deputies such as "Vladimir 
Volfovich, Gaydar, and Chubays." 
  Oleg Mironov, a Communist faction deputy, is then 
interviewed. He, too, complains that "the work of the Duma is 
reduced to Zhirinovskiy and talk about this or that privilege." 
When the female interviewer points out that Zhirinovskiy 
constantly insulted people, he replies: "We are not talking 
about hiding anything, but a lot depends on the dosage." 
  Dorenko then remarks that many deputies saw the only 
solution 
to the coverage problem in live broadcasting of parliament. 
Nevzorov is again interviewed. After referring to the "filth" 
being put out by the press, he says that he is himself a "great 
expert in the area of humiliating and destroying the body of 
deputies. I see my own methods being used, albeit in an 
unprofessional way. At least we used to do it with a sense of 
humor." He then concludes: "This Duma is, of course, doomed. 
There is no relay and the journalists cannot be trusted." 
  The video then switches to Zyuganov again: "Information and 
television are now not the fourth estate, but the first, second, 
third, and fourth, and a well-produced program directed against 
the law or something else prevents all the other estates from 
working properly. If we pass a law and the same evening a nice 
commentator appears and begins to pad it out, then believe you 
me, nobody in the country will obey that law." 
  Dorenko says that the Duma had adopted a law that day 
instructing the state media to cover its work in weekly reports 
in "Vesti," "Novosti," and "Details." Dorenko says that this 
instruction is worthless because no mechanism has been 
introduced to monitor the content of TV programs, and disarray 
among Duma deputies meant that it would be difficult to create 
such a mechanism. 
  He further points out that the Duma has no authority to 
issue 
instructions to the "Details" program as it was an independent 
production. Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Duma's Media 
Committee, is then interviewed. 
  Poltoranin says: "This does not mean that you are going to 
get phone calls saying: Look here, Sergey, you are shooting 
such-and-such a thing today -- well, you will have to drop it. 
Nothing of the sort. All we mean is that where, for example, 
we are debating the criminal codex or economic problems, we will 
say to you: Listen, Seresha, there is an interesting topic being 
worked on in the committees at the moment. It is important for 
the fight against corruption, the fight against crime, it is 
important for everyone, and we would like people to know what is 
being done about it in the highest corridors of power. Then you 
will say: Right, we will take a look. Who is dealing with it? 
Then we will just tell you who to see and you go ahead and 
judge for yourself." 
  Dorenko concludes by saying that there was nothing more 
frightening for his program than "endearments from the 
authorities."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS commentator Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS--It is no secret that two 
years of vigorous effort at economic reform have resulted in 
sharp erosion of the living standards in Russia, decrease of the 
birthrate and increase of the death rate. The stratification of 
society into the very rich and very poor has become more 
pronounced. The middle class, the reliable support for liberal 
transformations in any country, is virtually non-existent in 
Russia. Because of all this the government has come to realise 
the objective fact that it has no longer a social base for 
application of the "shock therapy" to the economy. 
  The basic principle that is expected to be announced at an 
enlarged meeting of the cabinet next weekend will most probably 
be "the priority of social policy during a stage-by-stage 
stabilisation of production". Sources close to the prime 
minister say that Viktor Chernomyrdin bears in mind these top 
priorities when speaking about the need to continue the reform 
in "non-monetarist ways". 
  It is yet hard to say if these priorities will become the 
lever by which the prime minister will be able radically to 
improve the economic situation. Going by statistics for 1993 
compiled by the Russian State Statistical Committee, the 
situation is extremely precarious in just these two aspects. 
Thus, after two years of reform, Gross Domestic Product dropped 
in 1993 by 29 per cent compared to 1991. The volume of 
industrial output declined by 31.3 per cent. Real monetary 
incomes of the population dropped by 43 per cent since 1991. 
Consumer prices rose 245 times. Almost 40 million of Russians 
or 26.7 per cent of the population, have the living standards 
below the poverty line. Over two years, unemployment rate grew 
13.5 times. 
  The basic goals of the government's social policy for 1994 
are defined in a lengthy report compiled by the Russian Ministry 
of Labour. The government proceeds from the premise that an 
effective and balanced social policy is the necessary condition 
for the continuation of reform, consolidation of its social 
basis and improvement of the social political situation. This 
is proclaimed in the report of the Labour Ministry, it was 
learned from informed sources. The main objective of the 
government's social policy for 1994 will be the stabilisation of 
the living standards in Russia with its subsequent rise as the 
economy stabilises. Experts believe this wording can justify 
the drawn-out expectation of economic and social results of the 
reform. Proceeding from modest financial opportunities of the 
state budget, the government will most probably concentrate on 
preventing the fall of real monetary incomes of the population 
by improving the ratio between the minimum wage and the living 
wage, on reforming the health, education and housing systems and 
on the impact of the state on the population's employment and 
stepped-up work for personnel retraining.

  [Text] Moscow, February 18 (TASS) -- Russian power plants 
are living through hard times: They experience a severe 
shortage of fuel. Power plant managers are unable to settle 
accounts with suppliers due to a shortage of funds, high prices 
for coal, gas and mazout as well as neck-breaking tariffs for 
their transportation. 
  Especially hard hit are power plants in the Russian Far 
East, 
Sakhalin Island and the Kamchatka peninsula as well as in 
Karelia and the Arkhangelsk region where fuel supplies were 
drastically cut. 
  Electric power plants in the Far East daily received 46,000 
tons of coal this month, instead of planned 66,000 tons. As a 
result, fuel stocks at the plants dwindled down nearly by a 
third. 
  A paradoxical situation has developed: While warehouses of 
siberian suppliers are overstocked with fuel, power stations 
experience shortages. But non-payment by electricity consumers 
prevent stations from paying for fuel. 
  The Russian Joint Stock Society of Energy and Electification 
alone owes over 1,200 billion roubles. Incidentally, the figure 
is constantly growing. A chain reaction has emerged, as it 
were: tower plants owe money to coal miners and oilmen. In 
turn, they are in debt to railwaymen and machine-builders. 
  Several railways sharply cut coal deliveries due to 
non-payments. Many specialists see the way out of the present 
situation in switching to payment of transport tariffs by power 
plants themselves through mutual settlements. 
  If the situation with fuel supplies to power stations does 
not change in the near future, consumers, especially in the Far 
East and north-west, will inevitably experience further cuts in 
heat and electricity supplies. 
  To avoid such a situation, it is necessary to boost coal and 
mazout supplies by the end of February and in March.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Mikhail Maley, head of defense </F>
industry conversion, by Laure Mandeville in Moscow; date not 
given: "The Alarmism of the Military-Industrial Complex"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- "I give the government between three and 
five months to solve the present crisis. No longer than that, 
or we will lose control of the country." For Mikhail Maley, a 
former member of the military-industrial complex who was Boris 
Yeltsin's adviser before supervising the conversion of the 
defense industry for the Russian Security Council, the 
composition of the new government does not give rise to 
optimism: "The new team has no notion of the country which it 
is supposed to govern. It is acting accordingly." Yet Mikhail 
Maley was a fierce opponent of Yegor Gaydar's monetary 
stabilization policy. But he admits that the former government 
"at least had the advantage of basing itself on an idea, one 
which was certainly wrong but which was real." 
  All the signs of an imminent disaster exist, he warned: 
"Agriculture no longer has fertilizer or fuel. Unless we take 
emergency measures, the sowing will not take place in time." 
"In the railroads, I predict a crisis in the spring. There 
will be nothing to pay the salaries..." The crisis in the 
energy sector is such that Mikhail Maley fears that the 
electricity cuts might spread, because the power stations have 
not been paid for their services and have no more money for 
their energy suppliers. 
  Unemployment also worries the Russian official: "The next 
set of graduates and students will not find work. They have 
hitherto found jobs in commerce, in the criminal world. But 
every niche is occupied... In the current atmosphere of damaged 
pride, lack of heating and electricity, the demonstrators will 
not just be angry grandmothers..." 
<H5>  Last Asset </H5>
  The West is mistaken therefore in abandoning Boris Yeltsin 
at 
the very moment when the situation is becoming really critical: 
"You forget that we are still a big nuclear power, even if we 
have become an economic pygmy. We must have access to the 
international arms market. Otherwise, we will no longer be able 
to respect the rules set by a well-fed and self-important West. 
We are being strangled." 
  Only the military-industrial complex can still save the 
country from the crisis, he concluded. With its 6 million men 
and its network of enterprises capable of producing almost any 
goods, "it is the only organized force which remains in Russia, 
the country's last asset." 
  Judging from what he says, President Yeltsin is beginning to 
understand the importance of the issue and supported the defense 
industry's plans in the last two meetings of the Security 
Council. But he is still too "disorientated" to really commit 
himself. "Boris Nikolayevich feels he has chosen the wrong model 
of reform, but he is still reluctant to change it," Mikhail 
Maley suggested. 
  The president may not fully share the certainties of his 
former adviser on the role of "magic potion" which the defense 
complex could play. Indeed, it is far from being monolithic. 
It is seriously affected by the crisis. 
  The defense industry sector has not been spared by the 
problem of mounting debts. It is suffering the effects of 
government nonpayment amounting to $1.5 billion. IZEVESTIYA 
this week devoted the front page of its edition to the explosive 
situation in the military enterprises in Siberia. According to 
the Russian daily, the Krasmash misile factory has not been paid 
by the state for the 11.3 billion rubles worth of orders it 
supplied in 1993, and it has not been able to pay any salaries 
for four months. The angry workers are furious and marched on 
the residence of the region's governor to demand their due. The 
governor had to flee to Moscow where he was promised money. 
"But the money has still not arrived and there is no more 
work," IZVESTIYA reports.

<F P=106> [Ivan Ivanyuk report under "Postscript. Events and </F>
Commentaries" rubric: "There Is No 1994 Budget Yet. Problems 
With Financing Army and Navy Apparently Remain"] 
  [Text] Colonel General Vasiliy Vorobyev, chief of the 
Russian Federation Defense Ministry Military Budget and 
Financing Main Directorate, spoke yesterday at a press 
conference organized by the Russian Federation Defense Ministry 
Information and Press Directorate. He talked about the problems 
of providing financial support for the Russian Army, which have 
still not become any less acute. 
  Thus only 65 percent of the Defense Ministry's financial 
expenditure needs last year were met, which constantly led to 
delays in paying pay and allowances and wages in the Army and 
Navy. As of 1 January 1994 the Defense Ministry owed 2.2 
trillion rubles [R] to suppliers of weapons, equipment, 
property, supply items, and other goods and services. 
  It was noted at the press conference that this debt was 
partly cleared by the Russian Finance Ministry this February -- 
settlements with the national economy, including defense sectors 
of industry, are already being made from the R1 trillion 
deposited in Defense Ministry accounts. 
  But by all accounts the resources allocated are insufficient 
to remove even the most acute questions from the agenda. One of 
them is the financing of capital and housing construction. 
Because of the lack of appropriations for these purposes it was 
made virtually impossible to fulfill the 1993 tasks under the 
state program to provide servicemen with housing. Of the 61,700 
apartments planned for commissioning via federal budget 
resources, only 50,000 or 81 percent of the plan were 
commissioned. The Defense Ministry is trying to solve its 
financial problems by selling released property. Last year 
1,600 apartments were acquired by this means. 
  At the same time it is clear that the Armed Forces cannot 
function normally without stable, full-blooded financing. But 
studies on the 1994 military budget indicate that the Finance 
Ministry is currently prepared to allocate only one-third of the 
sums requested by the Defense Ministry. 
  Answering a question on financing and reforming the mass 
media, Col. Gen. Vorobyev said that a choice has to be made in 
the current very complex economic conditions: Whether to 
maintain a particular military journal or give troops their 
statutory pay, for which people have sometimes been waiting 
months. It is a difficult choice but the second option must be 
chosen.

<F P=106> [Faina Osmanova report under the "Economy" rubric: "Defense </F>
Sector Looks for Government Support. Tariff Agreement for This 
Year Signed"] 
  [Text] The State Committee for Defense Industries, the 
Trade Union Association, and the Labor Ministry have signed a 
tariff agreement for 1994. The Defense Industries Committee 
expects that industrial policy regarding defense industries will 
be propped up by due government support and budget financing. 
The committee is presently trying to identify all the key areas 
so as to ensure the most efficient workload for scientific and 
research institutes and design bureaus, and also to utilize the 
defense industries' scientific-technical potential in a rational 
fashion. 
  In 1993 the sector experienced a 19.6-percent slump in 
production against 36.7 percent in 1990; the production of 
weapons and military hardware fell 34.3 percent against 1992 and 
72.4 percent against 1990. The share of weapons and military 
hardware slipped from 50 percent in 1990 to 21 percent in 1993. 
The main reasons for the downturn are: a break in economic 
relations, the unrestrained growth in raw material prices, 
oppressive taxation policy, and, as a consequence, a huge amount 
of enterprises' mutual debts. The negative processes under way 
in the defense sector have been caused by conversion (nearly 70 
percent in 1992) and the extremely inadequate financing by the 
state. Conversion that affects over 5-7 percent of military 
production is considered destructive in international practice. 
Corporate profits have been the main source of financing 
defense industries, accounting for nearly one-half of the cost 
financing. The Finance Ministry has released only 67 percent of 
the money appropriated for conversion programs and 23.7 percent 
of funds to maintain mobilization capacities, but even that was 
done after long delays. The enterprises have been forced to 
take bank credits at high interest rates. As a result of this 
policy of defense sector financing virtually all budget 
appropriations for government defense orders (99.9 percent) have 
been transferred to commercial banks and the Russian Federation 
Central Bank toward repaying the credits. It turned out that 
the government budget financed commercial banks and the Central 
Bank, not the military-industrial sector. In fact, the money 
was simply pumped from the government budget right into the 
banking system, and the defense sector enterprises worked to 
boost the banks' profits, not to satisfy the country's defense 
needs. In the end, defense enterprises ended 1993 with the 
accounts payable of 3 trillion rubles and the accounts 
receivable of around 2 trillion rubles. At the same time, while 
the Russian Federation Defense Ministry technically remains 
their main customer, it has effectively been replaced as such by 
the Finance Ministry.

<F P=106> [By Georgiy Salandiya in Moscow; from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The situation at enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex was discussed at a news conference 
at the State Committee for Defense in Moscow. Only yesterday 
the defense industry was the state's favorite, but today -- and 
this a highy intellectual industry as regards technology and 
specialists -- it is on the verge of collapse. Collapse is the 
very word, because in civilized countries a level of conversion 
of over 5-7 percent is already regarded as destructive. But in 
our country, in 1992 alone, it was almost 70 percent. 
  This is despite the fact that 80 percent of the output of 
the 
military-industrial complex consists of civilian output and 
consumer goods. The workers in the defense sectors are on the 
brink of poverty and the enterprises themselves are on the brink 
of shutdown. The state owes the enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex some 2 trillion rubles. In the 
event of them shutting down the enterprises of many sectors will 
not receive unique materials. The defense industry will cease 
servicing military equipment in the forces and will stop the 
delivery of spare parts for military equipment abroad.

"Russian Defense Ministry Nuclear Facilities. Dispute on 
Outside Control Continues"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federal Committee for Oversight of 
Nuclear and Radiation Safety (RF Gosatomnadzor) held a news 
conference devoted to the state and problems of ensuring safety 
at facilities around Russia that constitute a nuclear and 
radiation hazard (according to Gosatomnadzor, they number 14,500 
today). 
  The major part of RF Gosatomnadzor chairman Yuriy 
Vishnevskiy's address dealt with problems that had arisen in 
relations between the organization he heads and the Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry. According to Yu. Vishnevskiy, the 
problems boil down to the fact that, despite the repeatedly 
confirmed decisions made by the Russian Federation president, 
Defense Ministry chiefs are preventing the establishment of 
state oversight over the Russian Federation Defense Ministry's 
nuclear and radiation hazardous facilities. The situation at 
these facilities, Yuriy Vishnevskiy believes, is very serious: 
There have been instances of nuclear materials having been 
stolen and people overexposed. 
  Rear Admiral Nikolay Yurasov, chief of the Russian Navy 
nuclear safety inspection, commented in an exclusive interview 
for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Defense Ministry's stance on the 
given question. 
  [Vaganov] The commander in chief of Russia's armed forces -- 
the Russian Federation president -- made a political decision: 
to provide for nondepartmental control at Defense Ministry 
nuclear facilities. Why is Gosatomnadzor not allowed in these 
facilities? 
  [Yurasov] From the moment the RF Gosatomnadzor was formed, 
we invited their specialists right away, and they worked at our 
facilities. But when the process of approving documents began, 
a number of problems cropped up. 
  [Vaganov] With what are they connected? 
  [Yurasov] These questions affect not only the Defense 
Ministry as a departmental organ. In the first place, they are 
connected with state security problems, problems of breaking up 
the Russian Federation Defense Ministry structures already 
created for these same purposes. We also disagree with those 
requirements on provision of information put forward by 
Gosatomnadzor. But we are working with them, and, I think, will 
come to an agreement after all. 
  [Vaganov] The Gosatomnadzor chairman has stated he still 
does not know the details of the theft of one kg of fissionable 
materials from a military base in Murmansk in 1993. What do you 
know about this? 
  [Yurasov] We do not know the details either. The 
prosecuting bodies taking part in investigating this case have 
not given us any additional information. 
  [Vaganov] How would you comment on yet another statement of 
the Gosatomnadzor chairman: departmental control in principle 
cannot be more effective than state control. 
  [Yurasov] Mr. Vishnevskiy expressed himself somewhat 
differently: Owing to the fact that departmental control exists 
and the nuclear fleet's problems have (he said) not been solved. 
I radically disagree with him. The fleet's problems have been 
known to everyone and for a long time. Beginning in 1988 -- I 
state it with all responsibility -- the CPSU Central Committee 
general secretary, the USSR president, and all chairmen of 
governments were aware of these problems. 
  In accordance with Russian Federation president's directive 
No. 224 of 9 April 1993 on the incident in Tomsk-7, 
Gosatomnadzor was directed to conduct an inspection of all 
hazardous zones at nuclear facilities of all agencies, including 
those of the Defense Ministry. An interdepartmental commission 
was set up with RF Gosatomnadzor representatives also as its 
members. A report was elaborated on the results of this 
commission's work that was signed by Atomic Energy Minister 
Viktor Mikhaylov and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. This 
report is now being looked at in the government. Unfortunately, 
Mr. Vishnevskiy refused to add his signature to this document 
for formal reasons. 
  Let the respected Mr. Vishnevskiy say, which question in the 
area of nuclear safety of Russian Federation Defense Ministry 
facilities are unknown in the government? Should there be 
financial means, we will do all that depends on us. The thing 
is that out of the two directives adopted in connection with 
ensuring safety of nuclear facilities last year, one received no 
financial backing at all, and the other as little as 15 percent.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today's briefing at the General Staff of the Navy 
was devoted to the Navy's nuclear safety. Rear Admiral Yurasov, 
head of the Nuclear Safety Inspectorate, said that nuclear and 
radiation safety norms were revised after the Chernobyl 
catastrophe. According to Yurasov, these norms are being 
observed in the majority of atomic installations, atomic subs, 
and ships. 
  [Begin Yurasov recording] Considerable financial means are 
required to maintain the operation of these atomic subs. These 
atomic subs are a potential source of radiological 
contamination. [end recording] 
  A serious shortage of personnel to man nuclear installations 
is another problem of the Navy. There are not enough sailors, 
warrant officers, and officers. Touching upon the issue of 
sunken submarines--specifically, the Komsomolets sub--it was 
noted that it would be more expedient to mothball rather than 
raise them. The radioactive contamination around the 
Komsomolets is local and does not represent an ecological 
disaster. The marines do not regard as necessary the 
Gosatomnadzor's [Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation 
Safety] supervision of certain installations; they believe that 
departmental monitoring of the Navy's nuclear safety is 
sufficient. 
  [Begin V. Makarov recording, deputy director of 
Gosatomnadzor] What they are proposing runs counter to the 
approved amendments introduced in the provision on 
Gosatomnadzor. These amendment were agreed upon with the chief 
of the General Staff, and I cannot change the list of 
installations to be monitored. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS string correspondent Semyon Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 18 TASS -- The Russian 
military-space forces launched a "Raduga" sputnik from the 
Baykonur cosmodrome at 10 hours 56 minutes Moscow time today. 
The sputnik was launched by means of a heavy "Proton-K" 
three-stage carrier-rocket equipped with a "DM-2" acceleration 
block. The orbiting was successful. The sputnik's flight is 
controlled by the centre for testing and controlling the vehicle. 
  The sputnik, developed by the Applied Mechanics Scientific 
Production Society (Krasnoyarsk-26) under the direction of Chief 
Constructor and Director-General Mikhail Reshetnev, weighs about 
two tonnes and will be able to remain on the orbit for three 
years. It is fitted out with six-channel board relaying unit, 
designed to transmit telephone and telegraph signals. The 
sputnik will be placed on the near geostationary orbit -- 90 
degrees eastern longitude -- approximately seven hours after the 
start. Then it will be moved to its final position -- 45 
degrees eastern longitude -- by means of low-thrust engines. It 
will be used for the designed purposes in that position. 
  The launching of the "Proton-K" carrier-rocket was the 215th 
since its first start in 1967 and already the third since the 
beginning of this year. Only six launchings of this type of 
carrier-boosters were effected last year. 
  Two "Soyuz" vehicles were launched from Baykonur this year 
in 
addition to the "Protons". Such a busy launching schedule was 
made possible by the concerted efforts of men from the Russian 
military-space forces, who, in spite of several unresolved 
problems linked with the Baykonur cosmodrome and the town of 
Leninsk, are continuing to prepare and launch spuntiks. 
  Talks on the status and lease of the Baykonur cosmodrome are 
continuing between Moscow and Almaty. If they prove successful, 
the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan will sign corresponding 
documents this March.

  [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS -- Only the establishment of 
"direct protectorate with all fullness of power in the zone of 
the Ossetian-Ingush conflict will be able to resolve it 
sufficiently fast", Vassily Tarasenko, chairman of Russia's 
committee of the Federation Council on federal affairs and 
regional policy, told ITAR-TASS. He headed a delegation of 
deputies sent by the upper chamber of Russian parliament to 
North Caucasus. 
  After familiarizing himself with the situation in the zone 
under state of emergency, Vassily Tarasenko came to the 
conclusion that the content of the conflict is mostly connected 
with issues of ownership and power". Therefore, according to 
him, "the main thing for Russia now is not to give each side a 
little more power but establish necessary state power, for 
instance, in the form of a protectorate transferring to it all 
financial levers, judicial system and armed forces". 
  Presidents of the republics will remain, chairman of the 
committee says, but practically a representative of the center 
will bear all responsibility for the state of affairs. However, 
if this representative exceeds his powers or violates the 
all-Russian interests he will be immediately held responsible 
before the center. 
  During their stay in the zone of the conflict, the deputies 
associated with leaders of both republics, clergy, national 
movements, well-known representatives of intelligentsia, 
ordinary people and military men, and got convinced that all of 
them agree in one thing that "Russian presence is imperative 
there". Otherwise, "there will be fight in which innocent 
people will die as he who starts fighting, as a rule, does not 
participate in it".

  [Text] Ulan-Ude, 18 Feb -- Vladimir Tarmayev, Buryatia's 
health minister, was relieved from his post by resolution of the 
Buryatia government. The reason for dismissal was gross 
violation of legislation and regulations governing expenditure 
of the budget funds, exposed by a special investigation. 
  In particular, due to lack of control, the ministry has sold 
off 17 vehicles to various commercial organizations. The damage 
from unauthorized business trips made by the ex-minister and a 
number of his subordinates abroad and within Russia is estimated 
as very serious. At a modest estimate, financial "slips" made 
by Tarmayev cost the taxpayers more that 20 million rubles. 
  The government of Buryatia has forwarded the evidence of the 
investigation to the republic's procuracy.

  [Text] Syktyvkar -- A special session of the Komi 
parliament is looking at a draft of the republic's new 
constitution. Along with the main draft prepared by the 
constitutional commission, an alternative draft was examined, 
which was proposed by one of the republic's public movements. 
The latter was finally adopted as a basis: it proposes the 
introduction of a unicameral parliament and the post of 
nationally elected head of the republic. Premier Vyacheslav 
Khudyayev, who put forward the initiative to call a republican 
constitutional conference, suggested that, in addition to 
deputies, representatives of organs of local governments, public 
organizations, and entrepreneurs should take part in its 
proceedings. According to the premier, however, the Council of 
Ministers "does not intend to convene the constitutional 
conference independently from parliament."

  [Text] Almaty, 16 Feb -- A working meeting of delegations 
from Ukraine's Defense Ministry and the Republic of Kazakhstan's 
Defense Ministry has taken place. The delegations were headed 
by: on the Ukrainian side, Colonel General Ivan Oliynyk, deputy 
defense minister of Ukraine and chief of armaments; on the 
Kazakh side Major General Alibek Isymov, chief of the General 
Staff of Kazakhstan's Armed Forces. The prospects for extending 
cooperation and implementing agreements made at the level of the 
countries' government delegations at the beginning of 1994 were 
discussed. 
  A document was signed on the results of the meeting in 
Almaty, in which the sides noted great interest in extending 
contacts between the military departments of the two countries 
on a wide range of issues. The principles of mutual respect and 
mutual confidence are to be laid down in the foundations of 
these relations. The Ukrainian side showed readiness for 
military-technical and scientific cooperation in elaborating new 
types of technology, modernizing armaments already in existence, 
and developing the missile and space possibilities of the two 
countries. The Kazakh side is interested in more intensive use 
of the repair base in the interests of Kazakhstan's armed 
forces. It is planned to finalize and make specific the nature 
of mutual settlements and to study the possibility of 
eliminating existing debts in the near future. As participants 
of the meeting asserted, this type of bilateral contact 
corresponds to the bilateral obligations and desires of both 
Ukraine and Kazakhstan not to suppress the interests of a single 
third country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov by Igor </F>
Lenskiy in Moscow; date not given: "Raining Rubles Over the 
Pamirs. What Will They Water: Bare Rocks or Plowland?"] 
  [Text] Abdudzhalil Samadov, the new prime minister of 
Tajikistan, has paid an unofficial working visit to Moscow. 
  Samadov is a 44-year-old economist from an academic 
scientific background, a specialist in textile production, one 
of the most civilian sectors there is, he has the "bearing" of a 
desk-bound scientist, and at the same time he is...a chess 
player! Furthermore, he is a chess master. In 1965 the present 
Tajik premier played Anatoliy Karpov. This was at the junior 
championship of what was then our united country. 
  The visit was devoted entirely to the principles and 
implications of Tajikistan's entry into the ruble zone. It is 
no exaggeration to say that this fundamental question will 
determine the fate not only of the lifeless economy but also of 
the whole of Tajik statehood. That is why Russia has offered 
Tajikistan far easier terms than it has offered the other 
Central Asian states. 
  Before his departure for Dushanbe, Prime Minister A. Samadov 
received our correspondent. Here is what he said: 
  [Samadov] I have done the rounds of the leaders of Russia's 
ministries and state committees, scientific and business 
circles, and Federation Council and State Duma deputies so as to 
get them to understand the difficulties which await our economy 
in 1994. And also to discuss the first steps in multifaceted 
Russian-Tajik cooperation on the basis that Tajikistan has been 
defined as a state belonging to the ruble zone. The task ahead 
of us is to create a socially oriented market economy. 
  [Lenskiy] Abdudzhalil Akhadovich, how do you assess the 
current living standard in Tajikistan? 
  [Samadov] The fall in the living standard of the people, who 
have endured two dreadful years, the war, and its aftermath, is 
not a foundation on which you can talk about rapid successes and 
transformations. But the government does not want to appear to 
be at a loss before the people, it knows its people and it 
believes in their strength. Tajikistan's future will depend 
primarily on peace. 
  [Lenskiy] On what terms is Russia inviting Tajikistan to 
join the ruble zone? 
  [Samadov] It is too early to talk about terms. This is a 
process which has only just begun. A group of Russian experts 
is flying out with us to Tajikistan today to determine the 
timing and details of the transitional stage and, most 
importantly, the mutual responsibility which the two states are 
assuming. 
  [Lenskiy] So this is not a one-shot event, as many people in 
our country think? 
  [Samadov] This is a lengthy and difficult process. It is 
important that both sides have the will to realize their plans. 
  [Lenskiy] Last year Tajikistan was granted a credit of 120 
billion. Has that made it possible to revive the economy 
perhaps a little? 
  [Samadov] The last thing that we intend to do is simply to 
fritter that money away. Only the minimum resources are being 
channeled into supporting the low living standard which exists, 
mainly into the purchase of grain. The bulk of the credit has 
been used to restore the activity of production structures so as 
to step up commodity exchange with the CIS countries, first and 
foremost with Russia. Some 87 percent of our economic ties are 
with Russian enterprises. 
  [Lenskiy] In what sectors of the national economy is the 
closest cooperation between our states envisaged? 
  [Samadov] We are ready to supply our Russian partners with 
as much raw cotton as possible. And we will ask Russia to 
supply us with energy sources and chemical products for 
agriculture. 
  [Lenskiy] As is well known, trainloads of freight destined 
for Tajikistan have been blocked in the past few days on the 
Uzbek-Tajik border. I have heard diplomats say that this is 
because your neighbors are jealous at your integration into the 
ruble zone.... 
  [Samadov] I do not think that this is Uzbekistan's official 
position. We will sort things out. At the level of bilateral 
relations. 
  [Lenskiy] You are often criticized for not holding a 
dialogue with the internal opposition.... 
  [Samadov] We have begun progress in that direction. We are 
holding consultations with other countries within the framework 
of the CIS and the United Nations. We realize that it is hardly 
going to be possible to settle anything without such dialogue. 
  [Lenskiy] Each month 7,000 Russian-speakers leave 
Tajikistan. A further 120,000 are still living there. But 
within a year or two there could be none left. Does such a 
prospect worry you? 
  [Samadov] Of course it does. But it is not only Tajikistan 
which has to take measures. It is up to the whole Commonwealth 
to help to stabilize the political situation, ease the tension 
on the border, and bar the way to armed groupings once and for 
all. 
  It is not just Russians who are leaving but Tajiks too -- 
hundreds of thousands have already left their homeland. We 
await the return of all who once lived here and who call 
themselves Tajiks.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS political correspondent Yuriy Sizov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS -- Tajik Prime Minister 
Abdudzhalil Samadov said Russia and Tajikistan may reach a 
serious breakthrough in bilateral relations in 1994. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday following the 
talks with Russian officials that ended last week, Samadov said 
that Tajikistan "is destined to success only with Russia." 
  He said that Russian troops and the troops of other CIS 
states on the Tajik-Afghan border are a "powerful stabilising 
factor." Russia's presence in Tajikistan has helped avert "a 
large-scale armed interference of militants from Afghanistan 
into Tajikistan." 
  Speaking about the prospects for normalising the situation 
in 
the republic, the premier called for intensifying the political 
dialogue, including with representatives of the opposition who 
are seeking to restore peace in Tajikistan. "This should be done 
as soon as possible without setting any dates or preliminary 
conditions. This process should involve international 
organisations, primarily the United Nations, Russia and Central 
Asian republics," Samadov said. "Our government is ready to take 
the necessary steps to begin the process." 
  He stressed that his government "is ready for a dialogue 
with 
those who favour democratic development of Tajikistan." "Without 
any preliminary conditions we need to reach an understanding on 
joining our efforts to promote complex political, economic and 
social integration processes that are under way in Tajikistan 
this year," the premier said. 
  Asked if Tajikistan plans to sell raw uranium to Arab states 
and Iran, Samadov replied that "I am sure that the process of 
selling uranium made in the republic, which is being monitored 
by respective international organisations, will proceed in the 
same way as it has been proceeding until today. I state that 
any attempts to link Tajikistan with countries seeking to 
involve it in the development of their uranium programmes are 
doomed. The exception is the countries with which we have 
steady relations in this field, primarily Russia. These 
attempts are doomed politically too." 
  Commenting on the situation in the Central Asian region, 
Samadov pointed out to Tajikistan's relations with neighbouring 
Uzbekistan. "Our government has put inter-state relations, if we 
speak about the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Republic of 
Tajikistan, on a constructive basis, the basis of mutual 
understanding of specific problems and the assessment of the 
substantial assistance provided by the Republic of Uzbekistan at 
the period of hardships in 1992-1993," the premier said. 
  "I feel responsible for building such a system of economic 
and political relations which would ensure that the assistance 
and support we have received will be returned, but without 
damaging our own interests and with due account of the 
circumstances in this or that republic," Samadov said. 
  "As for the Tajik and Uzbek people, I am sure that 
considering the centuries-old historic ties that have been 
established on the vast expanses of Central Asia, these 
relations cannot be other than peaceful and all attempts to 
provoke an aggravation of these relations will be checked," the 
prime minister stressed.

  [Text] Moscow February 16 TASS -- "The activities of CIS 
joint peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan aim, for the first time 
in the United Nations' practice, to prevent a conflict", Tajik 
Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov told TASS on Wednesday. 
  He described this as a key pattern not yet widely accepted 
by 
the international community. "It is not by accident that we in 
Tajikistan speak about preventive diplomacy, about the need for 
the world community to take steps necessary to prevent a 
conflict rather than to bring it to the `boiling-point', just 
what we can see now in Bosnia-Herzegovina", the minister noted. 
  When Tajik diplomats, together with their Russian, Uzbek, 
Kazakh and Kyrgyz collegues raise in the United Nations a 
question of granting the CIS joint peacekeeping forces a U.N. 
mandate, we mean exactly this factor, Olimov stressed.

  [Text] Dushanbe February 18 TASS -- Three servicemen of the 
Tajik National Security Committee were killed and three others 
wounded as a result of last night's attack on a security unit 
deployed in the "Pravda" collective farm, located in Pyanj 
district, near the border with Afghanistan. The raid is 
believed to have been launched by a Tajik opposition gang, 
operating on the territory of Tajikistan. 
  Terroristic acts against servicemen of the Tajik national 
armed forces have lately become increasingly frequent. A short 
while ago some unidentified terrorists killed in Kurgan-Tyube, 
the administrative centre of Hatlon region, Colonel Mirzo 
Saydov, chief of staff of a special-purpose brigade of the Tajik 
Defence Ministry. Fire was opened somewhat earlier on a car, 
carrying Colonel Nurali Sharaliyev, deputy defence minister of 
Tajikistan, who was going from Kurgan-Tyube to Dushanbe.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, February 18 (TASS) -- The draft federal law 
"on the status of a deputy of the Council of the Federation of 
the first convocation and the status of a deputy of the State 
Duma of the first convocation of the Federal Assembly of the 
Russian Federation" was today approved by the Russian State Duma 
(the lower chamber of the parliament) in first reading. Taking 
part in the bill's elaboration were 19 lawyers -- members of the 
Russian parliament. 
  The law lays down the rights, duties, and responsibilities 
of members of both chambers of the Russian parliament. It also 
stipulates the basic rights and guarantees of parliament 
members, proceeding from Chapter 2 of the Russian Constitution. 
  Now the bill will have to be thrashed out in the committees 
and commissions of the two chambers of the Russian Federal 
Assembly (parliament), in the factions and parliamentary groups 
of the State Duma. Then, not later than March 10, their remarks 
and suggestions will be summed up by the State Duma's 
parliamentary committee for organisational affairs. After that, 
the bill will be submitted for second reading. 
  The document consists of five chapters and 41 articles. It 
is worth noting that deputies of the two chambers of the 
parliament, as approved during the first reading, shall enjoy 
the right of immunity throughout their term of office. They 
cannot be detained, arrested, or searched, except in cases when 
they are caught red-handed. They cannot be subjected to 
personal examination, except cases envisaged by the federal law 
in order to ensure the safety of other people. The right of 
immunity covers also the homes and offices of parliament 
members, their correspondence, the means of communication they 
use, and also the documents belonging to them. The question of 
stripping an MP of immunity shall be decided by a corresponding 
chamber of the Federal Assembly at the request of the 
procurator-general of the Russian Federation. 
  Members of the Council of the Federation and members of the 
State Duma are exempted from military service and military 
training sessions for their entire term of office. They are to 
furnish information on their incomes and property status to the 
state taxation service and corresponding bodies of the Council 
of the Federation and the State Duma (the two chambers of the 
Russian parliament). 
  Members of the Council of the Federation and members of the 
State Duma shall have the right to interpellate the president 
and the government of the Russian Federation, the ministries, 
departments or any other executive agencies on questions within 
the competence of those bodies at any time they deem it 
necessary. 
  It remains to be seen whether or not these provisions will 
remain in the final text of the law after the second reading.

  [Text] The State Duma Committee for CIS Affairs and 
Relations with Compatriots has supported the statement of 
President Boris Yeltsin who called to postpone the 
Russian-Georgian treaty's ratification before the situation in 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia was settled. This was announced by 
the committee's Chairman, Konstantin Zatulin at the State Duma's 
session on Thursday [17 February]. 
  Zatulin informed deputies on the closed parliamentary 
meeting 
on Russian-Georgian relations which had taken place on February 
10. According to Zatulin, Georgian, Abkhazian and South Ossetian 
representatives were invited to the meeting. 
  Zatulin refuted the allegations by media that this treaty 
was 
unilaterally beneficial for Russia. He stressed that the 
Russian military contingency in Georgia was, in fact, being 
reduced since the divisions earlier stationed there were to be 
withdrawn. Regiments are to be stationed on the military bases 
instead of the divisions. 
  Zatulin announced that many telegrams and appeals were 
coming 
to the State Duma from North Caucasian people, saying that the 
treaty with Georgia was a threat to peace in the region. 
  Zatulin emphasized that the committee led by him would back 
peacemaking efforts put by the Russian president and aimed at 
political settlement in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Zatulin 
expressed his concern over the fact that the treaty could be 
implemented de facto before its ratification. Proceeding from 
this, he recommended that a law on international treaties which 
would mention which treaties were a subject to ratification by 
the parliament be urgently adopted.

  [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS--The decree on the coverage 
of the State Duma activities by federal TV and radio 
broadcasting companies was adopted by the lower chamber of the 
Federal Assembly on Thursday [17 February]. Under the decree, 
the State Duma Committee on the Information Policy and 
Communications has been instructed to submit to the lower 
chamber of the Federal Assembly before March 21, 1994 a draft 
federal law on the procedure of the coverage by state mass media

  The decree envisages that before this law goes into effect, 
it is necessary to endorse a rough schedule of the coverage of 
State Duma activities by television. The schedule should be 
coordinated with Ostankino company and the Russian Television. 
  The committee for organising the work of the State Duma 
jointly with the Duma Committee on the Information Policy and 
Communications have been instructed to organise the press 
service of the State Duma and to create the necessary conditions 
for preparing television and radio programmes with the use of 
the equipment of the Russian television-parliament complex. 
  On Wednesday the State Duma decided on the further working 
out of the decree. All the amendments to the decree submitted 
by chairman of the Duma Committee of the Information Policy and 
Communications, Mikhail Poltoranin, were turned down by deputies 
at a meeting on Thursday.

<F P=106> [Robert Minasov and Yevgeniy Skukin report: "Family Row in </F>
`Falcon' Camp"] 
  [Text] The 16 February morning plenary session of the 
State Duma began with a small but fairly loud sensation. Viktor 
Kobelev, member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] 
faction, expressed his indignation that deputies have for some 
reason not been given the statement signed by himself and 
another faction member Aleksandr Pronin saying that they are 
quitting the LDPR faction. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy did not hang 
around. He described his party "brothers" in brusque, insulting 
terms and even accused them of criminal activities, saying that 
they have both been expelled from the LDPR and will therefore be 
immediately replaced in accordance with the Statute on Elections. 
  But that was not the only emotional outburst while the 
agenda 
was being discussed. Sergey Baburin thought that the signing of 
the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan will do Russian 
statehood irreparable damage since, in the deputy's opinion, 
this is the first-ever case of this kind of treaty being 
concluded between the whole and part of Russia. Thus, Baburin 
said, a precedent has been set for Russia to slide into a 
confederative system. However, it turned out that by no means 
many deputies share Sergey Baburin's opinion, so they rejected 
his proposal regarding guarantees of Russia's territorial 
integrity. 
  We have already said that part of the corps of deputies -- 
that part, incidentally, which nominated Ivan Rybkin for the 
post of chairman of the chamber -- is now blatantly voicing its 
dissatisfaction with his actions. Yesterday (16 February) the 
selfsame Sergey Baburin tried to get a question regarding the 
work of the chairman of the lower chamber onto the agenda on the 
grounds that, among other things, Rybkin, regardless of the 
opinion of certain deputies, nominated Andrey Voykov, a man of 
whom they are not fond, for the post of head of the apparatus. 
  The proposal made by Vyacheslav Marychev (LDPR) from the 
microphone caused a lively commotion: He proposed banning the 
Russia-wide television relay and...activity of Radio Liberty. 
Yuliy Gusman ("Russia's Choice") very reasonably objected by 
saying: How can you jam a radio on television?

  [Text] Baku (February 16) TURAN--Azerbaijan considers that 
mechanism of the CIS Treaty on Collective Security must be 
implemented not only in case of foreign aggression against the 
CIS-member state, but in case of the aggression of one 
CIS-member state against the other member, Azeri Foreign 
Minister Gasan Gasanov said on February 15 during the meeting 
with the Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandr Chikvaidze. 
  As Gasan Gasanov said "in this context the Treaty on 
Collective Security of the CIS-member states need serious 
revision." 
  The both ministers shared the opinion that domestic 
conflicts in the CIS seriously threat the perspectives of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Minister Ion Botnaru, by </F>
Jerzy Haszczynski; place and date not given: "Problems 
Inherited From Soviet Union"] 
  [Text] [Haszczynski] When the Soviet Union was 
collapsing, the Moldovan authorities expressed their criticism 
of the concept of the CIS. But last year, Moldova joined the 
CIS anyway. How do you explain the change of attitude? 
  [Botnaru] Our links with the CIS are of a specific nature. 
We are a de facto member of the CIS's economic union, but not 
de iure, since we have not ratified the appropriate documents. 
My view is that from an economic standpoint, Moldova should be 
in the CIS's economic union since that is the real situation 
from which we cannot get away. Our economic relations with the 
West still leave a lot to be desired, but one must live somehow 
until that situation changes. Generally speaking, the economic 
relations of a new country should be multifaceted. 
  [Haszczynski] Is Moldova interested in the CIS only 
from an economic standpoint? 
  [Botnaru] We do not participate in the CIS's military and 
political structures. So far, we have not signed any agreements 
which would relate, for instance, to security. What is 
important, is what shape the CIS will take in the future. 
Experience shows that those countries which have traditionally 
been together, can make their lots easier if they act together. 
But one should take part in such cooperation arrangements only 
insofar as it does not endanger a country's sovereignty. 
  [Haszczynski] Do you not feel threatened by Russia? 
  [Botnaru] I regard our relations with Russia to be correct, 
but there are still many problems which were inherited from the 
Soviet Union, first of all the problem of the 14th Russian Army 
which is stationed in Moldova. In my view, all problems can be 
solved if both sides conduct a dialogue. I paid a visit to 
Moscow recently, where I spoke with Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev. We listed the unresolved problems in 
Russian-Moldovan relations and we signed a bilateral agreement. 
Moldova has ratified it but Russia has not done so yet, and 
because of that, solving other problems is being delayed, for 
instance the problem of gasoline supplies to former Soviet 
military personnel residing in Moldova. 
  A withdrawal of the 14th Army would have an exceptionally 
positive impact on the development of Russian-Moldovan 
relations. The problem of the Cisdniester region is linked to 
that. 
  We think that some elements of Russia's relations with the 
Cisdniester region could be described as interference in 
Moldova's internal affairs. I mean the issue of Russian aid for 
the Cisdniester region, both in material and political terms. 
  [Haszczynski] Was there any specific date set during 
your Moscow talks, for the 14th Army's withdrawal from the 
usurpatory Cisdniester Republic? 
  [Botnaru] Moldova's position is that the Russian Army should 
withdraw by 1 July of this year. I regard that date as 
realistic. Despite everything, there are fewer [Russian] troops 
on our territory than used to be the case with Poland or other 
East European countries. The withdrawal should be unconditional 
and in accordance with international law and CSCE provisions. 
Talks are under way. Moldova is absolutely against having 
foreign troops stationed on its territory. I want to remind you 
that all countries recognize Moldova within the boundaries in 
which it proclaimed its independence in 1991, and that includes 
the Cisdniester region. 
  [Haszczynski] How do you imagine a calming down of the 
situation in the Cisdniester region? After all, fights have 
already erupted there a few times and hundreds of people have 
died. Is it possible, for instance, that Moldova should be 
transformed into a federation? 
  [Botnaru] No. I think that the variety of nationalities and 
their distribution in the various regions, make a federal state 
impossible. Moldova is a small territory (33,700 square km) 
which would be split into many small units if a federation was 
to be established. Besides, the base criterion of a federation 
is not completely clear, either. We used to live in the Soviet 
Union and we were told then that it was a federation. 
  As far as the Cisdniester region is concerned, we granted 
very far-reaching concessions and we guaranteed that if the 
issue of Moldova's joining Romania came up, then the people of 
the Cisdniester region could decide the territory's fate through 
a referendum. Almost all political forces in Moldova think that 
the Cisdniester region should have some kind of special status. 
The necessity of a decentralization is linked with that. Some 
amendments to our laws are indispensable, including the law on 
languages. We must talk about a possibility of using several 
languages in the country's offices: Let us say one of them 
would be called the state language (Romanian), and the other two 
would be called official languages (Ukrainian and Russian). The 
new parliament and the new cabinet should start working on these 
changes soon. 
  [Haszczynski] Do you really believe in a compromise? 
After all, the authorities of the Trans-Dniester region have 
announced that the region will take part neither in the 
parliamentary elections (27 February) nor in the referendum on 
Moldova's sovereignty and integrity (6 March). 
  [Botnaru] We do not seek the authorities' participation, 
especially given that these are not lawful authorities. We are 
after the people's participation; the usurpatory authorities' 
control does not extend to the entire Cisdniester region. There 
are areas and villages which cooperate with us. According to 
what we have found out, the people living in the parts not under 
the control of the usurpatory regime, will vote. 
  [Haszczynski] In official documents, your country is 
known as the Republic of Moldova. Do the authorities of the 
republic (which gained independence more than two years ago) 
think that using the old name of "Moldavia" (which was used in 
the Soviet period, among others) is inappropriate? 
  [Botnaru] "Moldavia" is a word of Russian origin. Right 
now, Romanian is our official language, and in Romanian, our 
country's name is "Moldova." But we have nothing against 
someone using the Russian-derived name in newspapers, for 
instance, as long as the name is used with respect. 
  [Haszczynski] How strong are the desires of Moldova to 
join Romania, to which most of today's Moldova had belonged 
before World War II? 
  [Botnaru] There are opposition political forces both in 
Moldova and in Romania, which are in favor of a merger of the 
two countries. I think the opposition is short-sighted. There 
will be a referendum on 6 March which will finally decide the 
issue of Moldova's sovereignty. But a referendum like this had 
taken place before -- I mean the presidential elections of 1991. 
The main slogan of the election campaign of Mircea Snegur -- 
who gained over 80 percent of the vote -- was Moldova's 
independence. A majority of Moldovans (Romanians) is in favor 
of independence. Almost all representatives of national 
minorities are against the merger, as well; these minorities 
comprise about 30 percent of the population. I think that those 
who are in favor of merging with Romania comprise no more than 5 
percent. 
  [Haszczynski] But still, Moldova's national flag is 
the same as Romania's (three vertical stripes -- blue, yellow, 
and red) and the national anthem -- which begins with the words: 
"Wake up, Romanian" -- is also the same. 
  [Botnaru] The colors of the flag are indeed the same, but 
there is a state emblem on our flag. I think that since the 
parliament adopted the flag along with the state symbol, then 
that is the way it must stay, especially since, for instance, 
the Russian and the French flags have the same colors and their 
combination is the only thing that makes them different. So I 
can see no problem with the national flag. 
  But it is a different story with the national anthem. A 
sovereign state should have its own national anthem. As a 
diplomat, I often encounter this protocol problem. My view is 
that the anthem must be changed. One must write a new anthem 
and the parliament should adopt it. And that will not be an 
unfriendly gesture toward anybody, since nowhere in the world do 
you have a situation of two sovereign states sharing the same 
national anthem. 
  [Haszczynski] In your view, what should one call 
representatives of the nationality which constitutes the 
majority in Moldova? Are they Romanians or Moldovans? Is the 
language that they use Romanian or Moldavian (as it was called 
in the times of the Soviet Union)? President Mircea Snegur has 
recently expressed criticism about using "a Romanian," 
"Romanian," instead of "a Moldovan," "Moldovan." 
  [Botnaru] It is a unique kind of problem -- it contains 
elements of history, as well as linguistic, psychological, and 
ethnic sciences. I would not like to go into such details. 
What is more important is that Moldova be transformed into a 
country of its citizens. Everyone should have a right to be 
called what he wants. 
  [Haszczynski] On 14-16 February, you paid a visit to 
Warsaw. You spoke with President Lech Walesa, Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak, and Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. What 
are Moldova's political and economic expectations vis-a-vis 
Poland? 
  [Botnaru] Poland's and Moldova's economies complement one 
another, so they can cooperate with each other as well. Some 
contracts have already been prepared pertaining to avoiding 
double taxation and protecting investments. Polish people will 
like our alcohol -- wines, high-quality champagnes, and cognacs. 
On a more serious note, Poland can import from Moldova 
agricultural products, broadly speaking. We are aware that 
Polish businessmen are afraid to invest because of the conflict 
in the Cisdniester region, but the conditions for investment 
will improve soon. 
  Poland is an active country and its voice counts on the 
international scene. It is a big country with big 
possibilities. We regret that our two countries have, so far, 
failed to set up a legal framework for our mutual relations. We 
are happy to take note of the establishment of a Polish Embassy 
in Chisinau in the near future. I do not hide the fact that we 
hope to receive assistance from the Polish authorities on issues 
where we have problems. The 14th Russian Army is stationed in 
Moldova, whereas Polish people have experience when it comes to 
the withdrawal of Russian troops.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 17, BNS -- Withdrawal of the Russian 
troops is the priority of Estonia's foreign policy, Foreign 
Minister Juri Luik said before the parliament today. 
  He said it was vital for Estonia to reach a situation when 
an 
attack against the country would be as impossible as, for 
instance, against Austria. 
  The minister expressed his concern about a virtual stoppage 
in the pullout of Russian troops from the country in the past 
weeks. He said about 2,500 Russian military were still remaining 
on the Estonian territory. 
  Addressing a parliament meeting that discussed Estonia's 
foreign political concept, Luik said the country needed a boost 
in its political activity toward the East. He said it was 
possible that "people who have successfully managed in the West 
will have to change their jobs and start working in the East." 
Luik said Estonia was not viewing the CIS as a "faceless and 
weak-willed union of states." He said visits by high-ranking 
Estonian officials to countries of the CIS are due soon. 
Estonian President Lennart Meri is to visit Ukraine in the near 
future, he said. 
  "It is important to mention that the European Union [EU] 
views the Baltic states as potential members of their union," 
Luik said. He didn't rule out the possibility that Estonia may 
become a member of the EU still before the end of the century. 
  The foreign minister mentioned Toomas Tiivel as the 
country's 
new ambassador to Latvia. He also expressed the hope that 
Latvia would send its ambassador to Estonia soon. 
  Tiit Made of the opposition Entrepreneurs Party at today's 
discussion characterized the country's foreign policy in the 
past year as "toothless, unprofessional and inept." 
  The former foreign minister, MP Trivimi Velliste, in his 
remarks said that if "in the foreign policy of Finland one 
speaks of a Paasikivi-Kekkonen line, in the case of Estonia a 
line of Meri-Manitski-Luik can be spoken about, which is a 
straight." 
  Also speaking before the MP's today was the chairman of the 
parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission, Vello Saatpalu.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb 17 (AFP) -- President Boris Yeltsin has 
returned to his dacha outside Moscow to recover from a cold 
after briefly coming to Moscow to meet British Prime Minister 
John Major, a spokesman said Thursday. 
  Yeltsin, 63, interrupted a week's rest on Tuesday [15 
February] to meet with Major, but then returned Wednesday to his 
residence in Zavidovo, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of 
Moscow, where he was still resting Thursday, spokesman Dimitriy 
Shevchenko told AFP. 
  "The president is suffering from a cold, nothing more," the 
spokesman said, adding that any "political speculation" about 
his health was "unpatriotic." 
  Yeltsin apparently caught cold on February 3, during an 
official visit to Georgia. He rescheduled his budget statement 
to parliament, originally due on Friday, for February 24. 
  His ill health came at a time of high diplomatic tensions 
over NATO's threat to bomb Bosnian Serbs if they do not pull 
back their heavy weapons from Sarajevo by midnight GMT Sunday. 
Russia opposes the ultimatum. 
  Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton tried unsuccessfully 
for two days to reach Yeltsin at his dacha to discuss the 
crisis. Washington blamed the failed communications on 
"technical" problems. The two men finally talked on Friday.

  [Text] In a meeting with President of Kazakhstan Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, U.S. President Clinton has asked him to stay away 
from the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Announcing the above in a gathering of reporters in New York 
yesterday, Nazarbayev said: The U.S. Government has a negative 
understanding of the Iranian Government. He referred to the 
special significance of the role played by Iran in the southern 
and central Asian equations and emphasized that relations 
between Almaty and Tehran are very good. 
  The Kazakh president, rejecting the existence of a threat of 
Islamic fundamentalism in Central Asia, stressed: We are all 
Muslims and respect Islamic beliefs. However, Nazarbayev said: 
A line has been drawn separating religion and politics in 
Kazakhstan. The Kazakh president said: Washington and Almaty 
have reached agreements in political, economic, scientific, 
technological, and defense fields as well as the U.S. use of 
Kazakhstan's space center and America has promised to provide 
$300 million of aid to Kazakhstan.

<F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report in the "Crimea" column] </F>
  [Excerpts] Yesterday in Simferopol Yuriy Meshkov gave a 
press conference. It was devoted mainly to the results of the 
Crimean president's six-day visit to Moscow. The president 
noted that he is "more than satisfied" with the meetings and 
negotiations in Moscow. According to Yuriy Meshkov, some 
tangible steps have been made toward merging the economies of 
Russia and the Republic of Crimea. The president said that by 
the start of the summer vacation season the peninsula will be in 
the ruble zone. Yuriy Meshkov assured that "we shall feel the 
results of this in the very near future." According to the 
president, "all the important decisions have been made on energy 
deliveries and other problems, in spite of the rather 
complicated situation in Russia itself." It was specially noted 
that "the Republic of Crimea enjoys the most favored nation 
regime with Russia." The president did not say whom he met in 
Moscow, saying only that negotiations were held at the highest 
level. "Above that level is only God." [passage omitted] 
  Talking about his visit to Kiev prior to his trip to Moscow, 
Meshkov stressed repeatedly that this visit was of a working 
character. "In Kiev, questions of the Crimean economy were 
discussed." Meshkov noted, however, that "the negotiations 
there were conducted in a friendly but rather tense situation. 
There is no way they can compare with the talks in Moscow. It 
is like apples and oranges." The president confirmed reports 
that Russia has allocated 50 billion rubles to ensure the return 
of the people deported from Crimea. Sharp comments were made 
with respect to persons implicated in misappropriating the 
resources earlier granted to the Crimean Tatars by Ukraine. 
"Some Crimean Tatars live in dugouts while some are building 
four-story mansions for themselves. I ordered my ministers to 
straighten that out." The president stated that his first edict 
will be on interethnic relations. 
  Responding to the question of weather he has advised 
Kravchuk 
about his trip to Russia, Yuriy Meshkov said, "I do not report 
to the Ukrainian president on my work." [passage omitted] 
  Journalists at the press conference assessed Meshkov's 
phrase 
"I consider it abnormal when state structures are used to 
promote the (journalists') views" as an encroachment on 
glasnost. The president believes that the journalist's duty is 
to "convey information," not express his opinion or select 
people who share it. "It is wrong to use one's official 
position to express one's personal views."

  [Text] Simferopol, Crimea Republic, 17 Feb -- Crimean 
President Yuriy Meshkov declared at a meeting with mass media 
representatives that the Crimea "is trying to preserve economic 
unity with Russia." According to Yuriy Meshkov, this very issue 
was the main objective of his six day visit to Moscow. "All the 
necessary agreements were signed," pointed out the Crimean 
president. "At present the Crimean republic enjoys the most 
favored nation treatment in its relations with Russia." Mr. 
Meshkov promised Crimea residents that they would feel the 
positive results of the Moscow agreements in the very near 
future. 
  The Crimean president told journalists that a trade and 
economic representation of the Crimea would be opened in Moscow 
soon and a representation of the Russian Federation and separate 
representations of the Krasnodar and Stavropol regions would be 
opened in Simferopol. 
  Dwelling on the appointment of the Moscow economist, 
Russia's 
former Minister of Economy Yevgeniy Saburov, to the post of the 
prime minister of the Crimea, Meshkov pointed out the following: 
"Today it would be most advantageous to appoint this very man to 
the post of prime minister." 
  Saburov cannot hold the state post because he is not a 
citizen of Ukraine, the leader of the Ukrainian president's 
service for issues of domestic policy Mr. Mykhalchenko declared 
in this connection. However, according to the press service of 
the Council of Ministers of the Crimea, dual citizenship will 
soon be introduced in the Crimea thus enabling Mr. Saburov, 
currently director of the Information and Social Technologies 
Centre under the government of the Russian Federation, to become 
the prime minister of the Crimea.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 18 Feb -- "If this meeting brings no 
results, I shall never again act as a mediator," Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stated today before a meeting 
between Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan, Azerbaijani 
Defense Minister Mamadrafi Mammadov, and Bako Saakyan, 
representative of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Asked by the conflicting sides to mediate at the talks, the 
Russian Defense Ministry has proposed a plan for stopping the 
military actions stage by stage. 
  Opening the meeting, Pavel Grachev noted that Russia's 
impartial mediation in this conflict is in line with the 
national interests of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia itself and 
is being conducted within the framework of the UN Security 
Council's resolutions on the Karabakh problem and the CSCE group 
on Nagorno-Karabakh. "There are no strong-arm methods of solving 
the conflict," Grachev said, adding that, since the parties 
themselves are not yet capable of solving the conflict because 
of its prolonged nature and complexity, mediation is extremely 
important and should lead to positive results. Moreover, the 
previous mediation efforts made by various countries and 
international organizations have not brought any long-lasting 
results so far. 
  The question of the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh will 
not 
be tackled at today's meeting. Purely military decisions 
concerning the stage-by-stage cessation of military actions and 
the establishment of conditions for a political solution will be 
discussed and, probably, adopted. According to the Russian 
defense minister, a cease-fire and the disengagement of the 
sides should be the first stage of the process, followed by the 
withdrawal of all "foreign troops" from the occupied territories 
and the deportation of all foreign mercenaries back to their 
homelands. The next stage will be the exchange of hostages and 
POW's. 
  Pavel Grachev said he was pleased to be offered the role of 
mediator and reported that the meeting is being organized on the 
eve of the summit between the presidents of Russia, Armenia, and 
Azerbaijan. 
  Representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh 
expressed the hope that the meeting will be fruitful and 
agreements proposed by the Russian Ministry of Defense will be 
reached.

  [Text] Baku, February 19 (TURAN) -- The meeting of 
Azerbaijan Defense Minister, Mammadrafi Mammadov and Armenian 
Defense Minister, Serzh Sarkisyan through the mediation of 
Russian Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev took place the day 
before in Moscow. The representative of Armenians of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, Bako Saakyan attended the meeting as well. 
The meeting was conducted on the initiative of Pavel Grachev. 
  As reported before, Grachev told both parties if they do not 
come to any agreement, he will never act as mediator in 
settlement of the conflict. 
  Such strict policy of Russian Defense Minister compelled the 
warring parties to take the resolution on cease-fire. 
Azerbaijani and Armenian Defense Ministers agreed to 
stage-by-stage settlement of the conflict. According to Defense 
Ministry of Russian Federation, Russian plan of settlement of 
the conflict stipulates cease-fire, liberation of all occupied 
territories, sending of all foreign mercenaries at home. 
  Representative of Russian Defense Ministry refused to 
comment 
on the question of a TURAN's correspondent "What do you mean by 
phrase `all occupied territories?'". He did not explain how the 
control over the sending of foreign mercenaries at home will be 
carried out. 
  Together with this, the meeting of Azerbaijani and Armenian 
Defense Ministers continues in Moscow. 
  Earlier this meeting was not scheduled and invitation of 
Armenian and Azerbaijani Defense Ministers to Moscow was a 
surprise. It should be mentioned that the meeting and the plan 
of settlement were not prepared in advance. 
  When the Serbians of Bosnia accepted Russian offers, the 
tension round the capital of Bosnia eased a little. Presently 
Russia wishes to win one more diplomatic victory in another 
hotbed. Moscow will try to make Azerbaijan to adopt its plan on 
settlement the Armenian-Azerabaijani conflict stipulating 
introduction of Russian peacemaking troops in the region. As 
known, official Baku did not agree with that plan as it does not 
stipulate absolute liberation of occupied Azerbaijani 
territories.

  [Text] Baku, February 21 (TURAN) -- Today Russian radio 
station "Mayak" reports that the European Council has adopted a 
resolution in which it recognizes Armenia as a participant in 
the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 
  The Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its statement 
expressed "its concern about the European Council's resolution". 
  Until now, despite Azerbaijan's efforts, all internationally 
adopted documents neglected to mention Armenia, as a country, as 
a participant in the conflict. 
  The Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs sees the 
resolution of the European Council as "a success in Azerbaijan's 
diplomacy". 
  A representative from the Greek Embassy in Baku stated that 
they do not have the text of the resolution that was taken by 
the European Council. 
  Greece is in charge of affairs concerning Azerbaijan for the 
European Council.

<F P=106> [Letter from UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to </F>
Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian Supreme Council 
and head of state, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin; date not 
given] 
  [Text] To His Excellency Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze; to His 
Excellency Boris Yeltsin: 
  Thank you very much for your letter of 20 February [as 
heard] 
in connection with the situation in Abkhazia. I am watching 
closely developments in the Republic of Georgia and so is 
Ambassador Edouard Brunner, my extraordinary and plenipotentiary 
representative to Georgia. We both share your concern over the 
absence of progress in the talks on the comprehensive political 
settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. 
  The Security Council continues to look into all aspects of 
the situation in Abkhazia, including a proposal put forward by 
the Governments of Russia and Georgia to deploy peacekeeping 
forces in the region. In its Resolution 896 of 1994, which was 
adopted unanimously on 31 January, the Council acknowledges the 
difficulty of the condition of 300,000 people, who, as is known, 
have been forced to leave Abkhazia. However, the Council 
stressed the necessity of substantial progress in the political 
solution of the conflict before it would be able to consider the 
possibility of deploying peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia. 
  The third round of talks between the Georgian and Abkhaz 
sides, which is to take place in Geneva between 22 and 24 
February, will have paramount importance. In advance of the 
forthcoming talks, I ask your delegations to do everything in 
order to make progress in the peaceful solution of the conflict. 
It is very important for both sides to demonstrate the progress 
that the Security Council is striving for. In this connection, 
Ambassador Brunner is planning to meet Mr. Vladislav Ardzinba in 
Geneva on 20 February. 
  Finally, let me express my heartfelt appreciation of the 
support given to Ambassador Brunner by the Russian Government in 
its capacity as facilitator. I would like to assure you that he 
and myself will continue to assist actively the parties involved 
in finding a comprehensive peaceful solution to the conflict. 
  Yours respectfully, 
  [Signed] Butrus-Ghali

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 19 TASS -- Most Russian newspapers 
highlight today Russia's peace initiative, which makes it 
possible to avoid the bombing of positions of Bosnian Serbs by 
NATO planes. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that "the West asked Russia to do 
its utmost for enabling NATO not to put its ultimatum into 
effect... After adopting the ultimatum, which was prompted by 
emotions and not careful calculations, and after realising how 
dangerous its consequences may be, the NATO countries began 
themselves to persuade Russia to do all it can for preventing 
the bombing." 
  "Boris Yeltsin and Russian diplomats have managed to ward 
off 
the threat of the bombing of the positions of Bosnian Serbs. By 
all appearances, the Russian diplomacy is set to develop the 
initial success," the newspaper points out. This means that the 
Moslems are expected to respond to the Russian initiative in the 
same way as Serbs. The Russian diplomacy believes that its next 
task is to achieve the demilitarisation of Sarajevo, following 
the diplomatic breakthrough, and its putting under U.N. control, 
as is envisaged by all the settlement plans. "This should be 
followed by the settlement of local Bosnian problems, along with 
keeping in sight a global settlement of the crisis." 
  According to ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, "the plan of the settlement 
of the conflict, suggested by Boris Yeltsin, makes the bombing 
senseless ... However, it is too early to celebrate a victory. 
A successful settlement of the crisis, brought about by a mine 
explosion at the Sarajevo market place and the death of 68 
people, is just the first stage in establishing comprehensive 
peace in the Balkan Peninsula. Many more joint actions will be 
required from all countries of the world community before the 
fratricidal war, which has been going on for 22 months, will be 
ended with a peace settlement." 
  Analysing the Russian peace initiative and its possible 
impact on the normalisation of the situation in Bosnia, 
IZVESTIYA writes that "the Russian diplomacy is saving NATO from 
the need to resort to force in Bosnia" and is giving a chance to 
Serbs. "This breakthrough of the Russian diplomacy is a logical 
and natural continuation of its Balkan policy, which has done 
far more good than actions and statements of any other Russian 
institution, party or group. Servicemen from various countries, 
who are now in Bosnia as part of the U.N. peace-keeping force, 
know well that not a single agreement has been fulfilled there 
so far, not a single ceasefire accord has lasted long. The 
situation with the latest agreement will become clear on Monday, 
the day when the NATO ultimatum expires. Even if the situation 
changes for the better, the settlement of the crisis around 
Sarajevo is an important, but initial step towards stopping the 
war and finding a political settlement in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina." 
  According to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, "Russia's stand is clear: to 
prevent NATO air strikes at Bosnian Serbs." In the opinion of 
the author of the article, which is frontpaged by the newspaper 
today, "whatever they say in the West about the fear that Serbs 
felt after the NATO ultimatum, it is confidence that played a 
decisive role in the fulfilment of its terms by Serbs, the 
confidence that they feel for Russia and its servicemen." The 
article points out, at the same time, that if the U.N. plan of 
the troop withdrawal and the taking of Sarajevo under U.N. 
control is put into effect, this first major victory over the 
Bosnian nightmare will go to the credit both of the U.N., NATO 
and the Russian diplomacy."

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 22 TASS - The situation in the 
former Yugoslavia remains the leading topic in today's Russian 
newspapers. 
  TRUD carries an interview with Vycheslav Kostikov, press 
secretary of the Russian president. 
  Evaluating the practical consequences of the actions of the 
president of Russia as regards the conflict over Sarajevo, the 
press secretary said in particular: "Boris Yeltsin's initiative 
has led to Russia's big diplomatic triumph on both european and 
world scale... 
  "Russia has virtually won a major battle for her status as a 
world power. The point is not only in the fact that Russia has 
returned to the beginnings of its historical politics and role 
in the Balkans and defended the Serbs who are close to the 
Russians spiritually, culturally, and ethnically. 
  "Russia has firmly designated the parameters of her 
influence 
in Europe and the world. It has become evident that not a 
single small or great power can fail to reckon with Russia's 
stand and her national interests. 
  "It has become obvious that no international organisation of 
universal or miltiary nature can take effective decisions if 
they fail to take the voice of Moscow into consideration". 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA expresses a different point of view on 
the 
Sarajevo events. 
  "Russian diplomacy, so far, has no grounds even for a 
cautious, moderate optimism, to say nothing of euphoria over the 
'triumph' of Boris Yeltsin's diplomacy. The creators of a 'new 
world order' continue to impose their diktat on the peoples of 
the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union by at least 
backstage, separate collusions, if not by air strikes". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an article by Mikhail Gorbachev 
under the headline "The NATO Ultimatum Was the Worst Possible 
Solution to the Bosnian Crisis". 
  "The West not only lacks the right to lull its conscience by 
cutting the knot in the tightening of which it itself had a 
hand. First of all, the West should come to realise that power 
politics will not resolve anything there," Gorbachev points out. 
  "Power-political actions, particularly if they are directed 
only against one of the sides while ignoring the real interests 
of all those involved, will never lead to peace... 
  "Various political options have now opened up for a 
settlement of the conflict in Bosnia due to Russia. It is 
essential to try them, taking into account all the errors made. 
There is no single culprit to whom an ultimatum could be 
presented". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the Sarajevo crisis: 
  "The Sarajevo crisis can be overcome on the strength of 
Moscow's initiative". At the same time the newspaper quotes 
U.S. President Bill Clinton as saying that the need for NATO air 
strikes in Bosnia has been obviated but that the settlement 
issue has not been resolved and, so, the ultimatum remains in 
effect". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wonders whether "the 'hand of Moscow' 
will undo the Balkan knot", drawing attention to the fact that 
"the numerical strength of Moslem infantry in the Sarajevo area 
is three times as high as that of the Serbian one at a time when 
the 'restraining factor', as represented by artillery guns 
surrounding the Bosnian capital, is now absent". 
  The newspaper concludes that "the way to the south-east, to 
the Serbian enclaves, has been somewhat 'cleared' for military 
forces led by Alija Izetbegovic". 
  PRAVDA, commenting on the situation in Bosnia, points out 
that NATO will not limit itself to an ultimatum in Bosnia. "But, 
in the interests of a further political settlement, will the 
'necessary balance in Bosnia' be maintained and to what extent? 
", the newspaper asks. 
  "In other words, the question is whether the Bosnian Serbs' 
concession will be compensated by appropriate obligations on the 
part of Moslem forces. If otherwise, it is not ruled out an 
idea may occur that that was the Serbs' 'one-sided 
capitulation'. Such an idea may play a negative role 
notwithstanding any active peacemaking efforts". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the NATO air strike ultimatum: 
  "The threat of NATO air strikes has been eliminatied due to 
resolute actions of Russia. NATO placed both itself and the 
entire world in an extreme situation. Europe could have faced 
an escalation of the Balkan war up to unpredictable proportions. 
NATO could be saved from itself only by Russia and she took 
such difficult decision". 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the same subject: 
  "The word of Moscow turned out to be decisive. Russia coped 
with the Sarajevo crisis within seven days".

<F P=106> [Ravil Zaripov "View from the Sixth Floor": "The President </F>
and the Duma: Things are Heating Up..."] 
  [Text] Yesterday Russian President Boris Yeltsin was 
supposed to have delivered the annual address to parliament. 
The event did not take place and the speech was postponed until 
24 February. Sergey Filatov, leader of the Presidential 
Administration, gave your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent the 
reasons for the postponement: "First, Boris Nikolayevich does 
not feel well and, second, there have been many telephone calls 
from the leaders of the territories asking for the dates of the 
president's speech and the enlarged session of the government, 
which was scheduled for 25 February, to be brought closer 
together. Otherwise they would have to fly to Moscow too 
often," Filatov explained. 
  The head of state's state of health is no trifling matter: 
It gives rise to a host of rumors and suppositions, and it is 
the prerogative of the attending physician to dispel them. 
However, it could be suggested that the ailment was most 
opportune. It enabled the president to take a time-out from the 
Bosnia crisis and postpone the explanations with 
parliamentarians on that matter. 
  Recent events in parliament show that mutual relations 
between the president and the State Duma are becoming strained. 
It is too soon to talk of a conflict, but.... After some 
reflection the president cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 
lower chamber speaker's election. In reply the parliament 
almost denounced the Belovezhskaya Forest agreements (they were 
30 votes short). And as previously promised it created a 
parliamentary commission to investigate the events in Moscow in 
September-October last year. Only 46 people voted against this 
(in other words, it was also supported by deputies from Russia's 
Choice). Unlike the criminal investigation instituted into the 
mass disorders on 3-4 October, the results of the parliamentary 
investigation will carry a political assessment. It may be 
variance with the Prosecutor's Office investigators' findings. 
So a return to this question (albeit at the level of 
parliamentary hearings) is hardly what Boris Yeltsin wants. 
  The parliamentarians decided to move from the City Hall 
building offered by Yeltsin to one of three other places: the 
White House, Staraya Ploshchad, or...the Kremlin. "How 
practicable is this decision?" I asked the initiators of the 
idea. "We will elevate the document to the rank of a law," 
Anatoliy Lukyanov replied. Whether this influenced the 
president's team or not is hard to say, but Sergey Filatov came 
to the latest session of the Duma Council (a body which includes 
the leaders of the factions and the speaker) and offered the 
lower house of parliament the former USSR State Planning 
Committee building on Okhotnyy Ryad Street where the Russian 
Federation Economy Ministry is presently located. The Council 
agreed, but whether the Duma will agree is another matter. The 
building is in need of capital repair which could take as long 
as the deputies' entire term of office. 
  There is a reason for the parliamentarians' show of 
autonomy. 
The Duma clearly does not like the bit-part which Boris Yeltsin 
has assigned to it. At the moment mutual relations are typified 
by the unsophisticated formula: "I adopt the decisions, you 
ratify them." The deputies' factions received the text of 
Russia's treaty with Georgia the very day before the signing, 
when there was no longer any point in discussing it. They had 
missed the boat. Hence the problems with ratification.... The 
president's moves always take deputies by surprise. The Duma 
does not have 20 people to set out the Boris Yeltsin's position 
on this or that question, let alone lobby for his ideas. 
  But what about Russia's Choice? It is distancing itself 
increasingly from the president. Added to that is the clear 
absence of factional discipline. Burdened by their political 
weight, many of the Russia's Choice people are steering clear of 
routine parliamentary work. This is clearly visible from the 
balcony -- from the right, crew-cut ranks of the Communists, the 
Cgrarians, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. From the 
left -- the preserve of People's Choice -- the vast open spaces 
of empty seats. What is the point of lobbying there?

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 34 (524)] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin used his powers 
under the new Constitution and sent Ivan Rybkin, Chairman of the 
State Duma, a list of priority bills the cabinet wants approved 
in the first quarter of this year. 
  The 60 bills in the list are regarded by the government to 
be 
essential for continuation of the reforms in 1994, Vladimir 
Kvasov, the government chief of staff, told Interfax in an 
exclusive interview. The list includes amendments of the 
Criminal and Criminal Processing Codes and pension and value 
added tax legislations. The government will ask the law makers 
to start working on payment for land, land utilization, 
privatization and technological policy legislation. 
  Even this incomplete list confirms the government resolve to 
stay on the reform course and to have a legal basis for this, 
Kvasov said. He described the argument advanced by numerous 
political scientists and columnists that departure of Yegor 
Gaidar and Boris Fyodorov reflected a change of the government 
course as "not serious." He explained: "Did only these two 
carry the reforms out while the other nearly 30 members of the 
government were standing by? Because nearly all other ministers 
have retained their jobs, it would be wrong to say that this is 
a new government." 
  He confirmed that the government was "actively engaged" in 
preparation for a meeting which would discuss the country's 
economic situation and the prospects for its development in 
1994. The national budget and ways to put it on a sound basis 
are also under discussion. 
  "The Russian government did not ask scientists Abalkin, 
Shatalin, Petrakov and their teams to work out any programs but 
it will not reject considering any model of economic development 
which might do Russia good," Kvasov said. 
  He described the government headquarters as a working body 
one of whose functions was to concentrate the government's 
attention on priority fields such as the socioeconomic policty, 
fuel and energy, transportation, communication, conversion of 
defense industries to peaceful uses and the investment policy. 
  A machinery structured function-wise rather than sector-wise 
is capable, Kvasov thinks, of helping the government to stay on 
this selective course, thus reducing the dangers of sectoral 
lobbying. Kvasov believes that this is especially important now 
that the country was short of finances and material resources. 
  He dismissed media reports of differences inside the 
government. "A machinery where about 750 senior officials are 
engaged does not duplicate the functions of ministries or 
departments. Its enables the government to have things done. 
This is the formulation of the Russian Council of Ministers 
Act, signed by the president on December 22, 1992, or 20 days 
before I became head of this echelon," Kvasov emphasized. 
  He said that there was no truth in the press reports to the 
effect that his office was capable of tackling political matters 
such as laying the groundwork for the next presidential 
elections. "The headquarters was designed as a purely economic, 
not political, office. Over 100 doctors and candidates of 
economic sciences make the core of its personnel. We draft 
about ten government ordinances daily. Nearly 4500 such 
documents were processed in the headquarters and its personnel 
carried out over 46,000 orders of top authorities last year. 
With this amount of work the headquarters simply cannot share 
in political tugs-of-war and we never wanted it," Kvasov said. 
  In his view, the government has "a sufficient safety margin" 
and is strong enough to withstand political attacks. Certain 
people are trying, however, to make life hard for the government 
by provoking strikes and adding to social tensions. The 
opponents of reforms are trying, he said, to play "the miners 
card."

<F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva report in the "Committees" column: </F>
"The Duma Wants To Recover the Budget Control Committee. The 
Government's Reaction So Far Is Not Clear"] 
  [Text] The Committee on Budgets, Taxes, and Banks and 
Finances, headed by Mikhail Zadornov (Yabloko), intends to 
return to parliament jurisdiction the Budget Control Committee, 
which was placed under the control of the Council of Ministers 
in September 1993 under Edict 1400 "On Phased Constitutional 
Reform," along with the State Statistics Committee, the Pension 
Fund, and a number of other organizations. In 1993 the Budget 
Control Committee, headed by Ms. Polunina, was under the Supreme 
Soviet's jurisdiction, playing an active role in the 
confrontation between Boris Fedorov and the parliament. At that 
time the committee accused the Finance Ministry and the 
government of manipulating the budget and "withholding" state 
revenues. 
  Aleksandr Pochinok said in this connection, "I am very 
grateful to Viktor Chernomyrdin for preserving this committee; 
otherwise the highly qualified people working in it would have 
simply gone away and the records would have disappeared... This 
committee was created as an analytical budget structure of the 
Supreme Soviet apparatus, and it can be transformed into a most 
efficient Accounts Chamber [Schetnaya Palata]. Therefore we ask 
the government to return it to us." 
  The position on this issue by Mr. Chernomorda, who currently 
heads this committee and who has prepared a plan for the Budget 
Control Committee's activity in the first quarter, is not known. 
  The Duma's Budget Committee proposed introducing in 1994 
changes and amendments into the budget and banking legislation 
or adopting new laws On the Foundations of the Budget System and 
the Budget Process in the Russian Federation; On the Russian 
Federation Central Bank, Banks, and Banking Activity; On the 
Limit of Foreign Loans; On the Federal Budget and the Budget 
System in 1994; On Demarcating the Budget Powers between the 
Components of the Russian Federation Budgetary System; and On 
the Basic Principles for Granting Subventions, Subsidies, and 
Financial Assistance from the Federal Budget to the Federation 
Components. 
  The parliament's Subcommittee on Central Bank Activity, 
which 
is now chaired by former finance minister Boris Fedorov, in its 
turn will hold -- after consultations with Duma deputies, the 
Banks Association, and individual commercial banks in February 
through March -- hearings in the lower parliament chamber on the 
Central Bank's money and credit policy and performance. The 
subcommittee intends to obtain explanations from the Central 
Bank on its operations on the money market, hard currency 
operations, its reserves and participation in other banks and 
international organizations, as well as about the Central Bank's 
interaction with the government and local power bodies.

<F P=106> [Report by Academician K. Panferov, deputy of the State </F>
Duma: "Anxious Expectation. Sunday February 20 NATO Ultimatum 
to Bosnian Serbs Expires. Discussion in the Duma"] 
  [Text] The bombing of the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia must not be allowed -- that demand was expressed in 
all the speeches from Russian State Duma deputies at the 
parliamentary hearings held by the State Duma's Committee on 
Questions of Geopolitics under the chairmanship of the 
historian, Viktor Ustinov. 
  During the discussion N. Stolyarov, the committee's deputy 
chairman, asked this question: Will peace reign as a result of 
the planned and coordinated third-party intervention in the 
Balkan crisis? "It may be said unambiguously and with a great 
degree of accuracy: No, no, no!" he said. The possible bombing 
of the Bosnian Serbs will be the result of an inhuman and 
dishonest political game. Russia must in no circumstances be a 
party to this conflict. 
  A. Frolov, a member of the Geopolitics Committee, stressed 
that since Russia's withdrawal from the ranks of the great 
powers all the peacemaking missions conducted under the UN flag 
have turned into unilateral interference in the internal affairs 
of various states. Today we are seeing NATO's anti-Serb 
tendency. With regard to this conflict Russia, regrettably, has 
for a long time now not had a position of its own based on its 
national and state interests. 
  Deputy Mikhaylov, a spokesman for the Defense Committee, 
focused his speech on the fact that the present situation on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia is a consequence of the 
shortsighted position taken by Russia on the Balkans. Russia's 
leaders must do everything possible to prevent the barbarous and 
inhuman bombing action. 
  Deputy N. Krivelskaya from the Security Committee asked 
representatives of the Foreign Ministry: If Russia does not 
exercise its right of veto in the Security Council, how will 
Russia's foreign policy line be implemented at all? 
  In the course of the hearings parliamentarians came to the 
conclusion that the UN Security Council's imposition of economic 
sanctions on Yugoslavia, sanctions which Russia supported, has 
done tremendous harm both to Yugoslavia itself and to other 
countries and has shown itself to be completely ineffective. 
Russia cannot accept the fact of air strikes against the Serb 
positions because this act goes beyond the framework of the UN 
Security Council's decision under Article 40 of the UN Charter. 
Russia cannot accept the thrust of an ultimatum directed 
against the Serbs alone. The State Duma asks all the warring 
sides to call a cease-fire, completely demilitarize the Sarajevo 
region, withdraw the troops and heavy artillery from the city, 
and place the Sarajevo region under UN control. The deputies of 
the Russian State Duma take the initiative of asking the 
parliaments of the UN member states to immediately convene a 
special conference on the settlement of the conflict by peaceful 
means.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent: "Directive-Like Tone </F>
Does Not Befit the Duma"] 
  [Text] Our correspondent asked Gennadiy Seleznev, deputy 
chairman of the State Duma Committee for Information Policy and 
Communications, to comment on the decree it has adopted "On 
Coverage of the Activity of the State Duma and Federal Assembly 
by Federal Television and Radio Companies." 
  "In my view, the Duma deputies have made a reasonable 
decision by not obliging anyone to cover the legislators' 
activity in a directive-like tone. That would violate the Law 
on the Mass Media. The Duma has agreed to adopt the `Ostankino' 
Russian State Television and Radio Company and the Russia 
channel's offer to cover the deputies' work within the programs 
that already exist. Total coverage time will be at least two 
hours a week. This procedure will stay in place until the 
federal law `On the Procedure for Covering the Activity of 
Russian Federation Organs of State Power in State Mass Media' is 
adopted. Note carefully that in the future the law will deal 
with the regulation of coverage of all branches of power, 
including the undeservedly forgotten judiciary. 
  "The Duma will have its own press service and press center 
and will actively operate the `RTV-Parliament' studio and 
equipment complex. 
  "As of 28 February, our committee has been scheduled to 
conduct parliamentary hearings on the extremely topical issue of 
`The Economic Position of the Mass Media in Russia.' It is 
hoped that we will jointly be able to find ways to ensure the 
mass media's survival."

Russia's Magadan Region has decided to suspend two generating 
units and may suspend the other two when their fuel runs out due 
to the lack of funds to make an advanced payment for the next 
annual fuel supply. 
  Customers, mainly gold mining firms, owe the plant eight 
billion rubles for last year. The plant's own debt has reached 
seven billion rubles. The plant's trade union organization has 
demanded help from the government.

  [Text] The main generating set of the Bilibino AES [nuclear 
electric power station] in Magadan Oblast was stopped today, the 
POSTFAKTUM agency reports. It was stopped at the initiative of 
the strike committee and the management of the Bilibino AES 
because it is owed a considerable amount of money for the 
electricity supplied to consumers. The station itself owes 
approximately 6 billion rubles to its employees and partners, 
while consumers' debt to the AES amounts to 8 billion rubles. 
If the strike continues, most of the biggest enterprises in 
Yakutia and Magadan Oblast could come to a halt in the next 
three days.

  [Text] Reports by some news media on the strike at the 
Bilibino nuclear power station (Magadan Region, Russian Far 
East) and on stoppage of nuclear reactors there are wrong, 
Interfax was told by a spokesman for the state concern 
"Rosenergoatom", which is responsible for operation of Russian 
nuclear power stations. 
  The concern admits, however, that a difficult situation has 
shaped up at the Bilibino station. It is caused by the delay in 
payment of wages to the personnel since December last year. In 
one of its reports to the concern, the nuclear station's leaders 
say that the families of many specialists are on the brink of 
starvation. 
  The spokesman said, however, that the station continues 
operating as usual and strikes at nuclear power engineering 
industry are banned by Russian law. 
  The concern will hand over 500 Mn rubles Tuesday to the 
station workers. However, the sum is only enough to pay wages 
for December. The spokesman said that at all Russian nuclear 
power stations the wages have not been paid since January. 
  The Bilibino station is a station of local importance and 
supplies energy for the Bilibino-Chaunskiy mining center.

  [Text] The process of electing local authorities must be 
studied and adjusted, because it is not normal everywhere, Chief 
of the Russian president's Staff Sergey Filatov told the 
president's Public Chamber. 
  To quote Filatov, in individual regions strong efforts are 
being made to preserve the Soviet system of authority. 
Moreover, the local executive bodies are under the pressure of 
the representative ones. 
  Asked about the possibility of postponing elections to local 
bodies, Filatov told Interfax that the presidential decree on 
reorganizing the local authoritative and self-government bodies, 
according to which local elections must be held in the first 
quarter of the year, should be made more flexible. 
  The implementation of this document demonstrated, said 
Filatov, that individual regions should work out their own 
election schedule. If the local conditions demand that elections 
be held in June or in autumn, such elections should be held 
during these periods. He expressed hope that the most vitally 
important problems arising in society would be analyzed by the 
Public Chamber and recommendations would be given to the 
president and government on ways of adjusting their work and 
taking more reasonable decisions. 
  He said no one should fear lest the Public Chamber, a 
consultative body, might juxtapose itself to the Federal 
Assembly. This is a normal international practice whereby public 
forces gather at a round table and express their views on the 
most essential state problems. This is going to be the 
president's public relations agency, he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Styazhkin] </F>
  [Text] Zheleznovodsk (Stavropol Territory) February 22 TASS 
-- "Only by strengthening the statehood of the Russian 
Federation will it be possible to heal its sore spots," head of 
the Presidential Administration Sergey Filatov told a meeting of 
heads of the North Caucasian republics, leaders from the Don 
area, Krasnodar and Stavropol territories here today. 
  The meeting analysed the fulfilment of the presidential 
decree to settle the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and also the 
reasons why the implementation of several provisions of this 
document is being dragged out. The participants of the meeting 
mapped out agreed actions to ensure the practical reduction of 
tension in the region. 
  In Filatov's opinion, the number of "sore spots" in Russia 
was diminishing in spite of the difficult economic situation. 
"The adoption of the new Russian Constitution," the head of the 
Presidential Administration stressed, "has laid the foundation 
for further social stabilisation in the country." 
  "The strength of a state," he added, "depends on its unity 
and indivisibility, by concord among all the subjects of the 
Federation making it up. Therefore, the work of every regional 
leader should be assessed by what he has done to strengthen the 
Russian statehood and to resolve regional problems on its basis." 
  The meeting noted with concern that the settlement of the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict was complicated by differing approaches 
and a frequent desire "to grab all the pie". 
  Filatov told the meeting that President Yeltsin's address to 
the Russian Federal Assembly (parliament), scheduled for 
February 24, would contain a package of comprehensive measure to 
strengthen the Russian state.

association, has said that $7 million has been transferred from 
Moscow to the Omsk-based Baranov Engine Making Association's 
hard-currency account toward payments for military aircraft 
engines sold to Iran over a year ago under a $35 million 
contract. Moscow has just begun to settle accounts with the 
enterprise, although the customer paid the money long ago.

  [Text] The press service of the Ukrainian president and the 
Government has reported that Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
had a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton 
yesterday. During the conversation, the presidents expressed 
satisfaction over the dynamically developing Ukrainian-U.S. 
relations. In particular, Bill Clinton highly commended the 
political course and practical actions by the Ukrainian 
leadership to destroy nuclear weapons according to the recent 
resolution of the Ukrainian parliament concerning the START 
Treaty. He also expressed the hope that Ukraine will shortly 
join the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. All 
these steps, in the U.S. President's opinion, open new 
possibilities for efficient economic cooperation between Ukraine 
and the United States both through mutual links and influential 
international financial institutions. Leonid Kravchuk and Bill 
Clinton concluded that the issues they had agreed on, after 
being worked on by experts and government officials, will be 
prepared as documents, some of which will be signed during the 
official visit of the Ukrainian president to the United States 
on 3-7 March 1994.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ivan Drach: `The Bombing of </F>
Sarajevo May Become Another Spiral in the Escalation of 
Violence'"] 
  [Text] After the bomb explosion at the marketplace in 
Sarajevo that killed 68 people, the conflict in Yugoslavia came 
to a head. While the ultimatum given by the NATO Council to the 
belligerent sides expires on 21 February, negotiations between 
Bosnian Serbs and Muslims in Geneva have not seen any positive 
results. According to the press center of the Ukrainian World 
Coordinating Council, there are two approaches in Ukraine 
towards the Sarajevo bombing. The first one is to support the 
international community, which seems inclined to resort to 
violent measures to stop the conflict; and second, to support 
Russia -- openly sympathetic with Serbia and intent on delaying 
any forced outcome. Here is how Ivan Drach, chairman of the 
Ukrainian World Coordinating Council, commented on this issue: 
  I would say that the truth is somewhere in between these two 
stances. All those events affect the interests of Ukraine, 
ethnic Ukrainians living there, and Ukrainian soldiers serving 
in peacekeeping battalions stationed in that region. Given the 
above factors, let me say that our position should be well 
balanced. The shelling of Sarajevo is, so far, a sort of 
intimidating action, and not a combat operation yet. Both sides 
were offered one more chance for reconciliation. After all, the 
bombing threatens to become another spiral in the escalation of 
violence. This time, Serbian President Milosevic threatens all 
of Europe, saying that he cannot guarantee the security of UN 
peacekeeping forces after any air strikes. This should make all 
those who assumed the peacekeeping mission think twice before 
deciding on this serious move.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; place and </F>
date issued not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The course of events in Bosnia-Herzegovina continues 
to be followed with great attention in Ukraine. The latest 
reports from Sarajevo show that, following the accord on a 
cease-fire reached between the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims, and 
with the mediation of the UN forces command, both sides have 
begun the process of withdrawing heavy artillery and placing it 
under UN supervision. 
  Hailing these positive movements, Ukraine calls on the 
conflicting sides to continue their efforts, the final aim of 
which should be an agreement on transferring all weapons to UN 
control, full withdrawal of Serbian formations from Sarajevo, 
and the occupation of their positions by sub-units of the 
peacekeeping forces. The demilitarization of Sarajevo and 
transfer of the town to UN management will stop the senseless 
bloodshed and serve as a starting point for reaching a fair and 
peaceful settlement. 
  Ukraine considers that refusal by any side in the conflict 
to 
cooperate further with the UN with regard to implementing the 
accords reached should be viewed as a challenge to the world 
community and disregard for UN decisions, and may lead to the 
use of force, as envisaged in the UN Charter and Security 
Council resolutions 836 and 844. 
  Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs appeals to the 
political leaders of the conflicting sides and to the peoples of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with an insistent call to show political 
wisdom namely now, and notwithstanding insults, reproaches, and 
distrust, to adopt a definitive stance for the benefit of peace 
in the region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov by Aleksey </F>
Bogomolov: "Two Weeks in Power. Republic of Crimea President 
Yuriy Meshkov Answers MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS Questions"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Bogomolov] If the Crimeans 
vote for the republic's independence, would you risk challenging 
Ukraine in order to comply with their will? 
  [Meshkov] There is no need to do so, because the question of 
the referendum has been formulated as follows: "Are you in 
favor of an independent Republic of Crimea in a union with other 
states?" Note, the word "union" is not capitalized. This is 
one part of the answer to your question. The second part is 
that the Republic of Crimea has been restored as a subject of 
the Union Treaty or, quoting literally: "a subject of the Union 
and a participant in the Union Treaty." So, now the republic 
can be considered a subject of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States. It is from these facts that the top authorities of our 
republic had to proceed in their activity, but they did not do 
so. 
  [Bogomolov] That is, legally speaking Crimea may be 
considered independent? 
  [Meshkov] There is a legal framework for that, but in order 
for it to receive a requisite confirmation we need to resort to 
a referendum. 
  [Bogomolov] Observers single out two statements of yours 
with regard to the Black Sea Fleet problem: that the fleet 
should belong to Russia, and that its fate should be resolved at 
a meeting between Yeltsin and Kravchuk. Many people see these 
two statements as mutually exclusive. Is this really so? 
  [Meshkov] One does not contradict the other. Under the 
Massandra agreement, the presidents in fact agreed that the 
Black Sea Fleet belongs to Russia, and it will pay Ukraine 
compensation for the part of the fleet that in theory was to be 
taken over by Ukraine in the form of specific warships. 
Naturally, it follows from this -- both from a legal point of 
view and from the point of view of elementary logic -- that the 
Black Sea Fleet is Russian and that it will be based in 
Sevastopol, because there has not been any talk about changing 
its deployment area. 
  [Bogomolov] Do you hope that your supporters will also win 
in the 27 March elections for the Crimean Supreme Soviet? 
  [Meshkov] Judging from the first round of the presidential 
elections, which were contested by all the key political forces, 
this hope is justified. [passage omitted] 
  [Bogomolov] Crimea has a strong communist movement. What is 
your attitude to it? 
  [Meshkov] Basically, I have a dual attitude to the communist 
movement. We should distinguish between the communist ideology 
and the methods of putting it into practice. The communist 
ideology is everlasting, as religion, as any other form of a 
widespread philosophy of life. In its pure form it comes down 
to a desire to create a perfect society, an abstract, perfect 
model of human existence. What brings the communist idea close 
to Christianity is the fact that after all they both are founded 
on love of your neighbor. The natural and ineradicable human 
aspiration is to live better, and numerous lives have been 
sacrificed to confirm this desire. How this idea is fleshed out 
is another matter; the methods are different everywhere: from 
Cambodia to Cuba and from Albania to our country. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Bogomolov] Both Russians and Crimeans are concerned about 
one thing: Will Crimea return to the ruble zone? 
  [Meshkov] In theory, this has been agreed on with the 
Ukrainian leadership. This is possible. As for the problems of 
implementing this plan, this is a technical matter; the only 
thing we need here is help from specialists. 
  [Bogomolov] What is your view on the creation of a free 
economic zone in Sevastopol? 
  [Meshkov] You know, this is a somewhat idealistic desire. 
Sevastopol's historical and actual situation as a naval base is 
not conducive to this. How all advantages of the Sevastopol 
port and all its bays should best be used is another matter. 
But this problem should not necessarily be tied to the status 
of a free economic zone. 
  [Bogomolov] Finally, about the problem of the Crimean 
Tatars. What solution do you see to it? 
  [Meshkov] The main problem here is logistic support. As for 
purely ethnic problems, the Crimean Constitution has enshrined 
the equality of all nations living in the peninsula. This is 
from where we proceed.

  [Text] Yerevan, 19 Feb, -- The Armenian authorities are 
convinced that there is no alternative to a peaceful settlement 
of the Karabakh conflict and that all strong-arm methods to 
resolve it are doomed to failure. This is stated in a statement 
published here today by the Armenian Foreign Ministry's press 
and public relations service. 
  The Armenian side, the statement says, considers that any 
mediation mission seeking a settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh will 
only bear fruit if it involves plenipotentiary representatives 
of the lawfully elected authorities of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic. The Armenian Foreign Ministry press service issued 
the statement in connection with pronouncements by Azerbaijan's 
foreign policy department accusing the Armenian leadership of 
pursuing a policy of acting from a position of force and of 
continuing the occupation of Azerbaijan lands. 
  The Armenian Foreign Ministry press service statement 
emphasizes that the republic's authorities support all 
peacemaking efforts to establish peace in the region, including 
the CSCE and the Russian Federation initiatives.

  [Text] On 17 February Baku Radio and later other mass media 
disseminated a statement by the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry 
that accused the Armenian leadership of trying to talk to 
Azerbaijan from a position of strength and for continuing the 
occupation of Azerbaijani territories. This propagandistic 
argument was based on the fact that the Armenian Foreign 
Ministry has rejected to participate in a scheduled meeting of 
Armenian and Azerbaijani experts in the Norwegian capital of 
Oslo. 
  As is known, the international non-governmental public 
organization International Alert is sponsoring this meeting. 
  The Armenian Foreign Ministry press and public relations 
service is authorized to state the following: The Armenian 
authorities are convinced that any mediation mission aimed at 
settling the Karabakh conflict can be productive only if the 
plenipotentiary representatives of the legally elected 
authorities of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic are included in the 
negotiating processes. 
  Attempts to resolve the Karabakh problem through talks 
between the representatives of Armenia and Azerbaijan show that, 
despite the developments over recent years, certain 
international circles have failed to grasp the essence of the 
problem. 
  Despite periodically disseminated disinformation, the 
Armenian authorities have defended and continue to defend all 
peacemaking efforts for the establishment of peace in the 
region, including those of the CSCE and Russia. This is 
revealed by the existing initiatives, the constructive stance 
shown, and positive responses by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Armenia is convinced that there is no alternative to a 
peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflict. All strong-arm 
methods to resolve the conflict are doomed to fail.

  [Text] Yerevan February 21 TASS -- Georgian Prime Minister 
Otar Patsatsia left for home today after he failed during a 
one-day visit to reach an agreement with Armenian leaders on 
disputed economic matters, a source in the Armenian Government 
told ITAR-TASS on Monday. 
  Patsatsia was received by Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan and Premier Grant Bagratyan behind closed doors. 
Although the contents of the talks were not made public, they 
apparently dealt with the problems of transporting Armenia-bound 
goods via Georgian territory. 
  Patsatia refused to sign an agreement proposed by Yerevan 
according to which Georgia should bear more responsibility in 
case natural gas supplies were cut off or limited, the source 
said. 
  Armenia receives natural gas through a pipeline passing 
across Georgia which has several times been exploded. 
  Also disturbing for Armenia is that cargo trains with wheat 
and other goods destined for Armenia come from Georgia with 
delay or are plundered while passing through its territory.

  [Text] On Friday evening Azerbaijani Defense Ministry 
reconfirmed to Interfax that an Azerbaijani military aircraft 
was brought down in the zone of the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict on February 17. 
  At the same time Baku asserts that it was MIG-21 but not 
SU-19 aircraft. According to Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, the 
aircraft was shot down not above Armenia's Vardeniz region but 
above the village of Yanshag in the north of Azerbaijan's 
Kelbadjar region. 
  Baku has no information about the fate of the pilot. 
  Earlier Armenian sources reported that Armenian air defense 
forces shot down a SU-19 fighter and captured the pilot. They 
asserted that the aircraft had violated Armenia's air space. 
  The Defense Ministry also reported that Marat Ishkenov, a 
45-year old resident of Kyrgyzstan, a retired officer, and a 
Tatar by nationality was the pilot of this aircraft. He 
allegedly reported that every month he received salary in the 
Azerbaijani army totalling $1000 and $300 per every combat 
flight.

  [Text] Baku, February 21 (TURAN) -- The situation in 
eastern Georgia for the Azeri population has become aggravated. 
According to the Georgian correspondent for TURAN, conditions 
vis-a-vis Georgia's Azeri population worsened following a 
January 30, 1994 incident when armed Armenian terrorists killed 
three Azeris in the Tezekend village in the Bolnisskiy region of 
Georgia which borders Armenia. 
  According to the same source, last week bandits attacked and 
robbed the home of Mamed Guliyev, a resident in the Gyzyl-Hajyly 
village. 
  Around the same time, unknown individuals fired at two buses 
riding along the Baku-Marneulinskiy route from a bridge over the 
Khrami River in the Marneulinskiy region of Georgia. 
  The society, "Ozan", supporting the interests of the Azeri 
community in Georgia, demanded that local authorities punish the 
criminals. Judging by the political and social conditions in 
Georgia, this appeal, like the previous ones, will not likely be 
answered.

  [Text] Moscow, 18 Feb -- The highest level of combat 
readiness was declared today in the Abkhazian Armed Forces. 
According to a report of the press service of an authorized

connection with the active regrouping of Georgian troops on the 
Georgia-Abkhazia border along the Inguri River. 
  According to the same information, early this morning the 
Coast Guard forces of Galskiy Rayon averted an attempted landing 
by Georgian assault forces. The Abkhazian Defense Ministry 
believes that there is still a danger of an incursion by 
subversive groups.

Ministers of Abkhazia: 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, 
the State Duma of the Russian Federation: 
  Highly esteemed sirs, you are well aware of Abkhazia's 
tragedy. Despite many agreements, from Sochi to Geneva, 
perfidiously violated by the Gudauta side, savage bloody orgies 
conducted by bandit units comprised of or hired by Abkhaz 
separatists, the so-called Confederation of the Caucasian 
Mountain Peoples and Cossacks still continue. With the excuse 
of fighting partisan forces, they are brutally exterminating the 
Georgian population in Gali Rayon. Dozens of villages and 
hundreds of houses have been burned down. Escaping from the 
persecutors, over 3,000 people have fled to the mountains. Of 
these, several hundred people froze and died from the cold and 
hunger. Mass killings that are being carried out with 
particular cruelty are accompanied by rape, dismemberment, 
burning, and so on. 
  The situation in the whole of Georgia is so tense that 
processes may become unmanageable and irreversible. At present, 
300,000 desperate refugees are able to take extreme and 
undesirable actions at any time and even to arm and go en masse 
to their homeland, Abkhazia [words indistinct]. 
  Therefore, if urgent and decisive measures are not taken on 
the basis of the Russian-Georgian agreements, as well as the 
United Nations' fundamental documents, tragedy will be 
unavoidable and it may be followed by a new, more large-scale 
and bloody Caucasian war, which may also involve Russia. 
  Someone must eventually bring an end to these bloody orgies 
by the extremely impertinent representatives of the separatists 
and Russian reactionary forces and their henchmen. Leaders of 
far and near abroad, and Russian leaders and members of 
parliament in particular, must know that having usurped a group 
of Abkhaz separatists in the autonomous Republic of Abkhazia, 
succeeded in provoking a war after thorough and long 
preparation. The dictatorship of Ardzinba's fascist clique is 
by no means the same as the Abkhaz people and, moreover, the 
whole multinational population of Abkhazia. 
  The world community has given an unequivocal assessment of 
the separatists' activities, regarding them as genocide, ethnic 
cleansing, and a crime against humanity. All these barbaric 
actions are happening while the world civilization is 
flourishing and ideas of humanity, democracy, and human rights 
are expanding in advanced states. 
  Highly esteemed sirs, the arrival in Georgia of an honorable 
delegation from the Russian Federation led by Boris Yeltsin and 
the signing of the historic treaty have engendered high hopes in 
the hearts of the whole multinational population of Georgia, 
especially the refugees exiled from their homes in Abkhazia who 
are suffering extreme hardship. 
  The Council of Ministers of Abkhazia appeals to you, 
esteemed 
sirs, to take decisive and radical measures for an urgent 
peaceful settlement of the conflict between the Abkhazians and 
the Georgians at last, and have the genocide and ethnic 
cleansing by the Georgian population of Abkhazia stopped, as 
well as to remove the threat to the very existence of the Abkhaz 
nation whose genetic stock is on the brink of extinction. 
  [Signed] The Council of Ministers of Abkhazia, Tbilisi

<F P=106> [Interview with Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze by Nato </F>
Oniani; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, you have been in 
touch by telephone with the White House, obviously about your 
forthcoming visit to the United States. Taking into 
consideration the complex situation -- I mainly mean the 
economic crisis and the Abkhazian problem -- what is the 
significance of this visit for Georgia? 
  [Shevardnadze] The issue of this visit has long been on the 
agenda. A number of variants have been under consideration in 
Washington regarding the most acceptable date for the United 
States and us. Last night I was informed by the White House and 
later by the Ambassador Kent Brown that the White House is ready 
to schedule this visit for 7 March and that everything pertinent 
to a visit like this must be done. [passage omitted] 
  There are countries in which we have a particular interest, 
including England and some other countries, Uzbekistan and 
certain republics of the former Soviet Union, but I think that 
by beginning these new relations with the United States and by 
preparing a legal basis we will have completed quite an 
impressive circuit from the point of view of expanding our 
political and diplomatic arena. 
  This is in general. In detail, I do not want an impression 
to be created that after the visit we will have electricity, 
sugar, and bread and we will have abundance. It never happens 
like this. But the way to this is connected with Russia as well 
as the West and the United States in particular. [passage 
omitted] This visit should become a guarantee of future active 
cooperation between Georgia and the United States and this 
cooperation will do good to every family and every citizen. 
This is the major aim of the visit. 
  [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, there is a committee in support 
of Georgia in the United States. Do you think the activities of 
the committee are limited to moral and political support, or is 
this committee involved in other activities? 
  [Shevardnadze] This is not a symbolic committee. I would 
like to point out that the committee has worked since the 
preparations for the visit started and will actively work during 
my visit. [passage omitted] Relations with the IMF and the 
World Bank are of a particular interest for me. Preliminary 
preparatory work for the meetings has been done and I think the 
U.S. Administration as well as the World Bank and IMF will 
consider the current situation in Georgia. Since we are more or 
less moving in the direction of peaceful settlements of 
conflicts and are establishing order in the country, I do not 
think we shall return emptyhanded. Guarantees resulting from 
the visit for credits, an increase of humanitarian aid, and 
concrete supplies of products or currency will apparently be 
substantial. [passage omitted] 
  [Oniani] You have said that you will have meetings at the 
IMF, at the Reconstruction Bank [as heard]. In addition, the 
press has reported that the committee in support of Georgia is 
preparing your meeting with businessmen. I think we have to 
infer that the visit in general and the meetings will have a 
link with an anticrisis program in our country. 
  [Shevardnadze] There is much talk in Georgia about 
anticrisis 
programs and ways to escape from the crisis, which mainly result 
in an implication that if the present government quits and 
another one comes in everything will be all right. I do not 
think like this. Changes can always be introduced in the 
government, into every line of power, but this will obviously be 
only a detail rather than a means to survive. 
  We have drafted a program on getting out of the crisis. I 
have said that it is an optimum program to be implemented. 
However, we are not rushing to reveal the draft program to the 
people for consideration because we have to get certain 
guarantees, not only within the country but also from the 
outside world. I was not able to present the program to our 
community until relations with Russia were settled. It can only 
be in a fairy tale that the crisis can be overcome without the 
restoration of economic links of vital importance with Russia, 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and others. This is 
one thing. 
  Second, I cannot offer the population an anticrisis program 
unless I have certain guarantees from countries like the United 
States, Germany, to some extent France, and especially the whole 
UN system with the IMF, the World Bank, the European Bank, and 
the European Union. [passage omitted] 
  As we start to develop economic relations with Russia, I 
will 
be able to offer the draft we call an anticrisis program. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Oniani] How about the Abkhazian conflict in which combat 
activities have renewed despite the intervention of the United 
Nations and other international structures? 
  [Shevardnadze] I have expressed my opinion on this issue 
several times. Indeed, Russia's role and place is indispensable 
and unique in a way. If the Russian leadership is inspired in 
the same way as we felt during President Yeltsin's visit to 
Tbilisi, these conflicts, one and the other, will be settled and 
order restored relatively soon. It does not mean, however, that 
I am not capable of assessing a role for the West. Especially 
as regards actions taken by the United Nations, the 
participation of European structures and...[pauses] I have to 
tell you that we have received the UN secretary general's reply 
to a letter Yeltsin and I sent him. It does not contain many 
promises, but I know that comprehensive work is under way, so to 
speak, in the lobby, including Washington, to work out all 
conditions. Here is the first condition: If a political process 
for a settlement starts, the deployment of international 
peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia will become more real. 
  I am positive that this will be one of the principal issues 
of our discussions. [passage omitted] I envisage that our visit 
to Washington will reveal the expediency of a visit to New York. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Oniani] Finally, Mr. Shevardnadze, do you think that this 
visit could affect Rusian-Georgian relations negatively because 
there is a certain disagreement, if I can say so, between Russia 
and the West? There really is a certain annoyance due to 
relations with Serbs. 
  [Shevardnadze] I think that your question is a reflection of 
the general feeling which may arise within our public. Even 
those who are against the improvement of our relations with 
Russia will immediately put forward this question: Shevardnadze 
is going to Washington and this is yet another mistake by him 
because it might annoy Russia. I would say that this is a 
simplified approach to serious politics. 
  You know that our Western friends' advice and 
recommendations 
-- letters from and personal conversations with Chancellor Kohl, 
the former U.S. President, and the present President -- were 
based on the idea that Georgia is to be able to establish good 
relations with Russia as soon as possible. The Russian 
leadership knows perfectly well what kind of attitude the West 
has toward Russian-Georgian relations. Then why should the more 
active development of relations between us and the United States 
cause annoyance within the Russian leadership? 
  Georgia can play a positive role not only in the CIS but 
also 
in preventing a recurrence and revival of what we used to call 
the Cold War and what the planet paid a high price for, if 
Georgia has very good relations built on a legal basis with the 
United States and other Western countries. So I cannot see any 
contradiction or foundations. 
  There will be certain speeches and certain actions in the 
State Duma or elsewhere. Our so-called friends will not miss a 
chance to pinch us, to bite us. Something like this will take 
place but, in principle, this is a natural process we have been 
following for the recent two years. I think we are gradually 
approaching what is desirable for us and are creating 
advantageous conditions in the outside situation for the 
interests of the building of our national democratic state.

  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian 
Supreme Council and head of state, met Teodor Starcevic, the 
head of the UN mission in Georgia, and supervisors of various UN 
programs today. During the conversation the issue of the Geneva 
talks on a peaceful settlement of the situation in Abkhazia, 
which are to be held under the aegis of the United Nations, was 
discussed. Also discussed was the forthcoming meeting between 
the Georgian head of state and the UN secretary general at UN 
Headquarters. 
  The Georgian head of state was informed about the results of 
the activities of the mission during the past one and a half 
years. It was emphasized that at the end of last year the UN 
mission repeated its appeal for aid for Georgia. Various 
countries have already responded to the appeal. 
  New aid programs are being drawn up. The UN mission has 
planned certain measures aimed at improving the situation in the 
spheres of shipping goods by railway, sea, and air. This will 
ensure goods are shipped without losses and safely. 
Specifically, the UN mission has purchased 10 diesel 
locomotives that will make it easy to move goods in the 
situation of severe fuel shortages not only in Georgia but also 
in Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  It was also indicated that UNICEF [UN Children's Fund] has 
drafted a long-term program for shipping baby food, shipping 
medicines for children, assisting children's hospitals, and 
immunization. 
  At the end of the meeting, Eduard Shevardnadze thanked the 
UN 
mission and its head for what has been done. He requested that 
to eliminate delays or losses of goods, private firms should be 
excluded from humanitarian activities and only state structures 
should be relied on. Shevardnadze emphasized that diesel 
locomotives purchased for the Georgian railways would eliminate 
problems not only from our country, but also from Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. 
  A letter was sent to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali 
requesting speedier UN participation in the settlement of the 
Abkhazian conflict.

  [Text] Tbilisi February 22 TASS -- Supplies of drinking 
water to homes have resumed in Georgian capital Tbilisi, and the 
city's telephone exchanges, bakeries andother vitally important 
services after a break caused by cuts in electricity supplies 
since Saturday. 
  The Tbilisi thermal power station, the main suuplier of 
electricity to the republic, is operating again, and three of 
its ten power units will soon reach their capacity output of 500 
kilowatt per hour each. 
  The director of the Tbilisi power station told ITAR-TASS 
that 
a special committe has been established to investigate the 
causes of the breakdown. It may have been caused by the 
overload of the Georgian power system, which is now cut off from 
the power systems of the neihbouring Russia and Azerbaijan. 
"This is why we cannot get hooked up to them in an emergency as 
before," he said. 
  According to the director, the three power units can operate 
now but two of them will be kept in reserve. The other seven 
are worn out and need a capital overhaul, which can hardly be 
expected to be made soon because of Georgia's severed economic 
links with other former Soviet republics.

<F P=106> [Boris Vinogradov report: "Nursultan Nazarbayev Doubts </F>
Moscow's Sincerity"] 
  [Text] At a press conference in New York Nursultan 
Nazarbayev has spoken skeptically about Russia's desire to 
conduct peacekeeping operations in the former USSR. 
  Nazarbayev did not conceal his doubts as to the "sincerity 
of 
Russia's kind feelings" for its CIS partners. The claims by 
some Moscow officials that Russia has special interests in these 
states and their bid to set up military bases there, the 
Kazakhstani leader stressed, do not inspire trust. He therefore 
proposed first looking into Moscow's real intentions in such 
countries as Georgia, Tajikistan, or Azerbaijan. 
  In President Nazarbayev's opinion, after the breakup of the 
USSR everything on Kazakhstan's territory is its property, so 
Russia has no say in the use of the scientific laboratories at 
the Semipalatinsk test range or the space installations. 
  In Washington, Nazarbayev kept himself emphatically 
independent of Moscow's policy, surprising even Bill Clinton. 
The U.S. President made an unsuccessful attempt to win his 
interlocutor over to the plan to pump Kazakhstani oil not 
through Iran and Turkey but via the Black Sea port of 
Novorossiysk. Another $85 million in backing was promised for 
this project. However, the guest stuck to his guns. Fearing 
domestic instability in Russia, he said that he prefers to have 
more reliable outlets to warm seas -- the Persian Gulf or the 
Mediterranean. 
  This involves a major contract with the U.S. Chevron company 
equivalent, according to Nazarbayev, to the "Alaskan field," and 
also a newly-created Caspian Shelf consortium to explore for and 
extract oil and gas, which includes the U.S. firm Mobil Oil. 
The Russian Foreign Ministry has already sent a protest note 
regarding the illegality of the decision to start drilling work 
on the Caspian seabed, since the other littoral countries had 
not given their assent. 
  However, there is every indication that Almaty ignored this, 
and in New York Nazarbayev once again confirmed that the highly 
promising project will be implemented. 
  En route home Nursultan Nazarbayev made a stopover in Paris, 
where he briefed Francois Mitterrand on the results of his 
successful visit to Washington. There are no plans for a 
stopover in Moscow.

  [Text] Paris February 18 TASS -- The Bosnian conflict 
should be settled by peaceful means on the strength of U.N. 
Security Council resolutions, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of 
Kazakhstan said here on Friday after his talks with President 
Francois Mitterrand. The Kazakh leader made a brief stopover 
here on his way from New York to Almaty. 
  Addressing journalists after being received in the Elysee 
Palace, Nazarbayev pointed out that his arrival in Paris 
coincided with a "critical phase" of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. "Each side should adhere to U.N. Security 
Council resolutions. If the resolutions are implemented, we 
will get every chance to arrive at a peaceful solution to the 
conflict," he emphasised. 
  Nazarbayev told journalists about the contents of his talks 
with President Mitterrand, pointing out that they considered a 
wide range of international problems, the state of affairs in 
Central Asia and CIS countries, in particular. 
  The president of Kazakhstan said "there were no divergences 
of opinion" during the talks. He said Franco-Kazakh cooperation 
develops in the proper direction, which is indicative of "a 
further strenghtening of friendly contacts between Kazakhstan 
and France." By way of example, Nazarbayev cited contracts 
concluded between the Kazakhstan Government and such large 
French companies as Elf Aquitaine, Total, Citroen, and Cogema. 
  "President Mitterrand and I agreed to give a boost to the 
functioning of the mixed economic commission set up by the 
governments of our two countries," Nazarbayev said, adding that 
the first priority task of Almaty is to strengthen bilateral 
cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises. 
  After talks in the Elysee Palace, the president of 
Kazakhsatn 
left by air for home.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Nursultan Nazarbayev by Mayra </F>
Abdrakhmanova, correspondent for the television program 
"Sharayna"; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abdrakhmanova] Tell me please, what was special 
about your visit [to Washington]? 
  [Nazarbayev] What was special was that, in comparison with 
the administration of President Bush, these are entirely new 
people, representatives of their power; young people who have 
positive ambitions, so as to make American society even better. 
And so I think that these politicians are actually working for 
the 21st century, and it was very important for me that the 
leader of Kazakhstan was able to establish normal relations and 
work in full mutual understanding. I can say bluntly that the 
United States is currently the number one state in the world, 
and its might and its resources, its economic potential, the 
scientific and technical progress there -- it is actually a 
state which holds first place in scientific and technical 
progress and in the growth of its productivity. And it was very 
important for us to establish political and economic relations, 
and to enlist the support of the United States at a difficult 
time. Moreover, I was grateful because the United States 
actively supported us, so that the donor states should support 
Kazakhstan with advantageous credits for supporting our currency 
and our reforms. I think we managed to achieve a high level of 
mutual understanding and trust in this, both with President 
Clinton and with Vice President Gore. 
  We were one of the first CIS states to have spent half a 
year 
drafting and to have signed a Charter on Democratic Partnership. 
It is a very important document. The document envisages 
partnership on issues of exchange of scientific and technical 
information, economic help, and attracting American business to 
Kazakhstan. And the most important thing is that in one of the 
clauses of the Charter it says that the United States, in the 
event of a threat to the territorial integrity of Kazakhstan and 
its borders, will take active measures to involve the entire -- 
so to speak -- system, both through the UN (?and CSCE) and in 
the framework of NATO, because we supported the recent 
initiative, "Partnership for Peace," and thus we are drawn into 
the NATO process, and so it is a very important factor now at 
the time of the formation of Kazakhstan. For example, in the 
Ministry of Defense we signed a document on participation in 
conversion of defense enterprises and allocation of money by the 
U.S. Government for problems with conversion. 
  You will have heard yourselves that the Chase Manhattan 
Bank, 
the biggest bank in New York, together with Citibank -- the 
Chase Manhattan Bank opened a fund for supporting reforms in 
Kazakhstan, and wants to attract the largest financial 
organizations to support this fund. This is very important for 
us, both politically and economically. 
  The most important thing, of course, is our mutual 
understanding on matters of the state of affairs in the CIS, in 
Central Asia, and Russia and prospects for the future of that 
region, and I came out of that conversation fully confident that 
the United States is displaying exceptional interest in 
Kazakhstan. And President Clinton said that America considers 
Kazakhstan to be one of the main states, one of the priorities 
of its policy and will continue its relations of trust with us 
both on the economic and political levels and cooperate in the 
defense sphere. We did not manage to take everything on board; 
in just one visit you cannot solve all problems. I feel the 
specific question was the fact that President Clinton and I 
decided to set up a working group which will single out all 
questions concerning the economy, finances, ecology, 
humanitarian programs, the question of training people, and 
attracting private and other investors. And this group will 
work on the whole range of questions in a brief period of time, 
and then we shall announce a new program of joint work in all 
areas.

  In his opinion, the main accord -- a charter on democratic 
partnership between Kazakhstan and U.S. -- puts bilateral 
relations on a new level in terms of quality. It contains 
guarantees of the republic's security from U.S. and Kazakhstan's 
participation in multilateral cooperation within NATO's program 
"Partnership for Peace." 
  Nazarbayev stressed that the interests of Russia had been 
taken into account in the bilateral treaty on the 
non-proliferation of missile technologies, signed not only by 
American and Kazakh representatives but also by Yuriy Koptev, 
the Russian Aero-Space Agency's Director General. 
  The president reported that his country claimed 10 percent 
of 
the $12 Bn [billion] package, provided by U.S. to compensate for 
the highly enriched uranium from the SS-18 missiles to be pulled 
out of the republic for destruction. In his words, Kazakhstan 
does not seek strategic missiles control. 
  He noted that Bill Clinton had announced that aid to 
Kazakhstan would be increased a few times over. $311 Mn 
[million] have been allocated on top of the $85 Mn, appropriated 
for silos dismantlement assistance. 
  Nazarbayev refuted rumors that while in U.S. he had 
disapproved western aid to Russia. He said "stakes should be 
made not on persons but on democratic and economic reforms in 
Russia," reforms that no one will manage to turn back. 
  He said that since Anatoliy Chubays and Aleksandr Shokhin 
were still in the Russian cabinet, it could not be regarded as 
conservative. In his opinion, Yegor Gaydar and other reformists 
could influence and help reforms in Russian parliament.

<F P=106> [By KAZTAG correspondent Konstantin Borodinov -- TASS] </F>
  [Text] Almaty February 21 TASS -- The talks with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton have determined the prospects for further 
development of bilateral relations between the United States and 
Kazakhstan, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev said. 
  Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his 
visit to the U.S. in Almaty on Monday, Nazarbayev said that "an 
agreement has been reached to take additional practical steps to 
boost them (relations) in many spheres." 
  The signing of the charter of democratic partnership between 
Kazakhstan and America ushers in a new era of cooperation 
between the two states in order to ensure peace and stability in 
the Central-Asian region, he said. 
  The Kazakh leader stressed that "not a single step has been 
taken in the new Kazakh-American agreement in violation of 
previously adopted accords with CIS countries." However, he 
noted that some recent publications distort his statements. He 
pledged to "work for the integration of the CIS." 
  "Russia has always been and remains the top priority partner 
of Kazakhstan. The republic is destined to go along with it 
towards economic and social prosperity," Nazarbayev said. 
  He said that owing to cooperation with Russia Kazakhstan 
plans to extract 50-60 million tonnes of oil annually. The 
pipeline passing trough Europe can handle only 17 million. "We 
are now studying the possibility of building a new pipeline to 
the south, to the Persian Gulf, next century," the president 
added. 
  He said that the memorandum of defence and military 
relations 
with the U.S. is "identical to that signed with Russia six 
months earlier. The same can be said about the plans concerning 
the use of the Baykonur space center only in cooperation with 
Russia, on the basis of previously adopted documents."

  [Text] President Nazarbayev held a news conference today on 
the outcome of his official visit to United States. He said: 
Talks with President Bill Clinton were the most important stage 
of the visit and determined the prospects for the development of 
bilateral relations. An accord has been reached to take 
additional practical steps in order to promote these relations 
in many spheres. Signing of the charter on democratic 
partnership between Kazakhstan and the United States means a new 
stage of cooperation aimed at ensuring peace and stability in 
the entire Central Asian region. As the result of the talks, a 
number of other documents have been signed which regulate 
contacts in the fields of science, technology, defense and 
military relations, and nuclear safety, and open up broad access 
for foreign investment in the economy of our country. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev answered numerous questions from 
journalists. He stressed that in new Kazakh-U.S. relations, not 
a single step has been taken that contradicts previous 
agreements between the CIS states. 
  This is what the president said when answering a question on 
what the United States will get from economic cooperation with 
Kazakhstan: 
  [Begin Nazarbayev recording] I tell you again -- I have been 
saying this for three years -- nobody in the world, not a single 
businessman, not a single billionaire, will give a cent to 
anyone for nothing, besides, of course technical help, 
educational help, international funds, humanitarian aid and so 
on. Any person will come here only if he will earn more than he 
is earning in America. Is this [words indistinct] in the 
transition period we have to create favorable conditions for 
them so that they will come here. We will have to lose 
something in order to gain something. Some people in our 
country sometimes say that we are selling these resources and so 
on and so forth -- every state sells what it has. Kuwait is 
selling its oil and living normally, developing production. 
Saudi Arabia is selling its oil and living normally. Iran and 
Iraq are selling their oil and living normally. What we are 
planning now is for 100 years to come. I hope that in 50 years 
mankind will find a source of energy that will not pollute the 
streets with gasoline and [words indistinct]. Japanese cars are 
using batteries already. That is why it is not right to say 
that we have to save all these minerals. Who will need them? 
We must sell what is sellable now in order to get currency and 
to develop Kazakhstan, to build up living standards for all our 
citizens. That is what we must do. [end recording]

  [Text] Almaty February 21 TASS--Russian Border Troops 
Commander Andrey Nikolayev arrived in Kazakhstan on Monday to 
discuss joint measures to reinforce state borders of the two 
countries. 
  "We want to ensure the national interests of both states on 
their outer frontiers," Nikolayev said at a meeting with Kazakh 
frontier forces senior officers. He said one of the serious 
problems to be resolved is the possibility for Russian officers 
to serve in Kazakhstan and for their Kazakh counterparts in 
Russia. About 270 border troops officers have filed 
applications requesting their transfer to Russia, according to 
the Kazakh frontier forces headquarters. 
  On December 24, 1993, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan signed a memorandum on 
cooperation to protect their outer frontiers. The memorandum 
stipulates that the protection of borders is their common task 
which should be carried out on the basis of bilateral or 
multilateral agreements. 
  If Russia and Kazakhstan iron out the existing 
disagreements, 
the talks may result in the signing of a bilateral document on 
cooperation in border protection. Nikolayev has been authorised 
to sign such an agreement by President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Speaking about the general situation in the Russian border 
troops, Nikolayev said they will number 250,000, plus 30,000 
workers and employees. At present, there are 206,000 people in 
the border troops and more 7,000 vacancies for officer positions.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 19, BNS -- Residents of the former 
Soviet military base town of Paldiski at a meeting with Estonian 
Population Minister Peeter Olesk Friday [18 February] said they 
are opposed to the government's plans to subordinate the town to 
the nearby municipality of Keila until local elections can take 
place in Paldiski itself. 
  Olesk, together with a representative of the Estonian Armed 
Forces in the town, Colonel Raul Luks, and the government's 
special representative Juri Tikk met with an audience of about 
300 Paldiski residents. 
  Participants in the meeting adopted a resolution in which 
they welcomed the government's move to register a new the town's 
legal residents. "At the same time they say Paldiski shouldn't 
be subordinated to the town of Keila for any period of time," 
Olesk said today. 
  The minister said it was unrealistic to hold early elections 
in Paldiski. Estonia left Paldiski out of the list before last 
fall's local elections, because of the large number of Russian 
military remaining there, as well as for refusal by the local 
Russian police office there to turn over the files of legal 
residents' and car registers. 
  Olesk said it was cheaper to put Paldiski under the 
authority 
of Keila than to set up a temporary governor's office in the 
town itself. 
  The government approved the plan to put Paldiski under 
Keila's municipal government on Feb. 15. The temporary scheme of 
governing is to remain effective until local elections are held 
in Paldiski.

  [Text] Raul Luks, the freshly appointed governor of 
Paldiski, a former Soviet nuclear training base in north-west 
Estonia, proved wrong rumours about a secret underwater(-land) 
submarine port in Paldiski. 
  Luks told ETA, on Thursday [17 February], that having 
investigated the whole territory of the Paldiski ports, he found 
no sign of such a base. Port specialists also assure that the 
existence of an underground port in Paldiski is "pure fantasy" 
and construction of such a base could, especially if the ground 
conditions of Paldiski were taken into consideration, have been 
impossible to hide. 
  Rumours of an underground building started when plans were 
made to build tunnels to bring cooling water for the nuclear 
reactors from the sea, which was not realized for the Baltic Sea 
was declared nuclear-free.

  [Text] Friday, February 18 -- Estonian Ambassador to the 
United Nations Ernst Jaakson announced that Estonia supports the 
ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, threatening to use air raids 
unless the heavy weapons be removed from the environs of 
Sarajevo. Jaakson admitted that the situation in Bosnia had 
deteriorated lately and pointed out the open support to the 
Serbian aggressors by some Russian political forces. 
  Jaakson expressed the Estonian views on the issues. Estonia 
does not support the ending of humanitarian aid and the 
withdrawal of the UN forces nor the ending of the economic 
sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro before the signing of a 
peace treaty in Bosnia. Estonia also supports the countries 
demanding an end to the ban on arms sale to the Bosnian Muslims, 
who represent the lawful government of Bosnia, Jaakson declared.

<F P=106> [From the "Baltic Business Weekly" feature] </F>
  [Text] The privatization of large enterprises is the main 
task the Estonian Government has to cope with this year, Prime 
Minister Mart Laar said at a meeting with foreign journalists in 
Tallinn. 
  Laar described two different ways of privatization that the 
country was now going to use. First, the state companies that 
are making a negative profit will be sold by auction, like in 
the previous stages. He added that it were the prospective 
guaranteed investments by the potential buyer rather than the 
auction price itself that was decisive in deciding to whom to 
sell. 
  In the case of successful state businesses, 49 percent of 
the 
shares are to be sold to Estonian residents for their 
privatization vouchers, while 51 percent will go to investors. 
  Estonia also faces a growingly important task to increase 
the 
pace of development in the regions now remaining outside the 
active business areas, which so far mainly comprise the 
country's capital, Tallinn, and its closest surroundings. 
  Laar said changes were needed in the situation when 90 
percent of foreign investments are coming to Tallinn. 
  The prime minister also said that the period following last 
fall's local elections had provided hope for a normalization of 
the situation in the northeastern region. The former, 
confrontation-bound local government in the region earlier 
scared off potential investors from the area, but now an inflow 
of money can be expected in the large companies of the region, 
Laar said. Immediate plans include selling the Kreenholmi 
Manufaktuur textile giant in Narva to foreign investors, 
reportedly -- Swedish. 
  As the third-important task for his government, Laar 
mentioned creating a legislative basis for business development.

  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 21, BNS -- Russia has issued an 
official protest following an incident last night when five 
armed men reportedly forced their way into a gatewatch lodge of 
the Russian air base at Amari, northwest Estonia, searching for 
weapons and later setting the lodge on fire. 
  The officer-on-duty at the headquarters of the Russian 
garrison in Tallinn and local police in the nearby town of Keila 
both confirm the incident took place at 2.45 a.m. Five men, 
some of them wearing masks, had stopped their car near the gates 
of the Russian base. 
  The assaulters had been carrying one rifle, one pistol and 
one hunting rifle. 
  The Russian senior lieutenant in charge of the guard, who 
opened the door of the guardhouse after hearing the noise of a 
car engine, received a blow at the head. The men, who then 
entered the guardhouse, asked the lieutenant and another Russian 
military in the room, a sergeant, if they had any weapons. 
After getting a negative answer, the gang ordered the two 
military out of the building and to lay on the ground with faces 
in the snow. 
  The five drove away in the same LADA-type car after pouring 
gasoline on the guardhouse and setting it on fire. Nobody was 
injured in the incident. 
  The Russian military say the men had first spoken Estonian, 
and afterwards, Russian with an Estonian accent. 
  These reports have been confirmed by the commander of the 
Russian base, Col. Mikhail Kovalyev, who declined to provide 
any further information. 
  Estonian police officials in the town of Keila said they 
will 
start investigation into the incident by first meeting the 
commander of the base. 
  Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn was called in at the Russian 
Foreign Ministry in Moscow today to receive Russia's official 
protest. 
  Officials at the Central Staff of Estonia's armed forces 
said 
they had no information so far on possible participation of 
Estonian military or the paramilitary Defense League members in 
the assault. 
  The aide-de-camp of Estonia's commander in chief, however, 
said it was surprising that Estonia was first informed of the 
incident only through Moscow, since Russian military at the 
Amari base until now had always contacted the Estonian central 
staff if any problems emerged. 
  Estonian top officials have issued no comments so far. 
  The base at Amari is the last of former Soviet air force 
bases in Estonia that remains under Russian control. Russia has 
taken away all combat aircraft from Amari, but the landing field 
there is frequently used by Russian military transport planes.

  [Text] Dushanbe February 21 TASS -- Russian and Tajik 
border guards together with the units of the 201st Russian 
division deployed in Tajikistan are engaged Monday [21 February] 
in a heavy combat with a group of Afghan and Tajik gunmen who 
had penetrated from Afghanistan. 
  According to a source in the Tajik Foreign Ministry, the 
gunmen belong to supporters of Afghan Prime-Minister Golboddin 
Hekmatyar and Tajik rebel Islamist movement led by Mullo 
Adburahim [name as received]. 
  In the morning, several frontier Tajik settlements were 
shelled with missiles launched from the Afghanistan territory. 
No casualties or damage have been reported so far.

  [Text] Russia has threatened to retaliate if Tajik rebels 
continue cross border attacks on its troops and non-combatant 
civilians. "The responsibility will rest with those who try to 
resolve controversial issues in the region by violence", head of 
the main headquarters of Russian border troops general Aleksandr 
Tymko told Interfax. 
  Amid renewed tension on the Tajik-Afghan border, two Russian 
posts came under cross border mortar and rocket fire on Monday, 
Tymko said. In a separate incident, the rebels mounted rocket 
fire on one other post on Saturday. One Russian soldier was 
injured. 
  There have been more than 50 such attacks on Russian troops 
since early this year. Agreements on an end to the attacks on 
Russian posts have failed to work on parts of the border, Tymko 
said.

  [Text] Dushanbe February 22 TASS -- Colonel-General Boris 
Pyankov, commander of joint peace-keeping forces in Tajikistan, 
described the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border as very 
complex and tense. In an interview with local television 
Pyankov said that beginning from January, armed provocations 
against Russian border guards turned into a series of "incessant 
operations." 
  According to the Russian general, the situation worsened 
because Russian border guard posts are being predominantly 
shelled from the Afghan territory, which provokes Russian border 
guards to take measures in retaliation. 
  "These provocations pursue far-reaching and dangerous goals 
- 
to involve Russian border guards in fighting directly on the 
territory of Afghanistan so as to hold Russia responsible for 
conducting military operations on the territory of a sovereign 
state," the Russian general said. At the same time, the command 
of Russian border guards in Tajikistan cannot remain indifferent 
to endless shelling of Russian border guard posts and the death 
of Russian servicemen. Beginning from January, border guard 
posts and border guard units came under intensive rocket fire 
launched from the Afghan territory 21 times. There are 
casualties among Russian servicemen and considerable material 
damage was caused to some military settlements on the border. 
  Pyankov pointed out that the Tajik irreconcilable opposition 
which stakes on military settlement of the Tajik conflict has no 
chances to win. Coalition peace-keeping forces stationed in 
Tajikistan, including Russian border guard troops, are strong 
enough to rebuff any external aggression against sovereign 
Tajikistan. Hopes pinned by the Tajik irreconcilable opposition 
on the support of the population are illusory, the Russian 
general said. 
  Pyankov pointed out that there are separate anti-government 
groups in Tajikistan, but the majority of the population do not 
support them. "People are tired of war and they welcome efforts 
made by the present Tajik leadership to stabilise the 
socio-political situation, reach civil peace and prevent another 
civil war in the republic," the Russian general said. 
  He pointed out that this should be brought home both to 
leaders of the Tajik irreconcilable opposition and certain 
military-political forces in Afghanistan who not only objected 
to the creation of bases of Tajik militants on their territory, 
but who are rendering them direct assistance in carrying out 
military operations against Tajikistan.

  [Excerpt] This weekend on the state border: A Russian 
train carrying 26 military armored vehicles crossed the 
Lithuanian state border from the Kaliningrad side on Saturday 
night. The Lithuanian border guards were not been informed 
about this train in advance. 
  Colonel Pranas Dragunaitis, head of the headquarters of the 
state protection service, told the Baltic News Service 
correspondent that the Lithuanian border guards only learned 
about the military cargo after the arrival of the train at the 
Kybartai post on the border with Kaliningrad region. The 
armored vehicles were accompanied by armed Russian servicemen 
who did not have the necessary permission issued by the 
Lithuanian Ministry of Internal Affairs to transport weapons. 
  It was decided to allow the train to cross the border so 
that 
the dangerous cargo should not get stuck near Lithuania. The 
border protection servicemen watched the train all the time to 
ensure that the armored vehicles would not detrain on the way. 
  The train with the armored vehicles left the territory of 
Lithuania crossing the Kena border post on the Belarusian border 
without incident at 0500 on Sunday. 
  According to Colonel Dragunaitis, the working group for 
negotiations with the CIS should reach an agreement with Russia 
as soon as possible on the procedure of such transit, so that no 
conflicts should arise in the future. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President of Lithuania Algirdas Brazauskas said that 
without Lithuania's consent there cannot be any uncontrolled 
military transit to the Kaliningrad region, and that no secret 
negotiations were being conducted with Russia about such an 
agreement. 
  According to the president, a draft agreement received from 
Russia last week is a new matter and the working group for the 
negotiations with CIS countries has to analyze it. 
  Speaking about the Russian military transit from Latvia and 
Estonia to Kaliningrad, President Brazauskas pointed out that it 
was necessary to help the Baltic states to have the Russian 
troops withdrawn, and for that reason the above transit should 
be kept open. This would only assist our common objectives, 
said the president.

<F P=106> [Own Correspondent Yuriy Stroganov article: "Lithuania: If </F>
You Want to Join NATO You Have to Be Worthy of It!"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- Lithuania's "testing of the soil" in 
NATO has ended with the signing of the "Partnership for Peace" 
treaty. This was one of the main ideas of the recent visit to 
Brussels by Algirdas Brazauskas, the country's president. At 
the same time the head of state stressed in particular that in 
beginning to participate in the "Partnership for Peace" program 
Lithuania's clear ultimate goal is to become a full-fledged 
member of NATO. 
  However, he said, more and more people in Lithuania are 
coming to realize that the desire alone is not enough. "We 
ourselves are obliged to create in our country not only the 
military basis for integration but also the political, economic, 
and psychological basis corresponding to the level of the NATO 
states," he stated. 
  Meanwhile time some interesting details of the visit have 
emerged. The leaders of the supreme headquarters of the armed 
forces in Europe were particularly cautious in talking about 
Lithuania's possible full membership of NATO. Lieutenant 
General Klaus Steinkopf, special adviser to the armed forces in 
Europe, called the "Partnership for Peace" program an invitation 
to take part in a common security system. He noted that this 
was the first time that NATO had gone outside the limits of its 
traditional territories to cooperate closely with other states 
in Europe. 
  Gerhard von Moltke, policy adviser to the NATO secretary 
general, said that the organization does not want a new division 
of Europe or new lines drawn on the maps. "We want to cooperate 
with Russia, Ukraine, and other states," he stressed. 
  By signing the main document of the invitation to 
"Partnership for Peace," according to its president, Lithuania 
is expressing a readiness to start work on exercising democratic 
control of its defense structures and on a process of openness 
with respect to the defense budget, joint planning, exercises, 
and maneuvers. "We are working toward the creation of 
opportunities for cooperation with NATO forces in such spheres 
as peacekeeping operations, search and rescue operations, 
humanitarian aid, and so forth," he said. "Lithuania sees its 
integration with NATO as a complex evolutionary process which 
will require great intellectual and material resources." 
  In the president's opinion, Russia's statements on its 
special interests in the neighboring foreign countries or on the 
territory of the former Soviet Union do not fully accord with 
the spirit of international law and the "Partnership for Peace." 
He is particularly alarmed by the statements on Russia's 
special interests in the Baltic states. A. Brazauskas expressed 
the view that the admission of the Baltic and other Central 
European states into the European Union and NATO would be a 
powerful incentive to economic and political reforms in those 
countries. He is convinced that this would also give 
significant support to the strengthening and continuity of the 
democratic processes in Russia. The Lithuanian leadership 
approves the Western states' efforts to help Russia implement 
its political and economic reforms and create a democratic 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Madona Luckaite on news conference at the Seimas </F>
on 21 February] 
  [Excerpt] [Words indistinct] Professor Vytautas 
Landsbergis, leader of the Seimas, speaking at the news 
conference regretted that Lithuania, as a future NATO member, 
has not voiced her position concerning the NATO initiative in 
Bosnia to stop the terrorist shelling of Sarajevo. 
  Russia wants to fortify its positions in Bosnia, therefore, 
political and diplomatic aspects of the fact that Russia is 
coming to Bosnia with its armed forces will be of great 
importance. Also, it is not yet clear if this is taking place 
with the consent of the government and president of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. So far there have been reports that Russia 
has declared its intentions to deploy its peacekeeping forces 
around Sarajevo. The statement made by the government of Bosnia 
is also known, Vytautas Landsbergis said, that they do not trust 
the Russians who are supporting the Serbs. 
  Because the military participation by (?Bosnia) in the UN 
forces has already begun it will be important to know whether 
the Russian troops coming to Sarajevo will be seen as Russian 
troops or as part of the United Nations military units. 
  This is also important to Lithuania because attempts to 
distort the history and the situation in the Baltic states are 
continuing. For example, there have been hints of this following 
the statements made by the Latvian politicians in the press 
about whether Latvia was occupied. It will not be beneficial if 
this issue has to be discussed, Vytautas Landsbergis said. In 
the meantime the danger caused by Russia has been directly noted 
by the Estonian leadership. 
  A clearer position toward the Baltic states was presented by 
the British foreign secretary in Riga. He separated the issue 
of the troops withdrawal from other issues, Vytautas Landsbergis 
said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The KURANTY editorial office has learned from 
competent sources about the release from custody in Vilnius of 
an Israeli citizen held on suspicion of complicity in the 
assassination of V. Lingis, deputy chief editor of the 
Lithuanian newspaper RESPUBLIKA. This fact is explained by the 
increased activities in Lithuania of the Israeli "Mosad" 
intelligence service. In particular, to secure the release of 
their compatriot and to neutralize possible negative reaction 
regarding Israel, this special service brought into play its 
contacts among Lithuanian parliamentarians. Publications in 
local mass media aimed at preventing a rise of anti-Israel 
sentiments in this Baltic country have simultaneously been 
inspired. Investigation into Lingis' assassination is 
continuing. 
  "Mosad" is showing heightened interest in the situation in 
Lithuania also because the press, including RESPUBLIKA, carried 
reports about the role of dummy Israeli firms in illegal arms 
deliveries to the country from abroad.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 35 (525)] </F>
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin called his U.S. 
counterpart Bill Clinton on the telephone to discuss the 
situation in former Yugoslavia. Yeltsin's press secretary 
Vyacheslav Kostikov told Interfax that the two men had "agreed 
on holding off air strikes in light of the diplomatic efforts 
being made by the Russian side in recent days." 
  According to Kostikov, the U.S. President "highly 
appreciated 
President Yeltsin's diplomatic initiative which resulted in 
defusing the crisis around Sarajevo." 
  "It was confirmed that decisions on the situation around 
Sarajevo will be made only in the framework of the UN," Kostikov 
told Interfax, and affirmed that over the short term 
consultations in search of a settlement to the Bosnian conflict 
will continue . 
  He maintained that Boris Yeltsin's Sarajevo initiative 
reduced the dangers of a crisis which threatened to engulf the 
entire world and made a peaceful resolution of the conflict a 
realistic probability. 
  This initiative, he told Interfax, scored a large diplomatic 
victory for Russia on the European and world arena. 
  "Without firing a shot or threatening anybody, or 
jeopardizing the lives of its soldiers or spending a ruble 
Russia won a major battle for its international status," 
Kostikov said. 
  "Not only did it return to the sources of its historic 
policy 
and role in the Balkans and protect Serbs, who are our kin in 
religion, culture and national spirit, Russia also showed the 
scale of its influence in Europe and the world," the press 
secretary said. 
  He said that UN and NATO diplomacy "nearly brought the world 
to the brink of a world crisis which could have developed into a 
war in which large countries would be involved." 
  Kostikov said that, unlike his opponents, Yeltsin did not 
make much noise, but showed who is the undisputed leader in 
Russia.

  [Text] Bonn February 20 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yetlsin and German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl during a 
telephone conversation at the end of last week agreed on the 
need to hold a meeting of the leaders of a number of countries 
to find a solution to the Bosnian conflict, the newspaper BILD

  The summit is expected to be attended by Yeltsin, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, and by the leaders of Britain, France, 
and Germany, the newspaper pointed out. 
  Yeltsin and Kohl also reached a consensus that the nascent 
process of the normalisation of the situation around Sarajevo 
should become a model for the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina. This 
means a truce, the withdrawal of heavy guns from the areas of 
combat operations, and control over the situation on the part of 
U.N. peacekeepers, including those from Russia.

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Feb -- (ITAR-TASS) President Boris 
Yeltsin has spoken in favor of the United Nations playing a more 
active role in the Bosnian settlement, as he stated Russia's 
point of view on the Balkan conflict in a telephone conversation 
with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, which has just taken place. 
The press service of the Russian Federation president has 
reported that Boris Yeltsin mentioned "a certain normalization 
of the situation around Sarajevo which is due, among other 
things, to the deployment of a contingent of the Russian blue 
helmets in the area." 
  The Russian president and the chancellor of the FRG said it 
was important that the states interested in a settlement in 
Bosnia should come out with political initiatives. They 
expressed a hope that concrete suggestions on developing the 
settlement process will be drawn up at the meeting of the heads 
of diplomatic departments of Russia, the European Union, and the 
United States on 22 February 1994 in Bonn. 
  According to Boris Yeltsin, Russia sees the following three 
main tasks in Bosnia: 
  - to strengthen positive developments in Sarajevo and work 
toward transferring the town to UN administration; 
  - to take measures aimed at strengthening other security 
zones in Bosnia; 
  - to achieve the signing of an agreement on peaceful 
settlement throughout Bosnia on the basis of the EC plan by 
three Bosnian sides. The telephone conversation was initiated 
by Helmut Kohl.

  [Text] The special envoy of the Russian President for 
settlement in the former Yugoslavia, Deputy Russian Foreign 
Minister Vitaliy Churkin, is sure that the Serbs will fulfil the 
promise they gave to Russia and will move heavy weapons away 
from Sarajevo. Churkin made the statement in Moscow Friday [18 
February] upon his arrival from Yugoslavia. 
  The Russian initiative has made it possible to settle the 
crisis around Sarajevo, said Churkin. 
  At the same time Churkin did not rule out the possibility of 
new problems for a political settlement around Sarajevo. Among 
them he named the likelihood of acts of terrorism. Churkin 
believes inadmissible the situation when the responsibility for 
the explosion at the Sarajevo market was immediately put on the 
Serbs. But, Churkin said, he would not like to whitewash the 
Serbs, since the Serbs launched hundreds of missiles against 
Sarajevo. 
  The second danger is that the Moslems may improve their 
positions and even launch a large-scale offensive. This danger, 
believes Churkin, is not great since this could be a challenge 
to the world community. 
  The third danger, he believes, is that some NATO officials 
think that it is necessary to hold talks and make air strikes 
simultaneously. Churkin believes this point of view is wrong 
and may break the negotiations. However, he said, the stand is 
not prevailing. 
  Churkin also denied the rumours on the possible deployment 
of 
the Russian troops in Macedonia and said that the possibility 
had not been discussed and was not on the agenda.

  [Text] Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special 
representative on the settlement in former Yugoslavia, is 
convinced that the Serbs will keep the promise they have given 
Russia to withdraw heavy weapons from Sarajevo. Churkin told 
journalists of this today in Moscow. At the same time, he does 
not rule out the possibility of new problems with regard to a 
political settlement around Sarajevo. Among these, he 
identified the likelihood of terrorist acts. 
  Vitaliy Churkin believes that the situation whereby 
responsibility for the explosion in the Sarajevo market was 
immediately laid at the Serbs' door is unacceptable. In his 
opinion, in this sort of case it is necessary to hold an 
investigation. 
  The Russian president's special representative denied rumors 
about the possible introduction of Russian troops into 
Macedonia. He said that this possibility is not being discussed 
and is not on the agenda.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, presidential special </F>
representative and deputy foreign minister, by correspondent 
Boris Kalyagin; place and date not given; program entitled: "The 
Bosnian Knot" -- recorded] 
  [Kalyagin] President Yeltsin's message has helped to change 
the situation for the better. The Bosnian Serbs have started 
the mass withdrawal of their heavy equipment from Sarajevo. In 
exchange the Russian command must transfer to Sarajevo 400 
paratroopers from its battalion, which is part of the 
international peacekeeping forces in Croatia. Russia's 
initiative has already been welcomed by France and Italy. 
  The agreement with the Serbs was achieved by Vitaliy 
Churkin, 
special representative of the Russian president and deputy 
foreign minister, who in these past few days has been plying 
continuously between Geneva, Sarajevo, Belgrade, Pale, and who 
today at last arrived in Moscow by plane. 
  [Churkin] Zagreb and Skopje also need mentioning in order to 
attain a full picture. 
  [Kalyagin] Zagreb and Skopje. So this is your first 
interview back on Russian soil. Vitaliy Ivanovich, what has 
been achieved is a real breakthrough. How, after all, did you 
manage to achieve this? 
  [Churkin] Three elements of our proposal undoubtedly brought 
a decisive influence to bear on the Serbs. First, the fact that 
Russia made a request to them. The words, request by Russia, 
made a literally stunning impression on them. Second, the fact 
that the letter which I took with me to Belgrade and Pale was 
signed by President Yeltsin. And third, the fact that this 
letter contained an obligation by the Russian side, by the 
Russian Federation, to send to Sarajevo its contingent which is 
part of the UN peacekeeping forces, so that the Serbs could have 
some guarantee for their peace of mind, and the fact that the 
new balance which is being created in the area of the city as a 
result of the withdrawal of heavy weaponry from Sarajevo, which 
the Serbs have now promised, is not upset by the actions of the 
other side. 
  [Kalyagin] Have you any misgivings that this agreement could 
all the same be violated by some provocation? 
  [Churkin] There could of course be a provocation, 
provocations. There could be some ill-considered actions on the 
part of the Army of the Bosnian Government. However, for this 
it is necessary to monitor the situation very closely. At 
present global attention is already riveted to Sarajevo. Of 
course a fairly considerable UN contingent is already there. So 
that it seems to me that this danger is nevertheless not all 
that great. Our country is ensuring that the Serbs fulfill 
their obligations. The kind of obligations we received in 
essence signify a resolution of the crisis, the crisis 
concerning Sarajevo, which in the past week has disturbed the 
entire world. Our Western partners now must do some work with 
the Bosnian Government so that it also fully observes the 
requirements which ensue from the idea of demilitarizing 
Sarajevo, which we have put forward very powerfully. 
  [Kalyagin] Could NATO strikes still take place? 
  [Churkin] I think not. However, I know that certain NATO 
officials stand by the concept, which in my view is extremely 
dangerous, of carrying out air strikes and holding talks; that 
is, they believe that air strikes must be carried out without 
fail under whatever pretext, and that this will somehow 
stimulate the talks. This is a completely absurd concept, which 
is detached from the realities of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Actions 
of this kind are certain to wreck the whole talks process. I 
think that in the present conditions, when the Russian 
initiative has not only been accepted by the Serbs, but has it 
must be said received a very good response from many 
international leaders and from many parts of the world, I think 
that the chances of such reckless actions are not very great. 
  I am very glad that the United States has now said it is 
raising its profile in the Bosnian settlement. In this way the 
prestige of the United States is now also at stake, and if a 
Bosnian settlement once again slips out of our grip, then it 
will also mean a loss of prestige for the United States. That 
leads me to think that the Americans will indeed act positively 
here. 
  [Kalyagin] So a truce has been reached: What about the next 
step? Should we not strike while the iron is hot? 
  [Churkin] The next step will be this. First, as far as 
Sarajevo is concerned, we will propose that the Security Council 
examine the problem of Sarajevo as a whole -- that is, we press 
ahead with implementing the UN administration of Sarajevo. In 
the package for a Bosnian political settlement, the sides have 
already agreed with this idea in principle. It remains for us 
to work out the details and to carry out UN administration for 
two years, as envisaged by the peace accords. Second, from the 
viewpoint of a general Bosnian settlement; an extremely good 
opportunity has now emerged to press ahead quickly toward a 
comprehensive political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 
the last few days and hours we have been in contact at the very 
highest levels with representatives of a host of key countries. 
In this respect Russia now plays a central role in this whole 
process, and I think that in the coming days and weeks one can 
expect some very important meetings and decisions in this 
sphere.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, 19 Feb -- An IL-18 plane, the undying 
veteran of our air fleet, was the most suitable vehicle for the 
Russian Government delegation as it arrived today at Belgrade 
airport, which was covered with snow and wrapped in fog. Its 
members, which include Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the 
Russian president and Russian Federation deputy foreign 
minister, and Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of 
the Russian airborne assault troops, have to tackle a number of 
practical issues relating to the redeployment of a unit of the 
Russian "Blue Helmet" battalion from the Vukovar area to 
Sarajevo. The operation is being carried out within the 
framework of Russia's initiative aimed at settling the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and at removing the threat of NATO air 
strikes on the positions of the Bosnian Serbs. 
  During its stay in former Yugoslavia the Russian delegation 
plans to see the situation at first hand and to hold talks with 
the UN forces command and the leadership of the Bosnian sides to 
get the necessary guarantees for the successful and safe 
implementation by the Russian contingent of its peacekeeping 
mission in the hottest part of the Bosnian conflict. 
  After arriving in Belgrade the commander of the airborne 
assault troops left for the Russian battalion, which had already 
started to move toward Sarajevo. After that Ye. Podkolzin and 
V. Churkin will fly on to Zagreb where the main headquarters of 
the UN forces command in former Yugoslavia is situated. On 
Sunday they will go to Sarajevo to see the situation at first 
hand and to meet the representatives of the confronting sides. 
  In an arrival statement Vitaliy Churkin stated that the 
Russian delegation's main work would be in Sarajevo, where there 
are to be talks with representatives of the sides and the local 
UN command on the tasks of the Russian contingent. We want also 
to acquaint ourselves with the progress in the withdrawal of the 
heavy weapons from the city. 
  We plan to stay in Sarajevo until the evening of 21 February 
to see that "there are absolutely no surprises," the Russian 
diplomat said, having in mind the expiry at midnight on the 20th 
of the NATO ultimatum on air strikes. 
  If snowfalls and snowdrifts prevent the Serbs from 
completing 
the withdrawal of their artillery from the city, will the NATO 
forces not use this pretext to inflict air strikes, V. Churkin 
was asked. 
  "I think that it will be simpler to ask us to resolve all 
the 
issues than to inflict strikes and undertake other reckless and 
risky steps," he replied. 
  "We are willing to give priority attention to ensuring the 
safety of our fighters in Sarajevo," the commander of the 
Russian airborne assault troops stated. "This is going to be 
one of the most important points in our upcoming conversations 
with the command of the UN troops and with representatives of 
the Bosnian sides. We want to obtain firm assurances from them 
and guarantees protecting our fighters from all surprises," Ye. 
Podkolzin emphasized. 
  One of the sides gave such guarantees without any delay. 
Army General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander who 
arrived in Belgrade especially to meet with the Russian 
delegations, said that the Russian fighters can have full trust 
in the Serb side. We are very interested in seeing the Russian 
peace-keeping contingent operate in Sarajevo and we hope that 
its presence will speed up the achievement of peace, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, deputy minister of foreign </F>
affairs, by unidentified Ostankino Television correspondent in 
Moscow on 19 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Churkin] The Serbs were greatly impressed by three 
elements in the Russian proposal. First of all, it was Russia's 
request to the Serbs to withdraw heavy weaponry from Sarajevo. 
Second, it was the circumstance that the letter was signed by 
President Yeltsin. Third, it was the fact that it was not just 
words, but that the proposal and the president's signature were 
backed by Russia's pledge to send Russian servicemen to Sarajevo 
in the UN peacekeeping contingent. 
  [Correspondent] Vasiliy Ivanovich, what about the ultimatum? 
Does it still remain in force, or it can be said that NATO will 
revise its decision? 
  [Churkin] I do not know what this ultimatum is in general. 
We are not members of NATO. It is UN troops that are in 
Sarajevo, not NATO ones, and it is the resolutions of the 
Security Council that are operating there. I refuse to take 
into account any time periods or any other elements of any sort 
of ultimatums. The countdown in Sarajevo now starts from the 
moment when on Thursday at 1600 the Serbs said that they agree 
to the Russian proposal and are grateful to Russia that it put 
forward so bravely and energetically its proposal for the 
de-blocking of the Sarajevo crisis. 
  [Correspondent] NATO's decision has permitted some reviewers 
to come to the conclusion that for the first time in recent 
years a crisis has developed between the young democratic Russia 
and its partners in the Western alliance, if not a split. 
  [Churkin] I think that there has been no crisis or split as 
yet. There was a certain episode, a serious one, but one should 
not dramatize it too much because we are only just learning to 
carry out equal partnership relations with each other. This 
episode might turn into a crisis if, in spite of the Russian 
initiative, NATO takes some kind of reckless, precipitate action 
that would lead to an exacerbation of the situation in Sarajevo. 
Well, if somebody made a sudden decision -- and there are 
people who feel this way in NATO I can say quite frankly -- to 
carry out air strikes in the area of Sarajevo, then, indeed, we 
would be faced with a crisis, but for the time being I proceed 
from the fact that the crisis around Sarajevo will be overcome 
on the basis of the Russian initiative and we and the NATO 
states will thus acquire, as a result of this episode -- 
although it is serious -- important experience in how to build 
relations with one another.

  [Text] Belgrade February 20 TASS -- "The bombardment of 
positions of Bosnia Serbs would seriously undermine the peace 
process, creating a qualitatively new situation, impeding peace 
talks," said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin at 
a news conference in Sarajevo, cautioning against the 
consequences of NATO's plans which still remain in effect. 
  Churkin expressed hope that in the long run, a peaceful 
approach to the solution of the problem will prevail. He 
pointed out that air raids do not meet the interests of the 
North Atlantic Alliance. 
  In Churkin's opinion, a ceasefire agreement is currently 
being observed better than ever during the recent two years. 
"Weapons withdrawn from their positions pose no threat to 
Sarajevo and control over the situation must be entrusted to 
U.N. peace-keepers," Churkin said. 
  He pointed out that the Russian battalion of Blue Helmets 
which arrived in Sarajevo on Sunday, would be stationed in the 
city between Serbian and Muslim residential areas. "Russia is, 
undoubtedly,concerned over the safety of its servicemen," 
Churkin pointed out. 
  According to the Russian diplomat, a ceasefire and 
withdrawal 
of heavy weapons should be the first step on the way to 
establishing the U.N. control over Sarajevo.

  [Text] Zagreb, 21 Feb -- Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Churkin, the Russian president's special representative, had 
discussions in Sarajevo on Sunday [20 February] with 
representatives of the Bosnian Serb political and military 
leadership on issues connected with implementing the pledge they 
undertook at Russia's request to withdraw heavy weapons from the 
city or to surrender them to UN control. Churkin stated this in 
a telephone interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  At meetings between the Russian diplomat and Yasushi Akashi, 
the UN Security Council's representative in the former 
Yugoslavia, and General Michael Rose, commander of UN forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina emphasis was put on the possibility of 
maintaining the calm in Sarajevo that has been achieved in 
recent days. 
  In a conversation with Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija 
Izetbegovic, Churkin stressed that the Russian battalion that 
arrived in Sarajevo on 20 February would carry out its duties 
honorably and objectively within the UN mandate. He urged the 
Bosnian leader to do everything necessary to rule out any 
unfriendly acts against the Russian troops. 
  The situation in Sarajevo is calm and there is no cause for 
aggravating the situation, the Russian president's special 
representative concluded.

  [Text] Belgrade February 21 TASS -- Speaking in Sarajevo 
after a meeting with members of the Bosnian Serb leadership, 
devoted to the demilitarisation of the city and the peace-making 
mission of the Russian "Blue Helmets", who have arrived there a 
short while ago, special representative of the Russian President 
Vitaliy Churkin said that the Serbian side was observing the 
agreement to withdraw its heavy guns and to place them under 
U.N. control. 
  "We have reached agreement on further joint efforts to turn 
Sarajevo into a peaceful city. This is the most important task 
today," Churkin stated. 
  The possibility of perpetuating the tranquility in Sarajevo, 
achieved in recent days, was stressed during the Russian 
diplomat's meetings with Yasushi Akashi, representative of the 
U.N. secretary- general in former Yugoslavia, and General 
Michael Rose, commander- in-chief of the U.N. forces in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina. 
  On the same day, Churkin told Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of 
the presidium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, that the Russian 
battalion, which arrived in Sarajevo on february 20, would 
honestly and objectively discharge its duties in accordance with 
the U.N. mandate. He urged the Bosnian leader to do everything 
possible to rule out any unfriendly actions against Russian 
servicemen. 
  Churkin stated that the situation in Sarajevo was calm and 
that there were no reasons for its escalation. 
  In the meantime, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told 
local journalists in Sarajevo that the Bosnian Serb intelligence 
possessed information about a new spate of provocations that is 
now being hatched by the Muslim side. 
  He said that some Muslim combatants, clad in Serbian 
uniforms, were planning to attack the "Blue Helmets". Several 
bodies, dressed like Serbs, are to be left on the spot of the 
clash so that responsibility for the attack could be blamed on 
the Serb side. 
  "We can expect a series of terroristic acts in the near 
future, like the ones we have witnessed in the Lebanon," 
Karadzic noted. 
  The Bosnian Serb government also noted in its statement the 
possibility of provocations "from the Muslim or some other third 
side". It urged foreign journalists "to avoid premature 
conclusions and instigatory calls against the Serbian side."

<F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb, 21 Feb -- "The danger of air strikes against 
Sarajevo has essentially been lifted at the current stage, 
although the possibility of major provocations and adventurist 
sorties has not been completely ruled out." This was stated in 
an exclusive interview given to ITAR-TASS by Vitaliy Churkin, 
special representative of the president of the Russian 
Federation and deputy foreign minister, at Zagreb airport today 
on his return from the Bosnian capital. 
  "The Serbs are firmly observing the promise they gave to 
Russia, their heavy guns have been either withdrawn or brought 
under UN control, and the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] 
leadership has no complaints about them. The questions raised 
yesterday by the Russian side with the command of Bosnian Serbs 
were solved on the spot, and relevant orders were given and 
executed in our presence," the Russian diplomat said. 
  Commenting, at an ITAR-TASS correspondent's request, on the 
statement by Ejup Ganic, vice president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, to the effect that some hours 
before the NATO ultimatum expired 40 to 50 percent of the Serb 
heavy guns remained in their former positions, the Russian 
president's special envoy said: "Among the Muslim figures there 
are people who are making nervous and sometimes irresponsible 
statements. The figure of 40-50 percent is unrealistic. An 
insignificant number of Serb heavy guns have indeed remained, 
but they are dispersed across the eight areas allocated for this 
purpose. But these heavy guns have been declared to the United 
Nations and are under its control. Some of these guns are 
simply out of order, the rest have been made incapable of 
immediate military use. UNPROFOR has no complaints to the Serbs 
regarding these armaments", Churkin stressed. Today our 
battalion starts performing its new duties in the capital's 
district of Grbavica along the disengagement line. This is a 
difficult area of Sarajevo, where French "blue helmets" too are 
performing the peace-making mission, he said. 
  V. Churkin noted that the Russian delegation received "all 
the necessary assurances" from Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency 
President Alija Izetbegovic "that there will be no kind of 
provocations and additional complications for our soldiers." In 
a short speech for the press Izetbegovic yesterday stressed that 
"the Russians have come as friends." As regards the Serb 
population in the areas surrounding Sarajevo, then, in the words 
of the diplomat, it has received the Russian servicemen "very 
well and even enthusiastically." "The very presence of the 
Russian 'blue berets' is calming and stabilizing the situation 
in Sarajevo," he said. 
  Commenting on Russia's attitude to the meeting commencing in 
Bonn tomorrow of representatives of the foreign ministries of 
Russia, the United States, and EC member states, which will 
proceed with the involvement of a UN delegation, V. Churkin 
described it as an "important diplomatic if not political 
event." "Such a meeting is taking place for the first time 
after overcoming the crisis in Sarajevo, and in my view this is 
a move to a new level of unity in the efforts of key members of 
the international community in settling the Bosnian problem. We 
are preparing for this meeting and hope that it will be followed 
by meetings at a higher level. Overcoming the crisis in Bosnia 
will make it possible to energetically complete a settlement in 
Bosnia as a whole," he concluded. 
  On the same day, V. Churkin flew to Bonn to take part in the 
forthcoming meeting of high-ranking officials.

IZVESTIYA under the general heading "Russian Diplomacy Spares 
NATO the Use of Force in Bosnia and Gives Serbs a Chance"] 
  [Text] Belgrade -- The mission of Vitaliy Churkin, the 
Russian President's special representative at the talks on the 
former Yugoslavia, has ended in success. The Bosnian Serbs have 
agreed to fulfill Russia's request and withdraw the heavy 
weapons from Sarajevo as quickly as possible in the interests of 
ending the bloodshed. 
  The Russian battalion will advance to Sarajevo if the 
Bosnian 
Serbs keep their word. That is stipulated in Boris Yeltsin's 
message to Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, and also 
sent to Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, other 
Serb leaders, and the Serbian people. 
  Although Serbia is not taking part in the Bosnian war, 
according to the assurances of its leaders, it is no secret that 
the Bosnian Serbs could hardly have achieved military 
superiority and territorial advantages without Belgrade's 
support. 
  Can Moscow's latest gesture be called a slide toward a 
"pro-Serbian position?" Today's breakthrough by Russian 
diplomacy is a logical and consistent continuation of its 
Balkans policy, which has done far more good than the actions 
and statements of any other Russian organ, party, or grouping. 
  The military from various countries operating as UN 
peacemaking forces in the Bosnian war are well aware that so far 
not a single agreement has been fulfilled here and not a single 
cease-fire agreement has held for long. As for what will happen 
this time, we shall find that out on Monday -- the day that the 
NATO ultimatum expires. 
  The Russian president's message makes no mention of how far 
the artillery and tanks should be withdrawn, it speaks only of 
the "earliest possible deadline" for the withdrawal, and it is 
that aspect which is now the cause of disagreement between the 
participants in the conflict and the blue helmets. General Sir 
Michael Rose, the British commander of the blue helmets in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, is categorical: The condition that heavy 
weapons be withdrawn 20 km from the center of Sarajevo must be 
fulfilled. At the moment, however, it is not being observed. 
  Even now, when an unusual calm is reigning in Sarajevo, you 
can hardly call the Russian airborne forces' new place of 
deployment a holiday camp. The Muslim side stated immediately 
that it is not ecstatic about the contact between the Russians 
and the Serbs. In addition, Vitaliy Churkin has stressed that 
if the accords are violated and any of the Russian soldiers or 
any other country's servicemen are placed in danger air support 
[aviatsia] will immediately be summoned to their aid. 
  Even if things work out well, the resolution of the crisis 
around Sarajevo is an important step but only the first step 
toward ending the war and achieving a political settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
