  [Text] Two working groups to develop drafts of the final 
document and agreement on refugees have been formed at the third 
round of the Georgian-Abkhazian negotiations underway in Geneva, 
the press center of Abkhazia's plenipotentiary representative to 
Russia reported to INTERFAX. 
  According to the press center, leader of the Georgian 
delegation Jaba Ioseliani accused the Abkhazian side of waging 
"ethnic cleansing" in Abkhazia's Gali Region and said that "the 
Abkhazians respect only the language of force." He expressed 
doubt with respect to further continuation of the negotiations. 
Leader of the Abkhazian delegation Premier Sokrat Dzhindzholia 
rejected Ioseliani's assertions and called them "insulting." 
  Meanwhile, member of the Georgian delegation Irakly 
Makhavariani reported in his interview with the Georgian TV on 
Thursday [24 February] that two days of the negotiations were 
fruitless. In his words, the parties are coordinating the 
document to return refugees to Abkhazia. Machavariani pointed 
out that the parties occupy controversial positions on this 
issue, that's why "it is difficult to find common approaches." 
  He did not rule out that negotiations to be concluded 
February 24 would be continued on February 25 because, to quote 
Machavariani, "there is a certain advance in the position of the 
Abkhazian party."

  [Text] We had a telephone conversation today with Irakli 
Machavariani, a member of the Georgian delegation at the Geneva 
talks on settling the Abkhazian conflict. He reported that the 
Abkhazian party had put forward a concept of Abkhazia's legal 
statute that is absolutely unacceptable for Georgia. It 
stipulates "not even a confederative restructuring within the 
frame of an integral Georgia but rather a form of a treaty much 
more resembling relations between two neighbor states, in 
addition, rather cool." 
  Machavariani particularly pointed out that the Abkhazian 
party behaves as a "victor" in the light of recent events in 
Gali Rayon and this causes extreme aggravation in the atmosphere 
of the talks. 
  However, said Machavariani, representatives of the world 
community and Russia at the talks keep backing an idea of 
Georgia's territorial integrity and in this respect their 
position is quite close to that of Georgia. This permits us to 
pin hopes on reaching a certain consensus while handling the 
problem. 
  According to Machavariani, a concluding sitting will be held 
tomorrow, when the work carried out at the talks will be summed 
up.

  [Text] As is known, the third round of Abkhaz-Georgian 
talks is under way in Geneva. A statement made by the Georgian 
delegation at the talks says in particular: 
  Georgia is in a worse situation at the start of the third 
round of talks on the large-scale settlement of the Abkhazian 
conflict than it was during the second. Thousands of civilians 
in Gali Rayon have been driven out of the region. Hundreds of 
houses have been burned down. Hundreds of people have been 
killed, frozen, or injured. Representatives of the Gudauta 
regime made absurd statements at the Moscow talks of experts on 
Abkhazia's political statute within Georgia, thus making 
ineffective all efforts made by the group of experts to 
accomplish their task constructively. 
  Having seen that Russian-Georgian relations are turning to a 
new stage and that this will result in the stabilization of the 
situation in the whole Caucasian region, Gudauta separatists did 
everything they could to prevent the signing of the treaty on 
friendship, good-neighborliness, and cooperation between Russia 
and Georgia. The moment the treaty was signed and was welcomed 
by the whole world, Abkhaz armed gangs, together with 
mercenaries, launched a large-scale operation on driving the 
remaining Georgian families out of Gali Rayon. On the very day 
-- on 3 February 1994 when the Russian-Georgian treaty was 
signed -- Abkhaz forces armed with heavy equipment burned down a 
number of villages in Gali Rayon. It should be emphasized that 
the Gudauta authorities did not allow representatives of the UN 
mission in Sukhumi to enter the area of punitive operations. 
  This convinces us that realizing that the state of affairs 
is 
driving toward the unconditional elimination of the regime and 
that they will not be able to prove the logical concept of the 
separatist and fascist regime they had established against the 
territorial integrity of Georgia, the Gudauta authorities are 
using the policy of a completed fact. 
  Will this challenge to, not only Georgia but also the whole 
world community continue? How many resolutions should be taken 
by the UN Security Council to convince the Gudauta separatists 
to rethink themselves. 
  We highly appreciate efforts taken by Edouard Brunner, the 
UN 
secretary general's personal envoy. It was due to his efforts 
that a certain success was reached at the talks. A constructive 
policy by the Russian delegation was also positive during the 
drafting of important documents. But the time has come for more 
vigorous activity. 
  We appeal to the United Nations Organization to seek 
effective means to end the suffering of hundreds of thousands of 
people. The Gali events convinced us that all negotiations are 
only used as screens by the Gudauta regime. We cannot 
participate in this sort of development. This would encourage 
Abkhaz separatism. Every negotiation should be based on trust, 
but this very trust and hope of the Abkhazian side's goodwill 
has been eliminated. The development of events demonstrates 
that Abkhaz separatists respect and recognize only the language 
of force.

  [Text] At a news conference at Reiterna House today, 
Latvian State President Guntis Ulmanis indicated that Polish 
President Lech Walesa's visit to Latvia has helped to open a 
political door for the parliament of our country, the executive 
power, and other institutions to enter. Guntis Ulmanis related 
that during the meeting with Walesa they also discussed 
bilateral cooperation between the two countries on a European 
scale, as well as issues related to the process of the 
withdrawal of the Russian Army and the Skrunda radar station. 
  Problems concerning minorities in Latvia have also been 
discussed. Latvia has to look for grounds to prevent it from 
being accused of ethnic cleansing and violation of human rights. 
During the talks, cooperation between the two countries in 
defense, trade, and the economy was also examined. The Latvian 
president noted that it would be necessary for representatives 
of the ministries of foreign affairs and the councils of 
ministers of the two countries to meet in the near future. The 
Latvian and Polish prime ministers will have to meet to conclude 
a cooperation agreement between the two countries. 
  Polish President Lech Walesa for his part told the news 
conference that the heads of the two states take the same 
approach on the most important issues, therefore, it is possible 
to tackle many problems together. Walesa stressed that Latvia 
and Poland also have a common mission in guaranteeing security 
and welfare in Europe. 
  Speaking of the influence of Russian foreign policy on 
European security, the Latvian president explained that on the 
one hand it is a megaphone policy, especially in relation to the 
countries which were once parts of the USSR, but on the other 
hand, it is Russia's real policy. Ulmanis added that in the 
event that the policy set forth in Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev's speeches is implemented, the Baltic countries 
will be directly threatened. Guntis Ulmanis expressed the 
opinion that Russia's attitude toward the NATO Partnership for 
Peace program is not clear either, because on the one hand 
Russia apparently supports it, but on the other, Russia's action 
in that direction cannot be seen.

  [Text] Poland and Latvia have similar views on issues most 
important to both countries. This was stated at a news 
conference of the Polish and Latvian presidents in Riga. 
  According to President Guntis Ulmanis, Poland as the largest 
country in the region could become a guarantor for the unity of 
the Baltic states. Imperial voices in Russia pose a real 
threat, it was said at the conference. 
  Asked to comment on Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev's 
statement that the states of Central Europe should consider 
their aspirations toward NATO, Lech Walesa replied: We have 
already done that. I suggest Kozyrev should consider it and not 
hamper our intentions. 
  According to Walesa the West does not know about a large 
concentration of Russian troops in Kaliningrad Oblast. One has 
to ask publicly, what purpose is it serving, how much does it 
cost and who is threatened by it. 
  During his visit to Riga, President Walesa today visited the 
Latvian Saeima and met its speaker. He also continued talks 
with the Latvian president and met Latvian defense and foreign 
affairs ministers.

  [Text] Today, on the second and last day of his visit, 
Polish President Lech Walesa met the Saeima Chairman Anatolijs 
Gorbunovs. After talks, the distinguished guest addressed the 
Saeima deputies. Walesa pointed out that the visit had fulfilled 
its purpose, because it had once again affirmed the diplomatic 
relations between the two countries, giving a sincere and 
friendly character to the official declarations. The Polish 
president noted that there is much in common in the histories of 
Latvia and Poland. Both countries fell victim to the brutality 
of Hitler and the Soviet Union. Walesa noted that the Polish 
Government in exile, the legitimate representatives of the 
nation, never recognized the annexation of Latvia. 
  Addressing the Saeima deputies, the Polish president noted 
that the two countries are currently solving similar problems of 
a political, economic, and social nature. Mutual cooperation by 
the two countries can assist in solving Latvia's economic 
problems. Walesa noted with satisfaction that the authorities in 
the Republic of Latvia have guaranteed the Polish minority the 
opportunity to develop undisturbed and preserve their national 
qualities. For this, I want to express here in your parliament 
my sincere gratitude. 
  The Polish president expressed the hope that his visit will 
help to create all-round cordial relations between Poland and 
Latvia. 
  Afterwards, a speech in response was made by Saeima Chairman 
Anatolijs Gorbunovs: 
  [Begin Gorbunovs recording] Highly esteemed president of 
Poland, I wish to thank you for your address. I think that I 
express the thoughts of the deputies as well in declaring my 
satisfaction that you, highly esteemed president, have during 
your visit attended the Saeima of the Republic of Latvia. I 
especially wish to pay my respects to you, because your name is 
undeniably inscribed in the recent history of the 
transformations in Europe. We know that the processes that at 
present seem objective and inevitable, at the time, for the 
initiators of these transformations, demanded very much. At 
that time, Polish Solidarity, under your leadership, boldly 
showed the way that had to be undertaken by the other countries 
of Central and Eastern Europe. No less responsibility rests upon 
us today, when along with painful economic reforms, countries 
that recently returned to the company of free nations are 
seeking a way to stand together with the big developed countries 
on the map of common European security. All the more so because 
Latvia, like Poland, is conscious of being fully entitled to be 
a shaper of the new democratic Europe today and in the future. 
We fully concur with the idea expressed by you, Mr. President, 
that we must cope with the demands posed by the new times and 
the new situation in Europe. As Latvia is step by step being 
connected to the circuit of Europe, we see in Poland one of our 
closest partners. With great attention we have been following 
your country's experience of political and economic reforms, and 
what you have achieved has given us great hope. Let me wish 
success to you, to the whole Polish nation, in realizing those 
aims that you put forward on the way to prosperity, peace, and 
security. May your visit to Latvia serve the growth of our 
nations and our countries. [end recording] 
  That was the speech in response to the Polish president by 
Saeima Chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs.

  [Text] Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs in an 
interview on Thursday [24 February] that at present there are no 
international guarantees for Latvia's security if an agreement 
is concluded on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia by 
31 August. Andrejevs explained that Latvia can only rely on the 
gentlemanly behavior of the countries and organizations that 
have given advice in supporting Latvia if, as a result of 
concluding the agreement, Latvia's security is somehow 
threatened. 
  Andrejevs added that at present even the governing coalition 
is not fully unanimous as to whether such an agreement would be 
profitable to Latvia. Therefore the discussion on this theme is 
still continuing. Besides, Latvia will not conclude the 
agreement if Russia does not back down on the issue of the 
social provision for Russian military pensioners, added 
Andrejevs. 
  Speaking of the decision of the Russian State Duma on 
amnesty 
for participants in the unrest of 1991, Andrejevs emphasized 
that this question is an internal Russian problem. But in the 
longer term, it could strengthen the hand of the extreme radical 
and conservative wings in Russia, which would not be favorable 
to Latvia. Thus the potential danger grows, added Andrejevs. 
Besides, such a resolution also shows the balance of power in 
the Russian State Duma.

  [Text] Riga, February 24, LETA -- The President of Latvia 
Guntis Ulmanis has accepted the resignation of his Press 
Secretary Anta Busa. During the news conference at the cabinet 
of minister he said that "Anta has commited a number of 
inaccuracies which cannot be made good by any other means". 
  The resignation of the president's press secretary is 
directly linked with her comments in the telephone interview to 
Martins Kibilds, a reporter of the daily "DIENA". He asked Busa 
to comment on president's response to the protest voiced by the 
Latvian Russian-language press due to the fact that the 
President Guntis Ulmanis had donated to the Latvian schools 
books by Adolfs Silde. It turned out that during the Nazi 
occupation Silde had published anti-semitic articles hailing the 
massacres of Jews. 
  The answer Kibilds got from the press secretary was the 
following exclamation: "It would be better if the Jews could 
finally leave us alone. We have trembled and knelt before them 
long enough. It should be stopped once and for all." 
  In the interview to the Latvian Radio Busa said that she was 
forced to tender her resignation because the ruling party, the 
Latvian Way, was worried about her influence on the president as 
well as the increasing role of the president in the political 
life of Latvia. Busa said that her persecution was inspired 
directly by the Minister of Special Tasks Edvins Inkens. Inkens 
in his turn remarked that none of the ministers would be able to 
interview as Busa had said.

  [Text] St. Augustin, Germany February 24 TASS--Yegor Gaydar 
described the "memorandum of accord" adopted by the majority of 
the State Duma on Wednesday as a resolution towards escalation 
of tension in Russia, destabilisation of state authority and 
creation of prerequisites for civil war. The leader of Russia's 
Choice parliamentary faction spoke here on Thursday at a 
colloquium "the Future of Reform in Russia" organised by the 
Konrad Adenauer Foundation. 
  Gaydar said special anxiety is caused by the fact that under 
the decision of the State Duma not only politicians involved in 
plots and coups but also such characters as Barkashov, Anpilov, 
Terekhov and their associates will be absolved of 
responsibility. "I do not have the slightest doubt that upon the 
release from custody these people will resort to their former 
activity and will exert every effort to destabilise the 
situation and unleash bloody clashes in Moscow again on May 1 
and 2, 1994", Gaydar said. He believes that chances for calm 
democratic development in Russia decreased considerably and 
Russian democracy is threatened.

  [Text] Moscow February 25 TASS -- The State Duma (lower 
house of the Russian parliament) adopted an address on Friday to 
the Russian president, as the guarantor of the Russian 
Constitution, requesting him to use his powers to ensure 
constitutionality during the election campaign to bodies of 
state authority in member republics of the Russian Federation 
and to bodies of local self-government. 
  The Duma's address to the president was prompted, above all, 
by concern over facts of discrepancy between this process and 
provisions of the Russian Constitution and the lack of adequate 
control over the observation of legality from federal bodies of 
power. 
  Lawmakers were especially concerned over violations of 
voting 
rights of citizens in legal acts adopted by bodies of state 
power in member republics of the Russian Federation, infringing 
on the principles of equal suffrage and restricting the 
participation of citizens and their associations in the election 
campaign as well as over violations of the principle of openness. 
  The Duma's address was also sent to parliament's upper 
chamber, the Russian Government, bodies of state authority in 
member republics of the Russian Federation, the Russian 
procurator-general and the Russian Central Electoral Commission. 
The address calls on them to take measures "to implement 
successfully new state construction in Russia by concerted 
efforts of all interested sides".

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 38 (528) by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] President Mircea Snegur has said he will take all 
measures so that the forthcoming parliamentary elections 
February 27 pass democratically with the entire republic's 
population taking part. At the meeting in Chisinau Wednesday 
with the U.S. Ambassador Mary Pendleton he said that only a 
competent and constructive parliament may further develop the 
process of reforms, whose success will elevate the living 
standards of the population. 
  A spokesman for the president has told Interfax that the 
head 
of state voiced confidence that the problem of Transdniester 
could be solved if the region is granted the special legal 
status. Snegur said that President Yeltsin had said about the 
preparedness to be a mediator at the talks to settle the 
conflict on the basis of recommendations by the CSCE standing 
mission. 
  Snegur has confirmed his intention to propose to the new 
parliament bills on granting a special status for the region of 
the left bank of the Dniester and for that densely populated by 
the Gagauz people. 
  Less than one thousand Transdniestrians took part since the 
beginning of the week in the parliamentary elections in Moldova. 
According to Snegur's decree, inhabitants of the Transdniestrian 
Republic are allowed to vote on February 21-27 at the polling 
stations on the right bank of the Dniester. 
  A spokesman for the Central Election Commission has told 
Interfax, the authorities of the Transdniestrian Republic put no 
serious obstacles to the people living on the left bank. The 
Central Election Commission explains the low activeness of 
voters by the shortage of transport for carrying people from the 
left to the right bank, as well as by the fact there is still 
time for taking part in the voting.

  [Text] Chisinau February 24 TASS--Moldovan opposition 
parties favouring unification with Romania received, in defiance 
of law, financial assistance from Bucharest for their 
campaigning ahead of the February 27 parliamentary elections, a 
leader of Moldova's Agrarian Democratic Party, Nicolae Andronik, 
claimed here today. 
  According to him, once being launched, the election campaign 
has been marred with gross irregularities of the election law 
banning any assistance from abroad to parties running for the 
forthcoming elections. In particular, Andronik said, at the 
polling station in the village of Varnica, which opened a week 
earlier for voters of Moldova's breakaway Dniester region, the 
local administration head instructed residents how to vote for 
opposition parties. 
  Moldovan parliamentary chairman Pyotr Luchinskiy expressed 
regret that the election campaign is blemished with breaches of 
law and ethic norms by the opposition, "which seeks to regain 
its popularity by these means". He did not rule out that the 
Central Electoral Commission largely consisting of 
representatives of opposition parties would not approve voting 
results if Moldova's Agrarian Democratic Party won the elections. 
  In this case, Luchinskiy stressed, the Supreme Court will 
have the final say. And the court has already cancelled the 
ruling by the Central Electoral Commission not to open polling 
stations in Gagauz-dominated areas for fear that residents there 
might vote for the Agrarian Democratic Party.

  [Text] Groznyy February 24 TASS -- Georgian ex-President 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia was buried on Thursday in the Russian 
break-away Republic of Chechnya. The funeral ceremony was 
attended by Chechen President General Dzhokhar Dudayev. 
  Georgia's first popularly-elected president was buried on 
the 
territory of his residence in Groznyy, where he spent most of 
his political exile after being toppled in January 1992. 
  Last autumn, Gamsakhurdia returned to western Georgia in a 
quest to restore his presidential status, but his supporters 
were ousted from Georgia by the Army, which stood loyal to the 
existing Tbilisi government of Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  Gamsakhurdia then reportedly took his life after being 
cornered by his enemies in a west Georgian village. 
  Last Thursday, Gamsakhurdia's body was exhumated and 
air-lifted to Groznyy from western Georgia, where it had been 
temporarily buried in a secret place under a village barn by his 
close lieutenants. It was reburied here in conformity with the 
will of his next of kin. As Gamsakhurdia's widow Manana put it, 
the funeral in Tbilisi "would be most likely used by his enemies 
in their political aims." 
  So Gamsakhurdia was finally buried with full military 
honours 
and now rests in peace. But for how long? His relatives and 
supporters join in the hope that the time will come when the 
remnants of the president are buried with all due honours in his 
motherland.

  [Text] Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev has again accused 
Moscow of a desire to destabilize the situation in his republic, 
namely of provoking opposition forces for anti-government 
disturbances. He described such Russian attempts as futile and 
said that the Chechen leadership controls the situation in the 
republic. Dudayev warned of a fair punishment for all 
encroachments against the Chechen people. 
  Dudayev addressed a news conference on Wednesday night in 
Groznyy following the commemoration devoted to the 50th 
anniversary of the deportation of the Chechen people. We shall 
not forget 600,000 victims of deportation and 40,000 of those 
who died in the Great Patriotic War, he said. 
  The Chechen president welcomed the Russian Duma's resolution 
on political amnesty of those involved in the developments of 
1991 and 1993 and called it a "just" action. At the same time, 
Dudayev voiced doubt that the amnesty would be fulfilled. 
  Answering the questions about the fate of the Georgian 
ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who shot himself dead in the 
early hours of January 1, 1994, Dudayev noted the valuable role 
he played in the social and political life of Georgia and the 
Caucasus as a whole. Dudayev said that Gamsakhurdia acted in a 
noble way when he understood that further struggle would lead to 
a national catastrophe in Georgia and decided to commit suicide.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev by </F>
Mayak Radio correspondent Ilyas Latypov; place and date not 
given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Latypov] From the very beginning it was clear that 
the reaction to the Russian-Tatarstan treaty from various 
circles, both in Moscow and Kazan, would not be unequivocal. 
Talking to journalists, you said you were receiving much 
response to the treaty. What are people writing and saying to 
you? 
  [Shaymiyev] An absolute majority of the population expresses 
gratitude for signing the treaty. People regard it as a 
guarantee of peace and stability; mind you, we never had any 
destabilization between people in the past, but the treaty gives 
them more confidence. 
  I would like to mention in particular the fact that we are 
receiving a lot of letters and telephone calls from the Tatar 
diaspora who are living in CIS countries as well as Russia. 
They are saying that we have taken a great burden of 
uncertainty off their shoulders. Certainly, the fact that the 
treaty clarified and dotted all the "i"s in our relations with 
the Russian Federation gives us confidence in our future. 
  [Latypov] One knows about the attitude by some members of 
the 
State Duma to the Russian-Tatarstan treaty. In particular, 
[Sergey] Baburin [leader of the Russian Path parliamentary 
group] said on television that the treaty was unacceptable. He 
wanted to stress once again that Russia had nothing to agree on 
with Tatarstan. On the other side, the opinions of radical 
nationalists in Kazan are just as acrimonious. It seems to me 
they have something in common, don't you think? 
  [Shaymiyev] I don't think it is anything -- in this 
particular case they agree utterly and completely. This is a 
demonstration of chauvinism, Russian on the one side and Tatar 
on the other. This is unacceptable. These are extremes. 
  [Latypov] You said Tatarstan will not stop at this treaty. 
What will happen next? 
  [Shaymiyev] We are resolutely in favor of decentralization 
of 
Russian economy. Without resolving this problem, we will not be 
able to succeed in achieving further progress in the economic 
reforms. 
  More opportunities should be provided so that the reforms 
could be implemented on the ground. The fact that the treaty 
was signed means we are approaching a democratic federal 
structure in the Russian Federation. 
  One should pay tribute to the understanding demonstrated by 
Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. Both he and we have undertaken 
great responsibility as a result of signing the treaty.

<F P=106> [Boir Borboyev report under the "Buryatia" rubric: </F>
"Republic Has a Constitution. It Will Soon Have a President"] 
  [Text] One of the latest pledges of Buryatia Supreme 
Soviet deputies to the population, which has slowly been "coming 
to the boil," has been acted upon. The parliament session has 
adopted a constitution in whose first chapter the republic near 
Lake Baykal recorded its adherence to the idea of constructing a 
democratic, rule-of-law state as part of the Russian Federation. 
Buryatia's political circles have generally proclaimed, and are 
proclaiming now, their loyalty to Moscow while not concealing 
their recent dissatisfaction with the correction of the 
president's and the federal government's economic course. In 
its turn, the emergence of "quiet opposition" in Ulan-Ude is 
connected with the so far blurred, after the adoption of the 
republic's new Fundamental Law, political prospects. Under the 
Constitution, state power shall be exercised in Buryatia by a 
nationally elected president, a numerically small (55 persons) 
professional parliament (People's Khural), government, and 
courts of law. Future presidents shall be elected by popular 
vote for four years. The deputies insisted that future 
candidates should know the republic's economy well and be able 
to speak two state languages -- Buryat and Russian. The future 
head of state shall form the government team, but unlike the 
team, he shall not be accountable to parliament. 
  In addition to the Constitution, the session, which is 
continuing, will pass republican laws "On Presidential 
Elections," "On Elections for the People's Khural," and "On 
Organs of Self-Government." According to observers' 
assessments, however, the main struggle between parties, 
movements, and blocs is still ahead. Shortly before the 
Constitution was adopted, the founding congresses of agrarians, 
young people, and athletes, who stated their preferences, took 
place in Ulan-Ude. It was not for nothing that there was a stir 
in Ulan-Ude around the court examination of a 50-million ruble 
libel suit brought by Buryatia parliament speaker Leonid Potapov 
against the parliament-government newspaper BURYATIYA. 
Incidentally, the newspaper filed a countersuit last Monday 
accusing Leonid Potapov of lying, and demanding that he pay 100 
million rubles.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk sent a message 
to parliament Thursday calling for joining the 1968 Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  Anton Buteiko, the president's foreign affairs adviser, told 
Interfax-Ukraine that this message, the third of this kind in as 
many years, presented new arguments in favor of joining the 
treaty that follow from the trilateral communique of the U.S., 
Ukrainian and Russian presidents and the Western response to it. 
That communique provided for the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine. 
  "The president says that parliament should speed up making a 
decision," the adviser said. He emphasized that a speedy 
decision would be in Ukraine's interests. 
  The Ukrainian parliament ratified START-1 and Article 5 of 
the Lisbon protocol whereby Ukraine undertakes to join the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state. 
Parliament did not, however, join the treaty immediately. Its 
Speaker Ivan Plyushch told journalists in early February that 
"joining the 1968 Treaty will be debated by a new parliament."

Kamer, Switzerland's ambassador to Ukraine. Kamer was 
particularly interested in the possibility of the present 
composition of parliament resolving the issue of Ukraine's 
accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Valentyn 
Lemish noted the advisability of submitting this issue to the 
Supreme Council for examination in March of this year. The

the United States and Russia take practical steps now in reply 
to the Supreme Council resolution withdrawing the reservations 
to Article 5 of the protocol to the START Treaty.

<F P=106> [Article by Oksana Boyko: "A Jacket of Aid for Ukraine Made </F>
in the West. A Strait-Jacket?"] 
  [Text] The ambassadors of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, 
Finland, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, 
Spain, Great Britain, and the United States met on 14 February 
with President Leonid Kravchuk to hand him a joint declaration 
by their governments that cordially welcomed decisions made by 
the Ukrainian Supreme Council regarding the tripartite 
Declaration signed in Moscow by the Ukrainian, American, and 
Russian presidents and the START I Treaty. The above states 
expressed their intention to closely cooperate with Ukraine and 
to assist in the dismantling of nuclear weapons, the conversion 
program, environmental protection, retraining and alternative 
employment for those engaged in manufacturing and servicing the 
nuclear weapons, etc. Bilateral economic cooperation was also 
promised. 
  However, no specific figures for the aid were given. As the 
diplomats explained at the press conference, specific projects 
are now in the works, though some governments have already 
devised their programs. The Japanese ambassador mentioned $100 
million that his country intends to give to Ukraine, Russia, 
Belarus, and Kazakhstan for disarmament, while the German charge 
d'affaires said his government earmarked 10 million Deutschmarks 
for Ukraine, which were not paid because of conditions for START 
I put forward by the Ukrainian legislature. We will soon learn 
how much Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko will "bring" back from 
Bonn, where he went on an official visit. 
  So, we will have a jacket of aid made by the whole world. A 
thin jacket. The same applies to the security guarantees -- 
nothing specific was proposed here except for the bright 
prospects opened by the "Partnership for Peace" program, 
contacts with NATO and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, 
etc. In general, however, all those solemn declarations are 
simply designed to give President Kravchuk moral support in his 
relations with the parliament, because Ukraine is expected to 
join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state. 
  But another press conference was held that same day, where 
they talked about projects for Ukraine estimated at hundreds of 
millions of dollars, and at their initial stage at that. The 
multinational ABB, whose president Percy Barnevick visited 
Ukraine on the invitation of Leonid Kravchuk, is one of the 
leading corporations in power engineering. It offered us 
projects directed at Ukraine's energy independence. They 
involve energy-saving technologies in chemical and petrochemical 
industries as well as modernization of our coal and atomic power 
stations, which for Percy Barnevick are the future of Ukrainian 
power engineering. They also provide for setting up a special 
international investment fund for atomic engineering and 
Ukrainian power engineering in general. ABB is planning soon to 
start up five or six joint ventures in Ukraine to implement its 
projects.

<F P=106> [Interview With Ukrainian Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav </F>
Chornovil, by Valer Kalinowski in Kiev; date not given: 
"Helsinki Agreement Is Advantageous for Everyone"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Kalinowski] Do you think that 
Ukraine should give up its nuclear arms? 
  [Chornovil] If I were president, I would not sign anything 
that would contradict Supreme Council resolutions on this issue. 
This does not mean that we want to become "very nuclear." 
However, if I have some property that costs a million and sell 
it for three kopecks, I am either a bad economist or a little 
mentally deficient. This means I should not be permitted to 
manage anything, even my own household. The compensations that 
we are offered are really miserable and do not cover our 
expenditures on eliminating these arms. The removal of all 
SS-24 missiles in 10 months, including those whose warranty time 
period is far from expiring, is simply unwise. In light of the 
developments in our region, we should have insisted on more 
security assurances as well. 
  I believe that the process of nuclear disarmament could be 
protracted and last 10 to 15 years. This period would give us 
time to get back on our feet economically, and strengthen our 
defense potential. The world community would become accustomed 
to the fact that there is a country in East Europe named 
Ukraine. We need at least seven years to remove the nuclear 
arms envisioned by START I. 
  [Kalinowski] What could be Ukraine's reaction if the merging 
of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus is followed by 
these states' reunification? 
  [Chornovil] For Ukraine, this would be a very dangerous 
process, and I once pointed this out to Stanislav Shushkevich. 
In fact, a wedge would be driven between Ukraine and the 
Baltics, granting Russia access to Poland. Strategically, 
Ukraine would be surrounded. Ukraine, unlike Belarus, is still 
upholding its independence. Thus, it is clear that our reaction 
would be negative. However, we would not shout about this, 
because this would amount to meddling in another state's affairs. 
  [Kalinowski] Would that be a death sentence on the 
Baltic-Black Sea Commonwealth? 
  [Chornovil] Nobody has ever tried to implement this idea; it 
was still up in the air and discussed as a possible project. 
Due to your question, I have just realized another danger of 
this "wedge" -- it will ruin the project. 
  [Kalinowski] I would like to bring up the open letter to 
Mikhail Gorbachev published in SVABODA on 22 October 1987. The 
letter carried your thesis that "the Soviet administration gave 
Belarus part of Brest and Pinsk Oblasts, that are ethnic 
Ukrainian territories." Many Belarusians were gravely concerned. 
  [Chornovil] I have always advocated inviolability of 
borders. However, a large Ukrainian community resides in Brest 
Oblast, while the population in some parts is totally Ukrainian. 
Only a very uneducated or a very biased person would deny this 
fact. This is the way the border was demarcated. Incidentally, 
a Belarusian region near Gomel was annexed to Ukraine, while 
Kuban was given to Russia. The same happened to Taganrog that 
belonged to Ukraine until 1926. We should not dispute the 
current borders. Yet, we should guarantee that 
national-cultural demands of the Ukrainians are met in Belarus, 
and that these people maintain contacts with Ukraine. By the 
way in Transcarpathia, we have a rayon totally populated by 
Hungarians. This is a historic reality and one cannot do 
anything about it. Aside from supplying textbooks and training 
teachers for Ukrainian schools in that region, there can be no 
other presence of the Ukrainian state there. A similar 
situation is in Moldova where 600,000 Ukrainians live. 
Ukrainian elementary and high schools are opening there now, as 
was once done in Romania. Assisting ethnic minorities is part of 
interstate relations. If everything is done on the basis of the 
Helsinki agreement, such assistance will be advantageous for 
everyone and no hindrance for good-neighborly relations between 
Belarus and Ukraine. 
  [Kalinowski] Observers have recently pointed out that 
relations, including economic ones, between Belarus and Ukraine 
have been deteriorating. Why is that? 
  [Chornovil] In my opinion, Belarus has been too oriented 
toward Russia, instead of trying to create a certain 
counterbalance. If Belarus is too attached to one partner, it 
will never become an independent state. Even the United States 
does not buy more than a couple percent of its energy resources 
from one country, to avoid becoming dependent. If all the 
former Soviet republics united, the CIS could become an 
organization serving the interests of all its members, not just 
Russia. Unfortunately, Russia has been winning these states one 
by one by means of gifts, promises, and influencing the loyal 
nomenklatura.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 24, BNS -- Flying to Latvia Wednesday 
[23 February], Polish President Lech Walesa transmitted a 
greeting to Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas when the 
plane was above Lithuanian territory. 
  The Polish president expressed satisfaction that "our 
foreign 
ministers have completed preparatory work for the signing of the 
agreement on friendly relations and neighborly cooperation 
between the republics of Lithuania and Poland." 
  The accord had been under negotiation for one and a half 
years. Lithuania and Poland completed the talks Tuesday in 
Warsaw. 
  So far there have been no reports as to the exact formulas 
chosen to mention the 1920-39 occupation of Vilnius and its 
region by Poland. 
  Vaclovas Domarkas, Lithuanian deputy minister of foreign 
affairs, said after the fifth and final round of talks that the 
treaty includes "historic moments which trouble us, but no 
specific names or dates." 
  According to unofficial reports, the accord says that 
Vilnius 
has always been the historic capital of the Lithuanian state.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 24, ELTA -- Leader of parliamentary 
opposition Vytautas Landsbergis MP released a statement on 
Thursday [24 February] saying the amnesty to Russian putchists 
was not valid in Lithuania. 
  He said in his statement that Russian State Duma had issued 
an amnesty for all the defendants in the case of 1991 August 
coup attempt while there was more and more evidence that the 
former president of the USSR had himself participated in the 
coup. It is an internal affair of C.I.S. but the amnesty does 
not touch Lithuania which restored its independence in March 11, 
1990 after a half-century of Soviet annexation. 
  Actions of Soviet putchists in 1991 in Lithuania will be 
further treated here as international crimes and rude violation 
of Lithuanian law, the statement said.

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 24, BNS -- Lithuanian Foreign Ministry 
and Defense Ministry officials meet Thursday [24 February] to 
decide on further actions if Russia attempts to carry out 
unauthorized military transit through Lithuanian territory, said 
Lieutenant Colonel Algirdas Jurkevicius. 
  Inspector Jurkevicius heads the Defense Ministry's dangerous 
cargo transportation division and is authorized to issue or to 
deny permissions for Russian military transit. 
  On Tuesday, he instructed Lithuanian railroad officials to 
stop a Russian train with around 30 armored personnel carriers, 
which were escorted by four armed Russian soldiers. 
  The train was allowed to enter Lithuanian territory from the 
Kaliningrad region late Tuesday when 17 flatcars with military 
equipment were disconnected. 
  The leadership of the Russian troops stationed in 
Kaliningrad 
apologized for an incident last weekend when a Russian echelon 
crossed the Lithuanian border without any permission of 
Lithuanian authorities. 
  On Tuesday, Russian Army officials requested a transit 
permission for a new echelon but Jurkevicius denied their 
request. 
  Jurkevicius said his decision was prompted by the media's 
strong reaction to the incident last weekend. 
  Until now, Russian military transit from Kaliningrad was 
reportedly carried out in accordance with the rules of transit 
from Germany. Apparently, the inspector is no longer willing to 
apply the same rules to transit from Kaliningrad and to transit 
from Germany.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rostyslav Bilodid, Ukrainian ambassador </F>
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Lithuania, by Algimantas 
Zukas in Vilnius; date not given: "The Visit Is Necessary for 
Peace Rather Than War"] 
  [Excerpts] [Zukas] Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk is arriving on an official visit to Lithuania today. 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas stated a week ago what 
the two leaders had to discuss. 
  [Bilodid] [passage omitted] Opinions about the possible 
military alliance sometimes voiced in the Seimas [parliament] 
are totally ungrounded. This is a manifestation of political 
atavism. A security vacuum has emerged after the USSR collapse. 
This issue is important to every politician. The problem of 
security can be tackled individually and in cooperation, but not 
through a military alliance. We will look for common issues in 
reducing possible dangers. We would not like this to be 
interpreted as actions directed against Russia or other 
countries. It would be naive to think that Russia can be 
bypassed or ignored. We often come across political naivete 
which sometimes stirs negative emotions. Compromises bear much 
better fruit. We will seek certain compromises during the 
visit, but definitely not military alliances. 
  [Zukas] Ukraine will, probably, not refuse to 
participate in such an initiative as the "Partnership for 
Peace." 
  [Bilodid] It is difficult to oppose this initiative. The 
Ukrainian Government assesses it positively, and I have not 
heard any hostile opinions, although there are different views. 
Certainly, the official stand will be voiced. Honestly 
speaking, however, this partnership is a palliative, a 
compromise. We will yet have to consider the formulations and 
concepts. We see, however, that Western countries are not ready 
to take us into their arms immediately. Moreover, it is naive 
and not serious to forget Russia which is being pictured now as 
a monster. We must take its reaction into account because we 
are realistic politicians. We do not need another Yugoslavia or 
Georgia. However, all this is happening next to us, and it is 
very worrisome. [passage omitted] 
  [Zukas] Many people assess the situation in the 
neighboring Belarus as the "hunt for one of the Belovezh forest 
bisons." Not everyone in Ukraine approves of President L. 
Kravchuk's policy. Do you not think that the hunt for the 
second "Belovezh bison" is possible? 
  [Bilodid] The situation in Belarus differs from that in 
Ukraine, and any analogies are meaningless. I believe that 
"storms" in the parliament encourage the development of the 
nation's collective mind. It is very important that the 
president has preserved peace in the state which has 53 million 
very different people. We have no "hot spots." The economy has 
declined considerably, but one should not forget the reasons. 
The foundation for a crisis was laid for 50 years at least. 
The USSR would direct all the money earned by Ukraine in the 
post-war period to other regions. Ukraine had a large 
industrial infrastructure, but the finances were not returned, 
and the capital stock became obsolete. [passage omitted] 
  [Zukas] You are a representative of the sciences not 
only by your education. You worked in this sphere before 
entering diplomacy. Does your former experience help you find 
your way in political intricacies? 
  [Bilodid] I assess history will all seriousness. Physics 
allows me to look for similarities between the two sciences. 
Parallels can be very interesting. The theory of phase 
transformations is an exact reflection of those changes which we 
call the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. This is 
only one analogy between the two sciences. Our two countries 
are creating versatile communities which previously knew only 
two colors -- of friends and foes. The vectors of your current 
interests are pointed at the East, the West, the North, and they 
almost bypass the South. This was also noted by the Foreign 
Policy Council for the Lithuanian president. Our embassy is 
trying to arouse your interest in the neighbors from the south. 
I am returning to physics again: The concept of stability 
states that if a system has only one degree of freedom, the 
level of stability is very low or it hardly exists. If there are 
three degrees of freedom, stability is guaranteed. It is the 
same in politics: The more ties a country has, the more stable 
its situation in the world is. A separate state is always 
lonely. 
  [Zukas] However, relations between Ukraine and 
Lithuania are not too bright as well. 
  [Bilodid] I have always thought about human relations. 
Certain things have changed today. Ukraine did not advocate 
the introduction of visas. We know that Lithuania was not 
interested in this too much. However, this is Lithuania's 
business. As soon as Lithuania introduced visas, we did the 
same. People have very clearly felt the emergence of visas. 
Our previous communication was much easier. Now we have been 
left with trains alone, although we are willing to negotiate air 
traffic again. Moreover, not every person can pay five U.S. 
dollars for a visa because the average wage is only $10-15. 
This reduces possibilities for cultural and scientific 
cooperation. 
  [Zukas] How do you personally feel in Lithuania? 
  [Bilodid] I have known Lithuania for a long time and I love 
it gently. I have spent many summers in the environs of 
Ignalina, and I would not exchange it for the Crimea or any 
other place. I myself asked to be appointed to Lithuania, 
although my diplomatic experience (10 years in the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, and six years in the United Nations) 
allowed me to choose. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On 20 February, a small increase in radioactivity 
was recorded by the Ignalina nuclear power station permanent 
control system in one of the unmanned hermetically sealed 
compartments of the second reactor. 
  This has been reported to ELTA by Viktor Shevaldin, director 
general of the Ignalina nuclear power station, today. 
  After additional investigation, a conclusion was made that 
radioactivity could have increased because of the leak of gas, 
which is used to pull the turbines, into this compartment. 
Although the rate of the gas leak was much lower than that 
permitted by the exploitation procedure, the administration of 
the station, however, decided to shut down the second power unit 
in order to be able to carry out a detailed inspection of the 
compartment and to eliminate the cause of the leak. 
  The unit is to be under maintenance from 25 February until 6 
March, Shevaldin said. The head of the power station also 
informed that the increase of radioactivity in the unmanned 
compartment of the second block did not have any influence 
either on the power station or on the radioactive background of 
the environment.

  [Text] Tulegen Zhukeyev, Kazakhstan's state adviser, 
rejected information stating that the republic's leadership 
advocates U.S. military presence on the Caspian Sea. In the 
course of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to the 
United States from February 13-17 "the parties did not even 
raise this issue," Zhukeyev reported in his interview with 
Interfax on Thursday. 
  The adviser voiced this statement due to the assertions of 
the Iranian admiral Ali Shamakhin who declared in his interview 
with the Tehran newspaper Dzhumkhurne Islami early this week 
that Kazakhstan invites the Americans to ensure an American 
military presence on the Caspian Sea. 
  Zhukeyev underlined that Kazakhstan does not plan to bring 
about the presence of American naval forces or involvement of 
Americans as military advisers on the Caspian Sea. At the same 
time he did not rule out the possibility that the republic's 
leadership would address the United States for consultation 
concerning creation of Kazakhstan's coast guard service on the 
Caspian Sea. "Americans have great experience in this sphere and 
currently Kazakhstan faces these problems with respect to the 
Caspian Sea," said Zhukeyev. 
  The state adviser also reported that at present, the Kazakh 
and Russian governments are defining plans to jointly guard CIS 
sea border on the Caspian Sea.

  [Text] The decree of the president of Kazakhstan on 
rendering assistance to agricultural enterprises in 1994 says: 
  First. In order to improve the financial 
situation of agricultural enterprises, long-outstanding debts of 
agricultural goods' producers of all forms of ownership to banks 
in the form of loans should be deferred, with the exception of 
targeted credits granted to replenish working assets given at 
the expense of the centralized crediting resources of the 
national bank of the republic of Kazakhstan as of 1 January 1994; 
  Redemption of the abovementioned debts will begin on 1 
January 1999 in equal, interest-free installments over 5 years. 
  Second. In order socially to support workers of 
collective and state farms and other state-owned agricultural 
enterprises, the national bank of the republic of Kazakhstan 
should, under the guarantee of the Government of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, via commercial banks, issue credit aimed at 
redemption of the debts resulted from paying wages and made 
before 1 January 1994. These debts should be paid back on 25 
December 1994. The aforementioned loan should be given with 25 
percent annual interest. Banks should have granted all loans by 
1 March 1994. 
  Third. The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan until 25 March 1994 should find foreign loans and 
credits in the amount necessary to finance the measures 
indicated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this decree. 
  Fourth. Commercial banks should be made 
materially responsible for three times the amount of loans 
deferred without reasonable grounds. The Ministry of Finance 
together with the State Financial Control Committee under the 
Cabinet of Ministers should fine commercial banks for deferring 
loans without reasonable grounds, crediting the fine to the 
republican budget. 
  Fifth. This decree has the force of a law and is 
valid from the moment of being published and will be valid until 
the newly elected Supreme Kenges of the republic passes a 
relevant law. 
  [Signed] President Nazarbayev

  [Text] Dushanbe February 23 TASS -- A UN envoy in 
Tajikistan said he knows nothing about the alleged existence of 
concentration camps in the Central Asian republic where 
opposition members are being kept, but added that the 
information needs a thorough check. 
  "We do not have any facts about the existence of 
concentration camps in Tajikistan", Liviu Botha, head of the UN 
mission in Tajikistan, told reporters on Wednesday commenting on 
corresponding Western mass media reports which claimed that 
political prisoners are being kept in three major camps on Tajik 
territory. 
  However, Botha confirmed that he had received the 
information 
and added that it needs to be thoroughly checked. 
  He stressed that the Tajik Government agreed to render any 
necessary assistance to the UN mission in inspecting the 
mentioned areas were the camps are allegedly situated. 
  Tajik Parliament Speaker Imamali Rakhmonov categorically 
denied in an interview to TASS the alleged existence in the 
country of concentration camps and of political prisoners. 
  One of the leaders of the Security Ministry qualified the 
reports as "dirty insinuations". 
  The news also caused open confusion among foreign and 
Russian 
correspondents accredited in Tajikistan who said they had heard 
nothing about any concentration camps.

  [Text] Dushanbe February 25 TASS -- The Tajik parliament 
ruled on Friday to prolong until July 1 the state of emergency 
in areas bordering on Afghanistan. 
  The state of emergency was initially introduced in January 
1993 and covers, in particular, the Shuroabad, Pyandzh, Shaartuz 
regions and the city of Khorog, the administrative centre of the 
Gorno-Badakhshan region. 
  According to the parliamentary decree, the state of 
emergency 
was prolonged for the sake of "stabilisation of the political 
situation in the above-mentioned areas, safety of residents 
living there, as well as in connection with incessant armed 
provocations on the Tajik-Afghan border".

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Sergey </F>
Logachev, Andrey Petrovsky] 
  [Text] Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander of the 
coalition peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, reconfirmed to 
Interfax that during his recent visit to Moscow he met with 
several opposition leaders who were also staying there. In his 
words, the meetings were held at the request of representatives 
of Tajik political opposition which expressed readiness to start 
negotiations with the Dushanbe leadership. 
  In Pyankov's words, the fear of the opposition to go to 
Dushanbe is the major difficulty in the negotiations. For his 
part, Pyankov expressed readiness to ensure their security in 
case negotiations are held in Dushanbe. 
  Otakhon Latifi, one of the representatives of the 
opposition, 
declared that negotiations with the Dushanbe authorities will 
take place in case they are held under the UN auspices and with 
the participation of Iranian and Pakistani representatives and 
Russia's mediation. 
  Pyankov reaffirmed that the UN plans to hold negotiations 
but 
he has still no information about their time and place. "In my 
opinion, this decision is still far away." 
  As Pyankov said, the Tajik opposition understands that the 
coalition peacekeeping forces represent a real force which 
substantially affects stabilization of the situation in the 
republic. As he said, representatives of the opposition 
expressed a request not to withdraw the coalition peacekeeping 
forces from Tajikistan as they are the major guarantor of civil 
peace in the country. 
  At the same time Pyankov believes that the negotiations in 
Moscow have been "actually fruitless."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kuleshov report: "Turkmenistan Has Cut Off Gas </F>
Supply to Ukraine. Other CIS Republics in Line for Same 
Treatment"] 
  [Text] Ashgabat -- "On 22 February we are cutting off gas 
supplies to Ukraine," Turkmen President S. Niyazov announced at 
an extraordinary session of the Cabinet of Ministers. "We 
acknowledge that this is an extreme measure which was not part 
of the government's plan; the government tried to settle the 
problem by all the channels available to it. But in the end 
Turkmenistan's compromise steps did not find due support from 
the Ukrainian side -- which is only to be regretted." 
  Let me remind readers that a month ago, replying to a 
proposal by the leaders of the "Turkmengaz" corporation to shut 
off the valves on the gas pipeline in response to Ukraine's 
systematic refusal to pay for gas and its violations of the 
agreements it had signed, Saparmurad Niyazov stated: "I agree 
that as a result of late payments for gas supply by our CIS 
partners, the Turkmen economy is experiencing considerable 
hardship. But, however difficult things might be for us, we 
cannot fail to take account of far more serious problems in the 
states concerned, and we are therefore willing to compromise...." 
  Today the treasury in Ashgabat is owed some $1.5 billion in 
debts from last year and this year. According to expert 
opinion, this is seriously undermining the state's balance of 
payments and the convertibility of the national currency. 
  Take Ukraine, whose debts for Turkmen gas amounted to $700 
million last year and grew by just over another $150 million 
during January and the first 20 days of February. On dozens of 
occasions the Turkmen side has warned, requested, and tried to 
cajole the Ukrainian leadership to settle up at least partially, 
if not in dollars then at least in commodities. The reply was 
as follows: If you shut off the valves on the gas pipeline, we 
will obtain our gas unilaterally from the "Russia-Europe" gas 
export pipeline, thus depriving you of foreign currency for 
export deliveries of fuel.... 
  For some time now Turkmenistan's chronic debtors have 
included Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and 
Georgia; their negotiated limits expire any day now, and 
consequently gas supplies to these states could also be cut off. 
  Partners' lack of obligingness and their failure to pay for 
gas are hitting the Turkmen economy hard, impacting first and 
foremost on people's welfare. Crazy prices for goods and food 
and an occasional lack of everyday staples, coupled with an 
inability on the government's part to double or triple the 
population's pay -- which it promised to do on several occasions 
last year -- are the consequences of the debt problems. 
  Naturally, as R. Robinson, IMF permanent representative in 
Turkmenistan, stated, Turkmenistan will find a way out of the 
situation that has developed, but in order to do this it must 
not only work extremely hard in the budget, financial, and 
taxation spheres but also tighten its purse strings....

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Glazovskaya and Oleg </F>
Lukin] 
  [Text] Ashgabat February 24 TASS -- Turkmenistan is to 
supply this year 3 billion cubic meters of natural gas to 
Azerbaijan. An agreement to this effect was concluded during 
the recent vivit by Azerbaijan's official delegation to the 
Central Asian republic. The document was signed between the 
Turkmennebitgasexport organization and the Azerigas state-run 
company. 
  The agreement provides for clearing payments in hard 
currency. The contracting sides settled the price at the level 
of 80 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas, transport carges 
inclusive. Azerbaijan is to supply Turkmenistan with industrial 
equipment, consumer goods and foodstuffs for the sum equivalent 
to the value of gas supplies. 
  As for gas supplies to Ukraine, Turkmen Oil and Gas Minister 
Nazar Suyunov [title as received] confirmed they had been fully 
discontinued because of unpaid debts. However, it does not mean 
that Turkmenistan rejects any counter proposals, he stressed. 
The republic is ready to consider them on any positive basis. 
Suyunov noted Ukraine's commercial structures are willing to 
cooperate but they cannot do this bypassing state-run 
organizations resolutely determined not to pay off their debts. 
Once, the minister explained, Turkmenistan offered clearing 
settlements to Ukraine, but the latter turned down the offer. 
Now it also refuses to honour its bills. 
  According to the Turkmen minister, such an approach is 
rather 
surprising, to say the least. However, Turkmenistan is still 
ready to search for mutually acceptable solutions, which is 
proved by its agreements with Georgia and Azerbaijan, Suyunov 
said.

  [Text] Beijing February 22 TASS -- China's intention to 
base relations of friendship and goodneighbourliness with 
Turkmenistan on the five principles of peaceful co-existence was 
expressed by Qiao Shi, chairman of the standing committee of 
China's National People's Congress, during a meeting with 
Turkmen Mejlis Chief Sakhat Muradov, who is currently on an 
official visit here. 
  The Chinese parliament chief emphasised the need to broaden 
friendly cooperation between the two countries in politics, 
economics, science, technology, and culture. 
  Qiao pointed out a considerable strengtheing of contacts 
with 
foreign countries over the past 15 years, RENMIN RIBAO reported 
on Tuesday. This, he said, was resultant of an active 
realisation of reforms and the open-door policy. 
  The Chinese parliament chief said China cannot do without 
drawing on the experience of foreign countries in the 
development of democracy and economics. 
  "However, one should not copy foreign models. One should act 
in line with the country's current realities," Qiao said. 
  Muradov said Turkmenistan attaches much importance to the 
development of contacts with China, whose experience may prove 
useful for the development of the Turkmen economy, RENMIN RIBAO 
reported.

  [Text] Stability in Central Asia "can be assured only by 
the presence of Russia as a guarantor," Uzbek President Islam 
Karimov said at a news conference in Tashkent Tuesday following 
the end of his talks with Imamali Rakhmonov, Chairman of the 
Tajik Supreme Soviet. 
  The two men signed a trade and economic agreement on the aid 
Uzbekistan will provide its neighbor. According to Karimov, the 
document "will jettison the short-term aid satisfying only 
immediate needs and will tap the economic reserves available in 
Tajikistan." 
  To help Tajikistan with the spring sowing Uzbekistan will 
send fuel, agricultural machinery, fertilizers and seeds. The 
trade between the two countries will be worth $140 Mn [million] 
in 1994. 
  Rakhmonov said that Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan had 
been violated over 25 times since January 1. He recalled that 
the Tajik-Afghan border was part of the CIS common border that 
had to be jointly protected. 
  Karimov said that Tajikistan could not join the agreement 
between Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan on the setting up 
of a common economic space before the Afghan-Tajik border was 
calm. 
  He denied that his country was aiding Abdurashit Dustum, an 
Afghan general. In his words, regional UN officials who checked 
the rumors to this effect did not find any evidence of 
Uzbekistan's aid to Dustum. 
  In Karimov's view, Afghanistan's President Rabbani was 
behind 
these rumors which were spread to make an impression that he had 
to fight a strong opposition. "Dustum is an ethnic Uzbek. There 
are 2.5 Mn Uzbeks living in North Afghanistan. This is the 
reason why such questions are asked that cast a shadow on 
Uzbekistan," the Uzbek president said. 
  Uzbekistan aided Afghanistan only with "energy which is 
supplied to Mazar-e Sharif through existing networks." 
Switching the supply off would harm Afghanistan's civilian 
population, something that Uzbekistan cannot afford.

  [Text] Kiev -- At the evening plenary sitting of Ukraine's 
Supreme Council on 24 February a resolution was adopted "On the 
Status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea with Respect to the 
Current Constitution and Legislation of Ukraine", which is meant 
to prevent the violation of Ukrainian legislation on the part of 
the autonomy's bodies of state authority and officials. In 
particular the resolution contains reservations regarding 
changing Ukraine's territory and state borders, separating 
Crimean citizenship from Ukrainian citizenship, the existence in 
Crimea of its own military formations, and the existence of a 
monetary and financial system separate from Ukraine. In 
accordance with the adopted resolution, the Republic of Crimea's 
Supreme Council is to bring the constitution and other 
legislative acts of the republic of Crimea into line with the 
constitution and legislation of Ukraine in a month. Leonid 
Kravchuk has been charged with ensuring implementation of the 
law "On Representation of the President in the Republic of 
Crimea"; Ukraine's president and procurator general are also 
charged with the duty of reacting to the violation of Ukraine's 
constitution and laws in good time. The people's deputies 
adopted a package of documents, in accordance with which a 
military collegium is set up within the composition of Ukraine's 
Supreme Court, and the post of deputy chairman of the Supreme 
Court is established, to which Colonel-General Volodymyr 
Denysenko was elected. Judges were also elected to the Supreme 
Court military collegium, chairmen and judges were elected to 
military courts, and at the same time judges of oblast and 
military courts were released from their duties, amendments and 
additions were made to the law "On the status of judges" and so 
on. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko submitted for 
examination to parliament four international agreements, which 
had recently been signed on behalf of Ukraine with the Republic 
of Georgia, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Kazakhstan and 
the Lithuanian Republic, and also a draft Supreme Council 
resolution "On Ukraine's participation in the European Cultural 
Convention 1954". All of the documents were ratified. 
  Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch informed deputies 
that 
the morning plenary sitting on 25 February would begin with 
discussion of the draft resolution "On the reports by Ukraine's 
Cabinet of Ministers and National Bank on organizing 
implementation of Ukraine's Supreme Council resolutions of 17 
and 23 December 1993 and measures to overcome the payments 
crisis in the national economy."

Supreme Council resolution regarding conformity of the 
Autonomous Republic of Crimea's Constitution with Ukraine's 
Constitution and laws. There are more important concerns." 
According to Meshkov, the resolution "is inexpert from the 
legal point of view. Kiev is scarcely managing to destabilize 
the situation on the peninsula in this way," noted Crimea's 
president.

  [Text] Mykola Bagrov has resumed his duties as chairman of 
the Supreme Council of Crimea. However, he has returned to his 
work only for a month until the plenary powers of the current 
deputies corps end. The chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council 
did not change his decision to abandon politics during his 
vacation. He reported on this at the news conference which was 
also attended by our correspondent Yury Polonsky. 
  [Polonsky] Mykola Bagrov looked optimistic and confident to 
the journalists. Of course, the vacation did him good. He did 
not spend his vacation in Cyprus, as rumored, but was with his 
relatives in St. Petersburg. He visited theaters, museums, read 
a lot, and thought about what had happened in his life. The 
defeat in the presidential election did not change his views. 
Mykola Bagrov has not rejected his election program because he 
considered and considers himself to be a realist. His program 
did not contain any populist ideas. He proposed the most 
realistic ways for getting out of the complicated economic 
situation which, to my regret, is continuing to grow worse. 
Under this situation, believes the chairman of the Supreme 
Council of Crimea, it is extremely important for the session to 
formulate and adopt the budget of the Republic -- the session 
resumes the work on 11 March. All this made him -- despite his 
statement on the resignation, which, by the way, was not 
approved by the deputies -- resume the work. 
  [Begin Bagrov recording] You know that today we can 
formulate 
the budget on the one-channel principle. However, speaking 
sincerely, this has always been attractive to us, but currently 
this will create additional difficulties. We should take this 
into consideration. Look, currently, the city should receive 
profits standing at 700 billion rubles [R], but it receives only 
R8 billion, so, I beg your pardon, the question arises: How 
should we react? This means that the problems with communal 
apartments and all the other stuff will stay unsettled. This 
can lead to the closure of schools, etc. [end recording] 
  [Polonsky] The journalists asked about the attitude of the 
chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea to the new executive 
authorities in the Crimea, to the first steps of President 
Meshkov. 
  [Begin Bagrov recording] You should excuse me, but I 
expected 
that much more would have been done by this time. For a while, 
to my regret, I cannot say this. No one will excuse us for this 
stalling of reforms, therefore, the executive authorities 
should properly perform their obligations. [end recording] 
  [Polonsky] Mykola Bagrov is not going to oppose Yuriy 
Meshkov. This is not a proper time to do this. Today, said the 
chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea, we should create 
normal conditions for the work of the executive bodies of the 
president. In the opinion of the legislative chairman, if Yuriy 
Meshkov requests some additional authorities, he should be 
supported. It is possible to introduce these changes into the 
law on presidency. Currently, people should be guided by vital 
issues, by interests of the Crimea. He said nothing specific 
about his personal matters and future. I want to stress, he 
briefly said, this is not the end of my life.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pilat report under the "Crimea" rubric: "Bagrov </F>
To Help Meshkov. The Speaker Who Lost a Presidential Race Will 
Have a Role Yet"] 
  [Text] Opening a meeting of the Supreme Soviet Presidium, 
Crimean Parliament Speaker Nikolay Bagrov said: "My application 
to resign is still in force. But since the session has not 
granted this request, and taking into account a number of 
circumstances, I have decided to hold a meeting." Referring to 
the circumstances, Bagrov said: "First, the situation is 
difficult and we need to create a normal environment for the 
president's work. Second, there is no need to elect a new 
parliamentary chairman. Third, the Supreme Soviet ought to 
operate." Nikolay Bagrov gave a negative assessment of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council's decision to hold local elections on 
26 June together with the Ukrainian presidential elections: 
"This is unwise, all the more so because it will be in our 
tourist season." Bagrov proposed that this matter be passed to 
the session for consideration. A proposal by Presidium member 
Viktor Bobylev to lift the moratorium on holding a referendum on 
the Republic of Crimea's independence was turned down. 
  Later Nikolay Bagrov held a news conference. He told 
journalists about Yevgeniy Saburov, deputy prime minister of the 
Republic of Crimea: "This man merits attention, and he ought to 
show what he can do." 
  Nikolay Bagrov made it clear that he cut his vacation in 
order to stay in his office for another month (he will resign 
after the March elections) to help the president. "I am ready, 
together with Supreme Soviet deputies, to create conditions for 
the work of the executive branch." The speaker dwelled in 
detail on the proposed discussion of the Crimean budget at the 
parliamentary session. "If presently a city plans to receive 
700 billion karbovanets in profits, but receives only 8 billion, 
drawing up a budget will be a very difficult thing to do," 
Nikolay Bagrov said. "What I very much fear is whether we will 
be able to survive after Ukraine enabled us to draw up our own 
budget and will not give us anything." 
  Nikolay Bagrov had a negative view on Crimea's joining the 
ruble zone and holding a referendum on Crimea's independence. 
In his opinion, all that is unrealistic.

  [Excerpts] Riga, February 24 (LETA) -- February 23, an 
official visit of the Polish President, Lech Walesa to Latvia 
began. Lech Walesa and his spouse were met by the Latvian 
president, Guntis Ulmanis, and his wife. The high-ranking guest 
was also met by the Latvian prime minister, Valdis Birkavs, 
other officials and the heads of the diplomatic representations 
accredited in Latvia. 
  Without Latvia being free, there are no guarantees for the 
freedom of Poland as well, the Polish President Lech Walesa said 
at the signing ceremony in Riga castle. Earlier Walesa and 
Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis discussed a wide range of 
issues concerning the domestic and foreign policy of both 
countries, including privatization, foreign aid, security and 
defence problems. They agreed that the possibilities of 
cooperation had hardly been exhausted. 
  According to the Latvian president press report the Polish 
president said that other countries could view Latvia as an 
example in respect of the human rights. Speaking about the 
citizenship for the ethnic Poles in Latvia, Walesa also approved 
the suggestion to support Latvia in the international 
organizations as the human right situation in Latvia could be 
put forward as a positive example. 
  Then a joint declaration on strengthening the friendship and 
cooperation between Latvia and Poland was signed. 
  The document said that on the basis of historically friendly 
relations between the two nations and the re-establishment of 
relations at a state level in the early 1990's Latvia and Poland 
reaffirmed their commitment to continued development of these 
relations in compliance with the internationally accepted 
principles. They will support the settlement of conflicts 
through peaceful means with respect of the democratic principles 
and rights of ethnic minorities. 
  The parties agreed to maintain the bilateral relationship as 
well as to cooperate on the international level with the hope of 
resolving international problems in security, human rights and 
other fields. 
  They will continue the dialogue on the international issues 
of mutual interest and hold regular consultations at the highest 
level to achieve this aim. 
  Latvia and Poland agreed to coordinate their participation 
and initiatives within the framework of the NATO programme 
"Partnership for Peace" and said they were ready to develop and 
strengthen the CSCE process. 
  Both countries stressed in the declaration their recognition 
of the key role of the Council of Europe in strengthening 
democracy and human rights. Poland assured Latvia of its 
support in Latvia's attempts to join the organization. Both 
states suggested that more attention should be paid to increase 
the effectiveness of the cooperation between the Baltic States. 
  Another declaration that called to restore in effect the 
agreements signed between Latvia and Poland in 1922-38 and the 
agreement on legal assistance in respect of civil, marital and 
labour as well as criminal cases were also signed. 
  According to the governmental information agency, 
Latvian-Polish relations were discussed at the meeting between 
the Latvian prime minister, Valdis Birkavs, and the Polish 
president, Lech Walesa. Special attention was payed to the 
questions of cooperation in the spheres of economics and 
security. 
  It was admitted at the negotiations that the improvement of 
communication between the two states is very important for the 
development of cooperation between Latvia and Poland. In the 
near future, through bus service will be established between the 
two republics. Walesa was greatly interested in possible 
establishment of ferry service between Liepaja and Gdansk. The 
high-ranking guest spoke of the activization of negotiations 
among Latvia, Lithuania and Poland concerning the establishment 
of a railway corridor from Riga to the Polish frontier. Birkavs 
suggested that exhibitions of goods made in Poland and Latvia 
should be regularly organized in the two countries in order to 
promote the development of Latvian-Polish trade relations. 
  At the press conference after meeting with Lech Walesa, 
Valdis Birkavs said that Poland and Latvia are not satisfied 
with the partnership for peace program in respect of security 
guarantees for both states that the program does not provide. 
However, the sides find their participation positive, for it 
makes possible to introduce order into their armed forces. 
  Birkavs said the discussion also involved the issue of 
Kaliningrad area, with the numerous Russian troops stationed 
there as well as on the territory of Poland. On these grounds 
the future tackling the issue should be carried out on the 
international level. [passage omitted] 
  Today the Polish president continues his visit.

  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS -- The Council of Defence 
Ministers of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) will 
hold a two-day meeting in Moscow. The meeting will open at 
15:00 on Thursday [24 February], ITAR-TASS learnt at the public 
information centre of the headquarters on coordination of 
military cooperation between the CIS member states. 
  The meeting agenda consists of five items, including the 
approval of regulations on the Council of Defence Ministers of 
CIS member states. The decision on setting up the Council was 
adopted at the Commonwealth summit in Minsk in February 1992. 
  Today's meeting will sum up the results of drafting the main 
issues for coordinating military construction in the CIS. 
  The meeting will also decide on the staff establishment of 
the headquarters on coordination of military cooperation. It is 
supposed that the headquarters' divisions will be staffed on a 
coordination basis. 
  Its staff will consist of 250 people, including 120 from 
Russia. The headquarters is charged with collecting, summerising 
and analysing open information on the military and political 
situation in the world and regions of interest to the CIS 
countries. 
  The headquarters will also concert efforts to give mutual 
aid 
in creating and developing national armed forces. 
  The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border has become a 
traditional item at defence ministers' meetings over the recent 
past. The present meeting will decide on additional measures to 
stabilise the situation there. 
  The ministers will also discuss the celebration of the 50th 
anniversary since the end of the second world war. Meeting 
participants are supposed to take two decisions: measures to 
prepare for the celebration of the victory anniversary and to 
hold a spartakiad of CIS Armed Forces.

  [Text] Moscow February 24 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIISKIYE 
VESTI newspaper front-pages a series of reports under the 
general heading "non-payment" on a difficult social and economic 
situation of workers in the Russian Federation. 
  "February will soon be over, but wages have not been paid 
even for January," writes a worker from a Moscow engineering 
works. According to the works manager, "workshops are packed 
with ready-made products which are not paid for by customers. 
Non-payments topped one billion roubles". 
  In this connection, the newspaper cites the opinion of 
professor Valeriy Vorontsov, adviser to a Russian vice-premier. 
The government's economic and social policy, he writes, "should 
be conducted in such a way as to permit able-bodied citizens 
earn as much as it would be enough for their high living 
standards". 
  In the next few days, the government will discuss, he 
continued, "the guidelines of social policy for 1994" where it 
will be worded as a concrete programme "for the first time over 
the past years". 
  The TRUD newspaper features a interview with Gavriil Popov, 
leader of the Russian Movement of Democratic Reforms, who 
spelled out his ideas on how to pull the country out of the 
political and economic crisis. 
  "We have won nothing by destroying the Soviet Union," he 
stresses. "All republics thought that they would live well by 
separating from Russia. But they were labouring in the wrong. 
The West did not help us either. And will not help." 
  Popov expresses hope that his movement will make a 
contribution to a search for a new course of reforms meeting 
Russia's conditions. However, "there is no alternative to 
reforms," he claims. 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper singles out an article on 
forging the poll of December 12, 1993 on the draft Russian 
constitution. Facts of forgery were exposed, as a result of 
which the number of votes "for" were increased and votes 
"against" cut. 
  Rimma Korelova, a former member of a constituency electoral 
commission in the Far East, described these facts in an article 
published by the AMURSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper. She expressed 
protest in the newspaper and said that she quits the regional 
organisation "Democratic Russia". 
  The same newspaper prints an essay on Russian geopolitics 
under the headline "Russia's feat", which is to be continued. 
The essay was penned by Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the 
Russian Communist Party. 
  Tracing the sources for the growth of Russia's continental 
might which, according to the author, seemed "to be eternal and 
invincible", Zyuganov writes that, despite evident facts, "the 
20th Century was for our country a period of destructive social 
cataclysms". 
  To understand this, he believes it is necessary to turn to 
spiritual and conceptual processes which determined the strength 
of the Russian power. 
  The PRAVDA newspaper singles out an article by Valentin 
Kuptsov, first deputy chairman of the Russian Communist Party, 
where he advocates Russia's return to the socialist way of 
development. "Only the socialist locomotive will pull the 
country out of the crisis," Kuptsov claims. 
  The TRUD newspaper comments on a decision by the State Duma 
(lower house of the Russian parliament) on the political 
amnesty, claiming that "this is a clean victory of factions 
opposing the president" in the lower house. 
  Reporting a visit by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
to Prague where the Russian minister and Czech leaders focused 
on a Bosnian settlement, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries his interview. 
  The newspaper writes that "a chance has emerged to return 
from unilateral to joint efforts of the entire world community" 
to settle the Bosnian crisis. The Russian president's 
initiative gives such a chance. 
  The IZVESTIYA newspaper singles out a report on the arrest 
of 
Aldrich Ames, 52, "the most important foreign spy in the system 
of American intelligence" who worked for the KGB from 1985 and 
then for the Russian intelligence service. 
  Noting that U.S. experts express indignation at "Russia's 
perfidy" in their comments and that the master spy betrayed many 
American agents to Moscow, the newspaper writes: Russia "has the 
same rights to secret operations in the United States as America 
to espionage in Russia". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA notes that the arrest of Ames in the 
U.S. "can trigger the biggest spy scandal over the past years". 
  Writing about the same topic, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
newspaper notes that "his (Ames) recruitment and long-standing 
operations can be regarded as a clear success of national 
intelligence".

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 25 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's leading 
newspapers limit themselves mostly to a summary of the state of 
the nation address by Boris Yeltsin to the joint sitting of the 
Russian parliament, refraining from their own comments. 
  In the opinion of the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, "the president's 
speech signifies, to some extent, a new stage in the development 
of intra- state relations: the Russian parliament received for 
the first time a presidential message called upon to give 
guidelines in political, economic and social construction for 
1994". 
  "Legislators," the TRUD newspaper notes, "were waiting for 
the president's response to a decision taken by the lower house 
to pardon members of the state emergency committee (eds: they 
attempted an abortive coup in august 1991) as well as people 
involved in riots on May 1, 1993 and ringleaders of the coup in 
September-October 1993. 
  "But Yeltsin refrained from a direct appraisal. However, his 
speech contained the following idea: you can display mercy only 
if it does not contradict rules of law and morality." 
  "After reading the presidential message," the PRAVDA 
newspaper writes, "one is apt to ask the following question: is 
the country really changing the political, social and economic 
course in the interests of the majority of Russians or has Boris 
Yeltsin launched an election campaign for a new term of the 
presidency with his speech?" 
  The message, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper notes, "had 
to 
contain specific strategic plans of the president. However, the 
tradition of former reports on guidelines" which general 
secretaries of the former Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
liked to deliver, remained. 
  "Mr. Yeltsin limited himself to the enumeration of existing 
problems and general phrases on what direction should be taken 
to resolve them." 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper examines reasons for the 
arrest of CIA agent Aldrich Hazen Ames and his wife Maria del 
Rosario by FBI officers, to which American television was 
invited. 
  "Russia acted more confidently in the international arena in 
the recent past," the newspaper stresses. "Our diplomatic 
success in Bosnia and Herzegovina evidently exhausted the U.S. 
Administration's patience: Americans were snubbed there. 
  "Therefore, Ames's scandal broke out exactly at this time. 
It is precisely at this time that Washington wants to stop 
Moscow and to remind it who is master in the world. 
  "In good old times when a Western power fell into fits of 
hysteria about Soviet spies, Moscow replied with the principle 
of 'tit for tat': arrest for arrest, expulsion for expulsion. 
  "Even Mikhail Gorbachev acted the same way at the beginning 
of his rule. Later, political will weakened. Then, the Soviet 
Union collapsed. If Russia wants to display firmness, spies can 
be found in Moscow too." 
  TRUD runs its own material on the state's delays with 
payment 
of wages. The newspaper notes that "the Russian Statistics 
Committee reported: wage arrears more than doubled in january, 
totalling a sky-high sum of 1,681.3 billion roubles. Over 30,000 
enterprises in industry and agriculture did not pay wages and 
salaries to their employees." 
  The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper forecasts the dollar's 
exchange rate to the rouble in 1994. The newspaper believes that 
the dollar's rate will reach 2,650-3,190 roubles by the end of 
the year. 
  The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper prints a sensation that a 
Russian scholar designed an instrument for liaison with... 
Ghosts. "It would seem that talk about miracles is out of 
question in our era of pragmatism and scientific discoveries. 

    "But actualities of life beat our imagination. In any case, 
Gennadiy Markov of Novosibirsk invented an instrument for 
liaison with a supreme outer space intellect and carriers of its 
information -- ghosts." 
  St. Petersburg mayor Anatoliy Sobchak sent a proposal to 
Finnish Housing Minister Pirjo Rusanen: To complete the 
establishment of a joint stock society in the shortest possible 
time in order to implement a joint housing project in St. 
Petersburg -- "Northern Valley-Pargolovo". 
  The project is worth 15 billion Finnish marks and will be 
financed with credits from international banks and personal 
savings of future condominium owners, reports the VECHERNYY 
PETERBURG newspaper.

<F P=106> [From 25 February POSTIMEES, pp 1,3; "News Bulletin" No. </F>
38/94] 
  [Text] Friday, February 25 -- The celebration of the 76th 
anniversary of the Republic of Estonia opened with the 
traditional hoisting of flag to the Pikk Hermann tower at 
Toompea at sunrise. Riigikogu Speaker lo Nugis, vice-chairmen 
Edgar Savisaar and Tunne Kelam, Prime Minister Mart Laar as well 
as foreign diplomats attended the ceremony. Speaker Ulo Nugis 
held a speech, stressing that Estonia's history has been the 
history of freedom struggle and pointing out the dangers of the 
continued Russian military presence. But he assured that the 
events of 1939-1940 will not recur. Nugis added that the 
Riigikogu had managed to pass approximately one fifth of the 
laws necessary for the functioning of a democratic state. 
  The celebrations continued with the military parade on 
Vabaduse Square in Tallinn. Almost one thousand men from the 
Defence Forces units stationed in Tallinn (the Kalev and the 
Guard battalions), the Border Guard training centre, the Police 
Regiment, the rescue units and the Defence League, as well as 
103 war veterans and 34 members of the Defence League youth 
organisation were lined up on the square. President Lennart 
Meri arrived to receive the parade, Commander in Chief General 
Aleksander Einseln addressed the soldiers, pointing out that the 
Estonian volunteers had crushed a Soviet bridgehead at Riigikala 
near Narva exactly fifty years ago. He stressed the role of 
youth in Estonia's military history, drawing parallels between 
the present Defence Forces and the soldiers of 1944. "The 
emergence of a new and energetic leadership is a guarantee of 
Estonia's future," the general said. 
  President Meri addressed a meeting and concert in the 
"Estonia" Concert Hall at 1700. He warned against the possible 
return of the Soviet mentality, caused by the economic and 
political difficulties, and, especially, by the weakness of law 
enforcement. The president dedicates a large part of the 
anniversary speech to this problem, reminding that he had 
pointed out the vital importance of this problem already a year 
ago. However, the task of guaranteeing public safety has become 
even more important during the year, he said. "Theatre shows 
start at five in the afternoon, since the audience fears to move 
in the streets in the dark. The people fear to walk in parks 
even in daylight. The people fear village roads. The people 
fear a knock on the door. The Estonians do not feel to be the 
masters of their state," President Meri said, warning that this 
may have a number of serious consequences. The foreign 
investors may be discouraged by the growing lawlessness, the 
reputation of Estonia as a reliable partner suffers 
internationally, he stressed. The president saw a third threat 
in the desire for anti-democratic measures, provoked by the 
impotence of the law enforcement agencies. He referred to a 
recent call to use "state terror against criminal gangs" by a 
nationalist meeting as shameful. However, the primary aim of the 
state leadership and the nation in 1994 must be to guarantee law 
and order, President Meri stressed. 
  The president echoed some critics of the government who had 
claimed that Estonia needs a strong police force and border 
guard rather than powerful defence forces. "Despite everything, 
we have preferred the rapid building of the army to efficient 
control of the border. Now we are experiencing its painful 
backlash, since the disappearing sense of security and the 
growing organised crime are a direct result of this 
miscalculation," he said. The president mentioned the delayed 
negotiations with Russia, but expressed his conviction that 
Russia will withdraw its troops by August 31. He pointed out 
that Russian President Boris Yeltsin had recognised Estonia's 
75-year historic continuity in his message of congratulation. 
  The president dedicated the last part of his speech to the 
pensioners who have borne the brunt of the economic 
reorganisation. He mentioned a 94-year-old woman who had knit 
socks for the Defence Forces soldiers and hoped that the present 
generation could be said to have done as much in 94 years time. 
  The celebrations ended with a presidential reception in the 
"Sakala" Centre at 19.00 and a firework at 20.00

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 25 TASS -- The Committee for Defence 
and Security and the Committee for International Affairs of the 
Council of the Federation, the upper chamber of the Russian 
parliament, have recommended the latter to agree to send an 
additional 300-man military contingent to reinforce the U.N. 
peace-keeping forces in the Sarajevo zone, as requested by the 
Russian president. 
  This decision was adopted today during a joint meeting of 
the 
foregoing committees, which discussed Boris Yeltsin's 
corresponding request to the Council of the Federation, made in 
reply to an appeal of the U.N. secretary-general, ITAR-TASS was 
told by Petr Premyak, vice-chairman of the Committee for Defence. 
  This item was included in today's agenda of the upper 
chamber's work. The committees also want the parliament to 
recommend the Foreign Ministry "to find political ways for 
normalising relations in that region, instead of steadily 
drawing Russia into the conflict," the deputy said. He also 
stated that Russian troops were being deployed in the most 
difficult spots of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In his opinion, this 
is because representatives of the Russian Defence Ministry had 
not been included in the command of the U.S. joint forces. "This 
omission must be corrected," the Russian MPs believe. 
  The meeting also discussed cash allowances to Russian 
servicemen. They now receive from the United Nations wages, 
money for the upkeep of hardware, and food allowances in amounts 
equalling to those received by units deployed at home. However, 
in accordance with traditional rules, these payments should be 
100-200 per cent higher in combat conditions. Premyak said that 
this point should be included in the State Duma's bill on the 
Russian U.N. peacekeeping contingent, which is now being drawn 
up. 
  Russian airborne troops commander Colonel-General Yevgeniy 
Podkolzin, who attended the meeting of the two committees, told 
ITAR-TASS that there were now twelve hundred Russian servicemen 
in the conflict zone. If the Council of the Federation decides 
to send there an additional contingent, it will apparently be 
flown there in his planes this April.

  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS -- The press service of the 
Federal Assembly circulated the text of the memorandum of accord 
on Thursday. 
  Following is the full text of the memorandum of accord. 
<H6>  "Memorandum of Accord </H6>
  "Realising the complexity of the political and economic 
situation in our society and the need to take urgent and 
constructive measures to ensure Russia's safe exit from the 
crisis situation on the basis of the consolidation of all power 
structures and political forces, we adopt this memorandum.

we have reached an understanding on the following goals: 
  "To establish genuine democracy on the basis of the strict 
observance of constitutional norms and laws of the Russian 
Federation, to increase the responsibility of all levels of 
bodies of power for the state of law and order and for ensuring 
the safety of the individual, society and the state. 
  "To provide for economic growth of the country on the basis 
of the development of all forms of ownership, regulated market 
relations, state support for the national economy, increasing 
economic independence of regions and manufacturers, reducing 
federal expenditures. 
  "To ensure an even distribution of the burden of the crisis 
between regions and social groups, support for socially 
vulnerable groups of the population as necessary conditions for 
society's agreement with the proposed pace and direction of 
reform. 
  "To reverse moral degradation of society, restore the 
prestige of honest labour, create conditions for the development 
of the individual and respect for the rights and freedoms of the 
human being. 
  "We are convinced of the inadmissibility of destabilisation 
in a country which possesses huge arsenals of weapons, including 
weapons of mass destruction, the loss of control over which may 
have catastrophic consequences for mankind. Considering this, 
we believe it imperative to conduct a political struggle within 
a legal framework, without resorting to or calling for any form 
of violence, national hatred or persecution of dissidents. 
  "In order to reach civil accord, we believe it necessary for 
the bodies of executive and legislative power to jointly 
consider the entire set of problems faced by political, economic 
and social reforms in society. 
  "We suggest that the government of the Russian Federation in 
cooperation with the committees, factions and deputy groups of 
the State Duma and the Federation Council, with the president of 
the Russian Federation acting as coordinator, work out within 
the next two to three months a package of concerted measures to 
resolve the crisis with the participation of the country's 
specialists, politicians and public figures. 
  "As far as regional policy is concerned, we agree to refrain 
from separatist approaches and insist on settling disputable 
issues through conciliatory procedures within the framework of 
the integral federation. 
  "As concerning relations with the states -- republics of the 
former Soviet Union, we consider it important for Russia to 
abide by a policy aimed at strengthening inter-state relations 
and mutually advantageous economic ties, excluding actions aimed 
at provoking conflicts. 
  "Amnesty for people who are currently under investigation or 
custody in connection with the events of August 19-21, 1991, May 
1, 1993 and September 21 -- October 4, 1993, as well as amnesty 
for a number of people who have been sentenced for crimes in the 
economic sphere could become an integral part of the drive aimed 
at reaching national accord by the people of Russia. 
  "We are convinced that only if all the constructive forces 
of 
society promptly develop coordinated measures on the basis of 
goals and principles proposed by this memorandum will ensure the 
country be ensured of a safe exit from the current crisis.

  [Text] At the House of Government in Minsk, the 13th 
session of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet continues its work. 
Deputies began their working day, as usual, with the 
miscellaneous section, which was followed by the registration -- 
279 people's deputies attended today's debate. After that, 
deputies returned to the issues that they began to discuss at 
yesterday's session -- draft legislation on local administration 
and the economy of the Republic of Belarus and new legislation 
on Supreme Soviet elections. While the first bill was approved 
quickly, clashes erupted over the second one, and as the result, 
it was submitted for further consideration. 
  Having done this, the deputies began to adopt one piece of 
legislation after another with renewed zeal. Thus, without 
special difficulties, the draft housing code of the Republic of 
Belarus, the draft program for housing development, and draft 
legislation of public roads were adopted. Issues connected with 
taxes, however, generated many disagreements among deputies.

  [Text] Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev categorically refuted 
the allegations by certain media on establishment of some NATO 
military facilities on Kyrgyz territory. He emphasized that the 
only way to ensure the republic's sovereignty, independence and 
territorial integrity was to develop its relations with the CIS 
under the treaty on common security for the CIS states. 
  According to Akayev, Russian-Kyrgyz military cooperation 
could be implemented only in accordance with this treaty as it 
was pointed out at the negotiations with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin. The Kyrgyz president announced that this provided for 
a radical assistance with stabilization of the inferior 
political situation in Kyrgyzstan, in particular, in the Gorno 
Badakhshan region. According to the Kyrgyz leader, this was 
vitally important since the culmination of migration from 
Kyrgyzstan had coincided with the civil war in Tajikistan. 
  Akayev stressed that the dynamic of migration of Russian 
speaking population from Kyrgyzstan was not due to nationalist 
dispositions or strengthening of the Islamic forces, contrary to 
the situation in other CIS Asian states. 
  The migration was due to the social and economic problems. 
The language barrier is now not that important, the Kyrgyz 
president said. Akayev explained this by the energetic actions 
of the Kyrgyz leadership aimed at preserving the role and the 
space for the Russian language in Kyrgyzstan. 
  He made it known that 120,000 Russians had left Kyrgyzstan 
for the last two years. The Kyrgyz president reassured that 
everything possible would be done so that other 900,000 Russians 
"determining the democratic path of Kyrgyzstan" remain in the 
republic.

"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] Imamali Rakhmanov, chairman of the Tajik Supreme 
Soviet, arrived in Tashkent on a short visit today. 
  Serious and painful problems of the Tajik economy were 
discussed at the talks with Uzbek President Islam Karimov at the 
palace of friendship among peoples. In the opinion of the two 
leaders, Tajikistan's economic problems can only be surmounted 
if the social and political situation is stable, 
  A bilateral agreement on trade and economic cooperation 
between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan was signed as a result of the 
talks. 
  The news conference held after the signing of the document, 
however, was dominated by political issues, among them the 
problem of settling military conflicts along the Tajik-Afghan 
border and the attitude towards the state of affairs in 
Afghanistan. 
  Referring to these issues, the heads of the two states 
replied that they adhered to a policy of non-interference in 
Afghanistan's internal affairs and that stability in Afghanistan 
could only be guaranteed if Afghanistan chooses in favor of a 
democratic development. 
  Islam Karimov said that the presence of Russia's 
peacekeeping 
forces here was essential to ensure calm in the whole Central 
Asian region.

  [Text] Vyacheslav Chornovil, the leader of the Ukrainian 
Popular Rukh, said the President Leonid Kravchuk's announcement 
that he will not run for presidency was a tactical gimmick. 
  He told Interfax-Ukraine that the statement of the 
president's press service made public Wednesday had not said 
anything of his unwillingness to run n the elections. What 
Kravchuk is doing, Chornovil thinks, is trying to foil the 
presidential elections, at least in June. 
  Chornovil was one of Kravchuk's rivals in the December 1991 
presidential elections.

confidence that the West would support the Russian President's 
idea of holding a meeting with the leaders of the United States, 
Britain, France, and Germany on the Yugoslav conflict. He 
stated this during a conversation with journalists in Moscow, 
RIA reports. 
  Karasin noted that at present, Russia thinks that the main 
thing in the search for a settlement in Yugoslavia is not to 
lose impetus. As has already been reported, this week the 
Russian president invited the leaders of the United States, 
Britain, France, and Germany to hold a joint meeting. It should 
result in the signing of a joint document that would put an end 
to bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] President Yeltsin has urged the Federation Council 
to endorse the dispatch of an additional military contingent 
numbering 300 men to join the U.N. peace-keeping forces in 
former Yugoslavia "with a view to ensuring control over the 
implementation of an agreement on a peaceful solution to the 
conflict, and over the unconditional observance of the agreement 
to cease fire in the area of Sarajevo by the warring sides". 
  The Russian president made this appeal in connection with a 
request from the U.N. Secretary General. The relevant draft 
resolution instructs Russia's government to resolve the issues 
connected with the forming of a corresponding volunteer military 
contingent. 
  The Federation Council decided to consider this issue in the 
framework of its defence and security committee Friday morning, 
and discuss it at its evening session the same day.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report under the "Power" rubric: "The </F>
Declaration of Rights of a Self-Respecting State. Russia Is 
Intent on Pursuing its Legitimate Interests `Firmly and 
Resolutely'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The foreign policy section of 
President Yeltsin's message did not contain any surprises for 
specialists. It was but the quintessence of concepts and 
formulas that have been road-tested by Russian diplomats at 
various international forums for some time now. Such as, for 
instance, the European security and partnership concept, which 
has just been announced by Andrey Kozyrev in Krakow. Provisions 
interpreting regional policy principles have also been basically 
well known. In this sense, the section is not "portentous." 
  What is striking in it in the first place is the absence in 
the paragraph devoted to the Balkan crisis of the proposal for a 
summit of the Group of Five to be convened, a proposal that the 
Russian president put forward as recently as this week. 
Presumably, facing an obstructionist stance by its Western 
partners, Moscow thought it prudent not to press the issue. The 
other day, your SEGODNYA correspondent happened to hear a 
conversation between two high-ranking officials from the Foreign 
Ministry and the presidential administration. The former told 
his interlocutor that representatives of a number of European 
countries have been bewildered by the format of the proposed 
summit: Russia, after all, wants to join the Group of Seven, 
not the Group of Five. The diplomat suggested that the question 
of format be left open. So, it cannot be ruled out that the 
Russian initiative will be repackaged so that it will boil down 
to the discussion of the Bosnian settlement within the framework 
of the Group of Seven meeting in Naples. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Moscow has no intention of taking the side of any 
party involved in the conflict in former Yugoslavia, said the 
head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, upon his return from 
a trip to Greece, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. 
  "The essence of Russian initiative is to nudge Bosnia's 
warring sides toward a peaceful solution to the problem," he 
told Russian journalists who accompanied him. "Russia must use 
its historically established ties with the Serbs to nudge them 
toward dialogue, not to encourage aggression." 
  The issue of Russia's policy toward the former Eastern bloc 
countries cropped up more than once during his conversations in 
European capitals. Kozyrev assured his partners in the talks 
that Moscow is nurturing no "imperial plans", that it is 
prepared "to cooperate with everyone on the basis of 
neighborliness and mutual benefit". 
  According to him, the intention of Central and East European 
countries to join NATO is no obstacle to this. "We do not rule 
out the possibility that Russia will also become part of NATO 
some time, but today the idea of partnership is of key 
importance," Kozyrev stressed. 
  In this context NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program 
acquires special importance, the head of Russian diplomacy said. 
"There is a need to create a system of "cross-guarantees" by 
means of signing corresponding agreements with each European 
state separately," he said. 
  Wednesday morning, addressing a conference on the prospects 
for Russian-Polish relations in Krakow, Kozyrev formulated 
Russia's concept of European partnership, which provides for 
transforming the Conference for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE) into an "effective regional political 
organization, and the North-Atlantic Council for Cooperation 
into an independent structure of politico-military cooperation 
closely connected with the CSCE. 
  When asked about his attitude to the Liberal Democratic 
Party 
and its leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Kozyrev said: "I 
instructed the Foreign Ministry's press service to neither read 
what Zhirinovskiy says, nor react to it".

  [Text] Moscow February 25 TASS -- "The use of peace-keeping 
forces to settle the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina is 
necessary," Vladimir Podoprigora, chairman of the upper chamber 
committee on international affairs, said in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS here on Friday. 
  He noted that he was in the Dniester area where there were 
hostilities between the Moldovan Government and the breakaway 
Dniester Republic, and in Nagorno-Karabakh. He also visited 
other "flash points" in the world and drew the conclusion that 
it is impossible, as a rule, to settle such conflicts without 
the participation of peace keepers. 
  The upper chamber committees on international affairs as 
well 
as on security and defence will discuss, at a joint sitting, the 
question on dispatching an additional military contingent to the 
U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia. 
  The committees will debate a request by the U.N. 
secretary-general addressed to the Russian president to send an 
additional military contingent to the U.N. Protection Force 
stationed in Bosnia and Herzegovina in connection with the 
conclusion of agreements on a peaceful settlement of the 
conflict and a ceasefire in the Sarajevo zone. 
  In compliance with the Russian Constitution, the province of 
the Federation Council (upper chamber of the Russian parliament) 
includes "the question on possible use of the Russian Armed 
Forces outside the territory of the Russian Federation". 
  The preliminary debate on the issue will be conducted by the 
committees which will submit their proposal to a plenary session 
of the upper chamber. The Federation Council will debate the 
question on dispatching an additional military contingent 
numbering 300 to participate in the U.N. Protection Force to 
ensure control over the implementation of the agreement on a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict.

  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS--Good military training of 
Russian commandos shown during their redisposition to the 
Sarajevo region was highly estimated by NATO generals, deputy 
supreme commander of the NATO Joint Armed Forces in Europe, 
General John Waters, who arrived in Moscow on a working visit 
today, told ITAR-TASS. 
  The NATO commander who prior to his appointment to a high 
post in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headed the land 
forces in Britain, said he envied his colleague in Bosnia who 
had received such a powerful and well trained reinforcement. 
  Speaking on the difficulties connected with the 
redisposition 
of the Russian blue helmets, John Waters noted that he knew that 
Russian commandos' training was passing in much more complex 
conditions, therefore he would rather be surprised if Russian 
soldiers and officers had not fulfilled their command's order. 
  The British General highly appraised Russia's efforts aimed 
at settling the armed conflict in Bosnia and stressed that the 
NATO welcomed any step which would stop killing people. 
  John Waters noted that air strikes, as the events in the 
Persian Gulf had shown, would have resulted in unjustified 
victims amongst the civil population. 
  The general said that additional peacekeeping forces should 
be brought to the region of confrontation specifying that this 
problem should be resolved by politicians. 
  The program of the NATO general's visit to Moscow which will 
last until February 26, includes his meetings with the 
leadership of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces and 
the commander-in-chief of the land forces. 
  John Waters will also deliver several lectures on the theme 
"The NATO Bloc in a Stage of Transformation" to students and 
teachers of the Academy of the General Staff, and other 
institutions of the Russian Defense Ministry.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under "Distant Foreign Parts" rubric: </F>
"Moscow Calls for Pressure To Be Exerted on the Bosnian 
Government"] 
  [Text] Russia is urging the United States and the European 
Union [EU] to "exert the necessary influence over the Bosnian 
Government to make it cooperate with the United Nations in the 
matter of completely unblocking and demilitarizing Sarajevo. 
[no closing quotation mark as published] This is stated in a 
Russian Federation Foreign Ministry statement disseminated at 
the United Nations 22 February as a Security Council document, 
ITAR-TASS reports. 
  "In recent days," the document points out, "Russia has 
undertaken additional efforts to realize its initiative with 
regard to unblocking Sarajevo and transferring this city to UN 
control, which it advanced back at the 47th General Assembly 
Session. We have sought and are seeking to implement this 
initiative by acting openly within the framework of Security 
Council resolutions." 
  It points out that "as a result of the steps taken by the 
leadership of Russia and intensive diplomatic work, this firm 
and consistent line, which rules out unilateral ultimatums, has 
produced a result." "In response to our appeal the Bosnian 
Serbs adopted a decision at their assembly in Pale to withdraw 
their heavy arms from the Sarajevo reigon. We reckon that this 
show of goodwill by one of the sides involved in the conflict at 
a critical moment for a settlement will elicit equally specific 
countersteps.... We also urge our partners in the Bosnian 
settlement -- above all, the United States and the EU countries 
-- in the spirit of their statements on the preferability of a 
political solution to the problem, to exert the necessary 
influence over the Bosnian Government to make it cooperate with 
the United Nations in the matter of completely unblocking and 
demilitarizing Sarajevo," the statement reads. 
  Russia has proposed that, following the unblocking of 
Sarajevo, the UN Security Council urgently begin examining ways 
to establish an administration in this city, as well as measures 
to strengthen other safe areas on the territory of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stanislav Kondrashov: "The Image Russia Has </F>
Acquired by Its Sarajevo Presence"] 
  [Text] Initially it appeared to be merely a protest by an 
aggrieved Russia, then it assumed the shape of a diplomatic 
initiative which forestalled a dangerous escalation of the 
Bosnian conflict. 
  Initially, Yeltsin, standing next to the British prime 
minister, sharply stated that Moscow would not allow the Bosnian 
conflict to be resolved without its involvement; and this came 
across as a public challenge to NATO, which had resolved to bomb 
the Serbian artillery around Sarajevo without enquiring about 
the Russian leadership's opinion. But, one day later, on 17 
February, Russia's deft maneuver had resolved the very problem 
which the NATO countries were intending to tackle by means of 
combat aircraft on the night of 20-21 February. 
  It was a masterstroke of diplomacy that, albeit to varying 
degrees, satisfied everyone: It secured a cease-fire and 
stopped the multiplication of casualties while humiliating no 
one, each side being allowed to save face. The Serbs withdrew 
their heavy armaments but not, as it were, under the pressure of 
a NATO ultimatum but at the request of their Russian brothers. 
The West, not without a sense of relief, called off 
(postponed?) its risky bombing experiment in the Balkans, while 
the inhabitants of Sarajevo came out on to the streets without 
fear of shells or mortar projectiles. 
  And Russia? At a critical moment Russia's new partners had, 
as it were, assigned it an insignificant role, while it had -- 
in a single move -- placed itself at the center of attention. 
Yes, precisely at that moment Russia found the important and 
only proper place for itself and played the role which no one 
else could. Hats off! And, although we are not dealing with a 
happy end but merely with an episode in a tragedy to which no 
end is in sight, you cannot fail to be delighted at the skill 
shown by our country's diplomats, those people who brilliantly 
prepared the initiative behind the scenes, allowing the Russian 
president, who sealed the initiative with his assent and 
signature, to reap the reward. 
  Such obvious successes in the search for a role and identity 
are very rare, and for that reason you are doubly delighted that 
realism mingled with a sense of dignity prevailed, while foreign 
policy romanticism is disappearing just as its counterpart -- 
market romanticism -- has disappeared. They have, by the way, 
exhibited common traits -- an intoxification with the West's 
prescriptions to the point of losing all sense of proportion and 
sense of personal identity. 
  In the case of Yugoslavia this loss occurred when Russia 
joined in the economic blockade of Serbia, forgetting that 
history looks different from Moscow, Washington, or Bonn and 
that it is not the Americans and the Germans but the Russians 
who would have to pay the price. As a result we lost, I think, 
in the eyes of the South Slavs more than we did during the 
period of Stalin's split with Tito's Yugoslavia and the many 
years of suspicious rejection of a country building its own 
route to socialism. Thank God, the intolerable nature of that 
loss was realized pretty quickly -- and not without pressure 
from both moderate and implacable critics in the Supreme Soviet, 
which has now disappeared into history. And historically strong 
roots of pragmatism were preserved within the Foreign Ministry. 
No one has worked so hard as Deputy Minister Vitaliy Churkin in 
reestablishing our severed links with brother Slavs. The most 
recent example of Russia's restored position is the friendly 
reception accorded Russian peacemaking soldiers around Sarajevo. 
  When speaking about the components of our success, in 
addition to the foreign elements, it is necessary to highlight 
the domestic, Russian ones. The foreign elements are obvious 
and have already been mentioned. The domestic, Russian ones 
reside in the fact that essentially the whole of Russian society 
and all political factions -- ranging from Gaydar to 
Zhirinovskiy -- have approved what happened. In current times 
such a consensus is an extraordinarily rare, extraordinarily 
important, and wholly understandable thing. Not only diplomats 
but society too needs examples of self-confirmation. Foreign 
policy begins at home. National interest is developed and 
guaranteed by a degree of national accord. It is perfectly 
obvious that in the latest episode in the Bosnian crisis the 
Russian diplomatic service operated skillfully not just because 
it put forward a solution which took account of the real 
situation and position of the direct participants in the 
conflict but also because (mainly because) it felt support back 
on the "home front." 
  And yet until quite recently and quite often more concern 
was 
paid to the reaction of our foreign partners. From that 
perspective, we have also bidden farewell to foreign policy 
romanticism, which Vladimir Lukin, who was Russian ambassador to 
the United States and has now been elected chairman of the State 
Duma Committee for International Affairs, persists in calling -- 
and with reason -- "infantile pro-Americanism." Whereas 
previously the main thing when determining our stance on the 
Yugoslav question was achieving consensus with the West, for the 
sake of which we neglected our own public opinion, now, 
especially since the December elections, pride of place is taken 
by domestic consensus, which neither the president nor the 
Foreign Ministry can ignore. Foreign policy, if it is to be 
sound, must be based on majority support within the country -- 
which is an indispensable rule for democratic states. American, 
German, British, and other Western diplomats operate within this 
constraint, accepting it as a fact of life. 
  Ultimately, whether you approve or even if you don't, it is 
Russian policy that takes account of Russian interest based on 
Russian public opinion which is taken seriously. 
  Hence the respect for Moscow's independent initiative in 
lifting the siege of Sarajevo, particularly if it also holds out 
the promise of breaking the deadlock, a deadlock created not 
without the West's involvement.

<F P=106> [Report by Andrey Baturin and Sergey Gryzunov of RIA NOVOSTI </F>
specially for IZVESTIYA: "Meeting Between Serbian General and 
Russian Colonel Ends According to Orthodox Custom"] 
  [Text] Belgrade--Sarajevo is returning to normal life after 
700 days of blockade. Following the withdrawal of 260 Serb and 
47 Muslim artillery pieces and their transfer to the control of 
the UN peacekeeping forces, the citizens -- Muslims, Serbs, and 
Croats -- can wake up without fearing for their lives. 
  Our paratroopers are installed in the building of a former 
police school. Their commander, Colonel Viktor Vorobyev, has 
held a working meeting with General Stanislav Galic, commander 
of the Sarajevo-Romanija corps, which is keeping its sights on 
the capital of Bosnia. The discussion concerned the stationing 
of guys from Ryazan and Pskov on the demarcation line between 
the Muslim and Serb infantry within the precincts of the city. 
  As Serb sources reported, the meeting between the Serb 
general and the Russian colonel ended with "a toast according to 
the old orthodox custom." 
  The presence of Vorobyev's men -- the weighty argument of 
the 
Russian diplomatic initiative -- has stabilized the situation 
around Sarajevo. However, as one of the UN commanders expressed 
himself, it will not be easy for the peacekeeping forces to 
maintain an island of peace in a sea of war. 
  In this connection, it appears that the United Nations will 
come up against specific difficulties in carrying out the 
operation to open the airfield in Tuzla, which is scheduled for 
7 March. Official sources have reported that air support from 
NATO forces will be used during the operation if need be. The 
Serbs are keeping the airfield in the sights of their artillery, 
suspecting that it may be used not for the delivery of 
humanitarian aid, but as a new channel for supplying the Muslims 
with weapons. 
  Over 1 million civilian inhabitants, mainly Muslims, in 
Central Bosnia, where Tuzla is located, are waiting desperately 
for the opening of the airfield. They are disastrously short of 
food and medicines, the UN Office of High Commissioner for 
Refugees, has reported from its Sarajevo base. 
  Meanwhile, in downtown Belgrade, a street musician is 
endlessly playing Russian tunes on the accordion, hooligans have 
defaced the French memorial, drawing a swastika on it as revenge 
for the NATO ultimatum, and Western diplomats and members of 
their families are quietly getting ready to go back, while local 
experts analyze the critical situation which has been favorably 
resolved for all the sides. 
  The names of Boris Yeltsin and Andrey Kozyrev, to which a 
number of local publications and activists had pinned labels of 
the type "betrayers of the Slav peoples and orthodoxy," are 
being praised to the skies. And those who yesterday were 
conducting dialogue only with Khasbulatov and Zhirinovskiy, 
counting on help from Cossacks and secret Russian weapons, are 
today holding rallies of gratitude outside the Russian Embassy.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS--If facilities for recycling 
liquid radioactive waste is not built in Russia's Far East 
within the next two months, Russia will possibly have to dump 
this waste in the Sea of Japan again in order to avert an 
ecological disaster. 
  A choice whether to build the appropriate recycling 
facilities estimated at about 10 million dollars or to dump the 
waste in the sea is to be made by the Russian Government, 
according to Viktor Kutsenko, head of the Russian Ministry for 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources' Department for 
Ecological Safety. He also said the government was presently 
considering a request from the ministry to immediately solve the 
issue of waste disposal. 
  Taking into account the current financial difficulties and 
therefore uncertainty over the recycling facilities project, 
Russia did not join the London convention on a complete ban on 
dumping radioactive and industrial wastes in the seas, which 
took effect from February 21. 
  Not acceding to the convention, Russia is losing 
politically, 
believes Valeriy Chelyukanov, a senior official at the Russian 
Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environment Monitoring. 
However, from the point of view of ecological safety, this 
decision was fully justified. If something happens to the 
tanker overloaded with liquid radioactive waste, which is now at 
moorage in the Zolotoy Rog bay near Vladivostok, the environment 
and people's health will be heavily damaged. 
  Waste dumping in the sea does not threaten a catastrophe. A 
high-speed tanker dumps its load in the open sea, and the wastes 
are instantly dissolved in the water. Taking into consideration 
the present radioactive contamination of the Sea of Japan, 
"Russia's supplement" will be negligible and not cause any 
damage for the environment.

  [Text] Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy 
Adamishin and Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda, 
who met in Moscow Wednesday, expressed the desire of both 
countries to expand political and other contacts and to improve 
the atmosphere of partnership, confidence and good neighborly 
relations. 
  According to Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy 
Karasin, Russia's joining the G-7 group of most advanced 
countries would open up new vistas for cooperation in 
international issues. 
  He told journalists that the Japanese official wanted to 
have 
a better insight into the political situation in Russia. 
"Unambiguous remarks made by President Boris Yeltsin and Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin were quoted to show that Russia 
will stay on the reform course," Karasin said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Moscow Radio commentator Yuriy Afonin] </F>
  [Text] Russia-Japan vice foreign ministerial talks were 
held on 21 and 22 February, with working-level meetings also 
held under the framework of the talks. 
  At the talks, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Panov and 
Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Fukuda exchanged wide-ranging 
views on international issues and the situation in the 
Asia-Pacific region, and discussed bilateral issues. At the 
talks they also discussed future steps the two countries should 
take to conclude a peace treaty, and ways to resolve bilateral 
issues. Moscow Radio commentator Yuriy Afonin comments on the 
outcome of the talks: 
  [Begin recording] The talks drew a great deal of attention 
in both Russia and Japan because they were held to exchange 
views between the two countries for the first time since 
President Yeltsin visited Japan. The world is now faced with 
many important issues. One of the issues is the Russian 
parliamentary elections that resulted in concerns over Russia's 
future foreign policy. At the talks, both sides affirmed the 
validity of an agreement that was signed by the leaders of 
Russia and Japan when President Yeltsin visited Japan last 
October. In other words, both sides affirmed a genuine 
partnership between the two countries. With the Moscow talks, 
Russia-Japan political dialogue has now entered a new stage and 
set the future direction of Russia-Japan relations. At the 
talks both sides agreed in principle that Foreign Minister Hata 
will visit Russia in March this year to hold talks with his 
Russian counterpart in accordance with a Tokyo Declaration 
provision on the revitalization of political dialogue between 
the two countries. The schedule for Foreign Minister Hata's 
visit to Russia is to be decided through diplomatic channels. 
  It can be said that preparations have now begun for 
improving 
Russia-Japan relations. At the talks, both sides agreed to hold 
a meeting of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Committee on 
Economy, Science and Technology in April, at the earliest. The 
talks focused on discussion of ways to conclude a peace treaty. 
The two countries should consistently take steps toward 
resolving bilateral issues in order to normalize their 
relations. The two countries also should cooperate closely in 
deepening mutual understanding between their people, and in 
creating a good environment in the two countries. The two 
countries will prepare proposals aimed at reaching agreement on 
certain issues when Foreign Minister Hata visits Russia. The 
closeness and similarity of the two countries' positions on 
international matters and issues in the Asia-Pacific region are 
of great significance to the future of relations between Russia 
and Japan. This will serve to expand their cooperation in the 
United Nations and the international community, just as they 
cooperated in Cambodia. 
  There are many common positions between Russia and Japan on 
the issue of the Korean peninsula. The two countries will also 
attend a conference on ASEAN security in Bangkok in July this 
year. At the Moscow talks, both sides agreed on a common 
approach to the issue of security in the Asia-Pacific region. 
It can be said that the Russia-Japan vice foreign ministerial 
talks took a concrete step toward strengthening the relations of 
trust between the two countries. 
  These are my comments on the on-going Russia-Japan dialogue.

<F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin Have Not </F>
Yet Made Their Speeches, but the Japanese Already Know What They 
Will Say"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- While the Russian audience waits 
impatiently to find out what the statesmen will say to it and 
what will happen next in our unpredictable life, foreign 
impatience along the same lines is already assuaged -- this is 
an interesting natural law that is currently being observed. 
  The latest confirmation of this is the news "double" just 
seen in Japan -- YOMIURI SHIMBUN has informed the Japanese about 
what Yeltsin intends to say in his message to parliament at the 
end of the month, and KYODO has told them where Chernomyrdin 
will be leading the country when he presents the new budget. 
  The Japanese agency got its hands on a copy of the speech 
which Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is expected to deliver soon in 
parliament. According to the document acquired by the Japanese, 
the Russian head of government will announce a strengthening of 
state control of the economy, prices, and the process of the 
economic management of enterprises. At the same time 
Chernomyrdin will declare his intention to continue the reforms, 
but he will emphasize that, if need be, the state will intervene 
actively in economic matters. Price control will be revived in 
sectors where state enterprises dominate. This control is 
expected to entail enterprises' signing price agreements on 
government recommendations. Apart from that, enterprises will 
be obliged to coordinate with the government the price levels 
for their output, the level of wages, and ways in which the 
profit obtained will be disposed of. This coordination will be 
a basic condition for enterprises to receive state subsidies and 
credits. As far as privatization is concerned, Chernomyrdin 
will promise to continue it but will note that, when it leads to 
increased prices, the need for a monopolized market will remain. 
  As the Japanese, now familiar with a document that has yet 
to 
be delivered, are observing, in general the premier's report 
stresses that the reforms will continue, the planned economy is 
not being revived, and what is intended is merely a question of 
strengthening elements of state administrative control which, in 
fact, are routine throughout the rest of the world. With the 
help of these elements Chernomyrdin will promise to knock 
inflation down to a level of 7-9 percent by the end of the year. 
  For the uninformed it is interesting to know that in his 
future speech the Russian president will devote a whole 
paragraph in the section on international policy to relations 
with Japan. As YOMIURI reports, citing reliable sources close 
to the president in Moscow, there are as many as five different 
versions of this paragraph. All of them note that Russia and 
Japan must develop mutual relations, particularly in the 
economic sphere, basing themselves on agreements reached during 
Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last year. The differences among 
the five versions are small in principle and concern the 
formulation of the most delicate question in bilateral relations 
-- the territorial question. Moscow sources have revealed to 
YOMIURI that in some versions the territorial question is not 
mentioned at all, in others it is not mentioned "by name," while 
in the most "specific" version it is designated as existing but 
linked to Russian domestic difficulties. The sources stated in 
addition that Russia cannot neglect relations with Japan but 
that the president's speech will, as far as possible, give the 
subject short shrift in order not to "upset nationalists at 
home." 
  In short, Tokyo is already studying our leaders' upcoming 
speeches while we here continue to follow Russian events through 
foreign sources. News here is clearly fresher and more up to 
date....

  A Russian Constitutional Court source said the president 
has neither the authority nor the moral right to veto the 
amnesty resolution passed by the State Duma, the lower house of 
parliament. 
  The source, who asked not to be identified, told Interfax 
that, under the Constitution, the resolution is not subject to 
approval by either the upper house of the legislature or the 
president. The resolution is thus definitive and cannot be 
revised, but theoretically it can be checked by the 
Constitutional Court, the source said.

  [Text] Deputy of the Council of Federation, one of the 
defendants in the State of Emergency Committee case told 
Interfax on Thursday that all those accused on that case will 
take a joint decision whether they will take advantage of the 
amnesty declared by the State Duma the day before. 
  "Neither I, nor my comrades, have not committed any crime in 
August of 1991. We were defending the Constitution of the USSR 
and trying to rescue the country from collapse and death. An 
amnesty is applied to criminals, and we are not criminals," 
Starodubtsev said. 
  At the same time, he called the State Duma resolution on the 
amnesty "a courageous step" showing that "the Duma will not be 
obedient."

  [Text] Those arrested for their part in the Moscow riots of 
October 3 and 4 will not be released tonight. 
  The attorneys of some of them told Interfax that the 
investigators explained the delay by saying that the State Duma 
decision to declare amnesty on February 23 had to be first 
published in newspapers. Only then will they show the text to 
the accused and ask if they accept the amnesty. 
  Numerous attorneys do not rule out the possibility that some 
of the detainees who do not feel they are guilty of organizing 
riots will reject the offer of release. Under the existing 
legislation those charged with criminal offenses are pardoned by 
the state but are not rehabilitated for their activities which 
are regarded as criminal by the investigators. 
  Larisa Dementyeva, the attorney of Aleksandr Barkashov, 
leader of the Russian National Unity, said that her client would 
most probably agree to be pardoned. She emphasized Barkashov 
was in poor health following several surgeries for a wound he 
had received last December. He is now in the medical ward of 
Matrosskaya Tishina investigating prison and will most probably 
be hospitalized Friday. 
  Dmitry Shteinberg, the attorney of former security minister 
Viktor Barannikov, told Interfax that his client had left the 
hospital for home. He had undertaken not to leave the city. 
The doctors insist that he is too sick to be questioned. 
  Meanwhile, the Izvestiya daily reports that Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, Russian president's press secretary, said outside the 
Federal Assembly hall Thursday that nobody will leave Lefortovo 
or Matrosskaya Tishina prisons in the coming weeks, if not 
months. He described the amnesty as immoral because the 
detainees had blood on their hands.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Olga Colodova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS -- Aleksandr Barkashov, 
leader of the Russian National Unity Nazi-inspired organisation, 
will not refuse the amnesty offered by the State Duma (the lower 
chamber of the Russian parliament) on Wednesday, if it applies 
to him. Barkashov's men took an active part in the hard-line 
revolt last October. ITAR-TASS learned of Barkoshov's 
intentions on Thursday through his lawyer, Larisa Dementyeva. 
  Dementyeva also announced that, according to Article Five of 
the criminal procedural code of the Russian Federation, "The 
application of an amnesty should not depend on whether or not 
the accused has confessed to the charges filed against him". 
  The lawyers of other participants in the October 3-4 events 
refused, when asked by ITAR-TASS, to make any statements until 
they receive the official text of the anmesty from the State 
Duma. Procurator-General of Russia Aleksey Kazannik has promised 
to distribute the text to the concerned defenders as soon as it 
is forwarded to his office.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "Federal Assembly Restrained </F>
in Its Response to Message. Tension Increases Between Branches 
of Authority"] 
  [Text] Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin was on the 
platform for exactly 50 minutes, addressing the deputies of both 
chambers of the Federal Assembly. His report "On Strengthening 
the Russian State" was listened to in silence and the response 
to it was one of restraint. 
  The various political forces represented in parliament had 
no 
illusions about the power of the president's message to bring 
about creative work and accord. They were still feeling the 
impact of the previous day's decision by the State Duma on an 
amnesty for those responsible for the August putsch and the 
October revolt. 
  This was the sole topic of conversation in the Kremlin 
before 
the session of the two chambers opened. Here are some 
pronouncements on the topic. 
  G. Zyuganov, leader of the communists' faction: 
  "If the president's team and the government fail to see that 
the State Duma's amnesty decision points the way to national 
accord and reconciliation, too bad for them. We are on the 
brink of mass strikes. The economic crisis is assuming 
catastrophic proportions. Therefore the task now is to take 
steps toward reconciliation. The amnesty should be followed by 
a treaty with Belarus. We must make an approach to Ukraine and 
restore all links with Kazakhstan." 
  Describing the president's message, G. Zyuganov said: "The 
president has now promulgated 15 programs, but none of them has 
been implemented. I do not expect any constructive actions from 
the president and government. Our approach is an immediate 
change of economic course and the formation of a government of 
national confidence on condition that Chubays and Kozyrev leave 
it. If confrontation on the part of the executive authority 
continues, those who signed the agreement in the Belovezhskaya 
Forest will be quitting the political arena this very year." 
  Presidential Press Secretary V. Kostikov also returned to 
the 
Duma's amnesty decision. 
  "No doubt there is now going to be a war of legal 
interpretations of the State Duma decision," he said, "since, 
under the Constitution, it can declare an amnesty but it cannot 
adopt a decision on it. No one will be leaving Lefortovo or 
Matrosskaya Tishina in the next few weeks or months. Moreover, 
this decision is immoral, since those in detention were directly 
involved in the bloodshed. It is clear that there is a bloc of 
communists and neofascists in the Duma with practically no 
difference between them." 
  Journalists were particularly interested in the view of 
Russian Federation General Prosecutor A. Kazannik. He said that 
the organs of the prosecutor's office are not concerned with 
politics, and that "We are in the business of ensuring 
compliance with the law, and we are obliged to apply the 
decision of the competent state organs. When it is published we 
will study it and will familiarize each of the accused with the 
report. If they accept the State Duma's amnesty decision, I 
will rule that the criminal case against this or that individual 
be dropped." 
  But despite this dramatic news, which the Duma served up 
precisely on the eve of the president's policy statement, there 
were nonetheless optimistic tones regarding the president's 
message: 
  Interviewed by your IZVESTIYA correspondent, the well-known 
economist P. Bunich said: 
  "The president faced a difficult task: He had to talk about 
everything in a 50-minute speech, missing out none of the 
problems that society regards as explosive. His tact is to be 
welcomed -- he did not react to the State Duma's decision. It 
is not the place to talk about it. As for the very important, 
economic section of the message, the president's confirmation of 
the continuation of the course of reforms begun in 1992 can be 
regarded as the key feature. The second thing of importance 
mentioned by the president is that he does not take his lead 
from those who advocate strong state authority, from the report 
of the `Soviet academics.' Proposals by the president on, for 
example, freezing prices, pay, the rouble rate, and so on might 
have signaled his support for the course propagandized by them." 
  Former finance minister B. Fedorov told your IZVESTIYA 
correspondent: 
  "Certainly, one must welcome the president's statement of 
the 
danger that the current Cabinet of Ministers might boost 
inflation. Nonetheless, everything will depend on the practical 
implementation of the measures indicated by the president."

<F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar by Jon </F>
Snow; Gaydar in Moscow, Snow in London; from the "Channel 4 
News" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Snow] Well, I've been talking to Yegor Gaydar, who 
until January was Mr. Yeltsin's deputy prime minister. He was 
the force behind many of Mr. Yeltsin's early economic reforms 
and is still a leading member of the Russian parliament. I 
started by asking him what signal he felt the amnesty was giving. 
  [Gaydar] It's a very, very bad signal for the Russian public 
opinion. When people who had committed this type of activities 
were being free again for the activity, it is a very serious 
signs that the state is weak, that the criminals could proceed 
with this type of subversive activities. It is of course very 
bad signal for their supporters. I am almost sure that they 
will try to organize once again their provocation in Moscow 
during the spring, or the autumn of the year 94. 
  [Snow] Where do you think that will lead? 
  [Gaydar] I think that it will lead to the intensification of 
the social and political conflict, and I could not exclude the 
possibilities of a very drastic confrontation like we have seen, 
for instance, in October of the year 93, or in August of the 
year 91 in Moscow. 
  [Snow] Therefore do you think that Mr. Yeltsin is responding 
correctly to what is happening? 
  [Gaydar] Well, Mr. Yeltsin's possibilities under 
Constitution 
are limited. Parliament generally is in its own rights. This 
decision does not need the confirmation of the president, or 
upper chamber. But of course this solution is very, very 
serious threat to the stability of the country and I think that 
the president will take it in mind. 
  [Snow] But then that means that the man that you were 
serving 
right up until five weeks ago is himself now in a very, very 
weak position. He has a parliament that is against him, that is 
allowing still more of his enemies out into free circulation, 
and the outlook for his own survival must not be good. 
  [Gaydar] Well, of course, the position of the president are 
much stronger than they were for instance in September of the 
year 93. Now he has constitutional rights that clarifies very 
definitely his possibilities with dealings with internal 
policies. Except the amnesty, the rights of Duma to act without 
the agreement of the president are rather limited. Of course we 
are in a very difficult political situation, but if you compare 
for instance with the situation of September of the year 93, I 
would not agree with the fact that it's more difficult. 
  [Snow] If that internal battle does express itself in civil 
war, how will the forces be arrayed? How do you see this awful 
conflict mapping out? 
  [Gaydar] Well, to tell you truth, during my two-year 
political career, I never answered a question with an if 
included in it. 
  [Snow] Nevertheless you've had to put your neck out a little 
today, by saying that you are so concerned about what happened 
yesterday that you do foresee serious conflict? 
  [Gaydar] Well, I mean that the risk that internal political 
struggle in Russia will not be held in the limits of the 
existing democratic Constitution, from my point of view, 
seriously increased after the yesterday solution of the 
parliament. 
  [Snow] And that leaves Mr. Yeltsin, and people like yourself 
who believe in reform on one side, and perhaps, Zhirinovskiy and 
those people who have been in jail teaming up together? 
  [Gaydar] I couldn't exclude it absolutely. You have seen 
yesterday, the big parliamentary coalition which supported this 
solution. This coalition included the forces from Zhirinovskiy 
to the communists to the factions that previously were regarded 
as the centrists, and of course I could not exclude the 
possibilities that this will be the real line of the division in 
the political battles in Russia during the year 94-95. 
  [Snow] What should the West's reaction be? Simply go on 
putting more money in where necessary, or should we be taking 
some other stance? 
  [Gaydar] Well, first of all, let us understand very clearly 
that it is the Russian internal affairs. And the possibilities 
of the West to influence the events are rather limited. It is 
first of all our internal battle and we will have to fight it 
first of all ourselves.

  [Text] St. Petersburg's Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak has called 
"totally unacceptable and unlawful" the Duma's decision on 
political amnesty. He told an Interfax interviewer in Moscow on 
Thursday that "it is possible to pardon those who have pleaded 
guilty to a crime only after the court's verdict." 
  Politically, Sobchak believes, "this is a challenge and the 
desire to make the president, government, and all democrats 
accept what was done as an accomplished fact." "It's not merely 
a political challenge but a desire to prepare a new show down of 
strength," he remarked. 
  "The farce that has been continuing at the trial of the 
State 
of Emergency Committee Members and the attempt to let those who 
have the blood of many people on their hands and who openly 
called for an armed rebellion, get away with it, all this is 
sad." 
  In Sobchak's words, the Duma "has so far been demonstrating 
total impotence on the issues it ought to address according to 
the Constitution." Although the country faces lots of problems, 
although the taxation legislation, penal code, and other laws 
need to be amended, deputies in the lower house of parliament 
have never tried to debate a single bill. 
  "How much has been said and written about corruption, while 
such a crime is unknown in Russia's penal code -- Sobchak said. 
And since corruption is taken for granted, there is no one to 
persecute for it. That's what the Duma should deal with." 
  In Sobchak's words, he has not been surprised by the 
position 
of the Liberal Democrats and Communists during the political 
amnesty debates in parliament. "But the stand of many others, 
Sergey Shakhray (the leader of the faction from the Russian 
Unity and Concord Party) included, is staggering, he declared. 
People calling themselves democrats stab democracy in the back."

  [Text] A resolution on political and economic amnesty 
adopted by the State Duma does not require any additional 
document on the procedure of its implementation, chairman of the 
State Duma's legislative committee Vladimir Isakov told Interfax 
on Thursday. 
  He reminded that, according to the resolution, all cases 
related to the August 19-21, 1991, May 1, September 21-October 
4, 1993, in Moscow "should be immediately stopped." 
  In the opinion of Isakov, "the State Duma should issue a 
separate resolution or explain the mechanism of the 
implementation of the amnesty resolution in one of its 
provisions." In this connection, he believes that all persons 
involved in the the State of Emergency Committee, the May and 
October events of 1993, "should be released, as it is indicated 
in the State Duma resolution, immediately after its official 
publication." 
  In the meantime, the deputy chairman of the State Duma 
committee on security Vikor Mirnov claims that the State Duma 
resolution on political and economic amnesty "does not have any 
judicial consequences." 
  In his opinion, the amnesty resolution was adopted in 
violation of the procedural rules, because it was not put on 
vote twice, first for the basics and then for the whole 
document, as required. 
  Mironov thinks that the amnesty resolution will not be 
carried out, "the Communists and Zhirinovskiy supporters will 
not achieve their goals, and Rutskoy, Khasbulatov and other 
people involved in the October events will not be released." 
  The deputy pointed out that he had voted against that 
document because he did not want "a civil war to be unleashed." 
In his opinion, "there are people interested in the release of 
Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, Anpilov, Terekhov, so that after the 
release they like dogs gnaw through a road for them to power."

  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS--Another hearing on the case 
of those involved in the abortive coup, fixed for February 25, 
has been put off till March 1. This decision is not connected 
with the State Duma's resolution on amnesty for participants in 
the August 1991 events, adopted on Wednesday, CRIME PRESS 
learned from the military collegium of the Russian Supreme 
Court. The hearing was put off because of the continued illness 
of the wife of defendant Vasiliy Starodubtsev. She is in an

  [Text] The President's message to parliament is an 
absolutely new form of political life in Russia, Moscow's Mayor 
Yuriy Luzhkov told Interfax. 
  I believe, said Luzhkov, there are two important problems in 
the message: the combating of crime and the stabilization of 
the economy. These two problems must be solved as early as 
possible and to do so available forces should be used 
efficiently. 
  The Mayor said he was completely unsatisfied by the words 
said by the president about privatization. 
  The problem should have had more emphasis in the message. 
The state has received nothing from the voucher privatization 
campaign: neither money nor a new owner. The completion of the 
campaign means a failure for the Russian economy, said Luzhkov. 
  The Moscow Mayor believes that the president did right when 
in his message he spoke about the protection of the 
Russian-speakers in the CIS countries. 
  I have just returned from Sevastopol and I am alarmed by the 
fact that the forceful "Ukrainization" of the Russians is taking 
place there. There are 75 percent of Russians living in the 
city. I intend to report to the president about this, he said. 
  The Moscow Mayor said that if in such historically Russian 
cities as Sevastopol and Narva, Russian residents are being 
forced to take on an alien life style, culture, language and 
their rights are infringed upon, the problem could develop from 
a diplomatic one to one with grave social and political 
consequences.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Conspiracies" rubric: </F>
"`Neo-Centrists' Promise Repetition of October-64, but Aleksandr 
Rutskoy Will Not Be Their Direct Leader"] 
  [Text] Should the president fail to see to it that 
Aleksandr Rutskoy is immediately released from jail right on the 
heels of the Duma amnesty decree, the latter "will be assured of 
a martyr image which would lead to corresponding consequences," 
one of the organizers of the "neo-centrist" bloc "People's 
Alliance" told SEGODNYA. Although the "Alliance" has already 
been dubbed "Rutskoy's presidential party," the activist, who 
asked not to be identified by name "because of a gentlemen's 
agreement with comrades," said that Aleksandr Rutskoy is seen as 
leader "only prospectively," but generally "he is not going to 
matter." 
  Over several months of efforts to create the "Alliance" the 
organizers did manage to keep their part of the bargain in the 
"gentlemen's agreement" and to ensure a certain secrecy of the 
project. Only one of the technical organizers -- former Supreme 
Soviet member Andrey Golovin -- spilled the beans, saying that 
its "founders" were virtually all the participants in what have 
of late become traditional "centrist `roundtables'" in the 
Gorbachev Fund -- among them Valeriy Zorkin, ex-chairman of the 
Constitutional Court; Aleksandr Tsipko, a Gorbachev Fund expert; 
and ex-deputy Oleg Rumyantsev, "who worked in the White House 
till the end." Organizers decline to name their other 
comrades-in-arms, pleading that "too important names" are 
involved. 
  Andrey Golovin said that the "charter fund" of the new 
organization alone "is a matter of tens of millions of dollars." 
Valeriy Khomyakov, who resigned as Democratic Party of Russia 
executive committee chairman, voiced a guess that "Tsipko of the 
Gorbachev Fund is not present there for nothing." 
  The abovementioned activist agreed to give a "general 
outline" of the organization's immediate plans: "We already 
have in place the structure and theoretical tenets, and we are 
going over to practical actions. I promise that everybody will 
hear about the `Alliance' in three to four weeks from now." 
"The decisive moment," according to him, has been slated for 
late March and early April. He vouched, however, that "there 
would no longer be blood, and whatever happens will follow the 
October 1964 scenario." Recall that there was a peaceful party 
coup during the 1964 party plenum in October when Nikita 
Khrushchev was ousted as a result of an internal conspiracy by 
his closest comrades in arms.

<F P=106> ["NG" report under the "In Brief" rubric: "President's </F>
Press Service Obstructs Performance of NG Correspondents' 
Professional Duties"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin's address in the Kremlin yesterday 
said among other things that the authority "should not fence 
itself off from the mass media." One wishes that the president 
would utter these words before the chiefs of his own press 
service. The work of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA [NG] correspondents 
has been constantly impeded throughout the recent year at all 
events participated in by the president. In plain terms, they 
are simply denied accreditation at these events; this was also 
the case when the president addressed parliament. The 
boilerplate explanation is -- no room. In the meantime, room is 
always there for the press service's pet editions. 
  While Kostikov's and Krasikov's business is to choose their 
own pets, NG is not pushing to be among them. But that this 
policy is discriminatory toward NG is obvious to us. Many of 
our journalists had been told without mincing words -- quit 
NEZAVISIMAYA, and you'll get your accreditation. Kostikov, as 
everybody could hear during the president's recent press 
conference in the Kremlin, was not too fastidious in advising 
the NG correspondent loud and clear and in public to leave the 
newspaper. One would have thought he had specially prepared this 
ad lib in advance for the presidential press conference, putting 
aside all other affairs. 
  For us, these are usual difficulties we could and would be 
able to overcome. In particular, NG was the only Russian 
newspaper to have given in its 22 February issue a precise 
account of the main points of the presidential message. The 
behavior of the president's press service has not only 
transcended the bounds of human decency, but also seriously 
violates the professional rights of NG journalists granted us, 
not by Kostikov and Krasikov, but by the law for which NG was 
fighting when neither were at the president's side. We are 
going to uphold these rights. For the time being, by making 
public the facts we know. Further on, perhaps, also in the 
Arbitration Information Court instituted by the Russian 
Federation president. 
  But it hardly pays once again to play, via publications 
close 
to the court, the NG-small-circulation card. Or else we are 
going to make public the real circulations of all favorite 
dailies and weeklies of the press service.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Hold the Front Page!" </F>
rubric: "Federation Council Does Not Act Telegenically"] 
  [Text] The head of the Federation Council staff has 
directed that the operation of the International Association of 
Radio and Television [IART], based in the former House of the 
Russian Press, be discontinued. 
  Association employees who reported to work yesterday were 
not 
admitted into the building by security. They had their passes 
seized and were advised to take it easy until 1 March (when the 
Federation Council winds up its work), explaining that entry was 
denied them for their own safety. The employees were even 
barred from making sure their studio, with equipment worth more 
than 150 million rubles, was quite safe. The Federation Council 
apparatus does not seem to worry about how dozens of Association 
members up and down the CIS are going to get programming and how 
much IART losses will be -- chiefs of the Association cannot get 
any answer out of it.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 25 Feb--The Russian Foreign Ministry today 
issued a press statement in connection with the arrest of the 
Ameses in Washington. It says: 
  "Sufficiently close contacts exist between Russia and the 
United States to raise any questions. As has been announced, 
the investigation into the Ames case was going on for 10 months. 
We suggest that this was sufficient time for us to be contacted 
directly and for them to share their anxieties with us before 
making them public. 
  "We are opposed to the attempts by the special services to 
drag the political leadership into their mutual relations. The 
appropriate channels are there. And they can be fully brought 
into use. 
  "The political consequences of this story give cause for 
concern. Our partnership has withstood a series of serious 
tests, the latest one arising from the crisis around Sarajevo. 
We shall cope with this misunderstanding, too. However there 
are circles in the United States, just as there are, 
incidentally, in Russia, who are not interested in friendship 
between the two major powers. They became noticeably active 
after the successful summit in Moscow, at which a solution was 
made to bring relations between Russia and the United States to 
the stage of mature strategic partnership. We reaffirm yet 
again that within the framework of this course it is possible to 
find an appropriate solution to this situation, too."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report in the "Espionage" column: "A </F>
Russian Agent Has Been Arrested In Washington. Never Pay Cash 
in America"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The FBI has investigated the 
Ames case for two years. He was finally tracked down last 
October when Ames took time off to visit his mother-in-law in 
Bogota. It transpired, however, that Ames' mother-in-law lives 
in the United States, while instead of Bogota her son-in-law 
went to Caracas to meet a contact. It was also known that in 
buying a house in Arlington, Virginia, Ames paid cash. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] refused to comment on 
the incident. In his time, responding to a question from 
General Volkogonov, who sought to justify the famous spy Alger 
Hiss, FIS director Yevgeniy Primakov said: "The Foreign 
Intelligence Service gives no information about who is or is not 
a spy." This time it has done exactly the same. According to 
an FIS press service official, all special services of the world 
act like this in such circumstances. Meanwhile, FIS press 
service chief Yuriy Kobaladze in an interview with INTERFAX made 
a statement which can be seen as indirect confirmation. 
Intelligence, he said, even in a changing world, remains 
intelligence, with its own specific means and interests. 
Grigoriy Karasin, Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry Information 
and Press Department director, said in a telephone conversation 
that concerning the report on the Ames case provided by the 
State Department, Moscow has some questions that should be 
clarified through direct contacts between the special services. 
"We believe," Karasin said, "that special services can 
straighten things out especially since their cooperation has 
been developing successfully." 
  U.S. and Russian special services are, indeed, cooperating. 
One such sphere of cooperation is fighting drug trafficking. 
Lately Ames' responsibility in the CIA has been precisely in 
this area. Apparently the contact whom Ames met in Caracas used 
the same "cover."

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] The detention of the CIA member Aldrich Ames and his 
wife Maria on charges of spying in favor of Moscow is 
Washington's internal affair, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, 
Sergey Lavrov, told Interfax on Thursday [24 February]. This is 
his personal assessment of what happened, he noted. 
  "This is a problem for the Americans. They detained their 
own citizen, a CIA member, and they must deal with him in 
accordance with their own laws. Instead of it high-ranking U.S. 
officials have said, before trial, that this incident may have 
an impact on Russian-American relations. We do not quite 
understand it," Lavrov said. 
  The U.S. secretary of state, Warren Christopher, has already 
told Senate that he has no intention of commenting on events 
that concern America's intelligence work, he noted. "He can 
comment on other country's intelligence work, but not on that of 
America. Following this logic I must refrain from commenting on 
our activity, the more so as I do not see our activity in this 
case. What I see is that they arrested their own man. But this 
is their own problem. Let their court of law consider the 
charges against Ames," Lavrov said. 
  He finds it hard to say why this incident "surfaced" right 
now. "Judging by what U.S. officials say, they have been dealing 
with this business for a long time. It's not quite clear why 
they decided to sort it out right now. This was a step taken by 
the American side, and we learned about it after the fact," the 
diplomat said. 
  Lavrov was skeptical about the supposition that "the Ameses 
case" is a kind of "retaliation" for Russia's political efforts 
to resolve the crisis in Bosnia. "It's hard to imagine that the 
Americans decided to "avenge themselves" on Russia in this way. 
This would have been too petty," Lavrov said. 
  With reference to his Tuesday's meeting with the U.S. 
ambassador to Moscow, Thomas Pickering, the diplomat said that 
the ambassador had only handed him written information 
concerning Washington's reaction to the Ameses incident. "We 
accepted it and promised to study it in detail," Russia's deputy 
foreign minister said. 
  It's essential to avoid "emotions and overdramatization" in 
connection with the Ameses case, said the Director of the 
Foreign Ministry's press and information department, Grigoriy 
Karasin, at Thursday's briefing. 
  The Foreign Ministry received information concerning this 
through "official channels", he said. "However there are many 
serious questions that need to be analysed before making any 
conclusions," Karasin noted. 
  According to him, this should be dealt with by professionals 
from Russian and American secret services. "Contacts between 
them are well established. The main thing is to settle the 
incident without political or diplomatic complications and avoid 
kindling passions," the spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with former First Deputy Premier Yegor Gaydar by </F>
Vladimir Kuzmishchev; place and date not given: "Yegor Gaydar: 
All Sober-Minded People Must Unite in the Face of Danger"] 
  [Text] [Kuzmishchev] Yegor Timurovich, information in the 
mass media on your party building is rather contradictory. I 
understand, for example, that you have not found a common 
language with the leaders of "Democratic Russia...." 
  [Gaydar] Of course, it is a complex process to find a common 
language among democrats, who do constitute, let us say, a 
specific milieu; but the organizational mechanism which we have 
proposed has, on the whole, been supported and will be realized. 
The "Russia's Choice" faction has come up with an appeal on the 
need to create a political party which will be able to become 
the democratic movement's reliable mainstay in the complex 
political clashes which await us over the next two years and on 
which a way out of the present indeterminate, intermediate 
situation will depend. There are two of them -- either 
restoration, or the continuation of the reforms. 
  This appeal was discussed at two major forums held Saturday 
in the council of the "Russia's Choice" movement and in the 
council of "Democratic Russia." The "Russia's Choice" Council 
supported the faction's initiative and proposed that its 
regional organizations assist in creating the party. 
"Democratic Russia" discussed our proposal in detail, and 
various viewpoints were expressed, but in the end they 
nonetheless agreed to give "Democratic Russia's" regional 
organizations the opportunity to decide on the spot, proceeding 
from their own conditions. This accords with our programs and 
principles, since in creating the new party we will not rely on 
the bases of existing structures but will build the party on the 
basis of people's individual choice. 
  [Kuzmishchev] In other words, will those political figures 
who have become familiar and even odious and who, nevertheless, 
automatically end up seated at the presidium table in democratic 
meetings not necessarily occupy leading places in this party? 
  [Gaydar] Quite right. You can always gather together 10 or 
100 chance people who would go and vote for you today and 
convince them that you are a great democratic figure, even if 
you do not have an ounce of authority left. If you have created 
an understandable and structured organization with a fixed 
membership, then that organization already has the opportunity 
to decide for itself what leaders it needs. 
  [Kuzmishchev] At the word "party" people recall "democratic 
centralism," above all. Moreover, historians know that 
dictatorship came into being not in 1918 but in 1903, when the 
Leninist principle of party building was adopted. Will you have 
anything like that? 
  [Gaydar] We are, of course, trying to build a party not of a 
totalitarian but a parliamentary type, i.e. a party geared not 
to full and comprehensive control of society but to efficient 
political campaigning and measures, striving to implement a 
policy which we consider feasible within the framework of the 
Constitution and existing legislation. 
  [Kuzmishchev] How, then, will the party differ from 
"Russia's Choice"? Even now the faction votes uniformly. 
  [Gaydar] We propose quite clear and definite discipline in 
implementing jointly adopted decisions. As in Western 
parliamentary parties. It is possible to debate endlessly and 
champion your own viewpoint and yet implement jointly adopted 
decisions in practical work. This is not some amorphous 
formation like what exists now, when the position can change any 
day depending on who has made himself today's leader. It is a 
broad association of people who share common views and fears, 
who work together, and who shape and implement decisions 
together. There has never been anything like this in the 
democratic movement. 
  [Kuzmishchev] How will your organizational principle 
differ from, let us say, that of Travkin's party? 
  [Gaydar] In principle not at all. Any party is a mechanism 
for realizing political power. Precisely because we are 
countering today not only Travkin's party but the perfectly 
capable and regrown Communist Party with its strong structure in 
the provinces, with a large aktiv and with established 
traditions of party work and propaganda and our national 
socialists' quite rigid organization which, although still weak, 
is rapidly taking shape, we must counter them not with a friable 
and uncoordinated association of democrats but with a quite 
efficient organization. It is like a rifle, you know: It is 
identically made, but shoots at different targets. 
  [Kuzmishchev] An argument is taking place in the Democratic 
Party, as in the past between Martov and Lenin: Must a party 
member work within an organization, or is it sufficient to share 
ideas? 
  [Gaydar] This question will ultimately be decided by the 
party's constituent congress. But we believe, nonetheless, that 
we are building a party of the parliamentary type, and so such 
rigid demands are hardly applicable. 
  [Kuzmishchev] Why do people call you the presidential party? 
You know, this does not always produce political capital. 
  [Gaydar] It is a case of inaccurate interpretation. Very 
many people hastened to imagine a party of chiefs headed by the 
president. As far as I understand it, the president simply has 
no intention of creating such a party. It was a question of 
creating capable, organized structures which can implement a 
policy of reforms. 
  [Kuzmishchev] What if the party achieves success and becomes 
the ruling party? 
  [Gaydar] It will not supplant the state. 
  In the traditional Soviet society it was a question not just 
of the election-winning Communist Party's placing its own 
representatives in various posts, as is done in any normal 
democratic state, but of the party's essentially turning the 
state into a scarecrow, into some ritual mechanism existing in 
order to implement the decisions adopted by the party. The 
party not only appointed the minister but also decided who must 
be his deputy, head of department, etc. This was a party of the 
totalitarian type. We, of course, have no need of such a party. 
  [Kuzmishchev] A party means a structure, money, and 
ideology. In my view, things are difficult for you with the 
latter. You say: We will create an economy which, in the final 
analysis, will itself resolve all problems. People remember 
that they were once promised: Communism will be achieved, and 
then everything will be good.... 
  [Gaydar] In actual fact, the essence of what we propose 
consists in limiting the state burden and the burden of 
officialdom in every possible way for society. Our opponents 
say: If there is a problem, the state must solve it. This 
means in practice that they will put 1,000 more officials in 
place and give them the opportunity to share several trillion 
rubles. You will pay taxes, and the officials will extort them 
and decide to whom to give money and to whom not to give it. 
This is what our opponents propose. Our position is the direct 
opposite. We do not promise manna from heaven; we promise 
something else -- a society in which the official will not have 
the right to decide which enterprise will prosper and which will 
not, depending on who has given him a bribe; a society in which 
the official will merely keep an eye on compliance with the laws. 
  [Kuzmishchev] But more specific proposals are also needed. 
In my view, unless you elaborate program decisions on the 
protection of the Russian population in the neighboring 
countries, you will find it hard to compete with Zhirinovskiy, 
let us say, who has made the national question his trump card. 
  [Gaydar] In 1992, when we did not in actual fact have our 
own monetary unit and there was no separation of our economic 
area, everybody despised us. Why should I supply anything to 
Russia, why should I seek entry to the Russian market if I can 
print money? We were forced to run and plead: Please send meat 
to us in Moscow. Ukraine said: Why should we feed you? That 
was what happened, and that is what we are being pushed toward 
today. 
  In 1991 Crimea together with all of Ukraine had voted to 
pull 
out precisely because there was chaos in Russia, precisely 
because we were not separated by anything and had no tool of 
influence. Crimea votes differently today precisely because we 
have been separated. Either we have an efficient Russian 
economy with its own money, when people reckon with us and stand 
in line wishing to cooperate with us, and then we have the 
opportunity to uphold the rights of Russians in the neighboring 
countries by economic methods; or we mess up this whole 
business, and then we ask in bewilderment why Russians are being 
offended. 
  [Kuzmishchev] What did those Russians who graduated from 
Saratov Polytechnical Institute and were sent to Dnepropetrovsk 
or Karaganda do wrong? Why has big politics turned them into 
second-class people? How can Russia help them? 
  [Gaydar] Of course they did nothing wrong. The question is: 
What is to be done? The most important thing that we can do is 
to have a competent Russian economy, because then we will be 
able to secure dual citizenship for them, we can welcome them 
home, if that is what they want, and we can hold talks and 
conclude an agreement on a common economic zone and create a 
customs union and, in time, a currency union. We can make 
Russia the center of the common economic area which is being 
formed. 
  [Kuzmishchev] Your opponents also favor a single emission 
center.... 
  [Gaydar] Well, that is not a bad political move on their 
part: to appropriate the idea for which they criticized us, for 
which we struggled, and which we implemented.... 
  [Kuzmishchev] Yegor Timurovich, what would you say to people 
far removed from politics if, as they say in advertising, you 
had 30 seconds? 
  [Gaydar] Today we must be conscious of the rigid need to 
unite all sober-minded people precisely because a sense of a 
real historical danger has come about once again. All people 
feel and understand this. They also see the gleam in the eyes 
of the Communists, who have forgotten nothing and renounced 
nothing. They also see the triumphal self-confidence of the 
national socialists. In general this is dreadful for normal 
people, who simply think about themselves and their children. 
There are two reactions here: either panic or, nonetheless, a 
courageous decision to counter this real and very serious threat. 
  We are struggling for our country's future. We do not want 
to see it a totalitarian state with camps, with no signs of 
human freedom, with lines, with shortages, with humiliations 
before chiefs. In fact we see our country free, with everyone 
having the right to his own opinion, to choose, to vote, and to 
decide the country's future and the opportunity to work and earn.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has 
commented skeptically on the idea that the Ames affair might be 
a response to the political activity displayed by Russia in 
resolving the Bosnian crisis. Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Grigoriy Karasin said today that it was important to avoid 
emotional and overdramatized attitudes and that it was necessary 
to analyze the situation before drawing any conclusions. 
  At the same time experts continue commenting on the 
situation 
from very different angles. Here is a report by Andrey 
Pishchayev. 
  [Pishchayev] Recently, a similar incident occurred between 
the United States and Israel but the scandal promptly died down. 
On this occasion, however, the American side is talking about a 
great detriment to its national interests and has nearly started 
wondering whether it ought to continue its friendship with 
Russia. [passage omitted] 
  Many questions arise in connection with this scandal. CIA 
staff had been closely watching the Moscow agent for two years, 
so why did they choose to arrest him at this particular point? 
President Clinton knew about the forthcoming arrest when he was 
leaving for the Moscow summit with Boris Yeltsin. 
  [Begin V. Kremenyuk, deputy director of the Institute for 
U.S. and Canadian studies, recording] The fact that this 
incident emerged just now confirms that Clinton was not quite 
satisfied with the results of that summit, and that he was 
particularly displeased with the outcome of the recent crisis in 
Bosnia. [end recording] 
  According to Kremenyuk, the reasoning behind President 
Clinton's sanction of the spy's arrest went like this: 
  [Begin Kremenyuk recording] Let us make it clear that they 
[Russians] are no peacemakers but merely the same dirty spies 
that they always used to be. Let us create a small crisis that 
would enable us to put some pressure on Yeltsin. [end recording] 
  In the opinion of Russian diplomats, it would be too petty a 
revenge on Russia. Anyway, we can only guess why the Ames 
affair has emerged so unexpectedly.

  [Text] The U.S. Department of Justice has announced that a 
Central Intelligence Agency officer, Aldrich Hazen Ames, and his 
wife Maria, have been accused of spying for the former Soviet 
Union and later Russia. 
  It's an established rule worldwide that secret services 
don't 
comment on such events. It would be logical to turn to the 
United States Government for clarification about Russia's 
involvement in the case. Yet the interest of the press and the 
public at large in such incidents is natural. 
  Radio Moscow's reporter has asked Oleg Kalugin, former 
general of the KGB, the State Security Committee of the former 
Soviet Union, how he sees this incident. Oleg Kalugin is a 
well-known personality in this country. He was an active member 
of the former Supreme Soviet. Oleg Kalugin says that when it 
comes to intelligence affairs, the general public may only guess. 
  [Begin Kalugin recording, in Russian with superimposed 
English translation] My opinion is based on TV and radio 
reports, including CNN, whose programs I often watch at home. 
Undoubtedly Mr. Ames is a man in the know, and I see his arrest 
both as a failure and a success of the United States 
counterintelligence, which has been able to unmask an 
experienced spy who held an important position in the American 
CIA. 
  But when I hear a demand by U.S. officials that Russian 
diplomats should be recalled, I think this is an overreaction. 
Russian intelligence officers have been arrested for spying for 
foreign countries more than once. In such a situation the 
Russian foreign ministry has never urged the Americans to recall 
their diplomats, unless they were caught redhanded. 
  I do believe the case has done big moral damage to the 
United 
States. However, I would prefer not to overdramatize the 
situation, and I don't think that Russian-American relations 
will worsen as a result of the incident. I think this episode 
is a legacy of the Cold War. That legacy is still with us and 
will be for some time. [end reocrding]

  [Text] Moscow February 24 -- According to reliable sources, 
high-ranking officials of the Central Intelligence Agency are 
due to arrive in Moscow from the United States soon to discuss 
the case of the Ames, a married couple charged with espionage in 
favour of the former Soviet Union and, later, Russia. 
  The U.S. President's spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said on 
Wednesday [23 February] that the former leader of the CIA 
counterintelligence department targeting the Soviet Union, 
Aldrich H. Ames and his wife evoked suspicions some ten months 
ago and were closely watched by the Central Intelligence Agency 
and the Federal Bureau of Investigations until the American 
Administration took the case to court charging the two with 
espionage. 
  The exact date of the arrival of the American delegation is 
not yet known. It is likely that the CIA officials will wait 
for Russian external intelligence service chief Yevgeniy 
Primakov to return home from Prague. 
It is not ruled out that in view of the ballyhoo in the United 
States around the Ames affair, his former colleagues may ask for 
a prompt assignment with the leaders of the Russian intelligence 
service. 
  The press service of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow declined to 
comment at ITAR-TASS request on the forthcoming visit of CIA 
officials to Moscow.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>
  [Text] Washington February 25 TASS -- American and Russian 
officials these days are holding consultations via different 
channels concerning the arrest of CIA officer Aldrich Ames and 
his wife on charges of spying for Moscow. ITAR-TASS has learned 
from reliable sources that U.S. State Department officials are 
due to meet with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov 
in Washington to discuss various diplomatic aspects of 
American-Russian relations as scheduled before the arrest of the 
Ames on Monday. The arrest will certainly add a new aspect to 
consultations. 
  U.S. Attorney-General Janet Reno said on Thursday it had 
raised the question about the espionage case at a meeting with 
representatives of the Russian law enforcement agencies on the 
same day. 
  The local press confirmed on Thursday a report circulated by 
ITAR-TASS earlier about the U.S. Administration's decision to 
send CIA officials to Moscow for consultations on the Ames 
affair. Judging by reports in the American mass media, the 
delegation will also include FBI and State Department officials. 
  On the whole the passions are flaring around the espionage 
speculations. At first, American journalists said two Soviet 
citizens who were spying for the United States were exposed and 
executed at the end of the 1980's on a tip from Ames, now they 
say that the number of such people is at least ten. A CIA 
official, who spoke to ITAR-TASS on condition of anonymity on 
Wednesday, said he could neither confirm nor deny the fact of 
the death of two American spies. On Thursday, CIA spokesman 
David French refused to reply to any questions from ITAR-TASS. 
He explained his refusal by saying that the Central 
Intelligence Agency was maintaining contacts only with the 
American press. 
  Another interesting news reached ITAR-TASS from the Justice 
Ministry's official John Russell on Thursday. According to him, 
the judge has decided to postpone hearings in the case of the 
Ames couple from Friday to next Tuesday. French told ITAR-TASS 
he did not know the exact reason for the postponement but 
surmised that the hearings were adjourned on request of the 
defence attorney.

<F P=106> [International Affairs Department, Operational Information </F>
Department report: "Two Russian Spies Caught. Clinton Delayed 
a `Present' Until the Day of the Defenders of the Fatherland"] 
  [Excerpts] According to information received from the 
United States yesterday, after two years of surveillance the FBI 
has arrested Aldrich Ames, a CIS department chief with a 30-year 
service record, and his Colombian-born wife, Maria del Rosario 
Casas. The agents, charged with spying for the USSR and later 
Russia, face life imprisonment. The emergence of yet another 
"Rosenberg case" -- they were executed in the early 1950's for 
selling nuclear secrets to the USSR -- might well not have 
transcended the limits of the talk about the hard life of 
"cloak-and-dagger knights" were it not for a juicy detail. 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned from confidential sources that 
Aldrich Ames was detained 10 months ago, not this Monday. At 
any rate, for some reason it was decided to "expose" the agents 
precisely at this juncture. 
<H5>  The Ames' May Have Been Given Up by an FIS "Mole" </H5>
  Boris Labusov, official at the Russian Foreign Intelligence 
Service [FIS]'s press bureau, said in response to your 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent's request that he comment on the 
report: "Under the Russian Law on Foreign Intelligence, this 
incident will not be commented upon." A trustworthy source 
close to the FIS spoke to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent 
about the actual mood that has reigned among FIS chiefs after 
the exposure of the Ames'. The atmosphere of shock and 
despondency at the loss of a very valuable agent has been 
compounded by a suspicion, which has already evolved into a firm 
conviction, that Aldrich Ames was given up to the Americans by 
an as yet unidentified high-ranking official of the FIS itself. 
"This is a `mole' we have been dug up from within," the 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY source claims. "Moreover, judging from the Ames 
case, the level of information he has had access to limits the 
number of potential traitors to a very narrow range of persons. 
It is at the level of Primakov's deputies." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Qui Prodest? </H5>
  The "spy passions" in relations between Moscow and 
Washington 
have been a common phenomenon, but it is unclear why it was 
decided, after two years of surveillance, to "expose" the agents 
precisely at this stage and with such a brouhaha. As a matter 
of fact, according to reports from FIS sources, the Russian 
special services' "catch" of Western spies in 1993 was worthy of 
being registered in the Guinness Book of World Records: It 
exceeded even the record high of 30 or so spies achieved under 
Vladimir Kryuchkov. And no clamor whatsoever! According to the 
rules of "the invisible war," however, if someone is caught 
red-handed here, this gesture is set to be reciprocated 
oversees. The only cause of "indignation" may be the "dumping" 
practiced by CIA recruiters in Russia: They pay virtually no 
"regular salaries," whereas "lump sum" payments usually do not 
exceed $30,000-40,000. 
  The war of intelligence services has tended to climax in 
periods of chilliness in interstate relations. Evidently, they 
have presently decided in the United States that the time has 
come. Why now? There are a number of suggestions. The U.S. 
Congress has just started the consideration of the next year's 
budget, and the draft has not contained lavish financial 
promises to the CIA. So far. But what appears to be the actual 
reason is the emerging chilliness in Russia's relations with the 
West. Furthermore, a meeting of the Group of Seven finance 
ministers will open on Saturday. The main question is the 
revision of the system of assistance to Russia. Washington has 
already hinted that if Russia "takes appropriate steps," the 
United States "will continue productive cooperation" (meaning 
the $2.5 billion of U.S. assistance). As a result of the 
chilliness, however, the as yet vague outlines of hostility 
toward the Chernomyrdin government may take on a more definite 
shape. And the former linkage of the assistance to the demand 
that "reform should continue" may be replaced by a more familiar 
rivalry with Russia. Of course, two arrested agents are not 
enough to change a climate. But they do spoil the weather.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Nadein: "Growing Spy Scandal--They Are </F>
Demanding That Russia Take `Voluntary Steps' To Curb 
Intelligence Against the West"] 
  [Text] Washington--On Wednesday [23 February], U.S. 
President Bill Clinton once again answered numerous questions 
from journalists in connection with the arrest of Aldrich Ames 
and his wife, accused of spying for the USSR and then also for 
Russia. For almost eight years, the person in charge of 
counterintelligence against the Soviet KGB was passing his 
country's topmost secrets to his Moscow masters -- for which he 
received from them more than $1.5 million. 
  Although on the previous evening, this prime news item did 
not leave the television screens, and the life of the married 
couple, in which not only the husband but also the wife were CIA 
staffers, had been subjected to thorough and almost 
month-by-month analysis, something substantial was added 
Wednesday. Citing official sources, radio stations reported 
that Aldrich Ames' activity had led, in particular, to the 
tragic deaths not so long ago of two Russian citizens who were 
CIA agents working for the United States. They were executed 
for treason -- without trial or investigation. 
  The U.S. President repeated once again that he regards this 
as a very serious case and that the scale of the damage to the 
government is not yet clear, although it is already known to be 
great. Clinton said that he has not spoken about this with 
Russian President B. Yeltsin, so as to give the Russian 
authorities time to consider an official response. 
  According to B. Clinton's statements, the special feature of 
the case consists in the fact that it is a question not of an 
"ordinary spy" but of a CIA veteran with 31 years' service. It 
was possible to understand from the President's retort that 
recruitment of a high official is a violation of certain accords. 
  The fact that there have been accords of this kind between 
the two governments is indirectly borne out by the fact that 
over the past two years quite a few U.S. counterintelligence 
staffers have been moved to the sphere of combating drugs, 
including A. Ames himself. It was possible to conclude from the 
comments of one former State Department staffer that the 
Russians had promised at a high level -- if not the presidential 
level, then very close to it -- to change the rules of the game 
and to get away from the usual espionage of the "Cold War" 
style. And now this turn of events.... 
  President Clinton said at the news conference that there are 
at least two reasons to demand appropriate actions from Russia. 
The first is already known -- the recruitment of a high 
official. The President said of the second reason only that he 
cannot speak of it yet, but he will when the time comes. 
  U.S. Secretary of State W. Christopher, who usually treads 
delicately and avoids harsh statements, endeavored to appear as 
fierce as possible when he maintained that the United States 
will never be able to reconcile itself to "this way of acting by 
Russia." In the absence of the ambassador (V. Lukin quit this 
post after being elected to that of chairman of a Duma 
committee, and Yu. Vorontsov has not yet completed the thorny 
path of being confirmed), the young diplomat V.I. 
Chkhikvishvili, Russian charge d'affaires ad interim, is being 
summoned to the State Department several times a day. 
  Jim Collins, an expert on Russia and the former No. 2 man 
at the U.S. Embassy on Ulitsa Chaykovskogo, has insistently 
recommended, so certain sources maintain, that Moscow refrain 
from the traditional countermeasure -- the expulsion of their 
present CIA resident agent. Moreover, it is proposed that 
Russian intelligence voluntarily recall or "call to order" those 
of its staffers who had contacts with Aldrich Ames "under 
diploamtic cover." 
  One high-ranking State Department staffer said: Immediate 
and voluntary "special steps by Russia" will make it possible to 
avoid the serious threat hanging over bilateral relations. 
  Commentators point out, however, that "the sunny 
relationship 
between Bill and Boris has receded into the Bosnian shade." 
Clinton himself, however carefully he chose his terms, made a 
very transparent allusion to the likelihood of a revision of 
"the whole policy (with regard to Yeltsin) which we have long 
followed." 
  The U.S. mass media regard the Duma's proclaimed pardon for 
the participants in two procommunist actions as a threat to 
Yeltsin and the reform process. This eases the bitterness 
somewhat and elicits some sympathy with the Russian president. 
  The opposition in Congress, however, is stepping up pressure 
on the administration. Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, 
has accused Clinton of placating the Kremlin for too long. 
Senator DeConcini, who once advocated giving Russia broad 
assistance, has now abruptly changed his stance. 
  Why is it that we Americans are indignant at Russia and are 
threatening to stop aid if we ourselves are doing the same thing 
against them? This question was asked over the telephone by a 
viewer of an evening television program entirely devoted to 
examining Mr. and Mrs. Ames. The commentator's reply, which 
followed at once, reflects the views of very many people in the 
United States. The gist of it was that the Russians are making 
fools of the Americans and abusing their kindness. By 
allocating billions in aid for Russia the United States is, as 
it were, paying for Russian espionage against itself and 
maintaining traitors with taxpayers' money. 
  Aldrich Ames and his wife, who appeared before a judge 
Tuesday, have not repented or asked for leniency. Maria, the 
41-year-old wife of the former leader of counterintelligence 
directed against the USSR, comes from a well-off family. The 
Ames' attorneys will most likely ascribe the large purchases, 
which are far in excess of what a cadre CIA staffer can afford 
on his wages, to her family means. 
  Neither A. Ames' place of birth nor the educational 
institution from which he graduated have yet been divulged by 
the CIA leadership. But Aldrich's father is known also to have 
worked for this department and also been an intelligence officer 
but, unlike his son, to have been a "good guy." 
  U.S. officials and mass media are accusing Russian 
television 
and newspapers of concealing from the Russian public the 
seriousness of this case and the arguments of the U.S. 
Administration. 
  If the charge against the Ames is corroborated in court, 
they 
are both threatened with life imprisonment and a fine of 
$250,000.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Vladislav Drobkov report: "Ames Affair. </F>
Power Politics Is a Tough Business. West Creates Image of 
`Willful Russia'"] 
  [Excerpts] Washington D.C., 23 Feb -- The U.S. capital, 
nestling cozily on the banks of the Potomac River, has not 
experienced such an outburst of passions over spying for a long 
time. Evening newspaper editions, television news broadcasts, 
statements by administration officials, including the president 
himself, and commentaries by observers and congressmen -- 
everything on Tuesday [22 February] was devoted to the arrest of 
FBI agent and CIA officer Aldrich Ames [as published] and his 
wife. [passage omitted] 
  Vladimir Chkhikvishvili, Russian charge d'affaires ad 
interim, was hastily summoned to the State Department. He 
received a strong protest from the U.S. side. The local press 
reports that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher demanded 
that Russia remove Ames' Russian case officers from the United 
States. 
  "If the Russians do not do it we can do it for them," an 
anonymous administration official, quoted on television, 
threatened. 
  Local commentators were quick to predict that the Ames 
scandal could seriously cloud Russian-U.S. relations. Some 
people are already asking whether U.S. aid to Russia, which is 
"spying on the United States," should be restricted. Former CIA 
Director Robert Gates claims that lately the Russian 
intelligence services, the GRU [Main Intelligence Directorate] 
in particular, have even stepped up their activities in the 
United States. But as a professional, Gates has urged that an 
excessive reaction to what has occurred be avoided. 
  Nevertheless, CNN reports, the double agent's arrest has 
already harmed diplomatic relations between our two countries. 
Collaboration between Moscow and Washington in the talks on a 
settlement in Bosnia has been jeopardized. 
  The fuss kicked up as if on command over what is, on the 
whole, an ordinary event is really surprising. After all, many 
local observers are now saying that there is nothing 
particularly new in the fact that both the United States and 
Russia are continuing to monitor each other. 
  But the history of mutual relations between Washington and 
Moscow features a considerable number of cases whereby 
"sensational revelations" and passions over spying proved to be 
by no means irrelevant to the carrying out of more significants 
acts. Are we not witnessing such a "coincidence" now?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yelena Ovcharenko and Leonid Timofeyev under </F>
the general headline: "CIA Staffer Suspected of Working for 
KGB. Aldrich Ames' Arrest in the United States May Become the 
Biggest Spy Scandal of Recent Years"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Our Commentary 
  Do you remember Shtirlits [allusion to master spy figure 
from 
Russian fiction] baking potatoes in the fire 23 February? 
Really, we do not know what Aldrich Ames was intending to do 
that day, and we must not get ahead of the court investigation. 
But it is already possible to examine the outline of the 
preceding and imminent events. 
  In January, speaking in Congress, CIA Director J. Woolsey 
presented a tough program of spying activity in Russia -- in 
four spheres. The boss is famous for the fact that during the 
whole of last year he had put pressure on U.S. legislators in an 
effort to secure something unprecedented: Despite the 
"political love affair" between America and Russia following the 
end of the Cold War, to not only keep appropriations for 
intelligence at the previous level, but even to snatch another 
10 million or so, Woolsey worried the legislators into doing 
something -- last year, he appeared in Congress 153 times! But, 
in all sincerity, what can be the best confirmation of being 
right than a sensational story about the sale of secrets to the 
Russians? And it is not that important what Shtirlits or 
Myuller [name as transliterated, allusion unknown] will turn out 
to be. The main thing is the therapeutic effect. And, 
incidentally, its consequences. And these can already be seen. 
  "Those who think that the Russians are doing 180 degree 
pirouettes and are becoming our closest allies are wrong," Dan 
Glickman, chairman of the House of Representatives Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence at Congress, said yesterday. 
And although White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers avoided 
answering the question of whether a reassessment of U.S. 
attitudes is not imminent in connection with the Ames affair, 
recalling that the spying activity began in 1985, "that is, in a 
fundamentally different historical period," CNN and CBC, citing 
sources in the administration, claim: "Russia will be allowed 
to send home its diplomats who collaborated with Ames on a 
voluntary basis. They will not be deported." 
  We did not manage to get in touch with Yevgeniy Primakov, 
the 
Russian Foreign Intelligence Service director. He went to 
Bratislava on Tuesday for a meeting with his Slovak colleagues. 
So it was Yuriy Kobaladze, leader of the Foreign Intelligence 
Service press service, who commented on the fact of the Ames' 
arrest for us. Or rather, he justly recalled there is not a 
single intelligence service in the world which comments on cases 
of the involvement of specific invidivuals in its network of 
agents. And then he recommended that we should turn to the CIA 
or the FBI for information about what deeds Ames had done in the 
United States. All U.S. journalists received the same 
recommendations when they besieged the "public" subdivision of 
the "secret" organ on Wednesday. 
  Behind the restraint of the Foreign Intelligence Service 
spokesman, there doubtless lies a calm reaction, which his 
colleagues on the other side of the ocean would do well to learn 
from. According to certain specialists in the intelligence 
sphere, to launch a spy-mania campaign instead of calmly dealing 
with their unexpected failures is just bad form. Ultimately, 
they believe, we are not doing anything that the Americans would 
not allow themselves to do in Moscow. 
  This latest case graphically demonstrates that relations 
between the intelligence services of great powers cannot be 
entirely "gentlemanly." 
  Of course, the Americans should have a clearer idea of whom 
they should arrest and whom they should not arrest in their own 
country. But among a number of other reasons, the fact that our 
counterintelligence not so long ago arrested a fairly 
high-ranking Russian official working for the CIA, as we found 
out, was not the least important reason. 
  Imagine that the Ameses really did work for the USSR. This 
means that the practice of a "tit for tat" response, usual in 
such cases, came into effect. Let us also recall that the 
"affair" came out at a time when Russia stunned the world with a 
specific initiative on Bosnia -- which the United States did not 
like at all, being accustomed to profiting from the 
amorphousness of our diplomacy over many years now, and 
constantly trying, little by little, to squeeze us out of the 
process of the adoption of major foreign policy decisions still 
further. And suddenly, success, a resolute stance, and the 
chief role in the Bosnian spectacle, which had been played out 
for many months according to the West's musical score. What 
disappointment for Washington, used to putting our Foreign 
Ministry in its own pocket! 
  Finally, if the Ameses do nevertheless turn out to be the 
people they are represented as today, then let us congratulate 
not only our diplomats, but also our intelligence service. And, 
incidentally, ourselves: It turns out that we are not paying it 
money for nothing for its activity. The money is not being 
wasted. Somehow we forget about this when we excitedly 
interview the deserters and betrayers who figure in our press, 
if not as martyrs to the cause of democracy, then at least as 
entrepreneurs in the "free market of state secrets."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich </F>
and Vladimir Taranov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 24 Feb--"All efforts must now be directed 
toward ensuring that the incident over the arrest of a CIA 
employee is settled without inflicting any significant political 
and diplomatic damage either to Russia or the United States". 
This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, 
director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian 
Federation Foreign Ministry. 
  "The position of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry in 
this question is pretty clear," he stressed. According to the 
Russian diplomat, the Foreign Ministry had been informed about 
the story regarding the arrest of a CIA member and his wife 
through official channels in Washington and Moscow. This whole 
story raises a great many serious questions that must be 
carefully and closely studied and analyzed. Clearly, it is the 
professionals--representatives of the special services of both 
states--who will play the leading role in this, Karasin noted. 
  Speaking about the political aspects of the incident, the 
Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that here "it is important 
to avoid overdramatization and extreme political emotions". The 
Russian side intends to clear up this incident quickly and 
effectively, Karasin noted in conclusion.

  [Text] Geneva February 25 TASS -- Georgian and Abkhazian 
delegations failed to reach an accord on key issues in the peace 
settlement between Tbilisi and its independence-seeking province 
during their four-day U.N.- and Russia-brokered meeting in 
Geneva. 
  The third round of talks, which ended on Friday, revealed at 
least two problems where a compromise is hardly possible. They 
are the future political status of Abkhazia and conditions for 
the return home of refugees. The draft agreements on both these 
problems remained unsigned. 
  The two sides agreed to renew negotiations in New York on 
March 7 on the proposal put forward by U.N. Secretary General's 
envoy Edward Brunner and backed by Russian envoy Boris Pastukhov. 
  Pastukhov told ITAR-TASS that he "regretted that the round 
of 
talks had not brought the desired result". 
  The only positive moment he could mention was the "motion 
towards a compromise" as both delegations confirmed that they 
welcomed the participation of the Russian military contingent in 
the UN peace- keeping operations in the conflict area.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Moscow Rejects Beijing's </F>
Proposal To Carry Out Exchange of Islands in Amur and Argun"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- The talks between China and four CIS 
states -- Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan -- on 
the border problem are of a secret nature, and few people 
outside a narrow circle of officials have a real impression of 
their results. 
  But greater openness is required if only to dispel the 
rumors 
that two islands near Khabarovsk in the Amur River and Bolshoy 
Island in the Argun River will soon share the fate of Damanskiy; 
that is, they will be transferred to the Chinese. 
  In actual fact Russia does not intend to give these three 
islands away. An informed source has reported that our Border 
Troops subunit, military base, and recreation center are located 
on the islands near Khabarovsk and that we regard them as 
Russian soil. At the same time Moscow is prepared to continue 
holding talks on these islands. Because abandoning the talks 
could lead only to an escalation of tension. In fact, the same 
happened at the time the USSR existed, when M.S. Gorbachev 
stated that the problem of the islands had been solved once and 
for all. This provoked a strong reaction in Beijing. 
  Not long before the last round of talks, which ended a few 
days ago in the PRC capital, Chinese representatives hinted that 
they were prepared to concede Bolshoy Island if Russia took the 
same step in relation to the two islands in the Amur. From 
Moscow's viewpoint this is an unacceptable idea. Therefore at 
the meeting in Beijing all the sides could do was to again 
recognize the existence of radical differences and postpone a 
solution to the question of the islands to an unspecified time 
in the future. 
  The talks on the line of the border between China and 
Tajikistan were also deadlocked. It is a question of control of 
part of the Pamir. The scale of the differences is indicated by 
the fact that China is laying claim to approximately one-third 
of the territory of Gorno-Badakhshan Oblast. But bearing in 
mind that this is an area in which Tajik armed opposition forces 
are especially active, it will be understood why Beijing is not 
trying to force a settlement of this dispute. It too has been 
postponed until a better time. 
  It should not be concluded from the foregoing that the 
Beijing meeting ended in failure. Far from it. With the 
exception of the islands in the two rivers and the Pamir, the 
differences concerning other sectors of the border between the 
PRC and the CIS, which is over 7,000 km long, are being 
successfully overcome. In the sector to the east of Mongolia a 
border line has already been drawn on the map, and on-site 
demarcation work is now under way. Nor should complications 
arise over the western sector of the Russian-Chinese border, 
which is 54 km long. 
  As regards relations between China and Kazakhstan, a border 
agreement between them is expected to be signed this spring, 
during Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to Almaty. In addition, 
a source considers it a positive feature that the 
representatives of the three Asiatic CIS states are 
collaborating closely with Russia and are relying on the 
informational material accumulated by our diplomacy. The next 
round of talks will take place in one of the CIS states.

sphere. Primarily there was a discussion of documents 
regulating the activity of the coordination bodies of military 
cooperation -- the Council of Defense Ministers, its 
secretariat, and also the headquarters for coordinating military 
cooperation. 
  The defense ministers of Belarus and the Russian Federation 
signed an agreement on interaction of air defense forces and 
means. 
  The next session of the Council of Defense Ministers is 
planned for the middle period of March. It is intended that it

  [Text] Chief of the Headquarters on Coordination and 
Military Cooperation between the CIS states, Serafim Yushkov 
approved of the decision on strengthening of the Tajik border 
adopted at the CIS defense ministers' meeting in Moscow on 
Friday. He suggested that military actions by Afghan Mojahedins 
and the armed Tajik opposition might become more active in 
spring. 
  According to Yushkov, the way from Afghanistan to Tajikistan 
will become easier due to opening of the mountain pass in spring. 
  The CIS defense ministers agreed to carry out the earlier 
agreements on stabilization of the situation on the Tajik-Afghan 
border. For instance, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan 
will bring their military contingency to Tajikistan. 
  The decision on the Tajik border is to be confirmed at the 
regular CIS summit planned for March 31.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 25 Feb -- A two-day sitting of the Council 
of CIS Defense Ministers ended today. The representatives of 
the military departments of 11 Commonwealth states took part 
along with the Moldovan delegation. Representatives of the 
Russian foreign ministry, Federal Assembly, State Duma, and 
border guard command also took part. 
  Deputy Defense Minister Boris Gromov, who presided over the 
meeting, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that he was fully 
satisfied with the results of the sitting of the Council of 
Defense Ministers. "All the issues included in the agenda were 
examined with positive results," Boris Gromov said. 
  A clause on the Council of Defense Ministers of Commonwealth 
states and on an organizational staff structure for the 
headquarters coordinating military cooperation between CIS 
states has also been agreed and prepared for signing by CIS 
heads of states. 
  It is proposed that the Headquarters will have a staff of 
244 
made up of representatives of the military departments of the 
states of the Commonwealth. 
  The meeting of the Council of Defense Minisers also 
initialled an important draft decision on measures to stabilize 
the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border. As Boris Gromov 
noted, the participants in the meeting agreed on the need for 
the full implementation of the measures adopted earlier on 
allocating peacekeeping forces to Tajikistan. The ITAR-TASS 
correspondent has learned that the draft decision on Tajikistan 
will be discussed on 18 March at a joint sitting of the Council 
of Defense Ministers and the Council of Ministers of Foreign 
Affairs of the Commonwealth. It is proposed that it should be 
signed at the meeting of the heads of state of the CIS scheduled 
for 31 March. 
  Decisions were also signed at the meeting on measures to 
prepare for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of victory 
in the Great Fatherland War and for holding in May-June 1995 the 
first spartakiad of the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth to be 
held since the disintegration of the USSR. The spartakiad will 
include 19 types of sport and will be held in various states of 
the Commonwealth under the slogan "For the Strengthening of 
Friendship between the Armed Forces of the CIS."

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 26 (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's Moscow 
newspapers focus on decisions taken by the lower house of the 
Russian parliament on amnesty in connection with the adoption of 
the new Russian constitution and on political and economic 
amnesty, as well as on the state of the nation speech by Boris 
Yeltsin at the Russian parliament. 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper features the complete text 
of both decisions by the lower house. In an article headlined 
"Algebra of the Compromise", the same newspaper prints 
statistical data on how factions of the lower house voted on 
these documents. 
  The ROSSIYSKIE VESTI newspaper prints an opinion by 
presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov, saying that 
"the decision on the political amnesty is immoral". The same 
newspaper also carries an opinion by Yuriy Baturin, the Russian 
president's national security assistant, who claims that "the 
Duma (eds: lower house) exceeded its powers". 
  Editor-in-chief of the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper Vitaliy 
Tretyakov, commenting on the Duma's amnesty decision, holds a 
diametrically opposite position. He notes that "no juridical 
chicanery can put into doubt the Duma's important political and 
psychological victory. 
  "If the Duma, in compliance with the constitution, has the 
right to amnesty both the convicted and those under 
investigation, and if it has done so, those who come under the 
amnesty should be released. If this does not happen, then the 
rights of the Duma and the rights of citizens are infringed 
upon." 
  Commenting on the president's speech at the Russian 
parliament on Thursday, the PRAVDA newspaper stresses that the 
president's state of the nation address "is interesting due to 
the fact that Boris Yeltsin spoke not the customary language of 
the Russia's choice movement but the language of those who 
consistently opposed the destructive policy imposed by radical 
democrats". 
  ROSSIYSKIE VESTI carries a series of comments on the 
president's state of the nation speech under the general 
headline "Parliament Should Shake the Extended Hand". Most 
comments note that "the presidential message is of general 
character". 
  However, they point at the same time to the fact that "most 
deputies regard the key points in the presidential message as a 
result of adjustments in line with political realities which 
changed after the December 12 elections". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA calls its readers' attention to the 
aggravation of relations between Ukraine and the Crimean 
Republic, a constituent part of Ukraine, as well as to possible 
confrontation inside the Crimean leadership in connection with 
Kiev's demand to streamline The Crimean constitution in 
compliance with the Ukrainian basic law. 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper carries an essay about 
Yuliy Khariton, chief designer of the first Soviet atomic bomb, 
who will turn 90 on February 27. 
  Under the title "Stalin's Death", the TRUD newspaper 
features 
with some abridgments the first part from a hitherto unpublished 
chapter of a book by former Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet 
Navy Nikolay Kuznetsov who personally knew Stalin for many years. 
  The chapter describes some almost unknown particulars from 
the last days of Stalin's life and other events of that time. 
  In the section "Essay of Russian Geopolitics", SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIA completes the publication of an analytical article by 
Russian Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, the first part 
of which was printed in the previous issue.

<F P=106> [By CRIME-PRESS correspondent Olga Semyonova] </F>
  [Text] Reliable sources reject U.S. media reports that the 
CIA delegation which negotiated with the Russian Foreign 
Intelligence Service on the "Ames case" has returned to the 
United States and is dissatisfied with the Russian reaction. 
  "As far as I know CIA representatives are still in Russia. 
They have met heads of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service 
to discuss professional and technical issues. It seems the 
sides have managed to reach mutual understanding in some 
aspects," a veteran staffer of the Russian Foreign Intelligence 
Service who used to work in the United States told CRIME PRESS 
on Friday. 
  Commenting on the "Ames case" Russian intelligence officials 
remind that in similar situations Russians seldom make fuss. 
Last year twenty people were arrested in Russia on espionage 
charge, according to First Deputy Director of the Russian 
Counter-Intelligence Service Sergey Stepashin. However, there 
were no scandals, demarches or loud protesting, as professionals 
can control their emotions. 
  Speaking to CRIME-PRESS on Friday, spokesman for Russian 
Federal Counter-Intelligence Service Aleksandr Mikhailov 
suggested an example of such sustained reaction the recent 
arrest of a major agent working for "a Western secret service" 
reported earlier this year by service Director Nikolay Golushko. 
As a result, attempts to recruit a number of high-ranking 
Russian officials have been prevented while the officials 
removed from their posts.

<F P=106> [Report by Yelena Ovcharenko and Leonid Timofeyev: "Have </F>
the Contents of the Slav Safe Been Sold to the Americans?"] 
  [Text] If THE WASHINGTON POST is to be believed, a 
delegation of representatives of the U.S. special services has 
already visited Moscow, not postponing a "showdown" or waiting 
for the chief of the Foreign Intelligence Service to return from 
Bratislava. "The CIA team, which went to Moscow to discuss the 
'Ames affair,' is returning without having managed to receive 
any useful information from Russian intelligence," AP notes. 
Our sources in the relevant departments did not try to dispute 
the Americans' assessmment, and even confirmed that their 
colleagues went away "empty-handed." 
  But, excuse us: We think that it would be naive to suppose 
that the U.S. espionage aces visited our glorious city expecting 
to find out something about the Ameses. What then? Maybe they 
were trying to sort things out about "poaching"? It is, after 
all, no accident that a "leak" has appeared in the U.S. press to 
the effect that the FBI possesses films showing that a meeting 
had been planned between Ames and a Russian intelligence agent 
in Caracas. It is probably no accident either that our services 
recently detained a certain high-ranking person incriminated of 
spying for the United States. The Americans probably have their 
"hooks" into other people with Russian passports working both in 
the United States and in "third" countries. Their Russian 
colleagues also have such documents. The Federal 
Counterintelligence Service Public Relations Center expressed to 
us the hypothesis that the representatives of U.S. special 
services could be in Moscow in order to ask us not to touch any 
of their intelligence agents or agencies. But none of the 
foreigners have appeared in the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service's lobbies in recent days, and coffee has not been 
ordered in the reception rooms for the official delegations. 
  No, most likely this was not an exchange of mutual 
grievances. Most probably, the Americans, who have involved 
their President in an unprecedentedly tough and hard-hitting 
role in the spy mania campaign, who themselves blew up the 
"affair" to the proportions of a national tragedy, came to 
Moscow to size up the prospects for the contacts which -- as is 
well known -- exist between the two countries' special services. 
Have they not gone too far, have they not spoiled everything 
hopelessly? Of course, no official will say whether this is the 
case. But experts propose that the "spylords" could have 
actually taken away specific proposals with them from Moscow. 
Though we think that AP is right here: They returned from the 
Russian capital, to a Washington resounding from the spy 
"fall-out," with nothing at all.

  [Excerpts] Washington, 26 Feb -- The U.S. State Department 
declared Aleksandr Iosifovich Lysenko, counsellor in the Russian 
Embassy in the United States, "persona no grata." [passage 
omitted] ITAR-TASS has learned that Aleksandr Lysenko arrived

Department's statement." Immediately after the announcement by 
the State Department, a large group of American TV reporters and 
media photographers gathered at the Russian Federation Embassy, 
practically blocking the entrance to the building situated a few 
blocs away from the White House. Policemen who are permanently 
stationed at the Embassy are watching the developments with 
indifference.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb (CRIME-PRESS) -- "Even if Ames really 
did work for us, what does [Aleksandr] Lysenko, who only came to 
the United States last summer, have to do with it?" Yuriy 
Kobaladze, head of the press bureau of the Foreign Intelligence 
Service, said in an interview with a CRIME-PRESS correspondent. 
After all, if one is to believe the FBI, the country the Ames 
started spying for was the old Soviet Union, and the 
surveillance over them began 10 months ago. 
  Moreover, for the first time in the history of relations 
between our countries, Aleksandr Lysenko was, as it were, an 
official resident of the Russian intelligence in the United 
States. He was introduced to the director of the CIA and to the 
U.S. Administration in this capacity and was involved in 
"cooperation" between the two special services in tackling 
issues of global significance which override the rivalry between 
the two intelligence services, such as the fight against 
international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, and other issues. 
  Now, as a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry has 
announced, Russia is forced to take countermeasures and hence 
expel a CIA employee.

<F P=106> [By INTERFAX observer Dmitriy Voskoboynikov; from the </F>
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] Could it be said that the Bosnian crisis is leading 
to the first serious manifestation of discord between Russia and 
NATO? Moscow does not want to paint a gloomy picture. Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev, with whom I spoke on Friday, stressed the 
importance of supporting the strategic partnership with the 
West, including in resolving the Bosnian problems. Evidently he 
will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the 
second half of March - it is unlikely it can be managed earlier 
- to discuss how that can best be achieved. 
  However, the Foreign Ministry's attitude to the NATO 
ultimatums is unequivocal. Their time has passed and if they 
are put forward once again with regard to one or another of the 
warring sides in Bosnia without consultation with Russia that 
will be simply a farce. The Kremlin is reacting calmly to the 
fact that some G-7 caricaturists have returned to the image of 
the Russian Bear. Both Yeltsin and Kozyrev state with 
satisfaction: A Bosnian settlement is not possible without 
Russia. 
  Will their opponents, who earlier demanded the resignation 
of the head of the Foreign Ministry practically every week, get 
into parliament? 
  However, nervousness has arisen in relations between Moscow 
and Washington, which obviously was not prepared for decisive 
Russian diplomacy. At least, many have formed the impression 
that the fuss which arose around the Ames couple in the United 
States was whippped up not in the least because Russia's 
excessive independence on the Bosnia issue was not to 
everybody's liking. 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] It is difficult to get away from 
the impression that what we're dealing with are attempts by 
certain circles to provoke a kind of exacerbation, on the one 
hand, to cast suspicion on Sarajevo, on the other hand -- I have 
to say, on the whole, that in the United States, and in our 
country, Russia, too, there are numerous examples of that -- the 
partnership between the two great powers is not to everybody's 
liking. Therefore, I think that it is difficult to get away 
from the impression that it's a provocation we are dealing with.

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Feb -- Georgiy Mamedov, the deputy 
foreign minister of the Russian Federation, is confident that 
"the Ames case" will not affect the Russian-U.S. relations. 
  After the conclusion of a working visit to Latin American 
countries, Georgiy Mamedov visited Washington where he was 
holding negotiations on the situation around Sarajevo and 
Russian-U.S. relations. Straight after his return to Moscow he 
said in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent that "they 
touched on the question of 'the Ames case' but it is an 
exaggeration to say that I was a special representative on this 
matter." Georgiy Mamedov said that there is rather a big fuss 
in the United States over this matter, but he believes that a 
lot is unclear in this case -- Ames himself has not admitted to 
being guilty. 
  Georgiy Mamedov said that it is difficult to explain why the 
declaration of "the Ames case" has coincided in time with the 
critical situation over Sarajevo and with the declaration of the 
new initiative by Boris Yeltsin, the president of Russia. 
  The deputy minister noted that "we simply should calmly and 
in a balanced way sort all that out."

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "Why Is Washington Making a </F>
Fuss?"] 
  [Text] The circumstances of the exposure and arrest of the 
CIA counterintelligence agent accused of cooperating with Soviet 
and Russian intelligence prompts a host of questions and 
requires explanations attributable to the extremely specific 
realities of American society. 
  The key questions, in our view, are the following: 
  Why was it deemed both possible and necessary to include 
President William Clinton directly in the propaganda campaign 
immediately launched by Washington? It is possible to recall a 
fair number of spy scandals which have erupted in the United 
States in recent decades, including the affair of the Walkers, 
father and son, for working with whom Oleg Kalugin, if you 
believe the former general of Soviet intelligence, was 
handsomely decorated. But not one of these affairs was 
advertised at such a high level as the presidency. Even Ronald 
Reagan, who never missed an opportunity to have a fling at the 
intrigues of the "Evil Empire," was not actively involved in the 
public exposure and condemnation of the Walker family, who 
inflicted extremely ample damage on the United States. So why 
was Clinton dragged in, although it was perfectly possible to 
restrict things to a statement by the director of the FBI or the 
bureau's direct chief, the attorney general? Was it not in 
order to stress with especial authority Washington's 
dissatisfaction with Moscow's actions? Probably this is so. 
But surely Moscow, in carrying out intelligence operations 
against the United States, was not doing anything different to 
what the United States engages in in Russia? 
  Surely Washington will not really try to prove that it does 
not recruit its own intelligence agents, or that, in doing so, 
it places a special premium on holders of secrets of extreme 
importance, and consequently, on our intelligence and 
counterintelligence agents? 
  IZVESTIYA has already carried a brief report on the recent 
arrest of a certain Russian citizen who inflicted the same sort 
of damage on our interests as Penkovskiy once inflicted on the 
Soviet Union. According to the information at our disposal, 
either the Americans or their traditional intelligence partners, 
the British, had been working with the new "Penkovskiy" -- it 
was the British, let us recall, who recruited the original 
Penkovskiy, and later wooed him together with the CIA. 
  Competent sources clearly intimate that they see a direct 
link between the arrest of the neo-Penkovskiy and the exposure 
of the CIA official: It is a sort of retaliatory action, they 
told me. 
  An action all the more serious, let me stress, for the U.S. 
President's being directly involved. What lies behind this? 
Theories are being voiced that the arrest of Ames is a response 
not only to the arrest of the spy in Russia, but also to the 
boldness displayed by Moscow in the Balkans, a boldness which 
for the first time in recent years cast the United States into a 
secondary role in world politics. By the sensationalism of the 
Ames affair, by direct hints that very swift and sincere 
apologies are expected from Moscow, as if spying were an 
exclusively Russian activity, we are pretty clearly given to 
understand: Just you know your place. 
  There is, however, some hope in Russian intelligence sources 
that the Ames affair will not cancel out all the productive and 
useful elements that have developed in recent years in relations 
between the Russian and U.S. special services. It would be a 
pity, my sources told me, if these relations were now undermined. 
  And a final point. However you look at it, the main credit 
for exposing Ames belongs to American-style Pavel Morozovs 
[Soviet archetype of someone who informs against his own 
relatives]. After all, it was Ames' neighbors, staggered by the 
inordinate expenses of this civil servant on an ordinary salary, 
who drew him to the attention of the "competent organs." And 
after that it was all a matter of technology, with which the 
U.S. counterintelligence agency is handsomely equipped. 
  One cannot fail to mention that, in the previous sensational 
affair -- that of the Walker family -- the role of exposer 
belonged to the mother and former wife of the spying duo. State 
interest transcend personal and even family interests; this is 
roughly how she explained to reporters the motives of her 
action, which, it must be said, was absolutely typical of the 
realities of American society.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Ivanidze report: "Why Is Moscow Staying Silent?"] </F>
  [Text] An avalanche has descended on the Russian Foreign 
Intelligence Press Service. This is how we may describe what 
has been happening since Wednesday morning at the old Moscow 
town house at 11 Kolpachniy Pereulok. Press Service Director 
Yuriy Kobaladze has been parrying questions about Aldrich Ames, 
the Soviet-Russian agent in the CIA, which journalists have been 
asking all day, with just one answer: "We have no comment to 
make on events in Washington" and "the Foreign Intelligence 
Service is concerned and would not want to see anything hamper 
the building of good relations between the United States and 
Russia." 
  Replying to an IZVESTIYA question about how our intelligence 
service -- when it was still Soviet -- managed to recruit such a 
high-ranking CIA staffer as Aldrich Hames, Yuriy Georgiyevich 
sighed heavily: "Who told you we recruited him?" My 
explanation -- that Bill Clinton himself had told everybody that 
Ames had been recruited -- provoked an altogether human reaction 
from the chief of the intelligence service Press Center. 
  "Well, you must understand that I am not the president or 
the 
Foreign Ministry! I cannot comment. And no special service in 
the world would comment on whether a particular person is one of 
its agents or not. If I say yes, then I put a guilty man in the 
dock, and if I say no, you will ask me to prove it. Basically, 
the official position of the Russian intelligence service is not 
to comment!" Mr. Kobaladze stated. 
  In order to find out about the Russian intelligence 
service's 
unofficial policy, we had to approach a ranking Foreign 
Intelligence Service staffer who asked us not to reveal his name. 
  Thus something unusual has happened in the normal practice 
of 
intelligence services. The U.S. President has personally 
informed the whole world that the FBI has caught a former Soviet 
and now Russian spy together with his wife, also a spy. The 
Russian intelligence service representative believes that 
Clinton has started a real "spy-mania" which has not been long 
in coming. All the American newspapers have taken up the 
improbable scandal, and the arrest of the Ameses has been 
covered in great detail. 
  The intelligence service representative did not agree that 
the arrest of such important agents could be regarded as a 
setback. "Just a minute, why do you think it's a setback?! The 
intelligence service has recruited practically the head of the 
department. What do you call that, a setback?! In this matter 
interpretation is everything. Well...of course, the fact they 
have been arrested is not a good thing. The intelligence 
service certainly can't rejoice about it. But it is completely 
wrong to state unequivocally that it is a setback," the 
representative told IZVESTIYA. 
  He did not deny that all the fuss that has been made could 
be 
connected with the fact that the FBI and CIA are worrying about 
their budgets. Propaganda stunts of this nature are practiced 
by intelligence services all over the world. Particularly in 
countries where public opinion has an impact on the size of the 
budget. 
  In this representative's opinion, today Moscow could also 
arrest CIA agents in Russia and create a furor. "But we won't 
be doing this," the representative added; he believes that 
Russian spying against the United States is at least no greater 
than the level of U.S. intelligence activity against the former 
Soviet Union. 
  And so the facts look like this. It is clear that Clinton 
has taken an unprecedented step by personally announcing the 
capture of a spy, thus linking his name with the success of the 
special services forever. From this it would seem that the 
proof of Ames's guilt cannot be doubted. 
  Moreover, the CIA and FBI are not getting tired of praising 
one another, which is also surprising. The squabbling between 
these two departments has long been a tradition. 
  Finally, one last point. The Ames agents apparently did 
everything in their power to ensure that the FBI found them out. 
They bought a house in a luxurious suburb of Washington and paid 
for it with a lump sum rather than in installments. They bought 
a very expensive sports car. And most surprising of all, they 
spent an enormous quantity of money which far exceeded their 
salaries. And when they spent all this money, as if for the 
FBI's convenience, they used credit cards rather than cash! All 
this is somehow not very hush-hush. 
  Judging by the reaction of Russian departments and the text 
of the U.S. protest note, it has been suggested that our country 
should stay silent until the United States has concluded its 
investigation and Clinton has won his brownie points. All the 
indications are that there are no specific complaints against 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Ravil Mustafin: "What Lies Behind the Arrest of </F>
the Ames'"] 
  [Excerpts] CIA officer Aldrich Hazen Ames, 52, was 
arrested on his way to work. His wife Maria was arrested at 
home. The Ames are accused of spying for the former USSR and 
for Russia for nearly nine years. [passage omitted] 
  In principle the arrest of a foreign agent is not that rare 
an event in the invisible war the various special services have 
been waging among themselves for many centuries. But the arrest 
of the Ames caused, perhaps, an overreaction in the United 
States. In Moscow U.S. Ambassador Pickering made an official 
protest to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Lavrov. In 
Washington Secretary of State Christopher asked those Russian 
diplomats who had been in contact with the Ames' to leave the 
United States quietly, as it were. President Clinton, who, as 
it happens, was aware that U.S. counterintelligence had had the 
Ames under surveillance for 10 months, ordered administration 
staffers to carry out a detailed analysis of the consequences of 
the spies' activities for U.S. national security. Some senators 
were calling for aid to Russia to be frozen. 
  According to our experts, there are several ways of 
explaining the ballyhoo in the United States over the arrest of 
the Ames. First and foremost it could be a wish on the part of 
the U.S. special services to obtain one-sided advantages in 
conducting intelligence on Russian territory. Actually, Russian 
intelligence is doing no more in America than U.S. intelligence 
is doing in Russia, according to one Foreign Intelligence 
Service representative. Incidentally, CIA Director James 
Woolsey has repeatedly stated that his department is keeping an 
extremely close eye on Russia. 
  It is not inconceivable that the Ames case got such heavy 
publicity in view of the exposure of more than 20 foreign, 
including U.S. intelligence agents in Russia last year. They 
included a Russian citizen, who, as Nikolay Golushko, director 
of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, said in an IZVESTIYA 
interview, had caused damage to Russian national security 
interests comparable to the damage caused by former GRU officer 
Penkovskiy, who was shot in 1963. 
  Some observers believe that the furor caused by the arrest 
of 
the Ames' is a kind of adverse reaction on the part of certain 
U.S. circles to the shift of emphasis in Russian policy in the 
Balkans.

<F P=106> [Ravil Mustafin report: "Ames Affair: The Furor Continues"] </F>
  [Text] It would appear that the fuss raised over the 
arrest of the Ames couple, who is accused of spying for Moscow, 
is increasingly taking on a hysterical character in the United 
States. An ITAR-TASS correspondent reports on the artificially 
hyped atmosphere of spy mania around the so-called Ames affair. 
An indicative example: On TV shows viewers are being asked 
what punishment they would determine for this married couple, 
who are accused of espionage. Whereas formerly it was claimed 
that two Soviet citizens cooperating with the CIA were exposed 
and executed in the eighties on Aldrich Ames' tip-offs, this 
figure has now already increased to 10. 
  Meanwhile, after Ames fell under suspicion from the FBI in 
1991, he was removed from top-secret work involving opposition 
to the KGB and was transferred to a department remote from 
politics -- the department for combating narcotics. 
  All the same, the exposure of a double agent, a routine 
event 
for the intelligence world, is still riveting the heightened 
attention of the mass media. THE WASHINGTON POST reports on the 
recently completed visit of a special CIA delegation to Moscow. 
Details of the visit by the U.S. intelligence agents to their 
Russian counterparts are not reported. The paper only says that 
discussion of the Ames affair was unproductive. However, it can 
be assumed with a great deal of probability that the visitors 
from Langley could not have failed to take advantage of the 
opportunity afforded to them of censuring their Russian 
colleagues and rivals for not honoring a sort of gentleman's 
agreement between the two intelligence services to stop 
recruiting their agents among high-ranking officials, to which 
category Aldrich Ames can apparently be assigned. It can also 
be supposed that the Americans tried to twist the arms of the 
Russian intelligence agents to make them wind down their 
activity on U.S. territory and reduce the number of Russian 
intelligence agents working there. And, possibly, they also 
tried to find out what secrets Ames betrayed. 
  Of course, the leadership of the Foreign Intelligence 
Service 
[FIS] could not meet such demands. FIS Director Yevgeniy 
Primakov once called on the Americans to wind up intelligence 
activity against each other on a mutual, equal basis. However, 
the Russian intelligence agency's call was left hanging in the 
air. In principle it would be possible to return to discussion 
of this proposal today. However, judging by the assessment of 
this visit given by the Americans themselves, Langley believes 
that only they have the right to carry out intelligence activity. 
  It would be unjust to accuse Russian intelligence agents of 
perfidy and breaking a gentleman's agreement -- if, despite all 
the stupidity of such an agreement, it does exist. The point is 
that Ames, the U.S. press claims, was recruited back in the 
mid-eighties before the beginning of Gorbachev's perestroyka. 
And Russian intelligence agents, as it were, inherited him from 
the Soviet intelligence agency. And it would be simply the 
height of folly to refuse the services of such a valuable agent. 
I am confident that, if the Americans were in our place, they 
would have acted in exactly the same way.

<F P=106> [Interview with KGB Major General Boris Solomatin, retired, </F>
by unidentified correspondent, under the rubric "Exclusively for 
TRUD"; place and date not given: "We Have Begun to Assess One 
Another Differently"] 
  [Text] This comment on the "Ames affair" comes from KGB 
Major General Boris Solomatin, retired. According to his 
colleagues he is one of the most successful intelligence 
officers and has recruited at least four superspies, one of them 
an agent who is mentioned in this commentary. 
  [TRUD] Aldrich Ames is not the first agent to be exposed but 
he is the first whose exposure has merited comment at the very 
highest level. Why is that? 
  [Solomatin] I was in intelligence work for 37 years, I was 
the resident in India and Italy and twice in the United States 
(1965-1968 and 1971-1975), and I could quote many examples. 
  The Soviet Union did not react officially to the exposure of 
Penkovskiy, Tolmachev, Yuzhin, and others who worked 
successfully for the Americans. FRG Chancellor Brandt left 
office because a close aide of his turned out to be a GDR 
intelligence officer. Even that well-known expert on Russian 
folklore, President Reagan, did not presume to respond 
officially in 1985 to the report that for 17 years the Russians 
had a U.S. spy (it would be nobler to call him an agent) with 
whose help we were able to fully monitor top-secret 
communications traffic [perepiska] between nuclear submarines, 
the main component of the U.S. atomic triad. As for the damage 
caused to U.S. security by that agent, U.S. specialists have 
noted that in the event of war -- which heaven forbid, of 
course! -- the scales could have been tilted in our favor. It 
is with good reason that they called him the agent of the 
century. Furthermore, at the very top in our country there were 
people who were seriously afraid of a sharp reaction from the 
United States in the event of that agent's arrest. But there 
was no official reaction. All that happened was that 
journalists in the United States published four thick volumes 
and a few movies were made. 
  [TRUD] Evidently something has changed in relations between 
us if the arrest of an agent has become the grounds for 
political statements. 
  [Solomatin] I believe that we have begun to assess ourselves 
and each other differently. From being equal powers whose 
intelligence services worked against each other we have been 
transformed into a country which has to ask permission to do 
this now. 
  I believe that this began when we started to surrender and 
abandon our positions without a fight and with a certain degree 
of enthusiasm. The blame for this rests largely on Gorbachev 
and his unprofessional clones Bakatin in the KGB and Pankin at 
the Foreign Ministry. After the Cold War ended something 
occurred in our country which happens when you clean out the 
sewers: At the top there were so-called state figures who 
decided that the time had come to look after their own affairs 
at the expense of the state's interests. These and other "great 
guys" set about the destruction-cum-"reformation" of state 
security and first and foremost the intelligence service. They 
finally found a scapegoat, the cause of all our failures. But 
it is already clear now that the real "goat" in the form of the 
old party-administrative hierarchy is still alive and well and 
sends us all a greeting. The reform of the state and of the 
security system ended in failure. I recall how when they 
completed the reform in our country they entered the 
international arena and invited the gentlemen in the West to 
reciprocate by abandoning intelligence work themselves. The 
reply was an intensification of intelligence work in the 
republics of the former USSR. 
  But when journalists, in the course of earning their daily 
bread, tried to obtain information about this they invariably 
heard the reply -- "we do not comment on intelligence and 
counterintelligence operations." In the United States they have 
progressed not just to commentaries but also to statements by 
the president on this question, a routine question as far as 
intelligence work goes and even more so when viewed in the 
context of history. 
  Clinton has full access to a short 1975 study by the "Rand 
Corporation," the think tank of the U.S. Air Force, which talked 
about the possible impact of the successes and failures of the 
intelligence services on interstate relations. The specialists' 
conclusion was this: This cannot have a particularly 
significant impact on relations between states. 
  Some people are trying to link the inappropriate U.S. 
[neadekvatnyy] reaction to our so widely publicized diplomatic 
action over Sarajevo in which Russia outdid the United States. 
I do not believe that. In my view what we are dealing with 
today is a typical recurrence of imperial thinking in the United 
States, a criticism which those people, incidentally, 
ceaselessly level at us. It is all quite simple: We can, you 
cannot. We can because we have the money. Whereas you have an 
outstretched hand. We can because our pockets are full, yours 
are empty. You may be a power if you want to but it must be 
within the confines of your own Russia. Beyond that it is us 
and our interests. 
  I think that the Americans did not give it much thought when 
they embarked on this scandal. They overlooked at least two 
possible consequences. 
  First, in Europe, where I also worked and I know how 
arrogantly U.S. intelligence agents behaved toward their 
European colleagues (toward the Italians, for example), this 
fuss will make many specialists smile: For decades, they will 
say, you never tired of lecturing us or of criticizing us 
because we are bad at keeping our secrets and because KGB agents 
take them away by the sackload and now you yourselves have 
allowed this embarrassment to occur. 
  Second, when Russia itself looks into the mirror of this 
story it will suddenly see that the big bucks which are being 
spent on intelligence are "working." And we will realize the 
importance of intelligence work to the state and will begin to 
organize it properly.

  [Text] Washington, 25 Feb -- The arrest of CIA staffer 
Aldrich Hazel Ames, who has been accused of spying for Russia, 
has "in no way affected" the visit to the United States of a 
group of Russian members of parliament and representatives of 
the law and order bodies, the ITAR-TASS correspondent learned 
from the head of the delegation, Mikhail Mityukov, first deputy 
chairman of the State Duma. 
  The group of Russian representatives, which is in the United 
States to learn about fighting organized crime and protecting 
intellectual property, has had meetings with high-ranking 
representatives of the FBI and the State Department. They were 
received by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and U.S. Commerce 
Secretary Ronald Brown. 
  "There have been no contacts on this problem, and in any 
case 
we are not empowered to hold meetings with anyone on these 
issues," Mityukov declared. "I think this isolated case should 
not sully the pretty friendly level of relations between our 
countries. It will be examined and studied by the appropriate 
bodies, both Russian and American, after which we shall be in 
possession of real information. I think this case is being too 
much politicized".

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Borisenko] </F>
  [Excerpt] Washington, 26 Feb -- Russian parliamentarians 
and law enforcement workers are visiting the United States with 
the aim of familiarizing themselves with the experience of U.S. 
law in fighting organized crime. They have held meetings with 
Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown, 
and representatives of the State Department and the FBI. 
  The arrest of the CIA agent Aldridge Ames, accused of spying 
for Russia, "has had no effect" on the visit, Mikhail Mityukov, 
the head of the delegation and first deputy chairman of the 
State Duma, told ITAR-TASS. In his words, at meetings with the 
FBI heads, they discussed the fight against organized crime, 
first and foremost against the Italian mafia and Asian criminal 
groups. 
  We are primarily interested in how organized crime is 
combated in the United States, and how the law enforcement 
bodies act and cooperate, he continued. "The primary problem," 
according to M. Mityukov, is drawing up an American-Russian 
agreement on arranging laws which would open new paths toward 
cooperation in fighting organized crime. 
  Meanwhile, he added, the Russian and American experts "are 
establishing contacts to coordinate" their efforts. 
  Serious attention during the tour of the Russian delegation 
has been devoted to issues of intellectual property. "The fight 
against intellectual piracy is very topical", the Russian 
parliamentarian said. Both Russian and American businessmen are 
affected by it." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Text] The holding of joint military exercises is 
noteworthy now. As journalists often say, such a thing was 
quite unthinkable just a few years ago. Joint exercises were 
held very rarely, and as a rule only with our former Warsaw Pact 
allies. Joint exercises are now being held perhaps not so much 
more frequently, but every exercise is considerably more 
interesting, especially those conducted with our former enemies, 
members of the NATO bloc. Joint exercises with the Americans 
are planned for July this year. Colonel General Georgiy 
Kondratyev, deputy defense minister, talks about the details of 
these exercises. 
  [Begin Kondratyev recording] This will be the first time not 
only in the history of the Russian armed forces, but also in the 
history of the entire former Soviet Union, that such exercises 
have been held. They will be joint exercises, involving the 
27th Motor Rifles Division of the Volga Military District of the 
Russian Armed Forces, and the 3d Infantry Division of the United 
States. The commanders of the Russian Federation land forces of 
the Volga Military District and I, as deputy defense minister, 
have already worked out a plan for conducting the exercise. We 
determined that the main goals of the exercise should be: to 
examine jointly issues relating to possible planning of 
peacekeeping operations; what documents are necessary for this; 
how to train the personnel; and directly, during the course of 
the exercise, to work out questions relating to real actions, 
approximating the actions of U.S. and Russian subunits in 
conflict zones, that is, real actions during peacekeeping 
operations. These command and staff exercises will involve not 
only the commands of the two divisions but also a number of 
subunits. We agreed on somewhere around 200 or perhaps 250 men, 
up to two companies, with their own standard combat equipment 
and reinforcement assets. I think these exercises will go off 
very well indeed, and our officers will get a certain amount of 
experience in planning and conducting peacekeeping operations 
not only in CIS countries but also perhaps in other spots round 
the world. 
  Why has this need emerged? Starting in 1992, as you know, we 
have been carrying out peacekeeping operations, and we are doing 
so currently in the Dnestr region, in South Osetia, and to some 
extent in North Osetia and Ingushetia, where a troop is 
involved, and we have taken part in the Abkhaz-Georgian 
conflict. According to the latest understanding between 
President Boris NIkolayevich Yeltsin of Russia and Mr. 
Shevardnadze in Tbilisi, it is possible that Russia will carry 
out peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia, under the aegis of the 
CSCE and perhaps the United Nations, something which we are 
aiming for. The need to share experience in conducting 
exercises has therefore become urgent. And we shall hold such 
exercises. I believe this is useful both for the Russian side 
and for the American side, and indeed, useful for other 
countries, too. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F>
correspondent Dmitriy Vosboynikov on 25 February; place not 
given; from the "Novosti" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] As you know, an initiative was put 
forward by Russia recently for the leaders of the five leading 
states to hold a meeting on the settlement in Bosnia. Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev today stated his point of view 
on the prospects for such meeting. 
  [Kozyrev] It seems to me that this idea is gaining more and 
more support. Late last night I had a telephone conversation 
with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, where he said it 
should be well prepared and that this meeting, proposed by the 
Russian president, provided an answer to the main question 
confronting us at the moment -- how to prevent the bird we have 
managed to catch in Sarajevo slipping from our hands. 
  [Voskoboynikov] Are you planning a meeting with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher? Quite a lot of issues 
worth your discussing seem to have accumulated lately, such as 
Bosnia or the Ames affair. 
  [Kozyrev] I would like to say that it was a proposal of the 
president, who suggested a serious discussion of strategic 
matters with President Clinton. With us it is, as it were, as 
if a car were going along the road of partnership, but when a 
sharp bend occurs on that road, then it starts vibrating because 
it lacks various mechanisms. A stabilizing device is needed. A 
stabilizing strategy for mature partnership -- that is what it 
is all about. It was with this in mind that a meeting of 
ministers was proposed. At the moment we are searching for the 
best solution, but it is a fact that I received an official 
invitation today.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>
  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian 
president's special envoy, rejected the idea of using "the 
Sarajevo technique" elsewhere in Yugoslavia. 
  NATO officials have been calling on an increasing number of 
occasions for using the technique of an ultimatum followed by 
diplomatic activity in Tuzla and Mostar. 
  Churkin told NATO that a replay of the Sarajevo scenerio was 
out of the question. He believed that that which did not come 
off the first time, is also not going to lead to anything the 
second time. He did not think that air strikes could be 
effective in Mostar, where Bosnian Croatians and Moslems are 
engaged in fighting. "In any case, we do not support such 
operations," he emphasized. 
  He said that what was needed in Tuzla was opening the 
airport 
for humanitarian aid rather than lifting the siege. "Various 
options are possible but I do not think that the humanitarian 
situation in the town can be improved by shelling its environs," 
Churkin said. 
  Vitaliy Churkin stressed that energetic activities were 
being 
carried out in Tuzla. "The purpose is to open the airport under 
an agreement between the UN forces' leadership in former 
Yugoslavia and the two conflicting parties -- Serbs and Moslems. 
Both Serbian and Moslem parties put forward the demands which 
hamper the resolution of the issue on opening of the airport," 
he said. 
  "Russia keeps working with Serbs. However, we hope that 
somebody else will assume responsibility for negotiations with 
Moslems who currently control the airport. To open the airport 
it is necessary that the UN and Serb observers come there. This 
creates certain problems for the Moslem party," Churkin added.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Feb -- My dream is that, pushing on from 
such an important moment in the Bosnian crisis as the initiative 
of the Russian president, a democratic consensus will start 
taking shape in the sphere of foreign policy, which would sever 
all extremist attempts, Vitaliy Churkin, the deputy foreign 
minister and the special representative of the Russian president 
in the conflict zone, said. Commenting at the request of an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent on today's decision of the Federation 
Council to allocate an additional military contingent for the UN 
forces, the diplomat stressed that we do not need confrontation 
and war, but we need a strong foreign policy based on a 
democratic consensus. Today's parliament decision, adopted at 
Yeltsin's request, will make it possible, he says, to hope that 
that is exactly how it will be. 
  Churkin reported that for the time being the issue of 
expanding the presence of Russian troops in other places is not 
on the agenda. In general, he thinks that the crisis over 
Sarajevo -- the behavior of the Russian side and of our Western 
partners, who are NATO members -- needs to be analyzed 
seriously. During the crisis our attempts to solve issues 
amicably with them did not always produce a response, the deputy 
minister noted. That is why now, he believes, we need to 
formulate our position more precisely and to defend it in an 
equally precise way.

  [Text] Moscow February 25 TASS -- "I favour the formation 
of a democratic consensus in foreign policy to prevent any 
extremist pronouncements. The consensus should proceed from the 
Russian president's initiative on the Bosnian settlement," 
Deputy Russian Foreign Minister and presidential envoy to the 
conflict zone Vitaliy Churkin said here today.

foreign policy to be based on democratic consensus," said the 
diplomat commenting on ITAR-TASS request at today's decision of

forces. The decision taken on request of Boris Yeltsin will give 
hope to the consensus, he said. 
  In the words of Vitaliy Churkin, the question of expanded 
Russian presence in other areas has not been raised. 
  "We still have to analyze the crisis around Sarajevo -- the 
behavior of Russians and their Western partners, members of 
NATO," said Churkin. "Our attempts to peacefully settle 
problems of the crisis have not always been supported," he 
noted. "We should clearly outline our stand and keep to it," 
said Churkin.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1845 GMT on 25 February broadcasts 
its "Man of the Week" program, which features an interview with 
Vitaliy Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister and Boris 
Yeltsin's special envoy for the settlement of the Yugoslav 
crisis, by an unidentified correspondent. The program combines 
an interview with Churkin with biographical facts and pictures 
of Churkin at work. 
  In the introductory extract, Churkin says of the threatened 
air strikes on Bosnia: "If it had happened, if air strikes had 
been carried out, that would have been regarded inside Russia as 
a national humiliation, and I thought this was simply 
inadmissible." 
  Churkin is asked by the interviewer to describe his most 
unpleasant impressions from his latest visit to Sarajevo. He 
replies: "My most unpleasant impression was linked with the mass 
media. Generally I associate myself with the most fervent 
supporters of freedom of speech and a free press. But what I 
saw there forced me to think a little more deeply about the 
responsibility of journalists as well. This is because on 20 
February, on Sunday, about 300 journalists arrived, all the 
world's leading TV companies and others besides. Most of the 
journalists who arrived were war specialists, and they had come 
to film a war, to film air strikes. On the Sunday, when I gave 
a news conference with Izetbegovic, when we addressed the media 
after our meeting, the situation was extremely tense. The press 
was demanding air strikes. And I must say that that frightened 
me a little, not theoretically but simply practically, because 
there were still some unclear points, and it was impossible to 
completely rule out the worst at that time. The fact that their 
mood was broadcast on TV screens to the whole world could in one 
way or another have influenced the most serious political 
decisions. 
  "I tried as best I could at the news conference in Sarajevo 
to defuse the passions, and we do not really know for sure how 
successful I was, but the next day the mood of the journalists 
had changed a great deal. Not because of me of course, but 
because the television journalists in particular had had to 
spend the whole night on the roof waiting for air strikes, even 
though it was already clear to everyone by about 2100 the 
previous evening that everything was all right and that there 
would be no air strikes. 
  "So you see, there are complex and ambiguous aspects in your 
profession as well." 
  Churkin admits that during his talks with the Serbs, the 
situation seemed "almost hopeless." "However, it must also be 
said that I was holding a great trump-card -- the letter from 
the president containing both a request to the Serbs to withdraw 
heavy weapons from Sarajevo and our pledge to then send our 
troops to the Sarajevo region. If I had not succeeded, holding 
such a trump-card, in having such a brilliant proposal accepted 
by the other party at the talks, that would of course have been 
a colossal blow for me as a professional. So it was indeed a 
fairly tense moment." 
  Churkin says he did regard the operation as a personal 
success, but adds emphatically that it was "a huge success for 
the Foreign Ministry, in which the collective working on this 
situation performed outstandingly well." He praises in 
particular the contribution made by Deputy Foreign minister 
Sergey Lavrov. "Everyone joined in and managed, in an extreme 
situation and in a short period of time, to carry out a complex 
diplomatic operation." 
  Asked how he explains his rapid rise to the post of deputy 
foreign minister at the age of 42, Churkin says he has always 
studied hard and he has always said what he thinks. He 
describes himself as "democratically oriented," but adds that he 
has never felt the need to participate in political movements. 
  Asked about his special strengths and weaknesses as a 
diplomat, he says he is able to communicate with the most 
diverse people, but that he regrets not having learned French 
well. 
  The program ends with more general questions about Churkin's 
likes and dislikes and words of praise for Churkin from the 
correspondent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, deputy foreign minister and </F>
the Russian president's special envoy to former Yugoslavia, by 
Mayak observer Vladimir Pasko on 24 February in Moscow -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The situation in Bosnia is attracting 
attention even after the elimination of the Sarajevo crisis. 
Will it prove possible to extend the cease-fire around the 
Bosnian capital to other flashpoints in the country? This 
question formed the subject matter of a conversation between our 
observer Vladimir Pasko and Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Ivanovich Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy, who 
was in Sarajevo at the height of the crisis and subsequently 
held consultations with representatives of the United States, 
the European Union, and United Nations Organizations in Bonn. 
  So last Thursday he returned to Moscow and, immediately 
after 
reporting to the Russian leadership on the work he had 
accomplished, he received a Mayak representative. 
  [Pasko] Vitaliy Ivanovich, it was not the first time that 
you 
had been to Yugoslavia, Belgrade, and Sarajevo. What is going 
on there? How do you see things, not as a man burdened by tasks 
of some kind, but as a simple observer? 
  [Churkin] If one is to talk about change, then, visually, 
the 
most noticeable changes have probably occurred in Sarajevo. My 
last two visits to the city over the past seven days contrasted 
sharply, of course, in atmosphere with what things were like 
earlier. I was first in Sarajevo in May 1993, later I was there 
on two other occasions, and now the fourth and fifth trips have 
taken place during the last seven days. 
  Well, the city is calmer now. Snipers are still firing, but, 
even so, in the streets, in the main street, children were 
running around, since it was covered with snow. They tried to 
slide about on something remotely like skis, clung on to a car 
and slid over the snow. There were more people in the streets. 
In other words, the situation is moving away from being a war 
one. 
  During the last trip, I had to spend a night in Sarajevo for 
the first time -- that famous night of the 20-21 . Although we 
slept in quite a comfortable flat that night, there was no 
electricity -- electricity is a rarity. The water comes on for 
an hour or two during the day, and one can fill up in the 
bathroom. Needless to say, there is no... 
  [Pasko, interrupting] And the water is ice cold? 
  [Churkin] Needless to say, there is no hot water. It is more 
than cool in the apartment. 
  [Pasko] What about food? 
  [Churkin] Well you see, the city's population is supplied 
through the United Nations, the Red Cross, and other 
humanitarian organizations. The rations are extremely meager. 
  During one of my trips, I was taken to a bakery. It is the 
only bakery in Sarajevo. Incidentally, it is of interest, and 
it is important, that the bakery operates on Russian gas. When 
people throughout the world talk about humanitarian aid to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and to Sarajevo, it is somehow not mentioned 
that, throughout these months, albeit with interruptions, 
Russian gas has been getting through to Sarajevo, and, if it had 
not been for Russian gas, the city might simply have perished, 
since that is the only source of any kind of heating. It is the 
only source of power for the only bakery in the city. 
  But, in general, one can see that people do not have enough 
to eat, and that life is very hard. It is easier for the UN 
people. There are special food supplies for the United Nations. 
Meals at UN headquarters are pretty good -- you get a first, 
second, and third course. UN back-up is quite good. It is 
simply impossible to feed the city on the same level, of course, 
since airborne supply is the only source of provisions, and 
disruptions are not uncommon. 
  So, the fact that it has proved possible, nevertheless, to 
carry out the operation to place heavy weapons -- both Serbian 
and Moslem -- under control or to withdraw them is not just a 
qualitative military-political turnabout; it is also an 
extremely important humanitarian action. We now hope that it 
will be possible to advance further toward normalizing the 
situation in the city. At the moment, in many districts there, 
one can only drive along in an armored personnel carrier or in 
an armored jeep. It is still dangerous. There are checkpoints 
everywhere between the Croatian and Moslem districts of the 
city. In other words, there is still a very long way to go to 
normality. We will have to do some special work on that now. 
  [Pasko] Vitaliy Ivanovich, as far as I recall, Sarajevo is 
mainly a Muslim city. Of the 360,000 population only 40,000 are 
Serbs. 
  [Churkin] Yes. The Serbs that there are rather more. If I 
am not mistaken they say 60,000. There are also Croats there, 
10-20,000 of them, but indeed, there are mainly Muslims and 
Serbs. The problem is that in some places in the city - although 
they all lived together just as they did throughout the country 
-- there are quite clearly defined Serbian areas of the city. 
Grbavica area, for example, where our battalion is now 
stationed along with the French, is a Serb area of the city. 
And the demarcation line passes between Muslim and Serb areas. 
And the reason why this cross-fire and the exchange of 
artillery strikes took place recently is that as soon one of the 
sides made an attempt to change the front line in the city -- 
quite often this was the Muslims who have a superiority in 
infantry -- then the Serbs responded with powerful fire from all 
of their weapons against the city. The result is that the city 
has been destroyed to a very large extent. 
  The Serbs have now withdrawn their weapons or put them under 
UN control. The Muslims have also handed over about 50 heavy 
weapons. They simply had less of these in the city, but they 
have also put them under UN control. Now neither of the sides 
has the capability of firing. 
  [Pasko] What surprises me here is the statements made by 
some of the Bosnian leaders who represent the Muslim community 
and, in particular, the Bosnian representative in the United 
Nations, attacking our initiatives and the fact that our Russian 
battalion has appeared there. That is, clear dissatisfaction is 
being expressed when it would seem that the reaction should be 
quite different. 
  [Churkin] As for the specific person that you have referred 
to, I can say that he is a totally irresponsible man who is 
distinguished by the fact that throughout the crisis he has made 
the most disgraceful statements, taking advantage of the fact 
that he speaks English well. There are also people who are not 
so keen on naked propaganda but who have also recently made 
similar statements. I have had contacts with the people who make 
these statements. I know them quite well. There are 
considerable differences between their positions and ours. We 
are aiming toward peace while they are aiming toward war. It is 
as simple as that. 
  I do not consider that this is the position of the whole 
Muslim leadership or -- as it is now usually referred to in 
international contacts -- the Bosnian Government. For example, 
Izetbegovic, the number one and Silajdzic, the number two, in 
the Muslim leadership, occupy a more pragmatic position and I 
still proceed on the basis that they understand that it is 
necessary to reach a political accord. 
  You only have to talk to those other people and it becomes 
totally clear -- and they do not even conceal this -- that they 
want to fight the whole war over again. 
  [Pasko] If there are disagreements among the Bosnian 
leaders, 
how can it be hoped that they will agree to a peaceful 
settlement and how can it be hoped that an external diplomatic 
interference being discussed at the moment will be successful? 
  [Churkin] Well, you have touched upon a most painful issue. 
This is one of our biggest difficulties. Admittedly, there is 
no unity among their leaders and this is clear to everybody. 
Therefore, conditions should be created whereby the people 
supporting extremist approaches would be isolated, so that they 
should understand that nobody is going to add fuel to the war 
and that the time has come to conclude a peace agreement. I 
think that such moment is likely to come. The settlement 
documents themselves need some further improvement, but on the 
whole, the time will come when the positions of people with more 
pragmatic views in the Muslim government will become stronger, 
but this is one of the most difficult tasks -- how to isolate 
extremists among the Muslims. 
  [Pasko] To what extent can we count on U.S. assistance in 
this matter? After all, a strange statement was issued after 
the recent talks in Washington between U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher with Haris Silajdzic. 
  [Churkin] Well, these statements seem clear enough to me. 
You know, I think that statements should be taken at their face 
value. On the whole, Americans tend to say reasonable and 
correct things. There is nothing wrong if the Americans have 
decided to work in closer contact with the Muslims and, to some 
extent, with Croatians, and to come up with some new sensible 
proposals regarding the settlement. The stress should be laid 
on the word sensible -- I said this to the Americans and then 
repeated it at the multilateral meeting in Bonn, and everyone 
seemed to agree. The important point is that the Americans are 
now saying that, like the Europeans and like us, they proceed 
from the assumption that borders should be drawn on the basis of 
a key criterion -- that a republic with the Muslim majority is 
to get 33.3 percent of the territory. Now this criterion has 
been consolidated in the U.S. approach. If the Americans, as 
they help the Muslims with this business -- this is a very 
complicated job, you have to read the map and calculate on the 
computer all the time the percentage [of parts of territory due 
to each side], and to take into account a number of various 
parameters -- if they really arrive at some sensible proposals 
that can be accepted by the other sides, then I can see 
absolutely no harm in this. After all, we can help the Serbs to 
take a realistic stance -- why cannot the Americans help the 
Muslims do the same? If they succeed, they will deserve fame 
and glory. All the more so that we have an understanding, the 
Americans have assured us that they intend to work in the 
closest possible contact with us, and I am in fact quite pleased 
with the personal and professional relations I have developed 
with U.S. Special Envoy Charles Redman. So, my attitude to all 
this is calm. But it is important that all these agreements and 
intentions expressed both publicly and privately should be 
implemented in the same form in which they were declared. 
  [Pasko] Vitaliy Ivanovich, now the last question. We -- I 
mean President Yeltsin -- have suggested holding a summit on the 
Bosnian settlement. Knowing all that you know, how did your 
partners in the former Yugoslavia settlement talks react to this 
proposal, in your opinion? 
  [Churkin] Well, for instance, I have just seen the British 
statement that welcomes this proposal. When I say partners, I 
mean a broader circle of partners involved in the settlement of 
this conflict. So here is the first unequivocally positive 
response, but there is something I would like to add. Of 
course, as far as I know, the proposal does not imply that the 
meeting could take place tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or 
next Sunday. It is desirable to have it within some deadline, 
so that we do not lose the impetus gained through resolving the 
political crisis around Sarajevo, but intensive work will of 
course be necessary to achieve this. I must say that right now 
we are involved in extremely intensive work on political 
settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Second, we do not think that this is the only possible 
format 
of such meeting. There can be some other forms of a summit. So, 
although this was stated formally and authoritatively by the 
president, we are open to suggestions. I would like to finish 
this with a little joke: We are against any kinds of ultimatums.

<F P=106> [Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report: "Bosnia's Enfant Terrible Is </F>
Expected in Moscow Soon"] 
  [Excerpts] Russia intends to follow up on its diplomatic 
success in the Balkans. Andrey Kozyrev has personally invited 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to come to Moscow. In the 
West his name has become a synonym for "Serb aggression" and he 
is considered "the number one defendant" in the future 
international trial of Yugoslavia war criminals. He will arrive 
in Moscow at the beginning of next week. This sensational piece 
of news was reported to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent Sergey 
Tsekhmistrenko in an exclusive interview by the president's 
special envoy Vitaliy Churkin, the main "culprit" for the Balkan 
triumph. The conversation took place immediately after 
yesterday's session of the Federation Council, where Mr. Churkin 
made a statement during the debate on sending an additional 
Russian troop contingent to Bosnia. In his opinion, Russia, 
having blocked the execution of NATO's ultimatum, saved not only 
Sarajevo but the North Atlantic bloc itself from an inevitable 
ground war in the Balkans. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  What lies ahead? </H5>
  According to Mr. Churkin, Russia intends to exploit the 
success. In this context he welcomes the Federation Council's 
decision to send an additional 300-strong contingent to the 
conflict zone which will be deployed not only to Sarajevo but 
also other hot spots (the results of the discussion, in the 
diplomat's opinion, point to the first indications of a 
democratic consensus on foreign policy emerging). The dialogue 
with the Serbs will also be raised to a basically new level, and 
in this sense Karadzic's upcoming visit can be seen as only a 
first sign that could be followed by Moscow's de facto 
recognition of Slobodan Milosevic (up to now his relations with 
Yeltsin have been rather cool). Mr. Churkin said preparations 
are under way for a summit meeting of "great power" leaders (on 
Yeltsin's initiative). In his words, the West has supported 
this idea while the debate at present is centered around the 
"format of the meeting:" whether it will be attended by five 
(as Yeltsin proposed) or more leaders. At this point 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY's commentator differs with the deputy minister, 
believing that there is far from universal support for Yeltsin's 
idea in the West while considerable efforts are yet to be 
undertaken to make sure that Vitaliy Churkin's hopes are 
translated into life. And his own efforts will also be 
essential here. May God help him!

<F P=106> [Konstantin Eggert report: "Vitaliy Churkin: `Russia Has </F>
Saved Not Only Sarajevo, but Also NATO's Prestige'"] 
  [Text] "The significance of President Yeltsin's initiative 
on Bosnia must not be underestimated, but it is still too early 
to sound a victory" -- Vitaliy Churkin, deputy foreign minister 
and the special representative of the head of the Russian state 
for the former Yugoslavia, stated in an interview with IZVESTIYA. 
  He admitted that the main difficulty continues to be the 
search for a formula for a political settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. "A meeting between five leading powers -- 
Russia, the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany -- 
is not the only possibility, and we have already proposed other 
options for the cast of participants," Churkin reported, 
avoiding more detailed explanations. 
  Answering a question about the degree of mistrust which the 
Muslims feel toward the officers and men in the Russian 
peacekeeping battalion, the deputy chief of Russian diplomacy 
said: "I raised this question myself in a conversation with 
President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I think I 
was able to convince him that our military are not an 
anti-Muslim force in any way." Churkin emphasized the amicable 
tone of the talks with Izetbegovic, noting: "We are proceeding 
from the official statements of the Bosnian leadership, and not 
paying attention to the irresponsible Muslim activists who want 
war rather than peace." 
  Following the 12 December elections, AFP circulated a report 
to the effect that the Russian battalion in Croatia, part of 
which is now redeployed in Sarajevo, voted almost to a man for 
the communists and Zhirinovskiy's party. In that case, can we 
count on the impartiality of these people? Vitaliy Churkin gave 
the following answer to this question: "AFP did not count up 
the votes. We have secret ballots, and everyone is free in 
making his decision. I know the servicemen in the battalion. 
They are highly professional and disciplined officers and men. 
Today they are standing in the line of fire, preventing both 
the Muslims and the Serbs from being killed." 
  The president's special representative is convinced that the 
Kremlin's initiative has saved not only Sarajevo, but also 
NATO's prestige. In his opinion, air raids would have led to an 
escalation of war on the entire territory of Bosnia, because 
they may have created the illusion among some of the Muslims of 
an easy victory, which in actual fact would have been 
unattainable. "Following the bombings, the North Atlantic bloc 
would have had to take the next logical step -- that of 
bringing ground forces into Bosnia, which would have dragged 
Europe into the quagmire of a long and futile war," Vitaliy 
Churkin believes.

  [Text] Russia's Foreign Ministry is "closely analyzing" the 
situation following the downing of four combat planes belonging 
to the Bosnian Serbs Monday morning in the area of Banja Luka in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by NATO aircraft, a senior Foreign Ministry 
official told Interfax on Monday. 
  As he said, Russia's Foreign Ministry sent an inquiry to the 
headquarters of the UN Protection Forces in the former 
Yugoslavia. "According to the preliminary data available to the 
headquarters, the Bosnian Serbs' planes were returning to their 
base after a bomb strike on a military plant controlled by 
Bosnian Muslims. If this is indeed the case, the Bosnian Serbs 
violated one of the UN Security Council's resolutions adopted 
more than a year ago. The resolution bans flights by military 
planes in the air space of Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said. 
  According to the diplomat, the "closed skies" resolution has 
been repeatedly violated by Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croats. 
"They all were aware of the possible "adequate military" 
measures toward "the violator." However such measures were not 
taken till today," he said. 
  Russian diplomats who scored in the past two weeks 
considerable successes on the road of settling the crisis in 
Bosnia by peaceful means had repeatedly warned the Serbs, Croats 
and Muslims against the possible provocations "by field 
commanders or whoever else," Interfax's interviewee pointed out. 
"Now what we warned against and what we feared has happened," he 
said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 26 Feb -- The Russian side has adopted the 
only correct stance in the settlement of the Bosnian conflict: 
"The best path to peace is the one that does not produce human 
casualties." This was stated at a news conference today by 
Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff 
of the Russian Armed Forces. 
  The situation in the region of the conflict, the general 
said, remains complex. The NATO ultimatum on bombardments has 
not been lifted. An increase in forces is essential. This is 
why, at the suggestion of the Russian president, the Federation 
Council decided to send an additional contingent of Russian 
"blue helmets." 
  They have been given the task, Mikhail Kolesnikov said, of 
separating the opposing sides, preventing attempts to transfer 
heavy weapons to other parts of the Balkans, ensuring unhampered 
access to Sarajevo for humanitarian aid convoys, and creating 
conditions for the deployment of additional UN forces.

the Bosnian conflict. The fulfillment by the Serbs of their 
commitments to withdraw heavy weapons from the vicinity of 
Sarajevo is, to a great extent, an act of trust in Russian 
policy in the region. According to our correspondent Marina 
Chernyukha, this was stated at a news conference in Moscow today 
by Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian 
Armed Forces. He emphasized that compared with the Muslims' 
infantry the Serbian infantry now finds itself in a 
disadvantageous position. If the former want to seek revenge, 
it might have grave consequences. 
  The prevention of provocations by either side is the main 
task of the Russian blue helmets. It was noted at the briefing 
that the additional contingent of 300 servicemen will be 
arriving in Bosnia in March.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Sidorov: "President Warns Against </F>
Provocations In Sarajevo"] 
  [Text] As is known, Russian head of state Boris Yeltsin 
expressed the hope that all sides in the Bosnian conflict will 
observe the cease-fire and will not perpetrate any provocations 
against UN forces, including Russian soldiers in Sarajevo. 
  Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian Federation president's special 
representative, before returning to Moscow after his latest tour 
of former Yugoslavia, said that the possibility of adventurist 
sorties and provocations against the "blue helmets" in Sarajevo 
is not ruled out. According to him, there are those among 
Muslim figures in Bosnia who are continuing to make neurotic and 
sometimes irresponsible statements. The Russian diplomat did 
not specify who said what, although it is known that people very 
close to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic have repeatedly 
called the Russian contingent in Sarajevo "occupiers." Muhamed 
Sacirbey, the Bosnian Muslim government's representative at the 
United Nations, used the same word recently. 
  According to a spokesman for the Russian Armed Forces 
General 
Staff, this "rebuke" should seriously worry both the Russian 
leadership itself and Russia's partners among the NATO 
countries. Neither the British, nor the French, nor any other 
national contingent in the UN force in Bosnia has been attacked 
in this way. And if the deliberate defamation of the Russian 
"blue helmets," who played a key part in relieving the tension 
around Sarajevo, does not stop, Russia, according to him, will 
be fully entitled to consider a range of independent measures to 
protect its soldiers. That is what France did, for example, by 
sending an aircraft carrier group to the Adriatic Sea when Paris 
believed the lives of the French servicemen in Bosnia to be in 
particular danger. 
  Nonetheless, Russia's stance on the Bosnian conflict remains 
the same. No ultimatums or threats of intervention by force 
will help resolve the crisis, which has a considerable 
international as well as internal dimension. Russian 
diplomacy's aim at the present stage is to make the cease-fire 
in Sarajevo the breakthrough to peace in Bosnia as a whole. And 
this will be achieved through close cooperation with the United 
Nations and NATO. This is the aim of the new Russian initiative 
on a summit meeting to discuss ways of stopping the war in 
former Yugoslavia, to be attended by the United States, Russia, 
France, Britain, and Germany. The foundation for the success of 
the conference exists. At the Bonn meeting on Tuesday there was 
unanimity, according to observers, among the Europeans, 
Americans, and Russians on a number of aspects. Chiefly on the 
fact that all countries interested in a settlement of the 
conflict must use all their political authority to pressure the 
warring sides into accepting the terms of the EC peace plan with 
regard to the territorial division of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  Western capitals' initial reaction to Russia's initiative 
varied. The British Foreign Office has so far refrained from 
commenting, traditionally deferring to Washington. The United 
States, in turn, is in no hurry to assess the initiative, 
believing that a "summit meeting would require a great deal of 
preparation." There was a neutral, "if not negative" reaction 
from Rome. "The fact that Italy was not named among the 
participants in the proposed meeting made a negative impression" 
on Italian Foreign Minister B. Andreatta.

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry issued a statement today, saying the following: 
  Violence has again flared up in the territories occupied by 
Israel. At dawn today an Israeli settler opened machine-gun 
fire, killing and wounding dozens of people in al-Khalil 
[Hebron]. As a result, the situation has sharply deteriorated 
on the West Bank of the river Jordan and in the Gaza sector, and 
clashes have taken place between Israelis and Palestinians, 
causing more human casualties. 
  We decisively condemn this act of terror, carried out during 
a time of prayer in the month of Ramadan, which is sacred for 
Muslims. Measures must urgently be taken to prevent similar 
occurrences in the future and to punish the culprits. We 
express our condolences to the families of those who were killed 
and injured, and to all Palestinians. 
  It is notable that the incident in al-Khalil has been 
condemned by the leadership and the main political parties in 
Israel, which, however, does not absolve the Israeli leadership 
of full responsibility, nor does it remove the need to act in 
such a way that will prevent violence from increasing. 
  Such acts are certainly having a negative influence on the 
process of the Arab-Israeli dialogue and are damaging to 
everything positive that has been achieved toward a Middle East 
settlement through intense efforts. This crime has been carried 
out precisely when a tangible possibility was taking shape for 
arriving at an agreement between Israel and the PLO on the 
introduction of self- government in Gaza and the Jericho area. 
We consider it necessary to do everything possible to ensure a 
productive continuation of the talks and to prevent giving the 
extremists a chance to torpedo the peace process. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry is closely following the 
development of the events and is in contact with the interested 
parties in the interest of a speedy normalization of the 
situation and the creation of conditions for the further 
development of the peace process in the Middle East.

  [Text] Moscow, 26 Feb -- Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
was in touch with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat today. He 
expressed condolences in connection with the tragic death of 
scores of totally innocent people in Hebron (al-Khalil), which 
has aroused the indignation of Palestinians, Arabs, and the 
entire Muslim world. We resolutely condemn this crime, the 
minister said. 
  Andrey Kozyrev expressed the hope that neither the 
Palestinians nor the Israelis would give in to the provocations 
of extremists and that the vigorous search for an all-embracing 
peace in the Near East would be continued. 
  In this connection Yasir 'Arafat stressed that he was 
interested in Russia's vigorous efforts. He requested the UN 
Security Council to support the Palestinian proposals. 
  Andrey Kozyrev replied that Russian representatives at the 
UN 
would urgently be given instructions on this score. They agreed 
to maintain day-to-day contact on these issues both by telephone 
and via diplomatic channels.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Pshenichnikov] </F>
  [Excerpt] Lillehammer (Norway), 27 Feb -- Oleg Soskovets, 
first deputy head of the Russian Government, paying an official 
visit to Norway today met Norwegian Minister for the Economy, 
Oil Industry and Power Sector Jens Stoltenberg. 
  Oleg Soskovets told ITAR-TASS that the meeting focused on 
cooperation between the two countries to exploit offshore oil 
deposits. Norway has unique experience in this area and the 
future of the Russian generating industry lies precisely in this 
kind of extraction of oil and gas. A month ago, Russia and 
Norway signed a memorandum on cooperation in oilfield 
development. This is now being put into effect and a legal 
framework is being drawn up. Norway is interested in partnership 
with Russia and is planning close cooperation with it also as 
part of the European energy charter. Our interest is in 
management experience in oil and gas extraction with foreign 
investment, Oleg Soskovets stressed. 
  Commenting on the outcome of his meeting here on Saturday 
with Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Godal, he said that Norway 
is closely following the reform process in Russia. The 
Norwegian foreign minister was told that no changes to the 
Russian government's reform policy are planned and that the 
reforms are irreversible. It was also stressed that Russia is 
in a special situation by virtue of its involvement in the CIS. 
This refers primarily to the credits for fuel purchases that 
Russia extends to CIS states because of economic and political 
circumstances. These credits are considerably more than the aid 
being planned by the G-7 and the IMF. This circumstance defines 
the specific nature of relations between Russia and the other 
CIS states, the first deputy prime minister emphasised. [passage

  [Text] Almaty February 25 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin invited his Kazakh counterpart Nursultan Nazarbayev to 
pay an official visit to Moscow in the end of March to boost 
bilateral relations. 
  The press service of the Kazakh leader said that the 
invitation was extended during a telephone conversation between 
the two presidents on Friday and that in Moscow it is planned to 
sign agreements "which would bring into the practical sphere the 
solution of many political, economic, military and humanitarian 
cooperation issues as it is envisaged in the Friendship and 
Cooperation Treaty between Russia and Kazakhstan". 
  Earlier the Russian foreign minister said that the issue of 
the disputed Baykonur cosmodrome is to be solved in Moscow. 
  The press service also said that Nazarbayev supported 
Yeltsin's ideas voiced in the message to parliament about the 
strengthening of the Russian statehood, invariability of the 
course of democratic transformations and economic reform and, 
especially, about an active integration in the CIS. 
  The press service of the Kazakh leader said that the two 
presidents positively assessed the results of the recent visit 
of Nazarbayev to the United States.

news conference here today after visiting the Petropavlovsk 
heavy machine-building plant. The plant used to produce 
launchers for medium- and shorter-range missiles. 
  The inspection was made within the framework of the Treaty 
on 
Medium- and Shorter-Range Missiles joined by Kazakhstan after 
disintegration of the former Soviet Union. The republic has a 
quota on sending its inspectors to the United States and an 
obligation to admit U.S. representatives to Kazakh facilities 
liable for inspection. 
  The inspection was the first of the sort in sovereign 
Kazakhstan. It was held in an atmosphere of cooperation and 
mutual respect thanks to the correct stand of the Kazakh Defence 
Ministry's accompanying team on treaty obligations, said the 
Americans. 
  The experts are sure Kazakhstan will continue to fully 
observe its military obligations.

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Tsygankov report under the "Belarus" rubric: </F>
"Belarusian Parliament May Enter Guinness Book of World 
Records. Named Ballot Papers To Be Used To Vote on 
Constitution"] 
  [Text] With a number of personnel matters smoothly 
resolved, the next item on the agenda of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet session was the long-awaited report by the prime minister 
"On the Structure of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of 
Belarus." Vyacheslav Kebich has been promising the 
reorganization since last November. The parliament had tasked 
the prime minister with presenting the reorganization plan by 15 
December 1993. The prime minister's report, however, has been 
postponed over and over again for various reasons. This time, 
too, it was announced at the session that Kebich was sick. It 
is evident to independent observers that Vyacheslav Kebich will 
not make his report public until the situation in Moscow 
regarding the unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and 
Russia is clarified. The parliament, for its part, turned to 
what may be the focal point of the current session -- the 
adoption of the Republic of Belarus' new constitution. 
  Attempts to do so have been inconclusive at every succeeding 
session for as long as 18 months. Now, Vasiliy Sholodonov, 
chairman of the conciliatory commission tasked with drawing up a 
draft constitution, proposed that the fundamental law be adopted 
by voting with named ballot papers. The vote should be held for 
three days to adopt the three main sections of the constitution: 
on the Supreme Soviet, the president, and local authorities. 
  When Oleg Trusov, an opposition deputy, wondered if there 
has 
been a historical precedent of adopting a constitution in this 
fashion, Sholodonov responded: "History is created by people, 
and only then is it analyzed. If there has not been anything 
like that in history, then there will be." Another opposition 
parliamentarian, Vladimir Kakovko, retorted: "You have just 
fashionably explained to us how we can go down in history, but 
we may just enter the Guinness Book of World Records instead." 
  Be that as it may, the deputies approved the procedure for 
voting with named ballot papers and appointed a commission to 
count votes, which presented a ballot paper design. Upon 
receiving a ballot paper, a deputy is obliged to sign his or her 
name and subsequently confirm his vote by affixing his or her 
signature. According to the vote-counting commission chairman, 
the ballot papers offer splendid protection from forgery. Under 
this system, not only will the 250-270 parliamentarians present 
take part in this session, but also the deputies who are 
currently absent for valid or not very valid reasons (the 
Belarusian parliament comprises a total of 346 deputies). By 
introducing named ballot papers the parliamentary majority 
expects to win the requisite number of votes -- 231 -- to pass 
the section on the president first. Meanwhile, a draft Supreme 
Soviet decree on calling parliamentary elections on 20 November 
1994 has already been handed to the deputies. Thus, the "party 
of power" has embarked on the practical implementation of its 
strategic plan to adopt the constitution, to elect the 
president, and only then to hold elections for the Supreme 
Soviet.

<F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondents Vladimir Glod, Larisa Lazar for </F>
TASS] 
  [Text] Minsk, 26 Feb -- It appears that on the first day of 
spring Belarus will change from being a parliamentary republic 
into a presidential republic. On the evening of 1 March the 
results will be announced of the secret vote by Belarus 
parliamentarians, with named voting slips, for or against 
introducing the institution of a presidency. And although 
officially the voting will end only at 1800 on 1 March, the 
BELINFORM correspondents have learned from confidential sources 
that 230 voting slips have already been deposited in the ballot 
boxes and 210 deputies have voted in favor of introducing the 
post of president as the head of state and executive authority. 
For this decision to receive the force of law it needs to 
gather another 22 votes. 
  About 100 parliamentarians have not yet received their 
voting 
slips. And even taking into account that 40 deputies have said 
that they will not vote, one can predict today with 99.9 percent 
certainty that Belarus will have a new state structure.

  [Text] Commenting on a statement signed by 40 people's 
deputies of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet, in which they refused 
to participate in the voting on the draft constitution, 
Vyacheslaw Kuznetsow, first deputy Supreme Soviet chairman, 
stated: "I think that the behavior of these people's deputies 
is very illogical, the more so since some of them were members 
of the Constitutional Committee. They have stated that they are 
against the form of voting. I, personally, believe that this is 
just an unwillingness to adopt the basic law," Vyacheslaw 
Kuznetsow concluded.

  [Text] I will either not vote at all or vote against it, 
because nobody has defined the subject of the voting, former 
Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich told an RID 
correspondent immediately after receiving his ballot for voting 
on three chapters of the Belarusian draft constitution. The 
point is that this is the wrong way to vote. It would be better 
to vote on separate chapters, and even better on separate 
articles. If the voting concerned separate articles, I would 
approve about 20 of them, the ex-speaker added. Asked why he 
did not join the statement signed by 40 deputies who refused to 
participate in the voting, Stanislav Shushkevich responded that 
he was simply not informed.

  [Text] Mogilev February 27 TASS -- Ex-speaker of the 
Belarusian Parliament Stanislav Shushkevich seems to have 
launched an election campaign for the republic's presidency. 
Over the past few days, he has been touring Belarusian cities 
and towns, calling for early presidential and parliamentary 
elections. 
  Shushkevich held at the weekend two meetings in Mogilev with 
the city's workers, stressing that "to make economic reforms in 
the country effective, democratic forces should unite on the 
basis of statehood, political and economic democracy, that is on 
the basis of transition to a free market". 
  Speaking about the merging of Russia's and Belarus' monetary 
systems, he came out for "a decent agreement, on equal terms, 
without any infringements upon Belarus' interests".

  [Text] Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich has 
described the assessment of prospects for Russian statehood, 
which was made by the Russian Federation president in his annual 
address to the Federal Assembly, as deep and comprehensive. 
According to the address, the prime minister noted that it is 
important that Russia is not giving up its reforms. The fact 
that priorities of the reforms are to be slightly changed 
totally conforms to the Belarusian Government's position.

  [Text] Dushanbe February 26 TASS -- Lieutenant-General 
Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of Russian Border Troops in 
Tajikistan, made a statement on Saturday concerning the growing 
number of armed provocations from the Afghan territory. 
  Tajik opposition militants shell both Tajik villages and 
Russian border posts, says the document circulated by the 
Information Directorate of the Tajik Foreign Ministry. 
  For instance, the border village of Parvar, Shuroabad 
District, which is in the area of operations of the 12th Border 
Post, Moskovskiy sector, was shelled with rockets for over 40 
minutes on February 21. 
  The eighth border post, Pyandzh River sector, was shelled 
from trench mortars on the night of February 18. As a result, 
one Russian guard was killed. There are enough facts indicating 
that similar provocations are being hatched at other sections of 
the Tajik-Afghan border. 
  Taking into account the fact that Afghan authorities have no 
real possibilities to control and prevent these piratic actions 
and mindful of repeated statements made by the Tajik Government 
on its right to take resolute retaliatory measures, I must say 
that all weapons opening fire across the border will be 
immediately destroyed in future with the use of all types of 
arms in the possession of border troops. 
  The statement stresses that field commanders of Afghan 
Mujahideen can understand possible consequences of such 
artillery duels which will only add privations and sufferings to 
the defenceless population of Afghan border regions. 
  The general expressed hope that the well-being of their 
fellow countrymen is worth of bridling the presumptuous 
chieftains of Tajik armed opposition who do not give a farthing 
for the life of Afghan citizens providing shelter to them. 
  "I hope for mutual understanding from leaders caring for 
their people and am ready to conduct a dialogue within my 
competence at all levels," the statement concludes.

  [Text] Dushanbe February 25 TASS -- The Tajik Foreign 
Ministry has bluntly denied recent reports, appearing in the 
foreign press with references to the "International Amnesty" 
human rights organisation, that there are secret concentration 
camps on the territory of the republic. 
  Tajik Foreign Ministry's Department Chief Zafar Saidov told 
a 
briefing here today that not a single official representative of 
the foregoing human rights organisation had addressed such 
information to the Tajik Foreign Ministry or other state bodies 
over the past six months. 
  "The leadership of Tajikistan," the diplomat said, "have 
asked representatives of the mission of permanent U.N. 
observers, currently visiting the republic, to undertake a 
fact-finding trip to the spots, where these concentration camps 
are allegedly located, and to carry out the most careful 
investigation." 
  "For its part," Saidov stressed, "the Tajik leadership, 
which 
has always honoured all the international human rights acts and 
which is now busy building a democratic law-government state, 
believes that no goals can justify the use of tortures, physical 
violence and other actions humiliating human dignity, about 
which the foreign mass media have reported.

  [Text] Dushanbe February 25 TASS -- The Presidium of the 
Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan issued a decree on Friday on the 
regulation of television and radio broadcasting in Tajikistan. 
The two industries are now forbidden to use tv or radio time to 
propagandize or advertise erotic publications or alcoholic or 
tobacco products. They also may not broadcast programmes which 
conflict with the republic's national traditions or human moral 
norms. 
  In addition, until the adoption of a law on television and 
radio broadcasting, the draft of which is as yet only supposed 
to be worked out and discussed by the Supreme Soviet, the all 
television and radio studios which are not under state control 
are to be closed down and their wave lengths taken away 
throughout the entire Republic of Tajikistan. 
  It was emphasized that the decree was adopted in accordance 
with many requests received from the population of Tajikistan.

  [Text] Vienna -- When the topic of human rights was 
broached during his visit to Vienna, Qiao Shi, president of 
China's parliament, referred to his country's history. 
  Even if human rights violations are painful, the dialogue 
must be continued, Parliament President Heinz Fischer stated 
after his meeting with Chinese Parliament President Qiao Shi. 
After a four-day visit to Germany and Switzerland, which was 
accompanied by protests, he arrived in Austria with a delegation 
of parliament deputies. Asked about the human rights situation 
and Tibet, Qiao Shi referred to China's history and the great 
significance of the preservation of political stability. 
Replying to Fischer's request to consider banning the death 
penalty, Qiao Shi stated that China is not yet ready for a 
renunciation of this type of punishment. 
  Marijana Grandits, foreign-policy spokeswoman for the 
Greens, 
described Qiao as "one of the most sinister figures of China's 
political landscape." If Austria does not oppose vehemently the 
systematic human rights violations, this means continuing the 
tradition of ignorant and opportunist policies. Exiled Tibetans 
demonstrated in front of the Chancellor's Office in 
Ballhausplatz.

President's Office. Reportedly, Qiao reaffirmed China's point of 
view that Tibet has always been part of Chinese territory. 
  In the parliament Qiao Shi had also affirmed that Tibet 
belongs to his country and declared that the Catholic Church is 
protected fully in the PRC. In a talk with members of the 
Bundesrat Presidium, the member of the CPC Political Bureau 
stated that the only condition for the Dalai Lama's return is 
his renunciation of Tibet's independence.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The President Received"] </F>
  [Text] On Friday [28 January] President Thomas Klestil 
received Qiao Shi, president of the Standing Committee of the 
PRC National People's Congress, who was accompanied by a 
high-ranking delegation from Beijing. In the presence of 
Nationalrat President Heinz Fischer, the Austrian president and 
the Chinese parliamentary president held a talk, lasting about 
one hour, discussing the developments in the Asian area and on 
the territory of the former Soviet Union as well as bilateral 
relations. The president also expressed Western concerns in 
connection with the human rights situation in China and with the 
situation in Tibet. In his answer, President Qiao Shi expressed 
the conviction that the different assessments of the human 
rights issues can be explained primarily by the differences 
between the history and traditions in Europe and those of the 
Chinese people. Tibet has always been part of the Chinese 
territory, but the government in Beijing is willing to 
"negotiate about all issues" with the Dalai Lama -- "with the 
exception of Tibet's independence." The Dalai Lama, with whom 
there have been indirect contacts, is, however, not willing to 
do so. The Austrian president and his guest extensively 
discussed the instability in the successor states of the Soviet 
Union, which, in the Chinese view, has developed mainly because 
political and economic reforms "are not synchronous" and that 
additional hotbeds of danger have arisen from the great number 
of ethnic conflicts. 
  The president of the Chinese parliamen, who also was asked 
by 
the Austrian president about the topical discussion about North 
Korea's nuclear potential, expressed satisfaction about the 
initiation of talks between the North Korean Government and the 
United States -- obviously, progress has been made there. 
China's central position is the desire for stability in 
Southeast Asia. Thus, the process of reunification between the 
two parts of Korea and between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan 
must be achieved in peace and not by war or tensions. Beijing 
is trying to make rapprochement easier through direct airline, 
post, and trade contacts with Taiwan. President Qiao Shi also 
reported on the state of affairs and the problems in the process 
of Hong Kong's reintegration in the PRC. It is Beijing's firm 
will to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of the 
current British crown colony along the principle of "one 
country, two systems." Both sides emphatically stressed the 
desire for even closer economic cooperation, which has been put 
on a new basis as a result of Chancellor Vranitzky's visit to 
China. According to the Chinese guest, Austria is "a country 
that we can take as a model." In this connection, the president 
of the parliament renewed the invitation to the Austrian 
president to visit the PRC and conveyed personal greetings from 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.

<F P=106> [SALZBURGER NACHRICHTEN report: "EU Enlargement, Then East </F>
Europe"] 
  [Excerpt] Vienna -- The European Union [EU] is envisaging 
the extension of the Community to East Europe more and more 
clearly. EU Commission President Jacques Delors stated in 
Brussels on Friday [28 January] that the work of his authority 
will focus on a concept for a "greater Europe." 
  These considerations also played a role at the 
Austrian-French forum that was held in the Vienna Town Hall on 
Friday at the invitation of Foreign Minister Mock and the City 
of Vienna. There Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European 
affairs, summarized the stage plan in the direction of 
pan-Europe: First the EU has to be increased to 16 members, so 
that Austria also belongs to it. Then four steps must follow: 
First, implementation of the Maastricht resolutions on foreign 
and security policy; second, subsidiarity; third, 
democratization; fourth, gradual integration of Central and East 
Europe. "We need a policy for the East," Lamassoure said. 
  He wants to start the EU's policy for the East with an 
"engagement day," that is, a basic offer to the East European 
states that permits them to become members of the Community. 
This policy must be extended to Russia. In the transition 
period there will be a security problem, with which Austria will 
cope best by acceding to the Western European Union (WEU), 
toward which the East European states are also pushing their 
way. Everything else would be paradoxical, he said. [passage

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by </F>
Robert Stoppacher; place and date not given--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Stoppacher] The protests did not yield the 
desired effect. The Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech 
Republic near the Austrian border will be completed. This has 
become possible because of a decision by the U.S. state bank 
promoting exports, which has guaranteed a loan of about 4 
billion schillings to ensure the completion of this giant Czech 
nuclear power station. The money will be used also to equip 
Soviet-type reactors with Western safety technology. The 
decision by the U.S. bank did not come as a surprise, even 
though many Austrian politicians and environmental organizations 
tried to prevent these U.S. credits. 
  Austrian officials reacted in the following way: Chancellor 
Franz Vranitzky has been sobered by the fact that efforts to 
prevent the completion of the Temelin nuclear power station have 
failed for the time being. Still, he is not discouraged. The 
chancellor pointed out that the credit still has to be approved 
by the U.S. Senate. 
  [Vranitzky] We will take all possible political measures to 
achieve a change of heart in the U.S. Senate and to initiate a 
new discussion. 
  [Stoppacher] What possibilities do you see? Some of your 
government's ministers contacted U.S. authorities in the past. 
Yet they did not achieve anything. 
  [Vranitzky] You are quite right. We have undertaken a great 
deal. Ministers, members of parliament, and provincial 
politicians launched initiatives. I myself drafted 
comprehensive statements and intervened in other ways. The 
opportunity of bringing about a change of heart in the United 
States is to be considered very slim. One must say that, if 
Temelin is completed, Austria's and my own efforts will not have 
led to the desired goal. 
  [Stoppacher] Do you see other possibilities, apart from 
talking with U.S. senators and trying to convince them? 
  [Vranitzky] I see only a limited number of possibilities 
because, by guaranteeing the credit, the U.S. Administration is 
primarily supporting a U.S. supplier during difficult economic 
times. One can imagine that the U.S. industry is presenting very 
convincing arguments in favor of this project. [passage omitted]

Vienna-Hernals is said to have smuggled 80 to 100 kg of the 
"Tscharas" type of the drug from India to Austria in the past 
eight years. The man is currently in India. Alfred H. (37) and 
Wilhelm B. (38) from Vienna-Fuenfhaus were imprisoned. It is 
assumed that they distributed the drugs. 
  During a search of Wilhelm B.'s apartment, 2,850 grams of 
cannabis resin were seized. Alfred H. is suspected of having 
sold heroin daily to between five and seven for several 
distributors in 1992 and 1993. [passage omitted]

  [Text] And we start with some more news in the Agusta 
bribery scandal. 
  The Walloon Socialist senator Guy Mathot, who was one of the 
three ministers accused of being involved in the bribery, has 
revealed a document in which the present foreign affairs 
minister, Willy Claes, was mentioned. 
  At the time of the Agusta deal Claes was minister of 
economic 
affairs. The document says that five years ago the minister had 
a meeting with the dismissed Agusta manager, Rafael Otetti. The 
meeting is said to have taken place in January 1989. On that 
date, Otteti had just been removed as president of the board of 
directors of Agusta. Meanwile, the man is on the run in South 
America. 
  One day after the meeting with Minister Claes a new Agusta 
president was appointed. 
  Senator Guy Mathot also denies the incriminating statement 
of 
the former Liege (?unionist) [name indistinct]. A few days ago 
[name indistinct] said the relationship between Guy Mathot and 
the murdered Walloon Socialist leader Andre Cools had reached an 
absolute low after the controversial Agusta contract was signed. 
Mathot now says this is untrue. The murder of Andre Cools is 
said to be linked to the Agusta bribery scandal. 
  Meanwhile, the commission of the Walloon region, in its 
turn, 
has proposed to lift partially the parliamentary immunity of Guy 
Mathot, Guy Spitaels, and Alain Von den Beest. The Senate has 
already done so for Mathot and Spitaels.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday, Guy Mathot showed journalists a 
document from Ancia's file, which is very incriminating to 
Minister Willy Claes (Socialist Party). The document allegedly 
proves that on the second Sunday of January 1989, Agusta 
Chairman Otetti met with Claes, economic affairs minister at the 
time, to discuss the helicopter compensations. 
  The remarkable thing is that Otetti had already been fired

chairman of the Board of Directors by Agusta that day. At 
present, he is on the run somewhere in South America, probably 
in Brazil. It is only the next day that d'Allessandro was 
appointed as Agusta's new chairman. 
  The document in which this meeting between Claes and Otetti 
was mentioned for the first time, is a statement by Agusta 
manager Baldini, heard by Ancia early last year in the Italian 
city of Firenze. So far, the document has not been transmitted 
to the Chamber and Senate committees which had to decide on the 
lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Come, Spitaels, and 
Mathot. However, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Liege did 
transmit the document to Guy Mathot's lawyers. The latter used 
the document for the first time last Tuesday [18 January], 
during a hearing of the committee in the Walloon Regional 
Council. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene by Martine </F>
Dubuisson, Thierry Evens, and Jean-Pierre Stroobants; place and 
date not given: "Agusta, One More Reason To Last"--first 
paragraph is LE SOIR introduction] 
  [Text] The Agusta scandal has occupied the front of the 
political stage for several weeks. It has threatened directly 
the government. The prime minister now clearly wants to revive 
the mechanism of a reshuffled team, not by refusing to forget 
the "scandal" but by trying to show that ministerial work must 
continue. 
  [Dehaene] With regard to the Agusta scandal, it is a good 
thing that matters have been clarified by drawing a distinction 
between government policy and the handling of "scandals." And 
that those whose names have been mentioned should be free to 
defend themselves. I do not want to trivialize these events. 
This issue must be cleared up, like the Andre Cools murder, and 
any other scandal which breaks out in the future. I therefore 
insist that the legal authorities be allowed to act, according 
to their rules, on this issue and on any others that arise. 
  [LE SOIR] The Agusta scandal has shown the need for some 
reforms. Will you propose them? 
  [Dehaene] Discussions were already under way on party 
funding, the limitation of election spending, ensuring the 
objectivity of nominations, or the establishment of an ombudsman 
in public enterprises or Parliament. What has happened has 
served as a catalyst. 
  The issues on which parliamentary groups and parties will 
have to take the initiative -- namely immunity, the status of 
deputies, and funding -- should be distinguished from those 
which relate to the state apparatus and are the government's 
responsibility: ministerial responsibility, the control of 
public appropriations, recruitment and promotion in the 
magistrature and civil service. 
  [LE SOIR] Are you not afraid that other scandals will 
emerge, 
as they have in Italy? 
  [Dehaene] First, let us not make too hasty a comparison with 
Italy. Second, if other scandals emerge, they will have to be 
clarified. Third, if they are the result of vengeance, that is 
dangerous. 
  [LE SOIR] Do you share the view of those who talk of 
different ethics in the north and the south? Those who think 
that the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party] is a sicker party 
than the others? 
  [Dehaene] Public opinions and voters are different. The 
parties, politicians, and media often reflect that. That may 
create different sensitivities. But I do not think there are 
fundamentally opposite approaches. In other, previous cases, 
questions were asked, in the north and the south, about the 
resignation of certain people.... 
  [LE SOIR] What do you think of the defense adopted by Guy 
Coeme? 
  [Dehaene] I will not express an opinion or a judgment on the 
aspect of this case under jurisdiction. 
  [LE SOIR] Guy Coeme has criticized the "excessive media 
coverage" and "over-politicization" of the issue. Do you agree? 
  [Dehaene] The system of parliamentary immunity and Article 
90 
must be reviewed because, in view of the media coverage, what 
was originally a protection has turned into a system under which 
the politician is tried twice. It is up to Parliament to draw 
the necessary conclusions. 
  [LE SOIR] Nonetheless you called for the creation of a 
financial, social, and fiscal status for the deputy.... 
  [Dehaene] It is one thing to say what is a desirable reform. 
Giving a verdict on how to implement it is a different matter. 
As a deputy, I will say what I think about it within my party. 
But that is not the prime minister's role. 
  [LE SOIR] At one time, the PS said that you too had met 
with Agusta envoys. Did that annoy you? 
  [Dehaene] I note that, susequently Mr. Spitaels issued a 
communique explaining that he had not intended to implicate 
other people. As for the decision on the Agusta issue, I 
participated in it as a government member. I have shouldered my 
responsibilities. At the time there were contacts between the 
different candidates and my office. A distinction must be drawn 
between the licit and illicit aspects of the issue. 
  I have been involved in other cases of public 
appropriations: 
At the time of the RTT [Telegraph and Telephone Administration] 
contract, we were subjected to lobbying from all sides. The 
RTT's interests seemed secondary to the effects on Flanders or 
Wallonia. I therefore say that the issue of appropriations 
should be dealt with according to the principle of the best 
relationship between quality and price and not in accordance 
with which enterprises need investments. Indirect compensation, 
which is often dubious, must therefore be abandoned. On the 
other hand, direct compensation can be useful if it does not 
affect the price. 
  [LE SOIR] Last week, did you pass on the view of the CVP 
[Christian People's Party] deputies who thought that Guy Coeme 
should resign? Did you take that action? 
  [Dehaene] I am abiding strictly by the reply I gave in 
Parliament, each word of which was carefully considered. 
  [LE SOIR] Coeme says that his resignation was a personal 
decision. But it came several hours after a conversation which 
you had with the PS president. Was that meeting not the 
decisive factor? 
  [Dehaene] No. 
  [LE SOIR] Has the government now been weakened? 
  [Dehaene] It is a good thing for the government program that 
the PS has appointed new ministers. But I certainly do not rule 
out the fact that the process of the Agusta scandal or the 
emergence of other issues could have an influence on the 
government or the pursuit of its policy at a given time. At 
present, the two spheres are clearly separate. During my 
meeting with the presidents of the majority parties, all clearly 
expressed their desire to see this issue resolved and their 
desire to pursue government action until the end of the 
parliamentary term. 
  [LE SOIR] Do you agree with Gerard Deprez? He does not rule 
out the possibility of the government's unity being undermined? 
  [Dehaene] His remarks speak for themselves! It is one thing 
to say: For the time being matters have been clarified and the 
government is in a good position to pursue its policy; saying 
that the development of the Agusta scandal or the emergence of 
other scandals will have no influence on the coalition is a 
different matter. You would have to be naive to think that! 
  [LE SOIR] Was it necessary to give guarantees to the PS for 
it to remain in power? 
  [Dehaene] No. Not other than to express our determination to 
carry on to the end of the parliamentary term, which is natural. 
Philippe Busquin clearly took account of the other parties' 
desire to complete the parliamentary term. Moreover, this is in 
the interests of the PS and the other parties, because the 
government had a threefold objective: The reform of the state 
virtually has been completed, the overall plan has been drawn up 
and must be implemented in all its dimensions, and, finally, the 
contract with the citizen must be highlighted and given greater 
prominence and this implies reforms which take longer. After 
two years of preparatory work in several spheres, we can adopt 
bills and start to implement them on the ground. 
  [LE SOIR] The Flemish liberals continue to level very harsh 
criticisms at you. What is your answer to them? 
  [Dehaene] Those who think they will extricate themselves by 
exploiting the antipolitical climate are merely strengthening 
that phenomenon.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain, by </F>
Jacques Hislaire; place and date not given: "`Nothing 
Provisional' Says Robert Urbain"--first paragraph is LA LIBRE 
BELGIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] Foreign Trade and European Affairs Minister Robert 
Urbain has returned from a limited 12-day political and economic 
mission which took him successively to Qatar, Pakistan, and 
Syria (we will return to this subject in Saturday's LIBRE Propos 
section and the Business section of the following Saturday). He 
followed the crisis and reshuffle from Doha, Islamabad, Lahore 
and Damascus by telephoning President Busquin and his advisers 
every day. They also sent him a daily press review. He gave us 
an interview before his departure from Damascus. 
  [Hislaire] Are you satisfied by the reshuffle? 
  [Urbain] Yes, in so far as I am still combining 
responsibility for Foreign Trade and European Affairs at the 
federal level. Combining the two ministries has definite 
advantages, because Belgium embodies Europe for most of the 
countries I visited. That is also why I met the amir of Qatar 
and the president of Pakistan. And if his son had not died 
accidentally a few days earlier, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
would have received me also. 
  [Hislaire] Could such a role be carried out by a foreign 
trade minister representing Wallonia or Flanders? 
  [Urbain] I do not think so. Someone said to me that he knew 
Belgium well because it is next to France. People can locate 
our country, but they cannot locate our regions yet. A federal 
foreign trade minister is indispensable for the macroeconomic 
approach to bilateral trade, in order to provide support to 
export companies. 
  [Hislaire] Were you disappointed not to be asked to succeed 
Come as deputy prime minister? 
  [Urbain] No. I am not disappointed at all because I asked 
for nothing. The reshuffle unites experience with the fresh 
energy that others are contributing. It is neither provisional 
nor transitional, although the three "Guys" are not definitively 
excluded from participating in government later. 
  [Hislaire] And the crisis within your party? 
  [Urbain] That is an excessive assessment. There has been no 
split within the national committee of the PS [French-speaking 
Socialist Party]. It is true that there is a malaise in public 
opinion, which would like to know what is true or false in the 
accusations made both by the investigating magistrate and by the 
rumors or witnesses. I share this feeling. The truth must 
emerge as quickly as possible in a totally transparent way. The 
guilty -- if there are any -- must be prosecuted without 
indulgence. Beyond the Agusta affair -- it would be wrong to 
forget this -- lies the death of a man, Andr Cools.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Engels: "The Army Wants To Rechristen </F>
Itself `Efficiency' -- An Important Year for its Restructuring"] 
  [Excerpt] The policy governing military purchases will be 
made more transparent, proclaims Defense Minister Leo Delcroix, 
refraining from making any "opportunist" statements. 
  Yesterday, CVP [Flemish Christian People's Party] Defense 
Minister Leo Delcroix presented his mid-term assessment, 
commenting in passing on his plans for the current year. "This 
will be the year when things really happen," he anticipated. 
"The year during which the decisions on restructuring will be 
implemented on the ground." Here Delcroix was referring to the 
continuation of the Army reform process to which the government 
gave a "green light" in January 1993. On the ground, this will 
primarily entail repatriation from Germany of all units deployed 
east of the Rhine (13,000 soldiers, including 3,200 
professionals); in 1994, explained Minister Delcroix, no more 
than 18,000 Belgians would remain in Germany, as against 48,000 
in 1990. These movements have major socioeconomic implications. 
Initially, the Defense Ministry had decided to build 250 homes, 
at little cost (because they would in many cases be located on 
military sites -- L'ECHO editor's note). Assuredly this number 
will be insufficient. 
  As for the subject of personnel problems -- an item which 
"eats up" 60 percent of the ministry's annual department -- the 
former national secretary of the CVP has promised to pay special 
attention to this. Being henceforth constrained to "follow" the 
labor market with a view to lowering the average age of 
officers, the Army will also adopt a policy of outplacement in 
order to avoid "difficult situations" as far as possible. 
Finally, 1994 will mark the arrival of the first short-term 
volunteers, while the government has also just come out in favor 
of employing military personnel outside the Army. 
<H5>  A Budget To Be Earned </H5>
  The speech by the successor of...Guy Coeme displays the 
desire to manage a compressed budget as best he can. "The Army 
must earn its budget," said Delcroix. Remember, one of the 
first measures taken by the Dehaene government in the spring of 
1992, was to decree a freeze in nominal terms of the national 
defense budget for the entire period covered by the convergence 
plan. In a nutshell, this means that the "envelope" would 
remain at its ceiling of 98 billion Belgian francs [BFr] until 
1997, which implies a progressive reduction in real terms (due 
to inflation -- L'ECHO editor's note). 
  In order to gain freedom of movement within this tight 
"corset," Leo Delcroix is expecting to make plenty of money from 
the sale of military equipment and buildings, which began in 
1993 and should give him some breathing space. Over the period 
in which the Army will be restructured, i.e. until 1997, a total 
amount of BFr3.6 billion had been budgeted as profit from such 
sales. "However, it may turn out to be more," is the message 
being whispered in the Ministry of Defense. 
  Nonetheless, until now, the balance from these sales 
transactions is hardly brilliant, and is not yet giving cause 
for optimism. In terms of "light equipment," since last May 
public sales, which take place every two months in 
Neder-over-Heembeek, have yielded BFr250 million. However, for 
"heavy equipment," where the purchasers are nations, the balance 
is zero. The sales procedure (especially regarding aircraft) is 
long and tedious, requiring approval by the foreign minister 
and, possibly, by his colleague, the minister for economic 
affairs...or by the manufacturer. The most problematic 
transaction, it would seem, concerns "surplus" (more than 80) 
F-16's, which are in direct competition with the armada of 600 
similar machines that the United States is looking to sell (and 
where the U.S. manufacturer has a right of inspection of sales 
by our country! -- L'ECHO editor's note). 
  Nonetheless, some dossiers, it is claimed, have progressed, 
and the first effects of this should make themselves felt in the 
very near future (the three minehunters and 60 Mirage fighters 
are apparently arousing some interest). 
  Finally there remains the profit from sales of military 
sites. Those whose reallocation does not pose a problem, brought 
in a mere BFr15 million in 1993. However, the serious business 
should get off the ground this year. In order to be able to 
sell the buildings in question, and above all to gain price 
estimates, the regions have been asked to launch the procedure 
which would allocate these sites a specific function, depending 
on their sectoral plans. Details are expected to trickle in 
over the next few months. 
<H5>  The Shadow of Guy Coeme </H5>
  These sales of equipment and sites are important...for they 
will determine the government's policy on purchases. Last July, 
the government approved the "medium-term investment plan" (PMT) 
proposed by its Ministry of Defense. This plan fixes the limit 
on purchases that can be made over the years to come with a view 
to modernizing the Army. As Minister Delcroix pointed out, the 
main priorities of the PMT are modernization of the 48 F-16's 
(that are being retained), purchase of 250 trucks for the Army, 
and construction of four minesweepers for the Navy. 
  A second list of lower priority investments in 
infrastructure 
is subject to certain conditions. Its consideration and the 
effective realization of the "urgent" list depend on the 
budgetary resources and, consequently, on the result of the 
sales. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Hugh Davies report: "Gerry Adams Gets U.S. Visa"] </F>
  [Text] New York -- The United States has granted Mr Gerry 
Adams, the Sinn Fein president, a visa to attend a conference on 
Northern Ireland in New York tomorrow in a move expected to 
enrage the Government. 
  He is being allowed to stay 48 hours in Manhattan, but is 
forbidden to venture beyond a 25-mile radius of New York. 
  Mr Adams is also banned from engaging in any "direct or 
indirect" fundraising for the IRA. Huge security is expected 
for the visit. 
  A White House statement said the decision represented the 
administration's effort to "support this important peace 
process." Assurances had been sought from Mr Adams that he would 
renounce violence and support the joint declaration. 
  The IRA gets its money through NORAID in America. The 
organisation said: "The announcement means that the long 
censorship by visa denial has been broken." 
  White House advisers to President Clinton apparently 
overruled State Department hawks who persuaded him to stop Mr 
Adams visiting Manhattan last year because of his suspected 
direct involvement in IRA operations. 
  Mr Adams has been banned for 20 years and it was the 
persuasive power of two Democratic Irish-American politicians -- 
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Senator Edward Kennedy -- 
that swayed Mr Clinton. 
  The pair joined 38 other politicians to urge Mr Clinton to 
reverse his opposition, arguing that the Sinn Fein leader's 
appearance at a critical juncture of the peace process could 
help by easing Sinn Fein into the mainstream and showing IRA 
hard-liners that there is credibility to be gained through 
negotiation. 
  Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, has also 
been invited to the conference, organised by the National 
Committee on American Foreign Policy, but said that if Mr Adams 
attends he will stay in Belfast. 
  Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, Mr James Molyneaux, the 
Unionist leader, and Dr John Alderdice of the Alliance Party are 
also invited. 
  Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, 
condemned the visa decision as "despicable" and accused the 
Clinton administration of giving in to Washington's Irish lobby.

<F P=106> [By Ian Graham, Michael Harvey and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS </F>
ASSOCIATION] 
  [Excerpts] The United States has granted Sinn Fein 
president Gerry Adams a visa to attend a New York conference 
this week on Northern Ireland, the White House announced tonight. 
  The news outraged Ulster Unionist politicians, who accused 
President Clinton of an about-turn on his administration's 
previous demand that Mr Adams should publicly renounce violence 
and back the Anglo-Irish peace declaration before being admitted. 
  But a statement from the White House said: "The President 
supports this difficult decision and believes it will help 
advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland." 
  Mr Adams will be allowed to stay only 48 hours, will be 
barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New York and from 
engaging in "direct or indirect fund raising" during his visit 
for Tuesday's [1 February] conference, the White House said. 
  For the past 20 years the Sinn Fein president has been 
barred 
from entering America despite numerous efforts to gain a visa. 
He applied at the American embassy in Dublin on January 14 for 
the visa to attend the conference organised by the National 
Committee on American Foreign Policy. The honorary chairman of 
the committee is former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 
and all sides have been invited to attend the one-day 
conference. But Unionist politicians have declined the 
invitation, and tonight Ulster Unionist MP John D Taylor 
condemned the U.S. decision as "despicable," saying the Clinton 
administration had "given in" to pressure from the Irish lobby 
in Washington. 
  "The White House now wishes to facilitate the apologists for 
the IRA murder campaign in Ireland," the MP for Strangford 
declared. 
  "The people of Northern Ireland say to Clinton: `You should 
be ashamed of yourself -- no longer can you condemn terrorism 
elsewhere in the free world.'" 
  Mr Adams told reporters tonight that the object of his visit 
was not merely to brief Irish supporters on the status of 
current peace moves but to collect the views of Irish 
expatriates. 
  The U.S. administration admitted it consulted the British 
and 
Irish Governments while considering the application. 
  London, which has an exclusion order preventing Mr Adams 
from 
entering mainland Britain, argued the ban should remain. 
  The Irish government made no public comment but is 
understood 
to have urged in private that the visa be granted. The Dublin 
view prevailed. [passage omitted] 
  Mr Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said tonight 
it appeared the U.S. Government had "watered down considerably" 
its requirement for the Sinn Fein president to renounce violence. 
  "I think it is disappointing that the Americans have 
capitulated on something which for them should have been a 
matter of principle," he said, adding: "I think it diminishes Mr 
Clinton." 
  Mr Maginnis also said the conference would be undermined if 
it was felt more important to have the presence of "an advocate 
of terrorism" rather than representatives of the greater number 
of people in Northern Ireland. [passage omitted] 
  Mr Taylor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I think it's 
obscene. I think the White House has lost all moral authority 
and cannot condemn terrorism elsewhere in the world while they 
facilitate someone like Gerry Adams." 
  Mr Alderdice [Alliance Party leader] told the programme: 
"Clearly I am disappointed. There has been an enormous amount 
of Republican and Irish nationalist pressure on Mr Clinton to 
make this decision." 
  Mr Alderdice, who is in the U.S., added: "I'm going to put 
forward the views of the majority of the people in Northern 
Ireland who don't want to see the violence and regard the whole 
position of Mr Adams as highly repugnant." 
  Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist Party MP for Belfast 
East, said: "Now the people of Northern Ireland will see that 
democracy counts for nothing. 
  "If you are a gunman then there are people who want to hear 
you. There are people who will roll out the carpet for you. But 
if you are a simple democrat who abides by the ballot box then 
nobody wants to hear you." 
  Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, told 
the 
programme he was surprised the U.S. had granted Mr Adams a visa 
in advance of reaching agreement over the joint declaration. 
  "It is exactly what Adams wants. He wants to go on being 
able to procrastinate in order to put pressure on both 
governments to make some more concessions before the killing 
stops," he said. 
  Joe Hendron, SDLP MP for West Belfast, told the programme Mr 
Adams was having problems getting agreement to the declaration 
among the republican movement. 
  "If getting a visa to participate in this so-called 
high-powered discussion in the U.S., if this helps Mr Adams in 
terms of his credibility amongst his own peers, his own 
followers, then that can only be a good thing," he said. 
  Democratic Unionist Party leader the Rev Ian Paisley 
accused the U.S. administration of "kowtowing" to the Boston 
Irish Lobby and going back on previous decisions. 
  He said of Gerry Adams: "He might declare a very short 
ceasefire which will be hailed as a tremendous breakthrough. 
  "This is a propaganda exercise. It is telling against the 
British Government because the British Government are losing 
every round of the battle." 
  President Clinton had no authority in Northern Ireland, Mr 
Paisley told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, adding: "He should 
clean up the mess in his own back yard without interfering in 
Northern Ireland."

<F P=106> [George Jones and Sonia Purnell article: "State Accused of </F>
Wasting Millions"] 
  [Text] Mr Major was forced further on to the defensive 
over standards in public life yesterday by the publication of a 
report cataloguing the waste of hundreds of millions of pounds 
of taxpayers' money. The unprecedented report from the Public 
Accounts Committee said recent failings represented a departure 
from the "standards of public conduct" established during the 
past 140 years. 
  During heated exchanges in the Commons, Mr Major denied 
there 
had been any decline in standards, while Mr Smith the Labour 
leader described the report as a "devastating catalogue of 
incompetence, mismanagement and waste of public money." 
  The all-party committee of MPs outlined 26 cases of 
financial 
failures and mismanagement in Whitehall departments and official 
quangos [quasiautonomous national government organization]. 
  These ranged from inadequate financial controls in the 
Foreign Office in 1989 which created a climate "conducive to 
fraud and theft," to the expenditure by Wessex Regional Health 
Authority of up to 1 million pounds more than necessary on a 
computer. 
  It was the first time the committee -- a watchdog on 
Government spending -- has published such a report in its 
133-year history. It was compiled against a background of 
radical reform in the National Health Service and other public 
bodies, with officials under increasing pressure to adopt a more 
businesslike approach to the provision of services. 
  The committee's criticisms have intensified Mr Major's 
difficulties in restoring the Government's reputation after a 
series of political and financial scandals involving Tory 
politicians and the disclosures of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry 
into the arms-for-Iraq affair. 
  Earlier this week the crossparty Commons Foreign Affairs 
Committee decided to investigate the award of 234 million pounds 
of Government aid to the Pergau dam project in Malaysia against 
the advice of senior civil servants . 
  Mr Major will underline the Government's commitment to high 
standards of public life in a keynote speech tonight setting out 
his priorities for the coming year. But there is concern that 
the report will give the Labour leadership valuable ammunition 
in its campaign to highlight governmental "sleaze" and broken 
election promises on taxation. 
  There was laughter from Labour MPs when Mr Major said he 
welcomed the report because it provided a "useful checklist" to 
help public bodies to avoid wasting money in future . 
  He denied there had been a decline in standards, and was 
visibly annoyed when Mr Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said 
people were being asked to pay unprecedented levels of taxation 
only to see the Government and quangos throw money away on 
"waste corruption and fraud." 
  Thumping his notes down on the Dispatch Box, Mr Major 
challenged Mr Ashdown to substantiate his allegations . 
  Earlier, Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton under Lyne 
and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the 
situation they had uncovered was getting worse. 
  The gravity of the report was underlined by a Conservative 
committee member, Mr Richard Page, who said it should not be a 
party political issue. "Because there have been frauds, because 
there have been misdemeanors, this is a clear shot across the 
bows for every Government department and every Government 
agency," he said. 
  Labour MPs immediately., seized on the report to attack 
Government reforms. Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's spokesman on 
the public services, blamed the failings on bringing outsiders 
into public office and the prevalent "business culture and 
political climate of greed and self-interest." 
  Mr Waldegrave, the minister responsible for public services, 
acknowledged the report had shown up some "very bad examples." 
But he said the committee did not believe there was a 
contradiction between the Government's changes and the 
maintenance of proper standards. 
  It said: "Some allege that the drive for economy and 
efficiency must be held back to some extent because of the need 
to take specific care with public money. Others argue that if 
economy and efficiency are to be forcibly pursued, then 
traditional standards must be relaxed. We firmly reject both 
claims." 
  The report noted that sweeping reforms of the Civil Service, 
intended to improve efficiency through greater delegation and a 
more entrepreneurial approach, had been accompanied by serious 
failures in financial and administrative control and 
accountability, as well as a collapse in traditional public 
sector values. 
  "Apart from the important moral and other aspects involved, 
we consider that any failure to respect and care for public 
money would be a most important cause of a decline in the 
efficiency of public business," it said. 
  At a time of great change honesty should not be neglected in 
the effort to maximise economy and efficiency. It demanded 
effective systems of control and accountability and "above all 
responsible attitudes on the part of those handling money." 
  It called for the National Audit Office's powers to be 
extended to enable it to examine all bodies that received most 
of their income from public funds. 
  The report includes a checklist of procedures for Government 
departments, including systematic checking of bills; making sure 
no ex gratia payments are made to staff who should have been 
dismissed; tighter rules on the provision of cars; ensuring 
effective personal accountability; avoiding conflicts of 
interest in awarding contracts; regular assessment of 
expenditure programmes and greater openness.

<F P=106> [By Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams tonight offered fresh 
hope for peace in Northern Ireland. 
  Just hours after the Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick 
Mayhew said he believed there could still be a positive response 
by the provisionals to the Downing Street declaration, the man 
who leads the political wing of the IRA said he was prepared to 
go "the extra mile." 
  An end to the violence was now his personal and political 
priority and he added: "I am willing to seek to persuade the IRA 
to make a definitive decision on the conduct of its campaign." 
  Earlier at an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting in Dublin Sir 
Patrick said there was still a chance of peace. 
  He said: "We believe we may yet see a positive response from 
the provisionals. There are rational grounds for hope because 
it is so much the will of, and the demand of the people of this 
island." 
  Although Mr Adams did not renounce the use of IRA violence 
-- 
the White House has sought that assurance before the State 
Department allows him in to America to attend a major conference 
in New York on Tuesday [1 February] -- the tone of his remarks 
tonight were the most conciliatory since Mr Major and the 
Republic's premier Mr Albert Reynolds signed the historic peace 
initiative six weeks ago. 
  Mr Adams said: "I want to see an end to all violence and an 
end to this conflict. I do not advocate violence. It is my 
personal and political priority to see an end of the IRA and an 
end to other organisations involved in armed actions. 
  "This means an end to the British Army presence and the 
disbandment of the IRA. It means an end to Loyalist death 
squads. In other words a demilitarisation of the situation. 
  "I am willing to seek to persuade the IRA to make a 
definitive decision on the conduct of its campaign. 
  "I have said on a number of occasions my willingness to go 
to 
the IRA with a proposition when such a proposition is 
forthcoming from the peace process." 
  Pressure on Sinn Fein mounted today when the U.S. government 
effectively refused party president Adams his visa. 
  A statement in Washington said the White House would only 
consider his application if he publicly renounced violence and 
threw his support behind the Downing Street declaration. 
  At the same time, the first of four Sinn Fein "peace 
commission" hearings to gauge reaction to the London-Dublin 
statement within the republican movement was being held in 
Londonderry. 
  Sir Patrick -- speaking after a meeting in Dublin of the 
Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference -- 
also appeared to offer greater scope than before for 
clarification for the republicans of the December 15 document 
signed by Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart 
Albert Reynolds. 
  Sir Patrick claimed that a letter sent by Mr Adams to Mr 
Major amounted to a request for negotiation rather than 
clarification. 
  He emphasised: "We will continue to make clear what the 
document does and does not do. We continue to make speeches 
that do just that. 
  "I do not believe there is anything between the two 
governments on this and I certainly don't wish to see anybody 
under any genuine misapprehension as to what the declaration 
says. 
  "What I am not prepared to do is to negotiate. I am not 
prepared to unravel something that has taken as long as this has 
to put together, and which is very clear and comprehensive." 
  The conference meeting, initially set to end early this 
afternoon, went on for more than six hours. 
  In a joint statement afterwards, Sir Patrick and joint 
chairman Dick Spring, Ireland's deputy premier and foreign 
minister, condemned recent violence in Ulster and said a range 
of issues had been reviewed. 
  Sir Patrick relayed British disappointment at the Irish 
government's recent decision to scrap a 20-year-old ban on 
broadcasting interviews with members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and 
other groups with paramilitary links. A similar ban continues 
to operate in the UK. 
  Mr Adams said he was now actively engaged in developing an 
unarmed strategy. 
  The Sinn Fein president added: "It should be encouraged, not 
discouraged. Indeed, despite all the difficulties, Sinn Fein 
has now moved to a position where our main function as a 
political party is to build a peace process." 
  He said the development of that process, which included the 
Downing Street declaration, was a response to his party's peace 
strategy and the initiative undertaken between him and SDLP 
leader John Hume. 
  Sinn Fein, he said, was committed to a peace settlement. 
  He added: "I am concerned, I am indeed anxious to be 
persuaded that the Downing Street declaration can provide a 
basis for us. And even if this is not the case, even if there 
is a gap between what is required and what is on offer then we 
should all move to bridge that gap. I am persuaded to go the 
extra mile." 
  Apart from the Downing Street declaration, Mr Adams tonight 
clearly had America on his mind when he spoke. 
  The White House is seeking a form of words which would 
enable 
President Clinton to issue a waiver of a long-term visa ban 
imposed by the immigration authorities because of the Sinn Fein 
president's alleged involvement in violence. 
  Mr Adams has been invited to address a conference in New 
York 
on Northern Ireland next Tuesday. It is being organised by the 
National Committee on American Foreign Policy. 
  Senators Edward Kennedy and Christopher Dodd are among those 
campaigning for a lifting of the ban, but the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, Mr Tom Foley, one of the most powerful 
Irish Americans in Washington, is apparently opposed to it and 
there is pressure from the British as well to resist any moves 
to allow the Sinn Fein president in. 
  The leaders of the four main constitutional parties have 
been 
invited but it is understood the two Unionist leaders, Mr James 
Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, have declined.

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin and Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds and Sinn Fein 
leader Gerry Adams tonight said they knew nothing of reports 
that the IRA might declare a three-month ceasefire. 
  Their comments followed reports from Belfast that the IRA 
was 
considering declaring a brief truce to try to wring concessions 
on the Downing Street declaration on Northern Ireland. 
  A REUTERS news agency report quoted republican sources in 
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic as saying a three-month 
halt to attacks on British troops and police in the province was 
under consideration at a series of secret IRA meetings. The 
sources said the ceasefire was being floated to put pressure on 
Britain to take a more active role in uniting Ulster with the 
republic, according to REUTERS. 
  But Mr Adams told the Irish Republic's RTE broadcasting 
network that he doubted there was any validity in the ceasefire 
report. 
  Mr Reynolds, commenting after a meeting of his Fianna Fail 
party in County Mayo, said the vast majority of people were 
anxious that there should be an end to the violence. But he 
stressed that a temporary ceasefire would not bring about a 
renegotiation of the December 15 joint Anglo-Irish statement. 
  Mr Reynolds said the peace declaration could be 
authoritatively explained by either the British or Irish 
Government. But, in an apparent signal of growing Dublin 
impatience with the failure of hard-line republicans to respond 
to the initiative, he warned it would be unrealistic and 
unacceptable to suggest the political issues could be resolved 
in bilateral talks between anonymous British Government 
representatives and Sinn Fein. 
  In the latest of a series of comments on the peace 
initiative, Mr Reynolds claimed "fairly comprehensive 
clarification" had now been given in a series of speeches and 
public statements by him and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir 
Patrick Mayhew. He added: "I would ask everyone to address 
themselves to that clarification and to the document itself -- 
so that we do not keep going round and round discussing points 
that have already been dealt with." 
  The fundamental problems of Northern Ireland had to be 
resolved democratically around a table between all the parties 
and the two governments, he said, adding: "We would all soon 
like to move on to that stage." 
  The end of terrorist violence would produce a large peace 
dividend that would have a major impact on prosperity throughout 
Ireland. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Adams tonight spoke of his ambition to "bring 
an end to the IRA and take the gun out of Irish politics." But 
he insisted that the Downing Street peace declaration had fudged 
the issue of Irish self-determination. Mr Adams, on RTE 
television, claimed there were several "matters of text" in the 
declaration that required clarification. The document first 
addressed the self- determination issue, then went on to fudge 
it, he said. 
  The Sinn Fein president's 20-minute interview was recorded 
shortly before it was broadcast. It was shown in line with 
official guidelines circulated earlier this month when the 
Dublin government dropped a ban on TV and radio interviews with 
members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and other groups with paramilitary 
connections. 
  Mr Adams said: "I am totally committed to moving out of the 
conflict situation into a peaceful situation. What I want to do 
-- and this is a judgment from me -- is to bring an end to the 
Irish Republican Army, be part of taking the gun totally out of 
Irish politics now." 
  He added: "It is a long time since a republican was ... 
interviewed in an RTE studio. With 20 years of disinformation 
to catch up on, I can tell you now that I am absolutely 
confident that this generation of republicans will be part of 
bringing about a lasting peace. 
  "This Sinn Fein leadership is totally committed to bringing 
that about ... The opportunity for peace will not be squandered 
by republicans and we will not let the British Government 
squander it." 
  In Londonderry tonight, another Sinn Fein leader insisted 
the 
republican movement wanted "a permanent peace, a peace built on 
justice and equality and on democratic rights, including our 
right as a nation to self-determination." 
  Tom Hartley called on the British Government to withdraw the 
Unionist veto to political change if it wanted a solution. 
  "Unionists must be persuaded that their real strength lies 
not in threats and vetoes, but in their place as a substantial 
minority on the island of Ireland," he told a rally. 
  The Government had created the Unionist veto and had the 
power to remove it. The veto had "promoted intransigence and an 
absolute unwillingness to consider any proposal for political 
progress."

  [Text] Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams today claimed the 
decision to grant him a visa would advance the entire peace 
process in Northern Ireland. 
  As he waited for his flight to New York at Dublin airport he 
said he thought the United States could play an influential role 
in resolving the Ulster conflict. 
  "They can encourage the British, without taking sides, and 
move the situation on," he said. 
  Asked whether he had renounced violence, one of the 
stipulations for a visa reportedly laid down, Mr Adams replied: 
"My attitude is quite simple and straight forward -- I want an 
end to violence." 
  He planned to make a number of speeches while in the United 
States and his message would be that there is an opportunity for 
peace. 
  "We are now in a very critical phase in the process towards 
that. We are not going to squander the opportunity for peace. 
President Clinton's administration can play a very helpful and 
encouraging role now." 
  Asked about the still-awaited response of Sinn Fein and the 
IRA to last month's Downing Street peace declaration, Mr Adams 
replied: "You can have a response as quickly as the British 
Government explains where they see the declaration fitting in 
the overall peace process. While they refuse to clarify the 
situation they build a road-block to forward movement."

  [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds has made a 
lengthy reply to a letter from Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams 
about the Downing Street Ulster peace declaration, according to 
Dublin sources today. 
  Mr Reynolds confirmed earlier that he would answer Mr 
Adams's 
request for clarification of the document he signed with Prime 
Minister John Major in London last month. 
  But the Irish premier also made clear he could add little to 
a series of public speeches he made about the peace initiative 
and its aims. 
  Mr Reynolds has sought to spell out the aims of the joint 
Anglo-Irish statement on a number of occasions in a bid to 
provoke a positive response from the IRA and its Sinn Fein 
allies. 
  So far, though, the hardline republican movement has 
restricted itself to continuing consultations about the document 
with its membership. 
  Sinn Fein-staged public meetings on the issue are set to 
continue throughout Ireland until the middle of next month, 
ahead of the party's annual conference in Dublin. 
  In his reply to Mr Adams -- who sent a similar letter to Mr 
Major -- Mr Reynolds is understood to have spelled out the 
consequences of an end to the IRA terror campaign. 
  This is thought to have centred on the timing of exploratory 
talks with Sinn Fein as part of the political process bid to 
resolve the issue of Northern Ireland. 
  Since the December 15 signing of the peace statement, Dublin 
has been more willing than London to move towards clarification 
of the document, while stopping well short of any form of 
renegotiation. 
  But in Dublin on Friday [28 January], after a meeting of the 
Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference, 
Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew appeared to suggest that he, 
too, would clarify some of the issues. 
  Deputy Irish premier and Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who 
jointly chaired the conference session, today said every 
opportunity to spell out the aims of the peace declaration had 
to be taken. 
  He believed all the neccessary clarification was in the 
"carefully and well-thought-out document," but stressed: "We are 
not going to foreclose on the prospect for peace on this island."

German Rightists"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The party leader of the Russian right-wing 
extremists, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, wants to expand his direct 
contacts with the right-wing extremist German People's Union 
[DVU] in Germany to other rightist parties and groups. 
  According to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, the 
Federal Government has received indications that another 
application for entry by Zhirinovskiy can be expected on the 
occasion of a "European Congress," which is to take place in 
Cologne at the beginning of February. On 29 December 1993 
Zhirinovskiy was refused an entry visa. 
  According to findings by the Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, the "European Congress" is being 
prepared by rightist German deputies of the European Parliament. 
According to findings by intelligence services, Zhirinovskiy 
intends to try to get intentional approval for his policy in 
Europe and to use his contacts with rightist German politicians 
for this purpose. At a joint press conference in Moscow this 
week, Zhirinovskiy assured DVU Chairman Gerhard Frey of "eternal 
friendship." On the same day, the Moscow public prosecutor's 
office initiated proceedings against Zhirinovskiy for war 
agitation.

European integration. Salolainen, whom we contacted a short 
time ago, confirms that the European Commission has in practice 
completed its detailed stances on agriculture. 
  [Begin Salolainen recording] Well, yes, Federal Chancellor 
Kohl has the opinion that this is still fully possible [as 
heard] and he viewed very sympathetically the fact that Finland 
and the other countries applying for membership would become 
members in the European Union within this timeframe. In 
addition, he promised his full personal support, his strong 
support, toward the success of this. He saidthat this is 
necessary also regarding the general development in Europe, in 
other words, that a positive signal could be given to the rest 
of Europe about the fact that the European Union is a developing 
organization which can expand, and which would also be an 
example for the Central and East European countries, indicating 
that they, too, can progress further in the market economy and 
also toward future membership of the European Union. [end

  [Excerpts] Bonn, 28 Jan (KNA) -- Minister for Finance 
Musalia Mudavadi has appealed for food relief. The minister 
made the appeal in Bonn, Germany, when he met the country's 
minister for economic development [as received] Mr. Carl-Dieter 
Spranger. Mr. Mudavadi said that Kenya had been hit by a severe 
drought. He also said the country was hosting hundreds of 
thousands of refugees from its neighbours. Mr. Mudavadi is 
leading a six-member Kenyan delegation on a multipurpose tour 
here. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "hfe.": "Kohl: Open Markets for Products </F>
From the East"] 
  [Text] Davos, 28 January -- For the West, the countries of 
East and Central Europe have become serious competitors for 
jobs. However, this is a competition that will contribute to 
accelerating the necessary structural adjustments. Those who 
stop this structural change harm themselves, FRG Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl stressed at the opening of the 24th World Economic 
Forum in Davos in Switzerland. Detachment from the reform 
states or even the possible reduction of economic aid for these 
countries would also have disastrous consequences for the West, 
said Kohl, who particularly referred to possible immigration of 
workers to West Europe. 
  Therefore, the further opening of Western markets for East 
European products is necessary because only in this way can 
these countries be enabled to earn the foreign exchange needed 
for their development by exports. Despite all the support from 
the West, the help for the reform countries continues to be only 
help for self-help. The reform states also have to be 
introduced to the market economy more slowly than before. 
German experiences have shown that patience is one of the most 
important factors in the transformation process. Moreover, 
political signals also have to be given, Kohl said. For 
example, he refused to accept the Oder-Neisse border as the 
future eastern border of the European Community. The process of 
enlargement is also indispensable in the combating of 
unemployment because unemployment no longer can be combated in 
only one country, he said. For this reason, the chancellor 
called for the European countries' joint efforts to combat 
unemployment and to ensure stability, while he gave preference 
to stability over the observation of the timetable in the course 
of European unification. 
  In his deliberations, Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer 
also focused on stability policy. He urgently appealed to the 
industrial nations to stick to anti-inflation policy. Moreover, 
Tietmeyer took the view that there should be no experiments with 
anti-inflation policy. Rather, the industrial nations have to 
be careful not to endanger their successes in the curbing of 
inflation. Particular caution is required as far as the 
increase of the state expenditures is concerned. Tietmeyer 
commented skeptically on the possibility to boost demand by 
increasing the state expenditure. This would probably be more 
harmful than useful, he said.

  [Excerpts] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government wants 
to work toward the improvement of the European Union's internal 
security. It must be ensured that borders do not come down for 
criminals while they remain in place for the prosecuting 
authorities, says a program of action drafted by Federal 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther for the period of the German 
EU presidency in the second half of 1994. 
  WELT AM SONNTAG adds that according to Kanther, cross-border 
crime, which is increasingly being organized on an international 
basis, must be combated more effectively, and illegal 
immigration in the European region -- and especially in Germany 
-- must be halted. The interior minister told the paper that he 
wants to ensure "an improvement in cooperation between all the 
security authorities." The German Government also wants to step 
up the expansion of "Europol" in The Hague and ensure that the 
European police organization is "fully operational" by October 
1994. 
  According to information from the news agency DDP/ADN, the 
Europol organization will take up work officially on 16 
February. Narcotics agents from the 12 EU states based in The 
Hague will then cooperate in order to better organize the 
combating of internationally active drug gangs and other serious 
cross-border international crime. [passage omitted] 
  Cooperation between the German and Polish border police will 
also be the focus of talks tomorrow between Kanther and his 
Polish counterpart Andrzej Milczanowski. The talks in Warsaw 
will also center on police cooperation, the Federal Interior 
Ministry announced in Bonn today.

<F P=106> [Article by Theo Sommer: "What We Fear Should Not Be </F>
Provoked"] 
  [Text] Is the West a coward? Is it knuckling under to 
"Russian Hitler" Zhirinovskiy just in case? Is it permitting 
the Kremlin to lay claim to being a great power, which is 
something that it should resolutely counter? In the middle of 
January, the Atlantic alliance offered the Central and East 
European states a Partnership for Peace, which puts off full 
membership in NATO until some indefinite time in the future. 
The Partnership for Peace was also offered to Russia, so -- as 
President Clinton justified it -- not to create "a new border 
between East and West, which could prompt a confrontation in the 
future." Since then, the charge of "appeasement" has been 
appearing in the columns of the conservative press. 
  Appeasement? Until September 1938, it was a highly 
respectable concept which described the goal of all diplomacy: 
tranquility, satisfaction, and reconciliation. However, since 
the Munich conference, at which Chamberlain and Daladier gave in 
to the brutal pressure applied by Hitler and agreed to the 
dismembering of Czechoslovakia, the concept has been a negative 
one. Since that time, it has no longer stood for sound, but for 
anxious reconciliation; not for the wise conclusion of 
compromises, but for dishonorable capitulation; not moderate 
compromise, but lily-livered conciliation. 
  Historical analogies are a lottery. Every situation is 
different. It can be just as wrong to be blind with regard to 
the lessons of Munich as it is to apply them blindly to the 
wrong situation. The ability to recognize, compare, and 
distinguish remains the most difficult aspect of the art of 
statesmanship. 
  A long time ago, Hans J. Morgenthau, the doyen of the 
subject 
of international relations, produced an appropriate criterion 
that is worth heeding. He wrote: "Appeasement is a corrupt 
compromise policy. What is erroneous about it is that it 
considers an imperialist policy to be a policy for maintaining 
the status quo." Morgenthau preached that that would be fatal. 
He also warned: "It would only be marginally less risky to 
react to a policy that only seeks to achieve adjustments within 
the existing state of affairs, as if it were an imperialist 
policy." 
  Thus, the first question is: Are we going to write -- under 
different circumstances -- 1938 once again? 
  The plain answer is no. Today, there is no one who 
resolutely wants war, who wants war in the way that Hitler did 
(his appetite for expansion was in no way whetted by Munich -- 
he wanted his war long before that). There is no one anywhere 
who is being ruthlessly blackmailed with territorial demands. 
Just as the European democracies in their weakness gave in to 
Europe's dictators in the 1930's, today, the situation is 
reversed, the point being to support the democrats in Russia in 
order to prevent the emergence of a new dictator. 
  The next question is: Can a democratic Russia also pose a 
threat to East Europe and even West Europe? 
  The straightforward answer is, of course, in principle it 
can. Russia remains a great power simply by virtue of the area 
it covers, its location in both Europe and Asia and its arsenal 
of nuclear weapons. It was always unrealistic to believe that 
it will withdraw from world politics as a eunuch state without 
interests following the collapse of communism. Democracies also 
have foreign policy interests, fears, and ambitions. They can 
become uncomfortable and go off course, especially if they owe 
their establishment to a total collapse, if they feel hurt, if 
they imagine that they are "undefeated in the field," and if, 
because of their amputation from the old state body, they suffer 
from imagined pains that can only be eased with difficulty. A 
new imperialism can easily develop on that kind of soil. 
  However, distinctions have to be made: between the 
"internal" empire of the tsars and commissars that collapsed at 
the end of 1991, and Stalin's "external empire," which collapsed 
in 1990. More than just traces remain of the internal empire: 
common structures, close economic ties, monetary policy ties, 
and security interests. These links can only be separated from 
each other with difficulty. It would even make practical sense 
for some of those elements to be brought together again in a way 
that would benefit all. When Yeltsin says that the CIS states 
have realized that there are many problems that they cannot 
solve by themselves, that without cooperating, they will not 
survive by themselves, there is nothing threatening about that. 
  That Russia sees itself in a protective role with regard to 
25 million Russians in the "the abroad near at hand" can only 
with difficulty be immediately termed an expression of new 
expansionism. If Hitler had only insisted that the rights of 
the Sudeten Germans be respected, then no one could have leveled 
any accusations against him. Russia has legitimate interests to 
protect. The West can only demand that these interests be 
protected with peaceful means and in accordance with the 
principles of the CSCE charter, and that is all that it can 
demand. 
  The situation with respect to the former external empire -- 
the former Warsaw Pact states and the Baltic republics that 
Stalin brought back under the Russian yoke by force with the 
assistance of Hitler -- is entirely different. No one can doubt 
that Russia has interests there, but a kind of "Monroeski 
Doctrine" that gives Moscow a dominant influence in that area is 
unacceptable. That area is also the "abroad near at hand" for 
the West. The West also has interests there. NATO has 
abandoned shifting its alliance borders from the Oder to the 
Bug, but the expectation underpinning that is that the great 
power Russia will not act in a big power way there and throw its 
weight about. 
  So far, there has been no reason to consider that 
expectation 
unjustified or unrealistic, and that also applies to the latest 
statements made by [Russian Foreign Minister] Kozyrev, 
statements which require clarification. So far, the East 
European states have been seeking to join NATO for very 
different and egoistical reasons, reasons that have nothing to 
do with the actual degree of threat. That made it easy for NATO 
to offer the Partnership for Peace as an interim solution. It 
offers two chances. Either Russia becomes drawn into it, which 
makes full membership superfluous or means membership could be 
extended to Russia too. Or, if Russia displays a dangerous new 
expansionist impulse, then a new clear demarcation line will 
have to be drawn, NATO's border will have to be moved 800 
kilometers to the east. Following the Partnership for Peace 
adjustment phase, this would be easier, more effective, and more 
reliable than today. 
  This interim solution has nothing to do with yielding to 
pressure. It is far removed from all thinking in terms of 
"worst case" categories, the worst is not considered inevitable. 
However, that does not oblige the West to entertain a "best 
case" illusion, a boundless expectation of a condition of 
general bliss. It is pragmatic in the best sense. It does not 
maliciously provoke what we should fear, and it does not rule 
out any of the things that we should do if things turn out 
differently. Cowardice? No, wise statesmanship.

  [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN) -- There are 42,400 right-wing 
extremists in Germany. This is stated in a confidential 
analysis compiled by the Federal Office for the Protection of 
the Constitution. The Cologne newspaper SONNTAGS-EXPRESS 
reports that according to the analysis there are "5,600 militant 
right-wingers among them." The German People's Union (DVU) with 
"some 26,000 members" is "the largest right-wing extremist 
organization." 
  The report leaves open the politically very controversial 
question of whether the "Republicans" are an unconstitutional 
party. Staff of the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution working at federal and state level were able to 
determine that the Republicans, whose declared membership of 
23,000 is questioned, show "in fact indications of right-wing 
extremist tendencies." It is uncertain, however, whether these 
will intensify or whether the party will succeed in "pushing 
back the right-wing extremist tendencies in its ranks," the 
newspaper reports.

  [Excerpts] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Through their military 
cooperation, Germany and Poland are making an important 
contribution to stability and security in Europe. This was 
affirmed after talks today in Berlin on cooperation by German 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and his Polish counterpart Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk. 
  The tried and tested cooperation should be expanded in the 
spirit of the recent NATO summit decisions and with the goal of 
future Polish membership in the North Atlantic defense alliance. 
[passage omitted] 
  "No date can yet be set" for Poland's accession for the time 
being, Ruehe said. It depends above all on how quickly the 
necessary "compatibility" of the Polish Armed Forces could be 
achieved. This includes a common understanding of defense 
strategy as well as equal standards for telecommunication 
equipment. 
  Kolodziejczyk said Poland has the "firm intention of 
becoming 
an active participant in NATO's Partnership for Peace program," 
but under no circumstances will it take part in a "race for 
quick NATO membership." [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on recent developments in Russia, Ruehe said that 
in the interest of "Russia's internal development and of 
international stability," he believes it is important to seek to 
establish intensive contacts and a political dialogue with the 
Russian military.

<F P=106> [Report signed "cs": "Bonn Provides Massive Help"] </F>
  [Text] The Federal Government has increased its help to 
the ailing arms industry with Hermes export guarantees for 
international transactions. According to a confidential list of 
projects from the Finance Ministry in Bonn, in October 1993, 
government guarantees for military exports amounted to 2.3 
billion German marks -- three times more than in the previous 
year. 
  According to the list, which contains 10 projects, 
transactions with Indonesia account for more than half of the 
amount. The second major client is Turkey, which took the 
lion's share of Hermes guarantees for export deals in 1992. 
Both countries have promised billions in orders for German 
shipyards. In addition, the Federal Government provided several 
minor guarantees for the sale of helicopters of the Munich 
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm company to Botswana, Swaziland, 
Argentina, the Czech Republic, and the Philippines.

  [Excerpt] Budapest/Essen (ADN-WDO) -- The first cooperation 
project in the gas industry between Germany and Hungary has been 
signed in Essen by MOL Magyar Olaj-es Gazipari R.T., Budapest, 
and Ruhrgas AG. The two companies announced today that they 
will cooperate primarily in the purchase of natural gas from the 
West and its transport across Germany to Hungary. It has also 
been agreed that Ruhrgas will provide auxiliary supplies via a 
planned pipeline from Austria to Hungary, thereby improving the 
country's ability to ensure a constant and steady flow. 
  As part of the cooperation there are also plans to expand 
the 
infrastructure of the gas industry in Hungary and to introduce 
energy saving and environmentally friendly technology, including 
the installation of gasflow controlling and measuring equipment.

<F P=106> [Report by Washington correspondent Dietrich Zwaetz: </F>
"Two-Faced Policy"] 
  [Text] Juergen Weber does not conceal his disappointment. 
The partial approval granted by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation for the alliance between Lufthansa and its ideal 
partner in the United States, United Airlines, is "almost 
worthless" for the Lufthansa chief. "If one denies United basic 
rights, then the alliance does not make any sense," explained 
Weber before his meeting on Wednesday [26 January] with U.S. 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena in Washington. For 
Weber, "the key element" is flight code sharing (the use of 
joint flight numbers) on the Atlantic route and "connecting 
flights on both sides." 
  Of all the potential partners that Lufthansa spoke to in the 
United States, Weber still considers United to be the ideal one. 
"If we get this going," said Weber, referring to the fact that 
-- apart from the Atlantic route -- Lufthansa's and United's 
services hardly ever overlap, "we would have a network covering 
the globe." However, the alliance will not come about now, 
because Pena has been playing for time and has blocked the 
cooperation plans by approving only part of the application. 
  Weber will now be counting heavily on Transportation 
Minister 
Matthias Wissmann, whose commitment he can "only praise." At 
his meeting with U.S. President Clinton on Monday, the 
chancellor can also try to move things forward. However, the 
Lufthansa president knows that negotiations on a new air 
transportation treaty -- despite the "agreement" in the fall of 
1993 -- and on partnership with a U.S. airline will have to 
start from scratch. Now, the German side must once again 
reserve for itself the right to withdraw from the 1955/1978 air 
transportation treaty. 
  It is not the first time that U.S. policy has been 
two-faced. 
On the outside, only competition is supposed to shape markets 
in all areas of the economy. However, if the interests of U.S. 
companies are at risk, the brakes are applied gently or firmly. 
That United Airlines is a U.S. company is also being ignored: 
The pact with Lufthansa would run counter to the interests of 
American Airlines and especially Delta Airlines to too great an 
extent. 
  Delta, which already dispatches passengers from the United 
States all over Europe, especially East Europe, from its hub 
airport Frankfurt would be interested in a third country form of 
code-sharing. That is not provided for explicitly in the new 
air transportation treaty, but that was something that the U.S. 
side only discovered after the conclusions of the negotiations 
in the fall of last year. However, it was enough for Secretary 
Pena to shelve the treaty. That also means that the 
Lufthansa-United alliance is also blocked. Yet, a failure to 
form an alliance will jeopardize Lufthansa's recovery, and if 
Lufthansa does not get out of the red, then that would also 
endanger the privatization of the Kranich airline.

<F P=106> [Report signed "gw": "Better Export Opportunities Make West </F>
German Industry More Confident"] 
  [Text] Munich -- The west German manufacturing industry 
still considers itself to be in a bad situation, but the number 
of negative reports is continuing to decline, according to the 
latest poll on the economic situation conducted by the Ifo 
Institute for Economic Research. 
  Prospects for the future have also somewhat improved, 
because 
of better export opportunities. Ifo was also able to establish 
that the business climate in east German industry picked up in 
December 1993, following the gloom of the previous month. 
  December orders in west German industry were almost at the 
same level as in the previous month. Ifo noted that although 
output remained almost unchanged, stocks were not as high. The 
institute's experts still consider the level of unfilled orders 
unsatisfactory, although they now cover a period of 2.6 months 
and have somewhat increased compared to September. Utilization 
of production capacity also somewhat increased according to Ifo 
and rose to 79 (September 78) percent. Company production plans 
for the next few months tend less and less toward cutting down 
on production. 
  In the meantime, some reductions in prices have already been 
noted in the production of preproducts and capital goods. 
Contrary to the trend at the end of the year, Ifo expects very 
slight price increases over the next few months. Price 
increases in the western Germany's retail trade are also 
expected to be markedly lower than a year ago. Although the 
business climate in the retail trade was considered less 
negative than in the previous month, retailers want to place 
fewer orders in the coming months. Ultimately, retailers 
continue to take a very skeptical view of how business will 
develop over the next six months. 
  Things are also looking up for the manufacturers of 
preproducts, because companies have noted somewhat higher 
demand, which has enabled them to reduce stocks. That also 
applies to the chemical industry. The industry has even 
described business as good. In the capital goods industry too, 
the number of companies reporting that business was bad has 
fallen. Because of increased optimism in the industry with 
regard to exports, the future is being viewed with less 
skepticism. Thus, manufacturers of capital goods in the 
electrical engineering industry want to increase output over the 
next few months. 
  Since the spring of 1993, business for manufacturers of 
consumer goods has been unsatisfactory, although there was 
something of an improvement in December, according to Ifo. 
Better prospects for exports have also led to an optimistic 
assessment of future trends. In the case of automakers, although 
orders were somewhat lower in December, a more positive view was 
taken of exports. Output in the automobile industry will remain 
static. In the consumer goods sector, there is pessimism about 
prospects for the next months, especially as orders have dropped. 
  In eastern Germany, Ifo has noted that assessments of the 
current business climate are not only better, but there is also 
cautious optimism about the future. In December, both domestic 
and foreign orders increased more markedly that in the previous 
month. Although orders have now increased to cover 3.2 
(September: 3.1) months, over half the companies questioned by 
Ifo report that orders are insufficient. Utilization of 
capacity was 75 percent (72 percent), three percentage points 
higher than in September. 
  Although east German industrial output is continuing to 
rise, 
employment is still being reduced. However, in the future, Ifo 
expects reductions in personnel to proceed more slowly than over 
the next three months, the total number of employees should only 
decline by 3 percent.

<F P=106> [Report signed "rb": "Declining Wages Slow Down Economy"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt -- Declining consumer demand might prove 
to be the main threat to the West German economy this year. 
Demand is being slowed down by three factors: "zero wage 
rounds," growing unemployment, and increasing public expenditure 
with stagnating social benefits cutting purchasing power. This 
has been pointed out by research institutes the Ifo and the 
German Institute for Economic Research [DIW], as well as the 
Association of German Retailers (HDE). 
  Gross wages and salaries are expected to go up by an average 
of 1.6 percent in 1994, the latest weekly report of the DIW 
says, compared with an increase of 2.5 percent in 1993. The 
Munich-based Ifo Institute expects similar figures: In view of 
growing pension contributions and other fees, employees' net 
take-home pay will be 1.5 percent down on last year, a cut of 10 
billion German marks [DM], the researchers say. This takes into 
account declining employment figures, which will result in an 
estimated loss of earnings of some DM20 billion, according to 
the Ifo. 
  The HDE thinks that this means bleak prospects for their 
trade: "Contrary to various graffiti in the toilets 
[Latrinengeruschte], existing conditions will not allow the 
retail trade to recover quickly from the trough," HDE manager 
Hubertus Tessar said before the "Premiere" trade fair in 
Frankfurt. After a decline in turnover by a nominal 2.5 
percent, a real 4.5 percent, to DM760 billion, he thinks that 
the 1994 figures will not show much improvement: "The 
purchasing power of German consumers will decrease below the 
1990 level." Owing to this development, some 30,000 jobs will 
be lost in the retail trade by December. 
  Tessar does not think much of Bonn politicians. Not only 
does the state plunder the purses of private households by means 
of higher taxes, but the latest deregulation plans -- especially 
yesterday's decision to abolish the rebate law and the 
relaxation of shop-closing regulations -- "encourage 
concentration and endanger innumerable medium-size retail shops." 
  In connection with the risks to the economy resulting from 
this, the Berlin-based DIW warns against a "zero round" in wage 
policy. In contrast to "expected wage settlements of 
approximately 2 percent," this would result in "declining 
demand, and thus a fall in capacity utilization." This "will 
not make companies step up investment." In addition, the 
government's austerity policy aggravates the slack demand, and 
monetary policy does not do much in terms of countering this by 
way of cutting interest rates. On the other hand, says the DIW, 
in the event of a "zero round," prices "would not go up much 
less than with the expected wage settlements, owing to the great 
impact of administrative price increases and rent increases." 
  The Ifo Institute is somewhat more optimistic. It says that 
the economic climate has improved recently. Equipment and 
capital investment should go up by 2 percent in 1994. West 
German exporters could expect gains "particularly in markets 
outside West Europe." In private consumption, the Ifo expects a 
real decline of 1 percent.

  [Excerpts] At Saint-Ouen, site since last Tuesday [18 
January] of the 28th Congress of the French Communist Party, a 
new generation has taken over. The National Committee has made 
its choice, and as Alain Bocquet, MP [member of parliament] for 
the Nord [department] has just announced, it chose Robert Hue. 
Many people think that there will be no change. Robert Hue is 
known as a man of the Party apparatus, whose rise is relatively 
recent. [passage omitted] Robert Hue had been a member of the 
political bureau since the last Party congress in 1990. He is; 
nevertheless, an old communist, having joined the Party at 18, 
in 1964. [passage omitted] He is mayor of 
Montigny-les-Cormeilles [in the Val d'Oise department].

  [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  NATO's Political Mission Growing </H5>
  While doubting that it would be advantageous for France to 
rejoin the NATO command structure, Pascal Boniface, director of 
the Institute of International and Strategic Research, credits 
NATO with being one of the few pillars of stability in an 
increasingly "nationalistic" Europe. Writing in the 10 January 
Paris daily LIBERATION, Boniface asserts that NATO is a "unique 
forum" for consultation among the Western democracies, remains 
the "best guarantee" for a continued U.S. presence in Europe, 
and exerts a "limitless attraction" on the former Warsaw Pact 
countries. According to Boniface, NATO remains the only 
multinational defense organization in Europe with the required 
infrastructure, logistics, command and control, and imposing 
force. Nevertheless, he expressed doubts about the benefits of 
rejoining NATO's integrated command, suggesting that allies 
would be more receptive to French policies if France assisted 
the development of a genuinely European defense identity. He 
observes that the "complementarity" between a European defense 
identity and NATO was endorsed at the 1991 NATO summit in 
Copenhagen and reaffirmed at the NATO summit in Rome later that 
same year. 
  Boniface calls for a redistribution of roles within NATO 
because of NATO's shift from purely military to political and 
security missions, coupled with what he perceives as a gradual 
disengagement from NATO by the United States. The United States 
should share control with Europe, Boniface believes. In the 
future, the Alliance's main military mission will be crisis 
management and peacekeeping. However, U.S. "reservations" about 
military intervention in Bosnia are "not encouraging" in this 
respect, Boniface contends, since NATO is powerless to act when 
the United States declines to take military risks. The December 
1992 decision by France to participate in NATO peacekeeping 
operations, he contends, should be seen in that specific context 
and should not necessarily be interpreted as a first step to a 
return to integrated military structures, Boniface concludes. 
<H5>  French Reintegration Possible </H5>
  Commentator Alain Duhamel writes that, while France's 1966 
decision to "remove the tricolor troops" from a NATO "totally 
dominated by the United States" had a "solid foundation" at the 
time, this "old" doctrine could soon be replaced by a "search 
for influence through solidarity" (LE POINT, 8 January). 
Changing circumstances call for such a shift, Duhamel believes, 
citing the situation in Russia, Bosnia, elsewhere in East 
Europe, and the perceived U.S. "retreat from the Old World." 
France is in an "ideal" position to influence a redefinition of 
NATO, Duhamel contends. France's nuclear capability and 
influence in Africa gives Paris the clout to argue for a 
"bipolar" equal division of NATO's political, military, and 
financial responsibilities between the United States and Europe. 
In Duhamel's view, this would place NATO on a more realistic 
footing, lead to greater autonomy within NATO for the European 
contingent, and assist the development of large-scale European 
military units composed exclusively of professional troops. It 
could also foster the growth of a competitive European defense 
industry, Duhamel believes. Under this arrangement France would 
probably rejoin an integrated NATO military command under a 
European general staff and thus bring about, through different 
means, the Gaullist dream of a "new equilibrium" for NATO, 
Duhamel concludes.

<F P=106> [Philippe Marcovici editorial: "France Versus America -- A </F>
Convenient Quarrel"] 
  [Text] Sarajevo's cannons have sparked an unexpected 
controversy in Franco-American relations, even though portents 
of the current crisis have been far from scarce in the last few 
months. In any case, acrimonious may be the kindest term that 
can be applied to relations between Paris and Washington today. 
Given the tone used by the French and the Americans in 
lecturing each other on political ethics, one finds it hard to 
believe that this is a dialogue between two allies, two friends. 
  Paris is convinced that those who are today blocking the 
peace process painstakingly elaborated by the Twelve are the 
Muslims, encouraged by the United States, which has been 
sustaining the hope of an illusory Western intervention. Such 
is clearly the opinion of the French foreign minister, who has 
asked the Americans to exert pressure on the Muslims. As a 
result, a suitably incensed Washington has reminded the 
apparently oblivious France of decency's imperatives. Any 
pressure should be exerted on the Serb aggressor, not on the 
Muslims, who are the victims. In other words, the Americans do 
not mind a continuing war as long as moral standards are 
preserved. 
  The oratory contests stemming from this basic disagreement 
are only a symptom of the malaise that permeates an 
international community confronted with its obvious inability to 
put an end to the bloodiest conflict Europe has known since 1940. 
  While France, together with its European partners, has 
spared 
no effort in its attempt to achieve a negotiated settlement, it 
can only recognize today that every initiative it took was 
ultimately a failure. As for America, the only country able to 
muster the necessary means for imposing peace on the three 
warring factions, its primary concern has always be and still is 
to avoid being drawn into the Bosnian bloodbath. Thus heaping 
charges and countercharges upon each other, Paris and Washington 
look like an old couple bickering over its reciprocal 
shortcomings. 
  However, the slightly sordid quarrel may in fact be no more 
than a convenient smoke screen. Since neither the French nor 
the Americans or their European Union and NATO allies agree on 
what must be done, it necessarily follows that nothing will be 
done. Which is exactly what all of them want. One must be 
resigned to the fact that the end of this war is as far off as 
it ever was....

  The first 1994 poll conducted from 3 to 6 January by the 
PARIS MATCH/BVA polling organization among a nationally 
representative sample of 985 individuals over 18 showed that the 
popularity of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, President 
Francois Mitterrand, and the government rose since the last poll 
in 1993. The poll appeared in the 20 January Paris PARIS MATCH. 
  Overall, and accounting for differences between leftist and 
rightist voters, 49 percent of the respondents (compared with 44 
percent in the December poll) said they had a good opinion of 
Mitterrand as president of the Republic. Some 44 percent said 
they had a bad opinion of him, compared with 48 percent in 
December. Seven percent did not know. When asked about their 
opinion of Balladur as prime minister, 60 percent said it was 
good, up 4 percent since December, and 29 percent said it was 
bad, down 5 percent since December. A total of 11 percent did 
not know. Respondents were also asked if they were satisfied or 
dissatisfied with the way France is governed. Overall, 33 
percent said they were satisfied, up from 27 percent in 
December, and 62 percent said they were dissatisfied, down 3 
percent since December. Five percent did not know. 
  The same poll asked respondents to name the candidate for 
whom they would be more likely to vote if new legislative 
elections took place. Some 3 percent chose the extreme left, up 
1 percent since December. Eight percent opted for the Communist 
Party (PC), the same as in December. Similarly, the percentage 
of those who would vote for the Socialist Party (PS) and for 
Generation Ecologie remained stable at 21 and 5 percent 
respectively. The same was true for the Greens at 5 percent. 
Slightly more respondents would vote for the Union for French 
Democracy (UDF) (15 percent compared to 13 percent), and 
slightly fewer (29 percent compared to 31 percent) would vote 
for the Rally for the Republic (RPR). Finally, 12 
percent--compared to 13 percent in December-- would vote for the 
National Front (FN). 
  The 12 January Paris daily LIBERATION reprinted the results 
of a popularity poll conducted by the Louis Harris organization 
on 7-8 January among 1,005 voters on behalf of the PROFESSION 
POLITIQUE DE CETTE SEMAINE. Some 55 percent of the respondents 
said that the Balladur government is "going in the right 
direction," a 5 percent increase in the last two months. Some 38 
percent thought the opposite, a 3 percent drop. The most popular 
was Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua with 34 percent 
favorable opinions. He was followed by Minister of Social 
Affairs Simone Veil with 53 percent and Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Alain Juppe with 51 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by E.D. "Male, Atheist, Fortyish"] </F>
  [Text] The following poll was conducted by the IFOP [French 
Public Opinion Institute] polling organization on 16 January 
among 2,382 participants in the demonstration. 
  The typical demonstrator on 16 January [protesting 
government 
aid to private schools] was a man (60 percent), 35 to 49 (45 
percent), working in the public sector (58 percent) and, more 
specifically, was an educator (42 percent). In addition, he had 
a college education (63 percent) and children in public school 
(59 percent). One is struck, however, by the low proportion of 
young people and modest wage earners. Sunday's demonstration was 
socially elitist: Only 14 percent of the demonstrators were 
laborers and employees, compared with 26 percent who were middle 
or senior managers. The demonstration was also dominated by the 
world of education: 53 percent of the participants, when 
students and teachers are pooled together. 
  The political profile of the demonstrators is just as 
precise. Three- fourths of them were leftist sympathizers. IFOP 
pollsters only found 2 percent among them who were rightist 
sympathizers. Thus it would not be surprising to note that 
nearly half of the demonstrators voted for the Socialist Party 
[PS] in the last legislative elections. 
  In the same vein, 88 percent of the people queried placed 
themselves "on the left" in the classic left-right axis. Some 61 
percent stated they practice "no religion," against only 8 
percent of practicing Catholics and 24 percent of nonpracticing 
Catholics. Indeed, the demonstration had an element of 
irreligiosity. 
  Only 14 percent of the participants said this was their 
first 
demonstration. Some 30 percent said they "rarely" participate in 
demonstrations and 55 percent that they demonstrate "regularly." 
They did not hesitate long before participating: 81 percent made 
the decision "as soon as the announcement was made," 11 percent 
"in the last couple of weeks" and only 7 percent "in recent 
days." 
  Nearly half the demonstrators were affiliated with a trade 
union, one- fourth with a parents-of-students organization, and 
roughly one-fifth with a political party. The 16 January 
demonstration did not attract disorganized and inexperienced 
people at the last minute. 
  Its goal was very precise: the overwhelming majority of the 
participants (88 percent) were present "to defend public 
schools," a percentage that climbs to 95 percent among educators 
and to 92 percent among the parents of students. The will to 
oppose the government comes far behind, even among thse most to 
the left. The extremely low level of the political motivation of 
those wishing to help the left recoup its losses should also be 
noted. The demonstration was not political.

  [Text] Talks in the Vatican between John Paul II and 
Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin lasted an hour. The central 
issue was Bosnia and Russia's new position regarding the drama 
in the Balkans. Here is a report from Giuseppe De Carli: 
  [De Carli] This was a strictly private meeting without 
speeches or official communiques, but the arrival at the Vatican 
of the rising star of the Yeltsin government, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, was far from routine. John Paul II wanted to find 
out about the new Russian prime minister's intentions and, above 
all, to jointly evaluate the position to be taken with regard to 
the drama in Bosnia. 
  Here, we must say, the Vatican and Russia have positions 
that 
are far apart and, in some respects, irreconcilable. In the 
last few weeks, the governments of the West have learned that 
Russia is against any use of force. Yeltsin has asked for the 
Security Council to be convened and has insisted on a political 
solution to the crisis in the Balkans. The chief cause for 
concern is Russia's pro-Serbian line. It is no longer West 
against East, but the Christian world against the Muslim world. 
  This is not the Pope's position. He is desperately trying to 
build bridges between Christians and Muslims in order to find 
common grounds for tolerance. The Vatican is particularly 
concerned about the mood of Islamic nations angrily watching 
Europe's indifference towards the massacre of Bosnian Moslems. 
John Paul II once again told Chernomyrdin that after the 
collapse of the walls, it is absurd to be building new ones 
using the spur of nationalism and conflicting religious beliefs. 
According to official sources, the Russian prime minister 
listened attentively and was receptive to this line of reasoning.

Gino) Giugni was applauded when he told the 6,000 delegates in 
Rome that "the old Socialist Party leadership does not live here

destructive moral pollution" and for "a series of hastily taken, 
wrong political choices." 
  Before the assembly, Party Secretary (Ottaviano) Del Turco 
met Giorgio Bogi of the Democratic Alliance (AD). He told him 
that the PSI intends to stand together with the AD in the 
progressive alliance in the forthcoming general election.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mino Martinazzoli, secretary of the Italian </F>
Popular Party, by Mino Fuccillo in Rome on 27 January: 
"`Berlusconi Spreading Hatred, Occhetto Creating a Mess....'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] There is a crowd 
outside [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli's 
door, whereas a few months ago it was a desert here, an 
abandoned fortress. People are lining up to speak to him on the 
telephone; whereas a few weeks ago he was receiving only 
condolences and farewells, now it is all requests for 
candidacies. "It is strange that the telephone is ringing in 
this situation, in which we do not know how many members of 
parliament we will succeed in having elected. We must be 
careful not to allow ourselves to be overtaken by the frenzy of 
saying 'yes': If we succeed in identifying the candidate's 
profile, the 20 percent support could increase. Indeed, these 
elections will be determined very much on the basis of 
candidates; this factor will decide at least half the contest. 
For the present I know that the exodus is over; there is a mood 
of excitement, but many of the people I want are still 
undecided." 
  [Fuccillo] You do have one sure candidate, a candidate to 
the 
premiership, no less. 
  [Martinazzoli] I recently met with [Pact for Italy leader] 
Segni and advised him to make a very clear return to where he 
was a few months ago. I urged him not to think that the contest 
will be determined by cutting and pasting alliances and not to 
seek victory in advance without even engaging in the struggle. 
I told him to talk to ordinary people again, not with political 
leaders, just as he used to recommend. 
  [Fuccillo] What was Segni's reply? 
  [Martinazzoli] He asked me to be clear about his candidacy, 
his role as government leader. 
  [Fuccillo] And were you clear? 
  [Martinazzoli] I told him that we have only one chance -- to 
defeat the left by halting the right. Because if there is a 
strong right, the left will win. There is only one other 
alternative for us, and that is opposition. Does that seem 
clear enough to you? 
  [Fuccillo] It seems to me rather the opposite of what Segni 
wanted -- to bring everyone together, both center and right, to 
be sure of victory and to be sure of governing. 
  [Martinazzoli] Yes, Segni believed in the possibility of 
bringing everyone together. 
  [Fuccillo] Does he seem disappointed to you now? 
  [Martinazzoli] Worried that his image may have suffered some 
repercussions. 
  [Fuccillo] But you are not disappointed. 
  [Martinazzoli] No, I really am not. For some time in Italy 
parties of the left or of the right have been winning elections, 
while those identified with government, with Bribe City, have 
been losing. There is a feeling of estrangement and rancor in 
our regard. Can we recover by embracing the right? I do not 
think so. If we do that, everyone will lose together, everyone 
will become confused with each another and cancel each other 
out. You know what a fine alliance [League's lower house floor 
leader] Maroni proposed -- the North for us and the South for 
you. And this is supposed to be the new politics. No, I would 
rather pursue the straight and narrow and ask the Italians to 
defeat the left by voting for the center. 
  [Fuccillo] Did Segni agree, or will he continue to seek 
alliances on the right, possibly labeling them "technical 
electoral agreements?" 
  [Martinazzoli] Within the Popular Party too there are those 
who would like to extend the meaning of technical agreements 
excessively, turning quantity into quality. A homeopathic dose 
of electoral tactics is no cause for scandal -- but I am talking 
about small doses. To make matters perfectly clear, I will say 
that out of 475 constituencies we will be fielding our own 
candidates almost everywhere, including in northern Italy. 
  [Fuccillo] In view of how things have gone, is Segni now not 
competing like a contestant that has lost his stride? 
  [Martinazzoli] He has sought something that was nonexistent, 
and let anyone who has not done the same in this lengthy crisis 
cast the first stone. 
  [Fuccillo] Have you seen [Forza Italia] Berlusconi's 
commercial on all the television channels? 
  [Martinazzoli] When I was invited to appear on one of his 
television programs the whole screen was filled by Berlusconi. 
I was shocked; it looked like the set for the chief of state's 
New Year's message. There was something Gaullist about the set 
and the staging. I will repeat an idea expressed by my friend, 
[PPI deputy] Mattarella: If any other Italian citizen had 
announced his entry into politics by sending a videocassette to 
the newspapers, there would not have been so much ceremony. As 
of yesterday there is something entirely new in politics and, I 
would say, in the culture of this country -- something 
disturbing. 
  [Fuccillo] Are you disturbed by Berlusconi as rival, as 
demagogue, or as secretary of a business-come-party? 
  [Martinazzoli] I am disturbed by a party secretary that has 
concessions from the state for three television networks. The 
issue of the possession and utilization of networks and news is 
a question of freedom according to the advocates of modernity. 
Before Berlusconi became a politician we issued a fortuitous 
response to the problem. Now everything has become more 
critical. I think that a concession holder must respect the 
limits and purposes of the concession. I do not think that this 
is the case now. I think that the relinquishment of Fininvest's 
social positions is only a way of evading the problem; we saw it 
in the case of Montanelli's IL GIORNALE who was, and remained, 
the real owner. Such conduct is verging on a sham. Last, I 
think that no law can entirely resolve the issue unless there 
are certain ethical standards on the part of the individuals 
involved. 
  [Fuccillo] Do you think that Berlusconi has displayed such 
standards? 
  [Martinazzoli] The other evening on television he issued a 
message that was a concentration of the ideas of the right. All 
this, in a mixture of aggressive Gaullism, skepticism, and a 
kind of Craxi-style arrogance -- law and order, a social policy 
of the survival of the fittest, and so forth. There is nothing 
wrong in all this -- indeed, there are reasons for this 
psychological and political response. But Berlusconi takes it 
all too far, engages in ideological theorizing, and describes 
the enemy as something evil. I have grounds for very strong 
dispute with [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] 
Occhetto, but Berlusconi pronounces the word "communist" in such 
a way, such a tone.... He adds something extra, the something 
extra that prompted Gadda to say that he refused to engage in 
politics because of the additional hatred and cynicism involved 
in this human activity. Well, Berlusconi contributes that 
something extra, whereas I have a very different conception of 
politics. 
  [Fuccillo] In the next room your party friend, Fracanzani, 
told me that it was necessary for the government to issue a 
decree to set limits to the election campaign on television. 
  [Martinazzoli] Correct, but we must not turn Berlusconi into 
a martyr and give the impression that we want to halt him by 
decree. This is an anomalous and disturbing situation, but it is 
the voters who must be the first to resolve it. 
  [Fuccillo] Forza Italia, the MSI [Italian Social Movement], 
the National Alliance, the former Christian Democrats, and the 
League are said to be very close to an electoral agreement, to a 
cartel of the right. 
  [Martinazzoli] It is true. I have heard about meetings and 
understandings. Having established the principle that everyone 
must get together in order to win, come what may, the very 
fragile wall that set the MSI apart could not remain standing. 
They will not find it difficult to reach agreements; they will 
find it difficult to establish who is in charge. 
  [Fuccillo] So the Italian right is emerging. Is it you 
Christian Democrats who nurtured it in your bosom? 
  [Martinazzoli] No. Not even in Tambroni's day did the DC 
decide to confront the left by nurturing a right-wing attitude 
and action. 
  [Fuccillo] Assuming that it originated outside you, can it 
be 
defused? Berlusconi may not be capable of giving rise to this 
mass right, but if it already exists in society, will it not 
find a leader in Berlusconi? 
  [Martinazzoli] My political existence depends on the fact 
that I do not believe that the right is a mass phenomenon. I 
know that there is something in the subsoil of this society, and 
I know that it feeds on the eclipse of morality and of the 
center forces. I perceive the danger but I do not consider it 
inevitable. And if I may say so, I still see in this right many 
people who claim to have seen the light but who are in fact only 
seeking personal salvation and advantage. Many of them will 
bring in no votes but will demand positions. 
  [Fuccillo] What about the left? 
  [Martinazzoli] It comprises a mixture of the best of 
Catholic 
radicalism, communist nostalgia, and a former PCI [Italian 
Communist Party] that models itself on Clinton. It is sterile. 
Occhetto should have facilitated alternation by placing himself 
at the center. He made the opposite choice, and if the right 
makes headway he will bear part of the blame. 
  [Fuccillo] Will the PDS' and the PPI's paths not cross once 
more after the elections? 
  [Martinazzoli] They want to win against us, and we against 
them, so how can our paths cross? I know that from time to time 
Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema talk in terms of a 
Ciampi government after the elections, but they do so as a 
second choice. In any case, I do not believe in an Occhetto who 
talks like Quintino Sella [prefascist finance minister]. 
  [Fuccillo] The coming election means two months of insults, 
of open attacks on television and in the press. Is there any 
option other than to accept it and submit to it? 
  [Martinazzoli] When [Radical leader] Pannella calls 
journalists peasants, they leave the room, quite properly. But 
it is the same journalists who are delighted when one political 
calls another a "chicken thief." I am starting to find it 
intolerable that in order to engage in politics you have to 
suffer insults that would be considered unacceptable in other 
fields. I wonder, is there a possibility of establishing 
certain standards? Maybe in the future. At present the 
standards are different -- those established the other evening 
on television throughout Italy.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, said that 
the best opportunities and environment exist for foreign 
investment in Pakistan and foreign investors can earn remarkable 
profit there. She stated this while addressing a crowded news 
conference at the Congress Media Center of the World Economic 
Forum in the Swiss city of Davos yesterday. Benazir Bhutto said 
Pakistan, as a developing country, wants to spend its human 
resources and limited mineral resources to eradicate poverty, 
diseases, and illiteracy. The prime minister said Pakistan has 
really become a suitable country for investments, where foreign 
investment is not only safe but the percentage of profit is also 
very high. Investments can be taken out of the country without 
any hindrance. She said we are relaxing the rules and 
regulations on economy in order to promote investments in the 
country and also are lifting the remaining government controls. 
She said Pakistan is situated geographically on an important 
location between the newly independent Central Asian states and 
the Gulf countries and it provides the best and the least 
expensive route for access to these fast developing markets. 
Referring to Pakistan's steps for forging close commerical ties 
with Central Asian states, she said projects are on the anvil to 
establish rail and road links between Pakistan and Central Asian 
states. She said investors from Japan, Turkey, and Singapore 
have offered assistance in these projects. 
  She said Pakistan has come ahead as a democratic, 
progress-loving, and Islamic nation. The recent elections, 
which have been recognized at the international level as the 
most fair and transparent elections in our election history, 
have made it clear that there is no place for retrograde and 
conservative tendencies in Pakistani elections. The prime 
minister made it clear that Pakistan's foreign policy is based 
on peace and justice in our region and stability in the world. 
She emphasized that durable peace cannot be established in an 
atmosphere of injustice, exploitation, and foreign hegemony. 
  Referring to India's continued aggression in Jammu and 
Kashmir and its atrocities on the Kashmiris, the prime minister 
said India is constantly negating a meaningful dialogue to 
resolve this dispute in accordance with UN resolutions, which 
call for holding a plebiscite. In response to a question on 
Pakistan-India talks on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and the 
support for appeal to observe total strike on 5 February, Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto said the appeal for a strike has been made to 
protest against India's continuous aggression on Jammu and 
Kashmir; its inhuman acts of atrocities on Kashmiri men, women, 
and children; and lack of initiative from the Indian side to 
resolve this dispute. She said that she agreed to the 
secretary-level talks between Pakistan and India as the talks 
were deadlocked for the past 18 months. This is the first 
occasion that India held talks on the Kashmir dispute as a 
separate item of the agenda, but India has not halted the series 
of atrocities in Jammu and Kashmir. She said Pakistan has 
earned its independence through political process as well as 
struggle and hence it cannot keep aloof from the struggle of the 
Kashmiris to realize their right of self-determination. India 
is also committing gross human rights violations in Jammu and 
Kashmir. These facts prove that India is not desirous of any 
sort of initiative for resolving the Kashmir dispute. That is 
why an appeal has been made to observe total strike in Pakistan, 
Azad Kashmir, and occupied Kashmir [as heard]. Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto said Pakistan wants the resolution of this dispute on the 
basis of UN resolutions as it supports the objectives and 
activities of the United Nations. 
  Pakistan had supported the UN resolutions on Kuwait, 
Somalia, 
and Bosnia and the activities carried out there under its 
auspices. Pakistan supports the peace accord reached between 
Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. She said serious 
attention will be paid to Israel-Syria talks on Golan heights. 
The relations of Islamic countries with Israel in future will 
depend upon the outcome of these talks. On Bosnia, she said 
Pakistan has offered to provide assistance to Bosnian Muslims. 
She said herself and her Turkish counterpart, Ms. Tansu Ciller, 
will soon visit Sarajevo to express solidarity with Bosnian 
Muslims. She said the dispute in Bosnia should be resolved in 
accordance with the UN resolutions and Muslims should be 
protected from massacres and other crimes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nuclear Dealers of Russian Mafia </F>
Were on Board"] 
  [Text] Is Lake Constance contaminated by radioactive 
Cesium-137? Yesterday the police had to discontinue the search 
for the wreck of a crashed Cessna aircraft because of a storm. 
  Josef R. (54) and Klaus E. (54), nuclear dealers from 
Berlin, 
were on board the aircraft. In October they bought 70 kg of 
cesium from the Russian mafia in Riga. They agreed on a price 
of 2 million German marks. 
  Since they did not pay, the mafia took Josef R. hostage. The 
German Embassy in Moscow asked the Russian police for help. 
After 26 days, Josef R. was freed from prison. 
  Shortly afterward, the nuclear smugglers took the cesium to 
Prague. According to police investigations, Klaus Peter N. (48) 
from Berlin, former lieutenant colonel of the GDR criminal 
investigation department and Mielke's confidant, organized the 
deal. Since Monday night he has been detained and he is being 
interrogated. 
  On Monday, Pilot Rudolf W. (44) from Cologne flew from 
Hannover to Prague. There the two nuclear smugglers from Berlin 
went on board with two young Czech women. They headed for the 
West. According to the tower of Friedrichshafen Airport, the 
radio contact broke off at 1912. A little later, the Cessna 
presumably crashed into Lake Constance. Marlis R. (39), the 
pilot's companion in life, said: "The flight was first bound for 
Switzerland and then for Paris. The two businessmen had a date 
there -- in a laboratory, as my boy-friend said." 
  Question: Did the smugglers want to have the cesium examined 
there by an expert? Were the customers waiting there? 
  The causes of the crash are still unclear. However, the 
police think that an act of revenge by the Russian mafia is 
possible. It had threatened the Berliners: "You will not live 
long." 
  The search for the wreck with the radioactive cargo will be 
continued today.

<F P=106> [Article by Paavo Rautio and Pekka Vuoristo: "Center and </F>
Conservatives Unlikely To Throw Support"] 
  [Text] Leading figures in the two largest nonsocialist 
parties believe that most of their supporters will get behind 
Swedish People's Party candidate Elisabeth Rehn in the second 
round. However, the Center Party is even more unlikely than the 
Conservatives to give its voters any kind of recommendation as 
to how to cast their ballots. 
  There are over a million votes to be gotten from those who 
backed [defeated] Center Party candidate Paavo Vayrynen and 
Conservative Party candidate Raimo Ilaskivi. 
  Forces working for Social Democratic Party's Martti 
Ahtisaari 
went immediately into action on Monday [17 January] to ward off 
the threatening danger. SDP [Social Democratic Party] Member of 
Parliament Kari Rajamaki declared Rehn the candidate of 
far-right capitalist circles and reminded that she is a minister 
in a government carrying out "an unjust social and economic 
policy." 
  Similar expressions were heard in the stance taken by the 
governing council of the National Labor Confederation's 
Construction Workers Union. It believed a Rehn victory would 
amount to a power-of-attorney letter for the present 
government's economic policies, while Ahtisaari represents the 
welfare state and common responsibility. The union board has a 
Leftist Alliance leadership that is known to have been favorable 
to Ahtisaari all along. 
<H5>  Rehn Spirit in Center Party </H5>
  The Center Party leadership will weigh its stance regarding 
the second round in a party council meeting on Thursday. The 
council is not expected to throw its support to another 
candidate for the second round. 
  "This is hardly necessary," stated Center Party Secretary 
Erja Tikka. According to Tikka, the overwhelming majority of 
Center Party voters are going to back Rehn without any prodding. 
  Center Party Chairman and [Prime Minister] Esko Aho, while 
following election returns on Sunday, let it be understood that 
he is going to vote for Rehn. That party's provincial press also 
began immediately on Monday marshaling forces behind Rehn's 
candidacy. 
  If all of those who voted for Vayrynen decided to support 
Rehn in the second round, she would get a good 6O,OOO votes. 
  The Center Party does not intend to punish editor Keijo 
Korhonen nor Member of Parliament Eeva Kuuskoski for splitting 
the party vote. It is only hoped in the leadership that Korhonen 
and Kuuskoski will consider how they behaved. 
  Both Korhonen and Kuuskoski stated on Sunday that they do 
not 
intend "to bequeath" their votes to anybody. 
<H5>  Conservatives Also Unlikely To Adopt a Position </H5>
  Conservative Party Chairman Pertti Salolainen stated that 
most Conservatives will support Rehn in the second round. 
  The Conservatives' Party Governing Board will discuss the 
campaign situation on Wednesday, but according to Party 
Secretary Pekka Kivela, it is unlikely to take a stand on a 
candidate. On the other hand, it was not denied that a stand 
would be taken. On Monday Salolainen stressed that discussion on 
this issue had not yet started. 
  The reluctance to take a stand as a party is explained among 
themselves by the fact that the party has favored direct 
elections for the presidency. 
  Conservative candidate Raimo Ilaskivi garnered almost 
one-half million votes in the first round. 
<H5>  Haavisto Going To Vote for Ahtisaari </H5>
  The governing board of the Greens discussed its choice for 
president on Saturday in Helsinki. Party Chairman Pekka Haavisto 
predicted that the board will not make a clear choice between 
Ahtisaari and Rehn. It is to be expected that a list of both 
candidates' pluses and minuses regarding most important issues 
for the Greens will be drawn up. 
  According to Haavisto, this is going to be decided because 
Rehn and Ahtisaari are tied in attracting Green votes. 
  Haavisto says he is going to vote for Ahtisaari. In his 
opinion Rehn's stock is continually on the rise with Greens. 
<H5>  Left Alliance Behind Ahtisaari </H5>
  The Left Alliance is preparing to work behind the scenes 
with 
its own defeated candidate Claes Andersson and Ahtisaari 
supporters who differ with him on European Union [EU] 
membership. Party Secretary Matti Viialainen on Monday outlined 
a position according to which the party is in support of 
Ahtisaari. This would not be a vote recommendation, but in it 
the party would express its view that Ahtisaari is the candidate 
who would most creatively and decisively manage Finland's 
foreign policy. 
  The party board will decide the issue on Wednesday, and 
Viialainen assumed that coming to a decision will be difficult. 
However, making the decision less onerous than it would 
otherwise be is that both candidates are in agreement on Europe 
policy. The EU question divides the Left Alliance, and it was 
felt in advance that the party would have a hard time taking a 
position if one candidate had been a Social Democrat and another 
an opponent of EU. 
<H5>  Christian Party Supporters Have Problem With EU </H5>
  In the Christian League, the pro-Europe stands of Ahtisaari 
and Rehn are causing an opposite phenomenon than that in the 
Left Alliance. 
  According to the view of Party Secretary Jouko Jaaskelainen, 
the party is going to have a hard time taking a position 
precisely because neither candidate's opinion on the European 
Union corresponds to the view held by the Christian League or 
its [defeated] candidate Toimi Kankanniemi. 
  The Christian League governing board will discuss the 
election today, but according to Jaaskelainen, it is not going 
to give any recommendations. If any recommendations come, they 
will be given by individual political figures, he stated. 
<H5>  Rural Party Won't Bequeath Sulo Aittoniemi's Votes </H5>
  Rural Party [SMP] Secretary Timo Soini said that his party 
is 
not going to make any definite vote recommendations. He 
suspects, however, that some party leaders are going to state 
their choice in advance. 
  The SMP will discuss possibly taking a position at a 
governing board meeting on 26 January. 
  Soini also believes that among SMP voters Rehn has strong 
support--mentioning veterans and active military personnel. 
Soini also believes that the hardships of Rehn's personal 
history will sound a note in SMP ranks.

<F P=106> [Hugo Pedersen report: "First Oil Find in Barents Sea"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Statoil has made a small oil find in the Barents 
Sea. It is the first time that such a find has been made in the 
area. 
  The oil was found northeast of the North Cape only 40 km 
from 
land, in completely new geological formations. Next week 
Statoil will test the find to see whether oil production is 
possible. 
  According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, the field contains 
only 4 to 5 million tonnes of oil. However, development in the 
Barents Sea needs a field containing 50 to 500 million tonnes of 
oil. But the fact that for the first time oil that can be 
exploited has been found in the region is very positive for the 
Barents Sea's future. 
  "The drilling rig, Ross Rig, has found oil in block 7128/4 
off the coast of Finnmark and we will now test this find to find 
out whether it is profitable. If the oil can be exploited, we 
are talking about a relatively small find," Statoil information 
chief Wenche Skorge said. 
  "The most interesting thing is that the find is the first in 
the region, and the first that has been made using this search 
model. The presence of hydrocarbons has been demonstrated in a 
stratum of porous flint which is around 250 million years old. 
This is approximately 100 years [as published] older than rocks 
of the the Jurassic period in which oil has generally been found 
on Norway's continental shelf," she said. The oil find has been 
made in a well which will be drilled to a depth of 2,500 meters. 
  Oil Directorate information chief Jan Hagland confirmed to 
AFTENPOSTEN that traces of oil have been found, but that it is 
thought to be marginal find. 
  The find was made at the last minute, and in the very last 
drilling operation on this part of the Norwegian continental 
shelf. Most oil companies have abandoned their expensive 
exploratory operations in the Barents Sea, after decades of 
drilling without result. A total of over 50 exploratory wells 
have been drilled in the region, and hitherto only gas has been 
found. The Statoil find could therefore have major 
repercussions, particularly since the authorities are now in the 
process of completely changing the rules for drilling in the 
Barents Sea. 
  "If there does turn out to be oil in the find, it comes at 
the absolutely right time. It tells us that we should not 
abandon the Barents Sea. There is still a lot of work to do in 
the region -- for example, several new exploration models must 
be tested," he said. Hagland stressed that this, together with 
the signals contained in the new Oil Report, could trigger great 
optimism about the Barents Sea, although we should continue to 
be prepared for disappointments. The Barents Sea is a very 
complicated area in which to search for oil. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Ylva Nilsson report: "Belfrage Showed Maps"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- Sweden's chief negotiator in the 
negotiations with the EU [European Union], Frank Belfrage, put 
on an exhibition of maps for the EU's representatives when they 
met for negotiations yesterday morning. 
  The maps were of Norrland and were intended to give an idea 
of how large and sparsely populated this part of the country is. 
  Sweden failed to complete any chapters in the negotiations 
at 
yesterday's meeting. 
  The chapter concerning indirect taxation was raised but here 
the negotiators still have the problem of how much spirits and 
tobacco Swedes will be allowed to take home with them after a 
trip abroad. Sweden wants to retain the current allowances for 
between three and seven years, with the possibility of extending 
this period. The EU is proposing allowances of an additional 
half liter of spirits, 5 liters of wine, and 15 liters of beer 
to apply for a shorter period. 
  "I believe that we can reach a compromise here. The most 
important thing for us is that we have the right to review 
(read: extend) the rules after the end of the transitional 
period," Belfrage said after the meeting. 
  Another problem is the duty on cigarettes where the direct 
introduction of the EU method would mean a hefty price increase 
for Swedish smokers. 
  According to Belfrage, this problem can be solved without 
any 
change in cigarette prices -- for example, through a reduction 
in purchase tax or a decrease in profits by tobacconists. 
(Swedish tobacconists make 17 percent per packet as against 8 
percent for EU tobacconists. 
  The Swedes have received some depressing responses to the 
additional checks against animal and plant diseases that they 
have demanded. The negotiators think that the concession the EU 
has made to the applicant nations in the field of environmental 
regulations (a revision of the EU's own rules) ought to be able 
to be made use of here. 
  Belfrage used the meeting to explain that the inhabitants of 
Norrland are a lot poorer than the GNP figures the Swedish 
negotiators have given to the EU might lead people to believe. 
  For the time being at least the EU negotiators had no 
comment 
to make.

<F P=106> [Tom Hansson report: "No Clarification About Support From </F>
Pangalos"] 
  [Text] "Of course there is a problem. The new member 
countries do not perhaps have a real understanding of us in the 
south. But on the other hand we will have access to your 
market." 
  The EU's [European Union] current president, Greek European 
Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, was careful when he gave a 
short press conference in Stockholm yesterday. 
  To give the appearance of concern over the fears of northern 
dominance during his first visit to one of the Nordic applicant 
countries would hardly have been fitting. 
  "We have had political discussions, but no negotiations," 
Pangalos said, referring to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf 
Dinkelspiel. 
  On Thursday [20 January] Pangalos visited Helsinki. The same 
evening it was time for Stockholm, prior to traveling on to Oslo 
yesterday afternoon. A lightning Arctic tour, intended to sound 
out the political terrain. 
  In the last week a controversial Greek proposal has leaked 
out to the international press. According to this proposal, 
Norrbotten would no longer be given the status of an objective 1 
region -- something that the EU Commission has proposed. 
Instead Norrbotten, like three Finnish and Norwegian regions, 
would receive financial support from a new fund which would take 
account of what are for the EU new criteria, such as sparse 
population and cold climate. 
  This could seem generous. At a press conference with Ulf 
Dinkelspiel on Thursday, Dinkelspiel said that he thought that 
"the Greeks understand and recognize our subdivisions." 
  The problem is simply that the proposal seems to be that the 
new fund will chiefly be financed by Sweden, Norway, and 
Finland. So far the Greeks have neglected to give any more 
detailed description. 
  At yesterday's press conference Pangalos merely said: 
  "It will be financed from the EU budget." 
  He was unwilling to say more. Since Sweden as a member would 
be covered by the EU budget, it remains unclear what the net 
effect of the Greek proposal would be. 
  The Greek EU president admitted that "there are problems" in 
the ongoing negotiations. 
  "Sometimes they are of importance. Like this one about the 
regions. But it can be solved. We will have success, and have 
it now." 
  This success must therefore be achieved in the days around 
10 
to 14 March. This is the deadline for the negotiations which 
are already in time trouble. 
  As well as regional support the main things left on the 
Swedish negotiating agenda are the budget question and 
agriculture. As far as the budget is concerned there are two 
Swedish considerations -- a phasing-in of the Swedish 
contribution, and the position that the GNP criterion "does not 
properly reflect our purchasing power." 
  "On this latter point we have met with a complete lack of 
understanding," Ulf Dinkelspiel said on Thursday. 
  On the central issue of agriculture there is as yet no 
official EU position paper. 
  "We must have such a paper within a few days or a week at 
the 
latest," Dinkelspiel said. 
  Theodhoros Pangalos has so far only promised position papers 
on agriculture and regional support for the meeting with EU 
ministers on 7 and 8 February. This meeting will not take place 
for two weeks.

<F P=106> ["Text" of a letter from Cypriot President Glavkos Klirdihis </F>
to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali issued on 28 January] 
  [Text] Your Excellency, Thank you for your letter of 17th 
December 1993. I did not consider it necessary to reply to your 
question whether my side accepts the principles of the package 
of the Confidence-Building Measures as set out in paragraphs 37, 
38, 42 and 43 of your report of the 1st July 1993, document 
S26026, because as Your Excellency is aware during the talks 
held in New York from 24 May to 1 June 1993, the position of my 
side was that we accepted the proposal made by you i.e. the 
placing of the fenced area of Varosha under the United Nations 
administration including policing and the return of its 
inhabitants and the opening and functioning of the Nicosia 
Airport by the United Nations. 
  We stated clearly then that should the Turkish Cypriot side 
accept the same deal, we would be prepared to discuss in detail 
the modalities for implementing the Confidence-Building 
Measures. For the sake, however, of avoiding any 
misunderstanding regarding my position now, I state 
emphatically, clearly and unequivocally that I accep? the 
principles of the package of the Confidence-Building Measures as 
set out in paragraphs 37, 38, 42 and 43 of your report of the 
1st July 1993 (S/26026) and that I am ready to start talks on 
the modalities regarding their implementation as soon as the 
Turkish side clearly and unequivocally makes the same acceptance. 
  His Excellency Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Secretary-General of 
the United Nations Organization, New York. 
  Your Excellency will recollect that it was clearly stated by 
you that nothing in the deal should contain elements which would 
constitute or could be interpreted as constituting direct or 
indirect recognition or giving either side political advantage. 
  You will also recollect, Excellency, that it was common 
ground that although t?e Confidence-Building Measures were 
necessary in order to facilitate a solution and thus should 
precede the solution, they would not constitute the solution 
itself and that negotiations should continue on the substance of 
the problem. 
  Permit me now, Your Excellency, to refer to the Turkish 
position. Mr. Denktas raising security concerns of his side 
stated categorically that he could not agree to the whole fenced 
area of Varosha to be handed to the United Nations and that he 
wished to retain the part of the area north of Democratia 
Street. With respect to that area he stated that he intended to 
colonise it. 
  On the Nicosia Airport issue his position was that parallel 
to the Nicosia Airport the occupied Tymbou Airport "Ercan" and 
the occupied ports of Famagusta and Kyrenia should operate 
legally. Your Excellency, pointed out that what Mr. Denktas was 
asking was contrary to the rule that nothing in the 
Confidence-Building Measures should imply recognition or give 
political advantage either to the one or the other side. 
  Mr. Denktas insisted that he was not authorised by his 
"Parliament" to negotiate beyond those positions. He had asked 
for 15 days to return home for instructions. He promised that 
he would endeavour to persuade his side to accept the deal as 
proposed by Your Excellency and that at the end of the 15 days 
he would give an answer. 
  During his return, speaking to his "Parliament," he rejected 
the deal as proposed by Your Excellency and did the same when 
addressing the Turkish National Assembly. Since then he 
purported that he could not reply because it was necessary to 
hold "elections." 
  I regret to say, that he has not replied even today in a 
straight forward manner whether he accepts the deal as proposed 
by Your Excellency and in fact after wasting seven months, the 
position is as follows: 
  On the question of the fenced area of Varosha he still 
raises security concerns which he wishes them to be taken into 
consideration. It is clear that he is not prepared to state 
that the entire fenced area of Varosha is to be handed to the 
United Nations alleging security concerns, and at the talks he 
will insist that the area north of Democratia Street must be 
denied to its inhabitants even if they were to return under 
United Nations administration. 
  During my first meeting with Mr. Joe Clark on the 24th 
January, I asked whether Mr. Denktas is prepared to state that 
the entire fenced area of Varosha is part of the deal and Mr. 
Joe Clark did not think that Mr. Denktas would state so. To a 
further question of mine whether Mr. Denktas would raise the 
question at the talks regarding the area north of Democratia 
Street, he felt certain that he would. From what was said 
during my second meeting with Mr. Joe Clark, which took place on 
the 25 January i.e. after Mr. Clark saw Mr. Denktas for a second 
time, I formed the clear impression that Mr. Denktas still 
raises security concerns with regard to the area north of 
Democratia Street. 
  As you know, Your Excellency, the reconstruction of Varosha 
will cost more than one billion dollars and Mr. Denktas is 
asking that Varosha be returned ?nder his administration should 
there be obstacles in the enjoyment of the benefits of the 
Nicosia International Airport by the Turkish Cypriots. The cost 
of rebuilding Varosha, which was looted by the Turkish side and 
was left as a ghost town for almost 20 years to go to ruin, is 
to be paid by the Greek Cypriots who will have to rebuild their 
properties. Which Greek Cypriot will spend money for the 
rebuilding of Varosha knowing that the administration may be 
handed to the Turkish side? 
  Furthermore, Mr. Denktas in his letter to Your Excellency 
raises the issue of "lifting through practical measures the 
embargo that has been weighing so heavily on the Turkish Cypriot 
side" thus again he brings back the question of accepting a 
legitimate status for the occupied ports and airport in the 
north and the indirect recognition of the Turkish Cypriot 
break-away state. 
  Finally, the sixth paragraph of Mr. Denktas's letter to Your 
Excellency may reasonably be interpreted as meaning that, even 
if we were to agree on the Confidence-Building Measures, we 
would have to leave them aside in order to consider how they fit 
into the comprehensive settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus 
problem. 
  Your Excellency will recollect that at the end of the 
negotiations in New York last June, I stated clearly that I 
would not accept to discuss the Confidence-Building Measures 
unless the Turkish side accepted the deal which was proposed by 
you, i.e the total fenced area of Varosha and the functioning of 
the Nicosia International Airport, under United Nations control 
and that the issue of direct or indirect legalisation of the 
occupied ports and airport was out of question and out of the 
deal offered by Your Excellency. That was my position then, 
that is my position now. 
  I do not propose at this stage to make any observations on 
the several other issues Mr. Denktas raises in his letter to 
Your Excellency, until I have clear answers to the following: 
  a. Does he accept, irrespective of the so called security 
concerns, that the entire fenced area of Varosha will be handed 
to United Nations for administration and policing and that the 
Greek Cypriot inhabitants will return to their homes and 
properties? 
  b. Does he abandon any notion that my side should recognise, 
either directly or indirectly through practical measures, a 
legal status of the occupied ports and airport in the north? 
  C. Does he accept that any Confidence-Building Measures 
agreed will be implemented without waiting to see how they fit 
in the integrated, comprehensive and whole solution of the 
Cyprus problem? 
  I would like to draw the attention of Your Excellency to the 
fact that seven valuable months have been lost and that instead 
of discussing the modalities of how to implement the 
Confidence-Building Measures, we are back to where the talks 
broke last June when Mr. Denktas did not accept the proposal 
made by Your Excellency and is still now not accepting it. 
  With regard to the security concerns of Mr. Denktas, which 
he raises in his letter to Your Excellency both in connection 
with the final solution and with regard to the 
Confidence-Building Measures, I wish to point out that there are 
also serious security concerns of the Greek Cypriot Community 
both with regard to the final solution and with regard to the 
Confidence-Building Measures. Since both sides admit serious 
security concerns, it is obvious that we should discuss and 
solve our security concerns before anything else instead of 
finding them as an impediment in every step we make for 
progress. If Mr. Denktas is ready to discuss the security 
concerns of both sides I am ready to join issue. 
  Though I stand firm that the deal as proposed by Your 
Excellency i.e. the entire fenced area of Varosha under United 
Nations administration and the functioning of the Nicosia 
International Airport under United Nations control is accepted 
by me and I am ready to discuss modalities for the 
implementation of the Confidence-Building Measures, 
nevertheless, in view of the non acceptance of the deal as 
proposed by Your Excellency by the Turkish side, and in view of 
the fact that seven months have already been wasted, and in 
order to save time, I propose that until the Turkish side makes 
up its mind on the issue of the Confidence-Building Measures, we 
revert to the discussion of the substance of the problem 
beginning with the security concerns of both sides, which appear 
to be the real obstacle and the thorn in any progress. I 
believe that confidence will be created and progress will be 
fade once the security concerns of both sides are met. 
  Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
  (Glavkos Kliridhis) 
  President of the Republic of Cyprus

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of Turkish Cypriot leader </F>
Rauf Denktas] 
  [Text] Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus, sent a second letter to UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, reiterating that the Turkish Cypriot side 
is ready to discuss the confidence-building measures concerning 
the Cyprus problem. 
  In his second letter, Denktas announced that the Turkish 
Cypriots accept in principle articles 37, 38, 42, and 43, which 
stipulate the transfer of Maras [Varosha] to UN administration 
and the opening of Lefkosa [NIcosia] Airport to traffic. In the 
letter, Denktas also declared that he is ready to discuss the 
implementation of the said articles with Greek Cypriot 
Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis. 
  In a statement to TRT, Denktas charged that Kliridhis found 
himself in a difficult situation after the Turkish Cypriot side 
announced its readiness to discuss the confidence-building 
measures and sent a letter to Butrus-Ghali in an attempt to 
alter the agenda. Denktas pointed out that Kliridhis tried to 
eliminate the guarantee agreements by raising the proposal to 
demilitarize the island. 
  Denktas remarked that following this confusion, he asked Joe 
Clark, UN secretary general's special envoy for Cyprus, to 
clarify the matter and therefore wrote the second letter. 
Denktas added: There is no sense in solving the issue through 
statements without sitting at the negotiating table. As we have 
always stated, if a picture emerges from the negotiating table 
to the benefit of the Turkish Cypriot people, one that 
guarantees the interests and security of the Turkish Cypriots in 
line with the stipulations of the UN secretary general and the 
experts' reports, then our Assembly can say yes to this. If, 
however, such a picture does not emerge, then we can make a 
reassessment. Therefore, we stated and underlined our position 
once more. If the negotiations are to begin, then let them.

  [Text] The text of a letter from President Glavkos 
Kliridhis to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali concerning 
Rauf Denktas' second letter to the Secretary General was 
released a short while ago. The full text of President 
Kliridhis' letter is as follows: 
  Your Excellency: At 2:00 a.m. on 29 January, I received a 
photocopy of a letter dated 28 January 1994 which Mr. Rauf 
Denktas addressed to Your Excellency. 
  I would like to draw Your Excellency's attention to the fact 
that the letter bears the letterhead Turkish Republic of North 
Cyprus [TRNC], Office of the President, and the signature Rauf 
Denktas, President. 
  Your Excellency is aware, of course, of Security Council 
Resolution 541 of 1983 which, in paragraph one of its functional 
section, deplores the declaration of the Turkish Cypriot 
authorities of the secession of part of the Republic of Cyprus; 
in paragraph two it considers the declaration referred to above 
as legally invalid and calls for its withdrawal; and in 
paragraph seven it calls upon all states not to recognize any 
Cypriot state other than the Republic of Cyprus. 
  The Turkish side, completely ignoring Security Council 
Resolution 541, not only has not withdrawn the secession action 
but, what is even worse, Mr. Denktas, in complete contempt of 
Resolution 541 and ignoring the Security Council, signs a letter 
to the Secretary General as president of the TRNC. Mr. Denktas' 
motive is obvious. He intentionally signs his letter to you as 
president of TRNC in order to gain recognition of the secession, 
knowing that by so doing he is violating Security Council 
Resolution 541. 
  It is my steadfast view and position that Mr. Denktas' 
letter 
of 28 January 1994 constitutes another serious violation of 
Resolution 541 and since I would not like to participate, either 
directly or indirectly, in such a violation I must ignore 
completely the existence of Mr. Denktas' letter of 28 January 
1994 and its contents as well as any notification of any 
information which emerges from this letter. 
  Therefore, I respectfully submit to you that, for the 
reasons 
I outlined above, the United Nations should handle Mr. Denktas' 
letter dated 28 January 1994 in a similar manner. 
  Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurance of my highest 
consideration. 
  Glavkos Kliridhis, President of the Republic of Cyprus.

President Rauf Denktas narrowed Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos

<F P=106> [Editorial: "UN Experts Foul Up on Economy"] </F>
  [Text] The proposals of the experts brought to Cyprus to 
examine the UN confidence-building measures [CBM's] have been 
much discussed. But they appear to have raised more queries 
than they resolved. What is clear is that the UN staff imposed 
certain aspects of the measures upon the experts, in such a 
manner as to make what were supposed to be technical questions 
ridiculous precisely from the technical point of view. In 
general, the UN staff appear to have bent over backwards to meet 
every conceivable Turkish objection, to the extent of proposing 
sheer impracticalities. 
  This is most obviously so concerning the experts' economic 
proposals. Why do they state that in the area of Varosha to be 
resettled by the Greek Cypriot owners there should be no banks? 
Why do they say that monetary transactions there will be in 
foreign currency? 
  It is difficult to conceive how Varosha can be resettled and 
developed fully to the benefit of Greek and Turkish Cypriots if 
it is not integrated into the economy of Cyprus. Varosha could 
act as a bridge between the economies of the northern and 
southern parts of the island. But the Cyprus Pound would have 
to be a crucial feature of this process. 
  The Cyprus Pound should be the main currency of the area, 
not 
simply because it is the currency of the Republic of Cyprus, but 
because Turkish Cypriots want to have access to the Cyprus 
Pound. It is the strongest unifying force on the island. 
  For years, Turkish Cypriots have had to suffer the rapid 
devaluations of the Turkish Lira. But over the last week or so 
they have had to put up with a wildly fluctuating Turkish 
currency that has thrown trade into chaos. Confidence in the 
Turkish Lira is zero, and Turkish Cypriots have been screaming 
for a return to the Cyprus currency. Why, then, should the UN 
intervene and say not All reasonable people on both sides of the 
buffer zone would like to trade with the Cyprus pound as the 
main currency. Does the UN listen only to unreasonable Turkish 
Cypriots? 
  The UN proposals are also invalid from another point of 
view. 
It is proposed that the laws by which Varosha will be governed 
are those in force prior to the withdrawal of the Turkish 
Cypriots from government in 1963. The Cyprus Pound was the 
legal tender at the time, so why exclude it from Varosha now? 
  Similarly, there were a number of Turkish Cypriot and 
Turkish 
banks operating at that time. They are still recognised by the 
Central Bank of Cyprus, so it should be possible for the banks 
that were operational in 1963 to function in Varosha. 
  One way out of the currency mess would be for the UN to say 
that both the Turkish Lira (the currency used in the 
Turkish-occupied north of the island) and the Cyprus Pound could 
be used in Varosha. This would satisfy Turkish sensitivities, 
while in practice everyone would be free to use the Cyprus 
Pound. The ridiculous proposals put forward by the UN experts 
simply reduce the credibility of the whole process. 
  The experts should be presenting suggestions to the UN which 
guide the world body towards political solutions that can work. 
it is a two-way process that requires interaction of ideas. 
Unfortunately, the UN seems to have imposed political solutions 
on technical questions, and this just leads to odd proposals. 
It's a bit like the old saying about computers: "If you put 
rubbish in you get rubbish out."

<F P=106> [From the "Opinions" column: "Preparation"] </F>
  [Text] Let us assume that UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali responds to President Glavkos Kliridhis' indirect 
suggestion to reject Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' letter 
because the occupation leader's letter had the logo "Turkish 
Republic of North Cyprus, President's Office." 
  What will happen afterwards? Most likely, after exhibiting 
affecting manners, Denktas will reply to Butrus-Ghali on blank 
paper or even orally. And of course, he will tell him what he 
said in his second negative letter. That is, he will reply 
semi-positively to Butrus-Ghali's question of whether he agrees 
to discuss the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
  Therefore, the ball will be in our court again. We cannot 
throw it back, so we will start playing. That is, we will begin 
discussing the CBM's. This is approximately how ?hings will 
develop and this is why we must stop having illusions: We 
either participate in such a discussion or we do not. And if 
Kliridhis' stance so far has been to discuss the CBM's, then we 
must make preparations now. We must not lose any more time.

  [Text] The policy of secret diplomacy was chosen and has 
already been implemented in the process to promote the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's]. The Americans are moving 
intensely and are the main participants in events behind the 
scenes. 
  Informed diplomatic sources say this policy was adopted 
during one of the frequent meetings between U.S. and British 
diplomats at the Foreign Office last fall. The diplomats were 
coordinating their actions to promote the CBM's after the 
"election" in the pseudostate. 
  With their stance, the U.S. and British diplomats, along UN 
envoys, are proving the accuracy of this information. During 
their recent meetings in Cyprus, the UN envoys avoided meeting 
the country's political leaders and only held talks with the two 
communities' leaders. 
  There was talk in the past of "secret negotiations" but the 
issue resurfaced with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' 
remarks after his latest meeting with the UN secretary general's 
representatives Joe Clark and Gustave Feissel. Following the 
official talks, Denktas seems to have told the Greek Cypriot 
reporters who went to the occupied areas to cover the meeting: 
"Secret diplomacy will follow." 
  Bearing all this in mind, you cannot help but link the 
optimism expressed by Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's 
special representative in Cyprus, immediately after he arrived 
in the Greek capital, the second stop on his tour. 
  Based on official statements and President Glavkos 
Kliridhis' 
briefing of National Council members, there was talk in Cyprus 
of a deadlock. According to the government spokesman: "The 
procedure has ended for now." In his statement, Clark said: 
"There could be progress in the effort toward a Cyprus 
solution." 
  The UN official's statement surprised the common view. Those 
who are familiar with behind-the-scenes events link the 
statement with one of Denktas' references. Asked about the 
prospects for an agreement with Kliridhis, Clark said in his 
statement that they may disagree but in the end they will agree. 
  There is another fact, reported and not denied, that 
strengthens all of the above information. Before their meeting 
with the five UN Security Council permanent representatives at 
the Russian Embassy last Wednesday [26 January], Clark and 
Feissel reportedly "secretly met" U.S. Ambassador Richard 
Boucher at the U.S. Embassy. 
  The U.S. ambassador recently adopted intense activity to 
persuade politicians, economists, and other elements to support 
the confidence-building measures. But he cynically told them 
there is no margin for improvement because Denktas would not 
accept such a thing (the package of CBM's).

  [Text] Commenting on a statement by Turkish Republican 
Party Chairman Deniz Baykal in Xanthi, government spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos said that before making a statement the 
Turkish official should have known the Lausanne Treaty as well 
as international and Greek law. Venizelos added: Baykal and 
the Turkish politicians who visit Greece discover a just state 
that respects human rights. Just like every Greek, the Muslims 
in our country exercise all of their constitutional rights. 
  The spokesman condemned the incidents against the Turkish 
politician, saying that the government condemns any form of 
violence no matter where it is coming from or where is directed.

<F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Karelias] </F>
  [Excerpts] Andreas Papandreou yesterday appeared in a mood 
of self-criticism about his government's "weaknesses" and the 
"imprudence" of government leaders and he thus forestalled the 
expected criticism from many party cadres. 
  At the same time, Mr. Papandreou expressed optimism about 
the 
government course and attempted to prove wrong those who are 
trying, as he put it, "to prove that nothing has changed after 
the elections." 
  The prime minister made his first analytical address after 
the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] victory before the 
party's Central Committee (which dissolved itself in view of the 
party congress which will be held 14-17 April). He expressed 
concern over the showdowns in the upcoming elections [for 
European Parliament deputies and local communal authorities] and 
admitted that the dynamics favor the small parties and this is 
why he put emphasis on the need for the party's reconstruction 
and for a congress that should be open to society. 
  Discussing the first months of PASOK's rule in the country, 
Mr. Papandreou: 

  -  Admitted that the government machinery has 
weaknesses, that there are coordination problems as well as 
different views between government departments and state 
organizations. However, he maintained that "the account is more 
than positive." 
  -  Maintained that, although it is still very 
early, "the people can clearly see that a new leaf is turning 
over for the country," that "the type of administration is 
changing radically," that "there is a government of democratic 
practice and openness as well as of new style and 
character." 
  -  Enumerated the first government activities: 
institutional change in justice, establishment of urban 
transportation organization, tax reforms, fairer distribution of 
[tax] burdens, big reforms in the administration and local 
self-government, gradual reinstatement of those who were 
oppressed, safeguarding of confidentiality in 
telecommunications, establishment of independent organization 
for the management of state supplies, enactment of a merit 
system in the public sector and in hiring for public service, 
and sensitivity toward inequalities, unemployment, and 
corruption. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Papandreou made a brief reference to national issues and 
foreign policy: 

  -  He talked about a "new era" in relations 
with the United States. 
  -  He attributed Turkey's provocations to 
"its tragic economic situation" and "to the struggle of the 
Kurds for autonomy." He also announced that in the next few 
weeks the cabine? will make decisions on "a multifaceted 
defense, economic, cultural, and social shield of the 
country." 
  -  He said that the Cyprus issue is the cornerstone of 
our national strategy and reiterated the doctrine of "joint 
decisionmaking" and of a "unified defense area." On the Skopje 
issue, he contented himself with the phrase "we are trying to 
pass rough dangerous straits." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Following a marathon 11-and-a-half-hour session, the 
Chamber of Deputies decided to form an ad hoc committee to 
investigate former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis and 
former Culture Minister Dora Bakoyianni's possible criminal 
responsibility in the phone-tapping scandal. Out of 275 
deputies, four abstained, 179 voted for, and 92 voted against 
investigating Mitsotakis' responsibility, while six deputies 
abstained, 164 voted for, and 106 voted against investigating 
Bakoyianni's responsibility. 
  The Chamber of Deputies had earlier rejected a proposal 
submitted by New Democracy [ND] deputies to hold a joint debate 
on the phone-tapping issue involving Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou during 1985-1989. The rejection of the proposal 
caused the postponement of the relevant prosecution to be lifted. 
  PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], KKE [Greek Communist 
Party], and Political Spring supported the formation of an 
investigative committee. Political Spring voted against an 
investigation into Bakoyianni's responsibilities in the 
phone-tapping scandal. 
  Addressing the Chamber of Deputies, Mitsotakis and 
Bakoyianni 
denied all charges. Mitsotakis said that the man who revealed 
the issue, Khristos Mavrikis, was paid to implicate him and his 
daughter. He stressed that although he challenged Papandreou to 
accept a joint investigation of the 1985-1989 phone tappings, 
the entire issue should be dropped. 
  Discussing Mavrikis, Bakoyianni said that contrary to 
Mavrikis' allegations, she did not own the house on Arvaniou 
Street during the disputed period. 
  Eleven ND deputies, nine PASOK deputies, two KKE deputies, 
and one Political Spring deputy did not attend yesterday's 
Chamber of Deputies session.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Alisanoglou: "Drilling in Oil Deposit Larger </F>
Than Prinos"] 
  [Text] The NAPC [expansion unknown] Consortium decided 
suddenly to start two new drilling operations beginning 
yesterday in an oil deposit it regarded until now as 
"uneconomic." 
  The deposit is located west of Thasos Island and according 
to 
data the NAPC has (exclusively) the new deposit is larger than 
that of Prinos. 
  The decision of the foreign Consortium was reached in 
Toronto, Canada, in the presence of all the big stockholders and 
confirms TA NEA information, which claimed in 1979-1980 that 
"NAPC has found oil west of Prinos but closed the well for 
unexplainable reasons." The justification offered at the time by 
NAPC that presumably the deposit west of Thasos was small and 
that the return on drilling was to be marginal, was not valid. 
This is borne out now, because the NAPC managers would have 
never spent $15,000 to $20,000 -- if not more -- to conduct 
exploratory-productive drilling operations in a "small" deposit. 
They knew in advance the potential and the daily yield of the 
new oil deposit and they were waiting for the proper time to 
revise their contract while the New Democracy was in office to 
open the "well" of western Thasos with its assured oil deposits 
which for them constituted a safe "reservoir." 
<H5>  The Ministry </H5>
  The Ministry of Industry said this in an official statement: 
  "After a long period of inactivity during the previous 
government, the drilling in `northern Prinos' is now under way 
in the second section of the Prinos oil exploration region. The 
Public Petroleum Corporation and Hydro-Carbonate Exploitation 
[DEP-EKY] is a participant in this region with a 15-percent 
share in the consortium which will undertake the drilling 
according to the revised contract of 9 December 1987 which was 
ratified by Law 1769/1988. 
  "The significance of this drilling is that the potential 
discovery of an oil deposit will extend the life of the existing 
deposit in Prinos while it will require a minimum investment 
since the exploitation will utilize the existing installations 
of Prinos." 
<H5>  The Contract </H5>
  DEP-EKY data indicate that the objective of the drilling is 
"to find out any serious indication for an oil deposit." 
  Nevertheless, trade union circles note among other things 
that, with the drilling taking place without previously setting 
in motion the process for the vision of the law that was enacted 
by the New Democracy shortly before the election, the charges 
and revelations of those being then in the opposition are 
totally wasted. 
  It is noted in this regard that the DEP-EKY management 
should 
have informed the political leadership of the Ministry of 
Industry. With this drilling, an investment of some $15 million 
is being made in effect which according to the law (recommended 
by the then-president of DEP-EKY Goulas) will be paid off 
through the cost of the oil. In other words, in addition to all 
the other concessions we have made, we allow the consortium to 
do this, thereby reducing even further the Greek share. The 
contractor evidently will inflate these costs (as it did in 
Prinos) to keep a greater amount. Moreover, this cost will be 
borrowed and therefore subject to interest payments. 
  Regarding this contract which will result in tens of 
millions 
of dollars in losses for the Greek State, the Association of 
DEP-EKY Personnel (its chairman is a member of the company's 
board of directors) had presented the following charges on June 
22, 1993. 
  a. The consortium tax rate is reduced from 50 percent to 40 
percent. 
  b. The depreciation rate of the consortium is increased 
while 
the percentage share of the Greek State is decreased. 
  Based on the annual extraction of oil, the depreciation rate 
for the consortium ranges from 58 to 90 percent (it was 40 
percent) and the participation share of the Greek State from 20 
percent to 5 percent (it was 30 percent). 
  c. The Greek state will receive its share from the sale of 
oil once a year and not on a monthly basis as was the case until 
now, thereby losing several millions [of dollars] from lost 
interest.

  [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special envoy 
for Cyprus, has been holding contacts in Ankara. 
  Joe Clark first met with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary 
Ambassador Ozdem Sanberk. In a statement he made prior to the 
meeting, Ambassador Sanberk stated that Turkey sees an 
atmosphere of insecurity in Cyprus, and therefore supports the 
confidence-building measures package. 
  Clark, in turn, stated that the solution to the Cyprus 
problem depends on the leaders of the two communities. Clark 
noted that he will submit a report to the UN secretary general 
concerning his visits to Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey. Clark 
further stated that he hopes Turkey will continue to extend its 
constructive help to find a solution to the Cyprus issue. 
  Clark later visited Foreign Ministry Deputy Under Secretary 
Tugay Ulucevik and conferred with him for some time.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still photograph of Prime </F>
Minister Tansu Ciller] 
  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that 
the government will take the necessary steps to eliminate both 
economic and PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorism. 
Contrary to claims by certain circles, Ciller announced that 
the government, in doing this, will act with courage and 
determination, without any ulterior motives, will consider only 
the future of Turkey and the prosperity and happiness of the 
Turkish nation. 
  In a written statement issued today, Ciller stated: From the 
day we established the government, I seized every opportunity to 
announce our determination to end PKK terrorism as well as the 
terror in the economy. It is known that we have displayed this 
determination without any consideration for party congresses or 
elections. [passage omitted] 
  Ciller added: Only yesterday, our brave Turkish Armed Forces 
conducted the biggest and most comprehensive operation of the 
past 10 years and destroyed the Zhalah PKK shelter, 110 km from 
our border. 
  Ciller announced that as a result of this operation the PKK 
sustained great losses from the viewpoint of administration, 
militants, weapons, and ammunition. The support of the Turkish 
people for these efforts aimed at eliminating PKK terrorism is 
well known, Ciller stressed, noting: Friendly countries and our 
allies have also demonstrated through their recent decisions and 
attitudes that they are on Turkey's side on this subject. 
  She said: Given these facts and the support of the people 
for the elimination of both kinds of terrorism, I personally 
fail to comprehend the logic alleging that bombing the Zhalah 
PKK camp was aimed at veiling the adverse affects of the 
decisions concerning the money markets. Advocating such a logic 
would constitute an injustice to the government, to the Turkish 
Armed Forces, and to those who are trying to restore the economy 
by taking steps to continue the free market economy. In our 
opinion, the recent economic operations launched in the money 
markets as well as yesterday's Zhalah PKK camp operation are 
great successes. Both operations were necessary. The two are 
not related in any way from the point of timing. The government 
weighed and used its political will and did whatever was 
necessary in both cases. Our government will take the necessary 
steps to eliminate both the economic and PKK terrorism. 
Contrary to the allegations of certain circles, the government, 
in doing this, will act with courage and determination, 
considering only the future of Turkey and the prosperity and 
happiness of the Turkish nation.

  [Text] Every measure was taken to ensure that civilians 
were not hurt during the operation carried out by the Turkish 
Armed Forces against the Zhalah camp of the terrorist PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization in northern Iraq 
yesterday. At the end of the operation, it was determined that 
no mistake was made in this region. 
  A Foreign Ministry announcement says that Iranian 
authorities 
claim certain Iranian citizens were killed or wounded during the 
operation in the border region inside Iran. The statement points 
out that the operation was not aimed against Iranian territory, 
and that the Iranian authorities had sufficient advance 
information about the intentions, reasons, and targets of the 
operation. 
  The statement says: Every measure was taken during the 
operation in northern Iraq to ensure that no civilians were 
hurt. The technical capability of our planes and the training 
level of our pilots are very well known. Furthermore, a study 
of the photographs taken after the operation and a study of the 
places where the bombs were dropped lead us to determine that 
such a mistake was not made. Nevertheless, we proposed that 
Turkish and Iranian border authorities meet immediately to study 
this issue and that a joint delegation investigate the issue. 
We informed the Iranian authorities that military officials 
will also be included in the Turkish delegation.

  [Excerpt] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has said the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist organization lost many of 
its high-level officials during the air operation Turkey carried 
out against the Zhalah camp. 
  The interior minister was speaking in Tekirdag, where he 
ceremoniously received vehicles donated by private citizens to 
the police force. He pointed out that the cross border air 
operation was extremely successful. He stressed that certain 
circles do not want to see Turkey, which is in a very sensitive 
area, grow and develop. No force can divide our country, he 
said. 
  The interior minister stated that everyone living in Turkey 
is equal before the law and everyone enjoys the same rights. 
There is no discrimination among the citizens, he said, adding 
that 200 trillion Turkish lira [approximately $100 million] will 
be spent this year in the struggle against terrorism. [passage

  [Text] Davos, Jan 30 (A.A) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin on Sunday [30 January] said that a delegation will be set 
up to investigate allegations that nine civilians were killed 
and 19 wounded during Friday's air raid carried by the Turkish 
Armed Forces against terrorist bases in northern Iraq, near the 
Iranian-Turkish border. 
  Cetin said a "joint delegation" will go to Serdest [as 
received] village, in Iran, where allegedly civilians were hit. 
  He was speaking to an A.A. reporter in Davos where he was 
attending the World Economic Forum meetings. 
  He said he held two telephone conversations with his Iranian 
counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati on Saturday on the issue, adding 
he has reassured the latter that the strike was not directed 
against Iranian territory. 
  "According to Turkish military officials no harm should have 
been done in the region, but necessary action will be taken if 
it is determined by the committee that nine were killed and 19 
wounded," he said. 
  He said Iran has not asked for any compensation, but if 
there 
is such a case of civilians killed, Iran should be compensated.

  [Text] Ankara, Jan 30 (A.A) -- In addition to all ground 
targets, under-land hideouts were also destroyed during the 
airstrikes carried out on Friday [28 January] by the Turkish 
Armed Forces (TAF) war planes, a senior military official told 
A.A. on Sunday. 
  Chief of Staff spokesman Colonel Dogu Silahcioglu said that 
all targets in Zhalah have been completely destroyed, adding 
that in line with the confirmation of any information and 
political authorities' directives, the TAF may at any moment 
repeat similar operations. 
  Following close inspection of detailed air photographs of 
the 
region, it was determined that all the targets, including 
training installations, tents, buildings, warehouses, and 
communications bases have been hit and destroyed, Silahcioglu 
said, adding that a total of 132 bombs were thrown at the 
terrorist bases. 
  Accordingly, in line with the number of targets hit, there 
has also been a large number of losses among the terrorist 
members present in the camp at that time, he added. 
  Silahcioglu further said the aim of the operation was to 
incapacitate all the elements of the organization, and this "was 
reached with the destruction of the logistic center, the 
training camp, in a way that cannot be repaired." 
  Answering a reporter's question on whether northern Iraqi 
officials were warned or not, Silahcioglu said that Turkey has 
in the past repeatedly warned the northern Iraqi officials, that 
the terrorist targets in the region may be hit at any moment.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Gurkan Sari from Xanthi] </F>
  [Text] Republican People's Party [RPP] leader Deniz Baykal, 
his delegation, and former independent deputy from Xanthi Ahmet 
Faikoglu were attacked by fanatic Greeks in Xanthi in western 
Thrace. 
  On the second day of his visit to western Thrace, Baykal 
visited Mufti Mehmet Emir Aga in his home. Fanatic Greeks 
demonstrated when the bus carrying Baykal, his delegation, and 
journalists arrived in Xanthi. While Baykal was replying to 
questions by Greek journalists, the demonstrators attacked Ahmet 
Faikoglu. Greek police manhandled the Turkish journalists who 
were trying to capture these incidents on film. Some of the 
journalists were stranded in Faikoglu's office. 
  The demonstrators then threw stones at the bus carrying the 
delegation. Speaking at the Turkish Union in Xanthi, Deniz 
Baykal said: The stones hurled at the bus show the oppression 
to which the Turkish identity that we want to keep alive is 
subjected. 
  In an earlier speech in the village of Gokceler, Baykal 
pointed out that if the western Thrace Turks are approached with 
a new understanding, they could constitute a bridge between 
Turkey and Greece. He noted that it is not customary for 
Turkish politicians to show an interest in or support western 
Thrace, adding: For some reason, we have always refrained from 
talking about western Thrace. Turkish politicians think that if 
they show an interest in western Thrace they might hurt our 
friendship with Greece. We must overcome this. We want to be 
friends with Greece. We will be friends with Greece but not at 
the cost of the Turkish identity, faith, and language of the 
150,000 people living here.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Excerpts] Meeting the press in Istanbul today, Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller said the latest economic decisions were 
made because the Turkish lira had been revalued too much during 
the past five years. This also widened the gap between exports 
and imports, she said, adding that it would have been wrong to 
keep the foreign exchange rate low through artificially high 
interest rates. She stressed that it would not be valid to 
implement authoritarian measures in a free market economy and 
that keeping the economy under forcible control would mean 
running a dictated economy. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] [passage omitted] The rate of 
exchange may fluctuate. The important thing, however, is the 
revenue on the Turkish lira. I have always said this. Those 
who invested in the Turkish lira in 1991-93 profited more than 
those who invested in foreign exchange. For example, those who 
invested in Treasury bonds last year received 89 percent, while 
those who invested in the U.S. dollar received 71 percent. In 
other words, those who bought government bonds gained some 18 to 
20 points more than the others. Our people seem to be 
calculating their profits on a daily basis. One cannot do that. 
The government bonds with the shortest term are three-month 
bonds. You must invest for three to six months, and you must 
compare the price after six months. You must not make daily 
calculations. The rate of exchange fluctuates; the stock market 
goes up and down. I have always said and will continue to say 
this: If you want a risk-free and high-yield investment under 
the present conditions, you must invest in state bonds. [end 
recording] [passage omitted] 
  The prime minister pointed out that the adjustment of the 
rate of exchange will not have a great effect on the rate of 
inflation, because 25 percent of all goods are imported. Thus, 
she added, the devaluation will be reflected in the yearly rate 
of inflation as 3 to 4 percent. Therefore, nobody should think 
that a great wave of price hikes is coming, she stressed. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] If the economy could be repaired in 
one or two days, we would have done it. If it were so easy, we 
would have done it. Was the situation not the same in June? A 
certain period of time is needed to repair the economy; 1994 
will be a year of repairs; 1995 will be a better year; 1996 is 
the election year, and it will be much better. If this house 
has collapsed, then we will repair it. We need a certain period 
of time: 1994 will be that time, the year of repairs. [end 
recording] [passage omitted] 
  Ciller said the regional countries were not informed about 
the time and date of the air operation into northern Iraq, but 
were repeatedly alerted to the fact that terrorists were being 
trained in the Zhalah camp and that it was providing the 
terrorists with logistic support. She stressed that the Zhalah 
camp is 110 km from the border and 550 km from the area where 
the planes took off. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] While extending humanitarian aid to 
Kurdish leaders Barzani and Talabani, and while negotiating 
within the framework of our cooperation, we repeatedly alerted 
them. We said we are continuing with our aid, but that we have 
certain ideas. Talabani told me that the area in question is 
not under his control. The operation was prepared very well 
over months. When the state decided that it was time to carry it 
out, I made the political decision. Those who claim the 
operation was linked to the devaluation do not know the first 
thing about how the state mechanism works. [passage omitted] 
  In addition to the peace process between Israel and 'Arafat, 
the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] issue has also been 
included in the U.S. Middle East policy. This is extremely 
important. The United States has also agreed in principle to 
follow this issue at the State Department level. In other 
words: 1. This is the first time the United States is including 
the PKK in its Middle East policy; 2. The United States has 
instructed the State Department to follow this issue. This is 
extremely important. [end recording] 
  Replying to a question, Ciller said that she is going to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina because this is a humanitarian and not a 
Muslim-Christian issue. Asked to comment on reports that the 
United Nations will not do much to safeguard her security in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ciller said: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] [passage omitted] If I have a duty 
to perform, I will do it regardless. That is not our problem; 
it is a UN problem. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by Smadar Peri </F>
at the Prime Minister's Office in Ankara; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Peri] Madame Prime Minister, in your first 
meeting with President 'Ezer Weizman this week, you told him 
that your top priority is the war against terrorism. Why? 
  [Ciller] We have a problem of internal terrorism, and I will 
neither permit nor tolerate its continuation. We are the only 
secular democratic state in the Muslim world. We have invested 
more than 50 years in securing these achievements, and I do not 
plan to allow those who murder women and children to spoil 
things for us. 
  [Peri] You have already pointed to the common enemy: 
Hizballah. 
  [Ciller] Definitely. Hizballah threatens the security not 
only of Israel but also of Turkey. It is a real problem. I am 
opposed to terrorism in the name of fundamentalism, and 
Hizballah operates under that slogan. 
  [Peri] As the prime minister of a Muslim state, did you not 
have reservations about announcing publicly that you are 
interested in intelligence, security, and strategic cooperation 
with Israel? Your neighboring states follow your every word. 
  [Ciller] I do not care. I am very interested in any form of 
cooperation between us to uproot terrorism by Hizballah and 
others. I am against anybody who tries to harm stability and 
calm. I do not care if they know Israel and Turkey are 
cooperating against Hizballah. 
  [Peri] What kind of strategic cooperation are you 
considering? 
  [Ciller] In intelligence and security, and in any other 
field 
in which there can be cooperation between professional and 
experienced institutions and organizations. 
  [Peri] With your permission, let us try to analyze President 
al-Asad's possible reaction to your remarks. Israel complains 
about Syrian aid to Hizballah, and you are now in fact proposing 
Israeli-Turkish cooperation against Syria. 
  [Ciller] I definitely support the peace process and good 
relations with Israel. We are interested in assisting in the 
process. In my view, Syria is a key state in the process. The 
key to progress in the negotiations lies with al-Asad. That is 
why we must find a way to make it attractive to him and convince 
him that real peace pays. 
  The Syrians, however, abet terror in Turkey, and they also 
bother you. We, for our part, are willing to do anything to 
encourage Syria to take the path of peace. I get the impression 
that Israel does not need to be encouraged in this. 
  I suggest bilateral strategic cooperation. With your 
experience and expertise, it pays us to look for common points 
and pool our resources. 
  [Peri] I am sure that Tehran is also interested in the plans 
for Israeli-Turkish intelligence cooperation. You have a large 
Iranian Embassy here. Have you tried to send out feelers about 
a dialogue with Israel? 
  [Ciller] I do not believe I or my government should act as 
an intermediary between Israel and Iran, unless both sides ask 
for it. 
  [Peri] Do you actually conduct a dialogue with the Iranians 
in Ankara? Do they not have reservations about the fact that a 
woman is prime minister? 
  [Ciller] The main thing is that they do not interfere with 
us. We have 24 ethnic groups in Turkey, and the terrorists 
murder my citizens in cold blood. I am not prepared to accept 
such despicable murders. 
  I will tell you something: Before each action, the 
terrorists make sure they rid the area of journalists so that 
there will be no witnesses or proof of their deeds. That was 
the case in southeast Anatolia. They want to take over by force 
and chip away chunks of Turkey for themselves, and they threaten 
to murder the women and children of those who hinder them. 
  [Peri] And if you are prevented from selling water to 
Israel? 
  [Ciller] I tell you: I will do whatever I decide with our 
water. We have the water sources, and we will sell water to 
whomever we like. Nobody will decide for me or dictate to me to 
whom to sell our water. I am not prepared to accept threats. 
  We will sell water to Israel, and we are also prepared for 
activity with Israeli antiterror experts. 
  [Peri] You are most likely following the reservations our 
decisionmakers are having about President al-Asad. Israel does 
not know what he really meant when he said "peace." Do you 
understand us? 
  [Ciller] Definitely. I believe Syria could have helped in 
the struggle against terrorism, but it prefers not to. What I 
have just said is an understatement. I know that you complain 
about precisely the same thing. The solution will be found when 
we manage to convince al-Asad that he will be better off without 
terrorism and that he will lose if he does not cooperate.

  [Text] Ankara, Jan 29 (AFP) -- Two reporters from the 
private Turkish television network TGRT were kidnapped in 
Kurd-dominated southeast Turkey, a senior TGRT official said 
Saturday [29 January]. 
  Kutlu Esendemir and Recep Ozturk had been preparing a 
television program in the region for the past week, TGRT 
official Erdal Celebi said. 
  The pair last contacted the network on Wednesday, when they 
left the Sulak police post in the Sirnak region, near the Iraqi 
border, heading toward Guclukonak, in the same region, Celebi 
said. 
  Celebi blamed the kidnapping on the Kurdistan Workers Party, 
the separatist movement which launched an armed rebellion 
against the Turkish government in 1984.

  [Text] Ankara--The two deputy chiefs of Turkey's National 
Intelligence Organization (MIT) were reassigned on Monday [24 
January] and will be serving this intelligence body abroad as of 
now. Sources said no new appointments had yet taken place to 
fill the seats of deputy MIT undersecretaries Emre Taner and 
Ertugrul Guven. Guven was reassigned to a major European 
country whereas Taner will be serving in the Mediterranean 
region. Their new positions cannot be identified for security 
reasons. TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] sources said the reshuffle 
would continue and two of the organization's most senior 
department chiefs will soon be reappointed as well. 
  Intelligence sources said there was no change in the 
position 
of MIT undersecretary Sonmez Koksal. Koksal was appointed to 
his position last year after serving his country for years as a 
veteran diplomat, and there has been speculation since Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller took office that he would be removed under 
pressure from hardliners from the military. 
  Koksal, Turkey's permanent representative at the Council of 
Europe and former ambassador to Baghdad, was the first civilian 
to be appointed as undersecretary of the MIT. 
  Last June, there were reports that hardline officials in the 
organization had arranged to undermine his position on the 
grounds that he represented moderation. 
  There was speculation that Ciller was prepared to start her 
reshuffle in MIT by replacing Koksal with an army officer. Many 
of the MIT's former employees are accustomed to strict military 
discipline. The organization's headquarters in the Yenimahalle 
District in Ankara is the second facility in the world where all 
intelligence operatives live together. The first such example 
was in the former Soviet Union, where the State Security Service 
(KGB) literally controlled the entire daily life of its 
operatives. 
  The compound is surrounded by high walls and guarded closely 
by civilian and military officials armed with machine guns. One 
of the problems for Koksal since the day of his appointment has 
been the past role of the organization which he heads in the 
buildups to military coups. 
  Despite a law which says the MIT chief is attached to the 
prime minister and that the organization has no jurisdiction and 
is authorized only to gather intelligence and/or prevent others 
from doing the same on Turkey, this has not worked out in the 
past. 
  Coming from within the ranks of the military, previous MIT 
chiefs have always known where their priorities lay. Never has 
any of them informed the civilian management of military 
preparations to take over the country. The files of all of 
their personnel have always been kept at the Chief of General 
Staff's office instead of the civilian administration. It is 
these files that affected their promotions and future 
appointments. But sources have said that, with Koksal, 
everything has started to change. Being a career diplomat, he 
spoke more freely. He always distanced himself from the 
mainframe military mentality. And, with his highly 
sophisticated behavior, he managed to work in full harmony with 
the civilian management.

<F P=106> [Report by Mehmet Salih Ceviker] </F>
  [Text] Istanbul--It has been discovered that the 
counterguerrilla organization has targeted a great number of 
Kurdish businessmen for assassination. There is evidence that 
the Kurdish businessmen--including the singer Ibrahim Tatlises, 
Idris Ozbir, Halis Toprak, and Necdet Ulucan--have been targeted 
because they allegedly have been providing enormous financial 
assistance to the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. 
  An official at the Istanbul Security Directorate said Behcet 
Canturk was killed two weeks ago in order to cut off the PKK's 
financial resources. 
  This same official said Inci Baba was killed for the same 
reason. He said: "Inci Baba, who was known to be close to the 
DYP [True Path Party], was killed because, despite warnings from 
the Security Directorate, he continued to harbor `radical views' 
on the Kurdish problem and to provide financial assistance to 
the Kurdish movement." 
  A source close to the National Security Council [NSC] said a 
policy has been adopted to pressure and even to kill "those 
persons who fetter the state in its policy on the Kurdish 
problem." Such people will be cowed by linking them to the ASALA 
[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia], PKK, and 
mafia. Recently, the Kurdish businessmen have been placed under 
constant surveillance and their books have been scrutinized by 
the tax inspectors. 
<H5>  Tatlises Also Targeted </H5>
  The famous singer Ibrahim Tatlises is on the top of the list 
of names targeted by the counterguerrillas. The latter are 
planning to kill Tatlises as part of the operation that started 
with the murder of Canturk. 
  A source told AYDINLIK: "They [the Turkish officials] are 
very determined. They will either intimidate or eliminate those 
who even give a single coin to the PKK. They see as their 
target all those individuals and organizations that provide, or 
are suspected of providing, financial assistance to the PKK." 
This source added: "Ibrahim Tatlises is attracting too much 
attention. He is on the top of the list that has already been 
drawn up. They might give it the appearance of an accident. 
The only thing preventing them from carrying out this act is 
Tatlises' popularity." 
  When informed by AYDINLIK that he is one of the targets, 
Tatlises said: "Why should they target me? What is my crime? 
I have committed no crime. It is not a good thing to die for 
nothing." 
  Asked to comment on Canturk's assassination, Tatlises said 
he 
does not even know Canturk's profession, adding: "I do not know 
what his profession was and why he was killed. You should ask 
his family. They must know their friends and foes." Tatlises 
then added: "I would be happy if am going to be the second man 
to be killed after Behcet. But, there is no reason to warrant 
my killing."

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Who Says People Won't Vote for </F>
Refah?"] 
  [Text] On Sunday [23 January], Prime Minister Tansu Ciller 
met for a "chat" with some of the TV stations and newspaper 
representatives who have been supporting her since the very day 
she was elected prime minister by the True Path Party (DYP) 
convention last June. Ciller's remarks, carried by the press, 
once again confirm that this lady does not understand the 
cybernetics of her own country and that we will all have to 
endure this unfortunate period in Turkish political history for 
the time being until she is forced out of power one way or 
another. 
  Ciller told her journalist friends that the people of 
Istanbul would not vote for the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (Refah 
Partisi-RP). If she is really sincere in this belief then we can 
only shudder at this revelation of her ignorance of the 
realities of Turkey. 
  Is Ciller aware that those people she said would not vote 
for 
the Welfare Party actually elected four pro-Islamic mayors in 
districts of Istanbul in the local elections held in only six 
districts in 1992? Is Ciller aware that public opinion polls 
show the RP running neck and neck with the Motherland Party and 
her own DYP in the public opinions polls for Istanbul? Is 
Ciller also aware that her gross mistakes and incompetence have 
disenchanted the masses and people are turning their backs on 
the DYP? Many conservative people who used to vote for the DYP 
are now voicing deep disappointment and say they will neither 
vote for this party nor for the Motherland. Some say they are 
undecided on who else to vote for, while some openly say they 
will vote for the RP. 
  Did Ciller ever stop to think when the successful DYP 
Istanbul district Mayor Gulay Atig quit the party and joined the 
rival Motherland? 
  The RP is being promoted as a "clean and honest" party in 
the 
midst of all the corruption and adversities displayed by the DYP 
and Motherland, but it seems Ciller, living in her own dream 
world, hardly realizes this. People are still talking about 
rumors of the windfall profits made by some people close to 
Ciller during the recent foreign currency crisis... Is the prime 
minister aware that while her top aides are trying to put on a 
brave face in public, they are all privately saying Ciller and 
the government is now in a hopeless state and that things are 
getting worse? 
  Ciller may be in a daydream, but we feel it is time the 
administrators of the DYP distanced themselves from her 
hallucinations and started taking measures to avoid a disaster 
in the upcoming local elections.

  [Text] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan has 
said that his party's mayoral candidates represent brotherhood, 
unity, and integrity, and that the PP will get all the mayoral 
positions in southeastern Anatolia after the 27 March local 
elections. 
  Addressing a party meeting in Ankara, Erbakan said the PP is 
the only party that is active in southeastern Anatolia, and that 
the parties imitating the West have been wiped out of this area. 
He stressed that the problem of terrorism can only be resolved 
through Muslim brotherhood. 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] It is impossible to end terrorism 
through the government's violent methods. The real solution to 
terrorism is the healing power of Muslim brotherhood, and this 
can be done only by the PP. After terrorism is healed, 60 
million people will get real human rights, real freedoms, and 
real justice. That is when happiness will be restored to our 
country. [end recording] 
  Erbakan charged that his party will come to power on its own 
at the end of the first general elections, and that at the end 
of the coming local elections it will get 1,000 mayoral 
positions in Turkey, including most of the positions in the 
greater Istanbul area. 
  Erbakan said: No one believes any more that this government 
will control the economy or defeat terrorism.

  [Text] Ankara--Two of Turkey's top economic decision makers 
have warned that the economy is on the wrong track. 
  They added that an economic crisis might occur in the coming 
years as a result of monetary and fiscal imbalances. "Things 
have turned sour. I am afraid difficult times are ahead of us," 
one senior government economist told a TURKISH DAILY NEWS editor. 
  The same official, one of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's 
closest economic aides, said that economic conditions have 
deteriorated so rapidly that the political authorities might 
soon be deadlocked. He spoke on condition of strict anonymity. 
In a related development, one senior monetary authority 
confirmed to the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that Turkey had no foreign 
currency shortages at the moment. However, he warned that if the 
present trend continues for another two years, the economy will 
have to confront a foreign currency crisis. 
  "The prime minister is right when she says there is no 
currency shortage in the economy. Yet the Turkish economy won't 
endure today's growing foreign account deficits for another two 
years," he said. He also asked not to be named. 
  The Turkish foreign trade gap climbed to an all-time high of 
$11.3 billion in the first 10 months of 1993, compared with the 
original program target of only $8.8 billion. 
  The current account deficit soared to $4.8 billion in the 
January-October period, making the prospect for the balance of 
payments a bleak one. 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller denies that Turkey has foreign 
currency problems. 
  She claimed that the economic management of the coalition 
government will start bearing fruit in 1995.

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew 
tonight highlighted the chance of a positive IRA-Sinn Fein 
response to the Downing Street Ulster peace declaration. 
  Marking an apparent Government change of tone about the 
prospects of hard-line Irish republican acceptance of the joint 
Anglo-Irish statement, he spoke of "a rational ground" for hope 
about the Provisionals' reaction. "We believe we may yet see a 
positive response from the provisionals," he said. "Of course, 
there is a rational ground for hope, because it is so much the 
will of and demand of the people of this island, north and 
south, that after all the declaration calls for nothing to be 
given up by anybody -- apart from violence. 
  "It simply says that constitutional principles shall be 
based 
upon consent and agreement, and nobody is excluded from that 
process, save and except those who hope to bring a bomb or a 
bullet to fortify their arguments." 
  Pressure on Sinn Fein mounted today when the U.S. government 
effectively refused party president Gerry Adams a visa to visit 
a New York conference. 
  A statement in Washington said the White House would only 
consider his application if he publicly renounced violence and 
threw his support behind the Downing Street peace declaration. 
  At the same time, the first of four Sinn Fein "peace 
commission" hearings to gauge reaction to the London-Dublin 
statement within the republican movement was being held in 
Londonderry. 
  Sir Patrick -- speaking after a meeting in Dublin of the 
Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference -- 
also appeared to offer greater scope than before for 
clarification for the republicans of the December 15 document 
signed by Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart 
Albert Reynolds. 
  "I am not aware of any particular part of the document that 
we have been asked to clarify," he said. "I am not inviting a 
request for clarification, but it so happens that nobody has 
said `Look, we don't understand paragraph three,' which is quite 
interesting." 
  Sir Patrick claimed that a letter sent by Mr Adams to Mr 
Major amounted to a request for negotiation rather than 
clarification. He emphasised: "We will continue to make clear 
what the document does and does not do. We continue to make 
speeches that do just that. I do not believe there is anything 
between the two governments on this and I certainly don't wish 
to see anybody under any genuine misapprehension as to what the 
declaration says. What I am not prepared to do is to negotiate. 
I am not prepared to unravel something that has taken as long 
as this has to put together, and which is very clear and 
comprehensive. I will not gloss it and say it means something 
it does not say." 
  The conference meeting, initially set to end early this 
afternoon, went on for more than six hours. 
  In a joint statement afterwards, Sir Patrick and joint 
chairman Dick Spring, Ireland's deputy premier and foreign 
minister, condemned recent violence in Ulster, and said a range 
of issues had been reviewed. 
  Sir Patrick relayed British disappointment at the Irish 
government's recent decision to scrap a 20-year-old ban on 
broadcasting interviews with members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and 
other groups with paramilitary links. A similar ban continues 
to operate in the United Kingdom. 
  Both Sir Patrick and Mr Spring appeared to rule out setting 
a 
deadline for the IRA and Sinn Fein response to the Downing 
Street declaration after today's talks. 
  The Ulster Secretary said: "There is no talk of deadlines. 
The principles are not going to cease to apply come the end of 
month one, two, three or five." And Irish Foreign Minister Mr 
Spring added: "What we are trying to do is of such importance 
that a deadline would not help."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Odinzov report: "Chernomyrdin's Promise"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- "The Russian prime minister gave his full 
and clear confirmation that the reform program will continue, 
even if it does have ups and downs." This short sentence, 
tossed out almost absent-mindedly by Prime Minister Ciampi 
following his talks with Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, 
was the key to reading the joint declaration, which might have 
been a bit unbalanced in its good proposals and readiness if it 
had not actually been upheld and guaranteed by this 
"confirmation." Both the Italians and Russians feel that the 
aim of Chernomyrdin's official visit, which will end this 
evening, was on the one hand to allow Ciampi to check that the 
reform process has not been compromised by conservative 
reticence applied by the new government in Moscow, and on the 
other hand assure the Russian prime minister that the 
continuation of the cooperation agreements with Italy would 
contribute to the reforms. 
  Moreover, Ciampi explicitly emphasized that on the Italian 
side "everything is linked to political developments in Russia," 
thus virtually making bilateral economic cooperation a 
condition. In this way, the joint document turned into a 
declaration of intent which provides for mutual opportunities 
and interests in the future for reinforcing all links and 
agreements, in particular those concerning the energy sector -- 
both petroleum and nuclear -- "via the rapid conclusion of 
negotiations on the new agreement to promote and protect 
investments." "The rapid finalization of this agreement," added 
the document, "which takes account of the significant progress 
made by the Russian Federation toward the market economy, will 
certainly be able to contribute to the growth of reciprocal 
flows of investment and to the intensification of bilateral 
relations." 
  An initial sign of the importance Italy attaches to the 
Russian Federation can be seen in the fact that our country is 
already in second place, after Germany, in bilateral trade. 
There has also been a recent agreement between ENI [National 
Hydrocarbons Institute] and Gazprom -- worth more than $2 
billion -- to supply 5.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas 
between now and 2017. 
  Nevertheless, the path to be followed does not seem short. 
Chernomyrdin and Ciampi have not actually succeeded in 
overcoming the stumbling block of double taxation which is 
crucial to the interest of Italian businesses in joint ventures. 
No progress has been made in restructuring the former Soviet 
foreign debt, and the prime minister committed just a vague 
promise when Chernomyrdin asked him for "Italian support to 
transform the G7 into the G8." For Yeltsin, who will be in 
Naples for the July meeting of the group of the most 
industrialized countries, full membership in this private club 
would be a personal and political success which would confirm 
the West's trust in his program and which would indirectly belie 
the dire predictions made a few days ago by Jeffrey Sachs, his 
chief economic adviser who has now resigned. 
  Indeed, at the G7 meeting in Naples the Italian-Russian 
document seems to postpone the final examination and "the 
occasion to analyze the initiatives under way which aim to 
encourage Russia's progress toward a market economy." 
  Yesterday's talks at the Villa Madama [Foreign Ministry 
venue 
for hosting top-level foreign guests] also tackled the crisis in 
Bosnia (examined by Foreign Minister Andreatta and Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Adamishin) and the Partnership for Peace 
program launched at the recent NATO summit. 
  On this last point the Italians made an imperceptible slide 
toward the Russian idea of favoring the CSCE over the Atlantic 
Alliance for managing security in Europe. Indeed, the joint 
declaration states that the Partnership for Peace aims to 
involve the Alliance in an increasingly close and reassuring 
relationship with eastern Europe with the prospect that this 
partnership will contribute to the expansion and reinforcement 
of European stability and to the creation of a single collective 
system of European security within the framework of the CSCE. 
  With regard to the Yugoslav conflict, while reconfirming 
Russia's pro-Serb position against any use of force, he stressed 
that crisis could only be solved "by political means."

<F P=106> [Article by Tuomo Pieltilainen: "Rehn's Votes Came </F>
Especially From Youth, Women, and High Income Earners"] 
  [Text] The ascendant in the presidential race qualifying 
round, Elisabeth Rehn (Swedish People's Party), got her votes 
especially from high income earners, youth, and women. Rehn's 
success mainly redounded to the disadvantage of Raimo Ilaskivi 
(Conservative Party), and Rehn was moreover the candidate who 
garnered most votes across party lines. 
  The results were analyzed by a Statistics Center report that 
was published immediately after the first stage of the 
presidential election on Monday [17 January]. The Statistics 
Center compared the votes received by the candidates' political 
parties in the last municipal elections and constructed special 
profiles for each candidate. 
  The support for first-round winner Martti Ahtisaari (Social 
Democratic Party [SDP]) derived mainly from areas where the SDP 
is strong, completely different from the pattern in Rehn's 
support. 
  Looking at where the SDP ran strong in the municipal 
elections, Ahtisaari won in Helsinki and Oulu, and in the Kuopio 
and Lapland electoral districts, and did worst in Northern 
Karelia and Kymi electoral districts. In his hometown Oulu and 
in the Kuopio electoral district Ahtisaari won the leftist vote. 
  Ahtisaari also seems to have run strongly among high income 
earners. He was the victor in 67 of Finland's richest 113 
municipalities, and Rehn in 27. 
  Ahtisaari was the winner in most large cities. Some 
exceptions included Espoo, Kokkola, and Vantaa, where Rehn was 
victor. 
<H5>  The Unemployed Favored Paavo Vayrynen </H5>
  Center Party candidate Paavo Vayrynen appears to have been 
the favorite in areas of heavy unemployment. He won in 7O of the 
12O municipalities in which unemployment has grown most rapidly. 
  Second most favored in areas of heavy unemployment was 
Ahtisaari and third was Keijo Korhonen (Center Party). 
  Having campaigned as a strong leader, Vayrynen received 
strong support also from those municipalities in which incomes 
fall below the national average. Vayrynen came out somewhat 
poorly in regions where his Center Party is strong, but did well 
in areas where Center Party strength is weak. 
  Vayrynen's support was greatest in sparsely populated 
agricultural districts. 
<H5>  Ilaskivi Lost in Cities </H5>
  According to the Statistics Center, Ilaskivi did poorly in 
areas in which the personal income level is high and that have 
been the basis of Conservative Party electoral strength. 
Ilaskivi's losses were larger in cities than in less densely 
populated municipalities. 
  Comparing figures for Rehn and Ilaskivi, it appears that 
part 
of the Conservative vote went to Rehn. 
  Korhonen was especially favored in cities, from which he got 
over half his votes. His support was as expected strongest in 
Kainuu, where he took votes from Vayrynen. 
  The Left Alliance lost most votes as a party, compared with 
the 1992 municipal elections. Support for Claes Andersson 
dropped from the figure for the latter elections especially in 
the Lapland, Oulu, and Kuopio electoral districts. The Left 
Alliance voters also deserted Andersson in the northern 
electoral districts of Turku and Pori counties. 
  Support for Pertti Virtanen was slightly larger in cities 
than in rural areas. 
  Eeva Kuuskoski garnered two-thirds of her votes from cities. 
  Finns residing abroad most strongly supported Rehn, who got 
3O.9 percent. Following her were Ahtisaari (29.5), Ilaskivi 
(14), and Vayrynen (12.4). 
  Kuuskoski, Andersson, Korhonen, and Virtanen got small 
percentages of the foreign Finns' vote, and the bottom 
candidates some tenths of a percent. 
  Those casting their ballots in Sweden favored most Ahtisaari 
(33.2 percent), followed by Rehn (32.8). Then came Vayrynen 
(14.4) and Ilaskivi (7.3).

  [Text] The United Nations does not consider that Rauf 
Denktas' first letter to the UN Secretary General includes 
conditions, only assessments and concepts. This came out in a 
statement by Gustave Feissel, the UN Secretary General's 
alternate special representative, upon his return to Cyprus this 
afternoon from Ankara, where he and special representative Joe 
Clark held consultations on the confidence-building measures 
after similar talks in Nicosia and Athens. 
  Asked if it is his understanding that the conditions set by 
Rauf Denktas through his first letter remain in force, Mr. 
Feissel said: I would not say that what is outlined in Denktas' 
first letter fall under the category of conditions. Certain 
assessments and concepts are outlined. However, I would not 
like to comment on them before I discuss them with the two 
leaders. 
  Concerning Denktas' second letter, Mr. Feissel said that it 
is brief and deals with substance. Denktas notes in that letter 
that he accepts in principle the package of measures as 
presented in ?he Secretary General's report. 
  Mr. Feissel described the talks in Athens and Ankara as 
useful. However, he avoided any statement on the substance of 
the consultations, saying that he would first prefer to have 
another round of consultations with President Glavkos Kliridhis 
and Rauf Denktas. He also noted that during his meetings -- 
which probably will be held tomorrow -- he will outline the 
results of the consultations in Athens and Ankara and he will 
discuss with President Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas their 
appraisals of the situation as it has been formulated. Mr. 
Feissel further said that the result of his contacts with 
President Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas will help Joe Clark -- who 
is going to leave Ankara for New York -- to firm up the 
suggestions he will submit to the UN Secretary General. 
  John Paul Kavanagh also returned to Cyprus with Mr. Feissel.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that the 
Cyprus problem cannot be resolved through Turkey's support 
alone. The same support, understanding, and courage must be 
displayed by Greece as well. Cetin met with Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special envoy for Cyprus, in Istanbul this 
morning. 
  In a statement after the one-hour meeting, Cetin reported 
that the recent developments in Cyprus were discussed with 
Clark. Cetin recalled that in his letter to the UN secretary 
general, Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus, announced that he accepts the 
confidence-building measures in principle. Cetin added: 
  [Begin Cetin recording] Kliridhis must do the same. The two 
leaders will meet and discuss the confidence-building measures. 
We want a viable and just solution for Cyprus. As in the past, 
the Turkish Government will continue to contribute to efforts 
made by Mr. Denktas on this subject. [end recording] 
  In turn, Clark remarked that the Denktas announcement that 
he 
accepts the confidence-building measures is an encouraging step. 
Clark noted that he does not doubt that Turkey and the United 
Nations share the same views on the Cyprus question. 
  After his meeting with Clark, Cetin left for the World 
Economic Forum meetings in Davos, Switzerland.

  [Text] Ankara, Jan 30 (A.A) -- Russian Ambassador in 
Ankara, Albert Chernyshev, on Sunday [30 January] said his 
country wants the Montreux Agreement, which regulates the 
passages from Canakkale and Istanbul Straits of foreign ships, 
to be maintained but at the same time understands Turkey's 
concern's on passage security. 
  He said the straits are of vital importance to Russia as 
they 
are the only way for Russian ships to reach the Mediterranean, 
and his country understands Turkey's concern concerning 
Istanbul's security. 
  Turkey has prepared a new regulation draft which aims at 
bringing to the minimum any risks that may threaten ships and 
environmental security, and which brings new regulation for 
ships passing through the straits. 
  Chernyshev also said that Russia is in principle not against 
a possible Baku-Yumurtalik (in southern Turkey) pipeline to 
transport Azeri oil from Azerbaijan and former Soviet republics 
to Europe, adding however that there are two important criteria, 
which are economic and political feasibility. 
  A framework agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan was 
signed on March 9, 1993, stating that the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline 
would be the most economic way to bring Azeri oil to world 
markets. 
  The pipeline has a design capacity of 40 million tonnes per 
year. Azeri oil production over the next few years is not 
expected to exceed 25 million tonnes per year. 
  The extra capacity has been incorporated into the pipeline 
to 
attract oil transportation demand from Central Asian countries, 
mainly from Kazakhstan. 
  Turkey has made plain its opposition to oil being 
transported 
by tankers through the Bosphorus, a route suggested by some, 
because of the risks of environmental damage and the potential 
dangers to Istanbul whose ten million plus residents live on 
both sides of the busy strait. 
  Commenting on the Azeri-Armenian conflict he said his 
country 
sees Turkey as a country that can politically contribute to the 
solution of the problem. 
  On the European Conventional Arms Reduction Agreement, he 
said Russian demands should not be seen as threat against 
Turkey, adding it is not targeting any country. 
  On the nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's remarks 
targeting Turkey he said the former has no political future. 
  Chernyshev said a planned visit by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin expected to take place in March will bring a new 
dimension to Turkish-Russian relations, adding a number of 
agreements are expected to be signed between the two countries 
during this visit.

  [Text] In the Dutch city of Maastricht, the Spanish 
secretary for defense has signed, alongside his German and Dutch 
counterparts, an international cooperation agreement for a 
program to construct F-100 class frigates. 
  According to this agreement, the Spanish Navy will obtain 
four new frigates. The construction of these frigates is to 
start in 1996 and they will be equipped with high-, medium-, and 
low-flying antiaircraft missiles, ground-to-ground missiles, and 
helicopters with air-to-ground missiles and torpedoes.

<F P=106> [Boris Durande report: "European Growth Initiative: </F>
European Investment Bank Is Still Looking for Good Projects"] 
  [Text] "To do more, we need more projects." With this 
observation, European Investment Bank (EIB) President Brian 
Unwin reaffirmed yesterday, during the presentation of the 
financial institution of the European Union [EU], that the 
funding of large-scale EU projects depends more on the 
availability of "good projects," than on the availability of 
funds. 
<H5>  Organization Participating in European Development </H5>
  This is one way to justify the fact that, despite a 
15-percent increase in new loans (reaching ECU19.6 billion or 
approximately 130 billion French francs), the EIB contributed 
only 12 percent of this amount to the European Growth 
Initiative, which was decided during the Edinburgh summit in 
December 1992 and further extended by subsequent summits. 
Actually, the EIB could use only one-fourth of the amount 
initially provided for under this "Edinburgh" financial scheme, 
and the European Investment Fund, which was also approved in 
late 1992 with a view to supporting the Community's economic 
recovery, has not yet seen the light of day. 
  However, through its "normal" activities, the EIB 
contributes 
to European economic development by adhering to priorities 
defined by the European Commission, whereby each of its loans is 
subject to a favorable recommendation by the Commission. Last 
year, its loans represented 2 percent of the overall investment 
effort within the EU (GFCF or gross fixed capital formation). 
The EIB's average financing level reached 30 percent of project 
cost, while the beneficiary projects constituted 5 percent of 
European GFCF. This percentage is markedly higher in the EU's 
four poorest countries (Portugal: 22 percent; Greece: 15 
percent; Spain and Ireland: 14 percent), which receive more than 
one-third of all EIB loans. 
  "Could we have done more?" asked Brian Unwin, immediately 
adding: "Yes, but we cannot invent good projects." The upper 
ceiling of outstanding EIB debts and guarantees is limited by 
statute to ECU144 billion. On 31 December 1993, only 68 percent 
of this amount was used. But "projects must be justifiable on 
economic and environmental grounds, and they have to be 
technically and financially viable," emphasized the EIB 
president, adding that "the quality of the (EIB's) portfolio is 
essential to its reputation as a borrower on the capital 
markets." Thanks to its "triple A" rating, the EIB enjoys the 
best possible borrowing conditions. 
  The EIB's means of action will be increased "in the coming 
weeks" with the establishment of the European Investment Fund, 
which was delayed one year because of the slowness by member 
states in passing the necessary amendments to the EIB statutes 
ratified by their national parliaments.

<F P=106> [Report by LES ECHO special correspondent Gilles Senges in </F>
Finkenwerder, Germany: "Inspired by American Example, Airbus 
Industrie Requests Introduction of Indirect Aid System in 
Europe"] 
  [Text] Following the prohibition of the European system of 
reimbursable loans to the aeronautics industry, Airbus Industrie 
has requested that Europe promptly adopt the new regulations 
imposed by the United States within the scope of GATT. Managing 
Director Jean Pierson, who yesterday delivered the first A-321 
built in Germany to Lufthansa, said: "Since the Americans are 
sticking to their GATT accord, let us do as they are doing; let 
us adopt a system of indirect aid." According to the chief of 
the European consortium, this is a question of political will. 
"Let us organize research and development budgets by 
distributing tasks between Airbus member countries (France, 
Germany, Britain, and Spain) in order to avoid overlap, and let 
us adopt the U.S. system of research contracts, which for us at 
least presents the advantage of not having to make 
reimbursements." 
  In light of the increase in the civil aeronautics budget of 
NASA, the main customer of U.S. manufacturers, by 30 percent to 
$1.1 billion, and that its second-generation supersonic aircraft 
efforts exceed Europe's by a factor of 100, Jean Pierson thinks 
that the message is being heard. 
<H5>  Message Heard </H5>
  Following in the footsteps of French Industry Minister 
Gerard 
Longuet and Transportation Minister Bernard Bosson, German 
Economy Minister Gunter Rexrodt has promised to take measures by 
1995. "The conditions should be the same for everyone, and not 
be detrimental to Europeans." 
  After their recourse to international financial markets for 
the development of the A-321 (for an amount of nearly 3 billion 
French francs [Fr]), the Airbus partners (Aerospatiale, Deutsche 
Aerospace, Bristish Aerospace, and CASA) will finance the A319 
program from their own funds (Fr1.7 billion). "However, we 
cannot rest on our laurels. Now more than ever, we need our 
governments' support to ensure our future and to remain 
competitive," Jean Pierson warned. 
  "As long as the European manufacturer meets our cost and 
performance criteria for the purchase of new aircraft," 
Lufthansa President Juergen Weber said, "we obviously will give 
preference to Europe." The German carrier, which has almost all 
Airbus versions in its fleet, currently is flying 78 European 
aircraft representing a total investment of 8.5 billion Deutsche 
marks, and it is expected to take delivery of another 33 
aircraft. The only Airbus models absent from its inventory are 
the A319 and the A330.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel, currently in 
Switzerland for the World Economic Forum meetings, proceeded 
from Zurich to Davos yesterday afternoon. He first attended a 
meeting on world economic developments in Davos. During the 
meeting, Demirel replied to various questions by representatives 
of leading business circles in the world. 
  In a news conference after the meeting, Demirel commented on 
his contacts. The president reported that during his contacts 
he explained that it is essential to reorganize Europe following 
the dissolution of the Soviet Union and that East European 
countries should be included especially in organizations such as 
NATO and the EC. Noting that he also stressed Turkey's 
importance for the EC, Demirel said Europe can stretch as far as 
Central Asia and China using Turkey as a bridge. He remarked 
that oil and natural gas from Central Asia will be transported 
to the Mediterranean via Turkey and underlined that Turkey will 
become an energy terminal in the future. 
  Answering a question on the air operation launched against 
the Zhalah camp, Demirel explained that the operation was 
conducted after long investigation. He declared that Zhalah had 
replaced the al-Biqa' Valley and 2,000 terrorists were sheltered 
in the camp. Great care was taken not to hurt women and 
children, Demirel added. 
  Demirel will continue his contacts and bilateral meetings in 
Davos today as well.

  [Excerpts] Davos, Jan 30 (A.A) -- Turkmenistan President 
Saparmurad Niyazov on Sunday [30 January] presented President 
Suleyman Demirel and Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin with the work 
on its oil and natural gas pipeline projects for evaluation and 
examination. 
  Speaking to an A.A. reporter following a breakfast he was 
hosting in honour of the heads of state of the Central Asian 
republics and Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Demirel 
said there are two possible routes for the pipeline, one being 
through Iran and Turkey, the other through the Caspian Sea, both 
reaching the Mediterranean. 
  Demirel said that Turkmenistan favours the first choice, 
adding that British, French, German and Turkish companies 
closely follow the developments concerning these project. 
  He said Turkey, in the coming years, will become one of the 
most important energy terminals in the world. 
  Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Turkmenistan's 
Saparmurad Niyazov, Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov, and Pakistan's 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto attended the breakfast. 
  Following the meeting, Demirel received Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres. [passage omitted] 
  Demirel's scheduled meeting with Slovenia's Prime Minister 
Janez Drnovsek did not take place and was cancelled. [passage

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Speaking at a news conference 
today, President Suleyman Demirel said the following about his 
meetings with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and 
Palestinian head of state Yasir 'Arafat: 
  [Begin Demirel recording] I said that this is a golden 
opportunity that should not be missed. An enmity of 100 years, 
of at least 50 years, can be eliminated. This opportunity must 
be used well. Turkey supports all sides to achieve this. If 
closer support from our side is needed, we are ready to give it. 
However, if we interfere without being asked, we might further 
complicate this very difficult and complicated issue. I said 
the same thing to 'Arafat. [end recording] 
  Demirel said that at a meeting with Bulgarian Prime Minister 
Berov today, he stressed the importance of establishing regional 
peace and stability and building the east-west highway that will 
connect Istanbul to the Adriatic Sea over Bulgaria, Macedonia, 
and Albania. 
  At the meeting, Berov categorically denied the reports that 
the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorists expelled from 
certain European countries are basing themselves in Bulgaria. 
  Demirel also attended a meeting on Central Asia today. He 
ended his contacts in Davos today. After spending the night 
here, he will return to Turkey tomorrow.

  [Text] In Davos today, the prime minister, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto, had meetings with the Swedish prime minister and the 
Mexican president. In her meeting with the Swedish prime 
minister, Mr. Carl Bildt, Ms. Benazir Bhutto greatly lauded the 
leading role played by Sweden in safeguarding human rights. PTV 
representative Jaafar Bilgrami reports that Ms. Benazir Bhutto 
briefed her Swedish counterpart about the prevailing situation 
in Kashmir and particularly mentioned the violation of human 
rights in the valley. She also discussed the situation in 
Afghanistan and Central Asia and reiterated that Pakistan would 
continue to work for bringing about peace. She also discussed 
the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and informed the Swedish 
prime minister about her forthcoming visit to Sarajevo, which 
she described as a symbol of solidarity with the people of 
Bosnia. She said Pakistan supports the UN efforts to send 
troops to Bosnia to have a peaceful settlement. 
  Discussing the bilateral cooperation, Ms. Benazir Bhutto 
expressed the hope that Sweden will assist Pakistan in (Bhimari) 
Tunnel project which may open new vistas of closer cooperation 
with Central Asian republics. The Swedish prime minister, Carl 
Bildt, greatly appreciated her participation in Davos conference 
and welcomed the socioeconomic program of her government for 
development and progress. 
  Pakistan's prime minister also held a meeting with the 
president of Mexico, Mr. Carlos Salinas. She briefed the 
Mexican president about the Kashmir issue, the Pakistan-U.S. 
relations, and internal and external policies of Pakistan. She 
congratulated the Mexican president on NAFTA agreement and asked 
him not to discriminate [against] the Third World countries. 
The Mexican president assured the prime minister that special 
care will be taken for comprehensive GATT regulations and also 
to safeguard the economic and trade interests of the developing 
countries. Later, talking to PTV representative, the Mexican 
president said: 
  [Begin Salinas recording] It was a very positive meeting 
because we were able to discuss the bilateral relationship and 
also issues of interest for the prime minister, issues relating 
to Pakistan and also the perspective of our stronger trade 
relations; and I told her that NAFTA, the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, does not create a fortress-like trading area, 
but is open to the participation of other countries as trading 
partners or even as members. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said 
political stability and liberal economic policies offer vast 
opportunities for foreign investment in Pakistan. Speaking at a 
dinner hosted by the World Economic Forum in Davos last night, 
she highlighted the scope of foreign investment and the program 
of privatization by her government. 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] Pakistan is a confident nation. We 
have no inhibition to restrict the scope of economic relations 
with foreigners on mutually advantageous basis. Today we are an 
interdependent world, we are not an isolated world, and the 
confidence of international financial institutions demonstrates 
that Pakistan today is well on the road of political stability 
and economic stability, and therefore a good place for foreign 
investors to look to. The investors' confidence in Pakistan can 
be seen from the fact that (?well) in New York a Pakistan fund 
was open. It is oversubscribed three times, by three times. 
So, now we are thinking of opening another fund or issuing 
government securities. Not only was the Pakistan fund 
oversubscribed, but the stock market has been rising and rising. 
Pakistan today offers the most lucrative investment 
opportunities in major infrastructure projects. We have charted 
out a highly ambitious energy sector development plan, in which 
some $10 billion are likely to be invested over the next five 
years. We have made this an almost exclusive domain of the 
private sector, particularly foreign investors. Needless to say 
our optimism is based on the successful initiation of 
implementation work on the Hab power project which is a foreign 
private initiative costing $2 billion. In fact, this is the 
largest World Bank-funded private power project anywhere in the 
world today. [applause] [end recording] 
  The prime minister also highlighted Pakistan's geographical 
location which can open new vistas toward greater and better 
relations with the Central Asian countries. 
  In Davos today, the Turkish president, Suleyman Demirel, 
hosted a working breakfast which was also attended by Prime 
Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto and President Nazarbayev of 
Turkmenistan and President Karimov of Uzbekistan. The leaders 
of the ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] countries 
exchanged views for better cooperation among the 
member-countries. The leaders reviewed the existing links 
between the member-countries and identified areas where possible 
ties of further cooperation can be explored. 
  The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, also held a meeting 
with the senior minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, in 
Davos today. During the meeting, the prime minister and the 
Singapore minister discussed various issues in the fields of 
economics, commerce, and trade, and possibilities for raising a 
sound infrastructure in Pakistan, which can attract foreign 
investments. The prime minister briefed Mr. Lee about the 
economic policies of her government. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Davos, the prime minister has discussed 
multi-billion dollar investment projects in Pakistan with some 
industrial and investment teams from around the world. The 
prime minister's discussions centered around the construction of 
the (Lawari Tob) tunnel, to link Pakistan with Central Asia 
through Tajikistan; the establishment of rail and road links 
between Pakistan and Central Asia, to enhance global trade; 
setting up an industrial estate in Pakistan; and financing 
private thermal power units in Pakistan. 
  The Swedish prime minister, who met with Ms. Benazir Bhutto 
in Davos yesterday, discussed the expansion of bilateral 
cooperation. He expressed interest in possible investment in the 
(Lawari Tob) tunnel project, because this could greatly expand 
global trade with the regions of the former Soviet Union. Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto invited Swedish investors to invest in power 
plants in Pakistan. 
  Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, during his meeting 
with the prime minister, emphasized his country's strong 
interest in investing in rail and road projects between Pakistan 
with Central Asia. Ms. Benazir Bhutto offered to let Singapore 
establish an industrial estate in Pakistan to help its 
industrial growth. Both leaders agreed to identify an effective 
means for transferring technology from Singapore to Pakistan.

  [Text] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus held talks with 
Danish and Finnish prime ministers at the World Economic Forum 
in Davos yesterday. During the talks, Prime Minister Klaus 
distanced himself from the opinion voiced by Finnish Prime 
Minister Esko Aho, according to whom the emergence of large 
European companies might help in coping with American and Asian 
economic competition. Prime Minister Klaus rejected this idea 
pertaining, according to him, to the fifties and sixties, saying 
that small companies are more competitive than clumsy and 
bureaucratic colossi. 
  Later on during the talks, Klaus said that talks between 
current and future members of the European Union had revealed 
unanimity in many areas, as well as some fine differences of 
opinion in some others. According to him, the Czech Republic 
can enrich European integration thanks to its experience from 
the former regime. West Europe does not share this past, and 
therefore it does not perceive some of the matters so sharply.

  [Text] Swiss foreign minister Flavio Cotti says talks with 
the leaders of Germany, Belgium, Finland, and Denmark have 
created a better climate for bilateral relations with the 
European Union [EU]. Mr. Cotti was speaking after discussions 
on the third day of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort 
of Davos. 
  Switzerland has been negotiating for closer relations with 
the EU following its rejection of membership of the European 
Economic Area in 1992. 
  Meanwhile, the Mexican president, Carlos Salinas De Gortari, 
has appealed to the forum for investment in his country. He 
described the uprising of indigenous rebels in the southern 
state of Chiapas as a local problem in a region of deep poverty, 
and said the government was determined to reach a political 
solution. 
  The highlight of the forum is shortly due to take place, 
when 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres meets Palestine Liberation 
Organization leader Yasir 'Arafat. The two men will discuss how 
to resolve differences over the Palestinian autonomy accord.

  [Text] Prime Minister Esko Aho and German Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl agree that Finland's European Union [EU] 
membership negotiations should be concluded within the agreed 
timeframe, that is before 1 March. Aho met Kohl in the ski 
resort of Davos in Switzerland, where they are taking part in 
the World Economic Forum, an informal meeting of world leaders. 
Aho explained the negotiating situation from Finland's point of 
view and emphasized the two central demands: Getting a permanent 
subsidy for northern agriculture and financing this subsidy from 
EU funds, not from Finland's state funds. 
  Kohl did not comment in detail on Finland's goals but gave 
the assurance that Germany is very much aware of them. Earlier 
today Kohl said that it is important that Finland, Norway, 
Sweden and Austria join the EU from the beginning of next year. 
  Aho will remain in Davos until Sunday [30 January] and will 
meet several European leaders, among others Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

  [Text] Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel has accused the 
Swiss authorities of being responsible for the June attack by 
Kurdish extremists on the Turkish Embassy in Bern. Mr. Demirel 
said police had failed to provide sufficient security and were 
to blame for the incident in which one demonstrator was killed 
by shots fired from inside the embassy. He was speaking in 
Davos where he is attending the World Economic Forum. Swiss 
Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti denied there had been any security 
lapse. The shooting and Turkey's refusal to lift the diplomatic 
immunity of its embassy staff led to a diplomatic row between 
the two countries.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan 28 (AFP) - Alain Lamassoure, France's 
junior minister of European affairs, implicitly criticized the 
U.S. rejection of a French peace initiative on Bosnia in a 
speech here before the CSCE, his office said Friday [28 January]. 
  "We sometimes have the feeling," Lamassoure told the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) 
Thursday, "that other senior member states of the CSCE are not 
doing everything they could to encourage all parties involved to 
choose peace. 
  "Considering the point where we're at in the Yugoslav 
crisis, 
it is time for each of us to clearly take on some responsibility 
and choose, not only in words, but in action, the logic of 
peace." 
  Earlier this week, the U.S. rejected a French initiative for 
stiffer diplomatic and military action in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Burkhard Bischof report: "NATO Hopes for Austrian </F>
Concessions"] 
  [Text] Geilenkirchen -- "Yes, the Austrian demand that 
every single overflight of one of our planes must be approved by 
Vienna makes our work more complicated." This is the reaction 
by a high-ranking officer at the NATO air force base in 
Geilenkirchen at the German-Dutch border to the question about 
experiences regarding flights by the NATO reconnaissance planes 
over Austria. However, he also stresses that cooperation with 
the Austrian authorities basically works well on this matter. 
  NATO's request to Austria for simpler permits has, however, 
practically no chance of being approved until the elections, in 
the view of Vienna government circles, because giving up the 
duty to request permits for every single overflight would 
presuppose an amendment to the law. The respective regulations 
are contained in the Aviation Law and the Decree on Flights 
Across the Borders. An amendment to the law, however, would 
give rise to a discussion about neutrality, which is not desired 
by the Austrian Government. 
  Since 12 April 1993 NATO has been monitoring the no-fly zone 
over Bosnia-Herzegovina on the order of the United Nations and, 
for this purpose, it had flown more than 10,600 missions by 24 
January. One main element of this airspace monitoring is NATO's 
early warning fleet, which consists of 18 planes of the E-3A 
type. The main base of the AWACS planes (AWACS stands for 
Airborne Warning and Control System) for the Bosnian missions is 
the NATO base in Geilenkirchen as well as the external landing 
sites of Preveza in Greece and Trapani in Italy. 
  If the AWACS planes take off from Geilenkirchen for one of 
their Bosnian monitoring missions, which take place at great 
height over the Adriatic and Hungary, the flight across Austria 
is the shortest route. Even though Vienna has given permission 
for the NATO overflights, which take place at the order of the 
United Nations, every single flight must be approved by the 
Austrian authorities. According to NATO officers in 
Geilenkirchen, this applies to two routine flights per day plus 
special daily flights. 
  The individual permit for each of these overflights to be 
given by Vienna is applied for by Luxembourg, where the AWACS 
planes are registered. This becomes particularly complicated in 
the case of special flights for emergencies. In order to 
circumvent this bureaucratic procedure, NATO therefore wants a 
general overflight permit from Austria. In contrast to Vienna, 
the Swiss Government (Federal Council) has given such a general 
permit for half a year for the time being. Bern justifies this 
with the principle of solidarity with the peace-loving 
international community, which does not contradict neutrality. 
The UN mission in the former Yugoslavia is not a martial act 
but a police action by the international community, Bern argues. 
  The NATO air force offices in Geilenkirchen hope that 
Austria, too, will adopt this view and make their missions for 
monitoring the Bosnian airspace easier by means of a "global 
permit." Concerning the second Austrian demand, that the AWACS 
planes must switch off their military radar equipment during the 
overflight, they say succinctly: "This is no problem for us."

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 30 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation (NATO) is sending two missions to East Europe this 
week to promote a U.S.-inspired Partnership for Peace initiative 
for enhanced East-West military cooperation. 
  One mission will be going to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, 
Estonia and Slovakia, and the other to Albania, Romania, 
Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, a North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation (NATO) source said here at the weekend. 
  The job of the missions will be to explain details of the 
Partnership which was announced at a NATO summit here on January 
10, and find out exactly how the East European countries intend 
to exploit it. 
  The first mission will be led by the German and Danish 
ambassadors to NATO, Herrmann von Richthofen and Ole Bierring. 
Heading the second is NATO's assistant secretary general, 
Gebhardt von Moltke. 
  So far, 15 countries mainly of the former Soviet bloc have 
said they plan to link up with NATO. But the NATO source said 
Russia and Ukraine had not yet given a firm response. 
  Romania and Lithuania signed a framework agreement here last 
week. Poland and Estonia are scheduled to do so this week. 
  Partnership for Peace was devised by the United States to 
promote military cooperation with the countries of the former 
Soviet bloc and prepare some of them for membership of NATO at 
some unspecified future date. 
  But NATO has refused to give firm membership commitments to 
Moscow's former Warsaw Pact allies for fear of angering Russia. 
  The Partnership involves a menu of participation levels from 
which each candidate can choose. 
  The options range from joint military manoeuvres, 
peace-keeping, search-and-rescue, disaster relief, military 
communications, defence planning, training and the clean-up of 
old Soviet military bases. 
  The choice depends partly on what each country can afford. 
Each will be expected to pay the bulk of the costs involved, 
particularly in modernising their military machines to mesh into 
NATO activities. 
  Poland has already estimated that its participation will 
cost 
22 million dollars a year. 
  The countries most interested in a deep involvement in the

full membership of the trans-Atlantic alliance -- Poland, 
Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 26 (AFP) -- The European Community is 
to spend ECU2 million (2.2 million dollars) helping the 
countries of the former Soviet Union set up an efficient 
clearing system for banks, an EC official said here Wednesday 
[26 January]. 
  The main beneficiaries will be the Russian Central Bank and 
the new Interstate Bank, which is charged with establishing 
clearing houses for bank transactions throughout the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
  The EC official said interbank transfers and payments were 
painfully slow in CIS countries, hindering trade. Citing one 
example, he said that a bank transfer from Vladivostok to Saint 
Petersburg could take weeks. 
  The EC's executive European Commission plans to send a team 
of high-level finance and banking specialists to Russia, 
Ukraine, and Belarus to counsel banks there.

  [Excerpt] The Hague, Jan 28 (AFP) -- The United Nations is 
to build a jail here for suspected war criminals from the former 
Yugoslavia, a senior Italian judge told AFP. 
  The slammer is being built inside a prison here and will 
consist of 12 cells, each with a minimal floor space of seven 
square metres (74 square feet). 
  Suspects will appear before the International Court on 
Crimes 
in the Former Yugoslavia, the court's president Antonio Cassese 
said. 
  "The new cells should be handed over to us at the end of 
June," Cassese said, adding that a new international penal code 
would have to be drawn up to regulate the prison. 
  Dutch police will be responsible for transferring the 
prisoners to and from the jail but, once inside, their security 
and that of the court's judges will fall to armed UN guards. 
  Sentences handed down by the court will be served in the 
prisons of UN member states. France and Italy have already 
offered to take in some of those convicted. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Strasbourg, France, Jan 28 (AFP) -- The Council of 
Europe decided Friday [28 January] to give Bosnia-Herzegovina 
special guest status at its parliamentary assembly, the 
assembly's chairman Miguel Angel Martinez said here. 
  Exact details of Bosnia's participation and the number of 
its 
delegates to the next assembly session of the pan-European body 
next April have not been worked out. 
  Martinez said the assembly wanted to be able to talk to all 
sides in the Bosnian conflict to assist the Council of Europe in 
its efforts to bring peace to the region. 
  "It also shows our solidarity towards the principal victims 
of the Bosnian drama, and above all to those who hold most to a 
multi-ethnic, democratic and free Bosnia, that is to say a 
European Bosnia-Herzegovina," Martinez added. 
  On Monday Martinez expressed regret at the total break in 
relations between the Council of Europe and the rump Yugoslavia, 
which he said had deprived the Council of means of bringing 
pressure to bear on Belgrade. 
  But there was no question of going back on the Council of 
Europe's earlier decision to suspend the membership of Serbia 
and Montenegro, he added. 
  He said the Council had rejected demands to suspend or even 
withdraw completely Croatia's status as special guest because of 
its role in Bosnia, where the mainly-Moslem government is 
fighting Croat and Serb irregular forces. 
  The parliamentary assembly did not wish to burn its bridges 
with Croatia, cutting off the possibility of contact, 
information and pressure, Martinez said.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 28 (AFP) -- The European Community is 
about to embark on a fundamental rethink of its relations with 
East and Central Europe, European Commission President Jacques 
Delors said here Friday [28 January]. 
  In an address to journalists, he acknowledged that the 
European Community lacked vision in dealing with the region and 
that its executive intended to embark on a process of 
"self-criticism" to map out a new policy. 
  "The Community must delve into the roots of its history," he 
said, adding that "Vienna, Budapest, Warsaw and other cities are 
as much poles of our cultural identity as Berlin, Paris, 
Brussels, Amsterdam or London." 
  The European Community has negotiated association agreements 
with Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania 
and Bulgaria which are supposed to prepare the way for these 
countries to enter the European Community. 
  But the applicants have been given no timetable for entry, 
or 
any assurance that they can expect to enter the Community before 
the turn of the century. 
  The European Community has also been blamed for holding up 
the economic development of these countries by maintaining 
barriers to some of their most vigorous exports such as steel 
and agricultural products. 
  The European Community's chief executive said the Commission 
intended to launch an analysis of all existing EC aid, 
particularly economic and technological, to East Europe. 
  Delors is to give up his post as European Commission 
president at the end of this year. He has occupied the post 
since 1985.

<F P=106> [Report signed "eli": "Ruehe: Envisaging German Missions </F>
Abroad"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- On Wednesday [26 January], the defense 
ministers of Britain, France, and Germany met in London for 
confidential talks on the NATO reform and a strengthening of the 
Western European Union (WEU). Defense circles emphasize that 
this was the first trilateral meeting of its kind. They say 
this meeting has shown that France wishes to move closer to 
military integration with NATO. Britain, on the other hand, 
seems to have changed its course in the Partnership for Peace 
policy. Of all the NATO members, London to date had voiced the 
strongest reservations against NATO's opening toward East Europe. 
  During the "informal meeting," Britain's Defense Minister 
Malcolm Rifkind and his French and German counterparts, Francois 
Leotard and Volker Ruehe, discussed ways of strengthening 
European defense through the WEU, the defense arm of the 
European Union. In this connection, the defense ministers 
mainly discussed the Combined Joint Task Force. A resolution 
adopted at the latest NATO summit provides for this force to be 
positioned in Europe and its commando units to be such that they 
can be taken out of NATO structures. Ruehe pointed out that no 
structures running parallel to NATO must develop in this 
connection. 
  British reports say that Germany was also asked about its 
undecided approach to missions abroad. A decision on Bonn's 
future role in this is particularly important because it is 
linked with the part Germany plays in the task force, its 
stationing, and the distribution of posts. Ruehe stressed that 
German participation has to be envisaged. He said it is 
impossible not to include Germany in the task forces. 
  Observers think that the reason Britain is stepping up 
involvement in the WEU has something to do with its fear of a 
German-French axis in Europe. France's Leotard, on the other 
hand, sees the linking of WEU and NATO structures as an 
opportunity to move his country closer to military integration 
with the alliance. France seems to have come to the conclusion 
that WEU structures can only be strengthened in cooperation with 
NATO. 
  The ministers also discussed the Partnership for Peace 
program, which provides for NATO's cautious opening toward the 
East European states. Britain, the fiercest opponent of the 
program prior to the NATO summit, seems to be embarking on a 
different course now, not least because the United States has 
clearly expressed its determination to include East Europe. 
Ruehe will discuss this issue with his Polish counterpart Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk today.

<F P=106> [Article by Joseph Leddet: "Export ECU to East"] </F>
  [Text] The monthly magazine of the French Foreign Trade 
Bank, MULTIDEVISES, reported in December on the most recent, 
hallucinatory monetary measures adopted in the East: 
introduction of the dram in Armenia on 22 November, the tenge in 
Kazakhstan on 15 November, the leu in Moldova on 29 November, 
and the coupons in Uzbekistan on 15 November; devaluation of the 
dinar by nearly 100 percent in the former Yugoslavia on 9 
November.... 
  It is impossible not to be dismayed by such a concentration 
of decisions, both aberrant on the intellectual and financial 
levels and dramatic on the human level. 
  The creation of a new currency in an upside down economy is 
certainly aberrant. A national symbol, the currency is the 
incarnation of a country's financial image. When the country is 
starting out from zero and the currency is created from thin 
air, its fate is settled in advance: it only means a fall. What 
is most serious seems to be the role (or rather, the lack of it) 
played by Western economic advisers with the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], with the European Union 
in the lead, which allow--even approve of and finance--such 
absurdities. 
  These measures are also dramatic on a human level because 
they condemn all the populations concerned to galloping 
inflation and a vertiginous drop in their standard of living. 
Only the happy possessors of strong currencies (the dollar and 
West European currencies) are the winners, building fortunes 
from an elementary, if not savage, business. 
  Thus, with the emergence of liberalism, most East European 
people are living much worse than before, particularly wage 
earners, professionals, and, still more, retirees. Hence the 
understandable attraction exerted by extreme rightist and 
neocommunist parties advocating a return to an acceptable and 
desirable order, as recently manifested by Russian voters. 
  While there is no miracle solution for such a problem, 
certain measures ought to be taken. In economic issues, the 
first priority for any country is the currency. The currency of 
a country such as Russia, Poland, or Romania is worth 
nothing--on an international level, of course--if it is not a 
convertible currency. A Western company planning to do business 
in Russia would then attempt by all available means to obtain 
contracts in dollars or marks; alternately, it would accept a 
compensation/barter system with all the risks this entails. This 
situation considerably restricts foreign investment in East 
Europe. 
  True, the solution is radical: East European currencies 
ought 
to be abolished and replaced by a real currency. For various 
reasons, we believe it would be opportune to retain the ECU as a 
common currency for East Europe, notably from a geopolitical 
perspective. 
  This solution is radical because it means carrying out a 
veritable financial transfusion by replacing at a given time the 
country's monetary mass with its equivalent in ECU's at a rate 
set in an authoritarian way, exactly as West Germany did for the 
former East Germany. 
  This transfusion would have the dual advantage of limiting 
the growth of the money supply (which would no longer be the 
result of the printing presses), hence to stabilize prices and 
create an attractive new market for Western investors as long as 
local consumers pay in hard currency. A really productive 
economy would thus have a chance to develop among our Eastern 
neighbors and local people would benefit from a real purchasing 
power. 
  Obviously, the loss of monetary sovereignty in the countries 
concerned would be a disadvantage. But this is what awaits all 
of us, the signatories of the Maastricht Treaty, in a few years. 
  On the contrary, this might be an excellent occasion to 
promote the ECU by exporting it to the East in a progressive 
manner (for instance, through a test in a country like Bulgaria, 
or Hungary, or Uzbekistan). The 1 January 1994 installation of 
the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt comes at the right 
time to promote such an experiment....

the Western-dominated Group of Seven industrialized nations. 
Peter Sutherland said the new body should be drawn from 
developing and former communist states as well as the 24 
developed nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development. He was speaking to leading economists from 
Europe and the United States who are attending the World 
Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. Mr Sutherland said 
it was not possible to continue with the majority of the world's 
people excluded from global economic management. Meanwhile

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 28 (AFP) -- Former Russian 
Finance Minister Boris Federov suggested here Friday [28 
January] that the only way to get Moscow's economic reforms back 
on track was to fire nearly all government staff. 
  Federov, who refused to take part in the new 
more-conservative Russian cabinet, said the result of the 
government's rightward shift could be several months of 
"disastrous" policies. 
  He told reporters at the World Economic Forum that the 
administration of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin lacked the 
political will and expertise to run the economy properly. 
  "If I were in government again, I would try to fire all 
government staff and would not allow more than five percent to 
return," Federov said. "You have to break the remnants of the 
old system which still exist." 
  Federov said that the government's move to backtrack on its 
free-market reforms could cost the country half a year of 
economic development at a time when it should be speeding up. 
  The 36-year-old Federov, a champion of reform, said the 
reversal was inevitable after the success by ultranationalists 
in last month's parliamentary elections. 
  But he still held out some hope for Russia's future. 
  "If I say we could have a disaster, it does not mean it will 
be a disaster," he said. "Russians like miracles...."

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 28 (AFP) -- The German 
Bundesbank is ready under certain conditions to lower its 
official interest rates and still has some margin to reduce 
long-term rates, a senior official said Friday [28 January]. 
  Gerd Haller, German secretary of state for finance, said at 
the World Economic Forum here that the Bundesbank's action 
depends on the evolution of Germany's monetary supply and wage 
negotiations. 
  "The Bundesbank is prepared to bring down short-term 
interest 
rates, but it depends on other factors," Haller said. 
  He said that although long-term rates are at an historic 
low, 
"there is still some room for long-term interest rates to go 
down." 
  Germany is under pressure from its European partners to 
lower 
its interest rates, seen as a source of currency instability in 
and a damper on efforts to stimulate economic growth on the 
continent. 
  British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, whose 
country jumped from the European Community currency grid in 
September of 1992, said the European Community needs monetary 
stability to make its single market work. 
  "What we need in the European Community is exchange-rate 
stability if we are to get the best out of the single market," 
he said. 
  Clarke said the best means of assuring this is making 
efforts 
to bring the various economies closer, adding, "We need to make 
sure we coordinate what we are doing." 
  "The challenge will be to keep, as we come out of the 
recession, the stability of exchange rates that we have at the 
moment," he said.

  [Excerpts] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus delivered one 
of the main addresses at today's World Economic Forum session in 
Davos. Our correspondent Jiri Halousek reports: 
  [Halousek] [Passage omitted] Addressing the working group on 
the issues concerning the admission of new members to European 
institutions, the Czech prime minister stressed that the future 
status of Europe in the world does not depend so much on the 
existence and activities of multilateral European institutions 
as on the quality and structure of the political, social, and 
economic systems in individual countries. In this context 
Vaclav Klaus spoke in favor of abandoning bureaucratic measures 
and unnecessary state interventions. He said that it is 
necessary to build a Europe of citizens and not a Europe of 
politicians. The Czech Republic, as well as all other Central 
European countries, has always considered itself to be a part of 
Europe and, thus, would not like to be deprived of advantages 
ensuing from membership in European institutions. I firmly 
believe, continued Vaclav Klaus, that my country has crossed 
already the Rubicon between the two totally different political, 
social, and economic systems, and that it is ready to take 
further steps toward a reasonable European integration. 
However, by this term I do not mean a total integration. 
  The Czech Republic does not want to be always the recipient 
and it is prepared to offer something. According to Vaclav 
Klaus, we are aware of the fact that we have to solve our 
problems ourselves and we do not expect Europe to solve them for 
us. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has called 
upon world public opinion to help solve the Bosnian and Kashmir 
problems in the interest of regional peace and harmony. She was 
addressing a seminar on clash of civilizations at the World 
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, today. She said the task 
of the world leaders is not to make tragedies like Bosnia and 
Kashmir appear inevitable, normal, and least of all acceptable. 
She stressed the need to reverse this trend. Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto said joined by her Turkish counterpart, Dr. Tansu Ciller, 
she will visit Bosnia tomorrow. They will express solidarity 
with the mothers and children of Bosnia who have suffered ethnic 
cleansing, torture, aggression, and molestation at the hands of 
blatant aggression. She said that during the continued human 
rights violations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Western countries 
have stood with arms folded, although they were in a position to 
stop the holocaust in their European Continent. The prime 
minister said this attitude is a blot on the conscience of the 
mankind as a whole and not a cause for Islam alone. 
  She said Pakistan and India have been in a state of 
confrontation for nearly five decades. Settlement of the core 
issue of Kashmir can help improve regional stability in South 
Asia. She said this is a goal to which leaders of the region 
are supposed to work. Solution to the Kashmir problem is the key 
to regional peace, which must be pursued with utmost 
determination. The prime minister said that the realization of 
justice and equity within and among nations constitutes the most 
viable organizing principle for a new order in the emerging era. 
Human rights, democratic rights, and the quality of life for 
mankind must become vital factors in global policies. The prime 
minister went on to say that these values must cut across 
cultural and economic blocs. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the rights 
of women and children, minorities, basic freedom, and 
humanitarian concerns must become the concern of a global 
village which becomes smaller and more intimate everyday with 
the advance of modern technology.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 31 (AFP) -- Association agreements 
linking Poland and Hungary more closely with the European 
Community and ultimately preparing them for full membership of 
the EC come into effect on Tuesday [1 February]. 
  The so-called European Agreements give the two East European 
countries greater access to the EC for their products, and 
provide for an enhanced political dialogue. 
  The EC commissioners for foreign relations and foreign 
trade, 
Hans van den Broek and Leon Brittan, said the accords, signed in 
December 1991 but not fully ratified until last December, 
constituted "a landmark." 
  They said in a statement: "It enables the parties to fully 
develop their political and economic cooperation in the context 
of their future membership of the European Union (also known as 
the EC)." 
  The agreements give no firm date for membership of the EC, 
although they state this as an ultimate objective. 
  The trade terms of the accords have been in effect since 
March 1, 1992. They commit the EC to a gradual lifting of 
tariff barriers against industrial products to create a free 
trade zone. 
  But some barriers against some products considered sensitive 
in the EC will remain for several years to protect European 
industries. 
  Thus tariffs on steel and coal will remain intact until 
January 1996, and various textile tariffs for another one or two 
years. Tariffs and quotas on agricultural goods will be 
gradually lowered until July 1995. 
  Poland and Hungary will be given a little longer, until 
end-1998 and end-2001 respectively, to open their markets to 
products from the EC, and adopt the Community's competition laws. 
  The EC has also negotiated European agreements with the 
Czech 
and Slovak republics, Romania and Bulgaria. But these have not 
yet been finalised. 
  In 1992 the EC chalked up a combined trade surplus of ECU2.5 
billion ($2.8 billion) with the six countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jaques Delors, president of the Commission </F>
of the European Union, by Jacek Safuta in Brussels; date not 
given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Safuta] The treaties on the association of Poland 
and Hungary with the European Community come into force on 1 
February. Some people say this is too little, too late. 
Shouldn't one take another step now both in the economic and in 
the political area? 
  [Delors -- in French with superimposed Polish translation] 
Most certainly yes in the political area. You are worried, and 
so am I, about stability in Europe, not only in your countries 
but in the whole of Europe. That is why, since the fall of the 
Berlin Wall, I have always been a supporter of closer political 
links, which would enable us to exchange opinions and which 
would make proper work possible in order to eliminate everything 
which threatens peace, freedom, and mutual understanding between 
nations. 
  However, when it comes to the economic area, I often think 
about this, and I do not regret the path we have chosen, that is 
the path of gradual rapprochement, so that your economies can 
adapt to modern economic management at the lowest possible cost. 
  [Safuta] Prime Minister Pawlak is coming to Brussels [2-3 
February]. What topics would you like to discuss with him? 
What questions would you like to ask him? 
  [Delors] He will be my guest. I shall fit in with the agenda 
he chooses, naturally. Apart from that, I am eager to find out 
how he assesses the process of modernization of Polish economy, 
how he assesses the internal situation in your country and how 
he sees the future of Europe. Well, the list of topics will be 
very long and the meeting will certainly be very interesting, at 
least for me.

<F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and a </F>
report on an interview with German Deputy Foreign Minister 
Helmut Schaefer by correspondent Marianna Polikhroniadhou; place 
and date not given--ellipses as published] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Polikhroniadhou] Following 
your talks with the Greek side, would you say there has been 
progress on the timeframe for concluding negotiations on 
Austria's accession to the European Union [EU]? 
  [Vranitzky] We believe the date will still be early March. 
Although this goal is considered to be optimistic, we believe it 
can be achieved. After the talks in Athens in particular, we 
have set out the prospects for concluding the accession 
negotiations within the timeframe scheduled originally. 
  [Polikhroniadhou] Are you optimistic about the outcome of 
the 
referendum on accession that will be held in your country? 
  [Vranitzky] Yes, I believe the outcome will be positive. But 
we must conclude the negotiations first. The next step is the 
referendum. Of course, some people in Austria say that perhaps 
the referendum should have been held first. But when someone 
wants to conquer a 2,000-meter mountain, he is first interested 
in conquering the first 400 meters and then the rest. 
  [Polikhroniadhou] Do you believe that during the Greek 
presidency, our country can play a more substantive role for 
stability in the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Vranitzky] I hope so, because Greece is the EU country with 
the best knowledge and experience of the Balkans, and if war 
spreads, it will be the one at the greatest risk of getting 
immediately involved. This is why we must seriously consider 
the Greek presidency's positions on resolving the crisis in the 
region. But no one can be so optimistic that they believe the 
problem could be solved during the short Greek presidency. What 
frequently happens when we discuss a Bosnian solution is that 
many sides suggest various solutions that cancel each other out. 
<H5>  Relations </H5>
  [Polikhroniadhou] After meeting Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou and based on your statement afterward, you have 
created the impression that you share the Greek concerns about 
the former Republic of Macedonia.... 
  [Vranitzky] Papandreou presented the issue of the former 
Republic of Macedonia calmly and explained well enough the Greek 
position about the state being recognized under the current 
conditions. On this issue, the possible dangers may be weighed 
up. One reason for these dangers could be that the country's 
population consists of a variety of people (Serbs, Albanians, 
etc.), which means it would be easy to receive outside 
influence. We understand the Greek positions, which stem from 
your country's history and your geographical position. 
  Austria decided to recognize this state within the UN 
framework but did not decide to establish bilateral diplomatic 
relations with it. But I am optimistic that with the expanding 
European Union and the finding of a mutually acceptable solution 
on accession within the European framework, this issue will be 
resolved soon. 
  [Polikhroniadhou] Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras 
asked the government not to rule out the possibility of our 
country exercising its veto right on the expansion of the 
European Community if the Community appears to be indifferent to 
the Greek positions on Skopje. Did your Greek interlocutors 
mention this during your official meetings? 
  [Vranitzky] This is the first time I have heard this view. 
Allow me not to comment, because neither the president nor the 
government has raised such an issue. They haven't even made the 
slightest comment during our talks. We are interested in what 
the official side says, and we are not concerned with views like 
those of Samaras.... 
<H5>  Past Problem </H5>
  Discussing Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos' 
remarks and the atmosphere of Greek-German relations, German 
Deputy Foreign Minister Helmut Schaefer said: "Pangalos' 
remarks are history and couldn't affect Greek-German relations. 
I do not believe it is useful to reiterate rumors of problems 
because we are confirming them in some way. Following my visit 
and talks with my Greek counterpart Yeoryios Papandreou, I would 
describe the atmosphere as positive and the similarity of views 
on many issues as significant." 
  Referring to Germany's Balkan policy, he said: "There is no 
German Balkan policy. The German side's interest is purely 
humanitarian. We want things to be stable and we need everyone 
to contribute to that. The wrong impression was once created -- 
and we believed it too -- that the Serbs were responsible for 
continuing the clashes and that if Serbia stopped fighting, the 
problem would be solved. 
  "The problem is more complex. We must persuade all former 
Yugoslav parties involved that every side must take steps to 
resolve the crisis, because Europe will run out of patience at 
some point. A new initiative must be undertaken to end the 
prevailing situation. We are waiting for the U.S. secretary of 
state to move." 
  Germany seems to be running out of patience on Skopje as 
well. This can be seen in a response to a question on the hasty 
opening of a German diplomatic delegation in Skopje. "No one 
can claim that we hurried to recognize the former Republic of 
Macedonia. We waited two years before establishing diplomatic 
relations. During these two years, the country became a UN 
member and was thus recognized by international law. 
  "The Greek side must get rid of its sentimentality on this 
issue. It would be much worse for the Greek side if there was 
instability in the region. Papandreou agreed with that. So, 
Athens and Skopje must continue their dialogue and Germany is 
ready to help resume the talks." 
  Referring to the Cyprus issue, Schaefer said: During their 
visit to Turkey, the German and British Foreign Ministers Claus 
Kinkel and Douglas Hurd discussed the Cyprus issue. We said 
both sides involved must show greater flexibility. 
  Asked how he describes a common European policy for 
resolving 
the Bosnian crisis, the minister said: "In one sentence, it's 
common European desperation...."

<F P=106> [Article signed JB: "Sweden Controlling Crisis of its </F>
Welfare State, Belgium Still at Odds With It"] 
  [Excerpts] Davos -- It was a dubious honor yesterday. The 
prime ministers of Sweden and Belgium were sitting on the 
platform with a select group of businessmen as their audience; 
the theme was the future of the welfare state. [passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister Dehaene, who claimed he was speaking from a 
Belgian and European point of view, emphasized that the share of 
social security in national income, has reached "the highest 
possible level." In his opinion, we must define the social 
adjustments we deem necessary, within a European context. The 
biggest challenge will be to preserve social security and to 
prevent a dual society from being formed, in which part of the 
population would become marginal. 
  He believes that the problems on the labor market must be 
dealt with on three levels: A liberalization of the excessively 
stringent rules, which keep employers from hiring people, a 
substitution of unemployment pay by an active policy of training 
and by an obligation to accept jobs, and a reduction of wage 
costs, especially those of unskilled workers, by trying to find 
alternative financing for social security. 
  Dehaene also believes that the labor unions and employers' 
organizations are still too much a reflection of the situation 
in the period of industrialization. This pursuit of uniform 
regulations for everyone, which was inherited from the past, 
thwarts the necessary flexibility.

  [Text] The governments of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia 
consider it necessary to begin consultations with the Baltic Sea 
countries and international financial institutions on the 
possibility of drafting a joint power engineering project, the 
aim of which would be the linking of Norwegian gas deposits with 
consumers in Poland, Germany, and the Baltic states via Finland 
and Denmark. This was stated at a meeting of the prime 
ministers of the three Baltic states in Davos. 
  The project proposed by the Baltic states is intended to 
reduce the dependence of these countries on gas supplies from 
Russia. During the trilateral meeting, issues of cooperation in 
international organizations, as well issues of Baltic economic 
cooperation, were discussed.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Gallard: "A Khaki Airbus"] </F>
  [Text] The beasts of burden of French aviation are worn 
out. The humble stars of current events, the 82 Transall and 
Hercules C130 aircraft of the military transport fleet see 
service in all armed interventions and all humanitarian 
operations. These aircraft, 30 or more years old, will have to 
be replaced just after the year 2000. This retirement date is 
scheduled even sooner in Great Britain and is similarly close in 
Germany (coproducer of the Transall), Spain, and Italy. Their 
replacement by a European "future large aircraft" (FLA) has 
become a burning, even explosive issue, since eight chiefs of 
staff for the Army and Air Force met in Paris on 20 December at 
a meeting chaired by French General Lanata. 
  This meeting uncovered three weighty issues: The creation of 
a military subsidiary of Airbus Industrie; the possible 
invention of a new mode of financing in response to the American 
GATT challenge; and the development of a new type of engine by 
SNECMA [French national aircraft engine manufacturer] in 
association with European partners. The role of party-pooper 
was played by the American company Lockheed with its offer of a 
share in the production of the updated Hercules C130-J. The 
Americans have courted British manufacturers with subcontracting 
offers worth more than 10 billion French francs [Fr]. 
  All this crazed commotion has one aim: to reduce the 
estimated cost of the FLA by one-third from its initial Fr35 
billion for 200 aircraft. Public paymasters gagged when this 
price was announced, and began to eye offers from America 
(Lockheed) and the Ukraine (Antonov) that were proposing new 
versions of old models. French military officials, however, 
considered any deal with the Ukraine to be too risky. As for 
the Hercules C130-J, they found its cargo bay too narrow. "We 
need an aircraft with a fuselage diameter of 4 meters -- like 
the large Airbuses and the FLA project -- so that we can carry 
large helicopters or antiaircraft missile batteries without the 
need to ask the Americans if they would be kind enough to lend 
us planes bigger than the Hercules," General Lanata insisted. 
It appears that he convinced his colleagues that it would be 
better to cut down the FLA estimate rather than make do with the 
diameter of the American aircraft. 
  The first novelty was that, instead of the usual step of 
creating a new, tailor-made industrial consortium, the partners 
want to adopt the mold and procedures of Airbus Industrie. The 
idea is to create a military subsidiary where the four majority 
Airbus partners would be joined at least by the Italian company 
Alenia, if not by a Belgian, Portuguese, or Turkish 
manufacturer, since these are the other partners and future 
customers of the FLA project. The advantages of this are 
two-fold: Participants would profit from the efficiency of the 
methods used in civil aviation; and a gateway would be created 
for channeling public subsidies from the military to the 
civilian branch. Since the military is not subject to the 
requirements of GATT, this subsidiary could, without fear of 
reprisals, receive uncapped refundable loans if the 
participating are unable to fund the aircraft's development. 
After all, Boeing is currently hoping to receive an order for 
80 Boeing 747's for military transport, which at the present 
rate of production represents more than three years' work for 
the jumbo assembly line. 
  Second, the generals will content themselves with a simpler 
aircraft, with less ambitious equipment for the mass-produced 
aircraft, and quite different engines. The forces want both an 
airliner capable of flying long distances at high speeds, which 
had led to the decision of a four-engine model, and an assault 
plane capable of landing on an clay runway or a plowed field, 
which requires turboprop engines. This second solution is 10 
percent less expensive. Meeting this week in Rome, 
manufacturers from eight countries know that the choice of 
engine will be crucial. Opposition between Rolls Royce and 
SNECMA 10 years ago blew apart the European fighter plane 
project. Now it looks like a showdown between the young 
Anglo-German partnership of Rolls Royce and BMW and the new 
French-German pairing of SNECMA and MTU [Engines and Turbines 
United]. Both groups have at least a "core" that can be used as 
the basis for a high-speed turboprop engine capable of reaching 
speeds of 800 kph. Aircraft manufacturers and European chiefs 
of staff are keeping their fingers crossed that history does not 
repeat itself.

<F P=106> [Winfried Muenster commentary: "Europe's Bitter Bananas"] </F>
  [Text] The banana market regulation is the prime example 
of the fact that the European Union and its institutions in 
Brussels may harbor danger. France, Great Britain, and Spain 
have abused European law to give national branches, namely their 
banana importers, advantages at the cost of other member states. 
They fanned the Commission's instinctive inclination toward 
general regulations with the usual result, namely that markets 
are not so much regulated but destroyed, which means that the 
consumer pays higher prices or gets worse goods. There is 
virtually nothing about the banana market regulation that can be 
defended, and in Brussels they even use the principles of 
European integration to justify it. 
  "Whoever advocates Community preference for milk, beef, 
grain, and sugar," Bavarian Agriculture Minister Reinhold 
Bocklet says to the point, "cannot refuse it to the banana 
producers in the Community." Limiting imports and making them 
more expensive in order to protect domestic producers is one of 
the most important elements of European agricultural policy, and 
some European politicians would like to make many other economic 
branches in the single market happy with that too. No matter 
how absurd the banana market regulation may be, any agriculture 
minister will advocate it, because criticizing it means 
undermining the foundations of agricultural policy. 
  However, do these politicians not realize that they do not 
serve their cause well? Community preference is not an 
achievement of European unification, but an exceptional price 
that the consumer pays because he wants to have agriculture 
preserved as an integral part of his own society. If Bocklet 
believes that he has to burden the consumers with the care for 
banana producers in Martinique just so that they do not get the 
idea of saving in their payments for the farmers in their own 
country, he is provoking precisely what he is trying to avoid. 
  Is it so difficult to make it clear to the agricultural 
politicians that they can preserve what they have all the more 
certainly the earlier they draw a line? With the banana market 
regulation, however, they have far overdrawn the bow, in 
particular since it wastes hundreds of millions of the tax 
payers' money before it will help the banana producers overseas. 
It will remain the talk of the day and it will be used as a 
warning every time when the next step is supposed to be taken in 
European integration. The opponents of a united Europe could 
not have thought up anything better.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Italy Supports Austria at European </F>
Union"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Italian Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi has assured Austria of Italy's full support for Austria's 
speedy accession to the European Union [EU]. After a one and 
one-half hour talk with Chancellor Vranitzky, Ciampi said on 
Monday [31 January] that Italy has always supported Austria's EU 
membership. 
  Ciampi stressed Italy's interest in intensifying the 
struggle 
against international crime and came out in favor of ever closer 
cooperation with Austria in this area. He particularly stressed 
the problem of money laundering. 
  Vranitzky said that, before borders are abolished within the 
European Union, it must be ensured that the combating of 
international crime will continue. He added that the Austrian 
National Bank is already checking the influx of money from 
abroad and this has proved its worth so far. Vranitzky told the 
Austria Press Agency APA that more far-reaching steps, such as 
the abolition of the anonymity of savings accounts, are not 
under discussion. 
  After the talk with Ciampi, Vranitzky stated that membership 
negotiations with the European Union must be concluded 
completely by the end of February and individual items must not 
be removed and negotiated at a later date. At a press 
conference with Ciampi, he affirmed Austria's full commitment to 
the European Union's Maastricht Treaties. In the Italian 
delegation it was stressed that Ciampi had emphasized to 
Vranitzky that there will "not be any exceptions" for new EU 
members. A second Denmark is out of the question for Italy. 
  Ciampi and Vranitzky also discussed south Tirol's protests 
against the new Italian election law, which excludes the South 
Tirolean People's Party from the distribution of a quarter of 
the parliamentary seats because of a 4-percent clause. 
Vranitzky said that Ciampi proved to be "greatly flexibile" on 
this question, and he assumes that the problem will be solved 
after the forthcoming parliamentary elections. 
  The war in the former Yugoslavia also received broad space 
in 
the talks with Vranitzky. 
  After the meeting with Vranitzky, Ciampi was received by 
President Thomas Klestil and then went to Parliament, where he 
was welcomed by Nationalrat President Heinz Fischer. After a 
lunch with Vranitzky, Ciampi returned to Rome by plane in the 
afternoon.

<F P=106> [Report signed "SN-w.sch, neu": "Great Excitement Because </F>
of Continuation of Temelin Construction"] 
  [Text] Vienna/Linz -- Lower Austrian mayors are taking up 
arms because of Temelin. About 160 municipal politicians 
expressed their concern about the imminent continuation of the 
construction of the Czech nuclear power plant in letters to the 
U.S. Congress. At the same time, the mayors contacted U.S. 
Ambassador Swanee Hunt and asked for an appointment for talks. 
Hunt was invited to acquaint herself about the nuclear concerns 
of the population during a visit to regions close to the border. 
Henry Gonzales, chairman of the Banking Committee of the U.S. 
Congress, was asked to brief Congress on the massive objections. 
  Yesterday, Ernst Strasser, party secretary of the Lower 
Austrian Austrian People's Party called on all mayors, 
"independently of their political attitude," to oppose Temelin 
because no safety guarantees at all are given. Strasser said: 
"This is a concern of Lower Austria as a whole. In the event 
of a reactor accident in Temelin, the whole of eastern Austria 
will be affected." 
  On Monday [31 January], about 50 activists of the 
environmental group Greenpeace protested against the Czech 
nuclear power plant Temelin by "occupying the roof" of the 
Austrian branch of the U.S. concern Westinghouse in Pasching 
near Linz and with banners saying "Stop Temelin" and 
"Waste-inghouse." 
  Mothers with small children and demonstrators dressed as 
Death tried to hand over prior applications for damages 
amounting to 3 million schillings to Heinz Otto Fesselmann, 
managing director of Westinghouse in Linz. Heinz Hoegelsberger, 
manager of the antinuclear campaign of Greenpeace, stressed at 
the site of the events that the management does not want any 
contact with the activists. It denies responsibility, 
Hoegelsberger stressed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Search for Denouncers"] </F>
  [Text] The letters were posted in Wiener Neustadt -- which 
is where [imprisoned neo-Nazi leader] Kuessel's gang, the 
Volkstreue Ausserparlamentarische Opposition (VAPO) 
[Extraparliamentary Opposition Loyal to the People] continues to 
have a functioning "squad." The sender [of the letters]: a 
"Vienna initiative of students for democracy close to the 
people" with a false address. The envelopes were understamped, 
the addressees, student representatives in and around Vienna, 
had to pay a surcharge if they wanted to read the truly delicate 
contents. 
  Inside the letters were: the first issue of a new neo-Nazi 
gazette with the title ALBUS 9/11: NEWS FROM THE WHITE 
RESISTANCE. The neo-Nazi newsletter (masthead: NSDAP/AO, 
Lincoln, Nebraska) is far worse than similar products on the 
scene. Nazi humor of the kind "you are unemployed -- join those 
who survive the holocaust!"; expert instructions for the mixing 
of Molotov cocktails (do-it-yourself "Molie"); all kinds of 
racial theory; and one page of legal advice (ideological terror: 
"Arrested -- What Now?" are the headlines of the luxuriously 
laid out smearsheet). 
  According to the paper, the author of the legal advice page, 
highly topical after the recent series of letter-bomb attacks, 
is a "Graz policeman." Mere provocation -- or further evidence 
of neo-Nazi cells inside the police? 
  As early as 1991, worried policemen from Vienna filed a 
complaint: In the telephone exchange of the police building at 
Rossauer Laende a socialist trade union election poster was 
"embellished" with anti-Semitic and Nazi slogans by unknown 
persons. The room is in a "closed area" and is accessible only 
to officers on duty. Despite the immediate report and the 
intervention of Department 1 (state police), investigations came 
to nothing. 
  Texts inspired by right-wing radical ideology even showed up 
at the Interior Ministry. Officials have said that some time 
ago, a racist smearsheet ("Application for Asylum") was 
displayed on the board on which the personnel office usually 
affixes its news. 
  When, last week, PROFIL reported right-wing extremist 
activities and other defects in the police machinery, the 
responsible officials at police headquarters on Schottenring 
started hectic activities. Leading officials rushed from one 
crisis meeting to the next, concentrating their search on the 
leaks inside the police authorities. That police officer who 
does not conceal his right-wing radical convictions and indulges 
in loyal German activities in league with his subordinates in 
the Lower Austrian Waldviertel area, has gone on sick leave. 
Other officers decided to use their accumulated overtime as 
compensatory time. Meanwhile one has started to go through the 
files of the security alert department -- an enclave of radical 
right-wing "hardliners." 
  In connection with the incipient investigations it has 
become 
public that last summer one officer defected to Croatia and 
joined the fascist HVO [Croatian Defense Force] militia. The 
man is said to have taken along a prohibitively expensive night 
vision system from the security alert department. The problem 
is that his colleagues must be cautious and not talk too much 
about it because the high tech equipment had been bought without 
the mandatory invitation to bid. 
  Yet an increasing number of policemen are venting their 
pent-up irritation and frustration about the conditions in the 
security machinery. They are hoping that right-wing radical 
activities in the police will now finally be "stopped." 
  Guenther Marek, vice president of the Vienna police, has not 
spotted "any signs of right-wing extremism," of course. He 
simply refers to his "33 years of experience in the police": 
Some of the young whippersnappers among the officers were 
sometimes going "a bit too far." In a handout, last week the 
trade union group AUF [Action Group for Independents and 
Liberals], close to the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], 
rejected the "denunciations" within the police. Is keeping 
one's mouth shut the police officer's supreme duty? 
  Certainly not. State police officers in Klagenfurt were more 
talkative. The student union there recently received right-wing 
extremist propaganda material, some revisionist stuff, from 
Spain -- sent to "Juergen Hatzenbichler, student." This man 
used to be a member of Gerd Honsik's National Front in 
Carinthia, wrote for Walter Ochensberger's SIEG gazette, and is 
now writing for AULA, IDENTITAET, and JUNGE FREIHEIT. 
  The people from the student union passed the material on to 
the Klagenfurt division of the state police. 
  The officers acted as postmen and handed the letter over to 
Hatzenbichler, not without mentioning from whom they had gotten 
it. The addressee expressed his thanks -- to the student union.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "First Peacekeeping Exercise by NATO </F>
Rapid Response Force"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels (NATO), 31 Jan (BELGA) -- The new NATO 
rapid response force will be organizing its first "large-scale 
maneuvers" in early February in order to prepare for a possible 
UN peacekeeping mission, it was learned from a military source 
on Monday [31 January]. 
  Some 2,000 soldiers -- from the rapid response force 
headquarters (ARRC) -- will take part in this exercise, known as 
"arrcade guard." It will take place between 3 and 9 February in 
the area of Bielefeld (Northwest Germany), relying largely on 
computers to simulate the deployment of 100,000 men. 
  The rapid response force, which can use troops from twelve 
Atlantic alliance countries, including Belgium, is the key 
component of NATO's military mechanism in the post-Cold War era. 
According to NATO Secretary General Manfred Worner, the 
principal task of the ARRC is to defend the territory of the 
twelve member states but certain elements of the unit would in 
the future be deployed on peacekeeping missions outside the NATO 
zone. 
  For its part, the alliance has repeatedly stated that it is 
willing to dispatch -- under the aegis of the United Nations -- 
up to 50,000 men to Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to implement a 
peace plan agreed between the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims. The 
"arrcade guard" exercise will be the first carried out by the 
rapid response force in the field of peacekeeping. It will 
include the simulated deployment of the force headquarters to a 
nonidentified crisis area, the ARRC announced in a communique. 
"The ARRC headquarters will validate the necessary procedures 
for transferring its multinational staff headquarters to a 
foreign country where the mechanisms for responding in support 
of a UN mandate will be tested. This exercise will simulate all 
aspects of such an operation, including cooperation with UN 
agencies and humanitarian organizations, together with the way 
of dealing with local politicians and belligerents," the text 
adds. 
  The force headquarters -- under the command of the British 
Lieutenant General Jeremy Mackenzie -- will command imaginary 
land troops up to 100,000 strong. But only 2,000 men will be 
present in the field as most of the troops will be 
computer-simulated, an ARRC spokesman reports.

  [Text] Brussels, 28 Jan (BELGA) -- Cuban National Assembly 
President Ricardo Alarcon, who has been in Belgium for several 
days, declared that the purpose of his visit was not to ask for 
anything but rather to try to acquaint his European partners 
better with the difficult situation of Cuba. 
  It should be remembered that Cuba is suffering a deep 
economic crisis due to the U.S. blockade and to the loss of its 
privileged contacts with countries of the East bloc. 
  At the end of a visit, during which he met, among others, 
European Commissioner for Development Cooperation Manuel Marin, 
European Parliament Chairman Egon Klepsch, and the presidents of 
the Belgian Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, 
Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb and Frank Swaelen, respectively, Mr. 
Alarcon indicated that Cuba was open to foreign investments, 
tourism, oil, and citrus fruit cultivation, and that any foreign 
investor would be allowed to own 100 percent of his company.

<F P=106> [Article signed ZS; GC: "Mr. Delamuraz Opens 24th Davos </F>
Forum: Appeal for National Policies That Are More Open To 
World"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Davos, 27 Jan (ATS) -- Economic and political 
officials can no longer be content with taking care of business 
at home. Markets and economic activities are becoming more 
global at an increasingly fast rate. "Our national economic 
policies must be adjusted to these realities," said Jean-Pascal 
Delamuraz Thursday evening [27 January] at the opening of the 
24th Davos Forum, in the company of Helmut Kohl and Nestle 
President Helmut Maucher. 
  The [Swiss] Federal Council member felt that the current 
globalization is "the most striking" development of the late 
20th century. The drawing together of human groups is, however, 
nothing new. "In fact it goes all the way back to man's 
discovery of flint," Mr. Delamuraz said. 
  However, the pace at which the phenomenon is accelerating is 
unprecedented. "And we were not prepared for it," continued the 
head of the Federal Department of the Public Economy (DFEP). A 
firm or a market both tend to be attached to a given country. 
"Our economic policies are still largely geared toward this 
national perception." 
<H5>  Rapid European Integration </H5>
  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed for a "quick paced" 
pursuit of European integration, five months before Germany 
takes over the EC presidency. He agreed with Mr. Delamuraz in 
stressing the need for increasing the convergence of the 
European states' national policies. 
  "Only in this way will we obtain all the fruits of economic 
and monetary union," said Mr. Kohl, who was also in favor of 
increased openness in world trade. 
  Support for the new democracies of East Europe must be 
renewed, continued the chancellor. The failure of the reforms 
would be catastrophic, whereas success would offer the only 
chance for peaceful coexistence in Europe. 
<H5>  Bilateral Meetings </H5>
  A number of figures combined their trip to Switzerland for 
the Davos Forum with meetings with Swiss officials. Swiss 
President Otto Stich was to meet Thursday evening with Uzbek 
President Islam Karimov at the Lohn residence. 
  Flavio Cotti, the head of the Federal Department of Foreign 
Affairs (DFAE), met Thursday in Bern with Madagascar Prime 
Minister Francisque Ravony and in Kloten with Danish Foreign 
Minister Niels Helveg Petersen. 
<H5>  'Arafat in Bern </H5>
  On Thursday, the DFAE stressed the importance of the first 
meeting ever between Yasir 'Arafat, Otto Stich, and Flavio Cotti 
planned for Monday in Bern. In doing so, Switzerland is 
demonstrating its desire to continue making a contribution to an 
"irreversible" peace process. 
  In the meantime, Flavio Cotti is to meet on Friday in Bern 
with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Mussa, and in Davos with his 
Israeli counterpart, Shim'on Peres. Mr. Peres and Mr. 'Arafat 
will hold talks in Davos, which will be the most awaited moment 
of the Forum. 
  Mr. Delamuraz is to hold talks on Saturday in Davos with 
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and European Commission 
Vice President Leon Brittan, and on Sunday with Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
<H5>  Number of Participants Reaches Maximum </H5>
  Some 1,200 figures from politics, economics, the arts, and 
the sciences from more than 70 countries signed up for the 24th 
Forum on the world economy in Davos. They will be able to 
participate in some 500 sessions. 
  The number of participants was limited and the number of 
journalists was restricted to 200. Among the figures expected 
to attend, Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who 
is not well, had to cancel her visit to Davos.

<F P=106> [Article signed AZ: "Two Federal Council Members Visit the </F>
Davos Forum This Weekend -- Talks Dominated by GATT and 
Relations With European Union"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA 
database] 
  [Text] Davos, 30 Jan (ATS) -- Federal Council members 
Jean-Pascal Delamuraz and Flavio Cotti extended their bilateral 
contacts this weekend in Davos, on the occasion of the [World] 
Economic Forum. For Mr. Cotti, head of the Federal Department 
of Foreign Affairs [DFAE], the talks focused on relations 
between Switzerland and the European Union [EU]. Meanwhile, Mr. 
Delamuraz was involved in discussions on the implementation of 
the GATT agreements. 
  Concluded in mid-December after seven years of negotiations, 
the Uruguay Round agreements ought to take effect as from 1 
January 1996. "That is the majority opinion emerging in Davos," 
commented Mr. Delamuraz on Sunday [30 January], at the end of 
his attendance at the World Economic Forum (WEF). In 
Switzerland, this deadline for ratification is "tight," the 
federal councillor said during an interview with the ATSA 
database. 
  "The package of around 30 agreements that I will be signing 
on behalf of Switzerland in Marrakesh in April will only be 
available in French, Spanish, and English," explained the head 
of the Federal Department of Public Economy [DFEP]. Now, the 
Federal Council will wait until the official German version of 
the EU is available before it launches the consultation 
procedure. 
  "I was struck by the extremely lucid discussions that took 
place this year among the Forum's participants," the head of the 
DFEP pointed out, summing up his visit. Mr. Delamuraz mainly 
discussed the future of GATT with the 20 or so leading world 
figures whom he met there. 
<H5>  Promising Development </H5>
  Before leaving Davos, Mr. Delamuraz particularly stressed 
the 
Swiss interest in those zones undergoing rapid economic 
development. On Friday, the Federal Council member had given a 
dinner for several members and heads of governments of Southeast 
Asia. "The ASEAN zone is one of the most promising areas for the 
Swiss economy," he said. On Saturday, Mr. Delamuraz also hosted 
a dinner in honor of an Argentine delegation led by Foreign 
Minister Domingo Cavallo. 
  The head of the DFEP also made the most of the presence in 
Davos of his Spanish, French, and Egyptian counterparts to 
exchange views with them bilaterally. Nor did Mr. Delamuraz 
neglect the countries of East Europe. In particular, he met 
with Bulgarian Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, Czech Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus, and head of the Russian Government Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
<H5>  Swiss-EU Relations </H5>
  On Friday and Saturday, Federal Council member Flavio Cotti 
was in Davos, where he discussed relations between Switzerland 
and the EU. He met with the heads of the German, Belgian, and 
Finnish Governments to discuss this topic, as well as with the 
Danish foreign minister. Both Belgium's Jean-Luc Dehaene and 
Denmark's Niels Petersen welcomed the Swiss strategic objective 
-- to join the EU in the medium term -- as a measure of 
confidence. 
  On Friday, Mr. Cotti held talks on the Middle East with his 
Israeli and Egyptian counterparts, Shim'on Peres and 'Amr Musa, 
respectively. The Federal Council member expressed the hope 
that the meeting between Mr. Peres and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat 
would relaunch the peace process. Mr. Cotti was due to meet 
with the Palestinian leader in Bern on Monday, accompanied by 
President of the Swiss Confederation Otto Stich. 
  The chief of Swiss diplomacy took advantage of his presence 
in Davos to meet the South African delegation, during which the 
situation in that country before the first general elections, 
scheduled for 27 April was discussed. Switzerland feels 
committed to work side by side with countries undergoing an 
historical development, Mr. Cotti emphasized. The elimination 
of racial problems in South Africa is one of the main 
preoccupations of the DFAE.

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 30 -- The ruling coalition 
is pledged to continue the programme of reform, and economic 
growth and financial discipline take precedence over social 
programmes, Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of the Democratic 
Left Alliance, assured participants at the World Economic Forum 
in the Swiss resort of Davos at the weekend. 
  Kwasniewski insisted that "the government's priority is the 
development of the economy and the growth of gross domestic 
product. The main elements of reform are to be, and must be, 
continued. There is no other road for our country to reach 
democracy, the market economy and an integrated Europe." 
  He described the September 1993 election victory by leftist 
parties as proof of the maturity of the Polish political system, 
and not as a rejection of the process of reform. However, the 
result showed that personal hopes and expectations were also 
important. 
  Kwasniewski stressed that the government was seeking to 
maintain a very disciplined budgetary policy. He hoped that it 
might be possible to increase pensions and other social 
programmes, but only when the state had first earned the 
financial resources for those aims. At the moment, however, it 
was impossible to fund all such programmes, he said.

  [Text] Davos, 31 January (MTI) -- President Arpad Goncz, 
currently in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum 
and the World Arts Forum, on Sunday [30 January] met Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel, Palestine Liberation Organization 
(PLO) Leader Yasir 'Arafat, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye, and European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) President Jacques de 
Larosiere. 
  Goncz and Demirel agreed that closer political, economic, 
and 
cultural links between Turkey and Hungary could also promote 
Hungary's Western integration in certain areas. Turkey supports 
Hungary's OECD membership and also sees cooperation 
possibilities under the peace-partnership scheme. 
  Goncz confirmed the invitation for Demirel to visit Hungary, 
and they also discussed the situation in the former Yugoslavia, 
including Bosnia-Herzegovina. Goncz said that settlement of the 
conflict is necessary before refugees sheltered by Hungary can 
be returned to their homeland. 
  Demirel expressed Turkey's readiness to join all efforts at 
ironing-out differences and preventing the war from eventually 
spreading to Kosovo, Sanjak, Macedonia, or Vojvodina. 
  The Middle East peace process was the subject of talks 
between 'Arafat and Goncz. Arafat said he hopes for an early 
agreement on the basis of his Davos discussions, because it is 
important for the peace process not to lose its credibility by 
further delay. They also discussed Hungarian-Palestinian 
relations and the reconstruction program. Goncz confirmed an 
invitation for 'Arafat to visit Hungary. 
  Birkavs told Goncz of Latvia's intention to increase ties 
with the Visegrad Group (comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Poland, and Slovakia). He called for new accords with Hungary, 
mainly in business and law. Birkavs cited security as a top 
priority for his country. 
  Goncz welcomed endeavors to boost bilateral links, and 
expressed Hungary's readiness to help Latvia join European 
integration organizations. 
  Goncz asked Paye to back Hungary's efforts to attain full 
OECD membership. Paye expressed his appreciation of previous 
cooperation between various committees of the OECD and Hungary. 
  Accompanied by Hungarian Foreign Economic Minister Bela 
Kadar, Goncz and Larosiere discussed EBRD assistance for 
economic restructuring, privatization, and infrastructure 
projects in Hungary, amounting to ECU200 million so far, plus 
aid commitment of ECU700 million. They also reviewed areas for 
possible additional EBRD support, primarily banks and large 
privatized companies.

  [Text] Davos Jan 31 (CTK) -- The European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) wants to participate in 
the financing of selected infrastructure projects in the Czech 
Republic and cooperate more closely with its banking sector, 
Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech minister for industry and trade, said 
today. 
  Dlouhy, at the World Economic Forum where he met with EBRD 
President Jacques de Larosiere and his colleagues, added that 
the institution wanted to support the Czech Republic's 
"pro-export" policy through cooperating with the government's 
Export Guarantee and Insurance Agency, EGAP. 
  Larosiere is much more interested in specific projects than 
his predecessor, Jacques Attalli, Dlouhy said. The EBRD could, 
for instance, be less adverse to risks and make the policy of 
Czech banks more flexible by investing in their shares. 
  Dlouhy went on to say that the Czech Republic had managed to 
install the fundamental elements of a market economy while 
keeping its macroeconomic stability high and unemployment low, 
and achieving a change in its export orientation. 
  The country will now be rated by its economic growth, as are 
other countries with a market economy, Dlouhy said. "Growth is

  [Text] Davos, Jan 28 (CTK ) -- Most of the tasks now faced 
by the Czech Republic are already of a posttransformation 
nature, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said at a press conference 
held on the occasion of the World Economic Forum [WEF]. 
  He said that the country has already crossed the line 
dividing the old and new political, social and economic systems. 
To put it in medical terminology, the operation is over, but 
the patient may be still be in a rehabilitation center curing 
his muscles, Klaus added. 
  He predicted a 2-3 percent economic growth for the Czech 
Republic this year. Inflation is expected to decrease to a 
one-digit rate, which would be the first case in postcommunist 
Europe, Klaus said and added that unemployment would probably 
slightly grow above the present 3.5 percent. 
  He said that the Czech Republic did not need foreign loans, 
but on the contrary, the influx of foreign capital hampers 
currency policy management.

  [Text] Wolfsberg Jan 31 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic is a 
posttransformation country which "does not need assistance, but 
business," Premier Vaclav Klaus told the Swiss media today. 
  He noted that the Czech Republic had a normal political 
system without any ethnic problems. The pace and dynamism of 
privatisation is more important than the current share -- about 
60 percent of privatised companies in the Czech Republic's total 
production, Klaus said, adding that the share of the private 
sector was nil in the 1980's.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Launches Second Program </F>
for Democracy in the East"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE 
database] 
  [Text] The European Commission announced the launch of its 
second Democracy program for Central and East European 
countries, for a total of ECU12 million, this is: 

  -  The 
second program of its type under the PHARE [Economic 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program, for ECU8 
million, benefiting 11 Central and East European countries; 
  -  A 
first program of the same type for countries of the former USSR, 
for ECU2 million, in the framework of the TACIS [CIS Technical 
Assistance] program (Mongolia, while covered by TACIS, is not 
involved in the program). 
  You will recall that a European Parliament initiative lies 
at 
the origin of these programs, aimed at promoting the development 
of democratic societies based on the rule of law and the 
expression of the free will of the citizens. The current 
program consists above all in a support for selected local 
nongovernmental organizations, through partnerships between them 
and similar organization in states of the Union. Thus, projects 
covering a wide range of activities (but not political party 
activities, nor capital expenditure, nor grants for conferences) 
will be able to benefit from subsidies of up to ECU150,000, 
which could be funded to the tune of 70 percent of the costs of 
each project. One of the conditions, however, is that the 
projects need at least three partners, two from the European 
Union and one from the beneficiary state. Moreover, ECU1 
million extra is planned for those countries benefiting from the 
PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary], with 
view to financing a new aspect of the Program for Democracy, 
i.e. micro-projects: In this case, the subsidies from the 
European Union -- from ECU3,000 to ECU10,000 -- can finance up 
to 90 percent of the cost of the projects, and partnership with 
European Union organizations are not necessary. The European 
Commission will be assisted in the management of the programs by 
the European Human Rights Foundation, which has a lot of 
experience in similar programs undertaken by nongovernmental 
organizations [NGOs] which work to promote human rights and 
democracy. Thus, the Commission will select the projects and 
the Foundation will then follow their implementation.

<F P=106> [Report by Andrew Marshall: "Rights Boost for Europe's </F>
Immigrants"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Radical proposals on immigration and 
asylum would create new rights for Europe's 9 million legal 
immigrants while clamping down on illegal entrants, according to 
officials in Brussels. 
  The proposals are contained in a document from Padraig 
Flynn, 
Commissioner for Social Policy and Immigration. They are the 
first indication of how far the Maastricht treaty may allow the 
European Union [EU] to spread its influence into areas 
previously the preserve of national governments. Mr Flynn, a 
former Irish Justice Minister, risks controversy by tackling 
these issues, particularly as some member states such as Britain 
dispute the Commission's right to take the lead. 
  The document aims to accentuate the positive features of 
immigration, officials say. The message behind the essentially 
liberal plan is that "immigration to Europe has been a positive 
development with substantial economic and social benefits," an 
official said yesterday. "It has been an enriching process." 
  Cash is available to assist in integrating immigrants, say 
officials. Their rights need strengthening, including measures 
to underpin equality, employment, housing, education and 
training, particularly those aged between 20 and 30. Employers 
and unions would be encouraged to adopt a new code of conduct on 
non- discrimination. These programmes would involve "education, 
information and new legislation," officials say. 
  The rights flowing from legal residence vary across the EU 
and are often not recognised in other states. A Turkish worker 
legally resident in Germany, for instance, would have problems 
finding work in Britain. The ways to achieve nationality also 
vary throughout the EU, and the Flynn proposals would focus on 
using dual nationality. Speeding up the process of gaining 
nationality would greatly help to integrate immigrants, 
officials say. 
  Mr Flynn and his officials emphasise this aspect of his 
package, even though it also confronts the other side of the 
issue -- restricting the flow of immigrants into Europe and 
removing those who are already here illegally. The document 
recommends tougher measures against illegal immigrants, with a 
U.S.-style focus on punishing those who employ them. 
  The second aspect of the voluminous package is on 
immigration 
flows, movement of asylum-seekers and immigrants across borders. 
The paper focuses on admission procedures, illegal immigration 
and refugees, all areas already being tackled. EU ministers 
have been working to restrict asylum-seekers by tightening 
definitions, accelerating procedures and weeding out "manifestly 
unfounded claims." 
  The Flynn proposals, however, deal with temporary protection 
for people who, like some of those fleeing the war in former 
Yugoslavia, need shelter, protection and assistance for only a 
limited time. The document spells out ways of sharing the burden 
among EU states when one or more faces a sudden flood of those 
seeking asylum or temporary protection. This controversial idea 
was advocated by Germany -- faced with massive migrant flows -- 
but is resisted by its partners. 
  The third area examined by the paper deals with the pressure 
that causes immigration and the flow of asylum-seekers. It 
recommends using trade and aid agreements to improve conditions 
in the countries that are a source of migration, and toughening 
the stance on human rights with countries where government 
oppression creates refugees. 
  The paper is still being discussed between the different 
services of the Commission and may be put before all 
Commissioners next week. It would then be sent to the Council of 
Ministers, which groups representatives of member states, 
including on this issue the Home Secretary, and the European 
Parliament. The aim is to create a detailed action programme 
for legislation and decisions. 
  The subject matter will be controversial enough. But some 
member states will be deeply opposed to the Commission taking 
the lead. The Maastricht treaty created a common policy on 
Justice and Home Affairs, but measures are largely left to 
member states. 
  Many proposals will be welcomed by those working on behalf 
of 
immigrants and asylum-seekers. But they will horrify right-wing 
opponents of the EU, since they combine the incendiary elements 
of immigration and the Maastricht treaty. 
  They put more emphasis on the rights of immigrants and 
asylum 
seekers than previous decisions by EU governments that 
concentrated on creating a "Fortress Europe." 
  The Commission may be taking a generous view of its 
abilities 
under Maastricht. But Mr Flynn's officials point to existing 
powers in the area of social policy which enable him to take 
initiatives. And they point out that many of the issues raised 
relate to the completion of the single market.

<F P=106> [Article by John Carvel: "Eurocrats Enraged by Vetting </F>
Plan"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Two thousand Eurocrats who control the 
levers of power in Brussels are threatening industrial action 
against plans to subject some of them to vetting by MI5 and 
other security services. 
  Documents obtained by THE GUARDIAN show elaborate procedures 
are being put in place to guard the confidentiality of papers on 
foreign policy and police co-operation -- subjects which the 
Maastricht Treaty brought for the first time within the ambit of 
the European Union [EU]. 
  The proposals amount to a blueprint for an EU official 
secrets act. They include all the paraphernalia of 
counter-espionage, such as codes for the electronic transmission 
of sensitive information, perforation numbers to personalise 
each copy of written material, and a classification hierarchy to 
distinguish between top secret, secret, confidential, or merely 
restricted. 
  The changes relate to work done by the secretariat of the 
council of ministers, where the collective decisions of national 
governments are prepared and executed. 
  Niels Ersboll, its secretary-general, has told 
representatives of his 2,200 staff that he expects 370 will need 
positive vetting. They will be assessed by the security services 
of their own country. Most will be lawyers and translators. 
  The plan has caused uproar among secretariat personnel who 
think vetting unnecessary since staff regulations already allow 
for violations of secrecy to be punished by dismissal and loss 
of pension rights. 
  Gunther Lorenz, vice president of the staff association, 
said 
yesterday that his members particularly objected to the lack of 
opportunity for an appeal against a negative security report 
which might blight an official's career. 
  Staff considered themselves to be members of a European 
civil 
service which proudly resisted national interference. Now they 
might be refused clearance because of behaviour in their home 
countries during their youth. 
  Staff wanted minimum guarantees, including an appeals 
procedure. They might be balloted on a strike. 
  "We feel we are not strong enough to stop the vetting 
completely, but we want some minimum guarantees," Mr Lorenz said. 
  "If a member state's security service writes a negative 
report, it must give reasons against which the official can 
appeal. 
  "If we do not obtain satisfaction, we will be obliged to 
convene a general meeting and, if necessary, call a general 
strike." 
  Senior officials believe a full strike is unlikely, but they 
are aware of the danger of a work to rule. In previous disputes 
staff have come close to immobilising the council of ministers 
by refusing to work in any language other than their mother 
tongue. 
  In the face of this threat, diplomats from the member states 
have made a few concessions, but it is understood they are being 
resisted by hardliners on the K4 committee of senior 
representatives from the Home Office and EU interior ministries. 
  The fourth draft of the plan will be discussed today in 
Brussels. 
  Before the Maastricht treaty came into force co-operation 
between member states was handled outside the Community 
framework. 
  Alex Falconer, Labour MEP for Mid-Scotland and Fife, who led 
the parliament's successful campaign to quash previous attempts 
to introduce a Community official secrecy regime, said the 
council of ministers was trying to bypass democratic control. 
  Diplomats are aware that the issue could have serious 
repercussions in Sweden, Norway and Finland, whose governments 
are negotiating membership of the EU. 
  The proposals are likely to meet opposition in the European 
Parliament.

<F P=106> [David White report: "Eurofighter Set for Maiden Flight by </F>
May"] 
  [Text] Industrial partners in the 32 billion pound 
Eurofighter project are confident that the four-nation aircraft 
will make its maiden flight by the end of April -- more than two 
years later than originally planned. 
  The Munich-based Eurofighter consortium said no date had 
been 
fixed for the flight, which was postponed last autumn because of 
difficulties with the jet's computerised flight-control system. 
But the aircraft was in its "last test phase." 
  The first prototype of the twin-engine Eurofighter 2000 
being 
developed jointly by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, is due 
for trials at Manching in Germany in the next few weeks. An 
initial private flight is expected at Manching in March or April 
before it appears in public. Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence 
procurement minister, has told the Commons that the fighter 
might be on display at September's Farnborough air show. 
  Although the industry consortium has played down the 
importance of the first flight in the overall development 
programme, senior managers are extremely anxious to avoid 
further delay, fearing it could undermine political support for 
the Eurofighter and jeopardise production prospects. 
  British Aerospace, the principal UK partner, has meanwhile 
agreed to take joint responsibility for the flight-control 
system with Deutsche Aerospace, which has headed this part of 
the project. The new arrangement is designed to make the two 
directly answerable to the partner governments and put pressure 
on them and their sub-contractors -- notably GEC-Marconi which 
is supplying the crucial software -- to meet their contract 
dates. 
  The partners decided to hold further tests on the system 
after crashes of both the Swedish Gripen and the U.S. F-22, 
which also depend on sophisticated flight-control technology. 
  The consortium is still in talks with government 
representatives over a new contract price for the roughly 10 
billion pound development programme. This follows changes to 
the programme agreed in late 1992 which were designed to reduce 
the eventual production cost. 
  The companies are seeking price increases to reflect the 
longer development period now planned. On the other hand the 
governments hold the consortium responsible for delays caused by 
technical hitches. 
  The Ministry of Defence would have to seek Treasury approval 
for any increase in Britain's share of the cost.

Wednesday [26 January] evening in Paris, a plan to improve 
maritime safety and reduce pollution. According to a communique 
published on Thursday by the French Transport Ministry, the plan 
concerns the following five points for 
action: 

  -  Reinforcement of the fight against "substandard" 
ships; 
  -  The obligation to have markings/signalings in the 
Channel/North Sea zone; 
  -  Immediate application of container 
stowing regulations by the International Maritime Organization 
[IMO]; 
  -  Maximum safety requirements for passenger 
transport; 
  -  Reinforcement of means of intervention. 
  The communique stresses, moreover, that the five countries 
concerned "are ready to act together in London with the IMO and 
in Brussels with the European Union."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Meets With Vranitzky"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna, 31 Jan (ANSA) -- The upcoming general 
elections in Italy, Austria's drive to join the European Union 
[EU] and the conflict in the neighboring ex-Yugoslavia were the 
focal points of talks here between visiting Italian Premier 
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky. 
  In a joint press conference following their meeting, both 
government chiefs underscored the importance of the major 
political events in their respective countries, the elections 
and EU membership, and stressed the "excellent" relations 
between their two countries which they agreed were highlighted 
by economic and cultural exchanges of "the utmost quality." 
  Premier Ciampi added how Rome and Vienna had consolidated 
their collaboration not only on a bilateral level, but also on 
an international one, and reiterated Italy's full support for 
Austria's membership in the European Union. Looking at the 
political evolution in Italy, the Austrian chancellor observed 
how "every nation, from time to time, goes through more or less 
strong political change" adding how it was the duty of 
neighboring countries "to take note of the rhythm of this change 
and draw the consequences for themselves." 
  Vranitzky had words of praise for Premier Ciampi, whom he 
described as "one of the interpreters and fundamental promoters" 
of Italy's political and institutional renewal, and that he 
wished him all his best. 
  Turning their attention to the ex-Yugoslavia, Ciampi said 
both he and the Austrian chancellor agreed on the need to 
intensify their common commitment in international forums in the 
search for a solution. In reference to the ex-Yugoslavia's 
territorial closeness to both Italy and Austria, the Italian 
premier stressed how their common frustration for the duration 
and brutality of the conflict had to be translated into a 
stimulus for a greater commitment in the search for a solution. 
  Ciampi then went on to deny criticisms that the policy of 
the 
European Union towards the ex-Yugoslavia was being carried out 
on the front line by France, Germany and Britain. Italy, he 
argued, was on the front line with its participation through the 
European Union and NATO and its contribution to United Nations' 
efforts, but as a neighboring country its actions were limited. 
  Nevertheless, Ciampi stressed, this was in no way an apology 
for the failure, up to now, of the international community to 
find an effective solution and this has created "a felling of 
frustration which must be transformed into a motive for greater 
commitment." 
  For his part, Chancellor Vranitzky voiced Austria's 
"enormous 
admiration" for Italy's commitment in the ex-Yugoslavia and 
expressed his and his nation's condolences for the deaths of the 
Italian three-man television news teams in Mostar last week.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan 21 (CTK) -- Czech Minister of Industry 
and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy said on Thursday [20 January] that 
Austria had stopped anti-dumping proceedings against the Czech 
Republic, regarding Czech exports of cement, tractors, and other 
farm machinery to Austria, since it had been proved that 
accusations of dumping had no factual basis. 
  Speaking to CTK at the close of his one-day talks in Vienna, 
Dlouhy said that only the problem concerning imports of 
industrial fertilizers from the Czech Republic remains to be 
solved. 
  In his talks with Austrian Minister of Environment Maria 
Rauch-Kallat concerning the Czech nuclear power plants at 
Temelin, south Bohemia, and Dukovany, south Moravia, Dlouhy said 
that Temelin would be completed. He refuted the opinion voiced 
at times in Austria that Temelin was a Russian project. He 
pointed out that Temelin would have safety standards 
corresponding to those of Germany, Switzerland, France, and 
other advanced countries. 
  During his talks with Economic Affairs Minister Wolfgang 
Schussel, Dlouhy expressed interest in talks on Austria's 
integration into the European Union (EU). Dlouhy said these 
talks might be instructive for the Czech Republic as all 
Austrian representatives were convinced of the positive effect 
of the integration on Austria's economy.

  [Text] Dolni Dvoriste/Linz, Lower Austria, Jan 26 (CTK) -- 
Three members of the Czech UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] unit 
suspected of small arms smuggling were detained for further 
questioning this evening, while the remainder were permitted to 
cross into the Czech Republic, the Austrian news agency APA 
reports. 
  The Austrian border authority at the Wullovitz crossing 
found 
the three soldiers to be in possession of six hand grenades and 
one pistol. The soldiers are thought to have brought the 
weapons back as mementos of their service in ex-Yugoslavia, APA 
writes. 
  The unit's two transport buses, which had been searched by 
the border guard, were given customs clearance earlier this 
evening and the 67 remaining troops continued their journey into 
the Czech Republic, where customs clearance preceded without 
problems. 
  The three members of the Czech UNPROFOR unit suspected of 
small arms smuggling and detained for further questioning this 
evening, were handed to the Foreign Police Office at Dolni 
Dvoriste at 2200, Jan Bruzek from the office told CTK. 
  According to Vienna observers, the police action was well 
prepared in advance which is also proved by the fact that 
cameramen from Austrian Television arrived immediately on the 
spot. 
  The Austrian police have refused to tell CTK were the 
suspicion of arms smuggling by Czech soldiers had originated. 
  All the 70 soldiers were travelling home for a regular 
leave.

<F P=106> [David Owen and Michael Cassell article: "U.S. Urged To Keep </F>
Ban on Adams"] 
  [Text] The government last night sent a clear signal to 
Washington that any decision to lift its ban on Mr Gerry Adams 
entering the U.S. would be unwelcome, unless the Sinn Fein 
president renounced violence. 
  In comments made less than 48 hours before a decision on the 
ban is due, Downing Street officials said they hoped a visa 
would not be given to Mr Adams unless he made "a clear and 
unequivocal renunciation of violence." It was "deeds not words" 
that were required, the officials emphasised. They said the 
government had been "in discussion" with the U.S. on the subject. 
  The signal came as the IRA left fire bombs at three stores 
in 
Oxford Street, London's busiest shopping street, in what was 
believed to be the first mainland terrorist action of the year. 
  Yesterday also saw Northern Ireland's first sectarian 
murders 
of 1994 when a Roman Catholic man was shot dead as he slept in 
Belfast. A second man was killed at Ballymena and a third was 
shot dead in Donaghadee, County Down. 
  The attacks came on the eve of the first session of the 
Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference since the two 
governments unveiled their joint peace initiative in December. 
  The conference is likely to provide the opportunity for both 
governments to reaffirm their joint position on the peace 
initiative. 
  A display of unity over the progress of the political talks 
coordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, 
may be harder to engineer. London has indicated that it intends 
to act, as promised, to give focus to the talks fairly soon, 
although this may come in bilateral and private sessions. 
Dublin is anxious not to divert attention from the peace 
process. 
  Mr Adams recently applied for a visa at the American Embassy 
in Dublin after receiving an invitation to attend a conference 
in New York on Monday [31 January]. 
  Under U.S. immigration law, he is still officially 
ineligible 
for a visa but a waiver can be issued by the attorney general on 
recommendation from Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of 
state. 
  It is understood that President Bill Clinton has been 
involved in the decision-making process and that a series of 
meetings took place in Washington on Wednesday. A number of 
Irish-American politicians have lobbied on Mr Adams' behalf. 
  The leaders of the Ulster Unionists and the hardline 
Democratic Unionist party [DUP] have already declined an 
invitation to attend the conference. 
  The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the DUP, yesterday told the 
organisers that he would not attend a meeting "designed to give 
credibility and legitimacy to the apologist for IRA murder." Mr 
John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and 
Labour party, and Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance 
party, are expected to attend.

<F P=106> [Report by Martin Fletcher in Washington and Arthur </F>
Leathley: "U.S. Visa for Adams Angers No. 10"] 
  [Text] President Clinton rebuffed and angered the British 
Government last night by granting Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein 
leader, a restricted visa to enter America to attend a 
conference on Northern Ireland in New York tomorrow. 
  The President did so despite his Administration's failure to 
elicit from Mr Adams the unequivocal renunciation of violence 
and declaration of support for the Anglo-lrish peace effort that 
it had agreed with Britain should be the minimum conditions for 
letting him in. 
  The decision comes on the eve of the visit to Washington by 
Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary, and seems certain to raise new 
questions about the so-called "special relationship" since Mr 
Clinton took power. It is almost inconceivable that the Bush or 
Reagan Administrations would have delivered such a public slap 
in the face to America's closest ally. 
  Though the move caught Downing Street officials by surprise, 
they said the decision to provide a visa was "a matter for the 
U.S." British officials in Washington were making 
representations to the White House at the weekend. Putting a 
brave face on events, Downing Street said it hoped the New York 
conference would impress on Mr Adams the need to end violence 
permanently. There was no indication that John Major considered 
Mr Adams's words as amounting to an acceptance of U.S. 
conditions. 
  Mr Adams said last night that he had received no official 
notification of the American decision but had had "a very 
interesting exchange of views" with American consular officials. 
He said he had not been asked to renounce violence. 
  John D. Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, said the 
decision was despicable and that the Clinton Administration had 
"given in" to pressure from the Irish lobby in Washington. 
  Mr Clinton has been under pressure to let in Mr Adams from 
Senators Edward Kennedy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose 
support he needs for his health care reforms, and from 38 
congressmen who argue that the U.S. should foster "constructive 
dialogue" instead of violence. 
  The State and Justice Departments and the FBI had agreed 
with 
Britain that Mr Adams's application should be rejected because 
of his terrorist links, as eight before it had been. Their views 
were apparently overruled by the National Security Council and 
by Nancy Soderberg, NSC third-in-command and a former aide to 
Senator Kennedy. The White House said Mr Clinton supported the 
decision which he believed would "help advance the cause of 
peace in Northern Ireland."

<F P=106> [Report by Martin Walker in Washington, David Sharrock in </F>
Belfast, Joe Joyce in Dublin and Stephen Bates: "U.S. Grants 
Entry Visa to Adams"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Government spurned British urgings and 
announced last night that it would grant a visa for the Sinn 
Fein president, Gerry Adams, to visit America for a conference 
on Northern Ireland in New York this week. 
  The visa will allow him to launch a media blitz on behalf of 
the republican cause but not to raise funds. 
  Officials said Mr Adams will be allowed to stay only 48 
hours, be barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New 
York and not allowed to engage in "direct or indirect fund 
raising." 
  The ostensible purpose of his trip is to attend a conference 
of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a 
non-profit group whose honorary chairman is the former secretary 
of state Henry Kissinger. 
  Some members of Congress opposed the visa as a dangerous 
concession that could only result in political comfort for the 
IRA. The U.S. decision followed a statement in which Mr Adams 
declared himself to be against all forms of violence in Northern 
Ireland, "including the violence of the British army and 
security forces," and said he looked forward to the disbandment 
of the IRA. 
  Mr Adams has been repeatedly denied admission to the United 
States over the past 20 years on grounds of his alleged 
involvement in terrorism. 
  Ulster Unionists and Conservative backbenchers will be 
concerned that American-Irish politicians will give him a 
publicity platform and effectively condone terrorism. 
  The British Government said that Sinn Fein would be judged 
by 
deeds, not words. A spokesman said: "The fact is that Adams 
said in a statement that he wants to end violence and is working 
towards supporting the Downing Street declaration, and it is on 
that basis that he is being admitted, under very strict 
conditions for 48 hours. The British Government does not issue 
visas for admission to the U.S." 
  Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, Kevin McNamara, said: 
"We are against exclusion orders in principle. It is purely an 
internal domestic matter for the United States Government, and I 
have no views about it." 
  Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South 
Tyrone, who refused to go to the same conference if Mr Adams was 
there, said last night: "My understanding was that two 
conditions were being imposed on Mr Adams, firstly that he 
accepted the Downing Street declaration and secondly that the 
IRA would cease violence. I cannot believe that he has accepted 
either of those." 
  Sammy Wilson, spokesman for the hardline Democratic Unionist 
Party, last night deplored the U.S. decision. "It's quite clear 
since the declaration was signed on December 15 that the payoff 
for the IRA was coming. They've had their secret talks with the 
British Government, the broadcasting ban in the Irish Republic 
has been lifted and even the Americans are in the payoff too by 
giving their terrorist leader a plafform." 
  The conference will give Mr Adams the opportunity to 
reinvigorate the U.S. support for Sinn Fein, and to appear on as 
many U.S. TV news and talkshows as he can squeeze in. 
  The Clinton administration had said last week that its 
decision would depend on a statement of Mr Adams's views on 
violence and his readiness to support the peace efforts of John 
Major and the Irish Government. 
  British officials in Washington last night were putting the 
best face on their defeat, suggesting that if Mr Adams lived up 
to his statement, Northern Ireland would benefit. If he did 
not, the U.S. Government would learn its lesson, and Sinn Fein 
would lose credibility. 
  President Clinton was under strong pressure from congressmen 
with influential Irish-American constituencies. Democratic 
senators Teddy Kennedy of Massachusetts, who faces a difficult 
re-election battle this year, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New 
York, whose chairmanship of the finance commitee gives him a 
near-stranglehold on Mr Clinton's domestic agenda, had both 
urged that the visa be granted. 
  Before the announcement from Washington, Mr Adams had denied 
he had renounced violence as a condition of getting the visa. He 
said in Dublin that he had had "a very interesting exchange of 
views" with a senior U.S. official which showed that the Clinton 
administration was acquainting itself with the republican 
position. 
  The Irish Government remained aloof from the controversy 
sticking to its formal line that it was entirely a matter for 
Washington. It is believed to have cautioned the Americans 
against allowing Mr Adams too much latitude.

<F P=106> [Conor Cruise O'Brien article: "Danger Abroad If Only You </F>
Look"] 
  [Text] Washington -- President Clinton's State of the Union 
message on Tuesday [25 January] was long on domestic affairs, 
short on foreign policy, which got two pages out of 15. This is 
clearly how the American people want it at present. Up to a 
point, this is to be welcomed. It is better for the U.S. and 
the world that the U.S. Government should give priority to those 
things it can do something about than that it should continue to 
toy with the dangerous illusion of a new world order, a global 
Pax Americana. 
  Yet there are other illusions, almost as dangerous. The 
prevailing illusion, which the President has been fostering, is 
that the world has become a much safer place than it used to be. 
The President's European trip was presented in such a way as to 
encourage that comforting notion. 
  Cosy pictures of a jovial Clinton with a Yeltsin at least 
doing his best to smile carried the message that the Russians 
now love us and the bad old days are over. Signs that there is 
a great and growing number of Russians who don't love us at all, 
and yearn to return to the bad old days, are excluded from the 
world of presidential social calls. 
  A glaring example of escape from reality into a roseate 
world 
on that presidential tour was the case of the meetings with the 
President of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, who promised to get rid 
of his country's nuclear weapons. In the atmosphere of the 
tour, the distinction between promise and fulfilment was 
ignored. So was the fact that Kravchuk had already made such a 
promise, and been overruled by his parliament. Nor could anyone 
possibly allude, in that euphoric atmosphere, to the forces that 
are beginning to tear Ukraine apart, with its nuclear weapons up 
for grabs between contending ethnically based military factions. 
  The President who promised, and the parliament which 
overruled him, and the country which both of them represent may 
all have vanished from the scene before the year is out. But 
for the moment, that most tenuous of promises holds the 
international stage. That last expression has become more than 
a metaphor, in the age of television. A pastoral illusion, 
conjured up by the camera, keeps grim reality at bay. One is 
reminded of Marie Antoinette and her world of make-believe in 
the Petit Trianon on the eve of disaster. 
  There was just one moment in the State of the Union message 
when the President took account, only implicitly, of the actual 
state of the world outside America. This was when he promised 
that there would be no further defence cuts. That sober and 
sensible promise was at variance, however, with the general 
thrust of his reassuring message. 
  The President is doing well, right now, in domestic matters, 
and stands high in the polls. Whitewatergate has not yet begun 
to hurt. But it is as a leader of the free world that Clinton 
continues to fail to impress. It is not just a question of 
conducting policy by photo calls, though that is a significant 
part of the trouble. More important is the fact that he has 
lost authority in the most vital area: that of defence. 
  He has done so as a result o his attempt to challenge the 
military establishment on the question of gays in the military. 
The military establishment is not normally a monolith, but an 
assemblage of competing factions. The fact that these groups 
have to compete for presidential favour in the allocation of 
resources an over senior appointments and promotions is a great 
factor making for health in the system, in the sense of 
maintaining the reality of civilian control. 
  But Clinton's profoundly misguided initiative on gays in the 
military had the effect of causing the establishment to close 
ranks against him, and to defeat him. As he retreated before a 
skilfully orchestrated public relations barrage financed out of 
the military budget, he sacrificed his Secretary of Defence, Les 
Aspin, who had tried to carry out his policy, and became his 
scapegoat. 
  When his choice as replacement, Bobby Ray Inman, withdrew on 
his own initiative, Clinton could think of nothing better to do 
than to nominate Aspin's deputy, William J. Perry. The Pentagon 
indicated satisfaction. The whole protracted episode has 
seriously weakened presidential control over defence policy and 
therefore also over foreign policy. 
  The weakness is apparent in policy towards NATO and the 
Partnership for Peace idea. This is now taking the form of 
associating the East European countries with NATO, but not 
admitting them to membership in it. In an important article 
this week, Henry Kissinger has challenged this idea, urging full 
membership for those countries. 
  The case is a strong one. If, as is well within the bounds 
of possibility, Russia returns to an aggressive posture, the 
West will need to draw a clear line somewhere. It is not now 
doing so. "Associated" status leaves the East European countries 
in a grey area. To Russian expansionists -- clearly a 
significant force in the new Russian parliament -- exclusion of 
the East European countries from NATO sends the signal that the 
West will not defend these countries if they are attacked. 
There is an ominous Korean precedent here. The U.S. did not 
formally guarantee South Korea as it did other countries. North 
Korea, with Stalin's approval, saw this as a green light, and 
the Korean war was the result. A clear line was not drawn then, 
and is not being drawn now. 
  In general, the leadership of the West hardly seems in good 
shape to handle the great challenges likely to be coming from 
the East. European union is a myth as far as formation of 
foreign policy is concerned. American leadership under Clinton 
is a photocall facade, for the moment at least. It is likely 
that the eastern challenges, as they develop, will eventually 
produce a greater degree of Western unity and leadership. But 
the early stages of any new challenges may involve us all in 
some unpleasant surprises.

<F P=106> [David Owen, Jimmy Burns, and David White report: "UK Arms </F>
in Saudi Deal Exempt From Export Regulations"] 
  [Text] Saudi Arabia is under no obligation to give details 
of the end users of defence equipment supplied by Britain under 
the 20bn [billion] pounds Al-Yamamah defence deal, the 
government said yesterday. 
  The potentially embarrassing disclosure, came in a 
parliamentary written answer by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence 
procurement minister. 
  Mr Aitken said defence equipment exports under the 
Al-Yamamah 
deal had "Crown status", in common with all government defence 
exports, and were "therefore not subject to export licensing 
requirements." 
  It also emerged last night that the disclosure had earlier 
been brought to the attention of Lord Justice Scott who is 
conducting the arms-for-lraq inquiry. 
  Evidence before the inquiry shows that the government 
pressed 
ahead with defence deals with Saudi Arabia in spite of being 
warned by intelligence and some officials that the country was 
possibly being used to divert military equipment to Iraq. 
  Mr Paul Regan, a spokesman for the Scott inquiry, said the 
judge was looking at the potential loopholes inherent in Crown 
status arrangements, which are believed to cover a number of 
other potentially sensitive defence deals, and the extent to 
which the government had adhered to restrictions on exports to 
Iraq directly or through a third country. 
  Al-Yamamah is a two-stage government-to-government deal 
covering supplies of British arms, infrastructure, and defence 
services worth more than 2bn pounds per year. 
  Mr Jim Cousins, the Labour MP who tabled the parliamentary 
question, said yesterday that the government's answer was "of 
very considerable significance" in the light of evidence given 
to the Scott inquiry. 
  Mr Cousins said the answer showed there was "a great hole" 
in 
the export licence control system. 
  The Ministry of Defence said last night that there was no 
requirement for transactions with Crown status either to have 
export sales licences or for end-user details to be provided. 
  Mr Aitken said sales under Al Yamamah were subject to "the 
normal foreign and defence policy considerations." 
  The Al-Yamamah deal dates from 1985 and was reinforced in 
1988. Although signed by defence secretaries Mr Michael 
Heseltine and his successor Mr George Younger, now Lord Younger 
of Prestwick, it had from the outset the strong personal backing 
of Lady Thatcher the then prime minister. 
  A year ago, Mr John Major, the prime minister, secured the 
latest order for arms estimated to be worth 4bn-5bn pounds total. 
  Full details of the deal have never been disclosed. British 
officials and industrialists have said this was at the 
insistence of the Saudi authorities.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Southern Front"] </F>
  [Text] When Europeans talk about security in the post-cold 
war world, they often find they are not talking about the same 
thing. Germany worries about the stability of its central 
European neighbours; Britain worries about the health of the 
Atlantic alliance; Mediterranean countries worry about their 
Arab neighbours, especially Algeria. All those worries are 
legitimate, and should be addressed by the EU's [European 
Union's] common foreign and security policy. The last, 
especially, should be taken more seriously in northern Europe 
than it has been so far. 
  Two years ago the Algerian army intervened to forestall the 
election victory of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. It 
proposed to smash the violent hard core of the opposition while 
introducing economic reforms to restore hope to those who had 
joined it out of despair. That strategy has not worked. In 
fact, the economic side of it has not even been tried. The bold 
economic reforms launched between 1989 and 1991 have been 
reversed, making impossible any deal with the IMF and Algeria's 
other creditors on the country's $25 billion foreign debt, which 
will absorb 100 per cent of its export revenue this year. 
  Politically, Islamic militants denied power through the 
ballot box have turned to violence. Repression, accompanied by 
human rights violations, has further radicalised the opposition, 
and even secular parties boycotted the "national consensus 
conference" held by the regime this week, since the exclusion of 
the FIS deprived it of credibility. The country is sliding into 
civil war. 
  These developments threaten Europe on several levels. Civil 
war invariably produces large flows of refugees, many of whom in 
this case would be bound to cross the Mediterranean. Their 
arrival would exacerbate racial tensions. The war could spread 
to north African communities in Europe. Islamic militants, if 
they lose, might resort to terrorism not only against Europeans 
in Algeria but against targets in Europe itself. If they win 
after a long and bitter struggle, Europe would face a prickly 
and hostile neighbour within easy missile range. Either way, an 
Algeria racked by civil war and deprived of much of its 
Westernised middle class would not attract foreign investment 
and would be likely to stagnate economically. Europe could face 
more and more poor and angry people on its very doorstep. 
  Only a genuine dialogue between the army and the FIS offers 
any hope of a peaceful solution. The EU should use its good 
offices to help bring this about. By promising economic aid and 
increased market access for a peaceful, democratic Algeria, it 
could offer an incentive to both sides to negotiate, and 
reassurance to those in the country who fear that an Islamic 
victory would mean isolation from Europe and wholesale 
suppression of human rights. Continued support for the status 
quo can only store up worse trouble for the future.

<F P=106> [Peter Ruddell article: "Surge by Labour Captures Slice of </F>
Middle-Class Vote"] 
  [Text] The Labour Party is now at its highest position in 
the opinion polls since October 1990, just before Margaret 
Thatcher was ousted from Downing Street. 
  The party has made big gains among the middle classes so it 
is, for the first time, level pegging with the Conservatives 
among this group of voters. 
  The latest MORI poll for The Times underlines how Labour has 
advanced strongly since the late summer, largely at the expense 
of the Liberal Democrats. Labour now stands at 48 per cent, 
compared with 42 per cent last August, while the Liberal 
Democrats have slipped from 25 to 20 per cent. The Tories are on 
28 per cent, the same level, plus or minus one point, they have 
been on since the Newbury by-election nine months ago. 
  It is striking that the party's rating has not shifted over 
the past month, despite the headlines about the personal lives 
of some Tory ministers and MPs, the row over back to basics and 
the recent arguments about tax increases. This suggests that 
Tory support has probably bottomed out and is now down to a hard 
core. 
  That can be read as either some comfort for the Tories that 
their position is not deteriorating, or worrying that there is 
no sign of any pick-up -- especially since this is the same 
level of support that Labour had at its low point during Michael 
Foot's leadership. 
  The Labour advance has been most striking among the middle 
classes, now two-fifths of the electorate. Tory support in the 
middle classes has fallen steadily since the late 1970s, even 
though its national share of the vote has declined only slightly. 
  Even when the Conservatives were in serious trouble in the 
middle of previous parliaments, the party was still well ahead 
of Labour among these voters. In the late summer of 1990, when 
Labour was last at 48 per cent nationally, it trailed the Tories 
among the middle classes by 32 to 49 per cent. 
  At the 1992 election, the Tories were ahead of Labour among 
the middle classes by 54 to 22 per cent. Now, the two parties 
are level at 37 per cent. Labour remains well ahead of the 
Tories among working class voters. 
  This shift in the middle classes is particularly serious for 
the Conservatives since it threatens their heartlands in the 
South of England. The latest poll shows that Labour has moved 
into the lead in the South, including Greater London. The party 
now has 39 per cent support, ahead of the Tories on 31 per cent 
and the Liberal Democrats on 28 per cent. 
  Both the opposition parties have advanced at the Tories' 
expense in the South since the general election -- Labour doing 
well in the South East and the Liberal Democrats in the South 
West. This means that a sizeable number of Conservative marginal 
seats are under threat. 
  Also worrying for the Tories is that Labour has moved well 
ahead among the elderly. It now has the support of 50 per cent 
of pensioners. 
  There is no sign of any recovery in the ratings of either 
the 
Government or John Major. Just 13 per cent are satisfied with 
the way the Government is running the country, with 80 per cent 
dissatisfied, the same as last month. 
  A mere 21 per cent are satisfied with the way Mr Major is 
doing his job as Prime Minister, with 71 per cent dissatisfied. 
This is only just above the low points touched last summer. Only 
just over a half even of the reduced number of Tory supporters 
are satisfied with Mr Major's performance. 
  Even though Labour has strengthened its position over the 
past month, John Smith is still not making much impact with 
voters as Labour leader. Exactly the same number are satisifed 
as dissatisfied with the way he is doing his job as Labour 
leader, following three months when his rating has been 
positive. Paddy Ashdown's rating as Leader of the Liberal 
Democrats remains favourable, though it has slipped steadily 
since the autumn.

  [Excerpt] Mainz (DPA) -- Chancellor Kohl is of the opinion 
that there will be no lasting peace without integrating East 
European states into the European Union [EU]. "We will never 
resign ourselves to the EU border being the border between 
Germany and Poland," Kohl said in Mainz today at a reception for 
33 bishops from throughout Europe. Europe was in the process of 
taking up the great tradition of coexistence. Everyone should 
be grateful about the progress achieved. 
  Beforehand the chancellor attended a celebration mass in 
Mainz Cathedral at the conclusion of the 24th General Assembly 
of the Council of Catholic European Bishops' Conferences. At 
the service, the bishops called on the warmongers in former 
Yugoslavia to stop their merciless actions, and said they hoped 
peace would be achieved. 
  Kohl warned that no one was immune to developments such as 
those in former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn/Washington (DPA) -- In a talk with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has advocated 
preserving the disputed aviation agreement between the two 
countries from the "mills of inner-American company 
competition." At a working lunch on Monday [31 January], he 
told Clinton that "not only the text but also the spirit of the 
agreement must be fulfilled," the chancellor told the press in 
Washington. 
  The new agreement, which was negotiated in autumn, is in 
danger because the U.S. Administration so far has only partially 
approved it. Exports from both sides want to make a new state 
this week to abolish the differences of opinion. 
  The outcome of the controversy is important for the German 
Lufthansa airline, which has concluded an agreement with the 
U.S. airline United Airlines on joint services (code sharing) on 
the basis of this agreement. This, too, has not yet been 
accepted by Washington as a whole. Lufthansa chief Juergen 
Weber said a partial approval, according to which Lufthansa can 
offer flights in the United States in cooperation with United 
Airlines is "almost worthless." The partner company has not yet 
been granted the same rights by the U.S. side for Germany and 
other countries. The Bonn Transportation Ministry said it would 
be a violation of good faith if the United States were to try to 
call the bases of cooperation between Lufthansa and United 
Airlines into question. 
  The U.S. competitors American and Delta Airlines are raging 
at the U.S. Administration against the agreements between the 
two companies. In this connection, it was said in Bonn that 
these airlines should know that they are hurting themselves by 
torpedoing the agreement. Informed circles did not rule out 
that the Federal Government might cancel the old contract, on 
which the new agreement is based. This would mean that every 
single U.S. flight to the FRG would have to be approved 
individually.

  [Text] Bonn, Warsaw, Jan 28 -- Defence Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk paid a one-day visit to Germany on Friday [28 
January] to discuss the implementation of the U.S.-sponsored 
Partnership for Peace programme with his German counterpart 
Volker Ruehe. 
  Both ministers agreed to hold joint military exercises in 
Autumn, this year. They did not talk about the date by which 
Poland will become NATO member but confirmed the opinion that 
Partnership for Peace is the first step in this direction. 
  Kolodziejczyk and Ruehe also summed up cooperation between 
the Polish Armed Forces and the Bundeswehr. This cooperation 
will include contacts of Polish and German Navy on the Baltic 
Sea, exchange of commanding experience, the training of Polish 
soldiers in the Bundeswehr training centres, and the exchange of 
officers and lecturers from military academies. 
  In Kolodziejczyk's opinion, Poland ranks first among former 
Communist countries in military cooperation with Germany. He 
said that Germany wants to provide Poland with organizational 
and technical assistance on Poland's "way to European security 
structures." The German side supports the idea of joint 
military training, especially at the lowest level of a company. 
  The minister announced that bilateral contacts will 
intensify 
after 31 August when the Russian Army leaves Germany.

<F P=106> [Alan Cane report: "Saudi Royals Set Up Mobile Telephone </F>
Network in Secret"] 
  [Text] The Saudi royal family has secretly commissioned a 
10,000 line mobile telephone network for its exclusive use from 
Siemens, the German electronics group. In doing so it has not 
sought the approval of the Saudi telecommunication authorities 
and annexed frequencies earmarked for the country's public 
portable telephone service. 
  The network, constructed in only three weeks, was first used 
for the December meeting of the Gulf Co-operation Council in 
Riyadh, where each delegate was presented, on arrival, with a 
portable GSM [Global System for Mobile Communications] 
telephone. The GSM standard has been adopted by European 
countries for the next generation of portable phones. 
  Siemens confirmed that the system had been constructed for 
the Royal Palace and that its technicians were extending the 
network to 30,000 lines covering Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam and 
other Saudi Arabian cities. 
  Mr Helmut Muller, the German group's director of 
international sales for mobile networks, said the intention was 
to spread use of the system to groups outside the Royal Family. 
The whole system would be completed by April this year. 
  He rejected suggestions that the network would cost between 
$40 and $50 million but would not be drawn on the price. A 
50,000 line system built for Kuwait cost $30 million, according 
to industry analysts; that suggests that if $40 million was 
close to the real price for the Saudi system then the royal 
family paid heavily for the speed and secrecy with which the 
system was constructed. 
  The royal network was uncovered last week by a journalist 
specialising in telecommunications. Mr Damian Peachey happened 
to switch on his mobile phone while staying in Riyadh and was 
puzzled to see a message on the screen that the network was live 
but he was forbidden to use it. He knew Saudi Arabia had no 
public mobile phone network, but the message suggested there 
must be a cellular radio system operating in Riyadh on the GSM 
standard. 
  Telecommunications, particularly mobile telephone systems, 
is 
a touchy subject in Saudi Arabia where the demand for mobile 
telephones is huge. There is a mobile network of sorts, based 
on obsolete analogue technology and extending to only 20,000 
lines, 4,000 of which are reserved for the exclusive use of the 
Royal Family. The only way to obtain a mobile line is to buy 
one from another user at prices said to reach SR [Saudi riyals] 
130,000 (28,500 pounds). 
  GSM, based on computer technology where messages are 
transmitted as a series of electronic pulses, is the technology 
of choice for the Gulf states. Users can "roam" freely and use 
their phones across national boundaries. Siemens has installed 
GSM systems in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco. 
  There is a general shortage of telephone lines in Saudi 
Arabia. Saudi Telecom is asking for bids for a further 500,000 
lines of which 100,000 will be GSM. The contract is expected to 
be announced in May and a consortium of Ericsson of Sweden and 
NEC of Japan is thought to be in the lead.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In January the number of resettlers 
who came to Germany declined strongly compared with the previous 
month. According to an announcement by the Federal Interior 
Ministry on Tuesday [1 February], 18,827 persons -- including 
18,349 Russian Germans -- moved to the FRG. In December, the 
overall number was 27,043. 
  According to the Ministry, the number of applications for a 
notification of admission continues to decline: In January, 
22,517 ethnic Germans applied for resettlement; in the same 
month last year there were 28,731 applications. 
  Horst Waffenschmidt (Christian Democratic Union), 
parliamentary state secretary in the Interior Ministry, spoke of 
a "calming down": Obviously, the Germans now also see prospects 
for the future in the settlement areas in the Russian 
Federation. The FRG Government will continue to make efforts 
for improving living conditions there. However, the success 
primarily depends on the course of the restructuring process in 
the CIS states.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fabbri Confirms Denial of Spy Plane </F>
Facilities"] 
  [Text] Parma, 31 Jan (ANSA) -- Italian Defence Minister 
Fabio Fabbri confirmed here today that the Rome government had 
refused the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency permission to fly 
two unpiloted espionage drones from Italy over ex-Yugoslavia, 
but said unauthorised speculation seeking to explain the move 
had got it wrong. 
  The American weekly, AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, 
said 
in its edition on the newsstands today that Albania had agreed 
to let the CIA fly the drones from its facilities because of 
Italy's refusal. 
  After the release of a pre-publication copy of the article, 
the author, John Morrocco, told ANSA that a service on the same 
question two months ago quoted Pentagon sources as saying 
various countries had turned down the CIA's request. "After 
further research, we managed to learn that the refusal came from 
Italy," he added, "but we don't know why or what the motivations 
were." 
  Fabbri told reporters that the denial of the facilities 
concerned only a question of air safety. "The remote-controlled 
planes would have had to use Italian airspace used by intense 
aviation traffic," he said, "and the risks would have been grave 
in case of a crash or a technical fault." 
  He also pointed out there was no Italian or international 
legal framework to work within which would create not a few 
problems for the air traffic control authorities. Above all, 
Fabbri was careful to stress that he found it "frankly 
surprising and unacceptable" that there should have been hints 
of a limited spirit of collaboration by the Italian authorities 
when top U.S. officials recognised the "extraordinary 
cooperation" shown for NATO and the United States in all their 
operations in ex-Yugoslavia. 
  The drones the CIA will be using are reportedly two GNAT 
750's developed after the Gulf War had disclosed shortcomings in 
U.S. information gathering capabilities and now brought into 
service ahead of time to improve information collection in 
Bosnia. 
  The GNAT can fly for 24 hours at a stretch to a maximum 
altitude of 8,000 m and with a range of 800 km, transmitting 
digitalised information back to base via land stations or 
another plane. Direct hookups with Washington are also 
possible, AVIATION WEEK said. 
  The programme, which has been estimated at 6 million 
dollars, 
involves setting up a radar station in Albania with a CIA team 
of twelve. February 1 was initially set as the starting date, 
but missions may now start at the end of the month, the weekly 
reported.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fabbri Denies Save the Children Fund </F>
Charges"] 
  [Text] Parma, 31 Jan (ANSA) -- Defence Minister Fabio 
Fabbri today strongly denied charges of Italian military 
inaction in Somalia, linking them to the recent charges of 
involvement with child prostitution in Mozambique to claim that 
the Save the Children Fund was showing "unjustified animosity" 
against Italian peacekeeping forces in the two African 
countries. Fabbri said the latest charges, that Italian troops 
refused to act as escorts for aid workers and stood by as local 
gunmen raided a warehouse, were "absolutely unfounded." 
  Speaking at the inauguration of a Carabinieri investigative 
science centre here, Fabbri explained that with the ongoing 
withdrawal of Italian troops from Somalia, those left at the 
town of Beledweyne were scarcely equipped to do more than defend 
themselves and to intervene if aid convoys were attacked. In 
any case, he revealed, most of the slim contingent was engaged 
in convoy escort duty when the request to provide protection for 
civilian personnel was received. As for their alleged inaction 
when the warehouse was raided, he said they had only been 
informed of the incident the day after it occurred. 
  The situation at Beledweyne was "promptly" reported to the 
UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] command, which decided not to 
move in to protect the personnel but to evacuate all members of 
nongovernmental bodies from the town the following day, he 
pointed out. 
  The protest from the Save the Children Fund was thus 
"without 
foundation" and "does not deserve the disproportionate amount of 
attention it has received," he said. 
  As for the recent charges from the Fund (and from the 
Norwegian humanitarian organisation Redd Barna) that Italian 
troops of the Alpine regiment were using the services of child 
prostitutes in Mozambique, Fabbri said the Italian commander 
General Silvio Mazzaroli had been told by local police that "no 
complaints have been made against our men"; the minister also 
stressed that the alleged incidents that have prompted a probe 
took place in parts of the country where Italian forces are not 
operating. But he added that he had nonetheless requested the 
general to make a report on the matter. 
  Fabbri said he could not find an explanation for "the 
unjustified animosity shown by Save the Children towards our 
soldiers and the insistence with which they are concentrating on 
our Alpine troops, without any solid evidence, a probe that if 
anything concerns all the contingents in Mozambique, and which 
stems from rumours circulating about episodes that are alleged 
to have taken place in the south of the country, where our units 
are not operating."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Premier Chernomyrdin Meets Pope"] </F>
  [Text] Vatican City, January 28 (ANSA) Conditions in 
Russia and ongoing violence in Bosnia-Herzegovina were the major 
issues discussed here by Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and Pope John Paul II in a meeting which included 
the visiting head of government's wife, Yuri Karlov, the Russian 
ambassador to the Holy See, and a delegation of Russian 
officials. 
  On developments in Russia, Chernomyrdin confirmed for the 
pope his government's intention to pursue reforms set in motion 
and, after outlining the Russian position on Bosnia of 
opposition to any international solution to hostilities based on 
the use of force, the prime minister said crisis conditions in 
ex-Yugoslavia must be managed "with peaceful methods." 
  A brief communique issued by the Holy See at the end of the 
meeting, which ran to 50 minutes rather than the 30 minutes 
scheduled, said, "During the audience, the prime minister 
illustrated for the Holy Father the present situation of his 
government on major problems in national and international life." 
  The pope, for his part, "expressed the wish Russia's 
material 
and spiritual progress with profound respect for the religious 
freedom of all believers." 
  At the end of the talk, held in Russian, the pope and the 
prime minister exchanged gifts of papal medallions and rosaries 
and a painting of a Russian landscape. 
  Though the atmosphere prevailing was described as "very 
cordial," Holy See observers noted that Chernomyrdin did not 
invite John Paul to Moscow and recalled that an invitation was 
not forthcoming from Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his 
meeting with the pope on December 20, 1991. 
  The pontiff was, however, warmly invited to the Russian 
capital by the Soviet president of the time, Mikhail Gorbachev, 
who had two private audiences in the Vatican, in December 1989 
and in November of the following year. 
  Chernomyrdin also met here with Vatican Secretary of State 
Msgr Angelo Sodano and his foreign minister, Jean-Louis Tauran, 
for a talk in which the two sides "reviewed some bilateral 
problems between the Holy See and Russia and especially various 
aspects of life in the Catholic community residing there," said 
the communique released by the Vatican press office.

Elections"] 
  [Text] Vienna, 31 Jan (ANSA) -- Italian Prime Minister 
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said here today that he has no plans to 
stand in the general elections scheduled on March 27. 
  "My government's, and my own personal task are over," said 
the former long-serving governor of the Bank of Italy, who was 
brought in from that post to head the cabinet in April of last 
year. 
  Answering questions at a joint press conference with 
Austrian 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Ciampi said his government had been 
set up to run the country until the approval and first 
application of the new electoral system. "Strong or less strong 
forms of renewal are to be found in all countries, and for 
neighbouring countries the question is to follow them and learn 
from them," commented Vranitzky. "I consider Ciampi as one of 
the fundamental promoters of renewal in Italy, whence I wish 
this renewal all possible success."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "GATT: Baratta Hails December </F>
`Turning-Point'"] 
  [Text] Rome, 27 Jan (ANSA) -- Last month's last-gasp GATT 
accord was a "historic turning-point along the path of free 
trade," Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta said today, listing 
the plus points of the agreement for "a Europe that is not, as 
some would have it, an impregnable fortress, but a colander 
leaking the most various interests." 
  Addressing a GATT seminar here, the minister highlighted 
that 
the accord had extended freer trade provisions to sectors like 
agriculture, services, and textiles, where the scope for 
negotiation -- especially with newly industrialised countries -- 
"has always been extremely limited." Under the Final Act of the 
Uruguay Round, he pointed out, most of the fastest-developing 
economies of the world have committed themselves to lowering 
tariffs by 40-45 percent. 
  "In Europe, meanwhile, customs duties will fall by an 
average 
35- 40 percent," he reminded his listeners, "and tariffs on 
goods coming into the European Union from the United States will 
be halved. Japan's tariff system will be slashed by 60 percent, 
South Korea's by 40 percent, while tariffs in Singapore will 
drop 10 percent, in South America by 25-35 percent, and Hong 
Kong will apply zero tariffs on 35 percent of goods." 
  Baratta said these were "important markers that can offer 
certainty to investors...it's just a question of grabbing these 
new opportunities." 
  He said that Italy would have an edge in the export market 
because of the competitive level of the lira, a "modest" 
inflation rate, and last summer's cost-of-labour accord. But it 
had to spend more on research and development and training, 
bridge the tax gap between Italian firms and their European 
competitors, and foster the overseas expansion of Italy's 
dynamic small and medium firms, said. 
  Baratta was cool on proposals to create a beefed-up, unified 
Foreign Trade Institute -- "it would only create confusion" -- 
and said he had instructed the Institute to do more to promote 
Italy's economic image abroad. 
  On the ongoing reform of the export credit agency Sace, he 
said the main issue was "for the government to decide where and 
how much it wants to spend, set ceilings, so that then -- but 
only then -- Sace can intervene, in the fullness of its powers." 
  Finally, Baratta responded to recent protests by Italian 
farmers by saying that a range of Mediterranean products "have 
not been penalised by the GATT accord but by the European Union 
itself," referring to the EU's decision not to include the 
products in the revised Common Agricultural Policy that was a 
reference point for the GATT accord.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Pact for Italy leader Mario Segni by </F>
Gian Antonio Stella on 26 January; place not given: "Segni: I 
May Be Naive, But..."]. 
  [Text] Rome -- So what about this squaring of the circle? 
"I do not know whether bringing the League into a program 
agreement was an attempt to square the circle, as [Italian 
Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli says. I know that 
it was my duty to try. I could have met with [League Secretary] 
Bossi and [League's lower house floor leader] Maroni in secret. 
But I decided to do so out in the open. I preferred to present 
a proposal in black and white. Of course, since the signing 
there has been some opposition. What can I do about it? Now 
people will see. They will form their own assessment." So is 
it all over? "Well, judging from the League's communiques...." 
What, then? "I would say that a major opportunity has been 
thrown away." Mario Segni feels embittered. The other evening 
success seemed to have been achieved. But instead.... "Bossi's 
veto against the Popular Party is ridiculous. Ridiculous. It 
splits the liberal democratic area. It consigns part of it to 
the left...." 
  [Stella] So what was it? A trap to get rid of you? 
  [Segni] What does it matter? 
  [Stella] It does matter: Is it or is it not true that the 
League regards you as the only person that can deprive it of 
votes in a certain area? 
  [Segni] If so, they are miscalculating. Because while I may 
appear naive, they look like crafty fellows. So I will be even 
more competitive than before. I think, rather, that there is 
major unrest within the League. That there are several 
conflicting thrusts. In any case, I would not have been 
criticized if I had not acted out in the open. 
  [Stella] [PPI Deputy] Bodrato says that only the naive do 
not 
realize that Bossi is bringing his adversaries closer in order 
to be better able to attack them.... 
  [Segni] I have not been attacked. It is the chance of 
creating a major accord for Italy that has been attacked. 
  [Stella] Some people are saying, it serves you right for 
trusting someone like Bossi who said: "Segni is a slimy 
snail...." 
  [Segni] Let us leave personal matters aside. I have tried to 
transcend them. What we have attempted remains the only strong 
proposal for building an alternative to the left wing forces. 
The proposal of an accord based for the first time not on 
identities but on a government platform. In the same spirit as 
the referendum. And for 24 hours it did raise the hopes of 
millions of Italians. 
  [Stella] The fact remains that after finishing with you, 
Maroni went off to telephone Berlusconi to tell him to be 
ready.... 
  [Segni] I am not concerned with other people's conduct. What 
concerns me is facts. 
  [Stella] Do you mean that the document that begins "There is 
only one Italy, and it is indivisible" is more of a fact than 
Bossi's veto against that "chicken thief," Martinazzoli? 
  [Segni] I told you: Bossi has shouldered a huge 
responsibility. A large proportion of League voters are 
moderates. To win them over to a liberal democratic platform, 
persuading them to transcend the phase of destructive protest, 
is essential to Italian democracy. And everything that can be 
done in this direction must be done. The document that was 
approved was perfect. Of course words are also deeds. 
  [Stella] Did you not ask Maroni whether or not he had real 
authority? 
  [Segni] He was officially authorized. We explicitly asked 
that. 
  [Stella] Whether he was authorized to sign? 
  [Segni] Whether he was authorized to negotiate. The answer 
was affirmative. So we proceeded. 
  [Stella] Was this due to some misunderstanding on Maroni's 
part, or... 
  [Segni] Maroni seemed to me to be sincere and in good faith. 
But let us return to what we were discussing before. The effort 
that we made was to escape from the old rules. Those whereby 
the parties proceed on their own and form agreements after. 
Whoever undermines such an opportunity is shouldering a huge 
responsibility. 
  [Stella] Do you think that Bossi changed course because of 
the complaints that immediately arose within the League? 
  [Segni] I repeat: I think that there are some huge tensions 
within the League. 
  [Stella] Do you think that he represents only part of the 
League members? 
  [Segni] How should I know? I think that there are huge 
tensions. 
  [Stella] You now seem to be left with no choice: You are 
left with Martinazzoli, Amato, any nonconfessionals that are 
amenable.... 
  [Segni] I am opting for the Pact for Italy, which addresses 
itself to all Italians. Primarily, of course, to the Catholic 
and nonconfessional areas. The PPI and part of the 
nonconfessionals had already granted their support. I hope that 
other nonconfessionals will now join. 
  [Stella] Have you felt prompted to suspect that the purpose 
of all this was to pave the way for Berlusconi? 
  [Segni] Of course, if this option had succeeded, it would 
have been a hindrance to him. But what has happened has not 
helped him. Berlusconi had already made his mind up beforehand. 
  [Stella] But it did clear away the last obstacles, did it 
not? 
  [Segni] Maybe. But it seems to me that he decided to enter 
the arena long ago. 
  [Stella] with regard to the moderate pole, Montanelli wrote 
in CORRIERE DELLA SERA: "Assuming that we succeed, we will be 
creating merely yet another agglomeration of wreckage and 
hucksters." 
  [Segni] Well, there have always been fears. But together 
with the stopgap measures and the resistance, I also perceive 
great thrusts. And I also see many new people that want to 
stand as candidates. There is an impetus in ordinary society 
that will emerge in these elections, even though there will 
still be a long way to go. 
  [Stella] Do you think, as [PPI Deputy] Buttiglione does, 
that 
"however badly things have gone over the League, at least we 
have clarified matters?" 
  [Segni] Certainly. But I will tell you something else. The 
underlying impetus behind the League voters' rapprochement with 
the liberal democratic area is inexorable. If the leadership 
supports it, it could guide it itself. Otherwise it will lose 
control of it. The North cannot remain bound to mere protest. 
It wants to build a new Italy. 
  [Stella] Did you see Berlusconi's message? How did it strike 
you? 
  [Segni] I have already said this several times: I am afraid 
that it is something that will make this area even more 
fragmented than it is now. 
  [Stella] Galli della Loggia says that it seems highly 
artificial. 
  [Segni] I am not interested in such definitions. I know that 
it is not Giscard's party. 
  [Stella] Is it more like Ross Perot's? Or Peron's? 
  [Segni] Let us drop the subject. 
  [Stella] What about these opinion polls, according to which 
one in four Italians longs to be governed by Berlusconi? 
  [Segni] I think that they are of very little value two 
months 
away from the elections. 
  [Stella] Feltri has written that Berlusconi enjoys the 
support of honest, hard-working people who pay their taxes and 
obey traffic signals... 
  [Segni] Well, I think that such people support the Pact for 
Italy much more. 
  [Stella] Augusto Barbera says that even though you have made 
some "turnabouts" you are no turncoat. What does that mean? 
  [Segni] That ever since our first rallies the programs that 
we have put forward have been the same -- the struggle against 
state control, the completion of the institutional reforms.... 
All this, based on Catholic and nonconfessional culture. I 
have merely tried to extend this front and to persuade the 
League to adopt these stances. It would have been a major 
achievement. It had to be attempted. 
  [Stella] What now? 
  [Segni] We will proceed. Whoever support us, supports us.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A Bid To Change Election Rules"] </F>
  [Text] Rome, 25 Jan (ANSA) -- The People's Party 
[PPI--Italian Popular Party] (the former Christian Democrats) 
has submitted two amendments to a decree about to go before 
parliament in a bid to introduce a second round of voting in the 
coming general elections. The election date is set for Sunday, 
March 27, but since that falls on the Jewish Passover Holiday, 
the government on January 19th pushed through a decree that 
would extend the voting into the following day, Monday, March 28. 
  The People's [Popular] Party, taking advantage of the fact 
that the decree must now be debated in the House and Senate, is 
seeking by way of these amendments to re-introduce a second 
round of balloting in the general elections. Thus, the party's 
deputy caucus leader in the Senate, Francesco Mazzola, submitted 
the amendments Tuesday even as the Senate constitutional affairs 
committee got down to a study of the government decree this 
afternoon. The decree goes before the full Senate tomorrow. 
  With regard to elections to the House, the proposed changes 
to the electoral rules as they now stand would call for a runoff 
ballot to be held on the second Sunday after the election, for 
candidates who did not receive 50 percent plus one of the votes 
in those constituencies where 75 percent of the total seats are 
assigned according to the first-past-the-post system. All those 
candidates may take part in the runoff who received at least 10 
percent of the votes cast and whoever obtains the greatest 
number of votes in this second round would be declared the 
winner. 
  With regard to elections to the Senate, the relevant 
amendment calls for a runoff ballot the second Sunday following 
the first ballot for all those candidates where the uninominal 
system holds who did not garner 50 percent plus one of the votes 
cast. 
  Antonio Maccanico, undersecretary at the premier's office 
said that the admissibility of the amendments submitted by the 
People's [Popular] Party within the context of discussion on the 
decree to extend the general election to March 28th must be 
decided upon by the speakers of the two houses. It is not up to 
the government to express an opinion on this matter, Maccanico 
stated. 
  It will be the panel on Senate rules that will decide 
tomorrow morning if the two amendments presented by Mazzola are 
admissable or not. The Senate Constitutional Affairs committee, 
meanwhile, ruled constitutional the decree extending the general 
election date by one day to enable Jews to vote without running 
into a conflict with their religious practices. 
  Coming out strongly against the amendment bid to change the 
election rules were the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the 
Northern League and [Republican leader] Marco Pannella, who 
wondered if Mazzola wanted the initiative to be seen as a last 
blip from the Christian Democrats or the first peep out of the 
new People's [Popular] Party. 
  PDS caucus leader in the senate, Giuseppe Chiarante, said 
that while his party had always been in favor of two rounds of 
balloting, it was too late now to change the rules of the game.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Democratic Alliance leader </F>
Ferdinando Adornato by Maurizio Caprara in Rome; date not given: 
"`We Also Risk Becoming Transformist'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "If he stands up against an agreement with 
the League, [Italian Popular Party leader] Mino Martinazzoli 
will become the champion of antitransformism in this country. 
Yes, we have now reached the point where we can give this title 
to the secretary of what was once the most associationist party, 
the DC [Christian Democratic Party]," AD [Democratic Alliance] 
founder Ferdinando Adornato said. Adornato was, in fact, among 
the first to accuse [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni and the 
League of transformism because of the agreement they reached the 
day before yesterday. 
  Up to a few months ago, Adornato and Segni -- two of the new 
faces brought into the limelight by the Italian crisis and the 
rapid collapse of parties and traditions -- were in tune with 
each other. When they drew up the document uniting democratic 
allies and "pro-reform People's [Popular] Party members" on 15 
July last, both stressed that AD must constitute an alternative 
to the League. But one of the two has now joined the enemy. 
"The usual old transformism," Adornato started by saying, "is 
today favored by objective factors. The first is the confusion 
of party acronyms resulting from the new electoral law. In 
order to win, approximately 35 percent is needed in each 
constituency. Therefore, disparate forces must be joined. On 
the other hand, whereas the majority system forces parties into 
alliances, the proportional quota encourages each party to act 
individually. It is not surprising that each alliance looks 
like a ragbag. However.... 
  [Caprara] However, Mr. Adornato.... 
  [Adornato] However, this agreement between Segni and the 
League makes me see red. I am not only angry; I am also 
worried: Those responsible for a transformist operation are 
precisely the protagonists of two different types of renewal. I 
have never liked [League Secretary] Bossi. Yet it cannot be 
denied that both he and Segni express the need for renewal in 
two different ways. This is why Martinazzoli may become the 
champion of antitransformism, despite being the secretary of a 
party from which theoretically we might expect the opposite." 
  [Caprara] If it has happened, it means something is uniting 
Segni and the League. 
  [Adornato] It is disheartening. I am tempted to move to 
Switzerland. They were blackmailed into reaching an agreement 
by a publisher, a sort of Texan tycoon who does not want to give 
up his TV networks [Berlusconi]. 
  [Caprara] Communist Renewal decided to join the progressive 
coalition in a congress in which 70 percent of the delegates 
were in favor and 30 percent against. Do you regard this also 
as transformism? 
  [Adornato] I am very much aware that the electoral system 
entails the risk of transformism for us too. I observed 
Communist Renewal held a very moderate congress. They were born 
criticizing the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] for their 
government platform, and then realized that they had messed up. 
But they never said they were sorry, for example, for having 
voted "no" in the electoral referendum. 
  [Caprara] However, AD will be going into the elections with 
Communist Renewal. Is this not transformism too? 
  [Adornato] Yes, there are risks involved for us too. 
However, this is precisely why we are striving to ensure that, 
within the electoral coalition, a more homogeneous group of 
forces puts forward a single government platform, a prime 
minister and a single parliamentary group. 
  [Caprara] [Communist Renewal Chairman] Cossutta does not 
seem 
to agree. 
  [Adornato] Communist Renewal and others are free to say on 
which points they agree and on which they do not. Openly. But 
I must add something. We do not have a center-right, but a 
somewhat uncouth right. Segni and Bossi will also reach an 
agreement with [Italian Social Movement, MSI, Secretary] Fini so 
as not to step on each other's toes. Since 1989, however, it is 
not the Cossacks who have been the problem. It is the right. 
Can you imagine the effects that an Italy governed by the right 
would have on Germany or Bosnia? 
  [Caprara] Mr. Adornato, at one point you argued that the 
League and AD were the sole new forces in the country. Does it 
follow from this that you will stand as a candidate in Lombardy, 
and that you will do so in some constituency against a League 
candidate? 
  [Adornato] Me? The logic of the majority system entails that 
if I stand as a candidate I should do so in my own town, Rome, 
where I have lived since I was one year old.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New `National Unity' Party </F>
Announced"] 
  [Text] Rome, 28 Jan (ANSA) -- Yet another party is about to 
enter the increasingly crowded "moderate" area of the Italian 
political spectrum in the run-up to the March 27 elections. 
  A movement calling itself National Unity on Friday [28 
January] announced it will form an official party, grouping a 
wide array of moderate forces with the aim of "leading Italy out 
of the deep crisis in which it has sunk" through a "constituent 
legislature and executive." 
  The new party, its aims and its programs will be unveiled at 
a press conference Thursday, February 3 at the Rome press office 
in Piazza San Silvestro, a communique announced, adding that 
National Unity wants to help create an alliance between 
"political and cultural forces" from different backgrounds to 
give Italy a "modern political system truly based on 
alternatives, more freedom, more democracy and wider justice."

<F P=106> [Interview with Massimo D'Alema, deputy secretary of the </F>
Italian Democratic Party of the Left, by Francesco Verderami; 
place and date not given: "`Our Aim Is To Win Elections; We Will 
Guarantee Governability, Whatever Happens'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Verderami] Could we 
say that the messages issued by [Democratic Party of the Left, 
PDS, Secretary] Occhetto to [Italian Popular Party, PPI, 
Secretary] Martinazzoli over the past few days were rather 
premature, in view of the fact that you will not be reaching any 
agreements with the PPI until after the elections.... 
  [D'Alema] Let us draw a distinction between two separate 
issues. On the one hand, we are convinced of the need for a 
Catholic contribution to the progressive alignment; on the other 
hand, we are closely observing the operation being conducted by 
Martinazzoli, who intends to make a break with the DC [Christian 
Democratic Party]. We consider it important that such a force 
as the PPI is not allowing itself to be drawn into a 
center-right alliance. The left must keep open a debate with 
such a force. We do not put [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi 
and Martinazzoli on the same footing. The PPI has decided to 
remain in opposition to us. But with such a force -- especially 
if a presence of nonconfessional forces including [Pact for 
Italy leader] Segni himself forms around Martinazzoli -- a 
moderate pole will form with which it is possible to conduct a 
dialogue. 
  [Verderami] After the elections.... 
  [D'Alema] First, there are the elections, and we are 
contesting them with the aim of winning, of gaining a 
parliamentary majority -- a difficult objective, of course, but 
not impossible. And we are also contesting the elections in the 
belief that even if we do gain a parliamentary majority, we must 
work to build a government of national reconstruction. This, 
because we believe that today, in a period of transition such as 
this, the country needs not a left-wing government but a 
government that can perform the role of guarantor. 
  [Verderami] With whom can such a government be built? 
  [D'Alema] If, as seems likely, none of the alignments were 
to 
gain a majority, a responsible force such as the PDS would in 
any case help to guarantee the country a government. It is 
unreasonable to believe that if there is no majority there will 
be another election: That would cause the Italian crisis to go 
into a dangerous spin. So if necessary we will work to support 
a government such as Ciampi's. I believe a responsible force 
such as the PDS must now provide such a guarantee. The political 
choice is clear. We are willing to govern, and want to govern, 
and if we gain a majority we will shoulder this task. But in any 
case we want to guarantee the country's governability. 
  [Verderami] With whom? 
  [D'Alema] Certainly not with the League. There is a very 
deep gulf, which permits neither of us, I assume, to consider 
governing together. So the election result must make it 
possible for the country to be governed without [League 
Secretary] Bossi, without Berlusconi, and without [National 
Alliance leader] Fini. Obviously, therefore, after the 
elections there could be a convergence with the PPI to support a 
government that will govern the transition phase. 
  [Verderami] Do you still have Ciampi in mind for prime 
minister, or would you also accept someone such as [Institute 
for Industrial Reconstruction Chairman] Prodi? 
  [D'Alema] I consider it very old-fashioned to be still 
thinking about the government in terms of individuals. Things 
are not like that any more: We have a first-past-the-post 
system that can create unexpected parliamentary majorities. Be 
that as it may, as I have already said in the past, I believe 
Ciampi is one of the people on whom the country can depend at 
this difficult and delicate time. He has been a good prime 
minister, enjoying great international prestige, and displaying 
great democratic correctness. I do not at all regret having 
voted in favor of his Finance Bill. He does not want to be 
anyone's candidate; he wants to remain impartial. And I say, 
thank goodness that there are people in this country who, even 
without party allegiances, have shown themselves capable of 
serving the state very loyally. Perhaps we need more such 
people. 
  [Verderami] Will we also need ministers from Ciampi's 
government? 
  [D'Alema] Some, yes. There are some highly qualified 
figures, such as Spaventa and Cassese, for instance -- 
specialists who have displayed excellent government capabilities. 
  [Verderami] What about Mancino? Now he is only half an 
interior minister, but in the past he won some major battles 
against the Mafia. 
  [D'Alema] In the case of that ministry, I see a need for a 
break with the past. That ministry, more than any other, has 
represented continuity with old-style government. I have 
nothing personal against Mancino: There must be a non-Christian 
Democrat at the Interior Ministry. 
  [Verderami] Is there anyone in the People's [Popular] Party 
you would welcome in a "government of national reconstruction"? 
  [D'Alema] Certainly, which is why it is necessary to 
maintain 
the dialogue with the PPI -- because of what it stands for 
politically, and also because it is a party that includes such 
figures as Prodi, Mattarella, Bindi, Anselmi... 
  [Verderami] Should the next government have constituent 
powers? 
  [D'Alema] It could have a "function of proposal," but the 
institutional reforms must be completed by parliament. For 
instance, the next legislature should revise the electoral law. 
  [Verderami] Would you again propose a two-round system or, 
in 
view of how the political panorama is changing shape, would you 
opt for a plain British-style single-candidate system? 
  [D'Alema] A two-round system is more consistent with the 
situation in our country. But it remains to be seen how the 
political process evolves. For instance, I have proposed that 
after the elections the elective representatives of the 
progressive area form a group. That would be a good thing. And 
if we were to move toward the formation of homogeneous political 
areas, the British system would be unnecessary.

<F P=106> [L.R. Aizpeolea and A. Diez report: "Gonzalez Buries </F>
Bicephalous Model in PSOE"] 
  [Excerpts] Madrid -- PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers 
Party] Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez trusts that he will 
have sufficient support at the 19-20 March Socialist congress to 
have a free hand in drawing up the party leadership list. 
Gonzalez acknowledged that with this congress the bicephalous 
leadership model (the Gonzalez-Guerra tandem) is drawing to a 
close, and a model of shared responsibility will prevail. The 
PSOE leader met with the news media on Wednesday evening [19 
January] in order to offer some clues to a congress at which he 
will play a decisive role and at which he is trying to continue 
to arbitrate. 
  The PSOE secretary general believes that the new leadership, 
in addition to being collective, must be effective, 
representative, and consistent with the party's blueprint for 
renewal. That is, he wishes to have competent people with 
sufficient authority in the PSOE to surmount the current 
internal discord. 
  Gonzalez does not wish to identify the people enjoying his 
confidence, and to whom he will delegate the day-to-day running 
of the PSOE, because he will give priority to his role as prime 
minister. In this connection, he emphasizes his traditional idea 
that the party is an instrument serving society -- not an end in 
itself. He will wait until the holding of the congress before 
revealing the list, out of respect for the wishes which party 
members may express at the congress. 
  Nevertheless, he acknowledged that he is already thinking 
about those people and is conducting numerous contacts among 
regional party secretaries and other individuals with influence 
in the party. 
  What about Alfonso Guerra? Gonzalez confirmed that he has 
proposed Guerra as deputy secretary general in the collective 
leadership plan. This is the only name which he has revealed, 
and he will reveal no more. He has not spoken with him -- they 
both attend PSOE Federal Executive Committee meetings -- and is 
in no hurry to do so, although he does not rule out the 
possibility that they may meet privately before the congress. 
  Nor has he decided yet on the precise model for the 
Executive 
Committee. He is considering one out of three options: a very 
small Executive Committee, a large Executive Committee with a 
permanent secretariat, and a small Executive Committee with an 
intermediate body -- with very strong territorial representation 
-- with respect to the Federal Committee. 
  Whatever the model he decides on, Gonzalez guaranteed the 
existence of a small and effective Executive Committee, as well 
as some kind of territorial representation. 
<H5>  First, Renewal </H5>
  He believes the renewal of the PSOE can take place with 
Guerra with the collective leadership, but, in turn, he made it 
clear he is not prepared to sacrifice his aim of renewal to the 
integration of all the tendencies which he seeks symbolically in 
Guerra's presence. 
  In this connection, Gonzalez repeated the message he made 
public at the Las Ventas rally in October 1992. He sets it as a 
condition for his leadership of the PSOE that his renewal plan 
not be questioned, and in this respect he will accept conditions 
from neither side. Otherwise, he recalled his resignation at the 
1979 congress, where he did not accept the majority theses. 
  Gonzalez asserted that he will not yield to pressure from 
some PSOE regional secretaries to intervene in the precongress 
process, because he wants the party grassroots to express their 
opinions freely, and he is aware that his personal intervention 
could influence the congress. He still reserves for himself the 
role of arbitrator in the party, a task he has performed since 
the Suresnes congress in 1974. 
  He acknowledged that his nonintervention policy and 
conflicts 
over the selection of lists could weaken the party. 
Nevertheless, he did not exaggerate. He believes the internal 
conflicts are due to a power struggle -- at the local level in 
most cases -- but an alternative to the PSOE's national 
blueprint is in no event being proposed within the party. 
  He does not believe the renewalist and Guerraist sectors can 
be defined in terms of their greater or lesser support for the 
Socialist government's activity. In this connection, he 
believes this classification is superficial. To the same 
effect, he stated he is not counting the results produced by the 
votes in the various local associations. 
  The PSOE secretary general also guaranteed the use of 
individual voting at the congress, better to reflect the 
Socialist grassroots' wishes. Although he did not expatiate on 
the matter, he intimated that the traditional procedure of 
voting by delegation is inappropriate for the congress to 
express the grassroots' wishes. 
<H5>  Better Relations With Aznar </H5>
  Gonzalez admitted he has had two meetings with [Italian 
Popular Party Chairman] Aznar at the Moncloa Palace -- the 
second at the end of December. They discussed the NATO summit, 
which was to be held in the next few days, the reform of the 
labor market, and the crisis at the Credit Bank of Spain. 
  The atmosphere of trust was greater at the second meeting 
than at the first. Contacts will continue because Aznar 
represents the votes of 8 million Spanish people and is a real 
government alternative. Gonzalez stated that a regular 
relationship is logical from the democratic viewpoint. 
  The autonomy model -- It is not identical for all 
communities. There are distinctive features to be respected. 
  Convergence and Union's turnabout in autonomy -- 
He asserted that he will accept no territorial constraint when 
negotiating with the Catalan nationalists, but emphasized that 
he is determined to carry forward the impetus for autonomy 
contained in the PSOE program. 
  Terrorism -- He will not change the strategic line 
in the struggle against terrorism. 
  International cooperation, police pursuit, and the 
Ajuria Enea pact -- He regards the proposal of Ramon 
Jauregui and Mario Onaindia as a future possibility which does 
not breach the Basque pact. In any event, an offer of dialogue 
depends on a prior end to violence. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Government Will Stand by Labor Reform Despite Strike </H5>
  Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez asserted he will stand by the 
plan for labor market reform regardless of the extent of the 
general strike called by the trade unions for 27 January. 
  Gonzalez added that there will not be any cabinet reshuffle 
as a result of the trade union mobilizations, and completely 
ruled out considering an early election in the event of a 
Socialist failure in the European elections and the Andalusian 
autonomous community elections in June. 
  The head of government showed himself prepared to resume 
dialogue on the reform of the labor market, provided that 
employers and trade unions previously reach agreement and 
contribute improvements to a plan which he deems essential for 
creating jobs. He acknowledged that there could be some abuses 
with the new forms of labor contract, but he immediately added 
that it is much worse to offer no solutions to the economic 
crisis. 
  In any event, he believes that Spain passed the worst point 
in the economic crisis during the election, although the public 
perception came later. He reaffirmed the expectations he 
expressed during the election campaign, when he stated that by 
May "we will no longer be talking about the crisis as we are 
doing now." He emphasized that, despite its continued fall, the 
unemployment rate is less than in October and November, but he 
saw real emergence from an economic crisis, which he did not 
hesitate to describe as simultaneously brief and intense, as 
conditional upon Germany's pulling power. 
<H5>  Crisis, Priority </H5>
  Gonzalez emphasized that the government's priority is the 
battle against the economic crisis, and other tasks are 
subordinate to this aim. 
  In this connection, he stated that reforms such as the 
reform 
of the labor market fit into the social democratic blueprint, 
because either it provides a permanently reformist response or 
it cannot survive, as has happened with communism. By way of a 
paradox, he emphasized that the trade unions held a strike in 
1985 against the Pensions Law, and now they are calling another 
strike in defense of that law's contents. 
  Gonzalez assessed favorably his relations with the Catalan 
nationalists of CiU [Convergence and Union], and stated that 
their entry into the government will not be raised again, 
although, in his opinion, it would be the most stringent and 
desirable thing. 
  He deemed the formula of a parliamentary pact of support for 
the government sufficient to give the government stability, and 
he made it clear that he will not support another round of 
negotiations with the nationalists unless it is comprehensive 
and serves the interests of all of Spain.

<F P=106> [A. Diez and L.R. Aizpeolea report: "Gonzalez Increases His </F>
Power in Curbing Guerra"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez, secretary general of 
the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], has more freedom of 
action today than he had 48 hours ago. The clear defeat for the 
Guerraists (with 28 percent of the delegates to the federal 
congress) by the renewalists and integrationists (72 percent) at 
the provincial congresses prior to the March congress gives the 
Socialist leader a much freer hand to design an Executive 
Committee to his liking. The victorious renewalists offer 
Gonzalez freedom for his political activity. The losing 
Guerraists were demanding a presence in the power apparatus, but 
their defeat will prevent them from setting conditions. Even 
so, the supporters of the party's "number two" were disguising 
their disappointment with the idea that the PSOE is approaching 
the 33d congress "utterly divided." 
  Renewalists and integrationists have succeeded in winning a 
majority in 14 of the 20 Socialist federations, the Guerraists 
in just six. The big surprises were Andalusia and Murcia, fiefs 
traditionally controlled by supporters of Deputy Secretary 
General Alfonso Guerra, where the renewalists or Felipeists have 
prevailed. The Felipeists' representation is now 72 percent, 
since their nine federations have been joined by those which 
formally call themselves integrationist. This is the case with 
Valencia, the Basque Country, the Canary Islands, Catalonia, and 
the Foreign Federation (party members living abroad). Their 
leaders -- Joan Lerma, Ramon Jauregui, Jeronimo Saavedra, Raimon 
Obiols -- are Felipeists but have received a Guerraist minority 
in their ranks. 
  The provincial congresses of Madrid (52 delegates) and Leon 
(20 delegates) will be held next week. With these and others 
pending in the local associations of La Coruna (three) and Lugo 
(one), the process prior to the the 33d congress will have been 
completed. In this situation, the Felipeists now have 585 
delegates, against the 226 delegates of the Guerraists. 
  Guerra's supporters were disappointed yesterday at having 
achieved a result very distant from their aims, which they put 
at 40 percent of the representatives. Their calculations failed 
them over the past three days because of the mirage of the 
outcome in the votes in the local associations, prior to last 
weekend's provincial congresses. The unexpected loss in 
Andalusia and Murcia -- which account for almost one-third of 
the 887 delegates to the congress -- has made them reduce 
drastically their optimistic forecasts, now that the party 
members have voted secretly. 
  The renewalists have experienced the situation differently. 
The fact that the powerful Andalusian federation is swelling 
their ranks is regarded as the most important success in this 
whole struggle, since it was Guerra's fief. The Guerraists won 
35.3 percent of the Andalusian votes, as against 64.7 percent 
for the renewalists, which means that the latter will send 149 
delegates to the congress, against 81 for the Guerraists. 
<H5>  Unexpected Triumph </H5>
  The renewalists' satisfaction has been rounded off by their 
absolutely unexpected success in Murcia, where the Guerraists 
have become a minority by two votes. The renewalists have also 
triumphed in their traditional fiefs, such as Castilla-La 
Mancha. Even an alternative list put forward in Toledo by 
Fernando Mora, secretary to former Interior Minister Jose Luis 
Corcuera, was swept aside. Yesterday, in light of the results, 
Castilla-La Mancha premier and prominent renewalist Jose Bono 
stated: "Unity, which will undoubtedly prevail at our congress, 
will no longer be achieved through impositions. Because renewal 
has won, integration will be possible." 
  Gonzalez and Guerra followed the weekend's process 
expectantly. Nothing is known about the "number two," but 
something is known about the secretary general. Gonzalez will 
continue with his view that his role is that of arbitrator, and 
it is now up to him to reduce the tension which this process has 
created in his party. Over the past few days, Gonzalez has 
expressed his desire to have sufficient freedom to design an 
Executive Committee of integration with which he can work 
comfortably. With these results he has achieved this. 
  With the argument that the less power Guerra has, the less 
pressured Gonzalez will feel, the renewalist leaders deem it 
good for their strategy that the Guerraists have lost ground 
over the past few days. From this viewpoint, Alfonso Guerra 
will no longer have sufficient strength to impose all the 
henchmen he would like to have in the new Executive Committee, 
so his future depends on what Felipe Gonzalez decides. 
  Over the next few days the Socialist leader will continue to 
hold meetings with all regional party secretaries in order to 
learn their views on the situation following these internal 
elections and on what the next Executive Committee should be 
like. So far he has met with renewalist Jose Bono, Basque 
Socialist Party Secretary General Ramon Jauregui, and Valencian 
premier Joan Lerma. The last two men, both renewalists, will 
lead delegations under the integration label, since prominent 
Guerraists figure in a minority in their ranks. After meeting 
with Gonzalez a few days ago, Lerma also met with the deputy 
secretary general. 
  Gonzalez wishes to settle the debate on the lists 
immediately, and redirect the PSOE's concern to the political 
reports. Last Thursday, he clearly said that he will disclose 
no more names of the Executive Committee's future members until 
the March congress. Gonzalez has remarked that the many 
international delegations which will be attending the congress 
are very interested in learning what the Socialist Party's 
proposals are after 11 years in power. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Miquel Roca Junyent, Convergence and Union </F>
leader, by Anabel Diez and Camilo Valdecantos in Madrid; date 
not given--first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] Madrid -- In broad sections of Spanish society, the 
idea has taken root that the support which CiU [Convergence and 
Union] gives the Socialist government rests solely on quids pro 
quo for Catalonia. 
  [EL PAIS] How would you explain CiU's cooperation with the 
PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to a citizen of Ribadeo 
or Jerez? 
  [Roca] It can be explained very easily: Spain has a 
government thanks to us, and if there were no government, we 
would be much worse off than we are. The mere announcement of 
the agreement between CiU and the PSOE was sufficient for the 
Bank of Spain to lower interest rates the following day. If 
there is any kind of measure to encourage the productive 
economy, job creation, or tax improvements for enterprises, it 
will be thanks to the proposals which we have introduced into 
the overall budgets. Much remains to be done, and we cannot be 
completely satisfied, but it is clear that all this shows quite 
a favorable balance sheet and, if recovery begins in 1994, the 
effort will not have been in vain. 
  [EL PAIS] Are you saying that accusations that everything 
you have done was in return for quids for quo for Catalonia are 
untrue? 
  [Roca] It is terribly irritating and unfair to accuse us of 
acting with only Catalonia in mind; nobody has been able to 
present evidence to substantiate it. The famous transfer of 15 
percent [of personal income tax revenue to the autonomous 
communities] benefits everybody: Everybody approved it, and 
there is Galicia, which now wants more, and the Balearics, which 
said no and then changed their mind. This is a bad way to 
conduct politics, and a dangerous way. 
  [EL PAIS] Have you anybody in particular in mind? 
  [Roca] I have somebody in particular in mind, but I will not 
say who, because that would be rising to the bait they wish to 
set for us. I will have a clear conscience not to have 
responded to that falsehood. It was very rough play, of a kind 
that is hard to forget. 
  [EL PAIS] Are you pointing at the People's Party? 
  [Roca] They will know. I will not say, but you cannot tell 
lies with impunity or try to create a bad image in the rest of 
Spain without any restraint in generalizing about all Catalans, 
which is even more offensive, because it also includes those who 
voted for them. 
  [EL PAIS] Why do you not defend yourselves against the 
accusations of blackmail? 
  [Roca] It is not for us to defend ourselves. That would be 
accepting a strategy that seeks to put us on the defensive. Let 
the PSOE explain why it is demanding our cooperation. A few 
months ago, the People's Party would not speak of pacts, and now 
it is very eager. The United Left [IU] is also attempting this; 
whether it would be sensible to accept its terms is another 
matter. CiU does not reject extending the pact, but let it be 
clear to everybody that reaching agreement means forgoing taking 
advantage of the crisis. Those who reach agreement courageously 
accept the aim of emerging from the crisis -- not benefiting 
from it. 
  [EL PAIS] It is asserted that Jordi Pujol is more chary of 
cooperation with the government than you. 
  [Roca] When Pujol said he was not entering the government, 
he was accused of being unsupportive; when we give support from 
outside the government, we are called Phoenicians [fenicios -- 
allusion unknown]. Is it not our participation in 
decisionmaking that some people find hard to accept? Is it or 
is it not possible that there is a blueprint of a strong and 
legitimate state for the whole of Spain on the basis of a 
Catalan nationalist vision, or can we only have a blueprint for 
Catalonia, because we are a Catalan nationalist party? We have 
already given the answer: Catalan nationalism is also an idea 
about what Spain can and should be like -- certainly more 
pluralist than others see it. 
  [EL PAIS] If the People's Party wins the next election 
without a majority, will you give them your cooperation? 
  [Roca] We will speak when the next legislative term comes. 
In any event, you will appreciate that it must be very awkward 
to demand cooperation of somebody who is so reviled. Look, in 
Europe 12 heads of government of all ideologies meet and reach 
agreement on an economic action and job creation program that 
should be implemented in their respective countries. In Spain 
it is not possible to reach agreement on this same policy with 
the People's Party, which does not accept what its ideological 
families advocate there. 
  [EL PAIS] For how long will you continue to support the 
Socialists? 
  [Roca] Our support will always be given in terms of the 
agreement of aims. If the agreement disappears, we will see. 
It is for the Socialists to administer this stability which we 
have made possible in order to seek new areas of agreement. The 
change in economic policy is not complete; more things are 
needed. Is there or is there not a desire to carry on? It is 
for the Socialists, not ourselves, to reply. We are affected by 
neither the criticisms nor the difficulties: Are they prepared 
to accept the correction which economic recovery will require of 
them? 
  [EL PAIS] The Socialists are accused of winning the election 
with a left-wing vote only to reach agreement with the Catalan 
right. 
  [Roca] The current political situation requires strong and 
sound leaderships. Society wishes to feel it is involved in a 
project which those directing it believe in. This injection of 
conviction could be even more important than the actual success 
of the measures contained in the project. Spain lacks guidance 
and leadership; there are contradictions, apprehensions, and 
hesitations, and an impression of lack of conviction about the 
measures proposed is being conveyed. That is Spain's most 
important deficit. It is up to the government and Felipe 
Gonzalez to rectify the defici. 
  [EL PAIS] So do you believe the IU's reproaches are giving 
the government a complex? 
  [Roca] I do not know whether or not what the IU could say is 
giving it a complex. It should have no reason to have a 
complex. I know of no government in Europe the reaches agreement 
with the IU's counterparts; that is why Julio Anguita accuses 
Gonzalez of doing the same as the other European governments are 
doing. 
  [EL PAIS] How could internal clashes in the PSOE affect 
emersion from the crisis? 
  [Roca] The PSOE is too important for its problems not to 
affect the country's own image, its reputation, and even the 
ability to create confidence in the future. The Socialists must 
understand this. How can they call for efforts while they 
themselves simply cannot reach agreement? If their congress 
does not go well, the consequences will affect everybody. 
  [EL PAIS] How is your cooperation with the central 
government understood in Catalonia? 
  [Roca] What we are doing is understood very well. 
Everything is being done very comprehensively, without any kind 
of specific repercussions for Catalonia. There may be people 
who tell you: "You could take advantage of the situation," but 
we have not done so, and we are glad that this is so, although I 
will not disguise the fact that we feel dissatisfied at not 
having made progress in the autonomy field. There is a false 
impression, as if autonomy were a Catalan or Basque matter. I 
believe that none of what Catalonia demands in the field of 
implementing autonomy is rejected by the others. We have 
undertaken the role of promoting the implementation of autonomy 
in Spain from which everybody later benefits. 
  [EL PAIS] The impression is that you people feel comfortable 
in your role of assisting the government. 
  [Roca] We are very bad at handing out criticism; our sense 
of responsibility gets the better of us. We like to take part 
in decisionmaking, but, moreover, the house's political makeup 
is being forgotten here. We are the only ones who can do what 
we are doing. The People's Party feels it is the alternative, 
the IU believes it must constantly oppose, and the others are 
too small to muster the seats which bring stability. We have 
not fared badly. We have already supported the Union of the 
Democratic Center, and CiU is the only political force in the 
whole of Spain that has increased its number of voters in every 
election since 1979 -- from 500,000 votes in 1979 to 1.16 
million in last October's election.

<F P=106> [Report signed "J.M.": "In 1993, Recession Did Not Curb </F>
Inflation, Which Exceeded Government Target by 0.4 Percent"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- A whole year of economic crisis did 
not serve to curb inflation. Despite last year's recession and 
the fall in demand, the 1993 consumer price index released by 
the National Statistics Institute (INE) yesterday totaled 4.9 
percent -- 0.4 percent above the government's latest target. In 
December alone, prices rose by 0.5 percent -- the largest 
increase recorded in that month in the past five years. "It is 
a bad figure," according to the experts, who forecast a revival 
of inflation in 1994 if Spain finally succeeds in emerging from 
the recession. 
  The considerable increase in prices in December -- 0.5 
percent, as against the 0.3 percent recorded in the same month 
last year -- was clearly due to the poor performance of foods. 
The food price index rose by a spectacular 1.5 percent last 
month, more than in the 12 months of 1992 put together, when it 
rose by 1.2 percent. 
  "The performance of unprocessed foods was surprising, and 
clearly reflects the devaluations suffered by the peseta," 
according to Belen Mateos, head of International Financial 
Analysts' economic trends department. 
  The only moderately good figure among the figures that 
became 
known yesterday is the performance of underlying inflation -- 
that is, excluding unprocessed foods and energy products -- 
which rose by 0.2 percent in December. This figure is the same 
as the one recorded in December 1992, and leaves the annual rate 
at 5 percent. 
<H5>  Reduction of Underlying Inflation </H5>
  "The only interesting thing about inflation in 1993 is that 
underlying inflation is on a par with the general rate," 
according to economist Jose Antonio Herce of the Fedea 
foundation. For instance, in 1992, underlying inflation (6.9 
percent) ended 1.5 percent above the general rate (5.4 percent). 
  "The fall with respect to last year is perhaps not very 
much, 
in the context of the present recession," Mateos reflected with 
respect to underlying inflation, "but it shows some flexibility 
in the services sector, something we did not see very clearly at 
the beginning of the year." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed AH/SN/SH: "President of Chinese Parliament </F>
Concludes Visit to Switzerland -- 100 Tibetans Demonstrate at 
EPFZ"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Zurich, 26 Jan (ATSA) -- Mr. Qiao Shi, president of 
the Chinese National People's Congress [NPC], flew to Austria on 
Wednesday afternoon [26 January] at the end of his three-day 
visit to Switzerland. In the morning he visited the Zurich 
Stock Exchange and met with the cantonal and municipal 
authorities. The planned visit to the Federal Technical 
University (EPFZ) was canceled at the last minute due to a lack 
of time. During the day, 100 Tibetans staged a peaceful protest 
across town against the visit by the third highest-ranking 
Chinese official. 
  Mr. Qiao Shi took off from Zurich-Kloten Airport on board a 
special plane shortly after 1600. In Vienna, he was due to meet 
with Austrian President Thomas Klestil, Chancellor Franz 
Vranitzky, and National Council President Heinz Fischer. 
  In the morning, the Chinese politician and his 55-member 
delegation visited the new Zurich Stock Exchange and admired the 
stained windows by Chagall in Fraumuenster Church. Mr. Qiao Shi 
was then received in Zurich City Hall by the Zurich State 
Council. The members of the Council of States -- Hedi Lang, 
Hans Hofmann, and Ernst Homberger -- and Council President Rico 
Jagmetti attended the official dinner given in his honor. The 
city of Zurich was represented by Mayor Josef Estermann and 
Executive member Thomas Wagner. 
<H5>  "Free Tibet" </H5>
  The planned visit to the EPFZ and the meeting with Rector 
Hans von Gunten were canceled at the last minute due to a lack 
of time. Mr. Qiao Shi had been due to visit the university's 
motor combustion laboratory and to meet with a group of Chinese 
students. 
  Meanwhile, 100 Tibetans demonstrated in Zurich on Wednesday 
morning against the visit by the Chinese politician. At 
approximately 0900, they moved in a procession from the National 
Museum to the EPFZ, where they raised a banner bearing the 
inscription "Free Tibet." The demonstration had been authorized 
and no incidents were reported. According to the police, the 
demonstrators dispersed at around 1130. On Monday, 30 Tibetans 
had staged a protest in Bern. 
<H5>  Human Rights </H5>
  The NPC president arrived in Switzerland on Sunday, on a 
flight from Germany. Invited by National Council President Gret 
Haller and States Council President Rico Jagmatti, he met with 
President of the Confederation Otto Stich and Foreign Department 
Chief Flavio Cotti. The talks concerned human rights in China. 
On Tuesday, Mr. Qiao Shi visited Geneva.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Esko Aho by G. Philip Mok in </F>
The Hague; date not given: "A Pointer From the North -- Finnish 
Premier Pleads for Realism on Russia"; first two paragraphs are 
ELSEVIER introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Finland is well on the way to acquiring European 
Union membership, with negotiations to be completed by 1 March. 
Last week, Esko Tapani Aho, the very young premier of Suomi, the 
"land of a thousand lakes," made a trip to The Hague in order to 
present and secure Finnish interests. [passage omitted] 
  Politically, as a representative of the agrarian Finnish 
Center Party, he is a moderate man. But he looked sharply 
across the low table and quietly gesticulated in reaction to the 
comment that Europe had reacted with euphoria to the 
revolutionary developments in the former Soviet Union and East 
bloc, whereas Finland had suffered a severe setback. "I do not 
deny that this was the direct result of the upheavals," he 
says. "It was indeed dramatic, we lost our markets in the East. 
As a result we had to look elsewhere, and increasingly to the 
European market." 
  [Mok] Therefore you have everything to gain in The Hague, 
where your colleague Lubbers has been tipped repeatedly as a 
possible future Commission president? 
  [Aho] Yes. But things are now going much better in Finland. 
And do not forget that other factors than developments on the 
other side of the eastern border also affected our economy: the 
general, international recession, the lack of investments, 
inflation. We have applied successfully certain measures to 
fight inflation and reduce unemployment. 
  Our aim now is to attract industrial investments. We will 
succeed in this, and our competitive position has improved 
already. And now we are recovering gradually from the blow we 
received following the events in Russia. In 1990, 13 percent of 
our exports were destined stil lfor the Soviet Union; in 1991 
the percentage had fallen to nearly 3 percent (a fall of 10 
percent in just one year), and in 1992 they fell even further. 
But in 1993 our exports to Russia doubled, so we have reason to 
be optimistic. 
  [Mok] Perhaps. But we hear of long queues at the Finnish 
soup kitchens, and a lot of people have fallen by the wayside. 
  [Aho] I am not saying that everything in our welfare state 
is 
perfect; just that we are on the right road. But you must not 
overestimate the speed with which you can succeed in situations 
like this. 
  [Mok] You have adopted a positive position on the 
Partnership 
for Peace initiative, which President Clinton presented so 
forcefully in Europe. But, apart from EU membership, you are 
not, like some East European countries, seeking NATO membership. 
Is Finland, with the vast arsenal of Russian weapons and 
nuclear power stations like Chernobyl just outside St. 
Petersburg and practically in Finland's own backyard, to remain 
politically aligned with Finland and Finland alone? 
  [Aho] We are not so keen on new measures for our security. 
The East European countries which, as members of the Warsaw 
pact, have been deprived of their security guarantees, are 
naturally in a different position than neutral, nonaligned 
Finland. Our interest in the Partnership for Peace is in that 
part of the program which deals with peacekeeping activities, a 
field in which we have experience. 
  [Aho] How do you view the phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy, who 
with his buffoonery as war-horse of the right won the votes of 
nearly a quarter of the Russian voters? The Finnish defense 
budget is to be increased for 1995, is it not? 
  [Mok] The one has nothing to do with the other. We are faced 
simply with the need to spend money in order to modernize our 
military equipment. Buying new aircraft, for example, costs 
money. But as far as the success of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is 
concerned, all I can say is that I find it easy to understand 
the growth of nationalism in Russia. People, also outside the 
former Soviet Union, have overestimated the rapid changes. Many 
observers thought Russia would be totally transformed in two 
years. But it does not work like that: politically, 
economically, and in the field of civil and human rights, 
expectations were too high. Realism is the best guide, also in 
order to view developments in Russia in a long-term perspective.

  [Text] Tirana, January 19 (ATA) -- The 4th session of the 
Joint Albanian-Greek Commission for the scientific and technical 
cooperation was held in Athens from January 13-14, 1994. The 
session analyzed the achievements of the former program of 
scientific and technical cooperation for 1991-1993 and concluded 
this cooperation has been active and beneficial for both sides. 
  After examining the respective proposals, the two 
delegations 
agreed on a new program of cooperation for 1994-1996. The 
program covers different fields such as agriculture, biology, 
construction, transport, science, computers, energy, geology, 
mining, medicine, environmental protection, monuments of 
culture, archaeology, and other fields. The program also 
envisages exchanges of specialists and joint projects of 
research. 
  The Greek side also expressed its readiness to support 
Albanian research projects in the program of the European Union 
and other international initiatives. For the Albanian side the 
program was signed by the leader of the delegation and chairman 
of the Committee of Science and Technique, Maksim Konomi, and 
for the Greek side by the secretary general for research and 
technology of Greece, Nikolaos Chrisodoulakis.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said that he 
has certified, from his contacts with the British Government, 
that London continues to emphasize a solution of the Cyprus 
issue and considers that the confidence-building measures are 
designed to create movement. Mikhailidhis also repeated the 
government's position that the confidence-building measures do 
not constitute a solution nor are they an aspect of a solution 
to the Cyprus issue. That it why, he said, no arrangement 
arising during implementation of the confidence-building 
measures should prejudge or influence the form of solution. 
  Mikhailidhis made the above statement following a meeting 
today in London with British Deputy Foreign Secretary David 
Amory. Mikhailidhis described his meeting with the British 
official as useful and constructive and added that his talks 
covered not only the confidence-building measures, but also the 
substance of the Cyprus issue.

<F P=106> [Article by George Jones and Robert Shrimsley: "Tebbit Gives </F>
Backing to Major at a Price"] 
  [Text] Right-wing Tories led by Lord Tebbit last night 
sought to head off a renewed crisis of confidence in Mr Major's 
leadership by offering him their support in fending off a 
possible leadership challenge later this year. 
  As ministers issued an urgent appeal to the party to keep 
cool heads and calm nerves amid a fresh outbreak of party 
infighting, Lord Tebbit rejected criticism that Mr Major was too 
weak for the job and should stand down. 
  "I am very much in favour of Major staying -- and staying 
through the next election and on beyond that," he said. 
  Interviewed on London Weekend Television's Walden programme, 
Lord Tebbit made clear that Thatcherite support against a 
possible challenge from the Left would be conditional on Mr 
Major adopting a more Eurosceptic policy in the campaign for 
June's European elections. He said Mr Major would have to make 
up his mind on some key issues, even if it meant overruling 
Cabinet colleagues. 
  "My advice would be: Remember the people you fell out with 
over European policy aren't the ones who are looking at your 
seat at the Cabinet table," he said. "So, you have to make your 
mind up, to decide where your friends are, and where the 
policies should lie, and then go for it." 
  He said Mr Major and his colleagues must carry much of the 
blame for their situation. They had made some "foolish errors," 
including allowing spending to rise which had resulted in higher 
taxes. 
  Although Lord Tebbit refused to be drawn into a "Major must 
go" campaign, the price tag for his support is likely to alarm 
moderates, particularly pro-Europeans who feel Mr Major has 
already made too many concessions to the sceptics. 
  Lord Tebbit's intervention came as senior Conservatives 
embarked on another frantic bout of damage limitation after Mr 
Norman Lamont was reported to have described Mr Major as "weak 
and hopeless" and his Back to Basics policies as "nauseating." 
  Although the former Chancellor claimed he was 
"misrepresented," there was undisguised anger among senior 
Tories over his undermining Mr Major's latest efforts to 
reassert authority. 
  But Mr Lamont will signal later this week that he does not 
regard his political career as over and he is determined to 
return to the Cabinet -- though under a new Prime Minister. In 
an interview to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4's "On The Ropes" 
programme on Thursday [3 February], Mr Lamont will confirm -- as 
many Tories suspect -- that he is now emerging as a focus for 
dissent to Mr Major on the backbenches. 
  Mr Lamont, who has not forgiven Mr Major for ditching him as 
Chancellor in May after the loss of the Newbury by-election, 
makes clear his hopes of returning to the Cabinet depend on a 
new Tory leader taking over in Downing Street. 
  "I think it would be very difficult for me to work with John 
Major again," he says. "I don't think that is likely to happen. 
But I do want to be in Government again one day -- and I intend 
to be." 
  Most Conservative MPs regard Mr Lamont's hopes of returning 
to the Cabinet as fantasy, and even those who are sympathetic to 
his plight acknowledge that he made mistakes as Chancellor. One 
senior backbencher said Mr Lamont had "destroyed" himself with 
his latest intervention. 
  But there is concern that he could yet play a key role in 
unseating Mr Major in the autumn if the Tories are humiliated in 
the local and European elections. 
  Disaffected MPs, fearing disaster at the next General 
Election, will search for a "stalking horse" candidate to stand 
against Mr Major in November in the hope of triggering a 
full-scale leadership election. As Mr Lamont's only hope -- 
however remote -- of returning to Government lies in a change of 
leader, he might he persuaded to stand against Mr Major. 
  Although he would not stand any chance of winning, any 
significant show of opposition to Mr Major could result in him 
being forced to stand down. 
  This could pave the way for a contest between Mr Kenneth 
Clarke and Mr Michael Portillo, though some MPs might attempt to 
draft an "elder statesman" such as Mr Douglas Hurd or Mr Michael 
Heseltine.

  [Text] The granting of a U.S. visa to the Sinn Fein 
president, Gerry Adams, has provoked a predictable storm of 
words flying back and forth across the border and across the 
Irish Sea. Mr. Adams was at Dublin Airport this lunchtime for 
his flight to New York, and he spoke to reporters, including our 
Charlie Bird: 
  [Begin recording] [Adams] Well, I welcome the waiver. I 
think it can only help to create a better climate. And it 
shows, I think, a concern by the Clinton administration to be 
better informed on the situation. 
  [Bird] What's your reaction to the Unionist reaction? 
  [Adams] Well I think it's fairly predictable and, you know, 
there's a certain sense to it. What are they saying? That, 
that.... 
  [Bird, interrupting] Well, Mr. Robinson was saying, sort of, 
that the Americans were giving in to terrorism again and that 
you were being put center stage. 
  [Adams] This is the man who invaded Clontibret. 
  [Bird] But what's your reaction to his reaction? 
  [Adams] Well, I think it's nonsense. Why doesn't he come and 
argue his case? I mean, what are they afraid of? Have they no 
argument to put? Are they not willing to take any part in any 
sort of democratic debate? 
  [Bird] Now, would you see this relaxing of your entry into 
America as perhaps a turnabout by the United States on the 
prospects of sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland? 
  [Adams] I don't know. I mean that's a matter absolutely for 
the Clinton administration. All I can say is that it can only 
help create a better climate. It will inform U.S. opinion; it 
will allow those who wish to engage with me. It certainly will 
advance the entire peace process and the United States can play 
an influential role. They can encourage the British. They can, 
without taking sides, help to move the situation on. And if a 
peace envoy comes out of that, we're for that idea in principle. 
  [Bird] The Americans said that they wouldn't let you into 
America unless you renounced violence. Are you renouncing 
violence? 
  [Adams] Well, I don't advocate violence. I'd like... 
  [Bird, interrupting] Are you renouncing it though? 
  [Adams] Excuse me. It isn't an issue as far as I'm 
concerned. 
  [Bird] It is with them. 
  [Adams] Oh well, it isn't with them. I have spoken and had a 
very frank hour-and-a-half discussion with a representative of 
that government. And we exchanged views, and my attitude to 
violence is quite simple and straight forward. I want to end it. 
  [Bird] Mr. Adams, up to a couple of months ago the American 
Administration were saying that you had links to paramilitary 
organizations, and this was the reason why they weren't allowing 
you in. 
  [Adams] Well, you know I've never conceded that. I'm 
president of Sinn Fein. Sinn Fein is not involved in armed 
struggle. Sinn Fein is not the IRA. And the main function of 
Sinn Fein at this time, and for some considerable time, has been 
to see the building of a peace process in this country. And 
that's what I've been engaged in for some long time, and it's a 
matter of great priority for me. 
  [Bird] What are you going to say when you're in the United 
States? Some politicians are hoping that you will make some 
announcement, that you will say something that will perhaps move 
the peace process forward. Will you be saying anything which is 
going to move the peace process forward when you're there? 
  [Adams] Well, I think the very fact that I will be there, 
that I can engage with American opinion, that I will be 
informing American opinion of how the U.S. Administration can 
help to encourage, without taking sides, to encourage the 
British Government to move forward. [sentence as heard] All of 
that can only help the peace process. It all creates a far 
better climate, because the people should never be afraid of 
information. [end recording] 
  And that was Gerry Adams at Dublin Airport.

  [Text] The taoiseach [prime minister], Albert Reynolds, 
was at a function in Dublin this morning. He gave reporters his 
reaction to the Adams visa: 
  [Begin recording] [Reynolds] Well, that was always a 
decision 
that the American authorities had to take. And if it brings the 
achievement of peace closer, in so far as it can contribute to 
that, we will (?welcome) it. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think that it could help 
if he were to go there and to make some declaration on the whole 
initiative? 
  [Reynolds] Well, I think everybody in the country, the vast 
majority of the people in the country, want to hear about a 
declaration of the cessation of violence so that we can get on 
with the process of establishing a just and a lasting peace in 
Ireland, and of course start to reap the benefits of what I 
believe will be a major peace dividend when that happens. 
  [Correspondent] Had the Irish Government got any role in 
this? Did you discuss it with President Clinton [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Reynolds] We have always said that this is a matter for the 
American Administration and we don't interfere in other 
governments' decisions. 
  [Correspondent] Taoiseach, a [Northern Ireland] Unionist 
politician described the decision as breaking faith with the 
declaration [words indistinct]. 
  [Reynolds] This is a decision, this is a decision taken by 
the American Administration. It is a matter for them. And 
they've made their own judgment based on their own information. 
We don't interfere in other people's decisions. As a, as a, 
contrib... [pauses] If it turns out to be a good contribution 
towards achievement of peace and the start of a peace process I 
think everybody would welcome it. Thank you. [end recording] 
  And that was the taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, speaking in 
Dublin this morning.

  [Text] Downing Street sources were today putting the best 
gloss on Gerry Adams' controversial trip to the US, hoping he 
might announce an end to violence. 
  And today it was made clear there was no question of lifting 
the ban on Mr Adams entering mainland Britain. 
  The sources urged the U.S. to put "firm pressure" on Mr 
Adams 
to use the opportunity of the visit to announce a ceasefire. 
  "We very much hope that now Gerry Adams will be in New York 
that his hosts at this meeting will demand in the clearest 
possible terms that the IRA gives up terrorism immediately. 
  "We would hope his hosts will make plain to him that 
continuing evasive and non-committal statements are just not 
enough and that the responsibility for peace rests with him and 
his colleagues," a source said. 
  He said of Mr Adams: "He has given the impression in the 
last 
few days that personally he is against violence. If the 
Provisionals continue their campaign, they continue terrorism 
and bombing, then the hollowness of their words will be exposed." 
  Britain was looking for "deeds not words," it was stressed. 
  "We don't think Sinn Fein should be treated like a 
democratic 
party until it behaves like a democratic party and gives up its 
support for terrorism," the source said.

  [Excerpts] Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams arrived in New 
York today after winning a visa from the U.S. [passage omitted] 
  Mr Adams told a news conference after he arrived: "This 
generation of young Republicans will see peace in Ireland, 
whether it will come in the short term or long term I can't 
say...we have to produce a demilitarised nation." 
  Asked if the IRA suported a cease-fire, Mr Adams said: "I 
don't speak for the IRA, I speak for Sinn Fein." But he added 
"the largest military presence in the north of Ireland is the 
British Army, followed by the allies of the Loyalists and then 
the IRA. I want to see them all disarmed." 
  Asked if the British should leave Northern Ireland, Mr Adams 
said that was not necessary if they became part of the peace 
process. 
  "They have to become the persuaders. Once they become part 
of the peace process then we will be able to build a peaceful 
country." 
  Asked what he thought John Major was thinking, Mr Adams 
joked: "Probably how long he will stay in office." 
  He added that he hoped that Major was willing to take the 
necessary steps to bring peace to Ireland. "If John Major is 
willing to go the extra mile, I am too. Let's bridge the gap," 
he said.

<F P=106> ["Text" of communique released on 26 January by the services </F>
of the prime minister and the president of the French Republic] 
  [Text] For about two years, the international community has 
been trying to restore peace in the former Yugoslavia. It 
created, on the initiative of the European Union, an arbitration 
commission. It invited all involved parties to conclude a peace 
agreement on the occasion of sundry conferences. It implemented 
a humanitarian aid process in order to alleviate the suffering 
of civilian populations. Under a UN mandate, it has sent to the 
region troops which amount to some 30,000 men. 
  France has played a pivotal role in this action, especially 
from a military standpoint, since it is today the country with 
the most soldiers in the region. 
  However, it must now be acknowledged that all these efforts 
failed to achieve the intended results, that the fighting goes 
on, and that none of the parties involved appear ready to agree 
to a peaceful settlement. 
  In such a context, it is up to the international community 
to 
face up to its responsibilities. It must keep working toward a 
peace agreement by calling on all the belligerents to make the 
necessary concessions. This is possible if the international 
community acts in a consistent and closely coordinated manner. 
  Furthermore, all steps likely to ensure a better protection 
of the populations must be implemented. 
  Accordingly, it was decided at the last NATO summit to 
ensure 
that UN forces in Srebrenica are relieved and that Tuzla airport 
is opened for humanitarian aid purposes. It is time for this 
decision to be implemented, including through military means if 
need be. To this end, the United Nations must deploy the 
necessary means without delay. 
  However, sustainable peace can only be achieved if the 
international community, spearheaded by the European Union, acts 
consistently with a view to convincing the warring parties that 
they must come to an agreement. The necessary talks within the 
European Union will take place this week.

<F P=106> [Report signed "D. Gd.": "Leotard Calls Talkative Generals </F>
to Order"] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Leotard wants to avoid the 
pronouncement of any controversial statements by French military 
officials on the situation in former Yugoslavia. This was 
without doubt the purpose of his meeting at the Defense Ministry 
yesterday with the "chief commanders" of the Army -- some 20 
four- to five-star generals, including General Bertrand de La 
Presle, who is to replace General Cot as leader of the 
UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] blue helmets in late March. 
  The Defense Ministry declared yesterday that the aim of this 
exceptional meeting was to explain to the military authorities 
"under which conditions" General Bertrand de La Presle will 
succeed General Cot, the provisions of the latter's mandate, and 
why (Francois Leotard -- LIBERATION editor's note) would like 
Cot to refrain from talking henceforth. 
  Although General Cot received [the Ministry's] support on 
the 
basic points of his criticism of the United Nations, he 
nevertheless was firmly instructed to calm down. He has been 
forbidden from giving interviews to the French press for a week. 
And since the first criticisms by Sarajevo- or Zagreb-based Blue 
Helmets of the United Nations one month ago, all French officers 
with responsibilities for the former Yugoslavia need a formal 
authorization from the Army chief of staff to answer 
journalists' questions. 
  Last week, while strongly criticizing the United Nations, 
Francois Leotard said that "flag officers sometimes talk too 
much and too often." Thus far, none of France's active flag 
officers, the majority of whom concur with General Cot's 
analyses, have publicly commented on the subject. But Francois 
Leotard probably thinks that prevention is better than a cure.

  [Text] France has reacted today to the appointment of a new 
president in Algeria through Catherine Colonna, the Foreign 
Ministry deputy spokesperson. Paris hopes that new Algerian 
President Liamine Zeroual will rapidly embark on a genuine 
political dialogue to enable the country to return to the path 
of democracy and national reconciliation. France also hopes 
that talks with the IMF will soon lead to concrete results so 
that the recovery of the Algerian economy might resume.

  [Text] Republican Party President Gerard Longuet has given 
his support to the candidacy of Jean-Francois Deniau to lead the 
[majority's] single list for the European elections. He 
affirmed that the Cher region's UDF [Union for French Democracy] 
representative is an "exemplary European" embodying "the passion 
for and reason of Europe." 
  Jean-Francois Deniau is "the candidate of the Republican 
Party," confirmed the industry minister on the France-Inter 
radio station. "He perfectly symbolizes Europe as everybody 
envisages it." 
  Asked whom he sees as leader of a separate RPR [Rally for 
the 
Republic] list, Longuet confirmed that "nothing was in his way," 
but that, to lead an election list, "it would be highly 
preferable" to actually take a seat in Strasbourg [European 
Parliament]. "I hope that the majority's voice is heard as 
strongly as possible, and this only will be possible if it has a 
single list presented by a unified group," Longuet declared, 
noting however that the majority has "always been divided in 
Strasbourg." 
  In Longuet's opinion, "presenting two separate lists during 
the European election campaign would only exaggerate differences 
[within the majority] whereas, over the past 10 months, 
everything has proven that the RPR and UDF are perfectly able to 
build Europe together."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "America's Refusal"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. refusal to let itself be involved in 
European -- and especially French -- initiatives aimed at 
putting an end to the war in Bosnia illustrates a paradox which 
characterizes America today. The stronger it gets internally, 
the less willing to commit itself externally it seems to become. 
  In his recent State of the Union Address, Bill Clinton 
listed 
his reasons to be satisfied, all of which were of an internal 
nature. Growth now seems assured, consumer and entrepreneur 
confidence indicators are rising, over 1.5 billion jobs have 
been created in one year, inflation remains under control, the 
budget deficit will be cut as soon as next year, and interest 
rates are at a low ebb. A look at its traditional evils -- 
especially crime -- must not hide the fact that America is in a 
strong position in this age of global economic competition. 
  It is then all the more surprising to witness the timid way 
in which the United States has been exercising its leadership 
abroad. Mr. Clinton can boast no foreign policy achievement. As 
for Bosnia, the U.S. President only -- almost casually -- 
mentioned that the United States could be proud of devising, for 
humanitarian purposes, "the longest air lift in human memory." 
A rather inadequate contribution considering that this is a 
conflict which dents NATO's credibility, mocks the United 
Nations Organization, and has already claimed over 100,000 lives. 
  The U.S. Administration justifies its aloofness with two 
arguments. Exerting pressure to stop the fighting at a time 
when the Muslims have been regaining some ground would be unfair 
to them -- they were sorely provoked, after all -- and would not 
lead to a workable solution. Indeed, while the United States 
has undertaken to contribute to the peacekeeping force should 
the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs come to an agreement, it wants 
such troops to secure peace, not to have to force it upon the 
belligerents, which means that the agreement would have to be 
concluded in good faith, a highly unlikely proposition. To 
demand such an agreement -- which is what the Americans have 
been doing -- is therefore almost akin to a manifesto of 
non-involvement. 
  Routed in Haiti, battered in Somalia, the U.S. 
Administration 
has been equally luckless with a "Russian policy" which it had 
almost exclusively based on a reformist current which has just 
vanished from Boris Yeltsin's new government. Coming after 
those half-failures, its refusal to commit itself in Bosnia puts 
the finishing touches to the paradoxical face of an America 
which is willing to exercise its leadership in the economic 
sphere -- GATT, NAFTA -- but no longer in the political one.

  [Excerpts] Let us now talk about the 28th congress of the 
Communist Party, which has ended in Saint-Ouen with the 
appointment this evening of Robert Hue, the mayor of 
Montigny-les-Cormeilles, as the new national secretary, and thus 
as the successor of Georges Marchais, who had been the leader of 
the Communist Party for 22 years. During the debates, the 
delegates also voted to end democratic centralism and they 
ratified the departure of Charles Fiterman. Antoine Lefevre and 
Jean-Etienne Mach report: 
  [Lefevre] [passage omitted] A former nurse, the 47-year old 
is the mayor of Montigny-les-Cormeilles, a suburb of Paris. He 
has so far dealt with elected members. From now on, he will 
have to lead the entire communist house. 
  [Begin Hue recording] Comrades, you understand that I will 
not make a long speech. I am sure that you also understand that 
I am deeply moved. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  [Lefevre] From now on, Robert Hue will have to compromise 
with the various trends, the multiple clans, which will no doubt 
rise up on his path, those faithful to Georges Marchais, the 
protesters, the hard-line neo-Stalinists, and last but not 
least, the group of members of parliament which could become a 
bastion under the leadership of Alain Bocquet. 
  Outside the party, he will have to tie up the threads of 
dialogue with the Socialist Party again in view of the second 
round of elections -- which is always tricky for the French 
Communist Party -- regional, European, and presidential 
elections, and especially municipal elections, the most 
important for the communists. One might as well say that Robert 
Hue's short and medium-term agenda is full. 
  [Correspondent Claire Chazal] Robert Hue is live with us 
from 
Saint-Ouen. Good evening. 
  [Hue] Good evening, Madame. 
  [Chazal] You are young, you are the national secretary, no 
longer the secretary general. Is a new era opening up for the 
Communist Party? 
  [Hue] Well, this congress is the proof of something new 
indeed. Those observers who could attend this congress for four 
days noticed something new, something dynamic, a major 
discussion, a very strong, fraternal confrontation leading to 
something new. We have to give ourselves the means today, with a 
Communist Party of a new type, as we said in our manifesto, to 
go further in the new dimension we want to give our reform. 
  [Chazal] But Robert Hue, we saw some reformers -- if I may 
call them that -- such as Charles Fiterman, leave the party. 
  [Hue] Well, they did not.... [pauses] Charles Fiterman did 
not leave the party, I.... [pauses] No, Charles Fiterman left 
the Central Committee. I have to say that I, for one, am sorry 
about that. Only last night, I personally asked Charles 
Fiterman to stay. Charles Fiterman has decided to leave the 
Central Committee. I believe that his decision must be 
respected. 
  However, there remain in the political bureau comrades who 
do 
not agree with me and those who make up the majority in the 
political bureau on the basis of this congress. Comrades have 
agreed to belong to the political bureau. I am thinking of my 
friend Philippe Herzog, I am also thinking of Guy Hermier. 
  I was asked a question earlier. I have not answered it yet, 
but I will now. I was asked how my appointment as the national 
secretary was decided. I can tell you -- and it is the first 
time for a long, long time -- that the political bureau of the 
Communist Party, including those comrades who do not share my 
opinions, have suggested that I become the national secretary of 
the party. 
  [Lazal] Robert Hue, Antoine Lefevre asked the following 
question earlier on. With whom will the Communist Party enter 
into alliances now? Will it be with the Socialist Party again, 
for instance? 
  [Hue] Well, we shall first and foremost, as usual, enter 
into 
alliances with wage earners, citizens, people, as close to 
reality as possible. You know, I am a mayor and I am a 
grass-roots man, and reality for me is at the grass-roots level, 
in action, in struggle. Having said that, we want indeed that 
the left, progressive forces, find the way to rally again. 
Having said that, it should be a rally which will no longer be 
the one which has failed. 
  One of the great lessons of this congress is to say: It is 
necessary to build something again, it is necessary to build an 
alternative again in this country. France cannot bear those in 
power, with Mr. Balladur who strikes terrible blows at the wage 
earners, at the young people. It is necessary that the left 
find the way to a rally quickly indeed, but never again do what 
has failed. It must learn from this failure. 
  Besides, you know that I was told at a news conference 
earlier on about our participation in the conference on social 
reform. Well, we shall attend this conference on social reform, 
just as we shall attend all those meetings where we can discuss 
together how we can change things, change society, but only if 
we judge critically and severely what has led our people to 
reject, to reject the policy which was carried out over the past 
few years. 
  [Chazal] Thank you very much, Robert Hue, for agreeing to 
being our guest this evening, live from Saint-Ouen.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 1 (AFP) -- The UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees on Tuesday [1 February] protested to Belgrade against 
the mobilisation of Bosnian Serb refugees in rump Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro), and denounced a new wave of ethnic 
cleansing in western Bosnia. 
  Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said the mobilisation of hundreds of 
Serbian refugees to fight on the warfronts in Bosnia was 
"illegal." 
  She said that often trucks went to the refugee camps at 
night 
to take away people by force. She said the UNHCR had also 
protested to Zagreb about similar actions going on in Croatia 
with Croat refugees from Bosnia. 
  Foa said the UNHCR was also concerned at a new wave of 
killing and terror in the Banja Luka region, where Serbs are 
trying to evict the last Moslems and Croats living in the region 
and confiscating their property. 
  The bodies of three old men were found with their throats 
cut 
on January 22 at Prijedor. Sixteen mosques were destroyed in 
the region in December and there have been 40 emergency 
evacuations every week, she said. 
  Expelled refugees were moreover being made to pay for their 
entry visas into Croatia and were forced to sell their 
belongings, she added.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan 31 (AFP) -- The EC said it was offering 
ECU100 million ($112 million) to help countries hit by the 
international embargo on the former Yugoslavia as a CSCE meeting 
on the issue opened here Monday [31 January]. 
  The two-day meeting, called by the Conference on Security 
and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) ministerial conference in Rome last 
December, is discussing ways of helping countries such as 
Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Hungary, Romania and 
Ukraine which have been hard hit by the UN-imposed sanctions. 
  The European Community offer, in line with its programme of 
economic assistance to East Europe, aims to help set up a 
special transit corridors between these countries for trading. 
  The corridors, which could be set up next summer, would 
include special customs clearance at borders for priority-rated 
heavy goods vehicles. 
  One corridor could link Austria to Greece and Turkey, 
another 
Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and the Ukraine. 
  Each of the countries would offer special border crossing 
facilities to speed up the movement of non-Yugoslav-related 
freight. 
  An international conference might be held to organize the 
details of such a set up. 
  The European Commission has also suggested looking for new 
routes around Yugoslavia to free up present clogged roads. 
  Countries affected by the embargo either border Serbia and 
Montenegro -- under UN sanctions because of their perceived role 
in fomenting the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- or are affected by 
restrictions on traffic on the River Danube.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 26/1/1994 -- Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu signed on Wednesday afternoon [26 
January] the framework document concerning Romania's 
participation in the Partnership for Peace, an initiative 
launched at the NATO summit on January 10-11. The signing 
ceremony which took place in the NATO Council room was attended 
by NATO Assistant Secretary General Amedeo de Franchis and by 
the permanent representatives to the North Atlantic Council of 
the 16 member countries. 
  Due to this political act, which succeeds the acceptance of 
the invitation to the Partnership for Peace expressed by 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu in a statement on January 11, 
Romania has become officially the first country to be engaged in 
the new cooperation pattern with the NATO. 
  At the signing ceremony, Amedeo de Franchis and Teodor 
Melescanu read out brief speeches stressing the political 
significance of the moment and expressing hope that the 
Partnership for Peace would contribute to the consolidation of 
the security and stability in whole Europe. Romanian Foreign 
Minister Melescanu underlined that Romania committed itself with 
all faith and responsibility to the new relation with NATO and 
with the NATO member countries, a relation considered by Romania 
as a preliminary and preparatory stage to Romania's future 
membership to NATO's political and military structures. 
  Previous to the signing ceremony, the Romanian minister of 
foreign affairs had an interview with Amedeo de Franchis and met 
also with the permanent representatives to the North Atlantic 
Council of the 16 NATO member countries. 
  The NATO Assistant Secretary General Amedeo de Franchis 
saluted the "historic moment" when Romania became the first 
"cooperation partner" of the alliance, through the signing the 
framework document of the Partnership for Peace. 
  In a speech on Wednesday in Brussels, in the presence of 
Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, the NATO assistant 
secretary general praised the courage and decision proven by the 
Romanian people in his fight for liberty. Today, Romania 
experiences a difficult process of political and economic reform 
in the interior but, at the same time, it works for the creation 
of new security relations in the exterior, said Amedeo de 
Franchis.

  [Text] Brussels, ROMPRES, 26/1/1994 -- Following are 
excerpts from the statement made by Romania's minister of state, 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Teodor Melescanu at the ceremony of 
signing the framework document of Partnership for Peace: 
  "Mr. Deputy Secretary General, Ladies and Gentlemen, 
  "It is a great pleasure for me to sign today, on behalf of 
my 
country, the framework document opening the way of the 
implementation of the Partnership for Peace to Romania, which 
happens to be the first country to put its signature on the 
document. I hope it is a good omen for the future of our 
relationship. 
  "As you are aware, Romania positively appreciated the 
Partnership for Peace from the very beginning. 
  "If you were to ask why did we like the Partnership for 
Peace, I would say that most and foremost for its fair, equal 
and non-discriminatory approach. 
  "May I also stress that my country considers the Partnership 
for Peace as a preliminary stage to Romania's future membership 
to NATO's political and military structures. We also welcomed 
the Partnership as a new form of cooperation between NATO and 
the democratic states for the East of the alliance meant to 
enhance security and stability in Europe. 
  "In joining the Partnership for Peace, we attach utmost 
importance to the pledge of the alliance that it is committed to 
the preservation of democratic societies of the partners, to 
their freedom from coercion and intimidation, and the 
maintenance of the principles of international law. 
  "I reaffirm here and now, on this solemn occasion, my 
country's commitment to fulfill in good faith the obligations 
incumbent upon it by the UN Charter, and the principles of the 
Universal Declaration on Human Rights. We fully support the 
call of the recent Brussels summit to refrain from the threat or 
use of force against the territorial integrity or political 
independence of any state, to respect existing borders and to 
settle disputes by peaceful means. Romania remains deeply 
committed to the Helsinki Final Act and all subsequent CSCE 
documents, as well as to the obligations undertaken in the field 
of disarmament and arms control. 
  "The political statements, particularly President Clinton's 
statement, that NATO must address the concerns of those nations 
that lie between Russia and West Europe, for the security of 
those nations affects the security of America and the alliance 
as a whole, and the security mechanism agreed upon in Brussels 
represent to my country a major support and encouragement in its 
endeavors to strengthen its stability and security at a moment 
of turmoil in its vicinity, and, on a wider scale, a support for 
the consolidation of the Romanian democratic society. 
  "By acceding today to the Partnership for Peace, Romania is 
undertaking another major step in the implementation of its 
fundamental political option of integration into Euro-Atlantic 
structures -- a goal that enjoys the consensus of major 
political parties and of the public opinion at large. 
  "We are delighted to return to the world where Romania has 
always belonged. Our whole history, culture, traditions, 
political institutions have always been linked -- except for the 
Cold War time -- with the Western world. Integration into this 
world in every possible way is but a natural option for Romania. 
  "We are deeply convinced that belonging to this world is the 
sole guarantee and the strongest incentive for the successful 
accomplishment of our national domestic targets of building a 
democratic society, with a market economy and full respect of 
human rights. 
  "Now that we joined the Partnership for Peace, we plan to 
move ahead, and to move quickly. 
  "Romanian civil and military experts are already working on 
the presentation document. In that respect, we have initiated 
informal consultations with military experts from NATO countries. 
  "May I take the opportunity in order to invite a team of 
NATO 
experts to Bucharest to assist us in drafting the relevant 
documents. 
  "A package of laws on the democratic reform of our armed 
forces (civilian control, transparency, elaboration of the new 
military doctrine) have been submitted for validation to the 
Romanian parliament."

<F P=106> [Article signed MPN/GGD (RAY): "Briquemont Calls For </F>
Coherent Strategy on Bosnia"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 28 Jan (BELGA) -- Lieutenant General 
Francis Briquemont, the former commander of the blue helmets in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, stated on Friday [28 January] that he would 
not have hesitated to request air support from NATO planes in 
the event of a massive attack on his men or on Sarajevo airport. 
  "Since my arrival in Bosnia, we have developed a system of 
air cover (by the NATO fighter-bombers participating in the 
`deny flight' operation). If there had been a massive attack 
against the major UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] bases, I would 
not have hesitated to call for these planes to intervene as they 
would have been acting in legitimate defense," he said at a news 
conference in Evere, three days after his return from Bosnia. 
  "If the lives of dozens of blue helmets had been in danger, 
General Cot (commander of the UN forces in the former 
Yugoslavia) and I would have requested permission from the UN 
headquarters in New York to reply with air power," he added. 
  He confirmed, however, his opposition to massive air strikes 
against the positions of the fighters. 
  General Briquemont also indicated that a withdrawal of the 
blue helmets from Bosnia in the spring -- as is often mentioned 
-- would be a "terrible failure" for the United Nations. 
  "Certain troops would also be very difficult to retrieve. I 
am not sure that the population of Sarajevo would allow the 
UNPROFOR to leave, as it represents their sole guarantee of 
survival," he warned. 
  Finally, the former commander of the blue helmets in Bosnia 
called on the international community to adopt a coherent 
strategy on Bosnia, while stressing that he did not believe that 
any of the parties in the field were in a position to win the 
war.

<F P=106> [Interview with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Werner </F>
Sonne in Washington on 31 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Sonne] You have obviously dissuaded Bill Clinton 
from continuing to threaten further military punitive actions 
[in Bosnia-Herzegovina]. 
  [Kohl] So far it is hard to understand where that would make 
sense, because such actions would immediately affect the 
civilian population and entail the obvious consequences. I do 
not think that there are concrete plans that go beyond very 
general ideas. 
  [Sonne] But no military intervention, chancellor. 
  [Kohl] No military intervention, but still action that is 
based on the strength -- the economic strength -- of the 
countries that are dealing with this issue. 
  [Sonne] The way I interpret is: economic aid -- yes, 
military intervention -- no. 
  [Kohl] I would put it even more bluntly. Economic aid has 
to be absolutely ruled out -- at least as far as I am concerned, 
and from Germany's view -- if borders are changed there through 
the use of force. At the 1991 CSCE summit conference we pledged 
together that we would never again accept that borders be 
changed through the use of force. If we start putting up with 
it again anywhere in Europe, others will not hesitate to take 
that as an example. Therefore, it is essential to nip things in 
the bud.

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 31 (AFP) -- The UN Human Rights 
Commission opened its annual session here Monday [31 January] 
with a warning from its outgoing chairman that the Bosnian war 
will undermine the UN's credibility unless the world community 
intervenes there soon. 
  Mohamed Ennaceur of Tunisia denounced the "passiveness (and) 
impotence" afflicting Bosnia. 
  "If the states which have the capacity and duty to intervene 
do not do so rapidly and effectively, and if the international 
community continues to content itself with dead-letter 
resolutions...the continuing drama of the Bosnian people will 
dangerously weaken the credibility of the UN," he said. 
  Ex-Yugoslavia will be high on the agenda during the 
Commission's six-week annual session, which opened Monday by 
electing Dutch diplomat and lawyer Pieter Van Wulfften Palthe as 
Ennaceur's successor. 
  Atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina will come under the 
spotlight on the basis of a new report by former Polish prime 
minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. 
  The Commission will also discuss the issue of war criminals' 
impunity. 
  Ibrahima Fall, UN undersecretary general for human rights 
said last week he hoped that in the wake of the establishment of 
an international court on ex-Yugoslavia in The Hague, a 
permanent court would be set up to prosecute those who seriously 
violate human rights throughout the world. 
  Heading the list of leaders addressing the session is 
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who is due to appear 
Tuesday to denounce India for what officials have called its 
"occupation" of Kashmir and repression of the Moslem-majority 
population there. 
  PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat is also expected to address 
delegates Tuesday, while Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres 
is due February 10. 
  UN sources here said that a U.S. call for the Commission to 
no longer treat the Israeli occupied territories as a case apart 
was likely to be rejected due to opposition from Arab states. 
  It was unlikely that resolutions aimed at Israel -- 
particularly for its occupation of the Arab territories -- would 
be done away with or presented differently, the sources said. 
  Former Swiss foreign minister Rene Felber is to present a 
report on the occupied territories after meeting 'Arafat in 
Tunis and a visit to Israel this month. 
  Meanwhile Georgia succeeded Monday in adding a clause on 
"ethnic cleansing" in civil wars onto the agenda in the light of 
its own conflict with Abkhaz separatists. 
  The outgoing chairman welcomed multirace elections in South 
Africa scheduled for April, and the successful conclusion in 
December of a world trade liberalisation accord under the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Ennaceur also highlighted the appointment of the first UN 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ecuador's UN ambassador 
Jose Ayala Lasso is due to be officially confirmed in the post 
in the next few days. 
  Fall meanwhile called on all member states to ratify UN 
conventions on human rights. 
  Among countries again expected to undergo criticism over 
their human rights records will be Sudan, Zaire, Iran, Iraq, 
Burma, Haiti, Cuba, Togo, Indonesia -- over East Timor -- and 
China.

  [Text] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has said that 
common historical and cultural heritage linking Pakistan with 
the Central Asian states could pave the way for a useful 
economic cooperation. The prime minister was addressing a 
seminar on Central Asia as part of deliberations of the World 
Economic Forum. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan is 
ideally situated in the region to promote economic cooperation 
in the area. 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] Pakistan is placed at an exciting 
geographical location, and Pakistan had always enjoyed its own 
sense of strategic importance. Previously, it enjoyed its 
importance because of the Cold War and the fact that it was 
bordering the communist state -- the Soviet Union. But with the 
collapse of the Soviet Union a new world emerged, new 
opportunities emerged for us in Pakistan. Because it paved the 
way for us to reestablish our links which had historically 
existed with the Central Asian republics. So, we are seeking to 
build our regional links with the Central Asian republics not 
only in diplomatic terms or commercial terms, but we are also 
seeking to build these links in communication terms. Pakistan 
is an important country because Pakistan is the gateway to 
different regional groupings. One, Pakistan is a gateway to 
South Asia, and in fact, Pakistan is also a member of the South 
Asian association of regional countries. Pakistan is situated 
right in the center, where to one side we have South Asia, to 
another side we have the Persian Gulf, and yet to another side 
we have Central Asia. And that is why we feel that in today's 
world, Pakistan is an important center for potential investors 
because any investment in Pakistan can be rerouted in three 
different directions. So, Pakistan is a gateway to three very 
important trading areas and potential market. [end recording] 
  Economic policies of the government offer better 
opportunities for foreign investors which will in turn help 
promote economic stability in the region. The president of 
Turkey, Mr. Suleyman Demirel; president of Turkmenistan; 
president of Kazakhstan; and president of Uzbekistan also 
addressed the seminar.

  [Text] The commerce minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, says 
the world business community is keen on investing in India. He 
said with a fully developed industrial base and trained manpower 
of 3.8 million scientists and technically qualified people, the 
foreign investment in India is bound to grow. Mr. Mukherjee, 
who is in Davos to attend the World Economic Forum meeting met 
several world economic leaders. Our correspondent Sudarshanam 
understands that Mr. Mukherjee also had four sessions with 
various businessmen and industrialists. In these meetings he 
made it clear that the economic liberalization initiated by the 
government is irreversible. He pointed out that India has a huge 
market to offer to the investors which is unmatched in any part 
of the globe. 
  Speaking on global urbanization in Davos, the Maharashtra 
chief minister, Mr. Sharad Pawar, called for more funds to help 
developing countries counter the adverse implications of 
urbanization in health and education. Mr. Pawar urged the 
developed countries to encourage research and training to 
reconcile city growth with healthy environment. He proposed the 
setting up of satellite towns to decentralize development and 
information, and said entertainment be brought by satellites to 
remote areas so that migration to cities can be checked. Mr. 
Pawar is participating in the World Economic Forum meeting at 
the invitation of the organizers.

  [Excerpts] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 31 (AFP) -- Doubts 
about Russia's commitment to economic reform have darkened an 
already bleak landscape for foreign investors who must deal with 
shifting rules, poor infrastructure and a powerful Russian 
Mafia, business leaders say. 
  Executives from Japan, Europe and the United States agreed 
at 
the World Economic Forum here that Russia has a long way to go 
before it could hope to attract meaningful amounts of capital 
from abroad. [passage omitted] 
  Eberhard von Koerber, executive vice president of ABB Asea 
Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish supplier of heavy electrical 
equipment, said the main problem in Russia is the ever-changing 
rules of the game. 
  He said investors need stable regulatory and tax regimes, a 
clear idea of the division of authority between Moscow and 
Russia's regional governments, and a supportive local banking 
system. 
  Also discouraging is the pervasive influence of organised 
crime in Russia, von Koerber said. He cited a government report 
which said 70-80 percent of private firms and commercial banks 
in major cities have to fork over 10-20 percent of their 
turnover to the Mafia. 
  "If this is not attacked in an aggressive, credible manner 
very quickly, then whatever regulation is established in the 
country will not be seen as sufficient," said von Koerber, whose 
firm has investments in Russia. 
  Figures presented at the Forum showed a clear reticence on 
the part of countries to invest in Russia, even before fears 
spread that Moscow was drifting back towards central planning. 
  Von Koerber cited the example of German companies, which he 
said invested a piddling 13 million Deutsche marks [DM] ($7.6 
million) in Russia in the first half of last year. This was 
less even than the DM21 million they put into a small state like 
Slovenia. 
  Yukinori Ito, senior excutive director of the Export-Import 
Bank of Japan, said accumulated Japanese investment in Russia 
totaled $300 million, a scant 0.1 percent of the worldwide total. 
  Ito said Russia's economic instability and rampant inflation 
were a key discouraging factor, as were changing investment 
policies, poor roads and communications, and a time-consuming 
bureaucracy. 
  "These factors together with the macroeconomic and political 
conditions are making Japanese countries hesitant to invest in 
Russia," he said. 
  George Vassiliou, chairman of the Cyprus-based MEMRB market 
research firm, said investing in Russia would also benefit 
Europe as a whole. 
  He said it has environmental consequences, and expansion of 
the Russian market is necessary if the continent is to emerge 
from its current recession and unemployment crisis. 
  Vassiliou was unimpressed with proud claims by Russian 
officials that they are well on their way towards completing 
their mass privatisation programme. 
  "Privatisation by itself does not mean much," he said. "It 
has significance only if it can be coupled with joint ventures 
and investment."

  [Excerpt] Ankara -- A day after Turkey's central bank 
devalued the Turkish lira against the dollar by 13.6 percent 
following more than a week of turmoil in the financial markets, 
an inevitable wave of price hikes hit the country. 
  The immediate effect of Wednesday's [23 January] decisions, 
aimed at boosting demand for the lira and curbing the monetary 
crisis, was seen in the domestic markets with reports on 
Thursday of a new price hike on aluminium and cement by 8.7 to 9 
percent respectively. The state-run paper industry SEKA fell in 
line and announced a 15.2 percent increase in the price of paper 
products. 
  The sales of copper, its pricing being a major indicator of 
a 
wave of price hikes, was suspended along with the sales of iron 
and steel. 
  Analysts said the prices of all principle goods, with 
petroleum at the top of the list, would now be increased. But 
the Central Bank decisions have mostly affected Turkish 
businessmen with foreign exchange credits. 
  The banking system, said to have a $5.5 billion deficit, is 
suspected of having recorded a loss of TL [Turkish lira] 11 
trillion overnight whereas the losses of firms with foreign 
exchange credits was also described as being around "hundreds of 
trillions of lira." Analysts also expect a 15 percent increase 
in the price of all imported products in the very near future. 
The state monopoly TEKEL is said to be reviewing the prices of 
its import products at the time being. 
  One of the immediate effects of the devaluation, experts 
say, 
will be seen in declining investments. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn/Washington (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
today appealed to U.S. governors for investment in eastern 
Germany. There will be "the most modern locations for industry 
some time in the future" in eastern Germany, Kohl said in a 
speech to the annual conference of the National Governors' 
Association in Washington, the text of which was released in 
Bonn. He said there will be "very interesting opportunities" 
there for the American states. 
  Three years after German unification "the worst is behind" 
eastern Germany, the chancellor stressed. Even now investment 
per head of population is higher than in western Germany. This 
shows that a positive development has started despite the 
difficult catching up process. 
  Kohl, who was the first foreign head of state to speak at 
the 
governors' conference, also stressed that Germany wants to 
further expand the transatlantic partnership with the United 
States. This is as vitally significant for Germany as European 
political union. Efforts for an independent European security 
policy and defense complement and strengthen NATO and will also 
lead to less of a burden being placed on the United States. 
  The chancellor added that the "world's hopes and 
expectations" are directed toward the United States. Securing 
democracy and the market economy in the part of Europe which 
used to be communist is "the great task of the future" for 
America, Germany, and their partners. He also agreed with 
President Bill Clinton that it is a matter of helping Russia and 
the other states undergoing reform along the path to stable 
democracy "by combining our forces." Otherwise those states will 
have to pay too high a price themselves.

<F P=106> [Herbert Kremp editorial: "Who Kissed Yeltsin?"] </F>
  [Text] The United States and West Europe do not have any 
promising Ostpolitik. Like nervous stock exchange operators, 
they follow the Russian exchange rate movements. The 
irreversibility of the reforms used to be a dogma. But now, 
trying to convince oneself no longer works -- the load is 
tipping over. When he meets President Clinton, Kohl will be 
very concerned. 
  Bonn gets the impression that the Western superpower is 
about 
to change its course: The shift toward subsidizing the huge 
arms industry, Kozyrev's move toward a Tsarist-Stalinist policy 
of spheres of influence, the deliberate destabilizing of 
Ukraine, and the return of the nomenclature in Belarus have led 
to heated discussions in the United States. 
  Has Kohl's forecast of the reforms been any better? This is 
rather doubtful. Who kissed Yeltsin? What worries the 
chancellor are the abrupt shifts in U.S. judgment. Under the 
State Department's influence, Clinton opted for a strict "Russia 
first." The Central Eastern Europeans were kept at a distance 
from NATO with the airy Partnership for Peace program. In 
Moscow, Clinton gave a blank check to the policy of spheres of 
influence: He said that Moscow's interference in Georgia could 
have a stabilizing effect, just like the United States' 
interference in Panama and Grenada. 
  That was tempting. When Kozyrev added to this with his 
comment on Russian spheres of interest, Washington warned of a 
new hegemony. Clinton's friend Talbott had to swallow his words. 
First he said that Russia needs "less shock, more therapy." 
After the fall of the reformers, he said: "Reforms first, then 
assistance." 
  Contradictions bring confusion into politics. Will Kohl be 
able to fix anything?

<F P=106> [Report signed "H.V.": "Considerable Increase in </F>
Cross-Border Crime"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government wants to make sure 
that in the European Union (EU) "borders will not be abolished 
for criminals while they continue to exist for criminal 
prosecution authorities." 
  This declaration of intent is one of the most important 
points of an action program worked out by FRG Interior Minister 
Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) for the period of 
the German EU Presidency during the second half of 1994. 
  According to Kanther, the primary goal for this term of 
office is the improvement of the EU's internal security. 
Kanther told WELT AM SONNTAG that, during its presidency, the 
German Government wants to push ahead with the expansion of 
Europol in The Hague and wants to make sure "that this European 
police force is fully operational by October 1994." 
  The minister gave figures: In 1992 alone almost 6.3 million 
crimes were registered in Germany. In 130,000 cases vehicles 
were stolen. The damage: about 1.3 billion German marks. The 
Federal Government will work with particular emphasis toward an 
amendment to the valid EC law so that cars will be equipped with 
state-of-the-art security measures all over Europe. 
  According to Kanther, by 1995 at the latest, it is to be 
examined "whether asylum policy is to be transferred to the 
authority of the European Union." It is to be welcomed that in 
a report the EU Commission has already "come to a cautious vote 
in favor of making asylum policy a Community matter." Europe 
needs a common asylum policy. 
  The minister pointed out that still more than 70 percent of 
all asylum-seekers moving toward Europe come to Germany: "Since 
the pressure of migration on Europe is a common problem of the 
European states, it must be solved together in the future." 
This is true above all in a Europe of open borders, where 
asylum-seekers or foreigners, who have entered a country 
illegally, can move from one EU state to another practically 
without being checked. Freedom of travel must "not be confused 
with freedom of residence or freedom of immigration." 
  Regarding the acceptance of civil-war refugees, the Federal 
Government will press for a "fair burden-sharing" within the 
European Union. Kanther noted that more than 370,000 persons 
have been accepted in Germany. Thus, the FRG is "at the 
forefront internationally." Tomorrow, Kanther will meet Polish 
Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski in Warsaw for talks about 
closer cooperation in combating cross-border crime. Focal 
issues are drug trafficking and the rising number of vehicle 
thefts by the Polish car mafia. Furthermore, additional 
measures are to be agreed on to put an end to the activities of 
those gangs that smuggle asylum-seekers across the border to 
Germany for money. In Warsaw, Kanther will also be received by 
President Lech Walesa and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping; place and </F>
date not given: "Mr. Scharping, What Would You Change As 
Chancellor?"] 
  [Text] [BILD] Mr. Scharping, has your life changed since 
you have become candidate for chancellor of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]? 
  [Scharping] I have hardly any leisure time any more. But I 
like the new challenge. I think that people notice that. 
  [BILD] Many people would like you to shave off your 
beard.... 
  [Scharping] I know as many who want me to keep it. When I 
was in my last year of high school, I once shaved it off, but I 
did not like it. 
  [BILD] Seriously, what would Chancellor Scharping change 
immediately? 
  [Scharping] Germany must concentrate all its efforts on 
employment, the fight against joblessness, the future, and a 
decent life for everybody -- which requires the creation of new 
jobs. 
  We need a national employment pact. The enterprises must 
increase their investments, and the SPD will promote that. 
  Work must be organized in a more intelligent way. 
Corresponding collective agreements have been concluded. I 
hope that this will also be possible in the metal working 
industry. 
  We do not want strikes. The employers should offer the 
employees a settlement. One thing should not be forgotten: 
Paying for work is more useful than financing unemployment. 
  [BILD] What else? 
  [Scharping] First, families with children should receive 250 
German marks [DM] for every child, and the high allowances for 
high-income earners should be abolished. 
  Second, the reconstruction of eastern Germany should be 
financed in a balanced way. The employees are now carrying the 
major burden. This must be organized in a different and fairer 
way. 
  In fact, many officials in Bonn no longer know what it means 
for an employee to make ends meet at DM2,000 net per month. 
However, if somebody can pay DM2,000 in taxes, he can also pay 
DM2,200 without a reduction of his living standard. 
  Third, bureaucracy must be reduced. Thus, building permits 
should no longer be required for houses containing up to six 
apartments. Compulsory notification should be sufficient. 
  Fourth, environmental protection offers enormous 
opportunities -- for exports as well as new jobs. 
  [BILD] Would you increase the price of gasoline? 
  [Scharping] No, I do not see any possibility of further 
increasing the gasoline tax. The burden of taxes and fees is 
already too high for the broader population. 
  We will relieve earned incomes. Something is wrong when 
gross incomes of DM3,000 are reduced to DM2,000 net or less. 
  Messrs. Kohl and Waigel have increased the gasoline tax by 
over 40 pfennig per liter since 1990. Those who take such 
measures must help the commuters. The gentlemen in Bonn have 
forgotten that. 
  [BILD] How will you finance the reforms? 
  [Scharping] We need a fairer equalization of burdens. Thus, 
taxes on income that is not earned through employment should be 
clearly higher than on earned income. 
  In Germany the population possesses financial assets worth 
DM3,500 billion. There are people who receive several thousand 
DM in interest every month. 
  I strongly advocate the principle of achievement. Yet 
depositing one's money in Luxembourg is no great achievement. 
Thus, income that is not earned through employment should be 
burdened to a greater extent in the future. 
  In fact, we will not increase taxes but reorganize them. 
Work should be relieved, and the burden on consumption of raw 
materials, the environment, and energy should be increased. 
  [BILD] How do you want to reduce the high state debt? 
  [Scharping] We have a debt of DM1.9 trillion. In his term 
of office, Theo Waigel has incurred higher debts than all the 
finance ministers before him put together. 
  The main task of an SPD-led government in the first year 
would be: To Reduce state expenditure to the absolute minimum 
and use it in a more purposeful way. I will reject all demands 
for additional expenditures or tax increases. I am as hard as a 
rock in this respect. 
  Moreover, the state must prove that it is able to save 
before 
it can ask the citizens for higher contributions.

<F P=106> [Report signed "rms/DW": "Ruehe's Austerity Program Under </F>
Fire"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe is meeting 
with increasing criticism in the dispute about the Bundeswehr 
austerity plans. Speaking in Berlin at the weekend, Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel called upon Ruehe to present "a feasible 
concept for the Armed Forces." The Bundeswehr is "not designed 
to solve our budget problems," Kinkel said, referring to the 
envisaged 1.25 billion mark [DM] cuts in the Defense Ministry. 
  Another dispute has been triggered between the Federal 
Auditor (BRH) and the Defense Ministry. In spite of severe 
criticism by the BRH, Ruehe wants to discard the big Mi-24 
(called Hind within NATO) combat helicopters taken over from the 
former GDR Army as well as the Mi-8 transport helicopters, which 
also come from the former Soviet Union. The reason: By today's 
standards, the Hind, feared as a "flying fortress" by NATO 
during the Cold War, has "enormous shortcomings." In addition, 
the cannon ammunition (30 millimeters) is not in line with 
Western security standards, and operating costs are high. 
  Unlike the ministry, BRH experts can see "opportunities for 
long-term use" of the former GDR combat helicopter by the 
Bundeswehr. Thus, the Bundeswehr's "rapid task forces" could 
improve their "operative mobility" by using the Hind. The 
Defense Ministry rejects this, presenting its calculation of 
costs: 49 Mi-24 helicopters would create more than DM70 million 
in operating costs per year, almost ten times the amount of the 
current PAH-1 antitank helicopters. The entire fleet of 205 
PAH-1s only costs one-seventh of the amount to be paid for the 
49 Hinds. 
  This means that the Defense Ministry is now concentrating on 
acquiring a new generation of helicopters, which should be 
constructed identically for Army, Air Force, and Navy and should 
also be used by other NATO forces. Besides the "support 
helicopter" (UHU), which can be used for reconnaissance and 
fighting at night and in any weather, and which is to be 
introduced from the year 2002 onwards, the ministry also plans 
to use the NH-90, a transport helicopter suitable for night 
flights. 
  The Navy is thinking of introducing a "derivative of the 
NH-90 family." The Air Force is planning to acquire something 
similar. The defense budget allocates a total of DM3.04 billion 
in research costs and DM13.9 billion of acquisition costs to the 
UHU, which is being developed jointly by German and French 
companies, and to the NH-90. This should buy the Bundeswehr 269 
NH-90s and 75 UHUs.

  [Text] In the middle of January, a complete weapons 
factory produced by the German-Dutch defense company Eurometaal 
was transported by truck from Liebenau in Lower Saxony to 
Turkey. The factory is to be assembled in Kirikkale by German 
and Turkish specialists and is to be used for the production of 
large caliber artillery shells that have a splinter effect. The 
Economics Ministry, which is responsible for authorizing such 
exports, only approved the export of the factory to the 
Netherlands. As recently as 1992, the Bonn-based Federal 
Security Council rejected an application from the Eurometaal 
subsidiary in Liebenau to export 18,000 special shells to 
Turkey. The main reason was that it could not be ruled out that 
the ammunition would be used against Kurdish rebels.

<F P=106> [Report signed "wis": "Economic Development in West Europe </F>
Recovering"] 
  [Text] Munich, 29-30 January -- The very restrained 
economic recovery in West Europe, which began in 1993, will 
"gradually intensify" in 1994, in the view of the Ifo Institute 
for Economic research. The real GDP will probably expand by 
"more than 1 percent" on annual average. 
  For the first time since 1990, the economy will grow again 
in 
all West European countries. Unemployment, however, will 
continue to rise. In 1993, demand and production declined by 
about 0.5 percent in West Europe, according to Ifo. Even though 
the low point of the recession was reached in spring 1993, the 
overall economic production has revived only slightly since 
then. Because of a decline in the utilization of facilities and 
marked efforts by the companies to reduce costs, employment 
continued to decline so that the unemployment rate -- 10.5 
percent -- was about 1.5 percentage point above that of the 
previous year. The increase in prices went slightly down to 3.5 
percent on annual average, following 4 percent the previous year. 
  In 1994, "all large demand aggregates show positive rates of 
change," the Ifo analysis continues. Low interests and stimuli 
by demand from countries outside Europe have a reviving effect. 
In particular, the U.S. economy will probably act as an engine; 
there, a growth of the real GDP of 2.5 to 3 percent is expected. 
Despite declining interests, consumption in West Europe rises 
only very gradually, which is particularly due to the bad 
situation on the labor market. According to the Ifo economists, 
"a stabilization will probably take place" by the end of 1994, 
but the unemployment rate will still be about 1 percentage point 
above that in 1993. For the gross fixed investments, Ifo 
expects an increase by about 1 percent; construction investments 
will not quite reach last year's level. 
  The institutes thinks that exports will go up by 4 percent 
and imports by 3 percent. The rate of price increases is to 
continue to decline slightly, this year to 3 percent. Price 
stabilization would be even stronger, the study says, if many 
countries had not raised indirect taxes, rates, fees, and 
administered prices.

<F P=106> [Report by Christian Brondum and Erik Bjorn Moller: "The </F>
Last Chance for CD"] 
  [Text] In a cabinet reshuffle which gave the Center 
Democrats [CD] two heavyweight ministries in the government, 
Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen and CD leader Mimi Jakobsen 
are trying to make sure that the hard-pressed government party 
will survive the next election. 
  Poul Nyrup Rasmussen sacrificed his social affairs minister, 
Karen Jespersen, whose ministry went to CD rebel Bente Juncker. 
Mimi Jakobsen takes over the Industry Ministry, along with her 
own Ministry of Business Policy and Coordination. 
  Yesterday, neither the prime minister nor Mimi Jakobsen were 
making any secret of the fact that this is the last chance for 
the CD, which, in opinion polls taken since August, has been on 
the verge of disappearing from the Folketing. 
  The rescue operation cost the two CD ministers, Arne 
Melchior 
and Svend Bergstein, their posts, while the previous transport 
minister, Helge Mortensen (Social Democratic Party), now moves 
into Arne Melchior's Communications and Tourism Ministry. The 
Transportion Ministry is being taken over by the man who had 
been the industry minister, Jan Trojborg (Social Democratic 
Party). CD Ecclesiastical Affairs Minister A.O. Andersen will 
additionally take over Svend Bergstein's Technology and Research 
Ministry. This means that the total number of ministers falls 
from 24 to 22. 
  The reshuffle simply has the aim of strengthening the CD -- 
the government's policies remain unchanged, Nyrup Rasmussen 
stated yesterday. 
  But the decision to allow the church affairs minister to 
take 
over Svend Bergstein's controversial Research Ministry has come 
in for criticism from the former Social Democratic Folketing 
group chairman and minister, Ritt Bjerregaard. 
  "Research is incredibly important for the changes which 
Danish society is facing. Merging it with the Ecclesiastical 
Affairs Ministry is a miscalculation regarding the role such a 
ministry ought to play. Here the reshuffle has gone wrong."
