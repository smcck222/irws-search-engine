"The Start of the Election"] 
  [Text] A single aim seems to lie behind Prime Minister 
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's (Social Democratic Party) cabinet 
reshuffle yesterday: to hold onto the post of prime minister 
after the election which, it is expected, will be called in 
September. 
  The means of achieving this is helping the Center Democrats 
over the 2-percent representation threshold, and to this end, 
the small nonsocialist party needs a higher profile and a 
platform from which its policy statements can be delivered. 
  This is the platform Mimi Jakobsen has been given in the 
form 
of the heavyweight Industry and Social Affairs Ministries. 
  The party's fortune, however, has not automatically been 
made 
with new posts and new people. The ministries will have to be 
run aggressively and professionally -- and more, if the new 
ministerial titles are to prove a bonus on election day. 
  The idea is that it will be possible to see the Center 
Democrats' fingerprints on government policy in two of the 
party's key areas, industry and social policy. This is not 
something that will necessarily be straightforward, for there 
will be no more major packages of legislation in these fields in 
what remains of the life of this government. 
  Mimi Jakobsen will now coordinate her own Industry Ministry 
-- not a ministry that attracts much popular interest. On the 
contrary, it is very technical and weighed down by legislation, 
and many EU [European Union] commitments are linked to it. 
  It is true that the CD leader inspires feelings of security 
and confidence among the larger industrial and commercial 
organizations that have also declared their satisfaction with 
the step toward a real superministry for industry. 
  Mimi Jakobsen, however, will be unable to satisfy the desire 
for the removal of the many subsidy arrangments which Danish 
industry views as a distortion of competition. 
  Bente Juncker takes over an onerous Social Affairs Ministry 
where her predecessor had slowly succeeded in becoming well 
liked among the broader general public. The problem for Juncker 
is that her direct and temperamental character could work 
against her. 
  Also, in the coming months there will be no major 
initiatives 
in the field of social policy. 
  Initially, she will have to make do with making public her 
predecessor's action plan for children. 
  On the other hand, the Center Democrats have gotten rid of 
the troublesome government critic that Juncker has up to now 
appeared to be. This in itself could mean greater calm and less 
disturbance in the publicity the party receives. 
  A.O. Andersen -- who is highly respected inside the 
government -- will try to bring life to the unsuccessful 
Research Ministry, whose outgoing minister, Svend Bergstein, has 
been unable to put forward a single draft law in the past year. 
At the same time A.O. Andersen will look after his 
Ecclesiastical Affairs Ministry, and he has therefore been 
called the "minister for faith and science" at Christiansborg. 
  It is the Research Ministry that is to raise A.O.'s profile, 
but this could prove difficult because Bergstein failed to win 
any power from other ministries in the past year. 
  It is Nyrup Rasmussen, together with Mimi Jakobsen and 
Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft, who is behind the reshuffle. 
The reshuffle has been in the works since before Christmas but 
has been slowed down by Helge Mortensen's illness due to heart 
problems. 
  The uncertainty whether Mortensen would be able to come back 
to work has persisted right up to the government's first 
birthday, and as a result the ministers who have been fired have 
succeeded in qualifying for compensation during a period of 
unemployment and a lifelong pension of 57,000 kroner per year. 
  The fact that the cabinet reshuffle happened on 28 January 
was closely linked to Svend Bergstein's criticism of the 
government in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE on Thursday [27 January]. The 
reshuffle was originally to have taken place in a few days' 
time, but Bergstein's demonstration of his lack of political 
awareness accelerated his dismissal. 
  There was to be a demonstration of dynamism, and the 
criticism of Nyrup's hesitation over unpleasant decisions was 
to be rebuffed. 
  And dynamism was a key word for Mimi Jakobsen when the new 
ministers were presented. 
  "We find ourselves in a place where it hurts," she said, 
referring to the sacrifices, for the Social Democratic Party in 
particular, that were necessary to bring about a total reshuffle. 
  Karen Jespersen has been fired -- quite unreasonably, it is 
being said -- so that the Center-Democrats can take over the 
field of social policy. 
  This could lead to problems with the Social Democrats' 
grassroots that are traditionally identified with social policy. 
  While, at the same time, her successor, Bent Juncker, is not 
very well liked among ordinary Social Democrats. 
  Karen Jespersen was applauded into the party Folketing group 
on Friday morning, and she can expect to become a minister again 
in Nyrup's second government after the election. 
  Until then she, probably together with Pia Gjellerup, will 
act as the party's media strategist in the period up to the 
election later in the year. 
  Arne Melchior is the victim, because he is too pale and 
"amoeba-like" a figure. 
  He is angry, and this could give rise to undesirable 
disturbances when he returns to the ranks of ordinary Folketing 
deputies. 
  From the very beginning Svend Bergstein was a bad choice by 
Mimi Jakobsen. He accelerated his own dismissal by his remarks 
to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. 
  The fact that Nyrup Rasmussen has chosen to cut the number 
of 
ministers only by two, and not the number of ministries -- 
something he had indicated in an interview with BORSEN last week 
-- also has to do with regard for the Center Democrats. 
  Mimi Jakobsen continues to take the view that the Research 
Ministry, the Tourism Ministry, and the Industry Ministry are 
future-oriented and must therefore be retained. She has the 
strong backing today of Social Democrat Ritt Bjerregaard. 
  As a result of the reshuffle, Helge Mortensen has been given 
a less demanding post at the less burdensome Tourism Ministry. 
  Jan Trojborg, who is considered to be a rising political 
star, will take a shot at the politically demanding Transport 
Ministry. 
  The reshuffle is the Center Democrats' chance to entice 
voters back into the fold. The problem is simply that the 
party's unfaithful voters have been unwilling to accept being 
part of or supporting a Social Democrat-led government. As many 
reshuffles as you like will not solve that problem.

<F P=106> [Article signed "j-ae": "Center Field Strongly for Rehn"] </F>
  [Text] The expression of support by the Center Party 
leadership for Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn seems to be well 
anchored out among the party rank and file. The party's main 
press organ, [Helsinki] SUOMENMAA, published on Friday [21 
January] the results of its "Hot Line" comment survey on the 
presidential race, and the replies clearly show that Center 
supporters are to a very large extent prepared to vote for Rehn 
in the second round of elections. 
  Of the almost 150 published comments, only a handful 
expressed preference for SDP's [Social Democratic Party] Martti 
Ahtisaari as the best candidate in the decisive round in the 
presidential election. Without naming other preferences, a few 
persons said that they did not intend to vote for Rehn. 
Generally of equal insignificance was the opinion that Center 
Party supporters should not vote at all in the second round. 
  The expressions of support for Rehn were of two quite 
different types. At least half were either unqualified urging on 
her behalf or replies that it has now come down to voting for 
Rehn. The other responses were more or less reserved, with 
arguments that made it clear that Rehn is to be considered as 
something "less bad" than Ahtisaari. The most usual reasoning 
was that the Center Party must not again contribute to the 
country's getting a leftist president, that the election of 
Athtisaari would increase the dominance of the SDP, and that 
Rehn in the final analysis had firmly defended the government of 
Esko Aho. 
  SUOMENMAA's readers otherwise strongly condemned both 
[Center 
Party dissident candidates] Keijo Korhonen and Eeva Kuuskoski 
for having contributed to knocking Paavo Vayrynen out of the 
second round. The much-discussed "media game" was also condemned 
in many replies.

  [Text] The women's organizations want to see Elisabeth Rehn 
become the next president of Finland. At a meeting of 
chairpersons heading member groups belonging to the Central 
Federation of Women's Organizations, support was given to Rehn. 
  The Central Federation is politically independent. It 
represents 400,000 women in 52 different organizations. 
Constituent groups include the women's auxiliaries of the Center 
Party, Conservative Party, the Christian Party, and the Rural 
Party, as well as the Martha Confederation, the Young Women's 
Christian Association, the Kindergarten Teachers' Union, Wives 
of Engineers, Zonta International [Finnish chapter], and, for 
example, the wives of foreign service officers. 
  The leftist women's organizations do not belong to the 
Central Federation. 
  Also supporting Rehn is the Women's Party, [which said in a 
statement]: "As a women, wife, mother, and grandmother, she has 
new groups of people with her and is bringing a human dimension 
to the highest realm of politics."

  [Text] Nicosia, Jan 31 (CNA)--The president of the House of 
Representatives Alexis Galanos disputed Turkey's credentials at 
the Council of Europe because of its illegal occupation of 
Cyprus' northern part and its attitude towards Turkey's own 
people. 
  Speaking before the plenary session of the parliamentary 
assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, Galanos argued 
that Turkey did not comply with the Council's principles, nor 
did it respect democratic processes, human rights or 
international law and order. 
  In an interview with the Cyprus radio, the House president 
warned that this time he did not intend to put Turkey's 
membership of the Council to the vote and asked that double 
standards policies for existing members and new members be 
abolished. 
  He believed it was high time this matter was dealt with 
directly to avert the possibility of allowing the Turkish 
Cypriots to upgrade their representation to the Council and 
consequently pave the way for recognition of their illegal 
administration in Cyprus' Turkish-occupied areas. 
  Turkish troops invaded and occupied 37 per cent of the 
republic's territory. Turkey has refused to comply with U.N. 
resolutions calling for the immediate withdrawal of its troops 
from the island. 
  "We are fighting a big battle in the Council of Europe," 
Galanos said and advocated an enlarged Cypriot representation to 
carry on the battle for Cyprus. 
  Meanwhile, the island is playing host to Lord Finsberg, 
rapporteur for the Cyprus problem at the Political Committee of 
the Council of Europe. 
  Lord Finsberg, here for contacts to prepare a report on 
Cyprus, met Monday [31 January] with President Glavkos 
Kliridhis. Later in the day, he had a meeting with U.N. 
secretary-general's resident representative to Cyprus Gustave 
Feissel. 
  He told Cyprus radio after the meeting that judging from 
what 
he had heard at his meetings here, he believed talks on the 
Cyprus issue would yield good results.

  [Text] Interior Minister Dinos Mikhailidhis gave assurances 
yesterday that Kurds wanted for political crimes would not be 
sent back to Turkey or the occupied areas. 
  DIKO [Democratic Party] deputy Markos Kiprianou raised the 
issue of handing over left-wing Turks and Kurds to Turkey, where 
they face certain imprisonment or death, at yesterday's closed 
House Legal Affairs Committee meeting. 
  Mikhailidhis, who was present yesterday, told the committee: 
"If a Kurd's life is in danger for political reasons then he 
will not be handed over to the Turks." 
  Kiprianou also asked the minister to study other cases 
brought up by the Kurdistan solidarity committee. 
  There are accusations that Turks and Kurds were being sent 
back to instant death after entering the free areas illegally. 
  Kiprianou wanted to discuss with Mikhailidhis the procedures 
followed when Kurds or Turks enter the free-areas illegally. 
  According to the Turkish Cypriot press, two Turks who 
entered 
the free area illegally through Famagusta recently were sent 
back by the government. 
  One of the Turks, according to reports, was a member of the 
Turkish National Liberation Party and a PLO member. 
  Police say it's their policy to send back those who enter 
the 
free areas illegally. 
  The Kurds argue that such action is unacceptable because 
dissidents are treated as deserters and face the death penalty 
on their return. 
  "The major thing is that lives of Kurds are not put in 
danger, if it is known they face death on being returned to 
Turkey or the occupied areas," said Kiprianou afterwards.

in Cyprus to issue a statement saying that it is authorized to 
announce that Athens-Nicosia relations and the personal 
relationship between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou are excellent. 
  In its statement, the Greek Embassy says that the Greek 
prime 
minister never expressed, either directly or indirectly, any 
hint regarding the honesty of their cooperation or any lack of 
mutual briefing. Therefore, it adds, the relevant reports are 
pure fantasy. 
  The statement finally adds that with this opportunity the 
Greek prime minister once again expresses his particular respect 
for Kliridhis.

  [Excerpt] A statement yesterday by U.S. Ambassador Thomas 
Niles in Veryina could be described as insinuation against the 
government. Niles said: "If the Greek Government shows an 
interest in working with us to fight terrorism, certainly, we 
will help." 
  The U.S. ambassador has obviously considered it expedient to 
repeat his reservations over the Greek intention to cooperate. 
In his next sentence, he said: "It will be just enough if the 
Greek Government shows real interest in such cooperation." 
  Regarding his statement following the murder of Mikhail 
Vranopoulos, when he said: "We will catch those guys," Niles 
made the following correction: "I believe murderers such as 
those in `17 November' will be arrested. My remarks came during 
an emotional moment; it was Vranopoulos' funeral. I did not 
mean the United States would do it, but that these people would 
be arrested. Unfortunately, I do not know exactly when they will 
be arrested and I cannot forecast it." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by N. Khasapopoulos] </F>
  [Text] Foreign military attaches, mainly European and 
American, have lately been seen visiting the Defense Ministry as 
a delegation of higher-ranking officers of the National Defense 
General Staff [YEETHA] prepares to pay an official visit to 
Cyprus to cooperate with Cypriot National Guard officers to draw 
up a unified defense strategy. There has not been so much 
movement of foreign officials and diplomats at the Pentagon 
[Greek military headquarters] since March 1987, during the 
Greek-Turkish crisis over the search for oil by the "Piri Reis" 
[Turkish oil exploration ship] in the Aegean. 
  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's proclaimed new 
strategy of unified defense between Greece and Cyprus and 
Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis' meetings in Thessaloniki 
with Miltiadhis Evert, New Democracy and official opposition 
leader, and Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, during which the 
exclusive topic of discussion was the unified defense space 
between Greece and Cyprus, appear to have raised concern among 
NATO military attaches. The NATO military attaches in Athens 
immediately requested a meeting with the ministry's military 
leadership for further clarification. It is indicative that the 
military attaches of Germany, Britain, and the United States 
asked Arsenis if NATO knows about Greece's plans to expand its 
defense space. U.S. Ambassador Thomas Niles also asked Arsenis 
the same question. 
  Arsenis' answer is that Greece, as a guarantor power in 
Cyprus, is obliged to look after its defense and he stated that 
in 1960, Greece did not inform NATO that it was sending the 
900-member ELDIK [Greek Forces in Cyprus] to the island, as part 
of the Zurich Agreement. Turkey did the same with TURDIK 
[Turkish Forces in Cyprus]. Arsenis assured the foreign 
diplomats that the military plans being drawn up for Cyprus' 
defense are clearly defensive, not offensive. He also noted 
that Greece and Cyprus estimate that they face the same threat, 
which comes exclusively from Turkey, and must prepare a common 
defense. 
  There has been no official Turkish response yet, despite 
Turkey's military delegation at NATO seeking in every way to 
learn Greece's plans. But there has been reaction by Britain. 
Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind expressed particular interest 
in the issue during a recent meeting with Defense Minister 
Arsenis in Brussels on the sidelines of the NATO summit. 
British Ambassador in Athens Anthony Miles has requested an 
official meeting with Arsenis and one of the issues that will be 
discussed is the defense of Cyprus, since Britain is also among 
Cyprus' guarantor powers. 
  The first step toward common defense is Lieutenant General 
Nikolaos Vorvolakos' appointment as commander of the National 
Guard. Vorvolakos is being briefed at headquarters. The second 
and perhaps most important step will be the visit this week of a 
delegation of military officers to Nicosia to draw up the new 
defense plan to cover both countries. The third step will be 
National Defense Minister Arsenis' visit to Cyprus during the 
second half of February and the last will be the signing of an 
accord by Prime Minister Papandreou and Cypriot President 
Kliridhis, probably at the beginning of the summer.

  [Text] Ankara--Prime Minister Tansu Ciller held a telephone 
conversation with President Clinton yesterday. President 
Clinton informed her that President al-Asad neither promised 
anything nor opened any door on the issue of the Workers Party 
of Kurdistan [PKK] and Hizballah during their talks in Geneva. 
  Considering President al-Asad's indifference to PKK 
terrorist 
activities, Turkish Foreign Ministry officials have said: "It 
seems President al-Asad wishes to continue to use the PKK as a 
trump card against Turkey." 
  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin is reportedly expected to hold 
bilateral talks with his Syrian counterpart when the foreign 
ministers of Turkey, Iran, and Syria hold a summit on northern 
Iraq in Istanbul early in February. Recalling that the summit 
should have been held in November 1993 but was repeatedly 
postponed because of Syria's objections, Foreign Ministry 
officials have revealed that Damascus has informed Ankara that 
the Syrian foreign minister may visit Istanbul from 4 to 6 
February. But they have also said that "Iran has not yet 
responded."

<F P=106> [Report by Semih D. Idiz] </F>
  [Text] Ankara -- The Popular [People's] Front of Azerbaijan 
is seeking help from Turkey. It claims that there is a 
systematic campaign of repression against it in the Autonomous 
Azeri Republic of Nakhichevan by the government in Baku, the 
capital of Azerbaijan. 
  Asaf Guliyev, the leader of the Popular front in 
Nakhichevan, 
a tiny republic of 300,000 people bordering Turkey and Iran, 
told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN] that hundreds of their members 
and supporters had been arrested, their offices ransacked and 
their papers banned. 
  Guliyev also indicated that the Nakhichevan Parliament still 
could not elect a speaker because its former speaker, Geydar 
Aliyev, who went on to become Azerbaijan's president, had not 
resigned. 
  "This is aggravating an already unstable situation in 
Nakhichevan and leading to further political instability which 
is making it easier for Russia and Iran to interfere in our 
domestic affairs," Guliyev said. 
  He claimed that the reason why the office of parliamentary 
speaker was not being vacated was because President Aliyev was 
worried that the Popular Front, or other opponents of the 
government, may occupy this position. "Any government that has 
signed the Charter of Paris and claims to subscribe to it should 
not be doing such things," Guliyev said referring to the 
government in Baku. 
  He was referring to the charter regarding human rights that 
was adopted by members of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Azerbaijan is a full member of 
the organization and as such has undertaken to comply with the 
standards set in the Charter of Paris of 1989. 
  Contacted by the TDN on the Popular Front claims, 
Azerbaijan's ambassador to Ankara, Mamed Aliyev Novruz Ogly, 
denied that there were any political prisoners either in 
Azerbaijan or in Nakhichevan. 
  "There are over 50 parties in Azerbaijan today and some of 
the most outspoken opponents of President Aliyev's are free to 
express their views," Nevruz Ogly said. 
  "If there are any arrests, these are only associated with 
non- political crimes such as murder and fraud or with attempts 
at dividing the country, as in the case of the arrest of Alikram 
Gumbatov, who tried to set up an Islamic republic in 
Azerbaijan's Lenkoran region near Iran," Novruz Ogly added. 
Indicating that President Aliyev would be arriving in Ankara 
for an official visit on Feb. 8, Guliyev said this would provide 
a good opportunity for the Turkish government to bring these 
issues up with him. 
  Guliyev pointed out that Aliyev would be addressing the 
Turkish Parliament as a guest of honor, only the second foreign 
leader to do so -- the first was Turkish Cypriot President Rauf 
Denktas. He added that they would be lobbying Turkish deputies 
also on the subject of Baku's repressive measures. 
  Aliyev came to power last year after democratically elected 
President Abulfaz Elchibey -- who was also the leader of the 
Popular Front -- was ousted following a military rebellion in 
June 1993. 
  Aliyev, who had moved to become speaker of the Azeri 
Parliament during the rebellion, assumed presidential powers 
when Elchibey fled Baku as rebels seeking his resignation 
threatened to storm the city. 
  Although Turkey continued to support Elchibey, it shifted 
its 
support to Aliyev after he legitimized himself through a 
referendum that confirmed Elchibey's ouster, and elections which 
endorsed his presidency.

<F P=106> [Report by Semih D. Idiz] </F>
  [Text] Ankara -- Serious doubts are being expressed about 
the true nature of the much publicized recent Azeri advances 
against positions occupied by Armenian forces within Azerbaijan. 
There are increasing suggestion [as published] that the latest 
Azeri onslaught was ill-timed and that it may be providing the 
opportunity for Armenian forces to get reinforcements from 
Armenia, to regroup and to prepare for a serious 
counteroffensive in the spring. 
  The TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN] has been told that the Office 
of 
the Chief Staff in Ankara also has serious concerns and 
reservations about the current military operations in western 
and southwestern Azerbaijan. 
  Reports reaching Ankara from Turkish officers training the 
Azeri army apparently indicated from the start that the current 
onslaught ordered by President Geydar Aliyev was not just 
ill-timed but also badly planned and executed. 
  Azerbaijan's Ambassador to Ankara Mamed Aliyev Novruz Ogly, 
who was contacted on the subject by the TDN, strongly denied 
these reports and said that they were simply attempts at 
undermining President Aliyev in his moment of success. "Our 
troops are not the attacking side. They have not embarked on a 
new onslaught. They are merely trying to liberate their lands 
from invading Armenians who have mercilessly pounded our towns 
and cities with artillery shells," Novruz Ogly said. On the 
question of timing, he added that the Armenians were threatening 
their big cities which necessitated immediate operations by the 
Azeri army to protect these cities. The fact that the training 
of Azeri soldiers had not been fully completed before this 
latest onslaught, has led to excessive casualties in return for 
small gains on the battlefield, according to sources informing 
the TDN. These sources also referred to "clear indications" 
that the Russian military is playing a "double game" in the 
Armenian-Azeri dispute by training Azeri troops on the one hand 
and reinforcing Armenian troops in Azerbaijan on the other. 
Sources have said that not just Turkish advisers, but President 
Geydar Aliyev's own military advisor, Gen. Nureddin Sadykhov, 
also exhorted the Azeri president to postpone the military 
operation until better weather conditions prevailed and the 
training of Azeri soldiers was completed. 
  Gen. Sadykhov, who is said to be in close contact with the 
Turkish chief of staff's office, reportedly even threatened to 
resign if his advice was not taken. 
  But President Aliyev's political considerations are said to 
have outweighed military considerations, leading him to order 
the offensive in the middle of winter. 
  "It is true that there have been advances by Azeri forces. 
But most of these have been on open terrain and low ground with 
scant resistance from the Armenians. The Armenians may have 
pulled back from the low ground but they still retain all the 
strategic points on the high ground in and around 
Nagorno-Karabakh," one source said. 
  He confirmed that the town of Goradiz had been liberated 
from 
invading Armenians. But he said this was achieved at a cost of 
2,000 casualties on the Azeri side, which was advancing on the 
low ground, while the casualties among the Armenians, holding 
the high ground before they retreated, were considerably less. 
  As for the recently, much reported "imminent liberation" of 
the strategic Azeri towns of Agdere [Mardakert] and Kelbadzhar, 
this source claimed that "nothing was further from the truth. 
  "Azeri forces have not managed to come closer than 30 
kilometers of Agdere, the gateway to Kelbadzhar, and have only 
entered minor villages on its extreme outskirts" he said. 
Agdere is immediately east of the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh 
while Kelbadzhar is to its west, near the border with Armenia. 
Both towns fell to Armenian forces in their offensive against 
Azerbaijan last year. 
  "Even if a serious advance is secured against Agdere, taking 
Kelbadzhar under present climatic conditions is almost 
impossible, as any military official who is familiar with the 
region and its terrain would confirm," this source said. 
  Questioned on these claims as well, Ambassador Novruz Ogly 
characterized them as "lies." 
  He said Azeri troops were within 300 meters of the town of 
Agdere and were forcing the outskirts of Kelbadzhar. 
  "My concern -- and this concern is shared by Turkish 
advisers 
in the region -- is that the Armenians, who still retain the 
high ground, are allowing the Azeris to advance in the low 
ground. This way it will be easier to ensnare them in a major 
counter offensive, which would be launched under better climatic 
conditions" the source informing the TDN added. This source 
also said there was strong evidence to suggest the Armenians 
were being reinforced and were regrouping for a new offensive in 
the spring, just a few weeks ahead. 
  He referred to 5,000 troops that had been moved in from 
Armenia through the Lachin corridor to the outskirts of 
Khankendi (Stepanakert), the administrative center of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, the predominantly Armenian enclave in 
Azerbaijan. 
  The Lachin corridor, which connects Nagorno-Karabakh with 
Armenia, was opened by the Armenians in 1992 and has been the 
main artery supplying the enclave from Armenia. 
  This source also said that two regiments of Russia Cossacks 
from the 7th army, and two Armenian regiments had been moved in 
to reinforce the Fizulinskiy region of Azerbaijan which is 
adjacent to the Iranian border and which is still held by the 
Armenians. 
  "This, among other things also indicates that the Russians 
are playing a double game here, because while they are helping 
the Armenians in this way, their military advisers are training 
Azeri troops in the Ganja region of Azerbaijan" he added. Other 
sources informing the TDN indicated that the optimal time for 
the Azeri onslaught for liberating its invaded lands would have 
been in March or April. 
  They said the military operation would have stood a better 
overall chance of success then, not just due to better climatic 
conditions that would have better facilitated such an onslaught, 
but also because the training of the Azeri army -- still 
continuing under Turkish, U.S. and British as well as Russian 
advisers -- would have been closer to completion. 
  "It is true that the minor advances achieved by Azeri troops 
has buoyed the public in Baku and led to a new sense of 
confidence. But these advances are also playing into Armenian 
hands because if they decided to use their important strategic 
advantages and regain the low ground, given Russian support and 
their better training, their apparent victory will seem twice as 
important as it really is," one such source argued.

<F P=106> ["Analysis" by Ismet G. Imset: "Zhalah Had To Be Hit"] </F>
  [Text] Ankara -- On Friday [28 January], Turkish warplanes 
conducted what Prime Minister Tansu Ciller referred to as "the 
most important operation of the past 10 years" and bombed a 
major training camp of Kurdish separatists based on the 
Iran-Iraq border. 
  The operation, the deepest ever into Iraqi territory, came 
amid reports that the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] was 
gearing up to launch a wave of attacks targeting Kurdish 
civilians in the Southeast. The Zhalah camp which was bombed 
and almost completely destroyed, was used by the outlawed 
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) not only for training purposes 
but, as Iraqi Patriotic Union of Kurdistan leader Jalal Talabani 
also accepted, to conduct cross border operations into Turkey. 
  According to information the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN] 
obtained during a November 1993 trip to the area, the PKK was 
not only using Zhalah for shelter, but was expanding its 
influence both inside Iran and in the Kurdish-controlled parts 
of Iraq close to the border. 
  Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Chairman Mas'ud Barzani 
readily accepted when interviewed by the TDN in Zakho that it 
was a great mistake from the very beginning to allow the PKK to 
move into the area. Talabani said at about the same time that 
they had no other alternative. 
  The PKK's "transfer" to Zhalah came in 1992 with the October 
Turkish incursion into Iraq tightening the grip on this 
organization and with a makeshift surrender of the separatists 
to the Iraqi Kurds. 
  As Turkish officials boasted back in Ankara that some 4,000 
casualties were recorded in successful land and air attacks, 
Iraqi Kurds were putting the number of PKK losses at about 180 
at the most. 
  Instead of agreeing that the result of the incursion fell 
short of expectation, officials had electoral priorities and 
insisted that they had crushed the terrorists. 
  In reality, and as the TDN then reported at the cost of 
angering officials, hundreds of PKK militants were placed in 
trucks and buses, carried off to Kurdish-controlled Iraqi cities 
and from there, transported to Zhalah. 
  The only practical result of the Turkish operation then was 
to force the PKK more than a hundred kilometers to the south of 
the Turkish border and make it more difficult for the 
separatists to reach back into southern Turkey. 
  But, despite agreements made with the Iraqi Kurds, the PKK 
was allowed to keep most of its weapons. Thus it gradually grew 
and, allowed initially to live exactly on the border region, 
expanded into Iran. 
  Soon, it even took control of the whole area to the extent 
of 
declaring this smugglers' route a "military zone" on behalf of 
its so-called popular liberation army ARGK [People's Liberation 
Army of Kurdistan]. It moved a main guards post out onto the 
main road from Iran to northern Iraq and started to "tax" 
smugglers using this route. Moreover, it increased its 
influence among Iranian and Iraqi Kurds in the region and 
started even to infiltrate the PUK. 
  In November, only about a kilometer away from the Iranian 
border, the PKK flag could be seen across this post -- marking 
the organization's territory. Even Iraqi-Kurdish peshmergas 
feared to enter this zone. 
  "There is an army here," one PKK militant, armed with a 
Kalashnikov, had explained there. Even the sight of PKK 
militants forced the PUK peshmergas, highly professional 
"mountain soldiers," to hide their weapons! 
  About 2,000 militants were initially taken down to Zhalah 
which is over a hundred kilometers south of the Turkish border. 
"But they never once abided by the agreement," Barzani recently 
argued. "We were against the Zhalah plan from the very 
beginning. Now they have Iran right behind them and we have no 
control." 
  The PKK had turned into a big problem for the Iraqi Kurds as 
well since they truly lost control over its activities. It is 
still questionable, however, whether this was a mistake owed to 
coincidences or was somewhat intentional. 
  A slip of the tongue by PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in a 
press 
conference earlier last year somewhat answered this question: 
"Thanks to them," he said with regard to the Iraqi Kurds, "we 
have no problems." 
  Until Talabani warned him in what sounded like Kurdish 
gibberish, Ocalan had already given the news that "a corridor 
has been opened to us and we are free to move." 
  The corridor was opened on the Iranian side of the border 
and 
it was easy enough for a number of militants to cross Iranian 
territory back into Turkey. Ocalan was blunt enough to confess 
this. 
  "Zhalah," said Barzani in November, "was a great mistake 
from the day the agreement (with the PKK) was signed." 
  According to this agreement, the PKK was promising to drop 
its weapons, had agreed to limit its activities to political 
ones and never to conduct attacks on Turkey from northern Iraq. 
"Now," added Talabani, "they are crossing into Turkey from 
Iran." 
  And either over the Iranian border, or crossing back into 
Iraq and then into Turkey, the PKK was attacking. 
  In 1993 alone, a total of 1,249 civilians were killed in 
these attacks and 1,389 civilians were wounded. 
  But why were the Iraqi Kurds, who have insistently stressed 
their friendship with Turkey, unable to do anything about this? 
Asked why they did not completely destroy the PKK but preferred 
instead to accept a surrender, Talabani's response was that 
"there was no other way." 
  What Barzani referred to as a great mistake is for Talabani 
a 
necessity. "We could not destroy them," he said. "When they 
were in Khakurk (the area where the borders of Iran, Turkey and 
Iraq meet) they had Iranian support. Iran gives them arms and 
ammunition. If we had tried to destroy the PKK, it could have 
fought with us for years and years." 
  Another reason Talabani cited was that Kurdish public 
opinion 
would not have accepted an outright attack on the Kurds. 
Finally, he said, the PKK had the power to stop traffic -- 
vital aid material -- from entering northern Iraq as it did 
during a self-styled embargo it imposed on this territory in the 
summer of 1992. 
  It was evident that to reach its goals, the PKK would 
refrain 
from doing nothing and could even go to the extent of blocking 
humanitarian aid for Kurdish civilians. 
  Although Talabani has argued that there were only about 
1,000 
militants remaining in Zhalah, PUK sources close to the camp 
have told the TDN that the camp, in the main, is made out of a 
total of 21 houses which contain some 120 militants at the most 
on the Iraqi side of the border. The remaining militants are 
normally on the move and/or in for training. 
  Ankara officials have frequently argued that the PKK's 
ability to move out of the region and cross into Turkey -- 
either from Iran or Iraq -- is against the terms of Turkey's own 
agreement with the Iraqi Kurds. 
  Despite these comments, there was no clear indication that 
Zhalah would be hit by Turkey at least before next spring. Not 
only is the camp over a hundred kilometers south of the border, 
but it is based in a rugged, mountainous region and partially in 
Iranian territory as well. 
  There was concern that such an attack would have to mean 
striking Iran as well. 
  But, as Ciller said on Friday, the decision was of a 
political nature. One with its consequences carefully 
considered and coming after extensive talks on security with 
officials from Iraq, Iran and the Iraqi Kurdish government. 
  Turkey had given a warning that it would do what was 
necessary if others failed to do it. 
  Both of the Kurdish leaders in Iraq have been aware that the 
Zhalah issue is increasingly harming their relationship with 
Turkey, a lifeline for the Kurds of the region. 
  Once such an obstacle is removed, it is evident that such 
relations will be smoother -- if the Kurds do not make similar 
mistakes in the future. 
  What is not known exactly for the time being is truly how 
many PKK militants were in Zhalah and whether they were all part 
of the "fighting force." A number of female militants, 
approximately 250, are cited among Turkey's targets. But there 
are reports from the Kurdish side that there were some children 
and elderly as well, relatives of militants or banished people. 
Had the PKK used Zhalah in accordance with its protocol with 
the Kurds and had it refrained from military training and 
attacks, it would not have jeopardized these people. But, the 
PKK has little consideration for such "minor factors." Neither 
does it have the right to claim that innocents were killed. No, 
not the PKK which itself is systematically killing women and 
children! 
  As for the fate of the two PKK commanders in Zhalah, 
(Ferhat) 
Osman Ocalan and the notorious radical leader (Mahir) Numan 
Ucar, these are not known yet. They may have escaped or died. 
Little does it matter. 
  The fact is, Zhalah had to be hit and Turkey has taken care 
not to harm any civilians in the area. There may have been some 
casualties from out of the ranks of the smugglers and/or border 
guards. But in dealing with the PKK and/or tolerating it, they 
knew of the risks. 
  Zhalah is terminated or will be soon, depending on the 
results of post-operation reconnaissance flights. This is an 
important advantage for Turkey. What is more important is that 
Ankara has clearly put its cards on the table and make it known 
to other countries in the region that it seriously determined 
this time to crush terrorism at whatever cost. 
  And, it has not gone unnoticed how Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan 
Gures, in his morning meeting with Tansu Ciller, referred to 
Zhalah. "This is even closer to Turkey than the al-Biqa' 
Valley," he said. 
  Zhalah was bombed not because Turkey wanted this, but 
because 
it had turned into a serious risk for this country and those 
neighboring it. Zhalah was hit, because it had to be hit.

  [Text] Ankara, Jan 31 (A.A) -- Central Bank Director 
General Bulent Gultekin announced his resignation on Monday [31 
January], five days after an 13.6 percent devaluation of the 
Turkish lira. 
  Gultekin, at his post since August 26, said the atmosphere 
of 
confidence was fading and there was a need for a medium-term 
economic programme. 
  Bankers had been calling for the governor to resign after 
what they said was monetary mismanagement which led to the 
devaluation last Wednesday night. 
  Gultekin was quoted as saying the Central Bank had used all 
the necessary tools to soothe the markets, thrown into disarray 
by currency chaos. 
  He said the bank `was left unaided' since two international 
credit agencies cut Turkey's rating on January 14. 
  `My resignation will not lead to a new crisis,' Gultekin 
told 
reporters at a news conference. 
  `I hope my resignation will bring the seriousness of 
economic 
problems onto the agenda', he said.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has returned home from 
Davos where he attended the annual meeting of the World Economic 
Forum. He stated that the importance of Turkey's constructive 
role in the region was once more confirmed at the Davos meeting. 
  Demirel was received at Ankara's Esenboga Airport by 
Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand National 
Assembly; General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff; Murat 
Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime minister; State 
Minister Necmettin Cevheri; Interior Minister Nahit Mentese; 
Presidential Secretary Necdet Seckinoz and other officials. 
  In an airport statement, Demirel said that world economic 
and 
political problems were discussed at the Davos meeting, adding 
that within this framework he found the opportunity to explain 
Turkey's approach to international problems. Demirel noted that 
the Economic Cooperation Organization, the developments in the 
Central Asian republics, and Turkey's relations with the 
European Union were discussed in detail at the Davos meeting. 
He stated that Turkey is a very important country in its region 
and continued: 
  [Begin Demirel recording] Turkey, actually, is a singularly 
significant country as a result of its relations with Central 
Asia, Russia, Ukraine, the Caucasus, the Balkans, and the 
Arabian peninsula following the positive results of the Middle 
East peace conference. Turkey, in other words, is a very 
significant bridge in a region extending from west to east, that 
is from Europe to China. I found the opportunity to explain this 
view. I hope that in the near future Turkey will become a 
significant energy terminal by transporting and selling the gas 
and oil reserves of Central Asia, namely Turkmenistan, 
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, to the world. This is one of the 
most significant issues on the world's agenda. [end recording] 
  Demirel stated that there is interest in Turkey's 
constructive role in the region as well as in the bilateral and 
multilateral relations it is cultivating. 
  Demirel said that he will find the opportunity to discuss 
the 
Middle East peace process and possibilities for regional 
cooperation with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak who will be 
arriving on an official visit in Turkey tomorrow. Noting that 
the Bulgarian president will also be visiting Turkey in the 
coming months, Demirel said that steps to be taken to realize 
the East-West highway that will transit through Bulgaria, 
Macedonia, and Albania will be discussed during this visit.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin </F>
by Gildo Campesato in Rome; date not given: "`Italy Should 
Invest Immediately in Russia'"] 
  [Text] "Our real deficit is time. I have come to Rome to 
sound the alarm bell and shake things up a little." During the 
first two days of his visit to Italy, Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin spent almost three hours in a meeting with 
ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] President Luigi Meanti 
and Managing Director Franco Bernabe. First, a meeting with the 
top management, then a more personal lunch to talk over a shrimp 
cocktail and a fruit cake about specific business plans such as 
the upgrading of petrochemical plants and the 3.5-trillion-lire 
gas pipeline project signed with ENI last December. "It is the 
contract of the century," was the convinced comment of 
Chernomyrdin, who knows a thing or two about gas since he was 
director of the sector in Russia for years. Moreover, ENI is 
like home for him because his son studied at the AGIP [Italian 
National Oil Company] management school in San Donato Milanese. 
  [Campesato] Your visit to ENI is not just a courtesy call 
then? 
  [Chernomyrdin] No, even if I know this company very well. 
We talked about the company's projects in Russia and in 
particular about its participation in the development of the 
offshore oil field in the Barents sea. And I also came to wake 
it up a bit. We can work together with ENI in the 
petrochemical, chemical, and refinery sectors as well as in the 
oil sector. And then in other sectors not directly linked to 
oil, such as the sector of industry for agriculture. There are 
great opportunities for investments by major foreign companies 
in Russia, but we must not waste time, we must begin to work 
aggressively. I would like ENI to develop wide-ranging projects. 
  [Campesato] There is a problem of returns on investments. 
  [Chernomyrdin] I do not rule out cooperation in other 
sectors, but the more immediate and best returns are those from 
large-scale projects in the fields of energy and raw materials. 
  [Campesato] In the West there have been fears about Russia's 
capacity to export energy products. 
  [Chernomyrdin] There are no problems of any kind. Moreover, 
Italy will draw an extra 6 billion cubic meters of gas under the 
recently-stipulated contract. But this does not refer to the 
supply of methane only. The contract is very important because 
it provides for the introduction of new technologies, remote 
measuring and control systems, new turbocompressor groups. This 
means a great deal of cooperation between Italy and Russia in 
the future. 
  [Campesato] Italian companies had demonstrated their 
interest in the upgrading of Soviet electric power plants. Have 
these projects been abandoned? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Not at all. In the future we will tend to 
increase our cooperation with multinational groups in the energy 
sector. For example using gas power plants for the production 
of electricity. And then perhaps looking at the exploitation 
and combined use of electronuclear power plants. 
  [Campesato] There is a more general problem however: 
creating 
conditions that will encourage Western investments. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Our fundamental objective is to limit 
inflation and stabilize the financial system. We can do it: 
What we realy lack is time. 
  [Campesato] But some fear that the reforms could be stopped. 
  [Chernomyrdin] We are focusing on speeding up reforms as 
planned and streamlining privatization. But as you can 
understand, these issues are not easy to resolve. 
  [Campesato] Reforms are not implemented by fine talk. 
  [Chernomyrdin] There is a Russian proverb that says: "You 
can say halva, halva, halva, but your mouth will not become 
sweeter." We will try to extract more, refine more, drill deeper 
in order to earn more and develop other sectors. And this will 
be done in cooperation with Western companies. Our philosophy 
is this: Invest, spend, have a return to reinvest. Otherwise 
you are right, fine talk does not lead to reforms. 
  [Campesato] The reform toward a market economy has created 
several problems such as unemployment. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Official statistics show that there are 
900,000 unemployed. In a country with a population of 150 
million that is nothing. 
  [Campesato] Those are the statistics. But in reality.... 
  [Chernomyrdin] In reality, unemployment is a problem of 
great concern to us. Because if we really began to speed up the 
rate of reforms in order to achieve results as soon as possible, 
we would have to contend with a number of companies going 
bankrupt. And at that point unemployment would become an even 
more serious problem. 
  [Campesato] And then? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Then we could pass a law on bankruptcy. But 
if it is to work properly, we must also adopt measures to get 
companies back on their feet. We must create the conditions so 
that privatized companies can generate profits, on completely 
new foundations. It will be an enormous effort because of these 
complicated issues that are so closely intertwined.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Italian Navy To Send More Naval Units </F>
to Gulf"] 
  [Text] Abu Dhabi -- Ships from the Italian Navy are to sail 
to the Persian Gulf from the Adriatic Sea, from the 
Mediterranean and from the waters of Somalia. Ambassador to the 
Arab Emirates, Giovanni Ferrero, stated that there is no alert, 
it is merely routine. In fact, it is a maneuver to increase the 
Italian presence in the region and to ensure a "redistribution 
of forces." 
  Maurizio Vacca, military attache at the embassy, said that 
the decision did not mean that Italy had decided to sign a 
defense cooperation agreement with the Gulf Arab states -- as 
the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Russia did at 
the end of the Desert Storm campaign. The naval forces will be 
used as they are required and on an individual basis. 
  However, the military attache assured, there will be more 
frequent naval exercises in the Gulf: "We want to increase our 
presence in the Gulf. We want to contribute to maintaining 
stability in the region." 
  According to statements by Kuwaiti officials, the exercises 
will also serve to demonstrate to the Emirates which types of 
military equipment are most suited to the climate and waters 
around Kuwait. Since the end of the Gulf war, Kuwait has already 
participated in 150 naval maneuvers with various allied nations. 
Two Italian naval vessels have already completed a two-week 
maneuver in the Gulf with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Unlike the 
other allies, however, Italy has had a rather limited naval 
presence in the region to date.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan 31 (AFP) -- Italian Prime Minister Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi said here Monday [31 January] that he does not 
plan to run in the upcoming general elections in Italy and that 
his government would step down after the vote. 
  "My government was created last May to deal with a difficult 
phase of transition," Ciampi said during a press conference held 
after a meeting with Austrian Chancelor Franz Vranitzky. "The 
decision to hold new elections (27-28 March) puts an end to this 
transitional period and I have no intention of being a candidate 
during the elections." 
  Ciampi has been running a caretaker government since the 
dissolution of parliament earlier this month. 
  His decision not to run in the elections comes as Italy's 
political parties are trying to forge alliances ahead of the 
elections. Left-wing parties had been looking to Ciampi as 
their possible candidate for the post of prime minister.

<F P=106> [Gianfranco Modolo report: "`The North Is the Leagues'"] </F>
  [Text] Milan -- The political accord between the League and 
Forza Italia is struggling to take shape, because of the sharp 
disagreements and numerous hesitations on both sides. Yesterday 
at Villa San Martino, [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's 
headquarters, a meeting, described as "technical and electoral," 
took place between the parliamentary floor leaders of the 
League, Roberto Maroni and Francesco Speroni, and two Rooting 
for Italy officials, Domenico Lo Jucco -- Marcello Dell'Utri's 
assistant on Publitalia and the man in charge of finding and 
selecting Rooting for Italy's candidates -- and Roberto Cipriani. 
  The purpose of the meeting was supposed to be an examination 
and perhaps the drafting of the list of candidates that the 
League- Rooting for Italy alignment would field in the 
constituencies of northern Italy. Silvio Berlusconi himself 
spoke at the meeting, which lasted eight hours, though he 
declined to enter into technical details. [Northern League 
Secretary] Umberto Bossi's presence "in spirit" was much 
stronger; as the meeting was still in progress he issued a 
provocative communique to the news agencies: "Berlusconi must 
think about the Center and South; woe betide him if he thinks of 
taking away our votes in the North." Berlusconi quipped in 
reply, "a little local color is always pleasant," but this did 
not at all alter the substance of the dispute. 
  Clearly, after their long-distance argument, Speroni and 
Maroni (the latter still recovering from the incident with [Pact 
for Italy leader] Segni) had to be cautious: "There is no 
political agreement yet; it is necessary to surmount divergences 
and mutual mistrust. But we are very close," they announced at 
the end of the meeting. Later, in the evening, Bossi expressed 
his thoughts on television, setting the conditions for alliance 
with Rooting for Italy: "Berlusconi stood in parallel to the 
old political system. We will accept him only if he helps us to 
implement economic liberalism and to put an end to the abuse of 
the welfare state. We will accept him, above all, if he 
presents himself as a mediator between North and South, if he 
succeeds in reconciling the country. In this role he does not 
even need a party. Let it be clear, however that it is we who 
are in the North -- not Berlusconi." 
  So, leaving aside all the "isms," Bossi's message is 
tantamount to an ukase: Berlusconi can serve to bring votes 
from the South, where the League's presence is small, but be 
absolutely must not establish himself in the political fabric of 
the North. Berlusconi owns television networks, newspapers, and 
money, but according to Bossi, he does not yet enjoy any support 
among the voters. "He wants to be a political leader," the 
League's secretary said, "but that is for the voters to decide." 
  In other words, if Berlusconi wants to put forward a 
blueprint on which basis to seek 50 percent of the candidates 
that the new alignment will field in the various constituencies, 
this would all take the form of a plan contrary, alternative, 
and opposed to Bossi's. "We would pursue our own path. 
Berlusconi would no longer be our mediator, and we would do 
without him." 
  This is how the first "technical" meeting between the League 
and Rooting for Italy ended -- with diktats and quips. Now 
Berlusconi will have to impart substance to his capacity for 
mediation in order to reassure his potential ally. But 
yesterday there was talk about candidates, too: "Tiziana 
Parenti was thinking of standing in Milan," Speroni said, "but 
for magistrates there are considerations of geographical 
incompatibility." It seems virtually certain, however, that 
Bossi will stand as the League's candidate for central Milan. 
The progressive bloc might field the writer, Umberto Eco, 
against him.

<F P=106> [Alessandro Longo report: "`Scalfaro Must Leave'"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- President Scalfaro is "the last president of 
the First Republic" and therefore cannot be "the first of the 
Second" if "the renewal is to proceed." [Italian Social 
Movement (MSI) Secretary] Gianfranco Fini carried the MSI public 
with him. He received loud applause for his opposition to 
Scalfaro at the last day of the congress that ratified the 
"swing" toward the "grand right" of the National Alliance. 
  Fini asked the audience: "Do you know what the left will do 
if it accedes to government? It will allow Scalfaro to retain 
his post after 27 March. And this is unacceptable...." More 
applause. After leaving the platform, he added: "I have said 
it, and I repeat it. I do not consider it appropriate for 
Scalfaro, who was involved in that mysterious business 
concerning the intelligence services, to continue in his 
post...." Nor would just any change of president be acceptable. 
"What if they bring in Jotti? Can you imagine that? Keep in 
mind that she does have a chance. She is a woman, she had a 
role in the Resistance...." 
  They devoured him with their eyes, both friends sand 
enemies, 
as they experienced differing emotions. The die is cast. Now 
there will be no compromise. Did anyone think that the Alliance 
was merely "a tactical move designed to gain a few more members 
of parliament?" They will have to think again, Fini warned. 
The National Alliance, of which the MSI is the linchpin, "is a 
great blueprint for the future." Fini was not intimidated by 
the presence in the front row of Assunta Almirante [widow of 
former MSI Secretary Giorgio Almirante]; her daughter, Giuliana 
Almirante (who drew more attention thanks to memories of her 
father); or Alessandra Mussolini, the duce's granddaughter. Nor 
was he influenced by the awkward condemnation -- though it did 
not lead to a separation -- issued by [MSI ideologue Pino] Rauti 
("Did we establish the Republic of Salo just to achieve economic 
liberalism, just to introduce Coca-Cola?") 
  Fini dealt with the internal dissidents. Even the Nazi 
skinheads appeared, brandishing a banner, then disappeared, 
removed by the security guards. The time has come to look after 
the allies. "There is an understanding" with [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi and the Christian Social group. The same 
values apply -- God, the family, the homeland -- as can be seen 
from the television propaganda. Negotiations with the League 
are more difficult. Fini did not rule out the possibility of a 
"technical agreement." "Some headway" could be made together, 
but only on the following conditions: The League must resolve 
the uncertainty over national unity, must say whether there is 
one republic or three; then it will be possible to start 
negotiating. How? By secretly sharing out constituencies, one 
in exchange for another? No, that would be too "petty," too 
restricted. Any agreement, the MSI secretary said, must 
"materialize out in the open." No secret trysts, no secret love 
affairs. Only agreements on policy and on the constituencies, 
with equal "status." 
  Carlo Tassi did not give a damn for all this; he defied this 
congress for renewal by giving a fascist salute from the stage 
and by bringing with him [French National Front leader] Le Pen's 
second-in-command as an unofficial guest. Although he lives in 
Piacenza, he has always bought cars with Como license plates, to 
avoid the letters "PC" [for Piacenza and communist party]. He 
was heard to say: "The agreement with the League is fait 
accompli.... We will give him a real shafting." 
  These may be mere quips. But one thing is certain: The 
dance of rapprochement will not be easy. Fini refuses to take 
"the first steps, either direct or indirect"; he wants no 
"ambassadors." If [Northern League Secretary] Bossi so desires, 
he is willing to negotiate; otherwise, never mind. He will 
shoulder the "responsibility" for a possible victory by the 
left-wing forces. But Bossi "cannot lose if he wants to retain 
his leadership." Leadership is indeed one of the problems for 
the right-wing alignment (Fini does not like the adjective, 
"moderate" -- "it smacks of compromise.") 
  The chances of an accord depend also on who is put forward 
as 
the next prime minister. Berlusconi or Bossi? As, Fini has 
already said: "The indication of a prime minister may be 
important to the public, but it is not obligatory. I would have 
no hesitation in choosing between Bossi and Berlusconi. I would 
opt for Berlusconi because he has potential in both the North 
and the South, whereas Bossi can only be a leader in the North."

<F P=106> [Article by Giorgio Battistini: "The Gray Thing Is Born and </F>
Is Waiting for Senatur Bossi"] 
  [Text] Moving toward the elections. At the National 
Alliance party convention, Fini attacks Segni and reevaluates 
the Lega. And Forza Italia indicates its "compatibility." 
  Fini's National Alliance springs forth born from 
Berlusconi's 
right rib. In reality, it is the MSI [Italian Social Movement] 
with the addition of many converts: former Catholics, former 
Liberals (Costa and Biondi are interested, even though they did 
not attend), and a few former Socialists. For the time being, it 
is little more than a thing, the Gray Thing--actually a faded 
black. It wears an air of respectability and comes in the 
economy package so as not to waste votes--old-style, family 
size. It is a barrier against the dreaded "red tide." It is the 
immutable nucleus around which the moderates (from Forza Italia 
to Bossi and including the centrists and the fleeing right-wing 
Christian Democrats) can gather when the time comes for a 
conservative majority. And what about Mario Segni? "A snake 
charmer," hissed Gianfranco Fini (but he quotes him 16 times in 
his closing speech). 
  Fini is the leader of a party that hopes to garner heavy 
gains in votes and image from this maneuver, following their 
strong showing in mayoral elections in Rome and Naples. The 
setting is a large hall in the back of a hotel in Rome. In the 
same hotel, Communist Renewal is holding its party convention at 
the same time. They are only 30 rooms away, but a few centuries 
separate these opposite extremes. Their understated logo 
consists of three red, white, and green brushstrokes. Eight 
hundred delegates and 2,000 guests are in attendance, many more 
than had been anticipated. A few MSI Deputies are present, but 
the militant rank and file is noticeably absent as planned. This 
is the debut of the respectable political right, which is a 
high-quality product for the middle classes that are in a 
confused muddle. It represents a daring strategy on the part of 
the leaders of a new party that leaves behind any nostalgia for 
the good old days and opens the way for an ultra modern 
technocracy that is actively courting the Catholic vote. On the 
platform, we find right-wing Christian Democrats like Fiori and 
Selva; and in the audience, some former Christian Democrats who 
are mad at Martinazzoli and even a venerable former head of the 
Revenue Guards (and of Sismi [Intelligence and Military Security 
Service], Ramponi, who calls for a tax cut. One of the 
interested observers is Francesco D'Onofrio (former Christian 
Democrat and now a centrist outsider), who came to offer his 
well-meaning "recognition," explaining that the "great majority 
of Catholic voters belong to the center right, whereas its 
leadership does not. The cold war had concealed this difference. 
Now that everything has broken apart, are we the only ones who 
should stand in the center, providing the highest, solitary 
witness that Martinazzoli is calling for? Even the pope praised 
the market as an instrument of liberty." 
  Another high-ranking observer is Giuliano Urbani, the 
political scientist at Fininvest who is Berlusconi's ghost 
writer. With him is Antonio Tajani, a young spokesman for the 
group. Urbani is pleased with the way the day went. He says he 
"came to show his interest" and support. Bobbio is absolutely 
right--the First Republic will not completely die (and, I say, 
there will not a happy birth) if we cannot first overcome the 
deadly dichotomy between fascism and antifascism. I have not 
heard anyone here express sorrow over the end of Salazar's 
regime in Portugal. I see minimum differences of opinion, even 
though their origins hark back to the distant past. We are all 
the "children of our history, and this is important." 
  It is a remarkable event and, in its own way, even an 
historic one. A very agreeable right-wing is on parade in the 
audience: an ecologist, a writer, a labor union representative, 
a bureaucrat, and even a terrifying anti-Bossi Leghist. Fini is 
the ecumenical secretary who is trying to relegate fascism to 
the archives of history. He is trying to redeem (now or never) 
those growing millions of votes he has. He is widening the 
political boundaries of a right that longs to lead the 
government, that suffers, and volunteers itself. 
  What about the economy? This is Pietro Armani's (former 
center-left-wing president of IRI [Institute for Industrial 
Reconstruction]) formula. We need a strong majority "that knows 
how to force decisions that are certainly not pleasant or 
popular." He has four [as published] exhortations: fewer 
administrative restrictions on company decisions; more private 
(with less taxation) and public (long-term debt) investments; a 
policy for demographic growth; a revival of research; striving 
to comply with European standards while better defending 
national interests; and paying for public services based on 
actual cost. He promises the return of the "salary brackets" 
favored by Berlusconi. "At relatively lower labor costs in the 
south, they fostered the first valid industrial developments." 
An absolute faith in the "market" and in a "free economy" is 
guaranteed to the moderates on the right, even though they 
oppose technocracies and support public employment. Having said 
that, "politics is the primary tool to regulate, but not 
intervene in, the production process," declares conservative 
philosopher Domenico Fisichella. The Alliance's attitude toward 
the Lega is sweet and sour: a lot of understanding for the 
voters, but none for their leaders. They are actually accused of 
having a Marxist-style vision of the state. 
  But even Fini (acclaimed coordinator of the Alliance) seems 
to think they have gone too far and he makes some revisions. His 
reevaluates the Lega: "If Bossi is not still under the effect of 
his honeymoon, his new opinion of us (the only force in the 
center south that is neither for state socialism nor for the 
welfare state) is a great step forward from the state of war in 
the past." He detests Mario Segni ("he is deceiving himself; he 
will have to make a choice") because he is suspended between the 
right and the left and most of all because "he has volunteered 
to lead a government that is open to the moderate progressives, 
which includes the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], but 
excludes the Rete and Communist Renewal once they have been used 
and discarded."

  [Text] The Second Republic: the battle at the 
presidential palace, the Quirinale. 
  Accused by former Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic 
Security Service] agents, threatened by assassination plots, and 
challenged by his former DC [Christian Democratic Party] friends 
who are against holding early elections, President Scalfaro is 
under attack. However, he does not seem to be giving up. 
  "No, I do not think he has any lost weight at all. In fact, 
he wanted me to give him the Donald Duck pin I always wear in my 
button hole. Of course, he is tense, but he is holding up well. 
And I have understood why. He is sustained by two great 
resources: His Roman Catholic upbringing has taught him 
patience; and his experience as a magistrate has given him the 
conviction that, sooner or later, he will be able to unravel 
this mess." PSDI [Italian Socialist Democratic Party] Secretary 
Enrico Ferri is also a magistrate and is also up to his neck in 
troubles with a party that is dissolving and with the upcoming 
elections. But on Tuesday, 11 January, he went to the Quirinale, 
and now he speaks, with the affection of a friend, about the 
drama of Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. 
  The gentlemanly President Scalfaro has been muddied and 
threatened with new disclosures and even attempts on his life. 
He was the man chosen to ensure and guide the transition to the 
Second Republic. Now he is in danger of going down with the 
First Republic, whose end he himself wanted to hasten, by 
accepting Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's resignation and 
dissolving Parliament after only 21 months. 
  So, the Quirinale is living the most difficult moments of 
the 
Scalfaro era. The palace is under maximum surveillance. On duty 
inside are the body guards, and outside, the ROS [Special 
Operations Section] units of the Carabinieri are even equipped 
with laser weapons. The presidential secretary general, Gaetano 
Gifuni, has strictly forbidden Scalfaro's entire staff, even his 
highest level colleagues, to release statements to the press. 
Even when he leaves the palace, reporters are no longer allowed 
to approach the head of state. When he visited Catania before 
Christmas, an army of 800 agents was mobilized to ensure his 
safety. More and more often, Scalfaro goes to mass in the chapel 
inside the Quirinale. He constantly changes his routine without 
notice: spending one night in his private home in the Forte 
Bravetta quarter and the next night in the Quirinale. He can use 
the small apartment in the little Fuga palace, which was 
Francesco Cossiga's favorite for his afternoon rests, or else 
the other rooms that have been readied for the emergency from 
among the 2,000 rooms in the great palatial residence. In a 
couple of months, the presidential apartment will also be ready 
at the end of the Manica Lunga wing, which has remained 
uninhabited since the times of [former President] Giovanni 
Leone. It is a 500-square-meter apartment in the shape of a T, 
with four bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen, a private 
dining room, and another enormous dining room for receiving 
guests. 
  Scalfaro is a man alone. It seems ironical that, in order to 
portray him, we cannot avoid using the adjective, "alone," which 
had become the distinctive characteristic of the last moments of 
Cossiga's presidency, that seven-year term that Scalfaro had to 
banish. And now he, too--just like his predecessor who visited 
him on the afternoon of Friday, 7 January, to offer his full 
support--finds himself threatened and surrounded by a wall of 
ice. 
  This is not due just to the disclosures about the Sisde 
scandal. His own party, his beloved DC, does not forgive him for 
his decision to call for immediate elections, which was as much 
a slap to those tortured by the nightmare of not getting 
reelected as it was to Mino Martinazzoli, who is in great need 
of more time to build his new Popular Party. Rumors that 
Scalfaro would resign immediately following the elections were 
rampant and even expressed out loud by DC group leader Gerardo 
Bianco. They indicate a hostility resembling a vendetta carried 
out in words. Today, most of Parliament, which was his great 
love, regards him with scorn. It is not convinced of the new, 
unknown direction the head of the state has chosen. 
  "Of course it does not, because for the first time in the 
history of the Republic," says constitutional expert Augusto 
Barbera of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], "the 
Quirinale is not dissolving Parliament because it cannot resolve 
a governmental crisis. It is doing so because it no longer feels 
Parliament represents the country and because it wants to allow 
a new electoral law to be implemented." That is the refrain that 
Scalfaro obsessively repeats to everyone he encounters. But it 
is a subjective evaluation and an extremely delicate one. It has 
only two precedents, both in distant times: in 1913, when 
universal suffrage was granted, and in 1919, when they passed 
from a majoritarian electoral system to a proportional one. It 
is a hard pill to swallow. 
  Even an old friend of the president, Alfredo Biondi of the 
PLI [Italian Liberal Party], went to the Quirinale on Wednesday, 
12 January, and gave vent to his rage: "Oscar, you cannot offer 
the Italians a musical instrument that cannot be played yet. It 
takes time to make a majoritarian system work. You can see that, 
can't you? The alliances are far from complete, and we risk 
having more confusion than ever...." 
  It is causing the head of state a lot of mental anguish. 
Almost all his traditional reference points are against him, 
while at his side he--who has always been anti-Communist--finds 
Achille Occhetto, who hopes to come away a winner in the spring 
elections. The private portrait of the besieged president is a 
mixture of anguish, nervousness, and a display of serenity 
worthy of a Christian martyr. Enzo Bianco, who as mayor had 
welcomed him to Catania, recalls with affection that he had 
often caught him gritting his teeth--the only, almost 
imperceptible sign of tension. 
  Tuesday, 11 January, as he was leaving the palace of the 
Constitutional Court, where he had gone for the 1994 opening 
session of the Court, was the first time Scalfaro responded 
rudely to a reporter who had managed to approach him. This is 
another sign of his distress. At the reception at the Quirinale 
during the holidays, the head of the Lega Senators, Francesco 
Speroni, had approached Scalfaro warmly and remarked on the 
abundance of Piedmontese specialties in the buffet. He received 
a cold response: "My maitre d' attended hotel school in Stresa." 
There are even moments of anger. There are whispers about the 
rage of the president when he read a comment attributed to 
Martinazzoli that "the Quirinale is a hostage of the PDS." There 
was a phone call that attempted to clarify the matter between 
the two men, but the incident has not been totally forgotten. 
  So there have been many dark moments. However, they have 
been 
tempered by the resources of a man who has a very strong 
character. Capuchin Friar Igino Ciabattoni, who was Scalfaro's 
spiritual advisor for many years and is now involved in a drug 
rehabilitation facility in the Marches, waxes lyrical about his 
friend Oscar. He says that because he "is a Franciscan lay 
brother, he has a clear conscience as big and deep as the 
ocean." Christian Democrat Luigi Granelli, another old friend 
who went to see him on Tuesday, 11 January, mentions a rare 
moment of happiness. They had discussed the pope's letter to the 
Italian bishops. "It is a different field," said a pleased 
Scalfaro, "but the call for Italian unity from such an 
authoritative source is moving." 
<H5>  The Nightmare of Misfortune </H5>
  Among the things that soothe the president are the flower 
arrangements his daughter Marianna expertly composes with 
blossoms from the Quirinale gardens and the hearty bowls of 
pasta seasoned with hot red pepper that he puts away. This is 
the head of state's favorite dish, and he has not cut down on 
its consumption in recent weeks. His official activity has not 
fallen off either. On the contrary, he has made a show of 
remaining very busy, almost as if he wanted to emphasize his 
role of trustee in all aspects of the country's life. For 
example, military leaders, the Palermo Prosecutor Gian Carlo 
Caselli, and the anti-Mafia Prosecutor Bruno Siclari have all 
visited the president since the beginning of 1994. 
  While the First Republic is in the throes of death, the 
nightmare of misfortune that has befallen all the DC presidents 
since the days of Antonio Segni again hangs over the 
presidential palace. The prince of astrologers, Peter Van Wood 
from Holland, had told Scalfaro in a restaurant near 
Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies building] a year before it 
happened that Scalfaro would be elected president. Now he is 
predicting his early resignation, "by his own choice, however, 
out of moral revulsion." But Mayor Bianco did notice something 
during the presidential visit to Catania before Christmas. After 
kneeling in prayer in the Cathedral of Sant'Agata before the 
skull of the saint covered in porcelain and precious stones, 
Scalfaro invited the chorus that was chanting the "Hallelujah" 
to sing in the Quirinale at Christmas time in 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Mino Fuccillo: "The Challenge of the Prime </F>
Ministers"] 
  [Text] Three on one side, and three on the 
other--just like the Horatii and the Curiatii--in the battle for 
Chigi Palace [office of the prime minister]. Mario Segni has 
many sponsors [preceding word in English], but in an area that 
is not very homogeneous. And Bossi--or even Berlusconi--might 
come to the fore. The left says: "There is a candidate, but his 
name is not being spoken." 
  Do you recall the story of the Horatii and the Curiatii? It 
used to be taught in school. They were three against three, and 
at the end only one remained standing. Something similar is 
occurring a couple of centuries later, also in the region of 
Rome: three "champions" per team, and in the end only one will 
be prime minister. The "moderate" or "center-right" team--also 
referred to as the "freedom axis"--consists of Mario Segni, 
Umberto Bossi, and Silvio Berlusconi. The "progressive" or 
"left" team--also referred to as the "reformist axis"--counters 
with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Achille Occhetto, and Giorgio 
Napolitano. The voters will decide who will be the Horatii and 
who the Curiatii, that is to say, who will be the victors and 
who the vanquished. Many other factors will play a role in 
determining who of the six will be the last to remain standing. 
Let us try to identify the factors involved. 
  Mario Segni is the first--and, in fact, the 
leading--anti-left candidate. Yesterday, he received the support 
and homage of the "lay members of the Pact for Italy," as former 
PLI [Italian Liberal Party] Deputy Secretary Patuelli and the 
well-remembered former Cultural Heritage Minister Bono Parrino 
now call themselves. Segni also received an expression of 
support yesterday from Martinazzoli (now a daily occurrence), on 
condition that he not cast his lot with Bossi, and from Bossi, 
on condition that he turn a deaf ear to Martinazzoli. Despite 
these minor problems that remain to be solved, quite a few 
people favor Segni as head of the future government, including 
the newborn Italian Popular Party [PPI] (Martinazzoli); the 
rising Forza Italia party (Berlusconi); the CCD [Christian 
Democratic Center], in its initial endorsement (Mastella and 
friends); and Lega, in its initial alliance with the 
"politicians." They all want Segni and are pledged to support 
him. 
  Segni does have a problem, however, and it is a big one: as 
his supporters increase in number, so also do those who have 
faith in him only up to a certain point. Also increasing in 
number are those supporters who, because of certain resentments, 
are themselves more or less silent candidates and will change 
sides at the opportune moment. An older--and spiteful--gentleman 
such as Senator Miglio yesterday explained why. "Segni has 
vacillated on too many occasions," Miglio said. "He has made it 
plain that what he seeks is power, and above all to become 
president." As anyone can see in photographs and on TV, Miglio 
has good ears; he must have heard a few things and concluded 
that Segni will have to win the elections by a large margin, for 
otherwise the prime ministerial candidate who gets the greatest 
exposure and highest approval ratings before the elections, in 
fact, will be the least likely to become prime minister. Lega, 
Forza Italia, the Popular Party, and their entourage may indeed 
band together and run a kind of super ticket under the slogan 
"Better dead than red" (the phrase is Giuliano Amato's). In that 
case, Segni will be prime minister if the super ticket obtains a 
clear majority of seats in Parliament. If the ticket falls only 
a few dozen seats short, however, deals would have to be made 
with different groups and the flag would perforce have to be 
lowered. Would Fini come to the rescue? The MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] secretary does not, in fact, appear to be very fond of 
Mario Segni. Commenting on the most recent "Pact for Italy" 
platform, he delivered the MSI's statement of annoyance and 
disapproval. "All that the platform lacks," he said, "is a 
promise that with Segni in Palazzo Chigi, there will be no more 
rain." 
  But perhaps there will be no super ticket, and Lega and 
Forza 
Italia will go their own way, without the Popularists [members 
of the PPI]. They would then need a different standard-bearer. 
Perhaps Bossi himself, but that would be like the time when the 
PCI [Italian Communist Party] sponsored Terracini for the 
Presidency of the Republic: It was to pay him homage and issue a 
challenge, and afterward the real negotiations began in earnest. 
Or it could be Berlusconi himself, inasmuch as he is already out 
of control--acting as party secretary, holding meetings, 
negotiating, mediating, and giving orders. Moreover, if you take 
at face value the polls that are concocted at Fininvest, 
Berlusconi could even win the elections; with all due respect, 
however, to go from president of Milan [soccer team] to prime 
minister of Italy would be a giant step indeed. What will become 
of Segni if the right decides to compete with the center? He 
would remain the candidate of Martinazzoli and Pact for Italy. 
It would then be necessary to make deals--perhaps with the 
"progressives" who, however, would not accept Segni. The 
Popularists would not mind that; some of their supporters have 
already made note of the fact that it was Segni who moved them 
to the right, and some also point out that Segni had previously 
moved them to the left. They have already let it be known that 
they will not forget. 
  And what of the other camp? At least for now, Achille 
Occhetto is not accepting the urgent invitation from 
Confindustria President Abete to announce the name of the left's 
prime minister-designate. Failure to do so, Occhetto said, will 
cause the left's candidates to lose credibility among the voters 
whose support they seek. In an interview appearing in L'UNITA, 
the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] secretary said that "a 
law that does not exist should not necessarily be imitated," 
namely, a law mandating that a candidate's name be announced and 
publicized. And yesterday Abete made a further explanation. "If 
there were such a law," he said, "we would hold primaries within 
our electoral alliance. Inasmuch as such a law does not exist, I 
say this to anyone who votes for us: There are three possibile 
candidates, if we are victorious. They are: The leader of the 
strongest party in the alliance; a prominent figure in the 
alliance who would represent it; or lastly, a prominent figure 
whom I would call democracy's backup player." Outside of the 
IdentiKit, however, there are three other possibilities: 
Occhetto himself, Napolitano, and Ciampi. The progressives are 
having some difficulty in choosing their candidate before the 
election, and also some embarrassment. Occhetto's candidacy is a 
somewhat frightening (and somewhat disappointing) prospect; 
Napolitano's candidacy has the appearance of a banner that would 
subsequently be lowered; and Ciampi's candidacy could emerge at 
the end of the process but not at the beginning. Can you imagine 
Orlando as the nominee, in view of the fact that he is already 
tempted to send his Rete party to the polls alone in order to 
gain strength in Sicilian electoral districts and campaign for 
Ciampi? And can you imagine Cossutta in that role, 
notwithstanding all the political realism that the Communist 
Renewal party has manifested in recent days? And although Ciampi 
took himself out of the race, we can speak to him about it 
again, but only after the elections, when the voting results 
themselves might suggest him--or impose him--as the solution. 
Ciampi is the right man for the progressives if they win but do 
not win decisively. D'Alema and Occhetto have already said this, 
but how does one go about shouting it? 
  And so it is the Horatii versus the Curiatii, with Miglio, 
as 
usual, cutting the ground from under the feet of his own people 
by saying: "The moderates do not have a real leader," and with 
the progressives having perhaps more than one leader but not 
knowing whether--or how--to bring him to the fore. Lastly, there 
is the ultimate possibility: the prospect that, contrary to what 
the story tells us, this time the Horatii and the Curiatii will 
kill themselves off so that no one really wins the elections. 
Those who predict a center-left that is oriented toward the year 
2000--a government that is an enemy neither of the progressives 
nor of the Popularists but rather a friend to both--are proving 
to be correct. In that case, there is a seventh possibility: 
Romano Prodi. Prodi is more acceptable to Martinazzoli than 
Segni is and would perhaps not displease the progressives 
either. But what really is the center-left? Is it a factor for 
equilibrium in Italy or a ghost of those who will never return? 
The answer will come on a night in the month of March. 
<H5>  [Box, p 8 (Photo captions)] </H5>
<H5>  Two Teams and Six Candidates </H5>
  1. Umberto Bossi: The Lega's strongest leader. 
  2. Carlo Azeglio Ciampi: A leader for a broad progressive 
sector. The moderates also like him. 
  3. Mario Segni: The moderate front is united behind him, but 
if it suffers defeat, the current consensus could become a 
boomerang [preceding word in English]. 
  4. Achille Occhetto: He is head of the strongest party in 
the 
coalition that may well win the elections. In other countries, 
this would be sufficient qualification to become prime 
minister--but in Italy will it be enough? 
  5. Silvio Berlusconi: He has already found politics to his 
liking. It is a long way from being president of Milan to being 
prime minister, however. 
  6. Romano Prodi: Martinazzoli and the progressives like him. 
He is a potential leader of a "center-left [government] of the 
year 2000."

<F P=106> [Article by Renzo Rosati: "But Will the Left Really Win?"] </F>
  [Text] Although the polls make the progressive front 
the favorite, the center is gaining strength, Lega's numbers are 
dropping, and many voters are undecided. 
  The left will win--with a plurality of the votes--and the 
new 
government will be controlled by the PDS [Democratic Party of 
the Left]. "This will mean that Carlo Azeglio Ciampi returns to 
Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]," Davide Visani, 
coordinator of the PDS secretariat and the number three person 
at Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters, Rome] told PANORAMA, "so 
that he can complete the transition to the new Republic. His 
administration, however, should no longer be institutional in 
character but political, and therefore our ministers and our 
allies of the progressive front will be present in it." The PDS, 
he said, would even want some of its current adversaries to 
serve in the administration. "Specifically, representatives of 
Mino Martinazzoli's Italian Popular Party [PPI] and Mario 
Segni's Pact for Italy," Visani explained. "We draw the line 
with regard to the Lega, Silvio Berlusconi, and the MSI [Italian 
Social Movement]." 
  This time, at Botteghe Oscure, they are true believers. The 
slogans are ready for the election campaign: "Defeat the 
Blundering Right" and--more simply--"Now." The left's posters 
bear a logo: no flowers or doves at all, just a logo. Someone 
conceived the idea of stitching together a gigantic banner 
bearing the pictures of Enrico Berlinguer and Palmiro Togliatti, 
to be hung on the balcony; but to play it safe they may go back 
to the usual drapery with the oak tree. "Today, however, we are 
setting out on the road to victory," Visani adds. 
  Will the left--led by the heirs of the PCI [Italian 
Communist 
Party]--really be governing the Italy of the Second Republic? To 
judge by the polls, that would appear to be the case. The major 
research institutes consulted by PANORAMA--CIRM [Italian Center 
for Market Research], SWG [Integrated Research Service], and 
Diakron (see accompanying tables)--indicate that the left has 
done very well in the initial surveys and is predicted to win as 
much as 40 percent of the total vote. A share that ranges from 
18 to 24 percent would go to a centrist group led by Segni; 
between 26 and 36 percent to a center-right front that includes 
Lega and Berlusconi's Forza Italia; and between 10 and 13 
percent to the National Alliance of MSI Secretary Gianfranco 
Fini. 
  There are many unknown quantities, however. "The principal 
unknown quantity," declares Renato Mannheimer, an expert on 
election trends, "is the fact that almost half of the population 
has not yet decided for whom to vote. Until a few years ago, the 
undecided were often those who wanted to keep their choices 
secret. Today, however, the indecision is genuine, and the 
forecasts could be turned upside down." CIRM Director Nicola 
Piepoli agrees. "The proportion of undecideds--which I put at 
around 30 percent--could overturn the forecasts. Moreover, these 
people change their minds from time to time. Today, they are 
aligned with the left, but within a week they could be lining up 
with Segni and Berlusconi." In the opinion of Roberto Weber, 
director of the SWG of Trieste, this uncertainty stems primarily 
from two sources. "The election alliances are an unknown 
quantity," he said. "So far there is only one coalition, that of 
the left. The center and the right are not getting together. 
Then there is the question: Who will be the candidates, and what 
will they say to the people?" 
  Other unknown factors also adversely affect the forecasts. 
First of all, the surveys are still being conducted by the old 
proportional method rather than by the majority method; they 
accordingly indicate the orientation of public opinion at the 
national level but do not predict the effects within the 
majority constituencies. There is one exception: Diakron of 
Milan--which works for Forza Italia--has already developed a 
model that translates the poll responses into parliamentary 
seats and has applied it to the most recent CIRM poll presented 
on 10 January in MILANO, ITALIA (see accompanying table). "In 
fact," explains Diakron's Managing Director Gianni Pilo, "we had 
already used a scenario similar to that of CIRM." Based on this 
scenario, the left would elect 370 deputies--an absolute 
majority--and could therefore govern alone. 
  Is this a credible forecast? Visani dismisses it out of 
hand. 
"It is a device used by Berlusconi to terrorize the public," he 
says. "Terrorism? How so?" Pilo retorts. "It is rather that the 
survey takes into consideration only the variable that is most 
favorable for the left, namely, a scenario in which the 
progressives are united while the Catholics are separated from 
the other moderate forces. We have obtained different 
percentages, however. If the moderates were to form a coalition, 
they would win an additional hundred or so seats and thereby 
overturn or equalize the results." 
  Here, then, is another element of uncertainty. It would not 
be a battle between two opposing forces--left versus right, 
social democrats versus free-enterprise democrats--but rather a 
three-way contest among a left coalition; a Catholic center that 
is basically heir to the DC [Christian Democratic Party]; and a 
center-right coalition. It would, in fact, be a four-way 
contest, if you add the rightist forces of Fini. "But then we 
would find ourselves again with the same old parties!" declares 
the former assistant editor of IL GIORNALE, Federico Orlando. 
His is a voice that is certainly not suspect, in view of his 
support for Segni and of his resignation--together with that of 
Indro Montanelli--in a dispute with Berlusconi. 
  How are the parties organized? For a two-way contest or for 
a 
fragmented contest? And can a party that falls behind get back 
on top? "The PDS is unquestionably in an advantageous position," 
agrees Stefano Draghi--for years the PCI's campaign strategist 
and currently PDS group leader in the Milan municipal 
government--who spent the summer in London studying the British 
electoral system in the British Library, "at Table G-17," he 
says, "where Karl Marx wrote DAS KAPITAL." "We are at the center 
of the left," he explains. "We are not yet facing an adversary 
who represents the leadership of the right. We are able to field 
high-quality candidates. We have the capacity to increase our 
membership. We are present throughout Italy: in the areas where 
we are strong, we shall have the Oak Tree [symbol of the PDS] 
with its thickets. Elsewhere, we shall support our allies." 
Specifically, however, how is the PDS conducting its campaign? 
The task force [preceding two words in English] that is 
coordinating the campaign is composed of Visani himself; Mauro 
Zani, the official in charge of organization; Massimo D'Alema, 
leader of the PDS deputies; and Giuseppe Chiaranti (a D'Alema 
ally) and Umberto Ranieri (a Migliori ally), respectively leader 
and assistant leader of the PDS senators. Ranieri, however, is 
under investigation in connnection with the Naples subway 
contracts. 
  "The coalition of the left," Visani says, "will range from 
the Democratic Alliance [AD] to Communist Renewal. In the 
north--where we are competing against the Lega--we hope to 
involve former DC members as well. There will be an accord with 
respect to the platform, but not with respect to the 
government," he explains, so as to avoid embarrassing Rete and 
Communist Renewal, which are opposed to Ciampi. "The leaders 
will test their strength within the majority constituencies," he 
adds. Some candidates are already being considered: Achille 
Occhetto and Nilde Iotti in Rome and D'Alema in Bari. In the 
Milan electoral districts, the progressives will run the 
clinician Renato Boeri; Rete leader Nando Dalla Chiesa; and the 
industrialist Franco Morganti. For his part, Dalla Chiesa would 
like to sponsor the candidacies of the journalists Giampaolo 
Pansa, co-editor of L'ESPRESSO, and Corrado Stajano. "Nothing is 
definite," Visani says. The PDS will then propose a mechanism to 
ensure that the results in the majority constituencies will be 
reflected proportionately on all the tickets of the left. It 
remains to be seen whether the allies will agree to this or 
whether they will view it as a "protective coating." Communist 
Renewal, in fact, boasts of its strength in Turin, Milan, Rome, 
and Tuscany, and Rete does the same with respect to the south. 
"And we," says AD's Walter Bordon, "are a decisive factor in 
Trieste, in Genoa, and on the Adriatic coast." 
  What is happening on the other fronts? On Thursday, 13 
January, Segni made another overture to Lega. There are many who 
swear that, in the end, not even Segni will be able to remain 
aloof from a clash between right and left. The battle plan will 
be presented at a meeting to be held on 5 February in the EUR 
[Roman Universal Exposition] convention center. At the present 
time, his organization is in good shape in Latium, Tuscany, 
Campania, Lombardy, and Venetia as well as in Sardinia where 
Segni will be a candidate in the Sassari district. The 
representatives of the Pact for Italy will be chosen by a system 
of primaries and self-promoted candidacies supported by citizen 
petitions. Segni believes that the rift between Berlusconi and 
Montanelli--and the pope's appeal to Catholics--may have 
increased his support by 2 percent. This theory is contradicted 
by Diakron, which says, "Nothing has changed." 
  The polls, however, indicate that the center is growing in 
strength--and that the Lega is in decline. "What is being 
revealed," says Weber, "is a party that benefited from the old 
system of proportional representation--a party that has been 
unable to find charismatic candidates." It is a void which the 
leaders of Forza Italia say they are ready to fill, and they 
have selected the electoral districts in Venetia, Liguria, and 
Piedmont in which to run their own candidates by agreement with 
the Lega. In the south, Berlusconi's movement is seeking to ally 
itself with the lay Catholic centrists. SWG and CIRM are not 
generous toward Forza Italia, but Mannheimer does not agree. "In 
my opinion," he says, "it has a 10 to 15 percent share of the 
electorate." 
  A poll conducted by SWG for FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA, however, 
indicates that if the prime minister were chosen by direct 
election, Berlusconi would get 25.8 percent of the vote, 
compared to 22 percent for Segni and 18.6 percent for Occhetto. 
This time, however, the great national festival will be 
fragmented into many local contests. "Only 18,000 families will 
be needed to elect one deputy," Piepoli points out. A study made 
by SCR [expansion unknown] Associates marketing [preceding word 
in English] agency offers advice. "The candidates," it says, 
"should base their campaign on the personalization of their 
message, on direct communication, and on their ability to 
attract the attention of the media. A strong effort will be 
needed to establish genuine rapport with the public." SCR 
estimates the cost of the campaign at 320 billion lire, with 
approximately 4,000 candidates in the field. The ceiling 
established by law is 100 million lire per candidate. "It is an 
investment that should be entrusted to experts," SCR says. 
Door-to-door canvassing, electoral marketing [preceding word in 
English], and American-style consultants are making their debut 
in Italy. In the end, will these techniques enable the left or 
the right to win?

<H5>  A Comparison of Forecasts </H5>
  We present separately the results of the three most recent 
voter polls conducted by public opinion survey institutes, 
together with the unofficial PDS forecasts (all data are in 
percentages). In the week preceding 10 January, CIRM interviewed 
a total of 4,129 persons. The SWG survey--valid as of 4 
January--is based on 5,600 interviews. Diakron--which works for 
Forza Italia--conducted its poll between 7 and ll January. 
Noteworthy in the CIRM survey is the seesaw performance of Forza 
Italia (which stood at 10 and 16 percent in the two previous 
surveys). SWG provides a comparison with October: the figures 
for the PDS are stable; the AD-Greens-Rete coalition, the Pact 
for Italy-PPI alliance, and the National Alliance show increases 
while Communist Renewal and Lega show decreases (Forza Italia 
was not included in the survey). In Diakron's previous 
survey--which was conducted between 13 and 21 December--the PDS 
received 19.3 percent, Communist Renewal 4.8 percent, the PSI 
[Italian Socialist Party] 2.1 percent, Rete 4.0 percent, the 
Greens 5.4 percent, and the AD 2.8 percent (for a total of 38.4 
percent attributable to the left coalition); the PPI 6.9 percent 
and the Pact for Italy 11.5 percent (for a total of 18.4 
percent); and Forza Italia 10.4 percent, Pannella 2.7 percent, 
Lega 15.1 percent, and the Laics 3.0 percent (for a total of 
31.2 percent attributable to the center-right coalition); and 
the National Alliance 11.2 percent. 
  Although the PDS has not yet set up its own polling system, 
the expert Stefano Draghi is developing a new model. Its 
forecasts do not differ greatly from those of CIRM and SWG: the 
progressive coalition is credited with 40 to 42 percent, with 
the PDS accounting for half of the total. The Greens show an 
increase, Communist Renewal remains stationary at 6 percent, 
while the AD accounts for the smallest share of the coalition's 
total. Among the coalition's adversaries, the Lega registers a 
decline--to approximately 14 percent--and likewise Forza Italia 
which, after having surpassed 10 percent, "is on a downward 
curve." The centrist forces of Mino Martinazzoli and Mario Segni 
register an upward trend--to 20 percent--while an increase to 15 
percent is forecast for the National Alliance.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F>
Claus Gennrich in Bonn on 20 January: "The Course of Events in 
Moscow Worries Officials in Bonn: The Lava Is Flowing"] 
  [Text] The Federal Government is trying to understand 
events in Moscow as well as possible future developments. 
Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl still intends to talk with 
President Yeltsin on the telephone this Friday [21 January] to 
ask him about the new cabinet list and the future course of the 
government. Meanwhile, it has been expected in Bonn, even 
before the conversation, that Yeltsin will tell the chancellor 
that he was in control of the situation and that the reforms 
would continue. Kohl is expected to tell Yeltsin that he will 
continue to support him and the reforms. Before that, Kohl had a 
long telephone conversation with U.S. President Clinton that 
ended with the two men agreeing that Kohl would ask Yeltsin 
about developments triggered by the meeting the two presidents 
held in Moscow; in a week, Kohl and Clinton will further 
coordinate their position during the chancellor's visit to 
Washington. In the Foreign Ministry and in the Chancellor's 
Office, the question whether Finance Minister Fedorov would 
remain in the government was interpreted as an indicator for the 
future of the reform policy and the West's position toward 
Russia. Diplomats in Bonn have, therefore, been following 
alternating reports about Fedorov with great attention. 
  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE: 
"For the World Bank and the IMF, the most important financial 
institutes for Russia, Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar, who has 
since resigned, and Fedorov used to be the two 
confidence-building personalities; they maintained the contact. 
If both were to go, this would result in a considerable loss of 
confidence for Moscow." If the changing reports on Fedorov were 
to end with his resignation from the government, which was 
unclear on Thursday, "then this would constitute a major 
setback." Nevertheless, Kinkel said that as far as Germany is 
concerned, "there is no alternative to the reform policy; it has 
to be supported." Kinkel advised against "dramatizing warnings." 
<H5>  Yeltsin-Chernomyrdin-Fedorov </H5>
  Kinkel assumed that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin would try to 
"strike a compromise." If Fedorov ultimately were to resign, 
only Deputy Prime Minister Chubays, who is in charge of 
privatization, would remain of the original hard core of 
reformers in the government. Kinkel said the conclusion for 
German foreign policy was that "the West must continue to help 
Yeltsin, under the condition that the objectives of reform must 
not be seriously threatened." As criteria for assessing 
Moscow's reform policy, Kinkel mentioned "the fight against 
inflation, the inclusion of the central bank into the policy of 
monetary stability, the continued efforts for privatization, the 
reduction of subsidies for state enterprises that are unable to 
survive, and further steps toward the market economy accompanied 
by the establishment of a social insurance system independent of 
enterprises." These criteria are similar to the conditions 
under which Fedorov would stay in office. 
  In Kinkel's view, the revolutionary process is not yet 
concluded in Russia: "The lava is still flowing." The 
developments have not yet become steady. The balance between 
Yeltsin and now stronger Chernomyrdin, between the president and 
parliament, and between the government and the state duma still 
has to be achieved. Gaydar's resignation has already weakened 
the government's reform punch. Chernomyrdin was obviously also 
trying to force Fedorov into the background; yet Yeltsin knows 
he needs the finance minister. Meanwhile, the positions of 
Gaydar and Fedorov have been strengthened through their 
parliamentary seats. 
  Sources in Bonn expect that the government will be able to 
achieve "majorities on specific issues" in parliament, when 
Gaydar's bloc cooperates with independent and "federative" 
deputies in individual cases. However, visitors from Bonn in 
Moscow, such as Hornhues, the deputy chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag 
group, have noticed an even increasing fragmentation in 
Parliament. Gaydar's group does not "primarily" see itself as 
the government party. In general, it has been noted in Bonn 
that various politicians are even now guided in their behavior 
by their prospects for the 1996 presidential and parliamentary 
election. Chernomyrdin and Gaydar are probably rivals for the 
succession to Yeltsin. 
  Some observers from Bonn have interpreted a movement of 
disassociation from Yeltsin as an indication that changes may be 
possible even before 1996. If Yeltsin were to resign for health 
or other reasons, numerous politicians, public servants, and 
military members from very differing directions would get ready 
to take over. In this respect, Deputy Defense Minister Kronov 
seems to be playing a significant role. He was the last Russian 
officer to leave Afghan territory and he is said not to be too 
distant from the views of nationalist Zhirinovskiy. Some 
observers in Bonn seem to regard it as possible that the forces 
that are standing behind Zhirinovskiy in military circles, and 
certain services are planning to use their popular figurehead 
only until they are able to implement their own ambitions and no 
longer need the charlatan. 
  Kinkel does not indulge in such speculation, but obviously 
does not rule out a development that follows the experience that 
"the revolution devours its children." Stabilizing help by the 
West was, therefore, all the more important, he said. More 
difficult than the conditions in Russia is the situation in 
Ukraine, Kinkel stressed, mentioning catchwords such as 
Sevastopol, the domestic harbor of the Black Sea fleet, 
dependency on Russian energy supplies, and nuclear arms. After 
the Russian-Ukrainian agreement on the scrapping of nuclear 
arms, which was signed in the presence of Bill Clinton, the last 
of those issues seems to have been defused. However, the 
economic situation was disastrous. In the FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE interview, Kinkel suggested that the European Union 
[EU] follow Germany's proposal and devise a "program for the 
economical use of energy." Since many relief programs remained 
ineffective, the EU should make sure its aid is coordinated. 
Kinkel said: "Russia and Ukraine should conclude a treaty on 
neighborly relations, comparable to the one Germany signed with 
Poland and the other Eastern countries." 
  Kinkel drew up a "program for the Baltics." The Baltics are 
"highly sensitive for Russia." The Balts' nervousness is not 
without reason. Yet, Kinkel stressed that he was also convinced 
Russia would withdraw its forces. Nevertheless, for Russia, the 
independence of the Baltic countries is a symbol for its decline 
as an international power. Kinkel announced that in an early 
March meeting in Bonn with the foreign ministers of Estonia, 
Latvia, and Lithuania, he intends to discuss how the three 
countries can be included in European cooperation "as partners 
with equal rights." Kinkel described his initiative in the EU: 
"At the European Council in December, the Brussels Commission 
was given the mandate to conduct negotiations on a free trade 
agreement; I am trying to extend this mandate to facilitate the 
conclusion of a Europe agreement with each of the three Baltic 
states that at least includes the prospects for EU accession." 
The next EU Council of Foreign Ministers should discuss this 
issue in February. 
<H5>  Nervousness in Poland </H5>
  Regarding the countries in East-Central Europe, Kinkel 
noticed that nervousness is most marked in Poland, because of 
Warsaw's unfulfilled wishes toward NATO and the EU. In her 
talks in Bonn on Tuesday, former Polish Prime Minister Suchocka 
expressed her disappointment about the West. The Partnership for 
Peace did not offer any protection. Since NATO failed to agree 
on an "agenda" for Polish membership in, say, 10 years, Poland's 
acceptance into the alliance, including a necessary security 
guarantee for this country, which is a neighbor to Russia. Mrs. 
Suchocka predicted that the stronger and more dangerous Russia 
would become the less NATO would be willing to accept Central- 
East European countries as members out of fear of Moscow's 
reactions. Russia would never become a democracy. The Poles 
were also getting upset with the EU and its protectionism. The 
mood was becoming anti-Western, Suchocka said. 
  In the interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, Kinkel 
described Poland's fears as not justified. The Europe agreement 
with Poland will come into force on 1 February: "Poland is 
being involved in many ways." Poland must understand, however, 
that "the involvement of Russia in cooperation is in the 
interest of the Central-East European countries." Kinkel said: 
"There are two levels. We understand what is moving the peoples 
and governments of the Central-East European countries; however, 
together we must try to come to a rational assessment of the 
situation." The accusation of selfish Western European 
protectionism to the disadvantage of democracy in the East 
cannot be substantiated. Kinkel warned the East Europeans 
against turning their back to the West: "Remain sensible and do 
not overreact!" Kinkel pointed out that the Europe agreement 
with Hungary on free trade and political dialogue, including 
"prospects for membership" would also become effective at the 
beginning of next month. Similar agreements with Bulgaria, 
Romania, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic were signed in 
Brussels last year. The ratification procedures have started; 
interim agreements will be in force until they are concluded. 
Negotiations between the European Union and Russia on a 
partnership agreement have been interrupted as a result of the 
government reshuffle in Moscow. A result should be achieved in 
the course of the year. Negotiations with Ukraine, Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan have started or are being prepared. 
Kinkel concluded: "We are doing everything possible to 
strengthen the network."

  [Text] Paris, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
criticized the United Nations' dismissal of French General Jean 
Cot as UN Yugoslav commander Friday [21 January], as UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived on a private trip. 
  There was "apparently a problem because he is the fourth 
general who has been `worn out' in former Yugoslavia by the 
United Nations system," he said. "This system must be going 
wrong somewhere." 
  Cot's withdrawal, at Butrus-Ghali's request, follows that of 
French general Philippe Morillon and Belgian Francis Briquemont, 
who in various ways criticized the UN's apparent impotence in 
former Yugoslavia. 
  Juppe's comments were echoed by Defence Minister Francois 
Leotard who said there was "a crisis" at the UN, adding that 
France was planning to send the world body a memorandum 
demanding to "determine the conditions of employment of French 
forces" in Bosnia. 
  "If there is not a crisis between France and the UN, there 
is 
a crisis within the UN itself." 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived here late 
Friday for a two-day private visit but diplomatic sources said 
he could meet government officials during his stay. 
  Shortly after arriving from Amsterdam he met Georgian 
President Eduard Shevardnadze who was ending an official visit 
to France and who delayed his departure to meet the UN head.

<F P=106> [Article signed al, rp: "Davos Forum: Amid the Mysteries of </F>
Russian Poliitcs"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Davos, 31 January (ATS) -- For three days, Russian 
policy has held a prominent place in the Davos Forum. Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, former Economy Minister Boris 
Fedorov, Viktor Gerashchenko, president of the central bank, and 
Anatoliy Chubays, deputy prime minister responsible for 
privatizations, clashed through contradictory statements. 
  Speaking to the press on Saturday [29 January], Viktor 
Chernomyrdin forcefully expressed his intention to continue the 
transformation of the economy and Russian society. Questioned 
on his government's monetary policy, the prime minister gave as 
his objective keeping inflation to between 15 and 18 percent 
until September. 
<H5>  Mr. Fedorov's Criticisms </H5>
  Accompanied by two former economics advisers to the Russian 
Government, Boris Fedorov strongly criticized the present 
government's policy on Monday. The former economy minister, who 
resigned on 20 January, predicted the failure of a policy 
consisting of reviving production by a massive injection of 
capital. This measure is fueling inflation and delaying the 
stabilization of the economy, which is the only thing that would 
make development possible. 
  Inflation is prompting both poor and rich to hoard strong 
currencies. The spread of special stores in which you pay in 
foreign currency is prompting the former minister to fear a 
"dangerous polarization of society." He thinks that the 
inflationist policy currently being pursued would increase 
pressure in favor of the reformers. "Boris Yeltsin has 
distanced himself from this government, he has the means of 
changing it when the alarm signals are too strong." 
<H5>  Anatoliy Chubays Is Voting for Fedorov </H5>
  Anatoliy Chubays made a thinly veiled criticism of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin by stating to the press on Monday that Mr. 
Fedorov's resignation could have been avoided. "Being a 
minister in this government, I regret it," he added. The deputy 
prime minister, who is regarded as ultraliberal, said no 
political power could block the privatizations. 
  He clearly advocated a monetarist policy, by defining the 
dangers threatening privatization. "If the economic situation 
remains unstable, investments will be rare, and companies are 
likely to go bankrupt." 
<H5>  Limits for Foreign Banks </H5>
  Finally, Viktor Gerashchenko, president of the Central Bank, 
told AFP on Monday that the activity of foreign banks on Russian 
territory would be limited. "We need to promote our own 
commercial banks." 
  Mr. Gerashchenko said that the money supply plays an 
"insignificant" role in inflation in Russia. "Without a 
government policy of investment, the fight against inflation by 
monetarist means would be ineffective," he added.

  [Text] Russia will not turn back plans to integrate its 
economy in the world economy, but it needs a "therapy" to 
diminish the effects of the "shock therapy" that it has 
undergone following current economic reforms. This statement 
was made by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at a 
press conference in Davos, Switzerland, where he was 
participating in the World Economic Forum. "We want," he added, 
"to become members of the European Union and we want to become 
members of the G-7, turn it into the G-8." The Russian Prime 
Minister, who met in Davos on Sunday [30 January] with OPEC 
Secretary General Dr. Subroto, also said that "we will not 
object if they want to examine the possibility of Russia's 
participation" in the organization of oil exporting countries.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 1 -- A Polish delegation headed by Deputy 
Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Andrzej Kisielewicz has 
conducted talks in the Paris headquarters of the Co-ordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) on the 
possibility to remove Poland from the COCOM lists of countries 
to which exports of strategically important goods are restricted. 
  Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have already been 
removed from the COCOM lists. 
  While featuring in the COCOM lists, Poland cannot buy the 
world's most advanced commodities and technologies that may be 
used for civilian and military purposes. 
  COCOM demanded from the countries concerned to introduce 
legal regulations allowing for a strict control exports of 
strategically important goods and technologies to third 
countries. 
  Poland has launched related legislative procedures but 
failed 
to introduce them in time as required by COCOM as a condition to 
abolish the restrictions. 
  While in Paris the Polish delegation presented the system of 
controls created in Poland and actions envisaged to guarantee 
their efficiency. The system of controls is supervised by the 
Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations and a special department 
of turnover with goods and technologies of strategic importance. 
Its main aim is to control the possible exports of these goods 
to third countries. 
  A French mission has been invited to Poland to convince the 
COCOM authorities about the efficiency of the system. So far 
over a dozen American, German and British missions have visited 
Poland. 
  According to the Polish commercial counsellor in Paris, it 
is 
possible that Poland will disappear from the COCOM lists before 
March 31, which is the deadline for the COCOM existence in its 
present form.

  [Text] Davos, January 29 (BTA) -- Today Bulgarian Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov attended a brinkmanship [as received] 
session where he spoke on the major goals of the Bulgarian 
Government in the period of transition to a market economy, the 
cabinet's Press Office said. 
  The difficulties Bulgaria encounters could be mitigated by 
improving the legal basis, preserving the real-term pensions and 
incomes, and improving the public regulating institutions to 
settle the conflicts between the different social groups, Prime 
Minister Berov said. 
  This country needs a restrictive financial policy to curb 
the 
annual inflation rate, expeditious privatization of the 
state-owned units, and providing markets, notwithstanding the 
defence-oriented foreign policy of the European Union, the 
speaker said. However, the progress is unthinkable without 
preventive actions aimed against all signs of religious and 
ethnic hostility, without holding back the flow of immigrants 
from poorer countries, which pulls the crime rate up and calls 
for a variety of temporary law-enforcement measures, Prof. Berov 
went on to say. 
  Political confrontation should be opposed, private traders 
should be encouraged to turn to production, the private medical 
practice and introduction of health insurance system with 
partial payment of medical treatment should also be promoted, 
and new agricultural laws should be passed to prevent the 
fragmentation of land, the speaker also said. The transition to 
a market economy showed that reforms are painful and will take 
longer than we initially believed, the Bulgarian prime minister 
said. 
  At the session Prof. Berov met Finland's Prime Minister Esko 
Aho who showed deep interest in the progress of the economic 
reforms in Bulgaria. Mr. Aho evaluated in highly positive terms 
the achievements this country has made so far and the policy the 
incumbent government is pursuing. The two heads of state 
discussed the possibilities for establishing active business and 
economic relations between Bulgaria and Finland, the cabinets' 
Press Office said. 
  Later Prime Minister Berov met Swiss head of Federal 
Department of Public Economy Jean-Pascal Delamuraz. The two 
agreed that the bilateral relations are developing actively but 
certain steps should be taken to overcome the decline in the 
commercial exchange. 
  The Bulgarian prime minister met also with Sir Leon Brittan, 
member of the Commission of the European Communities, to discuss 
Bulgaria's joining the European structures. 
  Later in the afternoon Prof. Berov met with outstanding 
representatives of international business circles and briefed 
them on the progress of the economic reforms in this country. 
The Bulgarian head of state touched upon the stumbling blocks 
in the period of transition to a market economy, the actions 
taken to improve the investment climate in this country, the 
major goals of the incumbent government's economic policy, the 
land reform. Bulgaria's policy in the Balkans was one of the key 
issues in the talks, the cabinet's Press Office said.

  [Text] Davos, January 30 (BTA) -- The meetings of 
Bulgarian Prime Minister Lyuben Berov continued here today. 
  He had talks with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. The 
two agreed that the relations between the two countries are 
dynamic and that the cooperation in trade, investments and the 
Black Sea Economic Cooperation should be further promoted. They 
also discussed the situation in the former Yugoslavia and the 
Balkans in general. This spring the Bulgarian foreign minister 
is expected to visit Turkey and Turkish Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller, Bulgaria. President Demirel denied reports in the 
Turkish press alleging that Kurdish terrorist organizations were 
transferring their bases from Germany to Bulgaria. 
  Prof. Berov's meeting with Kazakhstan's President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev expressed a mutual desire for promotion of the 
bilateral contacts. The two arranged a visit of a group of 
Bulgarian businessmen to Kazakhstan. Mr. Nazarbayev proposed 
that a joint bank be set up to facilitate the settlements 
between the two countries. 
  Prime Minister Berov met with Greek First Deputy Minister of 
Economy Y. Papantoniou [name as received] to consider measures 
for upgrading the road and railway links between the two 
countries. They also discussed the Bulgarian transport 
minister's forthcoming visit to Greece. 
  Mr. Jacques de Larosiere, president of the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, handed Prof. Berov a list of the 
Bulgarian projects approved by the bank for financing. Mr. 
Larosiere briefed the Bulgarian prime minister on the bank's new 
short-term loan policy. 
  The Bulgarian prime minister also met with Jean-Claude Paye, 
secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development. The two discussed the priorities in the 
development of the Bulgarian-G-24 ralations.

  [Text] Vienna Feb 1 (CTK) -- Hans Meyer, a spokesman for 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), today confirmed 
to CTK that Cesium 137 was generally available on international 
markets and can be legally purchased. He said this radioactive 
material cannot in any case be used for the construction of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Trade in cesium is monitored due to a high danger of 
radiation, Meyer said at the IAEA's Vienna headquarters. He 
said Cesium 137 is used for medical purposes and reliable firms 
purchase the material legally, thus obtaining necessary data 
about the intensity of radiation. The material is therefore not 
suitable for smuggling, Meyer said. 
  He said he could imagine illegal trade in cesium only in 
case 
of lay people who want to enrich themselves very quickly and who 
apparently have no idea about the danger. He said that a layer 
of water of seven to eight metres was enough to absorb all the 
radiation, provided the cover of such a delivery is not 
destroyed. 
  If suppositions that Cesium 137 was being carried in the 
small Czech Cessna plane that is believed to have crashed into 
Lake Constance eight days ago are confirmed, Swiss authorities 
are prepared to immediately expand investigation eastward. 
However, experts considered the hypothesis that 70 kilogrammes 
of Cesium 137 are lying at the bottom of the lake to be very 
unlikely. The hypothesis was voiced today by the Austrian Press 
Agency (APA), citing Swiss sources. 
  The Cessna was flying from Prague with five people on board. 
  Although a busy but "non-transparent" trade in radioactive 
materials is going on in Switzerland, no substances that could 
be used for the construction of nuclear bombs have been 
discovered thus far, Roland Hauenstein, spokesman for a 
Prosecutor's Office in Bern, said. 
  Swiss experts considered the possibility that 70 kilogrammes 
of Cesium 137 were carried in the plane to be practically out of 
the question. They said that without special protection, a 
person in such close proximity to these materials would receive 
a fatal dose within seconds. The pilot could not have survived 
the trip from Prague to Lake Constance which is located on the 
German-Swiss border, they said. The transportation would have 
been possible only with a strong protective layer which would 
have weighed several tonnes, which that type of plane was not 
capable of carrying, they said. If any radioactive material was 
carried on board the plane it would have been only several 
grammes rather than kilogrammes. 
  Hans Eggenberger, spokesman for the police in St. Gallen, 
who 
are investigating the airplane's disappearance, said that the 
rumours that the plane did not crash into the lake but landed 
somewhere outside the reach of radar were "very unlikely." He 
said that although it was possible for the plane to fly at a low 
altitude and thus avoid to be seen on radar in Zurich, the 
weather at that time made such a flight impossible. That is why 
Swiss authorities continue to believe that the plane crashed 
into the lake.

Powers. Last Attempt To Improve Offers Before Marrakesh"; as 
released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Geneva, 31 January (ATS) -- The world commercial 
powers of the Group of Four (United States, European Union, 
Canada, and Japan) held a meeting in Geneva on Monday [31 
January] in order to prepare for the signing of the Uruguay 
Round trade agreements in Marrakesh (Morocco) in April. These 
agreements were concluded among 117 states in Geneva last 
December. The Americans still hope to persuade Japan to improve 
its offer of market access. 
  The United States thinks that the negotiations with Japan on 
market access are not over. The Japanese, on the other hand, 
retort that the discussions on this subject are closed. 
Washington expects from Tokyo a larger reduction in customs 
duties on certain products (timber, copper, and alcohol), 
according to a diplomatic source. 
<H5>  "Balanced Context" </H5>
  "If we can improve market access with Japan, we will do so, 
but this must be done in a balanced context," Hugo Paemen, 
European Union deputy director general of foreign economic 
relations, said. 
  "An improvement is still possible," Mr. Paemen said. 
However, the issues so far discussed are essentially marginal. 
"We will not reopen the negotiations," the European official 
stressed, adding that it was impossible to go back on what had 
been achieved. The Europeans think they have completed their 
negotiations with everybody. 
  A meeting of experts from the four commercial powers will be 
held on Tuesday with the aim of putting clearly down on paper 
the lists of tariff offers. The Group of Four is due to meet in 
around 10 days for a final verification of the offers. This 
meeting will take place shortly before 15 February, the deadline 
set by the GATT secretariat for the submission of the final 
lists.

<F P=106> [Deborah Hargreaves article: "Move To Mend Banana Split"] </F>
  [Text] The European Commission is believed to be 
considering a plan that would end its row with Latin American 
countries over access to the $2.7bn European banana market which 
might be put before a committee meeting of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade today. 
  It would not be the first solution proposed to end this 
arcane dispute which has cast a shadow over relations between 
the European Union and Latin American producers for more than 
two years. 
  Tempers in the EU [European Union] rarely run as high as 
they 
do over bananas. The complex row, founded in the EU's 
obligation, under the Lome preferential trade convention, to 
import bananas from former colonies of Britain and France, has 
set commissioners against each other and opened divisions 
between member countries. Germany has made its own complaint to 
the European Court. 
  Many member countries are critical of the Commission's 
handling of the dispute but have been unable to hammer out a 
policy which has their majority backing. 
  At the same time, a rift has developed between the group of 
Latin American producers over their response to proposals put by 
the Commission last year. 
  At a meeting in Guatemala on Friday [28 January], the group 
of five Latin American producers along with Ecuador and Mexico 
failed to reached agreement on ending the stalemate but will 
meet again in Panama on Saturday. 
  Earlier this month the Latin Americans rejected proposals 
put 
by the Commission to allow them a ceiling of 2.1m tonnes of 
banana imports to the EU this year, breaking down into 
individual country quotas. These would also be subject to tariff 
payments. 
  The Commission had put great pressure on the producers to 
accept its plan -- a ceiling of 2m tonnes was imposed last July. 
But producers have complained to GATT about the EU banana regime 
and a condition of accepting the improved ceiling was that they 
drop that complaint. 
  One of the ways the Commission brought pressure to bear on 
producers was to threaten to withdraw the offer if the Latin 
Americans had not accepted it by the time GATT issued its report 
on the banana regime. However, the Commission has since extended 
its deadline for agreement to February 11 which is when the GATT 
report will be circulated to all members. 
  The Commission is believed to be looking at improving the 
latest offer by slightly increasing the overall import ceiling 
and removing individual country quotas for those that are 
unhappy with them. Those countries -- in particular Guatemala, 
which objected strongly to the previous plan -- would then 
compete with each other for import access within the overall 
ceiling. 
  However, the idea of the ceiling still irks the Latin 
Americans when, in fact, there is strong demand for their 
bananas in Europe. "It's a contradiction: they want us to open 
up to free trade under GATT on the one hand, but accept 
restrictions on certain products like bananas," said a central 
American ambassador. 
  The African, Caribbean and Pacific [ACP] countries covered 
by 
the Lome convention claim their economies would be devastated if 
they had to compete freely for EU banana business. 
  Production costs in the ACP countries are much higher than 
in 
Latin America where fruit is also of a uniformly high quality. 
"Logic dictates that the central Americans which grow the best 
bananas at the cheapest price should be able to provide the best 
deal for the EU consumer, but since when has logic ever dictated 
EU agriculture policy?" said Mr John Wakeley, food and drink 
analyst at Lehman Brothers. 
  Latin American producers have been supplying up to 2.3m 
tonnes of the 3.6m-tonne EU banana market in the past couple of 
years. These so-called dollar bananas can still be sold more 
cheaply than those from ACP countries even after payment of 
tariffs since production costs can be a third lower on the more 
highly mechanised plantations in central America. 
  In a rush to secure market share Latin American producers 
last year flooded the EU market with fruit. This led to a slump 
in prices. 
  The market has been further confused by Germany's complaint 
to the European Court calling for a free market for bananas. The 
Germans even suggested at a GATT meeting last week that the EU's 
Lome commitments on bananas be abandoned altogether. In the 
meantime, observers suggest that German banana distributors are 
ignoring the EU rules and continuing to import freely. This 
could be happening to a lesser extent in the Netherlands, 
Denmark and Belgium. 
  Banana distributors such as Geest, which has warned it would 
make a loss for last year, bemoan the political squabbles which 
have cast a shadow over the market. "I think it's almost 
unprecedented in any sphere where government and industry bump 
against each other," said Ms Clare Wenner, external affairs 
director at Geest. "It makes it extremely difficult to know how 
to plan for the long term." 
  The GATT report on the EU's banana regime has not yet been 
made public but is understood to criticise the Lome arrangements 
as not in keeping with its free trade rules. This is, however, a 
moral rather than a practical victory for Latin American 
producers as the report will almost certainly not be adopted by 
GATT -- any member can block the majority needed to adopt the 
report. 
  The EU could now be forced to apply for an exemption to GATT 
rules specifically for Lome. There is even a narrow chance that 
problems over bananas could hold up the signing of the Uruguay 
Round accord as they delayed the signing of the Treaty of Rome 
that created the European Community in 1957.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/63: "Commission Backs Customs </F>
Corridor as Part of Transit Package for Balkans"] 
  [Text] The European Commission has decided to back the 
creation of a Balkan customs corridor as part of a wider 
initiative and could commit over ECU100 million through its 
PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] 
program in 1994 to help improve transit to and from Balkan 
states most affected by the UN sanctions against Serbia and 
Montenegro. The Commission's initiative is to be formally 
unveiled at the CSCE conference taking place in Vienna today and 
tomorrow. 
  The Commission's Balkans initiative falls into four 
parts: 

  -  Support for the Balkans customs corridor; 
  -  A series 
of short-term actions to address the most serious bottlenecks in 
the Balkans; 
  -  A medium-term plan to focus European Union 
investment on a number of "multi-modal" corridors identified by 
Balkan states themselves as alternatives to the trans-Yugoslav 
route; 
  -  Channeling further funds from the PHARE program into the 
construction of roads, ferry connections, customs posts and 
other needs identified by those Balkan states suffering most 
from the sanctions. 
<H5>  Balkan Customs Corridor </H5>
  Civil war in the former Yugoslavia has caused severe delays 
and loss of trade resulting from the closure of road, rail and 
other traffic routes. 
  The Commission believes that the establishment of a corridor 
passing through adjacent countries will greatly alleviate 
congestion if customs procedures are streamlined sufficiently. 
Furthermore, suitable technical assistance should enable such a 
corridor to be in place by this summer. 
  The Commission will therefore urge the Vienna conference, 
due 
to discuss ways of helping those countries suffering from the 
sanctions, to consider the following proposals. The Commission 
believes that if followed, these proposals would ensure that 
trucks are delayed at borders for no more than one hour: 
Certain border posts should be reserved only for transit 
traffic carrying valid clearance documents (the TIR 
[international road transportation] carnet), enabling them to 
avoid normal traffic queues at customs. At other posts, where 
sufficient space is available, special "fast lanes" should then 
be created for those holding the TIR documents. Furthermore, 
two corridors should be assigned -- between Austria and 
Greece/Turkey, and between Albania, Romania, Bulgaria and 
Ukraine -- and priority border posts will be nominated by the 
countries concerned. Valid TIR carnets could only be obtained, 
and the transit operation ended, at inland customs houses. 
<H5>  Tackling the Most Serious Bottlenecks - Short Term </H5>
  Through the PHARE program, which channels over ECU1 billion 
of assistance every year to promote market economies in Central 
and East Europe, the Commission will identify the main transit 
bottlenecks and short-term projects for possible financing by 
PHARE. A plan for dealing with them will be submitted to the 
G-24 transport group for discussion in mid-April. 
<H5>  Planning for the Medium and Long Term </H5>
  The Commission is participating in the "pan-European 
indicative plan for transport infrastructure development," 
through which the Balkan states have identified a series of 
multi-modal corridors toreplace the trans-Yugoslav route. This 
will be presented to European transport ministers in Crete on 
March 14. The plan is intended to guide governments and 
international financial institutions in the way they invest in 
infrastructure in East Europe, helping them to avoid overlap 
between such investments. 
  PHARE is also preparing a study on the best site for a new 
bridge across the Danube between Bulgaria and Romania, although 
disagreements persist between those countries. In addition, 
PHARE will ensure that short-term transport projects tie in with 
longer- term priorities. 
<H5>  Channeling Further Funds from PHARE </H5>
  Over the next four months, the Commission, through the PHARE 
program, will discuss with the countries worst affected by the 
UN sanctions additional ways of alleviating their most pressing 
transport problems. 
  The following are examples of projects which will either 
move 
into action this year or will be budgeted in 1994 for action 
later: 

  -  Development of a ferry terminal in Calafat, 
Romania; 
  -  Upgrading customs procedures between Romania and 
Hungary at Nagylak/Nadlac; 
  -  Cofinancing with the EIB [European 
Investment Bank], the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development] and the IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development] of the rehabilitation of roads in Romania; 
  -  The 
upgrading of the road from Vidin to Sofia; and the upgrading of 
the road from Tirana to Dures and Rogozhine. 
<H5>  Overall Funding </H5>
  Around ECU100 million could be made available through the 
PHARE budget to improve transit to and from the Balkans, 
provided the beneficiary countries give transport the urgency it 
requires when they draw up their own priorities for PHARE 
spending. Much of this funding is part of long-term programs 
which fit into a coherent overall framework and will provide 
long-term benefits to the countries concerned as well as 
alleviating the current bottlenecks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Address of Eduard Selami in the </F>
Plenary Session of the Assembly of the Council of Europe"] 
  [Text] Tirana, January 27 (ATA) -- During the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe, Eduard Selami, chairman of 
the Albanian parliamentary delegation, took also the floor in 
the discussion held about the effects of the embargo on the 
neighbouring countries with Serbia and Montenegro. 
  Mr. Selami pointed out the losses of the Albanian economy 
caused by the sanctions imposed on former Yugoslavia, which 
amount to [words indistinct] electric power, bitumen, etc. Also 
the only railway line which links Albania with Europe has been 
closed, creating great difficulties in the transport of 
commodities. In these conditions, Mr. Selami demanded that the 
international community and the European Community must help 
Albania to compensate the losses caused by the embargo. Mr. 
Selami suggested that compensation should cover material 
assistance for the population mostly affected by the embargo and 
creation of facilitations for the customs and transport. 
  Although Albania is experiencing the economic consequences 
of 
the embargo, Mr. Selami said, it is seriously committed to 
observe it. We are against the lifting of the embargo against 
Serbia and Montenegro unless a peaceful solution is found in 
former Yugoslavia. The lifting of the embargo, Mr. Selami said, 
would be a favour for the aggressor and another chance for 
greater difficulties in the efforts to resolve the conflict in 
Bosnia and prevent its expansion in Kosova and broader. If the 
international community is willing to prevent the further 
expansion of the conflict and to learn from the mistakes in 
Bosnia, it should condition the lifting of the embargo with the 
correct resolving of the conflict.

Revision of Maastricht's `Convergence Criteria'"; as released by 
Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] Speaking before the EP's [European Parliament] 
Economic, Monetary and Industrial Policy Committee, Council 
President Constantin Simitis did not rule out a revision of 
Maastricht's "Convergence Criteria" and spoke in favor of an 
active industrial policy. He first set out the priorities of 
Greece's Council Presidency, in conformity with the programs 
already analyzed by EUROPE and stressing the importance of an 
in-depth debate in all member states on the guidelines of the 
White Paper by the European Commission. It is then that, 
answering questions from MEPs [member of European Parliament], 
he took the aforementioned stances. Here is what he had to say, 
according to the report put out by Parliament: 
  (1) Convergence criteria. Asked by Mr. Fourcans (France) 
about a possible revision, Mr. Simitis said that there was no 
revision procedure going on, but these criteria are being 
discussed and "some have already said that they were possibly 
excessive and that they aimed at a goal which would have as 
consequence limiting economic activity (...). The Community 
institutions must follow the debate, hear the criticisms and in 
their actions include the results of the discussion" so as to be 
able, should it prove necessary, to revise their position; 
  (2) Industrial policy. According to Mr. Simitis, such a 
policy is "necessary as we cannot simply count on the market 
mechanisms. The role of the Community is not simply to be an 
observer, it has to intervene and set out the guidelines." Over 
restructuring the steel industry, he confirmed that the private 
sector would meet the Commission in February and should then 
announce commitments to closures.

<F P=106> [John Carvel report: "Brussels `Trying To Gag MEPs'"] </F>
  [Text] The fourth revision of the impending council of 
ministers' resolution on how best to protect official secrets in 
Brussels makes good a surprising omission from the previous 
three attempts. 
  Senior officials have decided to introduce a top secret 
classification to cover material whose unauthorised disclosure 
would have "exceptionally serious consequences" for the 
essential interests of the European Union [EU]. 
  They had already established the need for classifications of 
secret (for information whose leakage would have "serious 
consequences"), confidential (where disclosure would be 
"detrimental") and restricted (where publication would be 
"inappropriate or premature"). 
  Tony Bunyan, director of Statewatch, an organisation which 
monitors conduct by officialdom affecting civil liberties in the 
EU, said yesterday: "It is fair enough for them to classify 
operational details, say about efforts to combat terrorism. But 
ministers appear to be making no distinction between operations 
and policy. 
  "The confidential and restricted categories by definition 
cover information whose disclosure would not have serious 
consequences for the EU. They are questionable because they can 
be used to deny national parliaments and MEPs information about 
policy which they ought to be debating." 
  The council documents provide a fascinating insight into 
security procedures in an institution which previously did not 
have secrets worth stealing. 
  Article 6 says: "Where a number of items of information 
constitute a whole, that whole shall be classified at least as 
highly as its most highly classified constituent item. 
  "Where appropriate, however, a body of information may be 
classified more highly than any of its constituent items." 
  Article 7 says: "Access to and the keeping of classified 
information... shall be authorised only for officials and other 
servants granted clearance therefore who in addition require to 
know or receive such information for the performance of their 
duties... Only persons who have undergone security screening may 
be granted clearance." 
  Article 8 says: "The purpose of security screening shall be 
to ascertain that an official or other servant provides the 
necessary guarantees to be allowed access to classified 
information... security screening shall be carried out by and 
under the responsibility of the member state of which the person 
concerned is a national. 
  "If that person is not a national of a member state the 
member state within whose territory he has his domicile or 
normal residence shall be responsible for screening." 
  Officials needing vetting will have to explain periods of 
residence of more than six weeks outside the EU during the last 
10 years. The required personal data extends to information 
about a spouse's siblings and other people living in the 
official's household. 
  The draft council decision on security classification is 
accompanied by a draft on how it should be implemented by the 
secretary-general. 
  "A Classified Information Office shall be set up within 
general coordination.... It shall be reponsible for: the 
processing of classified information, in particular operations 
relating to its registration, reproduction, translation, 
communication, dispatch, preservation and destruction," the 
paper says. 
  The rules extend to the strength of furniture in which 
secret 
documents can be stored. They conclude with a warning to 
officials that failure to comply shall expose them to 
"disciplinary measures and, if appropriate, criminal 
proceedings." 
  This is puzzling, since it is not clear in which court an EU 
civil servant could be tried for an offence against the Union.

January], Foreign Minister Claes confirmed to the press that he 
is to sue the newspaper HET LAATSTE NIEUWS for libel. The HET 
LAATSTE NIEUWS Saturday issue incriminated Claes over an alleged 
FrB15 billion bribe deal with the Italian aeronautic company 
Agusta. HET LAATSTE NIEUWS based its allegations on an 
"anonymous witness close to the SP [Flemish Socialist Party]." 
Minister Claes said that he was ready to confront this witness 
at anytime, adding that "it was the only way to prove my 
innocence." 
  During a 90-minute news conference, Minister Claes also 
described in details the role he played as economic affairs 
minister in negotiating, signing, and controlling the purchase 
contract of the 46 Agusta helicopters. "I have nothing to 
reproach myself neither as regards the procedure itself or the 
content. My administration, my government colleagues and I 
myself defended the interests of the Belgian State," said 
Minister Claes, who believes that the Agusta affair remains a 
case of alleged compensation....

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Belgian Government Concerned -- </F>
Bujumbura Shutdown"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels/Bujumbura, 31 Jan (BELGA) -- The Belgian 
Government is "concerned" by the present political situation in 
Burundi and declares that "everything must be done to allow the 
Burundian Government to restore order and peace and for the 
political deadlock to be relieved," a communique from the 
Belgian Foreign Ministry announced on Monday [31 January]. 
  The expression of this Belgian concern comes after the 
announcement on Saturday of the "resignation" of the 
Constitutional Court following an earlier announcement -- ten 
days ago -- of the cancellation "until a later date" of the 
investiture ceremony for the new Burundian President Cyprien 
Ntaryamira, observers report. 
  Problems continue to beset Burundi where a "ghost town day" 
action was observed in the capital Bujumbura on Monday with all 
shops and offices remaining closed, a number of concordant 
sources confirmed. Three members of the Tutsi ethnic group were 
also apparently killed on Monday by other civilians when a coach 
was attacked on the road between Mware (in the center of the 
country) and Bujumbura, the same sources report. 
  Five members of the now resigned Constitutional Court -- 
including its president Mr. Gerard Nyungeko -- also protested on 
Monday in a joint communique signed by the parties concerned and 
received in Brussels, in which they condemn the "illegal nature 
of this measure" which they consider to be "null and void." 
They claim this is due to "abnormalities of form" and 
"pretexts." 
  The communique signatories state that the joint dismissal of 
certain members of the Court was solely motivated by the desire 
to "avoid at all costs the remaining danger of the Court 
declaring the presidential election of 13 January last as 
invalid." 
  In any event, the Belgian Government has restated its 
support 
for the government of the prime minister, Sylvie Kinigi, and 
elected President Ntaryamira, and calls upon "all forces in the 
Burundian nation to cooperate in the national reconciliation." 
  Belgium had supported the process of democratization which 
resulted in free elections and the founding of democratic 
institutions, recalls the communique from the Belgian Foreign 
Ministry.

<F P=106> [Article signed MPK/RHR: "At Least 80 Dead in Incidents in </F>
Bujumbura According to Ambassador"; as released by Brussels 
BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 1 Feb (BELGA) -- The fresh outburst of 
violence in Bujumbura has claimed something like 80 deaths over 
the last 24 hours, claimed Burundian Ambassador Jean 
Ngendanganya in Brussels on Tuesday afternoon [1 February], 
before inviting Belgium and the European Union to increase and 
improve its humanitarian aid to the Burundian population. 
  On Tuesday morning there were at least three casualties, and 
houses were once again set on fire in the Burundian capital, but 
the Army and Gendarmerie are not interceding, added the 
ambassador, speaking at a news conference given in Brussels. It 
should be remembered that the Army consists primarily of members 
of the Tutsi ethnic minority. 
  "We are asking Belgium and the European Union to increase 
their aid to Burundi, and to improve its distribution, so as to 
ensure that it reaches those for whom it is intended. A large 
proportion of this aid is actually being hijacked," reiterated 
the ambassador. 
  The interethnic confrontations have been provoked by a new 
power struggle between the government of Mrs. Sylvie Kinigi and 
the extremist opposition, following the removal from office on 
Saturday by the minister of justice of five of the seven members 
of the Constitutional Court, which has to rule on whether or not 
the choice of Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira to succeed Mr. Ndadaye is 
constitutional. The dismissed magistrates are all Tutsis. 
  The members of the Constitutional Court were ready to 
invalidate the election of Mr. Ntaryamira, explained the 
ambassador. However, the current atmosphere of violence has 
rendered it impossible to hold a new presidential election. It 
is for this reason that the Parliament (the majority of whose 
members are Hutus -- BELGA editor's note) elected Mr. Cyprien 
Ntaryamira as the new president of Burundi on 20 January in an 
emergency procedure. This choice represented a consensus 
between all the political forces, for 78 out of the 79 deputies 
present had come out in favor of the election of Mr. Ntaryamira, 
and it is inadmissible that his appointment now be called into 
question, added the ambassador. 
  The assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, 
during a coup d'etat by the Tutsi-dominated Army last October, 
had provoked an outbreak of violence between the Hutus and 
Tutsis, resulting in several tens of thousands of deaths and 
creating hundreds of thousands of refugees.

Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development. 
  The job of running the "club" of 24 industrialised nations 
falls vacant in September when Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the present 
secretary-general, completes his second five-year term of 
office. Mr Paye, a former French diplomat, is again a candidate 
for the job, as is Mr Donald Johnston, a Canadian Liberal 
politician. 
  British Government officials said yesterday that Lord Lawson 
was ideally qualified, pointing out that he was a strong 
supporter of international economic co-operation when 
chancellor. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Letter from Douglas Hurd, secretary of state for foreign </F>
and Commonwealth affairs: "Hurd Replies to Pergau Dam Critics"] 
  [Text] Sir, You made sweeping allegations of illegality 
over the Pergau hydroelectric project in your editorial of 
January 19, headed "Dam deceit." In your editorial of January 
28, "Alms and arms," you no longer do this. But the new ground 
of attack is just as flawed. 
  The Foreign Affairs Committee soon will review expenditure 
on 
Pergau and our Aid and Trade Provision [ATP]. I do not, 
therefore, intend to go into the details here. The Prime 
Minister and I have already made clear our position in the House 
of Commons. But to correct the latest suggestions: 
  1. The formal offer of ATP support for Pergau was made in 
April 1989, not as you suggest only a month after the Memorandum 
of Understanding on Defence Procurement was signed in September 
1988. The companies' application was first lodged in November 
1988. The final decision was taken in February 1991. 
  2. Pergau is only one of 23 development projects in Malaysia 
which we have supported with ATP since the scheme was introduced 
by the Labour Government in 1977. 
  3. ATP has not been used at any stage for projects in 
Malaysia covered by the 1988 memorandum. 
  The Malaysian Government regard the Pergau project as 
important for their country's economic development and the 
diversification of its energy resources. Our aid has helped to 
build a relationship which has brought benefits to both 
countries. These have included a large increase in British 
exports -- one of the acknowledged objectives of the Aid and 
Trade Provision. Our exports to Malaysia rose to almost 900 
million pounds last year, nearly three times the 1988 figure. 
  On the separate issue of the defence relationship, we have 
long been partners of Malaysia in the Five Power Defence 
Arrangements. It is right that we have been and continue to be 
ready to help Malaysia to acquire the equipment which it needs 
for its armed forces. None of this has been done under the aid 
programme. 
  I find extraordinary the argument that Britain is wrong to 
pursue defence sales overseas within the rules which we have 
laid down. Developed and developing countries alike should have 
the right to buy the equipment which they need for their defence 
or for peacekeeping, provided that national and international 
laws are observed. Malaysia is a friendly and peaceable 
Commonwealth country. Exports made a big contribution to the 
success of Britain's defence industry. 
  You suggest that our decision on Pergau threatens Britain's 
reputation for plain dealing. That is nonsense. ATP is a 
recognised form of aid, covered by OECD guidelines to which we 
adhere. If we had failed to honour our commitment to the Pergau 
project, then indeed our reputation for plain dealing would have 
suffered--and British interests with it. 
  Yours faithfully, 
  DOUGLAS HURD, 
  Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London SW1. 
  January 29.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China and the GATT"] </F>
  [Text] Napoleon once advised the world to let the Chinese 
giant sleep since "when he wakes he will move the world." By 
now it is too late. The question for the world is how to 
respond to the quake. On balance the best choice is to 
facilitate rapid market-oriented development of the Chinese 
economy. One implication is that China should be accepted into 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, on strict economic 
conditions. 
  There is no denying, however, that China presents problems. 
The country has three inhabitants for every two in West Europe, 
North America and Japan combined. Its economic growth ran at 
over nine per cent a year between 1980 and 1991 and could 
continue at such a rate for decades. It also brings together a 
powerful comparative advantage in labour intensive manufactures 
and easy access to capital and skills. On the minus side, its 
economy continues to be distorted by the legacy of planning and 
controls. 
  Last but not least, China is a corrupt despotism. The notion 
of China as an economic colossus under anything like the present 
regime is bound to cause concern. But rapid export-oriented 
industrialisation is likely to create strong pressures for 
political change in China, as it has in other east Asian 
countries. This is why the West should focus its attention on 
sustaining market- oriented reforms. China's application to 
join (or, as it would argue, rejoin) the GATT presents an 
opportunity for achieving just that. 
<H5>  Urgency </H5>
  The GATT's working party on China's membership was 
established in 1988. But the Tiananmen Square massacre and the 
Uruguay Round put these discussions largely on hold. Now a 
degree of urgency has been injected into the negotiations, 
partly because this is an important piece of unfinished business 
and partly because China is ensured of becoming a founding 
member of the prospective world trade organisation only if the 
negotiations on GATT accession are completed this year. 
Otherwise there would have to be new negotiations over China's 
accession to the WTO [World Trade Organization]. 
  China would like GATT entry on standard conditions, 
consisting of tariff concessions alone. Other GATT contracting 
parties want special provisions, including a selective 
safeguards clause, a special procedure for review of the reforms 
and greater transparency in the policy regime. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. is making the grant of most favoured 
nation [MFN] treatment, itself the most fundamental GATT 
principle, hostage to improvements in human rights. 
Technically, it would be possible to combine GATT membership 
with such bilateral conditions. But they would render membership 
largely meaningless, since the U.S. would not be in a secure 
contractual relationship with China. 
<H5>  Economic dialogue </H5>
  There are good reasons, however, for the U.S. to modify its 
approach. Withdrawal of MFN treatment would be economically 
damaging to the U.S. itself. It would also harm the economic 
dialogue begun by President Clinton at the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Seattle last November. Bilateral 
pressures designed to corner Beijing and force concessions have 
been shown not to be the most effective way to secure political 
change in China. GATT, by contrast, offers a less tense but 
still powerful multilateral framework for improving China's 
economic policies in a more market-oriented direction. 
  China's membership of the GATT should therefore be accepted, 
but subject to a safeguards regime that could be modulated to 
the state of economic reform. This would bring China into what 
is expected to become one of the most important bodies in the 
global economy, as befits the country's size and potential. 
  Some will argue that China cannot be a GATT member in good 
standing, because it would be politically impossible to offer 
equal treatment to imports from so large a non-market economy. 
That is an argument not against accession, but in favour of 
conditional accession. 
  The West cannot ignore gross violations of human rights in 
its relations with China, or any other country. But its trade 
relations should focus on the policies that affect trade. If 
trade and economic issues move in the right direction, the 
politics will follow.

<F P=106> [Reports by Michael Cassell in Belfast and Patrick Harverson </F>
in New York: "Government Rejects Adams Call for Ulster Peace 
Deal Clarification"] 
  [Text] The British Government last night rejected demands 
in New York by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, for 
clarification on the Anglo-Irish joint declaration and for 
negotiations on a political settlement in Northern Ireland. 
  In an interview at Stormont Castle, Belfast, yesterday, Sir 
Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, restated the British 
Government's refusal to embrace Sinn Fein in the search for a 
political solution until the IRA ended violence permanently. 
  With ministers acutely aware that Sinn Fein has scored 
another propaganda victory in Mr Adams' U.S. visit, Sir 
Patrick's uncompromising position was endorsed by Mr John Major, 
the prime minister, in the Commons. In New York, Mr Douglas 
Hurd, Foreign Secretary, said Mr Adams' remarks had been 
characterised by "ambiguity and evasion." 
  The U.S. administration also moved quickly to emphasise that 
its decision to admit Mr Adams on a 48-hour visa did not reflect 
policy differences with the British government over Northern 
Ireland. 
  President Bill Clinton, rejecting calls for more U.S. 
pressure on Britain, said at a press conference: "Let's be 
fair. The people that have to resolve this are the Irish and 
the British." He described the peace initiative taken by Mr 
Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, as 
"astonishing" and said Mr Adams should back it. 
  Sir Patrick dismissed Mr Adams' renewed calls for 
clarification as delaying tactics. 
  After a briefing to members of the congressional committee 
on 
Irish affairs, Mr Adams said he was anxious to find a proposal 
to put to the IRA to end its conflict. "The ball is firmly in 
the British court," he said. Mr Adams repeated his calls for 
British government action when he addressed the national 
committee on American foreign policy. 
  But Sir Patrick, who said it was "a pity" that Mr Adams had 
been given a platform in the U.S., insisted that it was Sinn 
Fein which had "the key" to a peaceful solution. He said: "The 
only rational choice for a organisation that has a political 
objective is to accede to the declaration, end violence and make 
it clear that you have ended violence, and then make use of what 
has been offered, Sinn Fein has the key. The key is their 
ability to give up violence." 
  Referring to the Sinn Fein president's recent letter to Mr 
Major, Sir Patrick said that it "did not seek any clarification 
or explanation of any specific matter at all. It is entirely 
clear that what he wants is a renegotiation of the declaration." 
  He claimed that Mr Adams' continuing refusal to be specific 
meant that there was no "genuine request for enlightenment and 
the most likely candidate for an alternative explanation is the 
desire to play for time." 
  Mr Adams, in calling on the government for talks on the 
mechanics of a negotiated settlement, said: "Mr Major has talked 
of a first step in the peace process. What is the second step 
and the third step?" He said peace would be difficult to 
establish but prospects were better than ever before.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Have a Nice Day, Mr Adams"] </F>
  [Text] The British Government was foolish to object to the 
Americans granting a visa to Gerry Adams. In the first place, 
it was unrealistic. Anyone in Washington could have told 
Downing Street that if Bill Clinton were forced to choose 
between pleasing the British or winning congressional support 
for his health care reforms, he would not hesitate for a second. 
The tattered remains of the special relationship had no chance 
against congressional pressure for the visa. Britain would, 
therefore, have been wiser to accept the inevitable instead of 
inviting a public rebuff. 
  Better still, it could have positively encouraged Mr Adams's 
trip to New York. Among the incentives he is being offered for 
winning IRA endorsement of the Anglo-Irish declaration is the 
prospect of entering mainstream politics. There is every sign 
that this attracts him. New York will give him a taste of what 
is on offer if he can earn respectability. 
  It is also possible that he will benefit from contact with 
responsible Irish-Americans, most of whom have endorsed the 
declaration. The Ancient Order of Hibernians in the U.S. sent a 
strong message of support to both governments in December, and 
Senator Edward Kennedy's sister, who is the American ambassador 
to Dublin, will certainly have reported home in detail on the 
Irish Government's attitude. American opinion should therefore 
be well in touch with reality, and not likely to mistake Mr 
Adams for the voice of all Ireland. 
  The only strong reason for denying him a visa would have 
been 
fear that he would spend his time whipping up support and funds 
for the IRA. Not only is he forbidden to do this under the 
terms of his visa, but he also has no good reason for attempting 
it. He still wishes to be seen by the British Government as 
doing his best for peace, and in the US he can only gain from 
appearing statesmanlike. 
  It is always a problem when dealing with terrorist 
organisations and their supporters to know when to allow them 
out of isolation. The main test is a pragmatic one: will doing 
so enhance the chances of peace? In the case of Mr Adams, the 
British Government has already decided to accept him as an 
interlocutor on the understanding that his value depends on how 
much he delivers. 
  While awaiting the answer, there is every reason for 
encouraging him with graduated concessions such as the New York 
trip. He will be under no illusions that if he fails to deliver 
he will be quickly back in the political ghetto. In the 
meantime, he will have a chance to clarify his position and show 
how he conducts himself on a wider stage.

<F P=106> [Joe Rogaly article: "Let the Arguing Begin"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to grant a 
visa to Mr Gerry Adams is unhelpful. At the worst it might 
destabilise the Anglo-Irish strategy for managing the conflict 
in Northern Ireland. I say "managing the conflict" rather than 
"peace initiative" because it is prudent to keep the small print 
pessimistic. 
  The overall strategy remains in place. It was worked out 
last year by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds. The 
declaration by the British and Irish prime ministers, published 
shortly before Christmas, gives Irish nationalists an 
opportunity to win by peaceful persuasion the unity for their 
island that 25 years of bloodshed have shown cannot be achieved 
by violence. The terrorists among them are, reasonably enough, 
asked to cease hostilities before they can take part in 
negotiations. The strength of the joint declaration lies in the 
fact that it puts the two governments on the same side. They 
have not yet wavered on its central tenets. So far so good. 
  Enter Mr Clinton. This is a relatively small matter for him. 
He has no dead to count, only votes. He is, however, an 
intelligent man. So on Saturday [29 January] morning the U.S. 
position was the same as that of Mr Major and Mr Reynolds: Mr 
Adams must renounce violence and accept the joint declaration 
before a visa is granted. The latter, a master of blarney, let 
his words travel far enough in the required direction without 
his meaning moving an inch. That enabled the president of the 
U.S. to cast aside his brain, redeem a campaign promise and 
appease a powerful Irish lobby. Mr Clinton capitulated on 
Saturday evening. 
  The dispute clearly dived the Irish-American community. The 
visa was stamped in the US embassy in Dublin. The ambassador 
there is Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of Senator Edward Kennedy. 
This was victory for both Teddy and Senator Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan over a third formidable Irish-American, Mr Tom Foley. 
The speaker of the lower house was armed with arguments 
provided by the British ambassador to Washington, Sir Robin 
Renwick. For once the Renwick magic was insufficient. Perhaps 
it never had a chance. The case against dealing in the open 
with Mr Adams has been harder to make to Americans since Messrs 
Reynolds and Major promised that, after a ceasefire, they would 
do just that. After being barred for 20 years, the leader of 
Sinn Fein set off for New York. Mr Clinton presumably felt that 
the senators, who face re-election this year, had greater need 
of his assistance than the speaker. 
  The U.S. is clearly not constitutionally equipped to play 
the 
game in the stonewall manner implied by the Reynolds-Major 
statement. Its centres of political influence are too diffuse. 
You cannot always say who will come out on top in a particular 
argument. This is a pity. A unified stance by the British, 
Irish and U.S. administrations might have led even the IRA to 
reflect that it was hopelessly isolated. The question that the 
prime minister now has to ask himself is which is the odd 
country out? Mr Reynolds is still on board as his recent 
scholarly exposition of the democratic nature of peaceful 
self-determination confirms, but his government did unilaterally 
remove the ban on radio and TV appearances by Mr Adams and his 
ilk. It might have done better to wait for a joint relaxation 
of media rules by both London and Dublin. The Irish also appear 
to have taken quiet satisfaction in the granting of a visa to 
the Sinn Fein leader. Is it Britain that needs to make a course 
correction? 
  The answer depends in the first instance upon how you 
perceive Mr Adams. The president of Sinn Fein is customarily 
depicted as a front-man for the IRA. His party is usually 
described as the bombers' political wing. The British view is 
that he is too steeped in blood to be qualified to take part in 
the democratic process until there is an IRA ceasefire and he 
renounces the "armed struggle." The Irish and American view 
appears to be a softer version of this, namely that Sinn Fein 
has to be drawn into the peace process, since both it and the 
IRA are split. The more exposure that can be given to supposed 
doves like Mr Adams, the more likely it is that they will 
prevail. 
  It would be easier to accept this proposition if there was 
any evidence in support of it. There is none. We are invited 
to take the word of Mr John Hume, the Social Democratic and 
Labour party member of Parliament whose work for a peaceful 
settlement has been admired by all. Mr Hume is an honourable 
man, devoted and brave in his pursuit of an end to the killing. 
We do not know what Mr Adams says behind closed doors, but to 
judge by his public statements he has not condemned IRA 
violence, let alone pressed for a ceasefire. Mr Hume has begged 
the IRA to suspend the slaughter while they and Sinn Fein debate 
the Reynolds-Major declaration. He may have been encouraged to 
so by his private conversations with Mr Adams but the latter has 
yet to be seen deploying even the most basic argument for peace 
such as that unity can only be gained through the ballot box 
minus bullets. Perhaps Senators Kennedy and Moynihan will 
prevail upon him to do so while he is in New York. 
  The British view is that the Major-Reynolds declaration will 
slowly achieve its desired end, which is a cessation of 
violence. The Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew has 
avoided negotiation with Mr Adams while doing his best to 
maintain the moral and rational high ground. Sir Patrick will 
not "clarify" in the sense of altering the original meaning of 
the declaration but he will make its intent ciear. This war of 
words may continue for some time. Britain might as well lift 
the ban on the broadcasting of the voices of Mr Adams and his 
colleagues, since their words, spoken by actors, are not 
challengeable by live interviewers. 
  The principal response to the granting of a U.S. visa to Mr 
Adams should be a review of British public relations. This is 
an area in which London's expertise is at least matched by Sinn 
Fein, in Belfast, Dublin and New York. Mr Adams plainly cannot 
be silenced. Attempts to muzzle him have increasingly become 
counterproductive. There is no call from Dublin or Washington to 
negotiate with Sinn Fein, at least not until it calls for a 
ceasefire. The Major- Reynolds strategy for managing the 
violence therefore dictates itself. Mr Adams must be out-argued.

<F P=106> [Susan Watts report: "Staff Fear Budget Cuts Will Ground </F>
`Snoopy' Aircraft"] 
  [Text] The future of "Snoopy," an RAF [Royal Air Force] 
Hercules adapted to form an airborne laboratory, looks 
increasingly uncertain as defence budget cuts bite deep. 
  The C130 aircraft, named Snoopy because of its 22-foot red 
and white striped nosepiece, is guaranteed funding only until 1 
April 1995, despite world-wide acclaim for its atmospheric 
research. Its scientific crew fear Snoopy will be grounded 
beyond that date. 
  Defence chiefs are expected to rubberstamp the funding 
decision at a budget meeting on Wednesday [2 February]. Snoopy 
will at least have a breathing space -- its crew had braced 
itself for news that the money would run out this Easter. 
  The aircraft, based at Farnborough, Hampshire, is owned and 
run as one of the Ministry of Defence's 59-strong RAF Hercules 
fleet. The Meteorological Office [Met Office] pays for Snoopy's 
technical crew and equipment at a cost of around 800,000 pounds 
a year. 
  Met Office staff take part in numerous international 
research 
projects, and it pays its contribution to costs in Swiss francs. 
The fall in the value of the pound at the end of 1992 left the 
Met Office overdrawn on its budget by several million pounds -- 
hence the squeeze on Snoopy. Its future could only be 
guaranteed if currency fluctuations swing the other way. 
  An RAF spokesman conceded that Snoopy was under review, but 
no more or less than any other asset as part of a broad 
assessment of all defence-related projects. "To say Snoopy 
faces the axe would be to anticipate the outcome of that 
review," he added. 
  The aircraft came to public attention after a trip to the 
Gulf during which it flew through the thick, black smoke plumes 
of the Kuwaiti oil fires -- analysing the level of pollutants to 
help predict their health threat. 
  By "sniffing" the air with its extended snout, Snoopy has 
helped to improve weather forecasting and long-term computer 
models of climate change. John Pyle, one of Britain's experts 
on the ozone hole and chairman of the UK Stratospheric Ozone 
Review Group, said the loss "would be a tragedy for atmospheric 
science in this country." 
  In a few weeks' time a scientific paper in the journal 
NATURE, produced using data gathered in Snoopy, is expected to 
help explain why forecasts of global warming have proved wide of 
the mark -- one of the most baffling questions facing 
atmospheric science. Snoopy's research suggests a second group 
of man-made pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, is slowing 
down the warming effect of artificial greenhouse gases. 
  Many eminent scientists, from the UK and overseas, have 
written to the Met Office, protesting at Snoopy's threatened 
demise. A team from the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric 
Research in Boulder, Colorado, recently visited the Farnborough 
group for advice on fitting out a joint U.S./German Hercules for 
atmospheric research. 
  Snoopy flies two or three times a week, clocking up about 
500 
hours a year. It is booked up for years ahead by research teams 
from all over the world. In October, Snoopy is due to be the 
only aircraft taking part in a simulated major nuclear accident. 
A few kilograms of a chemical compound called perfluorocarbon 
will be released high over Brittany and its spread around Europe 
monitored.

  [Text] Beledweyne (DPA) -- The German Blue Helmets 
officially ended their humanitarian aid mission in Somalia 
today. In Nuurfanax, around 70 km southeast of Beledweyne, the 
final task of General Klaus Naumann, the Bundeswehr general 
chief of staff, was to hand over the largest German project to 
date: A dam and a straightened river bed, which after the rains 
is to hold water for irrigating some 5,000 hectares of land. 
  The highest ranking German soldier thanked the unit for the 
humanitarian assistance they had provided. In response to the 
request from indigenous clan leaders and elders that the Germans 
remain in Beledweyne, Naumann said the political decision had 
already been made concerning the final return of the over 1,400 
German UN soldiers by 31 March. Colonel Holger Kammerhoff, the 
commander of the Somalia support unit, said the Germans were 
leaving behind a sign of hope with their aid projects. 
  According to a report drawn up by the unit, the over 3,000 
soldiers and officers deployed in Somalia over the past eight 
months have distributed more than 3.2 million liters of water, 
drilled seven wells, repaired three bridges, and put three dams 
in working order. In addition, seven schools and an orphanage 
for over 120 children were built. The Germans also gave 
outpatient and hospital treatment to over 15,300 Somalis and 
operated on 480 victims of the civil war. 
  The costs of the humanitarian operation total around 3.5 
million German marks [DM]. According to estimates, which have 
not been confirmed by the Bundeswehr, total costs for the Somali 
operation are between DM350 and 500 million.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- According to IG Metall 
[metal workers' trade union], more than 107,000 employees in 482 
companies had participated in the warning strikes in the west 
German metal industry by midday Tuesday [1 February]. According 
to the Frankfurt headquarters of the trade union, more metal 
workers have been called upon to participate in rallies in the 
afternoon, for instance in the Hesse towns of Giessen and 
Kassel, as well as in Kempten in Bavaria. 
  The focus of the activities was North Rhine-Westphalia, 
where, according to IG Metall, about 57,000 workers from 351 
companies went on strike for one to three hours. At a total of 
eight rallies --- in Dueren, Hattingen, Siegburg, and 
Luedenscheid, among other places -- the metal workers protested 
the employers' wage policy. 
  The trade union counted about 20,000 participants in various 
protest rallies in Lower Saxony. In Bavaria, which was the 
focus of the protests yesterday, more than 13,000 metal workers 
participated in warning strikes. In Baden-Wuerttemberg 9,000 
employees from 14 companies went on strike for up to four hours. 
Further protest actions took place in Hesse, 
Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, and Berlin.

  [Text] Bonn -- According to an agreement between the 
Transportion and the Defense Ministry, civilian and military air 
traffic control services will be working under the same roof in 
the future. Thus, a further step will be implemented within the 
framework of the structural reform of air traffic control, which 
was initiated in 1993 to privatize its legal organization. On 
Tuesday [1 February], the Defense Ministry announced that 340 
air traffic control officers and air data processors will be 
given leave from the Bundeswehr to start work as employees of 
the state-run Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH (DFS) [German Air 
Control]. In the long term, it is intended to provide some 500 
soldiers. 
  The Bundeswehr members are to cooperate as one working team. 
According to the Defense Ministry, their work will focus on the 
control and support of military operational air transport to do 
justice to the defense assignment of the armed forces. Outside 
the responsibility of the DFS, Bundeswehr personnel will control 
the airspace beyond an altitude of 7,500 meters at the 
Eurocontrol headquarters in Maastricht. The merger of the 
German air control services is intended to improve the 
organization, flexibility, and efficiency to keep up with the 
future development of air transport in Europe.

  [Text] The prime minister has called upon the global 
business community to make investments in the infrastructural 
development of India in view of the success of the economic 
reforms ushered in by his government. Addressing the India 
special session of the World Economic Forum at Davos in 
Switzerland last night, Mr. Narasimha Rao said there is a 
national consensus in the country with regard to the reforms and 
what is needed now is development of the power, transport, 
communication, and road network for the next phase of 
liberalization. He assured them of safe and good returns and 
reiterated his government's commitment to remove all obstacles. 
He told the business community that laws, wherever needed, will 
be modified to protect the interests of all concerned and the 
bureaucratic controls will not be allowed to come in the way. A 
select gathering of about 300 noted chief executive officers of 
corporations, academicians, journalists and intellectuals 
participated in the India session. 
  The commerce minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, chaired the 
session. The finance secretary, Mr. Montague Singh Aluwalia, and 
the chairman of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, Mr. A.N. 
Verma, attended. Our correspondent S. Sudharshanam reports from 
Davos that, replying to questions at the India session, the 
prime minister dispelled doubts of foreign investors about the 
liberalization program of the Indian economy and assured them 
that the process is irreversible. He told them liberalization is 
a deliberate attempt and choice to globalize the Indian economy. 
He said his government is politically stable to carry forward 
these reforms. 
  Earlier, the commerce minister apprised the business 
community of the health of the Indian economy and the results 
achieved after the introduction of economic reforms two years 
ago. Expressing similar sentiments in his address at the 
closing symposium of the World Economic Forum, the prime 
minister cautioned against internationalization of transborder 
export of terrorism, clandestine encouragement of religious 
fundamentalism, and local issues. He said these would result in 
anarchy and total cessation of developmental effort of many 
developing countries. Mr. Narasimha Rao also warned the world 
community against linking the transfer of technology to 
extraneous, unreasonable, unwarranted conditionalities, and said 
these are threatening the basic fabric of many developing 
countries. He said internationalization of local issue, low 
cost proxy wars, and recourse to blackmail of various kinds are 
on the rise, and thus anarchy and total cessation of 
developmental efforts stare many developing countries in the 
face. The prime minister made it clear that India will not 
accept conditionalities in developing peaceful technology. 
  The prime minister called for a cooperative global effort to 
fight poverty and widespread illiteracy. He expressed the hope 
that a literate world can be ensured in the first quarter of the 
coming century and called for determined efforts to achieve the 
result. Expressing concern over religious fanaticism and hatred, 
Mr. Rao said that challenge is to create and strengthen the 
desire for a better life in society.

  [Excerpts] An annual meeting of the World Trade Forum has 
started in Davos. Approximately 800 businessmen and politicians 
from over 80 countries all over the world are taking part in 
this politico-economic summit. A three-day visit will be 
divided into three topics. The participants will first assess 
the situation in the international economy at the beginning of 
1994 and establish the priority spheres of action. 
  A Slovene delegation, led by Prime Minister Dr. Janez 
Drnovsek is also attending the Word Trade Forum. Suzana Kos 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Kos] [passage omitted] Slovene Prime 
Minister Janez Drnovsek, who is attending the World Economic 
Forum in Davos this year, too, and will meet with important 
financiers and politicians here, held talks with the GATT 
director general this morning: 
  [Drnovsek] With Mr. Sutherland we have had a very thorough 
debate about all issues that are still open in the negotiations 
between Slovenia and GATT. We have established that, recently 
the negotiations have been continuing successfully and 
intensively, that some open issues remain, especially regarding 
the protection of agriculture and the service industry, but that 
there are realistic chances for the resolution of these 
problems. Despite a tight schedule, Slovenia could still become 
one of the founding members of GATT, on the condition that this 
organization be formed, that is to say, starts working at the 
beginning of 1995. 
  [Kos] As Dr. Drnovsek also said, the talks also concerned 
Slovenia's latest proposal for the new system of protection in 
agriculture. Mr. Sutherland promised his assistance here so 
that the answer to our proposal would be such that Slovenia 
could accept. 
  This afternoon, the Slovene prime minister will also talk 
with the new president of the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development, which has promised us assistance in 
reconstruction and the development of our infrastructure. [end

  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Feb 1 -- The EC plan to cut 
overcapacity in its ailing steel industry has been blocked by 
the failure of companies to come up with voluntary reductions, 
Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert said Tuesday [1 
February]. 
  Van Miert said at the World Economic Forum that 
non-state-aided companies had been counted on to volunteer some 
10.5 million tonnes in capacity cuts out of the 30 million 
targeted. 
  But no offers have so far been received and Van Miert 
expressed pessimism whether any would be forthcoming. "We 
cannot meet the objectives laid down in the Braun report" on 
restructuring the industry, he said.

  [Text] Vienna -- According to Foreign Minister Alois Mock, 
Austria continues to consistently advocate a just and lasting 
peace settlement in the Balkans. Mock stressed this on Monday 
[31 January] in talking to the newly appointed ambassador of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to Austria, Hadzo Efendic, who paid his first 
visit to the foreign minister. Efendic is the first ambassador 
of his country accredited to Austria. 
  Mock stated that there is certainly no guarantee for a 
speedy 
peace. However, as the development has shown, deviating from 
the aforementioned principles would not bring a solution closer 
in any way.

<F P=106> [Report signed "ett": "Policy Toward Foreigners: New FPOe </F>
Advance"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Yesterday, Tuesday, exactly one year 
after the petition for a referendum on foreigners, the Freedom 
Party of Austria [FPOe] gave the starting signal for a new 
action regarding the policy toward foreigners. Since the main 
demands of the petition for a referendum called "Austria First" 
have not been fulfilled by the government, the initiative 
"Austria First II" is now being prepared. At a news conference, 
FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider announced that the FPOe will focus on 
the policy toward foreigners in its Nationalrat election 
campaign. 
  A catalogue of demands is being developed by a working group 
(with Secretary General Herbert Scheibner, security spokeswoman 
Helene Partik-Pable, and Vienna City Councillor Hilmar Kabas). 
Central points are: 

  -  A stop to immigration, which is 
indispensable; 
  -  Measures, above all for the reduction of the 
number of guest workers who have only been in Austria for a 
short time; 
  -  The imperative deportation of foreigners who have 
come into conflict with the law; 
  -  Strict punishments for the 
employment of illegal employees. 
  If the government is not prepared to establish order, this 
will be a subject of political discussion before the Nationalrat 
election, Haider announced. The petition for a referendum will 
not be repeated: "We do not need it," Haider said because the 
Nationalrat election provides the opportunity for secret votes 
anyway. There the people can take revenge for the government's 
"policy of announcements." The new FPOe initiative regarding 
the policy toward foreigners is necessary because the government 
apparently has "not learned anything" from the debate on the 
petition for a referendum, the FPOe chairman said. 
  According to Haider, the number of cases where foreigners 
who 
have come into conflict with the law but are not deported are 
increasing. Also the public has been "deceived" by the 
statement that foreigners pay more social security contributions 
than they get. According to the Social Ministry, except for 
contributions to unemployment insurance, the collected amounts 
cannot be separated. Partik-Pable criticized: The number of 
"illegal foreigners" continues to increase. 
  The FPOe announcements triggered a wave of indignant 
reactions: "Incredible agitation against foreigners" (Willi 
Fuhrmann, floor leader of the Social Democratic Party of Austria 
-- SPOe). SPOe Executive Secretary Josef Cap talked of a hidden 
petition for a referendum on foreigners. Haider is not prepared 
to learn from his mistakes, Austrian People's Party [OeVP] 
Secretary General Ingrid Korosec criticized; for OeVP security 
spokesman Hubert Pirker, Haider is "an ignorant who does not 
listen to reason."

  [Text] In January 1994 the unemployment rate in Austria 
reached 4.3 percent according to the seasonally adjusted OECD 
calculation, which corresponds to the value of December 1993. 
According to the unadjusted traditional Austrian calculation 
method, the Austrian unemployment rate was 8.7 percent. 
  At the end of January, 285,782 unemployed were registered at 
the labor exchange offices, which is 4 percent more than during 
the same month last year. 
  Compared with other OECD states, Austria (4.3 percent) 
occupies third place, following Luxembourg (1.9 percent) and 
Japan (2.8 percent). OECD unemployment (in October 1993) 
amounted to 7.9 percent.

<F P=106> [Gerhard Hertenberger report: "BMW Invests Billions"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- The BMW automobile corporation will 
invest 3.4 billion schillings (financed from cash flow) in the 
fourth expansion phase of its engine works in Steyr, Austria, by 
the end of 1996. In 1993, 1.3 billion schillings were spent; 
this year 1 billion is planned. It is expected that about 15 
percent of subsidies, which correspond to European Union 
regulations, will be paid. So far, BMW has invested 13.5 
billion schillings in Austria. In 1995-96 an additional 300 jobs 
will be created in Steyr on top of the existing 2,000, said 
Werner Saemann, chairman of the board of directors of BMW 
Austria. 
  Last year the turnover of the BMW group in Austria declined 
by 15 percent from 18.2 to 15.5 billion schillings. Still, 
Saemann said that the result is "very satisfying," but it is 
below the 1.6-billion-schilling gross revenues of 1992. 
  In Steyr, 331,200 (in 1992 -- 379,000) engines with a 
17-percent proportion of diesel engines were produced. Domestic 
creation of value is given at about 20 percent. Turnover from 
exports amounted to 11.7 billion schillings (in 1992 13.8 
billion). The entire purchasing volume of the BMW corporation 
in Austria amounted to 14.7 billion schillings in 1993 (in 1992 
17 billion). Saemann does not rule out future deliveries of BMW 
diesel engines from Steyr to Rover. 
  With 8,848 passenger cars and 515 motorcycles (3.3 billion 
schillings turnover), automotive sales declined by 25.8 percent 
and sales of two-wheeled vehicles declined by 6 percent. This 
year 10,000 cars and 850 motorcycles are to be sold in new 
models (manager Clary: "A normal year for BMW").

  [Text] The Hague -- In compliance with UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's request, the Netherlands will provide the next 
peacekeeping force chief of staff for Bosnia. The post will 
fall vacant on 1 March. 
  Yesterday evening, Defense Minister Ter Beek told the Second 
Chamber that the decision to appoint a Dutch officer was 
justified because the Netherlands has never refused to provide 
troops for UN operations. There are now about 3,000 Dutch 
soldiers in former Yugoslavia. 
  The Dutch officer, whose name was not divulged on the 
grounds 
that he currently resides abroad, will be responsible for 
coordinating the troops together with General Rose. This 
includes, among other things, negotiating with the commanders of 
the warring parties in the area.

<F P=106> [Report by Wio Joustra: "Netherlands Troops Receive Ground </F>
Support"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hague -- The Netherlands troops opposing the 
warring factions in eastern Bosnia do not have to rely solely on 
limited air support, but can also rely on the support of ground 
troops from other countries such as the United Kingdom and 
France. According to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, the 
international community must show that it is serious about 
Bosnia. [passage omitted] 
  This afternoon in the Lower House, Defense Minister Ter Beek 
will argue on the basis of Butrus-Ghali's letter that the launch 
of air strikes to neutralize Serbian artillery positions around 
Srebenica and Zepa is not on the agenda. 
  Asked for his reaction to the letter, Ter Beek said through 
a 
spokesman on Monday [31 January] that attacking Serbian 
positions would be too great a risk for UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force] units already present in Bosnia. Various groups have 
argued this point in previous debates. Limited air support will 
only be used when resistance is such that the battalion's 
ability to carry out its mission is jeopardized or if it needs 
to defend itself.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Euro-Lubbers Must Wait Longer for </F>
Praise"] 
  [Text] Since Saturday [30 Saturday], Ruud Lubbers is no 
longer the leader of the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]. The 
idea takes some getting used to, but in a few months he will 
have disappeared from the national political arena. The 
decision on the presidency of the European Commission is coming 
increasingly closer. In any case, there were enough, even open, 
allusions to Lubbers' ambitions in Brussels at the CDA congress 
in Rotterdam. 
  Former Belgian Prime Minister Leo Tindemans, nicknamed 
Mister 
Europe, pressntly a member of the European Parliament, nicknamed 
Mister Europe, and one of the three guest speakers, said that he 
had to hold himself back from already trumpeting praise about 
Lubbers. "It is too early for that," he said. 
  Tindemans sincerely hopes that his political friend Lubbers 
will succeed French Socialist Jacques Delors, even if this is 
merely to prevent his compatriot Wilfried Martens from gaining 
the post. Martens swept aside Tindemans as Belgian prime 
minister 15 years ago, and the two Flemish Christian Democrats 
have been at odds ever since. 
  Former Foreign Minister Hans Van den Broek, now a "mere" 
member of the European Commission, also referred to Lubbers' 
European aspirations. Turning to the new CDA leader, Elco 
Brinkman, he said: "Either I myself, or Ruud, or Hanja Maij (the 
CDA's top candidate at the European elections--DE VOLKSKRANT 
editor's note) will make sure that you bear the interests of 
Europe in mind." 
  Incidentally, this is no superfluous luxury, because, to put 
it mildly, foreign policy is not exactly Brinkman's strong 
point. Nonetheless, it is a remarkable comment on the part of 
Van den Broek, who will have to make way if Lubbers does indeed 
become president of the European Commission. The most suitable 
alternative for Van den Broek would appear to be European Union 
[EU] ambassador to Washington, succeeding Dries van Agt. 
  Lubbers, who was sitting in the front row, listened to the 
whole thing with a smile, but did not say anything. Last year 
he denied he was a candidate, but that does not mean anything: 
One does not stand as a candidate for a post as high as that; 
rather, one is called to office. That old adage of British 
statesman Oliver Cromwell applies to Lubbers: "He who does not 
know where to go, comes first." 
  At the European summit, due to be held in five months' time 
on the Greek island of Corfu, the EU leaders will decide who 
will succeed Delors. Until then, speculation will remain rife, 
and the outgoing prime minister will remain stubbornly silent. 
However, in the meantime, there are indications that he has 
firm ambitions in Brussels. 
  For instance, the word in diplomatic circles in The Hague is 
that Lubbers recently refused to back the possible candidacy of 
Van den Broek at NATO. Nor is any pressure being exerted by The 
Hague on the allies to extend the term of office of former VVD 
[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] Minister Wim van 
Eekelen as secretary general of the WEU [Western European 
Union]. After all, one top international job is more than 
enough for a small country like the Netherlands.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Snub by Washington"] </F>
  [Text] The British Government's Northern Ireland strategy 
has not been advanced by the decision of the American 
Administration to grant the Sinn Fein president, Mr Gerry Adams, 
a visa to attend a conference in New York. Dublin and London, 
presenting a united front, are seeking to induce Sinn Fein to 
attend all-party talks. The carrot is to be implicit 
acknowledgement of Sinn Fein's legitimacy. The stick is the 
implicit threat to Sinn Fein of a permanent future in outer 
darkness, if the party and its IRA terrorist arm refuse to 
renounce violence. For weeks now, Mr Adams has been 
prevaricating over a decision on whether Sinn Fein will accept 
the terms for talks; meanwhile IRA violence has continued. It 
remains highly uncertain whether, in the end, the terrorists 
will come to the conference table. 
  Yet, even while the outcome is in suspense, the Washington 
Administration has accorded Sinn Fein's president a visa. The 
American Government was never in any doubt that the British were 
strongly opposed to such a concession at this stage. It is 
difficult, therefore, not to interpret Washington's action as a 
snub to the British Government, at a time when Anglo-American 
relations are already poor -- as Anne Applebaum argues on this 
page. Many Americans, along with British opponents of the 
Downing Street Declaration, argue that since the Westminster 
Government has shown its willingness to traffic with IRA 
spokesmen, the American Government can scarcely be blamed for 
granting Sinn Fein's leader temporary house-room. But the 
consequence, in any event, is to give some comfort to Sinn Fein, 
while emphasizing the current divide between Westminster and 
Washington. 
  The British Government is left to try to divine some 
possible 
benefit from Mr Adams's trip. It is plain that labyrinthine 
discussions are taking place within the IRA about the Downing 
Street Declaration and the case for joining talks. Sinn Fein's 
leader continues to profess his own desire to "bring an end to 
the IRA and take the gun out of Irish politics." Optimists 
suggest that his American visit might strengthen his hand within 
his own movement, to win the argument for laying down arms. It 
will be important to watch both how Mr Adams conducts himself in 
the United States, and how the American Government and the 
Irish-American lobby handle him. The hope must be that they will 
encourage him towards the conference table, if only to gain some 
political kudos for doing so. 
  We, like the British Government, would have much preferred 
that Washington had not granted Mr Adams his visa; and that the 
United States should have made common cause with Dublin and 
Westminster in maintaining pressure on Sinn Fein unless or until 
the IRA declares an unconditional cease-fire. The Clinton 
Administration's fumbles and stumbles in foreign policy make it 
difficult to regard any American initiative over Ireland with 
enthusiasm. But the decision to admit Gerry Adams sends a more 
significant signal about the current state of Anglo-American 
relations than about the prospects for the Northern Irish peace 
process.

  [Text] The Italian Republican Party is on the verge of a 
split. A section of the party wants to remain with the 
Democratic Alliance [AD] and is criticizing the decision of 
[Giorgio] La Malfa to take the party toward the position of 
[Mino] Martinazzoli [Italian Popular Party secretary] and 
[Mario] Segni [Pact for Italy leader]. Guido Dell'Acquila 
reports: 
  [Dell'Acquila] The four-leaf clover of the AD and the ivy 
leaf of La Malfa do not thrive in the same kind of soil. La 
Malfa's decision yesterday to join Segni and Martinazzoli split 
the party in two and was also greeted negatively by the AD--the 
organization to which some notable Republicans continue to 
belong. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Do you 
consider anyone who joins the left-wing slate to be outside the 
Republican Party? 
  [La Malfa] Of course, if the Republicans join a certain 
slate, then whoever joins another slate, or campaigns for 
another slate, is obviously travelling down a different road. 
[end recording] 
  [Dell'Acquila] Even if Bruno Visentini is keeping quiet for 
the time being, Giorgio Bogi is not. He is part of the AD, and 
he wants to remain there. 
  [Begin Bogi recording] I understand perfectly well that 
standing on the same slate as opponents is not a reconcilable 
antagonism. However, in this particular case, we will continue 
to be part of the AD as Republicans. [end recording] 
  [Dell'Acquila] Giuseppe Ayala, the notable independent 
deputy, is also abandoning La Malfa. 
  [Begin Ayala recording] I am one of the founders of AD. I 
have always believed in the organization, I continue to believe 
in the organization and I will always believe in the 
organization. I am sorry that the Republican Party is no longer 
involved, or at least not all of the party. Let us see how many 
republicans remain, in my opinion there will be many. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Giorgio Battistini report: "Del Turco Takes Sides; New </F>
Socialist Party Rejects Intini"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "Today sees the birth of the new Socialist 
Party," [Italian Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Ottaviano Del 
Turco announced to the constituent assembly of the PSI at which 
the Carnation crossed over to the Rose [old and new party 
symbols]. Now it is possible: "Heads up." Italian Socialists 
are rediscovering the left. As in the rest of the world, they 
are aligning with the progressive forces, against the 
conservative forces, from [Italian Popular Party (PPI) 
Secretary] Martinazzoli to [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi. 
There was an atmosphere of euphoria at this new beginning. 
Having set aside the much-brandished Italian flag, the lost 
International has returned, and tears were shed at the 
appropriate moment. Moreover, there was a blessing from 
[Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto, whose 
arrival drew loud applause right at the start of Del Turco's 
speech. It prompted the angry departure of Ugo Intini, amid a 
chorus of catcalls. But that is another story. 
  The old PSI and the new stood side by side in a hall at 
Rome's exhibition center. There were at least 7,000 people 
there, divided into regional battalions. In the front row on 
the stage some representatives of the nomenclature made a 
reappearance. There was no longer a presidium platform, for 
several reasons -- in order to avert impossible attempts at 
diplomacy and to mark a sharp break with the past. In any case, 
it was only an official christening. The congress takes place in 
May. Del Turco sat waiting in the audience. On the stage a 
plain table was provided for Gino Giugni and Enrico Boselli. 
Panseca no longer featured at this exciting working-class 
"opening night." It was an occasion for old friends to renew 
their acquaintance and for acknowledging old affinities. There 
was something of all this (a return to humanism; nobody now 
would take the old diktats seriously) with, in addition, some 
judicious asperity in Del Turco's remarks to his men. The 
battle is won, but the internal war goes on. This is why the 
name "Craxi" was never mentioned, and neither was the word 
"Tangentopoli" [Bribesville]. 
  Break with the past -- He was hoping for the "spontaneous 
departure" of the investigatees that had "compromised" the 
party. However, there was no such "spontaneous generosity." Now 
there is "no turning back. Our path diverges from those who 
refuse to identify with the new symbol" (already approved by the 
Socialist International), "and who presume to dictate 
conditions." It is an "irreversible option" [no opening quotes 
as published] for a renewal that is "clear, open, and evident. 
Woe betide us if we hesitate. We will not allow ourselves to 
be intimidated." This was set against the defeated apparatus 
(who were also absent -- Craxi, Martelli, De Michelis, Ando, 
Conte). It was to them perhaps that Del Turco was referring 
when he said that it is "difficult to show affection and 
gratitude to those who think only of doing us harm." Intini was 
there, however, next to Alma Cappiello. 
  Catcalls for Intini -- Almost heroically (he was suffering 
from a high fever), Gino Giugni had just finished recalling the 
"destructive moral pollution" of the old leadership group, when 
a chorus of catcalls came from the back of the hall. "Out, 
traitor, throw him out." Everyone looked toward the second row, 
where Ugo Intini -- having been wrested away from his 
appearances on any and every television channel -- was speaking. 
Craxi's former spokesman fell silent and sat down, with a 
grimace. He got up suddenly to leave when he saw Occhetto come 
in. It was like a historical revenge, 10 years after Verona and 
the catcalls reserved for Berlinguer. A few hours later he 
issued this exaggerated accusation: "Occhetto ordered Giugni 
and Del Turco to expel the independent socialists as a 
precondition for belated admission to the left-wing negotiating 
table." 
  PCI [Italian Communist Party], Berlusconi, [Northern League 
Secretary] Bossi -- The new PSI has reversed Craxi's affinities. 
It dismissed Forza Italia -- it is right-wing -- and also the 
"preaching of egoism of Bossi and Fini." Del Turco silenced one 
lady senator who perceived in Berlusconi "the advent of the 
alignment for freedoms." What did she mean? "The freedom not 
to pay taxes, to expel all colored people from our country, to 
hand over to private enterprise all that functions and is 
efficient. What does all this have to do with the history of 
socialism?" He cited "the pictures emerging from Arcore" [where 
Berlusconi lives] with the following "clear language: Let the 
poor take care of themselves; the prosperous will survive." 
  PSI and the left -- Meanwhile, there must be "equal status" 
for all. With the AD [Democratic Alliance] "the prospects are 
increasingly substantial" thanks to "common roots"; and the same 
goes for the "Christian-Social" group (Carniti was in the 
audience). There is no obligation to engage in controversy with 
the PDS, and there must be mutual autonomy. If possible, a 
joint battle must be waged; otherwise, there must be separate 
lists in order to avert "humiliating compromises." This was a 
tribute to the delegates' wounded sense of patriotism. But 
relations are good. Everything is fine with the Greens, less so 
with Communist Renaissance. Bertinotti (formerly of the Lombardo 
faction) received the tribute of a verse which Pasolini 
dedicated to [founder of PSI] Nenni: "Struggle without victories 
brings aridity." As for Rete, "I have nothing to say to [Rete 
Secretary] Leoluca Orlando," who is seeking a "grim, 
disputatious, and counterreformist left." But if it is his 
ideas that guide the progressive forces, "we will opt for 
freedom of action." 
  PSI and the center -- "Esteem and respect for Martinazzoli," 
less so for [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, who "propounds the 
theory of indifference to alliances." After the elections there 
must be a constituent period. "Let it not be believed that all 
this can be achieved by means of an agreement between the major 
forces above the heads of the minority forces." 
  The curtain fell, to the strains of Elsor's March. In the 
front row, Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri listened and applauded. 
He was Craxi's shadow during his years of glory. So is 
everything fine now, too? He pondered. He asked a reporter to 
hand him his notebook, and wrote: "No embarrassment. The option 
taken is consistent with my own political and personal career. 
There are times when you have to opt for ideas rather than 
individuals."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Rome RAI Due Television Network in 
Italian at 2045 GMT on 31 January carries 37-minute interview 
with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the Democratic Party of the 
Left [PDS], by RAI television director Gianni Minoli, on the 
program "Mixer." 
  On a possible government coalition with Mino Martinazzoli's 
Italian Popular Party, Occhetto says: "I think our aim should be 
two broad groupings, the right and the left. The newly formed 
Progressive Alliance [the left coalition] must win and have the 
majority. We cannot make the usual center-left mess, albeit a 
cleaner one." He adds: "I think in this election campaign, we 
have very clearly slammed the door in his face [Mino 
Martinazzoli's]." 
  On the problems of keeping the left's broad coalition 
together, Occhetto says: "The thing is that the various forces 
of the left -- each one with its own characteristics -- are 
trying to unite and confront the risk of a new and an old right. 
This is something important: getting together to win the great 
match for the government of this country." 
  On the diverging economic strategies within the coalition of 
the left, which includes the hardliners of Fausto Bertinotti's 
Communist Renewal Party, he says: "We set off from different 
positions, but I must say that, after frank discussions, our 
opinions are now more alike. This, I think, is what a real 
dialogue within the left should lead to. As for those points on 
which there is no agreement, we shall tell the Italians which 
ones they are before the elections." Asked whether the presence 
of Fausto Bertinotti, the leader of Communist Renewal Party, in 
the coalition may be a problem, Occhetto says: "No problem at 
all." 
  On the scheduled and later postponed meeting with NATO's 
secretary general, Occhetto says: "Unfortunately he is very ill. 
We shall meet another time." He adds: "I wanted to tell him 
that we must all react to the situation in Bosnia. We can no 
longer go on like this. We must intervene. We must also 
strengthen all the world's ruling bodies to settle disputes and 
tackle tragic issues, such as drugs and north-south relations." 
  On his meeting with the U.S. ambassador in Italy, he says: 
"It was a very pleasant and interesting meeting. He wanted to 
know our opinions on the economy." He adds: "I think I 
reassured him very much on one point: that we want to change and 
renew, but we want to continue the restructuring program started 
by Ciampi." 
  Answering another question on the different people within 
the 
coalition of the left, Occhetto says: "Have you ever seen the 
American Democratic Party? There are very strange Trotskyites 
and crazy reformists within it. What about the Labor Party in 
England? Everywhere in modern Europe the left is very varied." 
He adds: "The day after tomorrow we shall publish the election 
program, not the government program, and you will find that on 
these issues we have worked miracles in seeking a common 
position." 
  On Berlusconi's accusations that the Democratic Party of the 
Left will follow a policy of high spending, he says: "I'd like 
to tell Mr. Berlusconi that we are not the party of taxes. We 
want to cut taxes for families and businesses. But we want 
those who have never paid taxes to start doing so." 
  Asked whether Leoluca Orlando, the leader of the Network; 
Ottaviano Del Turco, leader of the Italian Socialist Party; 
Ferdinando Adornato, leader of the Democratic Alliance; and 
Fausto Bertinotti, leader of Communist Refoundation, will really 
take part in the coalition of the left, he says: "Yes, I can 
guarantee that." 
  Asked whether the decision taken by Giorgio La Malfa, 
secretary of the Italian Republican Party, to join the center 
instead of the coalition of the left is a blow to his plans for 
the elections, Ochetto says: "Actually it is a blow for him." 
  On Mario Segni, leader of the Pact for Italy, Occhetto says: 
"He has the reputation of being someone who constantly changes 
his mind. I must say that his ideas are very clear on one point: 
he wants to be prime minister." 
  Asked many times whether he is a candidate for the post of 
prime minister, Occhetto never gives a clear and straight 
answer. He says: "The only sure thing is that I do have other 
things on my mind and not just the idea of being prime minister. 
This unfortunate thing may happen; it would be a task, 
something I would have to do, a service." 
  On the candidates of the left to the post of prime minister 
after Ciampi's decision to abandon politics, Occhetto says: 
"Ciampi has said he is above all parties. As prime minister, he 
took the right decision. I still think that he is a reserve for 
democracy in Italy." 
  On the PDS's much talked-about control of the new RAI, 
Occhetto says: "I would rather be a politician like Berlusconi. 
He sits comfortably at home, sends a tape around, and he ends 
up on all national channels, public and private, on the same 
day." 
  On the number of PDS politicians involved in the Bribesville 
scandal, he says: "Bribesville means something very precise: 
public and private billions of lire given to parties in return 
for some favors. In this respect we have nobody [under 
investigation]." 
  On Bettino Craxi, former leader of the Italian Socialist 
Party, and television mogul Silvio Berlusconi, Occhetto says: 
"Craxi has said that Berlusconi is filling a gap. It is true, 
he is filling the gap left by Craxi. Berlusconi is nothing more 
than raw and pure craxism." He adds: "Berlusconi is now saying: 
I am the new man. No, you are Bettino Craxi." 
  On Berlusconi's power in the media and the election 
campaign, 
Occhetto says: "Last night I watched a film [on one of 
Berlusconi's channels]. During the film I was interrupted five 
times by a `Forza Italia' [advertisement for Berlusconi's 
party]. I asked myself: Who is paying for that election 
campaign? If I wanted to broadcast only one of those 
advertisements, I would have to stop paying [PDS] employees for 
one year -- not only those who work at the headquarters, but 
also those who work in the branches all over Italy." 
  Asked on what he would do in case of victory in the March 
elections, Occhetto concludes: "If I won the elections, the 
first thing I would do would be to start a 100-day program to 
tackle the problem of unemployment with training contracts and 
support contracts for all those who are now in a difficult 
situation."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "De Mita's Candidacy Continues To </F>
Torment the PPI"] 
  [Text] The leader from Avellino [former Christian 
Democratic Party (DC) Chairman Ciriaco De Mita], supported by 
the PPI [Italian Popular Party] secretary for Avellino, wants to 
return to parliament, despite being served two judicial notices 
of investigation. He said that he "is neither indicted nor 
under investigation" and added: "There are no judges wanting to 
commit me to trial." He went on to specify that one case has 
already been dealt with by the lower house and in the other case 
the magistrates acted because it was their official duty to do 
so. A thorny problem for [PPI Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli who, 
in a brief article in IL POPOLO, calls for "discipline and 
humility" from all party members. And, in view of the "huge 
responsibility" which the present moment carries with it, 
Martinazzoli says that "it must be clear to everybody that there 
are no problems regarding `individuals.'" 
  Other PPI members, too, are trying to persuade De Mita to 
stand down. "Good examples must come first and foremost from 
the top," Popular Party movement leader Roberto Formigoni said, 
adding that there is a need for new faces and that De Mita was 
both DC secretary for seven years and prime minister. [Pact for 
Italy leader] Mario Segni referred to the example set by the PRI 
[Italian Republican Party] secretary: "La Malfa," he said, "set 
a really noteworthy example; it is painful to say so but the 
same unquestionably applies to De Mita." The call to stand 
aside was also made by [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) 
Secretary] Achille Occhetto, while [Christian Democratic Center 
leader] Francesco D'Onofrio feels that it is right for De Mita 
to want to return to Montecitorio [parliament]. [PPI left-wing 
faction leader] Rosy Bindi chose not to offer any advice. 
"Ciriaco has taught us a great many things," she said. "One of 
the many things he has taught us is that politics is conviction. 
This problem will be resolved on the basis of his convinctions, 
not thanks to any reiterated appeals on our part." The 
merry-go-round of withdrawals -- the latest comes from Freedom 
of Life movement leader Carlo Casini, who will not be standing 
for parliament again -- and candidacies is continuing. [Italian 
Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] Gianfranco Fini could lead the 
flame [MSI symbol] in Treviso, while in the eastern Veneto the 
PDS grass roots want [L'UNITA editor] Walter Veltroni. The oak 
tree [PDS symbol] will put forward Achille Occhetto in Bologna, 
and Vittorio Sgarbi [Italian Liberal Party member and Berlusconi 
supporter running on the "Sgarbi for Italy" ticket] is aiming 
for a constituency in the Marche region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mario Segni by Giovanni Grassi in Rome; date </F>
not given: "I, Mario Segni, Third Alternative Against My Will"] 
  [Text] On the left? "Those who pine for Cuba." On the 
right? "The descendants of fascism and the separatists." Mario 
Segni is now abandoning the pursuit of a two-party system, 
stating: "The only alternative to the PDS [Democratic Party of 
the Left] is the `Pact for Italy.'" With Martinazzoli, La 
Malfa, and Amato. "The heirs of the CAF 
[Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani] have sided with Bossi and Berlusconi." 
  "On the left we have those who hark back to the days of the 
Berlin wall, and on the right the heirs of fascism." These are 
the terms in which Mario Segni expounds the paradox that he is 
now facing, and it is no small political paradox: He is the man 
who fought hardest, with the institutional referenda, for a 
two-party system based on alternation in Italy as well, but he 
now finds himself leading a third pole opposing both the right 
and the left. "Over the last few months," Segni explains, "We 
have come to realize that you cannot achieve a two-party system 
in a few weeks; it takes a much longer political process. But 
let's get things straight: What he have set up with the `Pact 
for Italy' is not a third pole, the geographical center, ready 
to line up with the right or the left at its own convenience, 
according to Andreotti's old theory of the two ovens." The Pact 
for Italy was originally formed to become the 
liberal-democratic, reformist pole in opposition to the left. 
In the midst of the current chaos, it now represents the only 
true national alternative with the potential to beat a left wing 
dominated by the PDS. 
  [Grasso] All things considered, the prospect of a European 
two-party system is receding, at least for the time being.... 
  [Segni] Yes, but the blame also lies with the Italian left, 
which has no Gonzales or Mitterrand, only Occhetto and D'Alema, 
who have no scruples about forming alliances with Bertinotti, in 
other words with those on the left who look not to Europe but to 
Cuba. 
  [Grasso] Be that as it may, the left and the right seem to 
form an unholy alliance against you.... 
  [Segni] Yes, but what I want to say is that the aroma of 
stale politics hangs over both Occhetto's forces and the force 
taking shape [if it ever does emerge fully as a force] among 
Berlusconi, Bossi, and Fini. They have consciously omitted a 
fundamental step: agreeing on a platform for a true political 
alliance. Forming a hotchpotch alliance just to gain a few more 
seats strikes me as a disgraceful lack of respect for the people 
who voted to turn over a new leaf in the referendum. What sense 
does it make, for instance, to lump together the League, which 
still has federalism as one of its tenets, and the MSI [Italian 
Social Movement], which will fight its election campaign in the 
south on a platform of national unity? How can these two forces 
form a government together? Let us not deceive ourselves.... 
  [Grasso] Berlusconi accuses you of splitting the 
liberal-democratic pole, thus helping the left to win. 
  [Segni] How can Berlusconi describe himself as a liberal 
democrat and yet get on with Fini? Liberal democracy is 
something very different from claiming to represent the 
continuation of the fascist tradition and outlook, albeit in an 
updated form. Giscard has never come to arrangements with Le 
Pen. 
  [Grasso] Deputy Segni, you had managed to wrest an agreement 
on a platform for government from the League's lower house floor 
leader, Maroni. Then Bossi disowned Maroni, and Maroni said 
there had never been any mention of alliances with Martinazzoli 
and the PPI [Italian Popular Party]. What is the truth? 
  [Segni] We have always said that our goal was to gather the 
best of democratic Catholicism around the Pact, along with those 
of a liberal-democratic and reformist persuasion, and the 
Popular Party has been in the Pact since the beginning. Maroni 
was perfectly well aware of this. What subsequently passed 
between Bossi and Maroni I do not know, although I do not find 
it difficult to imagine. The once certain thing is that the 
League had to disown an agreement that would have made it clear 
once and for all that Italian unity is inviolable. By taking 
this step, Bossi has once again confirmed his inconsistency on 
this issue, demonstrating once and for all that the League is 
unreliable. 
  [Grasso] Has Bossi's "no" disappointed you? 
  [Segni] I have no regrets. We did everything in broad 
daylight and with the intention of creating a joint platform, as 
called for by the result of the referendum. It would have been 
much more convenient to hold secret meetings with Bossi and 
Maroni, but that was a feature of the old way of politics, the 
way that lead to "kickback city." Anyway, we did achieve one 
result: The electorate in the north now knows who it is that 
wants modernity and progress, who wants to combat statism and 
inefficiency, who wants privatization, greater regional 
autonomy, and safeguards for the weaker members of society and 
for the family, without jeopardizing Italian unity and the 
national spirit. 
  [Grasso] Were you not a little naive to think it would be 
possible to come to an agreement with Bossi? 
  [Segni] I don't know. But it's much better to be naive and 
in good faith than to be forced to go back on an agreement after 
little more than 24 hours. 
  [Grasso] What idea have you formed of the right-wing pole? 
  [Segni] It isn't a pole, and it is tainted by a fascist 
strain. It is a true right-wing aggregate, unacceptable to a 
modern electorate. It is as well for all the moderates in the 
north who voted for the League as a protest to reflect that this 
is no longer the time for protest votes: The old regime has 
been demolished, and now it is time to build. Meanwhile, the 
southern electorate must realize that if it votes for the MSI it 
will also help the League, which is no longer concealing its 
separatist, selfish tendencies. 
  [Grasso] What do you think of Amato and La Malfa joining the 
Pact? 
  [Segni] I believe that it is fundamental for the Pact to 
take in major currents that represent the better manifestations 
of the nonconfessional, reformist political traditions. But I 
want to make it clear that the Pact will not serve as a life 
raft for shipwrecked exponents of the party regime. La Malfa 
has set an example by saying that he does not intend to stand 
for reelection, and I greatly appreciate this gesture. 
Moreover, I am quite sure that we shall stand or fall by the 
candidates that we put up: We shall fail the Italians' 
expectations unless we present a new, credible, political class. 
  [Grasso] Does this apply to De Mita too? 
  [Segni] Look, it is not my place to hand down summary 
verdicts. I have already stated publicly that, in my opinion, 
De Mita should keep out. However, this does not apply only to 
him, but to all those, without exception, who have been the 
protagonists of the old party regime, whether at local or at 
national level. 
  [Grasso] Segni, Martinazzoli, Amato, La Malfa. Miglio 
accuses you of having reformed the five-party coalition.... 
  [Segni] I would advise Miglio to look to his own house: The 
remnants of Craxism are siding with Berlusconi, and the CCD 
[Democratic Christian Center] are the direct heirs of the CAF. 
And both Berlusconi and the CCD have lined up with the League, 
not with us. 
  [Grasso] If none of the poles gains an absolute majority in 
the election, what will you do? Is there not a risk of 
ungovernability? 
  [Segni] If people want us to govern, they must vote for us, 
otherwise no one can force us into government. We can go into 
opposition, and if we do, we shall do so in earnest, not like 
the consociational opposition that we have had to date. It may 
well be that parliament is ungovernable after the election, but 
I have always maintained that the journey begun with the 
referendum is not over yet and that if things are to go in the 
right direction we need to amend the constitution to allow the 
direct election of the executive. 
  [Grasso] One last question: The catholic world is 
experiencing some anxiety over your government platform, which 
is suspected of being over-reliant on free market forces.... 
  [Segni] I should like to make one thing clear: When I talk 
about liberal democracy I do not mean that we want to do away 
with the welfare state. We want to do away with a state that 
promised all things to all men and, in the end, gave no one 
anything. The challenge today is to find out where the new poor 
are and to give them real protection. Then there is the family, 
which is one of the main features of our platform. They have 
all promised to safeguard the family in Italy, but no one has 
ever done so. Suffice it to say that the state receives three 
times as much for family allowances as it actually pays out.

  [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Joaquim Chissano is in 
Portugal. The Mozambican president came to Lisbon to talk to 
President Mario Soares and Prime Minister Cavaco Silva about the 
Mozambican peace process. The training of Afonso Dhlakama's 
bodyguards by Portuguese experts will also be one of the issues 
on the agenda. More details from Sofia Vieira: 
  [Vieira] Joaquim Chissano is in Lisbon in response to an 
invitation by President Mario Soares. This is a brief visit, 
during which he will also talk to the prime minister about the 
Mozambican peace process. These highest-level meetings follow a 
meeting at the weekend in Davos, Switzerland, with Portuguese 
Foreign Affairs Minister Durao Barroso. 
  During this stopover in Lisbon--on his way to Luanda where 
he 
will be attending a meeting of African leaders--Chissano 
stressed the importance of the peace process in his country and 
reminded that all processes in southern Africa are interlinked. 
Therefore, contact with his Angolan and South African 
counterparts is important. 
  This short visit may also be used for clarifying the case 
related to the training of the Renamo leader's bodyguards. The 
Mozambican president accused the Portuguese Government of having 
provided training in Portugal for Afonso Dhlakama's men. 
According to Chissano, this situation is unacceptable because 
it goes against the principles contained in the peace agreement. 
  Another issue that will certainly be discussed at the 
meetings with Soares and Cavaco Silva is related to the training 
of the future Mozambican Armed Forces. Troop 
confinement--particularly that of the Frelimo troops--continues 
to delay the peace process, and the UN Security Council has 
already warned that it may condemn the Maputo government for its 
continuing delay in implementing the agreement. 
  [Announcer] Chissano is in Portugal to talk about the 
Mozambican peace process.

  [Text] President Chissano of Mozambique, who arrived in 
Lisbon today on a visit of only a few hours' duration, has 
guaranteed that the elections in his country will be held as 
scheduled, despite the delays in the peace process. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The meeting with [President] 
Mario Soares lasted 90 minutes, during which the two heads of 
state exchanged information on matters related to southern 
Africa. Afterward Chissano answered reporters' questions: 
  [Begin recording] [Chissano] [This meeting] has served as a 
reiteration by the president of the Portuguese republic of 
continuing support for the Mozambican peace process. 
  [Correspondent] Did you talk about the delay in assembling 
the government troops in the confinement areas? 
  [Chissano] Yes, I informed him that there is a delay in 
assembling the troops on both sides, not just on the 
government's side. 
  [Correspondent] What about [UN representative] Ajello's 
statement? 
  [Chissano] Which one? 
  [Correspondent] On the possibility of the elections having 
to 
be put back. 
  [Chissano] I do not think there is any cause for alarm in 
that regard, because the delay in assembling the troops can 
easily be rectified. 
  [Correspondent] What is the state of cooperation with the 
Portuguese military? 
  [Chissano] It is fine. Preparations have already begun with 
a view to starting the training [of Mozambican troops] on 7 
February. [end recording]

  [Text] Saint-Gall, Switzerland, Feb 2 (AFP) -- The wreck 
of a twin-engine aircraft has been found 160 metres below the 
surface of Lake Constance, Swiss police said Tuesday [1 
February]. 
  It was not immediately clear if the plane was the 
German-registered Cessna aircraft that disappeared last week 
shortly before landing at the Alternrhein airstrip near here 
with 70 kilograms of radioactive caesium-137 aboard. 
  A robot sub would be sent down Wednesday to inspect the 
wreckage, police said. 
  Geiger counter readings taken near the wreckage Tuesday did 
not show any increased radiation, police said. The lake 
supplies drinking water to four million people in northern 
Switzerland.

<F P=106> [Report by Erik Bjorn Moller: "Duetoft: NATO Agreements Are </F>
Pure Self-Deception"] 
  [Text] The chairman of the Folketing's Foreign Affairs 
Council, Peter Duetoft, is currently causing great turbulence 
among the government parties on the question of Denmark's 
approach to NATO's new agreements with the countries of East 
Europe, the so-called Partnership for Peace agreements. 
  The agreements do not guarantee that the NATO countries 
would 
automatically intervene the moment that Poland, Hungary, or the 
Czech Republic, for example, became the target of aggression. 
On the other hand, the agreements do make sure that in a crisis 
situation the threatened countries have a guarantee of so-called 
consultation with the 16 NATO countries. 
  "But if this partnership is simply joint maneuvers and a 
consultation in a crisis -- then it is nothing. If there is no 
built-in automatic mechanism providing help, it is much easier 
to say, `Oh well, we need not take this too seriously,'" said 
Peter Duetoft, who compared the agreements to the 1938 Munich 
agreement. 
  "I am furious, because I am afraid that things could end in 
the same way. In 1938 the agreement did not commit anyone to 
anything. People just wanted to play along with Hitler. My 
position is that if this does not end in new members for NATO 
before the next Russian presidential election in two years' 
time, the agreements are worth nothing, and the same could 
happen again. And then the agreements would simply be a bluff or 
a self-deception. It is not realistic that the countries could 
become NATO members once Zhirinovskiy (infamous and popular 
Russian right-wing extremist) is president. It would be too 
late and too great a provocation. And that risk is a very real 
one," Peter Duetoft said. 
  Radical Liberal foreign policy spokesman Jorgen Estrup 
thinks 
it extremely unfortunate that Duetoft is airing his criticism at 
the present time. 
  "Raising one's voice at the present time is not particularly 
helpful. Duetoft should have voiced his objections before the 
government had decided its line. It seems a little easy and 
cheap to say this now," Estrup said. 
  Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup (Social Democratic Party) 
did 
not want to go into Peter Duetoft's motives for voicing his 
criticism now: 
  "But in my contacts with the countries of East Europe I have 
come up against a strong desire for a security guarantee now -- 
but it has of course proved impossible to reach agreement on 
this. Nevertheless, we have a good compromise. For it is clear 
that the goal is an expansion of NATO. In addition, the 
countries are getting an extremely important crisis management 
tool in the form of consultation with the NATO council."

<F P=106> [Report by Erik Bjorn Moller: "Liberals Losing Ground"] </F>
  [Text] If it were not for the fact that Gallup's latest 
opinion poll took place before departing Research Minister Svend 
Bergstein (Center Democrat) raised his voice and drew attention 
to the Center Democrats and his ministry, a few people might 
have been tempted to believe that the Center Democrats' latest 
rise had to do with the fired minister's final broadside. 
  This is not the case. Nevertheless, in today's Gallup 
opinion poll it is a fact that once again the Center Democrats 
-- as they did in November -- are succeeding in keeping their 
nose above the threshold for representation in the Folketing -- 
this time with five deputies to boot. 
  On the other hand the Liberal Party has fallen from 30.5 
percent in December to 27.5 percent this month. If there were a 
Folketing election tomorrow, the Liberal Party would have 49 
seats -- as against 57 in December. 
  Nevertheless, Liberal Party taxation spokesman Peter 
Brixtofte has faith in a landslide when the election comes. 
"Our standing is high regardless. It is still double what it 
has been in the past. The other things are temporary 
fluctuations. Things go up and down. But with these figures I 
would like to urge the Center Democrats to return to the fold 
where they belong," Brixtofte said. 
  Neither a Liberal Party-Conservative People's Party-Progress 
Party bloc nor the present government would have an absolute 
majority. The Unity List would again enter the Folketing.

  [Excerpts] In compliance with a request from Germany, 
Denmark today started tightening passport controls at entries 
from Sweden, trying to stop the flow of Kosovo Albanians from 
the Nordic area into Germany. Knowing that they have little 
chance of receiving asylum here in Sweden, these refugees have 
been trying to find asylum elsewhere before being sent back 
home. Radio Sweden's Christopher Folick reports from the Danish 
capital: 
  [Folick] In the past few months, some 500 Kosovo Albanians 
from Sweden have been turned back from Denmark's borders with 
Germany, mainly from Danish ferries arriving in north German 
ports and the Germans last week began gradually imposing a 
system of fines of up to 5,000 marks on transport companies 
caught carrying illegal refugees into Germany from Denmark on 
trains, ferries, and buses. The new reinforced checks will 
mainly focus on ferries from Sweden and to Germany, as the 
refugees tend to mainly use them to get to Denmark en route for 
Germany. [passage omitted] 
  The tidying up of Danish controls stems from Germany's 
recent 
restriction and means that extra Danish border police have been 
put in mainly at the ports of Helsingor, Copenhagen, and 
Frederikshavn, the main entry points into Denmark for ferry 
traffic from neighboring Sweden and Norway, as well as at exit 
ports to neighboring Germany. The Danish move means primarily 
an intensification of spot checks on all incoming travelers from 
Sweden and Norway and will last for an initial three-months 
period whereupon further consultations with Germany will be 
carried out and the situation reviewed. Christopher Folick for 
Radio Sweden in Copenhagen.

<F P=106> [Report by Bjarne Nitovuori: "New Poll: Rehn's Lead </F>
Shrinking"] 
  [Excerpt] The latest opinion poll, published yesterday in 
HELSINGIN SANOMAT, shows that Elisabeth Rehn's (Swedish People's 
Party) lead over her rival in the final round of the 
presidential election, Martti Ahtisaari (Social Democratic 
Party), is now very narrow. 
  Of those interviewed who were willing to state their 
preference, 53 percent promised to vote for Rehn and 47 percent 
for Ahtisaari. This difference falls within the margin of error 
of 3 percent in either direction. In theory it is possible 
therefore that the state of public opinion is level at 50-50. 
  The poll was carried out by Finska Gallup on 26 and 27 
January. In a similar poll carried out the day after the first 
round of the election, Rehn led by 56 percent to 44 percent. 
  Both polls interviewed around 1,000 people, 24 percent of 
whom were unwilling to state their preference or announced that 
they did not intend to vote. 
  Of those interviewed last week, 11 percent had already 
voted. 
The Rehn-Ahtisaari balance among them was even. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Jyri Raivio: "Finland and the EU Reached </F>
Agreement on Approach to Agriculture--Permanent Support 
Negotiated First, Details Still Open"] 
  [Text] Finland's foreign minister, Pertti Salolainen 
(Conservative Party), has reached an agreement with the EU 
[European Union] on the approach to be taken regarding Finnish 
agriculture, which is the most complicated issue to be solved 
during the negotiations. 
  During his visit to Brussels on Monday [10 January], 
Salolainen met with, among others, Hans van den Broek, who is 
the EU Commission member in charge of membership negotiations. 
During the ensuing discussions, it was agreed that the first 
issue to be resolved would be the question of the permanent 
support Finland could receive, either from the EU or from its 
own appropriations. After the issue of permanent support has 
been resolved, a study will be conducted on how the solution 
reached will affect the Finnish food-processing industry. After 
that, attention will be focused on negotiations regarding 
transition periods, special arrangements in connection with such 
periods, and product quotas. 
  This sequence of events deviates from that which the EU 
Commission expressed as its view on agriculture, which caused 
quite a stir in Finland. According to Finland's negotiator on 
agricultural issues, Esa Harmala, who accompanied Salolainen on 
his visit with van den Broek, the most central issue emerging 
from the commission's documents is not permanent support but the 
manner in which Finnish producer prices should reach EU producer 
price levels. In Harmala's view, this kind of progression has 
been "confusing." But the decision was made to first negotiate 
about permanent support, which, in Finland, could be paid due to 
unfavorable conditions or environmental factors. Salolainen 
referred to the consensus reached in this matter as "some kind 
of a breakthrough." However, he emphasized that agreeing on the 
marching order does not indicate agreement on the actual issues 
at hand. 
  As far as these are concerned, it appears that they must be 
resolved using Salolainen's "crisis scenario," or, in other 
words, by working late into the night, racing against the 
deadline. Salolainen's visit to Brussels was not only due to the 
membership negotiations, but he was also there as the new 
chairman for EFTA [European Free Trade Association], which is 
the other party in the European Economic Area, EEA. The 
discussions were focused, however, on the membership issue, 
regarding which Salolainen also talked with Sir Leon Brittan, 
who is the EU commissioner in charge of foreign economic ties, 
and with the ambassador, Alexandros Saphiriou, of the new 
chairmanship country, Greece.

<F P=106> [Article by Rauni Vainamo: "East Border Becoming Rio Grande </F>
of the North"] 
  [Text] The border between Finland and Russia has been 
described as the most precipitous standard of living divider in 
the world. It reminds us of the border between the United States 
and Mexico. In that area, the difference in living standards has 
created lots of industry around the Rio Grande. 
  The border between Finland and Russia is quiet but showing 
signs of waking up. Three industrial villages are under 
construction along the border and a number of joint ventures are 
emerging. Trade across the border is taking place, utilizing 
various methods. 
  In the view of the experts, the eastern border, home of 
wolves, criminals and bears, should become an impressive facade 
towards Europe. The border should be utilized systematically, 
from Petsamo all the way to St. Petersburg and the Gulf of 
Vyborg. 
  "Currently, projects are arbitrarily started at the eastern 
border. For example, roads and industrial plants may be built in 
the wrong areas due to a lack of information," architect Risto 
Ali-Kovero, from Sunnittelukeskus Oy, noted with some concern. 
  Ali-Kovero has prepared a macronetwork plan for the border 
area, where the border line has been divided into the following 
planning areas: The Petsamo Corridor, The Sea to Sea Corridor, 
The Kainuu-Kostamus Corridor, The Karelian Gateway Area and The 
Kymi Border Circle. Also included are the Ystavyydenpuisto and 
the Saimaa-Ladoga Area. 
  "During the negotiations, Finland needs some trumps up its 
sleeves with which we can show that we are developing the border 
area in a controlled manner and that we are not creating an 
uninhabited backyard for the EU [European Union]," said 
Ali-Kohero. 
  If approval is granted for studies covering the entire 
borderline, more detailed planning, according to Ali-Kovero, 
will be initiated as a joint effort involving the Moscow 
building committee, Gostroi, the Government of the Republic of 
Karelia, and the Finnish Ministry of Environmental Affairs. 
<H5>  Village of Kostamus Largest </H5>
  Of all the ambitious industrial village projects, the 
largest 
is the Kospark Technology Park, which is located on the latitude 
of Kuhmo in Kostamus. 
  Business ventures are solicited to Kostamus not only from 
Scandinavia, but also from, among other countries, Germany. The 
plans are completed and the brochure has arrived from the 
printers. The investment costs in the industrial park, which 
spans about 15,000 square kilometers, are about 10 million 
dollars. The joint venture has already completed the frame of 
the main building of the mining industry collective, which is to 
be completed first. According to Research Director Hannu 
Linnainmaa, from Haka Oy, which is in charge of the project, it 
will include 2,000 square meters of space to be leased to 
businesses. 
  "The output is supposed to be environmentally safe, as we do 
not want to emit any pollutants into the environment. The border 
area is Finland's Rio Grande, but we have to be careful and not 
let inflation take the bottom out of the project. There are 
already products in Russia, the prices of which exceed world 
market prices," said Linnainmaa. 
  The intent is also to utilize high tech jointly with the 
universities. 
  The company has been founded as a closed private 
corporation, 
and its domicile is the City of Kostamus. 
<H5>  Work Done Close to Border </H5>
  The Kostamus Technology Park is located 40-50 km from the 
Finnish border. On the other hand, the Svetogorsk and Vartsila 
industrial villages are next to the border. The Varn industrial 
village, to be built on the Russian side of Vartsila, is part of 
the Karelian Gateway project, which was initiated by the 
Ministry of Environmental Affairs. 
  "Two areas in the village of Vartsila have been set aside 
for 
industrial and business facilities. Completed business spaces 
are also available in Sortavala. Janisjoki will also be utilized 
for tourism," said Kesalahti Business Ombudsman Kari Oksanen, 
who is in charge of the project. 
  The Varn Industrial Village is almost 30 hectares large, and 
the area is currently being mapped. The Russians own 57 percent 
of the venture, while the Finns own 43 percent. According to 
Oksanen, the minority share was a requirement for capital 
infusion from a fund recently established by the Russians. 
  In Svetogorsk, near Imatra, a Finnish-Russian business park 
is operating. The Russians own over 90 percent of the park. The 
size of the area is about 7 hectares. On the Finnish side, the 
partner in the joint venture is Suomen Imsveto. 
  "There are already two businesses on the Russian side of the 
business park. We provide them with a complete service, from the 
acquisition of raw materials to bookkeeping," said Antero 
Ikalainen, president of Suomen Imsveto Oy. 
  New border crossings lead to increased cooperation at the 
border. Another contributing factor is the special benefits 
granted Karelia through Russian development policies. The 
agreement between Finland and Russia regarding adjacent area 
cooperation has also helped to some extent. The Finnish state 
has appropriated a few million markkas for this cooperation. 
  The industrial villages, which are to be built in Russian 
Karelia, are also pleased by the expansion of the Developing 
Area Fund (KERA). A law proposal regarding this has been 
submitted to the Eduskunta. According to the proposal, KERA also 
should be able to fund start up and development costs for 
Finnish ventures when they are established abroad. 
  Financing could also be arranged for the purchase of shares 
in a company operating abroad. According to Pauli Tiainen, 
financing manager for KERA, next year's appropriation for this 
would be approximately 50 million markkas. 
<H5>  Village Retailer Showed Quadrangular Nail </H5>
  In village storekeeper Oiva Tikka's store there are boxes of 
nails imported from Russia. The hot galvanized iron nails are 
resulting in the establishment of an industrial village in the 
Russian part of Karelia. The village would benefit all of 
central Karelia. 
  In April of 1990, Tikka started to import nails from an iron 
plant located directly across the border. He, in turn, exported 
kitchen stoves with four burners to Russian Karelia. 
  "We met with the Russians for the first time in 1989. We met 
with Viktor Kamel, the manager of the iron plant, three times, 
after which we prepared a letter of intent, a business 
agreement, and also an agreement with a Finnish central firm, " 
said Tikka. 
  Tikka also acted as a product development consultant. He 
showed the plant manager a Finnish quadrangular nail and advised 
him in the production of more advanced hot galvanized nails. 
Tikka estimates that he has imported from the Russian part of 
Vartsila about 300 metric tons of iron nails, but the recession 
has had a dampening effect on demand. 
  Today, Viktor Kamel, the iron plant manager, is chairman of 
the Board of Directors for the Varn Technology Village. The five 
districts of Central Karelia participate in the project. They 
are, in addition to Vartsila, Kesalahti, Kitee, Tohmajarvi, and 
Raakkyla. Capital stock has been issued and the company has been 
registered in Petroskoi. 
  Kamel is concerned about the lack of decisions regarding the 
land areas in the industrial village. The instability of the 
political situation makes him weigh his words very carefully 
when he speaks in his office, which still is adorned with a 
picture of Lenin on the wall. 
  Viktor Kamel seems to have enough problems even within his 
plant. The plant employs 850 people, and, according to him, many 
of them are now not needed. "We don't want to let anybody go, 
and therefore we now need to find them other jobs. And these 
jobs should be produced by the joint venture, which started in 
May," said Kamel. 
  Kamel's wife, engineer Olga Kamel, manages a sewing shop, 
located in the area of the iron plant, which employs over a 
dozen women. Skila, from Joensuu, has outerwear for children 
sewn in the Russian part of Vartsila.

<F P=106> [Article by Harald Stanghelle: "Uncertainty Over </F>
Conservatives' Leadership Results in Decline in Polls"] 
  [Text] Uncertainty and speculation over the leadership in 
the Conservative Party have resulted in a strong decline in the 
[polling company] Opinion's poll for January. 
  The Conservative Party has declined by as much as 1.9 
percentage points and has the support of only 16 percent of the 
voters. 
  Last Friday [8 January] the TV news program "Dagsrevyen" 
announced that Kaci Kullmann Five wanted to withdraw as party 
leader. This was confirmed on Saturday by the Conservative 
leader who cited strong, personal reasons for her choice. 
Speculation surrounding the Conservative Party's leadership 
situation dominated the media. The Opinion poll was started on 
Monday afternoon and thus includes the reaction of the voters to 
the situation within the Conservative Party. 
  Opinion's background material shows that voters are beset by 
confusion: Some Conservative voters who sat out the election 
last year say that they will vote for the Conservative Party 
next time. The Conservative leader's conduct has created 
sympathy for the party within this group of voters. But a far 
larger portion of Conservative voters belong to the group of 
voters who today are unsure of which party they will vote for. 
Some Conservative voters will vote for the Labor Party, while 
others will vote for the Progress Party which, thanks to the 
problems of the Conservatives and not to their own efforts, 
advanced 0.9 percentage points in the January polls. 
  The crystal-clear trend in the polls is the fact that a 
focus 
on what is being called the Conservatives' leadership crisis is 
creating a feeling of uncertainty among Conservative voters. 
  However, Opinion's background material also shows that the 
Conservatives today take advantage only to a small degree of its 
voter potential. The Conservative voters feel uncertain and 
frustrated, but only a few are defecting in favor of another 
party in the first round. That is why it is crucial for the 
Conservatives to clean up their own house. 
  Voter response to the present-day Conservative Party is very 
low, but it is still better now than it was three years ago when 
the Conservatives had a record low of 14.4 on Opinion's party 
barometer. That was in January 1991, a short time after the fall 
of the Syse government. In June 1993, support was at 27 percent, 
while it is 11 percent lower today. In other words, it is worth 
noting that the support of the Conservative Party has shown 
enormous fluctuations in the last few years. 
  Of most interest today is the fate of the Conservatives, but 
it is worth noting that the Labor Party continues to improve its 
standing, achieving a response of as much as 41.6 
percent--progress of 1.8 percentage points. The Socialist Left 
Party is struggling hard, and has slipped by 1 percentage point, 
to 7.4. The Center party has improved by 1 percentage point and 
has achieved a record of 18.1 percent.

<F P=106> [Wolf Gunter Bruegmann report: "Estonia As An East-West </F>
Bridge"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt a. M., 1 February -- Estonian Prime 
Minister Mart Laar sees his country as an example that shows how 
"radical reforms" can be effected successfully in the East. 
More attention as well as investments from western Europe could 
result in an "obvious effect" and bring about more security in 
Europe, said Laar, who is 33 and the youngest head of government 
in Europe, at the opening event of Estonian Week at the 
Frankfurt Union International Club. 
  Talking about security, history teacher Laar reminded the 
audience that Estonia -- located at the climatic divide between 
the Gulf Stream and Siberia --was already an outpost of Western 
culture during the days of the Roman Empire. In the last 
century, Estonian intellectuals already said that only an 
integration of Europe could keep Russia at bay. What was utopia 
then is very topical now, Laar said. European integration is 
the only guarantee for a democratic future in Russia. With its 
proximity to St. Petersburg, Estonia exerts some influence on 
the entire northwest of Russia, he said. 
  And this is Laar's success story of Estonia, which has 1.6 
million inhabitants (including 500,000 Russians): Estonia has 
had its own currency, oriented toward the German mark, since 
1992. The inflation rate was cut from 1,000 to 32 percent. The 
budget is balanced. It has been possible to build up some 
foreign currency reserves. The country offers "qualified and 
cheap labor." Foreign trade with Russia has declined from 90 
percent in 1990 to 20 percent today; Finland now ranks first, 
followed by Sweden and Great Britain, with Germany in fourth 
place. 
  Yet, other reports say the radical changes in Estonia have 
led not only to a doubling of average monthly incomes, but also 
to a dramatic increase in Mafia-like crimes, with murders, bomb 
attacks, theft, and corruption. The largest portion of these 
are illegal trading in weapons, drugs, and metals that originate 
from Asia and are sold to the Scandinavian black market.

  [Excerpt] Rostock (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Interior Minister 
Manfred Kanther has acknowledged that action is still needed to 
protect the border between Germany and Poland. During a visit 
to the Federal Border Guard in the Warnemuende District of 
Rostock today, the minister said contacts between the border 
authorities of both countries could be improved. Therefore, he 
is proposing an exchange of liaison officers. He also called on 
border guards to improve their knowledge of each other's 
language. 
  Kanther said Germany will also be providing more equipment 
to 
the Polish police and border security bodies. It is clear that 
the matter of border protection on Germany's eastern border 
demands that all the parties involved accustom thsemselves to 
the new situation, he said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with correspondent Henning von Lewies </F>
by news moderator Karin Beindorf -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Beindorf] A new law to reduce the number of 
asylum-seekers in Germany can only work if the neighboring 
countries cooperate. Poland, for example, was raised to the 
level of a safe third-country; since then, refugees, who had 
crossed Poland on their way to Germany, had to expect to be 
returned to Poland as soon as they arrived here. However, the 
agreement with Poland has obviously not produced the result Bonn 
expected. Instead of the approximately 10,000 who should have 
been returned each year, the number was just somewhat higher 
than 3,000, which has, allegedly, created some ill-feelings. 
  Federal Interior Minister Kanther returned today from 
Warsaw, 
where he had met with his counterpart and with the Polish 
president. He stopped in Rostock Warnemuende on his way back to 
Bonn. 
  I now have my colleague Henning von Lewies on the telephone 
from there. Mr. Von Lewies, what did Kanther have to say about 
the German-Polish talks, or has he maintained his silence? 
  [Von Lewies] Mrs. Beindorf, Kanther said one could not speak 
of ill-feelings, and that the media played up the affair. He 
said the talks with his Polish partners in Warsaw on various 
issues were excellent, and that they included topics such as 
cooperation in the struggle against crime and the return of 
cultural objects. So, as he claimed, there were no ill-feelings 
or irritation. He added, however, that there is much need to 
take action. Contacts between the border organs should be 
improved. It is intended to exchange liaison officials, which 
suggests that things at the German-Polish border are not as they 
should be. 
  In addition, German equipment should be provided for the 
Polish police and border security organs, as was agreed in the 
1993 treaty. This is, so to speak, the result of that visit to 
Warsaw. 
  [Beindorf] Did Kanther comment on the numbers that I 
mentioned at the beginning -- the 10,000 Bonn expected, compared 
to the only 3,000 refugees who were actually returned? 
  [Von Lewies] No, he did not say a word. He downplayed the 
commotion and said the affair was played up by the media.

  [Excerpts] Augsburg (DDP/ADN) -- The German Defense 
Ministry intends to accommodate the 1.25 billion mark [DM] cuts 
to its budget, approved by the cabinet, by making savings in 
Bundeswehr personnel and equipment expenditure. The AUGSBURGER 
ALLGEMEINE reports (in its Wednesday [2 February] edition) that 
among other things, DM220 million are to be saved in the 
purchase and development of arms equipment. The Defense Ministry 
wants to save DM60 million by provisionally leaving the army 
officer training college in Hannover instead of moving it to 
Dresden, as planned. [passage omitted] 
  The paper also said the ministry hopes to save around DM235 
million by cutting personnel levels. For example, some 1,500 
civilian vacancies will not be filled and the number of soldiers 
serving for a fixed period will be reduced by 400 to 213,800.

  [Text] The Bundeswehr will not be able to participate in 
any further missions abroad for the time being. This is 
intended to save some 100 million German marks [DM]. In 
addition, the Bundeswehr intends not to fill 1,500 positions 
that will fall vacant in the civilian sphere, to reduce the 
number of noncareer soldiers, and to extend the transfer of 
units to eastern Germany over a longer period of time. These 
are parts of the list of cuts intended to reduce the defense 
budget by DM1.25 billion.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Germany is to send four members of 
the Bundeswehr to Georgia as part of the UN observer mission 
(UNOMIG). Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel added in Bonn today 
that the observer group is to provide support in the creation of 
a permanent peace in Georgia. The deployment of the German 
soldiers is limited to six months. Vogel said it is the first 
UN deployment of this nature on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union and the first involvement of German soldiers in 
such a mission. 
  Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stressed that 
"preventive diplomacy" is becoming an increasingly important 
element in peacekeeping as the main aim of the United Nations. 
The mission in Georgia serves that purpose. As the first UN 
deployment on the territory of the former Soviet Union, it aims 
to back the efforts of the conflicting parties for a 
comprehensive political solution in Georgia. The conflicting 
parties have approved German participation in UNOMIG, he said.

<F P=106> [Report signed "rmc."/DW: "FDP Advocates Dividing </F>
Bundeswehr Into Two Parts"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Defense experts of the Free Democratic Party 
of Germany [FDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] have called on FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
(Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) immediately to present a new 
concept for the army. When a "position paper on the Bundeswehr 
after the year 2000" was presented yesterday, FDP security 
politician Guenter Nolting reproached Ruehe for a "thought ban," 
which is virtually in force in his ministry. Apparently, 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl (CDU) is only marginally interested in 
security policy and does not use his authority for guidelines. 
The FDP is concerned over the fact that the "lack of political 
targets set for the Armed Forces by the responsible ministry has 
led to inactivity without concepts." 
  SPD Defense Expert Andreas von Buelow also talked of a 
thought ban in the Defense Ministry. The Hardthoehe [seat of 
the Defense Ministry] rejected the reproaches as unfounded. 
Defense Minister Ruehe will publish "conceptual guidelines for 
the Bundeswehr" in April, a spokesman said. 
  In Nolting's opinion, the Bundeswehr has to play an 
important 
role within the framework of a joint foreign and security policy 
of the European Union (EU). During the presentation of the 
position paper, Nolting took the view that a European foreign 
and security policy "also has to represent European interests 
all over the world" in coordination with NATO. It is 
conceivable that the Bundeswehr then will also be confronted 
with new tasks. The FDP politician proposed dividing the 
Bundeswehr into two parts -- that is, into "national defense 
forces" with a training organization where draftees are trained 
in basic military service of "less than 12 months" and into 
"combat-ready armed forces" consisting of professional soldiers, 
long-term servicemen, and draftees serving a longer time (up to 
23 months). Buelow advocated reducing the basic military 
service to half a year and a troop of 100,000 professional 
soldiers.

<F P=106> [Report by Ruediger Moniac: "Ruehe Sacrifices High </F>
Technology"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Today, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, of 
the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], will give a detailed 
report in the Bundestag Defense Committee on the additional 1.25 
billion German marks [DM] in cuts that have been imposed on the 
Bundeswehr. Additional "severe cuts," particularly in the 
sphere of personnel and material, had become necessary, sources 
from the Defense Ministry in Bonn said yesterday. 
  The DM150 million that should have been spent on arms and 
equipment and has now been canceled, also affect the "Midas" 
project, which has been regarded as important by the Navy. 
Midas is a radar-controlled automatic gun for boats and ships 
for the defense against so-called seaskimmers, that is to say, 
missiles that attack a few meters above sea level. A total of 
DM40 million had been earmarked for the development of Midas in 
1994. 
  The cuts hit the Mauser company in Oberndorf/Neckar out of 
the blue. It had itself invested as much as DM40 million into 
developments. Within one year the weapons system could have 
been ready to go into production, company sources said. 
  Between the Bundeswehr and Mauser there is a development 
contract for Midas, which had been orally confirmed by the 
responsible state authorities last summer. The company has 
stated that, as a result of the recent Bonn decision to impose 
further cuts, which is also putting the "Bundeswehr Plan 95" out 
of force, the "contract is in the air." The "Midas case" is 
only one of a whole series that highlight the Bonn coalition's 
"entire dilemma of making cuts without a concept" in the sphere 
of the Bundeswehr, representatives of the business community 
said. According to experts, the automatic gun is one of the top 
products of German armament technology. By cutting the funds 
for development, Mauser is losing its "system ability" in this 
sector. The company of Oberndorf, which belongs to the Diehl 
group of Nuremberg, and has reduced its personnel of 1,500 in 
the past few years by half, can no longer keep experienced 
engineers and technicians. "Not only Midas shows that this is a 
dangerous spiral," one industrial expert emphasized: "The 
Bundeswehr no longer finances innovation, but puts the little 
money it has only into the maintenance of aging arms and 
equipment until everything comes to a halt. And then?" 
  The industry is losing is national and international ability 
for cooperation in the sphere of armament technology. The 
expert warned that at one point it will no longer be able to 
procure weapons for the German Armed Forces at home.

Large-Scale Orders"] 
  [Excerpts] Bonn, 31 January -- Economic relations will be 
the focal issue of a four-day visit to Germany by Indian Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao to begin on Wednesday [2 February]. 
German companies hope this visit will support their efforts to 
get large-scale orders from India. In return, Rao is working 
for German investment on the subcontinent. 
  One of the central issues of the talks in Bonn is the 
participation of German companies in expanding the power supply 
in India. This involves orders worth double-digit billion sums. 
Yesterday, Indian Energy Minister Salve explained to leading 
German installation constructors in Bonn his government's plans 
for expanding the energy supply. According to him, new 
construction is planned of seven conventional power stations 
with a capacity of 5,500 megawatts and an investment of 12 
billion German marks. In addition, seven existing power 
stations are to be modernized, that is, to be equipped with 
modern environmental technology. Furthermore, it is planned to 
expand India's mains distribution. [passage omitted] 
  During his visit to Bonn, Rao will take time for a 
"German-Indian economic conference," and for individual talks 
with the directors of Hoechst, BASF, Mercedes, and Siemens as 
well as with Volkswagen chief Ferdinand Piech. 
  The political talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, and Social Democratic Party Chairman 
Rudolf Scharping will focus primarily on coordinating a joint 
route toward the goal of the two countries getting permanent 
seats on the UN Security Council. The Germans will also be 
urging India to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

  [Text] Darmstadt -- Yesterday the Darmstadt Land Court 
acquitted the managing director and two employees of the former 
Karl Kolb group (Dreiech) of the charge that they had delivered 
poison gas plants to Iraq in the eighties. The multipurpose 
plants they exported were not especially constructed for the 
production of chemical weapons, it was stated. In its opinion, 
the court referred to unfit penal provisions. The proceedings 
led to the "bitter finding" that the FRG had made the export of 
weapons-grade chemical plants possible for 30 years. Four other 
employees of the firm will be sentenced today. With three 
managers of the former firm WET in Hamburg, one of the acquitted 
persons still has to answer for the export of an alleged bomb 
production line.

workers in the metalworking and electrical engineering industry 
in North Rhine-Westphalia had joined token strikes. The 
regional executive of the Wuppertal branch of IG Metall 
(Engineering and Metalworkers' Union) said the strikes are 
focused on the towns of Aachen, Gevelsberg, Gummersbach, 
Hattingen, Leverkusen, Luedenscheid, Olpe, Remscheid, and 
Wuppertal. 
  The largest rally was in Wuppertal, where 6,400 engineering 
workers marched through the streets to protest employers' 
demands for a workers' pay cut. The fourth round of 
negotiations ended last week without agreement on a date for 
their resumption.

<F P=106> [Report signed "ank": "Token Strikes in All Districts; Both </F>
Sides Ready for Talks in Conflict in Metal Working Industry"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 31 Janaury -- The metalworkers trade 
union IG Metall has used token strikes in all districts to 
underline its demands for wage increases of up to 6 percent and 
promises of job security. According to the trade union, over 
54,000 persons in 137 enterprises participated in the labor 
action. Zwickel, the chairman of the metalworking trade union, 
pointed out that the first working day after the end of the 
commitment to maintain industrial peace has shown how "angry" 
the employees in the metalworking and electrical industry are 
about the employers' calls for wage reductions. At the same 
time, he called on the regional employers to offer immediate new 
negotiations. The other side must now show flexibility. So 
far, only the metalworkers trade union has submitted substantive 
proposals at the negotiating table, Zwickel stressed. The trade 
union has presented proposals on the length and organization of 
working hours and suggested various models within the framework 
of area wage agreements. IG Metall has announced that it will 
spread its token strikes on Tuesday [1 February]. 
  Gottschol, president of the employers' association in the 
metalworking industry, stated: "We are ready to hold 
constructive talks with IG Metall at every level and at any 
place." The competitiveness of German enterprises can only be 
increased by lowering costs in the companies. Gottschol spoke 
in favor of a collective agreement that grants the enterprises 
great flexibility. He again stressed that 600,000 jobs have 
disappeared in the metal working industry since the spring of 
1991. Kirchner, the manager of the employers' association, 
appealed to IG Metall to assume its share of responsiblity for 
safeguarding jobs. A strike would be "socially irresponsible," 
Kirchner pointed out. 
  On Monday [31 January] officials from the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] and Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP] warned the parties to the collective agreements against 
industrial action. SPD Chairman Scharping called for more 
flexibility on the part of the employers. He also pleaded in 
favor of longer machine times that might be linked to shorter 
working hours. Full wage compensation is naturally not 
possible. SPD Deputy Chairman Lafontaine stated that strikes 
are not compatible with the current economic landscape. FDP 
Chairman Kinkel considers threatening industrial action as the 
"most dangerous and unfortuante development" imaginable. The 
wage settlement must be designed to create new jobs. Kinkel 
praised the agreement achieved in the chemical industry as a 
model, providing for wage increases of 1.5 percent and allowing 
the enterprises great flexibility over working hours. 
  On Monday morning, workers in Mainz, Ludwigshafen, Berlin, 
Neckarsulm, and a number of other towns went on strike for 
several hours. According to IG Metall, the strikes were most 
widespread in Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Lower Saxony, and 
West Berlin.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "SPD Chief 
Scharping: The CDU Urgently Needs Rest..."] 
  [Text] [BILD] Mr. Scharping, please tell us whom you would 
take into your government as ministers.... 
  [Scharping] Later! In addition to good women and men in 
political offices and functions, we also have excellent people 
in industry, for example: Karl Otto Poehl, Edzard Reuter, 
Manfred Lahnstein, and many others. They are experts! I also 
like to use their technical knowledge. 
  [BILD] What would you do differently if you were in 
government? 
  [Scharping] I would keep the ministers' salaries frozen for 
some time to come, reduce the number of ministries, and appoint 
fewer state secretaries. In the Construction Ministry alone, 
there are three state secretaries -- this is a pure waste of 
money. 
  [BILD] With which partner do you want to implement this? 
  [Scharping] This is a question about a coalition through the 
back door. If the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is 
the strongest party, then the coalition partners will all come 
by themselves. The will to participate in government is in the 
nature of the liberals, but also of the greens. 
  [BILD] ...and of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union [CDU/CSU]? 
  [Scharping] I want the CDU/CSU to have a period of 
regeneration, which it needs urgently -- and that in the 
opposition...! 
  [BILD] As things look, the next president will be Roman 
Herzog. Will the SPD withdraw Johannes Rau? 
  [Scharping] Johannes Rau is the best candidate for this 
office. In the Federal Assembly, there are enough sovereign 
women and men who orient themselves toward what is best for 
Germany and what is the desire of the overwhelming majority. 
Mr. Kohl initially wanted Johannes Rau, then Mr. Heitmann, and 
now Herzog. The first choice was and is the best. 
  [BILD] Must the more recent history of the SPD be rewritten 
after the revelations of Brandt's notes? 
  [Scharping] No, the accusation that Herbert Wehner did the 
work of the other side is slander. There is no evidence of 
that. Willy Brandt's widow has not done herself a favor. I am 
sad rather than outraged about this matter. 
  [BILD] Will Mrs. Seebacher-Brandt be expelled from the SPD? 
  [Scharping] I do not think that this is an appropriate way 
to settle the conflict. There is a party disciplinary procedure 
underway against her, however; I have no business interfering 
with the responsible arbitration committee.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ernst Uhrlau, head of the Hamburg Office for </F>
the Protection of the Constitution, by Nana Brink and Ludwig 
Rademacher; place and date not given: "`Uniform Movement'"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] Are we being deceived by the impression 
that the cooperation between German right-wing extremists, who 
have so far been rather divided, has achieved a new quality? 
  [Uhrlau] No, your impression is correct. Right-wing 
extremism in Germany is about to assume the character of a 
movement. 
  [FOCUS] What does that mean? 
  [Uhrlau] The point is the networking of right-wing extremist 
activities. Until the early nineties, we only knew this 
phenomenon on the left-wing extremist scene. Networking means 
that the individual groups remain independent and that political 
hierarchies are avoided. Politically active right-wing 
extremists hitherto longed for hierarchy and leadership. Now 
they are taking advantage of state-of-the-art communications 
technologies to mobilize people from different groups for action. 
  [FOCUS] Has your office underestimated the neo-Nazi who is 
equipped with a personal computer [PC], fax, and mobile 
telephone? 
  [Uhrlau] No, we have not underestimated him. However their 
position is different today and will continue to change. The 
traditional right-wing extremists of the eighties were much more 
at variance. Comprehensive media such as mail boxes and 
information telephone lines have sprouted tremendously over the 
past two years. While the "old" right-wing extremism remained 
static, so to speak, the protagonists of the new right-wing 
extremist tendencies, tactics, and strategies are using 
inexpensive modern communications technologies. After all, one 
can not forbid anybody the use of a fax, a PC, or mobile 
telephone. 
  [FOCUS] Can you give us an example? 
  [Uhrlau] It was only through mobile communications that the 
right-wing extremists were able -- as they had successfully done 
before in 1992 -- to redirect a demonstration on the occasion of 
the death day of "Deputy Fuehrer" Hess to the city of Fulda, in 
Hesse, in August 1993. 
  [FOCUS] Which ended in a political and a media spectacle. 
  [Uhrlau] The right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis are 
deliberately banking on the media to transmit their message. 
What is actually conveyed is of secondary importance -- the 
point is that they are present. I am greatly worried to see 
that some neo-Nazis have been idolized as "personalities of 
modern history" via the media. The media bear a special 
responsibility in this connection. 
  [FOCUS] After right-wing tumults, let us now talk about the 
intellectualization at the right margin. What about the 
Deutsches Rechtsbuero [German Legal Office], which offers legal 
advice to neo-Nazis? 
  [Uhrlau] That is part of the network. Via mail boxes one 
can also access court decisions, appeals for demonstrations and 
actions or the banning of such actions. The activities by 
right-wing extremist students are gaining in importance in this 
connection. 
  [FOCUS] Are right-wing extremist graduates getting ready for 
a march through the institutions? 
  [Uhrlau] We know that such plans exist in individual right- 
leaning fraternities. The difference is that such groups do not 
resort to Nazi patterns of justification but to the classic 
models of anti-democratic thinking such as Carl Schmitt and the 
Italian elite theorists. This can be found, for example in 
JUNGE FREIHEIT [YOUNG FREEDOM], which has set out to become a 
"TAGESZEITUNG [far left Berlin daily] of the right." This 
development is also a result of the fact that right-leaning 
high-school leavers entering the universities are finding the 
political field there lying fallow. 
  [FOCUS] And their objective is to march through the 
institutions? 
  [Uhrlau] If one understands oneself as a movement, there is 
either the parliamentary or the extra-parliamentary approach. 
The path into the institutions requires a strong representation 
in parliament. According to this concept, it is necessary to go 
into the institutions -- just as was tried by the generation of 
'68. 
  [FOCUS] Are you in favor of a new radicals decree? 
  [Uhrlau] No, the existing instruments are sufficient.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "Davos -- No `Magic Mountain'"] </F>
  [Text] The way from Oslo to Davos was an ascent only in 
the physical, not in the political sense. It makes one wonder 
what drove the two climbers, Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat, to 
exchange peaceful Norwegian country houses for the media 
spectacle at the World Economic Forum in Davos. If the "miracle 
of Washington" -- the Rabin-'Arafat handshake of 13 September -- 
has taught us anything, it is the obligation to be discreet. 
Major conflicts, such as the Arab-Israeli one, are not solved 
at CNN speed -- and especially not in a forum that invites 
participants to pose for the media rather than engage in hard 
work to increase mutual confidence. 
  Thus, Peres and 'Arafat could meet the world press hand in 
hand, but they could not present an agreement on enforcing the 
autonomy accord to the world policy groupies. They only got 
"very close." Foreign Minister Peres, a poet manque, cannot have 
read his "Magic Mountain" properly, which he quotes as a symbol 
for rising and overcoming problems. Thomas Mann's novel was 
inspired by his wife's stay at a Davos sanatorium. He describes 
the "Magic Mountain" as a mystical, dreamy world -- the absolute 
opposite of the "flat country," where, just as in real politics, 
sobriety and reality prevail. The two ideological opponents, 
Naphta and Settembrini, "are both great wafflers," whose fierce 
debates turn into "major irritability." Finally they fight a 
duel: One fires a shot in the air, the other -- Naphta -- shoots 
himself. The more modest mountains of Norway would have 
provided a happier metaphor. 
  But this is not the right time for literary excursions. 
Although the appearance in the snow failed, the model worked 
out in the Norwegian solitude last year continues to be the 
right one. What is more, the hand-in-hand appearance in Davos 
once again showed dramatically how strong the impulse for peace 
is. There is no doubt that Peres and 'Arafat want 
reconciliation. The only question is whether they are able to 
achieve peace in their negotiations. 
  The "big success" achieved in Washington avoided the crucial 
question "Who will get what, when, and where?" And this is 
bothering the negotiators now -- not because the devil is in the 
nuts and bolts, but because the principle is in the nuts and 
bolts. For the Israelis, the first principle is security, and 
the second -- although not forever -- avoiding an "independent 
Palestinian state" (Rabin). 
  For the Palestinians, however, the foremost principal is a 
"state" -- as much of it and as quickly as possible. The 
security of Israel and the settlers hardly bothers them. What 
is worse, since 13 September the number of terrorist attacks has 
soared, and escalation remains a latent option to make the 
Israelis withdraw from Jericho and Gaza more quickly. After 
all, 'Arafat has not yet brought himself to condemn the attacks 
clearly. 
  This is why Peres and 'Arafat have to fight the agonizing 
expectations hand in hand. The Israelis expect the journey to 
peace not to be paid for with less security -- and this is the 
reason for the seemingly endless disputes about who controls the 
borders of the autonomous regions: The Jordan -- which is only 
a few meters wide anyway -- must not become a channel for 
weapons. Also, they are not convinced that hand-holding 'Arafat 
has his own clients in hand. 
  The Palestinians who want to wrest more democracy from him 
are mostly those who accuse 'Arafat of "selling out to the 
Zionist enemy." They want the state here and now, forgetting 
that such a state cannot be created in Oslo or Davos, but only 
in the blood- soaked strip of land between the Mediterranean and 
the Jordan River. There, in their day-to-day lives, Israelis and 
Palestinians will have to realize that the other does not want 
to overpower them. This conflict cannot be solved by a stroke of 
the pen, but only by a daily demonstration of "live and let 
live." 
  The appearance of the Davos duo has created misleading 
confidence in this respect: Neither Rabin-Peres, nor 'Arafat 
can rely on their followers at the moment. If elections were 
held in Israel today, Rabin would be very likely to lose. 
Whether the one-man-regime 'Arafat would pass such a test is an 
open question. This is why the adversaries could not keep up 
the momentum of Washington, why symbols are no longer enough, 
and why each detail is being bargained over. 
  But this may be the very reason why the descent from the 
"Magic Mountain" should not be sneezed at. Israel and the PLO 
have to get back to the "flat country," which has virtually to 
be surveyed with a tape measure: Who gets which road, which 
allotment? What are the conditions for extending the autonomy 
area, both geographically and politically? The more precise the 
rules, the fewer the reasons for dispute. And the fewer the 
spectators, the greater the chances for a peace that nobody 
could even have dreamed of a year ago.

  [Text] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
alternate special representative, began a new round of 
consultations on the Cyprus issue with a meeting with President 
Glavkos Kliridhis this morning. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Gustave Feissel said that 
he had a good discussion with President Kliridhis. Feissel 
noted: President Kliridhis reaffirmed that the Greek Cypriot 
side accepts in principle the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's] as outlined in Paragraphs 37, 38, 42, and 43 of the UN 
secretary general's report of 1 July 1993. He also said that he 
looks forward to hearing from Mr. Butrus-Ghali on how the 
process is to move ahead, given the positive reply by the two 
sides. 
  Responding to a question on President Kliridhis' reaction to 
the second letter from Rauf Denktas, Mr. Feissel said that it is 
known that the secretary general and the Security Council are 
guided by the Security Council resolutions. He remarked: There 
is nothing new in this. Answering another question on whether 
Denktas' second letter had been conveyed to the secretary 
general in the correct manner, Mr. Feissel said that President 
Kliridhis knows that Rauf Denktas has accepted the CBM's in the 
same manner. Feissel added: The next step will be to brief the 
secretary general on all the developments and then, I imagine, 
Mr. Butrus-Ghali will convey his views, suggestions, and 
appraisal on how we should proceed. Asked if he has any dates 
in mind, Feissel said that he will not make any forecasts but 
added: Both sides have now given a positive response to the 
CBM's as they are outlined in the [secretary general's] report 
and it is up to Mr. Butrus-Ghali to express his views to both 
sides. 
  Mr. Feissel further noted that a significant element is that 
time is valuable; therefore, we should then proceed with the 
main goal of the process, which is to reach an overall 
settlement. Asked if the three questions raised in President 
Kliridhis' letter were discussed, Mr. Feissel said that Denktas' 
reply to this correspondence is categorical and added: Rauf 
Denktas says that he accepts everything that is in the four 
paragraphs of the secretary general's report. Responding to a 
remark that Denktas is invoking principles, Mr. Feissel said 
that the key is how we accept and interpret the replies by the 
two sides. Responding to a question on whether he expects 
negotiations to begin before or after the secretary general's 
report at the end of February, Mr. Feissel said that he believes 
things will have advanced a considerable degree by then. Until 
then, the Security Council will wait for the Butrus- Ghali 
report so that it may proceed with a detailed review of the 
situation. Asked about Joe Clark's report, Feissel said that 
the report will be submitted to the secretary general on 
Thursday [3 February] at the latest. 
  In conclusion, Mr. Feissel said that yesterday evening he 
had 
a meeting with Mr. Robert Lamb who, he added, had come to Cyprus 
to support the secretary general's efforts. 
  In a statement after President Kliridhis' meeting with 
Gustave Feissel, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said 
that they made an analytical assessment of the situation 
following the contacts Mr. Clark and Mr. Feissel had in Athens 
and Ankara. Kasoulidhis added: We are waiting for 
Butrus-Ghali's reply to the second letter from President 
Kliridhis on his position concerning the CBM's. 
  Gustave Feissel will have a meeting with Rauf Denktas this 
afternoon. 
  Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special Cyprus 
coordinator, also began a round of contacts in Nicosia this 
morning. Robert Lamb met with President Glavkos Kliridhis at 
approximately 0900 today. Robert Lamb avoided making any 
statement after his meeting with President Kliridhis. He merely 
said that he thinks that talks might be starting now. Lamb 
noted: We probably are starting the process of talks. 
  Commenting on Robert Lamb's statement that the talks might 
be 
starting now, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that 
the discussion had not yet begun. 
  Robert Lamb then left for the occupied areas to meet with 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the Turkish 
Cypriot side is ready to hold contacts on the 
confidence-building measures. He added that the Turkish Cypriot 
goal is to attain results. 
  Denktas received Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's 
special Cyprus coordinator, this morning and conferred with him 
for about an hour. Also present at the meeting were Atay Ahmet 
Rasit, foreign affairs and defense minister; Ozer Koray, under 
secretary of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministry; 
presidential advisers; U.S. Ambassador in Lefkosa [Nicosia] 
Richard Boucher; and Joe Merante, head of the U.S. State 
Department's Cyprus desk. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that the 
meeting was held within the framework of the letters sent to the 
UN secretary general. Pointing out that the committees 
assessing the confidence-building measures from a technical 
viewpoint are expected to submit their reports by 15 February, 
Denktas added that the essence of the issue will be determined 
in the light of these reports and that steps will be taken 
accordingly. Commenting on the meeting, Denktas said: We had 
questions and we received replies. They had questions and we 
replied. He added that the problem cannot be solved by issuing 
statements. Pointing out that the Turkish Cypriot side has 
accepted the principles of the confidence-building measures, 
Denktas added, however, that the people must see what the 
package consists of before they accept it. He noted that the 
agreement to be reached should please both sides, adding that it 
is only through negotiations that one can realize whether such 
an agreement can be concluded. 
  Assessing Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis' objection to 
Denktas' use of the logo "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" 
in his letter to the UN secretary general, Denktas recalled that 
he has been signing letters with logos for the past 20 years and 
added: Kliridhis has probably been losing sleep over them for 
the past 20 years. 
  Denktas stated that all the political parties in south 
Cyprus 
are opposed to the confidence-building measures, stressing that 
this opposition is the real source of Kliridhis' concern. 
Denktas drew attention to the fact that Kliridhis, who declared 
his consent to discuss the measures because he thought Denktas 
would reject them, is in a difficult position as a result of the 
positive Turkish Cypriot response. 
  In reply to a question, Denktas said that if the necessary 
foundation is built following the indirect talks, they can then 
go to New York. He added that he may visit Turkey, depending on 
the developments in Cyprus, but that a date has not yet been 
fixed. 
  In turn, Lamb said he held a beneficial and constructive 
meeting with Denktas but did not want to make a statement at 
this stage. He added that he may hold a news conference at 
Ledra Palace tomorrow in order to give information on his 
contacts in Cyprus. Lamb, who held a meeting with Kliridhis 
this morning, is expected to leave the island tomorrow.

  [Text] Egyptian President Husni Mubarak has arrived in 
Ankara on a one-day working visit. He was received at Ankara's 
Esenboga Airport by President Suleyman Demirel. Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin was also present. 
  An official reception for President Mubarak was held at the 
Cankaya Mansion. After the national anthems of both countries 
were played, the two presidents inspected the honor guard. 
  Present at the ceremony were Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of 
the Turkish Grand National Assembly; General Dogan Gures, chief 
of the General Staff; Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the Motherland 
Party; and other officials. 
  Speaking at the ceremony, Demirel said that this visit, 
which 
is taking place at a time of important developments in the 
region, will constitute an opportunity for a beneficial exchange 
of views between the two countries on regional and international 
issues of concern. He pointed out that there Turkey and Egypt 
have deep-rooted ties based on a common history and cultural 
heritage, adding: There are many similarities between Turkey 
and Egypt. They have coasts on the Mediterranean. They are 
trying to further their social and economic development on one 
hand and to establish peace and stability in their region on the 
other. Consequently, Turkey and Egypt constitute factors of 
balance and stability in the Middle East. 
  Demirel stressed that Egypt plays an important and effective 
role in the efforts being made to establish peace and stability 
in the Middle East. We appreciate Egypt's efforts in this 
regard, he said, adding that there are many things Turkey and 
Egypt can do together in the political and economic fields in 
the Middle East, which is being reshaped. 
  In turn, Mubarak said that both countries carry weight in 
the 
Islamic world and that they pursue a common policy on 
international issues. Both countries are determined to make 
every effort to help establish a just and lasting peace in the 
Middle East. 
  The two presidents then conferred for some time, after which 
the talks between the delegations began. 
  Accompanying President Mubarak are Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa; Electricity and Energy Minister Muhammad Abazah; Sulayman 
Tantawi, minister of defense and war production; Information 
Minister Muhammad Safwat al-Sharif; and Mahmud Muhammad Bayyumi, 
minister of economy and foreign trade. 
  Demirel is now giving a luncheon in honor of the visiting 
president at the Cankaya Mansion. 
  President Mubarak is expected to leave Turkey this evening.

  [Text] Ankara (AA) -- The official talks between the 
Turkish and Egyptian delegations held at the Cankaya Mansion, 
headed respectively by President Suleyman Demirel and President 
Husni Mubarak, have ended. 
  Replying to reporters' questions after the talks, Egyptian 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa declared that Turkey's role in the 
Middle East peace process is very important and that Ankara's 
contributions are necessary to accelerate the process. 
  Pointing out that cooperation is being conducted with Turkey 
and other regional countries in a bid to secure a just and 
lasting solution in the Middle East, Musa said: "We hope that a 
kind of peace which will please all people in the region will be 
attained soon." 
  Asked if there is a deadlock in the peace process between 
Israel and the Palestinians, the Egyptian foreign minister 
responded: "There is no deadlock. There are only minor 
differences of opinion." 
  In reply to a question of whether Demirel was asked to 
mediate, Musa said: "What we need for now is not mediation, but 
negotiations. Turkey and Egypt are exerting diplomatic efforts 
to secure a lasting and definitive peace in the area." 
  In his statement, Muhammad Bayyumi, Egyptian minister of 
economy and foreign trade, announced that Turkey, Egypt, and 
Saudi Arabia will cooperate in the fields of commerce and 
investment. 
  Various investment projects, which will create more job 
opportunities for the people in the region, are on the agenda, 
Bayyumi remarked, adding that more cooperation and investments 
are needed for the development of the region and this subject 
was also discussed during the bilateral talks. 
  After the talks, Mubarak returned to the Sheraton Hotel. 
  Mubarak will separately receive Prime Minister Tansu Ciller; 
Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime minister; and 
Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A press release was issued 
this afternoon in connection with the Turkish-Egyptian talks 
held in Ankara today. The press release stated that the two 
countries agree on the protection of the territorial integrity 
of Iraq and the other regional countries. 
  The press statement stressed that a historic opportunity 
which should not be missed is at hand with regard to the Middle 
East peace process, adding that efforts and support will 
continue for the establishment of peace in the region. 
  Commenting on the situation in the Balkans, the statement 
remarked that the minimum conditions must be created for the 
state of Bosnia-Herzegovina in securing lasting peace in this 
region. The sides agreed that the arms embargo imposed on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must be lifted if the aggression continues, 
the statement declared. 
  Pointing out that the situation in the Caucasus was also 
discussed during the talks, the statement expressed the concern 
felt over the tragic situation faced by the displaced 
Azerbaijani people. 
  During his contacts this afternoon, Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak received Prime Minister Tansu Ciller at his hotel and 
conferred with her for some time. Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin, Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, and prime minister's 
chief adviser Volkan Vural also attended the meeting, which 
lasted 45 minutes. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Ciller said that joint 
action between Turkey and Egypt with regard to the 
reconstruction of the Middle East and to the peace process was 
discussed during the meeting. This process may turn into 
tripartite talks with the participation of Saudi Arabia in the 
coming days, Ciller announced. Ciller reported that she invited 
Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi to Turkey, adding that the 
issues will be discussed in more detail during this visit. 
  The visiting president then received Murat Karayalcin, state 
minister and deputy prime minister. At the end of the meeting, 
Karayalcin said that a very fast economic and social development 
process will begin in the Middle East countries in the next year 
or two. Turkey and Egypt will assume important roles in this 
context, he added. Underlining that a peaceful atmosphere is 
necessary for economic and social development in the Middle 
East, Karayalcin remarked that the further strengthening of 
Turkish-Egyptian relations will benefit regional peace. 
  Mubarak also met with Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz, 
who declared that the situation in Iraq was assessed with the 
Egyptian president and that the latter attaches importance to 
the preservation of Iraq's territorial integrity. Yilmaz noted 
the benefits of closer Turkish-Egyptian cooperation in the 
security field for the maintenance of stability in the Middle 
East.

  [Text] Egyptian President Husni Mubarak left Turkey after 
his contacts in Ankara this afternoon. He was seen off at 
Ankara's Esenboga Airport by President Suleyman Demirel. 
General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff; State Minister 
Cemil Erhan; Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin; and Veysel Atasoy, 
energy and natural resources minister, were also at the airport. 
  Mubarak and Demirel made statements to the media at Esenboga 
Airport and answered questions. In his statement, Mubarak said 
that bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields were 
discussed during the talks. Noting that regional and 
international issues were also assessed, the Egyptian president 
remarked that Bosnia-Herzegovina and other topics, especially 
the Middle East, were the subjects of discussion. Turkey and 
Egypt reached agreement on all issues of focus, Mubarak 
announced. He stressed that Egypt also shares Turkey's 
long-standing views regarding the protection of Iraq's 
territorial integrity. From now on, Mubarak explained, the 
visits between Turkey and Egypt can be held naturally, without 
adherence to rules of protocol. 
  In reply to a question on whether Turkey was asked to play a 
special role concerning Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, Mubarak 
said that Egypt has diplomatic relations with Israel and did not 
submit any demands to Turkey in this regard. Mubarak remarked: 
There is no problem between Egypt and Israel that needs 
mediation. The Egyptian president declared that if necessary 
consultations can be conducted with Turkey on any subject. 
  In his statement, Demirel declared that the talks conducted 
during Mubarak's visit demonstrated the great scope of the 
potential for the development of Turkish-Egyptian relations. 
This visit also showed what can be squeezed into one day, 
Demirel noted. The president went on: If peace prevails in our 
region, this will benefit everyone. To achieve this, Turkey and 
Egypt -- the two big countries in the region -- will exert every 
possible effort. In actual fact, as the two big countries in 
the region, we hold ourselves responsible for the establishment 
of peace in this area as soon as possible. We hold ourselves 
morally responsible. Therefore, we will certainly exert joint 
efforts for the successful outcome of the Middle East peace 
conference. Actually, Mr. Mubarak has played an immense role in 
this regard and will continue to do so. We hope that this 
matter will yield results this year and new horizons will be 
opened for the region. 
  Pointing out that Mubarak's visit created new horizons for 
the relations between the two countries, Demirel pledged that 
Turkey and Egypt will continue to make contributions both to 
their own people and to the people in the region.

  [Text] Security forces have launched the second stage of 
their operation against the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] 
after Turkish military aircraft bombed the Zhalah camp in 
northern Iraq. The special units and the snow and mountain 
commandos commanded by high-ranking officers, who were already 
on a state of alert in southeastern Turkey, moved to begin their 
operation, code-named "Destroy," under falling snow yesterday 
morning. Several snow vehicles acquired from the United States 
are being used in their operations. 
  The security forces have intensified their operations in the 
triangle between Diyarbakir's Lice and Hani districts, Bingol's 
Karliova and Genc districts, and Mus. They have also 
intensified operations on the heights of the Gabbar, Namaz, and 
Cudi mountains. It has been reported that hit-and-run attacks 
have been organized against predetermined PKK shelters in the 
region under unfavorable winter conditions. 
  Specially trained civilian security teams have intensified 
their operations to control the intercity highways as a 
precaution against any move by the PKK to block them. 
  Meanwhile, the planned reconnaissance flights over the 
border 
areas and the Zhalah camp have been postponed because of weather 
conditions. A high-ranking official who prefers to remain 
anonymous has recalled the government's view that 1994 will be a 
year of determined struggle against the PKK. He said: "The 
security forces will carry out spontaneous cross-border ground 
and air attacks in the future. The attack on the Zhalah camp 
has destroyed the PKK's training center. It also removed the 
logistics support that camp gave to PKK units in Turkey. Turkey 
is able to monitor the movement of PKK militants through its 
satellite systems. We waited for an opportunity for a long 
time. Significant blows will be inflicted on the PKK 
terrorists, who have withdrawn to their shelters because of the 
winter. The established targets will be quickly destroyed."

<F P=106> [By PRESS ASSOCIATION correspondent Chris Parkin, from New </F>
York] 
  [Text] Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was today spreading 
a message of peace across the United States as he embarked on 
the second day of a visit to New York. 
  Mr Adams -- granted a visa by President Bill Clinton after a 
20-year ban on entering the U.S. because of alleged terrorism 
links -- re-stated his peace message in a breakfast-time 
coast-to-coast television interview. 
  "My aim is to see an end to violence," the leader of the 
IRA's political wing told the Good Morning America programme. 
  "But there are no simple solutions to the position in 
Northern Ireland. We are at a very critical phase at the moment. 
  "What we want to do is to remove the gun permanently from 
Irish politics, to develop a process in my country which allows 
the people of Ireland and Britain to live in harmony, which 
allows the Irish people -- all of us, unionist, nationalist, 
catholic, protestant, dissenters -- to shape out a future which 
reflects all of our own interests." 
  As Mr Adams was speaking terrorist activity continued in 
Northern Ireland. 
  The IRA mounted a mortar bomb attack on troops at a major 
checkpoint on the main Belfast-Dublin Road outside Newry, Co 
Down. 
  Earlier, in Portadown, County Armagh, a Royal Ulster 
Constabulary officer was slightly hurt when he walked into a 
loyalist bomb trap intended for a Catholic family. 
  Mr Adams, whose visit to New York to address a high-powered 
conference on Northern Ireland is being given blanket coverage 
by the U.S. media, insisted when asked his view of the Downing 
Street Peace Declaration signed by Prime Minister John Major and 
Irish premier Albert Reynolds: "I am committed to taking 
everything in a positive way." 
  There was, he said, "no evidence at all" of a split within 
the republican movement, the IRA or Sinn Fein, on a response to 
the peace statement from the two premiers. 
  "Republicans want peace and want to move forward," he said. 
"We are committed to struggling for as long as it takes, but 
this conflict in Ireland could be over, providing the British 
co-operated in a process to end it." 
  Mr Adams gave the TV interview from his room in the plush 
Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York's Manhattan district. 
  The hotel will be the venue for today's Northern Ireland 
Conference, organised by the influential National Committee of 
American Foreign Policy. 
  Ulster unionist leaders have refused to take part in the 
debates because of the Sinn Fein presence, but Social Democratic 
and Labour Party leader John Hume and Dr John Alderdice of the 
Alliance Party will be there. 
  Mr Adams said the conference was "a unique opportunity to 
break the stalemate" and added: "I have commended President 
Clinton for giving me permission to come here." 
  When the interviewer asked Mr Adams whether he was or had 
been a "high-ranking IRA commander," the Sinn Fein chief 
replied: "That is not true at all. 
  "I am in a situation where in my own country I have been 
shot. I have been imprisoned without trial on a number of 
occasions. The only time I ever had a charge against me was for 
trying to escape from that imprisonment. 
  "I was charged with IRA membership and the Lord Chief 
Justice 
threw it out of court." 
  Adams, who failed in eight previous applications for visas 
to 
enter the U.S., dominated the front page of New York's tabloid 
DAILY NEWS newspaper. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES also put the Adams visit on the front 
page, and called the Sinn Fein man "an articulate IRA advocate."

  [Text] A government spokesman has dismissed the claim by 
the Ulster Unionist leader Mr. James Molyneaux that he 
neutralized key government proposals in the talks leading to the 
Downing Street declaration. In a statement the spokesman said 
it was important to put the record straight. Our political 
editor Donal Kelly: 
  [Kelly] Mr. Molyneaux made his claim in an interview in THE 
SCOTSMAN newspaper. He said that in talks with the British 
prime minister he had vetoed Dublin's proposals for a 
British-Irish convention which would have had power over a new 
northern assembly. 
  However, the government spokesman said that at no stage in 
the drafting of the declaration had such a body been proposed. 
The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, or convention, had 
always been intended as a consultative body, he said, and apart 
from the name change it was in all essentials what had been 
originally put forward. 
  The spokesman also said that the first draft of the 
declaration contained eight paragraphs, not 30 as claimed by Mr. 
Molyneaux. At the behest of the taoiseach [prime minister] 
three or four additional ones in the final document recognized 
Unionists' fears and concerns. He added that there appeared to 
be some confusion with the draft of the leaked Irish paper, 
which had never been submitted to the British Government, and 
which had been intended for the entirely separate talks process.

<F P=106> [Article by NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner: "New </F>
Chapter in NATO"] 
  [Text] NATO is occupying the center of attention again. 
You no longer see the headline: "Why Should NATO Exist?" Many 
countries wish to join our alliance or, at least, to develop 
closer ties with it. There is nothing surprising about this. 
Since our international scene is continuing to be shaken by 
instability and conflicts, people are reassessing the 
organizations that can effectively maintain their security, and 
NATO is one of them. In fact, it is the only collective defense 
organization operating in the entire world. But this is not 
NATO's sole attraction. After all, the alliance is the main 
security link connecting the West's two most important power 
centers. Hence it is the key factor for stability in an 
unstable world. No new security order in Europe can be imagined 
without our alliance. NATO remains the main forum in which the 
West can formulate and coordinate joint political decisions. 
Under its umbrella, the dynamism of European unification can 
develop. 
  Since the end of World War II, two new elements have been 
added to NATO's traditional role of collective defense. One is 
crisis control and peacekeeping operations; the other is the 
projection of stability toward the countries of Central and East 
Europe, and toward those of Central Asia. Our aim is to help 
them readjust their defense policies and to assist them 
throughout their difficult transitional stage. 
  No other international organization could replace NATO in 
these tasks. Only NATO has such an impressive set of political 
and military instruments for crisis control. Only the Atlantic 
Alliance has the means to transform political statements into 
coherent actions. Hence it is the basis on which any new 
Euro-Atlantic security structure should rest. The setting up of 
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the development of a 
new strategy, a new force posture, and a strengthened European 
pillar show the essential role which our alliance continues to 
play in Europe's security. 
  The summit which we have just held in January was an 
impressive demonstration of what can be achieved if the 
political will, energy, and creativity of North America and 
Europe are combined: What we did was no less than to open a new 
chapter in our alliance's history. Deepening the conclusions of 
the 1990 London and 1991 Rome summits, the NATO heads of state 
and government have given our alliance the necessary means and 
instruments to be able to face up to the challenges of post-Cold 
War Europe. 
  1) -- We reaffirmed the importance of transatlantic 
relations, as well as our unqualified support for the European 
security and defense identity. Transatlantic solidarity and 
European integration are not alternatives -- still less 
contradictions. Europe must acquire unity and strength in order 
to be able to take up the share of responsibility and leadership 
which rests with it in our alliance. This is to the benefit 
both of the alliance and of North America and Europe. The 
reform of NATO and European integration are interconnected. A 
stronger Europe and Western European Union [WEU], able to 
intervene, will make it possible to share responsibilities 
within the alliance more fairly, without jeopardizing its role 
as the main forum for consultation and prime instrument of 
European security. 
  2) -- We decided to effect important changes in our 
alliance's structures in order to make them more flexible and to 
enable the advantages which this offers to be turned to account 
more effectively in crisis control and in peacekeeping 
operations. Specifically, we will develop a concept which, if 
necessary, will enable the European allies' forces to operate 
under the WEU's aegis. However, more flexible structures will 
be of use for what we want only if we maintain an adequate level 
of well-trained and well-equipped armed forces, backed by 
adequate resources. The fewer means we have at our disposal, 
the fewer choices we will have. 
  3) -- We decided in principle to open the alliance to new 
members. Since our security is inseparably linked to that of 
the other European states, NATO remains devoted to the 
consolidation of the security and stability of the democratic 
states to the east of our borders. In launching the Partnership 
for Peace initiative, we have embarked on a process which will 
transform relations between NATO and the states joining in the 
initiative. This new program goes beyond dialogue and 
cooperation in order to attempt to forge a real partnership. 
With the speed and scope set by each country's wishes and 
ability, we will seek specific channels for joint planning and 
joint military maneuvers, and we will give these countries the 
opportunity to work with NATO's forces in fields such as 
peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Prompted by a desire 
for cooperation, we will also encourage transparency in defense 
budgets and democratic oversight of defense ministries. These 
measures, with the right of the partners for peace to consult 
with the alliance whenever they feel threatened, will afford the 
tangible benefits for security stemming from moving closer to 
NATO. We will be holding the first joint maneuvers with the 
partners for peace at the end of this year, and we will rapidly 
proceed to set up a division for the coordination of 
peacekeeping operations close to the headquarters of the allied 
forces in Europe and to NATO [as published]. 
  The Partnership for Peace is no substitute for joining NATO. 
On the contrary, we applaud the alliance's enlargement as part 
of an evolutionary process which will be to the advantage of 
security and democracy throughout Europe. The Partnership for 
Peace will help prepare the countries concerned for possible 
entry into the alliance. Hence putting this initiative into 
practice will be one of our main tasks over the next few months. 
Our prime aim is still to build a new Euro-Atlantic security 
architecture with Russia, rather than without or against it. 
Nobody should be isolated. We must build bridges, not barriers. 
  4) -- We decided that NATO should face up not only to the 
traditional security challenges but also to those emerging from 
new political and technological developments. This is 
especially true of the increasing danger posed by the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Stopping this 
proliferation by political and diplomatic means remains our 
priority, but this may not be enough. We must also seek adequate 
means of protection. For this reason, we have entrusted to the 
alliance's appropriate political and military bodies the 
formulation of an overall political framework for exploring the 
way in which NATO can best help achieve this aim. 
  The work will begin without delay, and a working program and 
list of priorities will be submitted to the foreign ministers 
within six months. 
  The important initiatives adopted at our last summit 
highlight the constant need for this alliance and its vitality. 
NATO has charted a course which will take it resolutely to the 
21st century.

  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has urged the 
international community to force India to end its atrocities in 
occupied Kashmir before a meaningful dialogue is held between 
Pakistan and India. She was speaking to a news conference held 
after she addressed the United Nations Commission on Human 
Rights in Geneva. Benazir Bhutto said she addressed the 
Commission in order to mobilize international public opinion and 
force India to take solid steps to allow human rights 
organizations into occupied Kashmir, release detained Kashmiri 
leaders, permit television crews and journalists to visit 
Kashmir, and reduce the number of troops there. She said the 
world should not ignore human rights violations in occupied 
Kashmir. Keeping this in view, it is imperative to implement 
the UN resolutions. This problem is pertinent not only for 
today, but also for the future. 
  When the prime minister was asked whether Pakistan will 
consider demands for a sovereign Kashmir, she said that no such 
demand has yet been made. This so-called demand will resurrect 
the entire issue of the 1947 partition of the subcontinent into 
an independent Pakistan and India. She said that while 
reviewing this demand, the demands for freedom by Sikhs, Tamils, 
and other groups in India should also be kept in mind. 
  The prime minister said that Pakistan has presented 
proposals 
to India at the international level time and again on the issue 
of nuclear nonproliferation, but India has rejected all of them. 
  Regarding her visit to Bosnia today, Benazir Bhutto said she 
and her Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller are visiting Bosnia to 
express their solidarity with Bosnian Muslims. She said their 
efforts are intended to ensure the implementation of the London 
Accord on Bosnia. She said that decisions to lift the arms 
embargo and implement a cease-fire should be made within the 
purview of the London Accord. 
  Earlier, addressing the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, 
Benazir Bhutto urged the international community to take steps 
to stop the carnage in occupied Kashmir and exert pressure on 
India to withdraw its troops from the occupied valley. She 
said: It is time for the international community to force India 
to release the Kashmiri leaders; lift all of its draconian 
emergency laws; stop its Army from committing atrocities in 
Kashmir; and allow international human rights organizations and 
representatives of humanitarian institutions and the mass media 
to visit occupied Kashmir, ascertain the facts, and provide help 
to the suffering Kashmiris.

<F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock by </F>
Alain Baron in Vienna; date not given: "Austrian Public Opinion 
Moves in Favor of Integration" -- first paragraph is LA TRIBUNE 
DESFOSSES] 
  [Text] After the first one in November in Paris, a second 
French-Austrian forum, held on 28 January in Vienna, brought 
together officials and economic decisionmakers from both 
countries to discuss Austria's integration into the European 
Union, which is scheduled for early 1995. A French-speaker and 
francophile, Alois Mock (christian democrat of the Austrian 
People's Party) is a fervent supporter of integration. 
  [Baron] Where do the negotiations on Austria's integration 
into the European Union stand? Will the deadlines be met? 
  [Mock] I am convinced that it is possible to conclude them 
positively by early March. There has been an enormous amount of 
work in view of the complexity of the problems tackled, 
especially in the area of agriculture. However, I am pleased 
that the Greek Presidency proposed a timetable that reflected 
the Community's intention. This desire matches ours. On 8 
February, we have a meeting with the three other applicant 
countries (Sweden, Norway, and Finland), and then a series of 
meetings beginning on 21 February and lasting until the end of 
the month. The Austrian referendum will take place afterwards 
and, if the outcome is positive, actual integration could take 
place on 1 January 1995. 
  [Baron] Just a few weeks ago, Austrian officials feared that 
public opinion would reject integration. Where do things stand 
today? 
  [Mock] Things change quickly; public opinion is very mobile. 
For two months, there has been a majority that is pretty much in 
favor -- especially following the recognition, which we obtained 
at the meeting on 21 December, that Austrian standards for the 
environment will be maintained. That had a very positive effect 
on public opinion. 
  [Baron] Once integrated, will Austria become the "leader" of 
the countries of Central Europe within the Community? 
  [Mock] That would be exaggerating our sway within the 
Community. However, we will indeed make our experience and 
knowledge of relations between the former free Europe and the 
European countries of the Danube Basin available to the 
Community bodies. 
  [Baron] You place a great deal of emphasis on the role of 
the 
regions in the Community. Why? 
  [Mock] In Austria there was an obstacle to European 
integration: The unjustified fear of bureaucratic centralism 
from Brussels that would wipe out individual features. We must 
consult each other and make decisions together on problems that 
affect the entire Community. However, we must also let the 
lower levels find their own answers to their own problems as 
much as possible. 
  [Baron] Are you referring to the principle of subsidiarity? 
  [Mock] Yes, of course. But this is not just a matter of 
subsidiarity. It is also an issue of democratic control.

<F P=106> [Article by Marie-France Cros: "Condemning the Embargo </F>
Against Cuba"] 
  [Text] SP [Flemish Socialist Party], PS [Walloon Socialist 
Party], CVP [Christian People's Party], PSC [Social Christian 
Party], Ecologist, Agalev [Live Differently] and Volksunie 
[People's Union] deputies have submitted a resolution proposal 
to the Chamber to object to the U.S. embargo against Cuba, 
propose the signing of a general agreement on economic and trade 
cooperation with the island, and increase humanitarian aid to 
its people. 
  The proposal stems primarily from foreign policy 
considerations. "The U.S. boycott of Cuba no longer has any 
reason to exist" at a time when communism has collapsed, believe 
the signatories to this proposal. Now that the Soviet Union has 
ceased to exist, Cuba's population is the principal victim of 
Washington's policy. The embargo "in fact stops Cuba from 
developing positively" and, on 24 November 1992, the United 
Nations General Assembly (with the exception of the United 
States, Israel, and Romania) called for it to be lifted. 
<H5>  Our Trade </H5>
  But the text submitted to the Chamber is also a response to 
domestic considerations. Since 1992, Washington has tightened 
its embargo as well as the Torricelli Law, which imposes trading 
restrictions on third countries. U.S.-owned or controlled 
companies based in Belgium cannot trade with Cuba, which is a 
barrier to Belgium's trade and "could even result in a second 
embargo on Belgian exports to the United States." 
  Although the Chamber of Representatives "is concerned by the 
human rights situation" in Cuba, it must "increase dialogue with 
Cuba at the European level with a view to promoting the process 
of reform which has already begun."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Ulster Unionist leader James </F>
Molyneux by Ewen MacAskill; place and date not given] 
  [Text] He is the second most powerful politician in 
Britain. But he keeps quiet about it, and is little known 
outside of Westminster. Not for him bursts of oratory in the 
Commons chamber, regular television soundbites or loud threats 
delivered outside Downing Street. His preference is for a much 
more effective course -- the short walk down a corridor in the 
Houses of Parliament for a private word in the Prime Minister's 
room. He is James Molyneux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, a 
shrewd wheeler-dealer, the ultimate Commons fixer. 
  He holds the balance of power in the present Parliament, 
just 
as he did in Callaghan's Labour government between 1974 and 
1979. The nine Ulster Unionist votes have saved John Major's 
Government since the general election in 1992 and will do so 
again. Everyone at Westminster believes Major and Molyneux have 
a secret deal, as journalists like to describe it, or an 
understanding, as MPs prefer to put it: the result is the same 
however it is described, the survival of the Major Government. 
  Given the immense power he holds, Molyneux's behaviour over 
the last few months has been puzzling. Why has this man, 
steeped in the Unionist tradition, the leading voice of Ulster 
Protestantism, been so relaxed about the Downing Street 
Declaration? Surely, an agreement between London and Dublin 
talking about self-determination for the whole island of Ireland 
would have sent a shiver through the man who holds a senior 
position in the Orange Order, Sovereign Grand Master of its 
Royal Black Preceptor? 
  Yet on the December day that the declaration was announced 
Molyneux had little to say, in contrast to the Rev lan Paisley, 
leader of the smaller, hard-line Democratic Unionist Party, who 
denounced it as a sell-out to "buy off the fiendish Republican 
scum." 
  One piece of speculation was that Molyneux, aged 73 and 
possibly coming close to retirement, wanted a legacy, a peace 
settlement for Northern Ireland, to go down in history as the 
man able to rise above his own particular brand of politics, an 
Ulster Gorbachev. As a piece of speculation, it is complete 
nonsense. 
  In a lengthy interview with THE SCOTSMAN, Molyneux explained 
in detail for the first time why he was so relaxed about the 
Downing Street Declaration. The reason was not that he had 
mellowed but that he had successfully fought the Unionist 
corner. He told how in behind-the-scenes meetings with the 
Prime Minister, an original 30-paragraph Irish document was 
slashed down to the 12 paragraphs that eventually appeared. He 
neutralised it, removing anything of any substance, any 
mechanisms that would have required action or set up joint 
British-Irish structures. The final declaration was "a muddled, 
tortuous one," and "while one didn't like the wording, it didn't 
pose any threat to the Union." 
  The naive optimism that greeted the Downing Street 
Declaration, a hope that it would bring an end to the killing 
fields, has long since dissipated. Molyneux's explanation of 
how he neutered the document explains why. He does not believe 
the Irish Republican Army will accept the document. 
  "I never did think they would do it. They might have been a 
bit more sympathetic if the British Government had agreed to the 
30 paragraphs.... Once it was denuded of the mechanisms, it was 
no good for them," he said. 
  Critics of Molyneux, while acknowledging his shrewdness and 
political skill, say his biggest failure is his inability to 
take the wider view of Irish politics. A member of the Social 
Democratic and Labour Party, Northern Ireland's democratic 
nationalists, complained: "We are interested in the 
relationship between Northern Ireland and Dublin. He is only 
interested in who rules in Northern Ireland." 
  The other complaint is that he is too fond of Westminster. 
"He is very proud of being Right Honourable and will get a 
peerage in due course," said one source close to Northern 
Ireland politics. 
  This is true. But there is more to Molyneux's interest in 
the Commons than just prestige: Molyneux has used it as a 
powerbase, not only to consolidate Unionist power but to 
strengthen it. 
  He has only once made a mistake, when he misread Thatcher. 
He did not believe she would sign the British-lrish agreement 
of 1985; but she did. He has not made any mistakes since, at 
least from a Unionist point of view. 
  Molyneux's public visage is usually blank or mournful 
looking, typically Presbyterian, though in private he is 
cheerful and is often described as clubbable, the Westminster 
phraseology for being easy-going. To Molyneux, having a blank 
face is a compliment. He tells of how a party colleague, John 
Taylor, turned to him after they had won a key vote, with order 
papers being waved all around them: "The trouble with you is 
that we can never tell whether you are glad or sad about 
anything." 
  Molyneux said that on that occasion, as on others, he was 
thinking ahead, his mind already moving on to battles that lay 
ahead: not for him exuberant displays or histrionics on the 
night of a famous victory. Politics, for him, is about 
patience, about taking the long view. 
  Molyneux, as part of the price of supporting Major, has 
succeeded in blocking proposals to privatise water in Northen 
Ireland and in gaining agreement on a select committee for 
Northern Ireland affairs, seeing the latter as a way of bringing 
even closer ties to the mainland. 
  But his greatest service to Unionism came in the months 
running up to the Downing Street Declaration. He said the 
document first surfaced in the Irish Press on 19 November, 
consisting of 30 paragraphs and confirmed by the Irish 
Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, as authentic. Paisley and other 
Ulster politicians went to see Major and made very public 
statements afterwards. 
  Molyneux made few such statements and instead saw Major 
about 
twice a week in private. He could barely conceal, during the 
interview, his sense of satisfaction at the outcome. The other 
party leaders have to ask themselves, said Molyneux, who was 
responsible for removing the contentious parts from the original 
Irish document. From memory, he recited in detail a paragraph 
that would have set up a joint British-Irish convention that 
would have exercised a lot of power over a Northern Ireland 
Assembly. 
  "Now this is not in the document. And now there isn't in it 
anything, as opposed to when there were 30 paragraphs, not even 
one cog or wheel of mechanism anywhere in it. It is just a 
muddled statement of principles and aspirations and all the rest 
of it but not a single commitment to do anything, unlike the 
Anglo-lrish agreement which says `there shall be established, 
the chief constable shall do this, that and the other, the army 
commander shall do this.' There is no `shall' or even `may' in 
it [The Downing Street Declaration]," he said. 
  His one concession was to Dublin's idea for a Forum for 
Peace, an all-lreland political convention. 
  "The only thing I reluctantly...not reluctantly but which I 
thought there was no harm in acquiescing to...was Reynolds 
having a forum `within his jurisdiction.' These words were put 
in deliberately. He can have a talking shop if he wants to. We 
are not involved. The British Government is not involved. They 
can do what they like. It is in their own sovereign territory." 
  He does not rule out a meeting with Reynolds, who sent him a 
"friendly" letter in December to which Molyneux sent a reply 
simply acknowledging receipt. But Molyneux is not particularly 
interested in relations between Northern Ireland and Dublin. 
What he considers to be much more significant is internal 
democracy and the talks have been underway since last September 
with the Northern Ireland minister of state, Michael Ancram, 
about setting up an Assembly. 
  This has attracted interest in Scotland, where the argument 
is that if Northern Ireland can have a legislative Assembly, why 
not Scotland. 
  But Molyneux makes it clear that while the Government may 
want a legislative Assembly, he does not, and what Molyneux 
wants, he invariably gets. His plan is for a nonlegislative 
85-member Assembly, a sort of glorified local government. It 
would be more like Strathclyde Regional Council than a 
full-blown Scottish Parliament as proposed by Labour. 
  If legislation was needed, this could be done by getting 
private bills put through the Commons, just as English councils 
do at present. He concedes that if the Assembly worked and 
became a mature body, there might in the future be a case for 
adding legislative powers. 
  Molyneux, who fought in the RAF [Royal Air Force] during the 
Second World War, found himself on the Normandy beaches on 
D-Day. It was partly an accident, having been transferred only a 
few days earlier by a commanding officer who did not like him. 
A lot of his life has been an accident. 
  He has been an MP since 1970 -- first for Antrim South and 
now for the Lagan Valley -- and leader of the Unionists since 
1974. 
  As Major's Commons majority of 17 dwindles further as a 
result of inevitable by-election defeats, Molyneux's role over 
the next few years will become more, not less, important. 
  In January 1985, Douglas Hurd, then Home Secretary, 
frustrated by the intransigence of Molyneux and Paisley, 
complained that "the Unionist tail cannot go on wagging the 
British dog forever." The British dog has never been so 
vigorously wagged as it is at present.

<F P=106> [Report signed "km": "Radio Active Material in Lake </F>
Constance?"] 
  [Text] Zurich, 31 January -- The search for a private 
plane that allegedly crashed last week over Lake Constance has 
been accelerated because it cannot be ruled out that radioactive 
material was on board. Police in the canton St. Gallen 
announced on Monday [31 January] that the likelihood "has 
increased considerably" that cesium or rubidium might be on 
board. However, all water samples taken at the Swiss banks near 
Altenheim have so far been negative. Rumors have meanwhile been 
confirmed that two of the five passengers who died in the crash 
were allegedly involved in illegal deals with radioactive 
materials. Two German businessmen reportedly acquired an 
unknown quantity of cesium and rubidium in the Latvian capital 
Riga in October 1993. They allegedly transported the material to 
Prague. There Interpol lost track of the dealers. It is not 
known whether the radioactive substances were really loaded onto 
the Cessna plane. According to reports, the plane was to stop 
at Altenheim airport (Switzerland); money for refueling had been 
transmitted from Prague. 
  Besides the pilot, the plane carried two women -- possibly 
from the Czech Republic. Authorities believe that the men may 
also have been involved in the smuggling of women. The 
businessmen from Berlin, a former owner of a construction 
company and a sports official of the former German Democratic 
Republic, apparently wanted to transport radioactive material to 
France via Switzerland, as was reported. 
  The cause of the crash was still unclear on Monday evening. 
The pilot made a contact flight because the weather was good. 
The plane is probably at a depth of 120-180 meters. The Swiss 
authorities hope to find the wreck with a special German ship in 
the next few days. A total of 4 million people in Switzerland 
and Germany up to the Stuttgart area are supplied with drinking 
water from Lake Constance.

<F P=106> [Editorial signed "Evvoulos": "What We Expect From Mr. </F>
Lamb"] 
  [Excerpts] The arrival of the State Department's special 
Cyprus coordinator is expected to dispel the clouds of confusion 
caused by the two letters of Rauf Denktas. This is because Mr. 
Robert Lamb, who earlier served as U.S. ambassador in Nicosia, 
is very well aware of the Cyprus issue and because he himself 
had declared unequivocally that the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's] "must be accepted as they are because they are fair." 
The same declaration was also made by President Clinton, thus 
emphasizing the U.S. stand in the most official manner. 
  President Glavkos Kliridhis demanded the rejection of 
Denktas' first letter, which contained obviously and even 
presumptively unacceptable terms. He also demanded that 
Denktas' second letter not be accepted; it bears the letterhead 
of the pseudostate and Denktas' signature in his illegal 
capacity as its "president." Kliridhis' demands are in full 
harmony with the U.S. stand, as well as with the UN secretary 
general's recommendations that neither side benefits at the 
other's expense from the implementation of the measures. 
  Security Council Resolution 541 does not recognize the 
pseudostate and calls upon all states not to recognize it. 
Thus, the attempt through Denktas' letters to receive a direct 
or indirect recognition proves that the measures are not 
accepted by the occupation leader as they are, except on the 
condition that the illegal invasion is legalized first. In 
other words, the key phrase "as they are" is provocatively and 
contemptuously trampled underfoot by Denktas. 
  This is why we attach great importance to the role and 
mission of Mr. Lamb because, as the representative of the sole 
superpower, it is expected that for reasons of prestige, 
consistency, and political order he will honor his declaration. 
  Besides, our side is expected to pay most of the economic 
cost for the implementation of the CBM's. However, for the 
"building" of the measures to be safe they cannot be founded on 
the shifting sands that are created by Denktas' retrogressions 
and demands for the consolidation and legalization of the 
occupation regime. [passage omitted] 
  In the meantime, we expect the U.S. envoy's prestige and 
influence will prove to be the determining catalysts and put an 
end to the unreasonable Turkish demands and distortions of the 
basis for a substantive dialogue. Mr. Lamb can and should make 
the truth shine and dispel the clouds of confusion.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has stated that Turkey 
would like the guns in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be silenced as soon 
as possible, adding that Turkey will continue to contribute in 
every way to achieve this end. Ciller further stressed the need 
to continue with the uninterrupted transport of humanitarian aid 
to the Bosnians. Ciller departed for Bosnia on a humanitarian 
visit this morning. 
  In a statement prior to her departure at Ankara's Esenboga 
Airport, Ciller stated that she will first visit Zagreb where 
she will meet with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. 
Ciller explained that they will depart for Sarajevo after being 
briefed by UN military officials. Indicating that their visit 
is solely for humanitarian purposes, Ciller said: A community 
in the midst of Europe has been waging a war of survival for the 
last two years, enduring great sufferings to protect their 
existence. Unfortunately, the world has been a silent spectator 
to this tragedy. The aim of this visit is to show the Bosnians 
once more that we have not forgotten them and to call on 
international public opinion to be more sensitive to this issue, 
our visit being another proof of our determination. 
  Recalling that the United Nations is constantly trying to 
extend humanitarian aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ciller stressed 
the need for the uninterrupted continuation of this aid. 
  Later, Religious Affairs Director Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz 
presented Ciller with 30,000 German marks and 250 copies of the 
Koran. 
  Ciller is accompanied by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin on 
her 
visit to Bosnia. Necmettin Cevheri, state minister and acting 
prime minister, several ministers, and other officials saw 
Ciller off at the airport.

<F P=106> [By PRESS ASSOCIATION correspondent Chris Parkin, from </F>
Dublin] 
  [Text] Sinn Fein chief Gerry Adams tonight moved closer to 
spelling out just what clarification he wants from Britain on 
the Anglo-Irish peace declaration ahead of an IRA response. 
  Mr Adams, continuing his high-profile first visit to the US 
in 20 years, listed three points connected with the December 
document signed by Mr Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert 
Reynolds which he said needed further explanation. 
  He told an influential New York audience these were: 

  -  Aspects of the declaration itself; 
  -  Contradictory 
statements about it made by the two premiers; 
  -  The issue of 
processes, measures and steps envisaged by the declaration. 
  He spoke out as the US administration sent what may well be 
a 
signal to him, by calling on all parties to the Northern Ireland 
conflict to embrace the Downing Street peace declaration. 
  The US statement, speaking of an "historic opportunity" to 
end the violence, was released after Vice President Al Gore met 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in Washington. 
  Mr Adams, the Sinn Fein president, listed his demands during 
an address to the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, 
the high point of his 48-hour stay. 
  He told an audience of 300 in New York's Waldorf-Astoria 
hotel -- venue for the Committee's conference on Northern 
Ireland -- that the US could make a "significant and positive" 
role to achieving peace. 
  But he accused the British Government of stalling by 
refusing 
to clarify the December 15 peace declaration. 
  But his statement brought a strong retort from Mr Major. 
  In the Commons, the Prime Minister accused Sinn Fein of 
"prevarications" and "evasions" about the ending of violence. 
  Mr Major said: "There has been no commitment by Mr Adams or 
the Provisional movement to end violence for good. 
  "That is the commitment that this House and everybody in 
this 
country and Ireland is waiting to hear." 
  Mr Adams was on day two of his visit, authorised by 
President 
Clinton against the wishes of the Major Government. He has 
conducted a series of coast-to-coast TV interviews amid huge 
press interest, as well as meetings with top American 
politicians. 
  He told his audience that Irish republicans had to decide 
whether the Anglo-Irish document was a first step for the 
British Government in the direction of lasting peace, or merely 
a political response by a government under pressure, aimed at 
avoiding a political confrontation with Dublin. 
  He said: "The Joint Declaration is described by its authors 
as `the first step' towards a peace settlement. 
  "Sinn Fein is committed to such a settlement and I am 
concerned -- I am indeed anxious -- to be persuaded that the 
Downing Street declaration can provide the basis for this. 
  "And even if this is not the case -- if there is a gap 
between what it required and what is on offer -- then we should 
all move to bridge that gap." 
  Mr Adams said the exercise of the right of Irish 
self-determination required a change in British policy and the 
removal of the veto on change in Northern Ireland held by the 
majority Unionist community. 
  He acknowledged the democratic rights of the Unionists, but 
claimed they would be upheld in an independent Ireland. 
  "The argument that the consent of a national minority, 
elevated into a majority within an undemocratic 
artifically-created state, is necessary before a constitutional 
change can occur is a nonsense," he said. 
  Mr Adams also claimed that the Downing Street declaration 
was 
a response to proposals made after a series of talks he had with 
Ulster's Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume 
last year. 
  He said it would be judged on whether it advanced the peace 
process or just a "cosmetic response" to that peace initiative. 
  There was a degree of suspicion and scepticism among 
nationalists and republicans regarding the real motives and 
intentions of the British Government. 
  He did not mention whether the IRA would declare a 
ceasefire, 
Britain's precondition for Sinn Fein's participation in peace 
talks. 
  Awaiting him back in Belfast was a letter he requested from 
Mr Reynolds clarifying the declaration from the Irish 
government's point of view. 
  He added that the British government's refusal to "provide 
clarification for Sinn Fein must be a matter of deep concern to 
everyone interested in peace." 
  "In contrast...it is clear that for the first time a Dublin 
government is making a serious attempt to address the issue of 
peace and a political settlement in the north of Ireland," he 
said. 
  "I wish to commend Albert Reynolds. He has taken a postive 
and commonsense attitude to the need to provide clarification. 
  "The potential for peace in Ireland has never been more 
realisable." 
  And he made clear that Americans and the Clinton 
administration could be actively involved in the peace process 
and bring pressure to bear on Britain to break the deadlock. 
  "Progressive opinion in the U.S.A. can assist in the 
development of a peace process in Ireland. The U.S. government 
can play a significant and positive role in encouraging the 
process by helping to create a climate that moves the situation 
on," he said. 
  He said the U.S. government could achieve that goal in two 
ways -- by facilitating the free exchange of information and, 
obviously referring to Britain, "actively seeking to encourage 
dialogue and agreement." 
  Mr Adams added: "It is clear that the British government 
have 
used all their influence, as in the past, to impede any progress 
on this or in any other matter which could influence or inform 
perceptions about the current situation in Ireland and the 
British government's responsibility for the present intolerable 
standoff." 
  He again praised President Clinton for permitting his visa 
to 
enter the U.S., and drew a parallel between the situation in 
Northern Ireland and current political moves in South Africa and 
the Middle East. 
  The lessons from those two areas were clear -- and "the 
conflict in Ireland is no different." 
  Mr Adams was the third of three Ulster political leaders to 
speak at the conference, behind the middle-of-the-road Alliance 
Party chief Dr John Alderdice and Mr Hume. 
  Absent, though, were Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist 
Party boss the Rev Ian Paisley and Ulster Unionist leader James 
Molyneaux. 
  Both stayed away in protest at the involvement of Sinn Fein 
and to underline their distaste at Mr Adams finally getting his 
visa. 
  The US statement released by the White House said Mr Gore, 
in 
his meeting with Mr Hurd, "underscored our admiration for the 
courage and vision of Prime Ministers Major and Reynolds in 
putting forward a new framework for peace in Northern Ireland." 
  "He (Gore) reiterated our conviction that the December 15 
Joint Declaration of the two governments provides an historic 
opportunity to end the tragic violence," the statement said. 
  "It provides a process by which all parties who eschew 
violence -- in deeds as well as words -- can participate in 
building a peaceful and prosperous Northern Ireland," it read. 
  Mr Gore also emphasised "the importance the U.S. attaches to 
close cooperation with our British ally on a range of global 
issues," the statement added. 
  British officials, although reportedly unhappy with the 
decision to reverse the 20-year policy and allow Mr Adams into 
the U.S., have not criticised Washington publicly. 
  In London, Mr Major declared that the peace initiative 
"leaves no conceivable excuse for violence." 
  "And all the words, all the prevarications, all the evasions 
of Sinn Fein will be utterly and completely hollow until they 
end violence." 
  Mr Adams was being subjected to only low-key security. 
Volunteer members of the New York police pipe ban were assigned 
to protect him "in a discreet way," according to security 
sources.

  [Text] Members of the Chamber of Deputies' Foreign 
Relations Committee have expressed their concern that the war in 
the former Yugoslavia could spread south. The deputies 
participated in a briefing on the agenda of the Greek presidency 
of the European Union. Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros 
Pangalos, who briefed the members of the Foreign Relations

Albanians. 
  [Begin Pangalos recording] We have every reason to believe, 
and we hope for it and try to use our influence toward it, that 
the Albanian side will show moderation. It is not logical to

not an active dispute right now, and Bosnia, where they are 
forced to take the steps that [words indistinct]. Let us hope 
that the Albanians, who have legitimate demands for autonomy and

that will create a conflict with consequences that can not be 
estimated. [end recording]

Baykal said yesterday in Thessaloniki that "certain steps" have 
been taken toward "resolution of the problems" of the Muslim 
minority in Thrace. However, once again he used the term 
"Turks" to describe the members of this religious minority. 
  In Thessaloniki, Baykal showed a different face than the one 
described in reports from Komotini and Xanthi. He was milder 
and more conciliatory. 
  At one point, he admitted that he did not express himself as 
he wanted to when, according to reports, he spoke in Xanthi 
about similarities between the Muslims in Thrace and...Bosnia. 
  The government yesterday condemned the incidents against 
Baykal in Thrace, where he was touring. Government Spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos advised Baykal to study the Treaty of 
Lausanne and international law and to keep in mind the Greek 
Constitution when referring to the "Turkish minority."

<F P=106> [Article by Nikos Marakis: "Athens' Realpolitik"] </F>
  [Text] Despite some of the different positions sometimes 
adopted by the prime minister and the competent ministers on the 
"Macedonian" issue, Andreas Papandreou's basic approach can 
essentially be summarized in two points. First, consigning the 
issue of the name to the future, and second, settling existing 
practical problems with Skopje on condition that the irredentist 
demands in that state's constitutional preamble be taken out and 
the Veryina star be expunged from its flag. If the conditions on 
the irredentist terms are fulfilled, Mr. Papandreou is willing 
to negotiate with K. Gligorov, even if in the past, when he was 
in the opposition, he had adopted an essentially different 
position. 
  The needs of the government's tactics in the Balkans are one 
of the reasons for the readjustment of the country's 
international alliances. Athens' "Atlantic shift" was obvious 
from the very first days of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement] government's accession to power. While since then the 
conviction that Greek interests are generally served by 
Washington's policy has remained strong, public statements have 
been toned down on account of the European reaction and the 
recognition of the level of dependence of the Greek economy from 
the EU [European Union]. However, first indications from the 
other side of the Atlantic raise some questions on the 
profit-loss relationship resulting from the reorientation of 
Athens' policy. 
  The "Macedonian" issue is a first criterion. It is expected 
that the State Department, within the context of the periodic 
policy review at the beginning of March, will propose to the 
U.S. Government the establishment of diplomatic relations with 
Skopje. Additionally, there has been reaction on the part of the 
United States to the European initiative to establish embassies 
in the new state. A harbinger of future moves is the decision to 
create a "liaison office" in Skopje, even if it lacks a 
diplomatic identity. Be that as it may, Greek credibility 
diminished after Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yiorgos 
Papandreou brought certain messages to Washington during his 
visit there, only to suffer a loss of prestige as soon as he 
mentioned their content publicly. The questions formulated by 
the U.S. side were many and have not all been answered. 
  U.S. support was also one of the most significant factors, 
which was seriously taken into account by the government's 
diplomatic officials in their efforts to build a "Balkan" role 
for Greece. The U.S. diplomats who visited Athens recently 
provoked some disappointment when they characteristically 
repeated their traditional stance on the very important 
geopolitical role of Turkey. For itself, Athens maintains its 
expectations because of Ankara's impossibility to efficiently 
manage the "fronts" it keeps open around its periphery. However, 
even today the Greek side has a clear difficulty in describing 
the "role" that Athens expects to undertake in the Balkans. 
  Of course, certain answers have already been provided: Greek 
diplomacy now clearly moves within the framework of a general 
attempt at appeasement and "lower tones." The development of 
economic relations with neighboring countries acquires higher 
priority and is seen as the cornerstone of any political 
influence in the region. At the same time that the logic of the 
establishment of an axis in the area is being rejected, a more 
"systemic" approach to intra-Balkan relations is being drawn up, 
within which is integrated the strategically important 
relationship with Belgrade, while communications with Croatia 
and Slovenia are becoming normalized. 
  While these measures constitute the necessary steps to leave 
the multiconflict period Athens has recently created in the 
Balkans behind, they are far from representing the description 
of a "role." The necessary system of goals of Greek foreign 
policy, the ways and means of implementing them, the acceptable 
obligations, and the expected competences remain subjects for 
which answers remains pending....

  [Text] Paris, Feb 1 (AFP) -- France and Saudi Arabia have 
reached three arms agreements worth about nine billion francs 
(1.5 billion dollars), the French Defence Ministry announced on 
Tuesday [1 February]. 
  The agreements, under discussion for the past four years, 
are 
for modernisation of warships and maintenance of missiles and 
radar systems, and should provide about 9 million hours of work 
for French industry and shipyards over the next six years, the 
ministry said. 
  The ministry said the three contracts had required a final 
go-ahead from the Saudis, and that go-ahead had been confirmed 
by Second Deputy Prime Minister Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz Al Sa'ud 
to French Defence Minister Francois Leotard. 
  The French announcement said that the confirmation was "the 
first concrete act resulting from the two countries' desire to 
strengthen their cooperation" after the visit to Riyadh by 
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur last January 8-9. 
  "The work and services needed for maintenance and 
modernization of the frigates and of anti-aircraft defence 
equipment will be undertaken as of this year, after payment of 
the first down- payment", it said. 
  An authoritative source said that to win the contracts, 
France agreed in its financial proposals in early January -- for 
the first time -- that the contracts did not need to be paid for 
at once, in the light of Saudi Arabia's cash position. The rate 
at which the jobs will be carried out reflects the "schedule of 
Saudi payments," which will be spread out over time, the source 
said. 
  The three Franco-Saudi contracts are: 
  1) The ROH contract, worth 3.5 billion francs, calling for 
modernization of four 2,000-tonne frigates and of two 
10,000-tonne tanker resupply ships sold in 1980 (Sawari 1 
contract). The renovation will be done in Toulon, on the 
southern French coast, by Direction des Constructions Navales 
(DCN). 
  The crews will remain on the six ships during the work, 
during which some equipment and on-board arms systems will also 
be modernized. 
  2) The SLBS maintenance contract, worth 3.4 billion francs, 
a follow-up on the 'Al-Thaked contract of 1984 for supply of 
short-range Crotale-Shahine ground-to-air missiles and of 30-mm 
bitubes. French manufacturers will supply spare parts and 
technical assistance. 
  3) The Shola maintenance contract, about 2 billion francs, 
for pyrotechnic kits (firing systems) intended for the 
short-range ground-to-air missiles already acquired by the 
Saudis. The program will make it possible to replace several 
hundred pyrotechnical propulsion lots relating to already 
delivered missiles, and includes technical assistance.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Defense -- Triple Contract With </F>
Saudi Arabia"] 
  [Excerpts] France and Saudi Arabia have entered into three 
armament contracts involving the upgrading of warships and the 
maintenance of ground-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft 
batteries, the Defense Ministry announced yesterday. [passage 
omitted] 
  The three contracts are as follows: 

  -  The ROH contract, 
worth Fr3.5 billion, provides for the upgrading of four 
2,000-tonne frigates and two 10,000-tonne refueling tankers sold 
in 1980 (Sawari I contract). The upgrading, to be carried out 
in Toulon (Var region) by the French Naval Construction Division 
(DCN), entails over 3 million hours of work for DCN and 1.2 
million hours for subcontractors and services suppliers 
(Thomson-CSF, Navfco). To this must be added the support 
services for the six ships' crews, which will remain on board 
during the whole upgrading process. To take full advantage of 
this period of inactivity, some equipment and on-board weapon 
systems will also be upgraded. 
  -  The SLBS (Logistical Support for 
Bitube and Shahine Systems) maintenance contract, worth Fr3.4 
billion, is the continuation of the 'Al-Thaked contract (1984), 
which provided for the provision of short-range ground-to-air 
Crotale-Shahine missiles batteries and bitube 30-millimeter 
weapon systems (complete with command stations, carriages, and 
radars). French manufacturers will supply spare parts and 
technical assistance. 
  -  The Shola maintenance contract, worth 
about Fr2 billion, involves rocket thruster units for 
short-range ground-to-air Shahine and Crotale missiles 
previously purchased by Saudi Arabia. The program provides for 
replacing several hundred thruster units intended for all 
missiles already sold, and includes technical assistance. Both 
missile-related contracts entail some 4.5 million hours of work, 
which will be distributed between project leader Thomson-CSF and 
its major subcontractors (Giat industrie, Renault Vehicules 
Industriels, Matra, SNPE [National Company for Powders and 
Explosives]).

<F P=106> [Interview with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur by </F>
Franz-Olivier Giesbert -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Balladur. At the 
end of the ministerial seminar, eight measures for economic 
recovery and against unemployment have hit France. There was a 
breath of optimism as well. Are you confident? Is our economy 
getting better? 
  [Balladur] Yes, indeed. And a number of figures show this. 
If you compare the situation ten months ago with what it is 
today, a number of improvements have appeared. The budget 
deficit is less than it was a few months ago, deficits in the 
social service budgets are much smaller, the deficit of the 
National Union for Industrial and Commercial Employment has been 
reduced to zero, interest rates have gone down by 40 percent, 
and -- more importantly -- we are gradually achieving growth, 
still timorously, but we are achieving it, and this year it will 
be positive. And finally, as far as unemployment is concerned, 
things look less dark, since in the first six months of 1993 
there were 200,000 more people unemployed, and in the second 
[half of 1993] -- it is still a huge number -- there were 
100,000 more, which is half as much, and this trend is being 
confirmed. 
  [Giesbert] Do you have the figures? 
  [Balladur] I have the figures that are to be issued today: 
In 
December, unemployment went up by 4,300 rather than the average 
of 30,000 which is what it was ten months ago. Of course, there 
is still a long way to go. [passage omitted] 
  I am not happy with the situation. I do not find it 
satisfactory either. This is why we decided yesterday to adopt 
a number of measures to enable us to go further. [passage 
omitted] 
  The French people are worried about the future -- and this 
is 
quite understandable. When there are more than three million 
unemployed in a country, there is almost one in every family or 
in a family they know well. So they are worried, and since they 
are worried they save a lot and do not consume enough. So our 
aim is to stimulate consumption, and that is why we adopted a 
number of measures, in particular connected with the motor 
industry and [words indistinct]. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Yesterday the government announced plans to pay 
car owners 5,000 francs to trade in their vehicles for new ones. 
You have thus given quite a helping hand to the motor industry 
which is in a very bad way. You said that things are getting 
better in some sectors, but they are not getting much better in 
the motor industry. 
  [Balladur] No, indeed. The motor industry's turnover fell 
greatly in 1993, and that is one of the reasons why the revival 
of consumption must happen through the motor industry, as it 
must happen through housing, too. [passage omitted] 
  The way I see things is that you have to encourage people to 
consume more. This can be done by reducing interest rates, by 
unfreezing workers' shares, by the measures we have taken over 
housing, by the ones we are taking today over the motor 
industry. In other words, nothing is ruled out of the area of 
our work and of our efforts. 
  [Giesbert] You announced a decrease of 0.75 points in the 
payment rates of building and loan savings plans, which is 
currently six percent. That is not going to make you very 
popular. 
  [Balladur] Excuse me, but this will reduce [the cost of] 
loans given to families when they want to buy their home. The 
two things are linked. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] There is a huge black spot: interest rates are 
much too high. Isn't this the explanation for our (?100) 
bankruptcies every day? 
  [Balladur] Not at all, not at all. The short term interest 
rates were 11 percent when we came to power ten months ago, and 
now they are less than seven percent. Long term interest rates 
were 7.5, and on the whole they are now 5.5. Our rates are at 
the same level as those of all the European countries, including 
Great Britain -- without devaluation! This is a false problem. 
The truth is that interest rates must go down further, but in a 
natural way, because if we want to reduce them artificially, we 
shall have a crisis at the end of which we will have to raise 
them. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Do you expect to reduce income tax on households 
next year? 
  [Balladur] We have already reduced it this year by 19 
billion 
[francs]. It will be reduced again next year. 
  [Giesbert] By how much? 
  [Balladur] I cannot tell you today, but by an amount that 
will not be far off the same. 
  [Giesbert] A little bit of politics: It is often said that 
you do not get on well with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. 
Originally you said he was the best person to head the RPR-UDF 
[Rally for the Republic-Union for French Democracy] list for the 
European elections. Today you don't really seem to want this. 
Why? 
  [Balladur] First, I get on well with all the ministers. I 
chose them, and if I chose them it was because I knew we could 
work well together. This applies to all of them, including the 
minister of foreign affairs, who is carrying out his job and his 
mission very well. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, Feb 1 (AFP) -- Recent data gathered by the 
INSEE Institute show "gradual improvement" in the French 
economy, Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery said on Tuesday [1 
February]. 
  He told correspondents that the reports by the National 
Statistics and Economic Studies Institute "confirm the 
government's scenario of a gradual improvement of economic 
activity in France. Hence it would be inappropriate to change 
course." 
  But he added that "There is still one worrisome point: the 
irregular trends in consumption." He said that household 
consumption of manufactured products would have been up in 
December, except that the problems of the auto sector pulled the 
increase down to zero. 
  "The rebound continued in January, and the partial 
indicators 
are rather promising," he said. 
  As to French unemployment, now at 12 percent and expected to 
rise further, the minister said that "The uptrend has not been 
halted, but things on the job front are gradually coming to look 
less dark." 
  Turning to interest rates, Alphandery said he would be 
"greatly surprised if we do not observe, in Europe and in 
France, a gradual return to the normal yield curve" (long-term 
rates higher than short-term rates). 
  As to possible recapitalization of major bank Credit 
Lyonnais, he said he was waiting for release of 1993 financial 
reports before making a decision.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 1 (AFP) -- An aide to presidential 
hopeful Jacques Chirac on Tuesday [1 February] strongly 
criticised an anti-unemployment package produced at the weekend 
by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur as insufficient. 
  Jean-Louis Debre, assistant secretary-general of the 
dominant 
right-wing party Rally for the Republic (RPR), brought the race 
for presidential elections in May 1995 into the open when he 
said of the package: "Good, but could do better." 
  Balladur is flying high in opinion polls as favourite of the 
French to succeed President Francois Mitterrand, well ahead of 
Chirac. Chirac is president of the RPR and Balladur a member of 
the same party. 
  In a statement to the daily LE MONDE Tuesday, Chirac ally 
Debre criticised the package for not exempting firms from social 
security charges so as to create jobs. "This does not correspond 
with the different policy we want as far as employment is 
concerned." 
  The cautious package, which was decided at a much-trumpeted 
government seminar on Sunday, was mainly aimed at the key motor 
and building industries. Car owners will be offered a 5,OOO 
franc (850 dollar) bonus if they exchange a 10-year-old vehicle 
for a new one. 
  An interest rate cut was announced on government-backed 
house-buying savings schemes in an attempt to encourage new 
property purchases by spending rather than saving. Limited 
measures for job creation were also announced. 
  The package earned faint praise from the other component in 
Balladur's governing coalition, the centre-right Union for 
French Democracy (UDF). Charles Millon, leader of the UDF's 
parliamentary group, said the package was "nice," but 
"short-term", and called on the government to "start basic 
essential reforms." 
  On the left, opposition Socialist Party leader Michel Rocard 
said the measures were "not up to the job." 
  France has an unemployment rate of 12 percent and rising, 
and 
about 3.3 million are out of work. The government is 
forecasting a 1.4 percent rise in gross domestic product in 1994.

<F P=106> ["E.P." report on interview with Alain Lamassoure, minister </F>
delegate for European Affairs ; place and date not given: 
"Lamassoure: `Irritating but Purely Technical'"] 
  [Text] "Those who believe that the delay in the 
implementation of the Schengen accord is due to bad will only 
have to go to Strasbourg to see how the system is working, or 
rather not working: Then they will notice themselves that the 
cause is a technical problem." Alain Lamassoure, minister 
delegate for European affairs, speaks clearly and firmly: It is 
"an irritating but purely technical problem. With regard to the 
Schengen accord, the hardest part is completed. We have 
surmounted 90 percent of the difficulties in the political, 
financial, and administrative areas. Three software programs are 
still causing problems, and we will do all we can to solve 
them." During the month of October, the minister continues, "we 
found out about these difficulties. Optimistic as we were, we 
thought that the problem could be solved within the three months 
preceding the 1 February implementation deadline." Whatever 
happens, Lamassoure emphasizes, "this 'sine die' delay in no 
case implies a delay forever." 
<H3>  Balladur, Chirac Presidential Candidacies Viewed 
[LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR 13-19 Jan, etc] </H3>
  [Editorial report] Writing in the 13-19 January Paris 
left-of-center weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, Alain Duhamel notes 
that it is presently "fashionable" to question the durability of 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's "ascendancy," as well as the 
influence he can exert on the political scene until the 
presidential elections. While Balladur's popularity has a solid 
foundation, it will naturally suffer some attrition but will not 
collapse, for it rests, above all, on a "judgment of the man, 
his style, and the political equilibrium he represents," Duhamel 
comments. Much depends on the general situation, he adds: Were 
the government to fail in its attempt to stabilize unemployment 
and improve economic growth, and if pessimism gained, leading to 
serious social conflict, Balladur's popularity would wane. On 
the other hand, if the prime minister succeeds in imposing a 
unified list of Rally for the Republic [RPR]-Union for French 
Democracy [UDF] candidates for the Euroelections and in keeping 
his ministers out of the competition, he will continue to embody 
the role of unifier of the parliamentary right, Duhamel 
continues. Much also depends on the evolution of his 
relationship with RPR leader Jacques Chirac. While the French 
are grateful to Balladur for ending the rivalry between Chirac 
and UDF leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the prime minister 
should carefully avoid a "fratricidal Balladur-Chirac duel." In 
Duhamel's estimation, this might not be easy, since all polls 
reveal the prime minister is the favorite for president. Indeed, 
Balladur would leave all his opponents--from the right or from 
the left--far behind in the first round and would win handily 
against any adversary in the second. While Balladur stated 
before becoming prime minister that the future head of 
government in a cohabitation period should never run for 
president, he could not have imagined the extent of his 
popularity at that time, Duhamel comments. Balladur would only 
enter the race if Chirac were in a difficult position, Duhamel 
contends; and there will certainly be only one RPR candidate, he 
affirms. The issue will probably be settled after the European 
Parliament elections: If the situation remains unchanged, the 
prime minister would be better placed than Chirac, and thus the 
"Balladur phenomenon" will surely upset the political scene. 
Under different, more difficult circumstances that would 
negatively affect the government, Chirac might recoup, at which 
time Balladur's "courteous authority" would only have been a 
transition between the legislative and the presidential 
timetables, Duhamel concludes. 
  By taking himself out of the race for the Euroelections on 
21 
January, Chirac "opened the hostilities" with Balladur, notes 
Gilles Bresson in the 24 January Paris daily LIBERATION. "The 
war is scheduled for June," Bresson continues, when an early RPR 
congress will proclaim its leader an official presidential 
candidate. Chirac's move stemmed partially from the opposition 
of some of his close aides--notably Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Alain Juppe--against his heading the Euroelection list of 
candidates. It is thus not surprising that Chirac's preferred 
candidate at this time is Juppe, for he has the advantage of 
upsetting Balladur who rejected a Euroelection candidacy for the 
members of his cabinet, Bresson contends. In addition, relations 
between Juppe and the prime minister "brutally" deteriorated 
during the GATT negotiations when Juppe demanded from an unhappy 
Balladur written directives to negotiate--an idea suggested by 
Chirac--and was offended because the prime minister 
congratulated Jacques Delors and Leon Brittan but neglected him. 
Finally, Bresson notes, Balladur did not appreciate the fact 
that Juppe affirmed to the press his attachment to a Chirac 
presidential candidacy. 
  The 5 January Paris satirical weekly LE CANARD ENCHAINE 
notes 
UDF-inspired rumors claiming that the presidential election 
might be held earlier than scheduled. Besides Giscard's 
"enthusiastic" participation in this "campaign," the newspaper 
cites Minister of Defense Francois Leotard as openly expressing 
his belief that "Mitterrand will not end his term" and that 
"Balladur knows it and is preparing himself." The paper further 
quotes Leotard as saying that "this is precisely why I made my 
position in his favor so clear. Not only did the prime minister 
not reprimand me, but, on the contrary, he was very happy." LE 
CANARD also quotes Minister of Overseas Territories Dominique 
Perben as stating to the press that "Chirac is caught up in an 
implacable mechanism. He will be unable to run for president. It 
is Balladur who will." The paper comments that since Perben, a 
former deputy secretary general of the RPR, owes his political 
career to the RPR leader: "the Chirac boat must indeed be 
sinking: run for your life!"

<F P=106> [Jacques Amalric editorial from the "Ideas and Reactions" </F>
column: "Bosnia: the Unjust War"] 
  [Excerpts] Like Warren Christopher, his secretary of 
state, President Clinton has not been moved by the arguments 
used by Francois Mitterrand, Edouard Balladur, and Alain Juppe 
to ensure that the United States is involved, at least 
diplomatically, in the Bosnian crisis. You just have to reread 
his State of the Union message to realize this: The White House 
chief spoke for 55 minutes but he only devoted eight minutes to 
external questions, and only a few seconds to the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  This refusal to intervene diplomatically should receive 
spectacular confirmation in the next few days when the U.S. 
Administration publishes new presidential directives relating to 
the participation of U.S. troops in UN operations. These 
directives will, in fact, have the effect of making it virtually 
impossible for there to be any U.S. involvement in a UN 
intervention aimed at restoring rather than maintaining peace 
(which is the case in Bosnia) [passage omitted] 
  This is a far cry from Bill Clinton's election promise to 
place a military rapid deployment force at the United Nations' 
disposal. This is the exact opposite. The new presidential 
directive will in fact simply be a list of pretexts for refusing 
any participation in UN operations deemed not in keeping with 
American national interest. In the opposite case, as formerly in 
the Gulf War, it can be expected that the initiative for the 
operation will not be taken by the United Nations but by 
Washington, with the United Nations then only serving as a 
screen. 
  The announcement of this new policy will be welcomed by 
American public opinion and by Congress: The pictures of GI 
bodies being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu are still 
present in everybody's memory and highlight this illusion of a 
war without innocent victims, in which only the "bad guys" die, 
which ensured the media success of the confrontation with Saddam 
Husayn. But how can anybody forget that George Bush had 
launched his country into the Somali operation largely to make 
his voters forget the terrible pictures coming out of the former 
Yugoslavia? Why should Bill Clinton be spared a dilemma which 
is as old as America? Although the the rejection of old 
European wrongdoings, which founded the creation of the United 
States, carries within it a large dose of isolationism, the 
puritanism and messianism which go with it carry within them the 
seed of interventionism. 
  The U.S. President has so far managed to reconcile the two 
tendencies: Officially, at least, it is by moralism and a sense 
of justice that he justifies his refusal to get his hands dirty 
in Bosnia and give his backing in principle to a plan to 
partition this former Yugoslav Republic. The victims, he says 
referring to the Muslims, have the right to defend themselves. 
The conflict in Bosnia, he also hints, does not threaten any 
American interest. In so doing, he is gambling on a 
continuation of the war, from which justice would emerge. 
Unfortunately, there is a strong chance that he will lose his 
bet: Of course, the outcome of the fighting is at present 
favorable to the Muslims. But major victories will inevitably 
provoke a Serbian counteroffensive, which is already being 
planned, and the official entry of the Croatian Army into 
Bosnia. The 12,000 Blue Helmets deployed in Bosnia will merely 
prevent the war going round in circles, and their withdrawal 
will be inevitable. The internationalization of the conflict 
will then be even closer because it will become infinitely more 
difficult to curb Slav and Muslim solidarities: Russia is much 
more active in its diplomatic defense of the Serbian positions, 
whereas China will place an increasingly high price on its right 
of veto within the Security Council, and many Muslim countries 
will consider the support (not only moral, according to some 
Western intelligence services) given by the Americans to the 
Bosnian Muslims as the go-ahead for increased intervention.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Republicans Appear Headed For a </F>
Split"] 
  [Text] Rome, 31 Jan (ANSA) -- Italy's small Republican 
Party [PRI] appeared headed for a split Monday [31 January] 
after party secretary Giorgio La Malfa failed to reach an 
understanding with the Democratic Alliance, to which many 
Republicans belong, for a common progressive front in view of 
the upcoming elections. 
  During a meeting of the party's national council yesterday, 
La Malfa called on the party to steer the moderate path, by 
joining Mario Segni's Pact for Italy, and said that it could 
only take into consideration an alliance with the Democratic 
Alliance if it dropped from its forces the orthodox Communist 
Renaissance [Renewal] and Network [Rete] of Palermo Mayor 
Leoluca Orlando. A resolution outlining his position, however, 
was passed by a margin of only 6 votes, 65 to 59. 
  Speaking to the press after his meeting here today with 
Democratic Alliance, a meeting he described last night as a 
"last ditch" effort to steer them away from the far Left, La 
Malfa said his conditions had not been accepted. At this point, 
he added, Republicans who feel they must stay with the 
progressive alliance were free to do so, but if they joined its 
election slate then they would not longer be considered party 
members. 
  Earlier in the day, La Malfa had argued how the decision 
adopted at yesterday's national council was binding for all 
Republicans. He added how he knew the decision would have been 
a difficult one and that it risked causing deep divisions. 
  In related developments, Valero Zanone, on behalf of the 
Liberal Democratic Union, welcomed the move by La Malfa's 
Republicans and the Socialists of Giuliano Amato to join the 
Pact for Italy. "Around the Pact proposed by Segni" he said, 
"there can finally be achieved the goal of these past months to 
unite Catholics and the lay parties based on common liberal 
democratic principals. The Pact is the only initiative which 
has taken shape as an alternative to the unified Left without 
striking compromises with the right of [League Secretary] Bossi, 
[National Alliance leader] Fini and their like". 
  La Malfa said that the "parting of the ways" had been "very 
friendly" and expressed doubt that prominent members of his 
party would leave to form part of a progressive line-up in which 
the presence of Communist Renaissance [Renewal] was 
"contradictory" and liable to "favour the victory of moderate 
forces". 
  A leading Republican member of Democratic Alliance, Giorgio 
Bogi, told reporters that he would continue working in the 
centre-left group despite the threat of expulsion, which is "a 
matter for party organs and not the secretary to decide." 
  Giuseppe Ayala, a former anti-Mafia judge who was close to 
the Republican party before joining Democratic Alliance, said 
the threat did not concern him since he had never taken out 
Republican party membership. "I continue to believe in 
Democratic Alliance, and I am sorry the entirety of the 
Republican Party is not with us," he said. 
  Ferdinando Adornato, one of the founders of Democratic 
Alliance, issued a brief statement saying that "we started off a 
project for overcoming the old logic of political affiliation; 
it is inevitable that certain members of the old nomenklatura 
are resisting this project." 
  La Malfa -- who, like former Liberal and Socialist chiefs, 
has admitted accepting illegal electoral funding from the 
Ferruzzi group in 1992 -- confirmed to journalists that he will 
not be standing in the coming elections.

place and date not given: "Orlando: It Is All the PDS' Fault";

  [Excerpts] Rome -- Leoluca Orlando took a mouthful, then 
said: "Now that we have won on all fronts...." Another mouthful: 
"...We must be careful over the issue of candidates...." A 
third mouthful: "...because we must offer the voters a credible 
progressive alignment." [passage omitted] 
  [CORRIERE] Why do you say that you have won on all fronts? 
  [Orlando] Because we have secured acceptance at the 
negotiations among the progressive forces of the idea that the 
socialist stance is not represented exclusively by [Italian 
Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Del Turco. Because Craxi, De 
Michelis, and Di Donato are no longer present in the new PSI. 
Because the impossibility of standing for reelection has caused 
La Malfa to veer off toward the Christian Democrats, thus 
fragmenting the PRI [Italian Republican Party]. Because my 
doubts about [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, who is with the DC 
[Christian Democratic Party] and not with us, are now gaining 
substance. Are these enough successes? [passage omitted] 
  [CORRIERE] Let us return to what is happening in Rome. Let 
us talk about the progressive forces' candidates in the coming 
general election. 
  [Orlando] I say we must beware of quick-change acts at the 
local level. We will pay close attention to ensure that this 
danger does not materialize. We will also implement the 
following principle rigorously -- each candidate's establishment 
at the local level. 
  [CORRIERE] Do you mean that you will field all the 
candidates 
in Sicily? 
  [Orlando] Why not? Will the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left] not do the same in Emilia? It is a democratic practice.... 
  [CORRIERE] But your allies would not like the idea of a Rete 
candidate standing in all Sicily's constituencies. 
  [Orlando] No, not in every constituency, but in almost all. 
In any case, our strength is very well established in Sicily. 
We could even compete on our own, but we are not doing so. We 
decided to align with other forces: This is the meaning of the 
alliance. 
  [CORRIERE] Is it a government alliance or merely an election 
cartel? 
  [Orlando] It is an alliance that for the present is aiming 
at 
victory. 
  [CORRIERE] Yes, but then what? [PDS Deputy Secretary] 
D'Alema is talking in terms of a government with [Italian 
Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli.... 
  [Orlando] I disagree with approaches to the man who is now 
again putting forward the 1960's model of the DC's position as 
linchpin. Moreover, there must be rather more respect for the 
voters; they must be offered an option characterized by a clear 
break. 
  [CORRIERE] Is it true that Rete has offered to field Naples 
District Attorney Agostino Cordova as a candidate? 
  [Orlando] I spoke with Mr. Cordova over the telephone 10 
days 
ago, and I certainly could not discuss such matters. We have 
not met or spoken since then. 
  [CORRIERE] Are you also obsessed with fielding magistrates 
as 
candidates? 
  [Orlando] Actually, I am opposed to magistrates' standing as 
candidates if they are conducting criminal investigations. Or, 
rather, I believe that if a judge wants to engage in active 
politics, he must first resign. It would be a sign of the 
judiciary's independence, and I will be proposing this in the 
progressive forces' negotiations.

<F P=106> [Stefano Folli report: "All Polls Show Italy Split Three </F>
Ways and a Country Yet To Come to Terms With Bipolarism"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The preelectoral picture of Italy is 
starting to come into focus thanks to the opinion polls. It is 
a picture that shows clearly the cloudy state of uncertainty 
into which the country has fallen. If anyone wants to 
understand why it is so difficult for agreements to be struck 
between [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni and [League 
Secretary] Umberto Bossi, between [Italian Popular Party (PPI) 
Secretary] Martinazzoli and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, 
between [Italian Republican Party (PRI) Secretary] La Malfa and 
[Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Achille Occhetto, 
between [Italian Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Del Turco and 
[PSI deputy] Intini, and between [Communist Renewal leader] 
Cossutta and [Democratic Allaince leader] Adornato, they should 
simply take a look at the figures published by Directa, CIRM, or 
Diakron -- to name but a few of the polling institutions that 
are exhibiting their wares in the newspapers these days. 
  What emerges is the image of an Italy that is split into 
three, more or less equal-sized slices. There are differences 
between individual polls, but in general the three Italies are a 
reality, if only a virtual one. For example, the triple poll 
taken by CIRM in January provides a rather interesting batch of 
new information. The progressive alliance stands at around 36 
percent. Within the alliance, the PDS is the hegemonic force 
with 20 percent: At the beginning of the month, Occhetto's 
party was given 23 percent, in the second poll it stood at 22 
percent, and today it has probably lost another two points. The 
Communist Renewal should have 6 percent, remaining more or less 
stable since early January. The Rete and the Greens, taken 
together, were on 5 percent after having reached 6 percent in 
the first poll. The nondenominationalist group of the 
Democratic Alliance remained steady on 5 percent. The 
progressive front as a whole now appears to have four points 
less than the 40 percent achieved in the first days of January. 
  The right, on the other hand, would appear to be on the way 
up. The first poll gave it 34 percent, but in the second it had 
38 percent. In the most recent poll, published a few days ago, 
the right had 40 percent. If we look inside the coalition 
(which, moreover, is not yet an official one) we can see that 
the main group at the moment appears to be Silvio Berlusconi's 
Forza Italia, which has shot up from 6 percent to 13 percent in 
less than a month. The Northern League, on the other hand, has 
taken the opposite trend: Leading the way with 16 percent at 
the start of the month, it then dropped to 13 percent before 
further shrinking back to 12 percent. Gianfranco Fini's 
National Alliance remains completely stable on 10 percent (note 
that this figure, taken at the national level, would give the 
Alliance a considerable success concentrated in the south). 
Lastly, the CIRM poll recorded an increase for the former 
Christian Democratic [DC] and nondenominationalist centrists, up 
from 2 to 5 percent. The split in the DC has clearly given a 
slight boost to the Casini-D'Onofrio-Mastella group chasing the 
moderate voters. 
  The third Italy that we should keep an eye on is that of 
[Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli and 
Mario Segni. The agreement concluded between the Popular Party 
and the Pact for Italy remains stable in the polls at 23 
percent. From a political point of view, this would prove 
Martinazzoli right in choosing to defend stubbornly his party's 
identity as the center-left heir to the DC. As [Senate Speaker] 
Spadolini said in an interview with LA STAMPA, "the alliance of 
the left as it stands is best confronted from the center. 
Martinazzoli and Segni have understood this. A new type of 
dialogue is being imposed between nondenominationalists and 
Catholics." 
  However, this 23 percent does not guarantee either 
Martinazzoli or Segni sufficient representation in a future 
parliament: The rules of the majority system are strict, and 
those finishing third can get little or nothing. Augusta 
Barbera explained this well in an interview with CORRIERE DELLA 
SERA, even if we should add that the Italian-style majority 
system does award a considerable consolation prize with a 25 
percent proportional drawback. 
  In any case, the map of the three Italies must not be seen 
just from an electoral point of view. The political message it 
gives is that the country has not come to terms with bipolarism 
and that public opinion, for the moment, prefers a three-legged 
system. This is a sign that the clear-cut alternative between 
left and right does not appear convincing yet and that people 
want to let at least a third runner into the race. After 27 
March this could also lead to that "great coalition" alluded to 
by the speaker of the Senate. The other clear message is that 
the left has not yet won, and thus its forces do not appear to 
be superior to those of the right. Occhetto's advantage is that 
the progressive coalition is already a reality, despite 
contradictions and a paradoxical situation. On the other hand, 
the right will continue to be the side of Agramante, as 
described by [former IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli. The new 
factor in the equation, however, is that Bossi has asked 
Berlusconi to act as a "mediator" between north and south -- in 
effect to act as the cement for an agreement that does not yet 
exist and which should bind together the League, Forza Italia, 
and the MSI-National Alliance. Bossi's initiative, however, is 
also the sign of Berlusconi's growing sway among the moderates. 
  It simply remains to be said that things are not settled 
either in the Martinazzoli-Segni group with regard to possible 
preelection alliances. While the Popular Party members of the 
left are in favor of going it alone, many in the Pact think 
otherwise. There is a border area between the two, consisting 
mostly of nondenominationalists, that still believe in the idea 
of a technical agreement with the ranks of the right to save the 
majority constituencies. Mario Segni, after having decided to 
back the agreement with Martinazzoli, now has every reason to 
hold on to a degree of autonomy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi on Interest Rates, Austerity </F>
Measures"] 
  [Text] Rome, 31 Jan (ANSA) -- Interest rates will continue 
to fall in 1994, according to Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi, who on Monday [31 January] said the government does not 
have enough information at this time to evaluate the need for 
further austerity measures. 
  Speaking to reporters on his flight back to Rome from 
Vienna, 
Ciampi said that it was "very easy to predict" that interest 
rates will continue to fall this year, although not as much as 
they did in the last three quarters of 1993. 
  "Between April and December of 1993," Ciampi said, "interest 
rates fell between four and five points. Today they are at 7 to 
7.5 percent. At this rate, they should drop to below 3 percent 
this year but I fear that will be difficult." 
  How interest rates go will depend on what happens in Italy 
and abroad, he added. "I think that none of us in April thought 
it would have been possible to cut interest rates in just eight 
months to today's levels." 
  Asked whether his government planned additional austerity 
measures to reduce the deficit in the near future, Ciampi 
replied that the first public finance report will be available 
in March. "At that time we will see what changes need to be 
made.... At this time I have no indications because it is not 
easy to have any after the first month of the year." 
  Continuing recession in Europe however will certainly have 
negative effects on Italy's primary surplus, Ciampi said. Lower 
interest rates can reduce the burden of debt servicing but in 
March, "and only in March," Ciampi stressed, will it be possible 
to compare forecasts to reality.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "65 Percent of Spanish People Believe </F>
That 27 January Damaged Gonzalez"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The trade unions won the support of less 
than half the workers in the general strike. Some 47 percent of 
employed Spaniards over the age of 15 supported the strike 
called by the Workers Commissions and the General Workers Union. 
The population are divided in assessing whether the strike did 
or did not represent a success for the trade unions, but in any 
event they believe it is the government which was damaged most: 
65 percent of the public believe the strike has damaged the 
image of Felipe Gonzalez' government. This is the overall 
conclusion of a snap opinion poll conducted by Demoscopia for EL 
PAIS on Thursday [27 January]. 
  The percentage of interviewees who believe that the protest 
was beneficial for the trade unions' image is twice that of 
those who believe it has harmed them -- 45 percent, as against 
22 percent. On the other hand, those who believe that the 
strike has damaged the government's image total 65 percent. 
Only 2 percent of those polled believe the government's image 
has benefited, while 17 percent believe it has not been 
affected. The government is thus perceived by the Spanish 
people as the main loser in a strike which was not observed by 
an absolute majority of the working population. 
  With respect to the observance of the protest, 47 percent of 
Spanish workers over the age of 15 went on strike, as against 50 
percent who did not do so. The remaining 3 percent did not 
answer the question. These figures represent a sharp contrast 
with those for the 14 December 1988 general strike. 
  At that time, according to the Demoscopia poll figures, the 
percentage of the working population who supported the strike 
was put at 75 percent; thus the participation on this occasion 
was almost 30 percent lower than at that time. In the current 
poll, the estimate of the level of observance of the strike was 
made, on the one hand, by asking the interviewees who said that 
they were working (and who represent 40 percent of the sample) 
whether or not they went on strike, and, on the other, asking 
all the interviewees whether those over the age of 15 and in 
employment living in their homes observed the strike. 
  Thus, on the basis of the 800 interviews conducted (40 
percent with people working, 11 percent with people unemployed 
or seeking their first job, and 49 percent with nonworking 
people), it was possible to gather information on the employment 
status and the attitudes toward the strike of a total of 919 
people, which represents a sound basis for estimating the true 
extent of the strike. 
<H5>  Success or Failure </H5>
  Some 76 percent of the workers voting for United Left 
supported the strike, as against 58 percent of the workers 
voting for the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party], and 24 
percent of those voting for the People's Party. 
  Although a majority (specifically, 45 percent of those 
polled) believe the strike will serve no purpose, the majority 
reaction now, as happened after 14 December [1988], is that the 
government should negotiate new labor market reform with the 
trade unions. Such is the opinion of 58 percent of the Spanish 
people, a percentage which rises to 66 percent among United Left 
voters and 65 percent among PSOE voters. 
  Public opinion is divided over the trade unions' success 
with 
their protest: 37 percent of those interviewed believe that 
they had "a great deal" or "a fair amount," as against 34 
percent, who believe "little" or "none." Only among workers who 
voted for United Left are those who believe in the trade unions' 
success an absolute majority (68 percent). 
  The main reasons why the interviewees believe citizens went 
on strike are, in the first place, in order to protest against 
the way in which government is being conducted (44 percent say 
so), and, next, fear of the pickets and public disorder 
(mentioned by 35 percent). Only 27 percent believe that those 
who did not go to work Thursday did so because they agree with 
what the trade unions say. The dominant perception in society 
thus seems to be that this was more a strike against the 
government than in support of the main trade unions. 
  Even among those who supported the strike, the reason cited 
most often to explain their stance is opposition to the way in 
which government is being conducted. This confirms the 
predominantly antigovernment protest character which this strike 
seems to have had for everybody.

President. The Talks Related Primarily to Economic Questions"; 
as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 27 Jan (ATSA) -- Uzbek President Islam Karimov 
had a 45-minute meeting on Thursday evening [27 January] in Bern 
with Confederation President Otto Stich. The two presidents 
essentially discussed economic problems, according to Mario 
Carrera, spokesman for the Federal Department of Finance (DFF). 
  Bern and Tashkent said they wanted to strengthen their 
relations, the DFF spokesman added. Switzerland and Uzbekistan 
signed two agreements last year, one relating to economic 
cooperation and the other to investment protection. The Uzbek 
president expressed the wish that cooperation between the two 
countries should not stop there. 
  Mr. Karimov, who reminded Mr. Stich of his country's major 
economic potential, stressed the positive role played by the big 
Swiss banks in Uzbekistan, Mr. Carrera added. The two 
presidents deemed it necessary to continue the economic reforms 
in the framework set out by the IMF. Uzbekistan is a member of 
the voting group headed by Switzerland within the Bretton Woods 
institutions. 
  Mr. Stich and Mr. Karimov also discussed the general 
political situation in Central Asia, particularly the case of 
Tajikistan. Following this short meeting with the president of 
the Confederation, the Uzbek president is due to go to Davos to 
participate in the economic forum.

<F P=106> [Article signed NI; JR: "Yasir 'Arafat Visits Switzerland; </F>
First Official Meeting With Federal Council Members"; as 
released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 27 Jan (ATSA) -- Yasir 'Arafat will meet with 
Federal Council members Otto Stich and Flavio Cotti in Bern on 
Monday [31 January]. In the view of the Federal Department of 
Foreign Affairs [DFAE], this event culminates a 20-year discreet 
but sustained dialogue with the PLO. It also demonstrates 
Switzerland's desire to continue its contribution, "which is 
real," to a peace process described in Bern as "irreversible." 
  Support for the Middle East peace process is one of 
Switzerland's main foreign policy priorities, Ambassador 
Heinrich Reimann, head of the DFAE Political Section II 
(responsible mainly for the Middle East issue) explained on 
Thursday. He said: "What is happening in that region also has 
an effect on our country." In addition to Mr. 'Arafat, Flavio 
Cotti will meet with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa in Bern 
on Friday, and with Shim'on Peres, his Israeli counterpart, at 
the Davos Forum. Mr. Peres and Mr. 'Arafat will hold talks in 
Davos. 
<H5>  PLO Office in Bern </H5>
  Since Israel and the PLO signed the agreement on autonomy in 
the occupied territories last September, Switzerland has tried 
to step up its dialogue with the Palestinian representatives. 
Two days after the signing of the PLO-Israel agreement, the 
Federal Council accepted the principle of opening a PLO office 
in Bern. This office, however, cannot represent the "Palestinian 
state" proclaimed in 1988. 
  In accordance with international law, Bern only recognizes 
states defined by the three criteria of international law. 
These criteria, which must be recognized by the international 
community, cover the notions of people, territory, and 
government. "We have not reached that point," Ambassador 
Reimann noted on Thursday. 
<H5>  A 20-Year Dialogue </H5>
  Switzerland has long recognized the PLO as an essential 
political force within the peace process framework. He stressed 
that a sustained dialogue has existed since the seventies, when 
the PLO opened its mission at the United Nations in Geneva. It 
was not until December 1992, however, that the DFAE named Nabil 
Ramlawi, PLO UN representative, as its official interlocutor. In 
1981, Federal Council member Pierre Aubert even had a meeting in 
Bern with Faruq Qaddumi, PLO foreign affairs "minister." A 
second meeting was held in Tunis in 1985. 
  Repeated contacts were also held during international 
conferences. The PLO was not the only beneficiary: Meetings 
also took place in the occupied territories with Palestinian 
representatives who reject the peace process. This policy of 
dialogue has often offended Israel in recent years. According to 
Ambassador Reimann, however, it reflects a conviction held by 
the Federal Council: Israel's right to existence within secure 
borders is inseparable from the Palestinian people's right to 
self-determination. 
  Switzerland, which has been more discreet than Norway, for 
example, nonetheless has its "creative contribution to make," 
Mr. Reimann said. In particular, to enable the peace process to 
be balanced, Switzerland believes it necessary to "support the 
weakest partner." The 60 million francs Bern released between 
1994 and 1998 to help the Palestinians illustrate this concern.

<F P=106> [Article signed ni: "Yasir 'Arafat: First Time in Bern -- </F>
PLO Leader Counting on Swiss Aid"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA 
database] 
  [Text] Bern, 31 January (ATS) -- Yasir 'Arafat is counting 
on Switzerland to help rebuild infrastructures in the occupied 
territories "destroyed by the occupation." In Bern on Monday 
[31 January], the PLO leader thanked Confederation President 
Otto Stich and Federal Council Member Flavio Cotti for their 
hospitality and for the support Switzerland has already given in 
the peace process. He said during a news conference that a 
lasting peace in the Near East was a necessity "for all." 
  This was the Palestinian leader's first official meeting 
with 
members of the Swiss Government. Yasir 'Arafat arrived in Bern 
by helicopter from Davos around 1230 on Monday. The PLO leader 
had just ended a series of meetings with Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres on the sidelines of the Davos Forum. 
Despite a final meeting at night, the two men did not reach 
agreement on the implementation of Palestinian autonomy, for 
which the PLO-Israeli agreement signed in Washington last 
September makes provision. 
<H5>  "Very Close" to an Agreement </H5>
  At the end of his talks with Mr. Stich and Mr. Cotti, a 
smiling Palestinian leader appeared before the press at the 
Bellevue Hotel, dressed in his khaki uniform and wearing his 
usual keffiyah. Speaking in halting English, Yasir 'Arafat said 
he had come "very close" to an agreement with Shim'on Peres in 
Davos. According to him, the Palestinian side was ready, but 
the Israelis asked for a few more days to consider it. "And, it 
takes two to tango." 
  "I am a pragmatist, but I have strong hopes that this 
agreement will be signed in Cairo in a few days. If that is the 
case, it will still be called the `Davos agreement.'" Yasir 
'Arafat and Shim'on Peres will meet again in Cairo on Sunday to 
try to finalize this agreement, which is encountering problems 
on three main points: the area of Jericho, the control of border 
crossing points, and the security of Israeli settlers. Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is rather optimistic, said on 
Monday that the draft agreement drawn up in Davos was 
"positive." When signed, it would make possible the gradual 
withdrawal of the Israeli army from those areas. 
<H5>  PLO Office in Bern: Status Not Clear </H5>
  Yasir 'Arafat also asked Switzerland to play an active part 
in the rebuilding of the infrastructure "destroyed by the 
occupation" in the territories. "We need your support and your 
experts," he said. According to Mr. Stich, in addition to the 
financial aid (60 million francs) planned by Switzerland, 
discussions related in particular to technological cooperation 
and cooperation in the field of tourism. 
  Referring to the forthcoming opening of a PLO office in 
Bern, 
Yasir 'Arafat explained in French that it would be the "General 
Delegation of Palestine." This title seems to contradict the 
status Bern intends to give that office, which, in its view, 
cannot represent the "Palestinian state" self-proclaimed in 
1988. In accordance with international law, Bern only 
recognizes states defined by the three criteria of international 
law. These criteria, which must be recognized by the 
international community, include the notions of people, 
territory, and government. 
<H5>  "An Open Man" </H5>
  "I have had a meeting with an open man, and it was a warm 
encounter," Otto Stich said in an initial news conference with 
Flavio Cotti. According to him, Mr. 'Arafat thanked Switzerland 
for having recognized "very early" that Israel's right to 
existence and to security within internationally recognized 
borders was inseparable from the Palestinian people's right to 
self-determination. 
  Mr. Stich congratulated the Palestinian leader for his 
"courage" in daring to take a step toward peace and for sitting 
down at the same table as his former enemies. According to 
Flavio Cotti, talks with Yasir 'Arafat have made it possible to 
verify that preliminary bilateral talks (Israel-PLO, 
Israel-Jordan, Israel-Syria, and so forth) were a "more 
realistic" approach than multilateral negotiations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Slight Increase in Armament Exports </F>
from Switzerland--Malaysia Was the Biggest Customer in 1993"; as 
released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 31 Jan (ATS) -- In 1993, arms exports 
increased by 0.5 percent in comparison with the year before, 
from 258.8 million [Swiss] francs (Sf) to Sf260.2 million. 
However, taking inflation into account, the figure represents a 
decrease in real terms, Francois Godet, deputy secretary general 
of the Federal Military Department (DMF), told ATS. 
  Since 1987's record figure (Sf578.3 million), the amount of 
arms exports has dropped each year. Mr. Godet says this 
downward trend can be explained by increased arms sales by 
"threshold countries," such as the former Communist countries in 
East Europe. 
<H5>  European Union as the Main Customer </H5>
  In 1993, Switzerland's biggest individual customer was 
Malaysia, with sales amounting to Sf50.7 million. Germany 
ranked second (Sf41.5 million), followed by Saudi Arabia (Sf36.9 
million). From a geographical point of view, the European Union 
is the main purchaser of Swiss arms at Sf79.1 million, followed 
by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, both totaling Sf45 
million. 
  Other major customers include Sweden and Singapore (Sf16 
million each), Canada (11.9 million), the United States (Sf8.6 
million), Austria (Sf7.6 million), the Philippines (Sf4.1 
million), the Netherlands (Sf3.8 million), and Brazil (Sf1.4 
million). The smallest customer was Estonia, which spent Sf21 
[as received] for explosives and chemicals for civil use.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 2 (AFP) -- The French Foreign Ministry 
insisted Wednesday [2 February] that the airport in the northern 
Bosnian town of Tuzla be reopened immediately to relief flights 
and condemned the shelling of the airport by Serb troops. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque warned that 
Tuesday's shelling of the airport was a direct affront to the 
international community and recalled the recent decision by the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to consider air 
strikes to ensure the reopening of the airport. 
  The airport has been shut down since May 1992. 
  Meanwhile, Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana stopped 
briefly in Split Wednesday on his way to the southern Bosnian 
town of Medjugorje where he is to meet with the Spanish UN 
battalion based there. 
  Solana said prior to his departure from Madrid that the 
Spanish troops would have to be redeployed to new positions in 
case of NATO air strikes. 
  He added that although the Spanish troops would remain in 
the 
former Yugoslavia throughout the winter months, the Spanish 
Government may reconsider the situation if a peaceful solution 
to the conflict appears unlikely. 
  "Perhaps after winter we should make an in-depth analysis of 
the situation with other countries involved and make a decision 
if a peaceful solution to the conflict has not been reached by 
then," he said. 
  On Tuesday, the commander of Spanish troops in Bosnia, 
Colonel Luis Carvajal, said UN peacekeepers would be in danger 
in case of NATO air strikes as they are ill prepared to respond 
to any retaliatory attacks and Serb reaction to the strikes 
would be "unpredictable." 
  Earlier this month, the opposition Popular Party in Spain 
also demanded the withdrawal of the Spanish troops from Bosnia 
since it said the situation on the ground there was becoming 
increasingly dangerous. 
  Spain has 1,180 UN peacekeeping troops deployed in the 
former 
Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F>
Gyoergy Foris in Brussels; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Foris] Mr. Secretary General, I would like to 
ask you about the Partnership for Peace program. What does it 
specifically offer, and why does it not offer security 
guarantees? 
  [Woerner in English with superimposed Hungarian translation] 
First and foremost it provides a whole range of new 
opportunities for military and political cooperation under a 
bilateral agreement, including the possibility for the country 
in question's defense system to approach NATO standards. The 
latter is one of the most important tasks in the course of 
preparation of membership. 
  However, we cannot offer security guarantees with 
Partnership 
for Peace, since these are linked to member status. But it 
would be a mistake to think that without formal guarantees you 
are left alone. By cooperating more and more closely with NATO, 
your security is increasing. Should there be any threat against 
you, everybody should take into consideration our alliance's 
probable reaction. Because probably we would not just idly bide 
our time. 
  [Foris] Indeed, the document mentions the fact that 
Partnership for Peace also means a kind of new security 
relation. What does it mean in specific terms? 
  [Woerner] As a part of Partnership for Peace, we offer an 
opportunity for consultations. In the event there is a threat 
against your territorial integrity, it enables you to ask 
immediately for consultations with NATO. In reality, it does 
not only mean that you will simply be listened to, but together 
with this we will find ways of eliminating the danger. 
  [Foris] [passage omitted] In my view the UN's mandate [to 
NATO] is a trap -- since without this, NATO is doomed to 
idleness, even if it wants to take steps. 
  [Woerner] I am convinced that we would be able to act, but 
only under certain circumstances. But you are right, we have 
some member states which are insisting on the UN mandate, just 
like everybody is insisting on the UN. 
  [Foris] Can you see a way out of this trap? 
  [Woerner] I would not call it a trap. But as far as a way 
out is concerned, I would encourage the UN to act more 
resolutely. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 2 (AFP) -- Private sector steelmakers 
in the European Community could be left alone to face an 
over-production crisis unless they quickly accept a plan to 
restructure the industry, EC officials warned here Wednesday [2 
February]. 
  They said the EC's Executive European Commission might drop 
its plans to help finance production cuts, or to re-negotiate 
quotas on cheap steel imports from East Europe, unless the 
steelmakers agree on voluntary production cuts. 
  The warning came after EC Competitions Commissioner Karel 
Van 
Miert acknowledged on Tuesday that the Commission's rescue plan 
was in trouble because private steelmakers had not volunteered 
any offers to reduce output. 
  "We could not get the necessary cooperation from governments 
and from the steel sector itself. Unfortunately, in spite of 
the well-developed policies we have developed, we cannot deliver 
the goods," he said. 
  Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann subsequently set a 
deadline of March 31 for the private steelmakers to make firm 
reduction commitments. 
  If the deadline were missed, he said, the Commission might 
abandon its plan to spend several hundred million dollars 
helping dismissed steelworkers, and to lend one billion dollars 
towards the costs of restructuring the industry. 
  Bangemann added that import quotas on cheap East European 
steel imposed last year, aimed particularly at Czech steel, 
might also be abandoned if the private sector did not cooperate. 
  The Commission wants the EC steel industry to cut production 
capacity by more than 20 percent -- by 30 million tonnes of raw 
steel and 20 million tonnes of hot-rolled steel a year. 
  This would mean scrapping at least 60,000 jobs -- a 
sacrifice 
which the Commission deems essential medicine for an industry 
buffetted by over-production, falling demand, plummetting prices 
and economic recession. 
  Last December, EC governments agreed that the public sector 
would cut production by 5.5 million tonnes of hot-rolled steel a 
year, on condition that they would get last-time subsidies 
totalling about 7.5 billion dollars. 
  The private steelmakers are supposed to provide the rest of 
the production cuts. So far, they have committed themselves to 
cuts of no more than five million tonnes. 
  Now the Commission wants them to agree among themselves how 
to share out the production cuts, with the healthiest among them 
helping to finance the close-down costs of the least efficient 
backed by EC aid. 
  But the private steelmakers are upset about the subsidies 
authorised for their public sector competition in Spain, 
Germany, Italy and Portugal last December. 
  They have expressed doubts about the promised production 
cutbacks at these plants, and maintain that the state-owned 
steel works should in any case be made to bear a larger share of 
the cutbacks. 
  Bangemann and Van Miert are scheduled to meet European steel 
executives grouped in the European federation Eurofer on 
February 15.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Feb 2 (AFP) -- The European Community 
is still trying to keep alive its proposals for an energy tax, 
even if this means granting exemptions to the countries most 
opposed to the measure, an EC official said here Wednesday [2 
February]. 
  He was speaking after Jacques Delors, president of the EC's 
executive European Commission, told environmentalists earlier 
this week that he would continue fighting for the tax to the end 
of his presidency on December 31. [passage omitted] 
  But the EC official said Delors was prepared to concede 
exemptions "to one or two countries" if necessary to push the 
proposal through. 
  The energy tax aims primarily at reducing vehicle emissions 
of carbon dioxide. It was originally supposed to start at the 
equivalent of three dollars a barrel of oil and rise to $10 by 
the turn of the century. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Government Action in United States"] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Temelin nuclear power plant near the 
Austrian border was the topic of a question hour in the 
Nationalrat on Wednesday [2 February]. All parliamentary groups 
called for preventing, if possible, the completion of the Czech 
nuclear power plant in Temelin; the Greens called for more 
activities by Austria. Chancellor Vranitzky stressed that 
government members will present the Austrian position in the 
United States. 
  Deputy Anschober of the Greens accused the government of 
acting against Temelin only half-heartedly. He described the 
special threat to Austria's security by the Temelin nuclear 
power plant. Anschober sees definite chances to prevent the 
completion of Temelin. In the Czech Republic rejection of the 
nuclear power plant is growing and the financing by the United 
States is hanging "on a silk thread." This is why Austria 
should massively intervene in the last stage of decisionmaking 
by the U.S. Congress on financial guarantees and environmental 
compatibility. At the hearing by the U.S. Congress Banking 
Committee, which is scheduled for 23 February, Austria should be 
represented by the chancellor and an expert committee. 
  Chancellor Vranitzky stressed that Austria will "urge a 
thorough and comprehensive examination of the project's 
ecological compatibility." There are indications that approval 
"would certainly not be a matter of course." At the government 
level Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina will discuss the matter 
with his U.S. counterpart. Nationalrat President Heinz Fischer 
will make use of parliamentary contacts in the United States. 
There is no reason for discouragement or panic-mongering, nor 
can "one speak of a lack of dedication at all." 
  The chancellor pointed out that the Austrian Government has 
repeatedly expressed its concern about Temelin to the Czech 
Republic. Also a paper on energy supply has been presented, and 
it has been pointed out that the completion of Temelin as a 
gas-steam power plant would be more sensible also from the 
economic point of view. According to Vranitzky, a position 
paper on Temelin, which was drawn up by the Chancellor's Office, 
was sent both to the Eximbank as well as to the responsible 
committee chairmen of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives last September. In addition, last year Health 
Minister Michael Ausserwinkler, who is responsible for radiation 
protection, represented Austria's interests in the United States. 
  Generally, Vranitzky pointed to Austria's intensive 
activities for years, involving the promotion of closing down, 
alternatives, and reequipment of nuclear power plants both by 
arguments as well as by industrial, technical, and financial 
cooperation. He is aware of the fact that his concept of a 
nuclear-power-plant-free Central Europe cannot be implemented 
overnight, he said. However, Vranitzky expressed the conviction 
that this is "more than the hobby of an Austrian head of 
government; it is the defense of vital Austrian interests."

<F P=106> [Report signed "D. N.": "`Aggressive Act' Against Austria"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- Peter Pilz, spokesman of the Greens 
Federal Executive Committee, said that the credit guarantees for 
the continuation of the construction of the Czech nuclear power 
plant Temelin at Austria's border is an "aggressive act against 
the vital interests of the Austrian people." The Austrian 
Government has to respond to this "most serious attack on 
Austria's interests, at least in the past 20 years," with an 
official protest and by recalling the Austrian ambassador to the 
United States, Pilz demanded at a news conference yesterday, 
Tuesday [1 February]. A little later, after the Cabinet 
meeting, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky (Social Democratic Party of 
Austria -- SPOe) affirmed his rejection of the nuclear power 
plant construction, without dealing with Pilz's demand. 
Vranitzky: "We will not stop our activities." It is intended 
to offer again conversion to a gas-steam power station to the 
Czech Republic. He also asked Nationalrat President Heinz 
Fischer (SPOe) to "contact his U.S. counterpart," the chancellor 
stated.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky </F>
by Robert Hochner; Hochner is in the ORF studio in Vienna, 
Vranitzky's location not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Hochner] Chancellor, what is the point of 
Austrian attempts to stop the completion of the Temelin nuclear 
power plant after this clear -- and one is tempted to say harsh 
-- "no" from Prague? 
  [Vranitzky] The more difficult a political issue is, the 
more levelheaded the statesmen have to be. I have heard that 
[Czech Prime Minister] Mr. Klaus said today that the decision in 
favor of Temelin is a decision by the sovereign Czech state, and 
Prague is not willing to accept any interference in its 
sovereignty. The point, however, is that this is not a question 
of sovereignty. The sovereignty of the Czech Republic is as 
undisputed as is Austria's. The real point is that if an 
accident were to occur, a nuclear power plant, particularly one 
that is so close to the Austrian state border, is not only a 
risk for the sovereign Czech Republic, but also a risk for the 
people who live in the neighboring countries. This is why I have 
been trying hard for years to make people carefully reconsider 
the completion or the construction of any new nuclear power 
plants and to look for alternatives in terms of energy policy. 
  Moreover, Mr. Klaus said that we Austrians always henpeck 
the 
Czech Republic and not, for example, Germany or Switzerland. 
This is not true. We are not happy about any nuclear power 
plant in our neighborhood. Yet, the half-completed or completed 
nuclear power plants in the Czech and Slovak Republics all use 
Russian technology. Besides, one must not forget the terrible 
accident at Chernobyl, that is to say a nuclear power plant 
built with Russian technology, where the radiation did not 
respect sovereign borders, but affected large parts of East and 
Central Europe. 
  [Hochner] Chancellor, Prague's "no" will certainly hamper 
Austrian efforts. In the debate in the Austrian Parliament 
today, deputies complained to you that the Austrian Federal 
Government was not fighting hard enough against the construction 
of Temelin, and that, for example, you were not ready to address 
the U.S. Congress in connection with that credit guarantee, that 
is to say, to go to the United States. 
  [Vranitzky] Based on what you have just asked me, one must 
say that the decision was taken in Prague, or at least people 
say that it was taken in Prague. It means that our problem with 
the Czech Republic is one issue. Since the Czechs will not 
finance this power plant alone, but rely on a major credit from 
the American Eximbank, the United States constitutes another 
factor. 
  I do, however, take the accusations that were brought up in 
today's debate in Parliament only relatively serious. After 
all, had my efforts and the efforts of the Austrian Federal 
Government so far not had any effect, then Mr. Klaus would not 
have come up with this rather strong statement today. 
  By way of summing up, I would say that the whole matter can, 
of course, be decided by the Czechs as a sovereign people. At 
the same time, it is a subject where, in my capacity as Austrian 
chancellor, it is my duty not only to respect sovereignty, but 
also to take into account the fears and interests of the 
Austrian population, and to take them seriously. Therefore, we 
will certainly initiate a new round of efforts, and we will 
voice our reservations -- our reservations in terms of economic, 
ecological, and energy policy -- in the United States, where 
this major credit might be granted in the near future; yet, we 
will certainly also -- even though, Mr. Klaus has described that 
as pure dreams or daydreams -- renew Austria's offers, Austria's 
many offers in terms of energy and industrial policy. 
  I am fully aware that success cannot be achieved overnight 
in 
this major and most important issue. Yet what is at stake are 
vital interests of the Austrian and also the Czech population, 
and I will certainly not accept today's declaration as the last 
word and lie back and say that nothing can be done. 
  [Hochner] Chancellor, the Temelin power plant is to be 
refitted with U.S. technology, which explains the U.S. credit. 
Some power plants in Austria's neighborhood are much more 
dangerous, such as the old Russian reactors in Bohunice, or the 
old Russian reactors in Paks, near Budapest, not to mention the 
15 Chernobyl-type reactors that are still operating. Would the 
money for Austria's security and the political impetus not be 
better invested if one could shut down these old and notoriously 
dangerous power plants with Austrian help? 
  [Vranitzky] We must not make the mistake now to forget all 
the others issues and problems only because we are discussing 
Temelin today. Of course, everybody knows that we are engaged 
in a very serious debate with the Slovak Government regarding 
the Bohunice power plant. And everybody who takes an interest 
in such issues also knows that were are negotiating with the 
Slovene Government about shutting down the Krsko nuclear power 
plant, which is located in an earthquake zone, and that we have 
presented our ideas and reservations to all those states, even 
though it was not just reservations, but also offers for 
developing alternatives and cooperating with us to build 
state-of-the-art power plants that are not based on nuclear 
fission. 
  We are always told that, for example, in northern Czechia 
there are so many hazardous coal-fired plants, which have led to 
chronic lung and eye diseases among children and adults, that 
the nuclear power plants are needed to shut down the old 
coal-fired power plants. 
  Moreover, only because the matter was raised today, nobody 
must think that this is a new discussion or that we are just 
reacting to a single case. No, we are the only government in 
all of Europe -- and I am the only government head -- that has 
dealt with these dangers. Our efforts are not supported by the 
others, as we can see in the countries that operate those power 
plants or those who want to build them. However, this does not 
stop me from tackling the issue again and again. Even if 
somebody describes our efforts as daydreaming or utopian, it was 
always through utopian ideas that mankind achieved progress. 
  [Hochner] Thank you very much, chancellor, and good night. 
  [Vranitzky] Thank you, good night.

<F P=106> [Conrad Seidl report: "Eastern Weapons for the Austrian </F>
Army?"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- It is considered to be one of the most 
effective combat planes in the world and had been the terror of 
NATO air defenses for years -- today it is a Russian export hit. 
Most recently the MiG-29 (tactical NATO name "Fulcrum") has 
been flown in Malaysia and India, and by the German Bundeswehr 
and the Hungarian Air Force. Only in the Austrian Army, where 
successors for the Draken interceptors that date back to the 
1950's, are currently being considered, is restraint being 
exercised. 
  For John Gudenus, Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] deputy, 
who 
is himself an Army colonel, this is completely incomprehensible: 
"There is not even an attempt to negotiate, even though this 
would be the most elegant way to somehow get back the 54.7 
billion schillings in debts that Russia has accrued in Austria." 
  The deal that Gudenus proposes -- weapons in return for a 
remission of debts -- has been made by others: At the end of 
last year Slovakia bought Russian weapons for 2.1 billion 
schillings, including five single-seater and one two-seater MiG- 
29's. 
  However, these Russian combat planes (equipped with six 
missiles and a fixed cannon) have the disadvantage of requiring 
more fuel and maintenance than modern aircraft of Western 
standards. In order to counter the high maintenance costs, 
Slovakia has established its own repair yard, 120 km from 
Bratislava. Slovakia is reportedly interested in having this 
yard work to capacity through maintenance cooperation with 
others who use this kind of aircraft. 
  Gudenus: "Such a procurement would also have the advantage 
of sending a political signal: It would make it easier for 
Russia to regain its credit standing and, at the same time, 
Russia would not constantly be pushed into the role of the evil 
one." 
  The FPOe expert also advocates buying other weapons and 
equipment from Russia -- from the S-300 antiaircraft missile to 
the wheeled armored vehicle (BTR-70, BTR-80) to the Mi-24 combat 
helicopter ("Hind"). The latter was not taken over by the 
Bundeswehr from the stocks of the National People's Army (to the 
displeasure of the German Audit Office), which was justified by 
pointing to operating costs and a lack of compatibility with 
NATO equipment. 
  Says Gudenus bitterly: "As long as our Army is not 
compatible with the European level in terms of defense, we need 
not be worried about compatibility with the West." In addition, 
we are more acquainted with Russian components and instruments, 
because they work with metric measures while U.S. suppliers 
stick with the imperial scale.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Silver Lining to the Economic </F>
Clouds"] 
  [Text] In the course of the recovery in West Europe in 
1994, Austria's economic development will slowly get out of the 
period of shrinking, Andreas Woergoetter, economic researcher at 
the Institute for Higher Studies (IHS), says with cautious 
optimism. 
  In particular the revival of the economic development in the 
United States has a positive effect, Woergoetter says. Thus, 
domestic exports to the United States strongly increased last 
year. 
  At the moment a strong and "healthy" impulse is coming from 
the United States, because growth is still taking place without 
an acceleration of inflation. The other large industrial 
nations are currently not able to generate their own stimuli 
since they must cope with far-reaching structural adjustment 
problems, Woergoetter says. 
  "There is no doubt that the low point of the recession has 
been overcome, but the upward movement is very slow," Ewald 
Walterskirchen, economic development expert of the Economic 
Research Institute (WIFO), says, assessing the current economic 
situation. The signals from the United States and the Austrian 
tax reform do have a positive effect, but the trust of the 
investors is not yet there. Last year industry's plans for 
investments were reduced by about 20 percent, this year 
Walterskirchen expects a 4-percent decline. 
  Walterskirchen, too, does not see any reason at the moment 
to 
revise the forecasts for Austria (WIFO: 1.5 percent growth of 
the real GDP; IHS: 1.4 percent). 
  Both researchers see problems for the FRG, Austria's most 
important economic partner. The tax increases that have been 
announced for 1995 could have a dampening effect on growth.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ter Beek Considers Bosnia Task As </F>
`of Great Importance'"] 
  [Text] The Netherlands Government is strongly opposed to 
the idea that the United Nations should withdraw from the former 
Yugoslavia. Earlier there was talk of the British and French 
Governments in particular considering such a withdrawal. 
According to The Hague, such a withdrawal would result in the 
"moral bankruptcy" of the international community. 
  Defense Minister Ter Beek considers the humanitarian task of 
the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] in Bosnia as being "of great 
importance" and the deployment of Netherlands troops as 
"exceptionally meaningful," the minister said in Parliament on 
Tuesday [1 February]. 
  Parliament was informed of recent details concerning the 
stationing of the 1,230 troops from the Army's reinforced Light 
Mobile Battalion in central and eastern Bosnia. Parliament was 
in full agreement over the stationing of the troops. 
  Senior officials, who met with the European Union's 
Political 
Affairs Committee, confirmed in Brussels on Tuesday that none of 
the member states was considering a unilateral withdrawal of 
troops from Bosnia. According to Ter Beek, the departure of the 
United Nations from Bosnia would "increase fighting and human 
rights violations. It would mean accepting aggression, 
atrocities, and rule of the strongest. That is too high a 
price." 
  Ter Beek was pleased with Parliament's support for sending 
troops to the Muslim enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa, which must 
be protected. "The Netherlands will keep its word, also in 
difficult circumstances," the minister stated. 
  His fellow party member, Van Traa, stressed that Parliament 
would continue to support the dispatch of the Light Mobile 
Battalion even if there were losses on the Netherlands side. He 
wanted to dispel the suggestion that The Hague "would get cold 
feet if body bags started coming back to Schiphol airport." 
  Ter Beek and General Van der Vlis, chief of the defense 
staff, reassured Parliament that the Netherlands ground troops 
are going to Bosnia "well trained, sufficiently armed, and 
highly motivated." The 750 men of the Light Mobile Battalion 
are carrying out their mission at the UN request in Srebrenica 
and Zepa. 
  The logistics support unit of 480 men is stationed in 
Lukavac, 140 and 190 kilometers from Srebrenica and Zepa 
respectively. In spite of this, Ter Beek considers this to be 
the best location as the town is close to the reopened Tuzla 
airfield and can be easily reached from Zagreb and Split. 
  Ter Beek confirmed that the Security Council and NATO 
Council 
are required to give express permission for carrying out air 
strikes against Serbian targets. These would be reprisal 
bombings and would make UNPROFOR a party to the conflict. The 
minister sees the risks of this as too high. 
  Air support can, however, be granted for the direct defense 
of the Netherlands units. Also, if these units are obstructed 
from carrying out their task or if they are met with violence in 
carrying out their task, then both air support by NATO and 
ground support by other UNPROFOR contingents may be granted. 
  One 1 March, a Netherlands brigade general is to be 
appointed 
chief of staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina command in Kiseljac, 
headed by General Rose, of Britain, for one year. According to 
Ter Beek, the appointment to this "senior, difficult and 
important position" is partly due to the Netherlands' 
substantial contribution to UNPROFOR.

accusing the FRODEBU [Burundi Democratic Front] party, which won 
the elections and has a large majority in the National Assembly, 
of trying to stage a civilian coup d'etat and trying to start 
the institutions decapitated by the assassination of President 
Ndadaye working again. The opposition accuses the FRODEBU 
cadres and members of having organized the massacres in which 
tens of thousands of Tutsis were killed. 
  The government, which has led a reclusive life in the Hotel 
du Lac since October, fearing that its surviving members might 
also be liquidated, has tried, with difficulty, to overcome its 
traumas. It has tried to do so with great distrust, because the 
putschists are still at liberty and Uganda has just refused to 
extradite four of them! An important stage was the appointment 
of a new head of state: This was achieved by a consensus 
between FRODEBU, which has a majority, and UPRONA [National 
Union and Progress Party], the main opposition party; Cyprien 
Ntaryamira won the votes of 78 out of 79 deputies in the 
National Assembly. This unanimity ought to have relaxed the 
atmosphere, but that was not the case: The radical opposition 
was in fact demanding that new presidential elections be 
organized, while the state of the country obviously makes the 
organization of such an election psychologically impossible and 
economically too costly. The extreme opposition, playing on 
legalism, also hoped that the Constitutional Court would back 
its interpretation of the Constitution. Following the election 
of Mr. Ntaryamira, the Constitutional Court was indeed consulted 
and, fearing that it might invalidate the vote in favor of the 
new president, the government preferred to dissolve it before it 
had even given its verdict, thus giving FRODEBU's opponents the 
pretext they were seeking to condemn the "civilian coup d'etat." 
[passage omitted] 
  The humanitarian organizations, the only groups that dared 
move around Bujumbura, fear new explosions of violence. Indeed, 
it seems that the Hutu population is not prepared to accept that 
the paralysis of the institutions by excessive legalism should 
deprive it of the election victory it won last June. 
  According to some reports, peasants in the hills have 
started 
cutting down trees and barricading roads again; perhaps to 
prevent incursions by the army. Perhaps the Tutsis also fear 
that new massacres are being planned.... It also seems clear 
that Tutsi extremists, whose putsch partly failed last October, 
are determined to paralyze government action. This would 
indicate that the coup d'etat, or rather the trial of strength, 
is not yet really over. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [Sinn Fein President] Mr Adams's visit continued 
to grab the headlines in New York today. His speech to the 
National Committee on American Foreign Policy's Northern Ireland 
conference was widely reported in the city's morning newspapers 
and on coast-to-coast television channels. The tabloid NEW YORK 
POST devoted a full page to Mr Adams and his movements and the 
more sedate NEW YORK TIMES also had detailed and extensive 
coverage. 
  Mr Adams was expected to maintain the publicity momentum 
through further TV interviews before leaving for Dublin from New 
York's Kennedy Airport tonight. He was also having further 
talks today with Irish-American politicians and trade union 
leaders sympathetic to the Irish republican cause. 
  Clearly cheered by the warmth of his welcome, Mr Adams was 
planning to deliver a "farewell message" to the American people. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. political commentators highlighted the 
possible harm done to Anglo-American relations by President 
Clinton's decision to grant Mr Adams a visa. It was thought, 
however, that the President might have compensated for any 
damage done to the "special relationship" by swiftly making 
clear last night that there would be no U.S. intervention on 
Northern Ireland. [passage omitted] 
  Mr Adams ended his visit by claiming the publicity which 
surrounded it was generated by the British Government. "Had 
they never objected in the first place to me coming to the U.S. 
and never tried to interfere with the affairs of the U.S., then 
no one would have noticed when I got here," he told a news 
conference. "They created the issue and brought it on 
themselves by putting pressure on the American authorites." 
  Criticism levelled at him by [British Prime Minister] Mr 
Major and [Foreign Secretary] Mr Hurd was contrived, he said. 
"They are trying to ensure that when another visa application 
is made it will cause more controversy. I think people here 
will resist them. This is just the hysteria of the British 
House of Commons." [passage omitted] 
  Mr Adams said Mr Clinton's decision to allow him a visa was 
"the right thing to do, and a very sound gesture that makes the 
right signals and creates the right climate." Asked whether the 
cause of peace had been advanced by his visit, he declared: "It 
is very, very hard to make peace. It requires two sides to make 
up just as it requires two sides to make war." He insisted that 
he wanted an end to violence in Northern Ireland. 
  The beginning of the news conference was marked by an 
outburst of applause from a number of republican supporters in 
the room with journalists. 
  Mr Adams flies back to Ireland later tonight. During his 
final hours in New York he met trade union leaders and 
politicians with an Irish interest.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Gerry Adams Should Be Told"] </F>
  [Text] As Gerry Adams settles in for the first of what 
will doubtless be many television interviews in the course of 
his short visit to the U.S., he may reflect on what this 
unexpected foreign trip says about his own organisation, and the 
all-important shift in American foreign policy. The decision to 
grant him a visa marks a reversal of President Clinton's ruling 
last November. Then Mr Adams was refused entry on the grounds 
that he was involved in devising IRA strategy at the highest 
level -- that as, a terrorist. Since then things have changed. 
But an underlying consistency can nevertheless be discerned. 
  For a start, the visit takes place under tight constraints. 
Mr Adams is in New York to attend a conference on Northern 
Ireland organised by the National Committee on American Foreign 
Policy, whose honorary chairman is the former U.S. Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger. (The other sides in the Ulster conflict 
have also been invited, although Unionist politicians have 
refused to attend.) Mr Adams is not allowed to engage in 
fundraising and he is barred from travelling more than 25 miles 
from New York. 
  While the Sinn Fein president no doubt hopes to persuade the 
Irish-American lobby to put pressure on the Clinton 
Administration to intervene on behalf of the republican cause, 
pressure can also work the other way. A conference such as the 
present one provides a prime opportunity for interested American 
parties to make clear to Mr Adams that present developments 
provide a chance for peace which should not be wasted. Mr 
Clinton's original plan to send a peace envoy to the province 
was rapidly watered down after the presidential elections in the 
face of resistance from the British Government. The permission 
for Mr Adams to attend the New York conference may be a sign 
that Washington is adopting a more subtle approach. Last 
November the speaker of the House of Representatives, Tom Foley, 
noted that Sinn Fein could be part of constitutional talks if 
there was a genuine and convincing repudiation of paramilitary 
violence. It is a message which must be repeated to Mr Adams. 
He is seen now as a possible instrument for peace -- but he 
must also be reminded that he is an obstacle to it as well. 
  The Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneux boasted in his 
interview with THE SCOTSMAN that he had succeeded in removing 
all the meat from the Downing Street declaration. If that claim 
is to be gainsayed, the U.S. may have to lean on Mr Major and 
persuade him to begin turning the sentiments expressed in the 
document into reality: Their task will be made that much easier 
if they have first gained concessions from Adams.

<F P=106> [Article by Thierry Brehier: "Disappointed Majority"] </F>
  [Text] Left-wing politicians criticize. As an opposition 
force, this is their prerogative. But right-wing politicians 
have been either acerbic -- those who belong to the RPR [Rally 
for the Republic] -- or gently mocking -- those who belong to 
the UDF [Union for French Democracy]. The right therefore has 
been failing to do its job, which is to support the government. 
In fact, reactions to the measures announced on Sunday 30 
January by Edouard Balladur after a government "seminar" can all 
be summed up with a single word: disappointment. 
Disappointment with the feeble steps taken to bolster economic 
growth. Disappointment with the few, unimaginative job creation 
incentives. Disappointment with the postponement of the tough 
but crucial decisions needed to save the French health insurance 
system. 
  For a large part, of course, such lack of support from the 
prime minister's own side can be traced to strictly political 
motives; however, he also has his own behavior to blame. In an 
attempt to cast into oblivion his retreat -- that is, his 
failure -- on the revision of the Falloux Act, Mr. Balladur had 
insisted that it would not steer him away from reform and that 
he would prove his point on the occasion of the government 
seminar, which was meant to act on the French people's main 
concern (jobs) and the most delicate issue of all, which has 
plagued governments for a long time (social security). 
  The goals were so ambitious that achieving them was never 
going to be easy. The prime minister failed simply because the 
way he trained his horse was not likely to let him overcome this 
particular hurdle. Owing to his carefully constructed image of 
a quiet administrator, Mr. Balladur could not afford to look 
like he was putting out a "new plan" that contradicted the 
policy he has been conducting since he came into office. Hence 
the difficulty of introducing real consumption-boosting measures 
since during the past 10 months he has steadily ruled out 
demand-driven recovery measures, preferring instead 
supply-driven ones. Having chosen tight control of public 
expenditures as his first article of faith, he cannot introduce 
excessively costly proposals. 
  Furthermore, the "Balladur method" was bound to complicate 
matters. The bitter Falloux affair strengthened the prime 
minister in his resolve to eschew anything likely to anger the 
population. Like Michel Rocard when he was prime minister -- 
could this stem from the fact that, as for Mr. Rocard, his prime 
ministership is meant to be a springboard for his presidential 
ambitions? -- Mr. Balladur believes no reform is possible 
without it being accepted by a majority of the French 
population. Hence, although he denies it, the extreme attention 
he has been paying to opinion polls -- again, just like Mr. 
Rocard. 
<H5>  Clash of Ambitions </H5>
  This concern explains Balladur's insisting on Sunday that 
"consultations" on all sensitive issues will be held; however, 
it also let him postpone measures on social security which he 
knew were bound to irritate the medical lobby, so influent 
within his majority. This is also a letdown -- no matter what 
he said in his Sunday press conference -- since in his general 
policy statement of 8 April he had already announced a five-year 
law meant to bring "sustainable balance" to the health insurance 
system. 
  All this explains why a number of tangible measures 
developed 
in various ministries were rejected in the final round of 
decisions. Above all, it explains the feeling of disappointment: 
Expectations had been brought to fever pitch by the very 
attitude of the head of government, his ministers, and their 
staff. 
  This is a chance Edouard Balladur's rivals were not about to 
miss. In the UDF, those who, like Charles Millon, have not been 
"Balladurized" saw it as an opportunity to toot their own horn, 
in order to let their views and existence be felt. Even Raymond 
Barre said he favored another direction, although he reserved 
judgment on the actual measures and approved many aspects of the 
government's policy. At the RPR, those who remain loyal to 
Jacques Chirac will not approve the initiatives of a man with 
whom their "boss" has been feuding almost openly, and when one 
-- like Jean-Louis Debre -- is asked for his views on the 
matter, he hastens to point out the shortcomings of the 
government's plan and to call for "another policy." 
  Such is the clash of ambitions between the Paris Mayor 
[Jacques Chirac] and the prime minister that as long as he does 
not have to, the former will give the latter no support which 
would tie his hand for the future. These reactions to the 
measures announced on Sunday are a confirmation, for the prime 
minister, that 15 months before the presidential election, he 
can now only count on himself and on those who have bound their 
fate with his own. Of course, that is still a lot of people.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 2 (AFP) -- The French Government 
announced aid totalling 300 million francs ($50 million) to the 
fishing industry Wednesday [2 February] after violent protests 
by fishermen protesting at low prices for their catches. 
  Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech told 
fishermen's representatives here they could have half in grants 
and half in low-interest loans, with 10 million francs released 
immediately for families in the most difficulty. 
  Puech also said all fishing firms would have their welfare 
charges cut by half, at an estimated total cost of 83 million 
francs, and added that he had asked the European Community to 
fix minimum prices for seven species of fish. 
  French fishermen on the west coast have kept their boats in 
port and staged frequent clashes with police since their 
protests came to a head last weekend as fish prices fell to an 
all-time low. 
  They have said that by Monday all fish markets would be 
closed, with nothing to auction. 
  Wednesday's handouts came before a scheduled meeting between 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Puech with fishermen at 
Rennes, the Brittany capital, on Friday, when they had been 
promised a stormy reception. 
  In the north Brittany port of Roscoff late Tuesday some 100 
fishermen and their wives seized and dumped crates of Scottish 
fish that had arrived by ferry from Plymouth, southern England, 
police said Wednesday. 
  Further south, in Lorient, fishermen sacked refrigerated 
warehouses in violent clashes which injured 17 police. Nine 
protestors were arrested and released only after a battle at the 
police station where they were being held. 
  In Brussels a European Commission spokesman said earlier 
Wednesday that the commission does not intend any immediate 
reestablishment of minimum import prices for certain fish 
species, since no European Community member had requested such a 
move. 
  Such minimum prices were set for the March-December period 
last year for six species, while a minimum price for Atlantic 
salmon was applied from mid-November last year until January 31 
this year. 
  The spokesman said no member had supplied the commission 
with 
figures showing a marked drop in market prices for one or more 
species. 
  At the most recent meeting of EC fishing ministers, held in 
December, the commission pledged to reintroduce such minimum 
prices as soon as circumstances called for it. 
  The EC fishing ministers are not scheduled to meet again 
until April 12. 
  Speaking after a cabinet meeting here earlier Wednesday, 
Puech conceded that fish prices had "fallen sharply" and that 
the situation was "very difficult." 
  "Emergency measures" are needed, he said, adding: "The 
government will actively support this sector." 
  The government announcement also came as Brittany fishermen 
were heading for a mass demonstration Thursday in the channel 
port of Boulogne-sur-Mer, the main port for fish imports. 
  The strikers voted to allow ferries to continue operating 
provided they carry no fish. 
  Breton fishermen greeted Puech's package with skepticism 
late 
Wednesday, saying that it would make little difference.

<F P=106> [Article signed G.S.: "Aeronautics: Sextant Avionique and </F>
Allied Signal Abandon Joint Venture Plans"] 
  [Text] After failing to find a "satisfactory" integration 
arrangement for their civilian and military activities, the two 
partners called it quits. 
  Sextant Avionique and the U.S. group Allied Signal, who had 
been talking of a potential joint venture in the avionics field 
since August, have agreed to abandon this project. "Exhaustive 
studies (...) have confirmed that the two companies are well 
positioned on their markets, but that it would not be possible 
to find satisfactory arrangements for an effective integration 
of Allied Signal's civilian activities and Sextant Avionique's 
civilian and military operations," says the French firm in a 
communique. 
  "The confidential nature of our defense activities (45 
percent of avionics sales) required too complex a structure," is 
the rationale given by Sextant Avionique, which is approaching 
the event philosophically. "Such things happen; however, all 
the work we did together in the last few months will not be 
wasted. We shall be able to arrange more flexible partnerships 
with Allied in the future." An agreement with the U.S. firm 
would have broadened Sextant's business opportunities in the 
United States, where the French equipment manufacturer has 
already made some headway through work done on the Boeing 777. 
  Sextant Avionique, which has been restructuring after going 
private and after Aerospatiale's partial withdrawal from its 
capital in favor of Thomson-CSF (which now controls 66.6 percent 
of the firm's shares) as well as the sale of Crouzet 
Electromenager [household appliances] to Emerson Electric, is 
currently locked in an wage dispute. After announcing, in early 
January, a wage freeze which led to a walkout last Monday, the 
company offered individual raises, a proposal which, according 
to the CFDT [French Confederation of Labor], was rejected as 
"discriminatory" by a majority of unions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Summary of `Declaration of Intent' </F>
of Progressive Area Parties; Central Points of Agreement"] 
  [Text] Rome -- These are the main points of the progressive 
forces' "declaration of intent": 

  -  We want to promote a new 
democratic pact among the Italian people -- a new and closer 
rapport between rights and duties based on a real and widespread 
exercise of democratic responsibility; 
  -  There must be a 
redistribution and decentralization of powers in order to 
achieve the most effective balance between national unity and 
the system of local government; 
  -  To open up new paths for the 
country's economic and social development, while at the same 
time guaranteeing public finance reform, employment growth, and 
the safeguarding of the country's environmental and cultural 
heritage; 
  -  In order to restore dynamism to the economy, to defeat 
parasitism and the abuse of the welfare state, it is necessary 
to redefine public intervention and to promote privatization, 
when appropriate, on the basis of a stringent analysis of the 
merits of each individual case in order to assess which really 
are useful to the community; 
  -  The reduction of the deficit will 
entail austerity, but we undertake to guarantee that the 
sacrifices will be shared fairly and that they will not 
adversely affect the living standards of the most disadvantaged, 
to whom the state must indeed guarantee the rights of 
citizenship -- health, education, work, housing, and social 
security, that is, an improvement of their present living 
conditions; 
  -  This means a more temperate and supportive society 
in which the welfare state -- no longer abused or corrupt -- 
will develop into an integrated system of protection.... The 
public role of education, training, health, and of the social 
services as a whole must be guaranteed and emphasized. All 
economic development options must also be subjected to 
obligatory environmental evaluation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Libero Gualtieri, Senate floor leader of the </F>
Italian Republican Party, by Marco Marozzi in Cesena; date not 
given: "We Will Carry On; La Malfa Must Reconsider" -- first 
two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Cesena -- "We are not saying, `we obey.' The 
left abandoned by the PRI [Italian Republican Party] is a left 
betrayed throughout the country. It is very irresponsible, 
serious political error. And we do not accept it." 
  The senator displayed his old mettle, calm but resolute -- 
the quality that caused him to be both appreciated and feared 
during his long and difficult years as chairman of the 
parliamentary violations committee. At his home in Cesena, 
Libero Gualtieri, the PRI's senate floor leader, was waiting "to 
see what is going on in Rome, what is being decided. Everything 
is still in flux," he said, "and I do not want to exacerbate the 
situation." However, his ideas are quite clear: "We will 
remain within the Democratic Alliance [AD] as a federated force, 
with all that this may entail." [passage omitted] 
  [Marozzi] Does staying in the AD mean taking part in the 
progressive alignment's negotiations, discussing policies and 
candidates? 
  [Gualtieri] We are staying in the arena. The majority of the 
PRI in Emilia-Romagna are siding with the progressive front. We 
do not want to be thrown out; we do not want to split the PRI, 
or to leave. But neither do we want to relinquish the policy in 
which we believe. 
  [Marozzi] But [PRI Secretary] La Malfa has threatened 
expulsion: "Whoever stands as a candidate with the left, with 
the AD, will be out of the party," he said. 
  [Gualtieri] Whom will they expel? Half the party? Its 
command? Visentini, its 14 deputies, and the floor leaders of 
the lower house and the Senate, who reject the center? The UIL 
[Italian Federation of Trade Unions], the cooperatives of the 
Republican area that are remaining within the AD? All this is 
important. 
  [Marozzi] Among the progressive forces, your own candidacy 
seemed to be a certainty, one of the few capable of enjoying 
everyone's approval. What will you do now? Will you be running 
again? 
  [Gualtieri] I do not know. It depends on how things turn 
out. Either there is a policy that can help the country, or.... 
  [Marozzi] Will you remain with the progressive forces, come 
what may? 
  [Gualtieri] Why should someone like me join the center? 
  [Marozzi] That is what La Malfa wants. 
  [Gualtieri] We shall see what happens to the entire party 
structure. Everything is still in flux. A hard trial of 
strength is under way. Certainly, we represent the PRI in 
Romagna and Emilia. We command a majority, and are thus able to 
decide with whom to align. We are the ones who are taking part 
in consultations, who will forge agreements. 
  [Marozzi] Do you not consider it paradoxical that 
Republicans 
could be running on opposite lists? 
  [Gualtieri] It is not we who changed our policy. In any 
case, I said long ago that the new electoral system would impose 
a substantial regionalization of politics, that the Republicans 
would have to come to terms with some very different situations, 
that it was impossible to expect consistent conduct between 
North and South, or a single system of alliances. Be that as it 
may, La Malfa does not seem to me to have realized what has 
happened in Italy over the past three or four weeks. 
  [Marozzi] What? 
  [Gualtieri] There has been a large-scale restructuring of 
the 
right, on all sides. The Northern League allying with [Forza 
Italia leader] Berlusconi, the Democratic Christian Center, the 
MSI [Italian Social Movement] threatening to conquer the south. 
One must also consider the Catania provincial elections, not to 
mention what is happening in Puglia, Calabria. We are 
witnessing a phenomenon that seemed impossible until two months 
ago, when a victory by the progressive forces was too 
confidently forecast as a certainty. It seems to me a terrible 
mistake to abandon the left now, to withdraw a democratic 
linchpin such as the PRI. 
  [Marozzi] What is the danger? 
  [Gualtieri] Being overwhelmed. Whatever lay behind the 
interests defeated by Bribe City is now emerging. The old 
system is being reestablished in an even more extreme form. It 
is necessary to make a choice, even if it means paying for the 
mistakes over the electoral law. 
  [Marozzi] But to many Republicans it seems unnatural to form 
a common front with [Communist Renewal Chairman] Cossutta. 
  [Gualtieri] True, there is some internal differentiation 
within the left. True, we do not agree at all with some 
stances. But the elections cannot be won by running outside a 
progressive front which nevertheless represents the change in 
the left over the years, its essence a part of the country's 
heritage. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] is certainly 
no longer the PCI [Italian Communist Party], and Ugo La Malfa 
always taught us that the PRI represents the other focus of the 
left. Certainly not of the center or of the right.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Social Movement Secretary Gianfranco </F>
Fini by Marco Ventura in Rome; date not given: "Bossi Does Not 
Want Us Because He Is Scared" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- So how did your meeting with Berlusconi go? 
Gianfranco Fini feigned surprise: "What meeting? There was no 
meeting." There are strong rumors that the MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] secretary and National Alliance coordinator took 
advantage of Berlusconi's presence in Rome to meet with the 
Forza Italia leader. "That is untrue. When we do have a 
meeting with him, it will be official." 
  [Ventura] Very well. What is certain, however, is that 
[Northern League Secretary] Bossi said: "Either with us or with 
the fascists." 
  [Fini] That shows he is scared. He is very well aware that 
his leadership will collapse if he reaches agreements with other 
forces. I believe he is terrified of Berlusconi's involvement, 
and he has sent him an ultimatum with the attitude of someone 
who wants not to form an alliance but to carry out an annexation. 
  [Ventura] There is a preclusion against you. 
  [Fini] We asked Bossi to explain to us whether or not he 
considers national unity a good thing. Not only has he not 
replied, but he has not progressed beyond his anti-fascist 
anathema; that is, a stance that not even the left identifies 
with now. 
  [Ventura] There is less and less time in which to reach an 
agreement. 
  [Fini] Bossi will realize this on 27 March. We will 
certainly not remain passive. We will have our own candidates 
in the north, and Bossi will realize that he does not enjoy 
hegemony in the north at all. Obviously, he will not receive a 
single vote in the center and south, which will inevitably 
confine him to the role of a regional leader. For the present! 
Because in a while he may not even be a leader in the north. 
  [Ventura] The compactness of the anti-left alliance is at 
stake. 
  [Fini] Bossi is shouldering a huge responsibility, and is 
doing so because he either cannot or will not resolve the real 
issue. Which is not fascist ideology but national unity. I do 
not believe that Berlusconi and the centrists are willing to be 
treated like underlings in the north or to submit to vetoes in 
the south. 
  [Ventura] What will you do, unless a miracle occurs? 
  [Fini] We will field candidates in all the single-candidate 
constituencies throughout Italy. I will not form pacts, at 
least not within a national political context; otherwise, I 
would be lending strength to the League's theory of the two or 
three Italy's. 
  [Ventura] Is it possible to imagine a pact with Berlusconi 
but not with the League? 
  [Fini] Maybe, yes, if there is an agreement on programs. It 
remains to be seen how Berlusconi will respond to the ultimatum. 
Bossi is trying to play Russian roulette. 
  [Ventura] What about the agreement between Berlusconi and 
the 
neocentrists? 
  [Fini] I read the communique, and I consider the reference 
to 
the absence of preclusions a good thing: They have the feeling 
that Bossi wants them to serve his interests in the north and to 
consign them to defeat in the south. 
  [Ventura] Is it possible to resolve the split over whom to 
put forward for the premiership? 
  [Fini] Bossi cannot say who it should be. If he accepts an 
alliance, he is automatically placing himself in a subordinate 
position with respect to whomever he may put forward. That 
would be the beginning of his downfall. If he stops shouting 
and starts reasoning, he will lose his support. For my part, I 
am standing aside. I am not a candidate or even a potential 
candidate. The only person capable of commanding support in the 
north, and in the south, is Berlusconi. Not Bossi -- and not 
only because of his language and behavior, but also because, as 
I have said, he is a regional leader. 
  [Ventura] Could you name some of your candidates? 
  [Fini] I do not like this candidate game. It is much more 
important to field candidates who are well established in their 
own areas -- perhaps supported by trade, business, and 
agricultural organizations -- than to field 20 outgoing deputies 
of parties that no longer exist, or famous names that served as 
enticements under the proportional system. I am not seeking 
names for their own sake. 
  [Ventura] Has [world diving record holder] Enzo Majorca said 
yes? 
  [Fini] I heard about Majorca through IL GIORNALE, I made 
inquiries, and I was told that talks are going on. 
  [Ventura] Would you give us an election forecast 
  [Fini] I am very confident. Our success in Catania shows 
that I am not deluding myself. If we project that result to the 
level of the contest in the single-candidate constituencies, the 
figures would secure victory for us in every constituency. 
Catania is not Italy, but nevertheless....

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Elections at Catania, Good-Bye to </F>
the Left"] 
  [Text] In the elections for the renewal of the Provincial 
Council, the "progressive" representative takes third place 
only. The contenders in the final ballot are the candidate from 
the right (with 32.8 percent of the votes) and the candidate 
from the center (26.3 percent). 
  These are surprise results in the provincial elections in 
Catania. Little more than six months after the choice of Enzo 
Bianco as "progressive" mayor of Palermo, the city has suddenly 
turned its back against the left, placing on the final ballot 
the National Alliance candidate Nello Musumeci and the Pact for 
Italy politician Stello Maugiameli. Rejected with no chance of 
appeal are Andrea Scudieri (PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], 
Communist Renewal, AD [Democratic Alliance], Rete, and the 
Greens) and Maurizio Pellegrino (socialist and PDS circles plus 
League). 
  National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fino is exultant: "This 
is the proof that we are not destined to fall into the hands of 
the left." Satisfied too are [Pact for Italy leader] Mario 
Segni, [Italian Republican Party Secretary] Giorgio La Malfa, 
and the CCD [Democratic Christian Center] neocentrists. Tolling 
the death knell, for the left, [PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto 
recited a late "mea culpa." "We should not be disheartened, but 
work hard, because the battle will be a hard one."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fini Exultant: This Is Just the </F>
Beginning"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "The left is not an unavoidable destiny for 
our country." [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini, on 
the day after convincing the party to "bless" the National 
Alliance, won the first electoral victory, and he did nothing to 
hide all his enthusiasm: "From Catania has come the first 
victory of the new right, the confirmation which rewards our 
desire to present ourselves as a governing force." But not only 
the National Alliance leader has reason to be delighted. The 
CCD [Democratic Christian Center] secessionists [from the 
People's Party] see in the Catania result the confirmation of 
their turn to the right. "This result demonstrates that the 
forces of the left can be beaten," a convinced Clemente Mastella 
explained, "and to tell the truth we are not overly surprised." 
  Cautious, but also clearly satisfied was [Pact for Italy 
leader] Mario Segni, who has received further proof that the 
left, without the members of the Pact, risks a heavy debacle. 
"The citizens who voted for the Pact's candidate have 
appreciated a campaign organized around problems and not 
ideologies," Mariotto [Segni] claimed, stating that he was 
determined to continue this strategy. The Catania results also 
represented a panacea for [Italian Radical Party--PRI Secretary] 
Giorgio La Malfa, who did not lose the opportunity to emphasize 
the correctness of his decision not to mix with the left. 
"Without Segni," the PRI secretary maintained, "the progressive 
line-up did not even get to the final ballot round." This 
confirms the National Council's decision not to accept the 
alliance with Rete and the Communist Renewal. The Italian 
Popular Party's [PPI] Giuseppe Gargani interpreted the results 
as a resurrection of the Christian Democratic Party [DC]: "The 
DC united in a serious pact with Segni's friends and with 
non-Catholics have permitted the center grouping to reach the 
final ballot." 
  A cry of alarm, on the other hand, comes from the Catholic 
associations: "If the contradictions and misunderstandings in 
the agreement between Segni and [PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli are 
not resolved," ACLI [Christian Association of Catholic Workers] 
Vice Chairman Michele Giacomantonio warned: "There is a danger 
of handing over Italy to the right and the extremists." 
  The Catania results are also increasing the League's 
interest 
in the National Alliance. "We are looking at it closely," the 
League's Senate floor leader Francesco Speroni maintained, 
opening up possibilities, "but we are waiting for them to make 
some concessions on the question of federalism." 
  On the left, in the meantime, they are reciting their "mea 
culpa." First of all mayor of Catania, Enzo Bianco, himself 
apologized. "The progressive grouping had the victory in its 
hands and yet managed to lose. The responsibility lies with 
those who allowed sectarianism and squabbling to prevail." 
Achille Occhetto added: "It is an alarm bell," the PDS 
secretary maintained, "because the battle will be long and we 
should not become disheartened but work hard and patiently." 
"The progressives lost because they were divided themselves," 
local PDS party manager Giulio Quercini stated. "This is a 
battle we have lost, but which can serve as a lesson to win the 
war on 27 March." In the socialist camp, despite the defeat of 
candidate Maurizio Pellegrino, there is an air of waiting to 
take revenge. "When vetoes and divisions prevail, it is the 
right which wins," PSI [Italian Socialist Party] Secretariat 
coordinator Enrico Boselli maintained, pleased to be finally in 
a position to give a lesson to everyone who did not want the 
Socialists to sit at the progressive front's negotiating table.

<F P=106> [Umberto Rosso report: "Alarm Over Subversion; Ciampi: `Now </F>
There Are Mercenaries Too'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- A war against the secret organizations, the 
subversive structures threatening the institutions. This is 
point number one on the report that [Prime Minister] Ciampi 
submitted to parliament yesterday: The semi-annual report on 
the secret services, which reviews the security situation 
through the second half of last year, sounds another alarm over 
destabilizing activity. Within this disturbing scenario there 
is also emerging "another subversive phenomenon, not yet 
well-defined." In this Italy racked by conspiracies, "mercenary 
elements" and people "prepared to engage in violent initiatives 
-- probably in the service of secret instigators -- are 
emerging." The soldiers of fortune sent in to mount the 
extraordinary attack on the RAI [Italian State Broadcasting 
Company] building at Saxa Rubra made the headlines. The threat 
from mercenaries now seems to be more serious than on that 
occasion. 
  The prime minister also denied the reports of [League 
Secretary] Bossi's home being bugged, of an espionage operation 
that the League claims Sismi carried out against the League. 
[League lower house floor leader] Maroni yesterday reiterated 
his suspicions ("It was confirmed to me by a couple of people 
who said they were former agents for the service and have 
evidence") and asked Ciampi and [Interior Minister] Mancino for 
a "political reply" within 24 hours. The government note states 
that the prime minister received from the security service 
chiefs "an assurance that they have never organized infiltration 
and interception activities or unconstitutional activities" with 
respect to the political parties. It stresses that any abuses 
would entail "the immediate dismissal of the persons concerned." 
  With regard to the report on secret service activities, 
which 
has also focused on the Mafia, the activities of left-wing and 
right-wing extremists, and channels of illegal immigration, 
which also serve for movements of weapons, drugs, and dangerous 
individuals, a request has been made to include the Mafia's 
infiltration of the major financial circles on the agenda for 
the G-7 summit to be held in Naples. But above all the 
government reaffirmed that activity to counter "any and every 
clandestine organization" is "still relevant and a priority." 
And there are structures "even outside the familiar ideological 
and criminal frameworks" that are aiming to "pursue, by means of 
various kinds of action (acts of aggression, intimidation, 
misinformation, and so forth) a strategy to subvert the 
institutions, undermine the democratic dialectic, and in any 
case influence the process of the country's growth and 
evolution." In particular, the report states that "it is 
impossible not to take account of the possibility of the 
emerging links" between organized crime and these unspecified 
subversive organizations. 
  On the "external" front, attention is being focused on the 
former Yugoslavia: A number of nuclear reactors are very much 
at risk, "having been identified by the warring factions as 
potential targets for terrorist attacks." The government's 
report to parliament stresses that organized crime in Italy "has 
become all the more dangerous inasmuch as it has shown itself 
capable of exploiting for its own ends even situations outside 
the national context, such as those of the eastern European 
countries, where conditions have made it relatively easy to 
acquire explosives and logistical support." 
  In Italy the strategy of terror can be traced through the 
attacks in Rome and Milan, and apart from the car bombs "there 
has been a series of mysterious events, some characterized by 
explicit violence, whose common denominator -- leaving aside the 
evidence currently being examined -- has proved to be a strategy 
designed to undermine the credibility of the state and its 
resilience. These events have caused disorientation and perhaps 
alarm, which have sometimes resulted in negative repercussions 
on the country's international image": attacks and poisonings, 
bloodshed and suspicion, gunmen and palace conspiracies. With 
regard to the danger of links between subversive phenomena and 
large-scale crime, the report talks in terms of "a web of 
mysterious vested interests." 
  A key role in this web is assigned to the Mafia. The Mafia 
has resolutely opted for the terrorist path, and since the 
Capaci and via D'Amelio atrocities the strategy has acquired a 
"destabilizing character." The government report states that 
within the Mafia "the conceptual and organizational center could 
prove to be separate from the operational nucleus and composed 
of elements of differing extractions." In other words, we are 
back to the web, the interconnections, the collusion between 
various different criminal organizations for subversive ends. 
  As for the activities of the far left, the report mentions 
"a 
special commitment to the use of on-line resources, together 
with other groups abroad, as part of a broad plan designed to 
identify common objectives." The subversive right "still retains 
its familiar extremely dangerous character, by virtue of the 
frequently stated possibility of its reestablishing itself at 
the clandestine level." 
  However, the report states, a renewal is under way within 
Sisde, entailing a "considerable reduction of personnel," as 
envisaged by the reform. Ciampi wishes to leave the Chigi 
Palace [prime minister's residence] having "cleaned up" the 
secret services, since "the government's task and my own 
personal task have come to an end." The prime minister will not 
be running for reelection. He also denied another rumor, that of 
the assignment of an official role to Fininvest: "Nobody in the 
government has ever considered such a step or has ever suggested 
it. Ask the newspapers how they acquired such information."

  [Text] Milan, Italy, Feb 2 (AFP) -- The Italian Communist 
Party (PCI) received a bribe of one billion lire ($600,000) in 
connection with Enimont, the former president of 
Ferruzzi-Montedison, Carlo Sama, told a court here on Wednesday 
[2 February]. 
  Sama had said on December 21 that the PCI had received funds 
from the company in return for allowing Enimont to be attributed 
tax advantages. 
  The PCI has since broken up into the Refounded Communist 
Party and the Democratic Party of the Left. 
  Ferruzzi, a private group and Eni, the state energy holding 
company, set up a joint venture called Enimont. This fell apart 
and revealed a huge scandal of political corruption in which 150 
billion lire was siphoned into the coffers of political parties 
and the pockets of people elected to positions of authority. 
  Sama has been charged with corruption in connection with 
this 
but was appearing on Wednesday as a witness in a case against a 
key figure, Sergio Cusani. Sama, in his earlier statement, had 
not put a figure on the amount of the bribe paid to the 
communists. 
  The court hearings have progressively revealed that all of 
the parties, led by the Christian Democratic Party and the 
Socialist Party, received big illicit commissions in connection 
with the Enimont deal to finance legislative elections in April 
1992. 
  Sama was forced to leave the company as a result of the 
discovery of a hole in the accounts which threatened to lead to 
bankruptcy. He told magistrates that in 1993 he learnt that the 
communists had been paid. He alleged that the funds had been 
provided by Cusani and by Raul Gardini, the former president of 
Ferruzzi-Montedison, who committed suicide as the corruption 
came to light. The money was paid to someone whose identity he 
did not know, Sama said.

  [Excerpts] Germany has assured India that it will continue 
to take a neutral stance on the Kashmir issue and not make any 
value judgments. Kashmir figured prominently in the talks 
between the prime minister and the German leaders in Bonn. Mr. 
Narasimha Rao explained to them the problems faced by India 
because of Pakistan's abetment of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir 
and Punjab. [passage omitted] 
  Earlier, Mr. Narasimha Rao held talks with the German 
minister for economic cooperation and development Mr. 
Carl-Dieter Spranger, and reaffirmed India's commitment to 
closer cooperation with Germany. Mr. Rao also told German 
leaders that New Delhi is keen on enhanced trade and investment 
flow from Germany. He emphasized that the theme of the Asian 
partnership choice and strategic partnership should be made a 
reality [sentence as heard]. 
  Our correspondent S. Sudarshanam adds from Bonn that India's 
line of thinking is in tune with Germany's new Asia policy which 
seeks to widen its cooperation with the Asian countries like 
Japan, China, and India. The German minister told the prime 
minister that he would lead a 20-member delegation to India soon 
to explore further cooperation in trade, investment, and joint 
venture in technical and technological fields. The signing of 
aid protocol for this year will also come up during his visit. 
  Meanwhile, the new foreign secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, 
told 
newspersons at Bonn that the German leaders emphasized greater 
cooperation in trade, science, and technology. He said Germany 
is a major trading partner with India and two German ministers 
in charge of economic development and foreign affairs are 
planning to visit India before June this year. 
  The chairman of the German multinational corporation, Bayer, 
held talks with the prime minister and indicated that Bayer is 
to set up a pharmaceutical plant at Manali in Tamil Nadu. This 
afternoon, the prime minister will have talks with the German 
chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl, on strengthening economic and trade 
relations. Dr. Kohl will host a working lunch. Cooperation in 
scientific, technical, and cultural fields and issues of mutual 
interests are likely to figure in the talks. The prime 
minister, now on a four-day official visit, will leave for 
Berlin tomorrow.

prime minister said Pakistan is deliberately creating conditions 
for not having a meaningful dialogue. He also informed them 
about the confidence-building measures his government had taken 
in the past toward good neighborly relations with Pakistan. 
  The issue also figured prominently during the foreign 
secretary-level talks in Bonn. The Indian side told the Germans 
about the setting up of the commission to look into the 
allegations of human rights abuses and permission given to the 
Amnesty International to visit the country. Attention was also 
drawn to the threat by Pakistan to move an anti-India resolution 
at the Geneva session on human rights. New Delhi sought 
Germany's help to thwart the attempt. Bonn assured that the 
anti-Indian motion on Kashmir will not serve any useful purpose. 
Both countries also called for wider representation in the UN 
Security Council to ensure the political effectiveness of the 
collective will of international community. Both India and 
Germany are aspirants of a permanent seat in the council.

until it is able to reach an understanding with the United 
States, German officials who met with Ricardo Alarcon de 
Quesada, president of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [ANPP], stated. 
  Alarcon began today in Bonn the most important part of his 
five-day official visit to Germany at the invitation of German 
National Assembly (Bundestag) President Rita Sussmuth. Alarcon 
spent the first two days of his tour in the northern city-state 
of Bremen. Alarcon, a former foreign minister, will meet with 
top officials during his stay. Minister Bernd Schmidbauer, who 
is from the office of Prime Minister Helmut Kohl and is the man 
in charge of coordinating Germany's secret services, will be one 
of Alarcon's interlocutors. These gestures, however, do not 
represent an opening on the German side, Alarcon's interlocutors 
indicated. "To do that, we would need to see a decision to 
change from Cuba, something we are not seeing," highly placed 
sources stated in Bonn. 
  The German Government would like to help Cubans with broader 
bilateral cooperation programs, "but so far we have not seen the 
conditions necessary to do that," German authorities stated. 
"Cuban-German relations are therefore marked by a certain 
sentiment of ambiguity." 
  The ANPP president met first with Bundestag Vice President 
Hans Klein (of the co-ruling Christian Social Union), and later 
with members of the Christian Democratic Union bloc. 
  Klein told DPA about a Cuban-German "joint venture" in 
tourism. He noted, however, that "the realization of decisive 
German-Cuban bilateral cooperation projects depends 
fundamentally on the legal system and economic conditions in 
Cuba." 
  A group of Bundestag deputies in charge of relations with 
Central America and the Caribbean will host a lunch in Alarcon's 
honor at the headquarters of Bonn's Parliamentary Society. 
Earlier the Cuban official met with Deputy Gregor Gysi, chief 
of the Party of Democratic Socialism bloc, the political 
successor of the East German Communist Party. 
  Alarcon told DPA that Cuba "must make a series of changes in 
its economy but does not seek to change the basic elements of 
its political project, which is socialism." 
  On relations with the EU, Alarcon said he was convinced that 
"they are headed in the right direction at the bilateral level, 
as well as with Europe as a whole, and we hope to conclude soon 
an overall cooperation agreement with the EU." 
  For the German Government and legislature, however, the 
ideas 
of the EU Executive Committee about Cuba "do not constitute an 
opening, either." 
  Europeans are convinced that Cuba must first reach an 
agreement with the United States before the EU doors are opened. 
Meanwhile, "these will be the only gestures of support that 
Cubans will receive from us. Those gestures, however, will not 
manage to resolve the catastrophic situation that the nation is 
experiencing." 
  Tourism will not solve Cuba's problems, either. The German 
authorities are not opposed to any kind of increase in the 
number of tourists to Cuba or investments by German companies in 
hotel or vacation centers, "but capital does not flow to places 
where there is no guarantee of stability," Klein added. 
  Over 60,000 Germans went to Cuba on vacation last year. For 
Cuba, German tourists constitute the second largest group of 
visitors in the world and the first in Europe. "But all of this 
is not going to save the country," Bonn government sources 
stated. 
  Cubans are "nice, welcome, highly qualified, and seeking 
cooperation, but deep down that cannot happen so long as they 
maintain their same policy," the sources concluded.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
intends to implement the 1.25 billion [German] mark [DM] budget 
cuts adopted by the Cabinet chiefly in the areas of equipment, 
personnel, and international missions undertaken by the 
Bundeswehr. He announced the details in Bonn today before the 
Bundestag Defense Committee. 
  He said that just under DM600 million of the cuts will be 
achieved by means of immediate measures. Individual measures to 
account for the remaining sum of around DM650 million will be 
decided during the year, Ruehe said. The list of immediate 
measures comprises a total of six items. It provides, among 
other things, for a reduction in Bundeswehr strength to 345,000 
soldiers by yearend. 
  The budget allocation for international missions is to be 
cut 
by DM100 million. If the Bundeswehr is needed further in this 
area in 1994, additional funding is to be provided. Funds for 
military procurements are to be cut by DM220 million. Some 
DM165 million less are to be spent on civilian and military 
personnel. The suspension of all military exercises in the 
second half of 1994 is intended to achieve savings of a further 
DM45 million. 
  Some DM60 million are to be spent on rebuilding the 
infrastructure in the new [eastern] states. Savings of around 
DM10 million altogether are also to be made in the navy and air 
force.

<F P=106> [Report signed "HB": "Economic Upturn in West Assumes </F>
Sharper Contours"] 
  [Text] In February, the HANDESLBLATT economic barometer 
registered a further improvement, although there was some 
variation between the individual indicators making up the 
overall reading. As was the case in January, there was an 
improvement of 0.3 percent compared to the previous month. Now, 
at -0.2 percent, it is just below zero. Thus, the figure for 
February of last year, -1 percent, has been markedly exceeded. 
Since September, the barometer reading has been improving from 
month to month. The latest developments indicate that the 
economy was at its lowest point in the final quarter of 1993. 
  The upturn is also in no small way due to a shift toward a 
more positive mood in the west German economy. The Ifo 
economics institute business climate index for manufacturing 
industry has been on a course pointing to recovery for the past 
eight months. What is also important from the point of view of 
the economic climate is that business expectations for the 
coming six months have also improved once again. 
  There was a sharp rise in demand for construction industry 
services in October, and such demand rose highest in the 
non-housing construction sector. By contrast, demand for 
manufacturing, which is sensitive to price and seasonal factors, 
was slack in November. Both domestic and foreign orders were 
somewhat lower than in October. Nevertheless, demand from 
abroad is continuing on an upward trend. 
  The retail sector remained on its low October level in 
November. Thus, in real terms, sales were significantly lower 
than a year ago. This trend was to some extent offset by the gap 
between short and long-term interest rates closing to -0.51 
percent in December. However, the structure of interest rates 
was still inverse at the end of 1993. 
  So, positive and negative tendencies exist side by side in 
the current economic situation -- that is, if one concentrates 
solely on the latest data. However, in the medium term, 
positive factors prevail in the overall picture. The shift 
toward a feeling of greater optimism, which has been apparent 
for some months, has exercised a strong influence in this 
respect. Ultimately, how investors and consumers view the 
future can, above all, lead the economy out of the recession. 
  Currently, export orders appear to be providing the greatest 
anti-recessionary stimulus, but with low interest rates and 
declining inflation, the economy also seems set on a positive 
course in domestic terms. Thus, the increase in optimism in the 
economy is not only a matter of psychology but also has a very 
real basis.

<F P=106> [Report by Friedrich Kuhn: "Right-Wing Extremists Step Up </F>
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- According to the German security 
authorities, some 25 German right-wing extremists, mainly 
neo-Nazis, are fighting in Croatia and Bosnia as volunteers 
against the Serbs. This proves that there are efforts by 
right-wing extremist circles in Germany to intensify connections 
with like-minded people abroad. 
  Another example that has been mentioned are the more 
frequent 
joint appearances of the head of the German People's Union 
[DVU], Gerhard Frey, and the Russian right-wing extremist 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. In a meeting with Frey in August 1992, 
the latter declared that his party would bring its influence to 
bear "to solve the East Prussian question in Germany's favor." 
Since then German right-wing extremists have been seen to be 
supporting the settlement of Russian Germans in East Prussia. 
  According to security experts, German right-wing extremists 
met with like-minded people in Vellexon, France, Diksmuide, in 
West Flanders, Naumburg (Saxony Anhalt), and Madrid. Contacts 
with U.S. citizen Gary Rex Lauck, who smuggles Nazi propaganda 
material to Germany from Lincoln, Nebraska, are regarded as 
particularly dangerous. That way, Lauck spares the German 
right-wing extremists the risk of prison terms of several years 
for producing the material in Germany itself. Several German 
publishers of right-wing extremist material now have their 
newspapers, leaflets, and books printed abroad. 
  According to the Cologne-based Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, signs of a "networking" of 
right-wing extremist tendencies in Germany have become "more 
obvious" in the last year. The right-wing extremists are trying 
to overcome the fact that they are divided into many groups 
through "means of communication." "Organizational structures are 
being replaced increasingly by specific interlinking through 
technology," sources form the Office said. The use of 
information technology through coded information via mail boxes 
and mobile telephones enables the right-wing extremists "to 
mobilize on a federal level within a short time and to react 
flexibly in each individual case." This has also benefited 
Hamburg neo-Nazi Christian Worch, who is trying to establish a 
network under the name of "Anti-Antifa" [anti-antifascist] 
Direct control over the approximately 5,600 militant right-wing 
extremists in the entire FRG has not yet been observed. At the 
moment, 1,500 right-wing extremists are organized into 27 groups.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Right-Wing Extremists"] </F>
  [Text] More than 70 neo-Nazi and right-wing extremist 
organizations and splinter groups with a total of about 41,500 
members are haunting Germany. While so far authorities have 
assumed that the right-wing extremist scene is largely torn by 
strife, now constitutional protectors admit that they have 
underestimated the interlacement of the groups. 
  The slogan of "Marching separately, striking together," 
which 
was issued by the late neo-Nazi leader Michael Kuehnen, is 
increasingly being followed. Controlled by the supra-regional 
cadre organization "New Front Association of Like-Minded 
People," individual groups at home and abroad are coordinating 
their activities through magazines, information telephones, and 
mailbox systems. 
  The militant nature of the scene is also alarming: By the 
end of 1993 the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations had 
reported 1,814 acts of violence with right-wing extremist 
motives. Eight people were killed; in 1992 there were 17 deaths. 
<H5>  The Right-Wing Extremist Scene in Germany </H5>
  Parties: 
  The Republikaner (REP): Founded in Munich in 1983. 
[Chairman Franz] Schoenhuber tries to draw a line between the 
party and militant neo-Nazis. Many ex-Republikaner have good 
contacts with the neo-Nazi scene. About 25,000 members. 
  German League for People and Homeland (DL): Collection point 
for former members of the Republikaner and the NPD [National 
Democratic Party]. Ex-Republikaner [and DL Chairman Harald] 
Neubauer has a seat in the European Parliament and is 
establishing Europe-wide contacts. The DL has 1,000 members. 
  National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD): In terms of 
personnel it is closely linked to the neo-Nazi scene. It took 
in members of the German Alternative, cooperates with the Viking 
Youth, and has contacts with Worch (National List, New Front of 
Like-Minded People). About 5,000 members. Its chairman is 
Guenter Deckert. 
  German People's Union (DVU): With 26,000 members it is one 
of the largest right-wing extremist organizations. Publisher 
[Gerhard] Frey (DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG) cooperates with the 
Russian fascist Zhirinovskiy. It has contacts with the DL. 
  Liberal German Workers Party (FAP): The only openly national 
socialist party. Has taken in many activists of the National 
Offensive, the German Alternative, and the Nationalist Front. 
Attracts attention by marches and militant actions. About 220 
members. Its chairman is Friedhelm Busse. 
  Umbrella Organization: 
  New Front of Like-Minded People (GdNF): The GdNF considers 
itself as the cadre organization of the right-wing movement in 
Germany. Its goal is the new establishment of the NSDAP 
[National Socialist German Workers' Party, or Nazi party]. The 
GdNF coordinates nationwide actions and has contact with foreign 
right-wing extremists. All leading German neo-Nazis belong to 
it. The head of the GdNF is Christian Worch. 
  Banned Organizations: German Alternative (DA): The 
strongest militant neo-Nazi group in the new laender: 350 
members. Active in particular in Saxony and Brandenburg. 
Banned on 10 December 1992. Many of its members have joined the 
NPD. Its chairman was Frank Huebner. 
  Nationalist Front (NF): A militant organization headed by 
ex-NPD member [Meinolf] Schoenborn, it had weapons and 
ammunition. It was banned on 27 November 1992. A large number 
of its 130 activists gathered in the Central German Youth 
Promotion Project. 
  National Offensive (NO): This is a collection point for 
disillusioned FAP members in Bavaria, Saxony, and Brandenburg. 
It intended to form "autonomous structures." It was banned on 
22 December 1992; it had 150 members at the last count. Its 
chairman was Michael Swierczek. 
  Organizations: 
  National List (NL): Founded by Kuehnen followers in Hamburg 
in 1989. The NL considers itself as a "spearhead" and often 
appears as the organizer of rightist meetings. The NL has about 
30 members, and its leader is Christian Worch. 
  German Hesse (DH): It is a small but striking group. The 
leaders belong to the inner circle of the German neo-Nazi scene. 
It cultivates contacts with the Viking Youth, the FAP, and the 
banned DA. It has about 60 members. Heinz Reisz is the group's 
leader. 
  Viking Youth (WJ): The oldest right-wing extremist 
organization in Germany, it was founded in 1952. In tent camps 
young people get paramilitary training. It has contacts with 
the NPD and has about 400 members. Its leader is Wolfgang 
Nahrath. 
  Central German Youth Promotion Project (FMJ): This is 
considered to be the successor organization of the banned DA and 
NF. It is primarily active in Brandenburg. It publishes the 
agitating brochure ANGRIFF [Attack], and has 100 members. The 
founder of the FMJ is Andreas Pohl. 
  Votan's People (WV): Its leader, Arnulf Priem, was the NPD's 
landtag candidate in 1974. The military sports group WV 
developed in 1987 as a sidekick of the Germanic-racist "Asgard 
League." It has about 40 members. 
<H5>  Right-Wing Extremist International </H5>
  United States: The NSDAP/AO [National Socialist Workers' 
Party/Foreign Organization] is the most important supplier of 
material to the German neo-Nazis. It maintains good contacts 
with the GdNF. Worldwide it has 5,000 members. Its leader is 
Gary Lauck. 
  Austria: Gottfried Kuessel, the imprisoned leader of the 
Extraparliamentary Opposition Loyal to the People [VAPO] was a 
speaker at rightist rallies in Germany. 
  Russia: Vladimir Zhirinovskiy demands a German-Russian 
alliance in the "struggle for white Europe." It has good 
contacts with DVU and DL. 
  Alliances: 
  Sweden: White Aryan Resistance -- 50-100 militant members; 
  Denmark: Danish National Socialist Movement -- several 
hundred members; 
  Latvia: Movement of National Independence -- 1,600 members; 
  The Netherlands: Nederlandse Blok [Dutch Block] -- several 
hundred members; 
  Great Britain: British National Party -- 2,000 members; 
Blood and Honour -- several thousand followers all over the 
world; 
  Belgium: Vlaams Blok [Flemish Bloc] -- about 3,000 members;

<F P=106> [Klaus Wittmann report: "Plutonium Fuel Rods"] </F>
  [Text] Gundremmingen -- For the first time worldwide, 
mixed oxide (MOX) fuel elements are permitted for use in a 
boiling water reactor. After a year-long controversy over the 
authorization, this was decided by the Bavarian Health Ministry 
yesterday. In first statements, the Bavarian Greens and the 
"Alliance for Protection From MOX" talked of a "disastrous false 
decision." 
  It is an alarming world premiere and completely 
incomprehensible that Germany is the trailblazer with this 
nonsense, Deputy Raimund Kamm from the Greens said. In the 
course of the authorization proceedings, even the International 
Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna objected to the use of MOX fuel 
elements in boiling water reactors. Such reactors only have one 
cooling cycle. 
  However, Bavarian Environment Minister Peter Gauweiler 
thinks 
that the objections are unfounded. An international safety 
analysis has shown that it can be safely used, he said. More 
than 40,000 people had objected to the use of MOX and there had 
been fierce controversies in the hearing in February 1993. The 
people who made objections complained about the vexatious 
transaction of the proceedings.

Desire for Renewal in PSOE"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez 
expressed Wednesday [26 January] his satisfaction at the outcome 
of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] provincial 
congresses which have been held, since they express a "clear 
desire" for renewal and integration. 
  At a joint press conference with Finnish Prime Minister Esko 
Aho at the Moncloa Palace, the PSOE leader described as positive 
the outcome of those congresses, at which the delegates to the 
March federal summit were elected and at which the sum total of 
renewalists and integrationists defeated the Guerraists. 
<H5>  Satisfied </H5>
  "The congresses clearly express the party's majority wishes; 
this is unequivocal," and represents "a clear desire for 
renewal, integration, and cohesion," said Gonzalez, who declared 
himself "satisfied" with the results. 
  "Renewal and integration are what was put across at the 
provincial congresses," the prime minister stated, emphasizing 
that this lies "within the message which I have tried to convey 
with all due respect to the party, whose say it is right now."

<F P=106> [Julio Riquelme report: "Pujol Will Withdraw His Support </F>
From Government If It Introduces Changes After 27 January"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Generalitat [Basque autonomous 
government] premier Jordi Pujol has warned the government that 
CiU [Convergence and Union] will withdraw its parliamentary 
support if the general strike day leads Felipe Gonzalez' 
government to introduce changes into the labor reform bill 
approved in the Congress [of Deputies] last week, with overall 
amendments only from the United Left and the Canary Islands 
Coalition. 
  Jordi Pujol made no change to the schedule which he is 
following during his five-day official visit to Germany, on 
which he is accompanied by 50 Catalan businessmen in the hope of 
winning new investments in that community. In the meantime, the 
Catalan cabinet had a normal working day, with the councillors 
in their offices. 
  Pujol took the view that the strike "is not important" in 
itself, but the fact that it could lead the government to amend 
the contents of the labor reform, which has had CiU's 
parliamentary support, is important. According to Pujol, the 
coalition will not withdraw its support from the PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party] even if the strike is a massive 
success, but it will if the Socialist Party "gives in and 
decides to change policy." 
  Speaking to the same effect, Miguel Roca [Democratic 
Convergence of Catalonia Secretary General] Miquel Roca asserted 
yesterday that "the trade unions will have to reflect," since 
yesterday's strike "is not a general strike," with a 
considerable impact on industry, but has had "a very modest 
impact" on small and medium-sized industry, "virtually none" on 
trade, and "very little" on the civil service and the services 
sector. 
  In Roca's opinion, this uneven response and the much lesser 
impact than the 14 December 1988 strike are "a sign" that the 
government should "go ahead with the aims laid down in the the 
field of economic and labor policy." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Haavisto Predicts Difficult </F>
Negotiations"] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto (Center Party) has 
said that the milk and sugar quotas which the EU [European 
Union] Commission has offered Finland are a disappointment. 
According to Haavisto, the quotas are much less than what 
Finland has proposed. Minister Haavisto said on Saturday [29 
January] that Finland is now on the verge of really difficult 
negotiations. In practice only 20 working days are left for thm. 
  In Haavisto's view, the situation is very open in all 
respects, since the Commission has still not reached a decision 
on the issues which are most important to Finland -- that is, 
the support for northern regions. 
  According to the EU Commission's proposal, Finland's milk 
quota would be 2,340 million liters and sugar production would 
be limited to 146,000 tonnes. 
  The Commission's proposal means that Finland ought to cut 
its 
present milk quota by around 8 percent. The sugar quota that 
has been offered means that at least one sugar refinery will 
have to be closed, Haavisto said. In his view the cut in milk 
production is pretty hard, because Finland has been assuming 
that it might succeed in this very area. 
  Finland's current quota-linked milk production is 2,515 
million liters. In addition to this Finland has also been 
seeking an opportunity for those farms which have ceased 
producing milk to resume production in line with the system in 
force within the EU. This means that the quota target increases 
to 2,992 million liters. 
  In Haavisto's view the EU Commission has made a clear 
mistake 
in fixing the milk quota. It has failed to understand that all 
farms have not fully exploited their right of production. 
  However, Haavisto pointed out that by far the most important 
issue in the continued negotiations is support for northern 
regions. 
  "Quotas such as these are also without importance if the 
economic conditions for producing them do not exist," he said. 
  In Haavisto's view it is possible to see from the EU 
Commission's offers that the understanding that has been voiced 
at the general level for Finland's special problems is much less 
when the issues are discussed at expert level. 
  Haavisto said that we must now hope that the understanding 
that has been expressed at head of state level spreads to the 
countries' negotiators and to the Commission -- that is, that 
there will also be understanding in practice. 
  He added that he believes that the EU's machinery for 
preparing decisions has not functioned satisfactorily on this 
point. In his view there is still some goodwill in various 
quarters. However, some flexibility is needed on the 
Commission's part, he added. The Commission has prepared its 
proposal for the member countries and it is with these that 
Finland and the other applicant nations will negotiate the terms 
of membership.

<F P=106> [Article by Pellervo Alanen: "Study Commissioned by Industry </F>
Interest Group Shows: Farmers' Net Incomes Do Not Collapse in 
the EU"] 
  [Text] There has been much clamor in Finland about how farm 
incomes would collapse if Finland were to become a member of the 
European Union (EU). There has been less talk about how costs 
will decrease almost in the same proportion. The result of this 
may be that net farm incomes do not decrease very much. 
  The Central Federation of Industry and Employers (CFIE) has 
commissioned a study of how Finnish membership in the EU would 
impact farm costs in Finland. The results of the study, which 
are available now, are quite surprising. When lower incomes and 
lower costs are juxtaposed, net farm incomes will only be less 
than 100 million markkas lower than the official figures for 
1993. 
  The study has been based on agricultural gross revenue and 
cost, according to calculations prepared in February of last 
year, by the National Farm Price Advisory Committee. The 
resulting difference between these two values is called 
agricultural income. 
  Included in agricultural gross revenue are almost all 
subsidies. Excluded are some agricultural sale revenues, such as 
quality and seasonal surcharges. In addition, proceeds from 
timber sales are not included in the sales revenue figures . 
<H5>  Producer Prices Decreasing </H5>
  The sales revenues, and simultaneously the agricultural 
gross 
revenue, decrease due to the fact that the farmers in the EU 
countries receive lower prices for their products than the 
farmers in Finland. On the other hand, the difference between 
producer prices has significantly shrunk, as the markka has 
weakened. The study commissioned by the CFIE estimates the 
difference to be 25-30 percent. 
  The study has been conducted on the assumption that farm 
subsidies will remain the same, as the government has made the 
commitment in the EU negotiations to keep the support level for 
farmers from decreasing. Prohibited subsidies such as price 
supports (3.9 billion markkas and 50 million markkas in crop 
failure support) can be supplanted by other forms of support. 
The Finnish state and/or the EU will pay. 
<H5>  Lower Prices of Fertilizers </H5>
  The agricultural sector's share of surplus exports amounted 
to 1.5 billion markkas. Membership in the EC would eliminate 
this obligation. 
  Currently, when farmers buy supplies and equipment such as 
machinery, fertilizers and feed, they pay hidden sales taxes, as 
they have no right to deduct these. The amount of these hidden 
sales taxes is estimated at 1.5 billion markkas. 
  The transfer to a system of value-added taxes means that the 
above-mentioned costs will be removed from the agricultural 
sector. 
  The industry sector that manufactures farming supplies and 
equipment, operates, in part, on closed markets. According to 
the study, the prices of, among other things, fertilizers and 
animal feed on the common markets will come down. 
  Animal feed is mainly manufactured from grain, and the 
decrease in grain prices will lead to lower animal feed prices. 
  According to the study, fertilizer concentrate prices may 
decrease by 10-20 percent and the price of feed by 25-35 percent. 
<H5>  Smaller Depreciation </H5>
  In 1993, the depreciation value included in the producer 
prices amounted to 3.4 billion markkas for machinery and 
equipment and 640 million markkas for buildings. 
  It was noted in the study that, as farm sizes increase, the 
capital invested in agriculture will decrease, which leads to 
lower depreciation. The assumption made in the study is that 
depreciation will decrease by a third. 
  Lower costs will result in a corresponding decrease in 
producer prices, without any changes in agricultural income.

<F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "Karelian Critical of Finnish </F>
Passivity"] 
  [Text] The Karelian Republic's foreign minister, Valeriy 
Shlyamin, is critical of the Finns for being ineffective and for 
just marking time regarding economic cooperation in nearby 
[Karelian] areas. Shlyamin stated these critical comments before 
the Finnish and Russian friendship organization leaders meeting 
in Petrozavodsk on Friday [21 January]. According to Shlyamin, 
U.S., German, and Austrian firms are about to take over the 
market in Karelia because of Finnish firms. In his view the 
Finns have not replied to Karelian proposals, and cooperation 
has not advanced over the past 18 months. Shlyamin sees one 
reason for this in that project initiatives of Finland and the 
Area Development Fund (KERA) have been inadequate. 
  The Finnish-Russian Friendship Society's chairman, Kaj 
Barlund, and its general secretary, Merja Hannus, visited 
Petrozavodsk on Friday. Barlund and the chairman of the Friends 
of Finland Society in Karelia, Aleksey Mironov, signed a 
protocol on cooperation. Barlund met on Friday also with 
Karelian Republic President Viktor Stepanov.

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by former Foreign Minister Max Jakobson: </F>
"Finland's Flexible Neutrality"] 
  [Text] In the security policy debate, which is again 
becoming livelier as a result of the NATO top-level meeting, the 
terms neutrality and nonalignment keep cropping up, as if their 
meaning were a given and a constant under any conditions. 
Finland's experiences, however, indicate that reality is more 
multifaceted than this kind of dogmatic analysis would suggest. 
Sometimes, even the distinction between neutrality and 
nonalignment has been like a line drawn in water. 
  A good example of this is the direction taken by the Nordic 
countries, which was outlined in December of 1935. The purpose 
of this was to show that Finland was not a German satellite, but 
wanted, as did the other Nordic countries, to preserve its 
neutrality in the face of the confrontation between Germany and 
the USSR. There was also, however, a desire to use this to 
create a basis for military cooperation with Sweden in the event 
of a Soviet attack. 
  The final goal was a defense pact between Finland and 
Sweden--an alliance with the purpose of securing neutrality. 
  Negotiations with Sweden progressed so far that an agreement 
was reached about the joint defense of the Aland Islands. But 
Sweden pulled back when faced by opposition from the USSR. This 
was a fateful message to Stalin. 
  It was later explained that the Finnish attempt at 
neutrality 
failed because Stalin could not trust the sincerity of that 
striving. But Stalin had no qualms about Finland's neutrality as 
long Germany formed a counterforce to the USSR in the Baltic. 
  We still do not know what Stalin's ultimate motives were, at 
that juncture, but we know that the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement 
provided him with the chance of realizing them. The agreement 
allowed him to launch an attack on Finland without having to 
fear retribution from the Germans. The start of the Winter War 
indicated that the policy of neutrality conducted by a small 
nation can only succeed when a power balance has been achieved 
between the superpowers. 
  After the Winter War had broken out, Finland embarked upon 
an 
active search for Western allies. In February 1940, England and 
France offered Finland military support, but it was too little, 
too late. But the offer of aid still had a significant effect in 
that it made Stalin willing to drop the Kuusinen government and 
sign a peace accord with the legal government of Finland, as he 
did not want to precipitate a conflict with the West. 
  After the Winter War, Finland abided by a policy of 
neutrality, but was continuously under threat, as long as the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement was in effect. The situation 
changed in the fall of 1940, at which time Germany was willing 
to support Finland; the power balance had been restored. This 
saved our country from the fate of the Baltic states. 
  Paasikivi wrote about this situation, that Snellman's often 
quoted statement, according to which a nation should only trust 
itself, is only a half-truth: "This only applies to a large 
nation. It is not enough for a smaller one. Naturally, even a 
small nation, such as Finland, should do all it can to defend 
itself, and fight for its own survival. But when Finland is 
facing an opponent as large as the USSR, Finland's own 
resources are not enough, and we must search for help from 
abroad, in this case from Germany." 
  In 1941, Germany controlled all of the European continent 
and 
was preparing to attack the USSR. In this situation, Finland had 
no way of maintaining its neutrality. Even Sweden was forced to 
bend its policy of neutrality and permit German troops to move 
through Swedish territory. Finland was left only with two 
alternatives; either voluntarily participate in the German 
offensive or be forced to become a support area for German 
troops. 
  But Finland did not become a signatory to a specific 
alliance 
with Germany. Finland went to war next to Germany, and fought 
its own war against the USSR, only in order to achieve its own 
national goals. 
  This effort of combining the benefits of enjoying the 
support 
of a major power, with the freedom of neutrality, required some 
diplomatic acrobatics, but it succeeded in that it kept the 
United States from declaring war against Finland. 
  However, in June 1944, Finland had to commit to fight 
alongside the Germans until the end, in order to secure military 
aid to stave off the offensive by the USSR. But as the 
commitment only took the form of a personal promise by President 
Risto Ryti, it could be abrogated as soon as the attack, with 
the aid of Germany, had been thwarted. 
  In the situation following World War II, Finland was at the 
mercy of the USSR as long as the alliance formed by the victors 
stayed in effect. However, the favorable view taken by the West 
toward Finland had a dampening effect on the USSR. Stalin 
admitted to this later, during discussions with Tito. Finland 
was not occupied because he did not want to irritate the United 
States. 
  Finland's position became stronger and stronger as the 
relationship between East and West became more and more 
strained, and the West started to demand a counterforce against 
the military power of the USSR. Because of this, Finland was 
able to reach satisfactory terms in the Treaty of Friendship, 
Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance (FCA). But it was not until 
the return of the Porkkala Military Base--as a result of the 
superpowers' power balance turning in favor of the West--that 
Finland was given the opportunity to seek international approval 
for its policy of neutrality. 
  Combining the FCA Treaty with a policy of neutrality again 
required exhibits of diplomatic acrobatics. The credibility of 
such policies was tested from both the East and the West, 
depending on from what direction the political winds were 
blowing at any given time. But overall, during the Cold War, 
Finland was able, together with Sweden and Austria, to utilize 
the situation created by the power balance between East and 
West, to stabilize its own position. 
  History is not a cookbook from which one can glean complete 
recipes for solving today's problems. Paasikivi often quoted the 
Swiss historian, Jakob Burkhardt, by noting that we cannot learn 
from history for the next time--as next time will never come. 
But history can help us become wiser. 
  We can also become wiser by studying the history of Finnish 
security policy. It shows that Finland, during the course of 
many decades, has survived wars and crises because it has shown 
a willingness to try different policies in ever changing 
situations--sometimes neutrality, sometimes nonalliance, and 
sometimes a combination of the two--to ensure its security. We 
must be just as willing today to consider all available options.

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Elisabeth Rehn by </F>
Arto Astikainen; place and date not given: "Rehn Would Be Open 
in Relations With Russia"] 
  [Text] Swedish People's Party presidential candidate 
Elisabeth Rehn believes that she as president would bring more 
openness into Finnish foreign policy and would give political 
decisionmakers more information on what was happening. Rehn says 
that such openness would also apply to relations with Russia, so 
that it will not interfere in internal Finnish affairs. "I would 
build very well-operating ties with Russia." 
  Labeled an extreme right-wing conservative, Rehn sees 
herself 
as adjusting well to liberal debate, "although sometimes I can 
be rather extremist." 
  [Astikainen] In the first round you did poorly in Paltamo. 
Also, how could a middle-aged Paltamo farmer find reason to vote 
in the second round for Swedish People's Party's Elisabeth Rehn? 
  [Rehn] He is now going to have to ponder whether he is in 
more agreement with the things I think about and that I am 
enthusiastic about than those issues Ahtisaari represents. He 
has to make his choice on this. It's not just a matter of 
feeling enthusiastic about supporting me, but rather it is 
necessary to look at the alternative and see who is most 
suitable. 
  [Astikainen] Where is Martti Ahtisaari better than you? 
  [Rehn] He has strong experience as a Foreign Ministry and 
international organization official, also with UN administration 
experience. Of course I have none at all in these. 
  [Astikainen] Within the Swedish People's Party you are 
considered belonging to the moderate conservative wing. How does 
this differ from the party's centrist wing? 
  [Rehn] My conservatism is [to be understood as supporting] 
business, privatization, the right of individual ownership and 
generally of ownership, strong patriotism, and national defense. 
These things made up my conservativeness when I came into 
parliament. But already at that time I was a strong upholder of 
human rights and cared about helping those less well off; I had 
a global perspective and realized that not everyone was doing 
equally well. For this reason I fit well as a centrist, even 
somewhat as a liberal, although I can sometimes even be a 
conservative. 
  [Astikainen] You got into parliament in 1979 under the 
slogan 
"Woman from the right." Will this also be enough to get elected 
this time? 
  [Rehn] No, because this does not encompass more than a small 
part of me. 
  [Astikainen] Is Mauno Koivisto a dangerous socialist? 
  [Rehn] In no way. I think rather highly of Koivisto. He has 
been a wonderfully good cooperating partner with me. There are 
many such qualities in him that I hold in the highest respect. 
But since this is such a clearly nonsocialist country, it would 
be a little strange if again an individual clearly aligned with 
a leftist party were elected president. 
  [Astikainen] Is Ahtisaari a socialist? 
  [Rehn] He himself is strongly advocating this [socialism]. 
  [Astikainen] What is your thinking on the welfare state? 
  [Rehn] It is the sort of thing where there are good 
features, 
in which room is be made for inventiveness and flexibility, not 
to take care of as many people as the typical leftist society is 
doing. Welfare is connected with seeing that basic rights are 
preserved: education, basic economic security, and targeted 
health care services. But many creeper vines have grown out over 
the years. We ought to use this awareness right away and look at 
what is dispensable and how it can be pruned. I don't want to 
make cuts on the level of service delivery, [for example] by 
nurses and day care personnel. 
  [Astikainen] Is foreign policy now being decided too much by 
ministry officials? 
  [Rehn] They have been deciding rather much. I believe that 
this is going to change. At least I can assure that in my 
presidency, policy decisions will be of chief importance. The 
preparation given by ministry officials is vital, and there are 
excellent foreign and security policy experts handling both 
these areas. 
  [Astikainen] Then the situation will change if you are 
elected? 
  [Rehn] I have said that in policy aspects there is certainly 
going to be noticeably more information, openness. Currently the 
situation is a little like information should not be given out 
regarding what has happened and is happening. 
  [Astikainen] Were you afraid when you heard about Russia 
having handed a [protest] note to Finland? 
  [Rehn] In reality I became irritated that the government had 
not been particularly aware that these discussions had been 
going on. The note emerged at a little inconvenient time. There 
are those who still have not come to understand that the old 
days are gone. These people are still found in Russia's embassy 
in Finland. 
  [Astikainen] Could you as president revoke the Paris Peace 
Treaty completely? 
  [Rehn] This is not necessary, since it has become obsolete 
on 
its own. Aspects regarding border questions are still relevant. 
New agreements--all human rights agreements, UN special 
treaties--are replacing it. Forty-seven years have passed since 
the peace treaty. Conditions have changed much. All the world 
has changed. The treaty's significance is extremely limited. 
  [Astikainen] How as president would you prevent Russia from 
interfering in Finnish internal affairs? 
  [Rehn] Through openness. I would make it clear what 
Finland's 
position is regarding its own sovereignty. I would build good, 
very good operating relations with Russia. These must be built 
anew, no matter what happens there. This will be the task of the 
next president in any case. 
<H5>  Russian Uncertainty Is Danger Factor </H5>
  [Astikainen] The Estonians fear Russia. Has the threat 
regarding Finland been eliminated for all time? 
  [Rehn] Not surely for all time. We have learned over the 
past 
years that nothing is eternal, nor especially durable. Perhaps 
we have reason to manifest a little fear regarding what is 
happening with the Baltics. Their fear also might be a little 
anticipatory. Uncertainty regarding the eastern neighbor is a 
danger factor for us too, but I would prefer not to speak of 
there being a threat. 
  [Astikainen] What is your vision: What will Russia be like 
at 
the end of your presidential term in the year 2000? 
  [Rehn] Surely it will be democratized, but it is a long 
road. 
The biggest error they have made was perhaps in assuming that 
everything would just convert to a market economy with just a 
ping and there it is. They have such an old glue of tradition as 
to how things are done there. One doesn't need do more than go 
shopping in Moscow or Leningrad: First you go and select 
something, then you go to the cashier to pay and finally you are 
able to ask for your item. This will go on until all of this 
strange bureaucracy is gotten rid of. But they have embarked on 
the right direction. 
  [Astikainen] Is the border between Finland and Russia then 
just as easy to cross as is now the border between Finland and 
Sweden? 
  [Rehn] I doubt this is the case. 
  [Astikainen] Do you really want to grant asylum in Finland 
to 
all applicants from Russia and Estonia? 
  [Rehn] No. From where did you get this idea? 
  [Astikainen] You have opposed the government's decision to 
declare those countries as so-called safe countries. 
  [Rehn] First of all, it should be kept in mind the 
dimensions 
of which we are speaking. Last year some 700 people from Russia 
and Estonia asked for asylum. Since over the same period well 
over a million people came on passports and visas, then in my 
view we are just not speaking in the same in unison rearding 
these phenomena. We ought to be much more strict and careful in 
deciding to whom we justly grant visas. Those asylum applicants 
who have committed crimes can be turned away very fast, if the 
police will only act. I do not support criminals in any way. And 
the government's decision was drafted in such terms that Russia 
is to be considered a safe country for only Russian citizens, 
that is, just as I had hoped. Of course in Russia are small 
groups--draft evaders, homosexuals, Jews--who still are 
persecuted, but perhaps this will be after all brought under 
control. 
  [Astikainen] Why don't you use the word neutrality in 
describing Finland's foreign policy? 
  [Rehn] Because in my opinion this is not relevant. We have 
sought membership in the European Union [EU] and said that we 
support supplemental provisions regarding a joint foreign and 
security policy. We have not presented any reservations on this. 
And I think in general that the word neutrality is slightly 
obsolete after disappearance of the blocs. 
<H5>  Partnership for Peace Won't Increase Finnish Security </H5>
  [Astikainen] How can Finland keep talking about joining a 
Western military alliance although even you speak of 
nonalignment? 
  [Rehn] We can't add [to our security]. For example, in the 
PFP (Partnership for Peace) we were participating only in a 
contributory member. We aren't getting anything; we aren't 
getting security guarantees; we aren't even asking for these. We 
regard the work of bringing about peace in Europe as being this 
important. Finland is working to realize the possibilities for 
this. 
  [Astikainen] First there was NATO's joint consultative body 
NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], and now there is 
Partnership for Peace. Surely cooperation is being increased. 
  [Rehn] In NACC we are observers and attend committees that 
are specifically involved in peace-maintaining issues. 
  [Astikainen] How will a signing a Partnership for Peace 
agreement increase Finnish security? 
  [Rehn] It will not increase it. We are to act as a 
contributory member if we join. 
  [Astikainen] You are quite actively bringing Finland closer 
to the West. Is this based on logic or feelings? 
  [Rehn] It is clearly based on logic that we have always been 
part of Europe. I have always considered Finland a Western 
country. When I was able to go abroad for the first time in 1953 
as a new student, I was horrified that Finland was considered an 
East bloc country. An American university woman student I met in 
Venice surprised me by saying: "Are you Finnish? I didn't know 
that you were allowed to travel freely." Then I thought: "My 
God!, I'll show you that Finland is still a Western country." Of 
course one's feelings can also be involved about this. 
  [Astikainen] What would staying out of the European Union 
mean for Finland in your estimation? 
  [Rehn] Concretely, I think that we would not be able to have 
a voice in decisionmaking regarding issues of concern to 
ourselves. Especially, if there is an expansion in the area of 
security policy decisionmaking, it would be extremely vital to 
be participate, because at issue is security for all of our 
Europe. Regarding economics, investors surely will avoid 
countries that are outside. In addition, there are educational 
programs in which we cannot join as just a member of the 
European Economic Area.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Unto Hamalainen: "Unabashed Candidate of the </F>
West"] 
  [Text] "The uppermost impression from the interview with 
Elisabeth Rehn is that she is the first Finnish presidential 
candidate who unabashedly manifests a Western orientation. There 
is nothing strange in itself regarding this. Finland has indeed 
always been a Western country, but we have been influenced by 
our legacy from the Cold War. We have been constrained by this," 
explained [former Foreign Minister] Max Jacobson. 
  In his view, Rehn is right in her understanding of the 
provisions in the Paris Peace Treaty in that more than just its 
military aspect has become obsolete: Finland from the very 
beginning never accepted limitations contained in the treaty. 
They do not conform to conditions of a democratic country. 
  In foreign policy, Rehn tightly follows the official line. 
She has been a supporter of the European Union, and according to 
Jakobson, it is natural for Rehn to say that she will be able to 
influence [the conditions] of membership also before the 
referendum.

<F P=106> ["Text" of an "exclusive" interview with Cypriot President </F>
Glavkos Kliridhis by NOKTA correspondent Sevgul Uludag in 
Nicosia; date not given--punctuation as published] 
  [Text] [Uludag] First, the confidence-building measures. 
The newspapers report that the Greek Cypriot side has agreed in 
principle to discuss them. 
  [Kliridhis] We have agreed to discuss the three documents 
drawn up by the UN secretary general. They relate to the 
fenced-off area of Maras [Varosha], Nicosia Airport, and the 
confidence-building measures in general. We have agreed that 
the issue of the return of the residents of Maras to their 
property be placed under UN jurisdiction, the UN be responsible 
for running Maras, and the UN police control the area. We have 
also agreed that Nicosia Airport be operated by UN officials and 
used by the two communities. 
  [Uludag] Do you mean to say you have agreed to have two 
terminal buildings? 
  [Kliridhis] Yes, exactly. We have agreed to the UN secretary 
general's proposal. But the Turkish Cypriot side has not agreed 
to place the fenced-off area of Maras under UN jurisdiction. 
The Turkish Cypriot officials have said they want to retain the 
area near Demokratia Avenue and that they are not interested in 
Nicosia Airport. They asked that we recognize Ercan Airport and 
the ports of Kyrenia and Famagusta. We responded by saying we 
cannot do that because it would imply the recognition of a 
Turkish Cypriot state, which we do not recognize. The UN 
secretary general revealed at the beginning that issues relating 
to the confidence-building measures should include nothing that 
would imply the Greek Cypriot side's recognition of the Turkish 
Cypriot administration or the Turkish Cypriot side's recognition 
of the Cypriot Government.... 
  Rauf Denktas has informed diplomats that the embargo must be 
lifted. He has equated that with the Greek Cypriot side's 
recognition of the ports of Kyrenia and Famagusta and Ercan 
Airport. I can't predict what he may do after he holds talks 
with Prime Minister Ciller in Turkey in February. I can't say 
whether Prime Minister Ciller will change Denktas' mind or 
whether he will insist on his stance. 
  [Uludag] Elections have been held in north Cyprus and a 
coalition government has been established. Can you outline your 
views on that coalition? Do you believe the Turkish Cypriot 
side may change its policy on Cyprus? 
  [Kliridhis] I have read the coalition protocol very 
carefully. Considering Denktas' policy on Cyprus, I have seen 
nothing different in that protocol. Ozker Ozgur and Denktas 
have approached each other. In practice, Ozgur has made more 
approaches to Denktas than Denktas to him. Considering Ozgur's 
views before the coalition's establishment, Denktas' approach is 
to the fore. 
  [Uludag] Can you comment on Prime Minister Ciller's policy 
on 
Cyprus? 
  [Kliridhis] Prime Minister Ciller has informed President 
Clinton and Prime Minister Major that she is convinced that the 
time to solve the Cyprus problem has come and that Turkey will 
try to contribute toward a settlement. But that gives no hint 
of the nature of the solution to be found. We will wait until 
next month to see what Prime Minister Ciller has in mind for a 
solution. 
  [Uludag] Do you mean you have seen no change? 
  [Kliridhis] I have not. Prime Minister Ciller has only said 
that "Turkey will try to find a solution." We have nothing to 
indicate the kind of solution to be found. 
  [Uludag] Several Greek Cypriot politicians defend the view 
that agreeing to the confidence-building measures will be 
tantamount to recognizing a Turkish Cypriot state. Do you 
believe the package of confidence-building measures implies 
recognition? 
  [Kliridhis] I have already mentioned that the UN secretary 
general said that nothing will be done to imply any recognition 
when the measures are effected. Indirect recognition will 
depend on what we agree on. Let me give you an example. The 
Turkish Cypriot side may agree to UN officials running Nicosia 
Airport but we will reject a proposal that UN officials should 
accept Turkish Cypriot passports. Because doing so will mean 
the recognition of the Turkish Cypriot state. 
  [Uludag] So how will the Turkish Cypriots travel? 
  [Kliridhis] Just as they do now, with Turkish passports. 
  [Uludag] Do you mean you will agree to UN officials 
processing Turkish passports? 
  [Kliridhis] Turkey is recognized. I will not accept 
passports issued by Turkish Cypriot officials, because that 
would mean the recognition of a Turkish Cypriot state. I will 
be careful and I am convinced that Denktas will be just as 
careful. 
  [Uludag] You have known Denktas long. Do you believe you 
can reach an agreement with him? 
  [Kliridhis] I met Denktas when I became a lawyer in 1950. I 
believe we understand each other very well. Unfortunately, I 
also believe that if he were to choose between the post of vice 
president of the Cypriot Republic and president of a Turkish 
Cypriot state, he would prefer to be president of a Turkish 
Cypriot state in north Cyprus. He is used to being the top 
official. But what he wants is not the issue. If Turkey says: 
"Yes, we will solve the Cyprus problem," Denktas can't obstruct 
the process alone. He can cause delays.... 
  [Uludag] The general view is that Turkey cannot solve the 
Cyprus problem without Denktas. 
  [Kliridhis] I do not believe that is true. 
  [Uludag] That is the general viewpoint. He must sign the 
agreement to be reached.... 
  [Kliridhis] I believe Turkey can convince Denktas to be 
reasonable, that is, if it wants to do so. 
  [Uludag] I wanted to stress that Turkey cannot completely 
ignore Denktas and move to sign an agreement. 
  [Kliridhis] I do not believe that is necessary. It would be 
wrong to leave him out. 
  [Uludag] The Greek Cypriot side has allocated a large amount 
from its new budget for arms purchases. And you have decided 
you need to be under Greece's defense umbrella. Many 
politicians believe you are playing with fire. Is that right? 
  [Kliridhis] No, it is not. 
  [Uludag] Why do you need to be under Greece's defense 
umbrella and why do you want to strengthen Greece's influence? 
  [Kliridhis] I don't want to strengthen Greece's influence. I 
want to reduce Turkey's influence to the minimum. Turkey has an 
army in Cyprus, a very strong army of 36,000 men. 
  [Uludag] Do you believe the Turkish troops will attack the 
Greek Cypriot side? 
  [Kliridhis] I have not said they will attack me or the Greek 
Cypriot side. But I believe their presence is aimed at forcing 
me to agree to a solution that favors Turkey and the Turkish 
Cypriot side. If I don't agree, then the Turkish military 
forces will remain in Cyprus. I say: If you want to play the 
game like that, then I can play the same, by increasing Greece's 
influence. Later, I will say: Right, get out, both of you! 
  I have sent a letter to the UN secretary general informing 
him that I am prepared to disband the Greek Cypriot National 
Guard and hand over all its arms to UN officials. The police 
force can remain as it is and we are prepared to undertake the 
expenses of a UN peacekeeping force, which will be composed of 
units from various countries. I am prepared to transfer the 
cash we will have from all that to a UN account, which will be 
used to serve the two communities when the Cyprus problem is 
solved. I am prepared to transfer the Greek Cypriot armored 
vehicles to UN officials. They can be used by UN troops to 
control the buffer zone against any kind of aggression. 
Naturally, everything will be subject to the condition that the 
opposite side complies in the same way. Let us have no armies 
on the two sides. Let us have a strong peacekeeping force in 
the buffer zone and move to hold talks. 
  [Uludag] We have the 1977 and 1979 summit agreements. Are 
you willing to conclude a nonaggression pact with Denktas? Are 
you willing to sign an agreement with him to reduce the arms and 
troops in Cyprus? 
  [Kliridhis] I do not object to the two sides giving separate 
guarantees to the UN secretary general that they will not attack 
each other. But if we are not to attack, it will be meaningless 
to maintain the presence of the military forces. I must 
strengthen my defenses anytime a Turkish soldier arrives in 
Cyprus. And more Turkish troops are deployed in Cyprus as I 
strengthen my defenses. Consequently, we have a vicious circle. 
I need no army. I can give up my arms. The Turkish Cypriot 
side needs no army either. We need a peacekeeping force. Let 
us conclude an agreement with the United Nations and guarantee 
that neither side will attack or enter the buffer zone. Let us 
then hold talks like normal people do. 
  [Uludag] How do you assess the Turkish Cypriot community? 
Do you see it as an equal political partner or as a minority in 
a federation? 
  [Kliridhis] The wings of a federation have equal rights, 
whether the federation is made up of two or more parts. Let us 
consider the federal systems in India or the United States. 
Many of their states (provinces) have populations of several 
million people. Many others are smaller. But all have equal 
constitutional rights. Indeed, there are constitutions that call 
for equal senate representation, regardless of the population 
structure ... So, the Greek Cypriot side agreed during the 
Makarios era and later when Spiros Kiprianou was in power that 
the two federal states would be represented on a 50-50 basis in 
the upper house. Had we not agreed to equality, we would have 
said: As for the population ratio, the Greek Cypriots make up 
82 percent and the Turkish Cypriots 18-20 percent. The issue of 
representation should be based on that ratio. 
  But we have agreed to equal representation. 
  [Uludag] Can you explain the kind of federation you have in 
mind? 
  [Kliridhis] I believe the Cyprus problem should be solved as 
follows: The two communities that will establish the federation 
must have the right to the highest degree of self-government. 
Only that which is necessary should be transferred to the 
federal government. The federal government must have 
jurisdiction over issues relating to unitary sovereignty, 
unitary international identity, foreign policy, and defense. 
The federal states and governments will be responsible for all 
issues relating to internal administration. The issue of having 
unitary federal citizenship is important. Arrangements against 
criminal activity are important. So, having arrangements to deal 
with federal offenses, as is the case in the United States, is 
important. The taxes of the federal government and those of the 
two states establishing the federation must be clearly defined. 
A control mechanism must be established. A supreme federal 
court must be empowered to ensure that the two sides comply with 
human rights. That must be a federal procedure. Naturally, 
state courts will also be established. But the final decision 
must be made by the federal courts. We must also consider 
particular issues relating to health. The two sides must have 
common laws or rules, for example, against importing 
contaminated foodstuffs. The two sides must agree to issues 
that guarantee the people's health. All that must be clearly 
outlined in a constitution. 
  [Uludag] Do you expect a solution in 1994? 
  [Kliridhis] Where is my crystal ball? I can't say I see a 
speck of light at the end of the tunnel.... True, Turkey has 
promised to contribute toward a solution and use its influence 
on the Turkish Cypriot community. But no sign of what it thinks 
about the solution itself exists. It is premature to decide on 
that issue. I must be very cautious about saying I have 
observed particular developments that may lead to a solution. 
The issue can be better assessed after we see the Turkish 
Cypriot side's reaction to the confidence-building measures in 
February and March....

<F P=106> [From "On the Offensive" column: "Handling Predominates"] </F>
  [Text] While foreign quarters are moving in an active and 
coordinated manner to achieve Kliridhis-Denktas talks in 
mid-February, developments continue to confirm the assessments 
of AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People]. 
  Specifically, following the assessment of UN official 
Gustave 
Feissel, who does not believe that the Denktas letter includes 
conditions, U.S. State Department Special Coordinator on the 
Cyprus Issue Robert Lamb has judged the Denktas letter as 
acceptable. The foreigners do not attach so much importance to 
the "titles" of Denktas and the letterheads and the principles 
or thoughts that he expresses, but are concentrating on the 
substance: that he agrees to discuss the three UN documents, 
and in the end that is what counts. 
  We do not think that under the circumstances the Greek 
Cypriot side will have the ease to say "no" to a call by the UN 
secretary general for talks. For this reason, we repeat that 
the political leaders should meet and make collective decisions 
on the handling [of the Cyprus issue].

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said today that the 
Greek Cypriot side insists on a discussion of the substance of 
the Cyprus issue. Kliridhis made the above statement during a 
news conference with 13 Turkish Cypriot journalists at the 
presidential palace. The president expressed the view that the 
UN secretary general does not intend to submit a second package 
of confidence-building measures. He also said that he expects 
that in his letter to the two sides the secretary general will 
say that immediately following the confidence-building measures 
there must be talks on the substance of the Cyprus issue. 
  Replying to a question on whether there will be a new 
package 
of confidence-building measures for Morphou following the 
implementation of the proposed measures, President Kliridhis 
said that after the agreement on the measures, there will be a 
discussion on the substance of the Cyprus issue. President 
Kliridhis said that, according to the Butrus-Ghali map, Morphou 
must be on the Greek side. He added that this is an issue that 
must be discussed in the substance of the Cyprus issue because 
the territorial aspect will not be solved through the 
confidence-building measures. 
  Replying to a Turkish Cypriot correspondent's question, 
President Kliridhis rejected the claim of AKEL [Restorative 
Party of the Working People] General Secretary Dhimitrios 
Khristofias that he is bluffing on the confidence-building 
measures. Kliridhis said that the policy of bluffing does not 
lead anywhere. 
  Asked whether he believes that the Cyprus problem can be 
resolved during his term in office, President Kliridhis said 
that if Ankara and [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas have 
decided that it is the time for a solution to the Cyprus issue, 
they have the right man to negotiate with. Kliridhis said that 
he does not meet officially with Denktas, as the Turkish Cypriot 
leader insists continuously, because the UN secretary general 
has not proposed such a meeting. In order to have a meeting with 
Denktas, he said, certain topics on the confidence-building 
measures must be arranged first. He added that he does not 
refuse to have social meetings with the Turkish Cypriot leader. 
  Following their meeting with President Kliridhis, the 
Turkish 
Cypriot journalists visited the Um Haram mosque in Larnaca. 
Earlier they visited Omeriye mosque, which is in the old part 
of Nicosia.

  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe arrived in 
Athens last night and was welcomed by Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias. In their brief statements, the two ministers stressed 
the excellent cooperation relations existing between Greece and 
France. Mr. Juppe described as especially excellent the 
activities of the [European Union's] Greek presidency, 
especially on issues concerning the European Union. Mr. 
Papoulias said that they will discuss both bilateral and 
regional issues as well as the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] A bomb exploded at 0138 today at the German Goethe 
Institute on 14 Omiros Street in Athens. Approximately one half 
hour earlier an unidentified person who said he represented ELA 
[Revolutionary People's Struggle] telephoned ELEVTHEROTIPIA 
newspaper and warned about the explosion. The police cordoned 
off the area to prevent casualties. However, the men of the 
antiterrorism squad did not manage to enter the building before 
0420 today because there was nobody in charge to open it. The 
bomb was planted in the ladies room on the first basement level 
where it caused considerable material damage.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alkis Malidhis] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias described his 
talks with high-ranking U.S. officials in the framework of the 
dialogue between the European Union [EU] and United States as 
positive. Papoulias returned today to Athens and detailed the 
U.S. Government's position regarding the Skopje issue. 
  [Begin Papoulias recording] The United States is more 
interested in the normalization of relations between Greece and 
Skopje than in upgrading diplomatic relations between itself and 
Skopje. I think that we should move in this direction. 
Therefore, the normalization of Greek-Skopjean relations will 
depend on the acceptance of the conditions we set by [Macedonian 
President] Kiro Gligorov so that we can proceed with a dialogue 
on the name issue. The Greek position on the issue is known. In 
the meantime, we should try to create a better climate in the 
relations between the two countries. [end recording] 
  Papoulias also referred to yesterday's statement by UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in New York that the UN 
hopes for a meeting between Greek and Skopjean experts. 
  [Begin Papoulias recording] I have no information on what 
Butrus-Ghali said. [end recording] 
  Regarding his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, the Greek foreign minister also said that the U.S. 
Government holds positions on the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
that will be developed in the coming weeks. He added that both 
the EU and the United States insist on the promotion of a peace 
plan and reject military interventions. 
  [In the same newscast, Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia Radio 
Network carries the following dispatch by correspondent Nikolaos 
Meletis on Foreign Minister Papoulias' remarks before his 
departure from Washington: "During a friendly talk with Greek 
correspondents, Foreign Minister Papoulias also said that 
Gligorov appears tough, encouraged by diplomatic recognitions, 
and seeks to gain something more. Papoulias said that Gligorov 
does not realize that the most important thing is to establish 
good relations with Greece, which is the only regional country 
that guarantees the borders and future of his country." 
  [In a recorded statement Papoulias commented "I do not 
understand why he does not proceed with something which, as they 
say, he had agreed to during talks with Former Greek Prime 
Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis. 
  ["The foreign minister stressed that negotiations on the 
name 
will be difficult, as our country insists on the historically 
justified position not to accept a name that contains the term 
Macedonia or its derivatives. 
  ["Referring to the Cyprus issue, Foreign Minister Papoulias 
stressed that the confidence-building measures do not touch the 
substance of the issue. He also expressed his concern over the 
possibility that Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf Denktas will use 
the confidence-building measures to prolong a fruitless dialogue. 
  ["Commenting on the U.S. State Department's human rights 
report, the foreign minister stressed that this report does not 
have anything to add or take away and that it is repetition. 
The report contains information that the Americans have, and 
one can agree or disagree with them, the minister said. 
Papoulias concluded by expressing concern about the credibility 
of the sources used to formulate the report."]

<F P=106> [Report by Sinan Onus] </F>
  [Text] During the National Security Council meeting the 
previous day President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller were given a report on Armenia prepared over the last 
year by MIT [National Intelligence Organization] and the 
intelligence department of the Security Directorate. There were 
indications that the "top secret" report produced documentary 
evidence of Armenia-PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] ties. 
  Noting that Armenia directly supports the PKK, the report 
showed that PKK militants are being trained in 13 Armenian 
villages. Stating that members of the Kurdish minority in 
Armenia are being encouraged and given money to join the PKK, 
the report claimed that the Armenians are also acting as 
mediators with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to secure arms and 
ammunition for the PKK. 
  The report claimed that in improving PKK's ties with 
Armenia, 
ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] laid 
the groundwork for the establishment of PKK bases in that 
country. 
  Explaining that Armenia's aim in helping the PKK is to 
oppress the Kurdish people living in eastern Anatolia, the 
report said: "In the long-term, this country aims to isolate the 
PKK and, using the popular base in the region, to realize the 
illusion of a greater Armenia." 
<H5>  CIA's Report </H5>
  Yesterday SABAH reported CIA chief James Woolsey's report to 
the Senate Intelligence Committee. His report cited the 
following crisis points in the world: the Balkans, Russia, the 
Caucasus, and Iran. The newspaper report indicated that the 
United States was concerned about these regions.

<F P=106> [Article by Nedret Ersanel: "PKK's Chemical Arms Depots"] </F>
  [Text] The latest reports on the late-night newscast on 
television on 21 January informed the people of the Workers 
Party of Kurdistan [PKK] attack on Akyurek and Ormancik in 
Mardin Province. The way the PKK attack was carried out 
indicated a new tactic on the part of that organization. The 
PKK guerrillas forced the women and children into a house and 
killed them with hand grenades in Ormancik. What was left 
behind was a few tearful people, who escaped from the attack by 
coincidence, and a strange odor that could be detected 
regardless of the sharp smell of smoke in the burning village. 
  The enigma of the strange odor was resolved when State of 
Emergency Governor Unal Erkan and several experts arrived in 
that village. The fact that several people suffocated to death 
as a result of the smoke in the burning village raised 
significant anxiety. The truth was that the PKK used chemical 
weapons. The preliminary reports on the attack mentioned that 
chemical weapons may have been used. The final decision was to 
be made in light of the autopsy reports. However, the main 
question was the source of the PKK's chemical arms. 
  Ascertaining that source was not difficult. The matter was 
clarified through the study of the "geographical anatomy" 
[cografi anatomi] of chemical arms. 
  An authority vacuum has existed in northern Iraq for a long 
time. That is an indisputable fact. That region is controlled 
by the Hammer Force. Another indisputable fact is the existence 
of large quantities of various types of arms in northern Iraq. 
Many of the basic foodstuffs are sold at exorbitant prices in 
that region. However, arms are very cheap to buy, so much so 
that a dozen hand grenades may cost as much as $9 or $10. Even 
the chemical grenades, the type that the PKK used in its attack 
on Ormancik, are sold at low prices. Dumping also exists in the 
chemical arms market in northern Iraq. For example, the local 
cost of a chemical weapon, which can affect any living creature 
in an area of three square kilometers, is about 200,000 
dinars--that is, nearly 70,000,000 Turkish lira. 
  Four types of "gas-based" chemical arms, which are sold over 
the counter, are in great demand in northern Iraq. A great 
demand exists for the type that contain mustard gas, a toxic 
substance that was tested on the Kurds in Halabja in the past. 
They are the most expensive in the market. How can such 
extremely effective arms be easily acquired in that region, 
where no one dares to turn his back on anyone? 
  The minority peoples and terrorist groups have greatly 
benefited from the authority vacuum in northern Iraq after the 
Gulf War. The Iraqi military forces abandoned large quantities 
of various types of arms, including chemical weapons, in that 
region. In fact, the amount of arms left in the area was enough 
to arm a medium-size army. 
  Obviously, forces other than the Saddam administration in 
the 
region possess various types of arms, from light and heavy arms 
to chemical weapons, at the present time. Nearly all the arms 
the Iraqi military forces abandoned in the past are in the hands 
of the Kurdish leaders, most of whom we know very well. 
Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud Barzani and 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani, who are 
among the "legal" leaders of the Kurds in northern Iraq, top the 
list of leading Kurdish officials who control the chemical arms 
in the region. 
  Chemical arms are stored in more than 10 small and large 
residential areas. Zakho and Irbil are the largest and most 
important among them. The surrounding areas of the two towns 
provide an opportunity for the Kurds to store and sell their 
chemical arms. 
<H5>  Depots and Sales </H5>
  The arms depots in Irbil are located in four areas. The 
largest depots are in Sheyhulla and Hasankaya Districts. The 
entire basement of the bus station in Irbil, which is known as 
the Karkuk Bus Terminal, is a chemical arms depot. Another 
depot is known to be in Diyana, which can be reached after three 
hours of driving from Irbil. The Kurds sell their chemical arms 
in those depots. Anyone can buy chemical arms from them, 
provided that he has the cash to pay it. 
  The situation in Zakho, which is an important settlement in 
northern Iraq, is no different than that in Irbil. A large 
amount of chemical arms exist in that town. The area adjacent 
to the Abbasi Bridge is a well-established chemical arms depot 
and sales center. Meanwhile, various types of chemical arms can 
be purchased in Izza, which is not far from Zakho. However, the 
depot in Izza is smaller than those in the other areas. The 
Karkuk Bus Terminal in Irbil and the depot in Zakho are regarded 
as storage centers for chemical arms. Small chemical arms 
depots also exist in Hajj 'Umran and Chamchamal. 
  Jalal Talabani is known to be the patron of the chemical 
arms 
depots in and around Irbil. He decides who should buy chemical 
arms and the amount to be sold. Talabani retains the profit 
made from the sales. 
  The chemical arms depots in and around Zakho are under the 
PKK's control, that is, with the exception of those in a few 
small settlements. The most noticeable of them are those in 
Cisri Abbasi and Izza. In fact, the chemical grenades the PKK 
militants used against the people in Ormancik Village were 
acquired from those depots.

  [Excerpt] A high-ranking General Staff official was on the 
telephone. We were discussing the previous day's successful 
operation by our Air Force against Zhalah camp, one of the new 
bases of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. 
  This official said: "Our air operation hit all the targets 
and we achieved results. The Turkish Air Force has proven that 
if necessary it could also destroy targets beyond 500 
kilometers. In terms of distance Zhalah camp is not nearer than 
al-Biqa'. If the civilian authority orders, we can similarly 
strike at al-Biqa'." 
  This high-ranking General Staff official placed special 
emphasis on al-Biqa' and made no request that this not be 
published. 
  The conclusion that could be drawn from this is that 
al-Biqa' 
has been included among targets that could be struck when the 
international situation allows. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Faruk Balikci: "Journalists Not Allowed Into the </F>
Zhalah Camp"] 
  [Text] Irbil--Journalists have not been allowed to enter 
the Zhalah camp in northern Iraq, which was bombed by Turkish 
Air Force units. The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] informed 
Turkish journalists who traveled to northern Iraq to visit the 
Zhalah camp after it was bombed in a cross-border air operation 
on Friday [28 January] that the "embargo on the press is being 
maintained" and that they will not be allowed into the camp. 
  Several Kurdish sources in the region have claimed that the 
PKK militants left the Zhalah camp at 0500 and returned at 1900 
on 26 January. 
  Meanwhile, 'Abdallah Rasul Kusret, prime minister of the 
federal Kurdish state in northern Iraq, said that his government 
was not informed about Turkey's air operation. He asserted: 
"Consequently, we were not able to take precautionary measures 
in our villages. We lost 18 people in Sheni, Goreser, and Sune, 
which are close to the border. Many of our people were wounded. 
Nine people were killed and 19 others were wounded in Iran. 
The PKK lost only seven men." 
  Stressing that they have informed Ankara on their reaction 
to 
the air operation, Kosret said: "The Zhalah camp is 120 km from 
Turkey's border. PKK maintained its activities in areas close 
to Turkey. We signed a protocol with that organization and 
allowed its members to settle in the Zhalah camp. Our objective 
was to keep the PKK away from the border. Turkey is aware of 
that. The protocol we have signed is still valid. The PKK 
members are in the Zhalah camp. That is where they maintain 
their activities." 
  Local sources have said that 1,200 militants were based in 
that camp until recently. However, they also said that 
considering the possibility of an air attack, the PKK recently 
reduced the number of its militants in that camp to 500 and 
began to use it as a facility for support services instead of a 
base for military and political training.

<F P=106> [Article by Emin Pazarci from the "Outlook" column: "Look </F>
Out for Nakhichevan!"] 
  [Text] For days now Turkey has found itself in an election 
flurry, the intensity of which is bound to increase. 
  As the late Menderes [prime minister in the 1950's] would 
have said, "we have now entered the uphill election campaign." 
The struggle has already gone beyond the limits of local 
elections. An atmosphere similar to a general election prevails 
in the country. 
  We will go on talking and thinking about elections for two 
more months. Turkey will redirect its attention to the home 
front and again be unable to see what is happening around her. 
  We already lost Azerbaijan, and if things continue like this 
we will also lose Nakhichevan from under our very noses. 
  It was not enough that we lost Azerbaijan; if things 
continue 
like this Azerbaijan will even start giving Turkey trouble. 
  There is a newspaper called "SES" in Baku. It is under the 
control of President Geydar Aliyev. The paper has almost become 
the press organ of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Some 
days ago, it pronounced Apo [alias of PKK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan] "the great Kurdish hero." Almost every day the paper 
advertises Abdullah Ocalan's books. 
  Could such a paper ever have been published during the 
Elchibey period? Of course not. Yet, we not only failed to 
come to the support of Elchibey, we even backed Aliyev. During 
visits to Turkey, we pressured Elchibey in order to catapult 
Aliyev to the forefront. We held Aliyev in esteem. Now, the 
result is here for everyone to see. Now, it is useless to be 
sorry. 
  Now efforts are under way to hatch a series of plots in 
Nakhichevan, yet, we remain blind to these developments. We 
have withdrawn into ourselves so much that we have no idea of 
what is going on under our very noses. 
  Today "an Aliyev terror" is sweeping through Nakhichevan. 
The Nakhichevan Assembly has been unable to meet for the last 
seven months. It is Geydar Aliyev who prevents the convocation 
of the Assembly. There is a total lack of law and order in the 
country; this is what Aliyev really wants. He shelved the 
Constitution and is running Nakhichevan as he sees fit. Three 
deputies are in jail. Most of the members of the People's Front 
are under detention. The homes of most of the People's Front 
members were either burned down or demolished. The place has 
been turned into ruins. Many people are under detention. 
  More than 200 people applied to the Turkish consulate and 
asked for political asylum. The Nakhichevan deputies appealed 
to and asked for the help of the Turkish parliament, saying: 
"Tell Geydar Aliyev to put an end to this oppression." 
  In short, Nakhichevan is on fire. 
  Aliyev's terrorism is continuing with the greatest 
intensity. 
As always, Turkey has again remained a spectator. 
  As was done in the case of Azerbaijan, there could be those 
who say: "Why should we care about Nakhichevan?" They could 
also argue that "Those are Nakhichevan's domestic affairs." 
  Yes, it is true that these are Nakhichevan's domestic 
affairs, but this time around, the situation is radically 
different. Nakhichevan is fast becoming a place that might cause 
Turkey trouble. 
  Though 10,000 Kurds lived in Nakhichevan, until now there 
was 
no "Kurdish movement" there. No problems arose because there 
were no instigators around, but now the situation has changed. 
The PKK has now laid its hands upon Nakhichevan. It is trying 
to sow the seeds of a "Kurdish movement." 
  The PKK is roaming freely in Nakhichevan. The borders are 
porous. They enter and leave the place as they wish. They move 
between Armenia and Nakhichevan. They enter from Iran. They 
also enter Turkey whenever they like. 
  This is not all. The PKK even has training camps on 
Nakhichevan's borders with Armenia and Iran. Hundreds of PKK 
members are being trained in Nakhichevan. Geydar Aliyev's armed 
units remain mere spectators. 
  Nakhichevan is fast becoming the center of a serious threat 
to Turkey. 
  Is Turkey not aware of what is going on? 
  Of course it is, but no clear policy has been formulated on 
Nakhichevan. As in the case of the policy towards Azerbaijan, 
Turkey has again remained a mere spectator and has assumed a 
wait-and-see attitude. As regards Nakhichevan, we will again do 
what we usually do: We will be too late to act and then will be 
sorry for the missed opportunity.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Will Ciller Run Out of Smoke </F>
Screens?"] 
  [Text] Only on Saturday [29 January] we wholeheartedly 
applauded the Turkish air raid against the Zhalah terrorist camp 
of the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) and said we believed the 
terrorists got what they deserved. Now we see that an 
unfortunate controversy has surrounded the military operation 
against Zhalah in northern Iraq. 
  The operation against Zhalah was justified and well overdue. 
We had pointed out several times in the past in the TURKISH 
DAILY NEWS that the Iraqi Kurdish leaders had lost control over 
the separatist militants of the PKK who were using Zhalah as a 
logistics base as well as a training camp. The fact that Turkey 
can launch such an operation deep inside a foreign territory 
should be an appropriate message for all those who provide 
shelter to terrorists. This is all fine. Yet we are saddened 
by claims that Ciller had ordered the air raid against Zhalah 
simply to divert public attention from her economic defeat when 
the Turkish lira was devalued by 13.6 percent earlier last week. 
We know well that the military had contingency plans to raid 
Zhalah and that all preparations had been made for the attack. 
Yet we are now told that Ciller wanted the air raid on Friday 
at short notice for her own political benefit rather than to 
fulfill a particular security goal. The fact that the PKK 
claims its casualties are minimal, and is prepared to take 
journalists to Zhalah to prove it, will put many people in a 
poor light. It seems Ciller did not bargain for the current 
controversy surrounding the Zhalah raid. Now she will have to 
create a new smoke screen to make people forget the Zhalah 
incident. So what can she do? 
  She can start with devaluing the Turkish lira a bit more, or 
even announce a new bitter economic austerity package to bring 
us back to our senses. Then we will all be thinking about our 
pockets again and we can forget about Zhalah... 
  If things really get out of hand and people revolt, then 
Tansu Ciller could even declare war on Armenia or Syria to once 
again divert our attention abroad. 
  She will never run out of smoke screens and the Turkish 
nation will continue to find itself in woman-made disasters 
until the people get the chance to vote her out of office or her 
own party deposes her.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb. 2 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
signed a framework document for the Partnership for Peace [PFP] 
programme, at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday [2 
February]. 
  "The Partnership for Peace programme provides Poland with 
the 
opportunity to develop contacts guaranteeing her security in the 
future," the prime minister told a press conference after the 
signing of the document. 
  He stressed several times that the Partnership is an open 
formula and its content "depends on our activity." If there are 
certain limitations "they are in the sphere of our possibilities 
and not expectations or willingness." He pointed out to the 
significance of the participation of Russia in this programme. 
  According to Pawlak, "these two days (Tuesday and Wednesday) 
are of utmost importance for Poland. Yesterday, the association 
treaty between Poland and the European Union came into force. 
Today I had the opportunity and the pleasure to sign at the 
NATO headquarters a document that starts the Partnership for 
Peace procedure. Poland's contacts with the West are acquairing 
new dymanic," he added. 
  Addressing the participants in the ceremony, as earlier 
while 
he was speaking to parliamentarians, Waldemar Pawlak appealed 
for "the partnership for development" suggesting that the scheme 
will add closer cooperation to the NATO programme. 
  Earlier in the day, the prime minister met with leader of 
the 
European Parliament Egon Klepsch, and replied to questions asked 
by members of the European Parliament concerning the Phare 
programme and Poland's relations with her Eastern neighbours. 
The prime minister declared that Poland is striving to have the 
best possible relations with them but her efforts are hampered 
by the unstable situation in Russia and Ukraine. 
  Between the meeting with parliamentarians and the signing of 
the Partnership for Peace programme, Waldemar Pawlak was 
received by Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. 
  In the evening he met with representatives of Polish 
community at the Polish Consulate General in Brussels. 
  Later on, he was the dinner guest of organizers of the 
Thursday international conference on Polish affairs.

<F P=106> [Report signed "L.B.": "Spain, EIB's Chief Recipient in </F>
1993"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels -- During 1993, Spain was the chief 
recipient of European Investment Bank [EIB] loans, totaling ECU4 
billion (581 billion pesetas), earmarked for infrastructures and 
industrial investments, representing 22.6 percent of the total 
loans made within the European Union [EU]. The second recipient 
is Italy, which took up 19 percent of the investments. EIB 
investments outside the EU represent 9.6 percent of the 
mobilized total. 
  The increase in EIB investments in Spain was 45 percent for 
the year, thus overtaking the traditional chief recipient 
country, which used to be Italy. 
  If it is estimated that EIB loans provide on average 30 
percent of the amount invested in each project; the money 
mobilized represents 14 percent of the investment in Spain in 
1993. The EIB's investment decisions depend on the applications 
and management ability of the states, which have to submit 
coherent plans, well supported by profitability and 
environmental impact studies. 
  The 1993 fiscal year was very good for the EIB, according to 
its executives, who presented a balance sheet recording a 15 
percent increase over the previous year and a ECU19.6 billion 
(over 3.1 trillion pesetas) grand total of loans. 
  According to its president, Brian Unwin, the EIB "has played 
a key role in the Community's economic recovery program, 
especially with respect to financing the trans-European 
networks." 
<H5>  Unwarranted Accusations </H5>
  The non-Community countries, primarily in North Africa and 
Central and East Europe, took up ECU1.9 billion (300 billion 
pesetas). Despite this, Brian Unwin stated that the 
Mediterranean countries received over twice what was lent in the 
previous year, and so it is unwarranted to accuse the bank of 
paying greater attention to the East than to the south. 
  Half of the EIB's loans to Spain consisted of investments in 
transport, prominent among which are the Madrid to Seville 
high-speed train, the Bilbao to Santander line, the subway 
systems of Bilbao, Madrid, and Valencia, two sections of 
expressway in Barcelona, local roads in several provinces, new 
terminals, the enlargement of airports in Palma, Madrid, and 
Barcelona, and the modernization of the ports of Barcelona, 
Bilbao, and Valencia. Some 15 percent of the loans were for 
water supply and treatment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Davos, Jan 28 (CTK) -- The fact that the U.S. Exim 
Bank approved guarantees for loans of $317 million to complete 
and modernize Temelin nuclear power has approved again the 
correctness of all the decisions taken by the Czech Government 
regarding Temelin, Premier Vaclav Klaus told CTK today. 
  Klaus arrived on Thursday [28 January] in Switzerland to 
attend the World Economic Forum. 
  Construction of the plant, located in southern Bohemia, 
started in 1986, and from the very beginning it has been 
strongly criticized by environmental organizations, especially 
in neighboring Austria. American banks and manufacturers are 
involved in the project. 
  "It is another reply to those who are falsely accusing us 
both back home and among our southern neighbors," Klaus stated. 
  The bank certainly took this step after careful 
consideration, he said, adding that he had expected the bank to 
make the decision.

afternoon [27 January] in Zurich. At the news conference 
afterward at Zurich-Kloten Airport, Mr. Cotti declared that 
Denmark had assured Switzerland of its support in the bilateral 
negotiations with the European Union [EU]. Mr. Petersen has 
welcomed the Swiss strategic goal of joining the EU. 
  The Danish foreign minister believes this will facilitate 
bilateral negotiations. Denmark and other countries will be 
pleased to see Switzerland join the EU, the Danish minister 
said. He feels the Danish experience proves that small 
countries have at their disposal important possibilities to act 
within the EU.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC Hopes To Promote Direct </F>
Investment in Latin America"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE 
database] 
  [Text] In its own initiative opinion on relations between 
the European Union and Latin America, the Economic and Social 
Committee (ESC) of the European Communities devotes a special 
chapter to investment in Latin America. The ESC writes: "The 
Latin American countries are trying to attract direct European 
investment. Over recent years the EU has been one of the 
principal sources of direct investment in the region. In some 
years it has outstripped all others. Direct investment can help 
to generate employment, to promote technology transfer and to 
modernize infrastructure, agriculture and industry. It can also 
contribute to the economic stability of the recipient country. 
However, the world recession and investment requirements in the 
EU itself (arising from the internal market) and in other areas 
(such as Central and East Europe) could lead to a diminishing 
flow of direct European investment to Latin America. At the 
same time the wave of privatizations, which attracted major 
capital flows, has come to an end in a number of Latin American 
countries. A number of other factors have also been 
influential, such as the attempted coups d'etat in Venezuela, 
the presidential crisis in Brazil and the referendum against 
privatization in Uruguay. Against this backdrop, EU instruments 
for promoting cooperation investment, such as the Business 
Corporation Network and the EU-IIP have an important role to 
play. More could perhaps be done - e.g. through the EU 
representations in the various countries -to bring these 
instruments to the notice of potential investors. Member state 
financial incentives to encourage companies to invest in Latin 
America are likewise of primary importance. Some Latin American 
countries have achieved a sufficient level of economic 
development, stability and economic growth to be eligible for 
EIB [European Investment Bank] loans and financial support from 
the member states for a whole range of projects (e.g. improved 
energy supplies, trade promotion, industrial cooperation, joint 
ventures and technology transfer). 
  ``This is helping to improve the business climate, build 
mutual confidence and broaden Latin American market prospects 
for European products. The Committee urges the Commission to 
prepare studies on European investment opportunities in Latin 
America and, in the light of its findings, to draw up proposals 
for expanding the range of EU instruments for promoting such 
investment. Similarly, it calls upon the member states to take 
steps to back direct private and public investment in the 
region. It is also important for Latin America that a favorable 
business climate be maintained, that an adequate legal framework 
be created, notably to combat the expropriation practices which 
have been used in the past, and that sufficient economic and 
political stability prevail to try to attract and keep foreign 
investors in the region and encourage the repatriation of 
capital which had fled the region in the past. Past mistakes -- 
which led to the debt crisis and cost the region the `wasted 
decade' of the 1980's -- must be avoided in the use of public 
and private funds. It must be remembered that debt is still at a 
high level and could, in the medium-term, jeopardize the 
relative stability achieved over the last few years."

evidently did not keep to the target. On Thursday [3 February] 
the Bundesbank announced that the annual money supply growth 
rate was 8.1 percent (preliminary value) in December. In 
November the M3 money supply (cash in circulation, sight 
deposits, time deposits with maturities of less than four years, 
and savings deposits) had grown with an annual rate of 7.2 
percent. The Bundesbank had set the target zone for 1993 at 4.5 
to 6.5 percent. This year the guardians of the currency are 
aiming at monetary growth between 4 and 6 percent.

Germany continues to decrease. In January, the authorities 
registered 13,154 applicants, which is 879 fewer than last 
December, Erwin Marschewski, domestic-policy spokesman for the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] 
Bundestag group, told DPA on Wednesday [2 February]. Even the 
December number of 14,033 registered asylum-applicants had been 
described by the Federal Interior Ministry as being the lowest 
figure since March 1991. 
  Marschewski pointed out than in January 1993 as many as 
36,279 persons applied for asylum. The decrease in the number 
of applicants by more than half, which was initiated last July 
when the new asylum law came into force, is "most encouraging," 
Marschewski said.

  [Text] Berlin -- According to the Federation of German 
Trade Unions [DGB], the job deficit in the new laender amounted 
to 2.9 million at the end of last year. This "real job deficit" 
is 1.7 million higher than the number of unemployed given by the 
official statistics from Nuremberg, which put the number of 
unemployed people in the east at some 1.2 million at the end of 
1993. The real statistics include those citizens who 
participate in job-promotion schemes offered by the labor 
offices or who commute to western Germany, the DGB noted in 
Berlin on Wednesday [2 February]. 
  In Saxony, approximately 790,000 are "underemployed," in 
Saxony Anhalt 540,000, in Thuringia 510,000, in Brandenburg 
455,000, in Mecklenburg Western Pomerania 365,000, and in the 
eastern part of Berlin some 275,000. The situation is most 
favorable in Dresden, where the job deficit was 23.6 percent at 
the end of 1993. Second came Leipzig (28.4 percent deficit), 
while, with an unemployment deficit of 41.3 percent, the Suhl 
region in Thuringia came at the bottom of the list.

<F P=106> [Article by Marco Nese: "Scalfaro: `I Continue To Do My Duty </F>
Calmly'"] 
  [Text] The president of the Republic against 
demilitarization of the Carabinieri: These are attempts to 
diminish and weaken it. 
  Inauguration of the academic year at the Carabinieri 
officers' school. Incisa di Camerana agrees with the chief of 
state. Federici: no more escorts. 
  Rome--Tradition dictates that it be a solemn and austere 
ceremony. But this time even the inauguration of the academic 
year at the Carabinieri officers' school took place amid 
polemics and venom. With Chief of State Scalfaro who says: "Keep 
your hands off the stars [military badges of rank]," to those 
who are pressing for the demilitarization of the Carabinieri. 
With Commanding General Luigi Federici who is fed up with seeing 
the Carabinieri used as escorts. With parliamentary deputy 
Antonio Pappalardo (a retired Carabinieri colonel) who gets up 
and leaves as soon as Scalfaro begins speaking. As a protest, he 
says. Because it displeases him that the president of the 
Republic ("a man who should have resigned to place himself at 
the disposal of the magistracy, like an ordinary citizen") 
stayed away from Calabria on the day of the funeral of the two 
murdered Carabinieri. 
  Scalfaro must be accustomed to these little scenes by now. 
He 
continued as though nothing had happened, turning his thoughts 
to the "two murdered Carabinieri, who remind us of the price to 
be paid for the liberty of the Italian people." He called the 
attention of all "to man's terrible capacity to commit crime, to 
man's immense, fascinating, rich, shining capacity to sacrifice 
himself." And then he told of having spoken by telephone with 
the commander of the company of Carabinieri at Palmi after 
hearing the news of the murder of the two Carabinieri. 
  "He told me: `We are deeply wounded. We remain calm and 
strong. No one will bend us. We will continue to do our duty 
calmly, without stopping.'" Scalfaro made these words his own, a 
"simple and fresh message. I gather it to myself and, with best 
wishes for a good academic year, I offer it to you (directing 
himself to the students there present) as a commitment and a 
meditation." 
  The focus of the speech then broadened to the Carabinieri as 
an institution. "The stars worn by the Carabinieri are 
essential," Scalfaro said. But who wants to take their stars 
away from the men of this deserving force? Most of all, the 
SIULP [Unified Police Workers Labor Union], the policemen's 
union, which insists on the need to demilitarize the Carabinieri 
and bring them under the control of the Ministry of Interior, 
removing them from the Defense Ministry. 
  Nothing doing, said the chief of state. These are all 
"attempts to diminish and weaken" the Force. Otherwise: "You 
might as well say that when the stars are gone, the Carabinieri 
are gone." 
  According to Scalfaro, there are political and historical 
reasons for not changing the present arrangement. The decision 
to entrust the security of the country and the maintenance of 
public order to two separate bodies was taken "at the birth of 
the Republic." The president of the Republic recalled that, "It 
was a decision of state, a political decision." Certainly, he 
added, "there is no doubt that the two solutions have advantages 
and disadvantages." But, "it was believed, and it is still 
believed, by an absolute majority, if not unanimously, that this 
pluralism has enormous advantages, especially in a democratic 
state." 
  A decisive not to demilitarize was also voiced by Army Chief 
of Staff Incisa di Camerana and by the commanding general of the 
Carabinieri, Federici, who reviewed the reasons for complaints 
from within the Force. And he proposed solutions. First of all, 
the use of Carabinieri as escorts must be ended. He called for a 
halt in "the drain represented by requests for protection and 
security measures that risk causing dangerous shortages of 
trained personnel." 
  Federici maintains that it is a mistake to speak of a lack 
of 
coordination between the two forces: "It already exists." And he 
does not want to hear of the possibility of transferring the 
Carabinieri to the control of the Ministry of Interior. "Under 
this solution--according to the commanding general of the 
Force--the functional relationships would remain substantially 
unchanged. Only the authority responsible for the Force would 
change, and it would raise a question in the future as to the 
existence of two separate police forces with broad 
responsibilities, which is the result of a democratic choice 
that may be found in most democratic countries in the world." 
  An important part of Federici's speech was devoted to the 
murder of the two Carabinieri. According to the commanding 
general, there is no connection between the double murder in 
Scilla and the discovery of weapons for an assassination attempt 
against Judge Cordova: "The ambush is a reaction to the intense 
and incisive activity of the Force against the gangs of local 
organized crime, the 'Ndranghetta." All the more reason for 
Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri to confirm, after the murders, 
that the deployment of troops to Calabria is imminent. The 
soldiers will take part in an operation called Riace, which will 
have the same characteristics as the operation called Sicilian 
Vespers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Lawyers, Doctors, Bankers Netted in </F>
Mafia Sweep"] 
  [Excerpts] Palermo, 2 Feb (ANSA) -- Three Palermo criminal 
lawyers, four doctors and two savings bank officials were among 
the 76 persons named in preventive detention custody warrants 
served this morning in an anti-Mafia operation that smashed what 
investigators called the "most important hit team of recent 
years" and shed fresh light on how the mob bought or coerced the 
services of local professionals. 
  The operation, codenamed Golden Market, was based on 
testimony from leading Mafia turncoats including the recently 
arrested "super-killer" Giovanni Drago, accused of taking part 
in 36 homicides between 1986 and 1990. Many of those taken into 
custody are his alleged accomplices. Magistrates pointed to 
Drago's November 1989 slaying of three close female relatives of 
super-grass Francesco Marino Mannoia -- then beginning to 
collaborate with justice, in the utmost secrecy -- as evidence 
of the presence of Mafia moles within the most heavily guarded 
reaches of the investigative apparatus. 
  Of the 76 warrants, 34 were served on persons already in 
jail 
for Mafia offences, including all the incarcerated components of 
the Mafia's supreme coordinating body, the Cupola (Dome): boss 
of bosses Salvatore Riina, Francesco Madonia, Bernardo Brusco 
and Giuseppe Calo'. 18 persons had gone underground, including 
the doctor Goiacchino Pennino, and clan heads Pietro Aglieri, 
Giovanni Brusca, and Mariano Tullio Troia. Two of the three 
lawyers, Carmelo Cordaro and Marco Clementi, were taken into 
custody while the third, Gaetano Zarcone, has been on the run 
for two years, but sent magistrates a letter two months ago 
claiming he was the victim of defamation. 
  According to informants including super-grasses Gaspare 
Mutolo and Baldassare Di Maggio -- the same witnesses who 
alleged Mafia links on the part of former premier Giulio 
Andreotti -- Cordaro swore allegiance as "man of honour" for one 
of the main Palermo crime families, the Porta Nuova clan. 
Clementi is accused by the informants of acting as a go-between 
for jailed bosses -- in particular, his clients in the Madonia 
clan -- and their operatives on the outside. Among the 
allegations against Zircone is that of introducing into 
Palermo's Ucciardone prison the poison that killed boss Gerlando 
Alberti 10 years ago. 
  The doctors named in the warrants, two of them military 
medical officers, stand accused of issuing false medical 
certificates to allow jailed Mafiosi out of prison. In 
particular, one of the military doctors, Antonino Mattina, is 
accused of accepting a 50 million lire bribe to have boss Pietro 
Vernengo transferred to a hospital from which he escaped in 1991. 
  The exact charges against the two officials of the 
Sicilcassa 
savings bank are not known, but a statement from investigators 
spoke of a "distorted exercise of their activities" on the part 
of all 9 local professionals, who had been "either corrupted or 
intimidated" by the mob. 
  This first involvement of criminal lawyers in an anti-Mafia 
operation follows repeated assertions by leading informants that 
they were used to exert influence on judges. One turncoat, 
Antonino Calderone, recently told investigators that the Mafia 
"asks a lawyer what a judge is like, and the lawyer will tell 
you who knows the judge and can get close to him." 
In recent testimony to the parliamentary anti-Mafia 
commission, Mutolo spoke of "controlling" lawyers, many of them 
"men of honour", who exert behind-the-scenes influence to swing 
trials, as well as "corridor" lawyers who give tips on how 
Mafiosi should handle their defence. He added that the Mafia 
deliberately chose lawyers of the same political persuasion as 
judges, usually achieving "more favourable" treatment. [passage 
omitted] 
  The chairman of the Palermo criminal lawyers' association, 
Giovanni Natoli, expressed "appreciation" for the colleagues 
involved in the probe and confidence that they would be able to 
defend themselves from the "groundless" accusations of Mafia 
turncoats whom he described as "wholly untrustworthy persons". 
He added that while no comment was possible on the accusations 
they faced, the lawyers' association would take on the formal 
defence of its members.

  [Text] Rome, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- A paper bomb exploded under a 
diplomatic car outside the Spanish embassy in Rome at around 10 
o'clock [0900 GMT] this morning, injuring the driver in the 
buttocks. The driver was taken to hospital as police and 
firemen rushed to the scene. 
  The driver was later identified as an Italian employee of 
the 
embassy, Marco Formichella, 34, suffering from cuts and bruises 
after a blast that made a small hole in the road surface and 
split open the side of the car. 
  The bomb is believed to have been a rudimentary device, 
little more than a cardboard box packed with nitrate-based 
explosive, with an electrical detonator (proved by the discovery 
of six small batteries under the car). 
  Investigators are trying to establish whether it was set off 
by a timer, or was attached to the car ignition -- a thesis 
indicated by the fact that it went off as the driver turned the 
key.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Political Reshuffling Continues Over </F>
Weekend"] 
  [Text] Rome, 30 Jan (ANSA) -- The reshuffling of the 
Italian political scene continued over the weekend as the 
Italian Social Movement [MSI], heir to the Fascist Party, 
reorganised itself as a broader rightist grouping called the 
National Alliance, the small Republican Party cast its lot in 
with moderates at the centre of the political spectrum and the 
Socialists pursued their search for a new identity. 
  After the vote in favour of the new course propounded by the 
Social Movement's secretary, Gianfranco Fini, the party's 
central committee was meeting here this afternoon to name the 
candidates for the elections on March 27. The committee will 
approve extending the political bureau to include 
representatives of the internal opposition led by one of the 
more radical of the old guard neo-Fascist ideologues, Pino Rauti. 
  In a speech this morning, Rauti accepted the Fini line and 
urged that the party must be "as compact and united as possible" 
at the polls. Even while admitting that, today, he would still 
don the uniform he wore when, fifty years ago, he took part in 
dictator Benito Mussolini's rump Fascist republic at Salo' on 
Lake Como, he said the National Alliance should "choose from the 
past what bears indications for the future." He also said there 
was no going back to the laissez-faire economic theories of the 
1800s "as though Fascism and Communism had never been.... For 
my part, I wouldn't want to have taken part in the March on Rome 
and a World War simply to arrive at laissez-faire." 
  More immediately, as the Italian Right sorts itself into new 
configurations, apart from the ex-Christian Democrats of the 
Democratic Christian Centre, the National Alliance's major 
electoral ally will be TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi's Rooting for 
Italy movement, which is seen as a bridge between National 
Alliance and Umberto Bossi's Northern League. 
  For Fini, Berlusconi is a possible prime minister: "As I've 
said before, I rule myself out, and I don't think there is any 
need to indicate a premier (before the elections). But if there 
had to be a choice between Bossi and Berlusconi, I would choose 
Berlusconi because he unites North and South, whereas Bossi 
splits Italy in two." 
  Yesterday, Northern League leader Umberto Bossi took a 
similar line when he launched the League's election campaign at 
Rovigo near Venice, though he disagreed with Fini when he poured 
cold water on Berlusconi's ambitions to become premier. "I 
don't see him as the next prime minister," said Bossi, sketching 
in a role for the tycoon as a "mediator" between the often 
conflicting demands of northern and southern Italy. 
  Bossi also joined Berlusconi in identifying the Democratic 
Party of the Left [PDS] as the major adversary, though he also 
condemned the Vatican's statement of support last week for 
Catholic unity, warning that "religion must return to caring for 
souls, not politics." 
  These right-wing formations all sought to distance 
themselves 
from the former government parties which are still trying to 
re-create the former bloc of moderate opinion that they 
represented in the centre of the political spectrum. 
  At a meeting of the Republican Party's National Council 
here, 
Party Secretary Giorgio La Malfa argued for a "third position" 
with figures such as ex-Christian Democrat Mario Segni, People's 
Party (ex-Christian Democrat) Secretary Mino Martinazzoli, and 
ex-Premier Giuliano Amato, identified closely with former 
Socialist Party Secretary Bettino Craxi. While surprising his 
audience by announcing that he would not be seeking re-election, 
La Malfa ruled out any alliance on the right in a brusque 
beginning and spent much of his time explaining why he excludes 
joining the progressives with whom he has shared the opposition 
benches since pulling the Republicans out of their traditional 
slot in the ruling majority in mid-April 1992. 
  Like other political leaders, including PDS Secretary 
Achille 
Occhetto, La Malfa said the Italian political scene was 
currently one of "great confusion." In particular, he said the 
next parliament would have to complete the electoral and 
institutional reform and also said he expects the future 
scenario of political alliances to take some time to stabilise. 
  "I'm looking neither right nor left, but straight ahead," 
quipped Martinazzoli at a meeting of the People's Party in 
Milan, who also said he would not be seeking re-election. He 
added an ironic reference to the ex-Christian Democrat 
Neo-Centrists who are expected to ally themselves with Fini: "If 
you will allow me, calling oneself a `centrist' when you are 
leaving the centre is something of an eccentricity. Moderation 
is to 'moderatism' as chastity is to impotence." 
  But, in Florence, Rocco Buttiglione, the leading ideologue 
of the People's Party, which many have accused of seeking to 
postpone the elections so as it can regroup the moderates more 
effectively, argued for a highly temporary vision of the coming 
parliament. If a moderate bloc fails to win, he told reporters, 
the best solution would be a government of non-party experts or 
one named by the head-of-state to push through the "urgent and 
indispensable" measures and then return to the polls when the 
political options may be clearer. 
  Meanwhile, if Martinazzoli said he would be leaving the 
political scene at the congress of the People's Party convened 
in May, between the Italian and the European elections, the 
Estates General called by Socialist Party Secretary Ottaviano 
Del Turco was told that a congress was likely at about the same 
time. Even though the Estates General voted no motion, one 
bearing the names of 100 delegates urged the expulsion of 
ex-Secretary Bettino Craxi and his closer aides for their 
"evident political responsibilities" and their role in the still 
unfolding bribery and corruption scandals. 
  Del Turco's speech returning the Socialists firmly to the 
progressive and breaking with Craxi's location of the party in 
the political centre received wide applause across the 
progressive political spectrum. "A real turning-point," was the 
comment from Occhetto, whose entry into the assembly hall was 
greeted by the exit of a small group of Craxi faithful, 
including his former spokesman Ugo Intini. 
  As the Socialists pursue what their present chairman, Labour 
Minister Gino Giugni, described as the "restoration of the house 
of Italian Socialism," a poll of delegates showed that 74 
percent wanted no renewal of Craxi's party membership and 60 
percent would like to see Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi 
serve a second term. Other findings in the survey 43 percent in 
favour of the resignation of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
immediately after the elections, a demand also advanced by 
National Alliance, the Northern League and others because of 
Scalfaro's apparent implication in alleged moves to cover up 
financial misdeeds in the secret services. 
  Republican Party secretary Giorgio La Malfa's platform not 
to 
join the Progressive Pact and the Democratic Alliance, to which 
many Republicans already adhere, was passed by a very slim 
majority of 6 votes, 65 to 59, confirming the divisions within 
the small party which may become official Monday [31 January]. 
Before the final vote was taken, La Malfa added to his document 
a passage which said how he would make a "last-ditch attempt", 
in his meeting tomorrow with the Democratic Alliance, to 
convince PDS leader Achille Occhetto to drop the orthodox 
Communist Renaissance and Leoluca Orlando's Rete from the 
progressive pole. La Malfa went on to add how he in no way 
underestimated Berlusconi's entrance in politics nor the 
reinforcement of the Right. Nevertheless, he argued, there was 
no solid rightist block from Martinazzoli to Fini, nor 
Right-Left confrontation. Otherwise, La Malfa said "I would 
have called everyone to the Left". This was not the case, the 
Republican leader argued, because of the novelty of 
Martinazzoli, steering clear to the Right, and the credibility 
of Mario Segni. 
  Reaction to La Malfa's stand was predictable, with Massimo 
D'Alema of the Democratic Party of the Left defining it as 
"short-sighted", while praising La Malfa's decision not to run, 
while Senate Speaker Giovanni Spadolini, the Republican deacon, 
saw it as "coherent."

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Environment Minister Valdo Spini by </F>
Guido Credazzi in Rome; date not given: "Spini: `PSI With the 
Social Christians and AD'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- While the splinters of the PSI [Italian 
Socialist Party] are scattering in every direction, there is 
someone who would like to group together at least the forces 
that have flowed into the progressive camp to go into the 
elections, with proportionate shares, alongside the Christian 
Socialists and the AD [Democratic Alliance]. That person is 
Environment Minister Valdo Spini, always on the left of the PSI 
in opposition to Craxi, and who one year ago was defeated in the 
vote for party secretary by Giorgio Benvenuto. 
  [Credazzi] Why do you want this alliance? Are you afraid of 
not getting the all-important 4 percent and being left out of 
things? 
  [Spini] Maybe we will get it, but we could also stick on 3.9 
percent. It is certain, however, that not everyone will get 
through. If we were united, we would be able to win 8 or 9 
percent and play a competitive role in opposing a very 
aggressive center that is fighting its electoral campaign 
against the Democratic Party of the Left [PDS] (or as Berlusconi 
himself says, the communists). The question is a political one, 
however -- if there is a solid reference point then the numbers 
will increase. 
  [Credazzi] Benvenuto and Ruffolo made the same offer to Del 
Turco. 
  [Spini] I appreciate that very much, as I do any effort that 
aims to bring the Socialists back together. 
  [Credazzi] So you have sided with Secretary Ottaviano Del 
Turco? Officially, however, you have been "isolated".... 
  [Spini] In Tuscany I founded Socialist Action, which 
anticipated the party's decision on the progressive choice. Now 
Del Turco has invited us to the party's general meeting 
tomorrow, and I will make the speech outlining our program. In 
10 points I will say how we can move Italy from a sort of 
communistic socialism with a moderate leadership to a liberal 
socialism with a progressive leadership. 
  [Credazzi] What do you think those socialists such as Piro, 
Sacconi, Boniver, and Ando who founded the Union for Democracy 
and Socialism and who are lining up with the moderate pole, will 
do? 
  [Spini] I can see little room for them because, I repeat, 
the 
socialists voters are progressive. However, they asked for it 
by voting for straightforward one-round voting rather than the 
two- round system. They, and Martinazzoli with them, thought 
that the center would be the favorites, but at the last 
elections we saw Fini and Mussolini in the runoffs. 
  [Credazzi] What do you think of Acquaviva and Covatta lining 
up with Segni? 
  [Spini] It is an attraction toward the Catholic world they 
both come from. 
  [Credazzi] They are accompanied by Laura Fincato and Mauro 
Seppia... 
  [Spini] That is a different matter. They were close to 
Giuliano Amato and they thought that Amato would make that 
choice. 
  [Credazzi] Do you think that Craxi will stand? 
  [Spini] I do not think so, but I cannot be sure since I have 
not seen him for quite a while. 
  [Credazzi] What stance do you take concerning the people 
under investigation? Mattina maintains that they should not 
stand... 
  [Spini] I agree. At the end of 1984 I asked for complete 
transparency in the party and in the electoral campaign, and in 
my speech on our program my first point will be about "clean 
politics." I believe that if the institutions want clear 
standards, the judges should only intervene in pathological 
cases.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Dissident Socialists Join Berlusconi </F>
Alliance"] 
  [Text] Rome, 2 Feb (ANSA) -- The Federation of Reformist 
and Libertarian Socialists, a breakaway group that split with 
Socialist leader Ottaviano Del Turco after his decision to join 
the Left Democrat-led progressive front, have teamed up with 
former Liberals, Social Democrats and the smaller of the two 
ex-Christian Democrat groups behind the Forza Italia [Rooting 
for Italy] banner of media-to-construction magnate Silvio 
Berlusconi, it was learned this morning. 
  Thus the Berlusconi cartel now includes the right-wingers of 
the old Christian Democrat party, grouped in the Democratic 
Christian Centre, the ex-Liberals and Social Democrats of the 
Centrist Union, a separate movement headed by (ex-Liberal party) 
art critic and media personality Vittorio Sgarbi, and the small 
group of Socialists who stayed loyal to disgraced former leader 
Bettino Craxi. 
  The entry of the Socialists took place at a meeting last 
night at Berlusconi's Rome apartment, when agreement was reached 
on a programme focussing on "responsible liberty, for 
individuals and business." 
  Sources for the Federation of Reformist and Libertarian 
Socialists said that, for the moment, any possible alliance with 
the far-right National Alliance (formerly the neo-fascist 
Italian Social Movement) was held up by "differences on the 
programme."

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Republican Party Secretary Giorgio </F>
La Malfa by Fernando Proietti in Rome; date not given: 
"Giorgio: Back to the Center To Create Third Pole and Prevent 
the Right From Winning" -- first four paragraphs are CORRIERE 
DELLA SERA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- In front of the door of the elevator leading 
to the PRI's [Italian Republican Party] headquarters on the 
second floor of a small building in Piazza dei Caprettari, a 
forlorn Oscar Giannino informed the author of this report that 
he had just resigned from his post as La Malfa's spokesperson. 
  So what will he do now? "I really do not know," replied the 
youngest of the Great Old Men who were defeated at the last, 
stormy PRI convention. It took place at the Parco dei Principi 
Hotel, transformed for the occasion into a slaughterhouse of the 
resentment experienced by at least three generations of PRI 
members. With a majority of only six votes, the meeting decided 
the PRI's return to the center. 
  However, on this cold and uncertain, late-January Monday 
morning, Giannino's tearful farewell was not the only split 
which took place within the sober walls of the 
nondenominationalist club. Indeed, following such a 
close-fought victory, what feelings does a leader experience -- 
including from a human point of view -- when he sees some of his 
most loyal co-workers suddenly turning their backs on him? "We 
are very happy," one of the lady assistants of the resuscitated 
secretary said smilingly. Giorgio himself also expressed his 
satisfaction at "the political result, but only at this 
political result" obtained by the PRI. 
  [Proietti] No doubt, it will not be easy for you to heal 
certain wounds... 
  [La Malfa] Did you attend our platform conference at the 
Piccolo Eliseo? If you did, then you must have realized how 
outdated the debate was within our party. This is why I am very 
happy with the final result achieved by our National Council. I 
managed to put some order and clarity back into a party that was 
losing its bearings. This is also why I was particularly 
disappointed by the behavior of some people whose intelligence I 
respect. However, those who are leaving -- and I believe there 
are not many -- are only looking for a seat outside the PRI. 
  [Proietti] Does that include Bruno Visentini and Giovanni 
Ferrara? 
  [La Malfa] I bear them no grudge. Bruno Visentini was the 
only person I informed of the turn beforehand. Not even my 
closest co-workers knew about it. I had to tell Visentini, 
though, if only out of a sense of respect for him. It was 
Visentini who had supported my reelection to the post of 
secretary. 
  [Proietti] What about your formerly heeded adviser Ferrara? 
Would you rather not talk about him? 
  [La Malfa] I am disappointed in Giovanni because of his lack 
of understanding for my political proposal. Despite being a 
very sharp political thinker, he refused to listen to my 
reasons.... 
  [Proietti] What is your reply to Bogi and Battaglia's bitter 
accusations that you are, basically, a turncoat? 
  [La Malfa] I believe their opinions speak for themselves. On 
the other hand, we each strive in our own way to safeguard our 
political life. I lived through a dramatic experience, that of 
bribe city, because I am convinced that politics are not 
something personal, and that, in any case, public opinion must 
be listened to. 
  [Proietti] Why, then, did you accept being reelected as a 
secretary? 
  [La Malfa] It was apparent to me, also at the Cusani trial, 
that people are able to draw distinctions between different 
types of suspects. So when I had to decide whether to go back 
into politics, I asked myself on what conditions I could do so, 
and I decided I could attempt going back by renouncing something 
even more significant, namely, by not standing for a seat in 
parliament. 
  [Proietti] How did you reach your decision to return to the 
center? 
  [La Malfa] The first difficult choice was that of returning 
to politics after the bribe city mishap. This happened when the 
local election results in the fall, especially in Rome and 
Naples, revealed an alarming fact: In the capital, the fascists 
had mustered a relative majority, whereas the winner in Naples 
was a representative of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
opposed to [Alessandra] Mussolini. I was concerned because that 
result was often interpreted in a distorting fashion, as 
apparent from the latest election in Catania, where the fascists 
won by a large majority in the provinces. Only [Pact for Italy 
leader Mario] Segni is standing up to them. So I asked myself: 
What sort of Italy will emerge from the next general elections? 
  [Proietti] Initially, however, you had approached AD 
[Democratic Alliance]. 
  [La Malfa] Yes, [PDS Secretary Achille] Occhetto showed some 
courage, among other things, by giving a negative historical 
judgement on the PCI's [Italian Communist Party] past history. 
However, when I understood that the PDS leader was aiming to 
build a left-wing coalition without worrying too much about who 
was in it, and without giving any thought to the platforms, I 
also asked myself: How can we possibly join forces with 
Communist Renewal which was still singing hymns to Cuba at its 
congress? 
  [Proietti] But AD also included the PRI with Visentini, 
Bogi, 
and Giannino. 
  [La Malfa] My friends who have joined AD will soon 
understand 
that it makes no sense to remain in an alliance which is leading 
them to embrace Bertinotti. I doubt also whether businessmen 
like Averna and Marzotto will be able to stand such company. 
  [Proietti] Of course, the businessmen. What about [Forza 
Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi? 
  [La Malfa] I believe that he is plunging into politics to 
strengthen the right. This, however, is madness. Besides, it 
would not harm a businessman like him to be a little more 
reserved. Agnelli always refused to identify a major productive 
force such as Fiat with any single party. It is most 
distressing to imagine what Italy would really be like if it 
were governed by [National Alliance Secretary] Fini, with 
Berlusconi acting as a mediator between the MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] and the League, and Bertinotti in the opposition. But 
the same applies to the reverse situation. This is why the PRI 
is going back to the center -- to build a third pole and to 
prevent the right from winning.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Paul Goossens: "The Unanswered Question of </F>
General Briquemont"] 
  [Excerpts] "This much is clear," European Commissioner 
Karel Van Miert said last Saturday [29 January] at a SP 
[Dutch-speaking Socialist Party] study day on the European 
Union. "The bungling in the former Yugoslavia cannot continue 
much longer. The various member states will draw their own 
conclusions and once again intervene on their own initiative. 
There is a danger that the bad game of alliances will start 
again." [passage omitted] 
  Claes undoubtedly agrees with Van Miert that things cannot 
continue like they are in the former Yugoslavia. But the 
question of how things should be done remains unanswered -- 
including by Claes. In the most recent issue of DOEN, the SP's 
party journal, the minister is painfully clear on this issue. 
"How should things go from here?" he wrote. "I have no precise 
answer. There are few alternatives to what we have tried, and 
what we are still trying: On the one hand, continuing to 
provide the maximum amount of humanitarian aid possible , and on 
the other hand bringing together the warring parties and trying 
to reach a peaceful settlement." In short, Claes, who also 
added that he has always opposed a military solution, does not 
know what to do. Under the Belgian presidency, he tried with 
great persistence to make something of the European recipe for 
Yugoslavia. Despite his efforts, the attempt was a complete 
failure. There was a great deal of talking, and cease-fires and 
Christmas cease-fires were agreed upon, but, as in the past, 
they held up for at most a couple of hours. The only, very 
relative success of 1993 was that a blazing row did not break 
out between Europe and the United States. Clinton, who as 
presidential candidate dreamed for a time of air strikes, under 
heavy European pressure gave up the idea. Since then the U.S. 
Government's interest in the conflict has chiefly declined. 
  Clinton won the U.S. elections with a domestic program, and 
he is sticking to that consistently. In his State of the Union 
address last week there was no doubt that domestic affairs are 
the most important ones. There is not much leadership coming 
from the United States, except in the economic field. The 
Clinton Administration played an active role in the GATT 
negotiations: It took initiatives and was very active, on the 
audiovisual question among others. Ultimately that is so much 
more specific, especially in terms of jobs, than a risky peace 
operation in Bosnia. The Americans, certainly the Clinton 
generation, are a long way from forgetting Vietnam. Troops are 
only sent abroad for blitz operations, like in Panama and the 
Gulf. The Somalia experience has strengthened the convictions 
of the Washington war lords and political strategists that this 
approach should not be changed for the time being. If order has 
to be restored in the South and a long-term military presence 
becomes necessary, then this job should be contracted out to 
"third parties" -- if necessary to Belgians, but just as well to 
"legions" from Pakistan, India or former Third World countries. 
  It is a new situation for Europe. During the Cold War it 
got used to energetic leadership from the United States, which 
took the initiative continually. That was not always equally 
pleasant or nice for the European allies, because it was 
frequently bad for the European ego but it was comfortable. All 
that was required was to stand in line and carry out what had 
been thought up in the Pentagon or State Department. Now things 
are happening differently. In contrast to the past, the United 
States is letting Europe take initiatives itself. In fact if 
there are problems in the Balkans, Europe's backyard, then the 
United States expects Europe, the economic great power, to clear 
things up. Washington will watch, but in contrast to the past, 
it no longer wants to organize everything unilaterally. The 
heaviest burden is now on Europe's shoulders. Partly as a 
result of the changed world situation and the end of the 
partition of Europe, the Union now has to deal with it. Up to 
now it has not proved capable of doing so. As long as the 
Maastricht Treaty had not been ratified, it could still be 
argued that the Union did not have the instruments to conduct 
efficient foreign policies. In the meantime it has been 
possible to observe empirically that this explanation does not 
hold true. Maastricht is now operational, and the indecision was 
not reduced but has, on the contrary, increased. 
  For the United States, and the United Kingdom too, the 
Balkans remain an insignificant piece of land of little 
strategic importance. The area contains no useful raw materials 
and does not lie on the major sea lanes. Therefore its 
importance is very relative. Continental Europe should know 
better. For centuries the Balkans have been the continent's 
weak underbelly and if there is grumbling there, the entire 
European Constitution is undermined. That was once again proved 
at the start of this century when a Serbian nationalist's 
bullets caused the start of World War One. Nevertheless, the 
European leaders have assessed the disintegration of Yugoslavia 
wrongly, and above all they have underestimated it. It was 
catalogued as a regional conflict which did require some 
attention but did not in the least require inclusion in 
"intensive care." Wasn't it Marx who said that history never 
repeated itself, unless as a caricature? Therefore Sarajevo 
could never start a new world war. The end of the Soviet Union 
and the unanimity in the Security Council were other good 
reasons to not take the events in Bosnia too dramatically. This 
time the fire could not threaten the neighboring properties. 
  This view remains, although little is left of the 
self-assurance of two years ago. "There is a very real risk of 
the conflict spreading, of so-called internationalization," 
Claes said. In recent days that risk has increased strongly. 
The prime ministers of Turkey and Pakistan are shortly to visit 
Bosnia, where there is something like an Islamic International. 
The fact that the Muslims are now better armed and able to 
adopt a more offensive attitude than a few months ago is not 
unrelated to this. And Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and the Russian 
nationalists have rediscovered the Serbs and will not permit any 
air strikes against their traditional ally. Daily the conflict 
is becoming less local, and more and more foreign powers are 
starting to get actively involved. Europe itself is not capable 
of making a coherent initiative. If the Germans, British, and 
French are not on different wave lengths, they are emphasizing 
different things. In any event that is the case with the 
present holder of the European presidency, Greece. Long before 
the European Union existed, this country chose its camp. Like 
the Russians, they are unconditionally on the side of the Serbs. 
Then, there is the question which General Briquemont formulated 
so urgently. "How is it possible that Europe, with 300 million 
inhabitants, is not capable of sending 40,000 troops to Bosnia?" 
According to Briquemont the move is absolutely necessary, in so 
far as the logic of peace and negotiations is followed. 
Briquemont left Sarajevo because his question was not answered. 
And the longer the United Nations and Europe continue to leave 
Briquemont's question unanswered, the greater the chance becomes 
that this Balkan conflict will in the end also become 
unmanageable.

<F P=106> [Paul Vallely report: "Why They're Taking So Long To Answer"] </F>
  [Text] The man reeled off his former prison number by way 
of introduction. But the smirks this provoked among the IRA 
supporters around the room soon disappeared when he began to 
speak. Why should Protestants trust the republican movement, he 
asked, unless the IRA did something to show it was worthy of 
that trust? 
  It was an extraordinary occasion. Inside the Londonderry 
Guildhall -- a monument of Ulster Protestantism with its marble 
staircases stained glass windows and ornate stone tracery -- a 
group of IRA sympathisers had gathered to debate, in public, 
whether the organisation should carry on killing or not. 
  It is now six weeks since the British and Irish prime 
ministers signed the Downing Street declaration and still there 
has been no response from Sinn Fein, the political alter ego of 
the IRA. Instead they have called four public meetings -- the 
first of which was held in Londonderry last week -- to listen to 
the views of the ordinary people of the province. 
  For seven hours, they came forward, one after another, to 
speak. There were the hardliners with their wellworn talk of 
"Unionist hegemony" and the "British ruling class." There was 
the group from the Derry Peace and Reconciliation Center who 
challenged the IRA to end the violence at once. There was a 
distinguished surgeon who spoke of the anguish of operating on 
victims of violence, of whatever denomination. There was a 
Protestant man who came in on the spur of the moment to tell the 
apologists for violence that the IRA were cowards who hid behind 
masks. 
  The panel of Sinn Fein officials who sat and listened had 
heard all that before. But they were also hearing something new 
-- the voices of former terrorists, supporters and sympathisers 
who were now telling them to put down the guns and begin to talk. 
  Their submissions began from the same position as the IRA. 
They displayed deep distrust of the British. They complained 
of continued harassment of Catholics by the security forces. 
They pointed to inconsistencies in the declaration. And yet at 
the end they pronounced that accepting the declaration as a 
starting point from which to negotiate was a gamble. But it was 
a gamble, they said, which the IRA now had to take. 
  Many outsiders are convinced that the IRA has no intention 
of 
calling off the shooting and bombing; meetings such as this are 
deliberately dragging out the process to avoid accusations of 
rejecting the peace plan out of hand. As the furious reaction 
to Adams' U.S. visit has shown, few in Britain believe that he 
is sincere in seeking peace. However, on the ground things 
looks rather different. 
  Conversations over several days with republicans in IRA 
strongholds in Derry, Belfast and South Armagh revealed that an 
intense debate is now being conducted among the IRA's 
support-base. It is being driven by Gerry Adams and others in 
the movement's leadership. Now middle-aged, they have become 
more reflective. They are said to see no prospect of victory and 
fear that their grown-up children will now be sucked into more 
years of futile struggle. 
  In republican circles in Derry, the talk is that Adams has 
made considerable headway in persuading IRA members there. Such 
talk could simply be the work of the IRA's propaganda machine, 
but the behaviour of senior republican figures seems to confirm 
it. The most influential republican in the city, Martin 
McGuinness, sat silently throughout the meeting last Friday [28 
January] but pointedly rose to congratulate two speakers who 
concluded that now was the time to end the violence. 
  But the argument cannot be decided in a single city. The IRA 
is not a homogeneous organisation. Nor is the overlap between 
the IRA and Sinn Fein as exact as is often supposed. Support 
for Adams varies from place to place. There is much more in 
Derry -- where the IRA is more structured, better educated and 
more political -- than in Belfast -- where it is more 
fragmented, more violent and more reactive to loyalist 
paramilitary activity. Adams also has more support in urban 
areas -- where Sinn Fein councillors are recognised as effective 
community politicians who get things done -- than in rural areas 
where nationalism is more instinctive and romanticised. 
  As one staunch republican in what's known as the bandit 
country of South Armagh remarked: "If Adams can't swing them in 
Derry, what hope has he got here, or in East Tyrone or South 
Fermanagh." 
  The SDLP [Social Democratic and Labor Party] MP for the 
area, 
Seamus Mallon, said: "Anyone who thought that persuading Gerry 
Adams was the end of the process clearly doesn't understand much 
about how things really are here." 
  South Armagh is a place where even the locals are wary about 
using backroads after dark and where, on the housing estates of 
Newry, the residents are as likely to turn to the paramilitaries 
as to the police to address the behaviour of local criminals. 
Yet even here "a substantial number of Sinn Fein voters want to 
accept the declaration as the starting point," as one local put 
it. 
  Throughout the province, insiders estimate, somewhere 
between 
50 and 70 percent of IRA supporters now want the violence to 
stop. Gerry Adams knows that is not enough. He has to persuade 
more -- those for whom the presence of the British Army 
constitutes a daily provocation, those bitter from the death of 
relatives who cannot accept that they might have "died in vain," 
and those for whom terrorism has become a career and who would 
have difficulty in finding an ordinary job which would give them 
the same status. 
  Adams needs 90 or 95 percent support if he is to avoid a 
split. But the history of Irish republicanism is a history of 
splits in which its members have repeatedly turned their guns on 
one another. He knows he would be Target Number One for any 
breakaway hardliners. 
  He knows, too, how easily a small dissident group could 
scupper Sinn Fein's role in future talks: because of the 
cellular structure of the IRA, its average unit, security 
sources estimate, has immediate access to two handguns, four 
Armalite rifles, 6,000 rounds of ammunition, and 15 pounds of 
Semtex explosive. As one security source said: "With that lot, 
a single unit can do a lot of damage to any peace process." 
  Splits are inevitable, the security forces believe. "But if 
Adams can keep the breakaway faction small enough, then the 
security forces in the South or the North will be able to mop up 
the opposition," the source said. 
  "The key factor is to get the violence to stop for long 
enough so that the Sinn Fein people become engaged in the 
political process in such a way that they do not feel that going 
back to violence would be productive," said a Dublin official. 
  Already the Irish Government is trying to begin this process 
of involvement. It recently revoked its 22-year ban on Sinn 
Fein members appearing on TV and radio. It is also the reason 
for their not opposing Gerry Adams' application for a U.S. visa. 
  "We have to make an act of faith in Adams and enhance his 
authority in the hope that he will use that extra authority 
well," said one senior member of the Dublin government. "We 
have to give him until the end of February to turn gentle 
persuasion into the exercise of internal authority. Sinn Fein 
will use that time and opportunity to make themselves 
politically respectable. That is galling to a lot of people on 
both sides of the border but we have to take the risk."

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
underlined the importance of economic relations between Germany 
and India. Kohl said today at the start of a German-Indian 
economic conference at the Bonn Chancellery, in the presence of 
Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narisimha Rao, that this conference 
underlined the "special importance" that the German Government 
attached to relations between the two countries. 
  Rao arrived in Germany for a two-day visit to Bonn on 2 
February. Kohl welcomed the prime minister with military honors 
this morning at the Chancellery. Afterward they met for talks. 
Rao is also to visit Berlin on the 4th and 5th February. 
  At the economic conference, the chancellor said that 
relations between Germany and India in the science and 
technology areas had always been very close and are 
characterized by cooperation in a spirit of trust on many 
projects. Kohl announced that it was agreed today to set up a 
high-level German-Indian Commission for Science and Technology. 
Mutual economic relations had developed "gratifyingly" in the 
past few years. Today, Germany was India's second most 
important supplier and fourth most important market. German 
investments in India were "considerable, but could still 
increase." 
  Rao welcomed German industry's Asian offensive. This project 
was appropriate to the positive economic developments in Asia, 
he said. 
  The economic conference, the climax of Rao's visit, was 
opened by Siemens head Heinrich von Pierer, the chairman of the 
Asia-Pacific Association of German industry. A large number of 
Indian and German business representatives took part in the 
conference. [passage omitted]

in Bosnia, where he will visit two of the four detachments 
belonging to the Spanish contingent in the area. Tomorrow in 
Zagreb, he will meet the representative of the UN secretary 
general in former Yugoslavia. A few minutes before leaving 
Javier Solana stated that our country will reconsider the 
presence of Spanish soldiers in Bosnia at the end of the winter. 
  [Begin Solana recording] Maybe when winter ends we will have 
to do a detailed analysis of the situation; we will do it with 
our colleagues, with the countries that also have troops in the

  [Text] The European Union [EU] Commission this evening in 
Brussels decided to appoint French Diplomat Serge Abu as EU 
observer in the Cyprus talks. The Cyprus New Agency reports 
that an official statement on Abu's appointment will be issued 
Monday [7 February] by EU Commissioner on Foreign Policy Hans 
van den Broek during the EU Council of Ministers' meeting. 
  Speaking to correspondents following a meeting with Foreign 
Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis in Brussels today, van den Broek 
noted that the observer, as an employee of the EU, will brief 
the relevant commissioners directly with special reports and 
follow the developments in the negotiations. He said the EU 
Commission will have a credible and responsible witness if it 
ever wants a briefing. He added that Turkey accepts the observer 
because he will only observe not participate the negotiations. 
Mr. van den Broek expressed the conviction that Turkey will 
cooperate in the promotion of the confidence-building measures. 
  Furthermore, van den Broek said after his meeting with 
Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis that Cyprus' membership in the EU 
will definitely take place but it is a matter of time. We 
proceed very well and have good cooperation in the economic and 
technical fields, said the commissioner. However, he added, we 
cannot underestimate the political difficulties and obstacles 
that must be overcome. Responding to a question on whether if 
progress is made on the Cyprus talks the country's application 
for membership will be discussed earlier than 1995, the 
commissioner said that any positive development will be 
seriously considered. However, he said he believes that the 
political problems that must first be resolved are many and 
serious, and that is why the January 1995 date remains. Our 
efforts toward a solution to the Cyprus problem will continue, 
he concluded, so that by January 1995 the dialogue will have 
progressed with the achievement of significant steps. 
  In Brussels, Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis also met EU 
Commissioner on Foreign Economic Trade Sir Leon Brittan. 
Mikhailidhis asked the EU commissioner for the improvement and 
expansion of the terms of the association agreement between the 
EU and Cyprus beyond the fields defined by the agreement. Our 
correspondent reports that Mikhailidhis asked for the dispatch 
of EU experts to contribute to a better harmonization of the 
Cyprus legislation with that of the EU. Mikhailidhis described 
his two meetings, with van den Broek and Brittan, as substantial 
and added that they took place in a very positive atmosphere. 
  Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis left Brussels for London, 
where 
he will meet with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prosperity Party Leader Necmettin Erbakan by </F>
Mehmet Ali Birand and Can Dundar in the studio on the "Cross 
Fire" program; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Begin recording] [Birand] You recently 
started to make inconceivable changes in your party. New names 
from various sectors are joining it. Is this real change or is 
it just for show? 
  [Erbakan] This is called development. While on its way to 
becoming the party that will come to power on its own, and since 
its basic principle is to embrace the 60 million people in this 
country without discrimination and to bring them happiness, this 
embrace is beginning to cover all the sectors of the nation. 
Not only do we embrace them, but we include them in our party 
and work together. 
  Our main principle remains the same: While the other, 
West-imitating parties hold force to be supreme, just as the 
West does, we hold God to be supreme. Those who join us, 
therefore, believe in this principle. 
  [Dundar] Yet some of the people who join your party have 
nothing to do with God. It is as if they are doing this for 
publicity purposes. 
  [Erbakan] The door to repentance is always open. Every 
person can make mistakes; however, every person has enough 
common sense to see God. [passage omitted] 
  [Dundar] Former U.S. Ambassador in Ankara Abrahamowitz 
recently said that the Prosperity Party [PP] could come to power 
if it were led by a younger, more moderate leader. As you know, 
when the United States speaks about something, it usually turns 
out to be not so auspicious. [laughs] How do you feel about 
that? 
  [Erbakan] You know what Ali Pasha used to say: If he wanted 
to find out the truth, he would go ask the Russian ambassador. 
The truth would be exactly the opposite of what the ambassador 
said. Now the world has changed. It is not Russia but the 
United States that is filling this role. So that is how we 
should relate to this. [laughs] 
  [Birand] The most important thing on Turkey's agenda is the 
southeast. Your approach to the Kurdish problem differs from 
the other parties. You are more moderate. You are not opposed 
to the use of the Kurdish language, for example. Your campaign 
is: Either the PP or terrorism in the southeast. Democratic 
Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit is critical of your policy 
regarding this issue. 
  [Erbakan] The PP and the southeast -- that is an important 
issue. Ecevit is not important. Let us put him aside. All the 
parties are trying to discredit the PP today. Ecevit harps on 
this issue. He has published certain things which were found in 
his party offices. We are suing him. The PP is the party that 
strives for the happiness of the 60 million people in this 
country -- in fact, of 6 billion people. Approximately 60 
million brothers live in this country. We have lived as 
brothers -- in fact, as one body -- for 1,400 years. The 
country reached its current situation as a result of the wrong 
policies of the West-imitating parties. [passage omitted] 
  [Birand] You are saying that you have a different policy 
toward the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. 
  [Erbakan] We do not have a policy toward the PKK. The PKK 
is not important to us. There are 60 million people in this 
country. We want to bring all of them peace, freedom, 
prosperity, dignity, and self-respect. To achieve this, we must 
first stop being the satellites of foreign forces. It is 
impossible to have Poised Hammer imposed on us on one hand and 
to prevent terrorism on the other. 
  [Birand] You mean you will first get rid of Poised Hammer? 
  [Erbakan] Of course. We will send it back where it came 
from. Are we a colony? What is this? What is a foreign power 
doing in our land? Then, of course, we will lift the embargo 
against brotherly Iraq. Why should we continue to paralyze the 
economy of southeastern Anatolia? All these things, of course, 
are details. Our real mission is to give the 60 million people 
in this country a sense of love and brotherhood. 
  [Birand] All this is very abstract. 
  [Erbakan] That is not true. When a Muslim from Turkey who 
goes on Haj meets a Muslim from Uganda, he feels an affinity and 
a sympathy for him. The Muslim religion is such a tie. We have 
lived with this tie for 1,400 years. If you break this tie, the 
real tie, then foreign forces can divide you easily. That is 
why the tie of religion should never be neglected; its 
development should not be prevented; it should be encouraged, 
even revived. Faith is the strongest tie that connects a 
country to itself. 
  [Birand] I want to go back to a previous question. You say 
either the PP or terrorism in the southeast. Also, only the PP 
can work and produce candidates in the southeast, none of the 
other parties can. How is this possible? 
  [Erbakan] The PP used to be the strongest party in the 
southeast before the terrorist incidents flared up. Now, the PP 
is stronger in the whole country. From being the largest party 
it is moving toward becoming the only party. The same situation 
is also true in the southeast. Our brothers in the southeast 
can also see the reality. They all want to be our citizens, and 
for the country to be united. Being a citizen of a dignified 60 
million strong Turkey will bring happiness to everyone. They 
have things they complain about: They claim that they have been 
treated as second class citizens, that their economic 
development has been neglected, and that their human rights have 
not been recognized. Their human rights should have been 
recognized. 
  [Birand] What about the PKK? 
  [Erbakan] The PKK is a tool of outside forces. Outside 
forces are using it to create trouble in the area. The PKK is 
merely a tool of exclusively Western forces. 
  [Birand] Why does it not hurt the PP then? 
  [Erbakan] The PKK declared us its greatest enemy. 
  [Birand] Of course, but it is not doing anything to your 
candidates. 
  [Erbakan] The people there love us. The people are with us. 
The PP is therefore open and can announce its candidates. The 
PKK is afraid of the people and is trying to bring the people to 
its side against the government. However, the people are on our 
side. 
  [Dundar] There is also Hizbullah. It is also based on 
religious faith. How do you view that organization? 
  [Erbakan] Some stories are being concocted. Nobody knows 
the truth behind this organization. The way we view it is that 
certain elements create trouble among our people in the 
southeast. As you know, we want peace, brotherhood, peace of 
mind, unity, and solidarity. 
  [Dundar] Is it possible that the Hizbullah is a continuation 
of the (gladio)? 
  [Erbakan] It is possible, because certain very suspicious 
persons are among them. It is unbelieve the things that happen 
there. As you know, we have many deputies in the southeast, and 
a PP southeastern committee. We study the developments in the 
region in great detail. Certain unbelievable things are 
happening there. Certain CIA agents and provocateurs go there 
and do certain things, sometimes even under the guise of the 
state, and cause the people to move away from the state. The 
agents of all the foreign forces.... [pauses] Didn't the former 
governor of the state of emergency region say that the place is 
full of CIA agents? 
  [Birand] What is the conclusion we should be drawing from 
your statements? You are saying that you do not like the 
approach of the current government to the southeast problem. Is 
that what you mean? Mainly the security issue is being dealt 
with. 
  [Erbakan] They know nothing but violence. This is the first 
issue. Secondly, there is the issue of materialism. They claim 
to be brothers but the foundations of this brotherhood do not 
exist. They are only paying lip service. 
  [Birand] When you come to power.... 
  [Erbakan, interrupting] When we come to power all the 
citizens in Turkey will actually feel the bonds of brotherhood. 
We are the symbol of brotherhood. 
  [Birand] Will the PKK feel these bonds of brotherhood as 
well? 
  [Erbakan] The PKK is an outside factor. The actual factor 
is the people and the people are with us. We will definitely 
wage a much more effective struggle against those who come and 
kill our innocent children of this region. When we come to 
power, however, they will not be able to base themselves in the 
region and they will disappear. 
  [Dundar] You are trying to say that you will be replacing 
the Turkish-Kurdish conflict with Islamic unity. 
  [Erbakan] We will have bonds of brotherhood. There is 
nothing more absurd than ethnic differentiation among Muslim 
brothers. 
  [Birand] In the past you would not visit the Ataturk 
Mausoleum. You, especially your party, would not refer to 
Ataturk. Now you claim that were Ataturk alive he would prefer 
your party. What has changed? 
  [Erbakan] Now the parties that imitate the West are only 
exploiting Ataturk. We are only disarming them. None of these 
parties actually abide by the principles of Ataturk. We have 
pointed this out repeatedly. Let us have a look at the first 
years of the republic. Were we trying to borrow from other 
countries or were we more interested in being self reliant and 
building our own industry? What is this? This is the national 
view. It is the PP program. Did we go and beg the West or did 
we pursue a dignified foreign policy? In other words, the PP 
policies were carefully applied during the first years of the 
republic. Only afterwards did the imitators of the West come on 
the scene and degenerate everything. Now they are knocking on 
the doors of the West and begging. [passage omitted] 
  Now let us discuss the issue of laicism. There cannot be an 
Ataturkist laicism or any other kind of laicism based on someone 
else's views. This is a foreign word. We have always said 
that. There is an unprecedented contradiction in our current 
constitution. On the one hand it states that the official 
language is Turkish and on the other it has foreign words. We 
should be suspicious of it. What is the intention of those who 
want to preserve this? Now let us leave the issue of intention 
aside and let us deal with the scientific aspect. There are 
close to 200 countries in the world. We have analyzed the 
constitutions of all these countries and have presented a paper 
on the issue to the Assembly chairman. Only two of these 
countries use the word laicism in their constitutions, namely 
France and Turkey. No other country uses this word. More than 
half of these countries state their official religion in their 
constitutions. For example, the British constitution states 
that the official religion is the Anglican Church. [passage 
omitted] All countries do that with the exception of Turkey. 
Laicism is based on three fundamental principles. The first 
one is that there is the freedom of belief. The second one 
states that one cannot resort to force to impose his beliefs on 
others. There should be tolerance and views should be expressed 
in an atmosphere of tranquillity. The third principle notes 
that the church administration will not interfere with the state 
administration. This is a reaction to the Middle Ages when the 
church remained in power for a long time in Western countries. 
It is stated that the church administration will not interfere 
in the state administration and vice versa. This is a delicate 
differentiation. It does not say that religion and the state 
are separate. [passage omitted] 
  [Birand] There has been a very interesting development. 
There has been a rapprochement between the PP and the Alawites. 
You have even had contacts with Prof. Izzettin Dogan. There has 
been talk of cooperation, mutual support in various 
municipalities. The Alawites have reacted to this cooperation. 
The Sivas incidents have not yet been forgotten. Can you 
explain this rapprochement? How far will it go? 
  [Erbakan] Let me first refer to the Sivas incidents. Those 
incidents were the ploy of foreign forces aimed at creating an 
Alawite-Sunni conflict. [passage omitted] Our Alawite brothers 
are Muslims. We believe in the same God, the same Prophet and 
the Koran. Sectarian differences are just details. We should, 
therefore, not become the tools of foreign forces in their 
efforts to create an Alawite-Sunni rift. The PP is against the 
Turkish-Kurdish rift. The PP has the ideology to create the 
bonds of brotherhood among our 60 million citizens. It also has 
the ideology to eliminate the Alawite-Sunni rift. 
  [Dundar] What kind of a cooperation is being envisaged? 
  [Erbakan] In a symbolic ceremony held last week, we accepted 
200 Alawite brothers as members of our party. Certain persons 
with ulterior motives have been waging this propaganda for years 
now. Now our Alawite citizens are asking themselves. They are 
saying: We have, for years, been voting for the SDPP [Social 
Democratic Populist Party]. What have we achieved? Are we still 
not hungry? Are we not oppressed? Having seen these realities 
they now see salvation in the PP just as the 60 million citizens 
of our country. 
  [Dundar] How will you cooperate? 
  [Erbakan] No doubt, in regions where there is a large 
Alawite population we will ask them who they want to nominate 
for the municipal elections. We will ask them to nominate their 
own candidates. Of course, the work to be carried out will be 
in line with our principles. What does this mean? It means the 
equal treatment of all. It means the recognition of human 
rights for everyone. 
  [Birand] So long as they abide by your principles. 
  [Erbakan] They are not our principles alone they are the 
principles of all humanity. We do not have special principles. 
As I stated earlier, we advocate equal treatment of all, bonds 
of brotherhood for all. 
  [Dundar] In an interview with a daily you were quoted as 
saying that it is not difficult to come to power but that what 
frightens you is to come to power and be impotent. What do you 
mean by that? 
  [Erbakan] There are many institutes of strategy in the 
United States. These institutes conduct research in line with 
their own basic plans. Many people we know there send us 
reports on this research. They say that most of the institutes 
there regret their research. In other words, they brought about 
revolutions in certain Muslim countries and these revolutions 
have not brought any happiness to the people. They had to foot 
the bill for these revolutions. One can cite Algeria. The 
revolutions in Turkey were also greatly influenced by them. It 
is not important whether those who made the revolutions are 
aware of it. 
  [Dundar] You are saying that they were used? 
  [Erbakan] Of course, they were used. We have repeatedly 
stated this. They are the directors. They prepare the ground 
and then they push the button. Those who make the revolutions 
are not aware of what they are doing. None of the problems are 
solved. Realizing this U.S. interference and involvement the 
people become furious. This has been confirmed. Now they 
propose to do it differently. They propose not to interfere in 
the elections. Let the people elect whomever they choose. If 
the elected administration does not suit them, if it does not 
fit in with their exploitation and world supremacy, if an 
administration favoring equality, independence, peace, 
tranquility, and justice instead of force is elected then they 
will try and render that administration unsuccessful. 
  [Dundar] Then they are no longer in favor of coups. 
  [Erbakan] That is true. They prefer to cause that 
administration to fail. 
  [Birand] That is not what they did in Algeria. 
  [Erbakan] And what happened there? There is no 
tranquillity. Algeria will revert to its former situation. They 
realize that this is not a solution. Now they are trying to 
devise new methods. I would like to refer to an important 
point. I allocated a significant section to this point in our 
party congress. They might think that the PP will come to 
power. I am sure that when we come to power they will be 
revising their policies. Why? Because the PP is not against 
anyone. We are not prejudiced against any country. We want 
happiness for the 6 billion people of this world. We want good 
relations with everyone. We will be establishing these good 
ties. For example, the United States will change its stand 
towards Turkey. How will it change? Instead of giving orders 
over the phone it will show us the respect befitting a country 
that is the leader and nucleus of the new world. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD (ADB): "World's First Mine Warfare </F>
Simulator"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Excerpts] Ostend, 3 Feb (BELGA) -- On Thursday [3 
February], the Belgian-Dutch school of mine warfare based in 
Ostend put into commission a powerful simulator that naval 
officials say is the only one of its kind in the world. 
  This military school, which is renowned throughout the world 
for its marine mine warfare training, can now use a computer to 
simulate the maneuvers of a whole fleet. [passage omitted] 
  Belgian and Dutch naval officials proudly explained on 
Thursday: "With all its possibilities and its exceptional 
performance, this simulator is the only one of its kind in NATO, 
and indeed in the world. The ships and different types of 
sensors and weapons systems can all be simulated by the computer 
database, and the consoles are of a universal type. It will 
even be able to accurately simulate future NATO systems in a 
very realistic environment." 
  Officers from both countries participated in the design of 
this new tool, developed by the American company CAE Link which 
specializes in simulation. 
  The construction of the simulator launched on Thursday was 
financed by NATO, in return for which the allied navies can hire 
the system to train their own crews. [passage omitted] 
  The simulator can also display on screen the image, in fact 
the "virtual reality," sent back by the camera on a 
minisubmarine sent out to hunt for mines on the sea bed. 
[passage omitted] 
  This system also makes it possible for crews to discover 
potential new operations areas. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed RAY/RHR: "Claes Pleads for Defense Within </F>
European Union"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] London, 2 Feb (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes said Wednesday [2 February] in London that all the 
conditions had been met for the European Union to talk about 
defense and for the Western European Union (WEU) to establish a 
peace force. 
  In reference to the creation of a common foreign and 
security 
policy, Mr. Claes, who was invited to the Chatham House 
conferences organized by the Royal Institute of International 
Affairs, said that a defense element should be included in such 
a policy: "Primarily by creating a common peacekeeping policy," 
said Mr. Claes during his speech entitled "Europe: An 
Unfinished Symphony." 
  "All the conditions have been met, especially with the 
relevant agreement at the last NATO summit. The Union can now 
talk about defense, the WEU can put together a peacekeeping 
force, and the costs can be allocated via the Union budget," 
explained the Belgian foreign minister. 
  In another reference to the common foreign and security 
policy, Mr. Claes said that this policy would require an 
apparatus making it possible to correctly prepare and apply 
decisions, for example a central planning unit with the European 
Commission and the secretariat of the EC Council of Ministers. 
  Speaking to the British, whose government is hesitant about 
setting up the common foreign and security policy, since, 
according to it, such a move would result in the loss of 
national sovereignty, Mr. Claes said that the common foreign and 
security policy should be transformed in coming years into a 
genuine political instrument, "thanks, in part, to the British 
contribution."

<F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Poland Prepares Itself for Accession </F>
to European Union"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 3 Feb (BELGA) -- Poland must become a 
member of NATO as soon as possible, said German Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe at an international conference on Poland held in 
Brussels. The conference was organized by the Washington-based 
Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
  "In the wake of the recent successful NATO summit, the 
Alliance must follow a magnanimous strategy of integration and 
cooperation. The NATO summit set in motion an irreversible 
process aimed at reorganizing European security," continued the 
defense minister. In his opinion, for historical reasons Poland 
is strongly pushing for accession to all Western institutions. 
  "Germany's neighbors in the East need a political shield 
that 
offers them security and stability. Germany fully supports the 
integration process," said Ruehe.

  [Text] As indicated in EUROPE of 19 January, page 7, the 
negotiations between the EC and Russia on the partnership and 
cooperation agreement resumed on Wednesday [2 February] in 
Brussels at the level of senior officials (the talks are 
expected to end on Thursday evening). The Community delegation 
is led by Mr. Benavides (DG I, External Relations) and the 
Russian delegation is led by Mr. Ivanov (Vice-President of the 
Russian Agency for International Cooperation). After a month 
and a half of reduced activities for reasons both political 
(government reshuffling in Russia after the December elections, 
time for reflection by the Twelve on the results of the talks 
obtained at the time of President Yeltsin's visit to Brussels on 
9 December) and substantive (compromise solutions for the 
outstanding problems were to be examined by both sides), on 
Wednesday and Thursday the EC and Russian negotiators are 
essentially examining the three principal outstanding problems, 
namely: 

  -  The nuclear sector, especially rules and provisions 
governing trade in enriched uranium between the EC and 
Russia; 
  -  The opening of the Russian banking sector to foreign 
banks. Russia insists on transitional limited access to its 
financial market, but apparently could be satisfied with a sort 
of "voluntary limitation" by the EC; 
  -  Maritime transport.

between the EC and Syria (which had remained deadlocked for a 
long time because Parliament was demanding certain assurances on 
the situation in this country), a European Commission delegation 
has made a trip to Damascus to prepare implementation of the 
protocol. Led by Eberhardt Rhein, the delegation met the prime 
minister and several ministers who will be concerned by the use 
of the protocol funding. 
  According to available information, out of 190 million 
dollars, 140 million will be spent on infrastructures 
(electricity, water, roads and irrigation) and 50 million on 
projects in the areas of trade, tourism, training and the 
promotion of investment. The delegation will next report to 
Jordan.

<F P=106> [Andrew Marshall report: "Taxpayers Lose Millions to Tobacco </F>
Fraudsters"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Massive fraud, maladministration and 
ill-conceived policies have cost the European Union [EU] 
hundreds of millions of pounds in its efforts to subsidise 
tobacco production, a report from its financial watchdog says. 
The damning report from the EU's Court of Auditors follows five 
years of investigation by Terry Wynn, the Labour Merseyside East 
MEP [Member of European Parliament]. "It's an indictment of not 
just the tobacco sector but the whole Common Agricultural 
Policy," said Mr Wynn yesterday. 
  "The report is everything that I have asked for," he said. 
But he demanded action yesterday fom both the European 
Commission and national governments. "This is a total misuse of 
public funds," he said. Nearly all of the EU's 180,000 tobacco 
growers live in Spain, Italy and Greece. The cost of propping 
up the sector was 1.274bn ecus (1bn pounds) last year. The 
report notes that changes have been made to policy, but says 
that huge and in many cases unnecessary costs will continue. It 
blames the European Commission and member states alike. 
  The most serious allegation in the report concerns the 
fraudulent manipulation of the market with the assistance of a 
Commission official who later committed suicide, and inadequate 
attempts by the Commission to get to the bottom of the affair. 
"In 1990, the Commission carried out an internal inquiry into 
the management of the tobacco division," the report notes. 
"During the inquiry the Commission received allegations that a 
cartel had existed and been aided by the head of division.... 
The report itself indicates that the possible loss over an 
eight-year period could have been as high as ECU 40 million." 
  During the 1989-90 period one Italian company and one Greek 
company accounted for about half of all the tobacco sold off 
from EU stocks. The Commission launched a disciplinary action 
against the head of division. But, it notes, "no action has 
been taken to carry out adequate inquiries into the allegations 
of a cartel and the consequences for the Community budget." It 
adds: "There was no evidence of action on the part of the 
Commission or a member state to bring suspected wrongdoers to 
justice." The Commission maintains that the investigation is 
ongoing, even though the official killed himself last year. 
  The Court of Auditors says that it found the Commission "not 
as forthcoming as it should have been" over this affair. And it 
makes further requests for "a copy of a contract with a company, 
connected with a retired Commission official, which conducted 
(the investigation) and for details of payments made thereunder." 
  Large quantities of tobacco were exported at very low prices 
from Italy, Spain and Greece with the aid of EU subsidies. In 
many cases the tobacco was worthless and simply sent abroad to 
claim the cash, mainly to Hungary, Russia and Albania. "The 
tobacco had no real commercial value and the exporter's profit 
from such operations was almost entirely derived from the export 
refund," the report says. A separate investigation is going on 
into what appears to be a massive case of fraud involving 
exports to Albania, Mr Wynn said yesterday, sparked by his 
inquiries. "Exports from Italy to Albania amounted to 25,906 
tonnes in 1990 but 23,087 tonnes or 89 per cent did not reach 
its destination," the report says, with a lOm ecus cost to the 
EU. Fraudulent exports from Greece to Albania cost another 
23.4m ecus. 
  The report says that a large proportion of the EU's 
resources 
were spent subsidising tobacco for which there is little or no 
demand. For two varieties which "hardly had a market" 
overproduction was estimated at 215,000 tonnes in 1987-92. 
Altogether the EU spent more than 800m ecus on "problem 
varieties." 
  The result of the EU schemes was to make tobacco production 
far more profitable than it should have been in proportion to 
the amount of land involved. "The net income (per hectare) was 
more than three times as high as as the average net income...for 
all types of farms in the same member states," the report says. 
The level of EU support was 23 times higher than that for 
cereals, for instance. The Court of Auditors calculates that if 
the EU had handed over the equivalent of the income that tobacco 
farmers get in cash, rather than managing the market, the cost 
would be halved.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Mostly Wise on Open Skies"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday's report on the European airline 
industry by a committee of "wise men" makes many good points. 
The committee set up to advise the European Commission, rightly 
points out that the industry's financial crisis is due to poor 
productivity as well as the recession. And it argues that the 
Commission should press ahead with its open skies policy which 
aims to create a competitive market, despite pressure from some 
flagcarriers and their governments to reverse it. 
  Competition is necessary if flag carriers are to improve 
their productivity. So long as they are able to huddle behind 
monopolistic barriers receiving drip-feeds of state aid, they 
will have little incentive to cut costs and restructure. 
Without a competitive market, Europe's passengers will also 
continue to suffer from fares which are higher than prices on 
comparable routes in the U.S. 
  The wise men also make useful points about airport slots and 
bottlenecks in the skies. If competitors continue to have 
difficulty gaining access to take-off and landing slots, last 
year's liberalisation of the market will come to little. Equally 
damaging are the region's antiquated and fragmented air traffic 
control systems. 
  So far so good. The snag is that the wise men spoil their 
overall report by reluctantly agreeing that further state 
handouts to financially troubled flag-carriers will be 
necessary. This is despite their argument that state aid 
distorts competition and that governments should not intervene 
for non-commercial reasons in airline operations. 
  The risk of even such a reluctant endorsement of aid is that 
it could open the floodgates to new airline subsidies. The 
Commission, which is responsible for policing handouts, is 
already investigating cases involving Air France and Portugal's 
TAP. Greece's Olympic, Italy's Alitalia and Spain's Iberia 
could also be in line. 
<H5>  Further Disrepute </H5>
  A new raft of airline subsidies would undermine the 
Commission's open skies policy, as unaided rivals would not be 
willing to compete with aided flag-carriers. It would also 
bring Europe's single market, which was badly damaged by the 
Commission's approval of Ecu7 billion in handouts to steel 
companies last December, into further disrepute. If efficient 
private enterprises find the playing field tilted against them, 
they will ask whether there is much point in a single market. 
  The wise men recognise this danger and try to guard against 
it by proposing tough conditions for new subsidies. They say 
this should be the last time airlines receive aid and that it 
should be allowed only as part of restructuring plans which 
ultimately lead to privatisation. The committee also wants the 
Commission to hire independent analysts to investigate aid cases 
and then publish their reports. 
<H5>  Best Guarantee </H5>
  Such conditions which many flag-carriers will consider 
excessively harsh are certainly better than no conditions. 
Privatisation would provide the best guarantee that aid was 
provided on a last chance basis. Meanwhile, publication of 
independent reports would be a welcome step towards greater 
transparency. In the past, there have been concerns that the 
Commission, working behind closed doors, has approved hand-outs 
by wrongly categorising them as rational investments. 
  But non-aided airlines will ask why the flag-carriers 
deserve 
a last chance. The reason, according to the wise men, is that 
without aid flag-carriers could go bankrupt and that would not 
be politically acceptable. 
  This argument is too defeatist. The banning of aid could be 
just what is needed to spur airlines into speedy restructuring 
programmes -- cutting staff, withdrawing from unprofitable 
routes and disposing of peripheral activities. With radical 
programmes in place, there would be no need for aid, as 
financial injections could probably be justified on normal 
investment criteria. 
  If the Commission was not willing to oppose aid, it would 
arguably be in dereliction of its duty under the Treaty of Rome. 
This outlaws subsidies except in narrowly defined circumstances. 
Liberal-minded member states should then consider taking legal 
action to enforce a tougher line.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "OECD 1994 Economic Survey on Belgium </F>
and Luxembourg -- The OECD recommends that Belgium consolidate 
its public finances and that Luxembourg introduce more 
flexibility in public spending"; as released by Brussels 
TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] In its 1994 economic surveys on Belgium and 
Luxembourg, the OECD concludes that a major reform of the 
socio-economic setting is indispensable in Belgium. This reform 
must have the objective of giving more flexibility to the wage 
formation process in order to reduce labor costs and preserve 
competitiveness without large job losses and to proceed with 
overdue structural reforms in social security to put fiscal 
consolidation permanently back on course. After noting that 
Belgium's short-term economic prospects are bleak and that the 
country is faced with difficult choices, the OECD observes that 
one of the overriding priorities of public authorities must be 
to redress public finance. Additional corrective measures are 
necessary to reassure investors, eliminate the "snowball effect" 
(i.e. the self-sustaining increase in the debt/GDP ratio as a 
result of interest payments), put fiscal consolidation back on a 
path consistent with the Maastricht targets and start making 
room for the increase in social expenditure that population 
ageing will likely cause. 
  These corrective measures will have to center on the social 
security system and its growing deficit and all social security 
schemes should be reassessed along these lines. The OECD also 
recommends: 

  -  In the context of the federalization of the 
country, a reorganization of the public sector to avoid 
duplication of work between the different levels of 
administration, leading to a reduction in the overall number of 
civil servants; 
  -  Preparation for the pressure on social spending 
that demographic trends are likely to cause as the population 
ages; 
  -  More flexibility in wage indexation; 
  -  Given the extent of 
unemployment, positive actions in the form of retraining and job 
placement programs, especially for persons over 46 or unemployed 
for less than nine months who are not covered by the present 
"personal" plan. The OECD notes that the Belgian economy has 
entered into a cyclical downturn: Real GDP is likely to fall by 
around 1.25 percent this year, more than the EC average. This 
downturn in activity is due to external developments, high real 
EMS [European Monetary System] interest rates and a 
deterioration in international competitiveness as a result of 
exchange rate changes in Europe. 
  Regarding the economic situation in Luxembourg, the OECD 
concludes that the outlook is mediocre. Economic growth is 
likely to decelerate in 1994 and labor costs are expected to 
increase more rapidly than in partner countries. Although the 
public finance situation compares extremely well with that of 
other European countries, its recent sharp deterioration 
illustrates the risks of a continued buoyant expenditure growth 
policy in the medium term. The high expenditure growth 
reflected the government's ambitious investment programs and the 
rapidly growing government wage bill and transfers to the 
business and household sector. The 1993 and 1994 budgets 
maintain this policy stance. The OECD nevertheless notes that 
the cyclical downturn in 1992 and 1993 and the only modest 
rebound projected for 1994 could have a sharper negative impact 
on revenues than foreseen in the budget, resulting in a serious 
downward risk on the government balance for 1994. Lastly, the 
OECD recommends building in more flexibility in public 
expenditure and gaining better control over it.

<F P=106> [Martin Fletcher article: "A Slap in the Face for Major"] </F>
  [Text] The past 48 hours have been a public relations 
catastrophe for Britain in America. Gerry Adams, basking in his 
new-found legitimacy, has been guest of honour on America's most 
popular television chat shows and splashed across the front 
pages of its newspapers. Naive interviewers have lobbed him 
softball questions, permitting this master of blarney to tell 
millions of impressionable Americans how his desire for peace is 
being frustrated by the British. 
  Despite Britain's efforts to alert his interviewers to the 
complexities of Northern Ireland, none has pressed Mr Adams on, 
for example, the decades of IRA atrocities that have killed 
hundreds of innocent civilians. John Alderdice, leader of the 
Alliance party, did manage an on-air telephone call to Larry 
King Live to counter the spiel of a man Mr King addressed 
throughout as "Gerry," but ABC's Good Morning America refused to 
let him take part. 
  "It's a propaganda triumph for Adams," groaned one British 
official. "It's set back a true understanding of Northern 
Ireland in America by 10 or 15 years." The British warned the 
Clinton Administration that this would happen, and one or two 
U.S. officials yesterday expressed dismay at Mr Adams's coup. 
The chat-show hosts may have been naive, but not half as bad as 
those in the White House who believed they could limit the Sinn 
Fein leaders exposure by restricting him to a 25-mile radius of 
Manhattan. 
  The British Government argued forcefully that it would be 
quite wrong for the Administration to reward Mr Adams before he 
had made a single genuine concession, and this was accepted by 
the State and Justice Departments, House Speaker Thomas Foley 
and the FBI, which has spent years combating Irish and other 
terrorists. 
  Indeed, Sunday's White House statement announcing Mr Adams's 
admittance was a model of disinformation. It said Janet Reno, 
the Attorney General, had issued the order on the recommendation 
of Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State -- the clear 
suggestion being that these two senior cabinet secretaries 
supported the President's decision. In fact, the White House 
leaked it before Miss Reno had even been told. 
  By this time, even Sir Robin Renwick, the British ambassador 
and a formidable behind-the-scenes operator, was unable to save 
the situation. After a day of deliberation on Saturday, Mr 
Clinton took a decision which reversed a 20-year American policy 
and can be construed only as a slap in the face for America's 
closest ally. He did so on the recommendation of the National 
Security Council, which argued that now was the time to offer Mr 
Adams a carrot, and under intense political pressure from a 
galvanised Irish-American lobby. 
  Mr Clinton must also have known that his decision would be 
seen as a rebuff to Britain and a propaganda victory for the 
IRA. It would be going too far to suggest this was his revenge 
for the Conservatives' support of President Bush in the 1992 
campaign, but the inescapable conclusion is that he cares less 
about Washington's relations with London than his predecessors. 
  The international relationships he most values are those 
based on trade, not security, and on that score Britain rates 
well below China, Japan and Germany. 
  But what really preoccupies Mr Clinton is domestic politics. 
He had fences to mend with the powerful Irish-American lobby, 
having last year backpedalled on his election promises to admit 
Mr Adams and appoint a special envoy to Northern Ireland. The 
pressure on him was spearheaded by Edward Kennedy and Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, chairmen respectively of the Senate labour and 
finance committees, whose support for Mr Clinton's health-care 
reform is critical. They were backed by 12 other senators and 
27 congressmen, almost all Democrats from areas with sizeable 
Irish communities. Thirty-two of them face re-election this 
November. 
  Earlier this month, these congressmen all signed a letter 
urging Mr Clinton to "facilitate the emerging dialogue as an 
alternative to violence," and they sustained the pressure up to 
the moment the decision was taken. They argued that a 
concession to Mr Adams might strengthen his influence over IRA 
hardliners opposed to the joint declaration, and that the 
British Government had itself had recent contacts with Sinn Fein 
and the IRA. 
  Early last week, British officials thought Mr Adams would 
not 
be admitted. They were not unduly alarmed even when the 
Administration announced last Thursday that it is ordering its 
Belfast diplomats to elicit Mr Adams's views on terrorism and 
the Anglo-lrish peace initiative. They believed they had 
reached an understanding that Mr Adams would only be let in if 
he unequivocally renounced violence and supported the joint 
declaration. What no one anticipated was that the White House 
would instead interpret Mr Adams's weasel words as "constructive 
comments warranting a visa." 
  John Major visits Washington later this month. He will 
undoubtedly play down this unhappy episode. But there seems 
little chance of the Prime Minister and Mr Clinton sitting down 
in a Washington restaurant, as the President did with Germany's 
Helmut Kohl this week, and jovially gobbling their way through a 
hefty lunch like the best of friends.

<F P=106> [Philip Webster and Martin Fletcher report: "Anglo-U.S. Bid </F>
To Avoid Rift Over Adams"] 
  [Text] London and Washington were struggling last night to 
prevent a serious breach in relations over President Clinton's 
decision to overrule his ambassador to Britain, the FBI and 
senior policy advisers in personally approving Gerry Adams's 
visit to America. 
  Both the White House and Downing Street were clearly 
embarrassed by the publicity spree enjoyed by the Sinn Fein 
leader, who flew home last night, and in London diplomats and 
ministers could scarcely conceal their fury over Mr Clinton's 
decision. 
  But with John Major due to meet the President in Washington 
at the end of the month, officials on both sides of the Atlantic 
tried to play down suggestions of a rift. Downing Street 
insisted that relations were in good shape, although the 
American ambassador to London admitted that the issue had caused 
difficulties. 
  In Washington, White House officials felt disappointed and 
let down by Mr Adams, who failed to deliver the concession that 
had been expected as vindication of the President's 
controversial decision. Mr Adams's congressional backers had led 
key presidential advisers to believe that he would use his 
address to a New York conference on Ulster to advance the peace 
process, possibly by announcing a three-month ceasefire. In the 
event, he merely repeated his calls for clarification of the 
Downing Street declaration. 
  By the time he left, however, Mr Adams was coming under 
strong pressure from embarrassed White House officials and his 
own supporters, and in a final press conference he promised 
prominent Americans who had backed his visit that they would not 
be let down. He would apply himself to making concrete decisions 
when he got home. 
  But Downing Street had already made clear that it was no 
longer willing to wait for Mr Adams and that efforts to reach a 
political settlement in Northern Ireland -- if necessary without 
Sinn Fein -- were about to be intensified. Sir Patrick Mayhew, 
the Northern Ireland Secretary, is expected to bring forward 
fresh proposals, possibly including an Ulster assembly, in the 
next two weeks. 
  In an interview with the FINANCIAL TIMES today, Sir Patrick 
indicates that his framework would involve simultaneous talks on 
internal political arrangements for Ulster and on relations 
between Belfast and Dublin. But he insists that talks on 
crossborder co-operation would not lead to joint authority. 
  Senior ministers admitted yesterday that Britain had been 
caught on the hop by the Adams visit: the Government believed 
until late on Sunday [30 January] that Mr Adams would be allowed 
into America only if he renounced violence. But officials said 
it would have been difficult for anyone to counter the Adams 
bandwagon once it had got under way -- during his 48 hours, Mr 
Adams notched up eight television appearances, five press 
conferences, newspaper interviews, and meetings with congressmen 
and as well as speeches to enthusiastic audiences. He was said 
to have "put a human face on the IRA" and was compared with 
Clint Eastwood, Nelson Mandela and George Washington. 
  To cap it all, he challenged Douglas Hurd to a television 
debate, a gauntlet ignored by the Foreign Secretary. Whitehall 
officials said he would not be seen answering the Adams agenda. 
"Mr Hurd should not be put on the same level as Adams," they 
said. 
  Mr Hurd was also anxious to avoid a public row over Mr 
Clinton's decision to grant Mr Adams a visa, although he made 
Britain's displeasure plain in meetings with Vice President Al 
Gore, Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State, and Anthony 
Lake the National Security Adviser. Officials said they had 
been left in no doubt of "the offence not just to the British 
Government, but to the British people and the people of Northern 
Ireland." At the same time Raymond Seitz, the American 
ambassador, was called to Downing Street to be told of Mr 
Major's alarm, while Britain's ambassador, Sir Robin Renwick, 
conveyed the same message to Washington. Mr Seitz is 
understood to have been against the visit -- as were the FBI and 
the Justice and State departments -- and the ambassador admitted 
yesterday that there had been a tussle inside the American 
Administration. He said Mr Clinton "took a chance." 
  By late on Tuesday, the President appeared to admit his 
mistake when he said his idea of appointing a special envoy had 
been overtaken by events and praised the initiative undertaken 
by Mr Major and Albert Reynolds. 
  Mr Major meanwhile signalled his determination to press 
ahead 
with that initiative as Downing Street officials warned that the 
peace process "cannot and will not wait for Sinn Fein." 
  The provisionals had been challenged to give up violence and 
had not done so. They had been challenged to enter the 
democratic arena and had not had the courage to do so. "While 
Adams was telling the Americans he favored peace, his movement 
was firing mortars in Northern Ireland. His smokescreen of 
evasions and falsehoods has not deceived people."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Mr Adams and a Calmer Accounting"] </F>
  [Text] Everything that British ministers said yesterday 
about Gerry Adams's visit to the United States was true. Yes, 
it was a publicity bonanza, just as Douglas Hurd claimed. Yes, 
he did the whitewash job of which Sir Patrick Mayhew complained. 
Yes, he resorted to a smokescreen of evasions and falsehoods as 
alleged in a hard-hitting series of comments from Downing 
Street's new press briefing team. Ken Maginnis got it right 
when he wrote yesterday that the cause of terrorism has been 
elevated and that of democracy diminished. 
  But there are also other true conclusions to draw from the 
48-hour visit, and they pull in rather different directions. In 
the first place, there is the extent to which Britain has 
provided Mr Adams with a megaphone by its own actions. The 
British broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein -- which would almost 
certainly be unconstitutional in America -- directly contributed 
to the American celebration of Mr Adams. His cachet was 
increased merely by the fact that he was able to present himself 
-- accurately -- as the man the Brits are trying to gag. That 
and the fact that Mr Adams had been barred for two decades from 
the U.S. gave a radical chic credibility which carried him 
easily through two days of largely uncritical attention. 
  Yet, at the end of the visit, has Mr Adams come back with 
American endorsement in his pocket? On the contrary, he returns 
with a rejection from the same administration which allowed him 
to visit the country in the first place. The most important 
concrete developments to emerge from Mr Adams's two days in New 
York are President Clinton's call for Sinn Fein to embrace the 
Downing Street declaration and his explicit abandonment of his 
1992 campaign pledge to send an American peace envoy to Northern 
Ireland. It may or may not be true, as Mr Maginnis alleges, 
that the President sent a wrong signal to the world by giving Mr 
Adams his visa. But it is indisputable that Mr Clinton has now 
sent the right signal to Mr Adams. 
  Last but not least, there is the knot into which Mr Adams 
may 
be tying himself. Attempts to equate the Sinn Fein leader with 
Nelson Mandela, George Washington or even Yasir 'Arafat are 
rightly offensive to constitutional politicians. None of Mr 
Adams's followers is denied the vote. He does not speak for a 
disenfranchised majority or even a disenfranchised minority. 
But we need to look beyond the rhetoric to the context it 
creates. Mr Adams, in his own deceiving way, talked nothing but 
peace as he passed from interview to interview. "We're going to 
have peace not in 20 years, not in 40 years, but in our time," 
he said as he left New York. If that is what be believes, then 
there is only one way that it can happen -- and it rests in his 
own hands.

<F P=106> [Kevin Brown and Ivor Owen report: "Major Masks Fury With </F>
U.S."] 
  [Text] Mr John Major yesterday launched a concerted 
attempt to paper over deep cracks in the Anglo-American 
relationship in the wake of Mr Gerry Adams' visit to New York. 
  As Mr Major -- who is to visit Washington this month -- 
moved, officials were desperately trying to limit the damage to 
British interests caused by the almost unchallenged access to 
the U.S. media which the Sinn Fein president enjoyed for 48 
hours. 
  But the government was unable to conceal its dismay at 
President Bill Clinton's decision to issue a visa for Mr Adams. 
  Publicly, Downing Street put on a brave face. A senior 
official said the Anglo-U.S. relationship was "alive and well 
and extremely vigorous." 
  In private ministers and senior officials were bitterly 
disappointed at President Clinton's decision to overrule his 
most senior advisers. 
  One senior minister said the president appeared to have put 
UK-U.S. relations and the future of the Northern Ireland peace 
initiative at risk to placate the U.S.'s vocal Irish-American 
lobby. 
  The government was also upset by the largely sympathetic 
coverage given to Mr Adams by the U.S. media, and by the lack of 
balancing comments from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. 
A Downing Street official said: "Douglas Hurd worked his arse 
off to get himself on American television screens. He has been 
pushed off the networks by programmers who have decided that 
Gerry Adams is more interesting." 
  The mood in Downing Street is unlikely to be improved by a 
broad hint from Mr Raymond Seitz, the U.S. ambassador to London, 
that he advised Mr Clinton not to allow Mr Adams into the U.S. 
  Officials disclosed that Mr Seitz was called to Downing 
Street for talks on Tuesday [1 February] as part of a diplomatic 
drive to persuade Mr Clinton to distance himself from Sinn Fein. 
"There was a big tussle in my government about this," Mr Seitz 
added. 
  He hoped Mr Adams' experience in the U.S. would "act as an 
encouragement for him to renounce violence and condemn it when 
it occurs. We will have to wait and see." 
  The British position was also put to Mr Al Gore, the U.S. 
vice-president, by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and by 
Sir Robin Renwick, British ambassador to Washington. 
  Downing Street said the flurry of diplomatic activity bore 
fruit in Mr Clinton's statement on Tuesday which supported the 
Anglo/Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland and abandoned 
the idea of a U.S. "peace envoy" to Belfast.

<F P=106> [Conor Cruise O'Brien article: "A Fox Loose in the Henhouse"] </F>
  [Text] Gerry Adams's visit to the United States has been a 
triumph for the cause he represents. And the cause he 
represents is that of the Provisional IRA. We forget that last 
fact at our peril. And we have been forgetting it, in a fog of 
disinformation and wishful thinking. This is how it came about 
that Mr Adams got to the U.S. in a blaze of glory. 
  He will also get a great reception on his return to Belfast, 
and the morale and recruitment of the IRA will benefit 
accordingly. The lives of British soldiers serving in Northern 
Ireland, and of members of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary], 
and of all persons incurring the displeasure of the IRA will be 
at correspondingly higher risk. 
  The most sinister aspect of this ill-omened event was the 
nature of the statement in virtue of which Mr Adams was 
officially admitted to the United States. The initial position 
of the Clinton administration was that Mr Adams must explicitly 
"renounce violence," or be excluded. He declined to renounce 
violence. Instead, he offered the thought that he personally is 
against the killing of "innocent civilians." 
  The acceptance of this formula, as a basis for the admission 
to the U.S. of the political representative of the Provisional 
IRA, is equivalent to conceding the existence of legitimate 
targets for political terrorism. Under all previous U.S. 
administrations, the IRA were regarded as terrorists. They are 
now well on the way to achieving the status of freedom fighters. 
And this is the most significant result to date of what is 
still being hailed as a peace process. 
  It is important not to minimise the scope and scale of Mr 
Adams's American success, or of its implications for Ireland and 
Britain. No other living Irish leader -- not Mr Reynolds, not Mr 
Spring, not even Mr Hume -- has ever made a hit like this in 
America. Yet all the latter leaders have important electoral 
mandates. Mr Adams is not now an elected parliamentarian. Sinn 
Fein's democratic base is tiny in the island as a whole, and 
virtually nonexistent in the Republic. 
  Yet Mr Adams became, overnight on Larry King Live, the most 
visible Irishman in the U.S. He was also treated with great 
respect in the upmarket media, headed by the NEW YORK TIMES, 
which ran two grovelling profiles of him on Tuesday. He also 
totally dominated the media coverage of the proceedings at the 
upmarket Kissinger- chaired conference, participation in which 
was the ostensible object of his journey. 
  Gerry Adams's media magic is not due mainly to his skills as 
a communicator, although these are not negligible. It is mainly 
due to his personal status, which is romantically ambiguous. On 
the one hand, he is known to be the principal spokesman for a 
terrorist organisation. On the other, he comes before the 
public in the role of peacemaker. On the box, he is a 
fascinating twofer: Jekyll and Hyde, making a joint appearance. 
From Jekyll, you get the reassuring aura of the pacific quest: 
from Hyde, the delicious frisson of a safe encounter with a 
killer. It is the last that is Adams's trump card on the box. 
No interviewer, no interlocutor can match that. And none did, on 
this trip. 
  Broadcasting mandarins, defending the principle of allowing 
terrorists to broadcast, used to maintain -- and probably still 
do -- that exposure to broadcasting, and skilful interrogation 
by dedicated broadcasters, would damage the terrorists. The 
fact is that letting terrorists on to television is giving the 
fox the run of the henhouse. In the presence of the Adams fox, 
on Irish and American television, the dedicated broadcasters 
have been no more effective than the hens. 
  But who gave the fox the run of the henhouse? Who got for Mr 
Adams the degree of official approval without which he would 
never have been admitted either to the territorial U.S. or to 
its airwaves? Three governments share in the responsibility for 
this: Dublin, London and Washington. 
  The responsibilities are unequally shared. That of Dublin is 
primary and pivotal. Since the beginning of the Provisional IRA 
offensive, in 1971, every Dublin government has refused to 
countenance the IRA, and has thrown its weight against the 
admission to the U.S. of the Sinn Fein president. The leading 
"friends of Ireland" in congress went along with this and a 
policy of exclusion prevailed. The British government alone 
could not have held that line. The two governments together 
could end it. But this time round, the Dublin government shifted 
its line. Irish officials now advised senators Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan and Edward Kennedy to throw their weight behind the 
admission of Gerry Adams. To continue to exclude him might (in 
a fashionable and toxic phrase) injure "the delicate balance of 
the peace process." 
  The State Department and the Department of Justice 
continued to oppose admission. But Moynihan and Kennedy were 
too much for them. Moynihan, as well as being a greatly 
respected figure in his own right, is now chairman of the Senate 
finance committee. He is essential to the success of the 
president's legislative programme, and also a faintly menacing 
figure for the presidential future as Whitewatergate develops. 
(It was Moynihan who forced the president to appoint a special 
council to investigate that matter.) So Clinton gave in, and 
further concessions may be expected unless counter measures are 
taken. 
  The responsibilities of Dublin and Washington are clear. 
London's responsibility is less obvious, but heavy. Mr Major's 
great mistake was to yield to Albert Reynolds' entreaties to 
incorporate the "self-determination" formula in the Downing 
Street agreement of 15 December. No doubt Mr Major and his 
advisers thought the formula became harmless when incorporated 
in a context which contains "guarantees" for the Unionists. 
  But it isn't harmless. The guarantees are old stuff, but the 
self-determination formula is altogether new. And everyone 
knows it is an IRA formula, urged on Dublin through the 
Hume-Adams process, then pressed on London by Dublin. What the 
acceptance of those words signifies for the IRA is that the 
British position in Northern Ireland is weakening, and will 
weaken further, under further ingenious and ruthless 
combinations of political and paramilitary pressure. 
  For Dublin, that acceptance meant that it can pursue a 
Hume-Adams line -- which is popular, especially in Fianna Fail 
-- without seriously damaging relations with London, which would 
worry most people in Ireland. In making possible Mr Adams's 
U.S. journey, with the serious damage that this has done to 
Anglo-American relations, Mr Reynolds overlooked the damage that 
was being done to Anglo-Irish relations. He should reconsider 
that. 
  It is time to call a halt. Mr Major should now talk 
seriously to Mr Reynolds. He should make clear that unless Sinn 
Fein unconditionally accepts the Downing Street declaration by a 
given date, and unless the IRA unconditionally ends its campaign 
by the same date, both governments should agree that the 
declaration ceases to be operative. In short, both governments 
should stop their disastrous quest for peace through appeasement 
of the IRA. There are serious security matters to be discussed 
between them, once appeasement is seen to have totally failed.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Department of the </F>
Environment: "DOE Expands Construction Trade Mission Programme"] 
  [Text] Construction Minister Sir George Young today 
announced a major programme of construction industry trade 
missions for this year. 
  The five missions -- each led by a Minister -- will support 
the export efforts of British contractors and consultants, and 
building materials producers. 
<H5>  Unveiling the Programme, Sir George said: </H5>
  "I am delighted to announce that Secretary of State John 
Gummer, Tony Baldry and I will be spearheading a much-expanded 
construction trade missions programme during 1994." The 
programme will cover India, Kazakhstan, Indonesia and Malaysia, 
Chile and Argentina, and Vietnam and the Philippines. 
  "As sponsors of the construction industry we must help 
ensure 
that the many skills and services that our industry has to offer 
are effectively promoted in the markets that the industry sees 
as providing the best opportunities overseas. 
  "Our programme has been drawn up after careful and extensive 
consultation with the major construction industry trade 
associations. This is an ambitious but necessary programme if we 
are to maintain and improve our position in the fiercely 
competitive international construction market. 
  "Last year's missions to Lebanon, Taiwan and China were a 
great success and gave an edge to the industry's efforts to 
compete in these markets. I, and my Ministerial colleagues, look 
forward to working closely with industry representatives to make 
this year's missions equally, if not even more, successful." 
<H5>  Notes for Editors </H5>
  The Secretary of State for the Environment launched the new 
Construction Sponsorship Directorate on 27 September 1993 with 
the specific brief of "Listening to the industry"; "Explaining 
Government policies and priorities"; "Advocating on behalf of 
the industry both at home and abroad"; and "Promoting exports, 
productivity and innovation." 
  A new Construction Export Promotion Division has been 
created 
within the Directorate and this is the first trade missions 
programme organised under the new structure. 
  In 1993 DOE Ministers led construction trade missions to the 
Lebanon, Taiwan and China in 1993. 
  The timetable for the 1994 missions programme 
is: 

  -  Easter: India, led by Tony Baldry 
  -  Whit Sunday: 
Kazakhstan, led by Sir George Young 
  -  Whit Sunday: Indonesia and 
Malaysia, led by Tony Baldry 
  -  Summer: Chile and Argentina, led by 
the Secretary of State for the Environment 
  -  Summer: Vietnam and 
the Philippines, led by Tony Baldry

<F P=106> [Vivek Chaudhary report: "Protests After Indian Ocean N-Base </F>
Left Out of Green Plan"] 
  [Text] British green groups are unhappy at the omission 
from a government conservation plan of a British territory in 
the Indian Ocean, rich in natural resources but also containing 
a vital U.S. nuclear base. 
  The British Indian Ocean Territory, considered to be of 
"outstanding international conservation importance," includes 
the strategically important Diego Garcia base, the only U.S. 
nuclear base in the Indian Ocean. 
  It failed to appear in the Government's action plan on 
biodiversity last week -- drawn up in response to the `Earth 
Summit' in Rio -- despite featuring in a draft version. 
  The territory lies just south of the equator approximately 
2,000 miles off the coast of Keyna. It was bought by Britain 
from Mauritius for 3 million pounds in 1965. A Royal Navy 
detachment is based there and Diego Garcia was the refuelling 
point for American B52 bombers attacking Iraq during the Gulf 
war. 
  The territory contains the Great Chagos Bank, the world's 
largest atoll, and more than 700 species of fish and sea birds 
and over 500 species of hard coral and molluscs. 
  Friends of the Earth is writing to the Department of the 
Environment asking why it has been left out of the conservation 
plan.

<F P=106> [Ross Tieman article: "Rover Sale Allows BAe To Strengthen </F>
Aviation Core"] 
  [Text] When Dick Evans, British Aerospace [BAe] chief 
executive, and Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chairman, posed for a 
photocall yesterday to symbolise the takeover of Rover by the 
German car company, they were meant to be standing in front of a 
car from each. Unfortunately, when they arrived, the only 
vehicle on show was a BMW; of the Rover there was, initially at 
least, no sign. 
  Rover's departure is something BAe executives have been 
privately looking forward to for some time. But it will be fear 
that Rover, submerged within BMW, may eventually disappear from 
the UK, taking with it technological expertise and jobs, that 
will concern the Labour party, trade union leaders and Rover's 
30,000 employees. 
  Among City analysts, though, there was a sense almost of 
exhilaration. "It's pretty much what I predicted last year," 
said Chris Tarry, of Paribas Capital Markets. "I thought the 
buyer would be Volkswagen, but BMW was my second choice." 
  The sale of Rover by BAe is unquestionably an historic event 
in British manufacturing. In 1986, when Paul Channon, then 
industry secretary, tried to sell Land-Rover and Austin Rover to 
General Motors and Ford of America, respectively, there was 
public outrage. So furious were the Tory supporters in the 
shires, that Lady Thatcher's administration was forced to back 
down. Debarred from an overseas sale, Lord Young, a subsequent 
industry secretary, turned to Britain's biggest manufacturing 
company, and in August 1988 concluded a sale of the entire Rover 
Group to BAe. 
  Professor Sir Roland Smith, then chairman of BAe, described 
his 150 million pound purchase as the "deal of the decade." 
Even though BAe was subsequently obliged by the European Court 
to repay 48 million pounds in illegal sweeteners, yesterday's 
agreement to sell Rover to BMW for 800 million pounds is a 
tribute to the accuracy of his assessment. 
  Of course, Sir Roland was at his most ebullient in those 
days, gathering acquisitions into BAe almost willy-nilly, so 
long as they could be bolted on somewhere. Perhaps it was 
unsurprising, given BAe's history. Formed in April 1977, BAe 
was a nationalised corporation designed to bring together the 
aerospace interests of the British Aircraft Corporation, Hawker 
Siddeley Aviation, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish 
Aviation in a single "national champion" company. 
  Although the incoming Conservative government privatised the 
company in February 1981, it became increasingly acquisitive as 
the restructuring of British industry gathered pace. In April 
1987, the group picked up Royal Ordnance, the munitions group. 
Ballast Nedam, a Dutch construction company, was added in 
December. The company diversified into property (to maximise 
revenue from land released by restructuring), 
telecommunications, wind farms, airports. Subsidiaries 
mushroomed until the autumn of 1991 when the recession exposed 
how overstretched the group had become. Shareholders reacted 
with fury when it plunged into loss and called on them for 432 
million pounds to bail it out. 
  Sir Roland was ousted in a boardroom coup and Sir Graham 
Day, 
the Rover Group chairman, was asked to draw up a new strategy 
and find a new chairman. The man he chose was John Cahill, from 
the conglomerate BTR. Since he arrived almost two years ago 
Cahill has set about the restructuring and rationalisation that 
Sir Roland so conspicuously failed to achieve. 
  In classic BTR style, BAe has focused on markets where it 
can 
command a dominant position, and endeavoured to become a 
low-cost producer. In little more than two years, the company 
has shed 25,000 workers, taking total employment down to some 
95,000, and made a string of disposals, including corporate jets 
and Ballast Nedam. 
  Once Rover is sold, the defence business will once more be 
the heart of the group. Annual sales last year are thought to 
have been 3.8 billion pounds, only a whisker below Rover's 4 
billion pounds. But unlike car-making, manufacturing weapons has 
been consistently profitable. United Kingdom defence spending 
is set to fall 16 percent in real terms between 1991 and 1997. 
But aided by government ministers, BAe has secured massive 
long-term export deals around the world in Saudi Arabia, 
Indonesia, and elsewhere. Its Hawk aircraft is the best-selling 
jet trainer in the world, the Harrier vertical take-off fighter 
is a winner, Tornado is the mainstay of several European air 
forces and the Eurofighter project remains a long-term 
moneyspinner. The profitability of defence will be reinforced 
by job cutting, especially in Royal Ordnance. The deepest 
retrenchment has occurred in civil aircraft, where profits have 
been devastated by a fall in aircraft demand triggered by the 
recession. A loss of 337 million pounds on sales of 1.5 billion 
pounds is predicted by independent analysts for 1993. The core 
of BAe's civil business is its 20 percent stake in Airbus 
Industrie, the pan-European planemaker which is now the world's 
second largest after Boeing. BAe builds the wings, profitably, 
for every plane in the range. 
  In an effort to secure the future of its regional jet range, 
BAe wasted 15 months talking to Taiwan Aerospace Corporation 
about joint-venture production. In the end, TAC walked away. 
But capital-cost write-offs, concentration on a single site at 
Woodford, in Cheshire, and modernisation of the plane and the 
manufacturing process appear on course to restore profitability 
and the status of the Avro RJ series as the world's most 
successful regional jet. Avro has already sold seven this year. 
  BAe's biggest remaining problem on the civil aircraft side, 
and the source of continuing losses, is Jetstream Aircraft, at 
Prestwick in Scotland. Although the smaller Jetstream 
turbo-prop planes have been a commercial success, the larger 
Jetstream 61, derived from the ATP, has not. Talks are in hand 
with a rival manufacturers [as published] around the globe. 
  The sale of Rover will provide the opportunity to focus 
attention on solving the weaknesses of the defence and civil 
aerospace businesses. The combined effect of an 800 million 
pound cheque from BMW and removal of Rover's borrowings should 
leave BAe modestly in the black with its bankers. Removal of 
Rover's 700 million pounds of off-balance sheet borrowings from 
the liabilities will simultaneously give BAe headroom to borrow 
any funds needed to conclude a deal on the Jetstream business. 
  But there should also be more cash and management time to 
devote to BAe's remaining broad spread of activities. Top of 
the disposal list is believed to be the space systems business, 
with the retail side of Arlington, the property company, a close 
second. 
  Talks with Matra-Hachette of France about a joint company 
embracing their missile manufacturing interests are also well 
advanced. Some other disposals are expected to follow when 
circumstances permit, such as the sale of BAe's 30 percent 
interest in Hutchison Telecommunications, the mobile telephone 
company. 
  But many questions about BAe's stewardship of Britain's most 
advanced technologies remain unanswered. BAe can take no credit 
for Rover's revival. That was achieved by the combination of 
Rover employees and Honda engineering. 
  Defence has been successful at winning overseas orders, 
thanks in part to strong backing from government ministers. But 
after the sale of Rover, which BAe repeatedly insisted was a 
"core" business, and the vacillation over Avro, the company's 
determination and ability to remain a player in civil aviation 
is open to question. 
  Civil aircraft manufacture, historically, has been a way for 
companies to maximise government investment in military 
technology. But the current over-capacity among state-sponsored 
regional aircraft manufacturers around the world accentuates the 
need for collaboration and joint ventures. The bitterness of 
Rover's former partner, Honda, over yesterday's events, combined 
with the failure of discussions with TAC over Avro, may well 
cause any would-be BAe joint venture partners to have second 
thoughts. 
  John Cahill has shown he is good at rationalising 
businesses, 
and not bad at selling them. But he has yet to show that the 
new BAe can run high-tech companies successfully for long term 
growth, either alone or in partnership.

<F P=106> [Michael Harrison article: "Rover Deal Shakes Links With </F>
Japan"] 
  [Text] The government sought yesterday to limit the damage 
caused to Anglo-Japanese relations by the snub British Aerospace 
has delivered to Honda in selling Rover to BMW. 
  Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, said he could 
understand the anger felt by Honda, which owns 20 percent of 
Rover, but he urged other Japanese investors in Britain not to 
take fright. 
  "I would like to reassure any Japanese investors that as far 
as this country is concerned we will continue to welcome 
Japanese investment." Britain, he added, would continue to 
provide "the most business-friendly environment in Europe" for 
Japanese firms. 
  The UK accounts for about 40 percent of all Japanese 
investment into Europe and is the location for transplant 
factories set up by Japan's three leading car manufacturers, 
Toyota, Nissan and Honda. 
  Mr Sainsbury said the Department of Trade and Industry had 
maintained close links with Honda and Michael Heseltine, 
President of the Board of Trade, had talked to the company in 
Tokyo only two weeks ago. 
  Commenting on the sale of Rover to BMW, which has put in 
jeopardy a partnership with Honda stretching back 15 years, Mr 
Sainsbury said: "Their partner has gone off with somebody else 
and I can understand their reaction. 
  "Honda are going to have to make their decisions on the 
future of their arrangements. I hope that they will recognise 
when they talk to BMW that this is a mutually beneficial 
arrangement." 
  The BMW chairman is expected to fly to Tokyo next week to 
meet Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda, in an effort to 
assuage Japanese anger over the Rover deal. 
  It emerged yesterday that BMW executives had tried to see 
Honda in Japan last week but had been unable to do so. They 
have also offered to see them any time this week. 
  In a letter to Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of 
Trade, BMW says that it would like to build on the link with 
Honda, which owns 20 percent of Rover's car business, both in 
terms of current and planned projects. 
  Speaking at a presentation by Nissan, which last year 
overtook Rover as Britain's top car exporter, Mr Sainsbury said: 
"This is itself a message not only for Japanese investors but 
for the whole of the car industry." He said the Rover-BMW deal 
was "likely to strengthen Rover and give them access to new 
markets for exports." 
  Mr Sainsbury added that the DTI [Department of Trade and 
Industry] had maintained close contact with Honda and would 
continue to do so. "We share the wish expressed by BMW that the 
relationship between Rover and Honda will continue," he said. 
  The Prime Minister was involved in angry exchanges in the 
Commons yesterday after the Labour leader, John Smith, asked 
him: "Is it now the Government's definition of success for a 
British company that it is taken over by a foreign competitor?" 
  Mr Major accused the Opposition leader of living in the 
1960's and urged him to "catch up with the modern world." He 
said: "The prospects for Rover in the future are excellent. The 
new arrangements will provide new export markets for Rover and 
more investment." 
  On BBC Radio 4, Mr Heseltine called for an end to the 
"moaning" and described the takeover as a "massive vote of 
confidence" in the British economy. 
  He said: "The chance here now for Britain, one of the most 
competitive economies in Europe today, is the opportunity to 
build on this investment, to see larger numbers of Rovers sold 
across the world, to see British component manufacturers saying 
to the Germans: `First of all you have put your money into 
buying this company, why don't you now give us a chance to 
supply German cars in Germany with British components?'" 
  In its letter to Mr Heseltine BMW says the merger could 
"unlock enormous potential benefit for both enterprises." 
Referring to Rover's market niche and distinctive range, it 
adds: "We want to protect that asset and therefore intend to 
maintain BMW and Rover as separate enterprises, each with their 
own manufacturing plants and their own design and development 
capabilities."

<F P=106> [Graham Mather article: "Roving Across Frontiers"] </F>
  [Text] Many observers will share the balanced judgment of 
Jim Thomas of the MSF [Manufacturing, Science and Finance] union 
on BMW's acquisition of Rover: "It's a great shame that UK 
ownership will be lost. However, we have two quality companies 
coming together and they will be able to pool research and 
development resources." 
  Why should it be a great shame for Rover to become part of a 
larger European group? What is the downside of foreign 
ownership? BMW's price looks good, jobs are secured, the merged 
group will be a quality player in European and world markets, 
its scale will attract new investment, its prestige will help 
pull in the best managers and staff. 
  And yet and yet; the instinctive hesitation persists. Won't 
key decisions now be taken by Germans? In the event of a 
downturn, won't the British end be the first to suffer? More 
generally, why are so many top-class, hi-tech British businesses 
now being acquired by French or German companies? 
  The truth is that more overseas acquisitions of British 
companies are both likely and desirable. They are likely because 
Britain's post-war economic underperforrmance and the steady 
devaluation of the pound against the mark, and more recently 
against the franc, makes for a ratchet to overseas ownership. 
Accommodating overall economic underperformance by devaluation 
-- most recently on Black Wednesday -- eases political pressures 
at home but increases the supply of the best British businesses 
available to purchasers based in strong currency zones. 
  Rover is now a manufacturing star: but in the latest World 
Competitiveness Report, British manufacturing is perceived to be 
bottom of the list: 22nd out of 22 developed countries assessed. 
The paradox is that our historical weakness in manufacturing 
makes the exceptional performers tempting takeover targets. 
  Foreign ownership can be positively desirable. All the 
evidence is that European or North American purchasers of 
hi-tech companies have every incentive to give them maximum 
business autonomy, to preserve their brand images, to allow 
competing centres of excellence to flourish while squeezing 
costs. 
  Where British businesses have achieved turnrounds on the 
scale of that achieved by Rover, it would be crazy for their new 
owners to lose their identities or make them mere outstations: 
the purchaser needs their distinct strengths to help capture 
markets that are at once larger and more discriminating. 
  The net effect of overseas interest in Britain's economy has 
been foreign direct investment of more than 3 percent of GDP (in 
1990) -- higher than manufacturing investment itself. This has 
had a tangible result: by the end of the 1980s foreign-owned 
firms were getting 45 percent more output from their British 
workers than their British equivalents (a net output per 
employee of 39,260 pounds compared with a domestic 27,157 
pounds). 
  Rover is a textbook example of the process. It was rescued 
from its past by Japanese investment. It was freed from 
political control by privatisation. Now German resources can 
turn the new group into a truly world-class player. 
  When heavyweight British businesses are acquired by foreign 
owners of the scale and resources of BMW, there is no economic 
disadvantage. The domicile of its ultimate parent has little or 
no bearing on Rover's prospects; its parent's commercial 
commitment and compatibility with the rest of the group are far 
more important. 
  A new wave of acquisitions and mergers is likely to 
accompany 
global recovery, but it will be particularly acute in Europe as 
the business community restructures to take advantage of the 
large single market. Economic liberals, especially those who 
supported both a floating currency and the single market, can 
hardly complain as this integration takes place driven by 
markets not politics and with competition laws in place to guard 
against abuse. 
  Britain has forced upon itself the structural changes to 
labour markets and state-owned industries which our European 
rivals -- even those with fundamentally stronger economies -- 
have yet to face. 
  If we cannot be frank about the traditional weaknesses -- in 
productivity, growth, and in stop-go economic lurches -- then 
public understanding political backing and coherent strategy for 
revival will all suffer. Equally, ministers must accept that the 
widening of markets may mean more familiar names going to 
foreign owners. At the same time, we must continue to remove 
blockages impeding British business expansion overseas. British 
Gas, National Power, PowerGen, British Telecom, Mercury, BAA and 
other privatised success stories have huge expansion 
opportunities, not least into France and Germany, as 
liberalisation and privatisation get under way and public 
procurement opens up. In many of these areas, the pace is too 
slow, strong domestic monopolies are well dug in, and markets 
are being protected. 
  Britain seems to be recognising that a German owner of Rover 
could mark that company's rebirth, and be a sign of Britain's 
liberal, open and strong economic positioning. But we are 
entitled to expect that similar attitudes should prevail 
elsewhere, as British-owned businesses start providing energy, 
power, telecoms, transport infrastructure and other former state 
services across Europe.

<F P=106> [David Fairhall report: "`Sheehy-Style' Review of Armed </F>
Forces Prompts Trepidation"] 
  [Text] Radical changes in the armed forces career 
structures and conditions of service are expected to follow a 
review being compared with the Sheehy inquiry into the police. 
  "There is a lot of trepidation to say the least," said one 
officer. "It is a very major, in-depth review and will impact 
dramatically on all serving personnel." Servicemen fear their 
military status may mean that, unlike the police, they have no 
redress. 
  The review, announced at the weekend by the Chief of the 
Defence Staff, will take about a year, starting in the spring. 
It will be conducted by an independent chairman and up to five 
independent members, yet to be named. It is described by the 
Ministry of Defence as a major review of "service career and 
manpower structures, and terms and conditions of service." This 
is taken to include such issues as the extent of unaccompanied 
service for married men -- for example in Northern Ireland -- 
overseas allowances and subsidised schooling. 
  The review has been launched in the context of a three-year 
efficiency drive to meet Treasury demands for further cuts in 
the defence budget.

<F P=106> [Peter Norman report: "Sustained Recovery Foreseen by Bank </F>
Governor"] 
  [Text] Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of 
England, last night said prospects for sustained output growth 
and gradually falling unemployment were "better than at any 
time" in his 31-year professional career. 
  In a speech to the Bankers Club annual banquet in London's 
Guildhall, Mr George backed up this optimistic view with the 
observation that UK underlying inflation was lower than for a 
generation. 
  But the governor couched his remarks in such a way as to 
quash any idea that he might argue for a cut in bank base rates 
from their current 5.5 percent level when he meets Mr Kenneth 
Clarke, the chancellor, for their monthly monetary meeting later 
today. 
  Instead of discussing the short-term outlook, Mr George 
spoke 
of the need to make "sustained, non-inflationary growth a 
reality over the years ahead." He recalled that the government 
had the "declared longer-term aim of price stability" and, with 
the bank, was "making solid progress towards that goal." 
However, the desired outcome of stable prices, rising output 
and falling unemployment was "not assured," he said. 
  Mr George said price stability was necessary for avoiding 
the 
exaggerated boom and bust cycles that had caused repeated social 
and economic damage since the second world war. 
  On independence for the bank, he criticised those MPs who 
last Friday voted against a private member's bill to give it 
more autonomy on the grounds that the government must retain 
direct control over short-term interest rates. This stance was 
hard to understand, given proposals to make the bank more 
accountable to parliament. 
  On the other hand, he would not wish for independence 
without 
a broad consensus in favour of price stability. That would be 
"a poisoned chalice that I would be reluctant to take up even if 
it were offered," Mr George said.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Department of the </F>
Environment: "Taking Rio Forward: the Government's Climate 
Change Programme Launched"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister John Major and Environment Secretary, 
John Gummer, today launched Britain's national programme for 
combatting the threat of global climate change. 
  Published today following extensive consultation, the 
Programme is intended to meet the UK's commitments under the UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in Rio in 1992. 
More than 160 countries have signed the Convention; over 50 have 
now ratified it, and it will come into force on 21 March. 
Britain is one of the first to publish a detailed programme of 
measures to show how it will implement the Convention's 
requirements. 
  Since signing the Convention at the Earth Summit in Rio, the 
Prime Minister has taken a lead in seeking to persuade other 
leading countries to implement it as speedily as possible. In 
his foreword to the Programme, the Prime Minister says: 
  "In order to help encourage a prompt start to action, I 
pledged at the time that the UK would produce a programme of 
measures to implement the Convention's commitments as quickly as 
possible. This programme fulfils that pledge." 
<H5>  Mr. Major stresses: </H5>
  "The threat of climate change cannot be tackled by any one 
country or group of countries in isolation; it requires a global 
response. The Convention we signed at Rio represents an 
important first step towards providing the framework for such a 
response. 
  "At the same time, the measures required to tackle the 
problem cannot simply be decreed by governments; they depend on 
decisions and actions taken by all individual citizens in their 
daily lives. For this reason, this Programme was drawn up after 
widespread consultation within the United Kingdom. It seeks to 
harness the efforts of all sectors of our society and the 
participation of all our people in meeting the challenge for the 
sake of future generations." 
  The Convention places a number of obligations on countries. 
Chief among these for developed countries is a commitment to 
take measures aimed at returning emissions of greenhouse gases 
to 1990 levels by 2000. Britain is the first country in the 
world to demonstrate under the Convention how it will do this 
for each of the three main greenhouse gases. 
  For carbon dioxide, the most significant greenhouse gas, the 
Programme is designed to achieve savings equivalent to 10 
million tonnes of carbon (6 percent) against projected emissions 
in 2000. This should ensure a return to 1990 levels. It 
encompasses a wide variety of measures, (detailed in the 
attached table). 
  For the other main greenhouse gases, the programme in fact 
envisages reducing emissions by 2000: by 10 percent for methane, 
by 75 percent for nitrous oxide, as well as substantial 
reductions for other, less significant greenhouse gases. 
Overall, taking account of the relative importance of each gas, 
the Programme should achieve a reduction equivalent to some 5 
percent of greenhouse gas emissions from the UK by the year 2000. 
  The Programme also looks ahead beyond 2000 and sets out some 
of the longer term options for action that may need to be 
considered in the light of the emerging scientific evidence and 
the further development of the Convention. It emphasises that: 
  "As we enter the next Century, new and difficult choices may 
have to be made if we are to achieve a sustainable future. We 
will need to find ways of breaking the link between economic 
development and increasing emissions of greenhouse gases." In 
the transport sector in particular, "to have any major impact on 
projected trends, measures would be required that would change 
current patterns of transport use. People may not always be able 
to make journeys as easily or as cheaply as before.... 
Individuals will have to reconcile their desire for travel with 
their desire to protect the environment for future generations." 
A copy of the Programme's summary is attached. 
<H5>  Note to Editors </H5>
  The Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed by 
over 
150 countries at the Earth Summit in Rio in June 1992. It will 
come into force on 21 March, 3 months after 50 countries have 
ratified (that is, agreed to be bound by its obligations). The 
UK ratified on 8 December 1993 (DOE Press Release 832 of 3 
December). 
  The Convention sets out a framework for an international 
approach to tackling the problem of global warming. It requires 
developed country Parties to: 

  -  Take measures aimed at 
returning emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the 
year 2000 
  -  Provide assistance to developing countries. 
  All Parties are bound by other obligations on compiling 
inventories of emissions, on producing and publishing national 
programmes of measures to limit emissions, on promoting research 
and public education about climate change. 
  Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas. On 
current projections, the Convention commitment means finding 
savings in UK CO[.sup]2[/] emissions equivalent to some 10 
million tonnes of carbon. The Government conducted a major 
consultation exercise earlier this year on the options for 
achieving this reduction. In July, the Secretary of State for 
the Environment announced the Government's proposals, subject to 
finalisation of some aspects of the package (DOE press release 
507 of 26 July 1992). 
  The package was completed with the announcement in the 
Budget 
on 30 November that petrol and other road fuel duties were to be 
increased by a further 3 pence per litre (8-10 percent) 
immediately, and with increases in future years averaging at 
least 5 percent above the rate of inflation. Press Enquiries:

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [2 January] India's 
head of government, P.V. Narisimha Rao, arrived in Bonn for a 
four-day visit to Germany and for talks on expanding relations. 
Rao is returning a visit by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who visited 
India last February and thus introduced a new stage of Germany's 
policy toward Asia. 
  A few hours after his arrival Rao, who will meet with Kohl, 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany), as well as high-ranking representatives of German 
industry and the leaders of the coalition parties this Thursday, 
had an appointment with Development Aid Minister Carl-Dieter 
Spranger (Christian Social Union). The minister will go to 
India on 10 February to take a look at the projects of 
German-Indian cooperation in situ. On Wednesday, the Fraunhofer 
Society for the Promotion of Applied Research and the "Council 
of Scientific and Industrial Research" signed an agreement on 
cooperation in the fields of, among others, microelectronics and 
environmental research. 
  Deepening political and economic cooperation between India,

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In his talk with Indian Prime 
Minister P.V. Narisimha Rao, Chancellor Helmut Kohl called on 
German industry to make more investments on the subcontinent, 
which is inhabited by 900 million people. On Thursday [3 
February], the second day of his visit to Germany, which will 
last four days, Rao met in Bonn with Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) and was then received 
by Kohl with military honors in front of the Chancellor's Office. 
  It has been said that in the political part of this talk 
with 
Rao, Kohl clearly expressed the Western community interest in 
having India sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Kohl had 
broached this topic already during his visit to India last 
February. During this visit representatives of German and 
Indian industry signed an agreement on building two conventional 
power plants with an order value of 5.6 billion German marks. 
  After the political exchange of opinion, Kohl and Rao opened 
a German-Indian economic conference in the Chancellor's Office, 
which is under the patronage of the "Asia-Pacific Committee" of 
German industry. Kohl cited the focal issues of cooperation, 
which he sees as part of the Federal Government's Asian concept. 
The dialogue of the consultation forum, which was established 
during Rao's first visit to Germany in 1991, must be continued 
with representatives of industry, science, and members of the 
governments. Kohl announced that a German-Indian committee for 
science and technology, which will be staffed with high-ranking 
officials from both states, will soon start its work. 
  Kohl pointed out that the FRG is currently India's second 
most important supplier and its fourth most important sales 
market. "Our investments in India are remarkable, but they 
could still increase," the chancellor said. The deregulation 
and liberalization of the Indian economy also plays a big role 
in that. The successful conclusion of the GATT round is of 
great importance for the further development of the 
German-Indian economic relations. 
  On the first day of Rao's visit the Fraunhofer Society for 
the Promotion of Applied Research and the "Council of Scientific 
and Industrial Research" had signed an agreement on cooperation 
in the fields of, among others, microelectronics and 
environmental research. 
  The Indian prime minister's schedule also included meetings 
with the chairmen of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union and Free Democratic Party of Germany Bundestag 
groups as well as a continuation of the exchange of views with 
leading representatives of German industry. On Friday, Rao will 
receive Rudolf Scharping, minister-president of 
Rhineland-Palatinate and chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany, before he goes to Berlin, where he will be welcomed 
by President Richard von Weizsaecker.

  [Text] Bonn -- Bundeswehr soldiers will for the first time 
be sent to the territory of the former USSR on behalf of the 
United Nations. The cabinet decided today to dispatch six 
soldiers as unarmed military observers to the war zone in 
Georgia. According to government spokesman Dieter Vogel, the 
German contingent will include four military observers and one 
medical officer. They will form part of a UN contingent of 
about 60 soldiers from 10 nations. 
  There will be no constitutional problems over the observer 
status of the mission: This is only a "diplomatic mission" and 
no blue helmet operation is involved, the dispatch does not 
conflict with the government's position not to send soldiers to 
states on whose territory German troops fought in the past, 
Vogel pointed out. Incidentally, the Germans did not invade 
Georgia during World War II, he stressed. 
  Georgia's existence as a state is threatened by the 
separatist republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which want 
to merge with Russia.

  [Text] Cologne -- Unlike Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
(Christian Democratic Union), Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
(Free Democratic Party of Germany) believes that a Bundeswehr 
strength of 370,000 men should be "preserved by all means." In 
an interview with the Cologne EXPRESS (Friday edition), the 
minister stated that he is aware of the defense minister's 
financial worries and concerns. Yet he added that, in the event 
of a further reduction of the Bundeswehr, the constitutional 
stipulation of equality in conscription would sooner or later 
become a problem. 
  It must be determined what troop strength is needed for what 
purpose, and then the financial aspect must be discussed, and 
not the other way round, under the motto: "How much money do we 
have, and how many soldiers can we afford for that?" 
  Ruehe stated in Bonn on Wednesday [2 February], that, in 
order to cut defense expenditure, the strength of the Bundeswehr 
should be reduced to 345,000 soldiers by the end of 1994 and not 
to 370,000, as originally planned.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Thursday [3 February] 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the Arab League, thanked the 
Federal Government in Bonn for its work for the benefit of the 
Middle East peace process and its support for the Palestinian 
side. On the occasion of the first hoisting of the flag in 
front of the former unofficial PLO mission and current 
Palestinian delegation general, 'Abd-al-Majid said: "This event 
demonstrates the further development and depth of German-Arab 
relations. We are satisfied with and happy about this 
development." 
  The Egyptian politician, who has been in Bonn since 
Wednesday 
for a three-day visit, particularly stressed the dedication of 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. 'Abd-al-Majid and Kinkel want to 
discuss the progress of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and 
the expansion of German-Arab relations on Friday. 
  In an interview with DPA, 'Abd-al-Majid said that there are 
still "some difficulties" to be overcome in the peace process. 
"However, the Arab countries have decided to strive for peace 
and for a solution that will bring peace and stability to the 
region." The Arab League will provide help if this can 
contribute to a successful conclusion of the negotiations. 
  Previously, 'Abd-al-Majid, together with Palestinian 
Delegate 
General 'Abdallah Franji, had hoisted the black-white-green flag 
with the red triangle. The ceremony was attended by Arab 
ambassadors, representatives of the Foreign Ministry, and about 
100 Palestinians who live in Germany. 'Abdallah Franji, who has 
lived in Bonn for many years as the unofficial PLO 
representative, said this was one of the "best experiences of my 
life." After the visit by PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat in December, 
Bonn had revalued his office to a delegation general.

  [Text] Bonn -- Education Minister Rainer Ortleb (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) resigned today. In a short 
statement by the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] to 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the 49-year-old minister declared that 
he decided to take this step upon the advice of his doctor. 
Thus, he submitted a request to the chancellor requesting his 
discharge from the minister's office to the federal president. 
  Ortleb informed FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel that he has also 
resigned from his position as FDP chairman in 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. According to FDP spokesman 
Hans-Rolf Goebel, Kinkel took note of the two decisions with 
regret and respect and thanked Ortleb for the work he has 
performed. Kinkel expressed the hope that Ortleb will continue 
to make his "indispensable contribution" to completing German 
unity in the party's Executive Committee and the Bundestag group. 
  In November, Ortleb was hospitalized because of a 
circulatory 
collapse and later because of pneumonia. At the beginning of 
January, however, he resumed his official duties. According to 
information received by DPA, State Secretary Fritz Schaumann of 
the Education Ministry (FDP/47) and FDP Deputy Chairman Wolfgang 
Gerhardt are considered possible successors.

approved the appointment of federal judge Kay Nehm as new 
federal public prosecutor. The Social Democratic Party 
[SPD]-dominated laender chamber thus unanimously accepted Nehm, 
who had been proposed by Federal Justice Minister Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, of the Free Democratic Party [FDP]. 
The 52-year-old judge can now succeed Alexander von Stahl, who 
had been assigned nonactive status by the minister in the wake 
of the controversial antiterror operation of Bad Kleinen late 
last June. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Munich -- The German Aerospace AG company (Dasa) is 
intensifying its space commitment in Japan. As Dasa announced 
in Munich today, the Mitsui and Co. Ltd. corporation in Tokyo is 
to safeguard the space interests of the largest German 
enterprises specializing in aerospace and defense technology in 
Japan. The already signed agreement represents an expansion of 
the treaty concluded in 1981 between the Dasa enterprise Erno 
Raumfahrttechnik GmbH (Bremen) and the Japanese trading company 
on noncommercial aerospace projects. 
  Under the leadership of Dasa, a reusable space capsule 
procured by the German Aerospace Agency (Dara) from Russia is 
being equipped with German-Japanese pay loads and components 
under the project name "Express." The capsule is scheduled to 
be launched in the autumn of 1994 from the Kagoshima space 
center on board a Japanese carrier rocket. This project is 
being promoted by the German Research Ministry and the Japanese 
Ministry for International Trade and Industry.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Croatia Risks Isolation, Andreatta </F>
Says"] 
  [Text] Rome, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta this morning aired the possibility of the 
international community making a "substantive change" in its 
stance towards Croatia if Muslim allegations of direct Croatian 
military involvement in the Bosnian conflict are substantiated. 
  Addressing the Lower House foreign affairs commission ahead 
of a working lunch with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, 
Andreatta said his talks with Granic would focus on the 
"worrying reports of direct intervention by Zagreb in central 
Bosnia." "From my talks with Granic," he told the commission, 
"I expect convincing elements as regards the groundlessness of 
rumours -- which are however being firmed up by worrying details 
-- concerning a build-up of Croatian forces." 
  Many countries have been pressing for an extension of the 
embargo against the rump Yugoslav federation of 
Serbia-Montenegro, to include Croatia. 
  Andreatta added that "a development of this kind" would risk 
weakening the position of those such as Italy who have resisted 
calls for the military embargo to be lifted to allow Bosnian 
Muslims to defend themselves properly. On peace plans for 
Bosnia, Andreatta criticised "a certain idealism that does not 
look at costs," calling for "concrete positions." 
  In particular, he said that "if the condition for reaching 
peace is the separation of ethnic groups, this must be 
recognised, within the context of a European peace plan which 
is, in any case, perfectible." (Andreatta will have talks here 
tomorrow with international mediators David Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg.) 
  He defended the European peace plan for a three-way land 
split, saying that while it "does not respect the principles of 
morality and justice which the international community seeks to 
use as inspiration for its actions, it nonetheless appears 
necessary as a way of achieving the primary goal of stopping the 
fighting." 
  Despite the mutual refusals to budge from territorial 
claims, 
Andreatta underlined the importance of "keeping the negotiation 
process open" while re-affirming the possible use of NATO air 
strikes against Serb positions, in support of UN troops hold up 
at Srebrenica and Tuzla. He said that while action against 
Srebrenica appeared "less probable" for the moment, "there 
remains the possibility of action at Tuzla, unless Serbs supply 
the necessary co-operation to re-open the airport there." 
  But in any case, he reminded the commission, any air action 
will be "limited and targeted", and there should be "no 
illusions" that their use might play any decisive role in 
resolving a conflict that will ultimately be solved at the 
negotiating table. 
  Andreatta reiterated the need for greater involvement on the 
part of the United States, Russia, and moderate Islamic states 
in the stalled peace process. He said that a perceived lack of 
support from the United States might encourage the Bosnian 
Muslims to "confirm their present tendency of preferring 
military options." As for Russia, it must be called on to wield 
greater pressure on Serbia and "adopt an attitude of maximum 
openness towards Muslim requests." 
  He said Italy means to keep up all forms of pressure to 
ensure that aid convoys are allowed to continue consigning their 
precious deliveries, and reiterated that the presence of the UN 
troops is "indispensable" for protecting these convoys and 
acting as buffer between the warring factions and civilian 
populations.

  [Text] Milan -- More than 50 percent of Italians are in 
favor of an armed UN intervention "aimed at ending war in 
Bosnia." Within this large slice of the population, 
three-fourths are also in favor of the involvement of Italian 
troops in a possible UN intervention, whereas only 17 percent -- 
faced with the possibility of Italian troops being used -- 
change their minds and say no. 
  This is the altogether surprising result of a survey 
conducted by Doxa on behalf of TG3 [TV news], which broadcast 
the results yesterday evening. Fifty-one percent, therefore, 
want air raids and a UN intervention to take place. Among the 
male population, this percentage rises to 58. The more educated 
the interviewees are, the more they like the idea of 
intervention. Only 32 percent of Italians are against 
intervention, while 17 percent did not express any preferences.

  [Text] Reggio Calabria, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- The first 200 of 
1,350 army personnel deployed in the southern region of Calabria 
arrived here Thursday [3 February] as investigators confirmed 
that the same weapon was used in three separate attacks against 
Carabinieri police in which four officers were killed. 
  One hundred soldiers will be posted to the city's main 
courthouse while the others will replace local police in the 
provinces of Reggio Calabria, Catanzaro and Cosenza for routine 
patrol duties in what has been dubbed Operation Riace, aimed at 
crime-fighting and prevention in the region. 
  Separately, investigators said the same M-12 nine-caliber 
machine-gun was used in attacks December 2, January 18, and 
February 1 against Carabinieri police car patrols in the region. 
No one was injured in the first attack but both members of the 
two-man patrols were killed in the second and third attacks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "State's Witnesses Speak of Upcoming </F>
Attacks"] 
  [Text] Rome, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- Security measures for the 
protection of "the most exposed" Italian authorities have been 
ordered by Interior Minister Nicola Mancino against the backdrop 
of recent disclosures made by state's witnesses which signal the 
prospect of "further attacks against men and institutions," the 
minister reported today. 
  Discussing the ambush and killing of two Carabinieri 
policemen in the southern Calabria region on January 18 and a 
similar attack Tuesday [1 February], Mancino told the Lower 
House Constitutional Affairs Committee of "an attempt at a 
terrorist-type response from organized crime." 
  There is, on the side of the 'Ndrangheta organized crime 
families in Calabria and abroad "a worrying terrorist escalation 
which is aimed at re-accrediting the authority of the clans, 
de-legitimizing the actions of the state," he added. Mancino 
told the hearing that the armed assault of two Carabinieri 
policemen in Calabria on Tuesday, which left the two men in 
critical condition, may have been carried out by the same team 
of hit-men which struck on January 18 on the Salerno-Reggio 
Calabria express highway. 
  The minister went on to cover much the same ground in 
discussing the 'Ndrangheta before the Parliamentary Anti-Mafia 
Commission earlier when he provided data on the estimated 
strength and organization of the crime clans operating on the 
southern mainland. 
  Today, he said, "Witnessed under the profile of organization 
is a process of the modernization of the traditional horizontal 
structures" to bring them under a collective leadership body 
thought to pursue "an idea of the management of criminal power 
characterized by unity, greater professionalism and greater 
enterprise." Also underscored by the ministers was that, 
"Relations between organized crime and the political and 
administrative components have kept pace with the phases of the 
evolution of crime in Calabria." 
  The specific attacks on the Carabinieri policemen fits, he 
said, "into the framework of the 'Ndrangheta's leap of quality. 
The clans, seeing the threat to their own territorial roots in 
the increasingly stringent offensive of the start, react in an 
indiscriminate and symbolic way to the law enforcement services." 
  The commitment of the government to the battle against these 
clans, he said, is "firm and irrevocable" but, he warned, "the 
efforts of the police and the judiciary will not be enough if 
the political and administrative class does not plan and launch 
initiatives aimed at reviving Calabria on the social and 
economic fronts as well." 
  Still on the issue of the stepped-up battle, Mancino also 
outlined the dispatch of Army troops to the region before moving 
on to the anti-Mafia Golden Market sweep wrapped up yesterday by 
the Palermo judiciary and the National Anti-Mafia Directorate 
(DIA). Netted were three Palermo criminal lawyers, four doctors 
and two savings bank officials among the 76 persons named in 
arrest warrants plus the alleged members of what investigators 
said was the "most important hit team of recent years."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Formal Indictment of Secret Service </F>
Officials Asked"] 
  [Text] Rome, 2 Feb (ANSA) -- A request was filed here today 
for the formal indictment of seven top secret service officials 
and employees for allegedly embezzling over 60 billion lire, or 
about 35 million dollars, of official funds. The seven were all 
employed by Sisde, the domestic intelligence agency, including 
former Sisde director Riccardo Malpica, his secretary Matilde 
Martucci, and Sisde's former comptroller Maurizio Broccoletti. 
  The missing money was tracked down through bank accounts in 
San Marino whence much of it was said to have been whisked away 
to South America. Preventive detention warrants were issued in 
the case from June last year. 
  The suspects were released, but further enquiries turned up 
new facts and new warrants were issued. Judicial sources said 
Malpica's had changed as a result of recent testimony. 
Initially, he was believed not have touched any of the money 
himself, but he is now said to be one of the team of embezzlers. 
  The new evidence was said to have come in particular from 
Broccoletti, who was taken into custody on June 25 and whose 
testimony claimed that Interior Ministers over 10 years, 
including President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, were in on secret 
service scams. 
  Preliminary Investigations Magistrate Vincenzo Terranova is 
now being asked to file formal indictments for association to 
commit embezzlement and reuse the money through banking and real 
estate investments.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sama Confirms Payments to </F>
Communists; Strong Denial"] 
  [Text] Milan, 2 Feb (ANSA) -- An allegation advanced early 
in December when he claimed he had been told of an illegal 
contribution of 1 billion lire, or about 600,000 dollars, to the 
Italian Communist Party at the end of 1980s was confirmed by 
former Montedison Managing-Director Carlo Sama here today. 
"It's totally false, and even ridiculously implausible," 
commented Massimo D'Alema, a top official at the Democrat Party 
of the Left, the Communist Party's successor. 
  A statement from the party also denied "in the most drastic 
terms" that any form of finance had ever reached the Communist 
or Left Democrat Party from the Ferruzzi group or late 
Ferruzzi-Montedison tycoon, Raul Gardini, who committed suicide 
on July 23 last year. 
  Describing Sama's testimony as "false, denigratory and 
slanderous," the statement also charged that it was a "good 
addition" to various manoeuvres going on as the campaign for the 
March 27 general elections gets under way. 
  Asked to confirm his earlier testimony at the hearings here 
against financial whiz-kid Sergio Cusani, a key figure in the 
acquisition of funding for the Ferruzzi-Montedison group's web 
of bribery, Sama said it was Cusani who told him about the 
payment, while Gardini confirmed the story. 
  In December, Sama said that it was Gardini, his 
brother-in-law, who had disclosed the payment to him, telling 
him that the money had served to soften up the major left-wing 
opposition party in view of tax breaks for the merger between 
Montedison and ENI's [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] 
chemical interests to form Enimont. 
  Today's Left Democrat statement pointed out that, as in his 
earlier testimony, Sama was unable to specify whether the 
"hypothetical billion" was handed over, nor who did the handing, 
nor to whom: "Once more, he calls as his witness someone who is 
no longer able to testify." 
  D'Alema and Achille Occhetto, ex-Communist and now Left 
Democrat party secretary, admit to having dined with Gardini and 
Sama twice in 1989, but say their conversations concerned solely 
the state and future of the Italian chemical industry and made 
no mention of party funding. The tax break to sweeten the 
Enimont deal never got through parliament, in part thanks to 
Left Democrat opposition, removing one of the conditions under 
which the Ferruzzi family was prepared to pursue the venture and 
helping tip the family against Gardini, who eventually went his 
own way when his plans for the Ferruzzi group to dominate 
Italian chemicals fell apart. 
  According to Sama's testimony, however, Cusani disclosed the 
payment when the two of them travelled by train to Switzerland 
for talks with financial consultant, Giuseppe `Pino' Berlini, 
who handled an important slice of the Ferruzzi family's 
under-the-counter operations outside Italy, including the 
channelling of funds to the parties and individuals receiving 
bribes. 
  Sama claimed that Berlini told them the Ferruzzis had only 
113 million dollars in their account with him, compared to 178 
million the previous year. On the return journey, he said 
Cusani told him of the payment to the Communists. [passage

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Northern League Absent As Liberal </F>
Democrat Pole Forged"] 
  [Text] Rome, 1 Feb (ANSA) -- [Northern League Secretary] 
Umberto Bossi was conspicuous by his absence when Rooting for 
Italy [Forza Italia] chief Silvio Berlusconi forged a liberal 
democratic alliance with the Democratic Christian Centre and 
Centre Union Tuesday [1 February]. 
  In a meeting in Berlusconi's Rome home, representatives from 
the three right-of-centre groups reached full agreement on a 
programme for the winning alliance in March 27 elections. 
  According to Berlusconi, talks focussed on "politics and 
programmes." "I explained to them what I consider to be the 
right and proper solutions for Italy's problems, and I am happy 
to say that they were unanimously approved," said Berlusconi, 
owner of the Fininvest broadcasting-to-construction conglomerate. 
  Also present for today's meeting were Francesco D'Onofrio, 
Pierferdinando Casini and Clemente Mastella of the Democratic 
Christian Centre, and Alfredo Biondi of the Centre Union. 
  The Democratic Christian Centre was formed two weeks ago by 
right-wingers splitting from the Christian Democratic Party when 
it renamed itself the People's Party [Italian Popular Party], 
while the Centre Union is made up of ex-members of the Liberal 
and Social Democrat parties. 
  Widely tipped to enter into an agreement with the 
right-of-centre alliance are the separatist Northern League and 
the National Alliance [NA], the renamed neofascist Italian 
Social Movement, neither of which were represented at today's 
talks. A partnership with the National Alliance was not ruled 
out by Clemente Mastella, who told journalists later that "we 
must give careful consideration to the National Alliance, which 
is a different thing from the Italian Social Movement. It is 
important that we avoid prejudice. With goodwill and generosity 
agreement is possible. We must show that we are able to make 
sacrifices for the good of the country." 
  An outburst, Monday, by League chief Bossi, who said that he 
would have nothing to do with "fascists" or with anyone who 
struck deals with them, was brushed aside by Berlusconi today: 
"I have my own way of doing politics," he told the press. "We 
have had enough of empty words and quips. I have no intention of 
responding to off-hand comments like that." Berlusconi was also 
quoted as saying that Bossi could not go on thinking that Milan 
was his own private hunting reserve. 
  Francesco D'Onofrio stressed that the federalist movement 
would now have to enter a right-wing alliance on the terms of 
the parties already involved: "We have reached an agreement, 
and it is a sound one," he said. "We found no sticking points 
over our political programme, and now we just have to see to 
putting it into practise. The League must be aware that we are 
the nucleus of the liberal democratic pole, that we are united 
and strong."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Left-Wing Pole Emerges United With </F>
Programme Ready"] 
  [Text] Rome, 1 Feb (ANSA) -- Italy's left wing will fight 
the March 27 general elections on a united footing, after giving 
wholehearted support to a programme document approved in a 
meeting here Tuesday [1 February]. "This is a great day for the 
progressives," said Achille Occhetto, secretary of the Left 
Democrat Party. "We have put together a glorious fighting 
machine." 
  Present for today's talks were representatives from the Left 
Democrat Party, the Rete, the Greens, Communist Renewal, the 
Socialist Party, Socialist Renewal, the Social Christians and 
Democratic Alliance. 
  The document approved today "does not solve all problems 
pertaining to government, but it is one on which we can 
construct a hypothesis for government," a clearly elated 
Occhetto told the press. According to the document, the united 
left will field just one joint candidate in each constituency 
under a banner specially created for the alliance, "while at the 
same time maintaining the values of our autonomous cultural and 
political inspirations." 
  The process of selecting candidates will begin tomorrow, but 
criteria for the choice was already being drawn up Tuesday 
evening. Each party involved in the pact will present a 
selection of possibilities from which the alliance candidates 
will be drawn. 
  "The progressive, reformist democratic forces, drawn from 
socialist, Catholic, lay and environmental backgrounds...wish to 
give a precise, realistic, constructive response to the problems 
raised by the bankruptcy of the old order and the ancien 
regime," the programme document said. At the basis of the 
wide-ranging alliance, which stretches from centrist Socialists 
and Democratic Alliance to the far-left Communist Renewal, is a 
desire to "restore a foundation of ethical values to politics." 
  Fears that differences between the far left and centre would 
prove irreconcilable were proved wrong, with carefully-worded 
solutions found even for such sticking points as privatisation: 
"to restore dynamism to the economy, to combat parasitism and 
state hand-outs, we must shore up the public sector but also, 
when the case arises, encourage privatisation on the basis of 
rigorous analysis to evaluate when this would be of use to 
society, and not only on merely accounting bases." 
  The compromises found placated Communist Renewal chief 
Fausto 
Bertinotti who said "the hypothesis of two separate negotiating 
tables, one for an electoral accord and another one on politics 
and government policy, has collapsed. We are heading for 
elections with an exhaustive document, although this does not 
mean that it cannot be widened." 
  Pledges in the left-wing alliance document include one to 
"regenerate democratic institutions," and, in the economic 
field, to "open up new paths for development, while guaranteeing 
an improvement in public finances, an increase in employment, 
and protection for our cultural and environmental heritage." 
Tax fairness was promised, as were shorter working hours and an 
end to an "individual consumist model" and to concentration of 
power in central government. 
  The progressive alliance made no bones about the "austerity 
implied" by its programme promises, but pledged to make sure 
that the weakest did not bear the brunt of this temporary 
hardship. On a foreign policy note, the document stated the 
alliance's commitment to "peace and the formation of a new world 
order based on democratic rules and human rights." The 
progressives came down in favour of a strong European Union and 
of "a society of democracy, hard work, solidarity and tolerance." 
  The document failed to state clearly the alliance's position 
on the direct election of the prime minister, a topic dear to 
the hearts of the left-wing intellectuals grouped under the 
Democratic Alliance banner. 
  During the press conference to present the progressives' 
document, Occhetto claimed that the issue had be "made 
ridiculous" by electoral reform champion [Pact for Italy leader] 
Mario Segni "who woke up one fine morning and ran here there and 
everywhere saying 'I want to be premier'. This is no way to 
carry on." The left must now "make this a serious subject once 
again," said Occhetto, adding that a white paper on the election 
of a premier will be presented at the beginning of the next 
legislature. 
  As a satisfied Occhetto briefed the press on the agreement 
reached, leading lights in other political parties involved were 
also sounding positive about the outcome of today's talks. "We 
would never say we agreed with something if we did not," said 
Ferdinando Adornato of Democratic Alliance, while the Rete's 
leader Leoluca Orlando stated "this is an electoral agreement 
which can become a government agreement, once it has been 
through the essential checks by economic and social groups, 
associations, the voluntary sector and private enterprise." La 
Rete has announced that it will field candidates under its own 
banner, and not jointly with the left-wing alliance, for the 25 
percent of parliamentary seats to be assigned with a 
proportional representation system. The remaining 75 percent 
will be handed out on a first-past-the-post basis. 
  Carlo Ripa di Meana said that his Green Party had given 
"unconditional support" to the left-wing programme, and said 
that vetoes placed by his environmental line-up on topics such 
as a high-speed train network for Italy had been accepted by the 
others around the progressive negotiating table.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Chairman Franco Rocchetta by </F>
Lorenzo Fuccaro in Milan; date not specified: "Rocchetta: The 
`Lombards' Are a Real Force, Whereas Berlusconi Is a Virtual 
Politician"] 
  [Text] Silvio Berlusconi? "Quite frankly, we still don't 
know who he is." Franco Rocchetta, chairman and foreign affairs 
spokesman of the Northern League, answers the telephone almost 
inaudibly from his home in Montello, where he is in bed with 
influenza. 
  [Fuccaro] But do you want an alliance with Berlusconi or 
don't you? 
  [Rocchetta] All I can say is that Berlusconi strikes me as a 
virtual politician. 
  [Fuccaro] And what do you mean by that? 
  [Rocchetta] I mean that from one day to the next, like a 
mushroom popping up after a shower, we have seen the emergence 
of a label called "Forza Italia" on a platform very similar to 
ours. But we are a force rooted in our territory, we have 
deputies who have made their presence felt, and how, in 
parliament. We have been the driving force for change. Can 
Berlusconi say the same of himself? 
  [Fuccaro] Are you perhaps saying that he is a test-tube 
product? 
  [Rocchetta] I prefer to put it like this. It is only fair 
that we should talk to him, and some sort of agreement is 
possible. 
  [Fuccaro] However, Berlusconi claims that "Forza Italia" is 
the top party.... 
  [Rocchetta] Hold on there, opinion polls are not the 
election result. 
  [Fuccaro] True, but there are those in the League who think 
that Berlusconi's sole aim is to take possession of your 
electorate. In that case, how can you reach agreement with him? 
  [Rocchetta] I don't know. For the time being these are only 
hypotheses. We neither bow down to him nor demonize him. 
  [Fuccaro] But they also say that his entry into the fray has 
called the leadership of the freedom pole into question. 
  [Rocchetta] To be frank, I don't think so. Not at all. It 
strikes me as too early to tell. 
  [Fuccaro] Why should it be too early? 
  [Rocchetta] We represent a real force, while he strikes me 
as not a bluff exactly, but a long shot. It's as if Miss Italy, 
in other words the League, were worried because one day a little 
girl, "Forza Italia," might carry off her beauty queen's crown. 
  [Fuccaro] So, there's no comparison? 
  [Rocchetta] Berlusconi, whom I hold in high esteem and 
respect, doesn't have the votes. And even if he had, he would 
have to prove himself a shrewd politician, just as he has been 
an "enterprising" entrepreneur. 
  [Fuccaro] But do you need Berlusconi as an ally? 
  [Rocchetta] For the time being he would appear to be more of 
a potential ally. I'll give you an example from history. Let's 
take the Americans: During the second world war, they had 
allies similar to themselves, such as the Australians and 
Canadians, against the national socialists, but they also had 
the Spanish, who were Franco-ist, the Brazilians, who were 
fascist, and the Soviets as well. 
  [Fuccaro] Are you in the League prepared to line up with all 
those who are against the progressive alliance? And do you see 
the national Alliance as forming part of this force as well? 
  [Rocchetta] I would not talk about agreements with Fini's 
movement. What I have in mind is something that will avoid a 
war between north and south, considering that a lot of people in 
the south have decided to vote for the right for want of 
anything better. We must keep an eye on movements in that camp.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Federation of Italian Socialists </F>
Formed"] 
  [Text] The Federation of Italian Socialists (FSI) is yet 
another political grouping to be formed out of forces formerly 
in the Italian Socialist Party. 
  Those socialists who did not get behind the new course set 
by 
[Italian Socialist Party, PSI, Secretary] Ottaviano Del Turco 
met today at Montecitorio (the parliament building) and forged a 
national political executive made up of Socialist MPs and 
regional officials, deputy Franco Piro reported in a communique 
released here this evening. 
  Not only had thousands of Socialists backed the new grouping 
but even those organized structures which "do not intend to 
sacrifice the identity, dignity and prospects of socialists" for 
those who have always bucked reforms, the communique continued. 
  The symbol of new grouping will bear the words "The 
Socialists" and the first party congress will be held in May. 
  The birth of the Federation of Italian Socialists is not in 
conflict with the initiative which led last week to the 
formation of the Federation of Democratic and Liberal Socialists 
which, together with the Liberals and the Social Democrats, 
forms a larger grouping with which the new party would continue 
to work. 
  The FSI national leadership includes socialists who did not 
follow in Del Turco's train, such as Ugo Intini, Maurizio 
Sacconi, Stefano Caldoro, Maria Magnani Noya, Franco Piro (house 
caucus leader) and vice-presidents Damiano Poti' and Angelo 
Sollazzo.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Formigoni, Italian Popular Party </F>
regional coordinator for Lombardy, by Daria Gorodisky; place and 
date not given: "Formigoni: Berlusconi Must Not Let Himself Be 
Trampled by Those Wanting To Become the Italian Social Movement 
of the Year 2000" -- first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Milan -- Top-secret meetings, discussions, clashes. 
Time is pressing, the hunt for alliances is gaining pace, and 
there are increasingly frenetic hypotheses and rumors about 
agreements among the forces in the arena. If it is impossible 
to unite, then at least an attempt can be made to divide rival 
troops. One of the many rumors current in Milan yesterday was 
of an imminent meeting between Roberto Formigoni -- who has 
been ratified by the PPI [Italian Popular Party] Lombard 
assembly as its regional coordinator -- and [Forza Italia leader 
Silvio] Berlusconi. Furthermore, it was rumored that the reason 
for the meeting was the difficulty of conducting a dialogue 
between Berlusconi and the League. The gist of the message is 
supposedly a request something like this: Silvio, forget about 
the Lombards, and come with us. 
  [Gorodisky] Mr. Formigoni, is the PPI leaving the door open 
to Forza Italia's leader? 
  [Formigoni] I see no open doors. I see only that Berlusconi 
has decided to trample [League Secretary] Bossi. And frankly I 
am surprised. I also regret it -- a friend who has leapt into 
the lion's mouth. 
  [Gorodisky] Are you close friends? 
  [Formigoni] No. We are bound by ties of esteem and the 
affection that all Milan supporters have for the soccer club's 
chairman. 
  [Gorodisky] Meanwhile Milan's chairman has come to an 
understanding with the Democratic Christians, Costa's Center 
Union, and the new Federation of Reformist and Libertarian 
Socialists -- Del Turco's grouping. 
  [Formigoni] That seems to me to be an agreement with 
individuals, not with movements. 
  [Gorodisky] Be that as it may, Berlusconi is no longer on 
his 
own.... 
  [Formigoni] What does that have to do with anything? We are 
a party; we are in earnest. In Lombardy we command 20 percent 
of the votes: Not many people can say as much. We reach 
agreements on the basis of political arguments, not with 
individuals. Politics is consensus. This is not a good 
situation, admittedly. But we have already contributed some 
good building bricks to our new edifice -- Segni's Pact, some of 
the Socialists, half of the PRI [Italian Republican Party], half 
of the Liberals.... 
  [Gorodisky] What do you think of Forza Italia's election 
campaign? 
  [Formigoni] I think it is sad. And it is on television.... 
I watch television as little as possible. 
  [Gorodisky] Are you thinking of standing as a candidate? 
  [Formigoni] That will be decided by the grassroots. I 
declare my willingness to stand. 
  [Gorodisky] An agreement between Berlusconi and the League 
seems to face many obstacles. Might you reconsider conducting a 
dialogue with Bossi? 
  [Formigoni] Never. The League has opted to become the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement] of the year 2000. We tried, then 
Bossi decided to espouse the most extreme wing of the movement, 
and broke away from us. There is not the faintest glimmer of 
hope left. Of course, it is a different matter with regard to 
the League's voters. We know that they are starting to 
appreciate the center that is renewing itself, our proposals. 
  [Gorodisky] The implication seems to be that if Berlusconi 
were to change a little.... 
  [Formigoni] Look, all I know is that he was determined to 
make the center, the liberal democrats, compact, but that after 
two days, there he is, relegated to the right corner. I am just 
watching him.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "National Unity Party Formed"] </F>
  [Text] Rome, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- As of today, yet another new 
political movement has been formed as Italy prepares for early 
general elections March 27-28. A group of professional people 
have banded together in what they are calling the National Unity 
Party. 
  The announcement was made at a press conference called here 
Thursday [3 February] by Raffaele D'Ambrosio, a doctor and 
secretary of the new movement; Franz Ciminieri, a literature 
professor and president of the movement; and Pasquale Ciampa, a 
criminal lawyer and a member of the group's political office. 
There are a lot of people in the country who are fed up with 
the old way of doing politics, the sectarianism and politics 
treated as entertainment, and who instead believe that politics 
is meant to be the maximum expression of social and economic 
requirements, D'Ambrosio said. 
  National Unity has been created as an alternative to those 
that call themselves "progressive" and as a counter to any kind 
of separatism, as the real political problem in Italy is the 
threat of national disunity, he continued. 
  The group's platform will rest upon the defense of the 
nation 
against international specualtion, and the refusal of state 
interference within a framework of social justice, D'Ambrosio 
went on. On the economic front, National Unity is for the 
defense of small- and medium-sized private companies and the 
defense of agriculture as an essential element of the economy. 
  The new party is not nationalistic in a cultural sense, but 
only insofar as economic needs must be met, D'Ambrosio explained. 
  National Unity intends to appeal to all the forces of the 
liberal-democratic pole to rediscover politics in terms of 
national unity and above all, economic unity, he concluded.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tax Reform Needs Stable Government, </F>
Gallo Says"] 
  [Text] Rome, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- It would take at least three 
to four years of stable government to overhaul Italy's tax 
system and make it more equal and efficient, Italian Finance 
Minister Franco Gallo said here on Thursday [3 February]. 
  Speaking at a seminar organized by the CISL [Italian 
Confederation of Trade Unions], Gallo said "If we want to 
achieve serious and efficient taxation, which weds simplicity 
with equality, then the next government must have the necessary 
technical capacity and political backing. This way a `strong' 
finance minister will be able to work, in peace, for three or 
four years." 
  In his address, Gallo also spoke on tax evasion and observed 
how in Italy it had "historic roots" and involved not only some 
sectors in small industry and commerce, but also agriculture, 
which had a lobby, he added, that his ministry has never been 
able to break. "In this field" the finance minister said, "there 
are some 1.2 trillion lire in uncollected tax revenue" and that 
"some value-added tax (VAT) easements are not justified for some 
enterprises which are involved in activities which are more in 
tune with true industrial activities." 
  Turning his attention to revenue controls, Finance Minister 
Gallo recalled how a decree will be issued next week to add a 
further 1,000 auditors to the ranks of the ministry and stressed 
the importance of incentives for his ministry's 
"auditor-detectives." 
  "One should not practice fiscal terrorism by talking about 
`bounties' for tax evaders" the minister said; "incentives are 
more often than not recognition to employees who work harder 
without having sufficient means and often using their our 
transportation." 
  Gallo, as did Left Democrat Vincenzo Visco in his address, 
then went on to criticize those who spoke of the famous "200 
Italian taxes," arguing how "this is a metropolitan myth. In 
reality there are only 30 or 35." 
  In his address, Visco sharply criticised the referendum 
initiative by Marco Pannella to abolish withholding tax saying 
how "this is tax evasion, and the Court of Cassation can only 
reject it...because of its clear unconstitutionality." Visco 
went on to voice his opposition to taxing state paper, also in 
view of the fact that, during the Ciampi government, the 
interest paid on the paper has fallen. 
  Also taking part in the CISL seminar was Giorgio Fossa, the 
Confindustria vice president for small enterprises, who stressed 
how taxation now conditions the lives of enterprises and 
"blocked productive activity with formal controls" and "does not 
honor its debts," return tax re-imbursements in real time.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fiat To Report Losses, Hopes For </F>
Recovery in 1994"] 
  [Text] Turin, 31 Jan (ANSA) -- The Fiat group, Italy's 
largest private company, for the first time will show pre-tax 
losses of 1.5 trillion lire (882 million dollars) in its 1993 
financial report, Chairman Gianni Agnelli told the board of 
directors on Monday [31 January]. In his letter to the board 
containing provisional yearly results, Agnelli said after-tax 
losses may reach 1.75 trillion lire, more than 1 billion 
dollars, although the parent holding company, Fiat SpA, will 
show profits of between 50 and 100 billion lire (between 29 and 
58 million dollars), far less than the 507 billion lire of 
profits reported the previous year. 
  The global slump in car sales, which saw 24 percent fewer 
vehicles sold in Italy in 1993, has brought the Fiat group its 
first negative results since it began publishing consolidated 
reports in 1979. 
  The group in 1993 launched the largest rights issue ever 
made 
in Italy and almost doubled its capital, from 2.424 trillion to 
4.096 trillion lire, giving the parent company financial 
resources of some 5.1 trillion lire (3 billion dollars) at the 
end of last year. 
  Other items of the yearly report, according to Agnelli's 
letter, will not be so bad: revenues are expected to amount to 
53.7 trillion lire (31.5 billion dollars), a 1.7 percent drop 
roughly equal to the revenues brought in by the ailing 
Rinascente department store chain. While revenues of the two 
leading vehicle production units, Fiat Auto and Iveco, dropped 
about 11 percent, revenues by New Holland rose 23.8 percent, 
Teksid 6.1 percent, Prodotti e Sistemi Ferroviari (railways) 9.9 
percent, SNIA Bpd 9.7 percent and Toro Assicurazioni 12.5 
percent. 
  Indebtedness remained very high but, said Agnelli, mostly 
because of investments in research and development. Debts at 
the end of 1993 amounted to 5.5 trillion lire (3.2 billion 
dollars) but thanks to the rights issue the ratio between debt 
and net assets has remained balanced, Agnelli said. Investments 
reached nine trillion lire (5.2 billion dollars), a record 16.8 
percent of revenue (compared to 14.8 percent in 1992) and 1994 
is expected to show improvements thanks to restructuring plans 
and to the launching on the market of a series of new models, 
spearheaded by the Punto compact model, which is apparently 
selling well. 
  Restructuring plans, which include massive layoffs, are at a 
standstill because talks with the trade unions have broken down. 
Meanwhile in 1993 the total number of group employees fell from 
270,876 (of whom 9,531 on long-term redundancy pay) to 261,500 
(9,106 long-term redundancies). 
  The board that today received Agnelli's preliminary report 
was the first since the family's two holding companies, IFI and 
IFIL, formed pacts with major institutions such as Alcatel, 
Deutsche Bank, Mediobanca and Assicurazioni Generali. It was 
also the first time that Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, son of 
Gianni's brother, Umberto, sat on the board as representative of 
the fourth generation of the family dynasty. 
  Prospects for 1994 remain "critical" but the accounts are 
expected to end up even at the end of the year, Agnelli said. 
It is not clear when economic recovery will come but when it 
does, he continued, it will be "very gradual" and with "long 
pauses." 
  In other words, the car market probably will not see real 
recovery before 1996, when sales may top the 13 million vehicles 
of 1992. But this year the market slump should bottom out, 
although investments will continue to be reduced because of 
political instability and a more general "climate of mistrust," 
Agnelli predicted. 
  The chairman then turned to the layoffs which caused a 
deadlock in talks with trade unions, saying that "the adoption 
of painful measures" was necessary to adapt the number of 
workers to falling production levels. These measures, he added, 
"will reduce permanently some structural costs that are no 
longer sustainable and will obtain a more effective plant 
production make-up." Investments will allow eight new models to 
be placed on the market this year, Agnelli announced. Two new 
Alfa Romeo models will be unveiled at the April auto show in 
Turin, a coupe and a spider will be ready after the summer, and 
in autumn it will be the turn of a Ducato transporter, a Fiat 
mini-van, a top-of-the-line luxury Lancia and the Lancia Dedra 
station wagon. 
  Separately, the Fiat textile unit, SNIA Fibre, said it 
expects to end 1993 in the black, after posting losses of 33.8 
billion lire in 1992, and that it will launch a rights issue of 
up to 152.4 billion lire (89.64 million dollars). The capital 
increase would include a convertible bond issue for a maximum of 
34.05 billion lire (20 million dollars) at a nominal value of 
1,000 lire per share, a communique from the SNIA board said. 
  The Fiat board approved a fixed-rate bond issue of one 
trillion lire (588 million dollars) at 1,000 lire per share 
linked to a lottery for 100 Fiat Coupe and 100 Fiat Punto 
models. Rates for the 10-year bonds will be tied to yearly 
yields of the latest 10-year Treasury bonds and will be issued 
by a consortium of guarantors coordinated by the merchant bank, 
Mediobanca, "as soon as improved market conditions appear," the 
Fiat board announced.

Cotti at University of Zurich: There Is no `Realistic Political 
Alternative' to the European Union"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Zurich, 1 Feb (ATS) -- Federal Council Member Flavio 
Cotti feels that the process currently under way in Europe is 
similar to that which led to the creation of the Federal State 
in Switzerland 150 years ago. During a demonstration of the 
European Movement in Switzerland, the head of the Federal 
Department of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday evening [1 February] 
that there is "no realistic political alternative" to the 
European Union [EU] and that Switzerland should participate in 
it. 
  Increasingly, Europe is having to confront problems which 
extend beyond national borders. International crime, drug 
trafficking, and trade and environment policy cannot be resolved 
at regional or national level, the Federal Councillor said. 
  The EU is still far from perfect, he acknowledged, 
mentioning 
a bureaucracy which is still too dense and the failure of the 
negotiations on the Yugoslav conflict. Nevertheless, it is a 
stabilizing factor called upon to play a central role. 
  The future of the EU lies in a structure which respects 
minorities and which functions in a decentralized and federalist 
manner. It is here that Switzerland can make its contribution, 
Flavio Cotti stressed. A greater commitment by our country will 
not lead to the weakening of the Swiss identity. On the 
contrary, in greater Europe, Switzerland will continue to make 
decisions on its future itself. Moreover, it will become more 
sure of itself and more open to the world, he said.

<F P=106> [Article signed BB: "Bilateral Negotiations With European </F>
Union: Coordination Provided by Jakob Kellenberger"; as released 
by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 2 Feb (ATS) -- The coordination of bilateral 
negotiations with the European Union [EU] will be carried out by 
Secretary of State Jakob Kellenberger. On Wednesday [2 
February], the Federal Council gave this coordination task to a 
body which has existed since 1989 -- the Interdepartmental 
Committee for European Integration. This committee is jointly 
chaired by Secretaries of State Kellenberger (foreign affairs) 
and Franz Blankart (foreign economic affairs). In matters of 
bilateral negotiations, Mr. Kellenberger will be given the power 
to decide. 
  No other name was being discussed, Vice Chancellor Achille 
Casanova said in reply to a question. In reply to another 
question, Mr. Kellenberger said that it would be entirely 
possible for him to take on this task in addition to his work as 
head of the political department of the DFAE (Federal Department 
of Foreign Affairs). 
  Moreover, he plans to rely on the Office for Integration, 
which remains and which will prepare the mandates for 
negotiations. In cases of disagreement within the committee, 
Mr. Kellenberger will be able to decide. But he will also be 
able to submit the matter to the Federal Council through his two 
direct heads, Mr. Delamuraz and Mr. Cotti. 
  The Federal Department of Public Economy will conduct 
bilateral negotiations in the economic sphere. In this 
connection, Secretary of State Blankart will regularly consult 
the Consultative Commission for Foreign Economic Policy and the 
Commission of Customs Experts. 
  With regard to the strategy for negotiation with the EU, the 
Federal Council will inform and consult the foreign policy 
commissions of the two houses, as a new article of the law on 
relations between the councils stipulates. 
  Created in 1989, the Interdepartmental Committee meets at 
least once every three months. It will continue its work of 
analyzing relations between Switzerland and Europe. For this 
general mandate, it will continue to be chaired by Mr. 
Kellenberger and Mr. Blankart in turn.

Requests Swiss Support"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Geneva, 1 Feb (ATS) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
wants the Swiss authorities to support reconstruction in 
Palestine and to allow the Palestinian Bank to be established in 
Switzerland. On Tuesday [1 February], during his visit to the 
Arab-Swiss Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Geneva, the 
Palestinian leader reiterated that 12 billion dollars will be 
needed for rebuilding Palestine. The issue had already been 
broached during the meeting between Mr. 'Arafat and Mr. Stich on 
Monday. 
  Mr. 'Arafat spoke Tuesday in Geneva to more than 600 
representatives of Swiss and foreign industry established in 
Switzerland. According to Elias Attia, secretary general of the 
chamber, all of the country's largest companies were 
represented, from construction to chemicals and banking. 
  The Palestinian leader reiterated that his country would 
have 
a market economy, that it would be democratic, and that it would 
respect the equality of men and women. According to him, the 12 
billion dollars needed for reconstruction will primarily be used 
to reestablish basic infrastructure. Forty percent will come 
from the public sector, while 60 percent will come from private 
investors. 
  On Monday, during his meeting with the president of the 
Confederation in Bern, Yasir 'Arafat had asked Switzerland to 
participate actively in rebuilding the infrastructure "destroyed 
by the occupation" in the territories. "We need your support 
and your experts," he said. According to Mr. Stich, apart from 
the financial aid (60 million Swiss francs) planned by 
Switzerland, the talks also centered on technological 
cooperation and tourism.

<F P=106> [Article signed PF/AN/TP: "Wreck Found in Lake Constance on </F>
Tuesday Evening. It Is Identified as Missing Cessna. To Be 
Brought Up on Friday"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Rorschach, 2 Feb (ATS) -- The wreckage discovered 
in Lake Constance on Tuesday evening [1 February] is that of the 
Cessna 425 which disappeared nine days ago. The twin-jet plane 
was identified by underwater cameras, the St. Gallen canton 
police said on Wednesday in a press conference. The operation 
to recover the plane will be carried out on Friday. 
Preparations began on Wednesday. 
  The recovery work will be carried out with caution, in case 
radioactive material is present within the wreckage, a 
representative of the Swiss Alert Center explained. Experts 
from the Paul Scherrer Institute of Wuerenlingen for the 
monitoring of radiation are at the scene. However, it is very 
unlikely that cesium will be found on board. 
<H5>  Prague Rules Out Transport of Cesium </H5>
  Bruno Fehr, chief of the St. Gallen criminal investigation 
department, does not believe radioactive substances will be 
discovered. In Prague, whence the Cessna came, an assurance has 
been given that the customs checks found nothing suspicious. 
Moreover, the two businessmen on board were certainly known for 
their trade in rare metals but not radioactive metals. The 
pilot's partner said she knew nothing of such a cargo. 
  According to Mr. Fehr, in addition to the police and the two 
German businessmen, two Czech women were on board the plane when 
it crashed. However, there is no certainty about that. The St. 
Gallen police are focusing their efforts on identifying the 
victims, the police chief explained. The investigation into the 
radioactive metal and the activities of the businessmen is in 
the hands of the German criminal investigation department in 
Wiesbaden. 
<H5>  No Bodies Detected </H5>
  A camera from the Langenargen (Germany) Lacustrian Research 
Institute transmitted pictures of the Cessna's registration 
number -- D-IEFW -- at 1100 hours [1000 GMT]. However, it was 
impossible to see whether there were bodies inside the plane 
which is lying on its back. 
  Preparations for lifting the plane have already begun, Peter 
Gruetter, commander of the St. Gallen canton police, explained. 
Weather permitting, the wreckage will be brought to the surface 
on Friday. A representative of the Federal Civil Aviation 
Office also said that the Cessna from Prague, which was 
preparing to land at Altenrhein, was due to take off again en 
route for Paris. 
<H5>  Mysterious Order </H5>
  Several aspects of the investigation are still unresolved. 
In 
particular, it is not known why one of the businessmen told 
Altenrhein airport that he would bring a money order worth more 
than 4,000 francs. Moreover, investigations have been carried 
out in cooperation with the Zurich-Kloten airport police, 
following the emergence of rumors about the presence of 
radioactive material in the duty-free goods depot.

  [Text] Bucharest, Feb 3 (AFP) -- International peace 
negotiators David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg expressed "full 
support" here Thursday [3 February] for the idea of carrying out 
air strikes to protect UN peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "Close air support has the full support of Mr. Stoltenberg 
and myself," Lord Owen told reporters after he and Stoltenberg, 
who have tried unsuccessfully to broker a peace agreement 
between Bosnia's warring factions, met here with Romanian 
Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu. 
  He added however, "We would be much happier if we can 
achieve 
the UN mandate without that." 
  Lord Owen, who represents the European Community, said: 
"What has been agreed by the UN Security Council is that there 
should be a close air support" and "that UN forces, when charged 
with a UN mandate, have the right to protection for themselves 
and for carrying out the mandate of the Security Council." 
  He said: "These are air strikes that we'll take primarily in 
a defensive position." 
  Stoltenberg, who represents the United Nations, arrived here 
with Lord Owen late Wednesday as part of a tour of several 
countries neighbouring ex-Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Article signed Ch. Ly.: "Willy Claes in Favor of the </F>
Belgian Soldiers Remaining"] 
  [Text] At a time when some people in Europe are demanding 
the withdrawal of the blue helmets from Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Belgium intends to keep its soldiers in former Yugoslavia, 
Foreign Minister Willy Claes said on Wednesday [2 February] 
during a press conference in Brussels. 
  "On the basis of principles," he said, "I cannot imagine a 
humanist country like ours reaching the conclusion that we must 
withdraw" from Bosnia. "Every effort must be made to avoid a 
new confrontation." 
  Defense Minister Leo Delcroix, who was also taking part in 
the press conference, shares the viewpoint of the Belgian head 
of diplomacy, although the soldiers "must be able to work in 
conditions of relative safety." 
<H5>  Lack of Men </H5>
  The limits of the Belgian mission in former Yugoslavia, the 
two ministers noted, are primarily budgetary and the lack of 
men. For instance, Mr. Delcroix pointed out that the Engineers 
do not have enough men to ensure a full relief of those who are 
in the area of Kakanj, in central Bosnia. 
  At the end of December 1993, a few more than 700 Belgian 
soldiers were based in Baranja, in Serbian-occupied Croatia, and 
more than 300 had been sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. This 
operation is the one which requires "by far" the most effort 
from Belgium in the framework of UN missions. 
  Some countries, like Britain, periodically maintain doubt 
about a withdrawal of their troops in the spring. But in 
practice, those speaking out belong to the political world, like 
the RPR [Rally for the Republic] in France or the People's Party 
(right-wing opposition) in Spain, which are openly hostile to 
the blue helmets remaining. 
<H5>  Butrus-Ghali: We Will Continue </H5>
  Aside from that, the international community seems to be 
resigned to pursuing its negotiation mandate. This was the 
message delivered on Tuesday evening by UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, for whom an "overall reevaluation" of the 
international effort is planned in the coming weeks. 
  Nothing very specific is filtering through from the 
chancelleries for the time being. Reports from Bonn refer to a 
joint initiative by Germany, the United States, France, and 
Britain which would be presented to the warring sides when they 
meet in Geneva on 10 February for new negotiations. 
<H5>  In Brussels on Monday </H5>
  The idea of the three European countries is to involve the 
United States and Russia more. But the state of relations 
between Paris and Washington on this issue, Germany's obligation 
to keep a low profile, the Americans' refusal to play a more 
active part in the UN force, and the Russians' natural alliance 
with Serbia are all obstacles to a new initiative. 
  Bosnia will be on the agenda of the meeting of European 
foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday, the first Council 
meeting under the Greek presidency.

<F P=106> [Interview with Netherlands Foreign Minister Peter Hendrik </F>
Kooijmans by Bettina Hubo; place and date not given: "`Flanders 
Is More Political, the Netherlands More Administrative' -- An 
Interview With Foreign Minister Peter Hendrik Kooijmans"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
  [Hubo] Does Benelux still have a right to exist? 
  [Kooijmans] Originally Benelux was set up as an economic 
cooperative association. In the meantime the European Union has 
taken over a large part of its tasks, to such a degree that you 
could even say that the European Union train has taken over the 
Benelux truck. Soon Benelux will have existed for fifty years. 
For me and my colleagues in the other countries that is reason 
to examine the future of the association. You should never 
throw away old shoes before you have looked to see whether they 
could be used for something. We must examine the other fields 
where Benelux cooperation could be useful now that the economic 
factor has dropped away. I am thinking in particular of 
problems which did not arise at the time when it was set up, 
like environmental pollution. 
  [Hubo] "I am against a Benelux process, because in it the 
Walloons are the Italian-speaking Swiss who paddle on Lake 
Lugano," Guy Spitaels said two years ago, expressing the Walloon 
fear of being pushed aside. Is the present combination of 
countries the most fortunate? 
  [Kooijmans] I have no fixed opinion on that. I do think we 
should realize that we are in a small corner of Europe with 
three countries which largely have a shared historical 
background, no matter how differently they subsequently 
developed. We are also squeezed between a large Germany and a 
large France. In this context the Benelux association creates a 
frame of reference where you recognize each other's problems as 
small countries. 
  [Hubo] At present Europe is showing itself to be painfully 
impotent where peace and security in its own part of the world 
are concerned. Can the small countries still play a role in 
controlling these problems? 
  [Kooijmans] Of course, they can. Take the former Yugoslavia. 
Both the Netherlands and Belgium have many troops in Bosnia. 
That also gives them the right to express their opinion. I do 
not believe that our role is less important because we are 
small. We are not able to solve the political problem. To do 
so it is necessary for the European Union to speak with a single 
voice, which is not the case at present. But to achieve a 
single European position, the votes of both the large and small 
countries are important. 
  [Hubo] While a number of allies are considering withdrawing 
their troops from Bosnia, the Netherlands is increasing its 
contribution by 1,150 combat troops. 
  [Kooijmans] These troops will protect the safe areas. I do 
not think you can say: We are going to withdraw our troops and 
abandon the people to their fate. For me withdrawal is not an 
option at present. Just speculating about withdrawal will make 
the will for peace decline. 
  I am calling for an increase in pressure for using air 
strikes. You should not think of a military intervention like 
in Kuwait. Of course that is impossible in a civil war in a 
country where everyone will have to continue to live together. 
But we must show that we are actually implementing the mandate 
which we have been given, and that we will not be put off by the 
slightest little group of local militants. That is how you can 
strengthen both your authority and the will to reach a solution 
at the negotiating table. 
  [Hubo] The situation has become blocked again. How can it be 
unblocked? 
  [Kooijmans] I think that the United States should be more 
clearly present involved in the negotiation process. We should 
not ask the United States to supply ground troops, but it would 
be very important if the Americans, who now have an observer's 
position in the negotiations, would commit themselves more. 
That would have an effect on the Muslims, who regard 
participation by the United States in any settlement essential 
for their security. That would also have an effect on the 
Serbs. They could hope that a softening of the sanctions, which 
is now rejected by the United States, could become open to 
discussion.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Commissioner Guenther Greindl by </F>
unidentified NEWS correspondent; place and date not given: "The 
Blue Helmets Must Continue To Be Impartial"] 
  [Text] [NEWS] For the first time in connection with a UN 
mission, serious accusations have been made about the blue 
helmets in Bosnia. Why did the reaction come so late? 
  [Greindl] It would be naive to believe there are no problems 
with such large-scale missions, even more so since this biggest 
ever UN peace mission includes countries that are providing a UN 
contingent for the first time and do not have any experience in 
this respect. If, as was the case at the beginning of the 
mission three years ago, the necessary controls do not work 
properly, it occasionally leads to the confiscation of relief 
goods and participation in black marketeering. The temptation 
is great, precisely in such an extreme situation as the 
encircled Sarajevo. 
  [NEWS] Are you not finding excuses for the chaotic situation 
surrounding the UN troops in Bosnia? 
  [Greindl] The UN mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina started with 
support for the relief convoys. But then the following 
phenomenon occurred: Without a specific political mandate, the 
UN soldiers were forced to take over more and more tasks: 
mediating between the warring parties, supplying hospitals, 
establishing and protecting protective zones for refugees, 
taking official government representatives to the negotiations, 
and so on. They were neither prepared nor adequately equipped 
for all this. 
  [NEWS] At the same time, all sides are dissatisfied with the 
UN work. For example, the Muslims accuse the blue helmets of 
standing by and watching their women and children being murdered. 
  [Greindl] Believe me, this hurts each individual UN soldier 
very much. But they simply have neither the political mandate 
nor adequate strength to intervene effectively there. 
  [NEWS] Are the UN troops in ex-Yugoslavia not gambling away 
their reputation as peacemakers? 
  [Greindl] The prerequisite for a successful UN mission is 
that all parties to the conflict also want the mission. 
Moreover, there must be a political concept for the objectives 
to be achieved. Then an area has to be specified where the UN 
contingent is recognized as the only authority by the parties to 
the conflict. In my opinion, all these prerequisites are 
missing in the UN commitment in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [NEWS] The United Nations is being led up the garden path by 
the warring parties in Bosnia. 
  [Greindl] Not only does the United Nations lack the big 
units to force peace in Bosnia by military means, it does not 
have any capacity for military planning. The only realistic 
variant is the one applied during the Kuwait crisis. The United 
Nations entrusts a powerful state or powerful organization with 
the mandate for an "action to force peace." In Bosnia probably 
only NATO is qualified. 
  [NEWS] In 1993, Austria canceled its participation in the 
humanitarian UN mission in Somalia at short notice. Is the UN 
headquarters still annoyed with it? 
  [Greindl] Austria continues to be one of the most important 
countries providing troops for UN missions. Precisely today, 
where, as a result of "peacekeeping," UN troops are increasingly 
becoming parties to a conflict rather than arbiters, the utmost 
importance is attached to our cooperation in New York. 
Precisely for such arbiter roles, small countries like Austria 
are important. On behalf of the United Nations, we are 
currently developing a new training program for UN officers that 
is directed exactly at these problems. 
  [NEWS] Are the Austrian blue helmets fair weather troops who 
are only available for relatively safe UN missions? 
  [Greindl] Because of their training alone, we cannot employ 
our soldiers in any offensive operations. However, we have to 
ensure in the future that we make allowances for the changed 
conditions under which UN missions operate today. The 
preparation time for such missions is becoming shorter and 
shorter and is four to six weeks at most. We should face these 
new challenges with specially prepared units that are 
operationally ready at any time, for example, regarding 
equipment or the establishment of special UN units.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Wagrowska from Brussels: "Partnership: The </F>
Only Road to NATO" -- final paragraph unattributed] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak signed the so-called 
Framework Document on Partnership for Peace [PFP] at NATO 
Headquarters in Brussels yesterday. This means that Poland has 
accepted formally the criteria which NATO set to the partner 
states (clarity of defense planning and defense budgets, 
democratic control over the Armed Forces, readiness to take part 
in peacekeeping missions), as well as the principles of military 
cooperation (such as training and exercises) and political 
cooperation (consultations in the event of security threats). 
The expact program of cooperation must still be negotiated. 
  Pawlak tried to persuade his interlocutors from NATO and the 
European Union [EU] that, despite the cabinet change, 
integration with the West still remains Poland's strategic goal. 
"The Polish nation will not swerve from the road to West Europe 
which it has chosen," he stressed. 
  Journalists' attention, however, was attracted to the fact 
that, while delivering his speech before the European 
Parliament, the prime minister omitted a sentence which was 
included in the text that had been circulated beforehand. The 
omitted sentence was as follows: "...the results of elections, 
held in September of last year, did not in the least affect the 
change in the perspective in which the government of the Polish 
Republic sees its relations with the Union. The highest 
possible quality of these relations is still the priority of 
Polish politics...." The Government's Press Office explained 
that this omission, just like other omissions in the prime 
minister's speech, was caused by lack of time. 
  The prime minister pointed out in Brussels that cooperation 
with West Europe favorably influences the internal 
transformations in Poland. He is trying to advertise 
Partnership for Development -- an idea proposed at the meeting 
between leaders of the United States and the Visegrad states in 
Prague (on 12 January). 
  In his speech to representatives of the 16 NATO states, 
Prime 
Minister Pawlak evaluated PFP as an opportunity to strengthen 
ties with NATO. This opportunity should draw us closer to 
Western security structures. "Poland wants to take advantage of 
the Partnership to maintain good cooperation also with its 
neighbors to the east," he added. 
  Amadeo de Francis, deputy secretary general of NATO (who 
received the prime minister at NATO Headquarters since Manfred 
Woerner was sick) said at a press conference that PFP will 
enhance Poland's security. He did not rule out the possibility 
that NATO may provide financial aid for the partner states to 
facilitate their participation in the program. 
  Waldemar Pawlak expressed his disappointment over the fact 
that the NATO summit (10-11 January in Brussels) did not meet 
the expectations related to Poland's future membership in this 
organization; however, he also said he was satisfied with the 
fact that NATO sees relations between the security of member 
states and the security of Central and East Europe. 
  In his talk with European Parliament Chairman Egon Klepsch 
and in his speech to the deputies, the prime minister emphasized 
that the treaty of association with the EC, which has just come 
into effect, is treated by Poland as preparation for future 
membership in the EU. 
  Egon Klepsch recalled, however, that the necessary 
conditions 
for admitting Poland and other East and Central European states 
to EU are, among others, observance of pluralist democracy and 
the introduction of free-market economies. 
  The subject discussed during the meeting of Waldemar Pawlak 
and Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luk Dehaene was Poland's 
integration with West Europe. 
  Thirty-three percent of respondents to a Public Opinion 
Research Center poll believe that PFP offers real chances for 
Poland to enter NATO; 27 percent are of the opposite opinion. 
The remaining people surveyed either do not know anything about 
this subject, or do not have an opinion either way.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Poland Joins Partnership for Peace </F>
Proposed by NATO"] 
  [Excerpts] In signing the Partnership for Peace proposed by 
NATO, the Polish prime minister launched an appeal in favor of a 
"Partnership for Development" between West and East. [passage 
omitted] 
  "We noted with satisfaction that NATO has confirmed the 
existence of a relationship between the security of its member 
states and that of the countries of Central and East Europe," 
Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said in a speech at NATO 
headquarters. "In my view, this contributes to the 
consolidation of the external security of those countries," he 
said. "And it is also important for the fundamental reforms 
which are being carried out in those countries." 
  Poland, which had expressed great reservations about 
participating in the Partnership because of its desire to join 
NATO quickly and to secure security guarantees from the 
alliance, referred to the need to develop economic exchanges 
between East and West. 
  "While putting into practice the Partnership for Peace in 
the 
sphere of political and military cooperation, we ought to try to 
create a Partnership for Development, a multifaceted cooperation 
between North America and West, Central, and East Europe, a 
cooperation among different structures, governmental and 
nongovernmental institutions, regional and local cooperation," 
Pawlak added. 
  In his view, such cooperation should take place in 
particular 
with the countries which are on the way to a market economy: 
"It ought to contribute to the activation of growth, increase 
the feeling of stability, the promotion of economic 
restructuring, and the dissemination and strengthening of the 
market economy throughout the area of the Partnership." 
  "We regard the Partnership for Peace not only as a means of 
having closer contacts with NATO. We want to use the 
possibilities opened up by the program to maintain a good 
partnership with our East European neighbors," he said. In his 
view, "the Partnership has the potential for becoming a broad 
and practical basis for cooperation among European countries in 
favor of their mutual security." 
  "The recent NATO summit (10 and 11 January in Brussels) did 
not live up to all our expectations, but we appreciate the 
declaration of NATO's openness with a view to developing 
cooperation with the partners and creating prospects for 
accepting new members in the future," Pawlak added.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Estonia became the fourth 
country of the former Soviet bloc to sign up here Thursday [3 
February] to NATO's Partnership for Peace, and used the event to 
complain of the continuing presence of Russian troops on its 
soil. 
  Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik expressed disappointment 
that Russia had not given a fixed timetable for withdrawing its 
3,750 troops from the Baltic republic during talks between the 
two sides in Moscow that ended on Wednesday. 
  "The round was not very successful," he said, because Moscow 
had gone back on its promise to submit a withdrawal calendar. 
But he added the hope that Moscow would stick to its August 31 
deadline for pulling all its troops out. 
  Luik said he saw the Partnership for Peace -- a blueprint 
for 
military cooperation between the North Atlantc Treaty 
Organisation and its former Cold War adversaries -- as a step 
towards full NATO membership for Estonia. 
  "We consider it of the utmost importance that the three 
Baltic countries (Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia) start the 
process of integrating into NATO together with our neighbours 
from East Europe," he said. 
  The U.S.-sponsored Partnership was formally announced at a 
NATO summit here on January 10. Poland, Lithuania and Romania 
have already signed up, and virtually all other countries of 
East Europe have expressed their intention to do so. 
  Most have said their ultimate aim is full membership of 
NATO. 
But the trans-Atlantic Alliance has ruled out any immediate 
intention to take in new members from East Europe for fear of 
angering Russia. 
  The Estonian minister stressed that his country wanted good 
relations with "a democratic Russia," but added: "Only 
countries that are sure of their security can be equal and 
relaxed partners to Russia." 
  Luik said NATO security guarantees were essential for the 
stability of East Europe. He expressed alarm at statements of 
Russian leaders that they have a right of intervention in 
neighbouring countries -- "the near abroad." 
  The minister said this doctrine was impeding the 
normalisation of Estonia's relations with Russia which has 
withdrawn all its troops from Lithuania but still has 20,000 in 
Latvia. 
  Luik noted that Estonia had already made progress in 
aligning 
with NATO standards. The commander of the Estonian Defence 
Force, General Aleksander Einseln, is a retired colonel from the 
U.S. Army. 
  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have announced plans to form a 
Baltic peacekeeping battalion for taking part in United Nations 
operations and NATO exercises. 
  Partnership for Peace involves bringing countries of the 
former Soviet bloc into NATO military and political activities, 
but without giving them the security guarantees which would come 
with full NATO membership. 
  The Partnership involves a menu of cooperation possibilities 
from which each candidate can choose, depending on its needs, 
capability and what it can afford. 
  The options include joint military manoeuvres, peacekeeping, 
disaster relief, search-and-rescue, military communications, 
defence planning, training for democratic control of the miliary 
and the clean-up of old Soviet bases.

  [Excerpts] The Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams flew back 
into Dublin today, straight into a protest by the Families 
Against Intimidation and Terror group at Dublin Airport. He was 
confronted by angry people, who have either suffered themselves 
or their families have suffered at the hands of the IRA. 
[passage omitted] 
  At the news conference, the Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, 
praised the U.S. President Bill Clinton for allowing him a visa 
to attend a conference on the north. But first he was asked for 
his reaction to the news that Sir Patrick Mayhew has a new plan 
for a devolved government. 
  [Begin recording] [Adams] I have to get more information, 
but we all know that that doesn't provide a solution; in fact, 
as part of one of the main elements in the talks I had with Mr. 
Hume, we agreed that an internal settlement was not a solution. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Adams, may I ask you, you went 
to America looking, seeking help and support from the Americans, 
from President Clinton. It really hasn't worked. He actually 
did say, you know, you should go back and support the Downing 
Street declaration. He's also knocked completely on the head 
the idea of a peace envoy. What is your view of that? 
  [Adams] Well, first of all, Charlie, I went to the United 
States because I was invited to attend a conference, which would 
give me and others the opportunity to put across our views. It 
was a rather unique opportunity. I think it worked very well. 
It's a pity that the British Government wasn't there to put its 
views. It's a pity that the two main Unionist parties didn't put 
their views also. So I think all of that worked very well. I 
didn't expect as the result of a 48-hour visit to New York that 
the Clinton administration would change policy absolutely. I 
think they did a very useful and positive thing when they [words 
indistinct] and I have commended President Clinton for that. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Adams, you said you'd give your response soon 
to the Downing Street declaration. How soon are we talking 
about, can you give any sort of outline time [word indistinct] 
for that response? 
  [Adams] Well, I have never set deadlines on this peace 
process. And I think if you, if you watch what has been 
happening for these last few months, you'll see the wisdom in 
not setting a deadline. We're trying to unravel decades of 
conflict, in fact centuries of conflict. We're dealing with 
some very crucial issues. The core issues are being addressed, 
but we need to move it all forward, and I think we have to be 
patient, in the way that (?we're doing it). 
  [Reporter] Yesterday the Taioseach Albert Reynolds said the 
time was coming for you to give the clarification, that he had 
given an abundance of clarification. 
  [Adams] Well, I mean, a letter arrived in my absence, which 
I will have the opportunity to consider within the next few 
days. Well, I mean, I don't want to respond. I haven't been au 
fait with the Irish and British press comment of anyone. I do 
think that Mr. Reynolds has been taking a very common sense 
attitude to most (?of these). I only wish the British would 
follow his example. 
  [Reporter] But Mr. Adams, if he's been taking a common 
sense approach to the issue, why don't you reciprocate, and at 
least try and (?help him) to say yes, we will reach a conclusion 
by some time? (?Is it) not unreasonable, unfair to ask you to 
put some time limit or some time in the future when you hope you 
can deliver an answer? 
  [Adams] The reality of the situation is that each party has 
been given clarification by the British Government on issues 
which they sought clarification on. The party which I 
represent, which represents a quite significant section of 
people in the north, has not been given that clarification. 
Now, until we get that, we cannot give a definitive response. 
  [Reporter] (?Is) the peace process, in your view, advanced 
at all by this visit or are things still the same, you're coming 
back to the same position? 
  [Adams] Well, I don't know what the situation is here since 
I left, but certainly I think that the climate has been 
improved, that here we have a focus, as I said earlier, on the 
issues, on the core issues. A framework has obviously been 
identified of the two governments in consultation with everyone 
else. There's a lot of jockeying going on, a lot of people, 
maybe quite legitimately, trying to sort out their own 
positions, so I think that the last 48 hours have been helpful 
and (?all of it) certainly, certainly no harm has been done. 
But I also think there are some parts of the British, you know, 
establishment think that they still rule the world. They're not 
content with interfering in Irish affairs, but they want to 
interfere in North American affairs also. But more importantly, 
they create the situation. Had I not been denied a visa because 
of British pressure, who would have paid any attention? Who 
would have noticed (?a) Gerry Adams going there, had we been 
handled in a sensible way? So I went to the conference, it was 
a good conference, despite the absence of some of the key 
players. And people who didn't know the Republican view now have 
at least had the opportunity, and an uncensored media, to 
examine the Republican view. 
  [Reporter] So, how do you assess the chances of peace and 
maybe an eventual yes to the Downing Street declaration from the 
IRA? 
  [Adams] Well, I do, I do, and I've said this repeatedly, I 
do have a very firm conviction that we are going to have peace. 
The opportunity for peace was never more realizable. I think 
that we're into a final phase of this conflict, but how long it 
takes is something else again entirely, but we have moved, I 
mean we're talking about peace, we're not talking about war. 
(?It wasn't a) conference, I wasn't in the States talking about 
bringing weapons to Ireland, talking about any of those war 
activities, no one (?dealt) with that. We all talked about how 
we end war. So I think it's all moving forward. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Philip Johnston article: "Harliners Reject Ulster Peace </F>
Push"] 
  [Text] A new drive for a political settlement in Northern 
Ireland ran into immediate heavy flak from hardline Unionists 
yesterday as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, returned from 
New York. 
  Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, has 
indicated 
he will publish proposals within the next fortnight to devolve 
power to the province and set up cross-border policy bodies. 
  But Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic 
Unionists, said any new arrangements based on the principles of 
the Downing Street declaration on Northern Ireland were 
unacceptable. 
  In the Commons, Mr Major said progress on a political 
settlement would not wait upon Sinn Fein which has yet to 
respond to the invitation to join talks. 
  He confirmed that ideas designed to give "focus and 
direction" to the talks process would be brought forward soon, 
despite signs of a rift with Dublin over the timing of the 
initiative. 
  Mr Major took his first public opportunity to denounce the 
propaganda campaign waged by Mr Adams on his trip to America. 
  "I don't believe people in Britain or in Ireland have been 
deceived by Adams's performance," he said. The way to peace in 
Northern Ireland was "in Gerry Adams's hands and I believe he 
could and should do it," Mr Majo added . 
  On his return to Dublin, Mr Adams again declined the 
opportunity to announce a permanent cessation of violence. 
However, he said "we are now in the final phase of this 
conflict" -- a message which observers took to be directed at 
the IRA rather than the Government. 
  Following Mr Adams's visit to New York, the Government has 
decided to try to wrest the initiative from Sinn Fein. But the 
initial response from the Democratic Unionists was hostile, if 
predictable. 
  Mr Robinson said on BBC radio: "The whole constitutional 
position of Northern Ireland has been transformed. 
  "The self-determination of the people of Northern Ireland 
has 
been handed away from it being vested entirely with the people 
of Northern Ireland to the whole of the people of the island of 
Ireland." 
  The DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] response demonstrates 
how 
difficult it will be to make any progress in the foreseeable 
future and there were indications that Dublin is not convinced 
that the time is right for Sir Patrick to table his proposals. 
  Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's Foreign Minister, said he trusted 
that the initiative would be directed towards the achievement of 
the objectives the governments had jointly set themselves. 
  Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist SDLP 
[Social Democratic Labour Party], maintained it was clear from 
what Mr Adams had said in America that Sinn Fein "does not 
accept the principle of self-determination based on consent."

<F P=106> [George Jones article: "The Feuding Has To Stop, Major Tells </F>
Tory MP's"] 
  [Text] Mr Major sought to bolster his leadership last 
night with an impassioned appeal to Tory MPs to stop their 
feuding which, he said, could result in the Tories being thrown 
out of offlce at the next election. 
  He served notice that ministers whose personal or political 
behaviour fell below acceptable standards would be asked to 
resign immediately and not try to ride out unfavourable 
publicity. 
  Mr Major said the Government's "good news" message on the 
economy was being drowned out by the trivia, artificial rows, 
disagreements and divisions within the party. 
  The party must transcend personal ambitions and feelings. In 
future he would put concern "for the country and party before 
the personal feelings of others." 
  His appeal for unity came as the latest Gallup poll, 
published in THE DAILY TELEGRAPH today, showed that the 
so-called sleaze factor -- the recent spate of personal and 
political scandals involving Tory politicians -- was beginning 
to damage the party's standing with the voters. 
  According to the poll nearly two-thirds of voters -- 
including more than a quarter of Tory supporters -- believe "the 
Conservatives these days give the impression of being very 
sleazy and disreputable." 
  Mr Major, exasperated by weeks of internal bickering and 
sniping at his leadership, stepped up his efforts to reassert 
his authority by making a direct appeal to the backbench 1922 
Committee. 
  It followed his rebuff on Monday [31 January] for leaders of 
the right-wing 92 Group of MPs who had been pressing for a 
Cabinet reshuffle. They were shown the door after two minutes. 
  Usually the party leader delivers an end-of-term message to 
the troops, and Mr Major's decision to address MPs last night 
was a direct response to calls for him to "take a grip" on his 
party. 
  He told them: "The sniping has to stop. The feuding has to 
stop. The squandering of energies on petty factionalism has to 
stop. 
  "We have to unite and fight for what we all believe in. That 
means self-discipline, hard work, back to the basics of politics 
with a vengeance." 
  He went on: "I am not prepared to stand quietly by and see 
our party squander its power and lose its opportunity for good." 
  Mr Major rounded on those he accused of criticising him 
behind his back. "I do not flinch from criticism but I would 
rather have it direct than anonymously, face-to-face rather than 
behind the hand." 
  There was laughter when he added: "I will stop reading the 
papers if you will stop talking to them." 
  In what will be seen as a warning that such feuding could 
cost the Tories the next election, he said he had never been in 
Opposition but he believed it would be "miserable and 
frustrating." 
  His tough talking delighted most Tory MPs, anxious to be 
given a lead after several weeks in which the Government has 
been blown off course. 
  He was given a two-minute standing ovation. Mr Tom King, 
former Defence Secretary, said it was just what the party needed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Dublin's Responsibility"] </F>
  [Text] The risk with bold initiatives is that if they go 
awry they are apt to leave their promoters worse off than 
before. That is not to argue that the British and Irish 
governments should not have put forward the Downing Street 
Declaration on Northern Ireland. The province's problems are 
such that any well-based and well-intentioned attempt to 
overcome them should command a sympathetic and patient hearing. 
But the Ulster impasse is so intractable that the risk of 
failure is always likely to outweigh the prospects of success. 
  It is still too early to say that the declaration has failed 
completely in its main aim of persuading Sinn Fein and the IRA 
to renounce violence and enter the normal political process. 
The Republican high command appears genuinely tempted by the 
opportunity it offers it to get off the treadmill of violence on 
which it is trapped. On Wednesday [2 February] in these pages 
Paul Vallely reported on the mood among Sinn Fein activists 
across the province as they debated their response. A majority 
seemed to favour acceptance. But Sinn Fein, of course, has 
little inherent respect for majorities. In an organisation that 
accords more weight to the Armalite than the ballot box, and in 
which death at the hands of one's colleagues is an ever-present 
possibility, even a majority of 75 per cent is not necessarily 
conclusive. In these circumstances it could be very many months 
before the Sinn Fein/IRA leadership is ready to risk any move, 
for or against the declaration. For Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn 
Fein leader, this prevarication is anyway paying handsome 
dividends. Not only has it enabled him to claim a specious aura 
of political respectability, but he also hopes it will now 
elicit either concessions from London and Dublin (in which case 
the Republicans will have effectively entered negotiations 
without having to renounce violence) or gain him what amounts to 
a veto on all other political activity in the province while 
Sinn Fein and the IRA make up their minds. 
  Either scenario is clearly intolerable for the rest of 
Northern Ireland, for London and for Dublin. The problem that 
immediately faces the two governments is how, having failed to 
impose a deadline earlier, they now respond. As a stratagem for 
putting pressure on Mr Adams, the intention of Sir Patrick 
Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, to table outline 
proposals on devolution and ways of increasing co-operation with 
the Republic, and to restart his bilateral talks with the 
province's parties, looks weak. Coming just as the Sinn Fein 
leader steps off the plane from America, the announcement smacks 
of panic. And since both governments are agreed that the 
declaration will stay on the table, it is likely to be seen as 
at best a stop-gap. 
  Faced with Sinn Fein's snubs and prevarications, however, it 
is important that Sir Patrick's initiative be given as much 
credibility as possible. A great deal will now depend on 
Dublin. When both the Sunningdale and Anglo-Irish accords ran 
into trouble, its interest in the province waned. Now that the 
declaration shows signs of going the same way, Dublin must not 
be allowed to wash its hands for a third time. Up to now it has 
invariably cast itself as the champion of the nationalist SDLP 
[Social Democratic Labour Party] and its leader Mr John Hume. 
In the wake of the declaration, a more dispassionate stance 
would be more constructive. Dublin should vigorously reassure 
the Unionists, with action as well as words, that it is not in 
Mr Hume's pocket and that it takes their concerns as seriously 
as it does the Nationalists'. It must make clear to the SDLP 
that they should take seriously British efforts to make 
political progress within the province. This time Dublin must 
stand shoulder to shoulder with London, otherwise the 
declaration will surely fail.

  [Text] The United States government is holding up efforts 
to open up the skies and bring lower air fares for travellers, 
John MacGregor, the Transport Secretary, said yesterday. 
  He told the Commons Transport Select Committee that Britain 
is keen to give U.S. airlines freedom to fly into regional 
airports. In return, Britain wants greater access to U.S. 
destinations. "We have offered an immediate lifting of all 
restrictions on services to all airports in the UK except 
Heathrow and Gatwick," Mr MacGregor said. 
  "I very much regret that we have not had a positive response 
from the United States to these proposals. Nor, indeed, have 
they been able to agree a date for talks to resume," he added. 
  American airlines argue that Heathrow and Gatwick are what 
they want because of their strategic value as a hub to the rest 
of Europe.

  [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN)--Federal Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has called for the maintenance of Bundeswehr troop 
strength at 370,000 men. Kinkel told the Cologne newspaper 
EXPRESS (Friday [4 February] edition) that he recognized the 
financial difficulties and the concerns of Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe. However, in his view it is "imperative to 
maintain" a troop strength of 370,000 men. If the Bundeswehr is 
reduced any further, it would be difficult, sooner or later, to 
meet the constitutional obligation to meet defense requirements, 
he explained. "We must establish what sort of troop strength we 
need for which tasks, and then money can be discussed. It should 
not be the other way round, under the motto `How much money do 
we have, and how many soldiers can we afford on that.'" 
  Regarding plans by the defense minister not to take part in 
any more international UN missions on cost grounds, Kinkel said 
that if the United Nations should ask the German Government to 
participate in another mission such as Somalia this year, "we 
cannot say no from the start on cost grounds." Such a request 
must be thoroughly considered on an individual basis and in the 
light of the constitutional situation and all the circumstances 
involved.

<F P=106> ["ub"-attributed report: "Kinkel: Germany Will Stand By Its </F>
Duties"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The demand by the United States Senate that 
Germany should participate without restrictions in future UN 
military missions was received favorably by the Federal 
Government. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG that even "our best friends" are saying it is high time 
for German foreign policy to be "fully capable of acting." 
After all, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], which 
has been blocking the necessary constitutional change, also 
speaks out for a permanent seat in the Security Council. But 
this cannot be achieved, if Germany wants to play a special 
role. The Social Democrats, on the other hand, are warning 
Kinkel not to pay too high a price. The foreign minister "wants 
to get into boots that are too big for him by all means," SPD 
Manager Guenter Verheugen said. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping 
wants to comment on the matter at the Military Defense Meeting 
in Munich on Saturday [5 February]. 
  Kinkel told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that the resolutions of the 
U.S. Senate are in accord with what he hears from the 
administration in Washington. A talk he had with UN Ambassador 
Madeleine Albright has confirmed his impression that the Clinton 
administration is in favor of Germany holding a permanent seat 
in the UN Security Council, but that it expects Germany to be 
fully capable of acting. London and Paris have changed over to 
those in favor under similar conditions, he said. 
  "We want to be in the Security Council," Kinkel said, but 
"not with foam at the mouth." This is, of course, only possible 
if there is an overall extension, which includes the Third 
World, he said. Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, with whom 
he had just talked, does not see this any differently, he said. 
Germany only has a chance to get a permanent seat if "it fully 
stands by its duties." 
  Kinkel said it is unfortunate that the SPD chairman, who 
realizes that the Bundeswehr has to take on a new role, was not 
able to get his way at the party conference. He said he is 
calling upon the SPD to end its "blockade." Otherwise, the only 
hope that remains is the Federal Constitutional Court. 
  In resolutions that were obviously aiming at the German 
discussion, the U.S. Senate twice called on Germany recently to 
participate "fully" in UN military missions. Republican 
senators said that if Bonn and Tokyo wanted to get onto the 
Security Council, they must become aware of the link between 
global power and responsibility. Many Germans do not seem to 
have realized that rights are always linked to duties. 
  In the opinion of SPD Manager Guenter Verheugen, Kinkel's 
"very brisk approach" meets with international criticism rather 
than serious support. He said he thinks that the envisaged 
reforms of the Security Council will get stuck "in the masses of 
unsolved problems." The fact that Washington links Bonn's 
application to expectations "that we cannot and do not want to 
fulfill," is an additional aggravating factor. If the ticket to 
the Security Council has to be paid for with the willingness to 
"take part in an un-German, selective practice of interventions" 
by military means, the price is too high. According to 
Verheugen, a "somewhat more cautious approach" is necessary.

<F P=106> ["Ki"-signed report: "Labor Market Plans Under Fire"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The coalition government's plans for the 
labor market are arousing strong feelings: The German 
Federation of Trade Unions (DGB) wants to stage protests against 
private employment agencies. Plans that, under certain 
conditions, unemployed people can in the future be made to 
perform harvest work have been described as a social policy 
"climatic disaster" by the Trade Union for Public Services, 
Transportation, and Traffic (OeTV). The German Salaried 
Employees Union has been talking of a "revival of the labor 
service" practiced in the Third Reich. The Bundestag will 
discuss the package of proposals today. 
  Until now, unemployed people could only be urged to take up 
seasonal work in farming and forestry, as well as fruit and 
vegetable processing, if the wages paid were higher than the 
level of unemployment benefit. In general, however, the wages 
paid in agriculture were lower. The result was that in 1993, 
for example, 180,000 foreigners, mainly from Eastern Europe, 
came to Germany to perform such work. 
  Under the Bonn bill, employment agencies are to pay 
recipients of unemployment benefit "supplementary payments" 
amounting to 25 German marks (DM) per day for a minimum of six 
hours work and DM150 weekly for at least 36 hours work. If the 
total, composed of wages for seasonal work and the supplementary 
payment, exceed the level of unemployment benefit, such work has 
to be accepted -- the work is considered acceptable. If such 
work is rejected, then no unemployment benefit will be paid by 
municipal agencies for a period of three months. In the past, 
farmers associations have been extremely skeptical about how 
successful having German unemployed people performing harvest 
work would be. 
  With this solution, the coalition is, above all, focussing 
on 
the 45 percent of unskilled workers among the unemployed. 
According to the "priority principle," foreigners can only 
obtain a work permit if no German or EU workers are available. 
  A poll conducted by the Dortmund Forsa Institute indicates 
that 55 percent of Germans approve of the plan. Among FDP [Free 
Democratic Party] supporters, the level of support was 71 
percent. As for supporters of Alliance '90 and the Greens, the 
result was a stalemate. 
  Controversy has also been fueled by the plans, backed by the 
FDP above all, not to limit the procurement of employment to 
state employment agencies, but to permit the operation of 
private agencies throughout the country without any kind of 
trial period. While DGB Deputy Chairman Engelen-Kefer expressed 
criticism, stating that the imbalance between the 3.7 million 
unemployed and the 220,000 registered job vacancies cannot be 
corrected "through ideologically motivated privatization," the 
Association for the Unemployed has announced that it will file a 
complaint with the Constitutional Court. The associations also 
says that unemployed people should boycott seasonal work.

Impressed by Gloomy Forecasts"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 2 February -- The resignation from the 
Russian Government of radical reformers Yegor Gaydar and Boris 
Fedorov and the dismissal of their prominent economic advisers 
Jeffrey Sachs from Harvard and Anders Aslund from Stockholm is 
regarded by many as a "tragedy" and as the end of the 
market-economy reforms in Russia. Fedorov even spoke of an 
"economic coup" and predicted that Russia would collapse. Yet, 
German business people in Moscow, who are used to difficulties, 
are not impressed by these gloomy forecasts. They are keeping 
up their -- in many cases long-standing -- contacts with their 
Russian partners. 
  The resignation of former Economics Minister Gaydar and 
Finance Minister Fedorov, and the victory of right-wing 
extremist "Liberal-Democrat" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in the 
parliamentary election are regarded by Andrea von Knoop, 
representative of the German economy in Moscow, only as an 
"additional risk factor in the overall Russian risk." No German 
enterprise represented in Russia has reduced or even stopped its 
activities as a result. On the contrary, her office has been 
swamped by written requests from enterprises wanting to open an 
office in Moscow. Many German business people welcome the 
"certain predictability" offered by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and his deputy, Oleg Soskovets, and their "European 
orientation," which contrasts with Gaydar's and Fedorov's 
American orientation. 
  Last week, the activities of German business people in 
Russia 
intensified despite the crisis. Last Tuesday, for example, the 
Viag-Bayernwerk-Gruppe gave a presentation in Moscow. 
Carl-Wolfgang Sames, Viag adviser for Eastern Europe, said that 
despite all difficulties, the group was trying to gain a 
foothold in Russia, for example in the spheres of energy 
management, the aluminum industry, the steel industry, and 
transport logistics. Viag was planning to conclude agreements 
with Russian regions worth at least 100 million German marks for 
a period of about three years. Under the management of a German 
consortium, metals, ores, and chemical products should then be 
sold in the West and the revenues used for modernizing Russian 
enterprises. 
  The Kloeckner concern is arranging the establishment of a 
"German Compensation and Clearing Corporation" in the near 
future to stimulate economic contacts between Germany, Russia, 
and other CIS countries. The company Linde is planning to set 
up offices in Moscow and several Russian regions in the near 
future. Salamander AG just opened a new distribution office in 
Moscow. It is designed to concentrate Salamander's activities, 
which used to be divided up among various buildings in the 
Moscow area, and make them more efficient. Salamander has had 
business connections with the former Soviet Union since 1976, 
and in 1987/88 established joint ventures in Leningrad and 
Vitebsk. 
  After three years of negotiations, the Henkel group last 
year 
signed a contract on a 39 percent stake in the ERA AG, Tosno. 
ERA manufactures washing powder and detergents and glues. It 
is Henkel's second joint venture in Russia. The first has 
existed since 1990 in Engels on the Volga. Only recently, the 
AEG electric concern signed a deal for billions of marks that 
will go beyond the year 2000 on the development and the 
construction of three-phase train engines. As of 1998, some 200 
engines should be built, mainly for use by the Russian state 
railroads. 
  Siemens is so far represented on the Russian market with 
eight joint ventures, including in the spheres of 
telecommunications and the production of turbines. Moreover, 
Siemens services medical and computer technology. Individually, 
the Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) has applied for a general 
license to carry out banking transactions for foreign and 
Russian legal persons. Should this license not be granted in 
the foreseeable future -- President Yeltsin has suspended such 
activities by foreign banks in Russia by decree until 1996 for 
reasons of competition -- WestLB intends to confine itself to 
foreign customers for its banking deals.
