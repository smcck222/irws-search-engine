<F P=106> ["eli/ub"-signed report: "Europe Threatened by Missiles"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- There is an increasing fear in the Federal 
Government of fundamentalist movements in the Mediterranean and 
of a threat to Europe by medium-range missiles. Reports say 
that Chancellor Kohl will comment on this threat at the Military 
Defense Meeting in Munich next weekend, drawing particular 
attention to the worsening security situation in the 
Mediterranean. The concern is due to developments in Algeria 
and the growing influence of fundamentalist forces in the North 
African states. The stability of the entire region is 
threatened, reports said. 
  According to intelligence service information, the 
government 
thinks that in the event of the fundamentalists coming to power, 
Western Europe could be threatened by missiles of a range up to 
1,000 kilometers within a very short time. It is alleged that 
Iraq might provide such missiles. The Federal Government is 
also concerned about the situation in the Mediterranean because 
of France's obligations in Algeria. French Government circles 
are alleged to have asked Germany for support in an Algeria plan. 
  In his speech at the Military Defense Meeting, Kohl will 
hint 
at these threats, and he will also discuss the situation of the 
Bundeswehr in detail. Kohl is guided by the idea that the 
Bundeswehr needs clear perspectives and that the wave of savings 
must come to an end. During last year's Military Defense 
Meeting, the chancellor ordered a Bundeswehr reorganization. So 
far, decreasing budgets have, however, prevented the Bundeswehr 
reforms from being carried out. 
  At the Military Defense Meeting, Chancellor Kohl and his 
challenger in the upcoming elections, Social Democratic Party 
Chairman Rudolf Scharping, will meet; but there will probably 
not be a direct confrontation. The organizers had planned that, 
as a special attraction, Kohl and Scharping should each give a 
20-minute talk consecutively, followed by discussion. Kohl said 
he wants to talk in the morning and leave after the discussion 
on his speech, because he has other commitments. He said 
Scharping could speak in the afternoon.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Dausend: "Trend Changes: More and More </F>
Move East"] 
  [Text] The direction of population movements between 
eastern and western Germany is increasingly changing. The 
number of western Germans taking up residence in the new laender 
has been increasing from year to year, while fewer and fewer 
eastern Germans are moving west. Whereas 395,343 people moved 
from east to west in 1990, the figure for 1992 was about half 
that. By contrast, in 1992, 111,345 people from the old laender 
found a new home in eastern Germany --that is, almost three 
times as many as two years ago. 
  In the first half of last year, this trend gained in 
momentum. By the end of May 1993, the Federal Office of 
Statistics in Weisbaden registered the departure of 75,588 
people from the new laender. During the same period, 55,907 
citizens from the western part of the country took up residence 
east of the former demarcation line. Projected figures for the 
whole year indicate that 180,000 people will have left the east 
and 135,000 will have moved there --the gap is closing. The 
main reason for this development is that many people starting 
out in a career want to begin in the east: "Young lawyers and 
doctors, as well as bank employees, can often make more rapid 
career progress in the new laender than in the west," says 
Stefanie Wahl of the Bonn Institute for the Economy and Society 
(IWG). As a result, urban centers such as the "boom region" 
Leipzig-Halle are particularly popular with those starting their 
careers in the east. 
  However, the number of people returning to the east is also 
continually rising, and that benefits the economy there. 
According to Stefanie Wahl, in the west these people "often 
obtained professional qualifications that they can now use." 
  For one group in the population -- that is, foreigners -- 
the 
trend has already been reversed. In the first five months of 
last year, 5,769 foreigners moved from the east to the west, and 
6,177 moved to the east.

  [Text] The prime minister has invited German businessmen 
to invest in India. Addressing the Indo-German Economic 
Conference in Bonn today, Mr. Narasimha Rao described the 
industrial climate in the country as extremely good and 
favorable for investment. Making it clear that his government 
has absolutely no hesitation in going ahead with the economic 
liberalization process, Mr. Rao asserted that India will step up 
the reform process. He assured the German industry that there 
will be no constraints coming in the way. He added that 
constraints if any will be resolved by him and the German 
chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl. 
  Opening the conference, the chancellor, Dr. Kohl, assured 
India of all possible assistance for the development of the 
industrial and technological cooperation. He said the economic 
policies of India are on the right path. He told the conference 
that India with its reform-oriented economic policy is one of 
Germany's most important partners on the Asian continent. Dr. 
Kohl announced that both the countries have agreed to establish 
a high-level India-German commission for science and technology. 
The president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Mr. N. 
Godrej, asked Germany to remove the constraints and controls on 
technology transfer. 
  Our correspondent, Sudarshanam, reports from Bonn that 
German 
industry has drawn up certain proposals for deregulating and 
liberalizing India's economy. These proposals have been 
forwarded to the Indian Government. The Indian Government after 
a study has sent certain recommendations. These are being 
examined to strengthen the economic and trade cooperation. Our 
correspondent understands that a German festival in India will 
be held as soon as possible. 
  Mr. Rao was given a formal ceremonial welcome in the 
forecourt of the Federal Chancellor's Office at Bonn. Mr. Rao 
inspected a guard of honor by the German Air Force. 
  Here is a report from our special correspondent A. 
Karuppaswamy: [Begin Karuppaswamy recording] The opening of the 
first India-German economic conference in Bonn by the German 
chancellor and Mr. Narasimha Rao is another successful step 
towards the India-German cooperation. The event follows the 
successful dialogue between Indian and German industrialists 
since the prime minister's last visit in 1991. The exchange of 
view and suggestions between the two delegates at the conference 
largely reflects the compelling necessity of both the nations to 
come closer to strengthen their bilateral ties in global 
interests. Modern India is viewed by Germans as a very valuable 
strategic partner in economic and scientific development because 
of India's ongoing reform-oriented economic policies aimed at 
liberalization offering one of the biggest markets in Asia. [end 
recording] 
  That was a report from our special correspondent in Bonn. 
  Earlier, Mr. Narasimha Rao held talks with the German 
minister for economic cooperation and development, Mr. 
Carl-Dieter Sprangar, and reaffirmed India's commitment to 
closer cooperation with Germany. Mr. Rao also told German 
leaders that New Delhi is keen on enhanced trade and investment 
flow from Germany. 
  Germany has assured India that it will continue to take a 
neutral stance on the Kashmir issue. Kashmir figured 
prominently in the talks between the prime minister and the 
German leaders in Bonn. Mr. Narasimha Rao explained the 
problems faced by India because of Pakistan's abetment of 
terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. He said, Pakistan is 
deliberately creating conditions to obstruct a meaningful 
dialogue.

  [Text] India and Germany have agreed to take all necessary 
steps to boost India-German cooperation in industrial and 
technical fields. The two countries have agreed to set up an 
India-Germany joint mechanism to monitor progress in scientific 
cooperation. An official spokesman summing up the prime 
minister's visit to Bonn said both the countries have also 
agreed to review the avoidance of double taxation treaty and 
pursue efforts to sign bilateral investment guarantees. Our 
correspondent Sudarshnam reports from Bonn: 
  [Begin Sudarshnam recording] The Federation of German 
Industry and India-German Chamber of Commerce have sent 54 
proposals to intensify the economic relationship between the two 
countries. These relate to general and financial issues, 
pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, private sector and air 
traffic. As many as 40 ministries and departments in India 
examined these proposals. Several of these have been 
implemented. Decision in respect of some are awaited. [end 
recording] 
  In another development, leading political parties of Germany 
have assured India that the New Asia concept initiated by 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl making India as a target country for 
intensified bilateral cooperation will be honored whichever 
party comes to power in this year's German elections. The 
assurance was conveyed to the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha 
Rao, when important German political leaders called on him in 
Bonn yesterday. An official spokesman said that there is a 
multiparty support to Chancellor Kohl's New Asia concept, as 
Germany has willingly recognized that Japan, China and India in 
Asia will be important political and economic powers in the 
years to come. The chief of the German Agency for Aid has 
shown his willingness to open a second window for soft credit to 
finance infrastructure projects in India. The projects include 
power and telecommunications sector. Meanwhile, the minister 
of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, who is 
accompanying the prime minister, has reiterated India's 
willingness to improve bilateral relations with Pakistan. He 
made it clear that Islamabad has no locus standi in Kashmir, and 
it is not in a position to advise India in this matter. The 
minister said India has no problems regarding protection of 
human rights, and it is always ready to be open with 
international human rights organizations. 
  As reported, the prime minister is leaving for Berlin today. 
He will meet the German president and address the Humboldt 
University. Mr. Narasimha Rao is also scheduled to have meeting 
with German business leaders and inaugurate the Indian Cultural 
Center in Berlin. On Sunday [6 February], Mr. Narasimha Rao is 
returning home. Our correspondent Karuppaswamy reports that his 
meeting with German indologists and business leaders will be 
continuation of his earlier exprience in Bonn to reassure 
Germans that the reform process in India is irreversible. The 
visit of the prime minister is the first official visit from 
India to the reunited Berlin -- the upcoming capital of the 
united Germany.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
expressed great regret over the resignation of Education 
Minister Rainer Ortleb. Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said 
this evening that the chancellor had, however, expressed 
understanding for the health reasons "that forced Professor 
Ortleb to give up his ministerial office." In his three years 
as minister, Ortleb has played a major part in dealing with the 
changes in the education system that came about as a result of 
German unification. 
  In particular, he played a successful role in the renewal 
and 
rebuilding of the higher education system in the eastern states, 
the statement goes on to say. Ortleb has shown great commitment 
in introducing his experience and the concerns of the eastern 
states into the German Government's work. The chancellor 
thanked Ortleb for his achievements as a member of the cabinet 
and expressed the hope that he would continue to play a part in 
politics using his expertise and experience.

  [Excerpts] Paris, Feb 3 (AFP) -- The UN Security Council 
should consider imposing sanctions against North Korea for its 
continued refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear sites, the 
French Foreign Ministry said Wednesday [2 February]. 
  "We note that there has been no progress in discussions 
between the United States and North Korea concerning a 
resumption of inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) and we think the issue of sanctions should be 
taken up before the Security Council," Foreign Ministry 
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said. 
  Pyongyang, which is suspected of developing nuclear weapons, 
has been refusing to allow IAEA inspections of two key nuclear 
sites since last February, despite repeated international 
pressure. [passage omitted] 
  Although North Korean negotiators agreed last month in 
principle to allow the inspections, no accord has been reached 
on the terms of how the inspections will be carried out.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 3 (AFP) -- France launched a 10-point 
trade initiative to increase the share of Asian trade from 7 
percent to 10 percent of French exports, on Thursday [3 
February]. 
  Opening the offensive, Industry and Trade Minister Gerard 
Longuet said that a French business centre for small and 
medium-sized companies would be set up soon in Singapore. He 
also unveiled projects for outline investment deals in Asia 
between French interests and various Asian countries. 
  The activity of the French Foreign Trade Ministry in the 
region was to be tripled during the next three years. 
  Financial support, particularly in the form of insurance for 
the prospection of markets and for trade fairs, would be 
orientated mainly towards Southeast Asia. 
  The number of French trade exhibitions would be increased as 
would efforts to make known French products. 
  French companies, with few exceptions, began to take an 
interest in Asia only from 1990 after having concentrated their 
attention on the United States. 
  They hold only 2 percent of the Asian market. German 
interests hold more than twice this. U.S. interests hold more 
as in many cases do the British, and in some places the Italians. 
  Longuet said that direct French investment was also low, 
representing 0.7 percent to 2.5 percent. 
  Longuet, taking a cautious approach in the light of visits 
to 
the region, has set a target of increasing the share of exports 
to Asia as a proportion of all French exports from 7 percent to 
10 percent within five years. 
  This is equivalent to increasing the market share in Asia to 
about 3 percent. Elsewhere in the world France holds an average 
market share of about 6 percent. 
  The outcome will depend much on what happens in China which 
last year imported goods worth more than 100 billion dollars. 
  Longuet did not provide figures for a new aid arrangement 
which France is to make available to China following an 
interruption lasting a year caused by Chinese discontent at the 
sale by France of arms to Taiwan. 
  The arrangement will provide finance for projects by French 
companies in China.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Michel Lamy: "Juppe Hopes To Obtain </F>
European Code of Good Conduct From Athens"] 
  [Text] Today marks the first official meeting in Athens 
between the French foreign minister and the European Union 
Presidency. The risks of "skidding" off course appear to be 
diminishing. 
  How can a country so far removed from the diplomatic and 
economic criteria of the European Community serve as a center of 
initiatives during its Presidency of the European Union? During 
an official visit to Athens today, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
would like to be given some assurances. Admittedly, the strong 
anxiety prevalent in Brussels regarding the six-month term of 
Greek administration has diminished somewhat. 
  After several explosive statements -- aimed primarily at 
German Chancellor Kohl -- the government under Andreas 
Papandreou is now displaying a spirit of conciliation. 
  Greece must serve as a "bridge" between the Balkans and the 
Twelve, assured newly elected Socialist Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou on 23 October 1993 during his inaugural speech before 
the Parliament. Words, uttered in the wake of an impassioned 
electoral campaign, matched by statements on the "defense of 
national integrity and the consolidation of Hellenism." Which 
ultimately boils down to the Macedonian question, and the 
quarrel regarding the name of the Republic of Skopje. The 
establishment of diplomatic relations by the Twelve at the end 
of December, just before the Greek Presidency, will in fact have 
helped to defuse the situation. Andreas Papandreou has just 
announced his desire to resume negotiations with Skopje, and the 
nationalist virulence has dropped a key. The de-escalation is 
such that the conflict has almost deteriorated into deciding the 
question of flags. 
<H5>  On Track for Enlargement </H5>
  Consequently, the pact of stability sought by France to 
stabilize the respective borders and protect the relevant 
minorities -- the conference has been scheduled for May -- 
should be well received. Anyway, Athens remains pro-Atlantic 
above all, and their U.S. ally is particularly cherished -- even 
if only to checkmate Turkey. 
  Joint actions in the name of common foreign and security 
policy are also planned, vis-a-vis South Africa or Russia for 
example. Furthermore, formal accession to the WEU [Western 
European Union], the armed wing of the Union, is well on the way. 
  The main concern in the treatment of more specifically 
"European Union"-related dossiers is enlargement, i.e., the 
candidacy of Austria, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. Athens 
subscribes to the main principle, namely that the Community's 
achievements should be respected. The Greek Presidency also 
intends to accelerate negotiations aimed at keeping to the 1 
March deadline. The only point of friction is the Greek 
Government's decision to create a committee of wise men to lay 
the foundations for the major institutional reform planned for 
1996. Paris fears it will proceed along false trails and come 
up with formulae favoring the...small countries. The "large" 
countries are currently drawing up a strategy aimed at avoiding 
any drifting or impasse. Germany, France, and Spain, which will 
follow Greece with their subsequent presidencies, intend to 
constitute a triumvirate in an attempt to ensure that the chosen 
strategies are continued in the long term. 
  When it comes to the respective interests of the two 
capitals, Alain Juppe has no particular grievances. The Greeks 
are rather firm when it comes to launching protective 
procedures, and agriculture does not really lend itself to a 
row. So should he allow himself to be seduced by Greek 
goodwill? Alain Juppe will test its robustness in the course of 
his talks. 
  Incontestably, the international image of the Greek 
Government and of its leader is not very strong. When he last 
left office, Andreas Papandreou left behind a virtually bankrupt 
country, merrily flouting any budgetary discipline. Financed 
primarily by the European Union -- the net transfers from 
Brussels represented approximately 20 percent of Greece's net 
foreign currency receipts -- Athens ought to undertake to 
respect a European code of good conduct. At least until the end 
of June.

  [Excerpts] Paris, Feb 2 (AFP) -- French Minister for 
European Affairs Alain Lamassoure denied Wednesday [2 February] 
that he wanted to ensure the supremacy of the larger countries 
in the European Community. 
  In an interview with the regional daily OUEST-FRANCE, 
Lamassoure defended his idea for coordination on policy among 
Germany, France and Spain, which will successively succeed 
Greece in the six-month rotating presidency of the EC from June. 
  "The chances of the calendar mean that the presidency, after 
being held by small and medium countries (Denmark, Belgium and 
Greece), will be taken by three large ones," he said. 
  For that reason "it is necessary to organise ourselves to 
use 
these 18 months in the best way." [passage omitted] 
  Lamassoure said the current system of a rotating presidency 
had the advantage of giving every member an equal share of 
responsibility, but it also did not clearly identify the power 
which should represent Europe out of the Commission of permanent 
officials, the Council of Ministers and the presidency. 
  The French minister said there would be a proposal to remedy 
this in 1996 when EC governments will review the community's 
institutions.

  [Excerpts] Leaving the Hotel de Ville in Rennes, Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur announced that he will meet with 
representatives of the fishing industry. The minister for 
[agriculture and] fisheries said only that the meeting will 
probably take place in the late morning. Balladur went on to 
the Regional Council. [passage omitted] 
  At the beginning of his remarks, the prime minister of 
course 
started by mentioning the fishing dispute: 
  [Begin Balladur recording] Faced with this crisis, we are 
ready to use all means possible to come to the help of those who 
are threatened or let down by the evolution of the world and the 
evolution of society. We have already applied this principle in 
the farming sector. We are applying this same principle to 
industrial sectors which are in difficulty. I am resolved to 
apply the same principle also to the fishing sector, which, in 
its turn is also experiencing difficulties caused by many 
different factors. But, whatever the cause, the government 
intends to resolve problems which occur, and we will do for the 
fishing industry what we did for the farming industry. In other 
words, we will make sure that those involved in Brittany or 
elsewhere will have a better future to look forward to. [end

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andjelko Perincic from Rome for </F>
Croatian radio] 
  [Excerpt] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs, who arrived in the Italian capital 
this morning, has met Italian Foreign Affairs Minister Beniamino 
Andreatta, his Italian host. Even though the two ministers had 
talks behind closed doors for more than two hours, we have 
learned from reliable official sources that their talks 
primarily focused on ways of finding a political solution to the 
crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina. It is clear that the 
international community is interested in this. Europe is more 
interested than the United States, on the one hand, and a group 
of Islamic countries on the other, because the latter group 
supports the lifting of the embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Croatian side said, therefore, that we support the peace 
negotiations, but not to the detriment of the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croatian side also asked a question -- 
not only of the hosts but also of the international community -- 
on where Muslims had obtained the weapons for fighting Croats. 
Did not someone give weapons to them, thus violating the 
embargo, or maybe even use humanitarian convoys, Minister Granic 
asked at a news conference following the talks. 
  He added that the figures on the alleged involvement of the 
Croatian Army in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina were fabricated, 
and that they were blown out of proportion with regard to the 
HVO [Croatian Defense Council]. 
  Italian Minister Andreatta said at the news conference that, 
in line with EU [European Union] policy, his country was 
insisting on a negotiated solution. He added that all three 
sides should display more goodwill and that it was necessary to 
achieve a territorial demarcation as soon as possible. In this, 
Italy supports the proposals on access to the sea for the 
Muslims and the setting up of an arbitration commission for 
territorial demarcation. 
  Andreatta did not fail to stress that those who are most to 
blame and whose share of responsibility is the greatest are the 
Serbian aggressors, the initiators of the crisis. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Andjelko Perincic from Rome for </F>
Croatian radio] 
  [Excerpts] Mate Granic, the Croatian deputy prime minister 
and foreign minister held talks with his Italian counterpart, 
Beniamino Andreatta, in Rome this afternoon. They discussed the 
development of bilateral relations and problems in our region. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Begin Granic recording] Concerning the problems in the 
region, we spent most of the time discussing Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Italy was interested in the accusations of the Croatian Army's 
presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which I energetically refuted 
and said that, according to our data, there are about 2,000 
volunteers [from Croatia in Bosnia-Herzegovina] -- some of whom 
were members of the Croatian Army -- but there are no military 
units. Croatia is ready to allow the supervision of borders 
between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. Of course, the UN 
Security Council has recommended the supervision of all 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders. Likewise, Croatia is not planning 
any military action in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We also discussed future negotiations with the Muslim side. 
In the spirit of the EU's proposal and possible new proposals, 
which are being discussed in the great circles of power, Croatia 
is ready to immediately resume talks with the Muslim side. We 
believe that the talks will soon take place. 
  It is in Croatia's great interest that all conflicts between 
Croats and Muslims should end as soon as possible. Croatia 
believes that a permanent solution to Croatian-Muslim relations 
is the basis for one of the strategic guidelines of Croatia's 
foreign policy. 
  Concerning the joint declaration signed by the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia, it is 
directed exclusively toward the normalization of state relations 
and overall relations between Croats and Serbs, including 
Croatia's priority, which is the reintegration of the UN 
protected areas into Croatia's state and legal system. [end

  [Text] Pope John Paul II today received Mate Granic, the 
Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, for a 
private audience. The meeting, held in the Pope's private 
library, lasted almost half an hour. At the end of the meeting 
the pope also received other members of the Croatian delegation, 
including Smiljana Sinac, assistant foreign minister, and Ivo 
Livljanic, ambassador of the Republic of Croatia to the Vatican, 
as well as a group of Croatian journalists who are covering 
minister Granic's visit to Rome. 
  It was learned from well-informed sources that during the 
meeting between the pope and Granic discussed the situation in 
our region, especially that of the Croats in the crisis areas, 
and a possible visit to Croatia by the pope. 
  After the meeting Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic was 
received in the Vatican by Vatican secretary of state Cardinal 
Angelo Sodano.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Francesco D'Onofrio, chairman of </F>
the Democratic Christian Center parliamentary group, by Luca 
d'Alessandro: "The Christian Democratic Center Is Moving 
Offices to the Botteghe Oscure" -- first three paragraphs are IL 
GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- The crossed shield [emblem of the former 
Christian Democratic Party [DC]]? No, a divided shield. At 
1930 on a cold January Sunday the defunct DC is distributing 
bread and fishes. At the same table are seated Rosa Russo 
Jervolino, Italian Popular Party [PPI] chairman, and Francesco 
D'Onofrio, chairman of the Democratic Christian Center [CCD] 
parliamentary group. The DC has left not only regrets among its 
orphaned "sons," but also debts, assets, and property. How 
should these be divided up between the PPI and CCD heirs? For 
days it looked as if the two newly born factions were one step 
away from a squalid bar brawl, and involvement in a drawnout 
legal processs. 
  When everything seemed in jeopardy, peace came, sealed 
precisely yesterday evening. The neocentrist minority will be 
receiving 200 million lire as an immediate contribution to put 
into motion the preelectoral machine, with headquarters probably 
opposite those of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] enemy, 
and 15 percent of the assets controlled by the Piazza del Gesu 
[former DC headquarters]. Debts are included. 
  "There has been talk of tensions, dissension, and 
conflicts," 
D'Onofrio told IL GIORNALE, "but these negotiations could not 
have been confronted and managed better." 
  [D'Alessandro] Let us begin with the headquarters. Where 
will the CCD have its offices? 
  [D'Onofrio] I believe that we will be going to the top floor 
of a palazzo in the Via delle Botteghe Oscure. Yes, just across 
the road from the PDS. We will only know finally tomorrow. As 
an alternative we also have the third floor of the Piazza 
Nicosia, the seat of the DC's regional committee. It is 
important to have offices immediately available, hence we will 
go for the solution which can be achieved as soon as possible. 
  [D'Alessandro] And how will the DC assets be divided? 
  [D'Onofrio] We had asked for 20 percent, based on the number 
of our representatives who called for the convening of the 
National Council to decree the death of the Christian Democratic 
Party. The PPI objected, arguing that one should instead use a 
formula based on the number of parliamentarians and that we thus 
represent only 10 percent. We arrived at a compromise of 15 
percent. 
  [D'Alessandro] Were there no other less-complex solutions? 
  [D'Onofrio] Pierferdinando Casini [neocentrist leader] had 
suggested making the liquidation dependent on the outcome of the 
elections. This could have been an exalting challenge, but the 
new electoral system makes any calculation more complicated. 
  [D'Alessandro] When will the rest of the DC dinosaur be 
divided up? 
  [D'Onofrio] There will be an arbitration procedure to 
ascertain the debts and to carry out an inventory of the assets. 
Then the assets will be distributed. 
  [D'Alessandro] IL POPOLO will also be split in two? 
  [D'Onofrio] Yes, if it ends up under the tutelage of the 
present responsible party manager. Otherwise it does not 
concern us. 
  [D'Alessandro] And the crossed shield? Who can this be used 
by? 
  [D'Onofrio] The question of the symbol represented the 
political precondition of the agreement. It has been decided 
that it belongs to both, and this recognizes the fact that we 
have the same historical roots. The PPI is however the DC's 
major heir and can use it prominently. The CCD is however a 
younger brother and as such will be allowed to include the 
crossed shield within a different symbol. 
  [D'Alessandro] If the agreement on the symbol had failed.... 
  [D'Onofrio] We would have gone to court.

<F P=106> [Giorgio Battistini report: "They Are Trying To Undermine </F>
the Elections"] 
  [Text] Rome -- A "dirty game": Someone is trying to 
"poison the wells and to have the election campaign conducted by 
corrupt men connected with [former Socialist leader] Craxi who 
are working according to a specific plan" using "minutely 
orchestrated disclosures" and reports "as spectacular as to cite 
one dead man who is unable to provide confirmation and two 
living men who have already denied it." And this is "just the 
beginning of the election campaign." 
  This was announced 24 hours earlier by Achille Occhetto 
[Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) secretary], who was starting 
his campaign. He was referred enthusiastically to the agreement 
among the eight progressive groupings on using a single symbol 
for their electoral lists. The same words were spoken, quietly, 
24 hours later. And it was immediately apparent that he did not 
expect this cold shower from Milan. Was it really so cold? Not 
at all. It has already been denied. And yet an annoying breeze 
is already upsetting the political contest. 
  At PDS headquarters they refused to believe it at first. 
What? Mr. Sama again? Right now? They did not start taking it 
seriously until mid-afternoon, after a deluge of telephone calls 
from all over Italy: It was like having a fever, with everyone 
asking how do you feel; are you alright, despite everything? It 
was later, as they watched the television news, that they 
started to take Sama's latest statement to [Judge] Di Pietro 
seriously. It then became impossible to maintain the low 
profile that they initially wanted to adopt, confining their 
response to an angry denial from the press bureau, an indignant 
statement to ANSA by Occhetto. Much more was needed, following 
the accusation that has tainted the start of the election 
campaign. An attack on those who are maneuvering, not even so 
secretly. By late evening the roll of drums could be heard 
throughout the capital, and newspaper and television reporters 
were summoned urgently. The PDS leadership was assembled, as 
befitting an important occasions. 
  It fell to Visani to issue the angry denial. Occhetto 
displayed all the incredulity proper to a complete fabrication, 
provided a political interpretation of the operation, and 
expressed his contempt for those who "right on cue, have tried 
to spoil the party for the progressive forces, the very day 
after an extraordinary agreement was reached. But the party 
goes on." [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema yielded to the 
temptation of sarcasm: "Of course they pondered it for a long 
time, and examined things carefully for months in order to 
fabricate this nonsense. Who could it have been? Let me see: 
Didn't Cusani work for Craxi?" D'Alema was the only one of the 
PDS leaders to go beyond an expression of outrage and to explore 
possible leads. The corruption investigation has nothing to do 
with it, and their respect for Di Pietro has not been undermined 
(indeed, "he is doing his job; it is Sama who is telling lies," 
Visani admitted). But certainly "it is a strange trial; it is 
not clear who is being accused. Sama said these things months 
ago, and we have already given evidence. Now he is trying 
again. He is repeating himself, with some additional novelties, 
figures, and details. He must have studied hard in the interim. 
They are rather strange charges: We do not know how, when, or 
where. We do not even know who should be accused, since it is 
unfortunately impossible to sue a dead man -- Gardini." 
  The honor of destroying the Romagnese Sama fell to 
Visentini, 
another, ice-cool, Romagnese. "Why is he now recycling this old 
and clearly groundless story? It is a fabrication, with some 
shameful allusions. There is proof. Dragoni and Tassinari, 
identified as the couriers who accompanied the billion lire, 
issued a denial. Dragoni, the mayor of Ravenna, merely obeyed 
Gardini's request to meet with Occhetto. All the rest is a 
fabrication. The facts are clear -- unfortunately for Sama and 
fortunately for us." His words stung like whiplashes. "Let us 
forget about the remarks on television" (which can do enormous 
damage during an election campaign), "but neither Sama nor 
anyone else can say to whom the money was consigned, where, or 
when this supposedly took place. But the fact that remains is 
the vote in parliament in which the PDS turned down Gardini's 
request to drop the Enimont inquiry." 
  So who is vilifying the PDS, two months before the 
elections? Suspicions were voiced. Occhetto tried his hand as 
a reporter. Wearing his blue jacket and Clinton-style dark 
necktie with yellow squares (the same one he wore on the great 
day the progressive pact was signed), he announced "a 
spectacular piece of news." "An expose is fabricated 
artificially, implicating a dead man who cannot confirm it and 
two living people who deny it. Some scoop. So the real news is 
this: Someone is already trying to undermine the March 
elections. It deserves the loud laugh due to such a macabre and 
grotesque event. As a citizen, together with D'Alema, I call 
for the utmost protection because from now on anybody could cite 
a dead person, attributing to him who knows what accusations to 
the detriment of who knows whom. Beware: Somebody is secretly 
planning further carefully calculated coups." 
  After the statements came the round of repetitive interviews 
for the television networks. It must really have been a 
terrible moment to make Occhetto angry ("No, your question is 
wrongly formulated; it is not true that I am implicated") with a 
Fininvest reporter. 
  The day after the left-wing party was one of great 
irritation. The inevitable question was: Why is Sama lying, why 
now? D'Alema attempted a reply: "I do not know whether he is 
just raving or performing a role written by someone else. I 
judge the reliability of his recollections on the basis of 
certain details: He has always spoken about an imaginary dinner 
with me. Actually, I went one morning, at breakfast time, to 
the hotel that he used as his base in Rome. It may be just a 
detail, but I only had coffee. What can I say? I think that 
Carlo Sama is now very heavily influenced, or easily influenced, 
and heavily involved in some excessively complex affairs. I 
also think that we do not yet know what happened to all that 
money from the Enimont kickbacks. I have seen the figures, and 
they do not add up. There is still a lot missing. And I think 
that there may still be someone to whom he cannot deny certain 
favors." Be that as it may, Franco Bassanini pointed out, the 
PDS acted "extremely scrupulously in parliament. We voted 
against Gardini's request to shelve the inquiry. That day 82 
percent of PDS deputies were present. With regard to Sama's 
lies I would put forward three hypotheses: He fabricated the 
whole thing because somebody asked for his help. Or Gardini told 
him to do so, because he really hoped to soften the PDS' stance, 
and then gave up. Or, again, he did try it with somebody. But 
he was given to understand that it was impossible."

<F P=106> [Article by Seija Sartti: "Least Harmful Alternative: </F>
Elisabeth Rehn Is Neither Sanctimonious Nor a Psychopath"] 
  [Text] Elisabeth Rehn is an alternative for those who have 
no alternative. Those Conservatives who are unwilling to vote 
for Ilaskivi can vote for her. Any nonsocialist who dislikes 
both Ilaskivi and Vayrynen may vote for her. Some Social 
Democrats who would have voted for Sorsa may vote for her. 
  Those who favor joining the European Union, and for whom 
Ahtisaari leans too much to the left, may vote for Rehn. Those 
whose first language is Finnish and for whom slow, clumsy 
Finnish Aittoniemis are not good enough may vote for her. 
  Women who do not find even women's logic in Kuuskoski's 
speeches may vote for Rehn. Any woman who would never vote for a 
man or a centrist may vote for her. Those men who may vote for a 
woman may vote for her. As a defense and equality minister, Rehn 
is a suitable candidate for both majors and majors' widows too. 
  She is the least harmful alternative. Not even a political 
cynic (male) maliciously finds anything bad to say about Rehn. 
  They brag about how Elisabeth is a sweet, nice, and 
sprightly 
girl who is always in a good mood. Men especially commend the 
fact that Rehn is not a feminist. Some women are irritated by 
the fact that the equality minister is not a feminist. Rehn 
annoys many women because she is so feminine. 
  A few, more negative crumbs can be teased out of Rehn by 
picking away at her with a silver fork. Some are annoyed by the 
seductive tone of her speaking style and others by her 
exaggerated calm. Important and self-important gentlemen 
sometimes grow impatient with Rehn who is, in their opinion, 
naive and raises irrelevant issues. With a feeling of 
superiority, these men stress the fact that Rehn is no thinker. 
  If Rehn does not qualify as an intellectual, she is not the 
silly blonde portrayed in the jokes about her either. A leftist 
politician (male) praised Rehn for being the elite of her party. 
The man said that there are a lot of more mediocre male 
politicians in the Swedish People's Party (RKP). 
<H5>  Too Headstrong To Be a Puppet </H5>
  Rehn firmly entered national politics in a conservative 
campaign, but she is considered to be a typical Swedish-speaking 
Finnish liberal. This is not viewed as a contradiction in terms: 
Even the RKP right wing can hold liberal views. 
  It is easier to advance in a small party than in a big one. 
At the start of her career as a minister, Rehn was labeled 
politically inexperienced and superficially informed. It was 
thought that she would become a puppet of the generals to whom 
the big boys would explain a little about affairs. 
  Although Rehn smiles like a little doll, she knows how to 
fit 
the bits of information doled out to her into the right places. 
Furthermore, she behaves in a headstrong way, which puppets do 
not do. 
  From these men's point of view, she has made bad mistakes: 
She has ignored the self-important gentlemen, forgotten the "old 
boy" network, and bypassed official channels -- and there is 
probably no greater sin than that in the Army. They looked on in 
horror at the Ministry of Defense when the minister directly 
questioned recruits about their problems. They listened in 
horror at the Foreign Ministry when the minister spoke her mind 
out of turn to the ritually appointed representatives. 
  And worst of all: The minister began to doubt that all of 
these gentlemen's sauna evenings and expenses incurred as 
representatives were necessary for the defense of Finland. 
  The officers' initial horror changed to enthusiasm when they 
realized that no male minister would have gotten the Hornet 
[purchase] through. Their smiling girl did an incredible PR job 
for the Army and got the Defense Ministry to look like an 
important ministry. Before Rehn, politicians looked down on the 
Defense Ministry because they cannot curry favor by distributing 
money to voters there. 
<H5>  Rare Bird in Her Field </H5>
  Rehn's popularity could not have been foreseen. A woman as a 
defense minister was a small world-scale sensation who was of 
interest to news media everywhere. Rehn concedes that her sex 
has benefited her, but Finland too: The defense minister of a 
small country would not get to meet with such high-ranking 
politicians abroad if she were not "a rare bird" that aroused 
their curiosity. 
  In the opinion of her critics, Rehn has dumbfounded the West 
just as she had the East earlier. As Finland's defense minister 
was cooing with the U.S. defense secretary, those present 
recalled having seen similar closeness between two peoples in 
the past in connection with Eino Uusitalo (the Center Party's 
number-two man) and Vladimir Stepanov (the Soviet ambassador). 
  As defense minister, Rehn has rendered men largely 
defenseless. She regards security policy as her strongest area 
of expertise. 
  In the opinion of some, Rehn was lucky to get to be the 
Army's mascot: At the Defense Ministry she is served and well 
briefed; as minister of social affairs, she would have been in a 
real fix. One of the defense minister's subordinates (a man) 
denied that there was any backbiting: He thinks that Rehn is a 
good boss who can make decisions and steadfastly defend 
unpleasant decisions as well. He thinks that this woman does not 
make a poor defense minister at all -- quite the contrary, a 
better one than some old guy who had served in the Army 35 years 
ago and whose ideas concerning the Armed Forces go back to those 
days. 
  This subordinate also admires how naturally Rehn can relate 
to people without being ingratiating. In the face of opponents, 
she does not remain behind the walls of the ministry relying on 
its defenses. Once she attacked them from her office on the 
square, where demonstrators were protesting arms purchases. She 
vented her anger on them, saying how, as a mother and 
grandmother, she could under no circumstances consent to her 
children and grandchildren's being threatened and that an army 
capable of defending the country was necessary to keep that from 
happening. When the last of the earring-bedecked beatniks was 
verbally disarmed, a couple of spurgu [translation unknown] in 
favor of a strong defense clapped the minister on the back: 
"Good for you, Liz!" 
  When the government convened, not a single party was 
interested in the post of defense minister -- least of all the 
RKP leaders, who would not have granted Rehn an extension. But 
with the final murderous emotions of the evening bargaining 
sessions, the post went to the RKP -- and the post of minister 
of culture slipped out of reach of the party and Jorn Donner. 
  This is one reason why Donner, as a politician, wastes no 
love on Rehn. It was Donner after all who declared that all the 
publicity was going to the minister's head and that she also 
thought that she was fit to be president, although she is not. 
Rehn snapped that Donner is no one to talk of a fascination with 
publicity. Rehn also said that throughout her career she has 
gotten used to the fact that others doubt her abilities. No 
matter whether she became chairman of the laws committee, the 
head of the parliamentary delegation, or defense minister, they 
did not expect her to cope with the job: "A woman is never 
really taken seriously. Everyone is always just as surprised: 
Gee, she really did very well after all!" 
  Nevertheless, Donner is not quite alone in thinking the way 
he does about her. To the annoyance of other politicians too, 
Rehn has managed to incessantly and enthusiastically rejoice 
over her popularity and has begun to take herself seriously as a 
politician capable of serving in any post, no matter how high it 
may be. 
  One of the political doubters (a woman) does not doubt that 
Rehn is capable of occupying important posts, as long as those 
posts are not at the national level. She thinks that Rehn would 
be perfectly well suited to be the queen of an autonomous Aland: 
That way she could realize both the soft and the hard sides of 
her nature and get as many refugees and tanks for the islands as 
she feels are right for them. 
  Another doubter (a man) feels that Rehn's background for the 
post of president is too narrow: Rehn is just a Swedish-speaking 
Finn who does not know the real Finns and who has no contact 
with the provinces. He thinks that Rehn is only a representative 
of a small party who has no network in the official machinery: 
As president, moreover, she would be in big trouble without the 
strong support of administration professionals. 
  The RKP too had doubts about its own candidate at first, 
about whom they probably would not have complained, but whose 
campaign would cost a lot of money. After giving it some 
thought, they concluded that it would be good for the party to 
put in an appearance in the presidential elections and acquire 
Finnish-language voters. 
  But there are only a couple of little things that constitute 
a burden on Rehn's way to Mantyniemi [president's residence]: 
her first language, her party, her sex, her family background, 
and the prejudices associated with them. She has been 
pigeonholed as "Mrs. Rehn of Kauniainen." 
<H5>  Toucher, Hugger, Kisser </H5>
  The local doctor's Lilla was sent from her home in Mantsala 
to Kauniainen because there was a Swedish-language coed school 
there. Later, the Rehns also bought a house in Kauniainen, but 
they have not lived there for years, and Mrs. Rehn does not 
represent the typical "lady of the house." 
  When they lost everything when the family firm went 
bankrupt, 
the high society lady could not afford to appear in public. Rehn 
also remembers having held down two jobs, as women do: She 
looked after her home and worked. 
  Her job was not purely political, but she is not without 
experience as a politician. She was on the local municipal 
council seven years and spent 15 years in parliament. Still, not 
just anybody takes it into his head to become president. 
  "I didn't take it into my head either," Rehn denied the 
allegation. She assured us that it was her supporters' idea. 
Nevertheless, she is annoyed by the fact that a woman is always 
viewed as being exceptionally ambitious or somehow misdirected 
if she wants to advance in her career. 
  Elisabeth Rehn has been more successful than her husband -- 
and not without cause, people say. However, Ove Rehn knows how 
to poke fun at himself with funny stories in which the "prince 
consort" participates in a women's program of official 
ministerial visits (fashion shows) and receives small feminine 
gifts (perfumes) as a souvenir. So Ove Rehn has already had 
considerable practice as the consort of a president whose duty 
it is to socialize with the ladies and put in an appearance at 
culture salons. 
  Elisabeth Rehn would be a downright magnificent 
representative president. She would kiss and twitter at the 
gentlemen until they were dazed, as she has up to now. With a 
little bit of imagination, we can see her in the rooms of the 
presidential palace exclaiming "marvelous" and "my dear." 
  Rehn admits that she is an extrovert who willingly touches, 
hugs, and kisses people on the cheek. As president, she would be 
neither a quiet shillyshallyer nor a dreaded ruler holding court. 
  She is not afraid of the role of president, nor of its 
loneliness. She thinks that she can make the post look like her: 
The president does not have to greatly distance himself from 
others to preserve his authority. She remarked that she knows 
how to make a clear distinction between when it is appropriate 
to be familiar and when it is not. 
  Ambassadors recognize that Rehn is a master at behaving in 
public (more so than many ambassadors). As for her, we need not 
fear that a drunkard uncertain on his feet (Ahti Karjalainen) or 
a mass of wrinkles hanging onto a bag full of liquor (Vaino 
Leskinen) will get off an airplane to represent Finland. 
  Nor would Rehn make the mistake of pinching stewardesses 
either, although she does love to flirt. A common school chum of 
Elisabeth and Ove regrets that it never went any further than 
that with her either. The guys at school tried to vie with each 
other for the pretty Lillan and the school chum is still sore at 
Ove, who succeeded in conquering the girl on a skiing trip in 
Vuokatti. 
  Both of them were studying in Hankeni when she got pregnant, 
as often happened with mama's little girls of her generation, 
despite the fact that it was definitely improper. Later things 
went with her as is often the case with those who marry their 
early loves. When she publicly confessed that her husband had 
not been the only one, Elisabeth Rehn dumbfounded everyone in 
this country where it is customary for presidential candidates 
to appear to be perfectly irreproachable. 
<H5>  Like Any Normal Person </H5>
  Elisabeth Rehn is viewed as being courageous because she is 
not sanctimonious. We can well imagine her lapping up wine and 
babbling about men at merry women's get-togethers. However, she 
has been readily -- and groundlessly -- condemned for being a 
fast woman: "Claiming that I approve of little infidelities is a 
real whopper." 
  Rehn has merely learned from experience (58 years of it) 
that 
all sorts of things happen to a person in his lifetime and that 
it does not pay to conceal or embellish the truth. Since she has 
also recounted the dirty details of her life, she knows that she 
has relieved her opponents of juicy weapons and reprimanded 
those who have double standards of morality. 
  Politics corrupts many people, turning them into 
double-dealers and paranoids. Some are already completely 
disturbed or psychopathic when they find their way into 
politics. Rehn is commended even by her opponents for being like 
any normal person who has remained unchanged. 
  "Genuine" is also the word Rehn uses to define herself. 
While 
she loves to act (on stage), she says that she despises 
pretension and lying. She admits her mistakes and regrets some 
of the statements she has made. She confesses that she is a 
spontaneous person who gets angry and says things too bluntly. 
  This is why she does not understand why some regard her as 
false and affected. She certainly realizes that Elisabeth Rehn 
irritates other people, but the one who is doing the irritating 
is indeed the genuine Rehn, not an imitation. 
  This ends the series of Sunday articles on the presidential 
candidates.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Rehn Is Now Advance Favorite"] </F>
  [Text] The SDP's [Social Democratic Party] Martti Ahtisaari 
defeated the RKP's [Swedish People's Party] Elisabeth Rehn in 
the first round of balloting in the presidential elections, but 
Rehn is nonetheless starting out on the second round as the 
advance favorite. Rehn got about 700,000 votes, only 125,000 
fewer than Ahtisaari, and forced Paavo Vayrynen and Raimo 
Ilaskivi to drop out of the race. The number of votes for Rehn 
is sensational for a representative of the RKP and for a woman 
candidate. At least in the first round, she broke through the 
traditional barriers of language and sex. 
  As a nonsocialist and representative of the government, 
politically Rehn has a better chance of gaining more support 
from those who voted for Vayrynen and Ilaskivi. These 
approximately 1.1 million voters will constitute the jackpot in 
the second round. The one who captures a majority of them will 
probably be the new president -- assuming that the same people 
vote in the second round. 
  Ahtisaari and Rehn are the same kinds of candidates: Neither 
can be characterized as a dyed-in-the-wool politician; evidently 
that is just why they came up winners in the elections. It is 
also hard to imagine them violently clashing in the debate. More 
likely is the danger that the election campaign will put people 
to sleep as they embrace each other unarmed. 
  There are few substantial differences between them as to 
policy lines. Both are, for example, supporters of membership in 
the EU [European Union]. The most important difference involves 
economic policy, and Ahtisaari plans to emphasize that in his 
campaign. But will it influence the outcome? The economy did not 
give Ilaskivi a boost, nor did factual issues otherwise decide 
the elections, as the amazingly small number of opponents of the 
EU shows. The appeal of the person and the image was much 
greater. 
  Rehn was the only candidate to pick up votes across party 
lines. Of the top four candidates, Ahtisaari and Ilaskivi were 
below the limit of support for their parties and Vayrynen only 
barely exceeded it. Rehn's popularity is over four times as 
great as typical support for the RKP. 
  In accordance with a decision made in advance, the Left 
Alliance will support Ahtisaari in the second round of 
balloting, but offhand it is hard for him to count on other 
important vote shifts as being in the bag. The combined votes of 
the Left Alliance are not enough for him to win. Ahtisaari would 
need more votes from the right of the political centerline, but 
he is in danger of being labeled a Left Alliance candidate. 
Right now Rehn evidently better meets the conditions for public 
acceptability. 
  Since the forecasts have been completely reversed during the 
campaign, nothing will be for sure for three weeks to come. Rehn 
received some of her support for tactical reasons: People voted 
for her so that Vayrynen and Ilaskivi would not be able to 
continue the race. Will these tactical voters continue to back 
Rehn? And how will the fact that only one of the three big 
parties got its candidate into the final round affect the 
outcome? Will it lower active participation in the vote? 
  In addition to Rehn, the other sensation in the elections 
was 
the fate of Vayrynen. He obviously campaigned more fiercely than 
anyone ever did before in Finland, but it did not get him into 
the final round. Vayrynen was tripped up by Keijo Korhonen. 
Relatively and absolutely, Vayrynen garnered fewer votes than he 
did in 1988. The fact that the post of president may have 
finally floated out of reach for him adds to the bitterness of 
his defeat. At least he can no longer regard himself as the 
Center Party's logical candidate for the presidency.

  [Excerpts] Norway wants to increase Nordic cooperation on 
the agricultural problems faced in the EU [European Union] 
negotiations. Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland 
had talks on this with Prime Minister Esko Aho in Helsinki 
today. In Brussels, the negotiations between Norway and the EU 
on agriculture and whaling are difficult. Markku Lehto reports 
on the Norwegian prime minister's visit to Helsinki. 
  [Lehto] The Norwegian prime minister was, above all, looking 
for a cooperative partner in Finland today to solve the 
agricultural problems in the EU membership negotiations, because 
during the final stages of the negotiations, agricultural 
problems proved to be difficult. To seek a partner here is 
natural because Norwegian and Finnish aims at the EU negotiating 
table are similar concerning questions of agriculture, Prime 
Minister Brundtland says. [passage omitted] 
  According to Brundtland, it is important for both countries 
to try and seek special EU status for agriculture in the north. 
According to Brundtland, cooperation between Norway and Finland 
could be established in the agricultural transitional period and 
the length of these transitional periods. Brundtland is to 
continue talks about these questions with Prime Minister Esko 
Aho in connection with the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. 
[passage omitted] 
  It is clear that Brundtland's government cannot present any 
sort of results to the national referendum from the negotiations 
in Brussels. The prime minister herself is convinced that the 
final result of the negotiations is decisive. [passage omitted] 
  Brundtland says that it is necessary that people get answers 
to questions concerning their future and future rules. As long 
as there are unclear points on these matters, it will show as 
uncertainty and in a negative way in the opinion polls. 
Brundtland also says that Norway has caught up with the 
advantage that Finland and Sweden had when they started the EU 
negotiations earlier. She believes that the result of the 
negotiations will be reached together with Finland and Sweden by 
the beginning of March.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto by </F>
Emilie Harantova in Prague on 1 February: "According to Heikki 
Haavisto, Finland Is Not Afraid of Russia" -- first paragraph is 
MLADA FRONTA DNES introduction] 
  [Text] Following the disintegration of the USSR, the 
position of Finland is similar to ours. The market -- to which 
one-fifth of Finnish exports used to go -- no longer exists, and 
the security guarantees provided by the neutrality forced onto 
the Finns -- and guaranteed -- by the Soviets has expired. In 
the words of Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, who 
granted an interview to MLADA FRONTA DNES, however, as opposed 
to the central European countries, Finland is not afraid of its 
large neighbor and is interested neither in joining NATO nor in 
an active part in a future defense structure of the European 
Union [EU] (it does want to join the EU itself). It only wants 
to join as an observer. 
  [Harantova] Do you believe that observer status would do for 
your security needs? 
  [Haavisto] Yes. We feel completely safe, and want only to 
be included in the joint structures with other European states 
also in the security sphere. 
  [Harantova] Do you have any specific reason for this? 
  [Haavisto] We do not feel the need to contemplate new 
security structures and defense solutions. We have decided to 
be impartial and our own military defense. 
  [Harantova] Do you want to reinforce your Army like Sweden, 
for instance, which is afraid of Russia? 
  [Haavisto] No. I believe that our Army is quite good, and 
we maintain very normal and very good relations with Russia. 
  [Harantova] Like with any other state? 
  [Haavisto] Yes, very normal and very good relations. 
  [Harantova] So, you are not afraid of Russia? 
  [Haavisto] I believe that the developments there are moving 
in a democratic direction. 
  [Harantova] Even after the latest changes in the government, 
when it seems that the reform route will be abandoned? 
  [Haavisto] We are not afraid of the current development. We 
do not expect the new parliament to alter fundamentally the 
foreign policy, and there is also the president, who has 
extensive powers. 
  [Harantova] What if there no longer is President Yeltsin 
but, let us say, President Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Haavisto] I believe that they will know how to choose 
another wise president. Furthermore, aggressive persons of 
Zhirinovskiy's type appear now and then in every country. 
  [Harantova] Your special relations with the USSR enriched 
the international glossary by the term Finlandization. Does the 
term still have a real basis today? 
  [Haavisto] No. And the term itself has always been rather 
dumb. I believe that if a country has very good relations with 
its neighbor, it always is a positive phenomenon. 
  [Harantova] Would Russia mind if you wanted to join NATO? 
  [Haavisto] There is no need to discuss this because we do 
not want to join NATO. 
  [Harantova] Does Finland want to join at least Partnership 
for Peace? 
  [Haavisto] I believe that Partnership for Peace is meant 
particularly for the central European countries, which do not 
have such a great feeling of security, and not for a neutral 
country like Finland. 
  [Harantova] What were the major problems for Finland in the 
talks concerning the entry into the EU? 
  [Haavisto] I believe that it is ridden with problems if the 
country involved is an agrarian one, because the rules applied 
to this area have been conceived for the central European 
region. The countries there have summer two to three months 
longer, and the temperatures are twice as high as in our 
country. Therefore, we have asked for special adjustments that 
would guarantee the equal position of our farmers. We should 
join the EU at the beginning of 1995. I believe, however, that 
this term cannot be kept. 
  [Harantova] What is the major benefit you expect from your 
entry? 
  [Haavisto] The most important is that we will remain 
together with the other European states and will partake in the 
joint building of the European economy so that the continent can 
compete with the southern and eastern Asia.

  [Text] Cologne (DDP/ADN)--Federal Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has called for the maintenance of Bundeswehr troop 
strength at 370,000 men. Kinkel told the Cologne newspaper 
EXPRESS (Friday [4 February] edition) that he recognized the 
financial difficulties and the concerns of Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe. However, in his view it is "imperative to 
maintain" a troop strength of 370,000 men. If the Bundeswehr is 
reduced any further, it would be difficult, sooner or later, to 
meet the constitutional obligation to meet defense requirements, 
he explained. "We must establish what sort of troop strength we 
need for which tasks, and then money can be discussed. It should 
not be the other way round, under the motto `How much money do 
we have, and how many soldiers can we afford on that.'" 
  Regarding plans by the defense minister not to take part in 
any more international UN missions on cost grounds, Kinkel said 
that if the United Nations should ask the German Government to 
participate in another mission such as Somalia this year, "we 
cannot say no from the start on cost grounds." Such a request 
must be thoroughly considered on an individual basis and in the 
light of the constitutional situation and all the circumstances 
involved.

<F P=106> ["ub"-attributed report: "Kinkel: Germany Will Stand By Its </F>
Duties"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The demand by the United States Senate that 
Germany should participate without restrictions in future UN 
military missions was received favorably by the Federal 
Government. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG that even "our best friends" are saying it is high time 
for German foreign policy to be "fully capable of acting." 
After all, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], which 
has been blocking the necessary constitutional change, also 
speaks out for a permanent seat in the Security Council. But 
this cannot be achieved, if Germany wants to play a special 
role. The Social Democrats, on the other hand, are warning 
Kinkel not to pay too high a price. The foreign minister "wants 
to get into boots that are too big for him by all means," SPD 
Manager Guenter Verheugen said. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping 
wants to comment on the matter at the Military Defense Meeting 
in Munich on Saturday [5 February]. 
  Kinkel told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that the resolutions of the 
U.S. Senate are in accord with what he hears from the 
administration in Washington. A talk he had with UN Ambassador 
Madeleine Albright has confirmed his impression that the Clinton 
administration is in favor of Germany holding a permanent seat 
in the UN Security Council, but that it expects Germany to be 
fully capable of acting. London and Paris have changed over to 
those in favor under similar conditions, he said. 
  "We want to be in the Security Council," Kinkel said, but 
"not with foam at the mouth." This is, of course, only possible 
if there is an overall extension, which includes the Third 
World, he said. Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, with whom 
he had just talked, does not see this any differently, he said. 
Germany only has a chance to get a permanent seat if "it fully 
stands by its duties." 
  Kinkel said it is unfortunate that the SPD chairman, who 
realizes that the Bundeswehr has to take on a new role, was not 
able to get his way at the party conference. He said he is 
calling upon the SPD to end its "blockade." Otherwise, the only 
hope that remains is the Federal Constitutional Court. 
  In resolutions that were obviously aiming at the German 
discussion, the U.S. Senate twice called on Germany recently to 
participate "fully" in UN military missions. Republican 
senators said that if Bonn and Tokyo wanted to get onto the 
Security Council, they must become aware of the link between 
global power and responsibility. Many Germans do not seem to 
have realized that rights are always linked to duties. 
  In the opinion of SPD Manager Guenter Verheugen, Kinkel's 
"very brisk approach" meets with international criticism rather 
than serious support. He said he thinks that the envisaged 
reforms of the Security Council will get stuck "in the masses of 
unsolved problems." The fact that Washington links Bonn's 
application to expectations "that we cannot and do not want to 
fulfill," is an additional aggravating factor. If the ticket to 
the Security Council has to be paid for with the willingness to 
"take part in an un-German, selective practice of interventions" 
by military means, the price is too high. According to 
Verheugen, a "somewhat more cautious approach" is necessary.

cannot count on further government assistance. The budget 
situation left no scope for this. Rexrodt and the steel

only within the framework of an agreed upon, Europe-wide

proper use of the subsidies for the steel industry in all EU 
countries, Rexrodt said. The EU subsidies could not be used to 
acquire new shares of the market. The crisis meeting was called 
by Rexrodt. The steel sector was represented by the executive 
boards of the steel concerns and German Steel Federation 
President Ruprecht Vondran.

private employment agencies. Plans that, under certain 
conditions, unemployed people can in the future be made to 
perform harvest work have been described as a social policy 
"climatic disaster" by the Trade Union for Public Services, 
Transportation, and Traffic (OeTV). The German Salaried 
Employees Union has been talking of a "revival of the labor 
service" practiced in the Third Reich. The Bundestag will 
discuss the package of proposals today. 
  Until now, unemployed people could only be urged to take up 
seasonal work in farming and forestry, as well as fruit and 
vegetable processing, if the wages paid were higher than the 
level of unemployment benefit. In general, however, the wages 
paid in agriculture were lower. The result was that in 1993, 
for example, 180,000 foreigners, mainly from Eastern Europe, 
came to Germany to perform such work. 
  Under the Bonn bill, employment agencies are to pay 
recipients of unemployment benefit "supplementary payments" 
amounting to 25 German marks (DM) per day for a minimum of six 
hours work and DM150 weekly for at least 36 hours work. If the 
total, composed of wages for seasonal work and the supplementary 
payment, exceed the level of unemployment benefit, such work has 
to be accepted -- the work is considered acceptable. If such 
work is rejected, then no unemployment benefit will be paid by 
municipal agencies for a period of three months. In the past, 
farmers associations have been extremely skeptical about how 
successful having German unemployed people performing harvest 
work would be. 
  With this solution, the coalition is, above all, focussing 
on 
the 45 percent of unskilled workers among the unemployed. 
According to the "priority principle," foreigners can only 
obtain a work permit if no German or EU workers are available. 
  A poll conducted by the Dortmund Forsa Institute indicates 
that 55 percent of Germans approve of the plan. Among FDP [Free 
Democratic Party] supporters, the level of support was 71 
percent. As for supporters of Alliance '90 and the Greens, the 
result was a stalemate. 
  Controversy has also been fueled by the plans, backed by the 
FDP above all, not to limit the procurement of employment to 
state employment agencies, but to permit the operation of 
private agencies throughout the country without any kind of 
trial period. While DGB Deputy Chairman Engelen-Kefer expressed 
criticism, stating that the imbalance between the 3.7 million 
unemployed and the 220,000 registered job vacancies cannot be 
corrected "through ideologically motivated privatization," the 
Association for the Unemployed has announced that it will file a 
complaint with the Constitutional Court. The associations also 
says that unemployed people should boycott seasonal work.

<F P=106> ["esl."-initialed report: "German Business People Not Much </F>
Impressed by Gloomy Forecasts"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 2 February -- The resignation from the 
Russian Government of radical reformers Yegor Gaydar and Boris 
Fedorov and the dismissal of their prominent economic advisers 
Jeffrey Sachs from Harvard and Anders Aslund from Stockholm is 
regarded by many as a "tragedy" and as the end of the 
market-economy reforms in Russia. Fedorov even spoke of an 
"economic coup" and predicted that Russia would collapse. Yet, 
German business people in Moscow, who are used to difficulties, 
are not impressed by these gloomy forecasts. They are keeping 
up their -- in many cases long-standing -- contacts with their 
Russian partners. 
  The resignation of former Economics Minister Gaydar and 
Finance Minister Fedorov, and the victory of right-wing 
extremist "Liberal-Democrat" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in the 
parliamentary election are regarded by Andrea von Knoop, 
representative of the German economy in Moscow, only as an 
"additional risk factor in the overall Russian risk." No German 
enterprise represented in Russia has reduced or even stopped its 
activities as a result. On the contrary, her office has been 
swamped by written requests from enterprises wanting to open an 
office in Moscow. Many German business people welcome the 
"certain predictability" offered by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and his deputy, Oleg Soskovets, and their "European 
orientation," which contrasts with Gaydar's and Fedorov's 
American orientation. 
  Last week, the activities of German business people in 
Russia 
intensified despite the crisis. Last Tuesday, for example, the 
Viag-Bayernwerk-Gruppe gave a presentation in Moscow. 
Carl-Wolfgang Sames, Viag adviser for Eastern Europe, said that 
despite all difficulties, the group was trying to gain a 
foothold in Russia, for example in the spheres of energy 
management, the aluminum industry, the steel industry, and 
transport logistics. Viag was planning to conclude agreements 
with Russian regions worth at least 100 million German marks for 
a period of about three years. Under the management of a German 
consortium, metals, ores, and chemical products should then be 
sold in the West and the revenues used for modernizing Russian 
enterprises. 
  The Kloeckner concern is arranging the establishment of a 
"German Compensation and Clearing Corporation" in the near 
future to stimulate economic contacts between Germany, Russia, 
and other CIS countries. The company Linde is planning to set 
up offices in Moscow and several Russian regions in the near 
future. Salamander AG just opened a new distribution office in 
Moscow. It is designed to concentrate Salamander's activities, 
which used to be divided up among various buildings in the 
Moscow area, and make them more efficient. Salamander has had 
business connections with the former Soviet Union since 1976, 
and in 1987/88 established joint ventures in Leningrad and 
Vitebsk. 
  After three years of negotiations, the Henkel group last 
year 
signed a contract on a 39 percent stake in the ERA AG, Tosno. 
ERA manufactures washing powder and detergents and glues. It 
is Henkel's second joint venture in Russia. The first has 
existed since 1990 in Engels on the Volga. Only recently, the 
AEG electric concern signed a deal for billions of marks that 
will go beyond the year 2000 on the development and the 
construction of three-phase train engines. As of 1998, some 200 
engines should be built, mainly for use by the Russian state 
railroads. 
  Siemens is so far represented on the Russian market with 
eight joint ventures, including in the spheres of 
telecommunications and the production of turbines. Moreover, 
Siemens services medical and computer technology. Individually, 
the Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) has applied for a general 
license to carry out banking transactions for foreign and 
Russian legal persons. Should this license not be granted in 
the foreseeable future -- President Yeltsin has suspended such 
activities by foreign banks in Russia by decree until 1996 for 
reasons of competition -- WestLB intends to confine itself to 
foreign customers for its banking deals.

<F P=106> ["eli/ub"-signed report: "Europe Threatened by Missiles"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- There is an increasing fear in the Federal 
Government of fundamentalist movements in the Mediterranean and 
of a threat to Europe by medium-range missiles. Reports say 
that Chancellor Kohl will comment on this threat at the Military 
Defense Meeting in Munich next weekend, drawing particular 
attention to the worsening security situation in the 
Mediterranean. The concern is due to developments in Algeria 
and the growing influence of fundamentalist forces in the North 
African states. The stability of the entire region is 
threatened, reports said. 
  According to intelligence service information, the 
government 
thinks that in the event of the fundamentalists coming to power, 
Western Europe could be threatened by missiles of a range up to 
1,000 kilometers within a very short time. It is alleged that 
Iraq might provide such missiles. The Federal Government is 
also concerned about the situation in the Mediterranean because 
of France's obligations in Algeria. French Government circles 
are alleged to have asked Germany for support in an Algeria plan. 
  In his speech at the Military Defense Meeting, Kohl will 
hint 
at these threats, and he will also discuss the situation of the 
Bundeswehr in detail. Kohl is guided by the idea that the 
Bundeswehr needs clear perspectives and that the wave of savings 
must come to an end. During last year's Military Defense 
Meeting, the chancellor ordered a Bundeswehr reorganization. So 
far, decreasing budgets have, however, prevented the Bundeswehr 
reforms from being carried out. 
  At the Military Defense Meeting, Chancellor Kohl and his 
challenger in the upcoming elections, Social Democratic Party 
Chairman Rudolf Scharping, will meet; but there will probably 
not be a direct confrontation. The organizers had planned that, 
as a special attraction, Kohl and Scharping should each give a 
20-minute talk consecutively, followed by discussion. Kohl said 
he wants to talk in the morning and leave after the discussion 
on his speech, because he has other commitments. He said 
Scharping could speak in the afternoon.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Dausend: "Trend Changes: More and More </F>
Move East"] 
  [Text] The direction of population movements between 
eastern and western Germany is increasingly changing. The 
number of western Germans taking up residence in the new laender 
has been increasing from year to year, while fewer and fewer 
eastern Germans are moving west. Whereas 395,343 people moved 
from east to west in 1990, the figure for 1992 was about half 
that. By contrast, in 1992, 111,345 people from the old laender 
found a new home in eastern Germany --that is, almost three 
times as many as two years ago. 
  In the first half of last year, this trend gained in 
momentum. By the end of May 1993, the Federal Office of 
Statistics in Weisbaden registered the departure of 75,588 
people from the new laender. During the same period, 55,907 
citizens from the western part of the country took up residence 
east of the former demarcation line. Projected figures for the 
whole year indicate that 180,000 people will have left the east 
and 135,000 will have moved there --the gap is closing. The 
main reason for this development is that many people starting 
out in a career want to begin in the east: "Young lawyers and 
doctors, as well as bank employees, can often make more rapid 
career progress in the new laender than in the west," says 
Stefanie Wahl of the Bonn Institute for the Economy and Society 
(IWG). As a result, urban centers such as the "boom region" 
Leipzig-Halle are particularly popular with those starting their 
careers in the east. 
  However, the number of people returning to the east is also 
continually rising, and that benefits the economy there. 
According to Stefanie Wahl, in the west these people "often 
obtained professional qualifications that they can now use." 
  For one group in the population -- that is, foreigners -- 
the 
trend has already been reversed. In the first five months of 
last year, 5,769 foreigners moved from the east to the west, and 
6,177 moved to the east.

  [Text] The prime minister has invited German businessmen 
to invest in India. Addressing the Indo-German Economic 
Conference in Bonn today, Mr. Narasimha Rao described the 
industrial climate in the country as extremely good and 
favorable for investment. Making it clear that his government 
has absolutely no hesitation in going ahead with the economic 
liberalization process, Mr. Rao asserted that India will step up 
the reform process. He assured the German industry that there 
will be no constraints coming in the way. He added that 
constraints if any will be resolved by him and the German 
chancellor, Dr. Helmut Kohl. 
  Opening the conference, the chancellor, Dr. Kohl, assured 
India of all possible assistance for the development of the 
industrial and technological cooperation. He said the economic 
policies of India are on the right path. He told the conference 
that India with its reform-oriented economic policy is one of 
Germany's most important partners on the Asian continent. Dr. 
Kohl announced that both the countries have agreed to establish 
a high-level India-German commission for science and technology. 
The president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Mr. N. 
Godrej, asked Germany to remove the constraints and controls on 
technology transfer. 
  Our correspondent, Sudarshanam, reports from Bonn that 
German 
industry has drawn up certain proposals for deregulating and 
liberalizing India's economy. These proposals have been 
forwarded to the Indian Government. The Indian Government after 
a study has sent certain recommendations. These are being 
examined to strengthen the economic and trade cooperation. Our 
correspondent understands that a German festival in India will 
be held as soon as possible. 
  Mr. Rao was given a formal ceremonial welcome in the 
forecourt of the Federal Chancellor's Office at Bonn. Mr. Rao 
inspected a guard of honor by the German Air Force. 
  Here is a report from our special correspondent A. 
Karuppaswamy: [Begin Karuppaswamy recording] The opening of the 
first India-German economic conference in Bonn by the German 
chancellor and Mr. Narasimha Rao is another successful step 
towards the India-German cooperation. The event follows the 
successful dialogue between Indian and German industrialists 
since the prime minister's last visit in 1991. The exchange of 
view and suggestions between the two delegates at the conference 
largely reflects the compelling necessity of both the nations to 
come closer to strengthen their bilateral ties in global 
interests. Modern India is viewed by Germans as a very valuable 
strategic partner in economic and scientific development because 
of India's ongoing reform-oriented economic policies aimed at 
liberalization offering one of the biggest markets in Asia. [end 
recording] 
  That was a report from our special correspondent in Bonn. 
  Earlier, Mr. Narasimha Rao held talks with the German 
minister for economic cooperation and development, Mr. 
Carl-Dieter Sprangar, and reaffirmed India's commitment to 
closer cooperation with Germany. Mr. Rao also told German 
leaders that New Delhi is keen on enhanced trade and investment 
flow from Germany. 
  Germany has assured India that it will continue to take a 
neutral stance on the Kashmir issue. Kashmir figured 
prominently in the talks between the prime minister and the 
German leaders in Bonn. Mr. Narasimha Rao explained the 
problems faced by India because of Pakistan's abetment of 
terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. He said, Pakistan is 
deliberately creating conditions to obstruct a meaningful 
dialogue.

  [Text] India and Germany have agreed to take all necessary 
steps to boost India-German cooperation in industrial and 
technical fields. The two countries have agreed to set up an 
India-Germany joint mechanism to monitor progress in scientific 
cooperation. An official spokesman summing up the prime 
minister's visit to Bonn said both the countries have also 
agreed to review the avoidance of double taxation treaty and 
pursue efforts to sign bilateral investment guarantees. Our 
correspondent Sudarshnam reports from Bonn: 
  [Begin Sudarshnam recording] The Federation of German 
Industry and India-German Chamber of Commerce have sent 54 
proposals to intensify the economic relationship between the two 
countries. These relate to general and financial issues, 
pharmaceuticals and chemical industries, private sector and air 
traffic. As many as 40 ministries and departments in India 
examined these proposals. Several of these have been 
implemented. Decision in respect of some are awaited. [end 
recording] 
  In another development, leading political parties of Germany 
have assured India that the New Asia concept initiated by 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl making India as a target country for 
intensified bilateral cooperation will be honored whichever 
party comes to power in this year's German elections. The 
assurance was conveyed to the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha 
Rao, when important German political leaders called on him in 
Bonn yesterday. An official spokesman said that there is a 
multiparty support to Chancellor Kohl's New Asia concept, as 
Germany has willingly recognized that Japan, China and India in 
Asia will be important political and economic powers in the 
years to come. The chief of the German Agency for Aid has 
shown his willingness to open a second window for soft credit to 
finance infrastructure projects in India. The projects include 
power and telecommunications sector. Meanwhile, the minister 
of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, who is 
accompanying the prime minister, has reiterated India's 
willingness to improve bilateral relations with Pakistan. He 
made it clear that Islamabad has no locus standi in Kashmir, and 
it is not in a position to advise India in this matter. The 
minister said India has no problems regarding protection of 
human rights, and it is always ready to be open with 
international human rights organizations. 
  As reported, the prime minister is leaving for Berlin today. 
He will meet the German president and address the Humboldt 
University. Mr. Narasimha Rao is also scheduled to have meeting 
with German business leaders and inaugurate the Indian Cultural 
Center in Berlin. On Sunday [6 February], Mr. Narasimha Rao is 
returning home. Our correspondent Karuppaswamy reports that his 
meeting with German indologists and business leaders will be 
continuation of his earlier exprience in Bonn to reassure 
Germans that the reform process in India is irreversible. The 
visit of the prime minister is the first official visit from 
India to the reunited Berlin -- the upcoming capital of the 
united Germany.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
expressed great regret over the resignation of Education 
Minister Rainer Ortleb. Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said 
this evening that the chancellor had, however, expressed 
understanding for the health reasons "that forced Professor 
Ortleb to give up his ministerial office." In his three years 
as minister, Ortleb has played a major part in dealing with the 
changes in the education system that came about as a result of 
German unification. 
  In particular, he played a successful role in the renewal 
and 
rebuilding of the higher education system in the eastern states, 
the statement goes on to say. Ortleb has shown great commitment 
in introducing his experience and the concerns of the eastern 
states into the German Government's work. The chancellor 
thanked Ortleb for his achievements as a member of the cabinet 
and expressed the hope that he would continue to play a part in 
politics using his expertise and experience.

  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who is on an 
official visit to our country, had talks today with the Greek 
Government on, among other topics, the Yugoslav crisis and 
Skopje. Juppe and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou had a 
30-minute meeting, which concluded a short time ago. 
  Earlier today, Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias met 
the visiting French foreign minister and discussed the crisis in 
the former Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They 
also discussed bilateral issues, Cyprus, and Skopje. Papoulias 
and Juppe again stressed the friendly Greek-French relations and 
added that they agreed on all issues. There were no points of 
disagreement, Juppe said. Papoulias described the exchange of 
views as positive and productive. On Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
French foreign minister stressed that a last chance must be 
given for a peaceful solution of the problem based on the 
European Union plan. But he stressed that humanitarian aid 
should definitely be safeguarded and recalled UN Security 
Council Resolution 836 and NATO's decision on air strikes. 
  On Skopje, Juppe said that the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between France and Skopje was not an unfriendly act 
toward Greece. He stressed that France will contribute to 
establishing the necessary conditions for a dialogue between 
Greece and Skopje. On the Cyprus issue, Juppe stressed that 
France desires a peaceful and just solution within the UN 
framework. 
  Asked whether Greece expects an initiative by the United 
States on the dispute with Skopje, Foreign Minister Papoulias 
said he does not know if there is anything specific. 
  Before his meeting with Papoulias, Juppe met Alternate 
Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos. The French foreign 
minister stressed again the excellent bilateral cooperation and 
friendship, and expressed his government's full support for the 
Greek Presidency of the European Union [EU]. Juppe and Pangalos 
discussed all EU-related issues, including implementation of the 
White Paper, EU expansion, French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur's proposal for a conference on stability in Europe, and 
completion of the GATT agreement. Regarding the accession to the 
EU of the four candidates Norway, Austria, Sweden, and Finland, 
Juppe expressed support for Greece's efforts to conclude 
negotiations by 1 March. The French foreign minister said he 
found views converged on all the issues he discussed with 
Pangalos.

  [Text] Russia today established diplomatic relations with 
Skopje under the name the Republic of Macedonia. The Czech 
Republic intends to do the same. French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe said in Athens that France will promote the resumption of 
the Athens-Skopje talks. 
  A short time ago, the government said it is strongly 
dissatisfied with Russia's decision, which was made as the 
Skopjean Government continues its provocative policy. 
Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos stressed that the 
government made its positions known to everyone and the 
international community should have realized that Skopje must 
change its stance to maintain security and stability, something 
that will benefit it as well. Correspondent Dhimitrios Latsios 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Latsios] Russia reportedly informed the 
Greek ambassador in Moscow that it intended to establish 
diplomatic relations with Skopje a week ago. Moscow believes 
that the name the Republic of Macedonia is used because Russia 
has long recognized the neighboring state with this name. The 
Russian officials who contacted the Greek side noted that this 
move does not go against Athens and the Russian Foreign Ministry 
deemed that it could not be postponed, because the European 
partners recently made moves, forcing Russia to act to maintain 
its Balkan interests. 
  After meeting Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, the French 
foreign minister referred to Skopje saying that France wants the 
Athens-Skopje dialogue to resume and will promote it through the 
diplomatic delegation it recently established in Skopje. 
Papoulias denied that there is a U.S. initiative on Skopje. 
  [Venizelos] Talks could continue under UN auspices if Skopje 
made the right goodwill moves; they are not a Greek demand or 
request, but an obvious prerequisite derived from international 
law. Again, we call upon Skopje to comply with this obligation.

<F P=106> [Report by Andreas Paraskhos] </F>
  [Excerpt] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said 
today that the final draft of the report on the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's] prepared by Cypriot 
Government experts answers the most important question raised 
when the term confidence-building measures was added to Cyprus' 
political dictionary. That question is: Will implementation of 
the CBM's mean the possibility of recognition, direct or 
indirect, of the Turkish Cypriot pseudostate? Kasoulidhis said 
that it appears, at last, that the CBM's can be implemented 
without the danger of recognition of the pseudostate. 
  [Begin Kasoulidhis recording] It appears that there are ways 
that can be agreed upon to implement the CBM's without the 
direct or indirect recognition of the pseudostate. 
  The foreign minister is expected to carry the final draft of 
the report with him when he returns from London tonight. The 
constitutional and legal processing of the report took place in 
London. [end recording] 
  The experts' report is currently in the hands of Foreign 
Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said the 
establishment of a timeframe will be one of the first issues to 
be raised if and when the dialogue on the confidence-building 
measures begins. We will not be drawn into endless and 
worthless discussions, he said. 
  Speaking in London, Mikhailidhis also said that the UN's 
next 
move will be an effort by the special representative to 
determine the basic issues related to the implementation of the 
measures. 
  Mikhailidhis was responding to correspondents' questions 
following his meeting yesterday with British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd. He added that the message from the United States, 
the UN secretary general, and Britain is that interest in the 
success of the confidence-building measures and establishment of 
a positive climate for talks on an overall solution to the 
Cyprus issue has increased.

  [Text] Lord Finsberg, rapporteur for the Cyprus problem at 
the Political Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe 
Parliamentary Assembly, has begun his contacts in the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus. 
  President Rauf Denktas received Lord Finsberg this morning 
and conferred with him for some time. In a statement after the 
meeting, Denktas said that he discussed with Lord Finsberg, who 
is assessing the Cyprus situation, the problems created by the 
lack of Turkish Cypriot representation at the Council of Europe 
and their possible solutions. Denktas noted that he told Lord 
Finsberg how the obstacles created by the recognition of the 
Greek Cypriot administration as the legitimate government can be 
eliminated, adding that Lord Finsberg expressed the hope that 
these problems will be averted if progress is made on the 
confidence-building measures. Denktas said that the UN 
secretary general should send letters to both sides for the 
talks on the confidence-building measures to begin. He 
concluded by describing the recent positive statements made by 
the Greek Cypriot side as an optimistic development.

  [Excerpt] Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has demanded 
that the zone north of Dhimokratias Avenue be removed from the 
Varosha fenced-off area that will be placed under UN control and 
be replaced with an area of similar size south of the fenced-off 
area. According to Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] 
information, this was the evaluation of Robert Lamb, the U.S. 
State Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue. Lamb 
met with President Glavkos Kliridhis today. 
  Based on CyBC information, Denktas' new demand concerns all 
services necessary to the operation of the area that will be 
returned, such as the Electricity Authority, the 
Telecommunications Authority, the Municipal Market, the 
warehouses, the packaging units, the Greek Famagusta High School 
and its library, the stadium, and many hotels. The same reports 
say that Lamb informed the Greek Cypriot side, which rejected 
the new demand. 
  The Greek Cypriot side also insisted that a date be set for 
the beginning of the second phase for the return of Varosha. 
The measures provide that the first phase will begin 18 months 
after the agreement is signed but do not determine the date for 
the beginning of the second phase. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Stavros Angelidhis] </F>
  [Excerpt] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue, assured President Glavkos 
Kliridhis yesterday that the Turkish side is prepared to hand 
over to the United Nations all of the fenced-off town of 
Varosha. A very well-informed source told O FILELEVTHEROS last 
night: "There is now light at the end of the tunnel," adding 
that the beginning of proximity talks in Nicosia should be 
considered certain. But the source explained that the talks 
will most probably open the week after next, since Rauf Denktas 
will visit Ankara at the end of next week for talks with the 
Turkish Government. 
  Lamb refrained from making any statement. He simply 
described the meeting as very good. He justified his refusal 
[to make a statement] by saying he would give a news conference 
at the Ledra Palace Hotel today for Greek Cypriot, Turkish 
Cypriot, and foreign correspondents. 
  According to O FILELEVTHEROS' always-reliable information, 
Kliridhis made it clear that he would not attend the talks 
unless it was insured that all of the fenced-off town would be 
handed over so that 15,000 refugees could return. While he 
agreed that the return to the area north of Dhimokratia Avenue 
take place as a second stage, Kliridhis insisted on setting out 
a clear schedule for this area, saying that the issue should not 
remain open for an unspecified period in which it might be 
possible to cancel the residents' return. 
  Concerning Turkish "fears" about security for the Famagusta 
port, President Kliridhis said he was ready to accept any UN 
measures that would neutralize these fears. At the same time, 
Kliridhis asked for safeguards that the area would soon be given 
to the United Nations (in about two months) and that effective 
measures would be taken against the infiltration of Turkish 
Cypriots or Turks and against thefts and other crimes, thus 
consolidating feelings of safety among those who will start 
working or settling in the area. The broader issue of safe 
accession to the area now surrounded by the occupation troops 
was also raised. 
  It appears that Lamb gave initial assurances although the 
final arrangements will be made during the talks. [passage

<F P=106> [Article signed ka,ha,bn: "Geneva: 50th Session of the Human </F>
Rights Commission -- Right to Development and Women's Rights at 
Heart of Debate"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Geneva, 31 Jan (ATS) -- The 50th session of the UN 
Human Rights Commission opened in Geneva on Monday [31 January]. 
The atrocities committed in former Yugoslavia are likely to be 
discussed at length during this six-week session. The 53 
participating countries will also consider the human rights 
situation in Burma, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan. A priority 
concern will also be the right to development and women's rights. 
  The Commission began by electing its new president, Pieter 
van Wulfften Palthe, a Dutch diplomat and lawyer. Ibrahim Fall, 
director of the human rights center, denounced the enduring 
violations of human rights. He nevertherless welcomed some 
progress that has been made in the fight against these 
shortcomings, and he mentioned in particular the appointment in 
the near future of a United Nations high commissioner for human 
rights. 
<H5>  Progress As Well </H5>
  The decision to create such a post was taken at the World 
Conference in Vienna in August 1993. The high commissioner will 
be Ecuadorean Ambassador to the UN Jose Ayala Lasso, whose 
appointment is to be officially announced within the next few 
days by UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
  Over these last twelve months, a number of complex 
situations 
have been resolved, declared Mr. Fall. This should lead to 
substantial improvements in human rights. The agreements 
between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the political 
developments in South Africa, and the founding of a court of 
justice to investigate war crimes in the former Yugoslavia are 
all examples of this progress. 
  Mr. Fall also considered that the appointment of a special 
rapporteur on women's questions will help guarantee women's 
rights. He also stressed the importance of the right to 
development and regretted the insufficient attention so far paid 
to social, economic, and cultural rights. 
<H5>  Lack of Money </H5>
  According to Gerhard Baum, former German interior minister, 
Western countries are going to press for the condemnation of 
China. China has always succeeded in preventing any resolution 
regarding itself from being adopted. Mr. Baum called for more 
financial resources for the human rights center. He felt it was 
unable to acquit itself of its tasks with the resources that are 
currently at its disposal. 
  On the Commission's agenda are Tuesday's visit by PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat, together with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. On 
Wednesday, the former Federal Council member Rene Felber will 
submit his report on the human rights situation in the Israeli 
occupied territories. Shim'on Peres, Israeli foreign minister, 
will be addressing the Commission on 10 February.

<F P=106> [Kenneth Gooding report: "Confidence Grows in Plan for </F>
Aluminium Output Cuts"] 
  [Text] There was growing confidence in the aluminium 
industry yesterday that output cuts of about 1.5m tonnes, 
representing 10 per cent of global production, were achievable 
following the unprecedented international trade deal agreed at 
the weekend between the world's leading aluminium producing 
countries. 
  Two European aluminium producers, Hoogovens of the 
Netherlands and Norsk Hydro of Norway, yesterday indicated they 
were prepared to make cuts to bring the market back into 
balance. In the U.S., Southwire said it would immediately cut 
by 10 per cent output at its 170,000-tonnes-a-year Hawesville 
smelter in Kentucky. 
  Scepticism about the potential success of the agreement 
voiced by some analysts was reflected on the London Metal 
Exchange where the price of aluminium for delivery in three 
months slipped by $4.25 a tonne to $1,233.25. However, 
aluminium prices already had perked up at the prospect of a deal 
and last week reached the best levels for 6 1/2 months. The 
price has risen about 12 per cent in January to stand 21 per 
cent above the eight-year lows touched in 1993. 
  Mr Stewart Spector, who produces the Spector Report on the 
industry, said he believed producers would make cuts because it 
was the industry that had pleaded with governments to negotiate 
to stem the rising tide of aluminium from Russia. "They will 
simply be doing what they should have done before, or what the 
market would force them to do it they do not make more cuts," he 
said. Mr Spector estimated that a cut to global supply of 1.5m 
tonnes would bring the market back into balance within a year. 
  Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at the GNI international trade 
house, also pointed out in his latest metals monthly that the 
deal would need to hold for only one year for it to make a 
substantial impact "and two years to place the market in a very 
healthy state for the rest of the decade." However, if the deal 
broke down "the market will not see a price revival until the 
end of the century." 
  Various aspects of the deal, enshrined in a "memorandum of 
understanding," agreed by trade delegates from Australia, 
Canada, the European Union, Norway, Russia and the U.S., became 
clearer yesterday. Among the main points are: 
  1. Russia will cut its output by 300,000 tonnes in the next 
three months and by further 200,000 tonnes in the following 
three months. Delegates said the two-tranches approach would 
enable the Russians to make sure that their initial cuts were 
being matched by Western producers before moving on to deeper 
ones. 
  2. There is no mention in the memorandum of specific targets 
for individual Western countries because of anti-trust problems. 
Neither is there a global target mentioned, but the trade 
delegates agreed at previous meeting that cuts of 1.5m to 2m 
tonnes were necessary. 
  3. Cuts dating back to November last year, after the first 
contacts between the trade delegates, count towards the global 
total. Delegates pointed out this would enable Reynolds Metals 
of the U.S. and Alcan of Canada, which are in the process of 
implementing cuts totalling about 250,000 tonnes, to claim they 
have already made contributions. 
  4. The cuts should last no longer than two years. 
  5. It says unilateral trade measures would be inconsistent 
with the agreement. Delegates suggested that this indicates the 
EU [European Union] will drop its restrictions on aluminium 
imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States, first 
imposed last August to "safeguard" the European industry, when 
they end on February 28 and that the US industry would not press 
claims that the Russians have been dumping the metal in their 
market. 
  6. There is nothing specific offered in financial assistance 
from the West for the Russian industry but the Western nations 
have indicated that they will help the Russians implement their 
reconstruction plan. Help from the EU will be provided from the 
TACES (Technical Assistance to the CIS) programme, which is 
spending about 500,000 Ecus a year. 
  7. Production cuts will be monitored by the International 
Primary Aluminium Institute [IPAI], a London-based data 
collecting organisation, to which the Russian smelters will now 
start providing information. Two Russian officials will meet 
the IPAI secretariat on February 16 and 17 to pave the way for 
their country's eventual membership. 
  8. There is to be another meeting between the trade 
delegates in Canada on February 28 to assess whether the scheme 
is working properly.

<F P=106> [Article signed SK: "War Crimes In Former Yugoslavia: </F>
Switzerland Recognizes Authority of International Tribunal"; as 
released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 2 Feb (ATS) -- Switzerland recognizes the 
authority of the international tribunal for judging war crimes 
in the former Yugoslavia. On Wednesday [2 February], the 
Federal Council decided that Switzerland will autonomously 
implement UN resolution 827 although it is not a member of the 
organization. It thinks that the tribunal's action is likely to 
strengthen the implementation of international humanitarian law. 
Switzerland has already helped to draw up the legal bases. 
  UN Security Council resolution 827 of 25 May 1993 creates a 
tribunal to judge people presumed responsible for serious 
violations of international humanitarian law on the territory of 
the former Yugoslavia since 1991. This tribunal began its work 
last November. Comprising 11 judges elected by the UN General 
Assembly, it has its seat in The Hague. A prosecutor appointed 
by the UN Security Council -- Venezuelan Ramon Escovar-Salom -- 
will be responsible for prosecution. All states are obliged to 
cooperate with the tribunal whether or not they are UN members. 
<H5>  An Urgent Decree </H5>
  Switzerland is not legally bound by the UN resolutions, 
because it is not a UN member. The Federal Council can, 
however, decide to implement them autonomously. Switzerland, 
the depositary of the Geneva Conventions for the Protection of 
the Victims of War, has a special moral responsibility in this 
sphere. It condemns violations of international humanitarian 
law, especially in the former Yugoslavia. 
  On Wednesday, the Federal Council tasked the federal justice 
and police, and foreign affairs departments with drawing up an 
urgent federal decree of a general nature relating to 
implementation of resolution 827. The statute of the tribunal, 
which accompanies the resolution, will also be implemented. A 
legislative document is necessary in view of the obligations 
which the resolution imposes on the Swiss authorities. 
<H5>  Active Contribution </H5>
  Switzerland has contributed to drawing up the legal bases 
for 
the tribunal. A meeting of about a dozen legal advisers of the 
European countries' foreign ministries was held in Geneva on 8 
and 9 February last year. Switzerland has also drawn up a 
report on serious violations of the Geneva Conventions and 
international humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia, which 
was submitted to the United Nations in November. This report 
was based on evidence from Bosnians, mainly Muslims, who have 
taken refuge in Switzerland.

<F P=106> [Article by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "Defense: Expected </F>
Personnel Changes in Armed Forces High Command"] 
  [Text] On a proposal from the defense minister, the Council 
of Ministers has decided to keep Admiral Alain Coatanea in his 
position as Navy chief of staff until 30 June, although he 
reached on 27 March the age limit for his rank. Also to remain 
in place until 30 June as commander of the Rennes [Brittany] 
military defense district is Lieutenant General Jean Pons, who 
reached the age limit for his rank on 22 April. 
  The extensions have been decided in the run-up to a 
comprehensive change of personnel in the military high command. 
This change will mostly affect the Navy and the Air Force, as 
well as part of the Army. 
  The departure of Admiral Coatanea will entail changes in the 
Navy staff. The next chief of staff will likely be Vice Admiral 
Jean-Charles Lefebvre, who currently commands the Naval 
Intervention Force in the Mediterranean Sea. However, in view 
of what military men call his "potential" -- that is, the 
balance of the active period he has to complete before being 
promoted to the second section (May 1999) -- the government may 
chose to fill the position on an "interim" basis with a man who 
would remain in place until after the presidential election. 
But should the armed forces be subject to a political timetable 
or, conversely, should they ensure defense continuity? Should 
Admiral Lefebvre not be appointed chief of staff this year, the 
position might go to Admiral Deramond, who currently heads the 
Brest [Brittany] Navy district. 
  The Council of Ministers appointed Vice Admiral Jean-Noel 
Turcat as general army inspector to replace Admiral Calmon. He 
will be replaced as major general by Vice Admiral Bernard Moysan. 
  As for the Air Force, the change of personnel will stem from 
the departure of General Vincent Lanata, who in June 1993 had 
been confirmed in his position as chief of staff for an 
additional year. He should be replaced by Lieutenant General 
Jean-Philippe Douin, who is currently Army major general. This 
position could be given to Lieutenant General Jean Rannou, who 
now heads the Defense Ministry's Military Bureau. The latter 
could himself be replaced with a "landsman," General Jean 
Heinrich, the current military intelligence chief; with General 
Raymond Germanos, the deputy head of the FAR [Rapid Intervention 
Force]; or, most likely, General Philippe Mercier, operations 
deputy chief at the Armed Forces Staff Headquarters. 
  Such are the rumors currently making the rounds. They are 
not unfounded. However, no decision has reportedly been made 
yet. This is the very reason why the announcement of the whole 
process -- which was supposed to take effect soon -- was delayed 
and why Admiral Coatanea remains in place as Navy chief of staff 
for the time being. It must be added that the Armed Forces are 
currently completing their proposed Military Planning Bill and 
that by way of consequence this was probably not the best time 
for implementing substantial personnel changes within the 
military high command.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by </F>
Elisa Wasch; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mock] [As far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
concerned], I think that the point is not to adopt new 
resolutions, most of which have lost credibility, but, finally, 
to set a sign of hope by implementing at least one or more 
resolutions that will have a protective effect for the 
population in certain areas -- if necessary through military 
intervention in specific cases, which has been announced five 
times before but has never been put into practice. 
  [Wasch] Foreign Minister, do you not think that it is easy 
for Austria, which is not a NATO member, to call for air strikes? 
  [Mock] It is not at all easy. What we do is abide by the 
principles of the UN Charter and international law; we have 
always said coercive military action should be the last resort. 
However, if such action is necessary to halt aggression and to 
create, at least, a chance to find a way out of chaos, then one 
can only pursue this course. 
  [Wasch] Do you think NATO will be influenced by Austria's 
demand? 
  [Mock] Certainly not. Nevertheless, we have been asked, and 
I have been invited, to participate in a conference of 
neighboring countries in Geneva. I will stick to our course 
there. If others think that order can be restored by dividing 
up recognized countries, or by rewarding aggression -- then this 
is their opinion with which I will not identify. However, one 
will have to regard that as a most serious warning for 
medium-sized and small countries. One will have to be aware of 
the fact that the law hardly counts in current international 
politics, all that matters is strength.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Willy Claes by newscaster </F>
Francoise Palange live in the studio -- interview was preceded 
by televised report on the bombing of Sarajevo] 
  [Text] [Palange] Our guest tonight is Foreign Minister 
Claes. Mr. Claes, there is now a feeling of helplessness; what 
must be done next? 
  [Claes] We must admit that we are indeed helpless, but I 
think that there are some limits that should never be exceeded 
for ethical and moral reasons. Now, I am personally convinced 
that those limits have been reached, which means this situation 
must be brought to an end. But let us not forget that any 
solution bears some risks, which means risks for the [Belgian] 
blue helmets too. This time, something must be done. I fully 
support the proposals made by Alain Juppe. On the other hand, I 
do not believe in the result of the negotiations; I personally 
witnessed on several occasions the signing of documents and 
well, two minutes later, the pledges made were flouted. 
Consequently, the "civilized world" -- if I may say -- must 
make it very clear that the situation is no longer acceptable 
and take actions. 
  [Palange] What do you mean concretely by "actions?" 
  [Claes] Well, air strikes and bombings are not ruled out if 
the withdrawal of the Serbian troops surrounding Sarajevo -- as 
Mr. Juppe requests -- cannot be achieved. The blockade of the 
city and the cruelty which prevails in the region must be 
brought to an end. 
  [Palange] This even if the Serbs -- as some people fear -- 
turn against the blue helmets? 
  [Claes] There is indeed some risk, but I know that the armed 
forces have already developed plans to reduce this risk, for 
example, by concentrating troops. Still, risk exists. Take the 
Belgian [troops] stationed there, engineering and transport 
divisions -- well, they need the protection of other troops, 
otherwise they really are at risk. But again, for ethical and 
moral reasons, we must intervene now. 
  [Palange] I now propose we take a look at the results of an 
opinion poll conducted by Survey and Action, a study group which 
examines the development of Belgian society, which asked the 
opinion of our fellow citizens on the right of humanitarian 
intervention and on the intervention of the Belgian troops in 
Bosnia. [Palange reads questions and poll results] 
  "Is it necessary to intervene -- even militarily -- to put 
an 
end to conflict or protect civilians." Seventy-one percent of 
the Belgian population say "yes." 
  "Do you think that Belgium should maintain or even reinforce 
its troops in former Yugoslavia." Fifty-three percent of the 
population say "yes." 
  "Would Belgian casualties be justified in former 
Yugoslavia." 
Here only 41 percent of the Belgians say "yes" and 49 percent 
say "no." 
  "Is it necessary to bomb the [Serbian] artillery positions." 
Thirty-four percent say "yes" but 59 percent say "no." 
  It can be seen that the results are contradictory: The 
Belgians are firmly in favor of the right of humanitarian 
intervention, but more than half of the people surveyed are not 
ready to sacrifice human lives. 
  [Claes] Evidently there are enough, there is a 
contradiction. 
Political action means choices. At certain times, risks must 
be accepted; this is the job of any politician. Personally, I 
say that in the present case, values must be defended which 
justify accepting some risks. [passage omitted] 
  [Palange] These pictures [from Sarajevo] lead me to ask Mr. 
Claes a last question: Is Russia responsible for the inactivity 
of the United Nations? Indeed, it is known that the Russians 
are the traditional allies of the Serbs. 
  [Claes] It would be too easy to say so. Let us be frank, 
even the Western countries could not agree on providing the UN 
generals with the necessary means [for carrying out their 
mission successfully]. Having said that, it is true that a 
definite development has been taking place in Moscow since the 
last elections. Moscow has made it known that new deliberations 
by the Security Council are necessary for military action. The 
Russian Parliament passed a resolution which supports the Serbs. 
So, I understand that the United States hesitates to convene a 
new meeting of the Security Council. This allows me to say that 
NATO will meet first. I suppose there will be unanimity here at 
NATO, and I hope this unanimity within NATO will prompt the 
Russians to ponder the issue before they oppose dramatic 
measures against the Serbs in the Security Council. 
  [Palange] And when will this NATO meeting take place? 
  [Claes] In the next few days. It will be a meeting at the 
ambassadorial level. 
  [Palange] Thank you Mr. Claes for answering our questions.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister has had urgent talks on Bosnia 
over the past 24 hours with both Defence Secretary Malcolm 
Rifkind and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, as the West plans 
its response to Saturday's [5 February] massacre of civilians in 
Sarajevo. 
  Mr Rifkind -- who is in Sarajevo today for discussions with 
the United Nations' new hard-line commander, Britain's Lt-Gen 
Sir Michael Rose -- warned that use of airpower would send a 
powerful message to the Serbs and create a "feel-good" factor. 
  But Mr Hurd, speaking on BBC radio, was more cautious and 
said that more was involved than the "one day of satisfaction" 
that an air strike would create. 
  He warned such action could intensify the siege of Sarajevo 
and halt aid convoys to the embattled Bosnian capital. However, 
he said events appeared to be moving toward a meeting of NATO to 
discuss the atrocities and decide how to react. 
  Today, as the grim death toll from the mortar attack on a 
market place rose to 68, with hundreds wounded, Britain offered 
hospital beds for casualties. The Foreign Office said up to 10 
wounded could be brought to Britain for treatment. 
  In addition, a doctor and medical team are being sent to 
Kosevo Hospital in the Bosnian capital to help staff overwhelmed 
by the carnage there. 
  The offer, made via the United Nations High Commission for 
Refugees, came as Mr Rifkind warned that "some response" to the 
outrage would be seriously considered by allied governments. 
  Overseas Development Administration [ODA] surgeon Tony 
Redmond of Stoke-on-Trent Hospital, was flying out to Bosnia 
today with a team of paramedics. An ODA spokesman said Mr 
Redmond's team would not be involved in the medical evacuation 
but would be helping doctors at the hospital. 
  Mr Rifkind, who spoke while en route to Sarajevo aboard an 
RAF Hercules, said the 16 NATO governments would discuss 
specific action but refused to say what form that might take. 
  Any military response would have to involve punitive air 
strikes and would require the full support of the UN Security 
Council, where Russia is certain to put up strong objections. 
  Another problem for the allies is in identifying which 
artillery unit was responsible for the slaughter. Failure to do 
so inhibits any direct retaliatory strike. 
  In addition, the UN does not believe the marketplace was 
deliberately targeted and stresses that any of the numerous 
rounds fired at the city in recent weeks could have exacted an 
equally horrific price in human life. 
  It has now emerged that the mortar round which caused the 
carnage had landed on a roof before spraying the marketplace 
with shrapnel. It has therefore proven difficult to calculate 
the trajectory and point of origin of the shell, although there 
is little doubt it came from a Bosnian Serb position. 
  Mr Rifkind said the use of airpower would send a powerful 
message to the Serbs and create a "feel-good" factor but he also 
noted the possible impact on the UN's humanitarian efforts on 
the ground. 
  Mr Hurd said mounting an air strike was not too difficult. 
What was more difficult was to work out what happens next. 
  He said an air strike could actually prompt the Serbs to 
tighten their grip on Sarajevo but added: "There may well be 
ways in which force could be used in the area which would avoid 
these dangers." 
  Mr Hurd said there were three British aims in Bosnia: to 
stop 
the war from spreading; to help the politicians negotiate a 
peace; and to help Bosnians of all three communities to stay 
alive by getting them food and fuel. 
  "If the use of force can help with these aims, we should 
certainly be ready to consider it. I have been doing a lot of 
telephoning in the last 24 hours. There has been a great deal 
of discussion between the allies." 
  Mr Rifkind's two-day fact-finding mission to Bosnia is part 
of the Government's detailed review of the UN operation. 
  Britain and other countries contributing to the UN 
Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) -- primarily France, Canada and Holland -- will 
decide next month whether these efforts should continue. 
  While Washington has pressed hard for punitive air strikes, 
the Clinton administration accepts that Britain and other allies 
with troops on the ground must have a clear say in this. 
  Britain believes it is crucial any military move should not 
obstruct the drive for peace by giving hope to any one of the 
three warring factions, primarily the Muslims. 
  Elsewhere, Lord Owen, the EU peace negotiator, said that 
politicians must now be prepared to accept an imperfect peace in 
the former Yugoslavia. He told the BBC TV Breakfast with Frost 
programme it would be quite wrong to take UN forces out while 
winter continued. 
  And the Labour leader John Smith demanded the creation of 
safe havens, backed by the implicit threat of force, as the only 
way to stop the "wanton slaughter." Sarajevo should be the 
first of these, he told Labour's Euro and local government 
conference in Glasgow.

<F P=106> [By Sian Clare and Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] The Government is considering the use of air strikes 
in Bosnia, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said today. But he 
warned it was a double-edged sword, with air strikes carrying 
benefits and risks. Mr Rifkind spoke in Bosnia as Britain was 
expected to face overwhelming pressure at European Union talks 
in Brussels to support the use of air strikes against the 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali yesterday asked 
NATO 
to prepare for possible air strikes against artillery positions 
in and around Sarajevo after Saturday's [5 February] mortar 
attack in the city which left 68 civilians dead. British Jaguar 
jets stationed on the Italian Adriatic coast could be among 
those involved in any strike. 
  But Mr Rifkind warned that humanitarian aid convoys guarded 
by British troops could be jeopardised by air strikes. 
  Mr Butrus-Ghali sent a letter to NATO Secretary-Seneral 
Manfred Woerner asking him to "take action" to obtain, as soon 
as possible, authorisation for the NATO Council to launch air 
strikes "against artillery positions in or around Sarajevo, 
which are responsible for attacks on civilians targets." 
Representatives of NATO's 16 members will meet in Brussels, 
possibly today, to discuss the call. NATO, which must carry out 
any air strikes, previously authorised only close air cover in 
case UN troops were attacked. 
  Foreign ministers of European members of NATO gather 
separately today at the European Union's Foreign Affairs 
Committee in Brussels in a meeting that will test Western 
determination to intervene after the worst tragedy since the 
siege of the Bosnian capital began 22 months ago. 
  Among other options, the subsequent NATO council meeting 
will 
consider delivering an ultimatum to the warring factions which 
could involve a deadline to the Serbs to lift the siege of 
Sarajevo or face air strikes. 
  European Union governments are aware that the massacre has 
renewed criticism of their inaction in the Bosnian crisis. But 
any decision on military action would need agreement between the 
NATO nations, while the EU will concentrate on keeping 
humanitarian aid flowing. 
  Mr Rifkind said he would support some specific military 
action if it could prevent atrocities such as the weekend 
shelling of the market place in Sarajevo. "There may be a 
powerful case for air strikes" and if military action was needed 
to defend UN troops from attack then it would be taken, he said. 
But he added: "It is no use trying to hide the fact that there 
would be real dangers to the aid programme which is saving tens 
of thousands of Bosnian lives." 
  The Bosnian prime minister had told him during his current 
visit that without the aid programme, helped by RAF Hercules 
flights, the people of Sarajevo would have starved. Mr Rifkind 
was keen for Britain not to be portrayed as at odds with nations 
such as France and the United States who look more favourably on 
the option of air strikes. A discussion over the use of air 
strikes was currently going on in Britain, he said. "We also 
are trying to establish whether there is a sensible use of air 
power that would actually achieve the objective we all seek, or 
whether the net effect would be damaging rather than helpful," 
he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 
  Labour's defence spokesman Dr David Clark told the same 
programme: "We have got to recognise at the end of the day there 
cannot be a military solution in Bosnia but the military might 
help to bring about a solution." 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, arriving in 
Brussels for talks, backed calls for air strikes -- provided 
they do "more good than harm." He said: "Anything that is done 
has to be forward looking. It has to improve the situation and 
not simply react to the brutalities of the past." He said such 
caution did not rule out the use of air power because the 
principle of such action had already been accepted as long ago 
as last August. "I think after all that has happened the case 
for air action is very strong provided we can find a means for 
doing it in a way which produces more good than harm. That is 
really what NATO has to work out urgently in the next few days," 
Mr Hurd added. 
  Freelance British aid worker Sally Becker was back in former 
Yugoslavia today for her third mercy mission aimed at keeping 
promises made on her last trip in December.

  [Excerpts] The Prime Minister wants immediate, effective 
and "more muscular" action to halt the bombardment of civilians 
in Sarajevo, Downing Street said today. 
  Britain will call for political backing for a new approach 
at 
the European Union's Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels this 
afternoon. 
  And Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind will discuss the Prime 
Minister's plans with the United Nations military chief 
Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose in Bosnia today. He will 
report back to the Prime Minister tonight. 
  John Major believes that action in the wake of the atrocity 
in Sarajevo market place on Saturday [5 February] which killed 
68 people cannot wait for an overall settlement of the civil war 
in the former Yugoslavia. 
  He has accused all three parties, the Serbs, the Croats and 
the Muslims, of "dragging their feet" in negotiations. 
  The Prime Minister's call for a new, tougher approach comes 
after UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali asked NATO to 
prepare for possible air strikes against artillery positions in 
and around Sarajevo. 
  Representatives of NATO's 16 members are set to meet in 
Brussels on Wednesday to discuss the request. 
  Downing Street officials said Mr Major thinks it is now 
essential for the UN and NATO to take "immediate and effective 
action." 
  He believes the UN should draw up a plan to halt attacks on 
Sarajevo and to deploy UN forces so they cannot resume. 
  "This is likely to require more muscular action than 
hitherto 
by the United Nations. Its purpose must be not merely to punish 
or retaliate but to improve the situation in Sarajevo," said one 
official. 
  Both Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Mr Rifkind today 
warned that an air strikes policy carried risks. [passage 
omitted] 
  Mr Major will hold urgent talks on the Bosnian crisis with 
Mr 
Hurd, Mr Rifkind and other key Ministers at Downing Street 
tomorrow. 
  It was being stressed today that the Prime Minister realises 
that it would be "folly" to ignore the advice of the military on 
the ground before launching any reprisals. 
  But it has been noted that General Rose has already adopted 
a 
far tougher line than his predecessors in Bosnia. 
  Downing Street kept in touch with the White House over the 
weekend and Mr Hurd spoke three times to Warren Christopher, the 
U.S. Secretary of State. 
  The Prime Minister was also in regular contact with Mr Hurd 
and Mr Rifkind.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Following the massacre committed 
by the Serb besiegers in Sarajevo, the German Government today 
called on the relevant UN bodies to act on decisions in order to 
prevent those responsible for the massacre from carrying out any 
more violence against the civilian population. "The use of 
targeted military measures, as offered to the United Nations by 
NATO on 9 August 1993, must no longer be ruled out," German 
Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said in Bonn today. 
  The German Government most strongly condemned the bloodbath 
among the civilian population, he said. The brutal attack on 
innocent women, men, and children showed an "incomprehensible 
contempt for human lives on the part of those responsible." The 
German Government expressed its sympathy to the relatives and 
declared its willingness to support U.S. efforts to provide 
medical care for the surviving victims wherever possible. This 
act of violence clearly shows "the urgent need for an immediate 
peace settlement in Bosnia-Hercegovina."

<F P=106> [Interview with FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by news </F>
announcer Ulrich Wickert in Munich on 5 February, "shortly 
before the newscast" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Wickert] Good evening, Mr. Ruehe. 
  [Ruehe] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. 
  [Wickert] Mr. Ruehe, what do you feel, personally, after 
such 
an attack [on Sarajevo]? 
  [Ruehe] Already, over the past few days, particularly when I 
saw the dead children -- I have children of the same age -- I 
thought this was absolutely terrible. But the massacres are 
getting worse and worse, and I believe that we will lose our 
credibility if we do not, finally, implement new measures now. 
  [Wickert] As defense minister, what would you personally 
like 
to do now? 
  [Ruehe] The United Nations must determine without a doubt 
who is responsible for this massacre, and then, I think, the 
Security Council and the secretary general must consider 
measures to end those horrendous massacres. We cannot act on 
our own. Last summer NATO declared its readiness to act on the 
order of the United Nations, but it is absolutely true that if 
the international community tolerates such massacres right in 
the middle of the civilized world, in the middle of Europe, 
without doing anything about it, then we all lose our 
credibility. 
  [Wickert] We always hear the United Nations, the United 
Nations, the United Nations. What would you, as German defense 
minister, like to do now? 
  [Ruehe] Well, I would not react as you do, because the 
United 
Nations is the only organization with the legitimacy to give the 
go-ahead to military actions. 
  [Wickert] The United Nations is not an anonymous instrument; 
the United Nations also includes Germany, and for once Germany 
could exert political pressure. 
  [Ruehe] No, the Security Council, of which we are not part, 
is called on to act, as is the UN secretary general. I agree, 
however, that German politicians should make it clear to the 
United Nations that one cannot simply proceed with the planned 
agenda after such massacres, and that new measures must be 
implemented now. 
  [Wickert] What new measures? 
  [Ruehe] I believe the United Nations must threaten military 
sanctions, and these threats must be carried out in the event of 
a violation. 
  [Wickert] This means, for example, air strikes. 
  [Ruehe] It may mean that. Air strikes have never been ruled 
out in the past. I remember that last summer there was 
discussion about measures being necessary if Sarajevo remained 
under fire or was being strangled. 
  [Wickert] But they were not implemented. 
  [Ruehe] No, they were not implemented, and after this 
massacre the credibility of the United Nations is at stake. 
What else needs to happen before we take action that will truly 
deter those who commit such horrendous massacres. 
  [Wickert] Are you not afraid that once again nothing will 
happen? 
  [Ruehe] Actually, I cannot imagine that after this 
escalation 
of violence one can simply proceed with the planned agenda, 
because peace is becoming increasingly difficult. How is there 
to be a peace treaty? After all, a political solution is the 
only hope. People have to live together once again in this part 
of Europe. How is this to be possible, if one does not react 
clearly to such massacres? 
  [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Ruehe.

  [Text] Augsburg (DDP/ADN) -- Theo Waigel, CSU [Christian 
Social Union] chairman and federal finance minister, said the 
latest attack in Sarajevo was "no longer war, but naked murder 
and terrorism." The time for talk was running out, as was 
people's patience and civilized humanity, Waigel said in an 
interview with AUGSBURGER ALLGEMEINE (Monday [7 February] 
edition). The warring parties' last chance was "to draw the 
necessary conclusions and at least make the murderers see 
sense." If this opportunity was not taken, then "specific action 
has to be taken with the utmost rigor," Waigel said. Asked what 
this rigor might look like, the CSU leader said the United 
States had left "no doubt" on this issue.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
(FDP) [Free Democratic Party] has called the serious attack on 
Sarajevo market square, in which more than 60 people were 
killed, a "barbaric act of violence" and expressed his strong 
condemnation. Kinkel said in Bonn today that "the senseless 
killing must stop." The political and military leaders of the 
parties to the conflict must not be allowed to continue their 
war at the expense of the people in former Yugoslavia any longer. 
  Kinkel had telephoned his American, British, and French 
counterparts in advance. Kinkel announced that the 12 foreign 
ministers of the European Union would discuss strategies and 
measures for solving the conflict again on Monday [7 February]. 
He stressed that ways to end the war would have to be found 
with the United States.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F>
Karin Beindorff; Kinkel's location unspecified -- live] 
  [Text] [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali has asked NATO to prepare air strikes. What do you 
think this means in practical terms? 
  [Kinkel] This means that we will probably have a NATO 
session 
tomorrow or Wednesday [9 February] at which we will discuss what 
can and should be done. If you don't mind, I would like to say 
first of all that what has happened in Sarajevo is really 
terrible and cannot be justified in any way. We do not know who 
fired this dreadful shell. It was very probably Serb aggressors, 
but no one knows for sure. Now we do indeed have a situation 
where the whole world is demanding that action of a military 
nature be taken. However, this must be considered very 
carefully, and I assume that we will be doing this in Brussels 
today. 
  [Beindorff] In your view, Mr. Kinkel, do the UN resolutions 
passed to date cover military intervention? 
  [Kinkel] It is true that in asking NATO to make preparations 
for air strikes on artillery positions around Sarajevo, 
Butrus-Ghali is basing his action on Resolution 836, according 
to which force may be used to safeguard protected zones. 
Sarajevo is such a protected zone. 
  [Beindorff] Yesterday, Mr. Kinkel, you are reported to have 
telephoned your counterparts about policy toward Bosnia. I 
asked at the start what was the prevailing mood? 
  [Kinkel] That's right, I was on the telephone until the 
early 
hours speaking to virtually all my European colleagues and, in 
particular, to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. I 
cannot go into detail here about everything that was discussed. 
However, there were still differing views. Those with troops 
on the ground, the French and the British, are naturally 
concerned that air strikes could be a danger to their own troops 
and we all anxiously ask the question: What happens afterwards, 
after the air strikes? Might the whole situation deteriorate 
even further? The military leaders are in fact more inclined to 
warn against air strikes. We will be discussing all this in 
Brussels and, of course, in all this we Germans are, as in the 
past, not the best ones to give advice with regard to the former 
Yugoslavia and not the ones who should be particularly pushing 
for action, because if things get serious, the way things look 
we probably won't be involved. 
  [Beindorff] Does this mean, Mr. Kinkel, that it is to be 
expected that for instance London, a NATO member, will prevent 
military intervention by NATO by using its veto? 
  [Kinkel] No we cannot say this at the moment. I have spoken 
to Douglas Hurd and I know his view very well. They are above 
all concerned, and I say this again, about their own soldiers. 
Let us wait. I know all this looks unsatisfactory, and people 
think that one could resolve the situation overnight with air 
strikes. If it was easy, it probably would have already 
happened. 
  [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, will you support military 
intervention aimed at selected targets in Brussels today? 
  [Kinkel] I will be as cautious as I have been so far, simply 
because naturally the partners will be asking: Will you Germans 
be involved? They know our constitutional situation, they know 
the political situation, which will probably not produce a 
majority in the German Bundestag in favor of intervening in the 
former Yugoslavia, even if we are able to do so 
constitutionally. I mean we will not obstruct things. We will 
help wherever we can within our possibilities. I am happy that 
we are contributing in the humanitarian field, that injured 
people have been brought to us. 
  I assume, I'll say it again, that there will be a NATO 
meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday. The final command for an 
intervention has to come from Butrus-Ghali. Everyone agrees on 
this. It is interesting for me what the U.S. President said and 
also what the U.S. secretary of defense said in Munich yesterday 
and the day before. President Clinton has pointed out again 
that everything should be tried to make progress by peaceful 
means. He once again committed himself to an arms embargo. He 
did, however, also hint at air strikes or military intervention 
and committed himself to American support in such possible 
military action. 
  [Beindorff] Does this mean in your view that lifting the 
arms 
embargo as requested again by President Izetbegovic is 
impossible? 
  [Kinkel] I think this will be impossible for as long as 
there are ground troops out there, simply because the Europeans, 
some of whom -- like the French -- are there with several 
thousand men, are concerned that the hostilities will spread if 
the arms embargo is lifted. We, the Germans, have always been 
very close to the American position, because we were 
particularly concerned with protecting the weakest, the Muslims, 
and possibly giving them the chance to defend themselves. 
  However, I understand very well the concern of my European 
partners who have ground troops there, and who say they will be 
in danger. Generally, in the case of air strikes, the use of UN 
ground troops would become very doubtful. This is what the 
French and the British in particular are concerned about. The 
French have around 6,000 men out there. We should exercise 
restraint with our advice, we have no one out there. 
  [Beindorff] How great is, to your knowledge, the actual 
danger to the ground troops, the blue helmets in Bosnia? 
  [Kinkel] This is an issue that has to be judged from a 
military point of view. I cannot judge this very well myself. 
I take advice on this, and the military people warn us. They 
say that the Serbs will probably react even more brutally if air 
strikes were carried out, no one knows. So it is a double-edged 
sword. If you read the German press today then, as far as I 
know, you see divided opinion. One side says something must 
happen, the other side says for God's sake be careful. Respice 
finem -- look before you leap -- what will happen afterward? 
  It is very easy to say military intervention is needed, but 
the matter is very difficult and the consequences need to be 
considered very carefully. I can only say again and again: If 
it was as easy as all that the international community, the UN, 
NATO would have reacted in the past and met what has now become 
an an emotionally understandable demand by many people. Indeed 
people are angry and sad at the same time that it has not been 
possible to bring this problem under control. 
  [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel you say this needs to be carefully 
considered, but there has been sufficient time to consider 
whether military measures are an option or not. Why is this 
decision being put off again and again, always with the same 
justification? 
  [Kinkel] It is very simple. Those who do not have ground 
troops there are in favor of air strikes, and those who do have 
ground troops call for caution. Those who have ground troops 
there are the ones whose interests have to be taken into 
account. After all they have so far been the bravest of all, 
they have demonstrated commitment. We cannot let them down now, 
their military interests and their concerns need to be 
considered above all. And those who do not have ground troops 
there, like ourselves, should be cautious. The Americans know 
why they are being cautious, because they are not prepared to 
send ground troops there, which I understand. They want to use 
air strikes alone. It is all not that simple. 
  [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, Bosnia mediators Owen and 
Stoltenberg 
are now calling for a separate peace plan for Sarajevo. Do you 
support this idea? 
  [Kinkel] Of course, I support anything that can lead to 
peace 
including such a separate peace plan. I wanted to point out 
earlier, Ms Beindorff, that at the same time -- and I refer back 
to what the U.S. President has said -- we must try to do 
everything possible to reach a peaceful settlement based on the 
European plan of action which was, in turn, based on the 
proposal put forward by [French foreign minister] Juppe and 
myself. I do not know whether this will succeed. 
  We must not give up hope here either, and I am pleased that 
despite this awful attack in Sarajevo Izetbegovic intends to 
come to the talks to show that they obviously haven't given up 
either. However, I am disappointed, and I'm making no secret of 
this, that there has been no solution to date, although 
positions are relatively close on most issues. This is 
obviously because the warring parties presently are not willing 
ultimately to make peace. However, nothing will happen if there 
is no willingness on the part of the warring factions. 
  [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, you know that there is growing 
international criticism of the role of Lord Owen in particular 
in the peace negotiations. Do you share this criticism? Is 
Lord Owen still representing the interests of the European Union? 
  [Kinkel] Yes, I do not consider it just and right to condemn 
Lord Owen one-sidedly for his extremely difficult work and his 
mediation attempts. He is doing an extremely good job -- 
together with Thorvald Stoltenberg who is representing the 
United Nations in this regard -- and he is trying his very best. 
All I can say here is who can do it better? It is terribly 
easy to have a go at the mediators, the plans and everything 
else, but levelling criticism from outside and having to find a 
solution in practice are two very different matters and the 
latter is by far the more difficult. 
  [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, the last question. What do you think 
will happen when there are again no deeds but only statements? 
  [Kinkel] I hope that there will be more than mere 
statements. 
By the way, in this difficult area where, as I have seen myself 
for months now, things inevitably go back and forth, I would not 
like to answer hypothetical questions, but I would be pleased if 
we can make decisions in Brussels today which would be useful 
for the meeting of the NATO Council.

  [Text] A shell fired at a market in Sarajevo yesterday 
killed 68 and wounded 200. This carnage has provoked outrage 
everywhere and has already resulted in a response by NATO 
countries this afternoon. There were many contacts between 
capitals today, and it was decided to organize a NATO meeting as 
early as possible. France will call on its allies to serve an 
ultimatum on the belligerents in Bosnia, a three-point 
ultimatum. Let's listen to French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] First, the siege of Sarajevo must be 
lifted, this means that Serbian forces must pull back to a 
distance making the renewed shelling of the town materially 
impossible. Second, with a view to lifting this siege, heavy 
weapons held by Serbs and Bosnians within a range of 30 km 
around the town must be brought together and put under UN 
Protection Force control. This measure will be the first stage 
in setting up the UN administration over Sarajevo which is -- 
let me remind you -- a basic element of the European Union peace 
plan and which has been accepted in principle by all parties. 
Third, if these two conditions are not met within a short 
deadline to be set by the allies, all means, including air 
power, should be used to enforce them. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] This statement was made less than half an hour 
ago at the Quai d'Orsay and was recorded by Philippe Lefebvre.

  [Text] This afternoon Alain Juppe and Francois Leotard held 
a joint news conference in Paris. France is officially 
demanding a NATO meeting so that a clear ultimatum can be given 
to all the belligerents. Olivier Lerner reports: 
  [Lerner] Looking haggard, the result no doubt of a sleepless 
night, Francois Leotard and Alain Juppe wanted to make the day a 
landmark. It is a turning point, they each said in turn, after 
first recalling some basic figures. 
  [Leotard] At present, I stress at present, it is not 
possible to determine the origin of the firing. Moreover, this 
underlines the extreme difficulty of handling this crisis by 
military means, if this were necessary. But we will all agree 
that it is the siege itself that is the cause of all these 
deaths. Today, we have reached a death toll of about 10,000 in 
Sarajevo. 
  [Lerner] So how is the seige of Sarajevo to be ended? France 
wants to give an ultimatum to the forces there. The word 
ultimatum is a strong one, but it has finally been uttered, 
because we would be ashamed if a similar massacre were to happen 
again, says Alain Juppe: 
  [Juppe] First, the siege of Sarajevo must be lifted, this 
means that Serb forces must pull back to a distance making the 
renewed shelling of the town physically impossible. Second, 
with a view to lifting this siege, heavy weapons held by Serbs 
and Bosnians within a range of 30 km around the town must be 
brought together and put under UN Protection Force control. 
  [Lerner] If these two demands are not fulfilled, would it be 
necessary to resort to the famous air strikes? 
  [Juppe] Air strikes, which are of course the subject of a 
lot of comment, are not in themselves, or by themselves, a 
response. They are, and remain, a tool for making reason heard. 
We have never abandoned the idea of them, and even less so 
today than yesterday. 
  [Lerner] For the moment, no NATO council meeting on Bosnia 
has been called. So will Mssrs Leotard and Juppe have been 
preaching into a void? We will know very soon the impact of 
their ultimatum, which can be expected to be endorsed by NATO.

  [Text] As defense minister I am able to confirm that our 
bases are ready to provide effective support, if and when NATO 
decides to intervene in Bosnia. The statement was made by 
Defense Minister Fabbio Fabbri, who was speaking about the 
latest developments in the Bosnian situation. 
  Fabbri stressed that, with UN authorization, air strikes 
could be directed against the main sources of fire and provide 
adequate air cover for the peacekeeping forces. The problem 
which so dramatically confronts our consciences, Fabbri said, is 
whether it is possible to stop the massacres in Sarajevo.

  [Text] Spain's foreign minister made a statement a few 
minutes ago which makes clear the acceleration of diplomatic 
efforts. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes was with the foreign 
minister. Good afternoon. 
  [Cespedes] Good afternoon. The foreign ministers of the 
European Union [EU] and of the member countries of the UN 
Security Council are in telephone contact today, Sunday [6 
February], to set in motion a series of measures for the city of 
Sarajevo. 
  [Begin Javier Solana recording] I can tell you that out of 
the frustration and grief which we all feel we are going to try 
to do everything possible to set in motion a series of measures 
that will enable the siege of Sarajevo to be lifted. We must 
carry out the operations directed toward raising the siege of 
Sarajevo within international law, and therefore it will surely 
require another resolution from the UN Security Council. [end 
recording] 
  [Cespedes] The legality of these measures will have to be 
taken up at tomorrow morning's meeting of European Union foreign 
ministers in Brussels. A meeting of the Atlantic alliance will 
also be convened in the Belgian capital so that the military 
commanders can give the green light to any operation. When this 
work is done, there would be a return to the UN Security Council 
to take the appropriate decisions. At this point Minister 
Javier Solana says he cannot specify what the raising of the 
siege of Sarajevo would consist of or the origin of the attack 
on the market in the Bosnian capital. For Minister Solana, and 
we quote him, there is no doubt about the responsibility. 
  The foreign minister is not in favor of lifting the arms 
embargo on the Bosnians so that they can defend themselves from 
attacks, both Serb and Croat. According to Javier Solana, this 
would be a new (?element) which would add fuel to the fire.

  [Excerpts] We begin with news from Sarajevo where the 
massacre of 68 people in the market last Saturday [5 February] 
has again raised the possibility for European and U.S. foreign 
ministries of airstrikes in Bosnia. [Passage omitted] The 
Spanish position has been voiced repeatedly by Foreign Minister 
Javier Solana, who invokes new UN resolutions before moving on 
to such armed reprisals. But we have Foreign Minister Solana's 
latest statements made just a few minutes before he left for 
Brussels. Our colleague Hector Arenas has them. Good morning. 
  [Arenas] Good morning. Spain will support airstrikes, 
especially on Serb positions in Bosnia, if that is decided by 
NATO and the United Nations, although Spain will continue to 
think that there is no military solution to this war but rather 
a political one, of prior negotiations, which will enable the 
ending of the terrible massacres of civilians like this 
weekend's and the achieving of a lasting peace. This is what 
can be deduced from the statements which Foreign Minister Javier 
Solana made a few minutes ago as he left by plane for Brussels 
for the meeting of EEC ministers. [Passage omitted] 
  [Begin Solana recording] If there is an intervention of this 
kind, whose main aim, I stress, must be to raise the siege of 
Sarajevo, Spain would logically say...[pauses] maintain a 
position that this is what must be done; but being quite clear 
in all of this that there is no military solution to this war, 
that the solution to this terrible war is a solution of a 
political nature, which is the only thing which can make a 
lasting peace in these Balkan lands possible. Therefore any 
actions set in motion must have the rationale of seeking or of 
exerting pressure in the direction of a political solution. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Finland has sharply condemned the latest attack on 
the civilian population of Sarajevo. According to Foreign 
Minister Heikki Haavisto, an air strike against those besieging 
Sarajevo would be a very difficult decision for Finland. The 
Nordic countries have, however, discussed the possibility of 
stepping up armed protection of humanitarian aid transports.

Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos says: The Greek 
Government condemns the recent developments in Sarajevo and 
expresses its abhorrence of them. The drama of Sarajevo's 
civilians continues and the latest tragic events make the 
severity of the problem clear. 
  Searching for those responsible is a duty of all parties 
involved in the international community. However, what is 
urgent now is to at last find a peaceful, swift, just, and 
viable solution to the Yugoslav crisis.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry on 5 </F>
February; place not specified] 
  [Text] An mortar attack on Sarajevo today -- a city which 
has been under a Serbian siege for a long time and which is 
constantly being bombed -- killed 51 civilians including old 
people, women, and children, and injured more than 100. 
  The fact that the bomb was thrown on a Saturday [5 
February], 
when the people of Sarajevo go out with family, and the fact 
that it was thrown at a market place where there are large 
crowds, is irrefutable proof of the absolute necessity to stop 
the crazed and merciless aggressor. 
  We strongly condemn this latest act of savagery committed 
against the people of Sarajevo almost as if in provocation. This 
place was visited by our prime minister and minister a few days 
ago to observe the unacceptable conditions and problems of these 
people, and we promised them help. We reiterate to the world 
the call made by our prime minister to stop these inhuman 
incidents. 
  The attacks and inhuman acts being perpetrated against 
Sarajevo can be stopped in two ways: The first is by means of 
international intervention. Turkey is ready to participate in 
intervention where NATO's means are also used. 
  The second is this: If the international community is 
incapable of intervening at this stage, then it must enable 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to protect itself. 
  Turkey is determined to be on the side of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
in its just struggle and to continue to support it.

Demirel] 
  [Text] In connection with the Sarajevo massacre, President 
Suleyman Demirel has sent messages to NATO, the EU, the UN 
secretary general, the NATO secretary general, and other heads 
of state and government. 
  In the message he sent to the heads of governments and 
states, Demirel stated that the Sarajevo massacre proves once 
more that its inhabitants are left to the mercy of the Serbian 
aggressors. Demirel said the international community should 
initiate a military operation against the oppressors, thus 
stopping the bloodshed and making the aggressor accept a just 
and lasting peace. 
  Recalling the resolutions reached at the United Nations and 
NATO, Demirel asked NATO to act within the framework of these 
resolutions in order to end the suffering and tragedy in Bosnia 
as soon as possible. Demirel also asked the UN Security Council 
to provide the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina their most natural 
right -- the right to defend themselves.

  [Excerpts] Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who is 
presiding over the European Union [EU] Council of Foreign 
Ministers, left for Brussels at 1030 [0830 GMT] today to chair a 
meeting of the EU Council of General Affairs. The main topic of 
the meeting is the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Speaking 
before leaving, Papoulias said he hoped that calm views prevail 
during the meeting and stressed that Greece will seek a peaceful 
stance on the issue and oppose military intervention. [passage 
omitted] 
  Miltiadhis Evert, New Democracy and official opposition 
leader, expressed opposition to a possible air raid. Evert left 
this morning for a five-day tour of European countries. He said 
air strikes will not solve the problem because they will be 
followed by ground attacks, which would be insane.

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- William Perry, the new U.S. 
secretary of defense, has not ruled out targeted air strikes by 
NATO in the Bosnian civil war areas. Speaking at the 31st 
Conference on Security Policy in Munich, Perry stressed, 
however, that the United States would by no means take such 
steps unilaterally, because 28,000 lightly armed UN soldiers 
stationed in Bosnia, who had been made available by its allies, 
were surrounded by 200,000 "highly armed combatants." 
  NATO had the capacity to carry out such air strikes, Perry 
underlined. It would be possible to begin such a strike only an 
hour after the command was given, because all the means 
necessary to do so had been deployed. Consideration would still 
have to be paid to the probable political consequences of such 
an attack. Thought must be given not just to the first act, but 
also to whom would play the second and third acts and end the 
drama, Perry said. 
  Perry said another available option was to lift the arms 
embargo against Bosnia. On the other hand, he ruled out a 
military enforcement of a peace solution in Bosnia. Perry also 
rejected the view that NATO and the United States were inactive. 
The provision of supplies from the air alone had assumed 
dimensions which were comparable to the Berlin airlift.

  [Text] The European Union [EU] Foreign Trade Ministers 
Council concluded their meeting at Zappion Palace, and 
interesting points were revealed about the entry of Greek 
products into Balkan and Asian markets. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Usually no 
reports are issued on informal ministerial meetings, but a 
significant exception was made for today's meeting, the first of 
the Greek Presidency. Probably this is why European 
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan congratulated Ioannis Papandoniou, 
the Council's president and the Greek deputy minister for 
economy. 
  An advanced cooperation agreement was concluded with 
Slovenia. Brittan said this shows the road to what could happen 
if there is peace in the former Yugoslavia. An advanced 
agreement will be signed if problems with Russia on nuclear 
trade and financial aid are resolved. The Council is proceeding 
well with the GATT agreement and will press the Japanese and 
more Asians to open up their markets to products that interest 
Greece such as leather, footwear, and drinks. 
  Discussing the Balkans, it was decided to upgrade relations 
with Bulgaria and Romania. Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia asked 
the commissioner what he would say on the political intervention 
of some EU countries in favor of their own companies and against 
Greek companies that are performing very well in Bulgaria. The 
commissioner said that the EU Commission will do everything 
possible to reaffirm free trade in European markets, which means 
more influence for Greek companies in the Balkans. 
  [Papandoniou] The selection of GATT issues and relations 
with 
East Europe and Russia reflects both the EU needs in current 
conditions and the Greek Presidency's priorities. [end recording]

  [Text] Athens, Feb 5 (AFP) -- European Commissioner Leon 
Brittan said "95 percent" of the problems with signing an 
economic agreement with Russia were ironed out, as European 
Community (EC) foreign trade ministers met informally here 
Saturday [5 February]. 
  The ministers also reaffirmed support for signing a 
partnership agreement with the former Yugoslav republic of 
Slovenia. 
  Deputy Greek Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou, 
presenting 
results of the meeting, acknowledged that: "These past weeks, 
economic evolution in Russia raises certain questions." 
  Reformers recently quit the new conservative government in 
Moscow, throwing into doubt the future of free-market reforms 
initiated by President Boris Yeltsin. 
  But Brittan, European Commissioner in charge of trade 
policy, 
said: "95 percent" of the problems over the accord with Russia 
have been resolved. 
  Although issues to do with trade in nuclear products and 
financial aid still remained outstanding, he said, the 
Commission would do as much as possible to finalize negotiations. 
  Brittan said the decision to support an agreement with 
Slovenia was of "capital importance" and sent an important 
signal to other ex-Yugoslav republics. 
  The Council also backed signing a free-trade agreement with 
the Baltic countries "with an eye to a future association 
agreement," Papandoniou said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mock: EU Security Aspect"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Alois Mock has stressed the 
security aspects of Austria's joining the European Union (EU). 
"The Ukrainian border is only 400 km from Vienna; that is 
closer than Bregenz [Vorarlberg]," Mock said at a news 
conference in Vienna on Friday [4 February]. 
  One should pay particular attention to security policy, 
since 
it is one of the most important tasks of the Austrian Government 
to guarantee the security of its citizens, the foreign minister 
said. 
  By joining the EU, Austria will also be integrated more 
strongly in combating international crime. Mock pointed to 
dangers that are threatening from East Europe, such as a wave of 
migration or major military conflicts in the Balkans and 
escalation of the conflicts in the former Soviet Union, 
beginning with Ukraine. "The EU is the only organization that 
has proved to be a community of security so far," Mock stressed. 
Concerning the Transit Treaty -- which will be negotiated for 
the first time at the ministerial level on 8 February -- Mock 
said that it must remain in existence. As regards Brussels' 
demand to considerably shorten the duration of the treaty, he 
said that there are indeed indications that the treaty has had 
an effect more quickly than planned, but there is no proof of 
that. Therefore, one cannot change anything about the transit 
treaty. 
  Concerning the other still open questions, in particular 
agriculture and second residences, Mock showed a militant 
attitude. There will probably be still "tougher discussions, 
even confrontations" between the negotiating teams, since the 
EU's latest offers are unacceptable. [passage omitted]

a line under the months of debate about the duration of 
alternative national service. Retroactively as of 1 January, 
alternative national service will be extended from 10 to 11 
months; one month of that can be served through exercises. If 
more than 3,000 conscripts apply for alternative national 
service from May to October, this service will last 12 months as 
of next year. In the future, the young men doing alternative 
national service will no longer get cash for food and clothes, 
so that their income will go down from so far up to 8,000 
schillings per month to 3,000 schillings. In return, the 
monthly salary for men doing military service will be raised 
from 2,000 to 3,000 schillings. In addition, they are permitted 
to use public transport free of charge [when they are in 
uniform].

Staff in Bosnia"] 
  [Excerpt] From 1 March onwards, the Netherlands will be 
represented in the top military command of the UN's 
Bosnia-Herzegovina forces. Brigadier General A. Van Baal has 
been appointed by Defense Minister Ter Beek to the position of 
command chief of staff, succeeding Ramsey from the United 
Kingdom. 
  Van Baal (47) will become second in command to British 
General Rose, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] commander in 
Bosnia. After six months, another Dutchman will take over the 
position for another half year. Van Baal will be staying at the 
UNPROFOR headquarters at Kiseljak next weekend, to get 
acquainted with Rose, who recently succeeded General Briquemont 
from Belgium. 
  Van Baal, an artillerist, is currently commander of the 43rd 
mechanized brigade at Havelte. He has also been head of the 
army staff's organizational department in the Hague. Van Baal 
is regarded as a rising star within the army. 
  He will have the daily command of 460 troops of different 
nationalities, including 60 Dutchmen. From the headquarters in 
Kiseljak, the chief of staff will act as the deputy commander of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina command. 
  Together with the commander, he is in charge of the overall 
coordination of all troops in Bosnia. They frequently consult 
with political and military leaders from the contending parties, 
such as the Bosnian Serb leaders Karadzic and Mladic. 
  The command is also responsible for the protection of food 
convoys organized by the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees). The Dutch-Belgian transportation battalion in 
Central Bosnia, the UNHCR's only military transportation unit, 
also comes under the command. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kooijmans Wants Major U.S. Role in </F>
Bosnia Talks"] 
  [Text] The Hague/Brussels -- The Netherlands Government has 
asked the United States to play a more active role in the 
negotiations on a peace settlement in Bosnia. Foreign Minister 
Kooijmans called for this position in a letter to his U.S. 
counterpart Warren Christopher. 
  Kooijmans has also called on his European partners to end 
the 
continuing speculation about the withdrawal of their troops from 
Bosnia. Earlier this week Defense Minister Ter Beek said that 
the withdrawal of UN troops from Bosnia would mean the "moral 
bankruptcy" of the international community. 
  So far Washington has only been an observer at the Geneva 
negotiations led by the mediators Owen and Stoltenberg. Greater 
U.S. involvement and pressure is vitally important in getting a 
settlement accepted by the warring parties, Kooijmans said. 
  In the letter to Christopher, Kooijmans said that in his 
opinion the negotiations had entered a critical phase. The 
threat of failure in Geneva brings the danger of a total war 
with far more victims ever closer. 
  The minister said that the absence of the United States from 
the negotiations could be an alibi for the warring parties to 
back out of an agreement on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The Bosnian Muslims attach great importance to U.S. 
participation in the implementation of a possible peace 
settlement. 
  Kooijmans wants to discuss the Bosnia question on Monday [7 
February] in Brussels with his 11 EU [European Union] 
colleagues. He wants at any cost to prevent the withdrawal of 
the UN peacekeeping force from Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United 
Kingdom and France in particular are constantly making veiled 
threats to withdraw their troops after this winter. 
  Kooijmans pointed out to his colleagues that the presence of 
the UN peacekeeping force was still serving a purpose. The UN 
troops were making the life of the Muslim population in the 
so-called safe areas bearable, he said. Kooijmans hoped that 
the 12 EU members would declare unanimously on Monday that there 
will be no possibility of the withdrawal of UN troops from 
Bosnia. 
  The Netherlands minister also presented plans to his 
European 
colleagues for additional EU commitments to encourage the peace 
talks which are to be restarted on 10 February in Geneva. Under 
the plan, the Union would administer some areas which are 
sticking points between the warring parties until arbitration 
had found a solution. In fact that is an expansion of a 
previous offer by the EU: In case of a peace settlement, it 
would manage the contested town of Mostar on a temporary basis. 
  Most representatives of the 12 member states in Brussels 
have 
little enthusiasm for sanctions against Croatia, which is said 
to be intervening with its own army units in the struggle for 
Bosnia. Denmark will request sanctions on Monday. But even 
Kooijmans is reserved on the issue. Like Germany, he wants to 
wait for concrete proof that Croatia is intervening massively in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  If it were proved that Croatia is intervening massively in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, then virtually all the governments seem to 
be prepared to impose sanctions. Greece, currently president of 
the Union, is an exception. Athens is calling for the embargo 
against Serbia to be lifted, but has no support for this 
position among its European partners. 
  Up to now the EU has been "punishing" Croatia by withdrawing 
additional economic support to the country, which the Croats are 
entitled to under a trade agreement with the EU. Brussels could 
further reduce trading relations with Croatia. Kooijmans warned 
that great care was necessary. Croatia is very important as an 
interim post for aid to Bosnia. 
  European diplomats in Brussels do not believe that the EU 
will take a hard line on Monday. It is very probable that 
Kooijmans will be able to achieve the "gain" of a commitment to 
the maintenance of UN troops in Bosnia. British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd has at least said that he agrees with 
Kooijmans's vision. 
  The Netherlands has given two million guilders to Slovenia 
to 
handle refugees from the Bosnian civil war. Slovenia will use 
the money, to be sent via a Council of Europe emergency fund, to 
set up refugee centers.

"Croatian Troops, Get Out of Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Croatian troops in Bosnia have no business being 
there. This was also noted by the UN Security Council last 
Thursday [3 February]. It threatened measures against Croatia, 
if these troops are not withdrawn. This withdrawal must take 
place. 
  It is not only the Serbs who have violated the cease-fire 
the 
parties to the conflict promised the European Union [EU] foreign 
ministers. Bosnian troops, too, have initiated a major 
offensive against Croat towns in central Bosnia. The senseless 
killing, misery, suffering, and the driving away of people has 
to stop. Bosnian Muslims and Croats need each other. 
  The UN Security Council has given Croatia a period of two 
weeks. It then intends to decide on measures against Croatia, 
which might also entail the danger of further streams of 
refugees to Germany, a radicalization, and endangering 
humanitarian aid. Therefore, we must make good use of the time. 
Therefore, at next Monday's meeting of the 12 EU foreign 
ministers, I will advocate that we Europeans, in close 
cooperation with Croats and Muslims, seek an understanding that 
restores order to the deeply disturbed Croat-Muslim relations. 
This is the key issue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Dirk </F>
Hoeren; place and date not given: "Minister Kinkel: Somalia 
Mission Was a Big Success"] 
  [Text] [Hoeren] Mr. Kinkel, the Bundeswehr Somalia mission 
is coming to an end. Are you satisfied? 
  [Kinkel] A big compliment to our Bundeswehr: It did a great 
job in the Beledweyne region, particularly in supplying the 
population and providing other humanitarian aid. 
  Unfortunately, several things went wrong in the entire UN 
mission in and around Mogadishu. In addition, the 4,900 Indian 
troops for which we were to provide logistic support did not 
turn up. But, in spite of this, our mission went ahead without 
problems and was useful. 
  The United Nations had some problems enforcing the biggest 
humanitarian action so far, with 32 nations participating, in 
the way that was originally planned. But, one-sided criticism 
of the United Nations does not help; what we need is 
constructive assistance. 
  [Hoeren] How dangerous will the withdrawal of the Bundeswehr 
be? 
  [Kinkel] Our troops have to march back through Mogadishu. 
This does, of course, involve certain dangers. For our part, 
we will do all we can to get our troops home safe and sound. I 
expect the United Nations to guarantee a safe withdrawal. 
  [Hoeren] After Somalia, is there another mission waiting for 
the Bundeswehr somewhere abroad? 
  [Kinkel] We quickly need the required change of the 
constitution for Bundeswehr missions outside NATO territory. 
Unfortunately, the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] is 
still preventing this. I hope the constitutional court will 
make a decision soon. After all, we may be faced with another 
decision on Bundeswehr missions outside NATO territory. 
  [Hoeren] Some people say that Minister Kinkel is in favor of 
blue helmet missions only because he wants Germany to get a vote 
and a seat in the UN Security Council as quickly as possible.... 
  [Kinkel] This is nonsense. There is no direct connection. 
But, we must become fully capable of acting in foreign policy 
matters. 
  We want to get into the Security Council because it makes 
decisions that particularly concern us, as one of the most 
populous and economically sound countries in Europe. So far, we 
have had no opportunity to cooperate there, although we are the 
third largest contributor to UN funds.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Peter </F>
Ellgaard in Mainz on 6 February -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Ellgaard] Mr. Scharping, in Munich you said 
there are no real differences with the Federal Government on 
basic foreign policy issues. Does this not mean, however, that 
if you want to take over the government, this would require 
revising the Wiesbaden party congress resolution that rules out 
Bundeswehr operations as combat missions? 
  [Scharping] No, not at all. I also said in Munich that we 
did not give up sovereign rights when we joined the United 
Nations. Therefore, we ourselves decide whether and to what 
extent we participate in UN measures. This is the only central 
difference with the Federal Government. We, the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], and a government headed by it 
will not send the Bundeswehr to combat missions anywhere in the 
world. 
  [Ellgaard] If you took over the government, would you 
maintain compulsory military service? After all, this is a 
problem in view of the current thrift measures. 
  [Scharping] Of course. Compulsory military service is a 
very central element for the democratic anchoring of the 
Bundeswehr, and it is part of the political culture in Germany. 
I think that it must remain in existence. 
  [Ellgaard] Mr. Scharping, yesterday's pictures, the massacre 
in Sarajevo, shocked the world. Does the West not finally have 
to make a military intervention now? What is your position? 
  [Scharping] It is the same position as that of the U.S. 
secretary of state. We must step up the pressure, but military 
intervention would worsen the bloodshed rather than stop it.

  [Excerpt] Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl has strongly urged 
the Russian Government to refrain from any attempt to violate 
the sovereignty of its neighboring states. Opening the 31st 
conference on security in Munich, Kohl addressed 220 defense 
politicians, diplomats and journalists. In his speech, Kohl 
again supported Bundeswehr participation in so-called 
peacemaking combat missions. 
  [Begin Kohl recording] I believe a policy which in such a 
situation invokes peace, but on the other hand refuses the 
international community the instruments for preserving peace, is 
not credible or convincing. For that reason, I regard it as 
indispensable for Germany to participate in all future 
peacekeeping and peacemaking measures -- naturally, only with 
our partners and friends in NATO and the European Union. We 
realize that all our partners expect this of us. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, this also means that Germany needs a 
Bundeswehr which meets the demands made on it, including these 
new demands, a Bundeswehr which must be equipped accordingly. 
We have learned, perhaps more so than others, that peace and 
freedom cannot be obtained at no cost. [end recording] [passage

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
rejects UN or NATO military intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
I view proposals for seeking a solution through military 
strikes with a "great deal of skepticism," the chancellor said 
at a conference on security policy in Munich today. It is also 
difficult at present "to decide who is more culpable." 
  Kohl again warned the Croatian Government against further 
aggravating the civil war in the Balkans. He regretted that the 
Croatian Government had so far not made "the necessary public 
statements." Those who change borders by violent means cannot 
count on the Federal Republic to give aid for reconstruction 
after the war.

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
has called on the West to pay closer attention to the social 
effects of the reforms in the countries in East Europe, 
particularly in the states of the former Soviet Union. This was 
one of the most important conclusions to be drawn from the 
election results in Russia, the chancellor said today at a 
conference on security policy in Munich. A further opening of 
western markets to goods from the reformist countries is of 
"strategic importance." More open markets would lead to 
problems and strains, but are ultimately cheaper than "isolation 
and a fortress mentality," the chancellor said. At the same 
time, he called for a more equal distribution of financial 
burdens in the stabilization of economic and social conditions 
in Central and East Europe. Germany has reached the limit of 
its capacity. 
  It was right for the West not to give the Central and East 
European states any unequivocal promises regarding admission, 
Kohl said. This would only have led to new divisions and thus 
new tensions in Europe. The deeply rooted fear of encirclement 
and isolation in Russia must be taken seriously. At the same 
time, Kohl spoke in favor of letting the reformist states know, 
"through quite practical steps" that they are welcome in the 
European Union [EU]. Kohl suggested inviting the government 
heads of these states to an EU summit once a year. 
  Kohl warned against viewing the EU solely as "a glorified 
free trade zone." The Germans in particular need political 
union to prevent relapses into political circumstances like 
those at the beginning of the 20th century. Political union is 
the precondition for peace and freedom in Europe in the 21st 
century, the chancellor underlined. 
  Kohl said it is "indispensable" for Germany to take part in 
"peacekeeping and peacemaking measures" of the international 
community. Not least for this reason, Germany needs a 
Bundeswehr capable of meeting the "new demands" and equipped 
accordingly. This does not mean the militarization of German 
foreign policy. Kohl rejected sending German soldiers to the 
civil war area in former Yugoslavia, however, "in view of recent 
history."

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- According to Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, the German Government intends to adhere to a forces 
strength of 370,000 for the Bundeswehr. This figure "is and 
remains our basic position," Kohl said today at a conference on 
security policy in Munich. The actual Bundeswehr strength will 
average 361,000 during the current year, and probably higher at 
the end of the year. The personnel level of the Bundeswehr had 
fluctuated by 30,000 in previous years, Kohl said. The goal 
must be "to stay around the 370,000 level." 
  Account will be taken of this trend in drawing up the 1994 
budget, Kohl announced. At the same time, he countered 
criticism from the United States that Germany is doing too 
little for military defense. In this context, account also has 
to be taken of the other achievements Germany has contributed to 
European stability. Kohl drew attention to statistics from the 
Canadian Government, according to which: since 1989 Germany has 
provided $341 per capita to support the countries of the former 
Soviet Union, while Canada has provided $67, France $34, Italy 
$31, the United States $30, Japan $5, and Great Britain only $1. 
  Kohl responded with annoyance to reproaches that Germany is 
primarily promoting the dissemination and development of 
chemical weapons. It is "disproportionate" for Germany to be 
cited on every occasion of this kind, while in the shadow of 
this discussion,others are able to continue their deals, the 
chancellor said. In addition, Kohl drew attention to the "time 
bombs" in the form of dangerous nuclear reactors in eastern 
Europe. It is "astonishing" which countries are concluding 
energy supply agreements with the countries where such plants 
are located. Indeed, the "degree of strange calm" with which 
Europe and Japan are accepting these time bombs is generally 
"incomprehensible." 
  Kohl strongly rejected the view that the Russian people are 
"incapable of democracy in the long term." It is "completely 
absurd" to expect Russia to introduce democracy and the market 
economy overnight, Kohl said. If the West denies the Russian 
people these opportunities from the outset, "nothing can come of 
it." The chancellor again called for western markets to be 
opened up to products from eastern Europe. It is a "fairly 
hypocritical policy" to hold out the prospect of involvement in 
NATO, but to cut oneself off from products.

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
has again called for a secure conceptual and financial basis for 
the Bundeswehr. Speaking at a conference on security policy in 
Munich today, Ruehe called for "rapid changes" in financial 
conditions for the troops. At the same time, the defense 
minister announced the establishment of "crisis reaction forces" 
[Krisenreactionskraefte]. 
  The Bundeswehr is in a position to fulfill its mandate with 
regard to domestic defense, he said. However, the troops are 
not yet capable of taking part in measures involving 
"international crisis management." To this end, a flexible, 
adaptable, assertive unit would have to be set up to cover 
missions under UN auspices, Ruehe said. In particular, this 
includes "extensive mobility for the transfer of forces."

<F P=106> [Interview with German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by NTV </F>
Chief Editor Peter Staisch; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Staisch] Mr. Ruehe, it has never been easy to 
be defense minister for anyone who has held this office before, 
but for you it is particularly difficult because undeniably 
there is a kind of identity crisis in the Armed Forces. 
  [Ruehe] It is not easy, but it is a good task. In 
particular, concerning our identity, we have made great 
progress. Two years ago there was not a single Bundeswehr 
soldier in Cambodia, in Somalia, in the Adriatic, or on the 
aircraft that fly to Sarajevo. This means that today the 
Bundeswehr is fulfilling new tasks, it is psychologically 
strengthened. Its identity is also strengthened in national 
defense, defense of the alliance as well as new international 
tasks. What is lacking again and again is money. Things have 
been very unpredictable regarding our funds. They have become 
less and less, and this has upset our plans again and again. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Staisch] If in the future we approach similar peacekeeping 
and peacemaking projects, what else is the United Nations to do 
if it cannot provide the framework, if the supraglobal 
structures are actually the decisive factor? 
  [Ruehe] Yes, the United Nations can do a great deal. For 
example, Cambodia was a greater success, but the United Nations 
did not go there until after there was a peace treaty. 
Moreover, it has to be said that if the groups concerned do not 
want peace, then the United Nations will be unable to help 
either. That is, the will of those involved to achieve peace is 
decisive. If two countries or groups come and say we want 
peace, but we need someone to help us because we haven't the 
confidence, then the United Nations can help. But in Yugoslavia, 
for example, it can also be seen that when hatred prevails, when 
peace is not really wanted, the UN scope comes to an end. Then 
one can give humanitarian aid, but not really solve a conflict. 
  [Staisch] Could it be the case that the United Nations has 
simply been overestimated as a result of the events during the 
Gulf War in 1990-91, because it worked there somehow, as a 
result of the American mediation. 
  [Ruehe] That was a very different situation. In 
organizational terms, that was completely in the hands of the 
Americans, on behalf of the United Nations, so to speak, whereas 
in Somalia we had what is at present an international army, 
which has been put together without a really unified command and 
without knowing who would really come and at what time. It is 
therefore not comparable. In Yugoslavia, there is of course the 
combination of civil war and conflict between states. That is a 
very different situation from that in the context of Kuwait and 
Iraq. But it may indeed be that there were illusions about what 
the United Nations could achieve because of what was experienced 
at that time. The United Nations has a very important task in 
the future, but, as I said, there must be a close examination of 
where it is being overstretched and what path should be taken -- 
I have hinted at one, the way things are done in Europe -- so as 
to solve conflicts with the United Nations. [passage omitted] 
  [Staisch] Minister, taking action in Bosnia-Herzegovina if 
the United Nations wants it: If the roof of the world, so to 
speak, gives its blessing, NATO can intervene. What is the 
German role in particular? What can we, the Germans, do in that 
region, bearing in mind our historical legacy? 
  [Ruehe] I have always said that German soldiers out there 
would be a part of the problem and not part of a solution. We 
want to solve problems. The international community understands 
this. The past is still with us. However, we do fly to 
Sarajevo every day. The soldiers risk their lives. Our planes 
have been hit, have been shot at several times. We fly three 
aircraft to Bosnia every night to supply the population with 
medicine and food. This German contribution is generally 
recognized. We take the same risks as others -- this is new. 
There have been specific threats against German aircraft from 
the Serb side and we have always gone when the others have, 
despite the dangers. I am very proud of what the Air Force has 
achieved there. [passage omitted] 
  [Staisch] We have looked in different ways at the 
Bundeswehr's new international role. At home, the money is 
becoming tighter and tighter. SPD [Social Democratic Party] 
Secretary General Werner Hoyer has accused you and all those 
responsible of having no concept for the future. You must save 
another 1.25 billion German marks [DM]. The Mauser company is 
complaining about a drop in orders. [passage omitted] If you 
take all this together, what is justified criticism, and when do 
you say it is exaggerated? 
  [Ruehe] Well, one cannot see things as simply as Mr. Hoyer 
does. One needs financial plans, only then can one make plans 
for the Bundeswehr. We have had to throw the plans for the 
Bundeswehr into the trash can twice because there were changes 
on the financial side. My most important concern has been to 
secure firm pledges for the Bundeswehr for several years in 
order to be able to plan things. This has now been disrupted 
again and that is why this hit us very hard. The pain barrier 
has been surpassed. 
  The Bundeswehr is underfunded and that means, in its current 
size, its structure cannot be maintained with the funds 
available. Therefore, I have said I will now propose strategic 
plans for development over the next few years, independent of 
the fact that this year we will have to make tough savings in 
all areas. In doing this I cannot orient myself by the needs of 
enterprises, I must ask myself what is absolutely necessary from 
a military point of view, I must safeguard the core abilities of 
the Bundeswehr. 
  I would like to add something else. The most important task 
of the last few years, besides taking on new international 
tasks, was to develop the Armed Forces of the unified state. 
This may have been the Bundeswehr's greatest achievement of 
all. Nowhere else is Germany growing together faster than in 
the Armed Forces. 
  Directly and indirectly, we spend about DM5 billion in the 
eastern states. If you want, these are not expenses for 
military reasons. I could say, for instance, we will leave our 
aircraft in places that have the most modern airports in 
Germany. Then they would all remain in western Germany. An 
aircraft takes only three minutes to get to Eastern Germany to 
maintain security, but we would not have a uniform air force. 
It would not be the armed forces of a unified state. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- General Klaus Naumann, the 
Bundeswehr chief of general staff, warns that the latest cuts in 
the defense budget could have far-reaching consequences on the 
Bundeswehr's operational readiness and the scope for action of 
German security policy. In an interview in WELT AM SONNTAG, 
Germany's most senior military officer says "cuts are now being 
made that will lead to parts of the Bundeswehr being unable to 
achieve the degree of operational readiness that its mandate 
demands." 
  It is true that the Defense Ministry is still in the middle 
of the assessment process, but, the general says, its initial 
assessment has been "that we will no longer be able to achieve 
today's level of operational readiness in 1994/95 in many 
sections of the Army." Units will experience staffing 
shortfalls.

<F P=106> [Report by Ferdos Forudastan: "The Federal Intelligence </F>
Service Will Be Granted More Rights"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 3 February -- In the future, the Federal 
Intelligence Service (BND) will not only be responsible for 
intelligence activities, but will also assume tasks in the fight 
against crime as well. The Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union and Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] adopted 
corresponding legal regulations on Thursday [3 February]. Thus, 
they finally settled differences of opinion on the planned "Law 
on the Fight Against Crime 94," which will probably be discussed 
for the first time by the Bundestag on 24 February. 
  The BND should be allowed to pass on findings on weapons and 
drug deals, money laundering, counterfeiting of money, and 
terrorism, obtained accidentally or on purpose, to the police or 
public prosecutor's offices. According to the current 
regulations, the intelligence services are allowed to tap 
telephone conversations abroad only if the "free and democratic 
order" of the FRG or its security are in peril. 
  The coalition has suggested that the satellites and other 
monitoring equipment of the BND should also be used to register 
conversations on a regular basis that include information 
pointing to serious crimes. The BND should also be allowed to 
eavesdrop on persons if prosecution authorities ask for 
administrative assistance in the event of telephone tapping upon 
judicial order. 
  FDP legal expert Burkhard Hirsch and Detlef Kleinert pointed 
out that the coalition's intention is not to expand the tasks of 
the intelligence service. It only wants to "utilize the 
technical possibilities of the BND," Hirsch stressed. He also 
rejected the allegation that the new law is mixing the tasks of 
the secret services and the police. The BND should merely 
"place its equipment at the disposal of the police and provide 
administrative aid." 
  The draft law also stipulates that offenders who are caught 
red-handed should appear in court within one week in the future 
and be kept in prison until that time. Violent crimes should be 
punished more severely.

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- SPD [Social Democratic Party] 
Chairman Rudolf Scharping has expressed his firm support for the 
integration of Germany into NATO and the European Union (EU). 
NATO and the EU had managed to make relations between the 
member states peaceful in the long-term, Scharping said at the 
conference on security policy today in Munich. The SPD leader 
conceded that sections of his party had not always seen it like 
this in the past. 
  Scharping spoke in favor of integrating all East European 
countries into a European security system. But there would 
possibly be varying degrees and speeds of East European 
integration, he said. 
  It was, however, important to retain "a clear perspective," 
he stressed. In this context the transcript of Scharping's 
speech included a proposal for forming joint military units with 
East European states. Thus, a German-Polish or German-Czech 
corps would be feasible. 
  The SPD was ready to relinquish national sovereignty in 
favor 
of European integration, Scharping added. Automatic obligations 
must not, however, arise with respect to the United Nations. 
Until now the German Government has reserved the right to take 
part in UN measures. This would also remain a "basic conviction 
of German foreign policy" in the event of an SPD-governed German 
Government. In any case, events in Somalia had "not increased 
acceptance of UN obligations"; rather the opposite, Scharping 
added. While the SPD also pursued the goal of a permanent UN 
Security Council seat for Germany, he did not attach any 
"special priority" to this over other tasks. 
  Scharping issued a strong warning against Germany going it 
alone in Europe. Those who thought aloud about Germany 
withdrawing from the European Union -- even only in the sense of 
a legal possibility -- signaled an attempt to abandon European 
integration. Without mentioning names, Scharping was thus 
alluding to remarks by Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber 
(CSU) [Christian Social Union, who criticized the Maastricht 
Treaty as too centralized]. At the same time Scharping stressed 
that there were "no really serious differences" with the present 
German Government as regards foreign and security policy.

<F P=106> [Report from Germany by Vardina Hilu] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin asked 
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to raise the issue of 
navigator Ron Arad's release in his talks with the Iranians so 
as to not let go of the issue. 
  Beilin said this was not a case of lip service, seeing that 
it is inconceivable that Iranian officials should be given an 
audience while Ron Arad is rotting in captivity. 
  During his three-day stay, Deputy Minister Beilin conferred 
with top German Foreign Ministry officials, including the deputy 
foreign minister. 
  Kinkel earlier conferred with Arab League Chairman 
'Abd-al-Majid, who was visiting Bonn. He told Beilin that there 
is a chance the Arab League might lift the boycott on subsidiary 
companies, due to the positive developments in the peace 
process, and that, contrary to his custom, 'Abd-al-Majid sounded 
optimistic about the success of the peace process. 
  Kinkel opined that failure to comply with the timetable for 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho could affect credibility in the 
negotiations with the Palestinians. 
  The foreign minister promised to support Israel and 
facilitate its discussions with the European Union on the 
renewal of trade agreements when Germany has its turn as 
president in the second half of 1994. Also, Germany will 
reconsider its involvement in the multilateral talks in view of 
Israel's contentions that it has neglected and ignored the 
subject compared to Japan and the United States. 
  Kinkel stressed to Beilin that Germany will continue to 
uphold its special bilateral relations with the State of Israel. 
He evinced interest in the referendum on a Golan withdrawal and 
the possibility of intense negotiations with the Syrians in 
anticipation of a peace agreement.

  [Excerpts] The prime minister has declared that his 
government will go ahead with the economic liberalization 
process, ensuring that Indianness and identity of the nation is 
not diminished in any way. He said the present transition in 
the economic sector aims at accomplishing a liberal trading 
regime to overcome the macroeconomic crisis. 
  Mr. Narasimha Rao was speaking at the historic Humboldt 
University in Berlin today. He called for a determined fight 
against prejudices to help create a new humanism based on trust 
and respect for one another. He said we should live up to our 
worthy heritage by harmonizing our energies to promote 
Indo-German relations. The prime minister said it is a matter 
of pride for him to be in a free, united Berlin. [passage 
omitted] 
  Mr. Narasimha Rao is scheduled to inaugurate the Indian 
Cultural Center at Berlin later tonight, before leaving for New 
Delhi at the end of his four-day state visit to Germany. 
  Briefing newsmen, an official spokesman described the prime 
minister's visit to Germany as a landmark. He said the German 
industry and business got the opportunity to have an in-depth 
understanding of what is happening in India on the 
liberalization front. He said the meetings the prime minister 
had with German industrialists provided an opportunity for 
face-to-face interaction.

<F P=106> [Article by Josef Joffe: "From Washington a Present With </F>
Barbs"] 
  [Text] If it was ordered in Washington, then it is a 
present with barbs. The U.S. Senate warned the FRG, of all 
countries, not once, but twice, to finally "fully" participate 
in UN military missions. One resolution was even adopted with 
96 to 1 -- which the "most exclusive club of the world" does not 
do too often. This resolution (which is not binding for anyone) 
asks the Germans to take the "necessary constitutional steps" 
for combat missions under UN auspices. 
  This fits in nicely with the concept of the Kohl/Kinkel 
government, because it can elegantly pass on the pressure: 
first, toward Karlsruhe, where diverse proceedings are still 
pending that should clarify once and for all what can legally be 
done "out of area"; second, toward the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD], which is in favor of "peacekeeping" but not of 
"peacemaking" (that is to say combat) missions. So far, so good. 
  The barbs become visible if one takes a closer look at the 
Senate debate, and they hook up with the ardent desire of 
officials in Bonn to finally be awarded the epaulets of a true 
major power: a permanent seat in the Security Council. The 
Clinton administration has nothing against it, and recently even 
advocated Bonn's promotion in this respect. The senators, 
however, have explicitly asked for a price. Senator William 
Roth put it in the following way: "I do not think that people 
in Tokyo and Bonn today see the indissoluble connection between 
global power and responsibility." In plain English: Those who 
want the epaulets also must accept the burden; one cannot force 
one's way into the cockpit if one reaches for the parachute 
moments before the battle by referring to other obligations. 
  Have officials in Bonn sufficiently analyzed the link 
between 
power and duty? True, they are tired of having to look at the 
five permanent members of the Security Council (United States, 
Britain, France, Russia, and China) as the eternal winners of 
World War II. After all, the united Germany has regained its 
status and, moreover, economically and demographically it is one 
number larger than England and France. And it worries greatly 
(one has said: "I cannot stand it") that "we do not participate 
in the discussions between the Five," but "always remain outside 
the door." 
  Only: Reality is different. Those who watched how Clinton 
flattered Kohl in Washington earlier this week hardly have to 
worry about Germany's importance in international politics. The 
Germans are number two in NATO and the G7 group of 
industrialized nations -- and, with the French, number one in 
the European Union. Wherever Bonn puts forward its interests, it 
gets involved. And where Bonn does not get involved -- in the 
Balkans, where the stake is military strength -- the UN epaulets 
will not be of any use. After all, this is where Bonn does not 
want to join in the game -- for the often mentioned historical 
reasons. 
  Strength [macht] is not derived from wanting [moechten], but 
from doing [machen]. If the Bonn government really wants to 
participate, then it should first clarify whether it is able to 
-- in terms of domestic policy -- and really wants to -- in 
terms of foreign policy.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "Massacre, Power, and Ethics"] </F>
  [Text] The world seemed to have grown used to the constant 
war in Bosnia, when the grenades that struck Sarajevo 
marketplace and killed 66 people taught it otherwise. Will the 
massacre, the climax of the horror so far, change the world and 
its policy? It is by no means certain, because baseness has 
again and again been weighed in the balance and found to be not 
enough to make the West intervene militarily. 
  At the 31st Security Conference in Munich, the traditional 
semiofficial meeting of NATO strategists, U.S. Secretary of 
Defense Perry expressed "horror and outrage," but then the new 
Pentagon chief reverted to the old kind of language. A 
"solution by negotiations" is more urgent than ever and, 
therefore, the international community must exert "maximum 
pressure" on all parties. On whom and how -- he left that open. 
None of the foreign and defense ministers, senators, and 
parliamentarians had a better answer. 
  The answer has not become easier after the debacle in 
Somalia. Whoever wants to intervene in this war of everybody 
against everybody else, must know from the beginning: Against 
whom? Then: What is the goal? Just balancing powers --or 
enforcing a political order, which can never satisfy everyone? 
Finally: Democracies are not reliable providers of order. 
Somalia has shown what democracies can do -- and where they 
fail. 
  As long as the objective was just to feed the hungry, the 
international community did wonderful things. But when it 
prescribed a more ambitions vision for itself -- to disarm and 
punish the fighters -- the debacle took its course. The 
enormous moral stimulus waned, when suddenly the price had to be 
paid in the coin of one's own casualties. And thus, the 
Americans and the Germans will once again look one when the 
Somalis again make "order" in their own way as of April. 
  Of course, it would not be difficult for the highly 
developed 
air forces of the West at least to loosen the grip of the siege 
around Sarajevo and, in addition, change the Serbs' calculation 
of risks. Over 22 months the Serbs have learned that the West 
inflates itself every time, but then collapses like a balloon 
with a hole. Surgical air strikes on vulnerable Serbian 
positions and lines would not make peace, but they would restore 
the credibility that any kind of diplomacy needs as urgently as 
a lever needs power. 
  However, it hardly looks as if the massacre in the 
marketplace will provide the will to use the power. The United 
States hesitates as long as its partners hesitate. Belgium is 
calling for air strikes, but London first wants to find out what 
its blue helmets on site say. In Paris, they sometimes want to 
attack the Serbs and sometimes the Muslims. And the German 
foreign minister passionately calls for what is obvious: "With 
the United States, we must find a way to end the war." 
  It is equally obvious that the Germans can exert pressure 
only very cautiously. At the Munich conference, both Chancellor 
Kohl and his rival Scharping once again presented the all-party 
consensus that the Bundeswehr has no business in the Balkans. 
Even though, in contrast to his position at the 30th 
conference, Kohl does not want to stick categorically to the 
principle that the troops of democratic Germany must never again 
operate in those places where the Wehrmacht once marched in. 
"Historical sensitivities," however, must be respected. 
  Whoever remembers past "military defense" meetings will, 
while still hearing the echo of the mortar grenades, note with 
pleasure that at least two other internal wars have been 
canceled. Germans and Americans demonstrated complete agreement 
on all other issues of "big policy" -- be it Russia, Eastern 
Europe, or the future of NATO. Even more dramatic was the change 
in the course of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] in the 
election year of 1994, which Scharping outlined and which 
reminds one of the change in direction (yes to a link with the 
West) of the early 1960's. "Embrace" was the slogan and 
Scharping's not so secret signal was: "We are amenable to any 
kind of coalition." 
  The SPD chairman only avoided the key question about combat 
operations by the Bundeswehr. However, the Constitutional Court 
will probably give the answer for him in spring. Reportedly, 
Karlsruhe has indicated to Scharping (at least that is what his 
party colleagues are putting about) that the supreme court will 
announce an extremely generous interpretation of those Basic Law 
articles that have been interpreted -- also by the Union in the 
past -- as a ban on out-of-area operations. This would be the 
most practical of all solutions for Scharping, since he could 
then keep the party's leftists quiet by paraphrasing an old 
proverb: Karlsruhe locuta, causa finita -- the court has spoken, 
the matter is closed. 
  The matter of the war in Bosnia will not have been closed by 
then, however. But what will the Germans do when the judges 
have freed them from their self-inflicted ties? Perhaps they 
will look back wistfully to the time when they were still able 
to sit in a quiet corner and leave the decision "to intervene or 
not to intervene" to the others.

<F P=106> [Report signed "ban": "Moderate Interest in Debate on </F>
Constitution"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 4 February -- On Friday [4 February] the 
Bundestag began its discussion on the recommendations of the 
"Joint Constitutional Committee" of the Bundestag and Bundesrat 
on an amendment to the Basic Law with a four-hour debate. The 
basics of the amendment to the Constitution had been set down in 
the "Unification Treaty" negotiated in 1990 between the FRG and 
the still extant GDR. According to the legal politicians of the 
Bundestag groups, the package of laws is to be discussed in the 
Legal Committee in Berlin on 25 May and adopted by the Bundestag 
before the summer recess. Speakers of various Bundestag groups 
regretted that the debate on the Constitution has met with 
little response by the public. Attendance at the first hearing 
in the Bundestag confirmed that. Parallel to this first 
hearing, the leaders and the Bundestag group of the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] made their decision on a 
successor to Education Minister Ortleb, who had resigned, and 
during the debate Interior Minister Kanther, Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU], and Justice Minister 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) presented a package of laws on 
internal security. 
  CDU Deputy Scholz and Hamburg Mayor Voscherau, Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], the chairmen of the 
Constitutional Committee, paid tribute to the body's work. 
Scholz said the Basic Law is the "best constitution in German 
history." The success of the Constitutional Committee must not 
be measured solely by the number of proposals for amendments. 
Voscherau said a more intensive debate in a larger body 
(Constitutional Council) could have done more for Germany's 
internal unity. However, the chance to contribute to Germany's 
unity through discussions on the Constitution should not be 
overestimated. The Constitutional Committee's work also 
confirmed the quality of the Basic Law in those places where no 
changes have been proposed. 
  The recommendations of the Constitutional Committee, which 
have been presented as a draft law by the groups of the 
CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU], SPD, and FDP, as well as by 
the Bundesrat, apply to the list of basic laws, the relationship 
between the Federal Government and laender regarding 
legislation, as well as to the new structuring of the laender. 
In order to achieve equal rights of the sexes, the following 
sentence is to be included in Article 3: "The state promotes 
the actual implementation of equal rights for women and men and 
is working to abolish existing disadvantages." Furthermore, the 
Constitutional Committee agreed on two new regulations on state 
goals. One refers to environmental protection (in a new Article 
20a): "Being responsible also for future generations, the state 
protects the natural bases of life within the framework of the 
constitutional order through legislation and, on the basis of 
law and order, by the executive branch and jurisdiction." 
Another regulation on a state goal refers to minority 
protection (Article 20b): "The state respects the identity of 
ethnic, cultural, and linguistic minorities." 
  In future the self-administration of the communities is 
"also" to comprise "the basis of financial responsibility." The 
new structuring of the laender is to require the approval of the 
Bundestag, following a state treaty and referendums in the 
affected laender; the unification of the laender of Berlin and 
Brandenburg is to be made possible in accordace with that. 
Concerning competing legislation, the rights of the Bundesrat 
are to be expanded. The framework legislation of the Federal 
Government for the university sector is to be limited to certain 
basics (admission, course of studies, exams, university 
degrees). The Bundesrat's rights to participate in legislation 
are to be improved by extending deadlines. 
  Mr. Jahn, the constitutional policy spokesman of the CDU/CSU 
group, made it clear in the debate that his group has 
reservations about some recommendations of the Constitutional 
Committee and will probably reject them in the course of further 
debate. Jahn cited the university sector, where, in contrast to 
the currently valid laws, the Federal Government would lose its 
responsibility for the structure and tasks of the universities, 
for research and university self-administration, as well as for 
the recognition of university institutions. This might 
contribute to the German university developing in different 
directions and might endanger the recognition of university 
degrees. "German universities would lose their relevance for 
Europe." Jahn pointed out that the majority of the CDU/CSU 
group rejected the recommendations on minority protection. 
Individual minority protection is already guaranteed in the 
Basic Law. The recommendation of the Constitutional Committee, 
which goes beyond that, might promote the demand for double 
citizenship or for a "duty to respect linguistic identity" (e.g. 
bilingual schools). 
  As the main speaker of his group, former SPD Chairman Vogel 
regretted the fact that the Constitutional Committee has not 
been able to agree on more far-reaching regulations on state 
goals and on plebiscitary elements for the Basic Law. These 
have been presented as an independent draft law by the SPD 
group. Vogel called for social state goals (employment, 
housing, education,and social security), as well as the 
possibility of a referendum. He recalled corresponding 
formulations in the Constitution of the GDR People's Chamber, 
which was freely elected in 1990, and also that such regulations 
be set down in a number of land constitutions. 
  Jahn stressed that the CDU/CSU group will stick to its 
rejection of the SPD's more far-reaching demands. 
Representative democracy has proved its worth. Referendums 
weaken federalism and devalue the parliament. There is "no 
reason for a total revision of the Basic Law." 
  In the debate it became clear that the demand that 
"fellowship [Mitmenschlichkeit] and community spirit" be set 
down in the Basic Law has a chance of receiving a two-thirds 
majority. It would be the only amendment to the Basic Law that 
did not get the required majority in the Constitutional 
Committee. So far, a legal initiative has been signed by 345 
deputies. Vogel advocated it. On behalf of the CDU/CSU group, 
Jahn said that even though there is no need for action from the 
juridical point of view on this matter, there may be "legal 
policy" reasons for it. The CDU/CSU group has deliberately left 
its options open. 
  FDP legal politician Kleinert expressly said: "Not very much 
is to be moved." This is required by the respect for the valid 
Basic Law. The citizen must not be patronized by the 
Constitution. Deviating from the coalition line, Hirsch 
advocated plebiscitary elements in the Basic Law; these could 
counter the disenchantment with policy. On behalf of Alliance 
90/Greens, Deputy Ullmann criticized the fact that a referendum 
on the amended Basic law has been rejected. Germany's unity has 
not yet been completed. Saxony's Justice Minister Heitmann (CDU) 
contradicted that, saying that the great majority of GDR 
citizens wanted the Basic Law, but "not to immediately tinker

<F P=106> [Report signed "nf": "Unemployment Will Remain High Over </F>
the Next Few Years"] 
  [Text] Nuremberg, 4 February -- Federal Employment Office 
Bernhard Jagoda (Christian Democratic Union) has no hopes for a 
lasting decline in unemployment in Germany. At the end of this 
decade, when the labor market in the old and new laender will 
have grown together, Jagoda still expects about 3.4 million 
unemployed. This winter the 4 million threshold will probably be 
"touched or even crossed"; an initial recovery can only be 
expected in spring. Unemployment will be a decisive topic in the 
forthcoming election campaign. The Christian Democrat stresses 
that he wants neither to downplay nor to dramatize the 
situation. One can rely on his loyalty even in the event of a 
change in government, stresses Jagoda, whose term of office 
lasts until 2001. 
  He thinks the frequent comparisons with the economic 
situation in the 1920's are dangerous: "Bonn is not Weimar." 
One must view the unemployment figures in relation to the 
potential of the working people, which was far smaller at that 
time -- then the "marked difference" becomes clear. In 
addition, it is "inappropriate" to add the 2.1 million people 
who were spared the loss of the jobs through labor market policy 
measures last year to the unemployed. This great easing of the 
burden on the labor market is, rather, an indication of the 
Federal Employment Office's successful work. 
  In addition, Jagoda stresses that his office filled almost 3 
million jobs in the difficult year of 1993. However, one does 
not want to rest on these laurels. This month special 
"mediation teams" will be established and largely released from 
any other tasks. Vacant jobs can then be filled even more 
quickly than in the past, hopes Jagoda. 
  This year the Federal Employment Office must, however, make 
do with even scarcer financial means. "It is difficult to cut 
away something when the dress is already tight," says Jagoda, 
referring to the 3.9 billion German marks [DM] in cutbacks of 
the 1994 draft budget. With a view to the Federal Government's 
constrained financial situation, which paid about DM24.5 billion 
to the Federal Employment Office last year, Jagoda also shows 
understanding for the savings measures: "The Federal Employment 
Office, too, is affected by the constraints of the moment," he 
defends himself against occasional criticism that his office 
does not utilize all promised means. From industry Jagoda 
demanded "the iron will to stay competitive on the world 
market." This can be achieved only through "new products and 
top quality." The current restructuring of companies is the 
correct path toward more competitiveness and employment. It is 
also necessary, however, to orient oneself more vigorously 
toward the rising national economies and improve the 
coordination of European research. 
  Jagoda also hopes that flexible work time models and more 
intensive use of part-time work will provide strong stimuli to 
employment. By doubling the German ratio of part-time work to 
the Dutch value of about 34 percent, the FRG could have about 2 
million less unemployed, estimates Jagoda. Decoupling 
individual work time from machine time, too, is necessary to 
clearly raise productivity. "We must become much more creative," 
he admonished. Jagoda sees other possibilities to raise 
employment in environmental protection and by using people who 
are obliged to have social insurance in private households as 
well as in nursing care; in outpatient care alone about 150,000 
employees are needed. 
  Jagoda also wants to raise efficiency in his own office. 
Simplifying official procedures and improving the use of 
information technology play as important a role as 
decentralization. At the moment, a study is being conducted on 
which jobs -- beyond the already existing budgets for advance 
training, retraining, and job creation measures -- could be 
taken over by the local labor exchange offices on their own 
responsibility.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Revolutionary Heritage"] </F>
  [Text] Former members and fans of the National People's 
Army (NVA) of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] regime 
plan to found a traditional association on 1 March. According 
to the preliminary statute, anyone "who is committed to the 
revolutionary heritage of the NVA" and does not "serve in armed 
FRG organs" can become a member. 
  The East Berlin comrades, who are looking for 
fellow-fighters 
to "preserve our ideals" in NEUES DEUTSCHLAND and by circular 
letters, have a clear enemy image: "According to the will of 
the occupiers, everything was supposed to be abolished through 
the counterrevolution in autumn 1989." The protest slogan of 
the NVA nostalgics: "Let's not put up with that!" 
  The response is still meager. Nevertheless, the Bundeswehr 
Association reacts nervously to the "alarm signal." In an open 
letter, Berlin District Chairman Herbert Becker, a former NVA 
lieutenant colonel, warns all 25,000 former NVA soldiers in the 
capital against this "extremist organization." In the future 
traditional association, which wants to "decide" contentious 
issues "in an authoritarian manner if necessary," one can 
"continue holding one's former service rank." And one who has 
not yet flogged his NVA uniform on flea markets or to souvenir 
shops "can" wear it "at closed events." The first opportunity: 
"Our day of honor" on 1 March, 38 years after the founding of 
the NVA -- provided that the initiators of the association 
manage to settle "some organizational problems" by then. So 
far, only about a dozen activists have rallied, and they are 
industriously preparing the NVA resurrection project.

  [Text] Lower Saxony's Republikaner are now being watched 
by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution 
(BfV). This is the BfV's reaction to a court ruling that 
prohibited colleagues from the Lower Saxony Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution to watch Franz Schoenhuber's 
rightist-populist party. The background: The red-green Lower 
Saxony has a particularly restrictive constitutional protection 
law. According to the ruling, the Land Office may use 
intelligence service means against political parties only if 
these parties struggle against the Basic Law in a "militant and 
aggressive manner." The BfV is affected neither by the land law 
nor by the negative ruling.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- With the entertainment concern 
Bertelsmann AG, the Munich film trader Leo Kirch, the Multimedia

pay television business. This was reported by Telekom Executive 
Board member Dieter Gallist. Telekom thinks that 19 million 
households in Germany are now "qualified for pay television" -- 
but only 5 percent are subscribers to pay television. The share 
is already 17 percent in France and 55 percent in England, it 
was stated.

  [Text] We now join our correspondent Philippe Lefebvre. 
Philippe, you are near the prefecture building? Is French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur still inside? 
  [Lefebvre] Yes, I am behind the gates of the prefecture 
building. Edouard Balladur is inside the regional council 
building, but the situation has for an hour now been very tense 
around the prefecture building. Police and the demonstrators 
are clashing with Molotov cocktails and teargas bombs. The gas 
smoke can be seen reaching the windows of the prefecture. It 
was in this climate that Edouard Balladur met the delegates of 
the fishermen for 10 minutes or so. He confirmed to them that 
he will take the necessary measures at the national level to 
support this industry even if Brussels refuses to back down on 
the minimum price issue. 
  This is the information that Dominique Lapart, the leader of 
the Committee for the Survival of the Fisheries Industry, wanted 
to communicate to the demonstrators but could not because of 
teargas bombs, which are making any movement between the 
prefecture and the Rennes city center, where the situation is 
very tense, impossible. 
  The fact that Dominique Lapart has not managed to make this 
announcement will not calm the situation in the next few 
minutes.

  [Excerpts] There are signs of progress in the fishing 
dispute. Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech 
announced after four hours of talks with a fishermen's 
delegation in Rennes that Brussels has agreed to reintroduce 
minimum prices on certain species of fish. Here is an extract 
from the minister's news conference, which finished a moment ago: 
  [Begin Puech recording] Regarding crews and families, the 
social aspect has, I believe, been dealt with as was requested. 
I now turn to the issue of prices, of markets. We are 
implementing, as I indicated the other day, the means that are 
available: 50 million francs have been released immediately for 
producers' organizations, so that they can intervene 
efficiently. [passage omitted] 
  We have also obtained agreement from the European Commission 
in Brussels that minimum prices should be reintroduced. Minimum 
prices are once again operative. [end recording] 
  Philippe Lefebvre, you are in front of the regional council 
building. I suppose that the fishermen's delegation will now 
try to sell these proposals to their members and to calm them 
down a bit. 
  [Lefebvre] Yes, the delegation led by Dominique Lapart went 
down to Rue Gambetta, near the regional council building, about 
10 minutes ago to try to calm the fishermen's anger. Their 
efforts appear, however, to have been in vain, since the crowd 
immediately began chanting: We have not obtained anything. They 
are not satisfied with Puech's measures. Some of them intend to 
stay in Rennes tonight. The town can brace itself for the 
worse. Some of the fishermen will be leaving, but they have 
announced their intention to stop on the way to empty more cases 
of imported fish in warehouses somewhere between Rennes and 
their final destination. 
  This is all we can say for now. So, to sum up, we have had 
two reactions to the measures announced: a rather calm welcome 
from the delegates, but their members seem rather disappointed, 
and clashes are continuing near the town hall between 
demonstrators and riot police.

  [Excerpts] Le Havre, France, Feb 4 (AFP) -- French 
fishermen blockaded this Channel port Friday [4 February] saying 
that government measures to protect the industry were not enough. 
  Twenty fishing vessels sealed off the major French port, 
immobilising three freighters inside while a ferry from Plymouth 
was forced to wait offshore. 
  Fishing boats from Honfleur across the Seine estuary 
meanwhile blocked the entrance to the river and the inland port 
at Rouen. 
  The Havre fishermen complained they would not get "one cent" 
of aid promised by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in 
negotiations Friday with Brittany fishermen in Rennes, the 
Brittany capital. [passage omitted] 
  In the Mediterranean port of Marseille, more than a tonne of 
fish from Algeria and Senegal was held up by health inspectors 
who said the catches did not have the right documents. 
  On Thursday, French authorities ordered stricter checks on 
imported fish as protestors blamed imports for a collapse in 
prices.

  [Text] Marseille, France, Feb 7 (AFP) -- Riot police 
firing tear gas and using a water cannon on Monday [7 February] 
cleared Marseille's port of ship repair workers who occupied it 
last week in a bid to save their jobs. 
  Dockers immediately called a sympathy strike with workers of 
the Sud-Marine ship repair yard, vowing not to return to work 
until police were withdrawn. 
  A total of 615 Sud-Marine workers welded up the port gates 
last Wednesday occupying it round-the-clock. Freight handling 
was paralysed and some ferry traffic was diverted to the nearby 
port of Toulon. 
  A court ordered the bankrupt Sud-Marine into liquidation on 
January 6, setting a February 15 deadline for it to sell off its 
assets and fire the 615. 
  The dockers' strike paralysed the whole of the port on 
Monday, including the oil and chemicals terminal at Fos-sur-Mer 
in the west. The Sud-Marine action had affected only the eastern 
part of the port.

Ahtisaari by unidentified reporter -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Reporter] Martti Ahtissari, your words to the 
voters, both your own supporters and Elisabeth Rehn's supporters? 
  [Ahtisaari] Of course, first of all I would like to thank 
Elisabeth Rehn for a good and fair campaign. I think that is 
quite an essential factor, for which I want to thank Elisabeth 
Rehn. I also hope that the people who voted for Elisabeth Rehn 
can also give their support for me in these new and difficult 
tasks. At the same time, of course, I want to thank all those 
who have taken part in my campaign, thousands of volunteers in 
various parts of Finland. I am very grateful to all of them and 
to all of you, good friends. Without your work these elections 
would never have ended as they did. 
  [Reporter] The nation is not divided? 
  [Ahtisaari] I would say that the future president will face 
very difficult tasks, both in the economy, politics, 
internationally, and then it is important that the nation is not 
divided over these issues, and I will insure that I will be seen 
as the president of the entire country. This is the way I 
intend to take things forward. In fact, during my entire 
campaign I have stressed that the Finnish nation must not be 
divided over these issues. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Martti Ahtisaari by </F>
Maria Romantschuk; place and date not given: "Impossible To 
Cooperate With Someone Who Lies"] 
  [Text] If Martti Ahtisaari becomes president, Paavo 
Vayrynen will not become foreign minister. Ahtisaari is 
determined never to appoint Vayrynen to a position that has to 
work in close cooperation with the president. 
  What Elisabeth Rehn has that Ahtisaari does not have is 
"those two dogs." 
  [Romantschuk] Did you think two years ago that you would be 
in this situation today? 
  [Ahtisaari] Never in a million years. The answer is clearly 
no. 
  [Romantschuk] What would you change in today's Finland? 
  [Ahtisaari] I would like to reduce unemployment, of course. 
It is the greatest threat to Finland. 
  [Romantschuk] You have said that you acquired economic 
insight by being a member of Suur-Helsingin Osuuspankki's board 
of governors, but you say you rarely participated in the 
meetings. How does that compute? 
  [Ahtisaari] That is not the only way in which I have become 
acquainted with economic issues. I carefully follow all the 
economic studies made in Finland on the development. When I was 
abroad, I also got material from EVA [Committee of Commerce and 
Industry] and the various branches of industry. 
  [Romantschuk] Are you worried about the future? 
  [Ahtisaari] I am not worried. I want a change, and of course 
I am concerned that the present development trends appear to be 
continuing, particularly unemployment with all that it entails. 
I want a more active employment policy. 
  [Romantschuk] How would you try to influence public opinion 
in order to protect the environment? 
  [Ahtisaari] First of all, I would like to change the 
attitudes. I have a feeling that at the end of the nineties we 
will experience a discussion similar to the one in the sixties 
and seventies on foreign aid activity. It is being replaced by 
the environmental issues, and one must hope that it will pull 
the foreign aid issues into focus with it. As president, I would 
like to be active on the international plane, of course. 
  [Romantschuk] What can membership in the EU [European Union] 
give us? 
  [Ahtisaari] I hope that it will give us a more secure 
future, 
with economic growth and more viable rural areas and better 
employment. 
  [Romantschuk] What are the implications if we stay outside 
the union? 
  [Ahtisaari] Then we absolutely do not want to participate 
when decisions are made about the development in the EU, which 
will affect what we do, without in that case having tried to 
shape its policy so that it would favor us. 
  [Romantschuk] Can we have security without membership in WEU 
[Western European Union] or NATO? 
  [Ahtisaari] We will have greater security through economic 
cooperation, of course. All kinds of cooperation increases 
security since it helps to solve conflicts between the nations 
and in that way it increases security. Being a part of the 
expansion process gives us psychological security. The important 
thing is that we are involved in developing a general European 
security system that includes everything. 
  [Romantschuk] Do you call what is going on in Bosnia 
genocide? 
  [Ahtisaari] It is difficult to call it genocide. It can 
almost be called whatever one wants; I would say it is more a 
crime against humanity. In today's situation everyone is killing 
everyone there. It has become a tremendously difficult task to 
solve. 
  [Romantschuk] Why was this permitted to happen in today's 
Europe? 
  [Ahtisaari] Because there is no solution unless you want to 
force the three parties into a solution. The situation has 
developed in such a way that if there were an attempt to achieve 
a solution by punishing one of the parties, we would never reach 
a solution. 
  We must find a common factor and I know that Owen and 
Stoltenberg are desperately trying to. 
  [Romantschuk] Do you approve of a bombing attack in the name 
of NATO or the UN against the Serbian forces outside Sarajevo? 
  [Ahtisaari] I see no special benefit in bombing them as a 
punitive measure. If one only wants to punish, one must know 
what it will lead to. What will happen is that they will 
immediately attack the UN forces. It does not matter that they 
are humanitarian workers or peacekeeping forces. 
  One must consider what is more important. The entire world 
feels better for having punished the Serbs and it leads to an 
end to the international involvement and the war continues. 
These are difficult issues that those who actively want the 
world to begin bombing Serbian artillery and tanks have not 
thought through properly. 
  [Romantschuk] Do you approve of the Bosnian embargo? 
  [Ahtisaari] Yes, I have all along. All the experience, from 
both Rhodesia and South Africa, shows that if you have money you 
can buy almost anything. 
  We have been happy that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is no longer 
threatening Finland, but are we thereby abandoning the Baltic 
region? 
  No. All the time we have said that the Baltic region must 
cultivate relations with its neighbors, no one can replace the 
responsibility of the political leadership to take care of 
foreign relations. This requires a certain responsibility. 
  As for the presence of foreign troops, we have stuck to the 
international principles that there must be negotiations. We 
have been very consistent there. 
  [Romantschuk] Should we still support Yeltsin alone? 
  [Ahtisaari] We are cooperating with the government that 
exists in the country. The one that has been democratically 
elected; we cooperate the same way with any other democratic 
country. Russia has now had democratic elections, so it is quite 
natural that you support the policy that the government is 
trying to pursue. 
  [Romantschuk] Do you believe that you would be better at the 
job of elementary school teacher? 
  [Ahtisaari] No. That would in any case require a certain 
training period. If I had two or three weeks I would probably be 
able to. Particularly a class at the same level I had before, 
that is to say sixth grade. 
  [Romantschuk] After the first round was decided you said 
that 
Rehn was your favorite opponent from the beginning. Why? 
  [Ahtisaari] At the time I thought it meant we would get an 
active and interesting debate, during which our opinions would 
become clearer to the public. What we have achieved and not 
achieved. What the difference is between what we say and what we 
do. A factual but tough discussion. 
  [Romantschuk] Has the campaign become dirty? 
  [Ahtisaari] Not yet. 
  [Romantschuk] Is it threatening to get dirty? 
  [Ahtisaari] I hope that it does not. I am dissatisfied with 
the accusations that have been made, of course. 
  [Romantschuk] Is government policy the only thing for which 
you can attack Rehn? 
  [Ahtisaari] It is really enough, in my opinion. If you look 
at what the government has achieved with its economic policy, it 
is higher unemployment. 
  [Romantschuk] What do you value in people? 
  [Ahtisaari] Honesty. 
  [Romantschuk] Is it possible to ingratiate oneself with you? 
  [Ahtisaari] One might try, but one will no longer be 
successful. I always work with people who know that I demand 
honesty. 
  [Romantschuk] Who has influenced you the most? 
  [Ahtisaari] There are many people. First of all, the family, 
of course. I have lived in a very warm and honest home 
environment, very simple, but where tenderness and love were 
shown. It has been completely natural for me to be patriotic and 
positive toward defense. When you live in a barracks environment 
until you are 20 years old, some of it comes with the mother's 
milk. My father was also deeply religious. 
  I learned from my father how to treat people. He is one of 
the finest people I have known, who did not mix into other 
people's affairs. 
  George Houser, who was active regarding human rights in the 
United States. He was active long before it was popular. Another 
is Ed May, who worked in the same field. Persons who lived as 
they taught. 
  [Romantschuk] Whom would you like to see as the next prime 
minister? 
  [Ahtisaari] First, I want to see what happens in the 
parliamentary election. It is then quite normal that the party 
that won the election is asked to try to form a government. 
  [Romantschuk] Kalevi Sorsa said in an interview with 
HUFVUDSTADSBLADET recently that he is prepared for new 
challenges. Is there room for him in Ahtisaari's realm? 
  [Ahtisaari] His party will have to decide that. The same 
goes 
for Paavo Vayrynen. 
  [Romantschuk] Do you still insist that Paavo Vayrynen cannot 
become foreign minister? 
  [Ahtisaari] That is quite clear. It is completely impossible 
to maintain close cooperation with a person who lies. 
  [Romantschuk] Can he become a minister at all? 
  [Ahtisaari] That is a decision for his own party. 
  [Romantschuk] Who will become head of the cabinet office? 
  [Ahtisaari] All in good time. I will not begin to furnish 
Talluden or the cabinet office until I am president. 
  [Romantschuk] Will there be room for Lasse Lehtinen? 
  [Ahtisaari] I do not think he will seek a job in my 
administration. Why would he want to reduce his standard of 
living? 
  [Romantschuk] Can the president's foreign policy power be 
parliamentarized so that even on foreign policy matters his/her 
decisions are tied to the government, which should also enjoy 
the confidence of parliament? 
  [Ahtisaari] The practice we have is good. I would like to 
increase the informal contacts with parliament in the form of a 
foreign policy council, as an advisory organ. It is important in 
view of achieving a joint security and foreign policy. 
  [Romantschuk] Will you actively work for a constitutional 
reform? 
  [Ahtisaari] No, I will not. I believe that we must learn to 
understand the importance of the parliamentary election. Not 
voting one day and demanding an immediate change the next. 
  [Romantschuk] Are you aiming at two or is one presidential 
mandate period enough? 
  [Ahtisaari] The offer is only for one. After that, one must 
look at the situation in the country and make a critical 
analysis of what has been accomplished. 
  [Romantschuk] Could you imagine being a candidate in the 
campaign six years from now, if things do not work out this time? 
  [Ahtisaari] I absolutely refuse to think of anything but 
this 
round. 
  [Romantschuk] What could go wrong for you? 
  [Ahtisaari] Nothing, if people want an honest analysis of 
what I represent, what I say, and what I have done. And of what 
Elisabeth Rehn is saying and what she has done when she was part 
of the government's policies. 
  [Romantschuk] Is Finland ready for a female president? 
  [Ahtisaari] That is not what it is about. I looked at Rehn's 
"Have a Nice President" button and thought I ought to have one 
just like it but with the text "Have a Competent President." 
  [Romantschuk] Do you have a favorite philosopher? 
  [Ahtisaari] Myself and then my son. 
  [Romantschuk] Who is your favorite author? 
  [Ahtisaari] I read so much that has direct ties to my work. 
  I like to read poetry. 
  [Romantschuk] What is your favorite food? 
  [Ahtisaari] Filet of perch. 
  [Romantschuk] Have you benefited from belonging to the SDP 
[Social Democratic Party]? 
  [Ahtisaari] I do not know. Some have argued that I have had 
a 
rapid career, but I think I proved to them all with my 
international career that it was justified. Party books are no 
help there. 
  [Romantschuk] Kekkonen actively redressed grievances based 
on 
letters from citizens. Which concrete measures would you take if 
a sick citizen complains he is not getting the care he needs 
because he cannot afford it? 
  [Ahtisaari] I would absolutely ask the Ministry of Health to 
investigate it immediately. 
  [Romantschuk] What do you have that Elisabeth Rehn does not? 
  [Ahtisaari] I have a completely different background and 
international experience and familiarity with negotiation that 
very few people have. 
  [Romantschuk] What does she have that you do not have? 
  [Ahtisaari] Those two dogs that her coworkers gave her.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with presidential candidate Elisabeth Rehn </F>
by reporter Jouni Turunen -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Turunen] Well, Elisabeth Rehn, 70 percent of the 
votes have now been counted and the result does not seem to 
change. Has the moment now come when admitting defeat is topical? 
  [Rehn] No doubt the time has come. As I have said, I want to 
see at least 70 percent, looking at past experience. Now that 
number has been counted and the trend is not leveling, but on 
the contrary, the difference seems to be growing, so I concede 
very willingly that Martti is the winner. I have been 
repeatedly asked that defeat must be conceded and if everybody 
is happy for me to make that admission, I will give it gladly. 
But believe it or not, I am immensely proud that I have 
achieved this result because it is against all expectations. 
All possible barriers have been broken here and I think this is 
splendid as far as I am concerned. 
  [Turunen] The dramatic moment of these elections has thus 
been experienced. Elisabeth Rehn has conceded defeat to Martti 
Ahtisaari. In brief, why did you lose this campaign, what 
decided this? 
  [Rehn] I would leave that option to various analysts; I am 
no 
election expert. I myself know that I had a good campaign with 
small resources. I had no party machinery behind me, but jolly 
amateurs, enthusiasts, eager people were behind me, and we 
worked hard and happily. What makes me most happy is that we 
never took the dirty road. I can look at myself in the mirror 
and so can my election staff, so I am really satisfied. 
  [Turunen] What will Elisabeth Rehn do after this? 
  [Rehn] I will go to the election party. 
  [Turunen] In politics? 
  [Rehn] I hold the post of defense minister and will stick to 
that as long as the government is in power. I am a parliament 
deputy, we have parliament elections in just over a year. Let 
us see then what I will do. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Yesterday was another [word indistinct] day in the 
senseless war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as 60 persons died 
following a mortar explosion in Sarajevo's central market. 
Another 150 persons were injured, many of whom are in critical 
condition. Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alia Izetbegovic 
accused the Serbs, whereas Radovan Karadzic, leader of the 
Bosnian Serbs attributed the attack to a Muslim provocation in 
order to establish a negative climate against the Serbs. 
  This murderous attack against noncombatants has been 
strongly 
condemned by the United States and other countries. In a 
written statement yesterday, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher notes that his country will press for the United 
Nations to specify soon who is responsible for the deadly attack 
in Sarajevo. He also warned that air strikes by NATO should not 
be ruled out once it is determined who is responsible. He 
announced that he had a telephone conversation with his British 
counterpart on the issue and will hold more deliberations with 
other allied countries. 
  The French Foreign Ministry condemned yesterday's massacre 
in 
Sarajevo, saying that France feels horror and disgust. The 
Italian and Belgian foreign ministers asked for specific 
measures in reaction to the attack. 
  In the meantime, talks on ending the hostilities in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will resume again. The Muslims will finally 
participate in the talks, despite expressing reservations 
yesterday. 
  Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, international mediators 
on the Yugoslav dispute announced yesterday that the foreign 
ministers of Greece, Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, 
Hungary, Italy, and Austria will meet Wednesday [9 February] in 
Geneva to enforce the peace efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a 
statement regarding the Geneva meeting, the Greek Foreign 
Ministry notes that the Greek presidency of the European Union 
[EU] intends to examine along with its partners at the EU 
Council of General Affairs meeting, which will take place 
Monday, the reason and usefulness of this meeting at this time. 
According to the statement, Greece will insist on the principle 
that only countries which have borders with the former 
Yugoslavia should participate.

  [Text] Athens, Feb. 4, IRNA--Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou Friday [4 February] received visiting Iranian Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and discussed bilateral relations 
and regional and international issues. 
  They did not make any press statements but an Iranian 
diplomatic source told IRNA after the 45-minute meeting that the 
talks "went very well." 
  "They discussed bilateral relations and the situation in the 
Balkans and the Middle East." 
  Meanwhile, Balkan Greece and the Islamic Republic of Iran 
are 
to exert joint efforts to end the bloodshed in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina (B-H). 
  "I will soon contact Bosnian President Mr. (Alija) 
Izetbegovic, with whom we have close ties, to discuss the 
European Union's (EU) peace proposal, but peace should be just 
and honorable," Velayati made it clear to reporters after talks 
with his Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias. 
  The Greek minister said he briefed Velayati on the efforts 
of 
the EU to find peace in B-H, and added that Greece as the 
current president of the EU, will exert efforts for peace in B-H. 
  Velayati and Papoulias held 60-minutes of talks on a wide 
range of issues before being joined by the delegations of the 
two countries. 
  Papoulias said they discussed issues of common interest, the 
Balkans and the situation in former Yugoslavia, and Velayati 
briefed him on the problems in the Persian Gulf region. 
  "We held very significant talks and we reached good results 
in all sectors," the Greek foreign minister stressed. 
  He said Velayati will send a special envoy to Athens to meet 
with Greek economy undersecretary to discuss ways to boost 
bilateral commercial and economic ties. 
  Velayati described the talks as "very friendly," and said he 
had extended an invitation to his Greek counterpart to visit 
Tehran. A Greek diplomatic source told IRNA Papoulias is 
expected to visit the Islamic Republic in March. 
  Earlier, speaking to IRNA, Papoulias said Athens will help 
in 
promoting EU-Iran dialogue and in bringing Tehran closer to the 
12-member European bloc. Greece assumed the rotating six-month 
EU presidency on January 1. 
  When asked about his recent talks in Washington, Papoulias 
declined to disclose the contents of his discussions with senior 
American officials. 
  Velayati arrived in Athens Thursday night for a 24-hour 
working visit, accompanied by Hoseyn Nuqrekar Shirazi, deputy 
commerce minister, 'Ali Ahani, the director of West European 
affairs at Iran's Foreign Ministry, Ibrahim Rahimpour, director 
of East European affairs, and other Foreign Ministry officials. 
  Greece was the third leg of Velayati's Balkan tour. He 
visited Bulgaria and Romania and will fly to Turkey Friday 
afternoon. 
  The Iranian foreign minister will meet the leader of the 
Political Spring Party Antonis Samaras before leaving Athens. 
  Samaras visited Tehran in 1991 when he was the foreign 
minister under the conservative new democracy government. 
  An Iranian diplomatic source told IRNA that Velayati's visit 
to Bulgaria and Romania was of outmost important. "We have an 
annual trade exchange of around dlrs 1 billion with Bulgaria and 
Romania together, 70 percent of which is Iran's oil exports," 
the diplomat told IRNA requesting anonymity. 
  He said Tehran has welcomed the new atmosphere in East 
Europe, "the atmosphere of freedom, democracy and parliament." 
  Iran was thinking of opening an embassy in the only European 
Muslim-majority state of Albania, he added.

  [Text] Athens, Feb. 4, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Minister 
'Ali Akbar Velayati left Athens for Istanbul Friday afternoon [4 
February] after ending a brief but hectic 24-hour important 
working visit to Greece. 
  Greek state-run televison channel ET-2 said Velayati's talks 
with Greek Government officials produced "positive results" in 
advancing bilateral realtions. 
  Velayati met and discussed a wide range of issues including 
the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Middle East with 
Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias, and parliament President Apostolos Kaklamanis. 
  Papoulias said his talks with Velayati were of "special 
significance" and "they achieved positive results in all 
sectors." 
  Talking to IRNA parliament speaker Kakalmanis noted that "we 
had very friendly talks with the Iranian foreign minister which 
underscores the close ties between our two peoples and 
countries." 
  "I believe that this visit and his talks in Athens will 
contribute in strengthening the excellent relations and 
cooperation," he added. 
  Mass-selling afternoon Greek daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA said 
Velayati's visit "uinderlines the positive climate in 
Greek-Iranian relations, as well as Iran's interests in the 
developments in the Balkans and in promotion of Iran's relations 
with Europe." 
  Greece currently holds the European Union (EU) presidency.

  [Excerpt] With the rally that took place this morning in 
Rome and with the unveiling of his manifesto, Silvio Berlusconi 
officially entered the world of politics. He said that he 
wanted to defeat the Left by allying himself with all the 
moderate forces. He does not exclude Umberto Bossi or 
Gianfranco Fini. He is convinced that he is the only one capable 
of relaunching the Italian economy. Let us hear what he says. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Moderates from all over Italy 
are united in defeating the Left. This is the cry with which 
Berlusconi is leading his Forza Italia troops in the hard 
electoral battle. The enemy to defeat is the Left and the 
Liberals, and his allies are all the moderate forces that draw 
their inspiration from liberal-democratic politics. However, 
and this is perhaps Berlusconi's weak point, he wants to draw in 
the Right in the form of Fini and Bossi, who have nothing to do 
with the liberal-democratic tradition. The messages of 
Berlusconi are clear and direct and they are spread by an 
imposing propaganda machine. Berlusconi said that Forza Italia 
was born out of the desire of common people to turn a page, of 
wanting to restore solidity and usefulness to politics. Enough 
with professional politicians, Berlusconi said, what is needed 
are new people anchored to civil society. 
  The values that Berlusconi referred to were the classic ones 
of Western culture -- liberty, the individual, enterprise, the 
family, and the Christian tradition. In contrast to Bossi, 
although the two men are recent allies, Berlusconi considers the 
unity of Italy to be inviolable. The manifesto of the new 
movement aims to combat crime and to create new jobs. 
  [Begin Berlusconi recording] To the unemployed today we can 
say, we can guarantee that these concerns will end, that we know 
how to relaunch the Italian economy. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] Berlusconi does not like the nanny-state 
that 
he says, keeps over half of incomes. Therefore, less taxation 
and a spirited defense of the self-employed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the </F>
Democratic Party of the Left, by Sebastiano Messina; place and 
date not given: "Occhetto: Our Front Is Stable; Stop Being 
Childish"--first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] "Stop being childish," [Democratic Party of the 
Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto has said to those who 
threaten to undermine the progressive forces' alignment with 
"too many preconditions." He issued the following warning: 
"Let us unite, because this will be a very tough battle. This 
time we are dealing not with the old DC [Christian Democratic 
Party] but with something much more dangerous -- a new right 
that could alter this country's face for the worse." 
  [Messina] What is happening? Is the progressive front 
already falling apart? 
  [Occhetto] No, if anything, it is Segni's Pact that is 
falling apart. We progressive forces signed a solemn agreement 
just a few days ago; we all signed it. Of course, some problems 
have been raised, but we will resolve them. The Greens will 
examine some of the issues at their meeting Sunday [6 February]. 
  [Messina] The Greens were angered when they saw how many 
candidates they would be fielding. Now they are saying that 
unless the election of at lest 30 environmentalists is 
guaranteed, they will leave the Democratic Alliance [DA]. 
  [Occhetto] We must appeal to people's common sense. I am in 
favor of a strong and visible environmentalist presence, and 
this can be achieved by adhering to the sensitivity that we all 
displayed with regard to the mayors. Each constituency must be 
treated as a city that needs to elect a mayor, and we must all 
of us together find the person that will win us that seat. 
Within this framework, there is the representation of women, of 
the various parties, and so forth, which are all subordinate 
matters, however. Having said that, I assure you that our 
sensitivity to the environmental issue will be very great. 
  [Messina] What about the conditions set by the Democratic 
Alliance? 
  [Occhetto] Well, I think that it is necessary to clarify 
government objectives, in accordance with the method which I 
have suggested and which has been accepted by the alignment. 
  [Messina] What do you mean by that? 
  [Occhetto] That everyone is trying to present government 
teams. We are trying to do so too. I can assure you that when 
our lists are ready they will overshadow those of [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi and all the rest. We have a government 
program such as we have never had throughout our history. But 
we will discuss it with everyone. Ours will be a flexible 
solution: With some we could have 100 percent agreement, with 
others 95, with others 60. But we aim to establish sufficient 
agreements to be able to present a convincing government team. 
It is important that even disagreements be confined within the 
framework of the document that we all jointly signed. 
  [Messina] According to La Malfa's PRI [Italian Republican 
Party], your "joyful war machine" has broken down even before 
the start. Is this true? 
  [Occhetto] We certainly have more reasons to be cheerful 
than 
La Malfa does. Let us say that our machine is firing away 
merrily, because it embraces many personalities and has its own 
internal liveliness. It would be stupid to think that it would 
be possible to unite for the first time the various components 
of a left that for years fought among themselves, without the 
arguments that inevitably occur within a single party. This, 
regardless of whether that party is great or small -- as La 
Malfa well knows, since he is failing to unite even the small 
handful that have remained within the PRI since it fell madly in 
love with [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli. 
  [Messina] Yesterday the Democratic Alliance asked yet again 
that the alignment put forward a name for the premiership, 
hinting at its own preference for Ciampi. Will you or will you 
not be putting forward a candidate for the premiership? 
  [Occhetto] It is pointless to try constantly to put pressure 
on us. When the time comes, we will all talk about this 
together, within the progressive alignment. As for Ciampi, we 
form a positive assessment in his regard, because he has been 
both impartial and authoritative. But right now the right thing 
to do is to regard him as a valuable reserve of democracy. 
  [Messina] Will the Democratic Alliance result in a single 
parliamentary group of the progressive forces, or after the 
elections will we again have eight groups belonging to the same 
alignment? 
  [Occhetto] The important things in politics are passion and 
determination. That which is impossible to imagine in the 
abstract, suddenly comes within reach if real united progress is 
made. As long as people do not continue to act childishly by 
setting too many preconditions, and if we start moving together 
in a spirit of unity, these issues too will be broached 
responsibly. Not in the abstract, but under the real conditions 
of a very tough battle. 
  [Messina] And yet, judging from what is emerging from the 
various regional negotiations on candidates, the impression is 
that some people would prefer to lose with their own candidate 
rather than to win with someone else's candidate. Is this true? 
  [Occhetto] Where such a short-sighted and erroneous stance 
has existed we have fought it, and will continue to fight it.

<F P=106> ["g. batt" interview with Greens leader Gianni Mattioli in </F>
Rome; date not given: "This Pact Mortifies Us"--first paragraph 
is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- Children of the gentle planet, of the 
laughing sun, of the party with the doors slammed. Feeling 
mocked by [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] 
Occhetto, they have spoiled the party. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Mattioli, why this rupture? 
  [Mattioli] It goes back a long way. Twenty days ago it 
became clear that this alliance would consist of well-behaved 
forces, the archaeologists of communism, this rascal [Rete 
Secretary] Orlando, and others. On Tuesday [1 February], before 
the joint signature, [Greens coordinator] Ripa di Meana repeated 
that our joining was conditional: freezing of the 12-trillion 
lire for the high-speed train, freezing of the 16 trillion of 
Anas, Montalto di Castro, Giota Tauro [power stations], freezing 
of the arms industry involved in the bribery and corruption 
scandals. Occhetto was reassuring: First sign, and then we 
will clarify the program. No way. The program can wait , but 
in the meantime they are pinning us against the wall on the 
question of candidates. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Hence it is a problem of parliamentary 
seats? 
  [Mattioli] We discovered yesterday that the number of safe 
seats reserved for us is well below the number that we have in 
parliament right now. While we are growing.... 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Safe in what sense? Is this first majority 
vote not new territory for everybody? 
  [Mattioli] Studies and projections exist which allow us to 
forecast. I ask myself how one can ask electors to vote for 
people they do not know, for unknown party or cooperative 
movement officials, and not, instead, for the proponents of a 
civilized society. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] In other words, your quarrel with the PDS is 
that it is not giving you strong seats to guarantee the election 
of environmentalists? 
  [Mattioli] The Democratic Alliance has lots of candidates. 
For two months it has worked for an electoral coalition. It 
has been screaming so loudly that in the end it gets everything. 
Our main talking partner is the PDS, it is they who deal out 
the cards. If it wants to win, it should renew itself in those 
areas where it has electoral control: in Emilia and Tuscany. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Passing over its own candidates to allow 
yours through? 
  [Mattioli] Let it choose. If it thinks that it can capture 
voters with the old faces (while people are so hungry for 
renewal that they even clutch hold of [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi, the man who celebrated the confirmation of Craxi's 
parliamentary immunity), let it go ahead. If it wants to win, 
it also needs us. I would recommend political generosity. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] In such uncertain elections? 
  [Mattioli] I am not interested in what goes on in back 
rooms, 
I am fully aware that everyone is asking seats from the PDS. We 
do not want the moon, it is not Occhetto's job to look after us. 
It is we who are bringing votes in to 
the alliance. As for the others (Democratic Alliance [AD], 
Social Christians), I do not know. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You are against the AD's request for the 
prime minister to be designated before the vote? 
  [Mattioli] There is a time for everything. Let us first of 
all see who is backing the government. Let us win the 
elections. Then let us designate a leader. [Prime Minister] 
Ciampi again? Fine. Provided that, unlike his first 
government, he includes our demands in his program. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] And if you are ignored. 
  [Mattioli] We are not unscrupulous tightrope walkers like 
[Pact for Italy leader] Segni. We will not move to the center, 
nor will we stand in the elections on our own. We can quit 
Parliament. In fact, it is by remaining outside that we won the 
fight on the major nuclear issues.

  [Text] The Vatican is trying to understand Zagreb's role in 
the Balkan conflict. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic was 
received in the Vatican this morning by the pope. Giuseppe De 
Carli reports: 
  [De Carli] Mate Granic knows that the pope is not going to 
give him an easy time during their talks. He also knows that 
the Holy See's position is not the same as two years ago when 
the Vatican encouraged Croatian Catholic separatists by 
recognizing the new republic. At the time, it was a question of 
freeing Croatia from central Communist control in Belgrade, but 
no one expected the breakup of the multi-ethnic state to lead to 
the horrors of Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  On several occasions the Vatican has rebuked Bosnian 
Croatian 
Catholics who, together with Bosnian Serbs, are involved in 
dividing up the country. John Paul II has reiterated the ideas 
expressed in the Justice and Peace Committee's recent document: 
The international community cannot stand back and impotently 
look on as minorities are expelled or peoples exterminated. 
  According to semi-official sources, the Vatican has 
reportedly asked Granic for explanations about the direct 
involvement of Zagreb's regular army in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Granic's reply was the same as the one he had given in talks 
with members of the Italian Government. Finally, a development 
confirmed by Navarro-Valls, director of the Vatican's press 
room, has caused a sensation -- the pope wants to visit former 
Yugoslavia, Sarajevo included.

Demirel] 
  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that the heavy 
weapons of those besieging Sarajevo must be silenced with an air 
operation within the framework of the UN and NATO resolutions, 
and that effective measures must be taken to lift the siege. 
  In a message he sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija 
Izetbegovic, Demirel expressed his deep regret over the 
horrendous attack in Sarajevo. He said: This recent attack 
shows once again that the time has come and gone for the 
civilized world and for the international organizations that 
represent it to fulfill their responsibilities. I call on the 
civilized world once again to silence with an air operation -- 
within the framework of the UN and NATO resolutions -- the heavy 
weapons of those forces mercilessly besieging Sarajevo as soon 
as possible, and to take effective measures to lift this siege. 
I am conveying our demands regarding this issue with messages 
to the concerned international organizations and to the leaders 
of the leading countries of the world. 
  I extend Turkey's and my own personal condolences to the 
people of Bosnia-Herzegovina for those killed in this despicable 
attack. I affirm that, as always, Turkey is on the side of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and is ready to extend to it every kind of 
support. 
  Taking this opportunity, I extend my deepest respects.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin hopes that NATO will 
decide in favor of air raids against the Serbian emplacements in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, adding: Any other decision would only grant 
the Serbians more time to plan new attacks. 
  In a statement prior to his meeting in Ankara with (Enest 
Drakovic), Bosnian minister of education, science, and culture, 
Cetin said that representations have been made with NATO and the 
United Nations following the recent Sarajevo attack in a bid to 
put an end to this barbarism as soon as possible. Cetin said 
the following: 
  [Begin Cetin recording] Our ambassador has been instructed 
to apply to NATO, and the application has been made. Turkey was 
the first to apply to NATO to call the NATO Council to a meeting 
on the issue. Instructions were also given to apply to the UN 
Security Council on the issue of lifting the arms embargo. [end 
recording] 
  In reply to a question, Cetin said that he does not believe 
that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's approval is necessary 
concerning any decision NATO might make regarding intervention. 
  (Drakovic) said that during his contacts he observed that 
Western countries do not want to exert efforts to end this 
massacre. Pointing out that Turkey's continued support 
strengthens the Bosnians, (Drakovic) added that grief caused by 
Saturday's [5 February] attack can be seen on the faces of the 
Turkish people.

  [Excerpts] Murat Karayalcin, leader of the Social 
Democratic Populist Party, state minister, and deputy prime 
minister, addressed the people in Corum, where he presented 460 
land deeds within the framework of the redevelopment and 
renovation plan. [passage omitted] 
  On the subject of the massacre the Serbs perpetrated on 
Sarajevo yesterday, Karayalcin severely condemned the approach 
of the United States and European countries on the issue. 
Explaining that the above countries were silently watching the 
massacre of 68 people in Sarajevo, Karayalcin recalled that 
these same countries sent troops when faced with the slightest 
disagreement in the Middle East. Karayalcin said: 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] We are against Islamic 
radicalism. We refuse to recognize Islamic radicalism and 
regimes that are not secular. As Turkish republicans, we are 
against all attacks against laicism; but while we, on the one 
hand, reject Muslim initiatives that are not secular, we cannot, 
on the other hand, accept or stomach Christian radicalism. I 
would like to ask you dear citizens of Corum, if the world would 
be as silent as it is now if the inhabitants of Sarajevo were 
not Muslims or if they were Jews instead of Muslims. [end

  [Text] Culture Minister Fikri Saglar has said that besides 
an unprecedented genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina, human culture 
down through centuries is also being destroyed in an act of 
sheer cleansing. Saglar said Turkey is trying to draw the 
attention of the whole world to the savagery of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  (Enest Durakovic), the culture, education, and sports 
minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina [name and title as heard], has 
arrived in Ankara on an official visit. 
  In a statement he issued while receiving the guest minister 
at the airport, Saglar said the countries championing human 
rights and democracy have been displaying indifference in such a 
way as to tolerate massacre and have not been taking the 
necessary measures. Saglar further noted that tomorrow the two 
countries will sign their first cultural protocol as well as 
another protocol on Turkey restoring the historic Mostar bridge 
and other edifices. 
  The guest minister, in turn, asked the whole world to take 
seriously the necessary measures to stop Serbian aggression and 
cruelty. Explaining that in Bosnia-Herzegovina not only are the 
people being eradicated but also a cultural heritage was being 
wiped out, the Bosnian minister stressed that they are 
determined to defend their existence and that Turkey is greatly 
assisting them toward this goal.

  [Text] The tripartite session of the foreign ministers of 
Iran, Syria, and Turkey began work in Istanbul, Turkey, this 
morning. 
  The session will assess reginal issues particularly the 
crisis in northern Iraq and its effects on neighboring countries. 
  According to a report by a correspondent of the Central News 
Unit, Foreign Minister Velayati made a speech at the session in 
which he stressed the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.

interfere in Iraq's internal affairs. 
  Our country's foreign minister pointed out the negative 
effects of the unsettled situation in northern Iraq on the 
national security of Iraq's three neighboring states and said: 
The effects of the current situation in Iraq on the region and 
the future political situation require that interested countries 
exchange views with each other. 
  Mr. Velayati recalled the need to continue the necessary 
political support for the people of Iraq and voiced hope that 
Iraq will adopt the necessary policies to reduce the problems of 
the Iraqi people caused by that country's government policies 
and the economic sanctions against Baghdad.

  [Excerpts] The tripartite consultative meeting held with 
the participation of the Turkish, Syrian, and Iranian foreign 
ministers has ended in Istanbul. The meeting was held in 
camera. The foreign ministers of the three countries held a 
joint news conference at the end of the meeting. A joint 
communique on the tripartite consultative meeting has been 
issued. 
  In a statement at the news conference, Cetin said that the 
tripartite meeting in no way aims to interfere in the domestic 
affairs of any country, adding that it aims to contribute to 
regional peace and security. He noted that regional 
developments and especially developments in Iraq were reviewed 
at the meeting and views were exchanged on issues that might 
threaten regional peace and stability. Cetin said that he 
shares similar views with the Syrian and Iranian foreign 
ministers on the issue of Iraq's territorial integrity, adding 
that developments contrary to this principle will bring new 
problems to the region as well as the world. Pointing out that 
the stand adopted by the three countries against terrorism was 
confirmed at the meeting, Cetin recalled that an agreement has 
been reached especially with Syria at the highest level and 
continued: 
  [Begin Cetin recording] We believe that developing our 
relations in all fields with Syria will not only be in the 
interests of the two countries and the two peoples, but will 
also contribute to regional peace and stability. There is close 
cooperation between the security organizations of the two 
countries. This cooperation is gradually increasing. We have 
agreed that the differences of views or conflicting information 
that might arise from time to time will be taken up at that 
level and resolved. We have reassessed these issues at this 
meeting with Syrian Foreign Affairs Minister Faruq al-Shar'. 
We also share the view that the terror issue should definitely 
be solved and that our cooperation should continue and be 
increased in the knowledge that Turkey, Syria, Iran, and other 
regional countries have, at times, suffered as a result of 
terror. [end recording] 
  Cetin concluded by saying that the three foreign ministers 
will more closely follow the regional developments through 
immediate and direct contacts and consultations. [passage 
omitted] 
  Also addressing the news conference, Iranian Foreign Affairs 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati expressed the view that the meeting 
would yield concrete and positive results. He noted that they 
strongly support Iraq's territorial integrity and sovereignty. 
[passage omitted] 
  Velayati and al-Shar' later left Turkey. They were seen off 
by Cetin at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport.

  [Text] Istanbul -- The tripartite meeting of the foreign 
ministers of Syria, Iran, and Turkey ended in Istanbul 
yesterday. Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' responded to 
reporters' questions at a joint news conference held at the end 
of this meeting. 
  Asked for his assessment of the results of the tripartite 
meeting and whether the three countries share common stands, 
al-Shar' said: The Kurdish leaders, through our contacts with 
them, have asserted that they do not seek to divide Iraq, but 
they do want their situation to be taken into consideration. 
They want a united, democratic Iraq in which the Iraqi people 
decide Iraq's future. In fact, this is also Syria's position. 
The foreign minister said that the Iraqi regime should comply 
with the UN Security Council resolutions and cooperate with the 
United Nations. 
  Answering a question on Syria's stand regarding the acts of 
terrorism against Turkey and on the difference between such acts 
and Palestinian resistance of Israeli occupation, al-Shar' said: 
Syria does not support any kind of terrorism. Turkish 
officials know full well that Syria does not render any support 
to the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] and that Syria is very 
concerned about the unity, safety, and security of friendly 
Turkey. Al-Shar' added: Since we are talking about our concern 
for Iraq's security and territorial integrity, it is obvious 
that we stand against any element that threatens the security 
and territorial integrity of any of our three countries. He 
said: There are many allegations that Syria supports terrorism, 
whether with regard to the PKK or other terrorist acts. I can 
explain why such accusations are leveled against Syria. Such 
accusations are leveled against Syria because it differentiates 
between the terrorist act, which it considers a crime against 
law and justice and which must be denounced, and the struggle of 
people under the yoke of foreign occupation. In light of this, 
the intifadah in the occupied Arab territory cannot be 
considered terrorism. Also, Lebanese resistance in southern 
Lebanon against the Israeli military occupation cannot be 
considered terrorism. Such a Syrian stand is in harmony with the 
international law and the UN Charter and resolutions. 
Regrettably, some newspapers do not differentiate between these 
two things. They mislead and distort public opinion either 
intentionally or unintentionally. It is time to stop such 
deceptive media campaigns in Turkey in particular and in the 
West in general. 
  Asked whether Syria is concerned about the amount of water 
Turkey allows to flow into Syria, Faruq al-Shar' said: Yes, we 
are concerned about this issue, because it is a vital issue. 
What really concerns us is not the quantity of water flowing 
into Syria and Iraq, but the failure to reach a firm agreement 
on water-sharing between Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. Al-Shar' 
added: It is true that the Turkish Government abides by a 
protocol that was signed in 1987. An agreement was reached 
during Demirel's visit to Damascus at the beginning of last 
year, to the effect that the foreign ministers of both countries 
will reach a final agreement on water-sharing before the end of 
1993. This, however, did not happen. 
  Al-Shar' asserted that the sharing of international river 
waters is very important to any country facing such a problem. 
What Syria wants is a very legitimate demand which is in 
harmony with international laws and norms. Furthermore, this 
helps achieve stability and cooperation in the region. 
Meanwhile, the failure to reach an agreement will remain a 
cause of continuous tension. He said that Syria does not demand 
private privileges, but demands what is granted by international 
law and norms regarding the distribution of water among Turkey, 
Syria, and Iraq. Al-Shar' noted that he held talks on this 
issue with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Turkish 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and described these talks as 
serious. He added that this issue will be followed up so as to 
reach an agreement on water sharing in accordance with the 
international law and norms. 
  Answering another question on Syria's differentiation 
between 
resistance against occupation and terrorism, al-Shar' said: 
There is a difference between what is taking place in Palestine 
and southern Turkey. He added: Turkey is an independent 
sovereign state. We are committed to Turkey's unity, 
independence, and security. We do not support any action that 
would undermine Turkey's future and territorial integrity. The 
Turkish people are the ones who decide their country's future. 
  Al-Shar' added: The Palestine question is completely 
different. The Palestinian people were not only exposed to 
coercion at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces, but 
their lands and rights were also usurped. Furthermore, settlers 
came from outside the region to replace them. Therefore, there 
is a big difference between the two issues. The United Nations 
is fully aware of this and it issued resolutions demanding 
Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Arab territory. These 
resolutions constitute the basis of the ongoing peace talks in 
Washington, which we hope will achieve the expected objectives.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the foreign ministers of </F>
Syria, Turkey, and Iran following a meeting held in Istanbul on 
5 February] 
  [Text] The foreign ministers of the Republic of Turkey, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Syrian Arab Republic held 
their fifth tripartite consultation meeting in Istanbul on 5 
February 1994 to follow up on their Tehran meeting of 7 June 
1993, which was held in a cordial and constructive spirit and 
yielded positive results. 
  The ministers reiterated their governments' commitment to 
regional peace and stability. From this perspective, they 
examined regional developments, highlighting the overall 
situation in Iraq, and laying special emphasis on the situation 
in northern and southern Iraq. 
  The ministers also underscored the extreme importance of 
safeguarding Iraq's unity and territorial integrity, noting that 
this is important for peace and stability in the region. They 
underlined the importance their governments have attached to 
this issue, something that was reflected in the resolutions 
passed by the UN Security Council in the aftermath of the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait. 
  The ministers stressed the need for Iraq to commit itself to 
the framework set by the relevant UN resolutions so that it may 
rejoin the international community. They also urged Iraq to 
make additional efforts toward that end by extending full 
cooperation to the United Nations. 
  The ministers examined the situation in northern Iraq, and 
urged the Iraqi Government to remove all restrictions against 
Iraqis there. They expressed their strong convictions that the 
ways and means of normalizing the situation in northern Iraq 
must be explored in Iraq. This should be done, the ministers 
maintained, through dialogue and through creating a climate of 
peace and security for the Iraqis living there. 
  The ministers renewed their determination to resist all 
attempts to disintegrate Iraq under any pretext. They expressed 
their strong belief that the future of Iraq must be determined 
by the free will of the entire Iraqi people on the basis of 
equality, democracy, and good neighborly ties. 
  Within this context, the statements and activities promoting 
partition by certain groups in some Western states are 
unacceptable, and must be halted. 
  The ministers renewed their condemnation of the terrorism 
targeting their countries, and expressed determination to take 
all possible measures to achieve peace, stability, and 
tranquility in the region. 
  The ministers agreed to continue their consultations to 
safeguard the region's security and stability on the basis of 
the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, such as according 
due respect to the territorial integrity of states, 
nonintervention in the domestic affairs of states, and peaceful 
resolution of conflicts. 
  The ministers decided to hold their next meeting in Damascus 
in July 1994. A committee of senior officials will meet one 
month before the convocation of the foreign ministers' meeting 
to prepare for this meeting.

<F P=106> [Interview with Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by </F>
AL-'ARABI correspondent Ghunaym 'Abduh; place and date not given] 
  [Text] ['Abduh] Your Excellency, you have emphasized that 
the fast-breaking developments in the Middle East dictate that 
Turkey play an active role in the region. In your view, what 
are the dimensions of this role? 
  [Cetin] No doubt the agreement between Israel and the 
Palestinians ushers in a new era in the Middle East. We are 
actively participating on all tracks of the multilateral 
negotiations. We are also contributing to the international 
efforts to back the peace process. We have already declared 
that we are ready to offer effective aid in every technical and 
financial area. At the Washington conference, we pledged to 
offer $2 million in the form of a donation and $50 million in 
aid. In this context we want to exchange views with Egypt, 
Israel, Tunisia, and the Palestinian leaders in east Jerusalem. 
  ['Abduh] Despite Turkey's support for the 
Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles, several studies have noted that 
Turkey might try to obstruct this agreement should its role be 
marginalized. 
  [Cetin] We constantly seek to promote cooperation and 
dialogue with the region's countries. Turkey will place no 
obstacles in the way of peace. 
  ['Abduh] Allow me to move to the issue of water, which 
experts expect to be the source of wars in the next century. 
You accused Syria of using terrorism to serve its water 
interests. Does this mean that Turkey intends to use water as a 
weapon to confront its neighbors? 
  [Cetin] We have repeatedly asserted through high-ranking 
officials that Turkey is committed to the 1987 agreement on 
water. Under this agreement, Syria is entitled to 500 cubic 
meters [per second] of the Euphrates River water. We do not 
intend to harm the interests of our neighbors, Syria's included. 
We admit that our relations with Syria have not reached the 
required level. One of the most important factors obstructing 
cooperation is Syria's leniency regarding terrorist activities 
on its territory that target Turkish security. Despite this, we 
will continue to do all we can to establish bilateral and 
multifaceted relations with Syria. 
  ['Abduh] The volume of losses Turkey has sustained through 
the sanctions against Iraq since it invaded Kuwait total $20 
million [as published]. Do you support lifting the sanctions on 
Iraq or are you content to demand compensation? 
  [Cetin] Our policy pursued both tracks. We are consulting 
with our allies to compensate us for our sacrifices. Three 
years of sanctions on Iraq have caused Turkey $20 billion in 
economic losses. And we lose $500,000 daily through the closure 
of the Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline. The oil embargo has caused 
us economic, social, and political harm, although we know that 
the imposed sanctions are certainly not intended to harm Turkey. 
We have constantly encouraged Iraq to comply fully with the UN 
Security Council resolutions. We hope that Iraq's latest 
acceptance of Security Council Resolution 715 will create a more 
suitable and positive atmosphere toward lifting or alleviating 
the sanctions on Iraq. 
  ['Abduh] What is the Turkish idea for achieving security in 
the Gulf? 
  [Cetin] Turkey attaches great importance to peace, security, 
and stability in the Gulf. We believe that maintaining peace in 
the Gulf is primarily the responsibility of the region's 
countries, which should seek to solve their problems through 
bilateral and collective dialogue. Also, increasing the volume 
of trade and economic exchange and joint projects may contribute 
to achieving peace and security. Turkey put forward its views 
within the framework of the Islamic Conference Organization 
activities and, as it has done before, Turkey will contribute 
effectively to Gulf security. 
  ['Abduh] Do you consider the growth of Iran's military 
power a threat? 
  [Cetin] Despite various reports on rebuilding the Iranian 
Armed Forces, we understand Iranian officials' assertions to 
"us" that they seek to make up for their heavy military losses 
in the war with Iraq. We believe that if any country in the 
region possesses arms for aggressive purposes and as an attempt 
to change the balance of power, this will not help to maintain 
durable peace and stability. 
  ['Abduh] There was initially a competition between Turkey 
and 
Iran over the new Islamic republics in Central Asia. But Turkey 
has recently been trying to include Iran in arrangements 
concerning that region. 
  [Cetin] Turkey attaches great importance to its relations 
with the new Islamic republics in Central Asia; we are bound by 
deep historical and cultural ties. We compete with no country 
for those republics and Turkey is doing its best to help them 
boost their independence and overcome their economic 
difficulties. Iran, as a neighboring country, also seems eager 
to promote its relations with those countries, especially 
opening new markets for them through Iranian territory. And the 
Central Asian republics have recently joined the Economic 
Cooperation Organization, of which Turkey is a founding member, 
together with Iran and Pakistan. 
  It is important for us that relations with those republics 
are based on international principles, especially 
noninterference in internal affairs. 
  ['Abduh] UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali has 
stressed that no negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem can 
be achieved without the leaders of the two communities paying 
some political price. What price does the Turkish Government 
believe the Greek Cypriots must pay? 
  [Cetin] The Cyprus problem is a complicated political issue. 
We are asking for a just and realistic solution based on mutual 
recognition and free negotiations. When the Greek Cypriots 
become ready to demonstrate the required political will to share 
power with the Turkish Cypriots, a solution will undoubtedly be 
possible. 
  ['Abduh] Butrus-Ghali has asked Turkey to reduce its forces 
in Cyprus to their 1982 level as a first phase in a full 
withdrawal. What is your position? 
  [Cetin] Turkey has repeatedly said that its forces will 
implement a one-time withdrawal after a just settlement has been 
achieved. We still adhere to this position. 
  ['Abduh] Turkey does not want to know the internal reasons 
or 
motives of the Kurdish problem. It does not want to listen 
directly to the Kurds or their proposals for a solution. 
Indeed, Turkey is searching for a solution to the problem 
beyond its border, making threats against neighboring countries. 
What is your comment? 
  [Cetin] The Turkish Government realizes that the essence of 
the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] terrorism stems from 
Turkish territory. But it is fueled by the party's branches 
outside Turkey, which extend into neighboring countries and some 
European capitals, where the party has representation offices. 
We are always eager to discuss this subject during all our 
meetings with our neighbors and European allies. 
  I am glad we convinced the allies. This was manifest in 
Germany's recent strict measures against the party. PKK offices 
in Germany and other parts of Europe have been closed. An 
inclination to cooperate has also emerged from the governments 
of Syria and Iran and from Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq. 
  In its handling of PKK terrorism, Turkish policy is based on 
suppressing it and rapidly implementing immense investment 
projects in southeast Turkey to improve public services and 
standards of living, hoping to achieve tangible results soon. 
The parliament-- approximately 25 percent of the members of 
which are Kurds--the press and the media and the various 
academies are involved in a broad dialogue on the proposed or 
possible solutions to the problem of backwardness in southeast 
Turkey to end PKK terrorism. 
  ['Abduh] Some human rights organizations have accused the 
Turkish security forces of burning down and destroying (1,000) 
villages in southeast Turkey and of carrying out arrests and 
torture. What about the Kurdish man's rights? 
  [Cetin] The allegation that (1,000) villages in southeast 
Turkey were burned down and destroyed is a deliberate distortion 
of the facts. The truth is that the security forces asked 
inhabitants living on the outskirts of villages to move further 
out or to towns where the people can be protected against PKK 
terrorism. 
  Turkey has made substantial progress in human rights in the 
past few years. There might be individual violations once in a 
while but the awareness of human rights is growing daily among 
the citizens in our country. No excesses are being tolerated. 
  Another important point is that the UN machinery has not 
accused Turkey of violating human rights. Turkey's human rights 
record must be assessed in light of the forceful terrorist 
campaign the PKK troops are launching. Egypt can easily 
understand this. 
  ['Abduh] The deputy chairman of the Islamic Welfare Party in 
Turkey has stated that the West is using its protection of Iraqi 
Kurds to back the PKK and fight the Islamic tide in Turkey. As 
an example, he mentioned the U.S. ambassador's visit to 
southeast Turkey in an effort to surround the Islamists in 
Turkey. 
  [Cetin] The American ambassador's visit aimed to achieve 
nothing of this sort. Since the beginning, U.S. policy has 
firmly opposed terrorism and the PKK. This was announced on 
various levels. The visit had nothing to do with an alleged 
fight against the Islamic tide. 
  ['Abduh] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has recently affirmed 
that Turkey will not relinquish secularism in any circumstances. 
How are you going to deal with the growing fundamentalist tide 
in Turkey? 
  [Cetin] Secularism is one of the basic principles on which 
Turkish democracy is built. It provides freedom of expression. 
Expressing religious views has always been one of the features 
of political life in Turkey. This expression has always 
occupied a complementary position. Fundamentalism is excessive 
religious fanaticism that seeks to overthrow secularist 
democracy. 
  Secularism does not deny Islam. And it is not a call to 
isolate Islam from national life. Conservative religious trends 
are not new to Turkey. Since the seventies, religion has been 
part of political life, although not a major part.

  [Text] Ankara--Officials in the Turkish capital suspect the 
outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) may be moving its forces 
from northern Iraq to Iran or even Armenia following last 
Friday's [28 January] air strikes on Zhalah. 
  The development is expected to put more pressure on Ankara's 
ties with Tehran aimed at curbing regional terrorism. Official 
sources said they expect now more than ever for Iran to abide 
with its guarantees to Turkey and fulfill its obligations 
underlined in mutual security protocols. 
  There are already reports that some of the wounded PKK 
militants have been transferred to the so-called Halil Cavus 
camp, some 70 kilometers from Zhalah, in Iranian territory. 
Officials said on Monday that although an exact damage report 
was still not available with regard to last Friday's air strikes 
on the PKK camp in Zhalah, some 110 kilometers from the Turkish 
border, the separatists could not use the camp again. The camp, 
consisting of underground tunnels, caves, at least 21 buildings 
and dozens of tents, has reportedly been totally destroyed. 
Military sources say one of the main priorities of the 
operation had been to make the area unusable for the terrorists. 
  According to Chief of Staff spokesman Col. Cogu Silahcioglu, 
constant monitoring of PKK wireless communications over the past 
three days has shown that none of the separatist units in the 
region can raise anyone at Zhalah. 
  Meanwhile, regional sources have said that (Ferhat) Osman 
Ocalan, brother of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, is currently in 
Iran and suspected of being in Orumiyeh. 
  Official sources say that since they are not able to use 
Zhalah again, the remainder of the PKK forces in the region 
would seek a new camp. About 1,600 terrorists were thought to 
be in Zhalah at the time of the attack. 
  One view is that the PKK may return to its camps in Iraq, 
near Ochnevieh, and use these for both training and cross-border 
attacks into Turkey. This depends mainly on Iran's sincerity in 
its pledge to Ankara to hit back at terrorism. If not, the PKK 
can continue to shelter in Iranian territory in which it has had 
a constant force of 800-1,000 fighters up till now. According 
to another view, some of the leading militants may be 
transferred to Armenia where the PKK has official protection and 
aims at opening a major training camp. 
  Osman Ocalan has had constant relations with Iranian 
officials in the past three years and has recently held a 
high-level meeting with representatives of the Iranian 
Information Ministry. 
<H5>  Retaliation </H5>
  Meanwhile, Turkish security officials have upgraded 
precautionary measures against a possible terrorist attack in 
retaliation for Friday's operation. 
  Security sources, over the weekend, took measures at all 
entrances to the Turkish capital and police have been warned in 
major metro- [sentence as published].

<F P=106> [Rauf Gerz report: "Secret Flights to Yerevan"] </F>
  [Text] Istanbul--Turkish Air Force officials have 
discovered that the Ukraine Airlines Company diverts its 
passenger aircraft, which fly between Odessa and Aleppo, to land 
in Yerevan. The four flights weekly between Odessa and Aleppo 
"during the off season" drew the attention of the officials. 
They had the Tupolev-154 aircraft, which are capable of 
accommodating 164 passengers, followed on radar and established 
that they landed in Yerevan after crossing through Turkey's 
airspace. Meanwhile, the officials also established that the 
passenger aircraft from Russia's Aeroflot company, take off from 
Aleppo, fly to Sochi, and later proceed to Yerevan. This 
information indicates that the arms embargo on Yerevan has been 
breached. Considering the few passengers who fly from Aleppo, 
the officials have decided that the aircraft transport arms and 
terrorists to Yerevan. 
  The information gathered by the officials through intensive 
intelligence work has confirmed the concern that foreign 
aircraft are transporting arms and Workers Party of Kurdistan 
[PKK] terrorists from Syria to Yerevan. The Turkish Foreign 
Ministry has cautioned Ukraine and Russia on the matter, noting 
that Turkish Air Force units will intervene and their aircraft 
will not be allowed into Turkey's airspace if the flights are 
maintained. 
  The military sources have said the PKK militants who are 
transported to Yerevan infiltrate into Turkey to carry out 
terrorist activities. Later, some of them return to Armenia and 
the others move from the eastern part of Turkey to the 
southeastern region to cross into Syria, carrying out terrorist 
activities as they go. The flights from Aleppo are also a means 
of supplying arms to the PKK. 
  All this was discovered early in 1994. The frequent flights 
of the two companies from Aleppo to Odessa and Sochi drew 
official attention. The Turkish Air Force units followed them, 
and the foreign planes were observed on radar to land in 
Yerevan. The officials believe that many flights have taken 
place between Syria and Armenia through Turkish airspace, and 
large quantities of arms and ammunition have been transported to 
the Armenians and the PKK. 
  Meanwhile, the General Staff has ordered the Turkish Air 
Force to continue to follow closely all the aircraft that take 
off from Aleppo to fly to the CIS countries. The military 
sources have ascertained that the Ukraine Airlines Company and 
Aeroflot, which are in a difficult financial situation, demand a 
very high price for their charter flights. 
  The officials are trying to establish who provides the arms 
that are transported from Syria to Armenia and the number of 
secret flights that have landed in Yerevan so far.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, Feb 6 (AFP) -- The European 
Community, goaded by the weekend shelling massacre in Sarajevo, 
is under increasing pressure to back military intervention in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, several EC countries have indicated. 
  The strongest European reaction to Saturday's shelling of a 
market in the Bosnian capital which killed at least 66 people 
came from Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. 
  Speaking ahead of a meeting of EC foreign ministers here on 
Monday [7 February], he called on the United Nations to 
authorise air strikes on Serb batteries around Sarajevo. 
  In Germany, the government said "the use of targeted 
military 
action, as NATO proposed to the UN on August 9, should no longer 
be ruled out." 
  At the time, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which 
includes most EC countries, proposed mounting air strikes to 
prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, which is surrounded by 
Bosnian Serb forces. But although the organisation has often 
repeated its readiness to use air strikes, if it got a UN 
go-ahead, the threat has not been implemented. 
  The French Government called for a clear plan of action from 
the UN and NATO to end the siege of Sarajevo, including the 
possible use of air strikes. 
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, for his part, 
condemned 
the attack as a "barbaric act of violence" Sunday adding that 
the Bosnian people's "misery and suffering must end." 
  Military intervention has been resisted by Russia and 
Greece, 
which have generally pro-Serb sympathies. 
  Opposition to air strikes has also come from countries with 
large military contingents backing UN aid missions in Bosnia, 
particularly Britain, which fear reprisal attacks on their 
forces. 
  Diplomats predicted that the mounting bloodshed in the 
Bosnian civil war, and the EC's impotence to stop it, would fuel 
a drive at Monday's meeting not only for military intervention 
but also for a rethink of EC policy. [passage omitted] 
  Claes said ahead of Saturday's massacre that a greater U.S. 
role was necessary in Bosnia, particularly to reassure the 
Moslems that a peace agreement would stick, and to press the 
Serbs and Croats into accepting it. 
  Another EC official said: "It seems clear the Moslems are 
raising the stakes and that all parties (Serbs, Croats and 
Moslems) seem completely confident they have more to gain from 
fighting than from negotiating." 
  A spokesman for the EC's Greek presidency said on Friday 
that 
the Community was sticking to its peace proposals for the 
three-way division of Bosnia into Serb, Croat and Moslem 
republics. "We believe it is a good plan which can still work," 
he said, adding that Monday's meeting would include a "general 
review, an open debate" on Bosnia. [passage omitted] 
  Some EC countries, notably France, have criticised U.S. 
reluctance to get involved in the Bosnian civil war since the 
Europeans rejected U.S. proposals last year to arm the Bosnian 
Moslems and launch air strikes against the Serbs. 
  But the chief of the French Armed Forces Admiral Jacques 
Lanxade on Sunday warned against "simplistic ideas like a 
military intervention against the Serbs or a lifting of the arms 
embargo."

  [Text] Should the European Union [EU] agree on sanctions 
against Croatia next Monday, Vienna will probably go along with 
this decision, Foreign Minister Alois Mock indicated in Brussels 
on Thursday [3 February]. 
  The foreign minister was inquiring about the chances of 
completing the entry talks by the end of February. The planned 
conclusion of the negotiations with the four membership 
candidates will be the subject of a meeting between the 12 EU 
and the four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] foreign 
ministers, who will meet in Brussels on Monday. In view of the 
increasingly overt Croatian attacks against Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, they will also discuss imposing sanctions 
against Zagreb, comparable with those against Serbia.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Nathalie Mattheiem: "Washington Makes a </F>
Gesture Toward Hanoi"] 
  [Excerpts] Wasington -- In lifting the U.S. trade embargo 
on Vietnam -- President Clinton has finally overcome the 
political, historical, and personal obstacles to the measure 
which business circles wanted. This was a decision made easier 
by the Senate's adoption, during a general foreign policy 
debate, of a recommendation that this should be done, supported 
in particular by veterans and former prisoners of war from both 
parties. 
  The President needed all the help he could get on this 
sensitive subject: The organizations representing families of 
soldiers reported "missing in action" (MIA's) during the Vietnam 
War reject this additional step toward the normalization of 
relations between the former enemies, with, in particular, the 
opening of American Government offices in Hanoi. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is therefore easy to understand that the President should 
start by expressing his conviction that his decision would make 
a full search possible: The progress in cooperation with 
Vietnam is tangible, he said, and the United States itself is 
devoting more effort to this question than at any other time in 
its history, the President said, citing the practical results 
obtained since he came to office. His decision was the result 
of careful consideration, he added, and was supported by all the 
experts inside and outside the White House: Vietnam's 
cooperation would be more effectively guaranteed by a policy of 
"involvement," but without going as far as "normalization," than 
by any continuation of the country's isolation. 
  Is this really the end of the famous "Vietnam syndrome?" 
Many 
people in the White House, the Capitol, and the country, hope 
so. It is not completely certain, as demonstrated by the 
hostility which the President encountered last year when he paid 
his respects at the "wall," the memorial to the people who died 
in that war. As the President himself admitted, a whole 
generation is obsessed by the desire to know what happened to 
the soldiers who never came back, after the last repatriation of 
prisoners under the Nixon administration. However, over the 
years, this feeling has gradually given way to the desire to "be 
reconciled" with the past. [passage omitted] 
  For American firms, the time to rush into this market, now 
described as "enormous," has certainly arrived: The big 
business lobby and oil companies at Westinghouse had been 
waiting impatiently for months. Forced to go through 
intermediaries, they saw their competitors, especially European 
competitors, establishing themselves and cleaning out this new 
country in which, they note in passing, 60 percent of the 
population was not born when the conflict was raging. The 
Democrats' new policy, aside from a less "automatic" link 
between humanitarian and commercial questions than campaign 
speeches suggested, is focused on economic recovery, and hence 
encouraging exports. Although President Clinton's personal 
position was bound to be extremely uncomfortable in this 
specific case, his decision is consistent with his priorities: 
To unite the country, and in particular to heal once and for 
all the emotional wounds of the Vietnam War, and to ensure 
economic recovery.

strongly criticized Croatia because of reports on the 
involvement of regular Croatian soldiers in the war in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. It is "a scandal" that the Croatian 
Government is not keeping its promise, Kohl said today in an 
interview with the private television channel SAT.1. This must 
be met with "the strongest rejection." At the same time, 
however, the chancellor defended the fact that the German 
Government had pressed for the speedy recognition of Croatia and 
Slovenia. Developments in Slovenia are a "success," he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pope on War As a Political Choice"] </F>
  [Text] Vatican City, 7 Feb (ANSA) -- The "indescribable 
horrors perpetrated every day against innocent peoples" in 
ex-Yugoslavia were spoken of today by Pope John Paul II as the 
result of old ethnic hatred, "the hatred of one group for 
another" combined with a "series of concrete and determined 
policies." 
  Addressing a group of 150 people attending a seminar 
sponsored by the NATO Defense College in Rome, the pope pointed 
out, "Someone, some time, made some decisions which brought 
terrible consequences of death, offense, destruction and 
mourning." 
  Speaking in English, the pontiff affirmed that the "shocking 
and bloody conflict which is shaking Europe" is making the 
continent less certain of itself and warned that "Europe must 
remember that its destiny cannot depend only on strategic or 
economic interests. It must regain its spirit for the renewal of 
its civil, moral and spiritual life," he added. 
  The ongoing appeals launched by the Holy See and other 
religious leaders and "men of good will," he continued, "are 
directed to the conscience of those who can do something to 
change the course of things. To the present, hope has not been 
compensated," he said before turning to prayer for "you and all 
those who are in the service of the cause of peace." 
  Concluding his remarks, John Paul said, "Peace is a word and 
a desire closed in the hearts of everyone, an essential asset on 
which depends the well-being of the individual and the progress 
of society and civilization."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU Foreign Ministers Meet"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, 7 Feb (ANSA) -- The Bosnian crisis topped 
the agenda as European Union foreign ministers gathered for two 
days of talks here this morning, amid lingering worldwide shock 
at the Saturday [5 February] mortar attack that killed 68 and 
wounded 200 in a Sarajevo market, and progress in the push to 
have Sarajevo de-militarised. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd reiterated London's 
caution over NATO air strikes against Serb positions around the 
Bosnian capital, stressing that the indications of UN commanders 
on the ground should be the prime consideration. Hurd said that 
a NATO meeting to answer UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's air strike preparation call would take place on 
Wednesday [9 February] -- while German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel told German radio that the meeting could come "as early 
as tomorrow. Everyone agrees that the order to attack must come 
from Butrus-Ghali," Kinkel said, adding that even with air 
strikes "the situation cannot be improved overnight," and 
recalling that U.S. President Bill Clinton has "given priority 
to a peaceful response." 
  A spokesperson for Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
said he had been in close telephone contact with U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher, adding that air strikes against any 
of the three sides in Bosnia "would only make sense if there is 
a good chance of them forcing the sides to compromise." In the 
present situation, their likelier effect would be the opposite, 
she said. 
  International mediators Lord David Owen (for the EU) and 
Thorvald Stoltenberg (for the UN) announced in Belgrade that 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had agreed to talks, 
beginning in Geneva Thursday (when the broader peace talks 
resume), on the demilitarisation of Sarajevo to place the city 
under UN control. 
  Bosnian (Muslim) state radio accused the Bosnian Croats of 
"taking advantage of the attention focused on Sarajevo" to step 
up bombing of the Herzegovina capital Mostar, where it reported 
80 mortars falling during the night (one dead, several wounded) 
and heavy Croat use of surface-to-surface missiles this morning. 
  Fighting was also reported in central Bosnia (where a 
general 
alert was sounded at Zenica) and in the north, around the Muslim 
enclave at Maglaj, where Serb and Croat forces are reported to 
be operating jointly against the Muslims. After a night of calm, 
the Serb artillery barrage of Sarajevo resumed this morning, 
hitting the suburbs of Zuc and Dobrinja. 
  NATO diplomatic sources said later that for the moment no 
meeting of NATO foreign ministers is planned to discuss a 
response to Saturday's atrocity. There will probably be 
meetings of NATO's 16 ambassadors ahead of their scheduled 
meeting on Wednesday in the Atlantic Council, they said, while 
not ruling out a foreign ministers' meeting being decided at the 
EU meeting today and tomorrow. 
  "Not only the honour, but the very future of the European 
Union is at stake in ex-Yugoslavia," French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe told his confreres at the start of today's session, 
calling for a "clear stance" in favour of ordering Serb 
artillery to stay out of a 30-km radius around Sarajevo on pain 
of being hit. "France is ready to take on this responsibility," 
he said. 
  But Greece, the one Balkan country in the European Union and 
the holder of the EU's rotating presidency, expressed opposition 
to air strikes or other military options for fear of igniting a 
full-scale Balkans war. 
  Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta expressed 
support for the French idea of creating a security perimeter 
around Sarajevo, saying that "we have to use all instruments, 
political and military, to ease the situation in Bosnia before 
the Spring offensives." 
  (In London, British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said 
that the use of military force would "endanger" aid supplies. 
He called on the international community to show "strong 
political determination.") 
  (In Ankara, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel appealed to 
the international community to decide military action against 
the Serbian "aggressors" and lift the arms embargo preventing 
the Bosnian Muslims from properly defending themselves.)

<F P=106> [John Carvel report: "Brussels Puts PM's Opt-Out To The </F>
Test"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The European Commission yesterday 
exposed an embarrassing loophole in John Major's claim that the 
UK opt-out from the Maastricht social protocol would "protect" 
British employers from future European Union [EU] directives to 
strengthen workers' rights. 
  Representatives of the 17 commissioners approved proposals 
for establishing works councils in large multinational companies 
operating in more than one EU country. The aim is to ensure 
employees are consulted about key corporate decisions which 
could affect their livelihoods. 
  The plan, which is now certain to be agreed by the 
Commission 
next week, will be this year's main item of social legislation 
in Brussels and it is likely to become the centre of a battle 
between the EU employers and trade unions. 
  Its significance for Britain and the Euro-sceptics on the 
Conservative backbenches is that the Commission's lawyers 
believe UK-based multinationals cannot escape obligations to 
comply with a directive agreed by the other 11 member states 
without the participation of UK ministers. 
  A big company with a headquarters in London and substantial 
subsidiaries in other member states would have to set up 
consultation machinery for its employees in mainland Europe. 
Although the management of the UK operation could legally refuse 
to take part, Commission officials think it would be divisive 
and impractical if British workers were denied access being 
offered to employees elsewhere in the EU. 
  Multinationals based in one of the other 11 member states 
would be "obliged to invite the management and employees of 
their UK branches or subsidiaries to participate." 
  The proposal is the first test of how the Maastricht social 
protocol will work. It is being brought forward initially as an 
attempt to achieve a consensus between the EU employers and 
unions which might avoid the need for binding legislation. 
  In practice, however, such agreement is unlikely and the 
plan 
is likely to be turned into a binding directive. The German 
government, which takes over the EU presidency in July, wants it 
passed into law by October when its general election will be 
held. 
  Chancellor Kohl thinks this item of progressive EU 
legislation would be popular with the voters and potential 
future coalition partners. 
  Emilio Cabaglio, secretary general of the European TUC 
[Trade 
Union Council], said yesterday that the Commission plan was a 
"complete U-turn" on the previous works council proposal which 
was approved by 11 member states last year under the 
pre-Maastricht procedure, but fell because of British 
opposition. It was "suprising and totally unacceptable," he 
said. 
  Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of Unice, the 
European 
employers' confederation, said his members would refuse to take 
part in negotiations which the Commission was stacking 
dangerously in favour of the unions. 
  Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, appeared to 
be relaxed last night about being under fire from both 
directions. He believes the new version of the proposal will 
help employees of multinationals to negotiate consultation 
machinery with their managements which best suits the 
circumstances of their companies. 
  The union side would be strengthened because the employers 
would know the Commission's plan could be imposed if no 
agreement was reached. But the unions would still have an 
incentive to compromise because these default powers would only 
apply from 1999. 
  "The paradox of this directive is that it will succeed best 
if it is never applied, but if it did not exist nothing would 
happen," Mr Flynn said. 
  The proposals apply to firms with more than 1,000 employees 
anywhere in the EU. British workers will count towards the 
total. But the machinery for establishing consultation rights 
cannot be triggered without the support of 500 workers from the 
other 11 member states. 
  Mr Flynn has dropped the description "European works 
councils" from his text in an effort to placate Unice. 
  Under the Maastricht social protocol, British ministers can 
attend debates among the other 11 member states, but have no 
vote.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RAY: "Zambian President: Come and </F>
Invest With Us"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 3 Feb (BELGA) -- The best way to promote 
the cause of democracy in Zambia and Africa in general is to 
invest in them, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba stated on 
Thursday [3 February] in Brussels. 
  At a speech delivered to the chamber of commerce of Belgium 
and Luxembourg and the ACP states (Africa, Caribbean and the 
Pacific), he stressed that (black) Africa was changing and the 
continent's image as the "black" continent which it had until a 
few years ago no longer corresponded to the reality of the 
situation. 
  The Zambian president, who peacefully succeeded Mr. Kenneth 
Kaunda following elections in 1991, an almost unique event in 
Africa, has been on a three-day visit to Belgium since 
Wednesday, during which he is to meet European Community 
officials. 
  Mr. Chiluba, a former trade unionist, added that "new 
leaders" and "new regimes" had appeared, who were asking for 
time in order to continue with democratization. 
  "The best way of helping us in this matter is by investing 
in 
my country," he added. 
  Mr. Chiluba believes that Zambia now possesses a pluralist 
political system. "I could be beaten at the next elections," he 
stressed. 
  The Zambian president also affirmed that his government had 
been insisting on the privatization of the economy since 1991. 
"Previously" (under the regime of the single party of the left, 
editor's note) it had been 80 percent nationalized. Other 
priorities are the fight against inflation and investments in 
roads and education. 
  Mr. Chiluba was received by King Albert II on Thursday 
morning. Following a meeting with the ambassadors of the ACP 
states, he met in the afternoon with European Commission 
President Jacques Delors. 
  Friday morning, he will be meeting with Belgian Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes, and the secretary of state for cooperation 
development, Mr. Erik Derycke, over a working lunch.

<F P=106> [Patrick Wintour report: "Major `May Take Only 23 </F>
Euro-Seats'"] 
  [Text] The Conservatives are currently on course to win 
only 23 European Parliamentary seats in the June elections, less 
than a third of the seats available, according to new research 
undertaken by the Liberal Democrats. 
  The research, based on the new Euro-boundaries drawn up for 
the June elections, suggests that, on the latest polls published 
last week, Labour could take 57 seats, the Lib Dems three and 
the SNP [Scottish Nationalist Party]. 
  The result would be a humiliation for the Conservative group 
in the European Parliament, reducing Tory representation to its 
smallest since Euro-elections began. One of the many casualties 
would be their leader, Sir Christopher Prout. 
  The Lib Dems temper their analysis with a warning about the 
direction of the Green vote, which in 1989 reached nearly 15 
percent but has subsequently collapsed. 
  The Lib Dem survey suggests that Labour modesty about its 
prospects, after its successes in 1989, is misplaced. The 
Tories did badly in 1989, running a negative campaign, losing 13 
seats and ending up with only 32 to Labour's 45. Overall, 
Labour polled 40.1 percent to the Tories 34.7 percent, with the 
Lib Dems on 6.1 percent. The Greens took 14.9 percent of the 
vote. 
  This year, with the number of seats increased by six, the 
constituency boundaries have been redrawn throughout England and 
Wales, making straight comparisons with 1989 virtually 
impossible. 
  Number crunchers at the Lib Dem headquarters argue that the 
best way of predicting the outcome this time round is through 
assessing the parties' respective shares of the general election 
vote in each of the redrawn Euro constituencies. 
  The figures suggest that on the basis of the 1992 general 
election, the Tories would have won 51 Euro-seats in which 
Labour came second, and a further 15 in which the Lib Dems came 
second. Labour would have won 25 seats in England and Wales in 
addition to seven in Scotland. 
  The tables show that 12 Euro-seats which would notionally 
have been held by the Tories on this basis are vulnerable to a 
swing of less than 5 percent from Tories to Labour, a further 
nine could go on a 10 percent swing and a further four if the 
swing matches the latest MORI poll finding of a 12 percent swing 
to Labour since 1992. 
  The Lib Dems are clearly concentrating their efforts in the 
South-west and, on the basis of the 1992 elections, could take 
Somerset and North Devon on a 23 percent swing and Cornwall and 
West Plymouth on a 3.3 percent swing. Devon and East Plymouth 
falls to an 8.4 percent swing, Wight and Hampshire South to a 
9.5 percent swing. 
  Michael White adds. Conservative Euro-sceptics last night 
moved to hoist John Major by his antifederalist rhetoric when 
they urged the Prime Minister to go into the European elections 
with a cast-iron guarantee never to return to the Exchange Rate 
Mechanism or to enter a single European currency. 
  Under the banner of restoring "national self-government" 
they 
urge the abolition of "European Citizenship," a smaller Brussels 
commission -- with no powers to initiate legislation -- and 
"depoliticisation" of the Luxembourg Court. Such talk will 
infuriate Britain's European partners. 
  Reminding Mr Major that he wrote as recently as last 
September in the Economist that economic and monetary union now 
had "all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same 
potency," five young MPs in the Thatcherite No Turning Back 
group, led by lain Duncan Smith (Chingford) urge Mr Major to 
"set out an economic agenda that will be workable" instead.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with UK Northern Ireland Secretary Sir </F>
Patrick Mayhew by Philip Stephens and Michael Cassell in 
Belfast; date not given: "Long Haul Across Ulster's Quagmire"] 
  [Text] The stage this week has been held by Mr Gerry Adams. 
His visit to New York was a formidable coup for the man who has 
long cultivated an image as the respectable face of IRA 
terrorism. The often naive questions from the U.S. television 
interviewers who feted the president of Sinn Fein during his 
48-hour trip were a gift to such an accomplished propagandist. 
  So if the public reaction of the UK Government to President 
Bill Clinton's decision to grant Mr Adams a visa has been 
restrained, the private anger has been real. Efforts to end the 
conflict in Northern Ireland do not sit easily alongside 
appeasement of Irish-Americans in Boston and New York. 
  In any event Mr Adams's U.S. trip has done nothing to change 
the realities of a conflict which has claimed more than 3,000 
lives in 25 years. Even as he was appealing in New York for 
"peace," the IRA fired a 150-pound mortar bomb at British 
troops. Nobody was killed. But it will not be long before the 
bombs and bullets -- from loyalist as well as republican 
paramilitaries -- add more names to the death roll. 
  Sitting in his elegant office in Belfast's Stormont Castle, 
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was 
concerned with these realities. 
  In an hour-long interview he insisted the Anglo-Irish 
declaration signed in December by Mr John Major and Mr Albert 
Reynolds, the British and Irish prime ministers, would in the 
end provide the basis for durable peace. 
  Sir Patrick refused to speculate publicly on the odds of an 
early end to the violence, but he gave the impression of a man 
preparing for the long haul. 
  Intelligence reports on his desk almost certainly confirm 
the 
competing doves and hawks in the IRA have decided for the time 
being to put internal unity ahead of peace. 
  Sir Patrick's message was that, whatever the IRA does in the 
short term, the joint principles laid down in the declaration 
are inviolable. 
  The two governments had spelt out that Ulster could not be 
coerced into a united Ireland. Nor would Britain take on the 
role of a "persuader" in seeking to break the province's links 
with the rest of the UK. But it would not stand in the way of 
Irish unity if that was ever the democratic wish of a majority 
in the north. 
  As Sir Patrick put it: "Each government has shown that it 
understands and accepts the validity of the aspirations of each 
side in the divided community...each government has agreed that 
the future of Northern Ireland will be decided by the wishes of 
the people living in Northern Ireland. And that is terribly 
important." 
  The republican charge that Britain is an imperialist power 
was no longer sustainable. Northern Ireland is no Gaza Strip or 
Cyprus, where people are denied access to the ballot box. 
  Despite Mr Clinton's decision this week, Sir Patrick is 
convinced that agreement between London and Dublin on the 
province's future will lead to progressive international 
isolation of the IRA. 
  Meanwhile, the two governments would give impetus to efforts 
to reinstate devolved administration in Northern Ireland and to 
enhance co-operation between north and south. 
  Sir Patrick will table [present] within two weeks an outline 
plan for a new political settlement. The plan -- to be 
presented to the Ulster Unionist party, the mainly-Catholic 
Social Democratic and Labour party [SDLP] and the non-sectarian 
Alliance party -- will centre on a new devolved assembly in 
Ulster. 
  It will also include proposals for a number of cross-border 
executive boards with responsibility for such areas as tourism 
and the environment. Reverend Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic 
Unionist party [DUP] will be invited back to the table. 
  Together these proposals make up strands one and two of the 
so-called three-stranded search for a comprehensive political 
settlement. Strand three, as it is known, is concerned with 
updating the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement between the two 
governments. 
  Sir Patrick cleared up once and for all the government's 
position on Mr Adams's repeated demands for clarification, 
negotiation (call it what you will), of the Downing Street text. 
He will not get it. 
  Mr Adams wanted a place at the table before the IRA had 
stopped its killing: "It is entirely clear what he wants is a 
renegotiation of the declaration.... And we are not going to do 
it." 
  There was "a place and time for negotiation about the future 
of Northern Ireland -- its status and everything else to do with 
it. That place and time is during the talks from which nobody is 
excluded except those who say: `We wish actually to fortify our 
arguments with bombs.'" 
  Mr Adams knows it and, in Sir Patrick's judgment, is playing 
for time. 
  Nor will a temporary truce do: The government will not 
negotiate with Adams or anyone else unless and until they have 
permanently ended violence or permanently ended the 
justification for violence. "I have made that clear time and 
time again. So have the Irish. There is no daylight between us 
on this." 
  The reasoning is obvious: "If you negotiate with people who 
want a united Ireland...in those circumstances (of continuing 
violence) it would undercut fatally other nationalist 
politicians who accept the disciplines of constitutional 
politics." For other nationalist politicians you can substitute 
Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader. 
  It is Mr Adams and his allies, not the British government, 
who have it within their power to bring peace. "The right 
analogy seems to me to be this. Sinn Fein have the key. The 
key is this: their ability to give up violence...if they put it 
in the lock now and turn it, consequences follow which have been 
spelt out." But either way the declaration will remain on the 
table: "The lock is not going to be changed." 
  Nor will the two governments allow Sinn Fein to paralyse the 
search for a political settlement: "The joint declaration is not 
a substitute for the (political) talks process. It complements 
it. But it is not a substitute for it." 
  So after months of tortuous negotiations, Sir Patrick will 
table what he calls a "framework of ideas" to secure agreement 
among the province's constitutional parties on strand one and 
strand two. 
  He is under no illusions that progress will be rapid: "It's 
a 
delicate, slow, pragmatic process." A previous attempt to secure 
agreement broke down in acrimony in 1992. For the time being at 
least the discussions will continue on a bilateral basis with 
each party. 
  The moderate Ulster Unionists led by Mr James Molyneaux want 
a devolved assembly but they are not interested in enhanced 
co-operation with Dublin. The DUP, which walked out of the 
talks to protest against the joint declaration, has yet to agree 
even to join discussions. 
  Mr Molyneaux must be kept on side. Mr John Major's 
government depends upon his support. So Sir Patrick is adamant 
that there can be nothing in strand two (structures for 
cross-border co-operation) which the unionists might condemn as 
representing joint authority between London and Dublin over 
affairs in the province. 
  But the constitutional nationalists represented by Mr Hume 
are only interested in devolution if it is slotted into the 
context of much closer co-operation between North and South. 
They must be given something if they are to sign up to an 
assembly. And so on -- the complexities and complications are 
endless. 
  It will take months if not years to get within striking 
distance of an agreement. The whole process could yet founder 
on the prejudices and suspicions which scar the politics of 
Northern Ireland. Holding the present alliance with Dublin will 
not be easy if the IRA continues its campaign. 
  But in Sir Patrick's view there is no other route. For all 
his success in New York, Mr Adams, identified as a dove in the 
IRA power struggle which has followed the Downing Street 
declaration, knows it.

<F P=106> [Alex Brummer article: "Sinn Fein Sideshow Reflects </F>
Hypocrisy In The Way of Peace"] 
  [Text] The return of Gerry Adams to Ireland brings an 
abrupt end to the 48-hour sideshow in New York, which has been 
such an embarrassment for the British Government. It has been 
made painfully clear that the relationship between the 40 
million or so Irish Americans and Dublin is more durable than 
the one between the White House and Downing Street. 
  It would be a great shame if the pique of the Prime 
Minister, 
John Major, or some of the collateral fall-out from the visit of 
Mr Adams to the U.S., distracted from pursuit of the peace 
process set out on December 15. 
  There is a tendency among British and Unionist politicians 
to 
throw up their hands in horror at the idea of the Sinn Fein 
leader being given carte blanche to present himself as a person 
of peace. However, this grossly underestimates the wisdom of all 
those who watched his show in action. 
  His constant resort to attacks on the perceived colonial 
power, Britain, and events that took place more than 70 years 
ago, tends to be as unconvincing as Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's 
attempt to blame all the world's ills on American imperialism. 
It is the defence of someone who does not have the intellectual 
fire power to justify violence, even on contemporary grounds. 
  The other benefits of Mr Adams' visit, are, first, the 
acknowledgement by President Clinton that the December 15 
declaration was the best way forward. Having the world's only 
superpower behind the process can be helpful, as the 
Israeli-Palestinian deal proves. 
  Second, as high level officials in Dublin point out, it puts 
pressure on Mr Adams and the IRA to deliver on a ceasefire. 
When he arrived at Dublin airport early yesterday he described 
moves towards peace as being their "final phase," a timely break 
in his recent meanderings on the need for clarifications. 
  In fact, it is something of a distraction that Sir Patrick 
Mayhew should have chosen now, just as the impact of Mr Adams's 
visit is being absorbed in Ireland, to have changed horses by 
refettling the existing political process. His ideas, including 
a measure of power devolution to a new assembly and cross-border 
co-operation in tourism and environment, are fine, and maybe 
even sensible. 
  But the timing is appalling. It gives the appearance of a 
domestically driven, political reaction to Mr Adams's megaphone 
in New York. It does seem that Sir Patrick has again played 
what is perceived in Dublin as his weakest suit: the failure to 
consult with those directly concerned in the Nationalist and 
Loyalist communities. 
  Senior ministers in Dublin believe that the Downing Street 
declaration faces its stiffest test in the next few weeks. Once 
the European election campaign moves into high gear in the 
spring (polling is in July) politicians on both sides of the 
border -- but particularly the Unionists in the North -- will be 
so trapped by the need to show the respective power of their 
factions, that the boldness which brought James Molyneaux to 
Dublin will be snuffed out. 
  The government of the Republic has made an unusual effort 
to cultivate Unionist support for the Downing Street declaration 
with the Tanaiste [deputy prime minister] and foreign minister, 
Dick Spring, travelling to Belfast and the Shankill as part of 
the effort to demonstrate that politicians in the South do not 
have horns. Indeed, there is a view here that Sir Patrick 
should have spent as much time closely cultivating Unionist and 
Nationalist factions, instead of pronouncing from Stormont in 
the manner of the old-style British ruler. 
  What essentially has been going on since December 15 is 
waiting on the IRA. It was clear from day one that, despite the 
prelude of the Hume-Adams talks (and the accord which may never 
even have been put down on paper) and the disclosure of the 
unofficial contacts between Britain and Sinn Fein, that the IRA 
was nowhere near ready to accept the concept of a ceasefire let 
alone laying down its arms. 
  What has followed has been a kind of double bluff. Mr Adams 
has waffled on ad nauseam about the need for clarification of 
the Downing Street declaration. Albert Reynolds and the Dublin 
government and Downing Street (to a lesser extent) have obliged 
by delivering a series of speeches and statements looking across 
a range of issues-including demilitarisation. 
  However, the real clarification that Mr Adams has been 
seeking, according to high level offficials here, is not from 
the main parties to the declaration (their positions are 
basciaUy known) but from within the IRA itself. Adams is seen 
as in the centre of a "poisonous" power struggle. He is 
representative of a better educated generation which believes 
that the armed struggle can never be won and that it is time to 
modernise the IRA cause and move away from the hardline 
republicanism, hatred and mythology of past generations. 
  But Mr Adams's ability to bring the moderates along, let 
alone the extremists, is a high-wire act, and it is by no means 
clear whether he will cross to the other side. It must be 
remembered that the IRA has a strong vested interest in 
maintaining an armed struggle that has brought them a large flow 
of informal funds from the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. and 
created a black economy built on racketeering. 
  Moreover, nobody -- including Mr Adams -- knows what the 
reaction will be in the cells of South Armagh, the greatest 
stronghold of republicanism. If Mr Adams pushes too far he 
could find himself with a bullet in the neck, unleashing 
internecine warfare within the extremist nationalist movement. 
  There is no great optimism in Dublin government circles of 
the Downing Street declaration advancing. It believes it could 
fail for a number of reasons: the exposure of Mr Adams, failure 
of the British Government to maintain its secret track of 
dialogue, the weakness of John Major which leaves him vulnerable 
to the pressure of the more extreme Loyalists. 
  Sir Patrick's mid-course correction smacks of that. Despite 
all of this there is a conviction here that the gains in 
economic co-operation and standards of living which would follow 
rapprochement are far too important to be lost. Failure now 
would mean another two decades of armed stalemate and lost 
economic opportunities.

<F P=106> [Article by Baroness Lynda Chalker, UK minister of overseas </F>
development: "So Let's Debate the Aid Business"] 
  [Text] The last few weeks have seen a lot of comment on the 
British aid programme. Good, I want people to know what we do 
with taxpayers' money. But a lot of the comments have been 
inaccurate, indeed positively misleading. 
  I am not going to go into detail here on the Pergau 
[Malaysian dam] project. The Government stands by its decision 
to proceed with it. The Commons Select Committee on Foreign 
Affairs is conducting an inquiry. The Government will 
co-operate fully. 
  Let me tell you the reality of British aid. The real focus 
of British aid --during my time and before -- has been to help 
the poorest countries to raise the standard of living of their 
people. Especially their poorest people . To get out of the 
awful grind of poverty. To avoid that 10-mile walk to get clean 
water. To give people the chance of an education so that they, 
and their children, can live a better life than their parents. 
To give people access to those services that we take for 
granted, such as health care and education. Most of all, it is 
to give people choices over their own lives and their children's 
future. 
  Some 80 percent of British bilateral aid goes to the poorest 
countries of the world. All that aid is on grant terms -- none 
of it has to be repaid. The purpose of our aid is to help to 
put these countries and their people in a position to help 
themselves. We help their economies and we help the poorer 
people direct. 
  And it works. I have seen for myself water being piped into 
villages in Nepal. Water schemes where, for an expenditure of 
just 20 pounds per person, villagers who previously had to 
trudge across the hills for hours in search of water can now 
turn on a tap in their village. In poor countries the rate of 
infant morality has nearly halved over the past 25 years. Life 
expectancy has increased. Literacy rates have risen. British 
aid has been part of this. 
  And we help the vital process of establishing democratic 
systems and market economies in East and Central Europe and the 
former Soviet Union. Last year nearly 150m pounds of our money 
was spent through non-governmental organisations (NGOs). We 
have increased tenfold in the last decade our help to the NGOs 
through the Joint Funding Scheme. 
  The aid programme also helps io alleviate immediate 
suffering; 12 percent goes on humanitarian aid to countries such 
as Bosnia -- money that is spent on food to keep people alive in 
the terrible, tragic enclaves of Srebrenica and Gorazde. In 
Somalia we give food for those struggling to rebuild their 
economy after years of bitter civil war. 
  But let us not shy away from the fact that aid is part of a 
relationship; part of bilateral relations between countries; 
part of Britain's relationship with the world; part of 
international trading and financial systems. The problems faced 
by the developing world are not problems for them over there as 
opposed to us over here. The problems confront us all. 
Political stability, greater prosperity, the reform of the 
international trading system, and the improvement of the 
environment in which our children will be brought up -- these 
are all issues that affect us equally. Aid is a part of them. 
And that is why it has so many facets. 
  Our priority objectives are straightforward. To promote 
economic reforms and sustainable growth, to promote good 
government, poverty reduction, human development, to improve the 
status of women, and to tackle environmental problems. 
  These objectives are all in the long-term interests of 
Britain. We need a more stable, prosperous, open world economy. 
Many of the most effective ways of helping achieve these 
objectives also help Britain in a more immediate way. Our 
membership of organisations such as the World Bank gives British 
firms the right to bid for their contracts. The contracts we 
win are, in fact, worth more than the money we put in. And it 
is right for us to use the expertise and skills of consultants 
and companies, along with volunteer agencies, to help run our 
projects and programmes. 
  Much of the criticism I read and hear has been directed at 
the aid and trade provision (ATP). Anyone would think that this 
was the aid programme. In fact, in 1992/93 it accounted for 
less than 5 percent of the aid programme -- a little in excess 
of 90m pounds of a total of more than 1.9bn pounds. By 
comparison, in the same year we spent 290m pounds on 
humanitarian assistance. Since the aid and trade scheme was 
invented -- by a Labour government -- 272 projects have been 
approved. They cost 1.4bn pounds of ATP and have brought export 
business of 3.9bn pounds. 
  You have all seen the allegations that we are distorting our 
aid programme to secure arms contracts. Let me be clear. We do 
not -- and, while I am the minister responsible, will not -- 
link our aid to the sale of arms. 
  We have the sixth largest aid programme in the world. We 
give a higher proportion of our aid to the poorest countries 
than other major donors. Our record on humanitarian aid is 
second to none. The professionalism and impact of our work in 
health and population, in education, in slum improvement, in 
forests -- I could go on -- are widely admired. 
  The Development Assistance Committee -- the club of donors 
which judges its members -- has praised the effectiveness of 
the way the programme is run. We are leaders in pressing for 
solutions to the debt problems of the poorest countries. We 
press for better government, for respecting human rights, for 
sustainable economic policies. These are the issues to which we 
do link our aid. 
  The British aid programme involves taxpayers' money. It 
should be widely debated. But let the criticisms be based on 
fact, not on mischievous and half-baked lies and distortions. 
The Overseas Development Administration is not in the arms 
business. We are in the business of helping people to help 
themselves to grow and develop sustainably.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Rose of Bosnia: Politicians Must Now Match the </F>
More Robust Military Approach"] 
  [Text] Suddenly, there is better news from Bosnia. For 
months there has seemed no question of United Nations troops 
forcing aid past roadblocks. Although the arguments for this 
feeble approach have been more current among diplomats in 
London, Paris and New York than with the infantry grinding 
through the Bosnian slush, the result has been a timid 
interpretation of the UN mandate for the UN forces delivering 
aid. 
  Amid demoralisation all round, soldiers barred from using 
"all available means," as the UN promised, have been reduced to 
persuading, or bribing, their way past gunmen, old women or 
freelance gangsters. With too much aid being looted, tension 
has mounted between the troops and the people they are there to 
help. In London and Paris the politicians, prepared to utter 
fierce threats at the UN and NATO but unwilling to implement 
them, have taken to muttering "a plague on all their houses" and 
hinted that they will bring their boys home. 
  Now Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, the new UN 
commander 
in Bosnia, has begun to inject some soldierly sense into the 
morass of political indecision and half-measures. Declaring his 
intention to break with the "inconsistent and sometimes 
faint-hearted" use of the UN's mandate, he has tried what a 
little muscle can do. Earlier this week, he informed all 
parties that he would be mounting a "hardline, hardnosed" drive 
to deliver relief. 
  Yesterday, confronted by a Serb roadblock near Sarajevo, he 
sent British Warrior combat vehicles to back up negotiations and 
announced that they would force a way through if these failed. 
Within hours, all UN traffic was moving normally. The Serbs had 
been "persuaded" to honour the oft-repeated pledge by all sides 
not to block humanitarian operations. On Route Diamond, the 
lifeline to central Bosnia, a British armoured escort dispersed 
a civilian mob attempting to loot another convoy by firing two 
rounds in the air. 
  This and other small but symbolically important successes 
must now be built on. The immediate task is to get through to 
the most vulnerable enclaves. NATO should declare Tuzla airport 
open and say that any Serb attacks will be met with the force, 
including air power, at the UN's disposal. The Mostar-Sarajevo 
road could, with determination, be secured. Such steps seem 
less politically impossible than they did a few weeks ago. Sir 
Michael has said he has no qualms about calling in air power to 
protect his troops. The UN secretary-general has at last agreed 
to delegate decisions on air power to local level, where they 
belong. France is now demanding an end to Western military and 
diplomatic paralysis. 
  Douglas Hurd appears to have returned from the Bosnian front 
line a wiser man. British soldiers did not make mass complaints 
that humanitarian relief was prolonging the fighting. They 
pointed out what should have been obvious: first, that the 
military would always eat even when women and children starved; 
second, that the big losers would be the Bosnian government 
side, the victims of aggression. Unlike the Serbs and Croats, 
they were hemmed in, with no external supply lines. British 
officers told him that they were confident they could do a 
decent job of saving lives, if they were only permitted to set 
about it more "robustly." 
  Sir Michael has made a good start in the field; the 
diplomats 
must do their part, starting on Monday when the European Union's 
[EU] foreign ministers meet. The UN has now officially confirmed 
what has been common knowledge for weeks: Croatia's deployment 
of regular forces in Bosnia. Britain and France must push 
Germany to come off the fence and agree immediately to end 
Croatia's trade concessions with the EU. Germany's main 
obsession, in an election year, is to stem the flow of Croatian 
refugees; but Croatia's escalation of the war will have just 
that effect, and deterrence is imperative. The UN Security 
Council must go further than the EU, imposing economic sanctions. 
  This would make it far easier to persuade the Russians that 
Serbs as well as Croats must yield more territory. That is the 
way to end this war. There has been too much talk about the 
Bosnian government's intransigence in refusing to accept 
patchwork fragments of territory which nobody dares pretend can 
long be viable as a state. So long as the Bosnians have nothing 
to lose, it is absurd to expect them to lay down their arms.

<F P=106> [Jurek Martin article: "America Lays Ghosts of Its War in </F>
Vietnam"] 
  [Text] American presidents sometimes act out of character 
when occasion demands. Harry Truman, suspected of isolationism, 
launched the Marshall Plan and NATO to put war-shattered Europe 
back on its feet; Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, cold war 
warriors both, opened improbable avenues of co-operation and 
communication with China and the former Soviet Union 
respectively. 
  By these historical standards, there is something both 
consistent and logical in Bill Clinton's drawing of a line under 
the Vietnam War by his decision last night to end the trade 
embargo. This is a president, after all, who never served in 
uniform and, as a young man, publicly opposed the war. There 
was even a time early in the 1992 campaign when, because of his 
evasion of the draft, it seemed he might become its latest 
victim, nearly 20 years after military hostilities had ceased. 
  Yet so powerful are the emotions still stirred by the only 
war the U.S. can definitively be said to have "lost" in 200 
years that Mr Clinton did not rush into normalising relations 
with Vietnam. Instead he carefully built up political 
constituencies at home and patiently followed the general road 
map laid out by George Bush, another president who, in the first 
flushes of victory after the Gulf War, must surely have been 
tempted also to come to terms with Vietnam. 
  America's Vietnam casualty list is long indeed, since 
President John Kennedy's fateful steps to contain the communist 
tide over 30 years ago. It must begin with the 67,000-plus 
soldiers who never came home and the many more who returned 
maimed in body and mind, the first returning U.S. soldiers not 
to be welcomed as conquering heroes. 
  It took many years, and more controversy, for their 
sacrifice 
finally to be recognised in the shape of the Vietnam Memorial on 
the Washington Mall. It is a recognition like no other -- a 
long low dark gray wall etched with the names of everyone who 
died -- and its juxtaposition next to the heroic and classical 
Lincoln Memorial speaks volumes. 
  The plight of the dead and the survivors is now embedded in 
popular culture, recognised in films and books beyond number. 
Words and images from that era still resonate the "domino 
theory," Agent Orange, the Tet offensive, the My Lai massacre 
and subsequent trial of Lt William Calley, the pictures of the 
little Vietnamese girl burning from napalm, of the execution of 
a captured Vietcong and of helicopters whirring above the U.S. 
embassy in Saigon as the last Americans were evacuated. 
  Few, if any, generations, have been so seared by a foreign 
conflict which found the nation so divided. The chalice 
inherited by the "best and the brightest" in government, who 
flocked to Washington with Kennedy and mostly stayed with 
Johnson, was poisoned. 
  Many tuned out and turned off, their contributions to 
society 
so much less than they might have been. A few sought 
consolation in different forms of public service -- like Robert 
McNamara who, perhaps, salved his wounds and guilt as defence 
secretary with two distinguished terms as president of the World 
Bank. But he rarely spoke about Vietnam and only now is putting 
together memoirs of the period. 
  Political victims abound. Lyndon Johnson, faced with turmoil 
in the streets of Washington and around his country, decided not 
to run for re-election in 1968 and died, a broken man, three 
years later. 
  His Democratic Party, under Hubert Humphrey, not only lost 
the presidency in 1968 but took years to come to terms with 
Vietnam, holding the White House for only four of the next 24 
years. In 1972, its presidential nomination was captured by 
George McGovern, the anti-war candidate. He went down to a 
landslide defeat to Richard Nixon, who, nevertheless, was not 
above manipulating the Vietnam peace process on the eve of the 
election to maximise his victory (he lost only liberal 
Massachusetts.) 
  Four years later, the Watergate scandal helped propel Jimmy 
Carter into the White House but he, too, was afflicted by the 
Vietnam syndrome, this time in Iran. A botched rescue attempt 
in the spring of 1980 of the U.S. hostages in Tehran came to 
seem pathetically indecisive when compared to Ronald Reagan's 
blunt assertion that he would set "a date certain" for release 
of the hostages, in the absence of which U.S. bombs would start 
falling. 
  Subsequent Republican presidents seemed to have learned this 
lesson better, committing themselves to the doctrine of "main 
force," winning little victories in Grenada and Panama and a big 
one in the Gulf, and proclaiming with each notch on the belt 
that the Vietnam nightmare was over and that U.S. forces would 
now be allowed by the politicians to win wars. But this did not 
help George Bush in 1992. 
  Nor is it clear that their contention is valid. There is no 
evidence of American appetite for foreign military adventure, be 
it in Bosnia, Somalia or anywhere not incontrovertibly related 
to the national interest. 
  This may be ascribed to the end of the Cold War and the 
imperatives of domestic renewal. But it may also be the real 
final legacy of Vietnam. "No more war" was a powerful chant in 
the streets of America in 1968. It would still be so today.

<F P=106> [Michael Smith report: "BNF Urges Government to Guarantee </F>
Costs"] 
  [Text] British Nuclear Fuels [BNF] has told the government 
that it will be unable to secure 19bn pounds of reprocessing 
contracts without a government guarantee against unexpected 
costs. 
  The state-owned fuel reprocessing company has been trying 
for 
four years to conclude long-term deals to treat waste fuel from 
the UK's two nuclear power utilities. But Nuclear Electric and 
Scottish Nuclear are refusing to agree unless the government 
protects them against unforeseen cost increases. 
  The contracts hold the key to the future of BNF, which 
recently received the government's go-ahead to start up its 
controversial Thorp reprocessing plant in Cumbria. 
  BNF's auditors, Ernst and Young, said in the company's 
annual 
report yesterday that the company "regards government financial 
support in the form of underwriting to be a prerequisite to the 
completion of these contracts." The accounts were drawn up on 
the assumption of a government guarantee. 
  The Department of Trade and Industry, which a year ago 
withdrew an earlier commitment to underwrite the contracts, said 
yesterday that it was considering BNF's request. 
  Greenpeace, the environmental group, said it may challenge 
BNF's accounts on the basis that the government may not agree to 
the underwriting. 
  The accounts also revealed that the year-long delay in 
approval for Thorp helped depress BNF's 1992-93 profits to less 
than half their previous year's level. BNF reported profits of 
76m pounds for the year to March 31, against 161m pounds for the 
previous year. Turnover was marginally down at 1.05bn pounds 
from 1.08bn pounds. The results were at the lower end of 
analysts' expectations. The dividend to the government was 
halved to 26m pounds. 
  Mr John Guinness, chairman, said he expected profitability 
in 
1993-94 to be similar to that of last year, with the Thorp delay 
playing an even greater role in the result. He said the Thorp 
effect last year was 18m pounds but this year it would be about 
90m pounds. 
  Mr Guinness said next year's profitability would rebound 
significantly as Thorp would play a full role. 
  BNF said Thorp was not the only reason for the profit 
downturn. Profits had been depressed by 30m pounds as a result 
of the nine-week shutdown in 1992 of Magnox reprocessing at 
Sellafield, Cumbria. A further 40m pounds depressant was an 
advance writedown of costs associated with the merger of BNF's 
enrichment assets at Capenhurst, Chester, into a company, Urenco. 
  The company put restructuring costs, including staff cuts, 
at 
20m pounds.

<F P=106> [Ross Tieman report: "MPs Warn Over 18 Billion Pounds </F>
Nuclear Clean-Up Cost"] 
  [Text] Deep disquiet over the estimated 18 billion pounds 
cost of decommissioning Britain's nuclear power plants has been 
voiced by the powerful cross-party Commons Public Accounts 
Commitee. 
  In a hard-hitting review of the industry's provisions, the 
committee calls for a "visible, guaranteed fund to provide for 
decommissioning." Members suggest that the nonfossil fuel 
obligation, a 1 billion-pound-a-year levy on consumers' bills 
intended to fund decommissioning in England and Wales, is little 
more than a tax on consumers. 
  They say that while Nuclear Electric, the biggest 
state-owned 
atomic generator, seems confident that it can meet its 
obligations, Scottish Nuclear will become technically insolvent 
in the next financial year without further government 
intervention. 
  Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West and a member of 
the 
committee, said: "The Government is clearly charging a 10 
percent tax on electricity to pay for decommissioning nuclear 
power stations. It is costing the consumer 1 billion pounds a 
year. Until 1998, when this levy effectively ends, the consumer 
will pay this plus 17.5 percent VAT [value added tax], leading 
to soaring bills." 
  The committee's report, The Cost of Decommissioning Nuclear 
Facilities, will increase pressure on the Government to draw up 
a broad brief for its overdue review of the nuclear industry's 
future. It will also add to the difficulties Nuclear Electric 
faces in its efforts to win planning consent to build a 
pressurised water plant in Suffolk, alongside the Sizewell B 
plant now nearing completion. 
  The two leading nuclear power companies last night defended 
themselves vigorously. John Collier, the chairman of Nuclear 
Electric, said: "We know exactly how to decommission all Nuclear 
Electric's power stations." The company's total decommissioning 
liability, in real terms, was 2.7 billion pounds, he said. 
"We're right on track to meet that bill without any need for 
subsidy or extension of the levy." 
  Robin Jeffrey, the chief executive of Scottish Nuclear, 
confirmed that his company would become technically insolvent if 
it failed to tackle its problems. But he added: "We have every 
confidence that cost-saving projects, which include the dry 
storage of spent fuel and a new approach to decommissioning 
known as Safestore, will ensure that the question of technical 
insolvency will not arise." 
  The Public Accounts Committee looked at decommissioning 
costs 
right across the industry. Its report notes that accounting 
provisions in the nuclear generating industry rose from 1.1 
billion pounds in 1987 to 3.76 billion pounds in 1989. Planned 
privatisation was subsequently abandoned because investors were 
worried about the industry's liabilities, including 
decommissioning. By 1992, the total cost of closing and removing 
civil nuclear plants and cleaning up associated radioactive 
contamination was estimated at 18 billion pounds for the four 
companies--Nuclear Electric, Scottish Nuclear, British Nuclear 
Fuels and AEA, the former Atomic Energy Authority. 
  The process involves removal of fuel and ancillary plant, 
followed a century later by dismantling and burial elsewhere of 
the reactor. 
  MPs are concerned that although Nuclear Electric says it has 
about 1.5 billion pounds of deposits for decommissioning with 
the National Loans Fund, some of the provisions have been used 
to fund construction of Sizewell B. The company insists that 
revenues from Sizewell will be used to top up the provisions.

"Contract To Update Royal Navy Submarines"] 
  [Text] A contract worth more than 180m pounds for new 
equipment in Royal Navy Trafalgar Class submarines has been 
placed with Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems, Jonathan Aitken, 
Minister for Defence Procurement, announced today. 
  In a written answer to a Parliamentary Question from Peter 
Luff MP (Worcester), Mr Aitken said: 
  "I am pleased to announce that we have today placed a 
contract with Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems (FTSS) for the Full 
Development and Initial Production of Sonar 2076 which will be 
fitted to TRAFALGAR Class Fleet submarines. 
  "The contract has been awarded following competition and 
covers the provision of four boat sets and supporting shore 
equipment. At a price in excess of 180m pounds it is the largest 
single sonar order placed for some time and will continue to 
keep the Royal Navy at the forefront on sonar technology and 
capability into the foreseeable future. 
  "The contract is likely to create a number of new jobs and 
will safeguard hundreds of others at FTSS and at many 
sub-contractors, and will be welcomed by British Industry."

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Hans-Juergen Wischnewski, 
politician of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and 
former minister of the chancellery, has come out in favor of 
bombing Serbian positions as a reaction to the grenade attack on 
Sarajevo. In the ZDF [Second German Television Channel] cast 
"1130 -- Eser and Guests," he said on Sunday [6 February]: "If 
there is no reaction to that, we can forget everything." 
  Wischnewski warned the West against further inaction. This 
promotes fundamentalism in the Arab states, said the chairman of 
the Middle East Committee of the Socialist International who is 
knowledgeable about the Arab states. The indecision, especially 
by the Western states, gives rise to the impression that the 
Christian world is leaving the Muslims "in the lurch."

  [Text] Detmold (DPA) -- On Saturday [5 February], about 
3,500 demonstrators protested against right-wing extremism in 
Detmold. The participants, including about 400 members of 
"autonomous groups," marched to the former party headquarters of 
the Nationalist Front (NF), which has been banned. The largely 
peaceful demonstration was accompanied by a heavy police 
presence. 
  According to a police release on Sunday, 80 persons were 
arrested before and during the rally. Thirty of them will be 
reported for, among other things, violating the Arms Law and for 
the ban on hiding one's face. The police officials seized 
baseball bats, knives, tear gas, one ax, and a rubber hammer. 
  Before the rally, 49 members of the "rightist scene" were 
arrested, because the police had received information about 
planned acts of violence to be committed against the 
demonstration. The men had stayed in the former NF party 
headquarters.

As the public prosecutor announced today, the 25-year-old 
imprisoned right-wing extremist from the Frankfurt/Main area is 
strongly suspected of having planned and prepared the 
publication of "THE INSIGHT -- the Nationalist Resistance 
Newspaper Against Increasing Red Front and Anarchistic 
Terrorism" since autumn with other, unknown persons. 
  The investigating judge at the Federal Court of Justice 
issued an arrest warrant against the suspect upon an inquiry by 
the general public prosecutor. Among other things, the arrest 
warrant includes the allegation that the suspect instigated and 
founded a criminal association. According to the current state 
of investigations, the 25-year-old man alleged wrote the text 
and the introduction of THE INSIGHT. 
  The introduction of the publication, which has been 
distributed since November 1993, includes calls for offenses 
against the persons listed with their addresses in the 
publication. According to the court in Karlsruhe, the suspect 
found a printer who was ready to print the publication.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the recessionary year of 1993 west 
German industry had to reduce its output by an annual average of 
7 percent compared with 1992. As the FRG Economics Ministry 
announced on Wednesday [2 February] by presenting the December 
results, according to preliminary calculations, output increased 
slightly by 0.5 percent in price and seasonally adjusted terms 
during the last month of 1993 compared with the previous month. 
However, the Federal Statistical Office expects this result to 
be "corrected downward." Nevertheless, the ministry stresses 
that "all the main groups of the producing industry" with the 
exception of electricity and gas supply are affected by the 
(currently existing) increase in output; this is most marked in 
the construction sector with an increase of 5 percent following 
unusually cold weather in November. 
  At the beginning of January, the ministry reported a decline 
in overall industrial output by 2 percent in November compared 
with October 1993. According to the two-month comparison of 
November/December over September/October 1993, which does not 
show so many oscillations, net industrial output declined by 
only 1 percent. Only the electricity and gas suppliers were 
able to raise their output by 1.5 percent, while construction 
output went down by 3.5 percent. This two-month comparison 
shows that processing industry output was down by 1 percent. 
This primarily affected investment goods, at minus 1.5 percent, 
as well as essential and nonessential foods and beverages, minus 
2 percent. Compared with the November/December 1992 period, 
west German industrial output went down by a total of 2.9 
percent.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- The Chancellor's Office in Bonn has 
partly rejected a report by DER SPIEGEL news magazine claiming 
that nuclear material from the former Warsaw Pact states could 
get into the hands of Western terrorists. "The potential for 
danger is rising," admitted State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer 
(Christian Democratic Union), who is responsible for the 
intelligence services, but he added that, despite intensive 
observation of the market, there have been no signs of a threat 
by nuclear terrorists. "So far, there is no indication at all. 
Weapons-grade material has not turned up in our country at 
all.... Terrorists do not have access to weapons-grade 
material, because it is not available on the market," he said in 
an interview with RTL. 
  "It can still be ruled out that nuclear warheads are 
available in an uncontrolled manner," the news magazine quotes a 
report by the Federal Intelligence Office (BND). Referring to 
the same source, however, DER SPIEGEL warns that nuclear bombs 
and biological weapons from East Europe could soon be in the 
hands "of Western gangs." 
  The 18-page BND report speaks of a "trend toward escalating 
the situation." Smuggling centers include Vilnius and Kamas in 
Lithuania. According to the magazine, the FRG has become the 
hub for nuclear smuggling. Schmidbauer explained this by 
referring to the FRG's geographical location. The minister 
reported that 300 to 350 cases of illegal nuclear trade or 
smuggling have been registered over the past two years. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna also 
does not assume that blackmailers will soon have access to 
nuclear weapons. "So far, we have not noticed anything like 
that in our worldwide monitoring," a spokesman said in an 
interview with the private radio station RADIO 7 in Ulm. The 
IAEA has helped the CIS states to establish inspection bodies so 
as to prevent trade of weapons-grade material.

<F P=106> [Carmen Parra report: "Gonzalez Receives Trade Unions and </F>
CEOE Tomorrow"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- The labor reform is untouchable. This 
is what Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will reiterate tomorrow 
when he receives separately the top leaders of the trade unions 
and the employers' organization. His proposal will be very 
clear: New topics -- the incomes agreement, the social 
protection model, the occupational health bill, or the reform of 
pensions -- can be negotiated, but the labor reform will not be 
touched in anything substantial. In the letter which he sent to 
trade union leaders Nicolas Redondo and Antonio Gutierrez 
yesterday, the prime minister reiterates that any change is 
subject to prior agreement between the employers' organization 
and the trade unions; a virtually impossible condition, as the 
Spanish Confederation of Employers Organizations made clear. 
The trade unions received Gonzalez' message with 
"disappointment." 
  Jose Maria Zufiaur asserted that it is "political suicide" 
to 
seek to disregard the general strike and ignore millions of 
workers' rejection of the labor reform. 
  The prime minister's letter gives some clues to the 
government's intentions. It suggests negotiation of an incomes 
agreement to the trade unions and reminds them that the labor 
reform is passing through parliament. In addition, Labor 
Ministry officials are preparing a list of new topics which can 
begin to be negotiated -- the social protection system, the 
occupational health bill, or the reform of future pensions. 
  Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office Miguel Gil 
confirmed to EL PAIS that the labor measures will not be 
renegotiated, but other matters, which are "certainly important, 
such as the incomes agreement," can be discussed. 
  On the labor market, Gonzalez refers to accepting "changes 
consistent with the meaning of the reform which enjoy the 
agreement of the trade unions and the employers' organization." 
  Time is an adverse factor, because the period for the 
parliamentary groups to submit their partial amendments to the 
three bills in hand expires 8 February. Afterward, until their 
approval in the Senate -- it is estimated that this could be in 
June -- there is always some chance of introducing changes, 
although it is certainly more difficult now. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aznar Says Trade Unions Would Not </F>
Have Staged Strike Against People's Party Government"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria 
Aznar stated yesterday that he believes the trade unions would 
not have staged a general strike six months after the election 
against a government headed by him. In an interview granted to 
Onda Cero, Aznar asserted that following last week's trade union 
protest he hopes to convince the Spanish people that the best 
thing is "the complete government alternative" that he 
represents. 
  Aznar emphasized that the government of Felipe Gonzalez is 
"a 
victim of its deceptions," which are causing it "a great lack of 
credibility among the Spanish people." "This country cannot be 
brought through like this," he said. In the opinion of the 
People's Party leader, many of Spain's problems depend "on that 
political change occurring" -- but, he specified, "when it can. 
In the meantime," he added, "we must seek to ensure that the 
country does not deteriorate." 
  Aznar emphasized the need to analyze, discuss, and debate 
the 
situation "where the country's political solutions must be 
found, which is in the Congress of Deputies." For this reason, 
he explained, the People's Party has demanded that the state of 
the nation debate be held in February. The party is opposed to 
postponing it until after the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers 
Party] congress in March. "If it is not held now, in this very 
grave crisis situation, when will it be held?" he asked. 
  The People's Party chairman maintained his support for the 
labor reform measures promoted by the government, but at some 
distance and without forgoing specific criticisms. For 
instance, he supported the apprenticeship contracts because, he 
specified, "a cheap contract is preferable to (a young person's) 
having no job." 
  He criticized, however, the regulation of the apprenticeship 
contracts. "It seems to me absolutely wrong," he said, "that a 
28-year-old person can be defined as an apprentice." The 
alternatives would be work experience contracts for young people 
who have failed in their education or vocational training. 
  Aznar accused Gonzalez' government of reducing the 
purchasing 
power of pensioners, maintained that the state welfare system 
could become financially unviable if the economic situation 
deteriorates, and called for a parliamentary committee to 
oversee the process of refloating Banesto [Credit Bank of 
Spain], which will cost every Spanish family 14,000 pesetas, he 
said. 
  Finally, Aznar proposed a reflection on the nationalists' 
role. "If a policy, as a result of which the only thing that 
concerns a certain territory of a certain community is its own 
interest, becomes general," he explained, "we will then be 
making Spain impossible." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Javier Moreno report: "Solbes Asserts That Government Will </F>
Continue Economic Policy at All Costs"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Around 50 important Spanish and foreign 
businessmen who attended an economic symposium in Madrid 
yesterday took good note of the Spanish Government's firmness. 
"Whatever happens at the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] 
Congress, the economic policy will continue," Minister of the 
Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, who does not belong to the 
Socialist Party, assured them. In order to round off the 
atmosphere of confidence which he was seeking to achieve, the 
economy minister stated that he has decided to accelerate the 
administration's outstanding payments to private enterprise, and 
disclosed that in the last quarter of 1993 the economy improved 
slightly compared with the same period in the previous year. 
  Solbes himself acknowledged afterward that he went too far 
in 
stating that he will continue the government's economic policy 
irrespective of the Socialist Party congress' results. "My 
assertion was overemphatic," the minister acknowledged at a 
press conference after delivering an address at the sixth 
roundtable organized by the British weekly THE ECONOMIST. 
  "What I meant is that I am convinced the congress will 
support the government's economic policy," he explained. 
However, the minister's intention in his address was to make it 
quite clear that no sector of the Socialist Party -- referring 
to Guerraism -- will curb the reform of the labor market, 
according to ministry sources. 
  In this respect, Solbes was especially clear during his 
exposition. "Demands for changes without any kind of 
rationality" will not succeed in changing the government's 
stance, the minister said, in order to make it clear that the 
government will not allow itself to be influenced by the recent 
general strike. "The labor reform is absolutely essential," 
Solbes concluded. 
  Solbes took advantage of his appearance before this select 
group of international businessmen to try to create an 
atmosphere of confidence by intimating that the Spanish economy 
is emerging from the recession it is in. Hence the minister 
revealed that, according to the figures at his ministry's 
disposal, GDP in the last quarter remained "in balance or was 
positive" compared with the same period in the previous year." 
  "I have decided to accelerate the administration's 
outstanding payments to enterprises," the economy minister also 
revealed. The decision, which will serve "to clarify the 
situation" in state accounts, will cause an apparent increase in 
the deficit in the first few months of 1994. This will come 
after "a really spectacular increase in the deficit" in 1993. 
"We will witness," he added, "an imminent controversy over the 
deficit," forecast Solbes, who, however, kept the deficit target 
for 1994 at 5.7 percent of GDP. 
  The minister also took the opportunity to propose again a 
reconsideration of the current pensions system, which, he 
asserted, "in the long term is leading us to a dead end." The 
future law, which will seek to counterbalance state pensions 
with private pension schemes, will not be enacted before 1995. 
"It cannot be adopted rapidly," the minister said: "We are 
talking about pensions in 20 years' time -- not current 
pensions." 
  Just as Pedro Solbes had done in the morning, Grinan 
asserted 
in the afternoon that "the labor reform is fully supported and 
in its entirety by the Socialist parliamentary group by the 
party leadership" which will emerge from the next congress. 
[sentence as published] 
  The labor minister gave some figures to show the merits of 
the apprenticeship and part-time contracts, two of the most 
controversial aspects of the labor reform which led to the 
general strike. Grinan said that since the beginning of the 
year there have been 1,500 part-time contracts per day, and 
this, in his opinion, illustrates "the enormous popularity which 
they are enjoying." Minister Solbes asserted this weekend that 
apprenticeship contracts are being signed at an average rate of 
500 per day. According to the Labor Ministry, over 50 percent 
of the part-time contracts signed are for women, and around 50 
percent entail less than half the working day.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Spanish Balance of Trade Improved by </F>
30 Percent in 1993"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The Spanish balance of trade closed at the 
end of 1993 with a deficit of 2.5 trillion pesetas, a figure 
30.5 percent below the 1992 fiscal year, when a deficit of 3.5 
trillion pesetas was reached, according to figures supplied by 
the Ministry of the Economy and Finance yesterday. 
  These results are due to the "good performance by exports 
and 
the moderate performance by imports," which totaled 7.9 trillion 
pesetas -- 20.8 percent more than in 1992 -- and which tripled 
the figure recorded during the 12 months of 1992 [sentence as 
published]. 
  In 1993, imports [as published] represented a total of 10.4 
trillion pesetas, a figure which represents a 2.7 percent 
increase -- half that in 1992. The cover rate was 76.2 percent 
during last year -- 11 percent above 1992. 
  According to the Economy Ministry, which described the 1993 
results as "moderate, the foundations have been laid for the 
recent upturn shown by most production and demand indicators to 
become consolidated in 1994." 
  The geographical distribution of trade flows during last 
year 
shows a relative loss of importance by exports to the European 
Union [EU], which represented 68.2 percent of the total, as 
against the 71.2 percent registered during 1992. Imports from 
the EU increased by 3.2 percent, as against the 2 percent 
increase from other, non-Community, countries, a figure which 
keeps their 61 percent share of total purchases virtually stable. 
  In the last month of 1993, the value of imports slightly 
exceeded 1 trillion pesetas, which represented a percentage 
increase of 21.1 percent with respect to the same month in 1992. 
This "represents an appreciable acceleration with respect to the 
rates recorded in previous months," according to the Economy 
Ministry. As for exports, these reached the figure of 847 
billion pesetas -- 34.2 percent more than in 1992.

  [Text] The European Union's [EU] Ministerial Council 
tonight unanimously approved the appointment of Frenchman Serge 
Abou as EU observer at the talks on the Cyprus issue. He will 
be reporting on the course of the talks and whether they are 
proceeding in accordance with Community norms. 
  Ioannis Kranidhiotis, Greek Foreign Ministry secretary 
general, said that the observer's appointment was accepted by 
the 12 EU ministers with great satisfaction. The proposal for 
Serge Abou's appointment was submitted by Hans van den Broek, EU 
Commissioner in charge of foreign relations. Hans van den Broek 
made it clear that the observer will be following the talks on 
the Cyprus issue as an EU representative, but in his capacity as 
employee of the European Commission, he will submit his reports 
to the competent Commission members. According to our 
correspondent, the Council of Ministers will be free to summon 
the observer for direct briefings or it will be briefed by Hans 
van den Broek.

<F P=106> [Report by Marc Paoloni in Brussels: "France Sends New </F>
Signal To Beijing"] 
  [Text] Paris has just made a discreet, new gesture 
favorable to Beijing. Breaking with its rather protectionist 
tradition, France has come out in favor of imposing import 
quotas on a minimum amount of Chinese products. To the great 
displeasure of some of its traditional trading partners, notably 
Spain, the French foreign minister will probably vote with the 
"liberal" countries on 7 February in Brussels to liberalize 
trade between the EC and China. 
  The "Chinese quotas" issue conceals the wider problem of the 
single-market-inspired requirement to replace national quotas 
imposed on state-controlled countries with EC quotas. In actual 
fact, because of the GATT membership of many of the countries in 
the former Communist bloc and the bilateral agreements concluded 
between certain other countries and the EC, the only thing left 
for discussion are the some 6,000 quotas imposed on China. 
Eliminating these quotas raises the question of the number and 
volume of EC quotas to be set up in their place. The Commission 
proposed nine categories of products: gloves, shoes, china, 
ceramics, glass articles, radios, toys, bicycles, and 
chloramphenicol. France has aligned itself with the liberal 
countries, which have suggested limiting these categories to 
seven. 
<H5>  Toward Conciliatory Attitude by Germany </H5>
  This would appear to be a doubly profitable choice since it 
seems to have enabled Paris to ensure a conciliatory attitude by 
Bonn next Monday -- barring any surprises -- on one aspect of 
the Union's new "trade defense" device, which was left out of 
the political compromise reached on this issue last 15 December: 
the decisionmaking mechanism within the EC regarding procedures 
for settling GATT trade disputes and for "managing" arbitration. 
  In actual fact, all these issues are linked. It will be up 
to the ministers to adopt the legislative texts on 7 February 
that will transform the political agreement reached in 
mid-December -- in the margins of the Uruguay Round -- in order 
to strengthen the Community's trade defense instruments. This 
involves the improvement of antidumping and antisubsidy measures 
and the implementation of safeguard clauses, thereby 
accelerating retaliation and making it less dependent on 
majorities that cannot be reached among the Twelve. With regard 
to the "new trade policy instrument" -- which is supposed to 
allow Europeans to retaliate against unfair practices on the 
world market but which in reality is never used -- it was merely 
agreed that if the other members of GATT did not abrogate their 
unilateral retaliatory weapons -- in this case the United States 
and section 301 of its trade legislation -- then the Twelve 
would take "the appropriate steps."

  [Text] Finland might move straight to so-called green 
prices for agricultural products if it gets the regional 
subsidies it wants from the European Union [EU]. This was 
stated by Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen in Stockholm 
after his meeting with the other Nordic ministers. Timo 
Seppaenen reports. 
  [Seppaenen] The demands for regional subsidies presented to 
the EU by Finland, Sweden, and Norway are very similar. Swedish 
Minister of European Affairs Ulf Dinkelspiel said, however, that 
the EU negotiators have a somewhat more positive attitude toward 
subsidy requests from Norway and Finland than ones from Sweden. 
Sweden has not connected its demands regarding these subsidies 
to any other issue in the negotiations. In negotiations 
concerning Sweden, every matter is discussed on its own merits, 
Dinkelspiel affirms. 
  Finland's negotiating strategy is different, at least 
concerning regional subsidies. Foreign Trade Minister Pertti 
Salolainen said in Stockholm that Finland might use the price of 
agricultural products as a carrot to tempt the EU to promise 
regional subsidies as generous as Finland has hoped for. 
According to Salolainen, Finland might promise the EU that it 
will move more quickly than expected to green prices, which are 
cheaper than the current prices. Salolainen even said that 
Finland might consider moving straight to such prices if a 
satisfactory solution is reached in the regional subsidy matter. 
What Salolainen said reveals a fairly essential aspect of 
Finland's negotiating tactics and his message shows what a how 
crucial regional subsidies are for Finland. 
  Both Sweden and Norway place great importance on this 
matter. 
Sweden, for example, is hoping to get the so-called first class 
regional subsidy, which the EU gives to its poorest southern 
member countries, for Norrland [northern area of Sweden]. 
According to the Swedish minister of European affairs, Sweden 
could never accept an unambiguous no from the EU to the demands 
on regional subsidies for Norrland.

<F P=106> [Antonio Cerrillo report: "Environmental Action Will Be </F>
EC's Economic Driving Force"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- Ioannis Paleokrassas, European 
Commissioner for Fisheries and the Environment, has asserted 
that measures to preserve the environment will be the main 
source of job creation in Europe over the next few years. 
"Protection of the environment will be the driving force for 
the growth of the European Union [EU]," he said in a lecture 
delivered at the Catalan Employers for Europe organization, 
where he was introduced by its chairman, Carles Gasoliba, before 
a very large audience comprising representatives of the 
administration and industrialists. 
  During his address, Paleokrassas, a conservative Greek 
politician who was twice a minister in his country, outlined the 
main aspects of the EU's new environmental policy. He said that 
it seeks to banish the idea of industrial production based on 
the depletion of natural resources and to replace it with a 
principle aimed at protecting and safeguarding this natural 
heritage for future generations. He also stressed that 
protection of the environment should not be just a policy in 
itself but should be a precondition for industrial expansion. 
  "The new course in environmental policy (the European 
Commission's white paper) is that economic and fiscal means 
should be used, instead of the old methods of legislation and 
controls," because, among other reasons, "it has been seen that 
this is not effective," Paleokrassas told this newspaper. To 
this effect, the commissioner believes that the cost of products 
should include the environmental cost stemming from the natural 
resources which they deplete, the pollution which they produce, 
or the waste which they create. 
  Within this same strategy, he supports the European 
Commission's decision to impose ecological taxes in order to 
increase the cost of using energy sources which cause carbon 
dioxide emissions, as a way to alleviate the greenhouse effect. 
He said that unless this method is used, the volume of carbon 
dioxide emissions would not be stabilized at the 1990 levels, 
which the EU had set itself as an overall target. "If the 
carbon dioxide tax is not adopted, studies show us that it would 
exceed the 1990 levels by 3 percent in the year 2000," he warned. 
  He also supports Jacques Delors' proposal for "waging a 
crusade" to extend this ecological tax to the whole world. "The 
greatest danger is of these emissions increasing in the rest of 
the world, where there is no control," he added. 
  He refuted the idea that the economic crisis subordinates 
environmental concerns: "In Europe, measures in the 
environmental field will create at least 2.5 million jobs over 
the next five years, and other studies show that this figure 
could rise to 5 million," he stated. 
  Paleokrassas deemed generally "insufficient" the programs 
drawn up by the various countries in order to fulfill the 
commitments which they undertook at the Earth Summit (1992) in 
signing the climate change treaty, and claimed that only Europe 
has drawn up plans to combat the effects of a possible climatic 
change. 
  On the implementation of EU directives, he said that Spain 
in 
general carries out those concerning the protection of birds, 
"but the degree of fulfillment is not as satisfactory in the 
case of public works and conducting environmental impact 
studies. Spain is in an intermediate position; it is not among 
the worst," he concluded.

<F P=106> [Pierre Lefevre and Andre Riche interview with Belgian </F>
Foreign Minister Willy Claes; place and date not given: "Claes: 
Measured Firmness"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
<H3>  If the Worrying Signs Coming 
Out of Russia Increase </H3>
  [LE SOIR] The countries of Central Europe are expressing 
dissatisfaction with NATO's "Partnership for Peace" proposal. 
Belgium has always felt close to these countries. Are you 
yourself satisfied with the proposal? 
  [Claes] Yes, because I do not see any alternative to the 
U.S. 
proposal. We must continue to reject any fatalistic approach to 
Moscow. The immediate integration of several Central European 
countries would not only mean redrawing the areas of influence 
and a dividing line a few hundred kilometers further east, but 
would, above all, amount to an acknowledgement that these 
countries are in danger and that they must be protected against 
a danger coming from Moscow, and that we do not believe that 
those who want to complete the democratization of Russia have 
any chance of success. While in fact Russia could be one of the 
principal partners in a policy for stability in Europe. 
  Also, the Polish, the Czechs and others should not believe 
that it is sufficient to simply enter the antechamber and wait 
for the door to open at a certain moment. It is also up to them 
to prove that they are ready to make the efforts, to give the 
necessary guarantees to enter gradually into the NATO family. 
And from a practical point of view, it would be naive to 
believe that it is possible to apply overnight the guarantee of 
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty to an additional four or 
five countries. To do so, you must take all the required 
military precautions and reorganize NATO. For a number of 
reasons, I therefore believe the "Partnership for Peace" to be 
the right approach. But this does not mean that the Russians 
have a right of veto. Quite the contrary. While, just a few 
weeks ago, we gave ourselves quite a lot of time to pursue a 
step-by-step strategy towards membership without any fixed 
deadlines, if present political developments continue in Moscow 
and the worrying signs increase, we will no doubt have to speed 
up the move towards integration within NATO of those Central 
European countries which satisfy the required conditions. 
  [LE SOIR] What worrying signs? 
  [Claes] Firstly, the election results. Then the very clear 
attitude of the progressives, Gaydar, Fedorov and others, who 
have left the government, not to mention the antics of 
Zhirinovskiy. There are also doubts at the economic level. I am 
referring to the most recent stance taken by the IMF which has 
banged its fist on the table saying that we cannot continue to 
apply the programs if the other side do not play strictly to the 
rules. 
  [LE SOIR] Is this a position you share? 
  [Claes] Yes. There are limits to everything. There is no 
point in making great efforts, and I support such efforts, if 
there are not the basic conditions guaranteeing a minimum of 
success. There is a point at which the IMF must show its teeth. 
Then there are the statements made by Mr. Kozyrev, who is in 
fact a personal friend. When he speaks of Russia's near abroad 
it makes you pause for thought. If you then also take account 
of what is happening in Byelorussia, and the election results in 
Crimea, you see an accumulation of elements which could result 
in a more pronounced destabilization which would oblige us to 
speed up the move towards integration within NATO. 
  [LE SOIR] What could Europe's attitude be toward aid to 
Russia? 
  [Claes] We have adopted a very clear and expansive policy. A 
few days before leaving for Moscow on 11 November, we gave a 
mandate to the Commission, which was soon to lead to the signing 
of a partnership agreement providing very substantial aid and 
with the ultimate aim of creating a free trade area. It is not 
the Commission's fault that this agreement remains unsigned 
today. Like the IMF, the European Union must also demand that 
certain principles be included in the agreement, such as the 
respect for human rights and regulations prohibiting the policy 
of dumping. 
  [LE SOIR] The Americans are asking the Twelve to further 
open up their markets to the countries of Central Europe. Is it 
not true that at the same time as it proposes association 
agreements, the European Union is closing the door to these 
countries' principal exports? 
  [Claes] The European Union imports 80 times more from these 
countries than the United States does. It bears the largest 
share, virtually gigantic in fact, of aid for Central and 
Eastern Europe. The European Union and the Twelve together 
provide more than 70 percent of aid for these countries, Germany 
making by far the greatest effort. We don't therefore need 
lecturing. Admittedly, for economic reasons, combined with the 
very serious recession in the EU with more than 17 million 
unemployed, we are still obliged to protect some very sensitive 
sectors and products. Go and explain to the workers at Boel 
that we must open up our borders to iron and steel products from 
the East without any conditions and no antidumping guarantees. 
  [LE SOIR] Do you not fear that Germany will be tempted to 
play a more autonomous role in Central Europe? 
  [Claes] It is genuinely difficult for Germany to do right. 
Either it subscribes fully to a policy defined by the European 
Union and it is criticized for failing in its duty as a global 
economic power with respect to Central Europe, or it tries to do 
rather more and it is accused of drawing back from a commitment 
to Europe and carving out a role for itself as leader of 
Mitteleuropa. I myself have every faith in the intentions of 
German politicians, whether in government or in opposition. 
They are true Europeans who have understood that it is 
preferable, in order to avoid any risk of history repeating 
itself, to further integrate Germany in the construction of 
Europe. Also being pragmatists, they have understood that the 
challenges are so great that even a giant such as Germany is not 
able to confront them alone. 
<H5>  Zaire -- Putting the Agreement Into Practice </H5>
  [LE SOIR] Does the agreement that has just been concluded in 
Zaire mean that there has been a true reconciliation? 
  [Claes] Unfortunately, it is too early to reply in the 
affirmative. We have reached an agreement on the merger of the 
assemblies and on the principle of a government of 
reconciliation led by a member of the opposition. However, we 
have already had so many surprises. We must wait for this 
agreement to be put into practice. I hope that this will be 
done in the coming days or weeks. If the agreement stands up, 
the state of decay in which Zaire finds itself is such that an 
extraordinary effort will be needed from the international 
community to create the conditions needed just to get things off 
the ground in a country which is in the process of falling 
apart. The World Bank has just closed its office in Zaire and 
the IMF has issued a very clear warning. 
  [LE SOIR] Is it not a paradox that the international 
financial institutions are pulling out of the country at the 
very time when things are looking promising again? 
  [Claes] That shows the despair of these institutions and 
this 
country's lack of credibility. No one believes in miracles any 
more, even if we do need one. Having said that, these 
institutions will again be ready to cooperate in seeing that the 
agreement is implemented once some concrete evidence has been 
put on the table. What I am afraid of is that from the start we 
will get caught up in a vicious circle. The authorities in 
Zaire are going to demand aid to get the ball rolling again 
while the international bodies will firstly ask for proof of 
good will and that the agreements will be respected. Belgium 
will be called upon to play a leading role, together with Paris 
and Washington. We have not reached that stage yet, however. 
  [LE SOIR] For the time being, has there been any change in 
Belgium's attitude? 
  [Claes] No, none. 
  [LE SOIR] Were you surprised by the reports issued by the 
American State Department and Amnesty International on human 
rights infringements in Zaire? 
  [Claes] No. Belgium generally has reasonably reliable and 
authentic sources in Zaire. I find it rather hard to believe 
the figures that we have received in certain reports but we are 
not surprised by the actual facts of the matter. We have known 
for some time that the country is on a slippery slope from this 
point of view. That is why, in our declarations, we first 
talked of the rights of man even before we could speak of 
democracy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Netherlands Must Commit Troops To </F>
Eurocorps"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The Netherlands must make its troops 
available for a second Eurocorps, to work alongside the 
French-German Eurocorps. It must do this in order to play a 
more active role in European security policy and improved 
defense cooperation, said a working group from the Netherlands 
European Movement. 
  The Netherlands did not agree to participate in the 
French-German Eurocorps, but Minister Ter Beek did not rule out 
joint exercises. In the long term, the Defense Ministry will be 
appointed as an observer at the French-German Eurocorps. 
  The working group, which is led by the member of the 
European 
Parliament, CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] J. Penders, who 
released the report today, wants troops from the yet to be 
created German-Netherlands army corps and the already existing 
British-Netherlands amphibious force to be brought together into 
two new Eurocorps, which, in addition to their NATO duties, 
would form a European force. 
  In the second half of next year, the Netherlands will take 
over the presidency of the WEU, the Western European Union, 
which is a political and military cooperative association of 
nine European countries. According to the working group, that 
would be a good time to table proposals for a large European 
force, which would be the symbol of a more powerful European 
security policy and military cooperation. The troops should be 
at the disposal of the WEU, which, under the terms of the 
Maastricht Treaty on a common foreign and defense policy for the 
European Union, has the task of giving form to the new European 
security identity. 
  According to the working group, it has become easier to 
develop a European force now that the NATO summit agreed to its 
own European security effort, in which there is talk of 
individual but not of separate efforts. 
  The working group also devoted attention to the eastward 
enlargement of NATO and indicated that the accession of new 
members would be a long process. "In general it was 
acknowledged that the West can only have a marginal influence on 
the balance of power in Russia. Therefore, nobody can 
accurately say whether a policy of supporting President Yeltsin 
can be followed," says the report. The working group considers 
to contact countries of the former Soviet Union and the other 
members of the former Warsaw Pact.

<F P=106> [Richard Savill report from Belfast: "Major and Reynolds To </F>
Meet in London"] 
  [Text] Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish Prime 
Minister, will meet in London this month to redouble their 
efforts to achieve peace in Northern Ireland following the 
Downing Street declaration on the future of the province. 
  The meeting, the first between the two Prime Ministers since 
the signing of the declaration on Dec 15, will take place on the 
day they attend an England-lreland rugby international at 
Twickenham. 
  Senior sources in Dublin said the two Prime Ministers had 
been invited by the Rugby Football Union to attend the match on 
Feb 19. 
  It was likely they would hold a separate meeting either 
before or after the match to review progress in Northern Ireland. 
  Neither Prime Minister has set a deadline for Sinn Fein's 
acceptance of the declaration, but officials in London and 
Dublin are becoming increasingly irritated at the lack of a 
response from the Provisionals. 
  In a speech to his Fianna Fail party activists in Dublin, Mr 
Reynolds said that two months after the declaration was signed, 
it was time for a decision to enable everyone to take the first 
step in the peace process. 
  Mr Reynolds also voiced irritation with Sinn Fein's repeated 
calls for clarification from Britain alone. 
  He said: "I do not expect to encounter from people with a 
republican viewpoint the attitude that it is only the British 
Government and their clarification that counts. The role and 
influence of the Irish Government is central to the peace 
process." 
  ln an attempt to win back the initiative from Sinn Fein, the 
Irish government is expected to propose to Britain that 
all-party talks on the basis of the joint declaration should 
begin soon. 
  Mr Dick Spring, Irish Foreign Minister, has said his 
government favours negotiations involving London and Dublin, and 
the Constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, as long as they 
are anchored in the joint declaration. 
  He told Dublin's Sunday Press newspaper: "By talks we mean 
genuine negotiations which will build on what has been achieved 
in the declaration and will address all aspects of the problem 
and lead to a deep and lasting settlement."

  [Text] In an interview yesterday on Luxembourg Radio and 
Television, Simone Veil (UDF) [Union for French Democracy], 
minister of Social, Health, and Urban Affairs, said yesterday 
she felt "shame" and "utter powerlessness" as far as the war in 
Bosnia is concerned. She insisted that if it is decided to 
intervene in Bosnia, it is necessary to "make sure -- using 
threats if necessary -- that the Russians do not take action." 
With regard to the appropriateness of a military intervention, 
she noted that she was not a military expert, but that she 
listened to what was being said and trusted the decisions of her 
government. In this respect, she remarked that there is a real 
risk of remaining stuck in this part of the world, which was, 
she added, "the only region of Europe the Germans failed to 
subdue" during World War II. 
  As for her wish to see Prime Minister Edouard Balladur 
elected president of the republic, she indicated that all she 
had been saying was that she believed Mr. Balladur would make a 
good president, and not that he must run for office.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Nicolas Sarkozy, budget minister and </F>
official government spokesman, by Paul Amar -- live] 
  [Text] [Amar] Nicolas Sarkozy is with us in the studio. 
Mr. Sarkozy, we have just seen these reports from Sarajevo. 
What sadness and what a failure. 
  [Sarkozy] Yes, we no longer want to see these pictures. It 
is no longer a matter for words or speeches. As early as 
yesterday evening, speaking through Alain Juppe and Francois 
Leotard, the French Government called for two things, two very 
precise things. Everyone here in France and abroad must know 
that we will do everything to ensure that our demands are met. 
First of all we want the siege of Sarajevo to be lifted. In 
concrete terms, this means the besieging Serb forces must pull 
back 30 km so that they can no longer massacre the civilian 
population. Second, we demand that all heavy weaponry, both on 
the Serb and the Bosnian side, be placed under the control of 
the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. This is what we have 
demanded. If it does not happen [pauses]... France has 
indicated that if this is not done willingly, as part of a 
political agreement, then we would have to use all the means at 
our disposal, including air strikes. 
  What has to be quite clear is that military intervention is 
not an aim in itself. It would be meaningless to answer 
massacres with massacres. Military intervention serves to show 
that we want such a solution. France cannot decide on this 
alone, and this is why France has called for a meeting of the 
council of ministers of the North Atlantic Council, because it 
obviously has to be an international intervention. But believe 
me, the French position is without any hint of ambiguity, and it 
cannot be otherwise. 
  I would like to make one last point: Our public opinion has 
to know that of the 3,000 UNPROFOR troops bravely doing their 
job in Sarajevo, 75 percent are French.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe defended a strong 
French position in Brussels yesterday. He was supported, in 
particular, by Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy. 
  According to today's edition of LE FIGARO, three French Navy 
warships, including the aircraft carrier Foch, are to leave 
Toulon in the next few hours to join three other French warships 
already in the Adriatic. The aircraft aboard the Foch -- some 
20 Super Etendard -- would complement the Air Force elements 
made up of Mirage and Jaguar aircraft already based in Italy.

<F P=106> [Franz-Olivier Giesberg editorial: "A Crime and a Sin] </F>
  [Text] A little over half a century ago, when a crime 
against humanity was being perpetrated on an industrial scale, 
people felt that they had a right to say "we did not do anything 
because we did not know anything." Today, this excuse will not 
wash. Humankind knows all about Bosnia and still it does 
nothing. 
  When a mortar shell lands on a crowded Sarajevo market 
square, the whole world can witness its impact first-hand: 68 
dead and about 200 wounded, according to yesterday's body count. 
As [Paris Archbishop] Lustiger said, this is indeed "a crime 
against humanity." 
  Politicians the world over are on the same wavelength. Using 
the same words, they indignantly condemn this new act of 
savagery. These seasoned hypocrites even sometimes let 
themselves shed bitters tears before they start their aimless 
arm-waving. They should be forgiven for they do not know what 
they are saying any more. 
  See Bill Clinton; chin jutting, looking like he hopes that 
someone will hold his arm lest he starts thrashing about, the 
U.S. President has been envisaging the possibility of agreeing 
to NATO air strikes "once responsibilities have been assigned." 
In other words, he does not rule out retaliatory action. But 
these are tired words he has already uttered many times, as have 
all Western leaders, including the French. Is it any wonder 
that the Serb aggressor remains unimpressed? 
  Politicians should therefore agree to a moratorium. From now 
on, here and everywhere else, they -- with only a few exceptions 
-- should keep their mouth shut when it comes to the Bosnian 
tragedy, which they themselves prompted before abandoning its 
victims to their fate. 
  Consider the facts. First of all, when a Pandora's box of 
Serb, Croat, or Bosnian nationalisms opened on the ruins of the 
former Yugoslavia, their applause was deafening. Then, through 
fatalism, thoughtlessness, or demagogy, they encouraged ethnic 
fanaticisms of all stripes by giving birth to a Bosnia which had 
not been asking for such solicitude. Above all, they would not 
intervene before the conflict erupted, when -- in the spring of 
1991 -- such a conflict had become a definite possibility and 
sending a simple peacekeeping force to Bosnia was still a 
sufficient preventive measure. Even worse than a crime, this 
was a sin. 
  Therefore the only way for politicians to recover a measure 
of decency is to keep silent. Unless they stick to facts, like 
new U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who indicated yesterday that 
the 28,000 blue helmets currently in the former Yugoslavia "are 
surrounded by 200,000 war-ready fighters." Because they are not 
allowed to use their weapons, UN soldiers are not in a position 
to bring the war to a halt. In the field, the generals -- 
consequently punished by the United Nations -- had been saying 
nothing but that. One can therefore see the limits of 
humanitarian action: All it relieves is the conscience of its 
sponsors. 
  What are we to do, then? Stop blurting out empty threats. 
Make examples, for the sake of history. Send an ultimatum to 
the belligerents, provided we are ready to use force to 
implement its terms. Otherwise, there will be one more casualty 
in Sarajevo: our honor.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 7 (AFP) -- French anti-terrorism judge 
Jean-Louis Bruguiere has charged three people after completing 
his investigation into the murder of former Iranian prime 
Minister Shapur Bakhtiar, judicial sources said on Monday [7 
February]. 
  But Bruguiere found there was no case to answer against a 
45-year-old Iranian woman and an Iranian man, Saili Majid, who 
was sought under an international arrest warrant. 
  Bakhtiar and his secretary were shot and killed in the Paris 
suburb of Suresnes on August 6, 1991. 
  The next stage in the French judicial procedure is for the 
Paris appeal court to rule whether the case should be brought 
before an assize court. 
  On January 24, the public prosector reached the conclusion 
that the Iranian secret service provided logistical aid to the 
killers. 
  Bruguiere confirmed charges of murder and terrorist-related 
conspiracy against Iranian Ali Rad Vakili, who was arrested in 
Geneva and extradited to France. 
  Complicity charges against Iranian businessman Masud Hendi, 
45 and Zeynal Sarhadi, 26 were also confirmed. 
  Hendi is alleged to have helped two of the three alleged 
killers to enter France and Sarhadi, a secretary at the Iranian 
embassy in Bern, to have aided one of them to escape. Sarhadi 
was also extradited from Switzerland, causing a crisis in 
Swiss-Iranian relations. 
  Bruguiere confirmed six international arrest warrants in the 
case, two of them against the two other alleged killers, Mohamad 
Azadi and Farydoun Boyerahmadi. 
  According to Hendi, the assassination was ordered by Hossein 
Sheikhattar, an advisory to the Iranian telecommunications 
minister, judicial sources said.

  [Text] Russia and France have decided to step up defense 
cooperation by extending it, for the first time ever, to 
industrial arms production, according to the terms of two 
accords signed by the Russian and French Defense Ministers Pavel 
Grachev and Francois Leotard in Moscow on Friday [4 February]. 
The two countries concluded a specific industrial cooperation 
accord, the first ever of this type signed by Russia and a 
western European country. Two cooperative projects out of a 
total of 20 projects under consideration are already the subject 
of close negotiations. The first project involves the 
modernization (radar, avionics, engine) of old-generation MiG 
fighters which are not considered competitors of French aircraft 
intended for exportation. The project will be conducted by 
SAGEM [Company for General Electricity and Mechanics 
Applications] and Dassault Electronique and will focus on MiG 
21, 23, and 27 aircraft. 
  The second project involves the construction of a future 
training aircraft for the Russians, who are currently using 
Czech aircraft for this purpose. The future aircraft will be 
named MiG AT (Advanced Trainer). Its frame will be built by the 
Russian Mikoyan [name as published] company, while the version 
destined for the Russian Air Force will be equipped with a 
Larzac engine manufactured by SNECMA [National Company for 
Aircraft Engine Studies and Construction] which is currently 
used on the French Alphajet. In addition, the export version of 
the training aircraft -- which is expected to open new markets 
for French companies -- will be equipped with an avionics 
system made by Sextant Avionique.

  [Text] Copenhagen, Feb 8 (AFP) -- Forty-four percent of 
Danes said they opposed the idea of NATO air strikes in former 
Yugoslavia, while 39 percent supported them and 17 percent had 
no opinion, according to a Gallup poll published Tuesday [8 
February]. 
  The survey, which appeared in the BERLINGSKE TIDENDE daily, 
was made between January 17 and 20 -- before last week's mortar 
attacks that killed civilians in Sarajevo's marketplace and in 
its suburb of Dobrinja -- among more than 1,000 residents. 
  It also showed that 57 percent of Danes want Danish UN 
peacekeepers sent home if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) starts bombing operations in Bosnia. 
  Another 34 percent felt the soldiers should remain. 
  A majority 59 percent supported Danish participation in 
United Nations peacekeeping operations around the world, while 
32 percent opposed this and nine percent had no opinion. 
  In all 54 percent felt it right that Denmark had sent 
soldiers to former Yugoslavia, while 40 percent felt the 
opposite.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Minister of Finance Anne Wibble by </F>
Ewa Stenberg; place and date not given: "Journey to Better Times 
Fraught With Danger"] 
  [Text] It would be harmful to cut government spending 
more than the government has proposed, says Minister of Finance 
Anne Wibble, defending herself following Monday's [10 January] 
criticism by the Social Democrats, New Democracy, and the 
business community that the budget deficit is not being reduced 
fast enough. 
  "I am the first to draw attention to the seriousness of the 
state's financial situation, but I don't think it would become 
less serious if we drained the economy completely. What we need 
to do is try to achieve a balanced recovery. We must not create 
additional unemployment unnecessarily, which costs a lot of 
money," Wibble told DAGENS NYHETER. 
  For her big day, the minister of finance wore clothes she 
had 
received as Christmas presents -- cerise blouse, brightly 
colored scarf, and black dress -- in order to deliver a matching 
message: The economy is improving, and Sweden is on the way to 
lifting itself out of the crisis, but extremely high 
unemployment and a big budget deficit are still with us and 
causing the journey to better times to be fraught with danger. 
<H5>  Better Times </H5>
  When Wibble's cheerful message about better times reached 
economists and political opponents, they immediately countered 
it with demands that the government do more in those improved 
times to reduce the budget deficit. 
  But the minister of finance hit back: 
  [Wibble] Stability and confidence in the economic policy are 
increased if the reorganization program is carried out more or 
less according to plan. If we begin grousing too much about what 
the Riksdag has decided, the result will be confusion about what 
is happening. To reduce unemployment we need new jobs, and that 
depends to an extremely high degree on business investments. And 
if there is anything that companies do not like, it is political 
shilly-shallying. In such cases, they do not bother to invest. 
  We do not want to tighten up on the economy just for the fun 
of it, of course; we are tightening up only as much as necessary 
to achieve the goals we have chosen. Economizing does not have 
any intrinsic value. 
  [Stenberg] Isn't there intrinsic value in reducing the 
deficit to a minimum? 
  [Wibble] The budget deficit will decline by 45 billion 
kronor 
between this fiscal year and the next, and that is more than 
most people expected. 
  There are a great many people during a certain period who 
only talk about unemployment being too high and who want to see 
incentives. Then in another situation, it becomes the fashion to 
say that a few more billion kronor must be saved. As minister of 
finance, I must see to it that both things happen at the same 
time. 
<H5>  In Four Years </H5>
  [Stenberg] She emphasizes, however, that she considers it 
conceivable that the program already adopted for strengthening 
state finances by a total of 81 billion kronor can be carried 
out faster than planned -- perhaps in four years rather than 
five. 
  [Wibble] And if the economy goes better than we expected, we 
will be able to save more in the next fiscal year than the plan 
calls for. 
  [Stenberg] Can it be said that the government has the 
economy 
under control when total unemployment is expected to hit 14 
percent this year, and the state will have to borrow 220 billion 
kronor next year to cover expenditures? 
  [Wibble] Our entire policy is aimed at reducing the 
imbalances. We are trying to create more new real jobs and 
gradually whittle away at the reorganization plan as adopted by 
the Riksdag for reducing the budget deficit. We have the 
national debt and the budget deficit under control. 
  [Stenberg] Why will 14 percent of the Swedes who are willing 
and able to work remain outside the ordinary labor market during 
a boom period such as you expect in 1995? 
  [Wibble] Creating more jobs is a slow process. To employ 
more 
people, one must have confidence in the future. That confidence 
is growing now. So people are deciding to expand their 
activities. They will raise money for investment, buy machinery 
or companies, and take care of a number of practical matters. 
Only then will they begin to hire people. For practical reasons, 
it does not happen overnight. 
<H5>  Has Done Everything </H5>
  [Wibble continues] The government has done everything in its 
power to limit unemployment. 
  It is possible that we could have added a few hundred jobs 
in 
some labor market program, although it would have been 
difficult, but the result would not have been any new real jobs. 
  [Stenberg] How does it happen that despite the gigantic 
budget deficit, the government can afford new expenditures? 
  [Wibble] We have different values than the Social Democrats 
do when it comes to what the important priorities are. That is 
why we are choosing to increase certain expenditures while 
reducing others. The important thing is that we should meet the 
requirements of the reorganization plan, and we are doing so. 
  [Stenberg] Wibble is quite convinced that the Riksdag will 
support the proposals in the budget. 
  [Wibble] The opposition has criticized us for not saving 
enough. So they surely ought to support the savings that exist. 
Remember that all the opposition parties will have to stand 
together if they are going to defeat the proposals.

<F P=106> [Article by Kaa Eneberg: "Tough Confrontation on </F>
Unemployment"] 
  [Text] The government expects more horse trading with 
New Democracy this spring over introduction of the child care 
allowance and unemployment insurance. 
  Social Democrat Goran Persson said the government 
should show some humility and promised that there would be a 
traditional Social Democratic budget as an alternative when the 
budget is submitted to the Riksdag. 
  The government can expect a tough confrontation with the 
Social Democrats, especially on the subject of the high 
unemployment rate, which the government is considered to have 
accepted all too casually. Specific proposals regarding measures 
for creating jobs will be the main item in the SDP's [Social 
Democratic Party] financial bill two weeks from now. 
  Minister of Finance Anne Wibble (Liberal Party) promised 
during the Riksdag debate that she would be interested in 
studying any of the SDP's proposals, saying she hoped it would 
not take a full four months to present them, as she said it did 
when Allan Larsson was the party's financial spokesman last 
year. She did not feel, however, that economic spokesman Goran 
Persson's talk about the SDP's usual solutions for creating jobs 
and faster growth inspired any hope. 
<H5>  Irresponsible Expenditure </H5>
  SDP leader Ingvar Carlsson said at a news conference that it 
ought to be possible to convert the many billions of kronor that 
a 14-percent unemployment rate will cost into jobs. He also said 
that his party opposed the child care allowance, which he called 
an irresponsible expenditure of from 2 billion to 6 billion 
kronor whose only purpose was to hold the four-party coalition 
together. 
  "Typically, they are choosing to cut back on the allowance 
for more than one child to make room for the child care 
allowance dictated by the KDS [Christian Democratic Party]," 
said Carlsson. He pointed out that the government's policy was 
characterized excessively by special party-political interests. 
  "The Center Party is demanding subsidies for the farmers, 
the 
KDS is demanding the child care allowance, and the Moderates are 
insisting not only on tax relief for stockholders but also on 
more money for the police and correctional treatment," said the 
SDP leader, who avoided drawing attention to the Liberal Party's 
special interests. 
  The various areas in which the SDP wants to save money were 
not revealed on Monday [10 January], which was reserved for 
attacks on the government's policy. But Carlsson mentioned the 
Armed Forces as one area where the Social Democrats think it is 
possible to achieve savings. 
<H5>  Foothold </H5>
  The SDP's spokesman on economic affairs, Goran Persson, 
called the Bildt government's economic policy the biggest 
political failure of the postwar period because mass 
unemployment has gotten a foothold in Sweden. He rejected as 
pure falsification the government's promise to cut unemployment 
in half by the turn of the century. 
  At the same time that he accused the government of cutting 
back the budget too drastically -- higher taxes, cutbacks in the 
construction industry, and selective purchase taxes -- he 
complained that the government had been unable to come up with 
any new proposals for savings that would reduce the budget 
deficit. 
  Persson feels that Anne Wibble ought to show more humility 
now that she has the "answer sheet" regarding economic policy in 
her hand. Besides record unemployment and the continuing high 
budget deficit, he also criticized the fact that at 13.5 percent 
of GNP, the investment level is now at "the 1930's level." That 
puts Sweden in last place among the industrialized countries. 
<H5>  Wider Gaps </H5>
  Johann Lonnroth of the Left Party criticized the government 
for widening the gaps in society with its tax reductions for the 
rich. He proposed a 5-percent tax hike for all upper incomes. He 
also brought up his party's old proposal to introduce a six-hour 
workday to bring unemployment down. 
  He tried to get Goran Persson to say where he stood on his 
relations with the Liberal Party, but had to be content with 
reminding him that "you need us to tear up the tax on stock 
shares and in connection with the labor law." 
  Lonnroth also called for radical new thinking aimed at 
creating new jobs in such areas as environment and education. 
Anne Wibble delightedly drew attention to the budget's unique 
appendix on the environment, but he dismissed it as being as 
good as worthless since it made no proposals and provided no 
funds.

  New Democracy's Ian Wachtmeister insisted that he would be 
able to accept the child care allowance bill that the government 
is going to submit in February only if it is paid for out of the 
budget for family policy. He described the government's proposal 
to reduce the extra allowance for more than one child as a move 
by the government to placate New Democracy. 
  That opened up the possibility of more cutbacks in family 
policy. The 82 billion kronor that family policy is already 
costing can be reduced even further, he said. He spontaneously 
mentioned time off to care for sick children. 
<H5>  Certain Conditions </H5>
  New Democracy is also placing certain conditions on its 
acceptance of the unemployment insurance proposal that will be 
presented in March. Wachtmeister thinks it will be possible to 
influence the deadline for terminating unemployment benefits. 
  Wachtmeister also wants to include in discussions with the 
government the question of a general basic security system so 
that the cost of the entire social security system can be met in 
the future. He outlined a tax-supported basic security system 
paying the same as the cash labor market assistance benefit, 
which the party has gotten increased to 245 kronor per day. 
Anything over that amount would be paid for by individual 
contributions. 
  New Democracy said, however, that increasing the subsidy by 
400 million kronor was "ridiculous," and it feels that cutting 
aid to developing countries in half would be more appropriate. 
  New Democracy's financial bill will also call for cutbacks 
in 
refugee policy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Is Waiting This Fall"] </F>
  [Text] This year's budget bill is a meager one. Despite 
that, it is opening a new chapter in the economic debate. The 
question from now on is not how we will overcome an economic 
depression but how we will manage and take advantage of an 
upswing. 
  Even Hans Tson Soderstrom, the most pessimistic of all 
economists in 1993, stated on Monday [10 January] that he no 
longer feared a self-reinforcing economic depression in Sweden. 
"It is quite obvious that we are not following the Finnish 
pattern." 
  The 1990 tax reform put money in people's hands, enabling 
them to pay down their excessive debts from the 1980's 
considerably faster than the Finns could. As a result, domestic 
demand is now going to rise again at the same time that the 
volume of exports is soaring. 
  How can the forces of inflation be kept in check until 
1995-96 so that Sweden's economic recovery will last? That ought 
to be the main question when this spring's economic judgments 
and decisions are being made. Uncertainties should be removed to 
the extent possible so that companies will venture to expand 
their capacity in plenty of time. The main thing here is a quick 
yes vote in the referendum on Swedish membership in the European 
Union. The Riksdag and the government must also show that they 
are able to get state finances under control. In that respect, 
Minister of Finance Wibble's third budget is inadequate. It is 
an election year budget, not because of what it proposes but 
because of what it omits. 
  It is true that the state is expected to borrow less in the 
coming fiscal year than it did in this one (220 billion kronor 
compared to 270 billion). Bank subsidies, lagging payments to 
the municipalities, and so on will disappear. But the national 
debt will continue to climb at a terrifying rate. It passed 1 
trillion kronor in the fall of 1993. It will pass 1.5 trillion 
kronor in the fall of 1995, at which time it will equal 100 
percent of our total gross national product. 
  Experience in the few Western countries that have gone even 
higher than that -- Belgium, for example -- shows that the state 
will lose all room to maneuver. If drastic steps are not taken, 
fear of inflation will increase, and interest rates will rise 
along with it. External borrowing by the state will increase the 
money supply. Domestic borrowing will increase the competition 
for loans with businesses that are investing again. So the 
upswing will be brief, whereas what we need is lasting growth to 
bring down unemployment. 
  The government is pleased overall with what it has already 
done during this term of office. The additional savings being 
proposed in the budget are marginal: slightly less unreasonable 
child allowance levels for families with five or more children, 
a maximum price of 25 kronor instead of 10 kronor for medicines 
beyond the first one on a prescription, a few hundred kronor per 
year in individual contributions to dental insurance, and a 
slight restriction on home-language instruction. 
  The opposition is continuing to talk about incentives 
instead 
of savings, although Ingvar Carlsson has now hinted that a lower 
VAT [value-added tax] and an end to inflation goals may not be 
the right medicine as we approach an industrial boom. 
  It is true that employment must increase, for one thing just 
to get public finances back in balance. But this does not apply 
to tax-supported employment. According to the preliminary 
national budget, the upswing in industrial production will have 
a bigger indirect effect on private services dependent upon 
industry than was previously thought. It is estimated that the 
number of people gainfully employed in industry and private 
services will increase by 105,000 during 1994 and 1995. A 
continuation of that trend needs to be ensured at the same time 
that the drop in construction is halted, employment obstacles 
and beginning wages for young people are reduced, and new 
supplementary means of financing social services are developed. 
The amount of the ATP [general supplementary pension] cash 
benefit needs to be reduced and the resulting margin used to 
introduce long-term health care insurance. 
  But neither a hastily suggested government goal of 4-percent 
economic growth nor vague opposition nonsense about jobs is any 
help. The important thing is to get into a permanent pattern of 
good cycles. This means that the probable boom from 1994 to 1996 
must be taken advantage of to make active decisions for keeping 
the national debt from increasing in relation to GNP. 
  Four government veterans -- from the Social Democratic, 
Moderate, Liberal, and Center Parties -- recently told VECKANS 
AFFARER the kinds of steps that need to be taken: reduce 
illness, unemployment, and parents' benefits to 70 percent of 
their present levels, abolish the allowance for the first child 
(the state's cash subsidy to families with children has risen 
steadily since 1985 from 19.8 billion to 48.7 billion kronor), 
cut back on road and railroad investments, and reduce housing 
subsidies. In addition, unemployment insurance, which still has 
a deficit of 34 billion kronor, will have to paid for through 
higher individual contributions, as will the pension system. 
  It is to be hoped that Anne Wibble and Goran Persson both 
know what is waiting this fall. But by this spring, the 
government will need to come up with at least a new long-range 
estimate regarding a realistic course of action for restoring 
public finances. That is something that is entirely lacking in 
the unfinished budget.

<F P=106> [Article by Dick Ljungberg: "Debt Will Soon Total 2 Trillion </F>
Kronor"] 
  [Text] A galloping national debt and permanently high 
unemployment are the two big threats to Anne Wibble's budget. If 
state finances are not in order, there will be no halving of 
unemployment or stability in the social security system, the 
government's two primary goals. 
  It is true that the minister of finance is making quite a 
fuss over the fact that the budget deficit and the state's total 
borrowing requirement will decline in 1994-95 compared to the 
current fiscal year (see the table), but not until around the 
end of the century will it be possible to have the state's 
finances in reasonably good order. 
  In the meantime, the national debt is going to rise at an 
alarming rate. Last year our public debt passed the 
inconceivable figure of 1 trillion kronor. By the end of this 
fiscal year -- that is, in June of this year -- the debt is 
expected to total just over 1.2 trillion kronor, and in June 
1995 it will be up to 1.435 trillion kronor. That is 94.5 
percent of the gross national product (GNP), meaning all the 
goods and services we produce in Sweden in one year! 
<H5>  Prodigious Amount </H5>
  Calculations show that the national debt may reach 2 
trillion 
kronor by the end of the 1997-98 fiscal year, that being the 
final year of the government's five-year reorganization plan for 
state finances. 
  The debt would then total 109 percent of GNP, a level 
achieved in the Western World only by Belgium, Greece, and Italy. 
  With a debt and interest burden that high, a country can 
scarcely afford to pursue a stabilization policy, and Sweden 
might wind up in that situation in a future recession if the 
national debt is not stabilized -- in other words, unless the 
debt ceases to grow faster than GNP. 
  Debt service on the national debt is going to cost a full 85 
billion kronor over the next fiscal year, and that is about as 
much as the state pays out to the sick, the handicapped, and 
pensioners. 
  Anne Wibble's five-year reorganization program strengthens 
the budget by 81 billion kronor, and she claims that the goal 
for the first year has been more than achieved. But the improved 
budget figures are due mainly to the beginnings of an economic 
upswing, one effect of which is an increase in tax revenues for 
the state and a gradual decline in the cost of unemployment as 
well. 
<H5>  Not Content </H5>
  The minister of finance expects to stay within the projected 
81 billion kronor in budget improvements until 1997-98, 
something that the Riksdag has already approved. But the 
measures involved may be adopted earlier. 
  On that subject, Wibble sets forth a line of reasoning in 
the 
budget statement. 
  If things go so well that economic conditions and public 
savings improve faster than expected, we should be not be 
content with that, she warns. 
  If anything, such a development would be an argument in 
favor 
of speeding up the reorganization of state finances, because 
then we would have a chance of lengthening the period of good 
growth and reducing the risk of overheating and bottlenecks in 
the future. 
  If, on the other hand, the economic recovery turns out to be 
weaker and shorter than predicted when the reorganization 
program was launched in 1993, the program must still be carried 
out, Wibble emphasizes. 
  Otherwise, the public deficit might go down more slowly or, 
in the worst of cases, continue to rise -- because of high 
interest rates, for example. 
  Even under those circumstances, considering the large 
deficit 
we began with, the 81 billion kronor called for in the 
reorganization program should be regarded as a minimum program, 
the minister of finance says. 
  In the spirit of the Lindbeck Commission, she also 
emphasizes 
the importance of the institutions in this connection. A longer 
term of office beginning with this fall's elections -- from 
three to four years -- combined with new rules for the Riksdag's 
budget process, can increase the credibility of long-term 
measures.

  One result of that agency's reorganization was to make

  The National Road Administration is selling off its surplus, 
but there is no demand for some of its older equipment. But 
there is a serious lack of that kind of equipment in the Baltic 
states. The government therefore considers it reasonable that 
the National Road Administration should send its unsalable older 
equipment over there.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Anyone Will Give In"] </F>
  [Text] The dark shadow in map square number 3664 reminds 
one of a gigantic, mutilated insect. One of the trapeze-like 
wings had broken off, the nose was missing, and in the dull gray 
water of Lake Constance even a diving robot of the "Sear Rover" 
type could send only diffuse video pictures from 159 meters 
below the surface of the lake. 
  A two-engine Cessna 425 plane, license number D-IEFW, lay on 
its back like a helpless beetle. The plane had taken off from 
Prague shortly after 1800 on the Monday before last [24 January] 
and had crashed into Lake Constance during a failed landing 
approach to the Swiss airport of Altenrhein in St. Gallen Canton. 
  In the plane there were professional pilot Rudolf Wirschen, 
44, Berlin merchant and hobby flier Josef Rimmele, 54, his 
partner Klaus Eichler, 53, as well as Czech citizens Iveta 
Ranetova, 30, and Alena Petrusova, 39. Rimmele's loyal terrier 
Asta, 8, was also aboard. 
  Lake Constance hides various mysteries. Occasionally, 
defective small planes, helicopters, or boats sink, their cargo 
disappearing in the far reaches of the lake. The largest German 
inland lake has had to swallow a lot, particularly dirt and 
poison: Year after year, 21,000 tonnes of nitrates, 2,300 
tonnes of phosphor, and 800 tonnes of other pollutants, such as 
lead and zinc, mingle in the water between three countries 
[Austria, Germany, and Switzerland]. 
  However, what was assumed to lie at the bottom of the lake 
last week seemed to be far more dangerous: a sinister threat 
that one could not smell, see, or taste. 
  Reportedly, the Cessna carried at least 70 kg of highly 
radioactive material called cesium 137. And BILD knew early 
that Rimmele and Eichler were the "nuclear traders of the 
Russian Mafia." 
  A clear case: Europe's largest drinking water reservoir, 
which supplies water to about 4 million people every day, from 
St. Gallen in Switzerland to far behind Stuttgart, seemed to be 
in danger. Disaster relief experts worked out emergency plans 
for the worst possible accident. 
  When the German research submarine "Iago" began rescuing the 
Cessna last Friday afternoon, it had long been determined that 
the highly poisonous cargo could not have been aboard. In order 
to shield 70 kg of radioactive cesium 137, which is a by-product 
of nuclear fission and is used in measurement and control 
engineering, one needs a lead casing that would weigh four 
tonnes. The Cessna would not have been able to take off in the 
first place. 
  The mysterious events playing against the scenery of Lake 
Constance are an example of contemporary hysteria. They show 
how uncertain policemen, politicians, and media are because of a 
new variety of crime: Since the fall of the Wall, poisonous 
substances and radioactive material from the arsenals of the 
former East Bloc are being offered on a worldwide, bizarre 
fleamarket of death. And the danger that emanates from vagrant 
nuclear material has meanwhile become real. 
  The Federal Office of Criminal Investigations (BKA) in 
Wiesbaden and the Federal Intelligence Office (BND) in Pullach 
are warning against the new threat that comes from the East. In 
an alarming 18-page report to the Chancellor's Office ("Nuclear 
Black Market/Nuclear Terrorism") at the beginning of January, 
the BND noticed a "trend toward an escalation of the situation," 
which "gives" everyone "reason for concern." 
  For the first time, "the threshold to high enrichment" has 
been "crossed" with stolen uranium material. A "friendly 
intelligence service" received a sample of material with a 
"degree of enrichment of slightly less than 40 percent." This 
is a step forward on the path toward a nuclear bomb, which needs 
either plutonium or highly enriched uranium 235 as fissionable 
material. 
  It is also alarming that, for the fist time, it is not only 
dictators, but possibly also "two extreme Islamic fundamentalist 
associations" that are trying to obtain access to technical 
knowledge about nuclear matters. In addition, the confidential 
BND paper notes that there are "credible intelligence service 
findings" that, in the East, "individual high-ranking officials 
from ministries, embassies, industrial enterprises, and research 
facilities" are involved in the dubious nuclear deals. All this 
means crossing a "threshold of danger." 
  BKA experts and intelligence service officials can imagine 
that further developed nuclear specialities or frightening 
biological weapons could get into the hands of Western gangs -- 
a completely new field for blackmailers. "If this happens," BKA 
chief Hans-Ludwig Zachert predicts, "any community will give in." 
  At the beginning of last year, the Bavarian Land Office of 
Criminal Investigations alarmed the authorities with a report 
that a gang of nuclear smugglers had considered blackmail with 
fissionable material. However, it remained just a plan. 
  In November, a madman threatened that he would destroy the 
inner cities of Frankfurt, Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich with 
thermonuclear warheads. He demanded 100 million marks [DM] from 
the Munich State Lottery Administration. 
  Also, in November, the threatening letter of a "Bosnian 
Indignation Front" turned up, according to BND findings. The 
hitherto unknown organization wanted to detonate nuclear 
warheads in four European capital cities, if its political 
demands for the benefit of Bosnia were not fulfilled. 
  For the time being, the intelligence services still react 
with relative composure to such threats. According to current 
knowledge, it can still be ruled out "that nuclear warheads are 
indeed available in an uncontrolled manner," the BND report says. 
  However, the composure might soon shatter. Individual terror 
already is one of the achievements of the nuclear age. Not only 
Western intelligence service officials seem to consider the 
terrible end of Vladimir Kaplun, 63, as a model case. The 
manager of a Moscow packaging company died horribly in great 
pain: Opponents had put a source of radiation in his chair. 
  In the crumbled Soviet empire, where nuclear material "of 
all kinds, at least from civilian institutions" (BND) is 
available as easily as a handgun in St. Pauli [Hamburg], things 
like that are happening more often now. 
  In Irkutsk, Siberia, a saboteur wanted to kill two company 
heads with the same method. The gentlemen noticed in time that 
they felt bad, and survived. A potential killer of his 
mother-in-law -- also in Siberia -- hid the radioactive 
substance in the basement. This did not work. 
  Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer, 45, was also 
supplied with radioactive material. After 6 December, the 
Greens politician received a nuclear pill made of uranium 235 in 
a letter. The anonymous letter accompanying it said: "Mr. 
Fischer, check the Hanau nuclear companies.... Be careful, 
radioactive." 
  Since in CIS trade everything can be had that was kept under 
lock and key by the state in the past, a wave of radioactive 
material is coming to the West, at "extremely excessive prices," 
the BND says. 
  Germany is the turntable of the new nuclear smuggling. 
"Germany's economic prosperity," Peter Kroemer of the BKA says, 
"has a particular power of attraction." 
  In 1990 the BKA registered four offenses of this kind, in 
1991 there were already 41, in 1992 they numbered 158, and last 
year there were about 200 cases. During a visit to neighboring 
Poland, which often serves the dealers as a transit and storage 
site, Kroemer told the Senate Human Rights Committee about the 
most popular products on Germany's merchant scene. 
  The list ranged from plutonium to uranium 235, cesium 137, 
and cobalt 60 to strontium 90. The radioactive substances, in 
particular strontium and cesium, are considered to be dangerous 
because they cause cancer. The sellers boast that they can lay 
their hands on any material. 
  Smuggling is booming. How hotly the market is contested is 
shown by 108 incidents all over the world, which the BND has put 
together in "event lists" for the past two years. 
  Armed, uniformed men stole radioactive material from the 
Geophysics Institute in Tbilisi, Georgia. During a routine 
check in Murmansk, Russia, last November, it was noticed that 
nuclear fuel had been stolen from a storage facility for nuclear 
submarines. A total of 200 kg of uranium disappeared from a 
nuclear power plant in Lithuania. Even in Vietnam, 3 kg of 
plutonium were allegedly offered for sale. A network of dubious 
nuclear-trading companies is developing. 
  The investigators are often helpless, because legal and 
illegal practices are inseparably interlaced in these deals. 
Ice-cold defaulters, bulls, and speculators are hunting for 
rare and allegedly highly profitable metals, such as scandium or 
osmium 187 from the former East Bloc states. 
  All of them are mysterious substances. Not even experts know 
what scandium is supposed to be used for. Osmium 187 is to be 
used not only for refining the surface of fountain pens, but 
also as a hard-metal material. 
  No matter what, prices are high. About $70 million is 
charged for 1 kg of osmium 187, scandium can already be had at 
$50,000 per kilo. 
  For a long time, the experts of BKA and BND have wondered 
about the actual point of the strange deals. Finally, they 
arrived at the most obvious conclusion: greed and simple fraud. 
In some cases they also think that the motive is money 
laundering -- pretended deals are a popular method of legalizing 
illegal money. German and Russian security authorities have 
been watching this strange poker game for three years. 
Following the principle of a chain letter, new clients are 
sought out and there is no lack of participants right from the 
beginning. 
  "The criminal energy is great, the circle of participants is 
becoming increasingly confusing," says Vadim Raistein, 37, head 
of the foreign trade department of an analysis center in Moscow, 
which is located next door to the Nuclear Energy Ministry. 
  According to Raistein, the institute has had "a lot of bad 
experiences with German dealers," who send "the strangest 
offers." The senders are renowned lawyers in Munich, Hamburg, or 
Duesseldorf. 
  Seized exhibits of nuclear fraud are accumulating in the 
cupboards of the institute. Says Raistein: "Sometimes the 
material is really radioactive, but virtually always it is 
completely worthless." A total of 99 percent of the examined 
offers are "pure nonsense." 
  Everybody cheats everybody else. Raistein knows several 
directors of formerly state institutes and nuclear factories, 
who sign delivery contracts for nonexistent goods and draw up 
forged expert reports: "They are tempted by the big money." 
  Even government members have signed papers for export 
without 
checking them. Raistein: "They are happy about every single 
company that is able to fend for itself." 
  Western service can often only speculate who is behind the 
trade in the radioactive materials. Of the roughly 300 suspects 
who have attracted attention in Germany, about half come from 
East European countries -- mainly Polish and Russian. According 
to the findings of the BND, the centers of the illegal nuclear 
activities are Vilnius and Kaunas in Lithuania. 
  The German accomplices mostly turn out to be rather 
sinister multitalents. Most of them have attracted attention by 
fraud or illegal arms deals in the past. Some of them worked 
for the now-bankrupt Listen-and-Look company, that is, the East 
Berlin Ministry of State Security. 
  The dead merchants in Lake Constance were obviously small 
fry. Rimmele and Eichler were two figures in a milieu in which 
the use of a charter plane also helps to compensate for a bad 
reputation. 
  In the small Noribau company in Berlin they dealt with real 
estate, but they always dreamed of the big coup. Contact with a 
former colonel of the People's Police was supposed to provide 
the initial impetus. Klaus-Peter Nedwig, 48, son of Lieutenant 
General Helmut Nedwig, former head of the GDR [German Democratic 
Republic] criminal police, was Rimmele's great hope. 
  Last autumn, Nedwig, who failed as an insurance agent in the 
past, telephoned old colleagues from the criminal police and 
told them to come to Edisonstrasse 63 in Berlin. One of the 
participants remembers that Rimmele was the one who did the 
talking there. One could "make a lot of money" with rare 
metals, but the business had to be "done on a large scale." 
  Rimmele announced that he would bring rare metals and other 
substances to the bonded warehouse of Zurich Kloten Airport by 
private plane. Now one has to work big, Rimmel said; 
double-digit million sums were allegedly involved. 
  However, the nuclear chandlers probably had the wrong sense 
of scale. Until the alleged big coup they had mostly dealt with 
small amounts and usually lost: Here a few business contacts 
with merchants from China, there a deceptive hope for a cesium 
deal in the Baltic states. That involved only the harmless 
cesium 133 isotope, which does not emit radiation. 
  Their partner in Switzerland was also such a loser. Juerg 
Jacomet, arms dealer and former informer of the Swiss Military 
Intelligence Service, used to meet ex-agents of the KGB or the 
Stasi in the Poestli restaurant in Rumlang near Zurich and 
dreamed of golden times. At the moment he is reportedly 
involved in arms deals in Zagreb -- fleeing from the Swiss 
federal police. 
  Eichler, who was a limited partner of Noribau, is remembered 
by Uwe Kranz, head of the Thuringian Land Office of Criminal 
Investigations, as a "negligible figure." In a hotel in Erfurt 
he once wanted to conclude an osmium deal with some boisterous 
Hungarian fellows, but that did not work out. The BKA took over 
the case. 
  Berlin merchants Rimmele and Eichler spent their last day as 
they spent their lives -- boasting and unsuccessful. Before 
they were permitted to charter the Cessna, Martin Ewers, 29, 
manager of the "Aerowest Braunschweig" company, demanded that 
Rimmele pay about DM30,000, which had to be paid right at Prague 
Airport. 
  Rimmele paid by Eurocard. The final destination was a Paris 
laboratory with measuring instruments for rare substances. 
During a stopover at Altenrhein Airport, 5 km from the site of 
the accident, a client was waiting, who was interested in the 
miraculous Red Mercury. 
  When the plane did not come, the client, a man from Vaduz, 
Liechtenstein, quickly disappeared. Better safe than sorry.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nonsense and Balderdash"] </F>
  [Text] The miraculous substance is supposed to increase the 
capacity of missiles, make projectiles invisible to any radar 
equipment, and even be used in the construction of mininuclear 
bombs. 
  Merchants Josef Rimmele and Klaus Eichler, who were probably 
killed when a chartered Cessna plane mysteriously crashed into 
Lake Constance the week before last, reportedly also dealt in 
this substance. Dealers in radioactive material offer the 
substance under many names: Red Mercury, Mercury P2-P5, Mercury 
Rouge, Red Wine, Red Quicksilver, RM20/20, or Red Cherry. 
  According to findings by the Federal Intelligence Office 
(BND) itinerant dealers have been offering the stuff since 1980. 
One can "only speculate" about the origin of the Mercury 
legend, a confidential report from January says. What is 
certain are the prices demanded on the black market: "$200,000 
to $400,000 per kilo," the BND in Pullach has found out. 
  Last year, the material was presented to an audience of 
millions. The ARD [First German Television Channel] 
"Tagesthemen" newscast reported that the dangerous substance is 
produced in a research institute of the Russian military and 
then offered all over the world for the construction of 
detonators in nuclear warheads. 
  Experts laughed heartily. "Red Mercury is nonsense, 
balderdash," Paul Wamers, vice president of the Cologne Customs 
Office of Criminal Investigations, says, succinctly summarizing 
the opinion of the experts. 
  The BND investigators in their expert report are also sure: 
"A material with such qualities does not exist. The 
mercury-antimony compound, which is again and again mentioned in 
the media and is a brownish material, does not show any of the 
spectacular qualities and would not justify the extremely high 
price that is demanded. In the cases that were examined more 
closely, the seized material was, for example, simple mercury or 
mercury oxide. However, one case has become known in which 
mercury was mixed with the dangerous radioactive material cobalt 
60 -- probably to simulate the alleged radioactivity of Red 
Mercury." 
  Theophil M. Lutz, scientist and owner of a company for 
chemical analyses in Morges at the Lake of Geneva, sees 
connections. He assumes that officers of the former Soviet 
intelligence service KGB are behind the mercury boom. The 
intelligence agents are operating with a fictitious material, 
which is not rare in this scene. 
  Dutch merchant Adriana Gilhar, 42, has come to the same 
conclusion. The born Romanian participated in the game, which 
involved millions of dollars, for two years without ever being 
able to conclude a real deal. She experienced "scenes as in a 
movie": Somewhere in the heart of Russia "policemen, who were 
armed to their teeth" guarded a box with 2 kg of "this damned 
substance." 
  Adriana Gilhar calls this succinctly and vulgarly 
"bullshit." 
Obviously, the local governors of the former KGB had staged the 
martial performance of the policemen in order to impress 
supposedly rich buyers from the West. The experiences of the 
Dutch woman coincide with findings by German authorities. 
  The BND has "intelligence service information" that Russian 
politicians and high-ranking government officials might also be 
involved in the black-market deals. 
  Thus, in 1992, Russian dealers presented their German 
partners with a license that, according to the stamp and 
signature, came from the office of the prime minister of the 
Republic of Moldova: A domestic company was permitted to export 
"1,000 kg" of the imaginary chemical Red Mercury. 
  Cornelius Vermulen, who for a long time was Adriana Gilhar's 
Dutch business partner, also received this offer. Nervously, he 
pushes two samples of Red Mercury across the table to show them 
to his visitors: "Take a look, rubbish." 
  Such frankness is dangerous. A hotel owner from the Ruhr 
area and his family had to flee abroad to escape the dealers' 
revenge. 
  After months of negations, a deal involving 18 kg of Red 
Mercury had not come about. Nevertheless, the Russian 
negotiating partners demanded $300,000 for their efforts. When 
the hotel owner refused, they called him on the phone and 
threatened to set fire to his house and to kidnap his children. 
  Rimmele and Eichler also gained experience with the East 
European Mafia. After failed negotiations on rare metals and 
Red Mercury, they were kidnapped and brought to the Latvian 
capital of Riga. 
  Eichler managed to free himself, he alerted the German 
Embassy and the police. Later, Rimmele was also released. 
  The two dealers did not speak about the real background of 
the kidnapping. But they had broken the law of silence, the 
omerta, which is now also valid in East Europe. Rimmele and 
Eichler betrayed the kidnappers to the Latvian police. 
  Since then they had lived in fear.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Nabil Sharitah, a 43-year-old 
Syrian diplomat, today denied having transported the explosives 
used in an attack on the Maison de France [French cultural 
center in West Berlin]. 
  Testifying to the 29th Criminal Bench of Berlin Regional 
Court, Sharitah, who was hidden from the view of journalists and 
the public by a curtain, admitted that on 25 August 1983 he gave 
explosives stored at the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin to 
46-year-old terrorist Johannes Weinrich only a few hours before 
the attack on the French cultural center on Kurfuerstendamm. 
  Sharitah, who was third secretary of the Syrian Embassy at 
the time and in charge of security, claims he learned of the 
purpose for which the terrorist needed the explosives only after 
the attack. The witness confirmed that the ambassador had 
assigned him to look after Johannes Weinrich and other 
terrorists. The ambassador had acted on instructions from the 
Syrian Foreign Ministry. 
  At the start of his testimony the diplomat, who recently 
gave 
himself up to the German authorities, said he hopes the case 
will not become a trial of his country. Syria had nothing to do 
with the attack on the Maison de France. 
  The defendant, 51-year-old former Stasi [GDR Ministry for 
State Security] Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Voigt, is charged with 
having been an accessory to murder and to the explosives attack 
on the Maison de France. He is accused of having arranged for 
25 kilos of explosives, which the terrorists had temporarily 
stored at the Syrian Embassy before the attack, to be handed 
over to Weinrich. 
  One person was killed and 23 were injured, some seriously, 
in 
the bomb attack.

stressed that he wishes to continue the Bonn Government 
coalition between the Union parties and the FDP [Free Democratic 
Party] following the Bundestag elections on 16 October this 
year. He would "fight" for this, Kohl said today during an 
interview with the private television station SAT1. He intended 
to conduct and win an "intensive and highly committed election 
campaign." Kohl added he was "not particularly impressed" by 
poor opinion poll results. "The election will be decided on 
polling day," he said.

<F P=106> [Heinz Vielain report: "Chancellor Kohl: SPD Has Sinned </F>
Against German Unity"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- According to notes made by the Socialist 
Unity Party of Germany [SED], the candidate for chancellor and 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], Rudolf 
Scharping, spoke out for the "realization of the Gera demands" 
in secret talks with SED Politburo member Hermann Axen in 1987. 
The Gera demands contain the recognition of GDR [German 
Democratic Republic] citizenship, which would have meant 
cementing divided Germany. The same source says that current SPD 
Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine and former SPD Chairman Bjoern 
Engholm also had secret talks with GDR politicians in the late 
80's, during which they promised to fulfill important SED 
demands. 
  An official SED Central Committee protocol on Scharping's 
talk with Axen says: "R. Scharping spoke out for the 
realization of the Gera demands and immediate official contacts 
between the People's Chamber of the GDR and the FRG Bundestag." 
  The "Gera demands," which SED Chairman Erich Honecker 
formulated on the opening of a "party course in Gera" in October 
1980, contain the following points: 
  -- Recognition of GDR citizenship; 
  -- Abolition of the central registration center for human 
rights violations in the GDR (an establishment of the land 
justice authorities in Salzgitter); 
  -- Turning the permanent FRG and GDR representations into 
embassies; 
  -- Defining of the Elbe border (between Schnakenburg and 
Boitzenburg), in the middle of the waterway. 
  Rudolf Scharping, who was then SPD Chairman of 
Rhineland-Palatinate, paid an official visit to the GDR with a 
delegation of his land's party in 1987. The meeting with Axen 
took place on 27 October in the building of the SED Central 
Committee. 
  About the recognition of the Gera demands by Scharping, the 
protocol of the SED Central Committee, which has been made 
available to WELT AM SONNTAG, says that Axen "agreed" with 
Scharping on this and other issues. Axen said that, for the 
SPD, it was important not to let the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] and Christian Social Union [CSU] take away the fruits of 
the new Ostpolitik initiated by Willy Brandt. Axen was a member 
of the presidium of the SED Central Committee. It was also he 
who, in 1987, worked out the joint SED/SPD program paper on the 
"dispute of ideologies and common security," together with the 
leading Social Democrats Erhard Eppler and Egon Bahr. 
  Another Central Committee note on a meeting between the 
current deputy SPD Chairman Oskar Lafontaine and Erhard Honecker 
on 23 October 1987, which has also been made available to WELT 
AM SONNTAG, says that Lafontaine advocated an "absolute 
recognition" of a two-state Germany. According to the official 
protocol, the SPD politician said: "Taking account of GDR 
interests and absolutely recognizing two states, he thinks it is 
necessary to find out what steps are possible in the future. In 
the FRG, there is a general consensus that a two-state Germany 
is a reality that nobody can ignore." 
  According to the protocol, Honecker had said that all 
illusions about reunifying the two German states must be 
decisively rejected. As to Lafontaine, the protocol notes 
"agreement." The document then notes Lafontaine's statement as 
follows: "In his view, it would be good to develop common ideas 
in the future, as to what agreements a government led by the SPD 
could aim at with regard to the GDR." 
  Another protocol by the SED Central Committee reports on a 
meeting SPD politician Bjoern Engholm had with leading SED 
politician Hermann Axen on 6 April 1987, during which 
recognition of the GDR as a state was also discussed. Engholm 
was a member of the SPD Executive Committee and head of the SPD 
land parliament group in Schleswig-Holstein. 
  According to the protocol, Engholm said that the relations 
between the FRG and the GDR require a clearing away of existing 
basic problems. The SED protocol quotes Engholm as saying: 
"The SPD must speak out for the recognition of GDR citizenship, 
for the midstream Elbe border, and the abolition of the 
Salzgitter registration center. Both German states have a 
historic responsibility for peace. But bigger problems can only 
be solved if the existing obstacles are finally cleared away." 
  A severe dispute broke out at the weekend between Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and North Rhine-Westphalia's Minister President, 
Johannes Rau, the SPD candidate for federal president, on 
documents saying that Rau received election assistance from the 
SED in 1987, in order to replace Chancellor Kohl as head of 
government. 
  These documents, which have been made available to WELT AM 
SONNTAG, indicate that a kind of barter business took place 
between the SPD and the SED on the eve of the January 1987 
Bundestag elections: The SED stops the flood of asylum seekers 
from Sri Lanka at the German-German border, which Kohl's 
government had tried to do in vain. In return, the SPD assures 
the SED of accepting the GDR's sovereignty. The SPD mediator 
was Egon Bahr. Election campaigner Johannes Rau could announce 
that the flood of asylum seekers via the Berlin-Schoenefeld 
airport was stopped on 18 September 1986, as the result of 
personal and persevering efforts. 
  In an interview with SAT-1 television network, Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl said that the files that have now been published 
show who had mentally "defected" to former SED Chairman Erich 
Honecker. What becomes known about SPD policy, is "utterly 
disgraceful." He said he does not know of any statement by SPD 
presidential candidate Johannes Rau clearly rejecting the idea 
of a GDR citizenship. 
  The chancellor emphasized that he does not want a "dirty 
campaign." But especially as a presidential candidate, Rau 
would have to face the files that have now been published. 
  In an interview with the Westdeutscher Rundfunk radio 
station 
on Saturday [5 February], Rau rejected Kohl's comments: He said 
he has not made any concessions whatsoever to the GDR. In his 
speeches and in the government program, he always recommended to 
"respect GDR citizenship on the basis of the constitution." He 
said the CDU apparently wants to "create suspicions." He 
appeals to all parties to return to an election campaign where 
"the dirty work is not left to the dung beetle." 
  SPD Manager Guenter Verheugen accused Chancellor Kohl of 
"character assassination" and demanded an agreement in which all 
parties agree on SED and Stasi documents "not to be used as 
weapons in the election campaign." 
  On Saturday, Chancellor Kohl informed WELT AM SONNTAG that 
he stands by his belief "that the SPD has sinned against German 
unity." Accepting two citizenships would have "equalled the 
expulsion of 17 million Germans." 
  Politicians in the new laender expressed concern about the 
collaboration between West German politicians and the SED. 
Former GDR civil rights activist and present CDU deputy 
Reverend Rainer Eppelmann told WELT AM SONNTAG: "I am not 
saying that Rau should resign because this would be unfairly 
condemning him, which is unworthy of a constitutional state. 
But he has to speak. He must reply to the accusations." 
  Eppelmann is chairman of the Bundestag commission for 
investigations into the GDR past. In a first assessment of the 
goings-on he said: "The human failure in the whole thing is 
that leftist democrats of the Federal Republic of Germany seem 
to have been involved in shady dealings with leftist dictators 
in the GDR, regarding the FRG center politicians as opponents. 
It must be made clear that this never happened." 
  SPD Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Thierse, who comes from eastern 
Germany, told WELT AM SONNTAG he thinks it is advisable that the 
clarification of the dealings "be assigned to political 
scientists and historians at first." In this connection, the 
accusation that CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang 
Schaeuble promised a redefinition of the Elbe border during 
government talks on halting the flood of asylum-seekers from the 
GDR would also have to be discussed. Schaeuble had denied this 
accusation. 
  Thierse accused the CDU/CSU of being afraid of an "objective 
election campaign." This is why "past events are brought up, 
with the intention of triggering heated disputes and diverting 
attention from the real problems, such as unemployment and 
national debts." He said he finds this "mean." 
  CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Manager Juergen Ruettgers told WELT 
AM SONNTAG that it is "absolutely necessary to inform citizens 
about all the details of former internal contacts between the 
SPD and the SED, and especially of Johannes Rau's role."

<F P=106> [Report signed "ban": "Kanther Hopes For Change of Thinking </F>
in FDP"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 4 Feb -- On Friday [4 February] FRG Interior 
Minister Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) regretted that in 
the course of negotiations in the coalition on a "Law on the 
Fight Against Crime 94," the Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP] has not agreed to give security authorities the right to 
monitor conversations in residences in the course of the 
struggle against organized crime. On Friday Kanther said that 
he hopes that the FDP will "change its mind." The matter is 
important to him. Nevertheless, by presenting the article law, 
the coalition has proved that it is able and willing to act. 
Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) also paid 
tribute to the package of laws, which will improve "the 
instruments for combating crime while strictly adhering to 
rule-of-law principles." The coalition is striving to adopt the 
article law in the Bundestag before the summer recess. It will 
be discussed together with a draft law of the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] group on internal security, which 
facilitates -- under certain conditions -- the monitoring of 
conversations in residences as well as, in case of sufficient 
suspicion, the seizure of illegal assets. Kanther rejected this 
SPD proposal as a violation of the Basic Law's guarantee of 
property. Deputy SPD Bundestag Group Chairwoman Fuchs 
criticized the coalition draft by saying that the "coalition, 
completely divided by internal quarrels" no longer has the 
strength to really combat organized crime. 
  A number of different legal amendments on internal security 
have been brought together in the coalition's article law. The 
Federal Intelligence Office is to be given additional tasks; it 
is to be permitted to pass on to the criminal prosecution 
authorities information found abroad and obtained by "strategic" 
telephone monitoring. The regulation on turning state's 
evidence, which has so far been limited to terrorism, is to be 
extended to crimes committed within the framework of organized 
crime. The statutory punishment for bodily injury is to be 
raised. The use of signs of unconstitutional organizations -- 
such as symbols reminiscent of national socialist signs -- will 
be punishable by law. The penal regulations against inciting 
people and inciting racial hatred will be made stricter. 
Collection of profits is to be made easier in case of 
extortions of protection money. Criminal liability for money 
laundering is to be applied to additional crimes (property 
crimes, document crimes, and bribery). More attention is to be 
paid to the so-called perpetrator-victim settlement. Various 
detailed regulations in the law of criminal procedure are to 
accelerate criminal procedures; these include better 
preconditions for imposing detention pending trial as well as 
using the reason of danger of repetition to keep someone 
detained. Penal regulations against foreign drug dealers are 
tightened in order to be able to expel them from the country. 
By amending the Industrial Code private security companies are 
to be checked more thoroughly than has been the case thus far.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe to a </F>
security policy conference in Munich on 5 February: "We Lack 
the Capability To Participate Effectively in Settling 
International Conflicts"] 
  [Text] It has become fashionable in Germany to mention new 
figures for the strength of the Bundeswehr every weekend -- 
without taking into consideration the security situation, the 
tasks of our armed forces, and the sensitive organism with which 
we are dealing. 
  A discussion that focuses primarily on troop strengths 
neglects the complicated links between the tasks of the 
Bundeswehr and the capability resulting from the situation, 
between the operational readiness level and mobilization, and 
between structure and deployment. In addition, the links 
between the Bundeswehr's obligations as an alliance partner and 
domestic defense, and finally the defense system and the funds 
that are available play a decisive role here. 
  Changes in one of these factors also change the entire 
system 
of the Bundeswehr. Minor adjustments in one area may exacerbate 
the situation in another sphere. 
  Thinking about the future of our armed forces means first of 
all getting used to the idea that we are facing two phases of a 
longer process. 
  After Germany's reunification, it was, above all, important 
for the Bundeswehr to take over and dissolve the National 
People's Army, to establish the Bundeswehr in eastern Germany, 
to reduce the all-German armed forces by almost 50 percent, to 
reorganize part of their deployment, and to prepare them for new 
tasks. 
  After the reduction of the armed forces to the stipulated 
level of 370,000 soldiers this year, the first phase of this 
process will largely be completed. 
  It is now important to redefine in detail the capabilities 
and planned structures of the Bundeswehr while taking into 
consideration the security-political situation, our increased 
international responsibility, and the tasks resulting therefrom 
for the Bundeswehr and the armed forces that Germany wants to 
have and to keep. In spite of limited funds, the Bundeswehr 
must fulfill its future tasks. 
  An analysis of the strategic situation shows that a 
large-scale aggression can no longer be the central criterion 
and yardstick for our defense concept and military planning. 
  The supreme goal of German defense policy will naturally 
remain the protection of Germany and of our alliance partners 
within NATO and the European Union against attacks from outside. 
This is the most dangerous but at the same time most unlikely 
scenario. 
  Crises and conflicts that erupt at smaller or larger 
distances but which may turn into a threat for individual or 
several alliance partners through regional escalation are more 
likely to occur in the future. It is in Germany's vital 
security interest to contain such critical developments 
regionally and to prevent them from spreading to Central Europe. 
  Thus, the Bundeswehr will have to fulfill two main defense 
tasks in the future. First, it must be in a position to 
contribute to settling probable international crises and 
conflicts together with allies and partners; second, it must be 
able to increase its strength and provide sufficient defense 
forces for the unlikely and most dangerous case -- that is for 
the defense of Germany and the alliance. 
  These main functions of the Bundeswehr are to be coordinated 
with each other and, as a result, they must ensure that Germany 
will retain its defense and reaction capability and continue to 
be able to develop policies and to fulfill its duties as an 
alliance partner in crises. 
  The needs and possibilities for domestic defense and crisis 
management will require a clear differentiation of the training 
and operational readiness in correspondence with the task. 
  The strategic situation makes it possible to clearly reduce 
the operational readiness level for domestic defense. The 
militarily usable warning time for the highly improbable event 
of a large-scale planned aggression suggests shifting the 
training for operational readiness for individual units of the 
expandable main defense forces to times of crises. Thus, part 
of the main defense forces might then be relieved from their 
operational mission in peacetime. 
  Because of Germany's geostrategic situation, a special 
contribution to the strength of the main defense forces in 
Central Europe that are based on the principle of mobilization 
is a decisive factor for Germany's influence in the alliance. 
  The mobilization capacity of the main defense forces is a 
vital element in national defense and for Germany's weight 
concerning a major task of NATO, that is collective defense. 
  National defense and compulsory military service are two 
sides of the same coin. Just like in France, compulsory 
military service is a central element of Germany's defense 
culture. 
  Generally, the Bundeswehr is equipped with relatively modern 
weapons for domestic defense. What we are lacking is the 
capacity to be able to participate efficiently in the settlement 
of international crises. 
  Thus, we need a German contingent of crisis reaction forces 
that is capable of carrying out combined operations in 
cooperation with alliance partners while covering the whole 
spectrum of possible operations. 
  The need for adaptation within the Bundeswehr results from 
the need to efficiently establish a basic capacity for crisis 
management, to make sensible use of the compulsory military 
service, and to gain planning leeway in view of the tight budget 
situation to make it possible to fulfill the task with the funds 
available. This also includes that rationalization measures 
within the Bundeswehr should lead to investments. 
  The Bundeswehr will be developed further as a whole organic 
system. Priorities that reflect the changed tasks of the 
Bundeswehr will be set in this respect. First of all, they will 
affect the required fundamental military capabilities. 
  The future strength of the crisis reaction forces, the 
greater extent of differentiation among the main defense forces, 
the operational rationalization, and the streamlining of 
structures will make it possible to reduce personnel. This will 
have an impact on the internal structures of the armed forces, 
the personnel strength, and the deployment. 
  However, fast changes concerning the basis for financial 
planning will ruin every orderly process. Thus, what the 
Bundeswehr needs for its development in the next few years is a 
secure conceptual and financial basis.

<F P=106> ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "Now the Big </F>
Metalworkers' Strike Is Imminent"] 
  [Text] Cologne -- Yesterday the wage negotiations on a 
pilot agreement for the entire west German metal and electrical 
industry failed in North Rhine-Westphalia in their very first 
day. About five hours after the beginning of the negotiations 
in Cologne, employers and representatives of the IG-Metall trade 
union separated. 
  They agreed that there would be no sense in holding further 
negotiations, Norbert Wrobel, the head of the IG-Metall 
negotiation team, stated. He said that there was no 
rapprochement in the talks at all: "At the end we were where we 
had started in the morning. This also makes us angry." Wrobel 
blamed the employers for the failure of the talks. They had 
insisted on abolishing the vacation bonus, something that is not 
acceptable to IG-Metall. 
  Asked whether a strike could still be avoided, the IG-Metall 
chief negotiator stated: "The signs are very bad." In the 
evening the IG-Metall Executive Committee planned to discuss 
further action. Deputy IG-Metall Chairman Walter Riester said 
that a regular strike must also be discussed. 
  Hans-Friedel Schuhe, the leader of the employers' 
negotiators, also said that strikes must now be expected. He 
said that he is very angry about the suspension of the 
negotiations. IG-Metall refused to discuss many of the issues. 
Therefore, the important topic of the vacation bonus was not 
discussed at all. Since IG-Metall refuses to discuss any 
reduction of the vacation bonus, there is no basis for 
deliberations. IG-Metall continued to "refuse the necessary 
measures to reduce costs." 
  IG-Metall demanded wage and salary increases of 5.5 percent. 
The employers, on the other hand, wanted to enforce a zero 
round for wages and salaries and, at the same time, reduce 
personnel costs by 10 percent by abolishing the vacation bonus 
and collectively agreed vacation regulations.

stepped up in the Bavarian engineering industry over the next 
few days following the interim failure of the pay talks in North 
Rhine-Westphalia. IG Metall spokesman Michael Knuth said in 
Ingolstadt today that token strikes would focus on the Audi 
plant in Ingolstadt as well as further protests in Upper Bavaria 
[southern Bavaria] and the town of Bamberg [northern Bavaria]. 
Staff are planning to leave their places of work and, weather 
permitting, demonstrate on the streets. The union is also 
planning protest action at BMW on Thursday [10 February].

  [Excerpts] The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] 
tonight reveals the contents of UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's letter to President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish 
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, inviting them to proximity talks on 
the confidence-building measures. The letter was handed to the 
two sides today. 
  In his letter, Butrus-Ghali calls on Kliridhis and Denktas 
to 
participate in intense proximity talks in late February to work 
out an agreement on a limited number of significant points 
regarding ways to implement the measures concerning Varosha and 
the Nicosia Airport. 
  The letter mentions that Joe Clark, the UN secretary 
general's special representative in Cyprus, will come to Cyprus 
during the preliminary phase of the talks and Gustave Feissel, 
the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in 
Cyprus, will then take over. The letter adds that Feissel will 
meet Kliridhis and Denktas on Monday [7 February] to determine 
the crucial points. 
  Correspondent Kostandinos Yenaris reports on the letter: 
  [Yenaris] The UN secretary general's letter was handed to 
the 
two sides today in Nicosia, but the contents were not 
publicized. CyBC reveals, however, the full text of the letter, 
in which the UN secretary general says he is satisfied because 
the two sides accepted the confidence-building measures package 
as is. Butrus-Ghali stresses the significance of working out 
ways to implement the measures within two months at the most, so 
as to utilize fully the positive atmosphere that will be created 
when the talks begin. 
  In order to reach an agreement, Butrus-Ghali calls on both 
sides to approach the talks in a constructive spirit, bearing in 
mind the following four points: First, neither side should try 
to secure a political advantage from the talks or demand that 
the other make political concessions. Second, both sides should 
respect fully the confidence-building measures as described in 
the UN secretary general's report. Third, an agreement should 
be fully implemented as soon as it is reached with no delays or 
interventions from either side. Fourth, the goal of the 
measures is to facilitate swift progress toward an overall 
Cyprus solution, not substitute for it. 
  Based on these four points, the UN secretary general calls 
on 
both sides to begin intense negotiations with his 
representatives in Nicosia in late February to reach an 
agreement on a limited number of points regarding ways to 
implement the confidence-building measures. The letter adds 
that Clark will come to Cyprus for the beginning of the talks, 
which will continue with Feissel's participation. Feissel will 
hold talks with the two sides to determine these crucial points. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] According to CyBC information, despite 
assurances 
by Feissel and Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on the Cyprus issue, that something like this will 
not happen, the Greek Cypriot side expects that during Feissel's 
contacts the Turkish Cypriot side will again attempt to raise 
the issue of redefining the part of Varosha that will be placed 
under UN control. Denktas will insist on not including the 
northern part of the fenced-off area, replacing it with area of 
equivalent size in the south. Our information is that in this 
case, the Greek Cypriot side will not agree to even discuss the 
issue.

  [Text] Political Spring party chairman Andonios Samaras 
stressed in a statement today: The government must clearly tell 
the Americans that a possible recognition of Skopje would be 
regarded by the Greek people as an action against them, it would 
make Kiro Gligorov brash, and would make the heavy Balkan 
climate even more charged. 
  Mr. Samaras also maintained that, within the same framework, 
any military intervention in Bosnia would be a tragic mistake 
and added: It would be an even more tragic mistake if Greek 
forces in any way participated in these actions and the same 
goes for the participation of any Balkan country, including 
Turkey, in such actions. 
  KKE [Greek Communist Party] political bureau member Orestis 
Kolozov said: The KKE opposes any military intervention in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We believe that if this road opens, there 
is great danger for the Balkans to become engaged in such a way 
that nobody knows how they would get out. Kolozov concluded: 
The Greek Government should remain firm in the position that 
was decided upon at the meeting between the four party leaders 
and the president on the noninvolvement of our country if the 
tension escalates. It should also withdraw Greek troops, whether 
they are members of the AWACS crews or a Greek ship so that no 
support can be given to these operations. 
  Coalition of the Left and of Progress issued a statement 
which, among other things, stressed: Resorting to air bombings 
in Bosnia would complicate the vicious circle of blood and throw 
oil on the fire with danger for a broader conflagration in the 
Balkans. The statement added: The Greek Government, from its 
position as European Union president, must firmly and 
categorically oppose the option of military intervention that is 
being promoted. At the same time, the Coalition of the Left 
proposes that the siege of Sarajevo and the embargo on Serbia be 
postponed for one month so as to make easier the achievement of 
a peaceful settlement through diplomatic means.

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said 
that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will visit the United 
States on 22 April, as announced on Saturday [5 February] by the 
responsible departments of the two countries. Asked whether 
Papandreou's trip will be affected by Washington's recognition 
of Skopje, the spokesman said: The government's policy is to 
convince the international factions that a solution will be 
found when Kiro Gligorov bends his intransigence. So, the prime 
minister's trip will take place as announced.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Nikoletta Dhoukaki] </F>
  [Excerpt] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis 
arrived at Corfu Airport last night at the invitation of the 
PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] Municipal Committee in 
Kerkira. Arsenis was accompanied by Mrs. Louka Katseli. 
  Speaking at the Municipal Committee's annual meeting, 
Arsenis 
said he is convinced that PASOK will win the two 1994 elections 
and stressed that the government has the willingness and 
experience to deal with the challenge of the Greek presidency 
successfully. Referring to the government's foreign policy, 
Arsenis stressed that Greece will regain its international 
credibility and defend its national rights. 
  [Begin Arsenis recording] We proceeded with courage on the 
Cyprus issue by announcing the joint Greek-Cypriot defensive 
area. Without many words and much publicity, we have passed 
everywhere the message that Greece is not joking, that we--the 
government and the people--are ready to deal with the danger 
from the East because we are not willing to give up even an inch 
of territory, airspace, or sea to Turkey. We will defend our 
national rights. [end recording] 
  Discussing the Armed Forces, the national defense minister 
stressed that they belong to the Greek people and are not to be 
used in anyone's feud. He added that the new law passed by the 
government overturned New Democracy's injustices. [passage

  [Text] Greece is to send an estimated one billion drachmas 
worth of military airplanes, helicopters, army trucks, and 
uniforms to help the Palestinians organize a security force in 
accordance with the Israeli-PLO accord signed at the White House 
last year. The offer has been accepted by the Palestinians 
except for six CH-13 helicopters and two U-17AB reconnaissance 
planes, considered to be outdated equipment. 
  Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis and Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias toured Greek army camps inspecting the 
material which will be given free as part of the Greek 
contribution towards peace in the Middle East. PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat made a request for such supplies during a meeting 
with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou on his recent visit to 
Greece.

<TEXT>
Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The various moves and activities of New 
Democracy (ND) leader Miltiadhis Evert are the subject of 
commentary in the Greek press. 
<H5>  On Minorities </H5>
  According to the 19 January Athens daily TA NEA, Evert 
recently traveled to Thraki and visited various cities and 
institutions. One of them was a minority elementary school, 
where conditions were "not good." He then visited a "typical" 
elementary school in the same area. He found conditions in the 
second school "very satisfactory." As a result, he stated to 
the Christian teachers that "it is our duty to build as good a 
school for the Muslims, too." 
<H5>  Agreement With Stefanopoulos </H5>
  The 9 January Athens Sunday newspaper O TIPOS TIS KIRIAKIS 
reports that a rapprochement between Evert and Democratic 
Renewal (DhIANA) leader Kostis Stefanopoulos is expected soon to 
enable the latter to be included in the ND's European elections 
list. "If everything goes well," Stefanopoulos will probably 
head the list. In another development, EC Commissioner Ioannis 
Palaiokrassas will not be a candidate, for he has concluded that 
he would be more useful by staying in Brussels for all of 1994, 
the paper reports. New Commission members will be appointed on 1 
January 1995. 
<H5>  Hardline Vs. Low-Key Policy </H5>
  The 9 January TIPOS TIS KIRIAKIS comments that the ND 
leadership is faced with a dilemma. Privately conducted polls 
show that 55 percent of ND sympathizers want a more hardline 
opposition, while 90 percent of center-right voters and those 
wavering between parties wish for a "gentler and dignified" 
opposition. Evert is attempting to conciliate the two views 
without disappointing either side, the newspaper notes. It adds, 
however, that the new year is ushering in a period in which the 
ND, besides reorganizing its own structures, will "intensify" 
its monitoring and criticism of government action "on all 
fronts" to gain the initiative in political developments. 
  The 11 January TA NEA quotes Evert as stating on 1O January 
at a meeting of ND trade unionists that "if you elected me your 
leader just to overthrow PASOK tomorrow, you made a mistake. 
PASOK is following its course. My goal is to finally create in 
this country a modern political discourse that will make us more 
mature and ready to succeed when we come to power."

  [Text] Greece's Coast Guard yesterday made the largest ever 
cocaine seizure in Greek history when it discovered 60 kgs of 
the drug hidden aboard a ship, the Ministry of Merchant Marine 
said last night. The cocaine, in paste form, was found in the 
engine exhausts of the 10,736 ton Panamanian-flagged Kinaros V. 
after it went into a dry dock near Athens for repairs. The 
vessel, a refrigerator ship, had been sitting in port for nearly 
eight months after returning from a trip to Colombia.

  [Text] Turkey and Bosnia-Herzegovina have signed a 
cultural cooperation protocol. The protocol was signed by 
Culture Minister Fikri Saglar and Enest Drakovic, Bosnian 
minister of education, science, and culture. 
  Saglar and Drakovic have also issued a joint communique 
appealing to the world to end the continuing massacre of the 
Bosnian people and the destruction of the Bosnian cultural 
heritage. The communique strongly condemns the international 
community's indifference against the massacre in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Stressing the necessity of implementing all 
the UN Security Council resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
communique asks that the unjust arms embargo be lifted 
immediately. The communique further calls for an end to the 
bombing of the civilian population, the declaration of an 
overall cease-fire, and for NATO to undertake every possible 
military action to prevent Serbian aggression. The communique, 
which is signed by the two ministers, will be sent to 
international organizations including the United Nations and the 
Council of Europe. 
  Drakovic also met with National Defense Minister Nevzat 
Ayaz. 
Ayaz said that Turkey is supporting Bosnia-Herzegovina at 
international platforms and that it will also help solve the 
problems encountered in the field of education. Drakovic 
thanked Turkey for the close interest it has shown and the aid 
it has extended so far.

  [Text] The pressure is on to use military force in the 
wake of the massacre that occurred in Sarajevo last weekend and 
resulted in the death of 68 people. At Turkey's initiative, the 
Islamic Conference Organization [ICO], which is composed of 52 
Islamic countries, is calling on the UN Security Council to 
convene an urgent meeting today in order to lift the arms 
embargo against the Bosnian Muslims. 
  Ambassador Inal Batu, Turkey's permanent UN representative, 
held a news conference in New York where he said that the ICO 
communique will be delivered to the UN and NATO secretaries 
general and to the UN Security Council president today. 
Ambassador Batu pointed out that the communique expresses the 
ICO countries' reaction to the latest incidents in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He added that the letters sent by President 
Demirel and Foreign Minister Cetin to the presidents and foreign 
ministers of NATO member countries have been delivered to UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali as UN documents.

  [Text] Murat Karayalcin, leader of the Social Democratic 
Populist Party [SDPP], state minister and deputy prime minister, 
has said that Turkey will reassess its relations with its 
allies, depending on the stand they adopt toward the issue of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In an opening statement at the SDPP Central Executive 
Council 
meeting, Karayalcin said the recent massacre in Sarajevo has 
taken the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina beyond the dimensions of 
a human tragedy. Stressing that Turkey will not allow the 
problem to be defined as a human tragedy and then discarded 
among the many daily discussions, Karayalcin said that foreign 
policy friendships are different than individual ones. He added: 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] Should our friends fail to 
demonstrate their friendship after this incident as well, then I 
believe that ties of friendship do not mean a lot. Turkey will 
feel the need to reassess its relations of friendship and mutual 
assistance depending on the stand to be adopted by its allies 
following the developments of 5 February. [end recording] 
  In reply to a question, Karayalcin said Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller briefed him on the appointment of Isparta Deputy Aykon 
Dogan as state minister. 
  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin briefed the meeting on the 
steps taken toward a solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem.

<F P=106> [Report by Irfan Sapmaz: "Aliyev Resists Russia's Pressure"] </F>
  [Text] Baku--Russia maintains its diplomatic and military 
pressure on Azerbaijan in order to force it to agree to the 
deployment of its military forces in that republic. Meanwhile, 
it has been reported that, considering President Geydar Aliyev's 
resistance to Moscow's wishes, Russia is worried by his upcoming 
visit to Ankara. 
  It has been reported that Russia has intensified its 
pressure 
on Aliyev to force him to agree to the redeployment of two 
Russian military units in Azerbaijan. The two units were moved 
out of that republic in 1992 by former President Abulfaz 
Elchibey. Meanwhile, Russia has planned to base the two units 
in Makhachkala and Derbent in Dagestan, which is on Russia's 
border with Azerbaijan. The statement Aleksandr Baranov, deputy 
commander of Russia's border units, gave to the POST FACTUM NEWS 
AGENCY on 1 February revealed Russia's intention to base the two 
military units on Azerbaijan's border. 
  Mirsalih Akhundly, head of the Azerbaijan Border Guards 
Command Press Center, has said however that Azerbaijan has not 
signed any agreement with Russia for the deployment of that 
country's military units on the Republic's border. He also 
asserted that Russia wishes in particular to base its military 
forces along Iran's and Turkey's borders. 
  It will be recalled that in addition to diplomatic pressure, 
Russia has also directed military pressure toward Azerbaijan by 
having its military units fight on the side of the Armenians in 
Karabakh. Considering all that, Moscow is seriously worried by 
Aliyev's upcoming visit to Turkey and the possibility that he 
may sign a military agreement in Ankara.

  [Text] State Minister Cemil Erhan has left for Tehran to 
attend the joint economic committee meetings to be held there. 
  In a statement at Ankara's Esenboga Airport before his 
departure, Erhan said that last year imports from Iran amounted 
to $590 million, while exports totaled $235 million. 
  Erhan said that during the talks, the two sides will discuss 
ways of increasing exports to Iran, eliminating the delays in 
payment, and the issue of receiving additional crude oil in 
return for goods. He added: We will also discuss border trade, 
the Iran-Turkey-Europe natural gas pipeline, and cooperation in 
the fields of agriculture, petrochemicals, transportation, and 
communications. 
  Erhan will return to Turkey on 10 February.

  [Text] Ankara -- Bad news about fiscal accounts on 
Wednesday [2 February] followed Turkey's two week long monetary 
crisis that led to the resignation of the Central Bank governor 
on Monday. 
  Finance Minister Ismet Atilla disclosed that Turkey's 
year-end (consolidated) budget deficit tripled from TL [Turkish 
lira] 43.6 trillion ($2.52 billion) in 1992 to TL 129.4 trillion 
($7.5 billion) in 1993. 
  Turkish financial markets have been shattered by the rapid 
depreciation of the national currency and by serious imbalances 
in monetary management since Jan. 15. 
  The actual budget gap during the whole of 1993 deviated by a 
significant 242.7 percent from the original programme target of 
TL 53.3 trillion. 
  Fiscal authorities produced an additional budget of TL 84 
trillion last November and foresaw further deficits of TL 64 
trillion. 
  Atilla told the Anatolia news agency that budget revenues 
accounted for 73.6 percent of expenditures in 1993. He said 
total budget receipts rose 102.1 percent to TL 359.8 trillion, 
falling short of expenditures worth TL 489.2 trillion. Turkey 
spent 37 percent (TL 169.5 trillion) of its overall budget 
expenditures on public salaries. 
  Transfer payments amounted to TL 226.7 trillion (46.4 
percent) in 1993. 
  Turkey's fiscal balances have worsened rapidly since early 
1993. Domestic debt stock climbed to an all-time high of TL 350 
trillion in the first 11 months of the year, up from the 
original target of TL 250 trillion for the entire year. 
  Economists cite five sources of the mushrooming deficits in 
the public sector: the state budget; state economic enterprises 
(SEEs); municipalities; agricultural cooperatives; social 
security institutions. 
  They add the government's anti-terror fight as a growing and 
even more substantial factor. Unofficial reports claim that 
Ankara spent around TL 100 trillion in fighting separatist 
terror during 1993.

<F P=106> [Pierre Lefevre and Andre Riche interview with Foreign </F>
Minister Willy Claes; place and date not given: "Don't Let Our 
European Social Model Explode"] 
  [Text] [LE SOIR] You have just left the fanfare of the EU 
presidency. But you get the feeling that it has again fallen 
into a period of lethargy. 
  [Claes] I have never properly understood why the Greek 
presidency has been condemned before it has begun. I believe 
that for internal political reasons, elections, change of 
government, the Greeks were late in preparing their presidency. 
But when you see the busy agenda for the meeting of the Council 
of Ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday [7 and 8 February], the 
Greeks seem to be on their way to surpassing the reputation of 
the Belgians who were already moving forward at exceptionally 
high speed. There is a lot to be done, but with one inevitable 
priority: The enlargement of the Union. We have just under one 
month to conclude the negotiations. 
  [LE SOIR] Do you believe it will be possible to respect the 
1 
March deadline? And if not, will it matter? 
  [CLaes] Everything depends on what you mean by "respect" the 
deadline. If we over-run by a few weeks, it is not serious. 
If, on the other hand, we don't manage to conclude within two 
or three months, that will be a serious setback. We would then 
have to wait for the new European Parliament to meet which has 
to give its assent. But I still believe it is possible to 
conclude the negotiations within the deadlines set. 
  [LE SOIR] Certain candidate countries, Norway and Sweden, 
are 
facing negative public opinions. Do these countries require 
special treatment? 
  [Claes] For Sweden, the situation is less clear. The latest 
opinion polls show a majority in favor of membership. 
Essentially, it has been stated and restated that we must not 
start the exceptions game all over again. Either candidates 
accept Maastricht and Community progress to date, or it will not 
work. There is room for periods of transition and specific 
regulations for specific problems. But there is no room for 
permanent structural exceptions. It is not the EU which is 
asking Sweden and Norway, and so on to join. The populations in 
question must know what they want. 
  [LE SOIR] You are president of the European Socialist Party 
and you have elections in four months. How are you going to 
present the image of a more human Europe to your voters? 
  [Claes] We must explain to Europeans that we are in the 
depths of a structural crisis and that virtually all the 
problems we are currently facing go beyond national borders, 
that the problems are interconnected, and that we therefore need 
a voluntarist policy at international level. That is the only 
way to avoid the explosion of our social model. 
  [LE SOIR] But are we not doing precisely the opposite? Is 
not Europe an excuse for doing nothing? 
  [Claes] In all honesty, I do not believe so. Governments 
everywhere are trying to boost the competitiveness of companies, 
encouraging employers and employees to find more imaginative 
labor solutions, promoting flexibility. We cannot say that 
Jacques Delors' White Paper has not been acted upon. 
Governments everywhere are adopting the same approach. That is 
a sign of the reality of Europe. 
  [LE SOIR] And at the social level, do you feel that Europe 
is 
acting? 
  [Claes] We must be honest: It is a great weakness for 
Europe. Miet Smet, during the Belgian presidency, obtained some 
results. I am the last person to underestimate his work, but we 
must not exaggerate the results either. The Twelve have 
legislated on working hours, but a 48-hour week remains 
possible. We have also legislated on youth employment, but it 
is still possible to work at the age of 13 in Europe. It is 
time Mrs. Thatcher and her consorts stopped criticizing us for a 
savage social policy!

<F P=106> [By Chris Parking, PRESS ASSOCIATION, Dublin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Irish premier Albert Reynolds tonight stepped up 
the pressure on Sinn Fein and the IRA to respond to the Downing 
Street Declaration. Mr Reynolds said he had provided "copious 
clarification" of the document he signed along with John Major 
in London on December 15. He told a European Parliament 
candidates selection meeting of his Fianna Fail party in Dublin 
that he had given clarification of the declaration in numerous 
statements as well as in a lengthy response last week to a 
letter from Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. 
  "Since such clarification was requested from us we are 
entitled to expect that it would be carefully studied and taken 
into account," he said. 
  "Two months after the joint peace declaration it is time for 
political realism and for a clear decision soon ..." he added. 
[passage omitted] 
  Mr Reynolds warned against thinking that clarification from 
London for the Republicans was all that was needed and said the 
role of the Irish Government was central to the peace process. 
He said it was clear the armed conflict could resolve nothing 
and equally clear that bilateral dialogue or negotiation between 
Sinn Fein and Britain, without regard to Dublin or the other 
Northern Ireland political parties, would also fail to solve the 
impasse. 
  "I have provided comprehensive textual clarification," he 
added. "I have presented a closely argued analysis of how 
self-determination is applied in international law in 
partitioned countries worldwide. I would expect people to study 
it and respond to it and not to treat the issue simplistically," 
he urged.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Amalric: "France Urges NATO To Take </F>
Action"] 
  [Excerpts] By asking for an emergency meeting of the NATO 
Council to decide on the implementation of an "ultimatum," 
France chooses a hard line -- thus forcing its allies to take a 
stand. [passage omitted] 
  At least, the ultimatum France wants its 15 NATO partners to 
issue is clear. It cannot be ignored or regarded as a dilatory 
measure: If it is approved by NATO and rejected by the Serbs, 
it will actually endanger UN soldiers in Bosnia, beginning with 
French troops. On the other hand, the United States, which -- 
hiding behind a convenient "understanding" of the position of 
Bosnian Muslims -- has so far refused to commit itself in the 
crisis, not even on a diplomatic level, may now be constrained 
to take a stand. In a phone conversation on Sunday [6 February], 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was reportedly rather 
surprised at the concrete nature of the French position. 
  It is too early to tell whether this first reaction means 
that everybody is going to unite around the French proposal. 
Paris is intently awaiting the response of three other NATO 
members: the Greeks, who are pro-Serb; and the Canadians and 
British, who also have troops in Bosnia and have always opposed 
the use of force. A first indication of the Greek and British 
positions should come out of the meeting of the Council of 
Foreign Ministers of the European Union in Brussels starting on 
Monday. 
  In the meantime, France does not intend to cease striving to 
achieve a negotiated settlement, that is, a partition of Bosnia. 
It expects that the ultimatum it wants to send to the Serbs 
will give more credibility to its efforts for a peaceful 
settlement by demonstrating that it wants the initial partition 
proposal to be revised in favor of Bosnia's Muslims. Paris also 
recognizes that pressure will have to be exerted on the Croats 
to make them grant the Muslims the access to the sea they have 
been demanding.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Madrid and Leon Strengthen Gonzalez"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- The renewalists' triumph at the Leon 
and Madrid provincial congresses, with which the election of 
delegates to the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] Congress 
in March was completed this weekend, strengthens the free hand 
which Felipe Gonzalez has demanded of party members in order to 
carry through his party's renewal and to appoint an Executive 
Committee of integration and balance. 
  These results, which add 39 more renewalist delegates in 
Madrid and 14 in Leon, do not change the percentages achieved in 
the rest of Spain in the previous week, which put the Guerraists 
at 30 percent, as against 70 percent for renewalists and 
integrationists, but they leave the force of Alfonso Guerra's 
supporters to the federations of Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, 
Aragon, and Extremadura, with, moreover, a renewalist presence 
in the five federations, and in the last-mentioned federation 
with an explicit pledge by Juan Carlos Rodriguez Ibarra, its 
secretary general and autonomous government premier, to support 
integration or, what is the same thing, the presence of Guerra 
and Guerraism in the future Executive Committee, but to vote for 
Felipe Gonzalez' list, even if integration is not finally 
achieved. 
  These facts and the loss of their traditional fief -- 
Andalusia, where they have had a big failure -- greatly limit 
the Guerraists' ability to pressure the secretary general in 
order to force him to reach agreement on the new leadership with 
Alfonso Guerra. This is despite the fact that in the official 
count the Guerraists claim 35 percent of the party members' 
votes, which is more than they are granted by the renewalists, 
who insist that the supporters of the party's current number two 
total well below one-third. 
<H5>  Complicated Alliance </H5>
  Nevertheless, the Guerraists have seen their support in the 
Madrid Socialist Federation strengthened, and have won over 48 
percent of the grassroots votes, albeit with a complicated 
alliance with some renewalists disagreeing with Secretary 
General Teofilo Serrano and under the last-minute leadership of 
former mayor of Madrid Juan Barranco, who enjoys considerable 
popularity in the party. But Guerra's supporters themselves 
bear in mind that one and a half years ago they were credited 
with -- and they themselves claimed -- a strength below 30 
percent in their federation. 
  In Leon, where one of the dirtiest battles with a view to 
the 
federal congress has taken place, with alleged irregular 
memberships, objections to the census, and investigations by the 
Federal Executive Committee, the renewalists eventually 
triumphed with 63 percent of the votes, which gives them 75 
percent of the representation at the March congress, with 14 
delegates, as against the five Guerraists. 
  As the surprises of the past few weeks -- especially in 
Andalusia and Murcia -- have confirmed, renewal has been 
gradually gaining supporters among the members, especially since 
Felipe Gonzalez made some gestures which were interpreted in 
that direction, such as, for instance, taking the Executive 
Committee to a vote, which he won, for Carlos Solchaga's 
appointment as parliamentary group chairman, or the designation 
of a government, following the election, in which he placed no 
Guerraist. Gonzalez' recent statements, in which he expressed 
his support for Guerra's remaining deputy secretary general, and 
in which he called for trust to be placed in him to form the 
Executive Committee, also contributed to this. In some 
renewalists' opinion, these two interventions deprived of 
arguments the Guerraists' line, based on the assertion that 
their internal opponents wished to exclude the number two from 
the Executive Committee, because of which they were demanding 
support to sit Gonzalez down with Guerra in order to reach 
agreement on the new party leadership's makeup. [passage

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial report] Helsinki Suomen Yleisradio Network in 
Finnish at 1209 GMT on 7 February carries a 36-minute live 
broadcast of a news conference given in Helsinki by 
President-elect Martti Ahtisaari. 
  Answering a question on whether he will make official visits 
to the Nordic countries before visiting Russia, Ahtisaari 
replies that he wants to visit neighboring countries as soon as 
possible, but naturally this also depends on the hosts. Asked 
whether there is a chance for Paavo Vayrynen of the Center to 
become foreign minister again, Ahtisaari rules out this option. 
He says that he wants to follow closely the progress of the 
talks on European Union membership. 
  The first round of elections eliminated the traditional 
political elite, Ahtisaari says. The election expressed 
people's desire for a more humane economic policy. The message 
from women is that much remains to be done about equality. He 
will try to find solutions, with the government, to a number of 
problems. 
  Although he has not yet had time to hand in his Social 
Democratic Party membership card, Ahtisaari says his 
relationship with the party will be the same as with the other 
parties. Answering a Norwegian journalist, Ahtisaari says he 
hopes Sweden and Norway will enter the European Union at the 
same time as Finland; it is important that all are in it 
together. As regards steps to combat unemployment, Athisaari 
says he will not divulge what he intends to discuss with Prime 
Minister Aho. 
  On the issue of Sarajevo, Ahtisaari notes that it is 
essential to identify the "murderers" responsible for the recent 
shelling of Sarajevo. His message to the various parties in the 
conflict is to seriously seek peace; no party is free of blame, 
all of them have committed atrocities. Finland should 
concentrate on peacekeeping, not peace enforcement. 
  Returning to the European Union issue, Ahtisaari says that 
since the government decided to consult the people in a 
referendum, the result of that referendum should also be binding. 
  The first round of the election eliminated politicians with 
the longest experience, Ahtisaari said. Elsabeth Rehn worked in 
parliament and served as minister for four years; he himself had 
largely worked abroad. The people now expect a more open 
political climate. 
  The broadcast concludes at 1245 GMT, when Ahtisaari was due 
to start answering questions by foreign reporters.

  [Excerpt] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Karsten Voigt, the foreign 
policy spokesman of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] group in 
the Bundestag, has expressed scepticism about possible NATO air 
strikes in Bosnia. The consequences of such an air operation 
would have to be considered beforehand, Voigt said today on the 
radio station Radio Brandenburg. Artillery positions around 
Sarajevo could certainly be hit in an attack. However, civilian 
casualties might also be expected, the SPD politician said. 
Following a possible successful operation in Sarajevo, there 
would also be demands for the same to be done in other encircled 
towns in Bosnia. This might lead to an escalation, the 
consequences of which would be incalculable, Voigt stated. 
  SPD defense expert Manfred Opel has also criticized NATO and 
UN plans to intervene in the Bosnian war using air strikes. 
Speaking on Norddeutscher Rundfunk today, Opel described these 
ideas as "political actionism." It is to be feared that the war 
in the Balkans will escalate if such attacks go ahead. NATO 
would become a belligerent, but not one which could intervene 
decisively, he asserted. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Government will raise the issue of accession to 
the fenced area of Varosha at the proximity talks that are 
expected to open in Cyprus in the middle of next week. 
Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said this demand will 
be included in the points that our side will outline on the 
issues to be discussed at the proximity talks. Mr. Kasoulidhis 
made the statement this afternoon after the meeting between 
President Glavkos Kliridhis and UN official Gustave Feissel and 
added that our side will submit a list of points which will 
cover all the aspects of the confidence-building measures. 
  Mr. Feissel said after the meeting that he has not received 
from President Kliridhis or from Rauf Denktas any list of such 
points and expressed the hope that the clarification of these 
points would be completed by the end of this week. Feissel also 
noted: During his contacts, he will make efforts to foster 
understanding and, in a wider sense, agreement between the two 
leaders on the issues to be discussed. Mr. Feissel ruled out 
redefining the Varosha area which will be placed under UN 
control, and he denied reports that repairs have begun at 
Nicosia Airport. 
  Mr. Feissel met with Rauf Denktas at noon today. He will 
have a new meeting with Denktas on Wednesday [9 February], and 
on Thursday he will meet again with President Kliridhis. The 
proximity talks will be held under Joe Clark, who is expected in 
Cyprus on Saturday.

  [Text] We are indignant. The time has come to apportion 
blame, Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos said 
this morning as he arrived at the entrance of the building where 
the European Union [EU] Council of Foreign Ministers will meet 
today. 
  Our correspondent in Brussels Nikolaos Bellos reports that 
discussion of the tragedy in Sarajevo will take place late this 
afternoon chaired by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. 
The meeting will seek to form a unified stance by the 12 EU 
members to deal with the problem. The development of the 
discussion cannot be determined right now because most member 
countries have not made their positions public. Our 
correspondent reports that the only thing certain is that at 
least three countries, Germany, France, and Belgium, will ask 
the others to agree to harden the EU position.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, the Northern League lower </F>
house floor leader, by Giovanni Negri in Rome; date not given: 
"We Do Not Want To Run Alone"] 
  [Text] Bossi is dividing his time between Milan and Ponte 
di Legno, breathing pure mountain air as he polishes every 
minute detail of his speech for Bologna. On the eve of the 
Bologna convention, Maroni is the official spokesman. 
  [Negri] Ambassador, mediator, weaver of webs: Have they 
promoted you on the field of battle? 
  [Maroni] What a load of rubbish.... That really is not my 
role. 
  [Negri] What have you to say to the followers of the League 
as they make their way to the convention? 
  [Maroni] I tell them to believe in the strategy launched at 
Assago. 
  We have to build up an alliance among forces that are still 
different, to accept the notion that we have to create real 
prospects for the country. The Left is splitting before we have 
even reached election day. We must not be in too great a hurry, 
but we are moving in the direction of an alliance. 
  [Negri] Let us come to the point. Is it to be a lone stand 
against the rest, or an electoral coalition? 
  [Maroni] Splendid isolation is risky. Of course, I do not 
mean this in electoral terms: If we strengthen our identity we 
shall win even more votes. We shall win hands down in the north 
in any case; opinion polls carry no more weight than a badly 
dealt deck of cards. The point is rather that a victory that is 
useful, indeed essential, in turning over a new leaf in Italy is 
better than a landslide that would only open up a rift in the 
country. 
  [Negri] And so has a deal been made with Berlusconi? 
  [Maroni] Very nearly. When we say that he constitutes a 
decisive link between north and south, we think that he performs 
a crucial role. The truth of the matter is that this alliance 
will win the two of us 90 percent of the seats in the north: 
250 deputies and senators, a pole definitely destined for 
government. 
  The crux of the matter is the south: Federalism has 
foundered because the time is not yet ripe. 
  [Negri] For the sake of argument, let us assume you say no 
to 
everyone, and Berlusconi runs on his own in the north. 
  [Maroni] There would be negative consequences. Italy would 
be handed over to the left-wing minorities, indeed to a party 
like the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] that is now down to 
15 percent of the vote. This is not what Berlusconi entered the 
fray to achieve, but he cannot win alone, much less by joining 
forces with Martinazzoli. What will emerge from the election in 
any case is a deep division between north and south: We must 
not stress the differences but reconcile them, and the mediators 
are "Rooting for Italy," the centrists, the secular forces, and 
the promoters of the referenda. All other approaches lead to 
secession, but what we want is federalism. 
  [Negri] That is generous of you. But Fini, too, is winning 
in central and southern Italy. 
  [Maroni] Yes, he is the other half of the equation. But it 
is too early to negotiate with him yet. We must account for 
differences and make our choice, either sanctioning them once 
and for all or maybe coming to an agreement on a joint platform 
in a year or so. Always providing he gets rid of his 
black-shirted goons and his notion of centralist, corporatist 
capitalism and becomes a modern component of a force that 
extends from the right to the liberal left, obviously comprising 
the League, which is a free market, federalist force. 
  [Negri] Fini has said he would like to see Martino as 
minister of the economy. 
  [Maroni] That is highly positive. We, too, have great 
respect for Martino as an economist. 
  [Negri] You have negotiated with Segni and are involved with 
coalition issues. Is the League's door still open? 
  [Maroni] Segni is a star on the wane because he cannot make 
his mind up. He keeps on saying, "we'll see." But time is up, 
and all he can do is put together the Amatos, the La Malfas, and 
the Martinazzolis of this world, in other words those that 
supported Craxi and Andreotti, adding for good measure the 
Pattuellis and Ferris, the idiot grandchildren of the CAF [old 
Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani deal], the yes men who were content with 
the crumbs. No: It is the League that guarantees that certain 
things will never happen again. At the most, Segni will end up 
as the deputy secretary of the PPI [Italian Popular Party]. 
  [Negri] If Occhetto wins, do you really rule out a governing 
coalition with him? 
  [Maroni] Over my dead body. All I give Occhetto is eight out 
of 10 for luck: What he has achieved is certainly not 
attributable to skill. Do you really think someone who cannot 
even impose his leadership on an Adornato or a Ripa di Meana is 
capable of governing Italy? 
  [Negri] Nonprogressive Italy is looking to the League 
convention to find out whether you just want to rule in the 
north or whether you intend to fight to win. What do you expect 
from Bossi? 
  [Maroni] A federalist approach, not a separatist one. A yes 
to alliances and a no to isolation. And a precise prescription 
for how to cross a crucial bridge with the League, the north, 
and the country. I have confidence in him. Although everything 
is in a state of flux, he will make use of one of his greatest 
gifts: his intuition.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance coordinator Gianfranco </F>
Fini by Stefano Caviglia in Rome; date not given: "Fini, 
Running for Government"] 
  [Text] Rome. "The center-right axis has no future without 
the National Alliance." MSI [Italian Social Movement] Secretary 
Gianfranco Fini is watching the movement between the Northern 
League and Forza Italia and waiting, but he is not anxious. He 
has made plans to meet with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi in the near future and fully intends to conclude the 
electoral accord on which he has set his sights. 
  [Caviglia] Deputy Fini, Bossi now seems to see a better 
chance of an electoral accord between yourself and Forza Italia. 
Is this a real overture? 
  [Fini] In my view, the fact that Bossi has told Berlusconi 
to handle the south, means that he is well aware that this means 
an accord with the National Alliance. Berlusconi has the votes 
and can form a consensus -- I do not question that -- but, if he 
wants his followers to be elected, he must build a relationship 
with us. Therefore, in my opinion, the accord is both numerical 
and logical. 
  [Caviglia] But what type of accord can there be between you 
and Forza Italia if Berlusconi signs a binding pact with the 
League? 
  [Fini] Clearly no hidden accord. We do not like the idea of 
stepping down, where one candidate refrains from running for 
election in order to do a favor to the other. If there is to be 
an accord, it will be made out in the open. Otherwise it would 
be like cheating the voters. On the other hand, neither can 
there be a political and program accord after the boost that 
Bossi has given federalism. 
  [Caviglia] Does that means you are setting conditions for 
potential allies? 
  [Fini] I am simply saying that Bossi's attitude has made any 
chance of a political accord impossible. We cannot accept the 
prospect of federalism. 
  [Caviglia] So how can you reach an agreement? 
  [Fini] I think there is room for a clearly stated electoral 
agreement between the National Alliance and Forza Italia in the 
south. 
  [Caviglia] With both symbols, one beside the other? 
  [Fini] That is one possibility, but not the only one. I 
repeat, in my view the need for this accord lies in the numbers. 
And the result would also be very important because of its 
indirect effects. If an accord is reached between Berlusconi and 
the League in the north, and between Berlusconi and the National 
Alliance in the south, can you imagine how many constituencies 
Segni [Pact for Italy leader] and Secretary Martinazzoli (PPI 
[Italian Popular Party]) would win? 
  [Caviglia] You tell us. 
  [Fini] Maybe Stintino [Segni's home in Sardinia], where 
Segni would succeed in getting elected even if he were a pirate, 
and not many more. As for the rest, they will have to be 
content with about 20 deputies elected through proportional 
representation. And it would be the best change for the Italian 
political scene. 
  [Caviglia] It seems that the Center has become your chief 
adversary. 
  [Fini] The Center is the great uncertain factor of Italian 
politics, and the sooner the field is left clear, the better. 
The "old" at this moment is represented by Segni par 
excellence, because he is preventing Italy from having a perfect 
bipolar system, in which there are only two alignments. But I 
do not think this will last for long. After its predictable 
election debacle, the PPI and its allies will embrace the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left]. 
  [Caviglia] Actually, Segni and Martinazzoli keep on 
repeating that they are an alternative to the leftist cartel. 
  [Fini] That is in their nature. That is why the PPI has 
remained entirely in the hands of people like [PPI Veneto 
Regional Secretary] Rosy Bindi and [PPI Sicily Regional 
Secretary] Sergio Mattarella, who are very keen to reach an 
accord with the PDS. And that is why the real centrists like 
Casini, Mastella, and D'Onofrio left the party. They understood 
that the PPI was not even a real center because it was suffering 
from an acute pull to the left. At that point they had to 
choose and they are now trying to build a center-right alliance 
with us. 
  [Caviglia] A result that still seems a long way off. 
  [Fini] Well, the election campaign is clearly not the ideal 
moment, because each party roots for its own flag, proclaims its 
own identity. But building this alignment is part of our vision. 
  [Caviglia] Isn't yet another step forward required? 
  [Fini] From the point of view of values absolutely not. We 
have stated that Fascism is a part of history. What more would 
you have us do? 
  [Caviglia] A little self-criticism perhaps as the communists 
did.. 
  [Fini] It is not a matter of self-criticism, but of 
recognizing the fact that those things have been superseded. 
That there is no longer any sense in splitting into Fascists 
and anti-Fascists. Nor is there any sense in our being an 
alternative to the system, because the system no longer exists. 
We want to be able to be elected to power and make an alliance 
with the Center, but one thing must be clear: I remain a man of 
the Right.

  [Text] The Liberal Party or a Federation of Liberals? A 
single secretary or an executive committee? For two days the 
Liberal Party has debated and argued these points, and a short 
time ago they made their decision. Mimmo Sacco reports. 
  [Sacco] Yes, now we can truly say goodbye to the old Italian 
Liberal Party [PLI]. The party has changed its image and moves 
are underway to turn it into a liberal federation. The decision 
was a bitter one. It was passed this evening by a show of 
hands. By the end of the vote there were signs of irritation 
and agitation -- easy to understand since the stakes were high. 
  The intervention of [PLI Secretary Raffaele] Costa was 
necessary to unblock the situation: An elected body will guide 
the party during this transitional period until the congress 
that is scheduled to take place mid-July. 
  The proposal put forward by De Luca -- that of direct 
elections for the secretary of the congress -- was rejected. De 
Luca himself had declared his intention of running for party 
secretary, and he loudly proclaimed that the party was being 
done away with. 
  As we have already said, the whole day was punctuated by 
long 
procedural matters, but the decision has now been made.

<F P=106> [Interview with Transport Minister Raffaele Costa by </F>
Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "The Liberal Party 
Will Not Split"] 
  [Text] If he is not stirring up things, it is not him. 
Raffaele Costa, Minister Raffaele Costa, is to open the 22d 
Italian Liberal Party [PLI] Congress today by suggesting no less 
than a renegotiation of the Maastricht Treaty. "I will 
challenge the European Community -- now the European Union -- 
over its bureaucratic and welfarist approach," Costa revealed in 
this interview with IL GIORNALE, "and demand that the treaty be 
renegotiated and its implementation reviewed." 
  [Guiglia] Is there still a Liberal Party? 
  [Costa] There are many Liberals. Many more than voted for 
the PLI in the last election. I think that is what really counts. 
  [Guiglia] Are you not afraid that the PLI will end up 
splitting like the PRI [Italian Republican Party], albeit in 
choosing between [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [Pact for 
Italy leader] Segni? 
  [Costa] The Liberals are in a very different situation from 
the PRI. None of us has gone as far as to question 
liberal-democratic values. Among the Republicans there are 
those who have no qualms about hitching up with the grouping 
Communist Renewal is a part of. Frankly, I think that is a bit 
excessive. 
  [Guiglia] De Luca is offering himself as a candidate for 
secretary. Will you step down? 
  [Costa] I resigned from the post of secretary general a few 
months ago. In the past few days De Luca has made no secret of 
the fact that he is prepared to take on the job. I find that a 
remarkably courageous gesture at a time like this. We will see 
what the congress thinks about it. 
  [Guglia] What has the PLI done to erase the memory of 
[former Health Minister] De Lorenzo? 
  [Costa] The ombudsman's office, that was reestablished last 
summer after I took office, has gathered information from 
hundreds and hundreds of citizens, for months, on the 
inefficiency of the bureaucracy. We have listened to everybody. 
We have also been able to help some stand up for their rights. 
But that is not all: The overall picture that we have 
presented to the Italians is one of a party of honest people. 
  [Guiglia] You are in your fifth parliamentary term. Do you 
feel part of the so-called "new vanguard"? 
  [Costa] A mere two years ago, I appeared to be a sort of Don 
Quixote tilting at windmills. All of a sudden I find myself 
surrounded by illustrious people who appear to be discovering 
only now that the civil service is inefficient, wasteful, and 
arrogant. In 1992, I set up an inquiry into the 4 trillion lire 
development cooperation [Foreign Ministry department] affair. 
Everything is now in the hands of the magistracy, but at the 
time it was as if nobody wanted to acknowledge what was going on. 
  [IL Guiglia] Will Segni continue to waver or has he settled 
down? 
  [Costa] I would like to see him take one more small step 
toward establishing a moderate grouping. 
  [Guiglia] [Northern League Secretary] Bossi, Berlusconi or 
[National Alliance leader] Fini -- which one would you choose 
for prime minister? 
  [Costa] Berlusconi has shown himself to be a capable 
helmsman in a stormy sea. Bossi has exceptional insight, he 
knows what people want. Fini would have made an excellent mayor 
of Rome. 
  [IL Guiglia] What issues could unite the moderates? 
  [Costa] Privatization, deregulation, and the abolition of 
bureaucracy. 
  [Guiglia] Do you accept the sanction opposed by the League 
against Liberal Party member Sterpa? 
  [Costa] I have never heard of any sanction of that sort. 
  [Guiglia] Liberal Party member Zanone intends to run for 
election in Turin. Will you vote for him? 
  [Costa] Zanone has been moving down a different path from 
that of the Liberals for some time now. I do not see why our 
paths should cross again, now of all times. 
  [Guiglia] Is it still possible to prevent Occhetto from 
reaching the Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]? 
  [Costa] It depends. If those who claim they oppose him 
manageed to adopt a more open-minded attitude and ceased their 
futile arguing, we could succeed. The team we can count on now 
is already very good. 
  [Guiglia] If it is to win, does the moderate grouping have 
to conquer the north or the center-south? 
  [Costa] It has to convince the majority of Italians. And I 
would suggest that we are already a fair way along the road to 
success. How many Italians do you think want to see Italy turn 
into the last paradise of real socialism.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Democratic Alliance: Too Many </F>
Candidates Chosen According to Party Affiliation"] 
  [Text] They deserted the progressive alignment, just as the 
Greens and the Social Christians did. Then they hastily called 
a news conference at their headquarters in Via del Plebiscito. 
There were the AD [Democratic Alliance] men, behind a green 
crescent-shaped table, under the Alliance symbol, the great red, 
white, and green clover leaf. 
  Ferdinando Adornato, Giuseppe Ayala, Willer Bordon, Paolo 
Battistuzzi, Giorgio Benvenuto, Giovanna Melandri, Giancarlo 
Giglio, Pietro Scoppola, Giorgio Bogi, and Bartolo Ciccardini 
all looked grim. Their faces were stern and they were very 
reluctant to talk. So much so that they immediately made it 
clear: "No questions..., this is a delicate situation...." 
  They limited themselves to a document that said it all about 
the alliance's present condition. The two pages issued an 
appeal to the progressive forces and set four conditions. What 
are their goals? A government program that will continue from 
what [Prime Minister] Ciampi has done; a candidate for the 
premiership; a commitment to establishing a single parliamentary 
group; and a reassessment of candidates, so that voters can be 
offered 60 percent new faces. 
  The affiliation of the candidates is a major problem. The 
document states that they must not be chosen on the basis of 
party allegiance: "We will not accept any predetermined sharing 
out of quotas to parties and movements. The single-candidate 
system demands that candidates be fit in with the individual 
constituencies. We will not give up our principles in exchange 
for a few additional seats. The choice of candidates must lead 
to a major renewal." This means "yes" to men and women from 
ordinary society, workers, professional people, and citizens who 
"want to enter politics for the first time." And "no" to 
choices made on the basis of "party needs." 
  This urgent appeal did not seek a split, however. The AD's 
representatives would not specify anything explicitly, having 
sworn themselves to silence. But the document says it all. 
"The AD's political and ethical position within the progressive 
area is not in question." 
  The aim of the initiative was not to divide but to prevent 
"the democratic forces from exposing themselves to yet another 
defeat." According to the AD, the progressive alignment still 
lacks many things. It needs "a government program capable of 
creating confidence and credibility with regard to the 
progressive forces' ability to restore the country's economy to 
health, in continuity with the work done by Ciampi." And the AD 
regards the naming of a candidate to the premiership and his 
team as an important step. Moreover, Adornato's team criticized 
the lack "of commitment to joint action in parliament." "These 
are all things," according to the document, which was read out 
solemnly, "that are demanded by the spirit of the referendum and 
that the citizens are entitled to expect in order to know where 
the progressive forces want to lead the country. Unless these 
things are specified, the rationale of the alliance cannot fail 
to be reduced to a disappointing performance." 
  The AD says that such a hard stance among allies is 
justified 
by their common aim -- to defeat the right, "its attitude, and 
its political blueprint." What can be set against this "danger"? 
Not the "ideological left," the AD says. That "is not the 
right medicine for governing the country."

<F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, Feb 7 (AFP) -- The European Community 
sought Monday [7 February] to turn up the heat on Bosnia's Serbs 
with the threat of NATO airstrikes looming larger after the 
bloody weekend mortar attack in Sarajevo. 
  The shelling Saturday that killed 68 people and wounded some 
200 in Sarajevo's crowded market, the single worst incident of 
the conflict, topped the agenda for a two-day meeting of EC 
foreign ministers. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe urged giving the Serbs 
an 
ultimatum to pull back their heavy guns and lift the siege of 
the Moslem-dominated capital or face the wrath of NATO warplanes. 
  He told his colleagues here that the 22-month-old war in the 
former Yugoslav republic was "a test of our honour and capacity 
for action, a test of the European Union itself." 
  Britain, which had been reluctant to back air operations 
around Sarajevo, seemed more disposed after three rounds of 
telephone talks Sunday between Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  "The case is very strong for airstrikes as long as it 
produces more good than harm," Hurd said. Other countries were 
more cautious, and stressed the need to keep the peace 
negotiations alive. 
  UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has asked NATO to 
confirm its authorization of the use of its warplanes for 
airstrikes on artillery positions around the Serb-besieged city. 
  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ambassadors were meeting 
Monday and Dutch officials spoke of an emergency ministerial 
session of the 16-member alliance, possibly Tuesday. 
  Diplomats here said the EC ministers would do little more 
than issue a statement which might refer to Juppe's proposals, 
and then wait for the U.S.-dominated NATO to decide its action. 
  The market massacre aroused indignation to a pitch 
unprecedented in the Bosnian conflict which has left more than 
200,000 people dead and the West's credibility in tatters after 
a string of empty threats. 
  NATO has offered its air power to break the strangulation of 
the capital and other Moslem areas, to protect UN troops on the 
ground and to reopen Tuzla airport to relief flights. But it 
has yet to receive the green light from Boutros-Ghali. 
  The Serbs deny responsibility for Saturday's mortar attack 
and UN experts say it is impossible to determine from where the 
shell came. But a British spokesman said the carnage had 
"increased the collective willingness to consider military 
action around Sarajevo." 
  Hurd told reporters that any airstrikes must take in account 
the humanitarian operations and need to safeguard UN forces from 
reprisals. They must also advance peace prospects, he said. 
  "That is not to rule out the use of air power...in principle 
we are willing to use it," the chief British diplomat said. 
  Italy and Belgium strongly backed the French call for action 
if the Serbs do not withdraw their big guns more than 30 
kilometeres (19 miles) from the city and put them under UN 
control. 
  "I believe this time our dignity and credibility are at 
stake," said Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. "I am 
convinced that this time we are not in a position to step back." 
  Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino called for use of all 
political and military means to avert looming spring offensives 
in Bosnia. "Without the use of force it would be impossible to 
resolve differences between Serbs and Moslems," he said. 
  But other countries such as Spain, Denmark, Portugual and 
Greece were more cautious on the possibility on using military 
force in the Bosnian conflict. 
  "The soution will be a negotiated solution, a non-military 
solution, so that a durable peace can be achieved," Spanish 
Foreign Minister Javier Solana said. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton said Sunday that airstrikes 
would 
have to wait until U.S. allies reached a consensus. He also put 
the accent on achieving a negotiated peace settlement.

step toward military intervention in Bosnia. The ball is now on 
the NATO and UN court. [passage omitted] Fernando Paula Brito 
reports from Brussels. 
  [Brito] The EU has just approved a declaration supporting 
the 
use of air strikes as a means to lift the Serbian siege on 
Sarajevo. However a final decision on when the strikes would 
commence can only be taken in a few days time by NATO and the 
United Nations. Durao Barroso explained the position of the EU 
foreign ministers: 
  [Begin Barroso recording] We continue to believe that a 
negotiation for peace is important. We are not at war. We are 
seeking a peaceful objective. In any case, the latest events 
force the EU to take more serious measures, that is to consider 
the possibility of using air strikes in order to lift the siege 
on Sarajevo. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd spoke tonight of a 
"turning point" in attitudes towards the bloody war in Bosnia 
because of Saturday's [5 February] street market massacre in 
Sarajevo. 
  He said the balance of "risks and benefits" of an allied air 
strike to halt the carnage was now changing. 
  But, after talks between European Union foreign ministers, 
he 
said it would be "irresponsible" to take a military decision. 
  "These are not questions for diplomats but for soldiers. It 
is for NATO now. NATO governments have to get it right." 
  He was speaking after the Prime Minister called for 
immediate, effective and "more muscular" action to halt the 
bombardment of civilians in Sarajevo. 
  John Major believes that action in the wake of the atrocity 
which killed 68 people cannot wait for an overall settlement of 
the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Mr Hurd had earlier endorsed an EU declaration expressing 
"revulsion" at the brutal shelling of civilians and calling for 
an early meeting of NATO ambassadors to consider the next step. 
  "The aim should be to bring about the immediate lifting of 
the siege of Sarajevo, using all the means necessary, including 
the use of air power." 
  The Foreign Secretary insisted the declaration was a step 
forward after last month's NATO statement reaffirming the allies 
readiness to use air strikes. 
  But there was no agreement today on French demands for an 
ultimatum to be delivered to the warring factions -- pull your 
heavy arms out of Sarajevo or face air strikes in 30 days. 
  Mr Hurd said the EU was not issuing any ultimatums today. 
NATO would go into the "specifics" and come up with proposals. 
There would need to be further consultation with the United 
Nations Secretary-General and a final decision would be taken by 
the governments of the 16 NATO countries. 
  Mr Hurd said it was a question of re-assessing the risks and 
balances of military intervention. 
  "What we have asked NATO to do, in the light of arguments 
and 
information we don't have here today, is to strike the balance 
anew. Up to now that balance has been against, but in my mind 
the balance is moving." 
  Mr Hurd repeated his insistence that any use of force should 
be "forward looking." 
  He went on: "It should not simply be retaliatory. It should 
be aimed at actually improving the present situation. The test 
of the use of force is whether it would do more good than harm, 
that is a test which NATO will have to apply. Clearly this does 
bring nearer a decision...to use force." 
  Mr Hurd said the lack of exact proof about the origins of 
Saturday's devastating mortar bomb did not alter the fact that 
the carnage was brought about because of the way the Serbs have 
been harassing Sarajevo. 
  "They are no longer in a position to persuade the world of 
the merits of their case." 
  Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind will also discuss tougher 
action against the warring factions with the United Nations 
military chief Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose in Bosnia 
today and report back to the Prime Minister. 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has asked NATO to 
prepare for possible air strikes against artillery positions in 
and aournd Sarajevo. 
  Representatives of NATO's members are set to meet in 
Brussels 
on Wednesday to discuss the request. 
  [Mr Hurd said the risks still had to be weighed up before 
any 
ultimatum could be approved or issued -- the risks to UN troops 
on the ground, the risks to the continuation of the humanitarian 
effort and questions about targeting. 
  He commented: "Lifting the siege is a worthwhile objective. 
There is an overwhelming feeling now that this has to be 
attempted, that the balance of risk and benefit has changed, 
that proposals which when tested before were found wanting need 
to be tested again with a view if possible of putting them into 
effect." 
  British Government officials made it clear tonight that air 
strikes would not go ahead if the military planners considered 
the risks of failure too great, or that available targets were 
inappropriate.]

<F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
correspondent Quentin Dickinson in Brussels on 7 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Alain Juppe was not entirely 
satisfied with the outcome of the talks. He spoke to our 
reporter, Quentin Dickinson: 
  [Juppe] I would have liked the word ultimatum to figure in 
the communique, but so as not to be negative I would say that it 
is implied. It will be up to us in the North Atlantic Council 
to ensure that this resolution does not get bogged down and fade 
away. 
  [Dickinson] Do you believe Dr. Karadzic's statements to be 
purely tactical? 
  [Juppe] Well, we are used to so many statements, to so many 
meaningless cease-fires, that we cannot be satisfied with good 
intentions. It is true that Mr. Karadzic, probably realizing 
that the limits of horror were overstepped, is now speaking of 
demilitarizing Sarajevo. Well I tell him: You are on, do it. 
The best proof of his intentions would be to withdraw the heavy 
artillery around Sarajevo which is capable of shelling the city. 
If these artillery pieces are pulled back about 25 or 30 km, 
then what happened on Saturday in the Sarajevo market will no 
longer be possible. This would be far better proof of good 
intentions than a signature at the bottom of a document. So 
many signatures have proved worthless.

  [Excerpt] "We must use all political and military means to 
ease the situation in Bosnia before the spring offensives," 
Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta told a EU [European Union] 
summit of foreign affairs ministers in Brussels. Andreatta said 
that he agreed with the proposal made by French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe to give the Serbs an ultimatum to leave Sarajevo and 
to create a security perimeter to keep the Serb artillery far 
away from the city's suburbs. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Following the massacre in Sarajevo, something 
might now be happening, and perhaps now the Bosnian Serbs might 
really agree to the demilitarization of Sarajevo, which would be 
placed under UN control. In the meantime, the foreign ministers 
of the European Community are asking that the siege of the city 
be lifted using any means possible, including air strikes. 
However, the war is continuing and images of death are 
continuing to arrive from Bosnia. Antonio Foresi reports from 
Brussels. 
  [Foresi] It a was long and difficult debate, where moral 
indignation was not only evident, but also the belief that not 
replying to the massacres taking place in Sarajevo could lead to 
a dangerous future for Europe. The conclusion is this: The 
request that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted immediately, that 
heavy artillery be confiscated from all the warring sides, and 
in order to ensure that this happens the request that any means 
necessary would be used, including air strikes. 
  The European Union has left the task to NATO of serving the 
disarmament ultimatum and ensuring that Sarajevo becomes a 
neutral city under an international administration. The terms 
of the ultimatum, that is the expiry date, the terms and 
intensity of the armed reaction, and the observance of these 
terms by the Serbs and the other sides, will be decided by the 
Atlantic alliance either today or tomorrow. The work will be 
difficult and complex, and must take into account the land 
conditions and the dramatic, complex problems surrounding 
Sarajevo. [passage omitted] 
  We asked Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta if all this 
would be enough to stop the carnage. 
  [Begin Andreatta recording] I believe that we have got off 
on 
the right footing. Naturally as always, when one uses arms or 
has the possibility of using arms, then one is faced with a 
difficult and very painful risk. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The EU [European Union] has raised its voice and 
warned today that it is willing to use force to lift the siege 
on Sarajevo. The task, if carried out, will fall on NATO, which 
is to discuss air strikes at Wednesday's [9 February] meeting. 
Antonio Esteves Martins reports from Brussels. 
  [Martins] Following five hours of difficult discussions, the 
EU's only demand was an end to the siege on Sarajevo. The 
twelve foreign ministers, who do not rule out air strikes 
against Serb positions besieging Sarajevo, have left the final 
decision to the extraordinary meeting of the North Atlantic 
Council. This decision hardly hides the difficulties and the 
difference of opinion between the French, who advocate air 
strikes, and the British who oppose any type of military action. 
  [Begin recording] [Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao 
Barroso] 
The objective cannot be merely revenge, or punishment. It is a 
show of force resulting from our indignation at what appeared to 
us to be a highly condemnable act of violence. It is within 
this context that a decision will have to be taken in close 
consultation with our allies and bearing in mind, above all, the 
opinion of those who have soldiers and considerable forces on 
the ground. [end recording] 
  [Martins] In other words, an ultimatum was not issued today 
as the French wanted, but the use of force was not ruled out. 
Therefore, the message emerging from here could be seen by the 
Bosnian Serbs as a sign of weakness. 
  [Begin recording] [Barroso] We are conscious that this 
position may appear in some way condescending, but I should 
recall that we have always said that this conflict was not an 
easy one, and when a problem is not easy then there are no easy 
solutions either. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Today Monday the European Union has demanded the 
urgent lifting of the siege of Sarajevo, with the use of air 
strikes if they are needed to ensure that this demand is met. 
However, the Bosnian Serbs have not been given an ultimatum. 
After last Saturday's [5 February] shelling of Sarajevo's 
market place and the death of 68 people, the European Union has 
unanimously threatened the Serbs although the action taken by 
the 12 Community countries will have to be expressed in concrete 
terms by the 16 NATO members due to meet this week. Over to our 
correspondent in Brussels, Nacho Hernandez. 
  [Hernandez] Good evening. The European Union has set an aim: 
The siege of the Bosnian capital has to be lifted immediately. 
First Sarajevo. NATO's council has been urgently convened. It 
has to study the military aspects of this operation, as 
requested by the UN secretary general. 
  The press release says that the necessary measures will be 
taken to lift the siege, including air strikes in close 
coordination with the UN secretary general. In short, this is a 
threat of the European Union directed at the Serbs, a threat due 
to be spelled out over the next few hours by NATO, as Foreign 
Minister Javier Solana underlined. 
  [Begin Solana recording] Today it is a political document. 
After the Atlantic alliance meeting there will be a more 
specific decision, and later it will be submitted to the UN 
secretary general who has the ultimate responsibility for 
setting the mechanism in motion. [end recording] 
  [Hernandez] Despite this declaration there are still 
countries among the 12 who are against using force, such as 
Greece. Now it is up to the alliance to study the plans and 
then it will be UN secretary general Butrus-Ghali, who will take 
the decision to start the bombardments in order to end the siege 
of Sarajevo.

  [Excerpts] The foreign ministers of the European Union 
[EU] member countries today appealed for an emergency NATO 
conference to discuss the immediate lifting of the siege on 
Sarajevo using all necessary means, including air raids. The 
decision was made after last Saturday's [5 February] massacre in 
the market place of the Bosnian capital. 
  Following six hours of talks, the EU foreign ministers 
released a brief statement whose contents make it clear that 
efforts were made to reconcile the different views of the 
Europeans as to how the latest crisis should be addressed. 
However, according to our correspondent Ioannis Sinodhinos, 
nothing can be ruled out in the next 48 hours. 
  [Begin recording] [Sinodhinos] The mediators are trying to 
reach an agreement between the belligerent sides in Bosnia to 
demilitarize Sarajevo. [passage omitted] The NATO foreign 
ministers will meet in Brussels either tomorrow or on Wednesday 
to discuss the Bosnian crisis. Greek Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias made a statement after today's meeting of the EU 
foreign ministers. 
  [Papoulias] The question of air raids is one whose 
probabilities and possibilities will be discussed tomorrow at 
the level of NATO permanent representatives. 
  I think that the 12 EU foreign ministers believe that the 
most important thing is for the EU peace plan to survive and be 
promoted. Of course, we need the cooperation of the United 
States and Russia and the result of discussions was really 
[words indistinct], particularly on the problem that any 
military developments would not bring about favorable results.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 7 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic Council 
will "very probably" meet on Tuesday [8 February] or Wednesday 
to discuss UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's request 
for action over Sarajevo, the French Foreign Ministry said on 
Monday. 
  Deputy Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said a 
first informal meeting of the 16 members of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation would be held on Monday to prepare the 
Council meeting. 
  France requested the meeting of NATO's governing body to 
discuss Butrus-Ghali's request that the alliance confirm its 
readiness to launch air strikes against artillery positions 
outside Sarajevo in the wake of Saturday's massacre of civilians. 
  Colonna said the convening of the Council would enable NATO 
to "announce precise, concrete measures" beyond a "simple 
reiteration" of measures the organisation has already adopted. 
  "France will ask the Atlantic Council to issue a clear 
ultimatum" on the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo and the 
"repositioning of Serb and Bosnian heavy artillery" in a radius 
of 30 kilometres (20 miles). 
  Colonna said the ultimatum should be "brief, precise and 
expressed in days." 
  Colonna added that Paris expected Monday's meeting in 
Brussels of the European Community foreign ministers to issue a 
"strong message" giving its full backing to France's efforts 
towards a NATO ultimatum.

strikes, to break the 22-month-old siege of Sarajevo by the 
Bosnian Serbs.

<F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, Feb 8 (AFP) -- While the West moves closer 
towards airstrikes against Bosnia's Serbs, questions remain as 
to the objective of such attacks, their efficacy and whether 
countries are ready to face the consequences. 
  NATO ambassadors were to meet here Wednesday [9 February] 
and, barring a veto by pro-Serb Greece, were likely to authorise 
use of the alliance's warplanes in a punitive action following 
Saturday's bloody mortar attack in Sarajevo. 
  NATO officials said intense consultations on the issue 
continued Tuesday after an informal meeting on Monday. 
  The meeting is in response to a request by UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for NATO backing to deter 
any repetition of the massacre in Sarajevo's central market that 
left 68 people dead and some 200 wounded. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called the carnage a 
"turning point" in Western atitudes towards military action in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. But the prospect of airstrikes was still 
clouded by uncertainty over several points. 
  UN officials who must give the green light for the air raids 
insist they first have to clearly determine who was responsible 
for Saturday's carnage, a judgement experts said was virtually 
impossible. 
  But the bloodiest incident of the 22-month-old war appears 
to 
have stung Western nations into moving ahead with a broader 
purpose: to finally end the siege of the predominantly Moslem 
Bosnian capital. 
  European Community foreign ministers on Monday called for 
the 
immediate lifting of the siege "using all the means necessary, 
including the use of air power." The United States seemed to be 
of the same mind. 
  "We will respond to the specific, rather narrow request of 
Butrus-Ghali but we will not be limited by that," U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher said Monday. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has already offered 
its warplanes to end the strangulation of Moslem communities, 
provide "close air support" to endangered UN troops and reopen 
Tuzla airport in northeastern Bosnia. 
  But Butrus-Ghali has so far refused to give clearance for 
such operations amid fears they could provoke reprisals against 
the 10,000-strong UN force on the ground and bring the 
humanitarian effort to a halt. 
  Beyond such considerations is the question of how effective 
bombing the Serbs would be. Military experts say that close air 
support for ground troops is feasible, offensive bombing raids 
is another matter. 
  They say air power could take out stationary artillery 
positions but would be unable to eliminate the big guns or the 
highly mobile mortars if the Serbs moved them around in the 
hills surrounding Sarajevo. 
  A NATO military source said ground troops and weapons would 
be needed to secure the hills but the 16-member alliance has 
done no planning for such an eventuality. 
  He saw little likelihood of adding more troops to the 2,900 
currently in the capital, most of them French. France has been 
the only nation willing to up its contribution significantly to 
protect the UN-designated "safe area." 
  No country has shown the stomach for a full-scale military 
action to bring peace which German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said 
would require hundreds of thousands of troops with no guarantee 
of success. 
  NATO leaders, seeking to restore their battered credibility, 
renewed their airstrike threats last month and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and French President Francois Mitterrand said that 
this time they better be ready for action. 
  France proposed this week giving the Serbs an ultimatum to 
distance their big guns from Sarajevo. Britain, the other major 
contributor to UN troops in Bosnia, appeared to shed some its 
earlier reluctance to call in air raids. 
  But differences remained among the allies, with little 
enthusiasm apparent at the EC meeting for setting a deadline for 
the Serbs. Countries such as Spain and Denmark stressed the need 
to keep peace negotiations on track. 
  Greece, the current president of the 12-member community, 
warned that airstrikes could unleash a wider war throughout the 
Balkans and threatened to veto the move at the NATO meeting, 
which works on consensus. 
  Under the new threat of airstrikes, the Serbs are now 
willing 
to discuss demilitarisation of Sarajevo even before a global 
settlement. But analysts said the Serbs have appeared to give 
ground before, only to harden once the danger has receded.

  [Text] Vicenza, Italy, Feb 7 (AFP) -- A NATO air wing has 
taken the "necessary steps" to carry out air raids in Bosnia 
should they be decided on, a spokesman for NATO's Southern 
Command, squadron-leader John Jeffery said Monday [7 February]. 
  Jeffery said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
(NATO) "has been ready since July 22" and that the Southern 
Command had been "conducting the plannings required by the NATO 
council in respect of air strikes." 
  However, he could make "no comment at this stage" on reports 
that the number of sorties by NATO aircraft over Sarajevo had 
increased in recent days in response to the latest massacres 
there. 
  NATO's Southern Command has been responsible for 
implementing 
Operation Deny Flight since April 12 last. The aim of this 
operation is to prevent all flights over Bosnian airspace in 
accordance with UN Resolution 816. 
  According to a statement from NATO, its aircraft carried out 
11,114 missions over Bosnia in the period between April 12 and 
February 6,935 of them involving combat aircraft. 
  The Atlantic alliance has 170 aircraft at its disposal to 
implement Deny Flight. These include 80 warplanes, many of them 
designed for ground attack work, belonging to the Air Forces of 
the United States, Turkey and the Netherlands. These are 
stationed in nine different airbases around Italy. 
  Among these combat aircraft are 10 French Mirage 2000's 
based 
in Cervia on Italy's Adriatic coast, eight French Jaguars in 
Rivolto, 12 F-16 and eight F-18's belonging to the U.S. Air 
Force stationed in Aviana, near Venice, eight Tornados and eight 
Jaguars of the Royal Air Force based in Gioia del Colle, 
opposite the coast of Montenegro, and ten Turkish F-16's, also 
based in Italy. 
  In addition, NATO can call on other warplanes based in their 
home countries, or on aircraft carriers. The USS Saratoga, for 
example, can supply 18 F-18's or F-14's, and the French carrier 
Clemenceau six super-Etendard bombers. 
  NATO said that the exclusion zone over Bosnia had been 
violated 250 times by helicopters between last April and 
October, but that airplane flights had practically ceased. 
  In the six months before Deny Flight had come into effect, 
Bosnian airspace had been violated over 500 times.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Willy Claes: `This Is a Bridge too </F>
Far'"] 
  [Text] "I have here before me a report from the UN 
commander in Bosnia, British General Michael Rose, in which he 
makes it clear he has no doubt that the Serbs are responsible 
for Saturday's [5 February] mortar attack," said Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes in an interview with DE MORGEN. Yesterday 
afternoon, Rose said that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
inquiry could not determine from where the mortar shell 
originated. According to Minister Claes, that is not really 
relevant. "Obviously I have nothing against an extra inquiry 
into who was responsible. But to my mind it no longer has 
anything to do with Saturday's incident. Last Friday 10 people 
died in a mortar attack for which the Serbs were clearly 
responsible. This is a matter of principle: The strangulation 
of Sarajevo must be brought to an end. The Serbs must disappear 
from the hills around Sarajevo." Foreign Minister Claes's plea 
for air strikes against Serbian positions was by far the most 
resolute of those heard yesterday. American Defense Secretary 
William Perry, who after two days in his new job has already 
been forced to make statements about the thorny Bosnia issue, 
recalled a few of America's earlier positions. "Air strikes 
will certainly be considered," said Perry in Munich, where he 
attended a two-day conference on security in Europe. "President 
Clinton said that we should not allow Sarajevo to be strangled. 
If Saturday's action were to be considered as the strangulation 
of Sarajevo, and if we could not do anything about it, then we 
would certainly consider firm action, including air strikes." 
Claes no longer believes in U.S. declarations. "This is no 
longer a purely political problem, but an ethical and moral 
problem. The mass murder must stop. Either the Serbs adopt 
another attitude, or air forces will have to be sent in. This 
is a question of making those guys disappear from the hills. If 
they do not want to hear that, then they should feel it. Then 
the people in Belgrade might think twice." 
  According to Claes, the criticism that air strikes will 
endanger UN troops on the ground is no reason not to make plans 
for air strikes. "Naturally, at the same time measures will 
have to be taken to guarantee the safety of UN troops." 
Military plans have been drawn up to this effect." Claes 
stressed that his viewpoint is nothing new, and the Belgian 
Government had already pleaded, before the start of the NATO 
summit on 10 January, for air strikes if the warring factions 
could not reach a settlement. "I myself have always belonged to 
a moderate wing," said Claes. "I am one of those who can be 
extremely patient. However, in history there are times when 
moral values take priority. There are limits below which people 
must not drop, and over the past week we have dropped below 
these limits." When the foreign ministers of the Twelve meet 
today in Brussels, Sarajevo will undoubtedly be on the agenda. 
Minister Claes will not fail to advocate a strong European 
position on air strikes. "Following numerous contacts, I am 
hopeful that the European Union (EU) will take a vigorous 
position," said Claes. "Hopefully it will be of such a nature to 
make our NATO partners and the United Nations see the light. In 
the meantime, I will support my decision where I can." In this 
connection, Claes wanted to urge those EU member states that are 
also members of the Security Council to take a European 
initiative. "Today again I will try to contact my counterparts 
Alain Juppe, Douglas Hurd, and Javier Solana and urge them to 
take initiatives in New York in order to convince Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali that there is no time left to lose."

  [Text] Ottawa, Feb 6 (AFP) -- Canada expressed outrage 
Sunday [6 February] over the Sarajevo marketplace attack that 
killed scores of civilians and left nearly 200 injured. 
  Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet described Saturday's attack 
as 
the "deliberate killing and wounding of hundreds of innocent 
civilians." 
  He added, "This latest atrocity underscores the urgent need 
for concerted international action to prevent further violence 
against the innocent civilian population of Sarajevo." 
  Ouellet said he had consulted with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd on 
Sunday about a response to the attack.

  [Text] Prime Minister Jean Chretien and other Canadian 
cabinet members say they want time to weigh options before 
deciding whether to support (?a) call for air strikes against 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  The call for the NATO-led strike was made by the UN 
secretary 
general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, after 68 civilians were killed and 
almost 200 others were wounded in a mortar attack on a Sarajevo 
market place on Saturday [5 February]. 
  Mr. Chretien says Ottawa wants to consult its NATO allies 
and 
to obtain a report from Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia, before 
reaching its decision. 
  A primary consideration for Ottawa is the safety of Canada's 
2,400 peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia, but Mr. Chretien 
told the House of Commons that the situation in Bosnia is very, 
very bad, and that a decision may be taken in the next few days. 
  The United States and the European Union support the call by 
Mr. Butrus-Ghali, but Russia has signalled strong opposition to 
any attack.

<F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F>
reporter] 
  [Text] Britain is ready to use airpower to end the 
bombardment of Sarajevo, Foreign Office Minister Alastair 
Goodlad signalled in the Commons today. 
  Answering an emergency question, Mr Goodlad said the 
Government awaited the assessment of military commanders on the 
spot. 
  But he said ministers were "fully prepared to see air power 
used if it will improve the situation." 
  Mr Goodlad spoke out after the weekend massacre of 68 people 
in Sarajevo market place. 
  Echoing the Prime Minister's call this morning for 
immediate, 
effective and "more muscular" action to halt the bombardment of 
civilians in Sarajevo, he said: "We're looking for effective 
action, if necessary muscular action, to protect the civilian 
population of Sarajevo." 
  Shadow foreign secretary Dr Jack Cunningham said if the 
Serbs 
and Croats did not immediately accept and implement decisions of 
the international community then NATO's "vastly superior air 
power" should be used. 
  The Commons exchanges, on an emergency question from Dr 
Cunningham, came as European Union foreign ministers met to 
consider the implications of military intervention in the bloody 
conflict. 
  Mr Goodlad expressed "horror and outrage" over the weekend 
massacre, adding: "The Government condemns this brutal and 
senseless act." 
  He underlined the need for a negotiated peace but added that 
action over the plight of those living in Sarajevo could not 
await an overall settlement. 
  "It is essential that the UN and NATO should consider 
immediately practical means for halting the bombardment of 
civilians there." 
  Supporting the use of airpower, he said: "The Government 
remains determined that everything possible is done to ensure 
that this appalling conflict is brought to an end as soon as 
possible." 
  Dr Cunningham joined in condemning the market place 
atrocity. 
  "But doesn't recent history in the former Yugoslavia show 
that Western policy is in disarray over these problems," he said. 
  "The record is one of failure to prevent atrocities 
resulting 
in wanton slaughter." 
  Dr Cunningham said UN Security Council resolutions and NATO 
decisions had consistently not been implemented. 
  They were seen as "empty threats" by the Serbs and Croats 
"and so their aggression and carnage continues." 
  He said: "Indecision over Britain's proposed troop 
withdrawal 
has further encouraged Serbs and Croatians to believe their 
aggression would not only be ignored but rewarded with 
territorial gain. 
  "And, tragically for all of us, the EU bears the principle 
responsibility for this catastrophe." 
  He asked if the Government would immediately press for the 
reopening of Tuzla airport and the lifting of the seige at 
Sarajevo. 
  "Do you agree that if the Serbs and Croatians do not 
immediately accept and allow the implementation of these 
decision of the international community, then they should be 
enforced by use of the vastly superior airpower of NATO?" 
  Mr Goodlad said UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command with 
NATO support must apply the pressure necessary to halt the 
attacks. 
  "If the military commanders advise this requires technical 
air support, we shall back their judgment." 
  It was essential that Tuzla airport should be reopened and 
NATO airpower was available if needed. 
  He said military commanders at NATO, the UN and in the UK 
had 
consistently advised that a "generalised policy of air strikes 
would not end the war" and could hamper humanitarian relief. 
  "But in specific situations, the technical use of airpower 
can help to achieve defined objectives. 
  "NATO will consider on Wednesday how that airpower might be 
used. 
  "We await the assessment of military commanders but are 
fully 
prepared to see airpower used if it will improve the situation."

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense Correspondent </F>
in Munich] 
  [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind warned tonight 
that military power might be used in Bosnia following the 
carnage in Sarajevo, which he labelled a ghastly act of 
terrorism. 
  But he stressed that the military option had a huge 
price-tag 
attached with severe implications for the humanitarian aid 
effort. 
  He arrives in Bosnia tomorrow and is due to fly immediately 
to Sarajevo aboard an RAF Hercules for urgent talks with the new 
UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose. 
  "What one needs to do is to hear from the UN military 
commanders on the spot whether they believe there is any useful 
way in which the UN, by military means or any other way, can 
help try to prevent a repetition of this ghastly incident," he 
said. 
  Speaking after a meeting of NATO defence ministers in 
Munich, 
he said: "We are all conscious of that fact that our prime duty 
in Sarajevo at the present time is seeking to ensure the people 
there get the sustenance they require. 
  "If there are any initiatives of a military kind that the 
military are able to recommend as being relevant, then clearly 
that is something we would have to listen to very carefully." 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton indicated tonight that air 
strikes on Serb positions was one of the options that would have 
to be looked at. 
  But Mr. Rifkind emphasised it was essential first to find 
out 
from the UN commanders on the ground whether responsibility for 
the marketplace attack can be definitely pinned on the Serbs. 
  "Whether the military role can be increased and enhanced is 
a 
very difficult and painful decision," he said. 
  "First, we have to hear the views of the military in Bosnia. 
We have to be certain that any military initiatives are capable 
of providing the solution we want to see. Otherwise, we would 
be exposing our troops to unacceptable risk to their own lives." 
  And he insisted: "The military option has a huge price tag 
attached to it with implications for the whole humanitarian 
operation." 
  Sir Michael has adopted what he calls a "very hardline, 
hardnosed approach" to ensuring humanitarian aid gets through. 
  He has promised the UN forces will be much more 
"tough-minded" in refusing to be turned back by the warring 
factions. 
  And Mr. Rifkind revealed that the general, a former head of 
the SAS, had the full backing of the British Government. 
  "Sir Michael is taking a very robust approach to these 
matters and he has the full and unqualified support of the 
British Government in the way which he is approaching his 
responsibilities," said Mr. Rifkind. 
  "What has often been a cause for concern are the delays that 
have taken place and the extent to which small numbers of 
persons from one or other of the factions have been able to hold 
up aid. 
  "I think the attitude of the new commander will help deal 
with that particular matter." 
  But he repeated there was no easy answer to the crisis 
facing 
Bosnia, particularly Sarajevo. 
  "Today's attack was an example essentially of terrorism," he 
said. "We know about terrorism in the UK and we know there are 
no simple answers. 
  "I don't think people in Britain or elsewhere believe we can 
simply end this civil war by external military involvement. We 
have seen the problems in Somalia." 
  Britain is due to make a final decision next month whether 
to 
keep troops in Bosnia to help the humanitarian aid effort and Mr 
Rifkind's two-day fact-finding mission will be crucial.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent, </F>
aboard HMS Coventry in the Adriatic] 
  [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind tonight did not 
rule out allied air strikes to destroy Serb positions around 
Sarajevo but is expected to urge caution when he meets the Prime 
Minister tomorrow. 
  He warned that the political will to take action must be 
combined with sound military judgment. 
  There are widespread fears that air strikes could simply 
persuade the Serbs to attack British and other UN troops on the 
ground and destroy the humanitarian aid effort. 
  Fearing the "indirect consequences" of military action, Mr 
Rifkind underlined the urgent need for the humanitarian 
operation, which is saving thousands of lives, to continue. 
  And he warmly praised the robust, hard-nosed approach by the 
new United Nations commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Sir 
Michael Rose, which was proving very effective. 
  Mr Major has called an urgent Cabinet committee meeting for 
tomorrow afternoon with Mr Rifkind, Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd and other senior ministers to discuss the Bosnia crisis, 
following the shelling of the Sarajevo marketplace which killed 
68 people and injured 200. 
  But Mr Rifkind sidestepped questions about the French 
proposal that the Serbs should be told to pull back artillery 
batteries out of range of Sarajevo or face the threat of air 
strikes. 
  Speaking aboard the frigate HMS Coventry off the Croatian 
coast after a two-day visit to ground forces in Bosnia, Mr 
Rifkind acknowledged air strikes could have advantages. 
  "If it was to lead to the shortening of the war or an 
improvement for the people of Sarajevo it cannot be ruled out," 
he said. 
  "But because it could have serious implications for the 
humanitarian operation and UN troops it is not an issue that can 
be resolved easily." 
  And he stressed that airpower alone had never brought any 
conflict in history to an end -- not even the Gulf War. 
  He said: "You have to combine political will with sound 
military judgment or you are going to do no good whatsoever for 
the people of Bosnia." 
  He said he had received a clear message from the British 
troops in Bosnia that the aid is getting through to the needy 
and that they are anxious for the operation to continue. 
  Sir Michael's tough interpretation of the UN mandate was 
helping to remove the frustration and delay UN forces have had 
to suffer with small numbers of people halting aid convoys. 
  "It is very encouraging to see the impact this is having," 
said Mr Rifkind. "This illustrates that the mandate does enable 
those in charge to do even more than has been done in the past." 
  This was the clearest indication yet that Britain will 
decide 
to keep its troops in Bosnia when a final decision is made next 
month.

<F P=106> [By Peter Mackler] </F>
  [Excerpts] Brussels, Feb 9 (AFP) -- NATO sought agreement 
among its members Wednesday [9 February] to give the Bosnian 
Serbs a deadline to lift the siege of Sarajevo or face air 
strikes by the alliance's warplanes, diplomats said. 
  As NATO ambassadors met here, diplomats said that Canada was 
the main opponent of a U.S.-French proposal to threaten bombing 
raids if the Serbs do not withdraw their big guns from Sarejevo 
in seven to 10 days. 
  Pro-Serb Greece has also come out strongly against the use 
of 
air strikes, but reluctantly went along with a European 
Community statement Monday to back the option to free Sarajevo 
from the Serbs' grip. 
  Meanwhile Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev warned 
Wednesday that air strikes on Bosnia's Serbs would have "grave 
consequences" in a telegram to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  The alliance was considering action following Saturday's 
mortar attack on Sarajevo's market, which killed 68 people in 
the worst single incident in the 22-month old conflict. 
  "It is time to act. We had enough words," NATO Secretary 
General Manfred Woerner said after months of empty threats that 
have left the credibility of the West's Bosnia policy in tatters. 
  The United States favoured a seven-day deadline for the 
Serbs 
while the French, who have UN troops on the ground protecting 
relief operations, are proposing a 10-day limit, one NATO 
diplomat said. [passage omitted] 
  Any action by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
requires 
the unanimous approval of all 16 alliance members. The NATO 
diplomat said it would also need a final clearance from the 
United Nations. 
  Diplomats said Britain had also presented a proposal with 
the 
main difference being over at what level to take a decision on 
airstrikes. They gave no details. 
  A Western diplomat said Canada, which has expressed fears of 
reprisals against Canadian and other troops in the 10,000-strong 
UN force, had put forth a text backing the idea of a deadline 
but much more vague on any action to follow. 
  Diplomats said NATO would likely avoid using the word 
ultimatum in their message to the Serbs. EC foreign ministers 
on Monday rejected the French proposal for a deadline and kept 
their call for air power vague. 
  "Most of the members are coalescing around the French-U.S. 
proposal," said the diplomat, who asked not to be named. 
Another NATO source said "a majority, not everybody" supported 
the idea of a precise warning to the Serbs. [passage omitted] 
  In August, the alliance authorised the use of its warplanes 
to end the strangulation of Sarajevo and other Serb-besieged 
Moslem communities if requested by the United Nations. 
  NATO leaders reaffirmed the offer at their summit last 
month. 
  But Butrus-Ghali has yet to give the green light for any air 
operations by NATO, which has 170 aircraft, including 80 
warplanes, already deployed to enforce a no-flight zone over 
Bosnia.

<F P=106> [By Michel Moutot] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 8 (AFP) -- Western countries 
pondering whether to launch air strikes against Bosnia's Serbs 
would have trouble taking out all the heavy weaponry around 
Sarajevo, a high-ranking UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection 
Force] officer said here Tuesday [8 February]. 
  "The moment the first raid takes place, it must be clear 
that 
the level of engagement for all UN peacekeepers stationed in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will change in nature," the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) officer, who declined to be identified, said. 
  His comments came on the eve of a meeting in Brussels of 
NATO 
ambassadors who, barring a veto by pro-Serb Greece, were likely 
to authorise use of the alliance's warplanes in a punitive 
action following Saturday's massacre in Sarajevo in which 68 
people died and about 200 were injured. 
  The UNPROFOR officer said that for months, some 60 UN 
military observers and thousands of pictures taken by NATO 
planes have identified the precise position of Serb forces 
around the capital. 
  He said the latest UNPROFOR figures show that the Serbs have 
about 300 artillery pieces within range of the capital, meaning 
30 kilometres (18 miles), and most of the weapons are stationed 
southeast of Sarajevo. 
  The figure includes cannon, which are in fixed positions, 
and 
mortars which can be moved around. 
  The UNPROFOR officer said that even though NATO warplanes 
would be able to zero in on all of the big guns stationed around 
the Bosnian capital, it would be a different matter in terms of 
locating the mortars. 
  "A mortar consists of a simple tube on a 60-kilogram 
(130-pound) metal plate and all you need is two men and a pickup 
truck," he said. "And in order to wipe out the mortars you 
would need tactical air support which means war, and our current 
mandate does not call for such action." 
  He added that in addition to the mortars, the Serbs 
besieging 
the city also have multiple rocket launchers that are mobile and 
powerful. 
  In terms of manpower, the Serbs are said to have about 
15,000 
soldiers stationed around Sarajevo, while the mainly Moslem 
Bosnian army has 13,000 troops with access to 150 artillery 
pieces. 
  "Lifting a siege and using only air strikes is possible but 
one must destroy everything," the UNPROFOR officer said. "If we 
launch air strikes we can't give up afterwards because they will 
come back and recapture their positions." 
  He said such strikes would also mean that the UN mandate in 
Bosnia would no longer be to provide humanitarian assistance but 
to reestablish peace. 
  "The politicians must decide what they want," he said, 
adding 
that the latest threats to bomb the Serbs amounted to a lot of 
"gesturing." 
  He pointed out that similar previous attempts to intimidate 
the Serbs were met with threats to retaliate against UN 
peacekeepers on the ground and to stop all humanitarian aid.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 8 (AFP) -- NATO leaders could well 
decide finally to unblock the international stalemate over air 
strikes in Bosnia at a crucial meeting on Wednesday [9 
February], a source close to the defence alliance said Tuesday. 
  "I'm very optimistic. I believe this time NATO is seen as 
the organisation who holds the key," said the source. "The UN 
and the European Community are asking us to take action. If we 
do not take action, we paralyse the international community." 
  The comments came after North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
ambassadors held "intense" consultations on the possibility of 
airstrikes against the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo in the wake 
of the weekend massacre of 68 people in a Sarajevo market. 
  The NATO ambassadors, who could take a decision on the issue 
on Wednesday, are considering a request by UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali for action to deter any repetition of the 
mortar attack 
  NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Silvio Balanzino 
earlier 
said: "As to air strikes I will have a very definite and clear 
answer tomorrow. Stay tuned as they say on TV.... At this 
stage, I can't say anything more." 
  Although upbeat, the source added the ambassadors would also 
study the "wider implications" of such air strikes, and would 
consider in particular a proposal by France for an ultimatum to 
be put to the Bosnian Serbs. 
  France has said it would press for an ultimatum giving the 
Serbs a few days to pull back their heavy guns from the 
predominently Moslem Bosnian capital, even if the idea was 
rejected by the EC ministers. 
  The idea was opposed by Britain, Greece and Spain here on 
Monday, although it was supported by Belgium, Italy and the 
Netherlands at a meeting of European Community foreign ministers. 
  Any decision on air strikes must be taken unanimously by the 
North Atlantic Council, NATO's executive body. 
  Sources close to the alliance added that NATO Secretary 
General Manfred Woerner, convalescing from surgery, may give a 
press conference Wednesday on the outcome of the ambassadors' 
meeting. 
  In August, NATO authorised the use of its warplanes to end 
the strangulation of Sarajevo and other Serb-besieged Moslem 
communities if requested by the United Nations. 
  But the pro-Serb Socialist government in Greece, which took 
power in October, says airstrikes could trigger a wider Balkans 
war and is threatening to veto the move since NATO operates on 
consensus. 
  NATO currently has 170 aircraft, including 80 warplanes, 
deployed to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia. But it faced 
tough decisions in considering whether to unleash them against 
the Serbs. 
  Although Butrus-Ghali sought authorisation for a punitive 
strike as a deterrent to future shelling, European Community 
foreign ministers on Monday backed the use of air power to lift 
the siege of Sarajevo immediately. 
  The United States has also signaled its support for wider 
action beyond what US Secretary of State Warren Christoper 
called the "rather narrow request" of the UN chief.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The Russian Foreign Ministry 
has accused the United Nations of overstepping its mandate by 
asking NATO if it would launch air strikes against Serb 
positions in Bosnia. These air strikes are also at the center 
of debate in Belgium. Defense Minister Leo Delcroix expressed 
reservations yesterday evening despite the fact that Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes was clearly in favor. Jean-Pierre 
Jacquemin interviewed the foreign minister: 
  [Begin recording] [Claes] I had several phone conversations 
during the weekend with the prime minister as well as with my 
colleague the defense minister. 
  [Jacquemin] Leo Delcroix has in fact expressed reservations 
regarding these air strikes. He justified his position by the 
presence in Bosnia of Belgian troops, who would be threatened if 
air strikes were launched. 
  [Claes] I understand that the defense minister is worried 
about the security of the peacekeeping troops. He is only doing 
his duty. But I am a bit puzzled by the warning given by some 
military experts. These air strikes were agreed upon by the UN 
Security Council more than a year ago. I suppose the military 
experts were asked to give their opinion at that time. 
  [Jacquemin] Are there any differences between you and Leo 
Delcroix within the government? 
  [Claes] No, I don't think so. The politician should 
sometimes make risky decisions. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kooijmans Waiting For EU Talks on </F>
Bosnia"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- Foreign Minister Kooijmans is in favor 
of NATO bombings on positions outside Sarajevo. However, he 
made a final decision dependent on the meeting of the European 
Union's foreign ministers in Brussels today, and on a decision 
of NATO's permanent council this afternoon. 
  This was stated by a Foreign Ministry's spokesman this 
morning. According to Dutch diplomats in Brussels, Kooijmans 
reportedly is willing to endorse a French plan to impose an 
ultimatum on the Bosnian Serbs, urging them to take up positions 
further away from Sarajevo, so that they can no longer shell the 
city. The Bosnians' and Serbs' heavy weapons must be collected 
in one place. If they refuse, air strikes will follow. In 
Brussels, it is expected that NATO's foreign ministers will also 
talk about air actions above Bosnia. 
  The Netherlands has taken this position of "action wherever 
necessary" since the Security Council's resolution of 4 June 
1993 to protect the "safe areas" from the air, and since NATO's 
decision of 2 and 9 August last year, when NATO decided to 
provide air support and to proceed to air strikes, if the 
population in the "safe areas" was threatened by bombings or 
armed attacks. NATO can also provide air support, if UN troops 
can no longer perform their task in the "safe areas." 
  Kooijmans said that he was deeply shocked by the bloodbath 
in 
Sarajevo. On Thursday, he called for a greater effort from the 
United States to give the peace negotiations on Bosnia a new 
impulse. He told Parliament, that he fears for new outbursts of 
violence, unless a peace settlement is reached soon. The 
Netherlands also appealed to its allies not to withdraw the UN's 
peacekeeping forces for now. In March, it will be decided how 
the UN troops' mandate can be adjusted.

<F P=106> [Report by George Jones, political editor: "Britain Is </F>
Ready, Major Confirms"] 
  [Text] Mr Major signalled the Government's readiness last 
night to support a NATO ultimatum -- backed up by the threat of 
air strikes -- for the withdrawal of Serbian guns shelling 
Sarajevo. 
  Shortly before an emergency meeting of the Cabinet's 
Overseas 
and Defence Committee to consider the options for military 
intervention, Mr Major told MPs the Government was prepared to 
see air power used "provided the commanders judge it 
appropriate." 
  But he stressed at question-time in the Commons: 
"Ultimately, 
peace is only going to come at the negotiating table." 
  Mr Major summoned senior ministers, including Mr Rifkind, 
Defence Secretary, who returned from visiting British troops in 
Bosnia yesterday, to Downing Street last night. 
  They were briefed by the military chiefs of staff on the 
feasibility of air strikes to destroy Serbian guns which have 
been bombarding Sarajevo and are thought to have been 
responsible for the weekend's market massacre. 
  Britain has previously adopted a cautious approach towards 
air strikes, fearing they would not prevent the shelling while 
leaving United Nations soldiers, including the British 
contingent of 3,000, open to reprisals from the Bosnian Serb 
forces. 
  But ministers believe events have reached a "turning point" 
and that the UN's credibility will be damaged if it does not 
intervene to prevent the slaughter in Sarajevo. Military 
chiefs, while still dubious about the effectiveness of 
intervention, acknowledge that there may now be overriding 
diplomatic reasons to threaten air strikes. 
  Mr Major acknowledged that the mortar and artillery attacks 
on Sarajevo could not await an overall settlement. 
  The UN forces in Bosnia, with support from NATO, had to 
apply 
immediate and strong pressure to halt those attacks. 
  The UN, he said, might need to use force for specific 
purposes, to carry out its mandate and protect its own people in 
Bosnia. "It may need tactical air support from NATO. We have 
always been prepared to see air power used for these purposes, 
provided the commanders judge it appropriate." 
  Mr Major said NATO would meet today to consider what 
pressure 
can most effectively be applied. But he stressed that if air 
power was used, they must be very clear about the objectives of 
that action. 
  The meeting of the Cabinet's Overseas and Defence Committee 
lasted two hours 20 minutes, much longer than expected. 
  Although ministers agreed to back NATO plans for an 
ultimatum to the Serbs, there was a lengthy discussion over 
contingency plans for ensuring the protection of British and 
other UN troops in Bosnia against possible reprisals.

  [Text] Erfurt, 8 Feb (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel has urged Germany to remain cautious in considering 
air strikes against Serbian targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "As 
far as military deployment in the former Yugoslavia is 
concerned, we Germans are the worst advisers," Kinkel told the 
Erfurt THUERINGER ALLGEMEINE (Wednesday edition). One should 
await tomorrow's NATO session. Kinkel also appealed to the 
Social Democratic Party to give up its opposition to changing 
the Basic Law on the issue of out-of-area deployment of the 
Bundeswehr. Otherwise, he feared, "Germany would be harmed if 
we have to carry on behaving as we do now in such crises."

Bruessel; place and date not given: "Ruehe: Weapons for 
Bosnian Muslims!"] 
  [Text] [Bruessel] Will air strikes now become more likely 
[in Bosnia]? 
  [Ruehe] The United Nations has to decide whether and how it 
wants to punish the culprits. If necessary, the humanitarian 
measures have to be temporarily suspended. It is not enough to 
protect the UN troops. The protection of the population is far 
more urgent, and it requires a different strategy than before. 
  [Bruessel] What can Germany do? 
  [Ruehe] I have advocated for a long time that the Bosnian 
Muslims be armed so that they can better defend themselves. 
Germany will not recognize borders that are changed by force. 
The aggressor will not get a single mark for reconstruction. 
Now we are supporting vigorously the decisionmaking process of 
the United Nations, NATO, and the European Union. We agree with 
Washington on what has to be done. 
  [Bruessel] How can the Bundeswehr participate in a NATO 
mission? 
  [Ruehe] For months, our Luftwaffe has been taking food and 
medicine to Sarajevo and eastern Bosnia every day. Our ships 
and aircraft have been helping to enforce the embargo. The 
unclarified constitutional issue does not permit more. 
Moreover, the participation of German soldiers in a NATO combat 
mission would complicate the conflict rather than help to solve 
it. 
  [Bruessel] Is NATO unable to act? 
  [Ruehe] The UN Security Council must now show that it is 
able to act resolutely, quickly, and responsibly. It would be 
unfair to criticize NATO since only the United Nations can make 
the decision.

  [Text] Below is the text of the statement made by Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe on Sunday 6 February. 
  "The massacre perpetrated on Saturday 5 February in Sarajevo 
market is a turning point in the Bosnian drama. No one can fail 
to be disturbed by what we have witnessed. The international 
community would have to hang its head in shame if it were to let 
such an act of barbarism occur again. A UN inquiry is underway 
to determine the source of the attack. However, our reaction 
must not be conditioned by the results of the inquiry. What is 
important is that we make a fresh attack impossible, that is, by 
putting an end to the siege of Sarajevo. 
  "Since yesterday, and with the agreement of the president of 
the republic and the prime minister, we have been consulting 
with our partners -- the U.S. secretary of state, our partners 
in the European Union, and, above all, those countries with 
troops on the ground. 
  "A consensus has been reached to convene the North Atlantic 
Council as soon as possible. At this meeting, France will push 
for the following ultimatum to be put to the belligerents in the 
clearest terms possible: 
  "1) The siege of Sarajevo must be lifted, meaning that all 
Serbian troops must pull back to a distance making renewed 
shelling of the town materially impossible. In particular, all 
Serbian and Bosnian heavy weapons in a radius of 30 km around 
the town must be placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
control. This measure will be the first stage in establishing 
UN administration over Sarajevo, one of the components of the 
European Union peace plan which was accepted in principle by all 
parties. 
  "2) If these two requirements are not met by a deadline set 
by the allies, all resources, including air force, must be 
implemented to enforce them. 
  "3) The means of implementing this action, if it is adopted 
by NATO, will be defined and applied in consultation with the 
United Nations and its secretary general." 
  For his part, Defense Minister Francois Leotard said in a 
statement: "At present (...) it is not possible to determine 
the origin of firing. This emphasizes, moreover, the extreme 
difficulty of managing this crisis militarily, if this were 
necessary. However, we all agree that it is the siege itself 
that is the cause of all these deaths. Today, Sarajevo has a 
death toll of approximately 10,000. This siege cannot be 
tolerated and we must put an end to it (...). 
  "The use of force, whether in the air, at sea, or on the 
ground, for us has always been secondary to a political 
settlement. Air strikes, which are of course the subject of so 
many comments, are not in themselves or by themselves a 
response. They are and remain a tool for making reason heard. 
We have never, and even less today than yesterday, abandoned 
this method. I remind you that the 3,000 soldiers on the ground 
in Sarajevo, some 75 percent of whom are French, are on a 
humanitarian protection mission based on a series of UN 
resolutions. We regularly see them carrying out their mission 
with exceptional bravery and self-sacrifice, and I want to again 
stress this point to you. I merely note today that, from now 
on, their task will be made even more difficult than before."

<F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
correspondent Patrick Poivre d'Arvor -- live] 
  [Text] [d'Arvor] Good evening Alain Juppe. This question 
that Bill Clinton seems to raise [quoting the correspondent in 
the video report on Clinton wondering whether France is really 
committed to air strikes in Bosnia], I will put it to you again: 
Are the French ready? 
  [Juppe] I already answered this question on Sunday [6 
February] afternoon in the company of Francois Leotard [minister 
of state for defense], when I said that France wanted an 
ultimatum to be given in order to obtain the lifting of the 
siege in Sarajevo. When one says ultimatum, one says force must 
be used if conditions are not met. So we are ready. I would 
like to add a word: When I say this, I say it with all the 
seriousness it implies. I hear a lot of advice these days. We 
are told we should hit back, we should be firm. I do not 
believe I have been suspected of being weak since the start of 
the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia. Striking means putting 
the population and our soldiers at risk. As you can understand, 
a member of the government, like any French citizen, thinks 
first about our soldiers. In life, there are those with 
positions of responsibility and those who exhort. Exhorting is 
easy, deciding is more difficult. We are ready to decide. 
  [d'Arvor] For the moment things have not been that easy, 
first, vis-a-vis your European allies, as they have been slow to 
respond. The word ultimatum was not used yesterday, will it be 
used tomorrow perhaps? 
  [Juppe] No ultimatum was given but a demand for the lifting 
of the siege on Sarajevo was made. It was affirmed that all 
means should be used, including air strikes. Therefore, I think 
the decision of the Twelve -- even if we had to work hard with 
those who were more reluctant -- goes in the right direction. 
Tomorrow, during the meeting of the Atlantic Council, you 
mentioned a short while ago that France's position will be very 
clear. We will ask for a precise and strong reaction. We 
cannot let last Sunday's massacre in Sarajevo go by without 
reacting clearly and strongly. 
  [d'Arvor] So a fresh incident is not expected? 
  [Juppe] Surely not. If tomorrow, the Council of the Atlantic 
Alliance does not agree or if it only embarks on a fresh 
exercise in exhortation, saying: Watch it! You will see what 
we will do next time! France will not be associated with such a 
decision. 
  [d'Arvor] So this means it [France] will eventually decide 
on 
its own on the air strikes? 
  [Juppe] Obviously not. We neither have the law [on our side] 
nor the strength. But we will not continue [subscribing] to 
this situation -- to which, I hope, I will go back to in a 
moment -- we will not continue to put the lives of our soldiers 
and their reputation in danger. They are being criticized at 
the moment. It is said that because they are in Sarajevo, 
strikes are not possible. This situation would be unbearable if 
it were to continue. This is not likely -- as I said earlier, 
why? 
  We have done a lot of work with our allies, in particular 
with the Americans, and I think that tomorrow morning we will be 
able to present a joint position to the Council of the Alliance, 
in particular between the United States and France, which would 
demand the lifting of the siege. It would mean specifically: 
The withdrawal of the attacking, or besieging troops to a 
distance of 20-30 km, so that they cannot repeat what they have 
done, wherever the firing came from, that they cannot repeat 
what we saw in those terrible, unbearable, pictures. 
  Then we will demand that all heavy arms in this area be 
placed under United Nations control, and we will say very 
clearly -- or at least this is what we will propose -- that if 
these demands are not satisfied within a few days, the batteries 
remaining in the zone will be the object of air strikes. 
  I think that is a very clear position, and I repeat the 
answer I gave you just now: France is ready to face up to the 
risks. The president, the prime minister, the minister of 
defense, and I myself have held discussions, and this decision 
has been taken. 
  [d'Arvor] If you are speaking of Franco-American decisions, 
or at least of a Franco-American axis, this means that you 
already have some indications from the White House that lead you 
to believe.... 
  [Juppe, interrupting] Of course. You know, all these things 
are serious, as I said just now, at the beginning. So, we would 
not do it just like that, all alone. For the past several days 
I have had daily conversations with our European and American 
partners. 
  I would like to add one thing: It seems to me that 
Washington has adopted the French position on the reaction to be 
taken on the latest massacres in Sarajevo, but it also seems to 
me that there is an evolution on the political and diplomatic 
level, because -- I would like to add this point as it seems 
very important to me -- we are not warmongers, we are not trying 
to conduct an all-out war; we want to launch an ultimatum, but 
we also want a political perspective in all this. We recall 
that there is a plan for a political settlement, and that there 
is no other way out than by political negotiation. It seems -- 
and this is another positive aspect of my conversations this 
afternoon -- that the Americans are ready to associate 
themselves with this diplomatic and political step by the 
Europeans. Our plan is not unalterable; it can be developed, it 
can be improved, but I make this appeal once again: All the 
great powers, the Americans, but also the Russians and the 
Europeans, must tell the belligerents: We will not allow the 
massacres in Sarajevo to continue but, at the same time, we are 
proposing a way our for you, and it is a political and 
diplomatic way. 
  [d'Arvor] If I understand you right, the two prongs of the 
alternative are, if you do not get satisfaction in Brussels 
tomorrow from your NATO partners, that means that the French are 
ready to withdraw, since they will be alone against the 
attackers and belligerents of all kinds? 
  [Juppe] I think tomorrow it will be a question of dignity 
and 
honor. How, after having so often uttered threats, so often 
repeated that we will not allow such massacres to happen again, 
can we do nothing? 
  France will not associate itself with a nondecision. If the 
Atlantic alliance is incapable of taking a decision, as I said 
just now, we will ask whether we can continue to expose our 
soldiers to pointless risks. Our soldiers are brave, and I want 
to pay homage to them. It is true soldiers are ready to take 
risks, but not for just anything, not pointlessly, and not in an 
ill-considered way. 
  [d'Arvor] (?Doesn't this) question the credibility of 
Europe, 
because Europe has repeated so many times in the last year and 
one-half, with the risk of ending up losing credibility, that 
this must end, and it has gone on? Sarajevo is geographically 
exactly half way between Rome and Athens. 
  [Juppe] Credibility of Europe, yes and no. First, Europe has 
done things, and France has done things. I am not ashamed of 
what France has done. Just the opposite, because it is there on 
the ground with its soldiers. We have collectively given a lot 
of money for humanitarian aid, and for several months we have 
proposed more and more diplomatic initiatives. We have done our 
best, even if for the moment we have been unable to settle the 
problem. 
  Europe also put a peace plan on the table in November, 
December, which is the only plan for a political settlement that 
exists, and let me remind you that the three parties -- Muslim, 
Croat, and Serb -- have agreed on its principles. It is true 
that yesterday I would have preferred Europe to have been a bit 
more courageous, perhaps. 
  [d'Arvor] Thank you for responding to our invitation, Mr. 
Juppe.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua by </F>
Annette Ardisson on 9 February -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ardisson] There is a NATO 
meeting today. Do you favor military intervention in 
Yugoslavia? Are we to wage war or not? 
  [Pasqua] What I think is that, if we continue to stay under 
the current conditions, we shall bear a responsiblity, not only 
[words indistinct], we already take great responsibility in 
what is happening -- but we shall also suffer dishonor. So, 
either NATO decides to intervene -- or else I don't see what we 
are still doing in Bosnia. There will be only one thing left to 
do, and that is to leave. I think that is what [Foreign 
Minister] Alain Juppe said last night: Everyone must be made to 
face up to their responsibilities. We cannot stand and watch 
with indifference what is happening, content ourselves with 
counting the dead, and say: Yes, well, Sunday wasn't very nice, 
there were 65 dead, 200 injured, children and so on; it's all 
very sad, but we cannot do anything about it. No, that isn't 
true. I think the time has come for everyone to face up to 
their responsibilities. 
  [Ardisson] What does that mean? 
  [Pasqua] It means.... 
  [Ardisson, interrupting] Does it mean: Let's go? 
  [Pasqua] It means we have to call on the Serbs to withdraw 
their artillery positions from around Sarajevo; if they do not, 
we have to intervene with air strikes. Otherwise, we should 
leave. 
  What's the point of it? We have already had 30 dead. We 
already have 30 French soldiers who have been killed, and we 
have had 300 wounded. And all of that for what? For nothing.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 9 (AFP) -- France and the U.S. have set a 
10-day deadline for the Serbs to withdraw their artillery from 
Sarajevo or face air strikes, in a proposal being discussed 
Wednesday [9 February] by NATO envoys in Brussels, French 
officials said here. 
  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur meanwhile told a 
cabinet meeting "he had personally asked for an ultimatum" to be 
given to the Serbs, government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said. 
  Balladur said he was following the situation with 
"particular 
vigilance" and that a "turning-point" had been reached over 
Bosnia, Sarkozy added. "Everyone must understand that nothing 
will be easy", Balladur was quoted as saying. 
  The French officials said the Franco-American proposal was 
that the Serbs withdraw or regroup their artillery, tanks and 
mortars outside a 20-kilometer (12 miles) radius of Sarajevo or 
face air strikes, the officials said. 
  They said the French and the Americans agreed on a joint 
proposal Tuesday evening after intense consultations among the 
allies that followed Saturday's killing of 68 people by a mortar 
shell in Sarajevo. 
  The French had proposed a 30 kilometer (18 miles) radius, 
but 
the two sides finally cut it to 20 kilometres, the officials 
said. However, an exception was made for a small area around 
Pale, seat of the Bosnian Serb parliament, on the heights above 
Sarajevo. 
  The proposal made no mention of regrouping Bosnian Moslem 
heavy weapons. 
  The officials said that after the 10-day deadline, all heavy 
weapons found in the exclusion area would be liable to 
destruction.

<F P=106> [Eva Backstedt report: "United Support for UN Action"] </F>
  [Text] The Nordic defense ministers have lent their 
unanimous support to the call that the Nordic UN battalion in 
Bosnia should be given air support when the need arises. The 
ministers have also demanded that the United Nations should, as 
soon as possible, see to it that the Danish tanks, which are 
part of the Nordic battalion, arrive at their destination, Tuzla. 
  This was the outcome of an extraordinary meeting of the 
Nordic defense ministers at Rosersberg north of Stockholm 
yesterday. In addition to host Anders Bjorck, his counterparts 
Hans Haekkerup from Denmark and Jorgen Kosmo from Norway were 
present at the meeting. 
  Not surprisingly, Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn 
had 
indicated that she was prevented from attending. Finland was 
represented instead by ministry counselor Hannu Toivola. 
  The call for air support has been voiced in robust terms by 
the head of the battalion in Tuzla, Colonel Ulf Henricsson, 
among others. 
  The idea that the defense ministers have now expressed their 
support for is that, if UN personnel are attacked by any 
fighting unit, this unit must be quickly knocked out in a 
targeted air attack. 
  "Of course it means risks for personnel if the United 
Nations 
decides to adopt a tougher line against the warring factions," 
Anders Bjorck said. 
  "But after the briefing we received today from Ulf 
Henricsson, we share his view that the risks are probably even 
greater if nothing at all is done." 
  Anders Bjorck and his colleagues stressed that it is 
important that possible future air operations are directed 
solely against groups that attack the UN forces. 
  "We do not want to contribute to an escalation of the 
fighting, and we also have to prevent other UN personnel in 
humanitarian operations in the region from finding themselves in 
a tough spot." 
  A number of Danish tanks are part of the Nordic battalion. 
However, the tanks have not yet arrived in Tuzla, where the over 
1,000 man battalion is stationed. At present they are in Split 
in Croatia. 
  "There is an urgent need that the tanks get into place and 
can be made use of as soon as possible," Hans Haekkerup said. 
  "At present the United Nations is giving priority to another 
task -- that of replacing the Canadian personnel in Srebrenica 
with Dutchmen, but after that we expect that it will tackle the 
problem of moving the tanks. Hopefully this will be able to 
happen in early March." 
  One of the Nordic UN force's main tasks is to open the 
airport at Tuzla. 
  "We hope that the United Nations will be able to reach a 
negotiated agreement about the airport with the warring 
factions, but if this proves impossible we must give 
consideration to using force to open it. Such a decision on the 
part of the United Nations must of course be preceded by 
consultations with us," Anders Bjorck said. 
  Anders Bjorck also thinks that it is now time for the United 
Nations to review its military organization. 
  "Bosnia is probably the most difficult UN mission since the 
Congo crisis. Past operations have been more like policing 
actions, whereas now we are facing the prospect of direct 
military operations." 
  The ministers consider that one of the most important 
lessons 
that can be learned is that peacekeeping operations must be put 
in place as early as possible in a risk area. 
  "Just look at the Nordic force in Macedonia. Not very much 
attention is paid to it in the media, but it is doing an 
excellent job, in that it has succeeded in preventing fighting 
from flaring up," Jorgen Kosmo said.

  [Text] Strasbourg, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Greece will not veto any 
decisions by NATO and the European Community to intervene 
militarily in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Greek European Affairs 
Minister Theodoros Pangalos said here Wednesday [9 February]. 
  Speaking in the European Parliament, he said: "We cannot 
block decisions by our partners (in the EC and the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation)." 
  Pangalos was speaking at a plenary session of the 
Euro-Parliament on behalf of the current Greek presidency of the 
E.C., which ends on June 31. 
  Greece has made clear it is opposed to military intervention 
in Bosnia, including the use of air strikes against Serb 
positions around Sarajevo. 
  Pangalos reiterated the Greek position, but said Athens 
would 
not stand in the way of its partners which are poised to give 
the green light for air bombing of the Serb positions. 
  The Greek minister said all the countries in the 
neighbourhood of the Bosnian conflict were against military 
intervention, except Turkey. 
  He was speaking as NATO ambassadors in Brussels met to 
decide 
on an ultimatum to the Serbs, that they cease their siege of 
Sarajevo and withdraw their artillery from around the Bosnian 
capital or face NATO air attacks. 
  NATO decisions need unanimous support, which means also the 
backing of Athens. 
  Greece accepted a decision of E.C. foreign ministers in 
Brussels on Monday that the EC should use all possible measures, 
including air attacks, to break the siege of Sarajevo. 
  The Euro-MP's were generally supportive of NATO military 
action. French Socialist Euro-MP Leon Schwartzenberg said: "If 
we don't want to act, let us at least give the (Moslem) Bosnians 
the means to defend themselves." 
  Liberal Dutch Euro-MP Jan Willem Bertens said the arms 
embargo of former Yugoslavia should be lifted, and the Bosnian 
Moslems armed to defend themselves, if the Serbs did not accept 
a cease-fire in two weeks.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 8 (AFP) -- The UN Human Rights' 
Commission [UNHCR] Tuesday [8 February] condemned as "despicable 
and outrageous" the deadly mortar attack on Sarajevo's market 
place and called for "firm and resolute action" to stop more 
atrocities. 
  In a statement addressed to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali and members of the Security Council, the Commission 
urged that action be taken "immediately" by the international 
community to deal with such attacks and other human rights 
violations. 
  It did not specify what type of action should be taken. 
  The Commission, which considered resolutions put forward by 
the European Community and the Organisation of the Islamic 
Conference, said it wanted an end to "ethnic cleansing" and 
other acts of genocide in the former Yugoslavia, diplomats said. 
  The statement called Saturday's mortar attack which left at 
least 68 dead and nearly 200 injured a "deliberate and 
unconscionable" act which was "despicable and outrageous" and 
called for "firm and resolute action to be tkaen immediately by 
the international community." 
  The Commission also called for an end to the rape of women, 
the siege of Bosnian towns and the bombing and massacre of 
civilians and it demanded that "war criminals" be put on trial. 
  The statement came ahead of a meeting Thursday [date as 
received] of the NATO council in response to a request by 
Butrus-Ghali for NATO backing to deter any repetition of the 
massacre, possibly including the use of airstrikes against Serb 
positions around the city.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Foreign Minister Irfan 
Ljubijankic met with newly appointed acting NATO Secretary 
General Sergio Balanzino at NATO headquarters in Brussels. 
Bosnia-Herzegovina took advantage of the occasion to demand the 
immediate withdrawal of all heavy weapons positioned around 
Sarajevo to a point outside the town's range. If the Serbs do 
not do this within 48 hours, Minister Ljubijankic demanded air 
strikes. The credibility of NATO as a serious institution and 
[word indistinct] talks is at stake. 
  Our foreign minister repeated the demand to lift the arms 
embargo for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ljubijankic and Balanzino 
discussed the military presence of the Croatian Army in our 
country. Our side referred to a secret agreement between Franjo 
Tudjman and Slobodan Milosevic on the division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina between Croatia and Serbia. 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina expressed the desire to join the 
Partnership for Peace, an NATO initiative designed to unite with 
the former Socialist countries. Mr. Balanzino informed Minister 
Ljubijankic that NATO is keeping our country in mind but that 
the acceptance procedure is long, and the number of interested 
countries is great. 
  Mr. Balanzino informed the Bosnia-Herzegovina foreign 
minister that NATO has planned all the details for action in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina; only a political decision is needed. It is 
high time we preserve the meager credibility of the 
international community and NATO with resolute action. We 
seriously believe this, he emphasized.

  [Text] During the meeting with Foreign Minister Irfan 
Ljubijankic, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe voiced disgust 
with the massacre that was committed in Sarajevo last weekend, 
and at the same time added that despite the events on the ground 
a political solution has no alternative. 
  The European 12 at yesterday's meeting reiterated EU support 
to the realization of the joint plan, Juppe said. At the same 
time, he put forward an assessment that the plan has not been 
realized so far due to insufficient contribution by the United 
States and Russia. The political and diplomatic EU action is 
aimed at convincing both countries to exert political pressure 
on Serbia and Croatia in the Geneva talks. 
  Juppe explained to Minister Ljubijankic that the EU plan 
should not be viewed as something definite, in the sense of take 
it or leave it. On the contrary, Europe is willing to improve 
it. The condition for this is a sincere approach to the 
negotiations by all sides. 
  According to the French minister, the next NATO meeting in 
Brussels will be very significant regarding even sharper 
articulation of the stances taken by the European Union. He 
underscored that the final decision will, nevertheless, be 
passed by the EU ministers on the basis of yesterday's 
declaration. 
  Juppe was interested whether the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
authorities can guarantee security to the Serbs in, as he said, 
their parts of Sarajevo after the Serbian artillery has 
withdrawn to a sufficient distance from the town. Minister 
Ljubijankic reminded that the Serbs in Sarajevo and elsewhere in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have never been threatened so far, nor will 
they be in the future. 
  During the meeting with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy 
Claes, 
the Belgian colleague said to our foreign minister that the EU 
attitude toward a concrete action in Bosnia has definitely 
changed after the last two massacres in Sarajevo. Claes's 
conclusion was that the decision about the ultimatum to the 
Serbs must be brought by NATO after examining all possible 
consequences. He is convinced that a consensus will be reached, 
even though the military experts will strive to prophetize 
caution and risks.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 8 (AFP) -- States neighbouring 
ex-Yugoslavia will meet here Wednesday [9 February] to discuss 
the latest crisis in the Bosnian conflict, before resumed talks 
between the three warring factions Thursday, officials said 
Tuesday. 
  Wednesday's meeting is expected to include discussion of the 
results of a NATO meeting in Brussels, also slated for 
Wednesday, on air strikes against Serbs around Sarajevo, peace 
conference spokesman John Mills said. 
  Mills said the talks between the foreign ministers of the 
eight states concerned would take the form of an "informal 
meeting." The ministers were invited by international peace 
mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
  Greece earlier said it would attend the meeting, despite 
original opposition to Turkey attending. Italian sources said 
Rome expected an "exchange of views" on progress towards a peace 
accord. 
  The participants -- Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, 
Hungary, Italy, Romania, and Turkey -- would also consider the 
impact the continuing UN embargo on the rump Yugoslavia is 
having on their own economies. 
  Earlier in the day the Turkish Foreign Ministry in Ankara 
said that the meeting might be put back. A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said "Nothing has been fixed yet." 
  Turkey had been invited to the meeting called by 
international peace negotiators Lord Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg before last Saturday's massacre in Sarajevo of 68 
civilians in a mortar blast which also injured 200 people. 
  Meanwhile Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic is due 
Thursday to meet his Bosnian Serb counterpart Radovan Karadzic 
and Bosnian Croats representative Mile Akmadzic, replacing Mate 
Boban, who resigned Tuesday. 
  Representatives from neither Belgrade nor Zagreb would 
attend 
the talks, which aim to build "confidence-building measures" 
between the three warring factions and "are not a resumption of 
peace talks per se," Mill said. 
  One such measure would be the establishment of telephone 
hotlines between the warring parties to permit rapid contact 
between them, as well as the restoration of electricity to 
Sarajevo. 
  "Those measures could assist in reducing the tension", Mills 
said. But "we are under no illusion. They won't stop the 
fighting." Mills added that the question of the 
demilitarisation of Sarajevo would be high on the agenda 
although this was was "a very complicated matter." 
  A Bosnian Serb statement Monday said the situation was not 
condusive to a global peace settlement, but added: "the Bosnian 
Serbs are now ready to bring peace to Sarajevo, to negotiate its 
demilitarisation and to place it under United Nations control" 
for two years, "prior to a definitive peace accord." 
  According to UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi, the Moslems 
wanted not just the withdrawal of Serb artillery outside 
Sarajevo's range, but were demanding their guns be placed under 
UN control, which the Serbs would not accept. 
  Silajdzic has also been meeting Croatian Foreign Minister 
Mate Granic in an attempt to boost relations between the two 
sides, locked in bitter fighting in central Bosnia.

  [Text] [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky has signed the 
NATO program Partnership for Peace for Hungary. The Hungarian 
foreign minister said that Partnership for Peace is an anchor by 
which the Hungarian state's ship is moored in the harbor of the 
North Atlantic Alliance. 
  Hungary is the fifth Central and East European country which 
has officially joined the program so far. Ukraine is the next 
to sign the agreement this afternoon.

  [Text] According to the Hungarian foreign minister [Geza 
Jeszenszky], as a result of the Partnership for Peace program 
signed with NATO, Hungary's security has strengthened. 
Jeszenszky talked about this when he signed the document in 
Brussels. 
  However, the head of Hungarian diplomacy emphasized that the 
Partnership for Peace program could not substitute for full NATO 
membership. Speaking about the practical forms of cooperation, 
Jeszenszky said that joint planning and military exercises could 
be discussed. Moreover, it would be good to involve experts 
from the North Atlantic alliance in the Hungarian Army's 
modernization program. Jeszenszky, however, said that Hungary 
did not wish to participate in peacekeeping with large units.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 8 (AFP) -- Ukraine became the first 
former Soviet republic to join NATO's Partnership for Peace 
initiative Tuesday [8 February] but warned that the partnership 
deal could destabilize the security order in Europe. 
  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko said although his 
country supports the idea behind the Partnership programme he 
did not feel it would "strengthen the security in Europe but, on 
the contrary, might throw the situation off balance." 
  "We consider the cooperation in the framework of the 
Partnership as a street with two-way traffic," he added in a 
speech to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
  "On the one hand, we must adapt ourselves to the NATO 
standards and contribute to the NATO's activities and on the 
other hand, we feel that finally NATO must inevitably change its 
nature in the course of cooperation with the partners." 
  In addition to Ukraine, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia 
and Hungary have also signed on to the Partnership deal which 
provides for wider military cooperation with former Soviet bloc 
countries but stops short of offering them, at least 
immediately, full NATO membership. 
  Sergio Silvio Balanzino, NATO's deputy secretary general, 
said that "by signing this document today, you (Ukraine) 
indicate the importance you attach to the goal we all share 
through such cooperation. 
  "Most of all it is a recognition that in today's world, the 
benefits of independence can only be enjoyed and safeguarded 
through cooperation with others."

ruled in Chad's favor in its border conflict with Libya. The 
ruling means that Libya, which has controllled the disputed 
territory since 1973, must now evacuate the area. Chad and 
Libya have fought two wars over the land, which is the size of 
France and thought to be rich in uranium and oil. 
  In 1990 the two countries agreed to put the issue before the 
International Court, pledging to accept its ruling.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Vranitzky Appeals to All EU </F>
Government Heads"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- On Monday [7 February] Federal Chancellor 
Franz Vranitzky appealed to the heads of government of all 12 
member states of the European Union [EU] to do all they can to 
make sure that the entry negotiations are concluded according to 
plan. In a letter to the prime ministers, he also announced 
that he would contact them directly in the event the 
negotiations become difficult. 
  "The issues of transit, agriculture, and holiday homes 
remain 
unsolved. Austria's position on these issues has nothing to do 
with the wish to get special treatment, but it is the result of 
a businesslike effort to show the differences from other 
situations or to ask for a step-by-step adaptation to a joint 
system, which was conceded to other member states in the past, 
too," Vranitzky writes. 
  For the government it is, therefore, essential to reach a 
result in the negotiations that takes these special features 
into account.

<F P=106> [Report by Conrad Seidl: "Much Discussion, Little Resolve"] </F>
  [Text] Linz -- More than one in four Austrians are still 
undecided as to how they would vote in a referendum on European 
Union [EU] entry. 
  According to Astrid Koller, of the Market Institute, this 
has 
mainly to be seen in connection with the fact that the EU 
negotiations are currently accompanied by a particularly large 
number of political statements: "The potential of the undecided 
is in great motion. In quiet months such as June and October, 
when there was less discussion on entry policy, people were much 
more certain on how they would decide." 
  Koller points out that even among educated people, one in 
five does not know how he or she would vote. 
  As reported earlier, 39 percent would currently vote in 
favor 
and 34 percent against EU membership. Among university and high 
school graduates, 47 percent are for and 33 percent against 
accession. In the federal capital the support for membership is 
even more marked: Every other Viennese would vote in favor of 
membership, only 28 percent against, while 22 percent of people 
living in Vienna have not yet made up their mind. 
<H5>  Surprising Farmers </H5>
  Resolve is remarkably high among farmers: Only 14 percent 
are undecided, while the number of those in favor of membership 
equals that of those who are against. This is surprising, 
because the farmers had up to now taken a rather critical 
position and because the headlines were dominated by 
agricultural issues at the time of the survey. 
  The supporters of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP], Social 
Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], and the Freedom Party of 
Austria [FPOe] also proved to be relatively determined as to 
what they want, with the number of people without a clear 
position toward Europe remaining under 20 percent for each 
party. However, the Market survey for DER STANDARD's European 
Barometer shows that a clear majority in favor of EU entry (45 
against 35 percent) only exists within the SPOe. How the 
somewhat more than 25 percent of the population, which has not 
yet made up its mind, will finally decide, or whether it will 
even abstain, is still entirely unclear.

<F P=106> [Conrad Seidl report: "Turn of the Mood in Favor of EU"] </F>
  [Text] Linz -- The mood in favor of Austria's joining the 
European Union (EU) has never been as favorable as it is now. 
This succinct conclusion is drawn by Werner Beutelmeyer, head 
of the Market Institute in Linz, from the poll concluded at the 
end of January for DER STANDARD's monthly European Barometer. 
  For this conclusion Market relies on several 
indicators: 

  -  First, Austrians are regularly asked how they 
would decide if a referendum were held right now. Last summer, 
after a long period to the contrary, there was a majority in 
favor of EU membership. This majority was, however, lost again 
by autumn. 
  -  More decisive is the assessment of the general mood 
by those polled. Market asks: "What do you think: How do most 
Austrians currently view joining the EU?" Last June, when 40 
percent of those polled were in favor of membership and 37 
percent against, those same pollees believed that a majority 
would be against EU membership. At that time 34 percent said 
that a majority would be against membership, 31 percent assumed 
that there would be a majority in favor of membership. In the 
meantime, this relationship has clearly changed: Now 33 percent 
think that the majority is in favor of membership; only 24 
percent think that there is a majority against the EU. 
  -  Another 
indicator is the assessment on whether joining the European 
Community or the EU would bring personal advantages or 
disadvantages for those polled. For months, right until last 
autumn, there had been a majority that expected primarily 
disadvantages for themselves. Since then, however, there has 
been a clear and steady change, particularly in this respect. 
  Market chief Beutelmayer thinks that the reason for the 
change in mood is the current reporting on Austria's 
negotiations in Brussels. In this connection, it is important to 
see that Austrian positions are defended seriously. 
  However, the referendum has been far from "won." One out of 
four Austrians is undecided.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Crunch Cabinet talks on the Bosnia crisis will 
tonight focus on ways to turn international disgust at the 
Sarajevo massacre into a separate peace deal for the besieged 
city. 
  Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind arrived in London from a 
two-day visit to Bosnia saying the shelling of the Sarajevo 
marketplace could prove to be a turning point. 
  The Government believes the Serbs are very much "on the back 
foot" because of Saturday [5 February]'s atrocity, which killed 
almost 70 people. 
  "What we are looking to do is to take advantage of this and 
pressure the Serbs to force a settlement around Sarajevo and, 
perhaps, even shorten the war itself," said one official. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has stated that he 
might 
be prepared to negotiate a separate peace accord for Sarajevo. 
  NATO leaders are adamant that some good must emerge from 
Saturday's carnage and ambassadors from the 16-nation alliance 
are expected to reach a clear decision when they meet tomorrow. 
  The primary proposal is likely to be an ultimatum to the 
Serbs to withdraw their artillery and mortar batteries out of 
range of Sarajevo or face the threat of air strikes. 
  NATO would then insist on an agreement that the Muslims hold 
back and that United Nations forces form a carefully controlled 
buffer zone, similar to the green line in Cyprus. 
  UN troops would be pulled off other duties across the former 
Yugoslavia to patrol the buffer zone. 
  There are hopes that a settlement around Sarajevo could 
eventually lead to a more general peace across the rest of 
Bosnia, where the Serbs are already in largely defensive 
positions and content with their territorial gains. 
  "I think this could indeed be a turning-point," said Mr 
Rifkind as he returned to London. 
  But he warned that decisions made over the next 48 hours 
required clear political leadership rooted in sound military 
judgement. 
  "Any initiatives we take must have a military coherence and 
be consistent with what is achievable and sensible so that we 
actually benefit the people of Bosnia," he said. 
  "I think it is very important to ensure the action taken in 
the name of the UN is co-ordinated and coherent, and not 
sporadic and ill-thought out. 
  "The crucial requirement is not simply to engineer some 
event 
that has a political impact but to take policy forward in a way 
to produce results." 
  The ramifications of the Sarajevo massacre overshadowed the 
original purpose of Mr Rifkind's visit to Bosnia, which was to 
look at whether the humanitarian aid operation should continue. 
  The Government will make a final decision next month but the 
defence secretary said aid was getting through and many people 
would die if troops were withdrawn. 
  He was particularly pleased with the no-nonsense approach of 
new UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, which he 
said proved aid could be delivered in a more effective way.

<F P=106> [By Phillip Johnston, political correspondent, and Richard </F>
Savill in Belfast: "Ulster Peace Ideas To Be Kept Secret"] 
  [Text] Proposals aimed at pushing forward the search for a 
political settlement in Northern Ireland are to remain secret 
while ground for possible agreement is explored, it emerged last 
night. 
  Senior Government sources said the three parties involved in 
bilateral talks would be given an assessment of them in the next 
10 days. But they will amount to "thoughts" rather than a 
blueprint for action and will not be published. 
  Last week, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, 
disclosed he intended to "float" ideas for devolving powers to 
the province and setting up cross-border policy groups to 
demonstrate that the political process was not waiting upon an 
answer from Sinn Fein and the IRA to the Downing Street 
declaration. 
  The proposals, thought to include a new assembly for 
Northern 
Ireland, are aimed at giving "focus and direction" to the debate. 
  It is hoped that Sinn Fein will accept the declaration as a 
basis for entering the democratic process. But it was stressed 
in Whitehall last night that they would not be able to unravel 
any agreements made once talks between the Government and the 
various parties have resumed on the new basis. A "taking stock" 
meeting Between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's Prime 
Minister, will take place in London on Feb 19, some two months 
after the declaration was signed. 
  Speaking in Dublin yesterday Mr Reynolds said that an early 
commitment to peace was now the test of true Irish patriotism. 
He warned republicans that the nationalist community as a whole 
stood to suffer most and risked losing ground if the declaration 
was rejected and IRA violence continued. 
  The time for a decision on peace was approaching, he said. 
"Nobody should succumb to the dangerous illusion that there is 
much more that can be offered at this stage of the peace 
process. Democratic governments will not be influenced by the 
threat of continued violence." 
  The Sinn Fein annual conference at the end of the month is 
increasingly being seen as a watershed for the Republicans. Mr 
Dick Spring, Irish Foreign Minister, said there were no fixed 
deadlines for a response but the conference seemed "a date of 
importance." 
  Sir Patrick, speaking in Londonderry, said the Government 
was 
prepared to move to the next stage without Sinn Fein or Mr Ian 
Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which has boycotted recent 
discussions because of its opposition to the Downing Street 
declaration.

<F P=106> [Report by Thierry Fiorilli: "Belgians Insist on Right To </F>
Intervene"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The Belgians defend the principle of the 
right to intervene on humanitarian grounds. They approve of 
Belgium's participation in humanitarian missions. They want 
Belgian UN troops to remain in Bosnia and they consider it 
vital that their resources be increased. However, they reject 
recourse to air strikes except in the event of legitimate 
self-defense. 
  The survey carried out by Survey &amp; Action -- which 
monitors 
the evolution of Belgian society -- shows the Belgians to be a 
generous people refusing to resign themselves to impotence. 
Here we publish the results of the survey exclusively for the 
French-speaking press. 
  According to the survey, 71 percent of Belgians considered 
it 
normal for the "international community to intervene with 
military resources to try to put an end to armed conflict and/or 
to protect the civilian victims of the war." Moreover, 62 
percent approved of Belgium's intervention in Rwanda, Somalia, 
and the former Yugoslavia. This is an enormous proportion and 
is surprising when you consider that the effectiveness of the UN 
troops and the blue helmets has been and remains highly 
controversial, especially where Somalia and Bosnia are concerned. 
  Also surprising was the wish expressed by more than half of 
the Belgian people (53 percent) to see the number of our troops 
in the current Balkan quagmire maintained, or even increased. 
While the debate about the withdrawal or retention of UN troops 
rages on, especially in France, just three Belgians in ten were 
in favor of our troops pulling out or for their numbers to be 
reduced. 
  Does what is at stake in the former Yugoslavia justify the 
loss of Belgian life? A very large minority said yes (41 
percent), while 49 percent replied no. In effect, two people in 
five thought that a Belgian could die for Bosnia or to avoid the 
conflict from spreading. 
  The consensus resurfaced on the question of the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] resources. A very clear majority (73 percent) 
considered that resources should be strengthened, while just 7 
percent believed them to be sufficient. Consequently six 
Belgians in 10 (57 percent) considered that Francois 
Briquemont's request to step down was an expression of his 
disapproval of this shortage of resources, believing that "the 
UN bureaucrats sent him to the front defenseless." Moreover, 46 
percent judged that the general was right to resign. 
  In addition, 43 percent would, if they had the power, 
authorize the UNPROFOR to use force in the event of it being 
attacked. This is what Briquemont wanted. 
  What of possible systematic western air strikes? Those 
against were in the majority (59 percent), judging that bombing 
operations (especially of Serbian artillery positions) would be 
ineffective and morally unjustified. This refusal did not 
appear to be widely inspired by the fear of major UNPROFOR 
losses (14 percent). However, a little more than three Belgians 
in 10 (34 percent) were in favor of systematic bombardment, even 
if (17 percent) they led to heavy losses among the UN forces. 
  In its conclusions, the survey institute explained this 
movement with regard to Bosnia primarily by what it called the 
"Briquemont effect" and the wide media coverage of the conflict. 
Speaking about a war and constantly showing images of it serves 
to remind people of its existence. It might also revive the 
pacifist issue through "a search for a new direction," and 
"the...disillusionment of a society that has lost its unifying 
values...."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  American Support </H5>
  The position of the United States is also something to 
watch. 
Washington was in favor of the use of force eight months ago. 
Afterwards it changed its mind. And now it is once again in 
favor: On Monday [7 February] President Bill Clinton supported 
the request that NATO authorize air strikes against Serb 
batteries around Sarajevo. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher Warren was very shocked 
by the carnage in Sarajevo. He seems to have won ground against 
some leading figures in the Pentagon who favor prudence. 
  It seems that a turnaround in U.S. policies would rally the 
United Kingdom to the air strike option. But account must be 
taken of Russia, for whom this option risks causing "an 
escalation in violence leading to the immediate withdrawal of UN 
forces."

<F P=106> [Michel Rosten commentary: "NATO Prepares Its Response"] </F>
  [Text] The NATO Permanent Council will meet this Wednesday 
[9 February] as usual. But it will not be a routine meeting 
because it will have to reply to the UN secretary general's 
request to authorize, if necessary, the air strikes which have 
been under discussion since the Americans suggested resorting to 
them last August. In addition, it will not have escaped 
anyone's notice that the EC's Council of Foreign Ministers 
officially referred the handling of the Bosnian crisis to the 
alliance. 
  It is true that NATO seems to be the only instrument which 
can be used if there are to be strikes against targets in 
Bosnia. But, in the present context, which is that of great 
pressure being exerted by public opinion following the massacre 
in the Sarajevo market, it is difficult to avoid the impression 
that political decisionmaking centers, which still claim to be 
handling the Bosnian problem, are only too pleased to 
temporarily pass on the "hot potato" to the alliance. 
  According to a top official, the ambassadors' official 
meeting this Wednesday (after two days of unofficial contacts 
and a luncheon for the 16 heads of mission on 8 February) should 
not give rise to differences of opinion. The preparatory 
discussions have helped to smooth them over, to the extent that 
a positive response to Mr. Butrus-Ghali's request is expected. 
Of course, after publishing in several official communiques 
their readiness to "launch air strikes," the allies would find 
it difficult to go back on their promises. London, Ottawa, and 
even Athens (which on 8 February) flattered itself on having 
held back the "hysterical improvisations" of the advocates of 
force) will thus very probably be forced to once again brandish 
the threat of an air strike. 
  NATO is expected to refuse; but, as a high-ranking diplomat 
remarked, all aspects of the problem must be taken into 
consideration. Indeed, there is still a great difference 
between accepting a state of alert in theory, although this term 
is not part of alliance jargon, and an actual strike. 
Therefore, just because NATO gives its formal agreement to 
placing its forces at the UN secretary general's disposal, that 
does not mean that the latter will use them. The room to 
maneuver between these two possibilities remains large; and it 
is on this that the allies are counting, providing a way out of 
the embarrassing situation into which the Sarajevo market 
massacre has placed them. 
  In short, the response of the UN secretary general, whose 
room to maneuver is reduced because of Moscow's potential veto, 
could merely be a new transitional stage in a process which has 
made patience a cardinal virtue. The Western countries hope 
that the Serbian irregulars will take account of that; moreover, 
in Atlantic circles, it is stressed that Wednesday's meeting 
gives nobody the feeling that they are being caught up in a 
spiral of military action.

<F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F>
reporter] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister warned today that the United 
Nations may need to use force, including air power, to carry out 
its mandate in Bosnia. 
  But he stressed at Commons question time: "Ultimately peace 
is only going to come at the negotiating table." 
  Challenged by Labour leader John Smith about the possible 
use 
of air strikes, Mr Major stressed that air power must only be 
used for clear objectives. 
  Continued mortar and artillery attacks on Sarajevo could not 
await an overall setlement. 
  "UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force], with support 
from NATO, must apply immediate and strong pressure to halt 
those attacks." 
  Mr Major also clashed with Liberal Democrat leader Paddy 
Ashdown over Britain's response to the carnage in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  He angrily told him to stop pretending "there is some easy, 
magic and painless solution to a problem that is intensely 
difficult." 
  The question of how to respond to the weekend market place 
massacre in Sarajevo dominated the exchanges. 
  Mr Smith asked: "If no action is taken to protect the people 
of Sarajevo from the pitiless shelling, aren't the Serbs bound 
to conclude that no action will be taken against them, whatever 
they do?" 
  Mr Major said UN troops were in Bosnia to help the civilian 
population. 
  "The UN cannot end the civil war by force. That has never 
been a feasible option," he insisted. 
  "Ultimately peace is only going to come at the negotiating 
table." 
  "But I think the UN may need to use force for specific 
purposes, to carry out its mandate and protect its own people in 
Bosnia. 
  "It may need tactical air support from NATO. We have always 
been prepared to see air power used for these purposes, provided 
the commanders judge it appropriate." 
  Mr Major said: "I don't believe that we can wait for action 
to follow an overall settlement. 
  "I don't believe it is right to tolerate the continued 
mortar 
and artillery attacks against the civilian population. 
  "UNPROFOR, with support from Nato, must apply immediate and 
strong pressure to halt these attacks." 
  Mr Smith agreed that the civil war could not be ended by 
military intervention but added: "Ought there not to be some 
minimal objectives that we should set for ourselves?" 
  He said: "Surely it ought to be a political objective to 
remove all the weapons within striking distance of Sarajevo, 
under threat that if that is not done, air attacks will be 
pursued." 
  Mr Major said NATO would meet tomorrow to consider "what 
pressure can most effectively be applied and how." 
  He said: "It is certainly the case that if we use air power 
we must be very clear about the objectives of that action. 
  "And the aim must be to reinforce pressure to end the 
bombardment of Sarajevo." 
  Mr Major said the UN command must be able to set "clear and 
specific conditions, knowing that tactical air support is 
available if necessary in order to back them up." 
  Any use of force must be "forward looking," he said. "It 
must 
seek to improve the situation in Sarajevo and contribute to the 
pressure on the parties to end the war." 
  Mr Major admitted: "These are not easy options in any way." 
  Decision-making must also take account of the importance of 
the humanitarian effort, the safety of civilians and the safety 
of soldiers carrying out the aid operation. 
  "These are the objectives NATO must consider tomorrow in 
determining how to proceed." 
  Mr Smith asked if the Government would support an ultimatum 
calling on the Serbs to withdraw "weapons of attack" from 
striking distance of Sarejevo. 
  Mr Major pointed to the EU [European Union]'s foreign 
affairs 
council recommendation yesterday that the aim should be to bring 
about the immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo "using all 
the means necessary." 
  But he said foreign ministers had gone on to look to NATO to 
carry forward the process -- a decision in line with views 
expressed by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. 
  Mr Ashdown, quoting Mr Major, welcomed the Prime Minister's 
"new more muscular mood" on Bosnia. 
  But he said it was now four weeks "since you told us of your 
determination to reopen Tuzla airport as soon as possible and 
probably five weeks until the launching of the Serb spring 
offensive aimed at obliterating what remains of Bosnia." 
  Mr Ashdown demanded: "Are you able to tell us yet of any 
progress on opening Tuzla airport to which you have set your 
hand?" 
  Mr Major said it was a matter under consideration by the UN 
and NATO. 
  "It is not a unilateral matter for the British Government." 
  He said the UN and NATO were taking a very firm line on 
Tuzla 
airport, removing obstacles to humanitarian relief convoys and 
lifting the siege of Sarajevo. 
  "These are important and difficult matters that are being 
considered by commanders on the ground on a day to day basis." 
  But he told the Liberal Democrat leader: "I do wish you 
would 
cease, as you do so often, to pretend there is some easy, magic 
and painless solution to a problem that is intensely difficult 
for commanders on the ground and everybody concerned with the 
operation. 
  "You have been consistent in one respect only. You have been 
consistently wrong in every single course you have advocated 
since this dreadful conflict began!" 
  Earlier Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told the House 
British troops would remain in Bosnia throughout the winter to 
support the UN mandate. 
  Mr Rifkind, who returned today from a visit to former 
Yugoslavia added: "No decisions have yet been taken about their 
deployment thereafter." 
  He said: "All countries have to take account of the need to 
ensure the safety of UN forces currently in Bosnia. 
  "We have to take into account the advice of military 
commanders in Bosnia because they have an awesome 
responsibility, which must be a very important factor in the 
considerations that are under way." 
  He said every initiative had to be consistent with the need 
to show political leadership and political will and sound 
military judgment. 
  "If it is not so rooted, it will be a cruel deception on the 
people it is designed to help." 
  Shadow defence secretary Dr David Clark called for Sarajevo 
to be demilitarised. "The British Government should join in an 
ultimatum to the Serbs ... that if they do not acceed to this 
request, they face the consequences of air strikes." 
  Mr Rifkind said: "What we now have to consider is whether 
action that might be taken will meet the various objectives we 
have: continuation of aid, the need to try to influence the 
behaviour of the Serbs and other factions and our obligation as 
a national government to the protection of our own forces. 
  "It would be unwise to follow any initiative which put at 
jeopardy these requirements."

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Crunch Cabinet talks on the Bosnia crisis will 
tonight focus on ways to turn international disgust at the 
Sarajevo massacre into a separate peace deal for the besieged 
city. 
  Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind arrived in London from a 
two-day visit to Bosnia saying the shelling of the Sarajevo 
marketplace could prove to be a turning point. 
  The Government believes the Serbs are very much "on the back 
foot" because of Saturday [5 February]'s atrocity, which killed 
almost 70 people. 
  "What we are looking to do is to take advantage of this and 
pressure the Serbs to force a settlement around Sarajevo and, 
perhaps, even shorten the war itself," said one official. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has stated that he 
might 
be prepared to negotiate a separate peace accord for Sarajevo. 
  NATO leaders are adamant that some good must emerge from 
Saturday's carnage and ambassadors from the 16-nation alliance 
are expected to reach a clear decision when they meet tomorrow. 
  The primary proposal is likely to be an ultimatum to the 
Serbs to withdraw their artillery and mortar batteries out of 
range of Sarajevo or face the threat of air strikes. 
  NATO would then insist on an agreement that the Muslims hold 
back and that United Nations forces form a carefully controlled 
buffer zone, similar to the green line in Cyprus. 
  UN troops would be pulled off other duties across the former 
Yugoslavia to patrol the buffer zone. 
  There are hopes that a settlement around Sarajevo could 
eventually lead to a more general peace across the rest of 
Bosnia, where the Serbs are already in largely defensive 
positions and content with their territorial gains. 
  "I think this could indeed be a turning-point," said Mr 
Rifkind as he returned to London. 
  But he warned that decisions made over the next 48 hours 
required clear political leadership rooted in sound military 
judgement. 
  "Any initiatives we take must have a military coherence and 
be consistent with what is achievable and sensible so that we 
actually benefit the people of Bosnia," he said. 
  "I think it is very important to ensure the action taken in 
the name of the UN is co-ordinated and coherent, and not 
sporadic and ill-thought out. 
  "The crucial requirement is not simply to engineer some 
event 
that has a political impact but to take policy forward in a way 
to produce results." 
  The ramifications of the Sarajevo massacre overshadowed the 
original purpose of Mr Rifkind's visit to Bosnia, which was to 
look at whether the humanitarian aid operation should continue. 
  The Government will make a final decision next month but the 
defence secretary said aid was getting through and many people 
would die if troops were withdrawn. 
  He was particularly pleased with the no-nonsense approach of 
new UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, which he 
said proved aid could be delivered in a more effective way.

<F P=106> [By Phillip Johnston, political correspondent, and Richard </F>
Savill in Belfast: "Ulster Peace Ideas To Be Kept Secret"] 
  [Text] Proposals aimed at pushing forward the search for a 
political settlement in Northern Ireland are to remain secret 
while ground for possible agreement is explored, it emerged last 
night. 
  Senior Government sources said the three parties involved in 
bilateral talks would be given an assessment of them in the next 
10 days. But they will amount to "thoughts" rather than a 
blueprint for action and will not be published. 
  Last week, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, 
disclosed he intended to "float" ideas for devolving powers to 
the province and setting up cross-border policy groups to 
demonstrate that the political process was not waiting upon an 
answer from Sinn Fein and the IRA to the Downing Street 
declaration. 
  The proposals, thought to include a new assembly for 
Northern 
Ireland, are aimed at giving "focus and direction" to the debate. 
  It is hoped that Sinn Fein will accept the declaration as a 
basis for entering the democratic process. But it was stressed 
in Whitehall last night that they would not be able to unravel 
any agreements made once talks between the Government and the 
various parties have resumed on the new basis. A "taking stock" 
meeting Between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's Prime 
Minister, will take place in London on Feb 19, some two months 
after the declaration was signed. 
  Speaking in Dublin yesterday Mr Reynolds said that an early 
commitment to peace was now the test of true Irish patriotism. 
He warned republicans that the nationalist community as a whole 
stood to suffer most and risked losing ground if the declaration 
was rejected and IRA violence continued. 
  The time for a decision on peace was approaching, he said. 
"Nobody should succumb to the dangerous illusion that there is 
much more that can be offered at this stage of the peace 
process. Democratic governments will not be influenced by the 
threat of continued violence." 
  The Sinn Fein annual conference at the end of the month is 
increasingly being seen as a watershed for the Republicans. Mr 
Dick Spring, Irish Foreign Minister, said there were no fixed 
deadlines for a response but the conference seemed "a date of 
importance." 
  Sir Patrick, speaking in Londonderry, said the Government 
was 
prepared to move to the next stage without Sinn Fein or Mr Ian 
Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which has boycotted recent 
discussions because of its opposition to the Downing Street 
declaration.

  [Text] The IRA leadership is split over the Downing Street 
Ulster peace declaration according to security sources in the 
Irish Republic. 
  The terrorist group's seven-strong ruling Army Council was 
said to be divided 4-3 in favour of accepting the month-old 
joint Anglo-Irish initiative -- a majority not considered 
adequate to avoid the formation of a breakaway group backing 
continued violence, or to swing the hard-line republican 
movement as a whole behind peace. 
  And doubts about the statement signed by Prime Minister John 
Major and his Irish counterpart Albert Reynolds were reported to 
be widespread among grassroots supporters of the IRA and their 
Sinn Fein political spokesmen. 
  The Dublin sources said the general membership did not 
appear 
to have been given enough information by their leaders to make a 
decision. 
  The last of a series of consultative meetings organised by 
Sinn Fein to sound out their followers is due later this month, 
one week ahead of the party's annual conference in Dublin, the 
date now regarded as potentially vital by the Irish government. 
  Members are understood to be pressing for details of the 
document produced last year after discussions between Sinn Fein 
chief Gerry Adams, and John Hume, head of Ulster's Social 
Democratic and Labour Party, so that its contents could be 
compared with the Major-Reynolds declaration. 
  There is also said to be concern among the republicans about 
the failure of the Downing Street statement to mention the 
possibility of an amnesty for jailed terrorists on both sides of 
the Irish border. 
  IRA activists in several areas of Northern Ireland were 
reckoned to be blocking acceptance of the peace plan. 
  Within the Dublin-based security services, concern persists 
about the destination of huge IRA arms caches thought to be 
hidden at a number of secret locations throughout the Irish 
Republic. 
  Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds told the Dublin 
parliament today that he had no evidence to back up reports of 
divisions within the IRA. 
  And he remained doggedly optimistic of eventual IRA and Sinn 
Fein agreement to the joint peace declaration.

  [Text] Next week's Anglo-Irish summit in London will 
concentrate on reviewing the joint bid for peace in Northern 
Ireland, Dublin premier Albert Reynolds said today. 
  Mr Reynolds, due to meet John Major when both attend the 
February 19 England-Ireland rugby fixture at Twickenham, said 
the talks would involve Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and 
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring. 
  "The meeting will be a question of monitoring the situation 
relating to the Downing Street peace declaration, updating 
ourselves as to where it's at and having a general review of the 
progress of the declaration," he told the Dublin parliament. 
  Mr Reynolds, who on Monday [7 February] night received 
British proposals for resuming inter-party negotiations on 
Northern Ireland's future, said ministers from the two 
governments would consider how they could proceed to the next 
stage of the talks that stalled well over a year ago. 
  He insisted there was no "conflict or competition" between 
last year's December 15 peace statement and the British attempt 
to restart the talks. 
  "I do not see the peace declaration standing in the way of 
talks. I believe it gives the talks process a greater chance of 
success. There is now a new starting point because of the 
declaration." 
  Mr Spring said today the proposals received from Britain 
contained "a checklist of relevant points in relation to the 
recommencement of the talks process." 
  Mr Reynolds rejected calls in the Dail to publish details of 
his correspondence with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams. 
  He refused to depart from "a long-established tradition of 
confidentiality" regarding communications involving the head of 
government. 
  The premier said he sent a detailed letter to Mr Adams, 
backed up by a memorandum, in reply to a request for 
clarification of the Downing Street declaration. 
  "I have provided as much explanation and clarification as 
possible." 
  Mr Reynolds said he looked forward to an early response from 
the IRA and its Sinn Fein political spokesmen to the peace 
initiative. 
  While no deadline had been set, a lot of attention would 
naturally focus on Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin at 
the end of the month, he added. 
  He brushed aside opposition criticism of Dublin's attitude 
towards the granting by the US of a visa permitting Mr Adams to 
speak in America last week. 
  "The American administration took the decision and that was 
that. We don't get involved in trying to tell foreign 
administrations what kind of decisions to take." 
  Sinn Fein today put the blame for their slow response to the 
declaration on the [British] Government. 
  Party chairman Tom Hartley condemned London's "continued 
stubborn refusal" to clarify the declaration. 
  He said that in contrast to Britain's inflexibility, the 
Dublin government acted responsibly in the matter and its 
efforts were welcome and helpful. 
  "If John Major is serious about constructing a real peace 
process he should follow the lead given by Albert Reynolds, 
rather than pursuing the tried and failed policy of partition." 
  Mr Hartley said long-overdue clarification would allow every 
one to make a judgment of the London-Dublin plan. "Britain's 
refusal to do so is unnecessarily delaying our process of 
consultation and consideration." 
  Sir Patrick tonight emphasised the Government's 
determination 
to defeat terrorism. 
  "We shall continue to provide the security forces with the 
resources they need to bring those guilty of terrorist crime to 
account through the due process of law," he said during a visit 
to police and Army bases in north Belfast.

  [Text] Halle (DDP/ADN) -- The German crew members on board 
the AWACS aircraft [over Bosnia] will not be pulled out in the 
event of NATO air strikes on Serbian targets. Tomorrow's 
Halle-based MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG reports German air force 
spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Eike Krueger as saying: "That is 
not planned at present." Apart from the ability to locate enemy 
aircraft movements and antiaircraft radar, and pass that 
information on to friendly aircraft, the AWACS planes can, 
according to information from the paper, provide close air 
support and reconnaisance. 
  Krueger said that in the event of NATO air strikes, AWACS 
would not be used to carry out such an operation. However, he 
admitted that the system would continue to be active in the same 
way in the event of air strikes, thus supplying information for 
the operation. The presence of a tactical air control 
organization on the ground was however decisive for successful 
air strikes. 
  The AWACS flights have been monitoring the no-fly zone over 
Bosnia declared by NATO since last April.

<F P=106> [Report signed "Stue": "Guarantees for Vietnam Deals </F>
Demanded"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 7 Feb -- The Federation of German Industry 
(BDI) has called on the Federal Government to grant Hermes 
guarantees for business with Vietnam. West and east German 
companies are currently making intensive efforts for the 
Vietnamese market. They are pursuing "remarkable projects" 
there, a letter by BDI Main Manager Ludolf von Wartenberg to FRG 
Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union) of 3 
February says. However, the decisive handicap is the lack of 
Hermes guarantees. "A loss of the deals would be a considerable 
problem for German companies, because in particular decisions 
about a specific system are made in infrastructure projects with 
the first deal," the letter adds. At the end of 1990 Hermes 
guarantees for Vietnam were resumed. However, guarantees are 
possible only for short-term individual coverage with loan terms 
of not more than 360 days. The BDI sees the lifting of the U.S. 
trade embargo against Vietnam as a signal that should make Bonn 
guarantee medium- and long-term deals. 
  However, neither in the Finance Ministry nor in the 
Economics 
Ministry are there signs that the government might make 
concessions to industry. As long as the bilateral rescheduling 
agreement with Vietnam is being worked out, a decision is not to 
be expected, it was said. The multilateral agreement of the 
"Paris Club," which ensures favorable conditions for Vietnam (a 
remission of 50 percent of its debts), must still be implemented 
by the German Government. There are no reasons to be seen why in 
the case of Vietnam one should deviate from the tested rule of 
granting new guarantees only after old debts have been settled. 
Furthermore, Vietnam is able to pay its debts, it is noted, 
referring to the country's high trade surpluses in the past 
years. 
  German imports of 364 million German marks [DM] were set off 
by exports to Vietnam of DM78.4 billion in 1992. During the 
first three quarters of 1993 German exports amounted to DM145 
million, but Vietnam's export surplus still came up to DM215 
million. With a view to these figures, government officials 
come to the conclusion: "They do not want to pay."

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Network Of Russian Mafia Getting </F>
Tighter"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt -- The Russian Mafia has got large parts 
of Germany in its stranglehold. Beside Berlin -- the 
traditional center of East European criminal organizations -- 
Munich, Cologne, and Dusseldorf have become new centers of these 
criminal groups. Security authorities report that residents 
based in the Bavarian capital operate cartels in Berlin, 
receiving stolen goods, dealing in drugs, and smuggling antiques. 
  The key figure of the "Munich Russians" was for a long time 
a 
"businessman" whom police considered to be especially dangerous 
and brutal. His criminal life came to a mysterious end, with 30 
knife wounds in a parking lot. The man, who had numerous 
contacts with Russian immigrants in Berlin, the United States 
(Odessa Group, New York), Israel, Canada, and Poland, is said to 
have become a victim of the Italian Mafia in a dispute over drug 
supplies. 
  The authorities on the Rhine have been quite successful in 
their investigations. In a major investigation into exiled 
Russian suspects in the Cologne/Dusseldorf area, carried out 
under the code name "little flower," police could prove 
"business contacts" with 31 countries. But still, contact and 
information centers for organized Russian crime continue to 
exist in the area. The "governors" of the Russian Mafia are 
said to have excellent connections with politicians, business 
people, and various criminal groups in the CIS states. 
  German security authorities self-critically admit that the 
group of exiled Russian business people in particular has 
managed to establish "very complex networks of companies, 
irrespective of official institutions." They have close 
contacts with groups in the CIS, which operate on the "Italian 
example" there. According to Russian authorities, there are at 
least 5,000 groups on the territory of the former Soviet Union 
that are involved in organized crime. These groups have links 
to syndicates in the United States, Israel, Belgium, Poland, and 
Austria. 
  Police say that exiled Russian criminals operating from 
Germany use their international business structures and their 
"means of operating" -- joint-venture companies -- to commit 
"well-planned crimes of considerable impact." This includes 
drug dealing, the production and distribution of counterfeit 
money, the smuggling of gold and icons, fraud, and the forgery 
of documents. The production of evidence is, however, proving 
extremely difficult.

<F P=106> [Report signed "deu": "Scharping: Union Campaign Is </F>
Disgusting"] 
  [Text] Hannover/Bonn -- Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping has announced that he intends to 
request all Stasi records about himself to subsequently publish 
them together with a description of his experiences. Scharping 
thus reacted to accusations from the Union parties that in the 
1980's he had advocated the recognition of GDR citizenship in 
talks with GDR politicians. The Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] politicians had based their accusations on Stasi files. 
  Before an SPD Presidium meeting in Hannover Scharping 
harshly 
criticized the "campaign of the Union." The accusation that SPD 
politicians had cooperated too closely with the GDR is 
"disgusting and indecent," the SPD chairman said. In particular 
the campaign against SPD presidential candidate Johannes Rau is 
"so mean that I can only be surprised that the chancellor is 
participating in it." Obviously, the chancellor is in deep 
trouble; he refuses any discussion about the central topics, 
such as work and finances. "When conservatives struggle for 
staying in government, then they use almost any means," 
Scharping said. Chancellor Helmut Kohl had accused the Social 
Democrats of having betrayed the goal of Germany's reunification 
by making concessions to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany 
[SED] and had in particular attacked Johannes Rau. 
  Deputy CDU Chairwoman Angela Merkel meanwhile stated that 
she 
sees the accusation against Rau that during his candidacy for 
the chancellor's office he had intended to offer recognition to 
the GDR "refuted" for the time being. Rau stated that what was 
meant at that time was respect for the GDR citizenship but not 
recognition, Merkel said. "For me this is acceptable for now." 
  However, for her the suspicion that the SPD cooperated with 
the SED for the benefit of help in the election campaign remains 
the "very critical point," Merkel stated. "I believe that this 
is a point that exceeds a certain limit," the women's affairs 
minister, who comes from eastern Germany, said. Rau has not 
given sufficient explanations on this issue. Merkel denied that 
the CDU wants to use the controversy about the past as 
ammunition against the SPD in the election campaign. Her party 
only wants "historical clarification." 
  Merkel and CDU Deputy Rainer Eppelmann, who is chairman of 
the Expert Committee on the GDR Past, had sent an open letter to 
Rau, asking him about the controversial contacts between the SPD 
and the GDR leadership at the end of the 1980's. Rau also 
answered with a letter.

<F P=106> [Report by Eugen Georg Schwarz: "Scharping Surpasses Kohl"] </F>
  [Text] It is a mystery to the chancellor's friends and to 
the chancellor himself in particular: The Germans say that he 
has more political experience than his challenger Rudolf 
Scharping. They stress that he acts better as a statesman, he 
has a considerably higher reputation abroad, and he has the same 
ability to push through what he wants. However, only a minority 
-- just 29 percent -- would vote for him in direct elections 
because Scharping has more "charisma" and, thus, gets 43 percent 
of the votes. 
  However, even the challenger cannot be completely satisfied 
with this glorious result of opinion research in January, 
because as many as 27 percent of the Germans in the new laender, 
as well as 14 percent in the west, said: "We would not vote for 
either of them." Twelve percent in the east and the west do not 
know whom they would prefer as chancellor. 
  However, one thing is certain: The reputation of the Federal 
Government and the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union [CDU/CSU] is falling deeper and deeper into the icy depths 
of opinion. As a result, large circles, in particular the CDU, 
are shivering: Only about one-quarter of the Germans expect the 
government led by the CDU to master the "current main political 
problems and tasks best," while 39 percent think that of the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. 
  Only in economic policy (38 to 30 percent) and in combating 
crime (29 to 28 percent) is the coalition expected to be a bit 
more competent than an SPD-led government. In all other fields, 
the trust in the chancellor and in his team has waned. Be it in 
unemployment (17 to 45 percent), tax policy (21 to 43 percent), 
state debts (25 to 27 percent) or in social policy (13 to 64 
percent), the majority says: "The Social Democrats would be 
better able to solve the problems." This applies even to one of 
the current domains of the CDU/CSU as the guarding of price 
stability. A total of 31 percent of those polled thought that 
here, too, the SPD would do better (coalition: 27 percent). 
  Those in the Konrad-Adenauer House [CDU headquarters] and in 
the Chancellor's Office in Bonn, who have not yet dressed warmly 
in view of these figures, are beginning to freeze: Only 18 
percent of the Germans want a coalition government under the 
leadership of the CDU or a CDU/CSU government, but 32 percent 
think: The SPD should rule on its own or should be the decisive 
force in a coalition. 
  Despite these devastating results of the FOCUS poll, the 
CDU/CSU has not yet completely lost among the voters. Facing 
the decision of making a cross on the voting slip for the 
Bundestag elections here and now, 34 percent (minus 1 percentage 
point compared with December 1993) would still vote for the 
CDU/CSU, while 39 percent would vote for the SPD (plus/minus 
zero). 
  Just like before the Bundestag elections in 1990, the polls 
in the new laender are damaging the CDU/CSU's hopes for winning 
the all-German elections. While in western Germany, 37 percent 
would again vote for the CDU/CSU, in eastern Germany, the CDU 
would get only a meager 23 percent. Here, the old communists of 
the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] would get a proud 16.5 
percent of the votes of mourning GDR nostalgics, which, however, 
would not be enough for entering the Bonn parliament again 
because of the nationwide 4-percent threshold, unless Gysi and 
company managed to get a direct mandate. 
  The strategists of the CDU/CSU can turn these figures around 
as much as they want: At the moment, the coalition is so far 
removed from a majority among the population as Helmut Schmidt 
with his Social-Liberal team in the past. Together with the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] (8 percent), the CDU/CSU 
would get 42 percent of the votes. The SPD and the Greens (10 
percent), on the other hand, would get 49 percent of the votes 
and thus have a sufficiently solid majority in the Bundestag, 
because, in addition to the PDS, Republikaner (3 percent) and 
"others" (2 percent) would not enter the Bundestag either. 
  However, if the parties were to take into consideration only 
these results, they might reckon without their actual host, 
namely those who have not yet decided. A total of 26 percent of 
those eligible to vote do not yet know which party they will 
vote for. The struggle for votes will focus primarily on them 
because their decision can change the election result to such an 
extent that it will give the lie to the election forecasts. 
  The real surprise, however, which everyone -- from Helmut 
Kohl and Theo Waigel to Klaus Kinkel and Rudolf Scharping -- can 
enjoy is the low number of those Germans who would not vote at a 
Bundestag election. On behalf of FOCUS, Basis Research asked 
1,500 people eligible to vote (of them 1,000 in western Germany) 
and only 12 percent of them answered: "I will not vote." This 
means that the turnout would definitely be over 80 percent. 
Thus, the often- mentioned "disenchantment with politics" would 
just be an empty shell. 
  The Bundestag elections will be won by those who give a 
convincing answer to the dominant question: Who will finally 
lead us, how and when, out of the economic low and get the 
almost 4 million unemployed back to work? 
  All over Germany, the present "general" economic situation 
is rated very poorly: 49 percent say it is "bad" or "very bad." 
Only 15 percent think it is "good" or even "very good" (1 
percent). A total of 35 percent think it is neither good nor 
bad. 
  This mood is bound to send shivers down the spines of 
politicians, unless there were the replies to the following 
question: "How do you assess your personal economic situation?" 
To this question, 6 percent replied "very good," 53 percent 
"good," 30 percent "neither good nor bad," a mere 9 percent said 
"bad," and 2 percent "very bad." 
  It seems that those who have always said "the mood is worse 
than the actual situation" are right. 
  Even in the new laender, the polling institutes spot 
contentment -- not even four years after the "monetary union." 
A total of 45 percent say: "I am fine or even very fine." Only 
15 percent complain: "I am in a bad or even a very bad way." 
Forty percent reply: "neither/nor." 
  The level of optimism is not going down either: Only 15 
percent of Germans see a dark future and fear that they might be 
worse off in a year's time. But 19 percent are convinced: "I 
will be better off then." A total of 66 percent think that 
their economic situation will not change. 
  Here, too, there is a big gap between the "personal" and 
"general" economic situations, for the Germans do not assess the 
economic future of their country as brightly as their own. Only 
2 percent are convinced that "things will be much better in a 
year's time." "Somewhat better," is how 29 percent rate the 
year 1995. "The same," say 40 percent, "somewhat worse," 23 
percent, and 5 percent say it will be "much worse." 
  If one compares the positive and the negative replies, the 
following becomes apparent: Optimism is growing. In February 
1993, the relation between "things will get better" and "things 
will get worse" was 26:38 percent; in January 1994, the ratio 
was 31:28 percent. The curve of optimism reached its peak in 
June 1993: Back then, 35 percent thought that things will be 
"better" in a year's time, while only 26 percent said that 
things will get "worse." 
  The elections will be won by those who can present the most 
convincing answers to the questions that most bother the voters: 
unemployment (the biggest problem for 58 percent), economic 
policy (26 percent), social policy (24), fighting radicalism 
(23), foreigners (20), and internal security (19 percent). 
  The election campaign arena is set. The match can begin.
