<F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "Martinazzoli Versus De Mita: </F>
`His Remarks Are Merely Insults'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- It was a sharp slap in the face: Nobody 
likes to hear themselves being called "nonexistent," accused of 
submissiveness to an "idiot" -- even if that idiot's name is 
[Pact for Italy leader] Mariotto Segni. [Italian Popular Party, 
PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli said nothing. Nothing to 
journalists, nothing to his aides, and nothing even to those 
working with him to draw up lists of candidates. It must have 
been difficult not to comment even to his closest associates on 
the bomb dropped by De Mita in the very heart of what used to be 
the DC [Christian Democratic Party] left. To ignore the 
announcement that, amid so many problems, the "great outcast" is 
planning to wage war, within a PPI that he can see sliding to 
the right, into the arms of [Northern League leader] Bossi and 
[Forza Italian leader] Berlusconi. But in the evening 
Martinazzoli's rage exploded: "Let him by all means occupy an 
opposition stance within the party; that is his right. But," 
Martinazzoli said, "I consider some of his remarks entirely 
unjust. They are insults, rather than arguments. And I greatly 
regret the fact." 
  The secretary was furious, hurt, and worried. This is 
because he is fully aware that De Mita is not alone in thinking 
those things, as he witnesses the disappearance or the collapse, 
one by one, of the candidates, representing all groups, of the 
old left -- De Mita, Bodrato, Tina Anselmi, Granelli, Mancino, 
and Mattarella. Moreover, in the shadow of the axis with Segni, 
there is again a growing fear that the "ideologue," Rocco 
Buttiglione, could realize the dream of a DC "controlled by 
Communion and Liberation." 
  In fact the PPI [Italian Popular Party] leadership realized 
at once that the secretary had read De Mita's interview 
carefully. They inferred it from Martinazzoli's response to the 
reckless person who asked him to reveal his plans for the coming 
days: "But we do not even know what the world will be like next 
week." The questions subsided, but his silence was not enough 
to quell his anger. And when he drove off from his home at 1600 
Martinazzoli looked extremely grim. This, even though he was on 
his way to meet not with "the Irpinia progressive ethnic group" 
(as PPI leaders call De Mita's supporters) but with the 
officials of CIDA, the Business Managers' Federation. 
  He arrived dressed in blue, on edge, smoking a cigarette, 
with a look that said: "Don't come near me or I'll kill you." 
But television Channel 1 journalist Mimmo Sacco -- who has 
devoured several DC secretaries -- was brave enough to approach 
him. He knew exactly where he was driving, but he took an 
oblique approach, asking whether there are still any "problems" 
with Segni. His prudence did not spare him an attack: "You must 
stop it. It is you who have fabricated these ruptures and 
disputes. I have had enough of it." Sacco did not give up, and 
craftily talked about Occhetto, about strong men, even 
succeeding in making the secretary smile. He took advantage of 
this to ask his key question: What about De Mita? This time 
Martinazzoli did not even answer: He rolled his eyes, shook his 
head, spluttered, "What, again?" and made off, turning his back 
on Sacco. 
  At 1900 he returned to PPI headquarters. Rosy Bindi had just 
left. It is well known that she does not like the right. So, 
did she like what De Mita had to say? "His interview confirms 
that he has tremendous political acumen," she replied with 
conviction. So is he correct? Are the PPI's lists really in 
danger of providing a stepping stone to a life to the right of 
Segni? "We are indeed working to ensure that this does not 
happen." 
  That is not exactly the official line. This, though 
Martinazzoli did make hints at his meeting with CIDA officials: 
He stepped up his attack on a Right that he swore he did not 
want to ally with, a right that "if it continues this way 
threatens to be victorious," a Right that "is anything but what 
the country needs, and that will lead Italy back to the years of 
autarchy" -- a Right that has "a real leader who is neither 
[Northern League leader] Bossi nor [Italian Social Movement] 
leader Fini" and within which the League "no longer represents a 
break but has become an amalgamating force." 
  This is consistent, according to his associates; "it is what 
he has always thought; he does not need to reply to De Mita." 
They too are angry with De Mita who is "obsessed with being at 
the center of the world"; "who is now attacking CAF [Craxi, 
Andreotti, Forlani], though in 1989 he curbed Martinazzoli, 
arguing the `realism' of the agreement with Forlani"; who "would 
be right if it were true--which it is not--that he was left off 
the electoral list without anyone having asked him to make such 
a generous gesture..." Silvia Costa also defended the 
secretary: "What? If we have always claimed that parliamentary 
representation is a service, why should someone get angry over 
their seat? De Mita is wrong: Unfortunately, it was the way in 
which he was asked not to run that turned his personal candidacy 
into a political one." 
  But these remarks came from the first floor, contrasting 
with 
the sepulchral silence that reigned on the second floor -- in 
the inner sanctum, until Maria Eletta Martini emerged. So what 
about De Mita? she did not reply, drew a sigh, and shrugged. 
Are you turning to the right? She was about to shrug again, 
then stopped herself and blurted: "Ciriaco is expressing 
well-founded anxieties, with which I fully agree. But I 
interpret them as anxieties, whereas he talks about them as 
faits accomplis. In fact, after all, the elections have not yet 
taken place. As you know, we are in a difficult situation. We 
have loyally supported what was certainly not a progressive 
government and have had to form handicapped alliances." And 
were they fair with De Mita over his candidacy? This time the 
old De Mita supporter became heated: "On this point De Mita is 
entirely in the right. We treated him like dirt, like some kid 
who should stand aside. I have said so, too." A few feet away, 
Martinazzoli's press officer blanched. But by this point she 
was unstoppable. And when someone asked her whether she trusts 
Segni she looked at him as though he were crazy: "No, for 
goodness' sake." These are difficult times for Martinazzoli.

<F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the </F>
Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, and Deputy Secretary Massimo 
D'Alema by Roberto Roscani; place and date not given: 
"Occhetto: `Craxi's Slander'"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Roscani] You refer to the 
poisoned fruits of Craxism. Do you have the names? 
  [Occhetto] I have said this many times and I will repeat it: 
Berlusconism is the product of Craxism. Anyone writing about 
the history of Italy would link these two phenomena. On the 
other hand, just two or three years ago even a child would have 
answered Berlusconi if asked which businessman was linked to 
Craxi. Now it seems to be blasphemy but we know how important 
historical memories are. 
  [Roscani] You have said that the word of a malefactor has 
become the yardstick of justice. This means that the PDS 
intends changing all legislation that favors those who confess, 
because this is what has happened to date in Italy. 
  [Occhetto] You have distorted my statement in saying this: I 
spoke about the word of a malefactor becoming a yardstick of 
false justice. 
  [D'Alema] And then we are not aware of the fact the Craxi is 
a confessor, if anything, he is a recidivist. If we want to 
talk seriously about emergency legislation, however, let us do 
so, but it has nothing to do with all this. 
  [Roscani] Honorable Occhetto, in these days there has also 
been the [PDS official] Morandina case and the judicial notices 
of investigation to the DC [Christian Democratic party] heads in 
the Veneto region. What is your opinion about this? 
  [Occhetto] I learned about the Morandina case from the 
press. 
He made statements saying that these accounts belonged to him. 
This situation does not convince me and I hope that the 
judicial authorities will help us understand what has happened. 
We would be extremely severe with anyone who may have abused 
the name of the PDS for its own illicit activities. 
  [Roscani] This morning the front page of all the newspapers 
read: D'Alema under investigation. Do you mean that all the 
press misunderstood? 
  [Occhetto] The current state of the situation is this: Craxi 
accused Occhetto, D'Alema, Stefanini, and others. D'Alema went 
to lodge a counteraccusation. As a result D'Alema was reported 
as being under investigation. I said that it could be a case, 
which would then hold true for everybody, of the automatic 
application of Article 835 of the Code on Proceedings which has 
a purely technical significance and not the political and 
judicial significance attributed in some newspaper headlines. 
Accused by Craxi: This is our situation today. 
  [D'Alema] Neither you nor I can know if a name is included 
in 
the register of those under investigation. Nobody can know, nor 
must they know. A person is under investigation if he receives a 
judicial notice to that effect. I have received none. 
  [Roscani] The newspapers have been going on with these 
rumors 
for two years now. 
  [D'Alema] I am not able to confirm or deny this for the 
simple reason that I do not know. None of us can know. 
  [Occhetto] If the public prosecutor's office does its work 
properly your case and our case are identical: that of people 
who do not know. Because if we were to know, this would mean 
that one aspect of that institution has been violated. In fact, 
that one aspect is secrecy. 
  [Roscani] Do you think that Craxi's move is a means of 
supporting Berlusconi's electoral campaign? 
  [D'Alema] Occhetto has been very clear. Objectively it is, 
even though this does not mean that there was an agreement or a 
plot.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Berlusconi to D'Alema: `I Am Sorry, </F>
Best Wishes'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi 
about [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Deputy Secretary] 
Massimo D'Alema. "I am sorry to hear this news. I am very 
deeply sorry. I really don't approve of people who rejoice when 
a political opponent gets into such a situation." Silvio 
Berlusconi was talking during a long interview on GR-1 radio. 
"I prefer to think positively," the Forza Italia leader said, 
"if there has to be political competition, let it be honest 
competition, in which everyone confronts each other on the basis 
of party programs. I say this very sincerely, I do not like to 
see these things happen." Berlusconi after expressing the wish 
that the election campaign "become unpoisoned," dwelt on the 
subject of the judiciary. "I'd like to think that one does not 
find in the judiciary the strong politicization which many 
believe to be there, and there are no judges and magistrates who 
act in the service not only of the law, but in the service of an 
ideology or even a political faction." "I believe that judges 
and magistrates," Berlusconi added, "should feel that it is part 
of their function to be above parties. If a judge becomes 
politically biased, I believe that he is no longer a judge. My 
wish is that they are conscious of the responsibility of their 
function, and that all of them, in the north, in the south, even 
if they have sympathies to the right, the left or the center, 
realize that this is what is important."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Scalfaro Overly Solicitous Toward </F>
Occhetto"] 
  [Text] Milan -- For the Northern League, the reactions to 
the "judicial matters involving the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left]" last Wednesday [16 February] are "serious and alarming." 
In particular, we read in a release from the League's press 
office that the "worrying" approach taken by President of the 
Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro toward PDS Secretary Achille 
Occhetto is open to criticism. "The Northern League," we read 
in the communique, considers as unacceptable the statements made 
by PDS member of parliament Correnti, for whom "justice is too 
serious a matter to be left in the hands of the judiciary," and 
is even more concerned at the intervention of the head of state 
who, after convening the chairmen of the lower house and the 
Senate to the Quirinale [president's palace], felt obliged to 
reassure Occhetto, explaining to him that he himself was acting 
as guarantor of a correct and calm outcome of the election 
campaign, with the responsible assistance of all the organs of 
state, the judiciary included, evidently." 
  The memo also includes several statements by Roberto Ronchi, 
in charge of the political secretariat, who wonders "why 
Scalfaro did not show a similar concern when, during the past 
electoral campaigns, other political forces were involved." 
"The League genuinely hopes," Ronchi wrote, "that this 
election, which is so important for the future of our country, 
will not be disturbed by the final thrashings of a style of 
politics now in its death throws."

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart 
Albert Reynolds pledged today to continue the search for peace 
and political progress in Northern Ireland. 
  In 75 minutes of talks in Downing Street -- the first since 
they signed their historic Ulster peace declaration two months 
ago -- they took stock of developments on their joint initiative 
to end the spiral of violence. 
  Hours before their discussions began they were given a grim 
reminder of the continuing terrorism. 
  A series of firebomb attacks in seven London stores bore all 
the hallmarks of the Provisonal IRA, said Scotland Yard. 
  As they left Downing Street, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds united 
in condemning the incidents and recent terrorist attacks in 
Northern Ireland 
  Mr Major said: "Our response to that is entirely identical. 
There is absolutely no justification for those firebombs 
overnight any more than there is justification for the killing 
of a community police officer in Belfast last week or the other 
atrocities that have taken place in Northern Ireland." 
  The prime ministers agreed to initiate a new round of 
negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland with or without a 
response from the IRA and their Sinn Fein allies to the December 
15 peace declaration. 
  Mr Reynolds said officials from the two governments would 
agree later today on a date for a meeting of their liaison 
committee to advance the next stage of the talks process. 
  Mr Major insisted: "There is a route now open for Sinn Fein 
to join the constitutional process -- they know what they have 
to do. All they have to do is give up violence and then they 
will have a proper route to express their views 
constitutionally." 
  Mr Reynolds again stressed his view that the road to peace 
was going to be a long one and that there would be difficulties 
along the way. 
  "We knew there would always be people on both sides on the 
paramilitaries who would be trying to stop our best efforts. 
  "But regardless of this violence and destruction that takes 
place we will continue along that difficult road, recognising 
that people will be trying to frustrate our efforts but that 
they will not succeed." 
  Today's meeting went ahead before the two prime ministers 
join the crowd at Twickenham for the Ireland-England rugby 
international. Mr Major referred to the match as he and Mr 
Reynolds began a brief news conference outside 10 Downing Street 
by saying he had brought along his second row. 
  "We are wholly united in our approach to try to find a 
solution to the problems of Northern Ireland," he added. 
  "We regard our joint declaration as a foundation stone for 
the future approach of the two governments. We are committed to 
it and its lasting value. We see it as a balanced statement of 
lasting principles, and it is our view that its value has 
already been clearly shown in the way it has been received both 
in Ireland and internationally." 
  Mr Major said it was impossible for either he or Mr Reynolds 
to say whether the IRA would give up its campaign of violence in 
the near future. 
  "What we are utterly agreed about is that there is no 
justification for the continuation of violence by the 
Provisionals or by anybody else. What must be fully understood 
is that we are not waiting for the Provisionals or anybody else. 
  "We have taken further steps in the talks process and we 
have 
this morning reaffirmed our joint commitment to that process. 
No one should be able to veto progress on the talks. We have 
made clear what Sinn Fein needs to do to join the process. 
  "They are free to come in or they are free to stay out -- if 
that is what they choose. But what they can't do is hold up our 
determination to continue with the talks process and endeavour 
to find a solution." 
  The two premiers agreed to maintain the current high level 
of 
cooperation on security and do all they could to oppose 
terrorism. 
  Mr Major said he believed improved security cooperation was 
of immense help in recent years, and that was going to continue. 
  "The intention that we both have is peace. We'd like it soon 
but however long it takes our determination is to continue a 
search for that peace."

  [Text] IRA violence will not deter Irish prime minister 
Albert Reynolds' belief in the two-month-old Anglo-Irish 
Northern Ireland peace declaration, he insisted today. 
  As terrorist experts investigated the cause of the fires 
which broke out at seven stores in central London this morning, 
Mr Reynolds again stressed there was still no deadline for an 
IRA response to December's joint initiative. 
  The Dublin premier was speaking before new talks at Downing 
Street with John Major on prospects for ending the terrorism -- 
against a background of the Oxford Street firebombings at the 
end of last month and renewed IRA violence earlier this week. 
  The new IRA attacks -- including the first murder this year 
-- were being seen as a thumbs-down for the talks process. 
  But Mr Reynolds said: "If somebody thinks I'll just give up 
because we have another unfortunate killing or attacks, they 
should know it is not going to stop me. 
  "We are on a mission of peace and will continue with it 
until 
we are absolutely satisfied there is no hope left. That is the 
way I feel at the moment -- and I am going to continue on that 
road." 
  Mr Reynolds arrived in London last night with Deputy Premier 
and Foreign Minister Dick Spring for their first meeting with Mr 
Major and Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew since 
the December 15 signing of the Ulster declaration. 
  Early indications were that this morning's store attacks 
were 
carried out by the IRA. The outbreaks were caused by incendiary 
devices which bore "all the hallmarks of the Provisional IRA", 
said Scotland Yard. 
  But the Irish team made clear they were more determined than 
ever to keep alive the prospects for peace. 
  As Mr Reynolds consulted officials before heading for 
Downing 
Street, he agreed the renewed terrorism -- demonstrated by both 
the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries in Belfast this week -- was 
"disappointing". 
  He asserted, however: "I am still very hopeful of the 
chances 
for peace. There has been considerable progress already as I 
see it. I have said from the very start that I did not believe 
there would be a quick decision on the part of the republican 
movement. 
  "Their decision is of historic proportions, and it will 
inevitably take time. There is an intense debate going on in 
Ireland north and south among the republicans." 
  Mr Reynolds said he thought there was considerable support 
from members of the IRA and Sinn Fein for the peace declaration 
in the run-up to their annual conference in Dublin next weekend. 
  "I have no intention of setting a deadline. That is not the 
way we are going to get a result at the end of the day," he 
added, basing his assessment on contacts he has had with 
community leaders on both sides of the Ulster border. 
  After their talks, Mr Major and Mr Reynolds will join the 
crowd at the England-Ireland rugby international at Twickenham. 
  Later, in what sounded like a direct message to Sinn Fein, 
Mr 
Reynolds said there was sufficient in the explanations and 
clarifications of the Downing Street Declaration "to enable the 
debate to come to a conclusion". 
  Considerable progress had been made towards peace since the 
publication of the declaration in mid-December, he told BBC 
Radio 4's Today programme shortly before his Downing Street 
talks. 
  "I have said from the start I did not believe there would be 
any quick decision in this regard. I think the intense debate 
that is continuing in the republican movement is what I expected 
it to be -- very intense. For them to come to a decision of 
historic proportions will inevitably take time." 
  While he thought there was growing support among 
nationalists 
for peace "a slim majority would not really be acceptable among 
the republican movement. 
  "Nobody wants a split in that movement again -- the split in 
the 1970's brought the last 25 years of violence and we do not 
want another 25 years of violence. 
  "Whatever time it takes to finish that debate and to ensure 
a 
very large majority of republican supporters would go along with 
the peace process -- that is what we want and that is what we 
are going to try to achieve."

  [Text] Air strikes now appear less likely in war-torn 
Bosnia after the handing-in of Serbian big guns -- and the 
intervention of the Russians, the prime minister said today. 
But speaking in Edinburgh at the start of engagements in 
Scotland, he said his optimism was heavily qualified with 
caution. 
  However Mr Major added that the situation in Bosnia had 
"greatly improved" in the last 24 hours. 
  "A large number of heavy weapons have been handed in and 
have 
been corralled, and are now under UN control" he said. 
  "That has been happening for two days now. It seems to be 
accelerating so it is certainly looking quite good at the 
moment." 
  Mr Major, who had earlier met Scottish business leaders, 
said: "I think it is everyone's hope air strikes can be avoided. 
  "The purpose of threatening air strikes was to stop the 
bombardment of Sarajevo and bring the heavy weapons under 
control. 
  "If that can be done by negotiation, and it seems possible 
-- 
we can't yet be certain that it will be, but it seems possible 
that it might -- that is clearly very good news." 
  The prime minister said he was "very pleased" at the 
Russian's intervention in the former Yugoslavia. 
  "The Russians are a member of the permanent five of the 
Security Council and have a very considerable influence in that 
role, and a very considerable historical influence and 
relationship with the Serbs. I think their involvement is bound 
to be helpful and I welcome it." 
  He declined to say if he had persuaded President Yeltsin to 
take the decisive step during his visit to Russia earlier this 
week, but agreed he discussed Bosnia with him. 
  "I certainly express the view both privately and publicly 
that it was helpful for Russia, the U.S., and the European 
Community separately to use their influence and I am delighted 
the Russians are doing that." 
  Mr Major said he had no fears that the United Nations would 
be unable to control the Russian forces in Bosnia. 
  "I would have no concern about that at all," Mr Major said 
in 
interviews for the BBC and Scottish Television. 
  "When the Russian forces arrive they will be part and parcel 
of the general command structure and I have no doubt at all they 
will come under UN control and make a material contribution." 
  Changes in Russia in recent years have been profound and it 
was in everyone's interests to support the Russians, he said. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said his country was 
discussing with the UN how many Russian troops would be deployed 
around Sarajevo. He would know the figure "in a matter of 
hours".

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F>
Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux and Franz-Olivier Giesbert; place and 
date not given: "Leotard: `No One Should Doubt Our 
Determination'"] 
  [Text] NATO's ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of heavy 
weapons from around Sarajevo expires on Sunday [20 February] at 
midnight. In this interview, given before the declarations of 
Radovan Karadzic, Defense Minister Francois Leotard underlines 
France's determination. 
  [LE FIGARO] How will the international community, NATO, and 
the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] evaluate whether or not the 
ultimatum has been respected? 
  [Leotard] The UNPROFOR's opinion will be the decisive 
factor. 
It will be up to UNPROFOR Commander General Rose, and above him, 
General Cot, to decide on the reality of the situation on the 
ground. 
  This is a twofold reality. First, it requires the cessation 
of the bombardments of the civilian population in accordance 
with the text adopted by NATO on 9 February. Second, it 
concerns the withdrawal of heavy weapons. 
  After the expiry of the ultimatum deadline, we will have to 
examine the results on Monday morning. The UNPROFOR will issue 
its opinion to the governments of the NATO countries. We 
ourselves will be in constant contact with our allies to 
evaluate compliance with the withdrawal requirement. 
  If this evaluation is negative, then the measures planned by 
NATO will be put into action. No one should doubt our 
determination to apply the decisions that were made in Brussels. 
  [LE FIGARO] Air strikes could be decided, then, simply by 
agreement between the allies? Will it not also require another 
meeting of the UN Security Council or the NATO Council? 
  [Leotard] The decision will be a political one after an 
analysis of the facts by General Cot, Mr. Akashi, and Admiral 
Boorda, while, of course, keeping the UN secretary general 
informed. The UN-NATO procedure is in accordance with what was 
decided in August 1993 and translates UN resolution 836. 
  [LE FIGARO] Has France, independently of the allies, set a 
threshold below which it would consider that the ultimatum has 
not been respected? 
  [Leotard] We remain totally free to make up our minds in the 
framework of the NATO resolution. We do not have to set a 
threshold, that is to say how many weapons, when, how, and 
where... If weapons remain, and the Serbs must be aware of this, 
then they will be, and I quote from the Brussels communique, 
"exposed to air strikes." 
  The question is not therefore who will decide, because that 
decision has already been made. If there is a question then it 
could be: Do you want to make one strike on 50 guns or on a few 
guns for 50 minutes? That, however, is just a problem of air 
strike tactics. Weapons have already been gathered together on 
both sides, but we are still nowhere near what is required. If 
the ultimatum deadline were to end halfway, I can tell you that 
the decision to strike would have been made immediately. 
  [LE FIGARO] Let us use a more favorable hypothesis, that is 
of the ultimatum being respected by Sunday night. What are the 
military consequences then? 
  [Leotard] There will be air and ground patrols. Air patrols 
by the aircraft that have for some time been engaged in 
reconnaissance missions over Sarajevo; and ground patrols by 
UNPROFOR units -- French, Ukrainian, and Egyptian, with the 
current reinforcements from Malaysia and Jordan, and perhaps 
other units too. We cannot exclude, either, British and French 
troops being redeployed. 
  [LE FIGARO] With fresh units sent from France? 
  [Leotard] No, using those already in Yugoslavia. The 
government does not currently intend sending more soldiers from 
France to Sarajevo. 
  [LE FIGARO] A second hypothesis is that the ultimatum is 
not respected and that air strikes are carried out... 
  [Leotard] Air strikes have been the subject of a constant 
process of coordination between the leader of the NATO forces, 
Admiral Boorda, the UNPROFOR, and ourselves. As for telling you 
where, when, and how they will be implemented and whether it 
will be a warning strike or a general strike, do not even hope 
that I will tell you. That is military information that cannot 
be disclosed. 
  [LE FIGARO] So nothing is ruled out? 
  [Leotard] Nothing is ruled out -- no location, no weapon, no 
progression in the strikes. That is the very principle of 
deterrent. 
  [LE FIGARO] Certain pieces of Serbian artillery could be 
moved rapidly... 
  [Leotard] All that is known and has been taken into account 
by the operations staff. For several months, we have had lists 
of targets that are known both to the Air Force and to the 
Ground Troops. We will use all the means at our disposal. 
  [LE FIGARO] Before these air strikes are carried out, have 
steps been taken to protect the UN forces in Sarajevo or 
elsewhere in Bosnia? 
  [Leotard] Of course, some very solid precautions have been 
taken. However, we know only too well that they cannot cover 
every risk. We must be clear: The aggressors would be running 
a considerable risk. They must know that. 
  [LE FIGARO] Could this new measure influence humanitarian 
operations? 
  [Leotard] Since 9 February, the mission of the UN forces has 
changed somewhat. In Sarajevo the 3,000 or so troops are now 
intervening a lot more, while before they were hardly 
intervening at all, and as a result they are accompanying a lot 
fewer humanitarian convoys. 
  At the same time, there has been an increase in other types 
of humanitarian action. On Mount Zuc, a very important 
electricity line was destroyed by Serbian bombing. The French 
Engineer Corps is trying to repair it. If they succeed, it will 
be possible to restart the pumps that supply a part of Sarajevo 
with drinking water and to reactivate some heating facilities. 
That would be a real civilian victory which would restore the 
people's confidence. 
  [LE FIGARO] If there are air strikes, is there a parallel 
process of political attempts toward finding a solution? 
  [Leotard] The whole operation consists of using force on the 
one hand while above all proposing negotiation on the other. I 
have said several times that the use of force itself is 
senseless if it has no other aim. 
  It is all the more true that the air strikes are not an end 
in themselves. They are a way of protecting the civilian 
population and bringing the belligerents, in particular the 
Serbs and the Bosnians, together around the negotiating table. 
You saw that, on Tuesday, the meeting that had been planned at 
the airport was cancelled by the Bosnian party. 
  [LE FIGARO] Did that seem to you to be a serious sign? 
  [Leotard] Neither party has any reason to exclude itself 
from 
discussions. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is there the risk of the UN troops being caught 
in the crossfire? 
  [Leotard] As I said, for several weeks now there have been 
no 
risk-free policies. There are hopeless policies, such as 
getting bogged down, but there are no longer any risk-free 
policies. We have to accept a degree of risk if we want to free 
ourselves from this deadlocked situation, where humanitarian 
convoys are being attacked, people are being pinned down, and 
supplies are increasingly failing to get through. We have 
examined this situation with the other European powers that are 
the most actively involved in Bosnia. All our policies include 
a degree of risk, if we try to maintain the previous situation, 
if we withdraw, or if we keep to the stance taken today. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do these risks also include the problem of 
moving 
from being the peace-keeper to the peace-maker? 
  [Leotard] Everything I have just described is the 
consequence 
and the strict application of resolution 836. That is what I 
recently told the Russians. We are only applying a resolution 
that was adopted unanimously by the members of the Security 
Council. 
  I notice that, while we are applying it in Sarajevo, it is 
not being respected in Bihac, Tuzla, or Srebenica. The United 
Nations identified six safe areas, but we are only applying this 
resolution in Sarajevo. 
  [LE FIGARO] Through a lack of resources or a lack of 
political will? 
  [Leotard] For the moment, through a lack of resources, 
because, since resolution 836 was passed in June 1993, no 
country has responded to France's call or followed our lead. 
However, we have to ask ourselves whether we really do want to 
apply the UN resolutions. As we speak, Bihac is being bombed, 
Tuzla is being bombed, and Srebenica is being bombed by 
aggressors who are going unpunished. 
  [LE FIGARO] At the 11 January NATO summit, the French 
priority was Tuzla and Srebenica.... 
  [Leotard] The massacre perpetrated on 5 February made 
international public opinion aware of the seriousness of the 
situation in Sarajevo. The situation is, keeping things in 
proportion, a little less serious in Tuzla and, generally, in 
the Bihac enclave. However, we are not abandoning any of our 
aims. You know that French troops are currently on the ground 
in Bihac. 
  In addition, in the European Union's plan, which is and 
which 
will remain the diplomatic objective, the area around Sarajevo 
is considered as having the right to UN administration for two 
years. France is looking for this plan to be applied. If we 
manage to find a solution for Sarajevo, maybe it will serve as a 
model. 
  [LE FIGARO] The United Nations came to Yugoslavia with the 
agreement of all three parties.... 
  [Leotard] Yes, and we remain there on that understanding. We 
currently hold Sarajevo airport with the agreement of both 
belligerents. There is permanently one Serb and one Bosnian in 
the control tower monitoring aircraft arrivals. 
  To move from a situation where the trucks will no longer be 
painted white in the colors of the United Nations but will 
instead be painted khaki and be accompanied by tanks, 
helicopters, and artillery, is not currently an option for us. 
  I know that some people find it hard to believe and that 
they 
want to "do battle." We have neither the UN mandate that is 
required to do that, nor the decision or the support of the 
French people and Parliament. France has not declared war on 
Serbia, nor has any of the other 30 nations declared war on any 
of the three protagonists. Many people would like it to be a 
black and white affair, but we have to accept a situation whose 
very complexity is the result of post-communism. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is it possible to avoid the logic of war? 
  [Leotard] It is true that we are on the fringes of the 
military and the humanitarian. If the French, the British, and 
anyone else had decided to go to war with Serbia, things would 
have appeared a lot less complicated. We would have been 
stronger with regard to resources, weapons, or troop numbers. 
The Serbs would certainly also have been less arrogant. 
However, we have not made any such decision and I do not think 
we should. We are intervening in one country, Bosnia 
Herzegovina, that is recognized by the United Nations, and which 
has a president, a Parliament, and which contains warring 
factions. We are not intervening between two states. 
  [LE FIGARO] All three parties in this UN-recognized state 
have formally accepted the European plan for partitioning the 
country. Is this plan viable? 
  [Leotard] The European Union's plan must be one stage on the 
path toward a final objective. Considerable progress will have 
been made when the three parties have signed and are respecting 
a cease-fire agreement. 
  The next stage would be for the three parties to discuss, 
negotiate, and become more open with each other. A no-hope 
solution, on the other hand, would be if each party became 
entrenched behind its lines of barbed wire -- that would be 
absurd. 
  The strength of the European action plan is that it has been 
accepted by all three parties and that it is the only one that 
exists. It is designed to favor the return to a stable 
situation, giving people time to once more adapt to peace and 
civilized life. Civilized life comes through exchange, not 
through entrenchment. 
  [LE FIGARO] Does that mean that a Bosnian Federation remains 
the political objective? 
  [Leotard] To be a man of peace means having a great deal of 
humility. I do not see how we could decree solutions that today 
are violently refused by the parties. It cannot be imposed 
through war. In any case, no European state envisages that. 
  [LE FIGARO] For any initiative to succeed, do we not need 
the 
support of the whole international community, including the 
Russians? 
  [Leotard] For the security of western Europe, Russia is an 
essential and probably the most important partner. To settle a 
crisis like the one in Yugoslavia, Russia's participation in a 
political solution is absolutely vital.

  [Text] [Announcer] In Paris, Edouard Balladur held a 
meeting with the ministers of defense and foreign affairs to 
take stock of the situation in Bosnia, just a few hours before 
the expiration of the ultimatum. Patrick Mizrahi, you are 
outside the Hotel Matignon where the prime minister has just 
made a statement. 
  [Mizrahi] In a 45-minute meeting in Matignon, a few hours 
before the expiration of the NATO ultimatum, Edouard Balladur 
had around him Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard, and government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy. 
Also there were Elysee Secretary General Hubert Vedrine, 
General Quesnot, the private presidential chief of staff, and 
Admiral Lanxade, Armed Foreces chief of staff. Just one 
watchword: firmness. 
  [Begin Balladur recording] The ultimatum must be respected, 
and it must be respected today, tomorrow, and the day after 
tomorrow. Our aim is not war but peace. But everyone must take 
all the necessary measures for this to happen. 
  Originally it was a humanitarian mission and still is one, 
but it is true that if things were to evolve, all measures must 
be taken to ensure, as far as possible, the protection of our 
soldiers. [end recording] 
  [Mizrahi] Edouard Balladur added that France was the 
defender 
of international law and morality. At 2130 it will be the turn 
of Francois Mitterrand to meet the prime minister, the minister 
of defense, and the minister of foreign affairs in the Elysee. 
  Patrick Mizrahi, Matignon, for France Inter. 
  [Announcer] At about 2130, the head of state is to meet 
Edouard Balladur, Francois Leotard, Alain Juppe, and Admiral 
Lanxade, the Armed Forces chief of staff, so that the final 
decision can be made. This was announced just now in a 
communique from the president's office.

  [Text] Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has just given a 
news conference after meeting leaders of the main political 
parties in France to brief them on the situation in Bosnia. 
Edouard Balladur: 
  [Begin Balladur recording] Since yesterday, we have been 
able 
to see that our firm stand, which we had called for, and which 
was initiated by our country and our diplomacy, has been a 
success. At the moment we speak, we can say that it was a 
success. This does not necessarily mean that everything has 
been solved, and many problems remain to be solved. 
Nevertheless, our assessment of the situation at this stage 
shows that the alliance's decision, acting within an 
international mandate, has, for the most part, been respected. 
Is this a definitive situation, is it a lasting situation? The 
future will tell, but it is our duty to [words indistinct]. 
  Our attention now turns to the follow-up to this action from 
the point of view of a lasting solution to the problems of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. This first of all means a solution of the 
situation in Sarajevo, with the restoration of free movement, 
the lifting of the siege, and the international administration 
of the city, which seems to many to be the only way of providing 
a lasting solution to the problem. Second, it means the 
solution of the problems facing a number of other towns or 
regions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which have been designated as 
safe areas, and which sometimes have not been safe areas, and 
where the situation remains unchanged. Finally, it means a 
solution of the overall problem of Bosnia, in other words 
progress towards a lasting peace. 
  You know that the European Union has drawn up a plan. This 
plan is on the table. It is not a rigid plan, it can still be 
debated, and we are quite prepared to discuss it with our 
partners within whatever framework or organization. What is 
essential is that, thanks to this action, we can gradually move 
towards a solution of the situation in Bosnia. [end recording].

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe met his British 
counterpart Douglas Hurd, this afternoon. Paris and London 
agree to extend the UN soldiers' action on the ground to those 
towns still under siege in the former Yugoslavia. Alain Juppe: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] A first step has been made, as we 
have all said. Having said that, a lot remains to be done: 
First, in order to guarantee the effective lifting of the siege 
of Sarajevo and to rebuild this town ruined by war; second, in 
order to extend our action to all safe areas or all besieged 
towns in Bosnia, and third, in order to promote a global peace 
plan without which a stable solution cannot be found. There has 
been convergence on all these issues. 
  I would like to point out that a number of decisions have 
already been taken. I am thinking in particular of Tuzla and 
Srebrenica, two safe areas covered by Resolution 836, and on 
which the Council of the Atlantic Alliance took a very clear 
stance on 10 and 11 January. As you know, the aim is to reopen 
Tuzla airport for humanitarian purposes, and to restore freedom 
of movement in Srebrenica again, in particular for UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces]. We [Juppe and Hurd] both hope that these 
decisions will be implemented in the very near future. [end

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Francois Mitterrand from </F>
the Elysee in Paris on 21 February--live or recorded] 
  [Text] My dear compatriots: The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
entered a new phase in Sarajevo last night. The Serbs, who have 
been besieging the town, inflicting thousands of deaths and 
terrible suffering for the people, have withdrawn most of their 
heavy weapons, guns, mortars, and tanks, within a radius of 20 
km. The weapons that have not been withdrawn are now grouped 
under the control of UN Forces. The first condition was met 
within the allotted time. The North Atlantic Council set the 
deadline on 9 February at the request of France and the United 
States, and it was meant for both the Serbs and the Bosnian 
Government. 
  Last night, I invited the prime minister, the ministers of 
defense and foreign affairs, as well as the chief of staff, to 
the Elysee in order to take stock of the situation. From the 
Elysee I called General Cot, who is commanding the UN Protection 
Forces on the ground in the former Yugoslavia. He told us that 
the withdrawal of Serb weapons was accelerating. 
  I then called Washington, where President Clinton, who had 
just talked with Mr. Yeltsin, confirmed the information given by 
General Cot. We agreed that if events unfold as they are 
expected to until the deadline [as heard], it will not be 
necessary to use our military means. Since the information we 
received from our own services confirmed this, air strikes did 
not take place. 
  The withdrawal of heavy weapons was obtained thanks to the 
determination of the allies and the moderating intervention of 
the Russians with the Serbs. Need I emphasize the role played 
by France, which from the beginning originated all of the 
initiatives aimed at settling the conflict, and which has given 
the United Nations the largest contingent of peace soldiers? We 
need only look at the most recent events. May I remind you that 
it was in the wake of the talks that took place 15 days ago 
between Mr. Juppe and American Secretary of State Christopher, 
that it was possible to find an outcome. 
  However, much remains to be done. It is necessary to 
consolidate the lifting of the siege in Sarajevo. The 
cease-fire has been heeded so far, but freedom of movement for 
people and humanitarian convoys has not yet been restored. 
People are still living in fear. 
  It is clear that any violation of the decisions of the 
Atlantic Alliance will be....[pauses] would be punished 
tomorrow as we had intended to do today. I hope that the most 
will be made of the time we have saved and of this first success 
of reason over so many murderous passions, in order to extend 
allied pressure to the other Bosnian towns, to the other zones 
of this country where violence is rife. We will thus give a new 
impetus to the search for a political settlement, for there can 
only be a negotiated solution. 
  Consultations will take place within the next few days. As 
early as this week France will appeal to the Security Council 
and ask its members to put Sarajevo under UN administration. 
  We shall not slacken our efforts. The minister of defense 
and and the minister of foreign affairs are following the 
development of events--under the authority of the prime 
minister--just as I am, hour by hour. 
  I presided over a restricted meeting this afternoon, as I 
did 
yesterday. The same will happen over the next few days, and, if 
some among you listening to me are wondering, I will tell you: 
What is happening in the Balkans affects us, it affects France. 
Beyond the human solidarity demanded by the scope of this 
tragedy, yes, this affects us, as other things did in the past. 
Similar conflicts can flare up at any time. Born from the 
dislocation of the Soviet Union and from the solution which will 
prevail in Bosnia, many things will happen. 
  I am about to conclude, my dear compatriots. Let us think of 
the 18 French soldiers killed, of the 281 injured in that part 
of the world, and let us appreciate together the value of their 
sacrifice for the sake of peace. Long live the republic, long 
live France.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F>
unidentified correspondent -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Francois Leotard, thank you for 
joining us in the studio. [passage omitted] My first question: 
is the withdrawal of Serb heavy artillery real or not? 
  [Leotard] Yes, yes. Of course, there can be, here or there, 
a weapon that might have been left behind, but these are only 
exceptions, and these exceptions are in fact often condemned by 
the Serbs themselves. In other words, to sum things up: about 
50 percent of the weapons around Sarajevo -- and there were 
indeed more of them than we thought -- have been pulled back 
beyond the 20-km perimeter or taken to Pale, which is the 
enclave where the Bosnian Serbs have their parliament. There is 
a large concentration of weapons there. I have photos that show 
this quite clearly, but they are allowed to keep them there, 
since we had allowed a two-km zone around Pale, which was not 
threatened by air strikes. The other 50 percent have been 
gathered together in barracks, in emplacements controlled by 
armed members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. 
  [Correspondent] So you are not worried by pictures showing a 
few undeclared Serb weapons? 
  [Leotard] No, there might still be a few tomorrow morning. 
You know, until recently, we did not have any helicopters in 
Sarajevo. France sent two helicopters at first, then four, and 
they are now going from hill to hill to control this perimeter, 
which covers some 12-13,000 square km. 
  [Correspondent] Is this withdrawal just tactical or is it 
sincere? Have the Serbs promised not to come back anywhere near 
Sarajevo? 
  [Leotard] No, no, we simply said: If you do that, if you 
keep 
these weapons, we will bomb them, so they are either leaving or 
being regrouped. Of course, if they were to come back -- this 
must be quite clear to everyone -- if they were to come back, we 
would bomb. That must be quite clear. Yesterday, we met in 
northern Italy with defense ministers from America, Holland, 
Great Britain, and we said we would maintain our air deployment, 
and that we would keep to the conditions of the ultimatum. If a 
weapon comes back, it will be bombed -- this must be quite clear 
-- and if a shell were to land on the civilian population, we 
would punish those who had fired it. All this must be quite 
clear. 
  [Correspondent] So it is out of the question that they 
should 
shell Sarajevo again? 
  [Leotard] Out of the question. You may have heard that 
General Cot repeated this today at my request, and I can repeat 
it to you now: we came to an agreement with the allies and with 
the other defense ministers in Italy yesterday, and the 
deployment will be maintained. We have not set an end date for 
that deployment. 
  [Correspondent] So any strike could happen without an 
ultimatum, without warning? 
  [Leotard] Absolutely. We have no need, either for a new 
meeting of the North Atlantic Council, or for a new meeting of 
the Security Council. Everyone must know that, and we will keep 
our deployment for as long as necessary. 
  [Correspondent] Both the president and the prime minister 
have said that if they withdrew, it was because our firm stand 
had paid off. 
  [Leotard] It is true. It is absolutely true. There is no 
doubt that, because of the cohesion of the allies, because of 
the cohesion of the French executive also, we showed that there 
were no chinks in our determination. 
  [Correspondent] Why don't we show the same determination for 
Tuzla, for Zepa? The fighting carries on outside Sarajevo. Why 
don't we do the same thing there? 
  [Leotard] First, there is a material problem, a problem of 
means. You know that France already has some 9,000 men on the 
ground, by far the largest contingent. There is also a 
scheduling problem. We are currently planning the Tuzla 
operation.... 
  [Correspondent interrupting] In other words? 
  [Leotard] In other words, we would like Tuzla airport, which 
lies to the north of the Muslim-held pocket....[pauses] This 
airport is very interesting for humanitarian aid. We want to 
take control of this airport and ensure that if ever planes 
bringing in humanitarian aid were attacked by the besieging 
Serbs....[pauses] Well, there also we would like to strike. 
  [Correspondent] So you want to press home your advantage? 
  [Leotard] We want to press home our advantage. You might 
remember that Tuzla and Srebrenica are two of the areas 
considered at the NATO summit on 12 January. So we are still 
pursuing this aim. Another aim could be to bring the greater 
Sarajevo area under UN supervision -- this possibility was 
already being considered last August -- and this would mean 
taking on the civilian administration -- gas, water, 
electricity, security. 
  [Correspondent] Let us imagine that after this NATO 
ultimatum, calm were suddenly to return to the whole of Bosnia. 
  [Leotard] I am less confident about this than you are. I 
fear alas that in certain areas -- Mostar, Bihac, Srebrenica, to 
quote but a few -- the warring parties are in a situation where 
shelling continues, sieges are under way as we speak. We have 
to do something about this. I once said that there was a 
terrible game in this land, a game of hatred, of violence. It 
started off as a Serbian aggression, but now it is happening on 
all sides, so this is a terribly difficult task for UNPROFOR. 
We have to go about it sector by sector, town by town, with a 
lot of tenacity. 
  [Correspondent] So let us be quite clear: NATO has won a 
lull, but the war goes on. 
  [Leotard] It is a stage. As the president of the republic 
said, it is a turning point in this crisis in this horrible war, 
a turning point in the right direction, without doubt. The very 
fact of seeing women and children walking outside, like human 
beings in Sarajevo, this is a wonderful reward for UNPROFOR. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Francois Mitterrand said that Russia had had 
a moderating influence in the crisis. Is this the right term? 
Wasn't the West afraid of seeing a return to the cold war, with 
Russia playing this rather strange game? 
  [Leotard] We must always be very careful, but I don't think 
so. I am glad that the Russians are involved. Russia is in the 
process of democratization, and I am glad that it contributes to 
security issues in Europe. We wanted this. Alain Juppe said 
so, and so did I. I went to see Russian Defense Minister 
Grachev some two weeks ago, and Mr. Kozyrev, and told them this. 
We wanted Russia to have this attitude. It is a positive 
contribution, for now. Let us enjoy the sight of a European 
city returning to life. [passage omitted]. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, Francois Leotard.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 22 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister 
Francois Leotard on Tuesday [22 February] told senators France 
would send 10 to 20 Sagaie tanks to Sarajevo in the next few 
days to boost existing materiel for United Nations troops. 
  The chairman of the Senate Defence and Foreign Affairs 
Committee, Xavier de Villepin, told AFP Leotard had noted that 
UN troops were lightly armed and confirmed that Sagaie tanks 
would be sent in the near future. 
  The tanks, which are equipped with 90-mm guns, will be 
shipped to former Yugoslavia from the southern port of Toulon, 
he said. 
  He emphasised that the tanks were to reinforce materiel for 
troops already on the ground and would not be operated by the 
troop reinforcements France has pledged. 
  French UN troops in Bosnia are already equipped with this 
type of tank, which is the heaviest weapon in their armoury.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by </F>
Franz-Olivier Giesbert on 21 February--live] 
  [Text] [Giesbert] The defense minister is the man everyone 
wants to hear this morning. Thank you for coming to answer our 
questions. First, can we regard what happened yesterday as a 
victory, a great victory, for NATO and for France? 
  [Leotard] I won't use the word victory for the moment. It is 
a stage. It is a positive stage on a path where other stages 
have been very negative. There is still a war situation on the 
ground, in many other places. The town of Sarajevo is still 
under siege. The people lack food, they cannot leave. 
Elsewhere towns are being shelled, women and children are still 
in a very dangerous situation. I think we have to realize that 
we issued threats, we threatened to use force, and I am glad to 
see that this threat worked, that it made it possible to achieve 
a result, and that it hasn't yet been used. 
  [Giesbert] For you, it is a small first step? 
  [Leotard] It is a step, it is a stage, and a positive one, 
of 
course, because what we wanted is happening. But it isn't over. 
  [Giesbert] It is not all done. For example, we have heard 
every figure as far as estimates are concerned: for the United 
Nations, 100 percent of the Serb heavy weapons were neutralized 
or moved yesterday; for Karadzic, the head of the Bosnian Serbs 
it was 50 percent; for Francois Mitterrand it was 80 percent. 
Has the ultimatum been respected 100 percent, 90, 80 or 50 
percent? 
  [Leotard] You know, day is breaking. Yesterday afternoon we 
sent two helicopters to Sarajevo, since the planes had problems 
because of the weather. So now again today these helicopters 
are going to fly over the hills around Sarajevo. A number of 
guns, if they are still there, are there for technical reasons. 
The Serbs themselves showed us that they couldn't move them any 
more either because there was no more petrol, or the engine of a 
tank had disappeared, or they were concreted in. 
  [Giesbert] And do you believe this? 
  [Leotard] We checked. We checked. And we will continue to 
do so today. You must remember that the ultimatum is still 
there as far as the means of carrying it out are concerned. 
That is to say that if ever there is to be shelling, for 
example, of course the hardware that has been assembled, the 
aircraft, would be used. That is clear. 
  [Giesbert] So you are saying now, this morning, that there 
could still be air strikes? 
  [Leotard] Of course. Of course. We really mustn't -- I was 
going to say, disarm ourselves. 
  [Giesbert] So you haven't given in to Serb strategems, as 
the 
Bosnian Muslims are accusing you of having done? 
  [Leotard] No, not at all. Let me remind you that were there 
to be shooting from the Muslim side, they would undergo the same 
treatment. Let me repeat, we are not there to make war on one 
of the sides, we are there to enforce respect for a UN 
resolution, and what is to be regretted is that we were not able 
to do it earlier, for all sorts of reasons. Now we have to be 
firm about implementing what the ultimatum actually says, that's 
to say the use of aerial force should there be shelling of the 
civilian population. 
  And I will add a second very important factor: the town of 
Sarajevo is still under siege at this moment, and it is 
essential to get the siege of Sarajevo lifted. This is our aim 
now. 
  [Giesbert] That was the aim of the ultimatum, if I 
understand 
it rightly? It seems that you have given a short period of 
grace, a short extension, to the Serbs? 
  [Leotard] There wasn't even half an hour's extension. Not 
even half an hour. 
  [Giesbert] Ah, because you are not yet quite sure that the 
ultimatum is being respected? 
  [Leotard] No, not at all. I have just said that according to 
our information, all, or almost all, the weapons have been 
withdrawn. We will check during the morning hours whether it is 
all of them, and whether there is no dishonesty: it is a 
question of hours, but of course we are keeping the possibility. 
All the officials (?of the EU) and my counterpart ministers of 
defense repeated the same thing as I did yesterday in Italy, and 
so we are keeping the possibility of doing so. Everyone must 
know that our resolve remains intact. 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, isn't the danger now that the Serb 
arms might be deployed elsewhere in Bosnia? The weapons that 
have left the surroundings of Sarajevo will be used elsewhere? 
  [Leotard] That's what I said at the beginning, that we are 
still in a conflict situation. So when a weapon has not been 
confiscated and taken under UN control, it is moved to be used, 
unfortunately. We are in a country where towns are still under 
siege, and shelling is taking place. So what you are saying is 
quite clear: there are risks elsewhere now, and what I would 
like is for the dynamics of the victory on the diplomatic level 
-- victory is the word you used -- the dynamics of this sea 
change on the diplomatic level, to get the situation to improve 
elsewhere. 
  [Giesbert] So basically you are telling us: we will continue 
to put pressure on the Serbs? 
  [Leotard] Absolutely. And I am convinced that we have to put 
it not only on the Serbs, but on the Bosnians too. 
  [Giesbert] Is that what Edouard Balladur's statement meant 
yesterday, when he told us that the ultimatum would stay in 
force for a few more days? 
  [Leotard] We and the other allies took the decision to 
retain the air contingent, which is large, and the first 
infringement will be very seriously punished, and at the same 
time decided to continue pressure diplomatically and 
politically, so that, for example, one of the aims we are 
pursuing, namely to put the sector of the Sarajevo district 
under UN control, can be put into effect. This presupposes huge 
diplomatic efforts. For the moment the local people, the Serbs 
and the Bosnians, say they are willing, but the conditions are 
not right. That probably means that at the UN Security Council 
there will be initiatives, it means that there will be extra 
troops on the ground, for example, it means a number of 
conditions which at the present moment have not been met. 
  [Giesbert] From what you are saying, Mr. Leotard, we cannot 
help feeling that in fact everything is just beginning now? 
  [Leotard] I think a lot of people have made the mistake of 
thinking that... 
  [Giesbert, interrupting] It is not over, it is beginning? 
  [Leotard] Yes, exactly, that the end of the time limit was 
the end of the war. The end of the time limit is the beginning 
of another period. 
  [Giesbert] Yesterday evening we avoided the 
internationalization of the fighting, but it can still get 
internationalized? 
  [Leotard] We are by no means out of the woods as far as this 
danger is concerned. You know that we are there to a large 
extent to avoid this. It is a conflict that has very serious 
potential dangers for Europe, so if there are 9,000 French 
soldiers there in the area of operations as a whole, in the 
Adriatic and in Yugoslavia, we are there mainly to prevent this 
conflict from flaring up. 
  Let me take the chance to tell you that I hope everyone 
realizes that the 270 French injured, the 18 dead we have 
suffered, all this has not been pointless. France's physical 
effort, the effort of its troops, of its lads, has not been 
pointless, because I am thinking of them today. I think that 
what they did made it possible for peace to move forward. 
  [Giesbert] You told me just now that we must not focus all 
attention on the tragedy of Sarajevo. It is true that there at 
the moment there are other tragedies -- there is the tragedy in 
Tuzla, for example. Yesterday the Serbs fired three shells. 
There is Mostar, where the Serbs and Muslims are resisting the 
Croats, there is Bihac. 
  [Leotard] There is Srebrenica, there are numerous towns. 
  [Giesbert] Don't we need to make ultimatums now for Tuzla, 
Mostar, Bihac, and the others? 
  [Leotard] I think so. We have to use the enormous air force 
that we have now gathered round and over Yugoslavia so that the 
process of negotiation and political discussion can go on. We 
have always said, and I repeat it again, that there is no 
military victory in the real sense of the word is possible on 
the ground, so now the force we put on show, the force we 
demonstrated, can have its effect without being used. That is 
the principle of forces for democracies, in fact. 
  [Giesbert] The force you are talking about, is simply a 
turning point for European defense? 
  [Leotard] I think it is a real turning point, or in any case 
I hope so, and I am saying this without self-satisfaction for 
the French government, or for France in general. It is a 
turning point above all, because French concepts have gradually 
been accepted. We are the ones who have been behind all the 
diplomatic and military initiatives from the beginning. We were 
the ones who asked for the creation of protected zones. We were 
the ones who asked for corridors. We were the ones who provided 
troops. Today about half the planes are French planes. So it 
was France which took all these initiatives, and it hopes the 
other Europeans will grasp the dimensions of the Yugoslav 
tragedy. 
  [Giesbert] You speak of France, but there is another country 
that has returned in strength to the diplomatic scene, Russia. 
Are you glad? 
  [Leotard] In a way, yes. I'll tell you why. 
  [Giesbert] Why in a way? Because you feel a bit that it is 
playing a double game? 
  [Leotard] As long as Russia is in the process of becoming 
democratic, it is and can be a partner for security in Europe. 
Of course this condition: as long as Russia is becoming 
democratic is important. It is doing this. But I think that 
the Europeans must realize that Russia is a factor in the 
security if it becomes a democratic country. Why not? Because 
it is a power which has strategic interests in Europe and round 
Europe. So we can enter a partnership of dialogue for the 
architecture of security in Europe. 
  [Giesbert] We now have to think of political solutions, Mr. 
Leotard. It is time for diplomacy too. What do you want to see 
in Bosnia -- there are several solutions: there is partition, 
there is cantonization. 
  [Leotard] First of all -- and it wasn't me who thought of it 
-- it is up to the different sides, the three sides who are 
still making war, to sit down round the table. Several months 
ago they accepted a scenario of -- we say partition, but I hope 
it won't be partition, because these people have to live 
together. Trade exchange and a common currency. In other 
words, that they should manage to find the tools themselves, and 
define the tools of cooperation between them. If they didn't do 
that, we would have a continuation of the war, because these are 
scattered pieces of territory, as you saw on the map. So they 
have to continue to be able to make exchanges on this part of 
the European continent. That is one of the most important aims 
for us. 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, you and Edouard Balladur are going 
to 
receive the political leaders today. What are you going to tell 
them? 
  [Leotard] The prime minister took the wise decision, and a 
brave one, to consult all the French political forces. He asked 
Mr. Juppe and me to be with him. I think this is a good picture 
of what a government can do, first to act, first to face up to 
its responsibilities and commit itself to its actions, and at 
the same time to consult the political forcs of the country to 
get them to ponder this tragedy. 
  [Giesbert] Thank you, Mr. Leotard.

Ministry called in Greek ambassador Dimitris Macris on Thursday 
[17 February] and expressed "acute preoccupation" over Greek 
moves against The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], 
spokesman Richard Duque said Friday. 
  Duque said the Greek Government's decision to close its 
northern port of Salonika to FYROM trade and to recall its 
consul from the FYROM capital of Skopje could not encourage 
dialogue between Greece and the FYROM. [passage omitted]

  [Text] New talks on the future of Northern Ireland would go 
ahead, with or without Sinn Fein, Irish Premier Albert Reynolds 
said today. 
  Speaking after Saturday's [19 February] 90-minute meeting in 
London with Mr. Major, the Taoiseach [prime minister] warned the 
IRA and Sinn Fein they would not have a better opportunity to 
enter the political process. He denied setting a deadline of 
March 17 for a Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street peace 
declaration. Both he and Mr. Major had made it clear the door 
to peace would not be closed, said Mr. Reynolds. 
  "We are not closing the door to peace, we are not going to 
lock that door and throw away the key." But he added: "I do not 
think the overwhelming support of the Irish people can be 
ignored. This is a new opportunity, there is never going to be 
a better offer on the table and I cannot see what justification 
there would be for the continuation of violence or the taking of 
one more innocent life." 
  During their meeting at Downing Street on Saturday both 
leaders agreed to resume the three-strand Northern Ireland talks 
process. 
  Mr. Reynolds told Irish radio the talks would be based on 
the 
principles enshrined in the declaration. "The new starting 
point will be the peace declaration. That has not been clear up 
to now, we finally agreed it on Saturday. We also agreed that 
it is a three-stranded process and not an internal settlement as 
some people were suggesting." 
  Mr. Reynolds said it was helpful that Mr. Major had 
reaffirmed his commitment to the declaration. "It was important 
that the British prime minister said it because I think there 
were people who were suspecting that maybe the British 
Government in some way or another were not behind the 
declaration." 
  Mr. Reynolds quashed hopes that the Sinn Fein annual 
conference next weekend would deliver a response to the Downing 
St. declaration, saying: "I never expected that forum to be the 
forum at which the response would be put together." But he 
hoped sufficient people would recognise that the road to peace 
was "a better road to choose to pursue their political 
objectives rather than the road to violence which in the last 25 
years has been carried on by paramilitaries on both sides. 
There will be no military victories." 
  Mr. Reynolds said: "We want people to sit back, study 
exactly 
where they have come from, where they are at and which road has 
the best chance of advancing the cause of nationalism. We 
believe the peace process is the only road." 
  Earlier, Mr. Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's The World This 
Weekend that progress was likely within a month. 
  "Saturday's meeting cleared the air and we have now agreed 
on 
the basis for the new talks, which is that the peace declaration 
will form the basis for the resumption of talks. That will be 
the new starting point," he said. 
  And Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew told the 
same programme that no party, including the Rev. Ian Paisley's 
hardline Democratic Unionists, could be allowed to veto progress 
of the peace talks. 
  Meanwhile, Irish Deputy Premier Dick Spring called on the 
IRA 
and Sinn Fein to show "leadership and courage" and accept the 
Downing Street peace declaration. 
  But speaking on BBC1's Breakfast With Frost programme he 
conceded that the IRA and Sinn Fein might never respond to the 
peace initiative. 
  John Hume, the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party] leader, 
said he did not agree with the view that the Declaration was 
unacceptable to Sinn Fein. 
  He told the London Weekend Television Walden programme: "My 
reading is that they are still giving it detailed study, which 
is what I expected, given the nature of that organisation. 
  "Their immediate reaction is suspicion and that is what I 
expect. But they have not rejected the Declaration. They have 
asked for clarification." 
  Mr. Hume said that peace in Ireland was above party 
politics. "I am putting it above party politics myself in the 
dialogue that I have been engaged in, so I would feel that what 
the British Government should do now is to directly clarify to 
them whatever they want clarified."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Friedrich Bohl, minister in the </F>
FRG Chancellor's Office, by Hans-Joachim Wiese in Hamburg -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Wiese] Good morning. 
  [Bohl] Good morning. 
  [Wiese] How does the FRG Government assess the fact that the 
NATO ultimatum has expired without the threatened air strikes 
having been necessary? 
  [Bohl] Well, the situation is that NATO and the United 
Nations are making it clear after all that air strikes are not 
required now and this development is very positive. I think it 
is always good if war-like and military conflicts or strikes are 
not necessary. In this respect, it is certainly a good 
development. 
  [Wiese] International deliberations on a new peace 
initiative for Bosnia are to be held in Bonn tomorrow. 
Chancellor Kohl is said to have suggested these talks in a 
telephone conversation with Russian President Yeltsin. Is this 
correct? 
  [Bohl] Well, over the past few days the chancellor had many 
telephone conversations, particularly with the U.S. President 
and the Russian president. I think one can say the chancellor 
has done his decisive share in the fact that we will now have an 
apparently good round of high-standard talks in the diplomatic 
sector. I think that major credit for the present development 
goes to the chancellor. 
  [Wiese] What will be the contents of these talks, Mr. Bohl? 
Can you give any details? 
  [Bohl] No. I neither can nor want to do this. The FRG 
foreign minister already made relevant statements yesterday 
evening. Nothing more can be said at the moment. It would also 
be inappropriate to do this now. I ask you to understand this. 
However, as I have said, I hope that we now have a positive 
basic tendency and we will make progress now. 
  [Wiese] You referred to FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. 
He also called for a solution for the Bosnian areas that are 
still contested, for example, Bihac and Tuzla. Is another NATO 
ultimatum conceivable for these areas? 
  [Bohl] I really ask you to understand that I do not want to 
comment on this. I do not want to make any statement that goes 
beyond what the foreign minister has already said. 
  [Wiese] How does the Federal Government assess the role of 
Russia in connection with the NATO ultimatum? 
  [Bohl] Well, I think it has already been expressed in my 
response to your question regarding the decisive progress in 
this respect made by the chancellor, the U.S. President, and the 
Russian president and mention of the fact that Russia has 
certainly made a decisive contribution to the present 
development. Altogether I think it has to be very positively 
assessed that all those who are responsible are making great 
efforts to prevent the further escalation of this conflict and 
to achieve a tendency toward peace. I think it is important 
that the Balkans not become a powder keg, that all responsible 
persons are making efforts to prevent this -- apparently with 
success -- and to achieve a peaceful development in the Balkans, 
which will probably be unstable for many years. 
  [Wiese] However, Mr. Bohl, rather threatening voices were 
still heard from Moscow yesterday. For example, Churkin, 
Russian envoy to the Balkans, urgently warned NATO against going 
ahead with its threat. Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said he 
is not at all interested in the ultimatum. Are these arguments 
to achieve a strong position or what does that mean? 
  [Bohl] Well, I do not want to comment on that. For me, the 
result counts. I want to continue to evaluate it as has already 
been done. 
  [Wiese] My last question: What are the Federal Government's 
ideas of the next steps in and around Sarajevo? In other words, 
what do you think of the proposal to place Sarajevo under UN 
control? 
  [Bohl] We want to leave that for the further talks. 
  [Wiese] Thank you for this interview.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] The German press today comments on the expiration 
of the NATO ultimatum for the Bosnian Serbs. 
  SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG writes: On the day after the expiration 
of the NATO ultimatum, the United Nations and NATO must admit 
they are still at the beginning. The threat of the use of force 
was only the first step and not the finale. NATO and the United 
Nations must not decrease their efforts. Direct pressure on all 
parties to the war must continue to exist until the fight 
against the siege of Sarajevo is finally over. If NATO and the 
United Nations achieve in the long run [a situation in which] 
shots are no longer fired in Sarajevo, this would bring great 
relief. However, the town can only survive if peace is restored 
in other areas, too. Public attention has mainly focused on the 
Bosnian capital in this war. However, it was overlooked that 
the fiercest fighting took place in other regions, and that 
Sarajevo was not so important for the Serbs. 
  NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG points out: Despite the modest 
hope that is budding in view of developments in Sarajevo, the 
rest of Bosnia must not be forgotten. Fighting is still going 
on in many places. The community of states must show the same 
determination with which it supported a cease-fire in the 
capital in other focal points, too -- in Tuzla, for example, 
where the Serbs launched new attacks during the weekend, or in 
Gorazde, Srebrenica, or Mostar. Otherwise the chances for peace 
that were created in Sarajevo will again be wasted. 
  LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG stresses another aspect. The NATO 
ultimatum for Sarajevo does not only mean a decision for the 
Serbs over war or peace with NATO, but it is part of the 
historic changes that are currently taking place. Bosnia is not 
a NATO member, and no NATO state has been attacked. Still, NATO 
prepared itself for military strikes -- for the first time under 
such preconditions since its founding in 1949. Thus, NATO has 
abandoned the principles valid during the East-West 
confrontation and has broken new ground the outline of which is 
not yet clearly discernible. The assessment of this step will 
probably only be possible after the next few decades, when new 
global structures are developed. 
  DIE WELT states: Russia's return to the policy vis-a-vis the 
Balkans is of particular significance. With the deployment of 
Russian soldiers in the Bosnian theater of war, Moscow has 
adopted a leading position allowing it to codetermine or block 
any political solution. Blocking NATO was one of Moscow's goals 
from the very beginning. Because of increased consideration for 
Russia's interests, the consequences will become visible in 
Athens, Ankara, and everywhere else in southeastern Europe. 
Russia is behaving like a major European power, and it will 
again find political customers via Belgrade, particularly 
because the internal cohesion of NATO has been critically 
weakened at its southern flank. Not only the situation around 
Sarajevo has changed but the European situation, too.

<F P=106> [Report by Heinz Heck: "Waigel Fears Addendum to the </F>
Budget"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- In 1994, the federal budget will be 
faced with additional burdens from business with Iran of up to 4 
billion German marks [DM]. This is the amount of short-term 
loans (duration of up to 12 months) that the Federal Government 
had covered via the Hermes credit insurance and which are now 
having problems or will endure problems by the end of this year. 
Since no precautions have been taken in the federal budget's 
guarantee account for damage caused by Iranian loans, the 
Federal Government wants to avoid a rescheduling of the debts, 
which would force it to pay approximately 90 percent 
immediately. Ten percent would have to be covered by the 
exporters themselves. 
  Otherwise, an addendum to the budget of DM3-4 billion would 
certainly become necessary, Bonn fears -- and right in the hot 
stage of the election campaign in autumn. The responsible 
ministries (Finance Ministry and Economics Ministry) and Hermes 
are, therefore, currently negotiating with the Iranian Central 
Bank Markazi about an almost unique refinancing: 
  A consortium of German banks is to grant a loan for the 
entire amount, including the exporters' retention, until 1995 
and is to receive a guarantee for that by the Federal 
Government. Already approved compensations of approximately 
DM420 million are to be included in the transaction so as to 
spare the budget. 
  Since the debts involve around 1,000 indivdiaul demands by 
up 
to 700 exporters, refinancing could not be coordinated 
differently at short notice anyway. Hermes has written to the 
exporters that conduct business with Iran and has requested 
details on their guaranteed demands. The costs of the unusual 
transaction are to be paid by Iran. This was negotiated until 
yesterday; the result is still open. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["hen"-signed report: "Iranian Risks Do Not Require </F>
Addendum to the Budget"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- The FRG Finance Ministry on Friday [18 
February] confirmed upon inquiry that Iran is in danger of being 
in default with approximately 4 billion German marks [DM] of 
short-term liabilities, which have developed within the 
framework of Hermes-covered trade. In this connection, however, 
the ministry denied a report by DIE WELT, claiming that this 
loss in payments would have already its full effect on the 
federal budget in 1994 and would require an addendum to the 
budget. 
  Rather, it is true that Iran currently has problems with 
repaying short-term Hermes-covered trade loans on time. 
Meanwhile, DM420 million of that have been recognized as losses 
and compensation has been paid to the German creditors. The 
total amount of DM4 billion will be "refinanced" from short to 
medium-term loans by a German banking consortium -- as this has 
been done in the past -- so that one cannot speak of a specific 
risk to the budget for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, it 
is a fact that Iran has serviced its medium and long-term loans 
punctually so far and is, therefore, not to be considered a bad 
debtor, it was noted. In the view of experts, Iran's short-term 
payment problems are primarily due to oscillating oil prices, as 
well as the country's temporary great need for imports. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Michael Anders: "German Metalworkers Get Set To </F>
Go on All-Out Strike"] 
  [Text] Bonn, Feb 18 (AFP) -- Workers in Germany's key 
metalworking and electrical industries are getting ready to face 
their employers and the government with an all-out strike to 
defend their pay-packets. 
  By Friday afternoon [18 February], all 14 regions of the 
powerful IG Metall trade union had declared the failure of 
negotiations, clearing the way for a strike ballot which union 
leaders are expected to decide when they meet in Frankfurt 
Monday. 
  Under this procedure, and failing any unexpected last-minute 
breakthrough, an all-out strike in a chosen region could begin 
the first week of March, union sources said. A vote of 75 
percent in favour is needed. 
  Union officials in the heavily-populated industrial 
heartland 
of North Rhine-Westphalia, who said they were unanimous, asked 
that their region be called on to settle the issue "in 
particular because of the extremist attitude" of the local 
employers. 
  The employers' federation Gesamtmetall has rejected the 
union's demands for a pay increase, insisting that the difficult 
situation of its member firms means they have to cut labour 
costs to stay in business. It has sought to cut holiday bonuses 
and wants the possibility of extending the workweek. 
  IG Metall, which with 3.2 million members is Europe's 
largest 
trade union, has offered greater flexibility in working hours in 
exchange for job security guarantees, but has rejected any 
attempt to impose pay cuts. It has however proposed shorter 
hours with some loss of pay. 
  The dispute has already been festering for weeks, with 
government and business spokesmen from Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
downwards repeatedly urging compromise in a sector which employs 
3.6 million workers and constitutes a pillar of the German 
economy. 
  Since a required notice period ran out January 28, more than 
1.2 million workers have taken part in short, "warning" strikes 
in western Germany, according to the union, hitting such 
household names as Mercedes, Bosch and Siemens. 
  In a last bid to resolve the dispute, Gesmatmetall president 
Hans-Joachim Gottschol held talks at his initiative in Darmstadt 
last Friday with IG Metall's national leader Klaus Zwickel, but 
these failed to produce agreement. 
  No new contacts are scheduled, and the union says it plans 
to 
hold more strikes and demonstrations next week. 
  Zwickel said he considered it very unlikely that there would 
be fresh talks before the strike decision, although he has 
repeatedly said that the union wants to avoid a protracted 
struggle. 
  The employers have warned that up to 10 percent of firms 
would close with the loss of another 100,000 jobs in such a 
event, in a sector which has seen the loss of hundreds of 
thousands of jobs in the last two years. 
  Zwickel said that the union had gone as far as it could, and 
an IG Metall source told AFP Friday that Zwickel was under 
pressure from the grass-roots which were preventing him from 
compromising any further. 
  But the source said that an all-out strike was not yet 
inevitable. 
  The source also pointed to the danger such a strike would 
pose for the government, as the dispute coincides with an 
outstanding wage raise demand by 3.5 million public service 
workers, for whom Kohl has said he wants a pay freeze.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech delivered by Federal Chancellor Helmut </F>
Kohl on the Day of Medium-Sized Industrial Enterprises of the 
Federal Association of German Industry in Magdeburg on 19 
January: "Medium-Sized Enterprises -- Driving Force of the 
Social Market Economy"] 
  [Text] 
<H6>  I. </H6>
  Minister President, dear Mr. Necker, Mayor, Deputies, Ladies 
and Gentlemen: First, I would like to seize the opportunity to 
wish all a happy new year. The year 1994 is an important one, 
in which, in particular, the people here in the new laender are 
facing further important steps in our joint future. 
  When the Federal Association of German Industry held the 
first Day of Medium-Sized Industries after the reunification of 
our fatherland in Leipzig in April 1991, German unity had been 
completed only six months earlier. At that time, we were still 
rather at the beginning of the task of establishing independent 
medium-sized industrial enterprises in the new laender. 
  Those who look back at the developments of the past two 
years 
will realize that the will for independence has developed most 
dynamically in the new laender. More than 600,000 companies 
have been established, and thousands of successfully 
reprivatized enterprises speak for themselves. 
  I would like to express my gratitude and recognition to the 
entrepreneurs in eastern Germany. They have done a great job in 
reconstruction, in many cases under tight deadlines and, 
especially in the starting phase, also against certain obstacles. 
  I also would like to thank the enterprises in western 
Germany 
which, despite the slump in the economy, stuck to their 
investment plans in the new laender. It is a pleasure for me to 
say today that the business community's promise to double its 
purchasing volume in the new laender to 50 billion German marks 
[DM] from 1992 to 1995 so far has been kept. 
  A special word of thanks also goes to those who have 
provided 
assistance and support for creating jobs for apprentices in the 
new laender over the past year. The chambers, but also the land 
groups of the Federal Association of German Industry [BDI], 
provided sufficient training opportunities in 1993. 
  The medium-sized enterprises are one centerpiece of the 
social market economy. It is in the many medium-sized 
enterprises in Germany that most people not only find 
employment, but also where innovation takes place most rapidly 
and frequently, where state-of-the-art products are developed, 
and where new markets are explored. We know from 40 years of 
experience that the strength and international success of the 
German economy are based largely on the existence of a wide and 
active foundation of medium-sized enterprises in Germany. 
  The medium-sized enterprises are, at the same time, a symbol 
of individual entrepreneurial freedom and independence. This is 
one of the reasons that the old regime in the former GDR tried 
to destroy the medium-sized economy. It was only with 
unification that the personal and economic freedom necessary for 
wide development of business initiative was recreated. 
  I am glad that the second "Day of Industrial Medium-Sized 
Enterprises" after reunification is taking place today in the 
new laender. Representatives of medium-sized enterprises from 
the old and new laender have come together here in Magdeburg for 
an exchange of opinions, for discussing problems, and for 
establishing the course of our joint future. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, we must vigorously advance 
developments 
in the new laender in the future, too, and complete the internal 
unity of Germany. Had I said five years ago that businessmen 
from western and eastern Germany would hold a joint meeting here 
in Magdeburg today, most people would have questioned my state 
of mind. 
  Some have not realized yet that we are facing a major 
challenge, a challenge unprecedented in history. What is 
certain is that somewhat more than three years after 
unification, we have made considerable progress on the path 
toward internal unity. 
  After last year's dynamic increase, we are expecting the 
economy in the new laender to grow between 6 and 8 percent this 
year, too. In 1993, eastern Germany supported growth in all of 
Germany and will do so in 1994, too. Until recently, hardly 
anyone would have considered this to be possible. 
  According to a forecast presented by the Hamburg Economic 
Research Institute last week, for the first time since 
unification exports from eastern Germany will increase. The new 
direction of exports, including exports to the West, shows that 
the international competitive strength of the enterprises in 
eastern Germany is increasing. The new laender already export 
more goods to the countries of the European Union [EU] and EFTA 
[European Free Trade Association] than to the former East Bloc, 
which used to be their main client. 
  Meanwhile, public as well as private per capita investment 
in 
eastern Germany, is higher than in western Germany. This year, 
even per capita investment in the construction industry will be 
higher there than in western Germany. 
  This has become possible only through the Federal 
Government's determined actions. The settlement of inherited 
debts in housing construction, which was accomplished and is 
mainly funded by the Federal Government, has given an enormous 
impulse to investment. The number of construction licenses 
increased enormously, from practically zero to an estimated 
75,000 in 1993, doubling the 1992 figure. 
  Housing construction also increased significantly in western 
Germany. According to provisional calculations, last year some 
430,000 apartments were completed. This year we expect the 
construction of half a million new apartments; this is the 
highest figure in 16 years. 
  The Federal Government has increased rapidly and 
significantly its financial efforts in all spheres since the 
conclusion of unity. I would like to give a few, very 
descriptive examples. In the last three and one-half years of 
German unity, more telephone connections were made than in the 
40 years of the GDR. Rapid communication also facilitates 
investment! Within a few years a major development project was 
brought under way, and I do not have any doubts that the 
activities of the mail service will even be speeded up after the 
postal privatization, for which I am yearning. 
  In order to transform the economy in the new laender and 
create new, competitive jobs, existing enterprises must be 
modernized and new, competitive enterprises created. 
  The Trust Agency has done a great job of privatizing 
enterprises, and largely concluded its work by the end of last 
year. Most of the more than 13,500 privatized enterprises were 
sold to medium-sized firms. 
  In addition, the Trust Agency created a series of measures 
especially designed to improve the economic outlook for the 
newly established, medium-sized enterprises in the new laender. 
These measures range from real estate offers to granting time 
to pay the purchasing price and have served to promote the 
development of medium-sized industry in the new laender. 
  In the sphere of trade we are experiencing particularly 
rapid 
development. In this area, privatization was concluded two and 
one-half years ago. This has meant great progress not only for 
the business community but also for the consumers in eastern 
Germany: Today any consumer can buy virtually everything he 
wants in his immediate neighborhood. 
  The Federal Government is firmly determined to continue its 
policy of promoting large-scale investment at a high level. 
This is a really promising course for effectively supporting 
the emergence of new, competitive economic structures and jobs 
in eastern Germany. 
  One example that I would like to mention in this connection 
is the investment grant, which we created, or the billions in 
credits we granted for the founding of companies and 
investments. Regarding public orders, we have introduced 
preferential treatment to enterprises from eastern Germany. The 
Federal Government, meanwhile, is places a fair share of its 
orders in eastern Germany. 
  Of course, there are still many difficulties, which you 
experience daily in your personal vicinity: Necessary changes 
sometimes progress slowly and in some cases these are still 
obstacles with which to contend. We must not close our eyes to 
the fact that 40 years of division have left deeper traces than 
we assumed. This simply cannot be undone with a few 
declarations. Today I am more convinced than ever that the 
decisive challenge as far as German unity is concerned is the 
meeting between people, the coexistence between people in 
Germany. Thus, I am asking all of you, all of us, wherever we 
are, to do everything to make us talk with one another and not 
about each other, so that those who have much to go through will 
not forget that prosperity in the old FRG did not come overnight 
but was the result of 40 years of hard work. 
  I also understand the working people who are worried about 
the future of their jobs. This is why the Federal Government is 
backing the necessary process of structural adaptation through 
its active labor market policy. This is how millions of people 
could be prevented from becoming unemployed in the next few 
years. Behind these naked figures stand the fates of many 
individuals and their families, who could be helped in this way. 
Despite some criticism, I stand by this active labor market 
policy as the expression of a real social market economy. After 
all, German unity does not only mean introducing cold capitalism 
in eastern Germany. What we want is a social market economy as 
defined by Ludwig Erhard. It is true we are still losing old 
jobs. Nevertheless, more and more we are able to replace these 
with new, competitive jobs. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: For many people in the new laender the 
personal situation has improved. Since the introduction of 
monetary, economic, and social union in May 1990, incomes of 
private households in eastern Germany have almost doubled; last 
year, they almost reached 70 percent of the western level. This 
is an unprecedented process of catching up! 
  Regardless of all achievements we have made in the 
reconstruction of the new laender, we must not ignore the fact 
that in many areas there is still a lot of unsatisfied demand. 
  Of course, the large amounts of money we are investing 
currently in the new laender will lead to the emergence of 
blossoming regions in the new laender. There can be absolutely 
no doubt about that, even though it might take a few years 
longer than we originally thought. Yet, if this is the only 
point in which I was wrong, then I can be quite content. 
  Despite all our efforts, we must recognize that first and 
foremost the two sides of industry are shaping the opportunities 
and prospects for work and employment. It is up to you and your 
decisions to give real priority to employment and jobs. This 
does not only apply to the new laender but to all of Germany. 
  I expressly welcome the fact that both sides of industry 
have 
recently shown readiness to be flexible. The first wage 
agreement for 1994, which has now been achieved in the western 
German chemical industry, has had an impact on public service, 
by the way. This agreement gave priority to the objective of 
jobs, which is good. 
  One thing I would like to emphasize is the agreement on 
flexible working hours of 35 to 40 hours a week. Also of 
particular importance are the special agreements for people 
entering professional life or for the long-term unemployed. 
  For the first time, industry and labor have reached concrete 
agreements that take into consideration differing efficiency and 
thus are making it easier for enterprises to hire new people. 
  I think that the agreement in the chemical industry 
contributes to the creation of more jobs, and should serve as a 
model for others industries, too. In practical terms, this is 
solidarity shown by those who have a job for those who are 
finding it difficult to find one. 
  Flexible working hours can help extend machine running times 
and create more part-time jobs. Now it will finally be possible 
to increase the offer of part-time jobs. In other 
industrialized nations this has been common practice for a long 
time. In the Netherlands, for example, almost one out of every 
three people employed works part time. Labor exchanges for 
part-time jobs have even become an independent branch there. 
  Surveys have shown that in our country interest in part-time 
jobs is much greater than what is being offered. Industry and 
labor should take into consideration more strongly than in the 
past that part-time work offers a major potential for more 
employment in Germany. 
<H6>  II. </H6>
  Ladies and Gentlemen, I have mentioned this example since 
today priority has to be given to preserving jobs and to 
creating new jobs in the whole of Germany. Particularly in the 
old laender structural weaknesses in the economy and the society 
have accumulated in the course of the past few years. These 
problems have nothing to do with German unity. 
  Demographic developments the average number of years an 
individual works have profound consequences in the long run, for 
example, for the labor market and the social security systems. 
Dramatic changes in the age structure of the German population 
after the turn of the millennium already are beginning to show. 
Today Germany has one of the lowest birthrates in the world. 
In 2030, presumably every third person will be over 60 years 
old. Considering today's 1.8 million serious nursing cases, 
nursing-care insurance is increasingly urgent. Therefore, we 
will push it through -- we will also push through that the 
ancillary wage costs will not be increased. 
  In order to ensure Germany's competitiveness as a business 
location for the future, we jointly have to do everything to 
overcome these structural weaknesses. The securing of the 
business location is not only the Federal Government's business; 
both sides of industry, the enterprises, the social groups, and 
every individual citizen are called upon to live up to their 
responsibility for the future. 
  It is now time for us to do everything that is overdue. For 
that purpose, familiar paths have to be abandoned. However, if 
we really want to say yes to the future, we have to be able to 
do what is necessary today and not to postpone it any longer. 
This is particularly important because of changes in the world 
economy. Competition has become stronger. However, this does 
not mean we have deteriorated, only that others have improved. 
This applies not only to the Asiatic regions of growth, but 
also to all countries of Central, East, and southeastern Europe. 
After all, we want democracy and market economics to be 
introduced there and these countries to recover again. However, 
if they are successful, they will also become competitors. We 
have to be prepared for this. 
  Last year, the Federal Government made several, also 
unpopular decisions for the securing of our future. Property 
cuts were unavoidable, claims had to be pushed back. However, 
only in this way can we preserve the bases of our social 
security in the long run. 
  But for me one field has to be excluded: pensions. Pensions 
are not a charitable gift of the state. People have worked for 
them their whole life. Therefore, we were not only guided by 
economic considerations when we decided to take over pensions 
for older people in the new laender. We owe special solidarity 
to the generation of the people who are today 60 or 70 years 
old. These people primarily carried the burden of the war and 
were cheated out of better living conditions in the GDR. 
  As you know, the topic of savings also includes combating 
social services abuses. Here, the campaign initiated by the 
Federal Employment Office, the trade unions, and employers last 
spring has been impressively successful. The number of cases of 
abuse of services and illegal employment being investigated by 
the employment offices increased by almost 50 percent. In this 
way, by the end of November, a savings of almost DM1.2 billion 
was achieved. This shows that there was and still is a burning 
need for action. And this equally applies to tax evasion and 
subsidy fraud. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, regarding savings and the combating of 
abuse, social cuts are not at issue, as some claim. A change in 
the people's way of thinking, reshuffles, and reorientation are 
required. Because of the enormous expenses for the new laender, 
we now have the opportunity to advance the development speedily. 
However, this also took the public budget to the limit of its 
capacity. 
  Yesterday and the day before yesterday the Federal 
Government 
and the coalition resolved two things: On the one hand, we 
agreed on specific, additional savings of DM5 billion in the 
budget. I need not explain that this was not easy after about 
DM21 billion had already been saved in the 1994 Federal Budget. 
In this way, we wish to stress that the stability of state 
finances is unrenounceable for us. For me stability also means 
the inflation rate will go down further; I regard it an enormous 
success that last year we achieved for the first time a rate in 
the 3-percent range -- here I am also particularly grateful to 
the Bundesbank. 
  On the other hand, yesterday we agreed on an "action program 
for more growth and employment." I refrain from explaining the 
measures to you in detail; those of you who have not yet read it 
will certainly do so some time. 
  From my point of view, the intention of the Federal 
Government to continue its deregulation policy with the 
objective of shortening the planning and authorization process 
in Germany is particularly important. 
  This program is apt to accelerate the economic recovery 
which 
is becoming noticeable and, at the same time, permanently 
improve the conditions of Germany as a business location. It 
relieves the enterprises and facilitates the securing and 
creation of jobs. 
  With this action program, we also are implementing essential 
measures we announced last September at the time of our report 
on securing the future of Germany as a business location. 
  Notwithstanding the election year, these decisions are 
absolutely necessary for securing the future. I have always 
said we must not lose any time in securing jobs in Germany. For 
me, the postponement of such important measures for the future 
is not possible because, in this way, we would betray our future. 
  We already implemented a large part of the measures 
contained in last lyear's report on Germany as a business 
location. I would like to mention the following 
examples: 

  -  The law on facilitating investment and land for 
housing construction and the law on facilitating planning are 
making the planning and authorization processes, which were 
often too long and complicated before, far easier. I 
immediately add the following: Far more could be done here. 
However, for this we above all need the cooperation of the 
laender, because they determine public administration in the 
federal system. 
  -  After a long struggle, the amendment to the 
genetic technology law has been achieved. This has also cleared 
the way for the idea that research and innovation again have 
priority -- without exceeding the limit of what is morally 
permitted. 
  -  Because of the railroad reform, the way is cleared 
for the reorganization of the railroads into a modern 
transportation system under entrepreneurial leadership. In this 
way, we have atoned for the omissions of the past 25 years. 
  We are firmly determined to make purposeful progress in 
implementing during the current legislative period additional 
pending measures recommended in the Report on Safeguarding 
Germany as an Industrial Location in the Future. This includes 
conclusion of the postal reform, in order to strengthen our 
competitive position in the telecommunications markets, which 
are growing with enormous speed all over the world. 
  The public response to our Report on Safeguarding Germany as 
an Industrial Location in the Future is more than encouraging. 
It shows that we have tackled a central topic for labor and 
employment. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, essential preconditions for 
safeguarding the competitiveness of German industry are 
future-oriented private investments and successful enterprise 
strategies. In addition to reducing production costs, it is the 
task of the companies to help new products gain a breakthrough 
and develop new markets. 
  We Germans are international leaders in environmental 
technology and in the development of new materials. What is 
possible in these areas can also be achieved in other fields 
that are important for the future. 
  However, in this we must always keep in mind that not 
everything that is technically and scientifically feasible is 
also ethically and morally permitted. The same goes for the 
relationship between economy and ecology. 
  However, Ladies and Gentlemen, a country like ours also 
needs 
a climate that is friendly for technology. Creating this 
atmosphere is one of the important tasks in educating the young 
generation. In particular, we must once again impart to 
students the feeling that technological top achievements are 
something that we can be proud of -- just as athletic top 
achievements naturally fill us with pride. Therefore, here, too, 
we need to cultivate the elites. 
<H6>  III. </H6>
  Ladies and Gentlemen, responsibility for one's own actions, 
courage for entrepreneurial risks, and readiness for innovation 
-- all these are qualities which characterize the independent 
medium-sized industries in our country -- are also needed in 
other spheres of our society. 
  I am confident that together we will master the challenges 
we 
are facing. We must recognize the signs of the time; we must 
open up new leeway for action for our country. This is also a 
precondition for enabling us to make use of new opportunities we 
will face in the future. The new international changes offer 
excellent opportunities in particular to us Germans. 
  The recently achieved conclusion of GATT is of outstanding 
importance for us. It is the most comprehensive liberalization 
package of past decades. Without liberalization of 
international trade relations, a country like the FRG that is so 
strongly integrated into international economy, would be hit in 
its vital nerve center. 
  This month the second stage of economic and monetary union 
came into effect. As a result, Europe continues to grow 
together in terms of economic and financial policy. About 70 
percent of our products go the countries of the European 
Community and EFTA -- this is a strong argument in favor of the 
emerging Europe. Our economic future is most closely linked 
with the process of European integration. 
  The decision to name Frankfurt/Main the seat of the European 
Monetary Institute, and thus of the future European Central 
Bank, is convincing proof of trust in us Germans. At the same 
time, this decision is an important symbol of the fact that a 
future European currency must be as stable as the German mark. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, what is of concern to me at the moment 
is, however, something else. There is a widespread view that, 
after all the things that have happened, war has been banished 
from our region forever. This is what people also thought in 
the 1920's when Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann received 
the Nobel Prize as the architects of the new peace. Evening 
after evening I see the horrible pictures from the former 
Yugoslavia, where people, who have lived together for 
generations, are attacking each other. There are also worrying 
reports from the area of the former Soviet Union. There some 
people once again think that borders can be shifted by force. 
  If we want to overcome borders, we must bring people 
together. I give you an example from my homeland, the 
Palatinate. There, Palatines and Alsatians live together as 
Germans and French and Europeans. This is what Thomas Mann said 
a long time ago: We are German Europeans and European Germans. 
  We want Europe to be our protection and shield for the 
future. Therefore, we must understand this development as an 
opportunity; this also is particularly true for German 
unification. Here I categorically oppose the stupid pessimism 
that is currently spreading. We must overcome it and make use 
of our opportunities. We must act with courage and 
determination, with those principles and virtues that have made 
our country great, with humaneness, loyalty, industriousness, 
and reliability. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to cordially invite you 
to 
follow this path together with us, to understand it together 
with us, and to act accordingly.

  [Text] [Announcer] Here in Spain the government monitored 
developments in the crisis via the cabinet established at the 
Moncloa Palace. When it was known that NATO's decision was not 
to attack at present because the Serbs were meeting the 
conditions of the ultimatum, Foreign Minister Javier Solana 
expressed the government's wish for the terms of this ultimatum 
to be applied and extended to the other cities of Bosnia. Valle 
Alonso: 
  [Alonso] In statements to Radio Nacional early this morning 
Foreign Minister Javier Solana ruled out air strikes in 
Sarajevo. Solana made these statements at the Moncloa [Palace], 
where he, the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the 
defense minister, and the minister of the prime minister's 
office had been since 1900. Javier Solana, who was in constant 
telephone contact with his counterparts from the European Union 
and Spanish diplomats and Spanish military commanders in the 
former Yugoslavia, said that the NATO operation remains open and 
the Spanish contingent is well. 
  [Begin Solana recording] The whole operation remains open 
and 
remains ready to be put into effect if necessary. What I can 
tell you is, I stress again, that the situation on the ground is 
developing favorably, positively. The deadlines of the 
conditions of the ultimatum are being met. And I will emphasize 
once again that our forces and the Spaniards on the ground are 
well. [end recording] 
  [Alonso] Solana indicated that the Western European Union 
[as 
heard] is in favor of the initiative started in Sarajevo being 
extended to other besieged enclaves such as Mostar. According 
to the foreign minister, this stance is supported in full by the 
Spanish government. 
  [Begin Solana recording] It is the wish of the Spanish 
government, in collaboration with the European Union, to try to 
use this initiative which has been started to liberate Sarajevo 
to give a new impetus to the peace negotiations, which should 
spread to the whole territory of Yugoslavia. I can tell you 
that some initiatives are already underway. Yesterday and today 
we, many of the European ministers, were in touch with our 
Russian, Canadian and U.S. counterparts to try to put forward a 
new peace initiative as soon as possible. [end recording] 
  [Alonso] The foreign minister emphasized that yesterday the 
government kept in touch with the different parliamentary groups 
so that they could have the most detailed possible information 
on the latest developments.

<F P=106> [Report from Spain by political correspondent Shlomo Raz] </F>
  [Excerpt] We have heard the prime minister's initial 
reaction to the assassination attempt against President Mubarak. 
The question in this context is whether an attempt of this kind 
will unsettle the relations between Israel and the Arab world, 
and most notably those between Israel and Egypt. Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks reflect his emphatic endorsement of the 
Israeli-Egyptian relations: 
  [Begin Rabin recording] I believe in the strength of 
Mubarak's regime. I believe the majority of the people support 
him. Yet there are radical elements, a phenomenon 
characteristic in many Arab countries in which terrorism is not 
repudiated. We have learned that terrorism is an integral part 
of the essence of many Arab countries, and it is not exclusive 
to the Palestinian, Lebanese, or Israeli context. The peace 
process must be pursued despite the difficulties, of which we 
are aware. As for peace in Egypt, I believe in the fortitude of 
Mubarak's regime in that country. [end recording] 
  This was Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's first public 
reaction 
to the news of the assassination attempt against President 
Mubarak. The issue of terror, to which Mr. Rabin referred, 
constituted a considerable part of his conversation with Prime 
Minister Felipe Gonzalez. The two men discussed Islamic 
fundamentalism in Iran, among Palestinians, in Sudan, Lebanon, 
and in countries closer to Spain, such as Algeria. 
  It was disclosed in Prime Minister Rabin's meeting with 
Gonzalez that Spain will assist Israel's efforts to advance its 
ties with the Arab world. It should be stressed that Spain has 
very good relations with many Arab countries in North Africa, 
the Persian Gulf, and particularly monarchic regimes. Prime 
Minister Gonzalez prefers to work quietly and not to advertise 
the Spanish efforts, but he promised to advance Israel's 
interests in Arab countries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Colonel General V.M. Zhurbenko, deputy chief of the 
general staff of the Russian Army, has been visiting Finland 
this week. The colonel and his retinue have for several days 
been following operations of the Finnish defense forces; they 
have also visited the Mannerheim Museum. Matters concerning the 
Leningrad military district, however, have not been discussed 
during the visit. Jaakko Lensu reporting. 
  [Begin recording] [Lensu] Col. Gen. Zhurbenko says that the 
manpower of the Leningrad military district is no secret, but... 
  [Zhurbenko in Russian followed by interpreter in Finnish] 
The 
figures are changing every day. Not even the chief of staff of 
the Leningrad military district, who is present here, can say 
what the daily situation is. 
  [Lensu] According to Zhurbenko, information is exchanged 
constantly with the Finnish Defense Ministry. From 1986 the 
number of troops in the Leningrad military district has 
decreased one and a half times, according to Zhurbenko, and by 
the end of next year the troops will decrease further. 
Lieutenant General Sokolov, chief of staff of the Leningrad 
military district, notes for his part that Finland has not even 
asked about this. 
  [Sokolov in Russian interspersed by the voice of the 
interpreter in Finnish] The representatives of the leadership of 
the Finnish defense forces have not asked any questions about 
this during our visit, because they already know everything they 
want to know about this matter. 
  [Lensu] The host of Zhurbenko's visit, Lieutenant General 
Matti Kopra, says for his part: 
  [Kopra] The Finnish defense forces have received the same 
information that, according to the Vienna agreement, is given 
each year in the CSCE report; and the latest information has 
just arrived a little while ago. An entirely different matter 
is the disarmament and reduction questions connected with cuts 
in conventional forces, where Finland does not take part. And 
there, as far as we have understood, Russia has a problem in the 
sense that they are of the opinion that they are too much 
bothered by these flank questions. What their stance is on that 
and how they are going to find a solution to that is their 
business, which has nothing to do with us. 
  [Lensu] A couple of days ago Admiral Jan Klenberg, the 
commander of the defense forces, spoke about Finland's security 
and noted that the treaty limiting conventional forces, that is 
the CFE [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe] Treaty, has 
arrived at an interesting stage. According to Adm. Klenberg, it 
looks like the implementation of the regional flank rules 
concerning the areas near Finland were in danger. The 
leadership of the Russian Armed Forces have for a long time 
wanted to transfer extra troops to the southern flank, to the 
area of Caucasian unrest. The limits of the CFE Treaty stop the 
transfer of extra tanks, which are necessary according to the 
Armed Forces, to this southern flank. This has made the 
leadership of the Russian Army demand changes in these 
paragraphs of the CFE Treaty, which were signed by NATO and the 
Warsaw Pact countries at the time. Whether this plan is 
implemented is another matter. To get an answer to this problem 
might not be so important because, as heard, the guests were not 
asked anything about this. Apparently, with this unsolved 
problem, it is easier to justify the Finnish defense forces' 
need for money. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Aslak Bonde report: "Finnish EU Doubts About Norway"] </F>
  [Text] There is growing distrust between Norway and 
Finland over the agricultural issues in the EU [European Union] 
negotiations. 
  Who is letting down whom? This question is being asked 
increasingly often at present, a week and a half before the 
planned completion of the EU negotiations. Rumors are rife, and 
many are to do with the Finns' and the Norwegians' real motives 
and demands with regard to agriculture. 
  In Finnish negotiating circles the view is that Norway is 
not 
battling particularly hard to achieve success on the most 
important issue: What sort of permanent support arrangements 
will be agreed for northern agriculture? There is also a 
feeling that Norway has begun too early to talk about 
compromises when it comes to transitional arrangements. 
  The Norwegians have long been afraid that the Finns will 
forget their demand for reasonable transitional arrangements if 
they only succeed in achieving good permanent support 
arrangements. It is being said that as the result of a Finnish 
initiative the European Commission is now working to find 
alternatives to transitional arrangements for the food industry. 
These include investment support, debt rescheduling, and 
regional support. 
  AFTENPOSTEN has been unable to confirm the truth of any of 
these rumors, but they are nevertheless interesting because they 
show the fragility of Nordic cohesion. 
  There are also a number of obvious reasons for why the 
rumors 
have arisen. At last week's negotiating meeting the Norwegian 
trade minister opted for a strategy different from that of her 
colleagues from the three other applicant countries. She 
pointed to the fact that on the question of transitional 
arrangements for agriculture the EU has kept the door ajar for 
Norway. 
  However, since then only very few have seen the gap in the 
door that Grete Knudsen saw. Most people think that the EU 
stood completely firm on its original demand that EU prices 
should be introduced on the day that Norway becomes a member. 
  Outsiders took the Norwegian attitude to be that Norway 
accepts the introduction of EU prices from day one if it is 
possible to make exceptions for those farmers and that section 
of the food industry that simply cannot cope with such a rapid 
transition to the EU market. 
  According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, this is to read too 
much into things. It is true that Norway has agreed to 
investigate the need for transitional arrangements for every 
individual product in the agricultural sector, but this 
investigation will show that we need protection in the vast 
majority of cases. Thus Norway is standing firm on the central 
principle -- of achieving a type of transitional arrangement 
different from those the EU has proposed. 
  As far as permanent support arrangements are concerned, 
there 
is an obvious reason why Finland is suspicious of Norway's 
determination to stand firm: At present the EU is working with 
an arrangement that suits Norway much better than it suits 
Finland. A proposal for criteria that will determine new 
support arrangements has been drafted which, in crude terms, 
will mean that northern Norway, Trondelag, and the northernmost 
part of southern Norway can receive special support. The same 
criteria only provide a base for support for 3 percent of 
Finnish agriculture. 
  The Finns therefore have major problems with accepting these 
criteria as a point of departure for the negotiations. In 
Norway the attitude is that with a few minor adjustments to the 
EU's criteria it will also be possible to cover important areas 
of southern Norway. 
  Norwegian negotiators are therefore attaching importance to 
the fact that the EU is now actually prepared to create support 
arrangements that are specially designed for the farmers in the 
north. This was not the case from the beginning.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Geir Salvesen: "How Welcome Are We Really in </F>
the EU?"] 
  [Text] Norwegians have a tiresome tendency to exaggerate 
their own importance. When a Norwegian play is produced in 
London, or when an item about Norway is shown on U.S. 
television, many people believe -- with the help of the press -- 
that we have "conquered London" or that now the whole of the 
United States knows about Norway. 
  We can also see traces of these distortions in the debate on 
EU [European Union] membership. And here the yes camp and the 
no camp are as bad as each other. Among some yes voters there 
is a deep-rooted belief that Europe loves Norway and that there 
is hardly anything more that it wants than to have bright and 
shiny Norwegian values introduced into European cooperation. 
Among some no voters there is a widespread view that the 
Europeans love Norway because they will be able to rob us of 
fish, oil, and democratic values. 
  The truth is -- as it usually is -- considerably more 
complex. Officially Norway is being welcomed as an EU member. 
The enthusiasm, however, is not as great as many Norwegians 
believe. In addition, the reaction from some countries is more 
reminiscent of a cold, or, at best, indifferent shoulder. This 
is something that it is important to bear in mind in the final 
phase of the negotiations that we are now entering. 
  So, is it simply a case of empty words when Norwegian 
ministers on their frequent trips abroad to the EU capitals 
receive kind assurances that people take a positive view of 
Norway? No. In general there is a basically positive approach 
behind these assurances, which may of course also be sweetened 
by the necessary diplomatic phrases that are exchanged on such 
occasions. But if you go behind the facade and talk to people a 
little further down the ladder in the EU countries, it becomes 
easier to catch sight of a more complex view. 
  "Norway is welcome, but not at any price." This is a view 
that is expressed relatively often. This is another: 
  "Remember that it is Norway that is applying for membership 
of the EU, and not the other way round." 
  Treating the EU as a "bloc" -- as so often happens in the 
Norwegian debate -- is a hopeless and misleading point of 
departure when trying to understand the relationship between the 
EU and the applicant countries. All nation-states have their 
individual economic and geopolitical interests that are promoted 
with the greatest energy. 
  To the extent that it is possible to talk of deeper shared 
attitudes among the EU countries they are to do, for example, 
with the way they view the Norwegians. According to this 
"mythology," the Norwegians will be among the best when it comes 
to complying with decisions reached by the EU -- once they have 
been reached. However, before the decisions are reached people 
expect that Norway will cause trouble over points that are 
viewed as peripheral in Europe. The Norwegians will also want 
everything in writing, guarantees in minute detail. This will 
create a clash of cultures. 
  In the negotiations themselves the view is now being taken 
that all the Nordic applicant nations are as bad as each other. 
But in general the picture abroad is that the Nordic countries 
share "social democratic" values and ways of thinking -- a fair 
distribution of wealth, social equality, and an interest in 
environmental protection. 
  Let us look at the interests of the various countries in 
the EU in relation to the three Nordic applicants. 

  -  Germany is perhaps Norway's main ally among the larger 
countries. Unlike in 1972, Germany is prepared to go a long way 
in order to bring in Norway and the other Nordic countries. 
This is undoubtedly for geopolitical reasons -- so that the 
northern part of the EU will be strengthened. It also has 
something to do with economic, social, and cultural 
ties. 
  -  Britain is also basically positively disposed toward 
Norway and the Nordic area. For geopolitical, cultural, and 
historical reasons. Also, however, because it takes the view 
that Norway could help to slow down the federalist tendencies 
and keep the Union in check. 
  -  France is relatively indifferent, 
despite the fine words to Norwegian visitors. France is always 
conscious of its power and historic role, and a brace of 
quarrelsome Nordic countries could only help to water down the 
solid power France also enjoys within the EU. 
  -  Italy -- the 
weakened power to the south -- is basically positively disposed 
toward expansion to the north, in part because it believes that 
the diversity within the EU will be strengthened. But Austria is 
more interesting from Italy's viewpoint. It does not like the 
talk of a northern bloc that it fears would form an alliance 
against the interests of the south. However, it is worth noting 
that Italy has not gotten together with Spain to extract more 
contributions and regional support and in this way put a spoke 
in the wheels of enlargement. 
  -  Spain, Portugal, Greece. This 
axis of the countries on the southern flank sees a chance of 
getting more money out of the new applicant nations. For 
example, Norway will be a net contributor to the common purse. 
All these countries have fears about a shift in the center of 
political gravity of the EC toward the north. The EU 
presidency, held by Greece this spring, will have the effect of 
imposing some discipline on possible extreme solutions proposed 
by Greece in the final phase of the negotiations. The problem 
lies with the Spaniards who in this enlargement round will try 
to make up for what they did not get when they joined the EU a 
few years ago. 
  -  The Benelux countries do not have a central role 
to play and do not look as if they have any strong views apart 
from a general goodwill -- and a position that makes them the 
mediators between north and south. In other respects the 
Netherlands' view of society is closest to that of the Nordic 
countries.

  [Text] A Swedish court has issued a warrant for the arrest 
of Samir Muhammad al-Qadir, suspected of being the mastermind 
behind the 1988 atack against a Greek cruise ship in which nine 
people died. One Swedish woman was one of the victims. Al-Qadir 
settled here in Sweden in 1986; he used another name and is said 
to be the operations officer of the Abu Nidal terrorist group.

<F P=106> [Report by Fanos Konstandinidhis] </F>
  [Excerpts] President Glavkos Kliridhis will begin briefing 
the political leaders tomorrow on what has been discussed during 
the confidence-building measures [CBM's] proximity talks, where 
no progress has been made whatsoever. 
  The reason is because Rauf Denktas rejected President 
Kliridhis' proposal on setting up a schedule for the return of 
all the residents to the fenced-off part of Famagusta in 
conjunction with the reopening of the Nicosia Airport and for 
safe access from and to Famagusta. The Kliridhis proposal 
includes the withdrawal of the occupation troops to the east of 
the Dherinia Road so that there will not be any danger of 
enclaving the Varosha residents. [passage omitted] 
  A senior government source told I MAKHI yesterday that at 
the 
next session of the talks President Kliridhis will reiterate the 
same positions about Famagusta, Nicosia Airport, and safe access 
to the fenced-off area of Famagusta. The same source added that 
these issues are of substantial importance to the Greek Cypriot 
side. This is why there is not going to be any retreat, the 
source stressed. 
  The same source also noted that the Greek Government has 
been 
fully briefed on the results of the first phase of the talks. 
President Kliridhis, the source added, will convene a meeting of 
the National Council after the second phase of the talks is 
concluded at the end of February. 
  At any rate, the Cyprus Government and the political leaders 
in general do not expect any "spectacular" developments in the 
new phase of the talks either. What is expected to happen after 
Rauf Denktas' return from Ankara -- where he will go tomorrow 
and return on Wednesday -- is that he will make some new 
maneuvers and then again block the course of discussion by 
reiterating the same positions, particularly on Famagusta, which 
is the key to developments. 
  At the same time, backstage diplomats, particularly the 
British and Americans, have begun again to move actively in an 
attempt to overcome the deadlock. Their efforts will also be 
focused on Ankara on the occasion of the Turkish Cypriot leaders 
visit there. To break the deadlock, U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia 
Richard Boucher and British High Commissioner David Dain 
received instructions to begin intensive consultations with the 
two sides. It is also rumored that U.S. Special Cyprus 
Coordinator Robert Lamb will be coming to Nicosia during these 
days to assist in the consultations. 
  The purpose of the new diplomatic moves is to attempt, in 
the 
event that it is impossible to end the deadlock, to find a 
formula on the basis of which Mr. Kliridhis and Mr. Denktas will 
meet with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in New York for 
two-three days to hold a "general" discussion. On the basis of 
this formula, the British and Americans hope that the proximity 
talks, of which they are "sponsors," will continue. 
  At any rate, the experiment of the proximity talks and the 
CBM's seems to be failing. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mr. Serge Abou, the European Union [EU] observer 
for the Cyprus issue, arrived in Cyprus this afternoon to be 
briefed on the proximity talks. He will be received by 
President Glavkos Kliridhis tomorrow and he will hold 
consultations this evening with UN's Gustave Feissel. Mr. Abou 
said upon his arrival that he will also hold meetings with the 
ambassadors of the 12 EU member countries as stipulated by the 
regulation. He also noted that there is no time schedule 
according to which he has to submit his report to the EU, but 
when Cyprus' application for accession is discussed in 1995, he 
will have to give all the details. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis described the 
observer's arrival as practical proof he is following 
developments in the Cyprus issue. The EU observer had also 
requested to have a meeting with Rauf Denktas but the latter 
left for Turkey at noon today. Both Ankara and Denktas refuse to 
meet with the EU observers because they object to his 
appointment.

  [Text] Serge Abou, the European Union [EU] observer on the 
Cyprus issue, last night met Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary 
general's alternate special representative in Cyprus. In a 
statement, Feissel said the United Nations continues to believe 
that both sides are willing to approach the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's] in a reasonable manner. He said: Any specific 
progress will come a few days or a week after the proximity 
talks resume on Thursday [24 February]. 
  Feissel said resolving the dispute on Varosha depends on 
agreeing on the issues of safe movement and a timeframe for 
implementation. He added that the Turkish Cypriot side is asking 
for assurances that it will receive the benefits described in 
the CBM's.

  [Text] The United Nations continues to believe that both 
sides want to approach the confidence-building measures [CBM's] 
in a reasonable manner. In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus 
Broadcasting Corporation] tonight, Gustave Feissel also said 
that any concrete progress will become obvious in a few days or 
a week from the proximity talks, which will resume on Thursday 
[24 February]. He also noted that the disagreement on the 
Varosha issue lies in the question of safe access and the time 
schedule. Concerning the Turkish Cypriot side, Feissel further 
revealed that it demands assurances that it will obtain the 
benefits described in the CBM's. 
  On the results of the first two-day [round of proximity 
talks] Mr. Feissel said that it is premature to describe them as 
positive or negative. Concerning the notes he is preparing, Mr. 
Feissel said that their purpose will be to assist the two sides 
with ideas and views to reach an agreement. He further noted 
that on some questions there are bigger disagreements than on 
others, but expressed the hope that these disagreements will be 
overcome soon. 
  Responding to a question, Mr. Feissel said that the two 
sides 
have the will to approach the issues in a reasonable manner. If 
they do not seek to obtain political benefits from this effort, 
he added, then we will succeed.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis left this 
morning on a working visit to Germany. Mr. Mikhailidhis will 
hold talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel and other 
members of the government. The main topics of the talks will be 
the latest developments in the Cyprus issue and Cyprus' 
application for accession to the European Union. Mr. 
Mikhailidhis will also meet with former German foreign minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher. 
  In a statement at Larnaca Airport, Mr. Mikhailidhis referred 
to the first phase of the proximity talks, saying that we cannot 
say that any progress has been made. He added: Consequently, 
we did not move at all. 
  However, Mr. Mikhailidhis noted that it is premature to say 
that we have been reached a deadlock. He added: We should give 
every chance to the UN Secretary General's representatives to 
hold meetings with their contacts. The next meetings will be 
very critical, he said, and it will become obvious from the 
beginning whether there are any prospects or not. Mr. 
Mikhailidhis further noted: We want to cooperate in 
implementing the [confidence-building] measures but we do not 
want to enter a useless and endless dialogue, and that is what 
will happen if we leave critical issues pending. 
  Responding to a question on whether the United Nations will 
submit new ideas in the next phase of the talks, Mr. 
Mikhailidhis said: As is natural, after experiencing two 
meetings at which there was substantive disagreement on the 
critical issues, the UN Secretary General's representatives will 
seek ways to put the entire process in motion and it is possible 
that they will proceed with recommendations and advice 
addressing these issues.

  [Excerpt] The top leaders from the European Union [EU] and 
Russia, who came to Athens for important talks, met with Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou and discussed two current crises: 
the Bosnian problem and the issue that is of particular interest 
to Greece, the Skopje problem. 
  After the talks, which the prime minister held with Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel, Deputy Minister to Prime Minister Tilemakhis 
Khitiris made the following statement to correspondents: 
  [Begin Khitiris recording] The prime minister today received 
Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev and discussed the situation in 
Bosnia. The prime minister expressed Greece's positions, and I 
would say that there was agreement concerning the solution of 
the Bosnian problem, which should be a political solution. 
  Then the prime minister received Mr. Kinkel, the German 
foreign minister, and discussed the [EU] presidency issues. Mr. 
Kinkel said that Germany supports Greece in the presidency, the 
measures it is taking or intends to adopt. The question of the 
latest measures on Skopje was also raised for discussion and the 
prime minister had the opportunity to outline in detail the 
reasons for these measures, which are a Greek move in [words 
indistinct]. Mr. Kinkel expressed his understanding, although 
he has reservations on this issue. 
  I believe that they were two very important meetings, if one 
takes into consideration the current, previous, and upcoming 
events. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the 
government is particularly pleased because reason and unanimity 
prevailed and the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been 
resolved. He added that this is proof of how effective 
nonmilitary measures can be in handling a crisis. 
  Venizelos said: Diplomatic efforts must now intensify to 
find an immediate peaceful solution. The Greek Government, both 
as a government and as the European Union president, will make 
every effort to find a solution because Greece has the 
sensitivity of a Balkan country. 
  The government spokesman concluded: This nonmilitary outcome 
is very important.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias addressed a 
message of peace and a crystal clear warning in every direction 
from Ioannina, where he spoke at the official luncheon hosted in 
his honor by 8th Army Division commander Major General Andonios 
(Nialamangas). Mr. Papoulias said: We really live in a period 
that is fraught with immense dangers from the plunging of the 
Balkans into a series of wild civil wars. The involvement of 
foreign forces in these clashes and the impending bombing of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina constitute a deadly threat to world peace. 
  Mr. Papoulias added: The war flames are burning in our 
neighborhood, where unprecedented instability and uncertainty 
prevail. Our homeland constitutes the only oasis of stability 
in this sensitive region. With a steadfast peace-loving 
orientation, Greece extends a hand to all its neighbors seeking 
relations of friendship and cooperation. We do not claim 
anything from anyone. The only thing we demand is respect for 
our borders, respect of our fellow nationals' rights, and 
respect of our history. 
  The foreign minister further said: Unfortunately, certain 
quarters have interpreted this stance as weakness and began and 
are still continuing with provocations and claims against our 
country. The more we assert our stance on the question of peace, 
the more determined we are to defend our history, our emblems, 
and national heritage. 
  Mr. Papoulias also noted: We would like to send a message 
from here in Ioannina to our friends and partners: It is not 
Greece who is harming European Union [EU] solidarity; it has 
already been injured by all those who support the intransigence 
of [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia President Kiro] 
Gligorov and tolerate his indescribable claims. It is our 
homeland's inalienable right to protect our national integrity 
by adopting all those measures that will ensure that our rights 
are respected. Greece, far from harboring hegemonic intentions, 
wants the Balkans to become a place of sincere cooperation and 
mutual respect by all the peoples who live in this [words 
indistinct] peninsula. We cherish the hope that this prospect 
will prevail in the end over the disastrous logic of violence 
and war. We are certain that many of those who now criticize us 
will finally recognize the righteousness of our policy and our 
devotion to peace. 
  Mr. Papoulias concluded: The Greek Armed Forces, with their 
excellent morale, all-round training, and devotion to their 
professional duty, constitute the most stalwart basis of this 
peace-loving policy of our government.

  [Text] The Government is determined to apply the measures 
against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM], and the imposition of new measures is not 
ruled out if [FYROM President] Mr. Gligorov continues to ignore 
the conditions set by the Greek side. 
  Official opposition leader Miltiadhis Evert today reiterated 
support for the Government on national issues. Our correspondent 
Fotis Kafarakis has the following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Kafarakis] Despite the pressure being 
exercised by various sides, the Government's decision to place 
an economic blockade on Skopje remains firm. Moreover, it is 
not ruled out that new measures will be imposed if the leaders 
of the neighboring statelet continue to reject the three Greek 
conditions for resumption of the dialogue under UN auspices. 
  New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert made a statement in 
Preveza reiterating that Greece does not accept threats. Hands 
off hellenism and respect for Greece was the message that Mr. 
Evert sent in all directions. 
  Interior Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, speaking in 
Iraklion, 
talked about the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] 
government following a different national strategy on the Skopje 
issue than past governments. 
  [Tsokhatzopoulos] It struggles to change things, it 
struggles 
to succeed where others accepted conciliation and betrayal in 
the past. 
  [Kafarakis] The Greek measures against Skopje will be 
discussed at the European Union's council on general affairs in 
Brussels on Monday. Our 11 partners will examine if these 
measures are compatible with Greece's obligations to the 
European Union. This question was raised yesterday during the 
visit to Athens of both German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and 
Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. 
  For his part, Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras, 
who 
is visiting northern Greece, said that our partners should not 
demand we revoke the measures but should revoke their 
recognition of Skopje. 
  Finally, it is noted that the measures against Skopje are 
being applied in an absolutely satisfactory manner, as Deputy 
Finance Minister Alexandros Papadhopoulos has said. [end

  [Text] Athens, Feb 20 (AFP) -- Six of Greece's partners in 
the European Community have called on Athens to lift its 
economic blockade of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia-- FYROM], a European diplomat said here Sunday [20 
February]. 
  The source said the six ambassadors or representatives of 
London, Paris, Bonn, Rome, The Hague and Copenhagen, had jointly 
called on Greece to drop its action against the former Yugoslav 
republic during a meeting Friday night with the secretary 
general of the Foreign Ministry, Khristos Zakharakis. 
  It said the ambassadors had conveyed their countries' 
concern 
over the measures adopted last Wednesday. 
  The six countries concerned had all forged diplomatic 
relations with Skopje last December, before Greece took over the 
rotating presidency of the EC, much to Athens' disgruntlement. 
  While Greece has been asked to explain its decision to a 
meeting of the 12 EC foreign ministers in Brussels Monday, 
Public Order Minister Stilianos Papathemelis declared Saturday 
night that the blockade would remain in force until Macedonia 
backed down. 
  Greece accuses Macedonia of usurping the name which it 
maintains is historically Greek and of harbouring expansionist 
aims towards the Greek province of that name. 
  It has called on Skopje to renounce what it said was hostile 
propoganda and drop the star of Vergina from its flag, a symbol 
of the Macedonian dynasty in ancient times. 
  Athens is refusing to allow oil and other essential supplies 
through its northern port of Salonika, saying this is the only 
way to bring pressure to bear on Skopje to bow to Greek demands.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias reiterated today 
in Ioannina the government's decision to implement the measures 
against Skopje. 
  [Begin recording] [Papoulias] The measures we have adopted 
are adequate. It was a message, if you will, to [Macedonian 
President Kiro] Gligorov that Greece is not playing. As I have 
told our allies and partners, it is an issue of the Greek 
people. It is not an issue of a single government, but an issue 
of the Greek people. When there is an issue that affects the 
Greek people so much, the Greek Government cannot pull back. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Did the partners pressure the 
Greek Government in Athens? 
  [Papoulias] Look, the partners are of course interested in 
our having good relations with Gligorov because they know very 
well that Greece is the only country that can support the 
state's security and viability. The partners should not think 
about this after the shock of the embargo. They should have 
thought about that when we told them that we are [words 
indistinct] of the Greek people. The Greek Government cannot 
pull back. [end recording]

intention to accept any initiative that will reduce tension with 
Skopje. He stressed: 
  [Begin Pangalos recording] The government has charted its 
policy. We have the decision that was adopted by the Council of 
Ministers which is included in Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou's statement. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to 
give your colleagues the legal basis of our arguments. Our role 
has ended. We are waiting for [Macedonian President Kiro] 
Gligorov to speak. We have said that we will accept all 
initiatives that will lead to a disengagement of the situation 
as well as peace and cooperation in the Balkans. [end recording] 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou also left for 
Brussels to explain to the European Union [EU] Council of 
Foreign Ministers the Greek positions on the embargo against 
Skopje. The deputy will explain in detail the logic behind this 
action, noting the need for respect for our national rights.

  [Text] Russia `may undertake' an initiative to settle the 
Greek-Skopjean [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] dispute. Government sources reached this 
conclusion based on Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's 
talks in Athens. This conclusion is also strengthened by 
information from Belgrade, according to which the Russian 
Government has a broader plan to settle all the aspects of the 
Yugoslav crisis. The ease with which Russia achieved the 
lifting of the deadlock in Bosnia-Herzegovina confirms this fact. 
  The moderation with which Skopje has so far dealt with the 
Greek partial economic embargo reinforces the view that Russia 
has undertaken a behind-the-scenes diplomatic activity. 
  We must not let the fact that large European countries such 
as Germany, which only reacted "lukewarmly" to the Greek 
Government decision, pass unnoticed. Tomorrow's critical 
European Union [EU] Council of Ministers meeting will clarify 
the position of the 11.

  [Text] Asked to comment on U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's remarks describing the Greek measures against 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] as 
harsh and excessive, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos 
said experience has shown that reasons may be misinterpreted. 
Therefore, Greece had to express its views with actions. The 
United States, the United Nations, and our allies must realize 
that [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's government should be 
pressured. 
  Venizelos added: Recent experience has proved that Skopje 
misinterpreted the U.S. recognition, with Gligorov's letter to 
U.S. President Bill Clinton being the most obvious example. The 
spokesman said: All of these things forced Greece to adopt 
these specific measures, although with a delay because it 
expected its partners to put pressure on the neighboring state. 
Venizelos said: With these measures, we expect to go stronger 
into a dialogue under UN auspices 
  Asked to comment on the U.S. secretary of state's insistence 
on calling Skopje Macedonia, Venizelos said: Christopher 
probably does not remember that his government recognized 
Gligorov's state a week ago under the name FYROM.

  [Text] Turkey has turned up the heat in the Aegean, 
stepping up activities through repeated violations of Greek 
national air space, defense ministry sources said yesterday. 
  Turkish warplanes are regularly intercepted by Greek 
fighters 
in Greek national air space, but the sources said Turkish 
sorties over the Aegean were now being flown in attack 
formations and planes armed with air-to-air and air-to-surface 
missiles had buzzed Greek navy boats patrolling Greek waters. 
They added that two Turkish naval vessels had also strayed into 
Greek waters off the island of Milos, 77 nautical miles from 
Pireaivs.

  [Text] All U.S. AWACS have been withdrawn from Aktion base. 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Deputy Defense Minister 
Nikolaos Kouris stressed that Greece focuses on finding a 
peaceful solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Papoulias said he 
hopes the crisis in Bosnia will be overcome if, as he said, a 
mortar does not hit Sarajevo's market again. 
  Discussing the withdrawal of AWACS from Aktion base, 
Papoulias said NATO knew that Greece was not going to 
participate in any military operation against Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Kouris said it is Greece's sovereign right to decide on the 
AWACS and non-participation in the crisis. Referring to the 
possibility of air raids against Sarajevo, Kouris said anything 
is possible. 
  Interior Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos appeared optimistic, 
saying he hopes there will be no military moves after NATO's 
ultimatum expires tonight. He added that every side gave 
assurances that UN political dialogue will proceed in order to 
resolve the Bosnian problem peacefully.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has declared that if the 
Serbs fail to withdraw their heavy weapons around Sarajevo, the 
ultimatum issued to them must be carried out. Demirel said: 
This is a last chance for international organizations. If they 
do not keep to their word, they will be ruined and no one will 
ever believe them again. 
  Demirel replied to reporters' questions at Cankaya Mansion 
today. Recalling Democracy Party leader Hatip Dicle's 
statements in connection with the terrorist incident in Tuzla, a 
reporter asked Demirel whether this will threaten elections in 
the southeast. Demirel replied that there are no problems with 
regard to election security. Noting that five innocent youths 
were killed in Tuzla, Demirel remarked that no one can qualify 
this as normal. He said: Those who encourage bloodshed will 
drown in blood. The bloodshed must stop. If that statement is 
correct, I would greatly regret it.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that the 
goal in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not to launch an air raid at all 
costs, but to end the siege on Sarajevo. He added that one 
should not be very optimistic about the NATO announcement that 
it does not deem it necessary to launch an air raid on the 
Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina at this stage. 
  In an assessment to Turkish Radio and Television following 
the NATO announcement that it does not deem it necessary to 
launch an air raid on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin recalled that 
the regions outside Sarajevo are also under siege by the Serbs. 
Pointing out that NATO should take action on that issue as 
well, Cetin said Turkey will take steps to achieve this end. 
  Noting that he discussed the NATO ultimatum by phone with 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Cetin said: Our goal is 
not to launch an air raid at all costs. Our goal -- everyone's 
goal -- was to end the siege on Sarajevo. Now, are we faced 
with a delaying tactic or have physical conditions prevented it? 
This will be clarified in the coming hours. In our view, what 
is more important is that one should not view this development 
too optimistically. 
  Cetin stated that if, in the aftermath of recent 
developments, the Bosnian Muslims are attacked and cannot defend 
themselves, then the world and NATO will be responsible for the 
consequences. Cetin added: By not lifting the arms embargo on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the world, which bears moral responsibility 
for all the tragedy that has been caused so far, will now be 
directly responsible for what happens. I do not even want to 
think that NATO will permit such a thing to happen at this 
stage. I believe NATO will do what is necessary. 
  Cetin concluded by saying that the necessary pressure should 
be applied to the Serbs and Croats to secure the just requests 
of the Bosnians and that [words indistinct].

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that even if 
only one weapon remains outside Sarajevo, NATO must implement 
its decision to intervene if it wants to maintain its 
respectability and credibility. 
  Replying to questions by our correspondent, Cetin pointed 
out 
that all weapons outside Sarajevo must be under UN control 
within the next few hours. Otherwise, he said, NATO must 
intervene. 
  Cetin said he had a telephone conversation with Bosnian 
President Alija Izetbegovic this afternoon. He pointed out that 
20 percent of the Serbs' heavy weapons have not been placed 
under UN control yet, and that there are reports that some of 
the weapons are being taken to residential areas. The latter 
constitute a potential danger, Cetin said, and must be placed 
under UN control with the other weapons. 
  Cetin recalled that Turkey, a NATO member, has been saying 
for the past 22 months that a limited air operation would be a 
first step toward the solution of the problem. The latest 
developments justify our position, he stressed.

  [Text] In Ankara today, Turkish Defense Minister Mehmet 
Golhan rejected in principle the personal initiative of his 
Czech counterpart Antonin Baudys for resolving the Bosnian 
situation. During his talks with Antonin Baudys, Golhan stated 
that the initiative did not reflect the present situation in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. The Turkish side opposed above all the 
supposition that the conflict in this former Yugoslav republic 
was religiously motivated. According to the Turkish minister of 
defense, Ankara was aiming above all to preserve the territorial 
integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state that had been 
recognized by the United Nations and by the international 
community. The Baudys initiative is, on the contrary, alleged 
to envisage the split of the republic.

Nagorno-Karabakh problem, took over the term chairmanship from 
Italy. 
  Eliasson, before meeting with Cetin, said he came to Turkey 
to exchange opinions with the concerned sides adding he will 
later go to the region and meet with other sides. 
  He said defending the international community's and CSCE's 
principles were very important and added that the 
Nagorno-Karabakh problem should be solved in political ways. 
  Foreign Minister Cetin said most of the Azeri territory were 
under Armenian occupation. `It is very diffucult to hold a peace 
conference before this occupying attitude ends,' he added. 
  Cetin said Nagorno-Karabakh was Azeri territory and with the 
CSCE resolutions this was once again confirmed. 
  Recalling that Turkey wanted Armenians to withdraw from the 
Azeri territory soon the foreign minister said Turkey was ready 
to do its best on the issue. 
  Eliasson will leave for Baku, where he will hold a series of 
contacts with Azeri officials. 
  Turkey and Russia are active partners in the nine-nation 
Minsk Group that is working to arrange an Armenian withdrawal 
before an international conference can convene on the future of 
the enclave.

  [Text] Catherine Lalumiere, Council of Europe secretary 
general, has said that it is out of the question for the Council 
to send an observer to the local elections to be held in Turkey 
on 27 March. Lalumiere, who arrived in Turkey today to hold 
talks on regional and international problems, said that the 
Council sends observers to countries that wish to be members in 
a bid to assess the situation in those countries. 
  She added that the situation in the Balkans and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be assessed during her contacts in 
Ankara and that she will also listen to the views of Turkish 
officials on the developments in Russia, the Black Sea, and the 
Caucasus. 
  Expressing concern over the recent bomb attacks in Turkey, 
Lalumiere said that the human rights issue will be assessed 
within this framework. She concluded by saying that she will 
also discuss the Cyprus situation during her talks with Turkish 
officials.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Council of Europe Secretary 
General Catherine Lalumiere was received by President Suleyman 
Demirel at the Cankaya Mansion today. 
  A statement issued by the President's Office declared that 
the developments in the aftermath of the Cold War in Europe and 
the subject of terrorism in Turkey were discussed during the 
meeting. According to the statement, Demirel remarked that 
European organizations, which were established under Cold War 
conditions, are facing difficulties under the new conditions. 
Demirel stressed that the aggressors in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
in the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict have remained unpunished. 
Such developments cast a shadow over the credibility of these 
organizations, Demirel said, adding that the recent ultimatum 
issued by NATO to the Serbs is a favorable sign. Commenting on 
terrorism, the president underlined the terrorists' separatist 
and racist character. He said that the terrorist organization 
cannot attain its goals and a struggle is being waged against 
those who attack Turkey's integrity. 
  Vefa Tanir, acting speaker of the Turkish Grand National 
Assembly, also received Lalumiere and conferred with her. 
During the meeting, Lalumiere said that Turkey occupied an 
extremely important place in the Council of Europe and its 
attitude and moves are followed with interest. Tanir, in turn, 
declared that many problems can be overcome if the eyes turned 
on Turkey's moves are impartial. During the meeting, Lalumiere 
presented Tanir with a medal from the Council of Europe and 
Tanir reciprocated with a porcelain dish with a picture of the 
Turkish parliament. 
  Lalumiere later held a meeting with Sayit Kemal Mimaroglu, 
leader of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Turkish 
group, and other members of the group.

  [Text] Turkey has protested Greece refusing entry into the 
country of two religious officials who were sent by Turkey to 
provide religious services for the Turkish minority in western 
Thrace. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement on the subject noted that two 
religious officials who left for western Thrace yesterday, were 
sent back by Greek authorities at the Ipsala border checkpoint. 
The statement added that the Greek ambassador to Ankara was 
summoned to the Foreign Ministry and a protest was lodged with 
Greece in connection with the incident. 
  The statement said: There is a lesson to be learned with 
regard to contemporary concepts and norms from the fact that 
Greece -- a member of the European Union -- is unable to 
tolerate an invitation to two religious officials from abroad 
extended by a minority in the country in order to meet their 
needs for worship during a holy month.

  [Text] Ankara, Feb 21 (AA) -- President Rauf Denktas of 
the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] who arrived in 
Ankara on Monday [21 February] for a series of talks with high 
level Turkish officials said 'we will discuss confidence 
building measures with Ankara'. 
  Denktas is accompanied by Prime Minister Hakki Atun, 
Minister 
for State and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur, Minister for 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasit. 
  Denktas said during his first official visit to Turkey with 
the new coalition government they will coordinate efforts as the 
new rounds of Cyprus talks which are scheduled to take place 
under the auspices of the United Nations. 
  TRNC president said the talks in Ankara will focus on the 
package of 'confidence building measures,' adding 'we will 
inform the Turkish Government about our thoughts on the 
measures'. 
  He said TRNC is ready to say 'yes' to a satisfactory, 
balanced and stable solution to the Cyprus problem. 
  Denktas said a positive result could only be taken if the 
Greek Cypriots show the same good will. 
  U.N.-sponsored intercommunal talks on Cyprus were 
interrupted 
last July. 
  Cyprus has been practically divided since 1974 when Turkey 
conducted a peace operation to the island following a 
Greek-backed coup which attempted to annex the island to Greece 
and to annihilate its Turkish Cypriot population. 
  The TRNC came to existence in 1983. 
  Denktas as well as Prime Minister Atun and those 
accompanying 
them will return to Cyprus on Wednesday after their talks in 
Ankara.

  [Text] There are still repercussions from the bomb attack 
on Democracy Party [DEP] headquarters in Ankara. It was 
announced that the police are continuing with the investigation, 
but so far no one has been detained. 
  President Demirel and some politicians condemned the bomb 
attack. In his turn, DEP leader Hatip Dicle said they will 
participate in the elections regardless of all the pressure on 
the party. 
  [Begin recording] [Metin Corabatir] The bomb experts 
conducted an investigation at the building where the explosion 
took place. The teams, which could not enter the building last 
night because of severed power lines, collected evidence in 
connection with the explosion. 
  It is believed that the highly explosive bomb, which was 
planted in the building's elevator and which killed one person 
and injured 20, was identical in structure to the bomb that was 
planted in the building last week and which also caused damage. 
  A number of German parliamentarians visited DEP headquarters 
and expressed their sympathies. 
  Hatip Dicle, who organized a news conference at DEP 
headquarters, held the government responsible for the attack. 
Dicle also severely criticized Speaker of Parliament Husamettin 
Cindoruk, who opposed the dispatch of observers to the local 
elections by the European Parliament 
  [Dicle] Now, I am asking the esteemed Cindoruk: The day you 
wrote a letter to the European Parliament, the counterguerrillas 
again bombed our party's headquarters. Now, how can you claim 
that under these conditions there could exist a just and free 
election atmosphere? 
  Mr. Mentese made a very unfortunate statement yesterday. He 
said the DEP bombed its own building. An interior minister 
cannot lower himself to that level, or make such base 
statements. [end recording] 
  Interior Minister Nahit Mentese reacted very strongly when 
he 
was told that Hatip Dicle used the word base. Mentese accused 
Hatip Dicle of being a traitor to the country. Upon being 
informed of Hatip Dicle's words used against him, Interior 
Minister Mentese said: What else could be expected from a 
traitor to the country? The entire nation has risen up against 
Hatip. He makes fun of the nation, while young reserve officers 
die. Can I ever accept such a man as my counterpart?

"Democracy Party Calls For a Cease-Fire"] 
  [Text] Diyarbakir--The Democracy Party [DEP] has called for 
a cease-fire with only 40 days left for the local elections on 
27 March. DEP leader Hatip Dicle said that free local elections 
must be held under equal conditions so that the Kurdish problem 
can be resolved in unity. He asserted: "We wish to take part 
in the elections. However, free elections must be held under 
equal conditions. A cease-fire must be imposed to end 
bloodshed." 
  Hatip Dicle and DEP Deputies Seat Yurttas, Nizamettin Toguc, 
and Slim Sadak held a news conference in the Milan movie theater 
at 1100 yesterday morning. Extensive security measures were 
taken during the news conference, which was attended by 250 
people. Dicle disclosed the names of the DEP candidate mayors 
from eastern and southeastern Turkey, and said: "I urge the 
government to reconsider the need to resolve the Kurdish problem 
in unity." Claiming that attacks on his party have increased, 
Dicle asserted: "Won't these attacks cast a shadow on the 
elections?" 
  Hatip Dicle recalled the arrest of several DEP candidate 
mayors and claimed that the pressure on members of his party has 
been intensified. He said he will hold talks with President 
Demirel and ask for help. Stressing that the European 
Parliament will send observers to the local elections, Dicle 
asserted: "We will explain our anxiety to President Demirel and 
inform him about the DEP policy on solving the Kurdish problem. 
Furthermore, we will discuss the realization of the European 
Parliament's call for holding secure local elections." 
  The DEP's candidate mayors from the eastern and southeastern 
provinces are as follows: Meting Toprak from Diyarbakir; Bedim 
Cetin from Adiyaman; Osman Nuri Aksoy from Agri; Ishak Tape from

<F P=106> [Report by Sedat Sertoglu: "Bargaining Talks for Osman </F>
Ocalan's Return to Turkey"] 
  [Text] A deadlock has emerged in the secret talks Turkey 
has had with Iran during the past six months for the return of 
Osman Ocalan, Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leader Abdullah 
Ocalan's brother. The talks were deadlocked when Ankara decided 
that the Tehran regime's demands for the handing over of Ocalan 
to Turkish officials would create a very serious situation for 
Turkey. 
  The talks between the two countries began after Turkey 
established where Osman Ocalan lived in Iran. Ankara contacted 
the Iranian officials to have Ocalan returned to Turkey after 
the Turkish officials established where he lived in Tehran and 
Qom. The Tehran regime seemed willing during the initial stages 
of the talks, which were also attended by Syrian officials from 
time to time, to agree to return Ocalan to Turkey. However, 
Iran later put forward excessive demands. The Iranian officials 
first asked that all Iranian citizens in Turkey who opposed the 
Tehran regime be returned to Iran and prevented from using 
Turkey's territory for their activities. But that was not all. 
The Iranian officials also asked that Mustafa Hejri, secretary 
general of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan in Iran, be 
returned to that country. Ankara officially informed Tehran 
that Hejri does not live in Turkey. 
  It was ascertained during the talks that the Tehran regime 
planned to execute their opponents without a trial as soon as 
they were returned. The matter was assessed in several meetings 
in Ankara and the view that the executions, which would take 
place at gallows set up in the streets of Tehran, would create a 
very strong reaction in Western countries, including the United 
States, and cause Turkey to be blamed gained weight. It was 
also stressed that the PKK may take such events as an 
opportunity to launch a campaign against Turkey, in which it 
would accuse the Turkish Government of "returning innocent 
civilians to be executed in Iran." 
  In view of all that, the Turkish officials have decided to 
suspend their talks with the Iranian officials "for the time 
being." However, regardless of the deadlock, Turkey has not 
abandoned its demand for the return of Ocalan, who is suffering 
from a serious kidney trouble.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Klaus-Peter </F>
Siegloch in Bonn on 20 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Siegloch] Mr. Kinkel, can one give the all-clear 
signal this evening? In other words, have the Serbs completely 
withdrawn their heavy artillery? 
  [Kinkel] No, we cannot give the all-clear signal, nor do we 
know what things will be like when the ultimatum expires. The 
Serbs are withdrawing, but they are having problems with the 
weather. We have to wait and see. NATO is ready to carry out 
air strikes. We all hope that air strikes will not be necessary. 
  [Siegloch] One can, at least, say one thing -- the 
ultimatum, which, for the first time, was a serious threat to 
the Serbs, has had a certain success. Most of the guns have 
been withdrawn by now. One now wonders: The fighting in other 
Bosnian towns, such as in Bihac and Tuzla, continues. The 
fighting is continuing with greater intensity than before. Does 
one not have to pose a similar ultimatum and say: Fighting must 
finally stop there as well? 
  [Kinkel] We deliberately tried to pick out Sarajevo, as pars 
pro toto, so to speak, as a part that speaks for all, and 
because the situation in Sarajevo is particularly tragic and 
bad. However, you are naturally right -- Sarajevo is only part 
of the terrible military conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, 
and, indeed, fighting is more intensive than ever around Bihac 
and Tuzla. Therefore, after Sarajevo, one will have to think 
about what can be done in these other towns. The question is 
justified and must be answered. 
  [Siegloch] There are reports that there may soon be a summit 
on Bosnia, which will be attended by Clinton, Yeltsin, and 
Chancellor Kohl. What is true about these reports? 
  [Kinkel] Well, it is certainly correct that, in particular, 
the political solution, which is and must still be striven for 
by everyone, has made progress as a result of recent 
developments, also because of the Russian help, because of the 
Russian influence on the Serbian side. We must use this 
political momentum, which has been initiated now. 
  Therefore, next Tuesday [22 February], the political 
directors of Russia, the United States, the European states that 
are involved, and the United Nations will meet here in Bonn to 
think about how we can progress with this process, this European 
action plan, on which the Americans have now gratifyingly 
concentrated very strongly, too. Then we will wait and see what 
is going to happen after this directors' conference -- perhaps 
there will be further political conferences, but this cannot yet 
be said definitely. 
  [Siegloch] What is the role of the Germans in these talks? 
Are we some kind of mediators? 
  [Kinkel] Well, in particular, if military issues are 
involved, we should exercise restraint because we are a bad 
adviser in these matters due to our constitutional and our 
historic situation. However, we have a very essential mediating 
role. I played this role at the troika talks of the European 
Union last Friday. The chancellor has played this role through 
his many telephone conversations. We, together with the 
Americans, are involved most strongly in the humanitarian sphere 
and, by holding this conference on Tuesday, we are showing our 
good role as mediators. We have particularly good relations 
with the Croats and the Muslims -- that means, with two of the 
parties involved in the conflict -- and we want to make good use 
of that. 
  [Siegloch] Mr. Foreign Minister, do you think that we will 
be able to adhere to this military restraint of ours for a long 
time, or do we not at least have to show in one field -- by 
sending paramedics to Bosnia, for instance -- that the Germans 
want to get more directly involved? 
  [Kinkel] Well, we have already gotten involved in many areas 
-- in Cambodia, in Iraq, and we got involved in Somalia. 
However, we still have this constitutional brake, which, if 
maintained, will harm Germany. I say this as foreign minister 
and, therefore, here and now, I once again call on the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to give up its blockade. We 
must become able to act in foreign policy. For that, we need 
the amendment to the Constitution, and I can only say that the 
SPD must participate in that, especially if it wants to become 
capable of ruling. 
  [Siegloch] Thank you very much, Mr. Kinkel.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 18 (AFP) -- The European Community 
warned Friday [18 February] it could issue a legal challenge 
over Greece's trade embargo of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], an EC official said, raising the 
prospect of the current EC president being dragged into court by 
its Community partners. 
  The controversial Greek move will be discussed by EC foreign 
ministers at their meeting Monday, the European Commission 
spokesman said. 
  Experts at the executive EC Commission are to study the 
impact of the Greek decision, which could breach Community laws 
on free trade with a third state. 
  Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, attending a meeting of 
the EC "troika" of foreign ministers of past, present and future 
presidency incumbents in Athens, said the blockade was 
"naturally in contradiction" with the Maastricht Treaty on 
European Union. 
  Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos swiftly 
rejected the move, saying his government's decision "conformed 
to European law." 
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, also attending, 
earlier 
demanded that Greece immediately lift its trade embargo of its 
land-locked neighbour, and issued a sharp attack on Athens' 
"extraordinary" decision.

  [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today hailed the 
"tremendous step forward" achieved in Sarajevo by the withdrawal 
of Serbian artillery from the outskirts of the beleaguered city. 
  He said such tactics might be appropriate elsewhere in 
war-torn Bosnia. But he insisted that following the success of 
the NATO air-strike threat, the immediate priority was to get 
the aid convoys moving again. 
  Mr Rifkind said the outcome could be regarded as a tentative 
success. "It is clear that the vast majority of weapons have 
been handed over to the United Nations and the rest appear to 
have been moved from the 20 kilometre range." Nine sites still 
had to be visited "but there is every reason to believe that 
they have been vacated, too", he added. 
  Asked on BBC Breakfast News if he was suspicious of the 
Bosnian Serbs' intentions, Mr Rifkind warned that the threat of 
air strikes remained available if there was any attempt to use 
artillery against Sarajevo. "This is not a threat that has 
disappeared," he said. "This is a very tremendous step forward, 
but only a step forward. We are now preventing the use of 
artillery shells against Sarajevo. It is only one more small 
step towards ending the war in Bosnia." 
  Asked why the air strike threat could not have been 
introduced months ago, Mr Rifkind said: "You can only achieve 
things when circumstances permit it." The Serbs had realised 
that they could never take Sarajevo and therefore a withdrawal 
was not such a humiliation. 
  The United Nations and NATO had to avoid taking sides in 
someone else's civil war, but still had to exercise maximum 
influence, diplomatic and humanitarian, to reduce the horrors of 
the war. 
  Mr Rifkind said it might be appropriate to adopt the formula 
elsewhere. "But the immediate priority is to get aid moving 
again. The possibility of air strikes meant that UN convoys had 
to take shelter. 
  "In the middle of winter people will starve if the aid does 
not get through," Mr Rifkind added.

  [Excerpts] Two days before the expiration of the NATO 
ultimatum, the Bosnian Serbs are making more appeasing 
statements. [passage omitted] 
  We know that Russia played an important role in the 
diplomatic breakthrough of the last 24 hours. The Moscow 
mediation has offered the Serbs an honorable face-saving device. 
Alain Juppe has welcomed the prospect of sending Russian 
peace-keeping forces to Sarajevo. Interviewed by Harry Sago, the 
French foreign minister explained that he was asking for such a 
measure: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] For nearly 10 months I have been 
asking the Russians to join us in the field. It is not about 
asking the Russian soldiers to be [word indistinct] buffer. It 
is about putting contingents from as many countries as possible 
under the UN banner, under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
command -- which is led as you know by a French general for the 
whole of the former Yugoslavia, by a British general for Bosnia, 
and by another French general, General Soubirou for Sarajevo. I 
will be pleased if a Russian peace-keeping contingent is 
included. We are told it [latest diplomatic breakthrough] is a 
Russian victory, I say it is a European victory. We have never 
ceased to ask for it. I am happy from the bottom of my heart 
because this could be an element that would facilitate the 
settlement of the problem. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Siegmar Schelling report: "Kinkel Praises Russia for Its </F>
Bosnian Initiative"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) thinks that Serbia's yielding in 
Sarajevo is due to the "seriousness of the NATO ultimatum," the 
"initiative" of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and 
Washington's "more intensive involvement." 
  In an interview with WELT AM SONNTAG, Kinkel stressed that 
the Serbs' giving in is "a great success for NATO. I am sure 
that the Serbian besiegers of Sarajevo would not have reacted in 
this way without the massive NATO threat." NATO is "firmly 
determined to maintain its ultimatum and to really get down to 
business if the conditions are not fulfilled." 
  Kinkel praised the Russian initiative for Bosnia. For Bonn 
it "has always been particularly important that Russia be 
included in the political solution." With his initiative, 
Yeltsin has "leaned far out of the window. If the Serbs do not 
fulfill their promises made to Yeltsin, they would lose their 
last advocate." 
  The more intensive involvement of the Americans, who are now 
ready "to fully join in and make use of their influence on the 
parties to the conflict, in particular on the Muslims," also 
speaks for the possibility of a political solution. 
  Kinkel said that now it is very important to "make use of 
the 
momentum." If, as a goal for the near future, it becomes 
possible to achieve UN administration for the area of Sarajevo, 
this could be the beginning of a new stage to come to a 
political solution in the end. The decisive thing will be 
whether one can make it clear to the parties to the conflict, 
the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims: "Only if they join in and are 
ready for a peaceful solution will such a solution be possible." 
  However, the minister warned against precipitate euphoria: 
"We have been disappointed and led by the nose too often." It 
cannot be ruled out, either, that the Serbs will now try to 
shift their heavy weapons from Sarajevo to another battlefield 
in Bosnia. If this is done, one "must think again about how 
they can be prevented from doing that." 
  Germany has "a not unimportant share" in the latest 
development, Kinkel said. Chancellor Kohl was in permanent 
contact with Russia's President Yeltsin; he himself was partly 
in direct contact with his Soviet counterpart Kozyrev. There 
were also permanent contacts with Washington and the European 
partners. Kinkel stressed that in the overall context Bonn can 
only play a mediating role, "because we cannot send German 
soldiers directly to the area of crisis for constitutional and 
historic reasons."

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by NTV editor </F>
in chief Peter Staisch at the Christian Democratic Union party 
conference in Hamburg, date not given; monitored in progress -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Staisch] ....but the main emphasis must be on 
relief in this particular situation in this region. 
  [Ruehe] Yes, the people of Sarajevo have won, because we all 
remember the terrible scenes. This was possible only through a 
mixture of diplomacy and the threat of military force. It seems 
that the vast majority [of Bosnian Serb artillery] has been 
withdrawn, or put under UN control. This is important progress. 
Now, similar living conditions have to be created in Bihac, 
Tuzla, Srebrenica, and elsewhere and progress has to be made at 
the peace negotiations. 
  [Staisch] The great catchword, the historical catchword, 
which one thinks of is appeasement. A shell fell on Sarajevo 
market and suddenly the conscience of the world, the West, NATO, 
and the United Nations, or however you want to call this 
conscience, has finally stirred. Could this mixture of 
diplomacy and military threats that you described not have been 
thought of a lot earlier? 
  [Ruehe] Yes, of course. There were proposals of this kind, 
but there was always a tense relationship between the countries 
who have troops on the ground and are giving humanitarian aid 
and the others who pursued a mixture of diplomacy and the threat 
of military strikes. Then things got so bad that an agreement 
was reached on this policy, thank goodness. However, it was 
also important that Russia joined in the diplomatic process. 
This is still not a solution to the conflict, of course, but a 
limited and important success, and this has to be continued. It 
is true that mistakes were made in the past, that the Europeans 
did not share the same political views and that there was 
conflict which meant that such conclusive action was not 
possible any earlier. 
  [Staisch] So what can we learn from last Sunday night [20 
February] to Monday morning for Bihac and Tuzla? 
  [Ruehe] The situation in each of these towns is different, 
but one thing seems clear to me: It is not enough just to 
protect the UN troops. When we talk about safe areas, this 
should not mean safe areas for UN troops, but it should mean, as 
has been enforced in Sarajevo, safe areas for people. And these 
towns mentioned and a few others, I think, are such safe areas 
and the safety of people there must also be enforced. 
  [Staisch] But this would mean that -- and we read yesterday 
and the day before yesterday in news agency reports that while 
the ultimatum was being met in Sarajevo, the bombing of Bihac 
and Tuzla had been stepped up -- basically the ultimatum 
strategy should be extended to the whole of Bosnia with the same 
determination as shown in Sarajevo. 
  [Ruehe] We will have to see whether this will also be done 
using ultimatums. But it is true that it is good for the people 
of Sarajevo who have probably suffered most, or where at least 
this has been most visible to the international public. 
Television cannot reach all areas. Things cannot stay as they 
are. This mixture of diplomacy and military pressure must be 
continued. But this can only work ultimately if people learn to 
live together again and we need a peace treaty to bring this 
about. 
  [Staisch] What is the significance of the return of the 
Russians to the diplomatic and also the military stage? There 
have never been blue helmets from the United States or from the 
Western powers and Russians under the same UN umbrella on the 
same spot. 
  [Ruehe] This is also an important step for the Russians, 
because I remember the talks I had when they said we need our 
soldiers in the southern area of the former USSR. That was why 
they were kept in the background internationally. And finally 
NATO's decision-making powers made this change in Russian policy 
possible. 
  [Staisch] There is a NATO council meeting tomorrow. What 
will be discussed? What will be analyzed? What will the future 
course be? What will NATO say: Good, we have been successful. 
But what will be the next diplomatic and military steps? What 
concrete demands will have to be made? 
  [Ruehe] We will first take full stock of the results and 
will 
certainly come to the conclusion that this was the correct 
strategy. And then we will have to discuss how we can improve 
the situation in other areas but I cannot anticipate what that 
will entail at present. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Athens, Feb 19 (AFP)--Greece on Saturday [19 
February] tightened its economic blockade against neighbouring 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] 
despite bitter criticism over the shock move from its European 
Community partners. 
  [Deputy] Finance Minister Alexandros Papadhopoulos said 
Saturday that additional measures ordered Friday forbidding the 
importation of all Macedonian products had been applied "in a 
very satisfactory manner" and would "prevent any fraud." 
  Papadhopoulos also ordered Friday all Greek border customs 
points to bar the passage of oil products destined for Macedonia. 
  The moves strengthened the trade embargo imposed Wednesday, 
when Greece barred Macedonia access to the Greek port of 
Thessaloniki, halting its oil imports, thereby drawing a volley 
of criticism. 
  Greece's European Community partners sharply criticised the 
embargo Friday, as Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania and Italy agreed to 
set up a road and rail supply corridor to the country to be 
coordinated in the Bulgarian capital. 
  Athens, which currently holds the revolving EC presidency, 
is 
due to explain its action Monday at a meeting of the community's 
12 foreign ministers in Brussels, while the European Commission 
is to examine its legality. 
  Papadhopoulos on Saturday reiterated earlier Greek claims 
that the embargo was "legally founded with regard to national, 
European and international rights," while the Greek Orthodox 
church assured the government of its "total support." 
  The church's metropolitan, Monsignor Seraphim, said the move 
was "approved by the overwhelming majority of the Greek 
population" and showed the determination of the government to 
"defend its just cause and its rights." 
  The action also drew media backing, with the influential 
liberal daily I Kathimerini stressing in a front-page editorial 
that Athens's would not bow to international pressure and that 
it was now up to other EC countries to resolve the crisis by 
putting pressure on Macedonia to cede to Greece's demands. 
  The move was designed to force Macedonia to change its name, 
which Athens says is solely part of Greek heritage and implies 
expansionist ambitions over the northern Greek province of 
Macedonia, and to stop spreading "anti-Greek propaganda." 
  Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, had said Friday while 
attending a meeting in Athens of the EC "troika" of past, 
present and future EC presidents -- Belgium, Greece and Germany 
-- that the blockade was "naturally in contradiction" with the 
Maastricht Treaty on European union. 
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, also attending the 
troika meeting, demanded Greece immediately lift the embargo of 
its land-locked neighbour in a sharp attack on Athens' 
"extraordinary" unilateral action. 
  Most of Greece's EC partners recognised Macedonia shortly 
before Athens took over the EC presidency in January, while the 
United States recognised the country earlier this month.

half an hour on developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  A statement issued by the Prime Minister's Press Center 
stated: The telephone conversation, which took place while a

presidential palace, lasted approximately 30 minutes. The 
developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed during the 
conversation. In a statement after her conversation with 
Clinton, Ciller said: Both Mr. Clinton and I are hopeful about 
developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina following the NATO decision 
on the subject. 
  The statement added: Mr. Clinton also sent a letter to 
Ciller. In his letter on Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was relayed 
to the prime minister by the U.S. ambassador to Ankara, Clinton 
thanked Ciller for telephoning him before her departure for 
Sarajevo. Clinton described Ciller's visit to Sarajevo, 
accompanied by Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto, as courageous 
and expressed his admiration. Clinton also stressed that he 
fully shares Ciller's feelings with regard to the inhuman attack 
launched against innocent people in Sarajevo on 5 February.

<F P=106> [Article signed H.T.: "Aeronautics -- Europe Strikes </F>
Back..."] 
  [Text] European consortium Airbus Industries announced 
yesterday that it was considering filing a GATT complaint 
against the trade policy of U.S. manufacturers. The European 
Commission, however, does not seem to be in a hurry to come to 
the rescue of European industry. 
  The solemn announcement by U.S. President Bill Clinton of an 
order for some 60 civilian aircraft from Saudi Arabia has been 
making a few waves. First of all, because it is unusual for a 
head of state to announce such commercial transactions. And 
also, because, by choosing to make the announcement himself, Mr. 
Clinton gives rise to speculation on the conditions surrounding 
the award of the contract. The facts: Intent on renovating its 
fleet, Saudi Airlines had initiated talks with the world's three 
leading airliner manufacturers, America's Boeing and 
McDonnell-Douglas and Europe's Airbus. High-level U.S. 
Administration officials went on several trips to Riyadh, while 
Bill Clinton repeatedly said he would use all his influence to 
tip the scales in favor of the U.S. manufacturers. 
  The talks began in the spring of 1993 and are not officially 
over and, in response to a Saudi request, Airbus Industries has 
extended the validity of its offer until 1 March. All this does 
not prevent President Clinton from announcing that the contract 
has been awarded to "his" manufacturers. Some information even 
trickles out as to the way the bounty is to be distributed 
between Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas; it is indicated that the 
order for civilian aircraft could be accompanied with another 
order for KC135 flying tankers, and the whole package is funded 
by a loan from Eximbank, an institution whose role is the same 
as that of the French COFACE [French Insurance Company for 
External Trade]. Worth noting, however, is the fact that the 
U.S. manufacturers, the Saudi authorities, and the Saudi airline 
have not followed Bill Clinton's lead and are keeping remarkably 
quiet. 
<H5>  GATT Complaint </H5>
  The Europeans maintain they have received no official 
confirmation. Nevertheless, in the meantime, Airbus Industries' 
legal staff has begun working on a possible GATT complaint. 
Article 4 of the Agreement forbids any state incentive in favor 
of commercial deals, even in the form of debt rescheduling or 
military agreements. On the other hand, the absence of an 
official confirmation from the main parties leaves room for 
doubt, yet some people go so far as to speculate that this was a 
last-minute attempt by the U.S. Administration to secure the 
contract. 
  In any event, the behavior of Bill Clinton and his officials 
amply justifies the often-expressed fears of European 
manufacturers. Indeed, it seems to demonstrate once again, and 
in a most obvious manner, that for the United States trade 
liberalization is nothing more than an export commodity. All 
this does not bode well for the future talks meant to settle the 
aeronautics issue. One remembers that when the GATT deal was 
concluded on 15 December 1993, this issue was left "on the back 
burner." An interim agreement remains in force until new 
negotiations are completed. Should there be no new agreement, 
however, the aeronautics industry will have to comply with the 
general rules. And, as emphasized by manufacturers, a strategic 
sector such as aeronautics -- whose production cycles are very 
long and which requires considerable investment levels -- cannot 
do without state support. 
  In such a context, the Americans only need to play for time. 
The European system is based on refundable state advances which 
are considered to be direct subsidies and are perfectly 
identifiable. But they often exceed 5 percent of a new 
aircraft's development costs. In the United States, however, 
subsidies are channeled primarily through state agencies and are 
allocated as research contracts. Furthermore, the volume of 
orders placed by the U.S. Administration by far exceeds that of 
the two A310's placed by the French Air Force, and the United 
States has myriad "militarized" versions of civilian aircraft, 
with the most famous being the KC135 and EC135, both derived 
from the ancient Boeing 707. 
  For the Europeans, this challenge could not have come at a 
worse time. Aircraft manufacturers face a worldwide crisis in 
air transport, which has been driving orders down, as well as 
cuts in military budgets. Of course, in the latter case, 
manufacturers need not be concerned with general trade rules. 
However, it is worth noting that the order for three Rafale 
fighter aircraft to be funded from the 1993 budget has only 
recently been placed with the manufacturer. Moreover, the lack 
of multiyear programs excludes any potential economies of scale, 
with respect to supplies, for instance. Therefore one can 
understand easily the fears of the manufacturers, who are faced 
with the prospect of a sweeping implementation of trade 
agreements which are not suited to their field of activity. 
This explains their current lobbying activities in France and 
Germany, which are meant to raise government awareness and to 
request -- should the parties fail to reach an agreement -- the 
establishment of a subsidy system similar to the one used by the 
Americans.

<F P=106> [By Jan Kristiansen] </F>
  [Text] Paris, Feb 21 (AFP) -- The United States no longer 
wants a European to head the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is set to assume wider 
tasks in a changing world economy with Asians and Latin Americas 
among the major players, Paris-based diplomats say. 
  "We're headed for a political showdown with Washington," a 
European permanent representative to the OECD said. "Things will 
heat up over the next few months," another ambassador confirmed 
in private. 
  Several ranking diplomats at the OECD's Paris headquarters 
say the Americans are seeking to marshall support from Japan and 
other non-European member countries in favour of a former 
Canadian cabinet minister and politician, Donald Johnston, as 
the next OECD secretary-general. 
  Frenchman Jean-Claude Paye, aged 59, will see his second 
term 
in the post expire at the end of next September, but is seeking 
a third five-year term. 
  "The Americans do not shrink from reminding us in the 
corridors that the U.S. and Japan between them contribute nearly 
50 percent of the budget," a European official said, adding that 
Washington considers the OECD as "Euro-centric," although a fair 
share of the key jobs are held by U.S. and Japanese nationals. 
  Paye, who made it clear last July he would seek a third 
term, 
is France's official candidate. 
  British Prime Minister John Major has thrown his support 
behind Lord (Nigel) Lawson, a chancellor of the exchequer under 
his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, while Germany joined the fray 
naming senior Economics Ministry official Lorentz Schomerus as 
its candidate. 
  Belgium and Italy have also signalled possible candidacies, 
but have so far not cited any names. 
  The Americans, the British and some other OECD governments 
believe the OECD, which will not for long remain an "exclusive 
club" of rich industrial countries, will need a "political 
heavyweight" at the helm to raise its world-wide visibility. 
  Others believe their purposes will be better served by a 
non-political chief executive seeking to defend the collective 
cause of its 24 members. They want to preserve its "impartial 
analysis" of the whole range of current economic, social and 
technological problems. 
  Well-placed diplomats say the Clinton Administration appears 
to be taking a new interest in the organization, now perceived 
as a useful instrument for U.S. foreign policy and domestic 
economic objectives. 
  "The Americans believe, for instance, that the OECD could be 
used more effectively in their efforts to open up the Japanese 
market," a European ambassador commented. 
  A confidential OECD study on labour markets and ways to 
reverse the rise of OECD unemployment, which could touch 35 
million this year, is another case in point. 
  The study will be in focus at President Clinton's "jobs 
summit" at Detroit from March 13 to 15, officials said. 
  Washington has picked this domain to launch a campaign 
against Paye by leaking official U.S. documents critical of the 
OECD's views, European diplomats said. 
  U.S. Ambassador to the OECD David Aaron in a letter accused 
the OECD secretariat of failing to play a "positive" role in 
calling for lower interest rates and more growth in Europe as a 
remedy for run-away unemployment. 
  Rejecting U.S. charges of "Euro-centrism," several OECD 
ambassadors said the organization had indeed changed since Paye 
took the helm nearly 10 years ago. 
  They cited the opening in the 1980's of a "dialogue" with 
the 
dynamic Asian economies, now extended to emerging Latin American 
countries as well, and moves in the past four years to open up 
to the former communist states of East Europe, including Russia. 
  "It is evident that more changes are in the offing," one 
ranking European diplomat said. Three East European countries 
are knocking on the OECD's door, while Mexico is set to become 
its 25th member within a few months and Korea may follow suit 
around l996. 
  Whatever Paye's own record, the succession is an 
"excessively 
complex" issue because it is indirectly linked to the election 
of a new European Community Commission president, one ambassador 
said. 
  "The horse-trading is well under way," he added. 
  A "neutral" European official said the choice would be all 
the more difficult because Canada's Johnston was "hardly known 
in the outside world" and because some capitals would find it 
hard to accept Nigel Lawson, a "retired Thatcherite."

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 18 (AFP) -- The International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC) stepped up its campaign to have blinding 
laser weapons banned by international convention. 
  ICRC legal adviser Louise Doswald-Beck told a press 
conference that "civilisation would take a step backwards if it 
tolerated such weapons," which could blind a person irreversibly 
at a distance of one kilometre (1,000 yards). 
  In presenting the 300-page report, [written] by experts 
engaged by the ICRC since 1991, Beck said "the laser weapon is 
silent, its ray is invisible and its effect is instantaneous." 
  The ICRC wants the weapon banned when the 1980 Geneva 
Convention is reviewed at the end of this year. 
  Doswald-Beck said individual shoulder-fired laser weapons 
costing just $100 were already being tested in the United States 
and could go into production next year. 
  The British specialist magazine JANE'S DEFENCE WEEKLY 
revealed in 1990 that laser weapons were used by the Royal Navy 
against Argentine pilots during the 1982 Falkland War and could 
have caused the unexplained crash of three aircraft. 
  The ICRC also wants much tighter control on the use of 
anti-personnel mines which tend to kill more civilians than 
combatants.

unleashed by Indian forces in occupied Jammu and Kashmir. 
Speaking at the Commission's current session in Geneva, 
Pakistani delegate Mr. Shafqat Kakakhel accused India of 
misusing the right of state to protect their territorial 
integrity for justifying brutal repression against the 
population of Jammu and Kashmir, whose final status has to be 
determined in accordance with the wishes of the people of Jammu 
and Kashmir.

  [Text] India has urged the United Nations Human Rights 
Commission to avoid mutual recrimination and bring about an 
environment of trust and understanding. Speaking at the 50th 
session of the Commission in Geneva, the leader of the Indian 
delegation, Mr. Atal Behari Vajapayee, said the promotion and 
protection of human rights cannot be ensured through mutual 
recrimination, and far less through violence and terrorism. He 
said this was not the time for faultfinding in the name of 
fact-finding, and the issue of human rights must not be used for 
sectarian ends. Mr. Vajpayee assured the delegates that India 
has always worked in a spirit of openness and transparency. The 
efforts of the government is to create greater transparency 
regarding the actual situation of Jammu and Kashmir. Mr. 
Vajpayee said that setting up of an independent Human Rights 
Commission by India is an indication of the government's resolve 
to protect these rights. 
  Earlier, exercising the right to reply to Pakistan's 
allegations of human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, 
India asked the international community to declare Pakistan as a 
state sponsoring terrorism for its support to militants in Jammu 
and Kashmir. Miss Neelam Sabarwarl, who exercised the right to 
reply, rejected as baseless Islamabad's charges of human rights 
violations. She said Pakistan's sole objective is territorial 
expansion through violence and deception. The Indian delegates 
told the Commission that Jammu and Kashmir, like the rest of 
India, is a multireligious, multiethnic society in which Hindus, 
Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Christians have lived in harmony 
until Pakistan introduced religion-based separatism through its 
policy of sponsoring terrorism. During Nawaz Sharif's reign as 
Pakistani premier, the U.S. had placed Pakistan on its watchlist 
of states sponsoring terrorism, she added. The Indian delegation 
also drew the attention of the Human Rights Commission to 
Pakistan's dismal record on human rights. Miss Sabarwal said 
Pakistan has introduced a system in which its citizens are 
identified on the basis of their religion. She said this is 
nothing but religious apartheid at its worst. 
  Speaking before the Commission, an alternate leader of the 
Indian delegation, Ms. Justice Sujata Manohar, said that 
religious intolerance and extremism and use of religion-based 
terrorism for extraterritorial ambitions are the real threats to 
the enjoyment of human rights. She pointed out that the 
systematic religious extremism has led to the exodus of about 2 
and one-half lakh [250,000] non-Muslims and as many as 50,000 
Muslims from the valley. 
  An organization of the Kashmiri pundits [Hindu sect] told 
the 
Commission that the genocide and the cleansing of the minority 
community in the valley by Pakistani-sponsored terrorism has 
forced the exodus from their homeland. Presenting their case 
before the Commission, they said that the pundits are living the 
life of exile as their rights to live with dignity and honor in 
their homeland have been snatched away by terrorists.

  [Text] Pakistan has said at the Geneva-based UN Human

have condemned India for systematic and blatant human rights 
violations in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan's delegate Shafqat 
Kakakhel told the Commission that human rights groups and 
agencies have charged the Indian occupation forces with cold 
blooded murders, unjustified arrests, killing in custody, 
molestation of Kashmiri women, and acts of arson. In response 
to a statement by the Indian delegate, he said the Commission 
should send a fact-finding team to occupied Jammu and Kashmir to 
study the exact state of human rights violations there. He said 
this is the only way the international community can know and 
try to end atrocities being committed by the Indian forces in 
the Indian-held valley.

  [Text] New Delhi has made it clear that it will not allow 
GATT or any other global forum to review its priorities of 
development. The minister for environment, Mr. Kamalnath, says 
India is opposed to any absolute specifications for conservation 
of forests which are a community asset. Addressing a round 
table discussion organized by the UN Environment Program and 
UNCTAD [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development] in 
Geneva, he termed the efforts to put environmental barriers on 
trade as green imperialism. Mr. Kamalnath said any move for a 
global (?ecological) system amounts to legitimizing 
extraterritorial interference. He called for a moratorium on 
linking trade with the environment unless it impinges clearly on 
collective ecological security.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 22 (AFP) - The EC's executive 
Commission sent a letter to the Greek Government on Tuesday [22 
February], demanding an explanation for its recent trade embargo 
on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, EC officials said. 
  The Commission said it was very concerned about the step, 
which it argued went against European law. 
  Greece blocked access to its northern port of Salonika to 
its 
neighbouring state last week, accusing it of usurping the name 
Macedonia and having territorial designs on the northern Greek 
province of the same name. 
  Under EC law, the unilateral sanctions would be illegal 
unless Greece could prove the action was justified by a threat 
to public order and safety. 
  The Commission cited Article 169 of the European Union 
Treaty, which says that if the Commission feels a member state 
has not met its obligations, it has the right to issue a 
decision on the matter after asking the member state concerned 
to contribute its observations. 
  If the member state does not comply with the decision in the 
period specified by the Commission, the latter can have recourse 
to the European Court of Justice, according to the treaty.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Last-minute negotiations 
to bring Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the European 
Union [EU] faltered here Tuesday [22 February] because of 
disputes over money, farm prices, truck pollution and fish. 
  French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said there 
was "one chance in two" that the two sides would meet their 
March 1 deadline for completing the negotiations so that the 
candidates can join the Union next January 1. 
  Austria refused to accept EU demands that it shorten an 
11-year accord which restricts polluting truck traffic across 
the Austrian Alps and would contravene the Union's regulations 
on free movement. 
  The candidate countries gave a cool reception to a Brussels 
compromise whereby European Community funds would boost 
development in sparsely-populated Arctic areas but to a lesser 
extent than in poor areas in existing EC countries. 
  Finland and Norway protested that this was not good enough, 
since these areas would get 10 percent less than struggling 
regions of existing EC members despite the special problems of 
Arctic farmers. 
  "We are not pleased with the EC position on Nordic 
agriculture," Norway's Trade and Shipping Minister Grete 
Knudsen, told journalists. 
  Some EC countries, particularly Spain, opposed the 
applicants' pleading for special treatment and exemptions from 
the Union's trade and aid regulations. 
  The EC countries could not agree on demands from Spain and 
Portugal for access to Norway's fish-rich waters. France and 
Ireland insisted on curbs against imports of cheap Norwegian 
fish. 
  "Fish will occupy us right up to the end of negotiations 
unless the god of the sea, Poseidon, helps us and that would be 
a miracle," said Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros 
Pangalos, who is chairing the negotiations. 
  Brussels turned down Sweden's demand that it be allowed to 
gradually phase in annual payments of around 857 million dollars 
a year to the EU budget over five years, instead of being liable 
immediately on entering the Union. 
  All sides are pushing for maximum advantage as the year-long 
negotiations approach their climax at a marathon negotiating 
session next weekend, with the hardest issues still unresolved. 
  Finnish Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen was upbeat. 
"We have moved forward today quite considerably," he said. 
  But Austrian Transport Minister Viktor Klima warned that the 
talks could collapse if the EC insisted on loosening 
restrictions on trans-Alpine truck traffic through Austria in 
accordance with its rules on free movement. 
  He said the Austrian position had been strengthened by a 
referendum in Switzerland last Sunday where a majority of voters 
decided that all foreign truck traffic should be put on trains 
after 2004. 
  Pangalos suggested that the two sides might find a 
compromise 
date to terminate the trans-Alpine accord some time after 1997, 
the date suggested by the EC, but before it expires officially 
on December 31, 2003. 
  Austria, Finland and Norway all objected to Brussels' 
insistence that they lower their heavily-subsidised agricultural 
prices to EC levels in one fell swoop upon entering the Union. 
  The applicant countries are asking that the high prices, 
necessary to subsidise farmers in icy and low-yielding Arctic 
and Alpine regions, be phased out gradually, and that the EC 
help to compensate farmers for the change. 
  Austria and Finland announced one major concession. They 
agreed that any local restrictions on the purchase of holiday 
homes would have to be non-discriminatory, so that they apply to 
locals as well as foreigners.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Disputes over truck 
pollution and fish were dominating a European Union [EU] 
ministerial meeting here Monday [21 February] on negotiating 
terms to let four applicant countries into the EU, diplomats 
said. 
  The meeting stretched into the night as European Affairs 
ministers prepared for negotiations Tuesday with counterparts 
from the applicant countries -- Austria, Finland, Norway and 
Sweden. 
  Monday's meeting was dominated by Austria's attempts to curb 
polluting truck traffic over the Alps, and Spain's efforts to 
extract a high price for Norway's integration into EU fisheries 
affairs. 
  "We are not the ones doing the asking. The Union is warning 
that applicants must accept EU rules," Belgium's European 
Affairs Minister Robert Urbain said. 
  Hanging over the meeting was a decision by Swiss voters on 
Sunday that all truck traffic across the Swiss Alps must be 
switched to rail, for environmetal reasons. 
  Switzerland is not among the current applicants for EU 
membership, but diplomats pointed out that Austrians might 
follow the Swiss example by also taking a hardline environmental 
stand in the Austrian Alps. 
  Austria is insisting on maintaining strict limits on truck 
traffic across the Alps until 2004, seven years later than 
accepted by Brussels. 
  As a member of the EU, however, Austria would be expected to 
accept its fair share of the huge truck traffic flow across the 
EU's single market, which might be unacceptable to its voters. 
  The diplomats warned that the traffic flow across Austria 
could increase because of trucks diverted from Switzerland, 
adding fuel to the environmentalist anti-EU movement in Austria. 
  In the fish dispute, Spain was insisting at Monday's meeting 
that its fishing fleet, the biggest in the EU, be given access 
to Norway's fishing waters as part of a membership deal. 
  France and Ireland were also pushing for protection from 
cheap Norwegian fish exports. 
  And the EU countries were battling with another important 
consequence of taking Austria, Finland and Norway into the Union 
-- the need to cut their high agricultural prices down to EU 
levels. 
  Prices in these countries are inflated by hefty subsidies 
needed for the survival of farmers in harsh Arctic and Alpine 
conditions. 
  The two sides are split over how to cushion the effect of 
price equalisation, and the EU's demands that the applicant 
countries should bear the full cost. 
  Adding pressure to the negotiations is a deadline of 
February 
28 for finishing them so that the applicants can join the EU by 
January 1 next year. 
  The EU's Greek presidency has pencilled in February 25-28 
for 
a final four-day negotiating bid to reach agreement before March 
1.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Competition Commissioner Karel Van </F>
Miert by Jacques Docquiert and Jean-Michel Laney; place and date 
not given: "Van Miert: `We Do Not Have a View of Competition 
Limited To the Community Market'" -- first paragraph is LES 
ECHOS introduction] 
  [Text] The "boss" of competition in Brussels, Commissioner 
Karel Van Miert, explained in an interview with LES ECHOS that 
the single market remains structurally imbalanced and only an 
amendment of the treaty would make it possible to remedy the 
situation, especially in cases involving dumping. However, 
while he affirmed that the legal rules of competition must be 
strictly applied without being able to take account of other 
criteria, he also assured that the Commission -- a collegial 
body -- is able to assume its political responsibilities -- as 
the Vallourec affair proved. The only path for Bull and Air 
France is a drastic recovery plan, which often means significant 
cuts in capacity. More generally, he expressed his desire for a 
better world trade organization that integrated the requirement 
for competition, and deplored the handling of the GATT 
negotiations, which held back our strategic interests in 
industry. 
  [LES ECHOS] What inflection have you given to competition 
policy? What have you achieved, and what are your goals? 
  [Van Miert] I have tried to act pragmatically, without 
taking 
ideological sides. First of all, the very concept of 
"competition" had to be thrashed out and it also had to be a 
sound definition. Then it was possible to include other 
elements in so far as that was possible, but without endangering 
the coherence of demand: We must treat everyone the same. 
  For example, as regards state aid, we cannot say "yes" in 
one 
case and "no" in another comparable case. The hard thing is 
staying consistent while sticking to economic reality. 
  [LES ECHOS] Does that mean that there are new criteria that 
go beyond merely analyzing the competition? 
  [Van Miert] In the liquid crystals sector, we have 
authorized 
joint ventures between three large groups because this is a 
world market. Even from the competition point of view, this 
attitude was preferable: The question is knowing whether 
tomorrow there will be European companies that can measure up to 
the Japanese. We do not have a view strictly limited to the 
Community market. This is especially true in the 
telecommunications sector, or even in the aviation sector, where 
you have to look at what is happening outside the Community. 
  [LES ECHOS] Does that mean that you are introducing elements 
of social dumping with regard to wage costs? 
  [Van Miert] No. We can only apply the rules of the Single 
Act, in which, unfortunately, important elements of a situation 
in a given market are not all taken into account. When judging 
cases of state aid or competition, there is no minimum rule that 
must be complied with regarding wages. This is also true in the 
monetary sector. What are the rules when a country devalues its 
currency? In the area of taxation, social affairs, and monetary 
affairs, the game is not equal even within our single market. 
This is a structural defect. 
  [LES ECHOS] Do you think this must be corrected? 
  [Van Miert] It must be corrected because the game is 
partially biased. The Commission can only work within the 
framework of the treaty given to it. Sometimes our instruments 
are not enough. Let us take the steel sector: If you must pay 
state aid while at the same time obtaining unanimity, i.e., 
negotiate with governments that have a veto right, that is like 
a referee going up to a player on the field and asking him if he 
can give him a penalty. 
  [LES ECHOS] So, should a new treaty be negotiated? 
  [Van Miert] We must not be naive about a market. Everyone 
uses the texts and possibilities available to him. If a match 
is to be acceptable, everyone has to follow the same rules and 
there must be a referee capable of enforcing the rules. We are 
not there yet. 
  The single market is not balanced structurally. It can be 
modified either through Community legislation, or by amendments 
to the treaty. With monetary union, there will be the necessary 
provisions. Are there minimum rules for all those who use the 
social aspect to unravel other peoples' policies? That is the 
question. 
  [LES ECHOS] How do you analyze the French Government's 
attitude in the Bull matter? 
  [Van Miert] When I took over this file, France, as well as 
other countries, was in the midst of an election campaign. It 
is often difficult to take things into consideration. Generally 
speaking the Commission observes a certain amount of 
self-restraint. Once the new government was in place, I had 
very good meetings with Gerard Longuet, and I was pleased with 
that. We have a relationship based on mutual confidence. He 
thought he was in a position to send us a restructuring plan in 
good and due form before the summer vacation. As it turned out, 
that was not realistic. Then there was a change of management, 
and -- from one extension to the next -- Bull could no longer 
survive without another substantial injection of money. This is 
illegal. If there is "bailout" aid, the company can be financed 
during a period of time so that it will survive. But that was 
not allowed. "Normal" aid can only be given via the 
Commission's approval of a restructuring plan that organizes a 
return to profitability. It seems to me that we cannot doubt 
the French authorities' desire to do what it must to ensure that 
the company becomes viable and a candidate for privatization. 
However, to get out of the illegal situation, we quickly need a 
restructuring plan making it possible to judge the validity of 
the return to viability. In the meantime, there can no longer 
be any state aid. 
  [LES ECHOS] Can you specify what ensures that this will be a 
restructuring plan you feel is reliable? 
  [Van Miert] It is up to the French authorities to 
demonstrate 
this. It is not up to the Commission to impose a plan. 
  [LES ECHOS] But what are the criteria for it? 
  [Van Miert] The first criterion is that after a capital 
injection, there can no longer be any aid. This is the 
criterion we used for the airlines. One must be able to 
demonstrate that we can assume, in good faith, that this will be 
the case. In terms of a reduction in capacity, this means -- 
because normally our rules insist that there is a reduction in 
capacity even if it is not absolute -- that there must be proof 
that all the factors that made the company lose this incredible 
amount of money have been eliminated. 
  [LES ECHOS] You gave the French Government one month to 
submit a plan. It still has two weeks. 
  [Van Miert] The situation is clear. There can be no more 
capital injections or aid until the Commission has had a chance 
to decide on a restructuring plan. 
  [LES ECHOS] You are telling Bull that it has reached the 
maximum limit of money from which it can benefit. 
  [Van Miert] More than that...because an illegal situation 
now 
exists. 
  [LES ECHOS] Do you think there will be a quick decision 
about 
Air France? 
  [Van Miert] Air France CEO [chief executive officer] 
Christian Blanc said that there would be a plan in good and due 
form within a few weeks, as was the case with Sabena, Aer 
Lingus, and Iberia, all of which have already experienced 
similar operations. However, this sort of commitment is a last 
chance. It is a single operation. It can only be used once. 
Christian Blanc is aware of this. Here too, there must be a 
credible plan. 
  [LES ECHOS] As regards the recovery of Air France, do you 
think it would be legitimate to take into account the wage 
differences between British Airways and Air France? 
  [Van Miert] No, because we have no rule governing that. 
Nor can we do that within a single country. In Bremen, 
Germany, wages are roughly 55 percent what they are in 
Stuttgart. On the other hand, the Commission can take action in 
different ways. If we introduce a minimum level of rules in the 
social domain, we must first do what is necessary to ensure that 
they are complied with. If that is not the case, it would 
become unfair competition. 
  [LES ECHOS] A report to the "wise men" commissioned by the 
Commission suggests making plans for exceptional aid, especially 
if the aim of such aid is to privatize the company. 
  [Van Miert] That is the opinion of the wise men. The 
Commission cannot become mixed up in a debate on whether or not 
we should privatize, since that is the domain of the national 
authorities. However, it is true that if the national 
authorities want to privatize, as is the case with Bull, then 
that is a sign of the seriousness of their desire to reorganize 
the company. The significance of this is not lost on the 
Commission -- quite the opposite. But it is not up to us to 
demand this. 
  [LES ECHOS] In a recent case, the Vallourec matter, we had 
the impression that you were disowned by the Commission since 
you were in favor of banning the merger, while in the end the 
Commission decided to authorize it. 
  [Van Miert] There were eight in favor, eight against, and 
one 
abstention. So just one vote was needed. As for the analysis 
itself, I was in no way disowned. On the contrary, it is in the 
decision. However, there was a difference of opinion regarding 
the "threat" of East Europe. Certain colleagues said: "They 
will be ready pretty soon and will therefore be serious 
competitors," while our analysis did not confirm this opinion in 
the foreseeable future. The differences of opinion had their 
roots in that. 
  [LES ECHOS] As for the announced sanctions against the steel 
sector, is there not too big an economic gap between the period 
of events aimed at and the immediate economic reality? 
  [Van Miert] The Commission is not at liberty to close its 
eyes for reasons of circumstance. This infraction should be 
separated from the current handling of the steel crisis. If we 
had to approach things differently, the time would never be 
right. The examination procedure is long and complex. The 
proven facts are very serious. Incidentally, the steel sector 
has benefitted from a certain amount of leniency. As for the 
fines, payment can be spread over a period of five years. 
  [LES ECHOS] What future do you see for state monopolies, 
especially in the telecommunications sector? 
  [Van Miert] As regards antitrust legislation, we must take 
action to create the most normal market conditions. With 
telecommunications, the goal is deregulate local telephone 
communications for the vast majority of the member states 
(except for Ireland and Portugal, which have been granted an 
extra extension) beginning 1 January 1998. Infrastructure is 
another problem, and one which remains to be discussed. 
However, here too, in several member states things are moving 
very quickly. There is going to be a second telecommunications 
firm in Germany. So why in Belgium should Belgacom still be 
able to maintain a monopoly? The very foundation of the 
monopoly has been eroded. The political elements are in place 
to accompany this development in the telecommunications sector, 
except as regards infrastructure. There will be a Community 
market and, for certain services, a world market. 
  [LES ECHOS] Can the same reasoning be used for the import or 
export of electricity? 
  [Van Miert] In a single market, it is clear that monopolies 
on the import and export of energy between the member states do 
not correspond to the fundamental principle. Increasingly, 
there are complaints where it is hard to say that the applicants 
are wrong. Thus, a company set up in the Netherlands must pay a 
lot more for its electricity than on the other side of the 
border. 
  [LES ECHOS] Are you prepared to have the notion of the 
public 
utility included in the jurisprudence? 
  [Van Miert] Definitely. I have no problem with that. In any 
case, even in the event of privatization, we must be able to 
maintain the concept of universal service. None of that is in 
question. There must be a gateway between the state monopoly 
and universal service. The situation is evolving for 
electricity because the French Government is prepared to review 
its positions. 
  [LES ECHOS] How do you judge the GATT negotiations? 
  [Van Miert] I was greatly in favor of the cultural 
exception. 
That is also a lesson for the French, because it must be 
understood that there are other cultures in Europe that are 
defending themselves against the others. However, in more 
general terms, I regret the fact we got wrapped up in 
agriculture because it prevented us from doing a better job of 
deciding what is the strongest industrial strategy for the 
future. The negotiations were hemmed in by agriculture and 
culture. Our strategic interests were not given concrete form 
in sectors where exports can be maximized. We accepted because 
we were cornered. There was a response concerning tariffs, but 
there was none at all in many other areas, such as the 
environment or the social domain, or even in the behavior of 
countries like Japan where it is difficult to gain access to the 
market in a number of sectors -- not because of tariffs or 
legislation, but because of the behavior of a sector or a lack 
of competition policy. Even if they have legislation in this 
area, it is not enforced. We should now side with the Americans 
against the Japanese. The game must be balanced sufficiently at 
world level, with a degree of openness that is measured not 
merely in terms of tariffs, but also in terms of other 
obstacles. For the time being, nobody is obliged to have a 
competition policy, so let us at least discuss that.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Hans Rauscher </F>
and Christoph Kotanko; place and date not given: "It Is Not Yet 
Over"] 
  [Text] [KURIER] What are the chances that we will have 
successfully concluded the negotiations for European Union [EU] 
membership by the end of February or the beginning of March? 
  [Mock] The negotiations are not yet over at all. On 2 March 
we will know, but until then, we have to use the time to brief 
our various friends on our position. 
  [KURIER] What is expected for the big concluding event at 
the end of February; what will be the main issues? 
  [Mock] Some agricultural issues.... The closer we come to 
the conclusion of negotiations, the more political the decisions 
will become. There will be some issues referring to 
agriculture; there may also be questions, for example, relating 
to the European Union conflict regarding the monetary union -- 
this is the business of the European Union in Spain. I do not 
think there should be first and second-class members, but this 
should not be the issue that makes the negotiations fail. 
  [KURIER] One must assume that the European Union also needs 
a success and cannot afford a failure of the negotiations. 
  [Mock] I think this is correct. There is certainly a lot of 
political will on both sides. 
  [KURIER] We do not have any great leeway for negotiations 
regarding transit traffic. Minister Klima has summarized the 
positions, which he does not want to give up in any case: 
duration, 38-tonne limit for trucks, etc. What kind of leeway 
for negotiations does Austria have in this connection? 
  [Mock] The areas are very much linked to one another, with 
traffic policy, with the transit issue, with the budget 
problems, with agricultural policy.... If one person is 
satisfied, then the other one will be less satisfied. However, 
we must avoid that the benefit that the entire state derives 
from EU membership is achieved at the cost of individuals -- for 
instance, the farmers. The European Union must also see that in 
this way. 
  [KURIER] If the transit treaty is giving up, then one can 
forget the diet elections in Tirol and Salzburg. 
  [Mock] The issue of transit traffic has a high symbolic 
value and great importance regarding its contents and plays a 
real pioneering role in Europe.... I assume that we have a 
number of allies in this respect. If you read the 
transportation concept of the European Union today, you have the 
ecological criteria anchored in a way that would have been 
ridiculed eight years ago. 
  [KURIER] The negotiations must be concluded by 1 March. 
There will not be any additional negotiations. We will not go 
beyond the diet elections in mid-March? 
  [Mock] No, certainly not. The essential issues must be 
concluded by 1 March. However, it would be harmful to interrupt 
negotiations. When things work, one should stay with them -- if 
necessary, until 0600. 
  [KURIER] You have repeatedly said that, if this is not 
achieved, an "open window" might be closed again. How dramatic 
is that in reality? What are the dangers if Austria does not 
manage to join the European Union on 1 January 1995? 
  [Mock] The risk is great because one cannot predict it 
exactly. At best, it would be that the negotiations will be 
resumed in two or three years. The main danger lies in the 
political situation. The European political climate of 
integration has not been what it used to be for decades. The 
pressure from the East has disappeared. If we do not get in 
now, by the time we try again, those in the European Union might 
have gained ground who think that it is better to first "deepen" 
the European Union instead of expanding it. Then there will be 
even more who say this. 
  [KURIER] Mrs. Schaumayer, the president of the Austrian 
National Bank, said that if it should not work, Austria would 
become an "Albania." Can you tell us in three or four sentences 
what the negative effects will be if we are not admitted into 
the European Union. 
  [Mock] There will be a lot of negative effects. Investments 
will decrease, some people will leave with their companies. The 
opportunities for the people will get generally worse. We will 
have to take over and obey a lot of issues that are decided 
elsewhere without us having an opportunity to have our say. We 
will become second-class Europeans. We will have to be 3-5 
percent cheaper to hold our own in competition. We will have to 
make sacrifices in modernization, in income, in the social 
sphere, etc. Furthermore, one should not underestimate the 
effect of standing politically in a corner. 
  [KURIER] It is said that Austria should join the European 
Union just for security considerations. Others say that if this 
is so, it would be better to be neutral again and come to an 
arrangement with the Russians. 
  [Mock] Security today means being integrated with others 
that have the same goal. One should not have any illusions that 
we are so far away from anywhere. Anyone who would have 
predicted 10 years ago what is happening in Yugoslavia now would 
have been told that he had a sick imagination. 
  The argument of neutrality is based on an enormous 
misconception. In neutrality we found a means, but it was never 
tested. It was a unique stroke of luck, not a guarantee. And 
then, one must know where it did not pay off, where it did not 
work: in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg.... 
  However, I believe that a healthy state always looks for 
those instruments that offer the maximum in security.

<F P=106> [Report by Gisela Hopfmueller] </F>
  [Text] In a first reaction to the Swiss decision [to block 
truck transit across Switzerland by road], Transport Minister 
Viktor Klima said that this gives Austria support in the 
negotiations with the European Union [EU]. Is this really the 
case? Might this not make negotiations more difficult, because 
the EU will be all the more careful to find transit routes for 
its trucks? Minister Klima said: 
  [Begin Viktor Klima recording] I think that we can now 
expect more understanding in Brussels. We can only achieve a 
positive result in the referendum [on EU membership] if we 
manage to keep the transit agreement. This is the positive 
thing about it. I agree, however, that there might be some 
shortsighted people who say: We will now need a thoroughfare 
through the Alps, and we want to use Austria for this. It will, 
therefore, be very important to stick to our clear position. 
  [Hopfmueller] Will it be sufficient for us to insist on 
keeping the transit agreement? Let me give an example: The 
transit agreement will expire in 2004. But 2004 is also the 
year the Swiss completely ban transit trucks from their roads. 
This means that trucks that are no longer allowed to pass 
through Switzerland might go via Austria because the 
restrictions of the transit agreement are no longer there. 
  [Klima] The year 2004 is not the result of a poker game 
where we can trade or change around, but it is a result of 
measures we have to take. Measures to further develop the 
railroad infrastructure, to strengthen combined transport. Once 
we have taken these measures -- and we have envisaged to 
complete them by 1994 -- we can be sure that the transport 
policy will have been adjusted in such a way that the 
infrastructure, that is the railroads, will be used. I am sure 
that if we really implement these measures we will get more 
transport onto the railroads and will thus reduce the road 
transit problem. Switzerland is taking a similar course. [end 
recording] 
  Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek, Austrian People's Party [OeVP] 
chairman, adds: 
  [Begin recording Busek] For me, and for the OeVP, this means 
that extending the railroad system in the Alps must have 
absolute priority. We must find a solution that involves 
building tracks underground, using noise-reduction technologies. 
I think we will have to win over the EU to participate in this 
solution. There is no doubt that this will be easier from the 
inside than from the outside. The question has been asked 
whether this will make the situation for Austria easier or more 
difficult. I think that our standpoint is now clearer for the 
EU; but things have certainly not gotten any easier. What is 
needed now is action. [end recording] 
  Some time ago, the Swiss voted against the European Economic 
Area. Now they are saying no to truck transit. This means that 
the Swiss rate European integration quite differently from the 
Austrian Government. Chancellor Vranitzky said on possible 
effects: 
  [Begin recording Chancellor Franz Vranitzky] You cannot 
compare any two countries. Switzerland has had international 
relations much longer than Austria. There is hardly any Swiss 
company that does not have strong international contacts. This 
brought Switzerland many advantages in the past. As you will 
know, Switzerland will be facing a number of very difficult 
challenges if it chooses to stay away from the European 
integration process. I talked to Swiss Government members this 
morning because I was interested in knowing how they interpret 
this matter. They voiced concern that international cooperation 
might get more difficult for Switzerland following this 
attitude, because international cooperation does not only 
consist of international transport, but there are many other 
things involved. As you will also know, Switzerland has 
concluded a transit agreement with the EU, which will lose its 
basis in the future. Switzerland is thus facing important 
negotiations with the EU although it is not a member and has not 
yet decided in favor of joining. 
  [Hopfmueller] Following this Swiss decision, do you fear a 
psychological effect on Austria regarding the EU referendum that 
will be held in Austria sometime in the future? 
  [Vranitzky] We made great efforts negotiating the transit 
agreement with the EU three years ago. In the meantime, the 
importance of this agreement has increased a great deal. It is 
undisputed now, and many people are attaching great importance 
to maintaining it. I think that maintaining the agreement will 
be our foremost aim in the EU negotiations, and I think that 
what you call a possible psychological effect must be seen 
against this background. 
  [Hopfmueller] All negotiations, including those with the EU, 
are a kind of poker game. Can keeping tough in transit not mean 
giving in, say in agriculture? 
  [Vranitzky] I do not see such a link at the moment. We have 
clear standpoints in both transit and agricultural policy, and 
we will clearly advocate them. [end recording]

  [Text] On Thursday [17 February] in Brussels the presidents 
of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, the government, and 
the King signed the new constitutional text, drawn up in the 
wake of the latest institutional changes. 
  This text is a more readable, coordinated, and renumbered 
version of the old constitutional texts and includes the changes 
introduced by the St. Michel agreements. It was adopted 
definitively by the Senate on 3 February and issued in a special 
edition of the MONITEUR, published yesterday afternoon. Liberal 
MPs, both French-speaking and Flemish-speaking, did not take 
part in the ceremonies surrounding the signature of the new text. 
  For the PRL [Republican Party of Liberty]-FDF [Radical 
Liberal Party--Democratic Front of Brussels French speakers] 
Federation, yesterday was a "black day for Belgium and a day of 
mourning for French speakers." Their MPs point out in 
particular that, in their eyes, the new institutions will 
encourage the separatist current in Flanders and organize the 
division of the French speakers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Arms for FIS Via Antwerp?"] </F>
  [Text] Antwerp -- An Algerian freighter, which recently put 
into port in Algiers with a cargo of arms on board, spent a few 
days last month in the port of Antwerp. In reaction to reports 
in the Algerian press that the weapons were possibly loaded in 
Antwerp, sources at the port confirmed yesterday evening that 
the 5,331-tonne El Djorf called at Antwerp on 14 January en 
route from Hamburg and left on 20 January. 
  The Algerian press agency, APS, had reported -- citing 
newspapers in Algiers -- that automatic guns, shotguns, and 
ammunition were found on board and were were presumably destined 
for extremist Muslims in the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]. 
Several crew members were detained. 
  According to those arrested, the weapons were "accidentally" 
loaded in Antwerp instead of Hamburg. According to the Algerian 
Government, Germany has become the crossroads for arms smuggling 
from Iranian and Pakistani organizations to Muslim extremists. 
There are currently a number of FIS leaders in Germany, 
including spokesman Rabah Kebir, as well as Okba, Salman, and

<F P=106> [Report signed "G. Dz": "Two Winners: VLD And Extreme </F>
Right"] 
  [Text] LA LIBRE BELGIQUE-Marketing Unit has released the 
results of the first large opinion poll organized for 12 June 
European Parliament [EP] elections. The exclusive survey covered 
2,000 Belgians, 1,000 from each language community). It gives 
an early indication that the elections will also (and above 
all?) function as a test the national government and its 
majority. The voting intentions follow the trends revealed by 
our last "parliamentary" poll at the end of the December. 
<H5>  The CVP and PS Are Losing Ground </H5>
  Four months from the elections, a comparison of voting 
intentions with the 1989 results reveals that two winners are 
making significant gains: The first are the Flemish Liberals of 
the "new" VLD [Flemish Liberals and Democrats], who gained no 
less than 10 points to 27.1 percent. The extreme right is the 
other winner. The VB [Flemish Bloc] has broken through the 
10-percent barrier among Dutch speakers (10.8 percent compared 
with 6.6 percent five years ago) while the National Front and 
comparable parties have 5.2 percent among French speakers. On 
the Flemish side, the extremist advance has been at the expense 
of the VU [People's Union], which is in the process of 
disappearing. The Liberal votes have almost all been taken from 
the CVP [Christian People's Party], which has dropped 10 percent 
(24.1 percent compared with 34.1 percent). 
  Among French speakers the PS [French-speaking Socialist 
Party] is the big loser, under the influence of "scandals" and 
governmental participation (a loss of 7.4 percent to 30.7 
percent). The poll was conducted between 7 and 15 February. 
Arithmetically, the PS's votes could be going to the extreme 
right, since Ecolo [French-speaking Greens] (17.2 percent, a 
0.6-percent gain) and the PSC [Social- Christian Party] (21.8 
percent, a 0.5-percent gain) are stable and the new PRL-FDF 
[Radical Liberal Party-Democratic Front of Brussels French 
speakers] alliance has achieved critical success only (with 23.9 
percent, a 1.2-percent gain from their combined votes in 1989). 
<H5>  Happart and Tindemans Lose Ground </H5>
  Our poll also covered some leading politicians who are 
taking 
part in the elections. The leading candidates of the PS and CVP 
are losing ground: Jose Happart would lose 88,000 preference 
votes and Leo Tindemans would lose 223,000 preference votes 
(however, he has Wilfried Martens as his alternate candidate). 
Also to be noted is the rise of the VLD's Annemie Neyts (she 
leads Flanders' preference votes), the PSC's Gerard Deprez, the 
SP's Freddy Willockx and Antoinette Spaak and Jean Gol of the 
FDF-PRL (the latter is second among French-speaking candidates, 
in front of his PSC rival).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kooijmans Supports Macedonian </F>
Colleague Regarding Embargo"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hague -- Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo 
Crvenkovski and his Netherlands counterpart, Pieter Kooijmans, 
agreed that the trade embargo imposed on Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] by Greece last week is 
outrageous. The two ministers consider the Greek move to be 
both politically reprehensible and in contravention of Community 
law within the European Union. This was learned Monday [21 
February] during an official visit to The Hague by the FYROM 
minister. 
  The Netherlands is the first member state of the European 
Union to receive a member of the FYROM Government on an official 
visit. The FYROM is appreciative of the Dutch support it 
received in connection with rescheduling its debt with the World 
Bank. 
  During the meeting with Minister Kooijmans, Crvenkovski 
emphasized that his government is prepared to resume 
negotiations with Greece aimed at eliminating contentious 
issues, such as the name and flag of the FYROM. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to a spokesman at the Foreign Ministry, Kooijmans 
and Crvenkovski also exchanged views on the situation of the 
Albanian minority in the FYROM, and on the guarantees of 
equality for all inhabitants of the FYROM which are enshrined in 
the [country's] constitution. 
  Crvenkovski thanked Kooijmans for his support for Skopje's 
attempt to gain admission to the CSCE. Until now, the admission 
of the FYROM has been blocked by both Greece and Albania.

<F P=106> [Jan Keulen report: "PLO Leader Calls For Lubbers's Aid in </F>
Peace Process"] 
  [Text] Wassenaar -- The peace process in the Middle East 
has to be saved. That is not just the responsibility of Israel 
and the Palestinians, but of the whole international community. 
That was the message of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat during a 
visit to The Hague on Friday [18 February]. 
  Prime Minister Lubbers was therefore requested amicably but 
urgently by 'Arafat to offer a helping hand, although it 
remained open what the Netherlands -- or the European -- role in 
the Middle East should be. Accordingly it was also important 
for 'Arafat, under the spotlight of the international press, to 
meet his "friend and brother" Nelson Mandela. 
  "Rabin always repeats that no date is sacred," an indignant 
'Arafat said in a sober room of De Wittenburg, a castle in 
Wassenaar. "What does he mean no sacred dates? Haven't we 
signed an agreement?" 
  "We have the United States and Russia as witnesses, 
President 
Clinton gave his blessing, the whole international community is 
behind the agreement," 'Arafat said. "It is not just an 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement, it is an international agreement." 
  'Arafat made it clear that as far as he was concerned there 
was a sacred date -- 13 April, when the Israeli Army is supposed 
to have withdrawn from Gaza and Jericho under the literal text 
of the agreement in principle. Therefore both parties would 
have to reach agreement in a month. Was it likely? "I hope 
so," he said. "If there is no agreement, then the peace is in 
danger." 
  The PLO leader said that it would not be his fault if no 
agreement was reached. "I did my best in my three meetings with 
Prime Minister Peres," he said. "It was clear to everyone that 
the Palestinians were adopting a positive attitude. We took 
courageous decisions. Now the other side has to prove that 
peace is wanted. If not, then the peace process will lose its 
credibility." 
  The "courageous decisions" referred to by 'Arafat are the 
concessions from the Palestinian side, including such areas as 
the border passages with Jordan and Egypt, which will continue 
to be checked by Israel, the extensive powers which the Israeli 
Army will keep in Gaza and the limited size of the Jericho 
enclave. The concessions have earned 'Arafat the usual 
criticisms in Palestinian circles and therefore it is high time 
that Israel makes gestures. 
  The release of Palestinian prisoners could be such a 
gesture. 
'Arafat made it clear that he had received promises that some 
prisoners would be released during Ramadan, the Islamic month of 
fasting now taking place. Does this include the prisoners who 
were held because they used violence? "Both parties committed 
crimes," he said. "Many Palestinians were murdered, do not 
forget that. But peace means peace. For both peoples. For our 
children and their children. We cannot make a final agreement 
without having a guarantee that all our prisoners will be 
released." 
  The growing opposition in the occupied territories to 
'Arafat's policies -- from the Islamic Hamas, pro-Syrian 
organizations and even in his own Fatah movement -- led to a 
rumor that the PLO leader would not be so fussy about his 
promise to organize elections this year for the administrative 
council in the future autonomous area. Could the PLO leader 
guarantee that the Palestinian elections would be held? 
  "We are already busy preparing for the elections," he said. 
"Three months ago I signed a decree for the establishment of a 
special committee. We agreed on elections in Washington, that 
is settled." And what would happen if Hamas or a coalition of 
opposition groups won the elections? "That is democracy," he 
said. "Are you against that? We are proud of our democracy." 
  Was Hamas a threat to the peace process? "No one can hold 
back history," 'Arafat said, adding neatly that Hamas had 
already asked to take part in the elections. 
  However, things have not yet reached that stage and on 
Friday 
'Arafat was mainly preoccupied with gaining international 
support. ANC [African National Congress of South Africa] Leader 
Mandela promised to visit him in Jericho before visiting Israel. 
"We have a very close relationship," 'Arafat said. "We are 
fighting the same struggle for peace, in South Africa and the 
Middle East." 
  But the PLO leader's talks with Economic Affairs State 
Secretary Van Rooy and a group of Netherlands business people 
were the most concrete discussions. They covered not only 
Gaza's harbor, but also cooperation in agriculture, road and 
house building and tourism. It was decided to establish a 
Netherlands-Palestinian business council.

  [Text] Amsterdam, Feb 18 (AFP) -- Threats from the 
conservative Freedom Alliance to boycott South Africa's first 
multi-racial elections and go to war should not be given too 
much weight, ANC leader Nelson Mandela said on Friday [18 
February]. 
  Mandela, speaking to journalists at the end of a two-day 
visit to the Netherlands, said the threats of violence from 
black and white parties in the Alliance were greatly 
exaggerated, and it was not in a position to go to war. 
  The African National Congress leader said: "We must not 
exaggerate the importance of the organisations in the Freedom 
Alliance. We don't even think that they have the capacity to 
conduct a civil war." 
  He did not believe the boycott threat was final, but even if 
it was carried out it would not stop the election process. 
  A series of meetings were held Friday in Johannesburg by 
both 
the ANC and the government to try to convince the Freedom 
Alliance to accept a last-minute compromise package and join the 
April 26 to 28 election. 
  The package is set to be approved by a recalled multi-party 
forum on Monday, before going to a special sitting of 
parliament, probably in early March, to be passed into law.

  [Text] ANC [African National Congress] leader Nelson 
Mandela says he still hopes that an election boycott by the 
Freedom Alliance can be averted. Mr. Mandela also said he was 
convinced there would be free and fair political campaigning 
throughout South Africa. He was speaking in Amsterdam at the 
conclusion of his visit to the Netherlands. 
  [Begin recording] [correspondent Cliff Saunders] This Mr. 
Mandela and Mr. Carl Niehaus emphasized -- that every effort 
would be made to ensure that democratic, free, and fair 
elections were indeed held in South Africa. Disruption and 
intimidation would not be tolerated. 
  [Niehaus] Every citizen of this country must have the 
freedom 
to participate in these elections, and we will convey that 
message very loud and clear through our negotiations with all 
the different parties. 
  [Saunders] Asked about the competence of the peacekeeping 
force, Mr. Mandela expressed full confidence in the abilities of 
General Ramushwana to handle the problems presented by different 
ethnic groups coming together. 
  [Mandela] The problems -- the teething problems -- that have 
manifested themselves -- I think he has handled them with great 
confidence. 
  [Saunders] Mr. Mandela said he intended visiting Israel once 
a settlement had been achieved there, and he referred to the 
meeting he had with Mr. Yasir 'Arafat in the Netherlands 
yesterday. 
  [Mandela] We have similar standpoints and similar aims. Both 
of us are freedom fighters. Both of us believe in the peaceful 
resolution of mutual problems, and I came here also to inform 
him of what efforts we are doing in our country and the progress 
that has been made. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Thijs Woltgens, parliamentary leader of the </F>
PvdA [Labor Party], by John Kroon and Kees Verstheeg; place and 
date not given: "We Must Remain the Party of a Fair Deal for 
All"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Woltgens] "Among the CDA 
[Christian Democratic Appeal] it is already been decided, for 
example, that pensions will remain frozen over the next four 
years, regardless of any changes in wages. They therefore want 
the pensioners to pay for the cost of unemployment. A major 
difference compared to us is that we want to maintain the law on 
the link between wages and benefits. If employment grows again, 
benefits and pensions can again follow wages. And if employment 
does not grow enough, we will, as has been the case for the last 
three years, employ other instruments to ensure that people on a 
minimum income -- and thus also pensioners -- can continue to 
keep in step with general trends in wages." 
  "We have had a lot of crisis-like situations on this point. 
We have taken a lot of criticism for this. It was a big 
struggle every time in cabinet and it nearly tripped us up. In 
hindsight, I am very pleased that we did this. We do not just 
promise to do such things, we have shown that we actually do 
them." 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] But the Central Plan Bureau forecasts that 
unemployment will grow so quickly the wage-benefit link will not 
be possible over the next four years. The CDA is simply drawing 
the consequences from this. 
  [Woltgens] We have drawn up an election program in order to 
ensure that such forecasts are not proved correct. The CDA 
apparently does not believe in its own program which promises 
jobs but states in advance that unemployment will increase so 
much that people will not be able to count on benefits. Our aim 
is for employment to increase more than would be the case if 
policy remained unchanged. We hope to be creating 100,000 jobs 
a year as soon as possible. During the early years of this 
government we achieved this number at a time when economic 
growth which was lower than that forecast. Why can this not 
happen again ? 
  [NRC HANDELSBAD] Are you not being too optimistic which 
means 
that soon -- just as previously with the Law on Labor Disability 
-- painful decisions will once again have to be taken ? 
  [Woltgens] No political party -- including us -- is going to 
promise that purchasing power will remain the same. But you can 
say that you will spread job opportunities equally over all 
income groups. That is our point of departure, it is not that 
of the CDA. 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Your party leader, Kok, wants to take more 
from the middle and higher income groups in order to continue to 
fund pensions. Is that not the traditional response of the 
PvdA, placing the burden on the strongest shoulders, while at 
the same time attractiing middle income groups? 
  [Woltgens] It is a very traditional reaction and one which 
must be maintained. But for the time being the crux of our 
approach to funding pensions is that the contributing base must 
be widened by increasing the number of people in employment. If 
we achieve this, the contribution can remain within the limits. 
  We must remain the party of a fair deal. That is why we were 
founded. Where does this lead? To what we have tried over 
recent years, an evenly distributed growth in earnings. Not a 
leveling of earnings, as was formerly the aim, but no widening 
of the differences either. 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Your point of departure is always growing 
employment. Last Saturday in the NRC HANDELSBLAD your fellow 
party members -- Van der Zwan and Geelhied -- made a couple of 
recommendations in this connection, such as the formation of a 
national elite in order to convince the people of the need for a 
change. Do you agree with them? 
  [Woltgens] Did you hear any concrete proposal from them? I 
understood that the elite would have the power to decide but 
what would this elite actually do? There is a certain menace in 
their words, but I don't see any practical proposals. I would 
like to know -- before we transfer power to this small group -- 
exactly what it is that they intend to do with it. 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Don't you take their analyses seriously? 
  [Woltgens] I can understand the sense of urgency of Timmer, 
the head of Phillips, as his company must remain competitive 
with countries in East Asia, although one may wonder as to 
whether his tales of such a threat are not rather late. Japan 
has been present on the world stage since 1905. 
  On the other hand, there is not going to be any 
international 
change, certainly not in the industrial pattern. We learned 
from the RSV [shipbuilding company that went bankrupt] affair 
that you cannot retain sectors which you must constantly 
subsidize. Market gardening cannot be kept alive with veiled 
subsidies in the form of lower gas prices. Not without reason 
some will move to regions where the sun provides free energy, to 
Morocco for example. I was therefore very surprised to hear 
Lubbers say this week in Bleiswijk that gas prices for market 
gardening could be reduced. 
  Nobody can imagine that we can compete with wage costs in 
countries such as China. I was in China this year and noticed 
that the Chinese are in turn getting worried about competition 
from Vietnam. Between these two there is certainly a 
two-percent difference in labor costs for bicycle bells. We 
must concentrate on areas where we are in a better position, due 
to our location, training and experience. 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Does the desire for a new, common 
challenge 
appeal to you? 
  [Woltgens] I am totally in favor of such a common goal but 
one which helps us return to full employment as quickly as 
possible. Everybody must concentrate on this. Our living 
standard, which was the focus of attention at last Saturday's 
meeting, and relative social equality are things to be proud of, 
although here and there we find the threat of dangerous ghetto 
situations developing. But the way in which we have organized 
our economy, the social cohesion and the limited number of 
strikes is just one of our comparative advantages. It is just 
eighteen months ago since people like Paul Kennedy and Lester 
Thurow offered up Europe as an example to the world economy. 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] But since then our unemployment has 
increased, especially among lower income groups. 
  [Woltgens] That is true, but since 1989 we have seen the 
significant phenomenon that unemployment among those most 
difficult to reintegrate, the long-term unemployed, decrease by 
100,000. That is a quiet revolution. 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] So it appears, but in fact the Netherlands 
has just included the long-term unemployed under the Law on 
Labor Disability figures. 
  [Woltgens] That was true for the 1970s and 1980s, but not 
for 
recent years. The Law on Labor Disability system has changed so 
much that this is not so easy any more. 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] The opinion polls do not indicate that the 
PvdA's message --- aimed at the lower income groups as is the 
case with the pension issue -- is getting across to the voter. 
  [Woltgens] I am not in principle a great believer in opinion 
polls, which spares me from becoming annoyed, but I have the 
feeling that we have bottomed. And we still have a whole 
campaign before us.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "PvdA Wants Further Cuts of 400 </F>
Million To Create 35,000 New Jobs"] 
  [Text] In its election platform, the PvdA [Netherlands 
Labor Party] wants to make extra cuts of 400 million guilders to 
benefit the long-term unemployed. The [party's] primary aims 
are to create part-time jobs in the health care sector and to 
combat crime. PvdA leader Kok intends to find this sum by 
restructuring the national budget. 
  The PvdA is thereby boosting its commitment to combat 
long-term unemployment by increasing the funds earmarked for 
this purpose from 1 to 1.4 billion guilders. During the 
upcoming legislative period, [the party believes that] 35,000 
additional jobs must be created for the long-term unemployed. 
However, yesterday, at the presentation of the PvdA platform, 
entitled "Samen aan het Werk" [Together at Work], Kok was unable 
to stipulate the budget lines along which cuts will be made. 
People within the party are reckoning on extra cuts being made 
in subsidies through applying priciples of profit, fighting 
against fraud, and paying greater attention to implementing the 
social security system more efficiently. 
  With this platform, the PvdA wants to force national and 
local PvdA leaders to commit themselves over the next four years 
to enhancing efforts made to help the long-term unemployed get 
back to work. "An increasing number of people are out of work, 
while there is so much moonlighting being done. We must come to 
better grips with this," said Kok. The primary concerns include 
the financing, organization, and streamlining of rules and 
regulations. Kok maintains that there must be "greater 
flexibility regarding how allowances are used." The PvdA 
believes people receiving an allowance must be able to do 
"socially useful work." According to State Secretary H. Simons, 
the PvdA's leading candidate in Rotterdam, "obstacles to a 
higher levels of employment must be cleared away." Like Kok, he 
too believes that "social decline" can be combated by getting 
"people who were squeezed out of work some time ago" back to 
work. 
  Just a few weeks ago, the PvdA announced that no further 
cuts 
were necessary.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Labor Party MP Jan van Zijl: "There Is </F>
Really Something To Choose on 3 May"] 
  [Text] In the coming cabinet period the PvdA [Labor Party] 
intends to assess from year to year whether AOW [Law on Old Age 
Pensions] and social security levels can develop in line with 
salary levels. Just how far this is possible will be determined 
by how employment develops. 
  This position can be found in our old and new election 
program and has also been enshrined in law for some time. There 
is no intention of changing it in any way. For this reason we 
reject the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] position of 
announcing in advance, regardless of economic developments, a 
four-year freeze for the AOW, social security, and salaries of 
civil servants, teachers, and health care workers. 
  In our election program we have not chosen the easiest way: 
We promise no pots of gold, nor do we promise the maintenance 
of purchasing power nor a permanent and full linkage between AOW 
and wage levels. The PvdA only promises that the purchasing 
power of AOW pensioners will not fall behind the purchasing 
power of those earning (higher) incomes, regardless of whether 
or not the link between AOW and wages is applied. 
<H5>  Positive Message </H5>
  Perhaps it would be easier to call for the AOW to follow 
wage 
levels in comings years (as the VVD [Union for Freedom and 
Democracy] does). That suggests a positive message, which, 
however, is not there. But by doing so we would disavow both 
our own program and the law: They both state that the 
relationship of the number of working people to the number of 
AOW pensioners and people receiving benefit is an important 
issue. 
  To translate it into popular terms: If employment increases 
by more than 100,000 jobs, then there would be economic leeway 
to allow AOW and social benefits to follow wages. Everyone must 
understand that such leeway does not exist in a year when 
unemployment increases by 100,000 people. But in such a year 
the government should ensure that income ratios remain fair 
using taxation and social bonuses. 
  This explanation alone proves that the PvdA is not seeking 
to 
win people over with empty promises. Voters do not believe in 
"higher wages and lower prices." Furthermore the world economy 
cannot be influenced from The Hague. Therefore, it is 
irresponsible to promise in February 1994 that some two million 
AOW pensioners plus several hundred thousand unemployed and 
people who are unable to work can follow salary levels every 
year until 1998. 
<H5>  Even reduced </H5>
  The fact that the VVD is saying this tells more about the 
VVD 
than the economy. When the VVD had some influence in the 
government in the 1980's, the AOW never matched wage 
developments. On the contrary: The AOW was even reduced. To 
promise the opposite now -- while in the opposition -- of course 
lacks complete credibility. But the opposite is also true: To 
decide in advance on a four-year freeze, as the CDA has done, 
provides no room for the annual assessment which the law 
requires. Or does the CDA not believe that its election program 
can have a positive influence on employment? 
  Working together on work: young and old, rich and poor. 
Each contributing as he can afford. We are convinced that in 
this way it is possible to create some 100,000 new jobs over the 
next four years. The CDA has set the same goal, but says that a 
four-year freeze is necessary. That is a clear choice, but it 
differs from the PvdA's choice. 
  So in contrast to what is often claimed, the voters on 3 May 
do have something to choose.

<F P=106> [Report signed "jjm": "Rexrodt Presents Wish List in </F>
Ottawa"] 
  [Text] Ottawa -- With Guenter Rexrodt visit, a German 
economics minister visited Canada again after well over eight 
years. As Rexrodt described his meeting with Finance Minister 
Paul Martin, Economics Minister John Manley, and Foreign Trade 
Minister Roy MacLaren, there had been talks in Ottawa between 
"free traders" seeking opportunities for closer cooperation on a 
broad level. 
  Rexrodt, who stopped in the Canadian capital for two days on 
his way from the United States to Mexico, immediately presented 
his hosts with a wish list. He is hoping for "fair competition" 
if Canada decides to build a fast railroad line between Quebec 
City and Windsor (Ontario). Of course, given Canada's desolate 
financial situation, the only argument for such a project is the 
creation of jobs. 
  During a visit to the Bombardier works in Montreal, Rexrodt 
also pointed out to the Canadians the advantages of closer 
cooperation in aviation and space travel. He called for 
improved access to the market in the whole area of 
telecommunications. 
  The assessment of the new aggravation in Washington's 
relations with Tokyo made it clear how similar are Bonn's and 
Ottawa's ideas on key questions. Both sides basically welcomed 
American pressure on Japan, all the more so since the Canadians 
also have cause to complain again and again about lack of access 
to the Japanese market. It was also stressed, however, that one 
does not think much of compromises such as agreement on import 
quotas, because this would damage the pure spirit of GATT. 
  On the sidelines of his visit, the Bonn minister also had an 
opportunity to get to know Donald Johnston, Canadian candidate 
for the office of OECD secretary general and a former minister 
from the Trudeau era. Johnston, who will soon travel to the 
capitals of the OECD countries to introduce himself, can count 
on the United States' support, but not on help from Bonn. 
Rexrodt: "We stick to Lorenz Schomerus." 
  Regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement, Rexrodt 
today again sees a potential for German investments in Canada. 
The generally higher educational level in Canada compared with 
the low-wage zones [Leichtlohnzonen] of the United States and 
Mexico, the more comprehensible legal situation, and the 
comparable technical standards favor this, he said.

  [Text] International diplomats are meeting in Bonn today to 
discuss ways of extending the cease-fire in Sarajevo to the 
various Bosnian towns besieged by the Serbs. The United Nations 
is counting on the effective reopening of Tuzla Airport, on 7 
March for example. NATO may be called upon for close air 
support. For Alain Juppe, another ultimatum is not at all 
necessary in order to undertake this operation: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] Ultimatums are fine, but they should 
not be set every day, because they are then difficult to 
enforce. I neither confirm nor deny that date [7 March], 
because it falls within UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] remit. 
I think the United Nations instigated it; the question should 
be put to them. 
  As for Tuzla, we have legal grounds should we want to 
intervene, and I would like to remind you that we have legal 
grounds should we want to resort to force. We do not need any 
other decision. What is it all about? You know very well: We 
are in a town that is in the Muslim zone and under Serb guns. 
We say: We need a new airport so planes carrying out a 
humanitarian airlift can land in this region, which is in a very 
difficult position. For this to happen, it is necessary for the 
Serbs not to threaten shelling. What we want to do is to set up 
a ground control system that will enable planes to land. We say 
quite clearly: Should Serb batteries hinder this, they will be 
destroyed. This is why there is no need for an ultimatum, 
because it is all there, in the documents. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "The Bosnian Tragedy </F>
-- Paris Urges Watchfulness"] 
  [Text] By choosing to speak on television yesterday, the 
president of the Republic did not intend to close one of the 
most difficult and sensitive chapters of the interminable 
Yugoslav tragedy. He was conceivably satisfied, like the whole 
government, with the positive outcome of the ultimatum, but his 
message to the nation was far from triumphant. 
  Thanks to a credible military threat from NATO, the 
situation 
has been "unlocked." Still, "nothing decisive has taken place 
yet." Nothing, especially with regard to what is deemed the 
primary goal: the restoration of peace in Sarajevo, in Bosnia, 
and throughout the former Yugoslavia. "Watchfulness" therefore 
remains the operative word. 
  Even if that means adopting a different position from that 
of 
other Western capitals. Paris yesterday did not limit itself to 
merely acknowledging a "positive step." According to Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe, it was important to "maintain pressure" 
and, as emphasized by presidential sources, "to garner the fruit 
of threat with a view to the future." 
  What matters is determination, making sure that the 
vacillating glimmer of hope will not be extinguished -- this is 
also what Edouard Balladur repeatedly told his successive guests 
throughout the day: First Philippe Seguin and Rene Monory, the 
presidents of the two Houses of Parliament; then political party 
officials, whether or not they have representatives in the House 
or Senate. Flanked by Defense Minister Francois Leotard and 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, the prime minister reviewed the 
local situation for each of his guests. Air and ground 
observation missions carried out yesterday confirmed that for 
the most part, heavy weapons had been moved at least 20 km from 
Sarajevo, regrouped, or -- for a number of immobilized weapons 
-- placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control. 
  After providing this information, the prime minister mostly 
focused on future action -- that is, the political-diplomatic 
phase, which should be started "resolutely and rapidly." It is 
even a matter of "urgency." 
  The president of the Republic and the prime minister, who 
are 
determined to keep dealing "in total harmony" with the Yugoslav 
issue, want French diplomacy to remain not only "active," but 
whenever possible a "driving force" ready to take initiatives or 
to promote those that may be submitted by other parties. Given 
past experiences, including the mired Geneva negotiations, the 
priorities are clear: to enhance American as well as Russian 
involvement in the peace process. 
  It was noted yesterday that the arrival of Russian 
paratroops 
in Sarajevo had no negative impact on the Serbs' decision to 
observe the ultimatum. In the past hours, neither Francois 
Mitterrand nor Edouard Balladur appeared shocked, much less 
angered, by this arrival. 
  Paris hopes that a Russian presence among the Sarajevo blue 
helmets will contribute to restoring a measure of security, 
which, Alain Juppe stressed yesterday morning, is a necessary 
step toward achieving the "goal for the next few days: placing 
greater Sarajevo under UN administration." 
  Here too, "swift action" is essential inasmuch as Sarajevo 
is 
supposed to become "an example" for other safe havens "such as 
Tuzla, Srebrenica, or Gorazde." 
  "We must act," insists Mr. Juppe. "In Tuzla, the airport 
must be reopened. This objective must be achieved as soon as 
possible." "Everything is ready," he indicated, even adding that 
the Russians were ready to participate in the operation meant to 
seize control of the airport. 
  This "common discourse" of the president of the Republic and 
the prime minister was approved by a very large majority of the 
personalities the prime minister met with yesterday. United 
last week (with the exception of the National Front and the 
Communist Party) in their call for a very strict enforcement of 
the ultimatum, political leaders were once again united in 
asking that all "peace opportunities" be pursued. [National 
Front leader] Jean-Marie Le Pen stated he felt "a little 
heartened," while the new Communist Party leader -- who used to 
be so afraid of a NATO intervention -- finally adopted the same 
position as other political leaders, stating that "there is 
nothing more urgent than lowering tension, consolidating the 
ceasefire, and promoting political solutions."

<F P=106> [Jacques Isnard report: "Mirage 2000 Aircraft, Sagaie </F>
Tanks, and Additional Helicopters: France Is Strengthening Its 
Military Presence"] 
  [Text] By deploying more modern aircraft in Italy and 
special radars in Sarajevo, where more tanks and additional 
helicopters are expected, France last week strengthened its 
participation in the allied surveillance and intervention effort 
in Bosnia in aid of the United Nations. 
  On board the aircraft carrier Foch, which is patrolling the 
Adriatic and where he spent the previous night, Defense Minister 
Leotard attended the arrival on Sunday, 20 February in Istrana 
-- a base located 60 km northeast of Vicence (Italy) -- of six 
French Mirage 2000-D aircraft for low altitude all-weather 
attack. These aircraft belong to the 3d squadron at Nancy and 
have been in service for less than a year. This is the first 
time that such aircraft have left French territory. They will 
reinforce NATO's allied surveillance and intervention force over 
Bosnia. 
  Originally, the Mirage 2000-D was not scheduled to join the 
armada of French fighter aircraft to be used in the air fleet 
placed under NATO command for carrying out UN missions. 
  At the Cervia base, some 200 km south of Venice, France 
already maintains eight Jaguar attack planes, which are not 
all-weather aircraft; 10 Mirage 2000-C air defense interceptors; 
five Mirage F1-CR reconnaissance planes; and five Mirage F1-CT 
ground support aircraft. All in all, the allies currently have 
some 210 fighter aircraft, 76 of which are American, in Italy 
and the Adriatic. 
  Mirage 2000-D's were kept in reserve in the south of France. 
Late last week the decision was made to have them fly out of 
their base in Istres (Bouches-du-Rhone) to have them land in 
front of Mr. Leotard in Istrana, before stationing them 
permanently in Cervia, which is just a 45-minute flight from 
Sarajevo. 
  Like the latest American aircraft -- the F-15, eight of 
which 
are based in Aviano -- the Mirage 2000-D is able to navigate and 
accurately fire ammunition (to within 10 or 100 meters, 
depending on the coordinates it receives) in all types of 
weather, night or day, whether conventional or laser-guided 
(Footnote 1) (Very low-altitude firing, which is done via visual 
identification of the target, requires the presence on the 
ground of guidance officers who help the aircraft's crew adjust 
firing. Atmospheric conditions (low clouds, overcast, snow) and 
rough terrain can cause momentary difficulty.). 
  With its newly arrived Mirage 2000-D, France has now 
deployed 
some 68 airplanes and helicopters, including the 18 
Super-Etendard attack helicopters on board the Foch. 
<H5>  Infrared Spy Cameras </H5>
  The arrival in Italy of the Mirage 2000-D's is not the only 
indicator of the increase in French military power to the 
benefit, either directly or indirectly, to UN troops in Bosnia. 
There are others, which are more discreet but no less real. 
  Thus, it is expected that 12 new Sagaie tanks fitted with 
90-mm guns will bolster the 18 already present in Sarajevo and 
placed by France under the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
colors. Similarly, there is talk of bringing 10 French Gazelle 
and Puma helicopters to the Bosnian capital, which have long 
been based in Split (Croatia). These helicopters are equipped 
with infrared cameras and should play an important role in 
reconnoitering the location of batteries and the movements of 
units around Sarajevo. 
  Lastly, since Friday, 18 February the French have had two 
Cymbeline radar tracking units -- like the British, who have 
three -- which make it possible to track the path of a shell 
from where it was fired and identify who fired it. The 
Americans, who are refraining from risking the lives of any GI's 
on the ground, will not put these radars into service so as not 
to expose their operators. The French reinforcement does not 
mean, however, that extra UN troops will be deployed in 
Sarajevo. If there were to be any, they would be taken from the 
French contingents in Bihac and Croatia.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure </F>
by Isabelle Graviere and Jean-Michel Lamy; place, date not 
given: "Enlargement Must Result in Progress for Europe Without 
Blocking the Decisionmaking System] 
  [Text] France's representative at the extraordinary 
European Council meeting today and tomorrow, which is devoted to 
Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway joining the European Union 
[EU], reaffirms the preconditions which need to be fulfilled for 
any expansion of Europe. In particular he put forward as a 
vital precondition that the majority vote should not be weakened 
and that Community achievements should be fully respected. In 
return, the Twelve may grant a transitional period in the most 
sensitive spheres, namely agriculture and fishing. In general, 
he thinks that French enterprises should derive a commercial 
advantage from it. 
  [LES ECHOS] Four countries are trying to complete their 
negotiations on EU membership before 1 March. What importance 
do these new partners have for France? 
  [Lamassoure] Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway are 
democratic and highly developed countries with which we have 
numerous historical, political, economic, and cultural ties. 
That is why we want them to be capable of joining us. In 
addition, these countries represent significant potential 
outlets for our enterprises, which have hitherto not been 
sufficiently investigated. In 1992, France's trade deficit with 
these four countries was 27 billion francs [Fr], with a total of 
Fr40 billion in exports but Fr67 billion in imports. By means 
of these new memberships, we hope to see our foreign trade with 
them balanced (the Norwegian case is special because of our 
purchases of hydrocarbons), as was the case with Spain and 
Portugal when they joined the Community. 
  [LES ECHOS] Would it also be an opportunity for European 
building as a whole? 
  [Lamassoure] These countries have economic, cultural, and 
political traditions which are sometimes different from ours: 
so much the better! France has never thought that Europe 
should be a uniform entity. Europe's originality lies in its 
variety. But on one condition: We want the candidate 
countries, whichever they are -- Austria and the Nordic 
countries today, Central and Eastern Europe in the future -- to 
accept not only the spirit and letter of the European 
institutions but also their ultimate aim. For us, Europe is not 
only a market, it is an economic power, a political edifice. 
From this viewpoint, we are satisfied with the agreement 
already reached with the four candidates on the "foreign and 
security policy" chapter which we thought would be the most 
difficult. However, they have all agreed to adapt their 
legislation to the requirements of the foreign and security 
policy. 
  Having said that, expansion is not an end in itself for the 
EU. It does not have a hegemonistic vocation. We will not 
measure its success by its final geographical dimension. 
Membership is a prospect offered to the European countries 
currently outside the EU. It is for them to know whether they 
wish to join us and, to that end, whether they are ready to 
accept the rules of the European "club." 
  [LES ECHOS] This means that the countries currently 
negotiating with Brussels must make major concessions compared 
with their initial demands. 
  [Lamassoure] They must accept the rules of the game which we 
have set for ourselves in all spheres. What is called the 
Community achievements. I am thinking in particular of 
everything relating to equal conditions of competition, the 
agricultural price policy, fishing, and the funding of the 
European budget. On these points we can accept transitional 
provisions but no permanent exemptions under any circumstances. 
  [LES ECHOS] Are there other essential conditions for France 
to ratify this membership treaty? 
  [Lamassoure] For us, these negotiations must result in 
progress for Europe, not in a questioning of the achievements, 
or a threat to our future decisionmaking system. Let us take 
agriculture: With our 11 partners, we want to see all the 
candidate countries applying the European agricultural prices 
from the first year. However, they will have the opportunity, 
during a transitional period, to pay their farmers national 
income support to compensate for the necessary price cuts in 
Austria, Finland, and Norway. These countries have agricultural 
prices which are much higher than the European prices. 
  As for the implementation of compensatory amounts to 
rebalance the prices at the borders, the statistics currently 
available show that this solution would be too costly for the 
Community budget: ECU1.5 billion over five years for the three 
countries concerned, of which 156 million would be paid in the 
first year. However, all three have a per capita income that is 
markedly higher than the Community average, and does not justify 
such a contribution from the Community budget. 
  [LES ECHOS] The candidate countries may also be counting on 
regional aid, knowing that the least wealthy regions are 
precisely those in which agriculture is less competitive. 
  [Lamassoure] Absolutely. Alongside the common agricultural 
system which we have just discussed, the new members will be 
able to benefit from the European regulations on aid to 
underprivileged regions, which consists of a mixture of national 
and Community aid based on existing criteria. This approach 
will make it possible to support the Austrian Burgenland and a 
large part of the arctic regions. 
  [LES ECHOS] Do other issues specific to particular countries 
also present a problem? 
  [Lamassoure] Fishing is one of them. Norway wanted there to 
be two "blue Europes" -- ours and its own. There can obviously 
only be one. The EU is a single market, meaning the pooling of 
resources. Although, here too, we can accept a transitional 
period. On the other hand, we certainly have lessons to learn, 
in France and in Europe, from the Norwegian fishing policy, 
especially with regard to the stringency of their management of 
resources and the organization of the producers. 
  There is also a problem with regard to road transport in 
Austria. But France is less concerned than others because French 
transporters are only involved in 0.7 percent of truck traffic 
between Germany and Italy. Our concern, in this case too, is to 
reach a common market rationale as quickly as possible and to 
get rid of the bilateral systems which limit relations between 
France and Austria. 
  [LES ECHOS] Does France share the positions of its 11 
partners on all these points under negotiation? 
  [Lamassoure] I think I can say that there is a great 
similarity of views among the Twelve. We have had no problem in 
drawing up joint positions. And with regard to the Commission, 
we will be very vigilant, as we were during the GATT 
negotiations. 
  [LES ECHOS] In all, are you optimistic about the chances of 
reaching agreement with the four candidate countries by 1 March? 
  [Lamassoure] Like most of my colleagues, I think that we 
have a 50 percent chance of reaching agreement by the deadline. 
It depends on the candidate countries. 
  [LES ECHOS] Will increasing from 12 to 16 change the EU's 
identity? 
  [Lamassoure] Yes, I am convinced of it. This quantitative 
change will also correspond to a qualitative threshold, without 
the identity of the four new countries being in question. In 
this case, going from 12 to 16 means crossing a threshold. We 
have been clearly aware of that since there have been 16 of us 
around one table during foreign policy cooperation exercises. 
That is why this change within the EU must lead us to rapidly 
adapt the Community institutions. 
  We are determined that this expansion should not be carried 
out to the detriment of the EU's efficiency and especially its 
decisionmaking system. We have spent years negotiating among 
ourselves, with 10 members and then 12, the establishment of an 
effective system, with a qualified majority vote within the 
Council of Ministers. We can therefore only accept an expansion 
if the weighting of the blocking minority within the Council of 
Ministers increases arithmetically. In other words, if the four 
countries join at the same time, it must go from 23 votes (out 
of a total of 76) to 27 votes (out of 90). That is a vital 
precondition. Omitting it would amount to blocking the European 
decisionmaking mechanism. We are currently divided from our 
British and Spanish friends on this point. 
  The present French Government even wanted more major reforms 
to be carried out at the same time as the membership 
negotiations. We said that in particular at the European 
Council meeting in Brussels on 29 October. The majority of our 
partners thought otherwise, preferring that these discussions 
should take place at the time stipulated by the Maastricht 
Treaty -- in 1996. The countries which are now candidates, if 
they have meanwhile become EU members, will therefore 
participate with us in the 1996 institutional exercise. 
  [LES ECHOS] That would not make it impossible to start 
thinking about possible reforms within a working group. 
  [Lamassoure] We are not really in favor of that, because the 
reform has been postponed. The idea of a committee of wisemen 
does not displease us. I think I was among the first to discuss 
it a few months ago. But starting a major debate now without 
being able to complete it would only complicate matters, both in 
the candidate countries, whose populations will vote in a 
referendum, and within the Twelve, where the June European 
election campaign is due to start. 
  [LES ECHOS] In the absence of current thinking by the 
Twelve, is there already a French position, particularly within 
the government coalition? 
  [Lamassoure] We must await the political parties' platforms 
for the June elections. With regard to the majority, I note 
that there are broad areas of agreement between the UDF [Union 
for French Democracy] and RPR [Rally for the Republic]. The 
working group which brings together the leaderships of the two 
parties should produce a joint document fairly soon. But before 
changing the institutions, the important thing is to adapt our 
Community administration method to the new responsibilities 
which the Maastricht Treaty gives us: currency, foreign policy, 
internal affairs, and justice. With regard to the currency, we 
have an accurately defined administration system which is 
centered on the European Monetary Institute. 
  On the other hand, with regard to foreign policy, internal 
affairs, and justice, the treaty only put forward the principle 
of European competence and the qualified majority decisionmaking 
method for what are called "common actions." It does not 
stipulate the preparation of the decision or its funding. So, 
it is as if we were pretending to have a common foreign policy 
with 12 ministers and no ministry! There is no body around the 
Council table capable of evaluating a foreign policy option, of 
defining the common interest which is never the sum of the 
individual interests, and then ensuring the implementation of 
the decision made. 
  Similarly there is the question of funding this foreign 
policy. At present there is only one example: We have decided 
on a humanitarian program to help Bosnia, worth ECU48 million, 
on a half-Community, half-national basis. But this case is not 
a precedent. We do not yet have a joint position of principle. 
  [LES ECHOS] Do these unresolved problems cast doubt on 
expansion to Eastern Europe? 
  [Lamassoure] We need to solve them, with or without 
expansion. With regard to the eastern part of the continent, 
France thinks that the definition of relations with Central and 
Eastern Europe is a fundamental point on which it wants to make 
progress during its term as EU president (in the first half of 
1995). There is an urgent need: Hungary will make a formal 
application for membership. We have so far told these countries 
that they have a vocation to join us, but without specifying the 
conditions, the methods, or a timetable. We are proposing to 
draw up criteria which will make it possible to assess the 
convergence of the economies and societies of those countries 
with ours. Specifying that all the Central and East European 
countries must be put on an equal footing. We are to have a 
discussion at France's request at the European Council of 
Ministers meeting on 7 and 8 March.

<F P=106> [Column by Rene Galy-Dejean, chairman of the National </F>
Assembly's Defense Commission and Rally for the Republic deputy 
in Paris: "Mr. Mitterrand's Trap"] 
  [Text] After the ministerial meeting in the Elysee 
[presidential office] on Wednesday, 15 February to discuss the 
Defense White Paper, Rene Galy-Dejean, author of two 
parliamentary reports on nuclear testing and the armaments 
industry, accused Francois Mitterrand of setting a trap for the 
majority concerning the M5 strategic missile. 
  One of the particularly tough problems in the military 
planning law is to be found in the fate reserved for the future 
M5 missile. Between 2005 and 2010, this missile could replace 
the M45, which is currently under development for the new 
generation of submarines. The M45 will carry the latest nuclear 
warhead, the TN75. Thus renovated, the French strategic ocean 
force will comprise, by unanimous opinion, a tool for deterrence 
whose reliability can be guaranteed for the next 10 years. 
  In this context, what question should the politicians in 
charge be asking? In my opinion, the immediate development of 
the M5 is the most serious mistake that could be made in the 
drafting of the planning law. Not only would it be a mistake in 
technological terms, but also in budgetary, strategic, and 
therefore political terms. 
  Technologically, the gain in performance attributed to the 
future missile -- and the gain which is likely to be achieved -- 
concerns range, accuracy, payload, and stealth. So far, 
however, this improved missile is felt to go hand in hand with a 
new warhead, the TN100, which is already in the design stage at 
the Atomic Energy Commission. This load will yield enhanced 
performance in terms of penetration and accuracy. 
  Is all this so very urgent? This does, it is true, represent 
decisive progress, but in only one area: The enhanced range 
"gives water" to submarines, i.e., it allows them to patrol in 
warm waters and to increase their potential and safety. 
However, as for the rest, there are a great many contradictions 
and uncertainties in the process! 
<H5>  Contradiction </H5>
  We are increasing the surface of the targeted objective, 
while at the same time a consensus is emerging for moving away 
from a "city-oriented" doctrine of deterrence toward a doctrine 
based on the destruction of forces, in other words one that is 
more "targeted" and sophisticated. We are increasing the volume 
and payload of the missile's warhead, while every indicator 
points to a constant move toward nuclear warheads which are 
smaller in volume and weight, but which have equal strength. 
This is even one of France's specialties. Moreover, we are 
implementing a new armaments system based on the TN100 -- a 
warhead that is innovative in terms of design and operation -- 
at a time when we are suspending nuclear tests and when, as a 
result, we are banning the validation of its design and 
development, and therefore the verification of the sought-after 
results. 
  To get around this contradiction, it is said that the 
current 
TN75 warhead, which will soon be in service, can be improved and 
adapted to the new M5 missile. This weakens the rhetoric and 
the deterrence. We find ourselves involved in an approach based 
on opportunity and not efficiency. Such opportunism has 
characterized the M5 missile since its birth and places a 
terrible financial burden on the defense budget and planning law. 
  It is estimated that the M5 missile alone, without its 
nuclear warhead, will cost around 65 billion francs. Its launch 
was announced to the Aerospatiale group in January 1992 -- two 
months before the last legislative elections -- in a letter from 
the defense minister (Pierre Joxe). This baptism may appear 
blighted with some suspicion of electioneering, even if I do not 
ignore the problematically low order load of Aerospatiale's 
"strategic missiles" division. 
  Yet, was the military staff in favor of this? Was a decision 
made in the Defense Council? 
  At the same time, the Defense Ministry published a 
"reference 
document" on planning, the stand-in for the law that was not 
discussed in Parliament. This "reference document" clearly 
showed that merely pursuing the irreversible programmes already 
under way would put too much pressure on the budget capacity in 
the medium term. Of course, funding allocated to the M5 missile 
in the 1993 budget was low, and it will be equally low in 1994. 
However, what will become of the new planning law if program 
authorizations have to be increased in the short term? We thus 
deprive the law of any maneuvering room, unless one major 
ongoing project is canceled. And who will take that risk? 
<H5>  Deterrence Thwarted </H5>
  Consequently, we are blocking the development of our 
deterrence strategy. This development, which now enjoys broad 
consensus within the Armed Forces and the majority, is imposed 
by geopolitical upheavals. 
  We know the broad outlines of this consensus. Submarines are 
an important -- if not key -- strategic element in our defense 
apparatus, but the search for greater flexibility and improved 
adaptation to the new context has led to the implementation of a 
second airborne "component" fitted with the LRAS (long-range 
air-to- surface) missile. This "component" would have strike 
capacities for a second and final warning. 
  At the same time, the discussion of the implementation of 
antimissile protection is necessary in our country. From now 
on, Aerospatiale -- despite the defection of the British over 
the LRAS -- is in a position to develop missiles capable of 
stopping ballistic missiles at mid-altitude. In addition, the 
company alone can equip France with a long-range air-to-surface 
missile. 
  All this will be made financially impossible by the further 
development of the M5 missile. This missile will destroy what 
little flexibility a sustained budgetary effort could give to 
the planning law. 
  It is here that we meet up with politics again. The trap 
which the president of the republic has just set for the 
government and its majority was laid out in a sentence spoken in 
an interview given to AFP by Francois Mitterrand (LE MONDE of 11 
January). He spoke of a "new missile which comprises a major 
improvement, namely in terms of range, and which could also be 
installed on the Albion platform." 
  So here is the M5 destroying the entire planning with all 
its 
might. Here is the compromised strategic development, the 
second weakened nuclear "component," and the antiballistic 
protection system postponed indefinitely. Here, lastly, is the 
Albion platform put back in the saddle and the "sanctuarization" 
of the reactivated territory. 
  Such a regression in our nuclear strategy is inconceivable. 
Or perhaps we are to think that Mr. Mitterrand, who came to 
power with a strong prejudice against deterrence, will leave his 
post by depriving his successor of this powerful tool, after he 
himself made use of it. The halting of nuclear testing and the 
fate of the M5 make one wonder. My feeling is that it would be 
desirable to stagger the implementation of the M5 in order to 
give France some latitude in adapting its strategy and equipping 
its forces for a new and dangerous world that is now emerging.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mr. de Charette States That UDF Will </F>
Have a Candidate in 1995 Presidential Election"] 
  [Text] Housing Minister Herve de Charette (UDF [Union for 
French Democracy]-Realities and Prospects Clubs) said on the 
Luxembourg Radio and Television "Grand Jury" program that the 
UDF will "obviously have a candidate" in the 1995 presidential 
election. "I want a UDF candidate," he said, "and I do not see 
how it could be otherwise.... A two-round majority election 
necessarily requires that there are two candidates in each camp 
in the first round." Mr. de Charette, who is close to UDF 
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said that he "had never been 
very much in favor" of the system of "primaries" for the 
presidential election which Charles Pasqua wants. "It would be 
very difficult to legislate on that," he said. 
  Senate Speaker Rene Monory (UDF-Social Democratic Center) 
also said it is "probable if not certain that there will be a 
UDF candidate" in the presidential election. Mr. Monory, the 
guest on the France-2 "Hour of Truth" program, added that 
wanting "a single candidate" for the majority "at any cost," as 
Mr. Pasqua does, strikes him as "not a good idea." "There are 
two big groups which must help each other to win the 
presidential election," he stressed. 
  Moreover, Mr. Monory thinks that the future candidate for 
the 
presidential election will have to promise to carry out "a 
far-reaching reform of society." "I am certainly not 
criticizing the government's record, but there are problems to 
be solved," he said. "What has to be done is not pleasant," the 
Senate speaker stressed. "A number of achievements must be 
questioned, but the closer we come to the election date the more 
this will have to be said to ensure that people are not taken by 
surprise.... What is tragic is that many promises were made in 
1993, far more than can probably be kept." 
  UDF spokesman Jean-Pierre Raffarin (UDF-Republican Party) 
also thinks it is "natural for the UDF to have a candidate in 
the first round" of the presidential election. The UDF "is 
exercising power on an equal footing, holding the speaker's post 
in the Senate, and with a majority in the regions and 
departments," he said. 
  "The candidate will therefore run in the first round" of the 
presidential election "in a spirit of alliance," Mr. Raffarin 
said on Radio-J. Among the UDF's "men of stature," Raffarin 
cited Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, the president of the confederation; 
Mr. Monory; Raymond Barre; and Defense Minister Francois Leotard. 
  In conclusion, Mr. Raffarin criticized the government's 
policy, calling for a "psychological impact" to combat "the 
serious risks of a social explosion." "I cannot be satisfied 
with a television program, whatever the talents and merits of 
the public protagonists," the UDF spokesman said with reference 
to Mr. Balladur's appearance on the "Hour of Truth" on 14 
February.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Admiral Coatanea, Navy Chief of </F>
Staff, Strongly Deplores Delay in Replacing Carriers"] 
  [Text] In an interview granted to the weekly COLS BLEUS, 
Admiral Alain Coatanea, Navy Chief of Staff, sums up the 
activities of the year 1993. The weekly quotes the admiral as 
saying that he "continues vigorously to deplore" the cumulative 
delay in replacing the two French aircraft carriers, because 
this is liable to "insiduously weaken" the capabilities of the 
Naval Air Service. 
  As we know, budget restraints have forced the successive 
governments to delay (initially by 30 months and more recently 
by an additional six months) the commissioning of the nuclear 
aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle--now under construction in 
the Brest navy yard--whose total cost is estimated at 17 billion 
francs [Fr], of which Fr10 billion has already been 
appropriated. The carrier is currently scheduled to be 
commissioned no earlier than late 1999, with an initial 
detachment of Rafale fighter aircraft on board. 
  "The Clemenceau was commissioned in 1961 and the Foch in 
1963," Admiral Coatanea explained to COLS BLEUS. "The Alize (a 
carrier-based maritime reconnaissance and antisubmarine fighter 
aircraft) joined the flotilla in 1958. The Crusader (a 
carrier-based aircraft designed for air defense) dates back to 
1964. Their replacement is therefore urgently necessary, and I 
continue vigorously to deplore the successive delays in this 
program. These postponements insidiously weaken our capability 
for naval air action, the value of which has been demonstrated 
by the events of recent years. Moreover, these delays saddle 
those responsible for ensuring the availability of such 
action--and for carrying it out--with a burden whose increasing 
physical and psychological impact is comprehended by very few." 
  "We appear to be on the right track, however," the admiral 
went on to say. "The Charles de Gaulle will be launched next 
spring. It is scheduled to go into active service by the end of 
the century, equipped with its first Rafale fighter aircraft and 
also a reconnaissance aircraft for which provision has been made 
in the budget." 
  Admiral Coatanea made mention of the proposal--submitted to 
the government by the Navy--to purchase four Hawkeye 
carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft from the U.S. Grumman 
company. This radar-guided aircraft is capable of 
"illuminating": that is to say, capable of detecting aerial 
intrusions (by aircraft or missiles) that might pose a threat to 
aircraft carriers at sea. The cost of the project is estimated 
at Fr5.8 billion, and the 1994 defense budget has already set 
aside Fr1.735 billion. 
  The Navy chief of staff "strongly" expressed the hope that 
"a 
second aircraft carrier will go into service several years 
later." Together with the Charles de Gaulle, he said, a second 
carrier would "constitute a homogeneous and powerful force that 
would always be available to support any action taken to 
prevent, contain, or otherwise respond to a crisis or conflict."

txt}[Text] An increase in the immigration of workers; a decrease 
in family reunifications; and a less rapid increase in the 
number of "mixed" marriages: These are the principal changes 
noted by the Directorate of Populations and Migrations of the 
Social Affairs Ministry [DPM] in its annual report for the years 
1991 and 1992, which it made public on Monday 31 January. 
  Several indicators of the immigration of non-Europeans were 
in decline even before the Pasqua laws of 1993 took effect, 
according to the DPM's annual report. The report states that 
135,372 foreign nationals became permanent residents of France 
in 1992 compared to 123,413 who did so in 1991 (up 10.9 
percent). Of this number, approximately 100,000 were natives of 
countries outside the European Union (representing a decrease of 
5 percent from the figure for 1992) while 35,000 were Europeans 
(representing a very sharp increase of 100 percent, for 
statistical reasons associated with the unrestricted movement of 
Spaniards and Portuguese). 
  In similar fashion, the principal immigration flows--family 
reunifications (down 8.3 percent) and the granting of political 
refugee status (down 30 percent), both of which are subject to 
the provisions of the Pasqua laws--decreased sharply in 1992. 
Family reunifications--which peaked in 1990 with the arrival of 
approximately 37,000 women and children--dropped to 32,665 in 
1992. The spectacular decline in the number of new refugees is 
explained by the fact that since 1990 the number of requests for 
asylum has decreased and the requests are being processed more 
rapidly. More foreign nationals, however, were acquiring the 
status of wage earner between 1991 and 1992, with 18,487 
non-Europeans being admitted compared to 17,056 the previous 
year (up 8.4 percent, which rises to 65 percent if you count 
only Europeans). This development is explained largely by 
changed circumstances. In the case of the Spaniards and 
Portuguese, it resulted from the registration of individual 
cases not previously declared. The increase in the number of 
non-EC nationals, on the other hand, reflects the regularization 
of the status of applicants for asylum whose applications had 
previously been rejected. 
<H5>  Less Rapid Increase in the Number of "Mixed" Marriages </H5>
  A complete analysis of the immigration flows should take 
account not only of the arrivals but also of the departures. The 
French statistical apparatus is deficient with respect to 
departures, because it records only the forced 
departures--expulsions, and escorted (or "assisted," i.e., 
subsidized) returns to the border--without providing the 
slightest indication of the numerous spontaneous departures. 
With respect to the forced departures--which the present 
interior minister has promised to double--the DPM report points 
out that the number of escorted returns actually carried out has 
remained stable (8,638 in 1991 compared to 9,160 in 1987). The 
program of "assisted" departures that was resumed in 1991 has 
been only minimally effective, inasmuch as it aided only 1,212 
foreign nationals in 1992. 
  The ultimate "way out" of foreign national status is the 
acquisition of French nationality. A total of 95,300 foreign 
nationals became French citizens in 1992 either by 
naturalization (39,346), by marriage or declaration of one's 
parents (32,249), or by informal acquisition of citizenship at 
age 18 (23,700) (the latter two methods were abolished by the 
Pasqua-Mehaignerie law of 22 July 1993). The DPM report confirms 
the increasing proportion of Africans--and especially of emigres 
from the Maghreb--among these new French citizens. It also 
confirms the increase in the number of "mixed" marriages, which 
accounted for approximately 12 percent of the total number of 
marriages contracted in France in 1991. This increase--which is 
one of the "thermometers" used to measure the integration of 
foreign populations--is, however, slowing down after two years 
of very strong growth.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Bernard: "The Computerized Identity </F>
Card Will Be in General Use in 1995"] 
  [Text] Fifteen years after its abortive issuance by Valery 
Giscard d'Etaing, the so-called "tamper-proof" computerized 
identity card will become a reality for all French citizens who 
request the card, the possession of which is--and will 
remain--optional. The new card is in the form of a laminated 
rectangle and is larger than a credit card. It is made of 
squared banknote paper overlaid with "security" printing the 
color of which varies from blue to green when exposed to certain 
kinds of light. 
  A total of 5,000 cards have already been issued to residents 
of Hauts-de-Seine since April 1988, when the experiment was 
begun in Nanterre Prefecture. Issuance of these cards--which was 
one of the priorities of the Right when it returned to power in 
1986--was discontinued by the Socialists after 1988. Interior 
Minister Charles Pasqua resumed the practice last March, and the 
residents of Essonne, Moselle, and Mayenne have had identity 
cards for several weeks. Forty additional departments will be 
involved this year, and the remainder of the country--including 
Paris--will follow in 1995. 
  The decree of March 1987 that specified the characteristics 
of the new card and authorized the creation of a system of 
computerized manufacture and control took into account the 
criticism expressed by the National Commission on Computer 
Science and the Freedoms (CNIL). In particular, the commission 
ruled out any magnetic scanning that would have made it possible 
to enter invisible information without the knowledge of the 
cardholder. 
  Direct access to the system of computerized control was 
limited by the CNIL to only those services responsible for 
preparing the cards and for certifying their authenticity, 
thereby excluding the police and gendarmerie services, who will 
have access only to the file of cards reported stolen or lost 
and the file of persons wanted by the law. 
<H5>  A Desire to "Start All Over" </H5>
  The commission did, however, authorize fingerprinting--a 
precaution deemed to be useful in combating usurpations of 
identity--but only on condition that the fingerprints not be 
digitized and not be used to create a file. 
  The central computer file will accordingly contain only 
those 
data that appear on the card, together with the nature of the 
civil document that was prepared as a basis for issuing the 
card. According to Interior Minister Pasqua, the new card 
represents "a safeguard for the cardholder" and "security for 
commercial transactions." It is also expected to facilitate 
identification of persons wanted by the law. 
  To justify making the new card generally available, Pasqua 
cites the increased incidence of the counterfeiting and forgery 
of the present paper cards. More than 9,000 such cases were 
detected in 1992 (out of 3.6 million cards issued) compared to 
fewer than 6,000 in 1988. He said that no falsification of the 
new card has been reported in Hauts-de-Seine. 
  The new system is more secure, but it is also more 
burdensome. "Security is worth a little patience," Pasqua notes. 
The manufacture of the cards will be centralized at two sites. 
The first site--at Marne-La-Vallee (Seine-et-Marne 
Department)--houses the national file for the control of the 
cards and will be able to produce up to 3 million cards this 
year; the second site is scheduled to be established in another 
region of the country. A minimum delay of from eight to 10 days 
will be necessary between the receipt of a request and the 
issuance of the card. To prevent fraud, all files will in effect 
be reviewed by the subprefectures or prefectures, which will 
give the green light to the production center. In principle, the 
documents required to establish a card remain unchanged. In 
order to ensure the security of the data in the computer file, 
however, the renewal of an old card is treated as a new request 
and presupposes the same formal procedures. This desire to 
"start all over" translates into a nuisance for French citizens 
who were born abroad or both of whose parents were born abroad, 
of whom a certificate of nationality may be required. Lastly, in 
order to prevent usurpations of identity, copies of birth 
certificates (which these criminals have heretofore had sent to 
them by mail) will be transmitted directly to the prefectures by 
the municipal governments. 
  The introduction of the new card--and of the computerized 
files--represents a 400 million franc market for Idmatics, a 
subsidiary of Thomson-CSF [General Radio Company]. Similar 
contracts have been signed in the United States, Spain, Peru, 
and Colombia, and will be signed shortly in Greece. The interior 
minister is delighted with the French success in this sphere and 
has made no secret of his new projects: the computerization of 
drivers' licenses and foreign nationals' residence certificates. 
The residence certificates could in this way be replaced by 
"tamper-proof labels" affixed to passports.

  [Text] Serge Abou, the European Union [EU] observer on the 
Cyprus issue, said that the signing of an agreement between the 
two communities on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] 
would be a significant achievement. Mr. Abou also noted that 
such an agreement would create the correct impetus, as he put 
it, toward achieving an overall Cyprus solution. 
  In a statement after his meeting with Foreign Minister 
Alekos 
Mikhailidhis this morning, Mr. Abou described the contacts he 
had with President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, 
as very important in view of the report on the Cyprus issue he 
will prepare for the EU's Council of Ministers. 
  Responding to a question on the CBM's compatibility with EU 
norms, Mr. Abou said that the United Nations has assured him 
that there is no problem. Nevertheless, he added there is no 
easy answer to this issue. Answering another question on 
Turkey's stance, he noted that during his recent visit to that 
country he received assurances that Turkey desires a Cyprus 
solution.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has warned that if 
[Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas uses delaying tactics in 
the talks on the confidence-building measures claiming political 
instability in Turkey, he will find himself against the UN 
Security Council and the secretary general. In a statement 
following successive meetings with leaders or representatives of 
the political parties represented in the House of 
Representatives, President Kliridhis also noted that the United 
Nations has submitted no new proposals on ways to implement the 
confidence-building measures. He added that at the end of 
February, the secretary general will submit a preliminary report 
on the results of the proximity talks and a new report at the 
end of March.

  [Text] A Swiss government minister has described as a 
catastrophe the decision by voters to accept a controversial 
proposal banning foreign lorries from driving through the Swiss 
Alps. 
  The economics minister, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, said the 
electorate had acted like an ayatollah issuing a diktat. In an 
interview with the TAGES ANZEIGER newspaper, Mr. Delamuraz, a 
French speaker, attacked the Swiss Germans who voted 
overwhelmingly in favor of the Alpine initiative. He said the 
French-speaking population was fed up with being dictated to by 
a majority which did not appreciate that Switzerland's future 
lay in Europe. 
  The European Commission has said it will study the 
implications of the vote for Switzerland's future relations with 
the European Union. Under the initiative, all lorries making 
international journeys across the Alps will be forced onto the 
railways by the year 2004.

  [Text] In the Swiss referendum on a transit ban for 
trucks, the majority of the Swiss and the required majority of 
cantons came out in favor of such a ban. Thirteen full and six 
half cantons accepted the referendum, which corresponds to 16 
"canton votes" and, thus, a clear "yes" to the ban. A total of 
52 percent of the Swiss voted for the referendum. 
  Up until now, Switzerland has had a 28-tonne limit for 
trucks 
and a ban on night driving. The transit traffic ban says that 
as of 2004, goods may be transported through Switzerland only by 
train and that no new roads through the Alps may be built.

<F P=106> ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "Three Dead Bodies </F>
Recovered"] 
  [Text] Friedrichshafen -- After the Jago submarine 
retrieved the third corpse from the bottom of Lake Constance on 
Saturday [19 February], even the last rumors surrounding the 
crash of the Cessna 525 had to subside: Even Berlin businessman 
Josef Rimmele (54) is no longer alive. On Friday, the bodies 
of Rimmele's business partner Klaus Eichler (53) and the Czech 
interpreter Alena Petrusheva (39) were recovered. The search for 
Rudolf Wirschen (44), the pilot of the crashed plane, and Iveta 
Ranetova (30), the Czech hotel manager, was continued yesterday 
by the 70-member crew of the August Thienemann research ship 
with the support of the Jago research submarine. By Sunday 
afternoon, however, the search remained without any result. 
  Bundeswehr experts from Fuerstenfeldbruck performed 
autopsies 
on the two bodies at a hospital in Friedrichshafen, after Jago 
used its grip arm on Friday to recover them from a depth of 160 
meters. The experts stated that it was certain that the two 
persons had drowned, and that they were also affected by the 
cold. 
  Thus, the disaster can be reconstructed in the following 
way: 
The two-engine charter aircraft, which set off from Prague on 24 
January, was forced to attempt an emergency landing on the water 
-- for reasons that are still unclear -- immediately before 
approaching the Swiss Altenrhein Airport (St. Gallen). Some 5 
km from the lake shore, the wreckage floated on the surface for 
a little while. The five persons on board the aircraft -- 
Rimmele's dog might have been on board as well -- survived the 
crash, managed to undo their seat belts, and left the aircraft. 
However, they could not rescue themselves from the ice-cold 
waters of Lake Constance.

<F P=106> [Report by Brussels correspondent Nikolaos Belos--recorded] </F>
  [Text] European Union [EU] Commision member Hans van den 
Broek has taken the initiative to visit Skopje and Athens to 
seek a solution to the political problem. The visit to Skopje 
will take place on Wednesday [23 February] and to Athens on 
Thursday. At the same time, the European Commission today 
undertook a commitement to examine from the legal point of view 
the Greek Government's measures against Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] in order to establish 
whether there are reasons for referring the case against our 
country to the European Court. These are the two decisions made 
at noon today during the meeting of the EU foreign ministers. 
  According to the statement by Alternate Foreign Minister 
Theodhoros Pangalos, who is presiding over the council, the 
question of Greece's measures against Skopje was raised at the 
meeting by EU Commission President Jacques Delors. According to 
Mr. Pangalos, most of the countries criticized Greece both for 
the nature of the measures and the way in which they were 
adopted. Responding to questions from correspondents, the 
alternate foreign minister described the Government's decision 
as an exceptional measure of a political nature. We regret 
having to make this decision, he said. We would like to have 
good relations with this republic but tolerance -- as Mr. 
Pangalos put it -- has its limits. Mr. Pangalos further stressed 
that in the next few hours the Government will present to the EU 
Commission all the legal arguments that, in the Government's 
opinion, justify its decision. 
  Asked whether Greece had informed the member states in time, 
Mr. Pangalos said that the 11 members were briefed 
simultaneously with the announcement of the measures. Referring 
to the measures, the alternate foreign minister stressed that 
the embargo against FYROM does not include medicines, 
foodstuffs, or oil used by humanitarian institutions. 
  It is worth noting that, at his regular briefing of the 
correspondents this morning, the EU Commission spokesman said 
that the Commission understands very well that the FYROM issue 
is sensitive for the Greek Government and the sentimental 
reaction of Greek public opinion. However, as he said, the 
Commission in its capacity as guardian of the [Maastricht] 
Treaty has to examine the legal dimensions of the measures that 
the Government has taken in the light of the EU's lawful order.

  [Text] Commenting on a statement by the Luxembourg foreign 
minister that if Greek explanations of the measures against 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] are 
not satisfactory, the issue will end up at the European Court, 
government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said Greece is willing 
to defend its positions to all international organizations. He 
added, however, that it is not a legal problem but a political 
one. Venizelos said the Greek Government is particularly 
satisfied with the outcome of the European foreign ministers' 
meeting because it handled the issue as a political one. 
  Venizelos said the measures continue to be implemented. 
Asked whether EU Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek will visit 
Skopje and Athens, the spokesman replied positively and added 
that his mission would be to examine the situation. The 
government spokesman said Van Den Broek will meet the Greek 
Government, which will express its well-known and clear 
positions. He said: For us, dialogue will begin when [FYROM 
President Kiro] Gligorov's government gives tangible proof of 
goodwill. 
  Asked about the community's mechanism and Van Den Broek's 
visit to Athens and Skopje, Venizelos said the Dutch 
commissioner will pay a visit in order to determine whether 
Skopje maintains the same intransigent behavior. Greece has 
adopted these measures after considering Skopje's intransigence. 
The spokesman described as absurd reports of an equal distance 
between the EU, Greece, and Skopje, because Greece is a member 
of the community and currently holds the presidency. Venizelos 
concluded: A presidency that has been praised so far.

<F P=106> [Report by Athanasios Dhrougos] </F>
  [Excerpts] Turkey's secret nuclear program is a threat to 
Greece. According to extremely confidential APOYEVMATINI 
information, YEETHA [National Defense General Staff] military 
officials have been particularly concerned. 
  According to these reports, "heading toward the year 2000 
and 
facing a chaotic situation in the Balkans, Turkey in the next 
three or four years will be well along the path of developing 
nuclear forces, something that will make it particularly 
respected in the part of the world stretching from the Adriatic 
to Kazakhstan." 
  A nuclear program that aims to construct a nuclear bomb is 
under way. This program will be added to Ankara's already 
fast-developing arms programs for the Air Force and Navy. The 
same confidential analysis of Turkey's nuclear activities 
stresses that in the new geopolitical environment that followed 
the dissolution of the Soviet nuclear arsenal; Ukraine's 
acquisition of nuclear weapons; and the general instability in 
the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East, Turkey must 
prevent incidents from happening because the threat of small 
regional wars with nuclear weapons, such as between Pakistan and 
India, cannot be ruled out. [passage omitted] 
  To a great extent, Turkey satisfies the basic prerequisites 
for a nuclear country. It has uranium supplies and is strong in 
the sciences. If its cooperation with Pakistan, Argentina, and 
China proceeds, the Turkish nuclear bomb will become a reality. 
At the same time, Ankara is trying to exploit instability in 
the Middle East as well as the ambitions of many states in the 
area, such as Libya and Iran, for weapons of mass destruction 
(nuclear-chemical) by claiming that Iran or Iraq will threaten 
it in the future. Therefore, because of changes in NATO 
policies, it must have a nuclear bomb. [passage omitted] 
  Ankara is trying to acquire nuclear weapons from the former 
Soviet Union's full and diverse arsenal but is concerned with 
U.S. and European reaction. All those unemployed scientists 
have been hired to various "special groups" on a yearly basis 
for $2,300 per month. Their contracts may be renewed. 
Scientists from Kazakhstan who are experts on nuclear weapons 
teach at Istanbul University. [passage omitted] 
  The cost of making nuclear weapons is believed to be great 
but Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and her staff are 
concerned with the new world that is being created. They attach 
particular importance to the country's nuclear infrastructure, 
which is now making progress and will show results in three or 
four years. 
  APOYEVMATINI knows that Turkey's nuclear program concerns 
the 
Greek military. It is a fact that in the next few years, 
Turkey's threat to Greece will include a nuclear element. Our 
side must adopt a strategy that will analyze in depth future 
threats, mainly by Turkey's many arms programs.

  [Text] The goverment's sanctions of Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Repulic of Macedonia--FYROM] met with a mixed reaction 
from Greece's opposition parties, earning approval from parties 
to the socialists' right and disapproval from their left. 
  The leaders of the three opposition parties were briefed 
before the cabinet meeting by the prime minister's aides. 
  "We are determined to support the government precisely 
because we believe in a united foreign policy," said Miltiadhis 
Evert, leader of the main opposition New Democracy party. 
  Mr. Evert took the opportunity of a previously scheduled 
working lunch with European Union ambassadors to express Greek 
fears that airstrikes against Bosnian Serb targets could lead to 
a Balkan conflagration. He also outlined a New Democracy 
proposal for a friendship pact among Balkan states. 
  Political Spring leader Andonios Samaras, a former 
conservative foreign minister who resigned from New Democracy 
over its position on the Skopje issue, expressed his party's 
full support for the decision. 
  "We had suggested that the prime minister could either fight 
or give up... Today he took the decision to fight -- which we 
have persistently asked," he said in a statement. "Our support 
is implicit as long as our national struggle be waged 
responsibly, consistently and soberly at all levels and without 
being undermined by defeatist consciences." 
  Greece's two main left parties, the Communist Party (KKE) 
and 
the Coalition of the Left and Progress, the latter not 
represented in the current parliament, criticised the 
government's decision in separate statements. 
  Describing the measures as an "adventuristic distraction", 
KKE leader Aleka Papariga said they would only serve to raise 
tensions in the region and "facilitate the plans of the United 
States and NATO." 
  She added that she had sent a letter to Mr. Papandreou 
requesting a parliamentary debate on developments in the Balkans. 
  "The measures that the government has decided to take 
imprison us in the logic and tactic of tension that only serve 
others' interests," said the Left Coalition's leader Nikoalos 
Konstandopoulos. "We become a part of the crisis...and we are 
in danger of being blamed for the tension and losing everything 
in the Skopje issue."

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent Eduardo Sanz] 
Foreign Minister Javier Solana is convinced that the coming 
hours will be decisive for peace in Bosnia, although he did not 
hide the fact that there may be moments of great tension. The 
current situation is encouraging, he says, and so far there is 
the hope that NATO intervention against the Serb batteries may 
not be necessary. However, he admits that information is still 
lacking about the withdrawal of their armaments and the handing 
over of some of them to the blue helmets. 
  [Begin Solana recording] I think that one can say that the 
situation on the ground remains encouraging. By encouraging we 
mean that it is our hope that the objectives of the ultimatum 
that has to be met tomorrow night will be fulfilled without it 
being necessary to carry out air strikes. But I can also tell 
you that there is still a certain confusion on the ground as 
regards the withdrawal of the Serb heavy weapons. [end recording] 
  [Sanz] In spite of Javier Solana's reservations and the need 
not to celebrate prematurely, if the withdrawal and the control 
of Sarajevo by the blue helmets comes about, the minister 
stressed that the solution to the conflict is not military but 
political and that there are already diplomatic measures, which 
will become known next week and which will have to involve the 
United States and Russia. 
  [Begin Solana recording] Some initiatives are on the table; 
I 
cannot be more specific at present, but, I believe that next 
week, depending on how the latest events go up to the weekend, 
there may be some other initiatives of a negotiating character: 
initiatives that will undoubtedly involve the European Union and 
undoubtedly involve -- and we want them to be more involved -- 
the United States and Russia. [end recording] [passage omitted]

favor of the Bosnian city of Mostar, which is entrusted to the 
Spanish blue helmets, being included by the United Nations in 
the first group of safe areas to receive the same kind of 
treatment as that applied to Sarajevo. 
  In statements made after meeting the Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzaq Rabin, Garcia Vargas admitted that UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali seemed to have given priority to the cities of 
Tuzla and Srebrenica. However, according to the Spanish defense 
minister, the momentum could also take in Mostar. 
  As for the presence of the Spanish blue helmets in Bosnia, 
Garcia Vargas pointed out that their presence depends on what 
happens in the conflict as a whole. The minister added that in 
this situation Spain would not act on its own, and it would 
fulfill its obligations -- i.e. in the short-term it would 
continue its work as part of the UN forces in Bosnia.

  [Text] According to [Spanish Defense Minister Julian] 
Garcia Vargas, the Spanish soldiers deployed in Sarajevo will 
not intervene even if NATO were to bomb the Serbs, because: We 
do not belong to the air task force. 
  Spain answered NATO by saying that it would not increase the 
number of blue helmets in Bosnia; however it can send more 
observers, between five and 10 officers. The Spaniards will 
stay in the Herzegovina area. 
  For his part, PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] 
spokesperson Solana [Spanish foreign minister], said that the 
NATO ultimatum had been successful. Now let us think about the 
next step.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin met today with Spain's 
Defense Minister Julian Vargas Garcia. The two agreed that 
Israel would upgrade Spanish tanks and planes. According to a 
Qol Yisra'el reporter accompanying the prime minister on his 
visit, the deal includes the installing of advanced electronic 
equipment in Spanish Air Force planes. 
  And the speaker of the Knesset Shevah Weiss is being 
received 
tomorrow in Tokyo by the Emperor of Japan. His hosts are being 
quoted as saying this is a special gesture and it follows what 
was called enthusiastic support in the Japanese Government for 
the Middle East peace process.

<F P=106> [Article by Louse Fleischer: "Liberal Party To Be the Main </F>
Enemy"] 
  [Text] The Social Democratic Party [SDP] during the 
election campaign leading up to the European Parliament election 
will define itself by hitting the Liberals. The Liberal Party 
will be the main enemy in the campaign leading up to the 
election set for 9 June. 
  The leading candidate for the SDP, Kirsten Jensen, 
acknowledged following a news conference at Christiansborg 
yesterday that it is the open strategy of the party to hit the 
Liberals as much as possible during the campaign. "We will try 
to confront the Liberals during the entire campaign. Because 
they are most visible. We want to meet with Liberal figures and 
debate with them at every opportunity we can arrange," said 
Jensen. 
  During the election the SDP wants to sell itself under the 
slogan "A human Europe." 
  "We will demonstrate that it makes a difference whether one 
votes nonsocialist or SDP. Social democracy stands for defending 
the national compromise [Edinburgh opt-out package]," said 
Jensen. 
  "Some people are trying to make this into a third referendum 
on Danish membership relations with the [European] Union, or a 
referendum on the Western European Union. But this is 
irrelevant," said the SDP member of the European Parliament.

<F P=106> [Heidi Borud report: "Solheim Must Enter the Arena"] </F>
  [Text] "As a socialist, I view peace and security policy 
as the most important argument in favor of Norwegian EU 
[European Union] membership," Socialist Left Party [SV] member 
Per Morken said. 
  Morken, who is the newly elected leader of the Europe 
Movement in Telemark, has fired off a powerful warning to his 
party. He points to an interview with Erik Solheim in DAGENS 
NAERINGSLIV in which the SV leader says that he is "in favor of 
pan-European cooperation in the CSCE, NATO, and also in the 
relationship between the EU and East Europe." 
  "This argument is diffuse, to put it mildly. It sounds 
completely contradictory to be in favor of 
cooperation between the EU and East Europe and at the same time 
to be against the EU," Morken said. 
  In the past the headmaster from Bo has been the leader of 
the 
Telemark SV. He is still a member of the party, but has 
resigned from all party posts because of the way the party 
leadership is tackling the EU issue. 
  [Borud] Erik Solheim has told the public that at present he 
is thinking and reading books. Should the party leader now come 
out of the isolation booth? 
  "Yes, he should come out of the isolation booth, and he 
should be making statements to which people can react; whole 
alternatives that place Norway in a European and international 
context and that react to the real world and the fact that the 
EU exists," said Morken, who hopes that the SV will follow the 
Danish Socialist People's Party and change its stance on the EU 
issue. 
  [Borud] There has been silence from the SV leadership since 
the election. 
  "Yes, it seems as if the fiasco in the election -- which was 
to a large extent due to the EU issue -- has made the leadership 
uncertain about what arguments should be used now." 
  [Borud] Has the SV engaged in the debate on the Center 
Party's terms to too great an extent? 
  "Yes, for a period to begin with, but then people realized 
that no one can beat the Center Party when it comes to dogmatic 
opposition to the EU. We as socialists must have completely 
different arguments." 
  Morken has long been calling for alternatives to the EU, but 
does not think that he has been given any satisfactory answers: 
"I have reached the conclusion that the EU is the only body 
that could be the start of something that could become 
pan-European cooperation." 
  Morken has little sympathy with those who argue 
for NATO membership, but against the EU: "This 
weakens West European influence, and we will find ourselves with 
a NATO that will be totally dominated by the United States. The 
EU is the only supranational body that has the economic and 
political weight to support the countries of East Europe. 
Security policy is something much greater than military 
capacity. The economy is of crucial importance when it comes to 
stabilizing the situation in East Europe, and this is something 
that only the EU can do," Morken said, adding a reminder about 
his socialist point of departure.

  She is to visit Zagreb, Sarajevo and the besieged city of 
Tuzla in Bosnia as well as the Macedonian capital Skopje. 
  Sweden has 15 military observers, 100 troops, six military 
police and 25 civilian police in Croatia. 
  In Bosnia, 880 Swedes are part of a battalion from 
Scandinavian countries, with 170 stationed in Sarajevo, and in 
Macedonia 250 Swedish troops back up a 700-men battalion from 
northern Europe, according to military officials here.

<F P=106> [Interview with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt by </F>
correspondent Jan Mosander in Hamburg; date not given] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Carl Bildt today discussed EU 
negotiations when he met German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
in Hamburg during the Christian Democratic Union Congress there. 
One of the questions during the meeting was the hardening 
Swedish EU membership negotiations where Spain among others has 
thrown a wrench into the works; but Carl Bildt does not want to 
talk about a crisis in the negotiations. 
  [Begin recording] [Bildt] We are on our way toward a 
decisive 
stage in the negotiations, and therefore it is natural that 
there are difficulties both when the Twelve are formulating 
their positions and tensions between the Twelve and the 
different countries seeking membership -- it can be Sweden or 
Austria or Finland or Norway depending what the questions are. 
And if we do what Helmut Kohl and I have done, we say that we 
need political strength on both sides for this to succeed, but 
we both believe that this will be managed. 
  [Mosander] Have you asked the big boys, Helmut Kohl and 
Germany, to help in pressurizing Spain? 
  [Bildt] No, I have not. But during the whole of this process 
we have had very close contacts with the German Government, as 
with other governments, and it is clear that we will do this 
also at the final stage. 
  [Mosander] You definitely believe that this will be solved 
by 
1 March? 
  [Bildt] I have great hopes that the decisive round of 
negotiations we are now entering, only now, during these days in 
Brussels, and then after that we have a meeting of Nordic 
premiers on Friday [25 February], this will lead to success, 
definitely. [end recording]

  [Text] Russia has declared that it fully supports Turkey's

perpetrated by the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist 
organization. 
  According to a statement issued by Foreign Ministry Deputy 
Spokesman Ferhat Ataman, Russian Ambassador in Ankara Albert 
Sergeyevich Chernyshev was invited to the Foreign Ministry 
following the appearance of press items regarding a PKK meeting 
to be held in Moscow. 
  Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ambassador Ozdem Sanberk 
received Chernyshev and inquired as to the truth of the items 
that appeared in the press. Replying that he will immediately 
ask Moscow to send information regarding this issue, Chernyshev 
stated that there was no question of a change in Russia's policy 
concerning Turkey. 
  Noting that Russia fully supports Turkey's territorial 
integrity and unity, Chernyshev stated that his country has 
absolutely no connections with the PKK terrorist organization, 
and added that they condemn the terrorism perpetrated by the PKK.

<F P=106> [Interview with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by Salih </F>
Zvizdic; place and date not given: "Croat-Bosniak Alliance Has 
no Alternative"] 
  [Text] Electing Tansa Ciller as prime minister of Turkey 
was important for that country, not only because she is the 
first female prime minister, but also because, by electing her, 
power was in a way transferred to the new, younger generation of 
Turkish statesmen and politicians. She took office in June 
1993, according to the decision of the influential Party of the 
Right Way. She succeeded Mr. Demirel, who became the president 
of Turkey. When he was prime minister, he appointed her 
minister of economics and accepted her slogan about "two keys" 
(for the house and the car). As minister of economics, she 
bravely tackled the large national debt, inflation, structural 
state problems, and conquering financial markets. 
  The new prime minister has very quickly shown the energy of 
the young generation and has become prominent as a radical 
reformist in many areas. She immediately replaced 17 out of 20 
members of the cabinet, and her team, which is mostly drawn from 
the young generation, has reached the very top in terms of 
service to the state. She has also launched numerous 
initiatives, especially economic ones. 
<H5>  Politician and Scholar </H5>
  She was born in 1946; she majored in economics at Robert 
College (today the Bosphorus University), the English University 
in Istanbul. She got her master's degree and her doctorate at 
New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Yale Universities. She is now 
an economics fellow at Bosphorus University and associate 
professor at all three universities in the United States. She 
has written many books on the subject of economics, and several 
research papers, articles, and essays. Her husband is an 
entrepreneur in Istanbul, and they have two children. 
  [Zvizdic] What do you think about current political 
relations between Turkey and Croatia? 
  [Ciller] Relations between Turkey and Croatia are developing 
in all areas, and I would like to use this opportunity to pay 
tribute to the late President Ozal, who visited Zagreb in 1993 
and contributed much to the development of our bilateral 
relations. President Tudjman's visit to Ankara last year was 
also a significant contribution to our friendly relations. 
  Furthermore, we would like to see Croatia cooperate with the 
Bosniaks. We think that there is no alternative to the 
Croat-Bosniak-Muslim alliance, for that alliance is a natural 
development and a historical necessity, not something imposed 
from abroad or a tactical move. If Croatia wants to stop 
Serbian aggression and the realization of a greater Serbia, 
there really is no alternative to the Croat-Bosniak-Muslim 
alliance. The progress and development of relations with Turkey 
will depend on the relation of Croatia and the Bosniaks. 
  Turkey and Croatia have much in common; first, they are both 
democratic countries, and both believe in democratic 
institutions and values. Second, they are both secular 
countries. Religion is a matter of personal choice and does not 
govern the state, and religious tolerance is most important in a 
state. And third, both countries have a free market economy 
with a process of privatization of state-owned firms. And 
lastly, let me point out that they are both European countries 
and hope to become full members of the European Community in the 
next couple of years. I am convinced that there will be joint 
Turkish-Croatian-Bosniak economic investment when conditions for 
peace and stability are re-established. 
  [Zvizdic] In Croatia, we often hear that three very capable 
ambassadors -- of Turkey, Germany, and the United States -- play 
an important role in mediation for better relations and 
understanding between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Is the 
involvement of these three ambassadors of a special kind? 
  [Ciller] You mentioned three members of NATO who are closely 
cooperating within NATO and outside it. Those three countries 
hold the same views on many problems, including the solution for 
the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina on several levels. I believe 
Germany and the United States, just like Turkey, are convinced 
that there is no alternative to cooperation and an alliance of 
Croatia and the Bosniaks. I also believe that the Turkish 
ambassador has friendly relations and closely cooperates with 
his German and U.S. counterparts. 
  [Zvizdic] What was your main reason for going to Sarajevo? 
Does it have something to do with the meeting of foreign 
ministers of Turkey and Great Britain that was held in Ankara? 
  [Ciller] My brief visit to Sarajevo with [Pakistani] Prime 
Minister Bhutto was a humanitarian gesture, for we did not go 
there primarily as prime ministers, but mostly as concerned 
mothers. We went there to share the grief, unbearable sadness, 
and incredible suffering of all the people in the besieged city, 
regardless of their religion and nationality. 
<H5>  Air Strikes or Lifting the Arms Embargo </H5>
  That tragedy in the heart of Europe in this day and age is 
incomprehensible! It is sad, for the whole world is watching 
helplessly and doing practically nothing to stop the drama with 
the means that it has at its disposal. Prime Minister Bhutto 
and myself wanted to draw the attention of the world to the 
alarming humanitarian catastrophe of Sarajevo and remind them 
that the right to live is the most important human right and 
that it must be respected. International organizations like the 
United Nations and NATO must guarantee that inalienable right to 
life, and if they cannot, the world must establish the necessary 
mechanism and unite its forces to that end. 
  What is now happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a reign of 
terror that must be unconditionally and immediately stopped. 
The entire international community is against terrorism and 
this terror against innocent people, civilians, must, of course, 
be stopped by the appropriate action. How to achieve that? 
There are two ways to stop terror and aggression: One is to 
carry out immediate air strikes against the aggressor, or, if 
the world cannot agree to that, we must lift the arms embargo so 
that the Bosnians can defend themselves. In the last two years, 
Turkey has been doing everything to reactivate the UN and NATO 
regarding the problem. We must preserve traditional values, 
principles of the international law and norms of civilized 
behavior. 
  [Zvizdic] How do you evaluate political relations between 
Turkey and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslim leadership? Do you 
think the local Muslim leadership does not take your advice with 
regard to stopping the war and finding solutions through peace 
negotiations? 
  [Ciller] Turkey is playing the role of a mediator between 
Croatia and the Bosniaks, and both sides trust our country and 
its Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. He maintains contact with 
Mr. Silajdzic and Mr. Granic, and I think they will soon meet 
again. Turkey does not offer ready-made solutions nor peace 
plans, for we do not intend to impose solutions; it is up to the 
warring factions whether they will reach an agreement or not. 
  [Zvizdic] Does Turkey's interest in the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina stem from the five-century presence of Turkey 
in the Balkans, or has Turkey, as a big country, a military 
power, and a member of NATO, been given the task, or that is, 
taken up the responsibility to help solve the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
<H5>  Union Must Be Preserved </H5>
  [Ciller] The Turkish public has been following the events in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina over n the past two years with great concern, 
and I would like to point out that some 4 million Turks are of 
Bosnian origin and still have relatives and close family ties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is happening in Bosnia is not a civil 
war, as the Serbs are trying to present it; rather, it is open 
aggression. It is an occupation by a foreign country, the 
spreading out of one ethnic group at the expense of another; it 
is imperialism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. It is not Islam 
against Christianity, nor Islamic jihad, or spreading 
fundamentalism. The right to self-defense of a country that is 
a UN member is being denied. The Turks not only have historical 
ties with the Bosnians, but also with the Croats, Macedonians, 
Albanians, and the Serbs. Historically, politically, and 
culturally, Turkey is a Balkan country. 
  [Zvizdic] In Bonn, President Tudjman offered the possibility 
of a confederal organization between the Republic of Croatia, 
the Bosniak-Muslim republic, and the Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia 
within the Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic, or just with the 
Bosniak-Muslim republic in case the union does not survive. Can 
you comment on this offer? 
  [Ciller] Turkey advocates the territorial integrity of an 
independent and sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina and we think the 
union must be preserved. Internationally recognized borders 
must be protected from this pure aggression. The multi-ethnic 
character of Bosnia-Herzegovina was once the pride of Europe 
and, if possible, it must be preserved and cherished. It is 
then up to the warring factions to decide on their future. 
  [Zvizdic] Can you comment on the politics of Croatia 
toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Ciller] Croat-Bosnian friendship and mutual trust must be 
regained and measures must be taken to that end. Croat-Muslim 
conflicts were unjustified and unnecessary. 
<H5>  Tudjman and Izetbegovic Are Friends </H5>
  [Zvizdic] Do you think the policies of the Muslim leadership 
under Mr. Izetbegovic are correct? 
  [Ciller] Mr. Alija Izetbegovic was elected president of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We trust him, and think he is a capable and 
experienced statesman. He is a friend of Turkey and, to my 
knowledge, also an old friend of President Tudjman. Turkey 
supports President Izetbegovic and his Prime Minister Silajdzic 
and their sound policies for reaching a just, honest, and 
lasting peace. 
  [Zvizdic] Could the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina end this year? 
And in the light of that, how do you evaluate the role of the 
broader international community? 
  [Ciller] The war in Bosnia has been going on for too long: 
200,000 Bosnians have lost their lives, 500,000 have been 
wounded, 1 million are in exile. A terrible price for 
preserving Bosnian independence and sovereignty. However, I 
hope this year will be the year of reconciliation, 
understanding, and peace. Many things indicate that this could 
happen, but a lasting peace can be established only if it is 
just for all parties involved. The international community is 
present throughout the peace process, but peace efforts will 
succeed only if the formula for peace is acceptable to all 
sides. Only the warring factions can establish peace, and the 
participation of the international community is here necessary, 
but it can be marginal as well.

  [Text] Istanbul, Feb 19 (A.A) -- Onur Kumbaracibasi, public 
works and housing minister, returned to Turkey from Sofia where 
he was attending a meeting held to discuss a highway project 
stretching from Albania to Turkey. 
  The Black Sea Economic Cooperation group is responsible for 
setting up the project. 
  Kumbaracibasi told reporters upon his return at Ankara's 
Esenboga Airport that the protocol of the project known as the 
West-East Corridor was signed on Friday [18 February], and that 
Bulgarian, Albanian, and Macedonian ministers participated to 
the meetings held in Sofia. 
  Italy is participating as observer. 
  The 1,000 kilometer-long highway, with its 500 km section 
between Istanbul and Sofia ready to use, will rescue Macedonia 
from its isolated position in the middle of the Balkans. 
  The corridor, which does not pass through Serbia or Greece, 
will be the main route connecting Albania to the Black and 
Aegean Seas. 
  The Bulgarian portion of the road will be financed by 
Turkey, 
and Sofia will have direct access to the Adriatic Sea and thence 
to western Europe. 
  Kumbaracibasi said the project was proposed by Turkey which 
is its greater supporter, adding it will be an advantage for 
countries with weak economies such as Albania and Macedonia.

demand to set up a mission of foreign observers to follow the

In his letter, Cindoruk noted that the decision by the European 
Parliament blatantly discriminates against the various regions 
in Turkey and ignores the maturity of democratic processes. 
Cindoruk remarked that there is no logical reason whatsoever to 
rely on observers to secure a just and free election atmosphere 
during the upcoming local elections.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has announced that the 
PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] will not be allowed to take 
shelter under the roof of the Assembly. She declared: The time 
has come to erase the fact that the PKK is being sheltered under 
the Assembly's roof. 
  Addressing the True Path Party [TPP] assembly group meeting 
today, Ciller began with the issue of Sarajevo and said that the 
result attained is a first step towards peace. She said: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] This morning I was pleased to learn 
that all heavy weapons have either been withdrawn 20 km outside 
Sarajevo, or they have been handed over to the United Nations. 
I welcome this development and the official information we were 
given. This is what should have been done a long time ago. As 
we declared during the NATO summit and in other platforms, 
especially as I personally stated during the NATO summit, it is 
possible to achieve results without bloodshed if the necessary 
force is attached to diplomatic moves. This is what was done 
here and it was possible to control the weapons in the hands of 
the Serbs or distance them 20 km outside the city without 
resorting to bloodshed or conducting any air strikes. 
  We cannot, however, consider this sufficient on its own. 
This is only the first small part of the first step towards 
peace. The problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina is very extensive and 
the same situation prevails in a series of other regions. The 
same determination must be displayed in all these other areas. 
The same approach must certainly be utilized urgently in 
Gorazde, (Zeba), Srebrenica, Tuzla, and Bihac. The same 
situation applies to these security regions. Whatever was done 
for Sarajevo must be implemented in full in these areas as well 
and under such an atmosphere, the sides must immediately sit at 
the negotiating table for a lasting solution in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We reiterate that this is a topic that 
concerns the entire world public opinion. Turkey, for its part, 
will immediately appeal for the same approach to be applied and 
for the same measures to be adopted in the other regions as 
well. I once again declare that we are by the side of the 
Bosnians and we stand by their just cause. [end recording] 
  Commenting on this morning's meeting with Catherine 
Lalumiere, secretary general of the Council of Europe, Ciller 
recounted that she clearly explained the reason for Turkey's 
determination in the struggle against terrorism. The TPP leader 
stated: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] The Council of Europe secretary 
general asked me if there was any other way to fight terrorism. 
This is what I told her clearly in return: What is this other 
way you are talking about? Our people are dying; mothers and 
children are being massacred. We are channeling the biggest 
investments in the country into this region. We are doing 
everything possible to invest in these areas and open the way to 
these investments. Moreover, our compassion for the people in 
this region is demonstrated in the force used to protect their 
lives. Despite all this, if a separatist organization in your 
country opposes investment in these regions and vows to stop it; 
if it asks for democracy, but still attempts to oust all parties 
as well as the press; if it obstructs every service designated 
for the region; and if it openly declares its goal as 
separatism, then can you ask the same question of your country? 
In other words, there is no question of what else we can do at 
a time when separatist terrorist wishes are evident. [end 
recording] 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller stressed that the government is 
exerting efforts to expand human rights and democracy not only 
to one region or as a concession to the terrorists, but to the 
entire country. Ciller noted that one matter on the public 
conscience recently is the widespread belief that the PKK is 
being sheltered under the roof of the parliament. Pointing out 
that such a thought is as disturbing for the government as it is 
for the people, the prime minister continued: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] Neither the lofty Assembly, nor the 
TPP can tolerate the PKK being sheltered by the Assembly. We 
will not allow this. If persons, whose hands are still wet with 
babies' blood, are being protected in any way by any kind of 
immunity, then this does not conform with democracy. [end 
recording] 
  Ciller declared that the immunity files concerning deputies 
who act in this way have passed from committees and have been 
referred to the Assembly. The Assembly will do whatever is 
necessary under the leadership of the TPP, Ciller underlined. 
  Ciller also criticized Democracy Party [DEP] leader Hatip 
Dicle's description of the bombing of Tuzla station as a 
consequence of war conditions. At the mention of Dicle's name, 
deputies shouted that he was a traitor. In response, Ciller 
said: That is correct. That is exactly it. 
  By targeting the young students attending the Tuzla Infantry 
School, Ciller remarked, Dicle has blatantly violated his 
parliamentary oath. Ciller said Dicle did not keep his word of 
honor given at the Assembly regarding the indivisible unity of 
the country and the nation. False actions aimed at eroding the 
state and its institutions, hiding behind parliamentary 
immunity, cannot be explained through the concept of democracy, 
Ciller added. She noted that those who act against sacred 
territories and the indivisible unity of the nation will 
certainly receive the necessary response from the state. The 
government is very determined on the matter, she declared. 
Pointing to the people's sensitivity on the subject, Ciller 
continued: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] The time has come to eliminate the 
fact that the PKK is being sheltered under the roof of the 
Assembly. Be that as it may, I would like to declare that I 
regret the bombing of the DEP headquarters in Ankara. We are 
opposed to terrorism, whatever the reasons. It is not right to 
bomb or try to achieve a goal through terrorism for any reason 
at all. Therefore, I am warning all my citizens again: Do not, 
under any circumstances, be deceived by any schemes. [end 
recording] 
  Ciller stated that the country's strength lies only in its 
unity and solidarity and asked that the necessary response be 
given to those who wish to damage this strength. 
  Referring to the Cyprus question, Ciller announced that the 
Turkish side will continue to support the confidence-building 
measures. Noting that views were exchanged last night with the 
president and prime minister of the Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus [TRNC], Ciller went on: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] I observe that the TRNC will 
continue to support the confidence-building measures. Despite 
our positive initiatives, it is clear that this matter cannot be 
concluded through our initiatives alone. As it is, Greece has 
failed to adopt a positive attitude regarding this issue despite 
the UN Security Council resolution on the subject. Similarly, 
the Greek Cypriot side has failed to display such determination. 
Furthermore, while the Turkish side accepted the principle of 
not piercing the package, the Greek Cypriots posited certain 
additional demands which actually pierce the package. This 
again demonstrates to the world our determination on the subject 
and the fact that we will not benefit from a lack of solution. 
[end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Aydogan Kilinc on Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's </F>
remarks to a parliamentary group meeting on 22 February; place 
not specified -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kilinc] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said her 
party will take the lead in lifting the immunity of DEP 
[Democracy Party] deputies. Like the interior minister, Ciller 
also described the DEP people as traitors. 
  After meeting Catherine Lalumiere, the secretary general of 
the Council of Europe, the prime minister participated in the 
meeting of her party's parliamentary group. Saying that she 
wants to draw attention to incidents that have troubled the 
public in recent days, Ciller went on to discuss the DEP 
deputies. 
  [Ciller] Neither our lofty parliament nor the True Path 
Party 
will allow the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] to take shelter 
under the roof of that lofty parliament. 
  [Kilinc] Indicating that DEP deputies are hiding behind 
their 
immunity, the prime minister added: 
  [Ciller] The decision that has passed the commissions is now 
before the lofty parliament, which will do what is necessary on 
this issue. We, the True Path Party, will take the lead on this 
issue. 
  [Kilinc] There was uproar in the hall when she addressed DEP 
leader Hatip Dicle as mister. 
  [Ciller amid shouts from the floor of: He is a traitor] Yes, 
he is a traitor. 
  [Kilinc] Ciller said that with his statement after the 
incident at Tuzla, DEP leader Hatip Dicle openly violated his 
parliamentary oath. 
  The coalition partner SHP [Social Democratic Populist Party] 
did not support the prime minister in the debate on lifting the 
immunity of the deputies from the southeast. Speaking to his 
party group meeting, SHP leader Murat Karayalcin did not express 
his views on the immunity of DEP deputies. He later replied to 
questions from Kanal-6's correspondent. Karayalcin said that 
during the voting on the report on DEP deputies, SHP deputies 
will vote according to their personal preferences. The SHP 
leader also indicated that, in principle, his party group does 
not consider it appropriate to lift immunity on political 
grounds.

  [Text] Ankara--Turkey's countdown to the March 27 local 
elections has recently been overshadowed in the Southeast by a 
massive crackdown by security forces on one of the strongest 
local candidate targets. 
  Party sources said on Tuesday [15 February] that more than 
100 members of the Kurdish-based Democracy Party (DEP) had been 
detained in the troubled region and that those arrested included 
some of DEP's possible mayoral candidates. 
  DEP deputy Sedat Yurttas said that although Turkey could 
claim that the elections were legal, it could no longer defend 
the legitimacy of the elections due to recent developments. The 
campaign on the DEP was launched late last week with 
possible--or rumored--mayoral candidates from the party being 
arrested by security forces. DEP spokesman Remzi Kartal told 
journalists on Monday that he suspected this was a systematic, 
organized campaign to prevent the DEP from entering the 
elections. Kartal explained that all three of the potential 
mayoral candidates of the DEP in Diyarbakir had already been 
detained. 
  The same day, security forces cracked down on groups of DEP 
members in Urfa's township of Viransehir, Malazgirt, Malatya, 
Diyarbakir and Istanbul. 
  Party officials said at least 30 people were detained in 
Diyarbakir while 60 more were taken into custody in Viransehir. 
Among those detained were four provincial party officials. 
Statements issued by DEP headquarters in these cities also 
claimed that a campaign was underway to prevent them from 
entering the elections. Several houses owned or rented by DEP 
executives were raided in Istanbul and their occupants were 
placed under arrest. 
  Kartal claimed that "they are trying to put us in a 
situation 
where we cannot enter the elections." 
  Meanwhile, attacks on the DEP, which a majority of Turks 
accuse of supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) 
have also increased. In the past months, several DEP buildings 
have been bombed. Monday night, the party's Ankara headquarters 
was also bombed. Last week, its general-secretary, Murat Bozlak 
was shot in Ankara. At least 50 DEP-affiliated activists, 
including a parliamentarian from Mardin, have been killed since 
1991. 
  The DEP believes the reason behind the recent campaign is to 
block its candidates and terrorize the people of the Southeast 
to prevent them from voting for this party. It also argues that 
raids on houses of its members in western parts of the country 
are due to Turkey's own concern that the party is strengthening. 
But security officials argue there is evidence to prove that, 
on many occasions, the DEP cadres under investigation have 
active links with the PKK and the party not only supports this 
organization but at times facilitates its activities. 
  Many of the raids in Istanbul, for instance, are in areas in 
which the DEP claims to be strengthening its public support, but 
where armed activities of the PKK have been concentrated. 
  On Tuesday, the mass circulation Turkish daily HURRIYET 
reported on its front page that security forces had monitored 
orders given by PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to the DEP whereby he 
demanded that the party withdrew from the elections. There are 
currently claims that the DEP is preparing, under instruction 
from the PKK, to boycott the elections altogether and boost its 
propaganda drive in Europe to cast doubts on the legitimacy of 
the results. 
  The DEP is seen as the most likely winner of local elections 
in the Southeast, not only due to popular support but to threats 
issued against the local population by PKK militants. Its major 
opponents appear to be the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) of 
Necmettin Erbakan and the paramilitary guards. Village guards 
are proposing their own tribal chiefs as candidates against the 
DEP--and the PKK. 
  If the DEP boycotts the elections, the recent round of 
persecution of its members and executives is to be used for 
propaganda purposes. The party's deputies are currently 
campaigning in Europe to bring 200 foreign observers to Turkey 
in March. 
  There are also unconfirmed reports that the pro-Kurdish 
OZGUR 
GUNDEM newspaper, a supporter of the DEP, plans to close down at 
about the same time in order to give the image that Kurdish 
rights and activities are being systematically banned in Turkey. 
  OZGUR GUNDEM, which had closed due to financial reasons in 
the past, is reportedly suffering financial problems again and 
has found it difficult to pay personnel salaries for the past 
three months.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers has decided to recommend 
to the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] to extend the 
state of emergency in force in the provinces of Batman, Bingol, 
Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli, and 
Van for another four months, effective 19 March. The Council of 
Ministers met for approximately 90 minutes under Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Yildirim Aktuna, state 
minister and government spokesman, said that the Council 
discussed the terrorist incidents that took place over the past 
10 years and the issue of extending the state of emergency in 
force in the 10 provinces for another four months. He pointed 
out that the extensive terrorist activities that began in 1984 
increased greatly up until the end of 1991. As a result of the 
measures taken by the coalition government at the time, he said, 
terrorism began to decline in 1992. The number of terrorists 
who lost their lives between 1 January and 21 February 1992 and 
1 January and 21 February 1993 amounted to 88, while 345 lost 
their lives in the first 52 days of this year, Aktuna said, 
adding: The statistics show an increase in the number of 
operations against terrorists and in the number of terrorists 
killed or captured. This is the result of the important 
decisions made by our government in fighting terrorism. 
  Aktuna pointed out that within this framework, foreign 
support for the terrorist organization has been significantly 
reduced, mobile security forces have been trained, and 
conditions have been created for the antiterrorist struggle to 
be waged effectively under harsh winter conditions. 
  Aktuna stated that the Council of Ministers, in its 
determination to safeguard security during the coming local 
elections and to end terrorism, decided to recommend to the TGNA 
to extend the state of emergency in force in the 10 provinces by 
another four months as of 19 March.

  [Text] Vienna, Feb 23 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] will probably give North Korea a few more 
days to issue visas to nuclear inspectors before sending the 
dispute to the UN Security Council, diplomatic sources said here 
Wednesday [23 February]. 
  The sources were commenting before the IAEA's board of 
governors met to discuss the row over North Korea's year-long 
refusal to allow IAEA inspectors to check sites suspected of 
containing evidence of a nuclear bomb building program. 
  If there has been no "favourable progress" by early March on 
an exact date for inspections to resume, IAEA general director 
Hans Blix should convene another meeting of the board of 
governors, which would send the issue to the Security Council to 
impose international sanctions on Pyongyang, the sources said. 
  The standoff between Pyongyang and the international 
community appeared to be over last week, when North Korea said 
it would allow inspections to resume, but there has since been a 
delay in issuing visas for the inspectors. 
  Seeking not to provoke Pyongyang, the sources here Wednesday 
avoided using the term "ultimatum." They said the new delay was 
because of bilateral U.S.-North Korean talks underway in New 
York. 
  A U.S. official said Tuesday in New York that problems 
remained between the two sides, but that the question of issuing 
visas to international nuclear inspectors was not a major 
problem. 
  Meanwhile North Korean Embassy counsellor Ho Jin Yun 
confirmed here Wednesday that his country was seeking a public 
announcement that military maneuvers between the United States 
and South Korea were being cancelled as one of its conditions 
for issuing the visas. 
  He said the other conditions were: A simultaneous 
announcement in New York of the exact date for inspections, as 
well as the date for a third round of formal negotiations 
between Washington and Pyongyang, and a date for resuming talks 
betweeen the two Koreas. 
  The official repeated however that a "special inspection" of 
two sites at Yongbyon, 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of 
Pyongyang, where the IAEA suspects liquid and solid nuclear 
waste -- evidence of a military nuclear program -- is stored, 
was "out of the question." 
  Inspections would be limited to seven nuclear sites which 
North Kora has declared under an inspection agreement within the 
framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Andreas </F>
Unterberger; place and date not given: "`Somebody Will Always 
Have To Work for Europe'"] 
  [Text] [Unterberger] What is the absolute condition 
without which Austria cannot join the European Union [EU]? 
  [Mock] Things like the agricultural quota and reference 
quantities, price adjustments, transition periods, farmers in 
mountainous regions. Something will certainly have to be done 
in these fields. 
  [Unterberger] Will you resign if the negotiations fail or 
the referendum produces a negative result? 
  [Mock] I will resign if I make a serious mistake, if I come 
into conflict with legal rules, or if I do something that is 
against the interests of the Republic. But as long as I have 
the opportunity to work for the idea of Europe, I will do 
everything I can to implement the idea. 
  [Unterberger] But in the event of a no in the referendum, 
this opportunity will no longer be there. 
  [Mock] Still, there will be some people who will continue to 
work for the idea. It is right that those who think there will 
be another chance to join the EU in a year's time are taking a 
very unlikely position. The fact is that such a chance will not 
be there for the next five to 20 years. 
  Two or three years ago saw the beginning of a period in 
which 
the climate for European integration seems to have worsened. 
You can see this in France, Germany, England. The disappearing 
of the danger from the East seems to have resulted in a 
resurgence of nationalism. This means that the chance of 1996 
seeing a deepening of Europe is slim. Then those who take 
integration seriously, such as the Benelux countries, will say: 
We cannot force a deepening, but we can prevent a widening. 
Those that are outside then will have to wait until the former 
communist countries are accepted as well. 
  [Unterberger] How do you explain to the average Austrian why 
Austria should join the EU? 
  [Mock] First, because integration is the first practical 
experience of a peace construction in Europe that stands a 
chance of becoming reality if it is practiced by one or two 
generations -- everybody should remember their own family's fate 
during World War II. 
  Second, because it provides a higher degree of security -- 
one can see what happens from Zhirinovskiy to the Balkans. 
  And third, because Austria should be able to have an equal 
say in this unique construction. I do not want to have a 
second-class country. I want equal opportunities for the 
country, security for the country, and peace for Europe. 
  [Unterberger] Economic arguments are less important? 
  [Mock] They are very important, but they take second place. 
  [Unterberger] Following the events of the past few weeks, 
will the federal president still be playing the same role in 
European integration as he did in the past? 
  [Mock] I think that he has kept his political weight, which 
is based on his experience and his political talent, even if 
some people criticize the tragic development of events. But the 
majority of Austrians can distinguish between the president's 
private problems and his political activities. 
  [Unterberger] How deep is the rift between you and Vice 
Chancellor Busek? He no longer seems to believe that the EU 
negotiations will be completed by the end of March; he has 
suggested establishing a Ministry for European Affairs; there 
were similar differences of opinion during the days of the 
crisis around the president and on the position toward the 
Freedom Party [FPOe]. 
  [Mock] For my part the relationship is tension free. But 
there is certainly a political difference: I have always been 
opposed to excluding the FPOe. As long as a member of the 
opposition plays by the rules of democracy -- with however much 
demagogy -- he has a right to be treated as a democrat. 
  This is an old Socialist trick: If the Freedom Party 
cooperates with us, they are old Nazis; if, however, they 
cooperate with the Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], 
they are converted democrats. I do not really blame them for 
playing this trick, because politics is a bit primitive. It is 
when I let myself be conned that I am annoyed. But still, I 
formed this grand coalition, and I think that it has addressed 
many fundamental matters over the past two years: 
privatization, reform of the railroads, tax reform. This 
justifies its existence. 
  [Unterberger] You are sometimes said to be aiming higher, 
such as the office of federal president. 
  [Mock] There is no truth in these speculations. I was 
repeatedly asked that question before the last elections, and I 
always said no. 
  [Unterberger] There are fresh discussions about arms exports 
to Saudi Arabia. 
  [Mock] It is not so much a matter of arms deals as a matter 
of no longer rating the country as a tension zone. The 
situation was judged differently within the government a year 
and a half ago. This has now been brought up again by the Saudis. 
  [Unterberger] Is it not also a matter of human rights? 
  [Mock] There are two issues involved: a tension zone and 
human rights. The situation of human rights has always been the 
same there; it is an authoritarian-feudal state. I am having 
all this examined now. I think, however, that the tensions have 
been decreased since Iraq has been keeping to the rules of the 
UN Security Council and since the agreement between 'Arafat and 
Israel has come into existence.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dragan Momcilovic, charge d'affaires at the </F>
Embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FRY, by Edouard 
Van Velthem; place and date not given: "The Yugoslav Point of 
View on the Conflict in Bosnia Herzegovina"] 
  [Text] [Van Velthem] Three days before NATO's ultimatum 
expires, how do the Yugoslav authorities see the situation 
around Sarajevo? 
  [Momcilovic] I am relatively optimistic. According to 
General Rose himself, the situation is developing favorably on 
the ground and calm continues to reign around Sarajevo. In any 
case, as General Briquemont has already said, it is not possible 
to resolve the Bosnian crisis by military means. Mr. Karadzic 
has moreover made it known that he is ready to withdraw his 
heavy weapons on condition that the Bosnian Muslim Army does the 
same. That is what is required by the NATO decision in points 
six and seven. 
  The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] admits that the Muslims 
are trying to profit from the situation and their army's chief 
of staff refused to take part in the three-sided meeting with 
his Serbian counterpart and General Cot. 
  [Van Velthem] Is the FRY putting pressure on the Bosnian 
Serbs? 
  [Momcilovic] Mr. Karadzic, who regularly visits Belgrade, of 
course remains in contact with the federal authorities. We are 
doing what we can to favor a peaceful outcome to the crisis. 
  [Van Velthem] What if the air strikes go ahead? 
  [Momcilovic] It is difficult to make predictions on the 
subject. Of course, in the FRY, there is a normal and 
legitimate interest in the fate of the Bosnian and Croatian 
Serbs. If Benazir Bhutto can come 10,000 kilometers to discuss 
the fate of the Bosnian Muslims, why can't the Serbs, their 
immediate neighbors, also take an interest in their own brothers. 
  [Van Velthem] The FRY supports the European peace plan for 
Bosnia. Does that include the respect of administrative borders 
that are internationally recognized? 
  [Momcilovic] NATO's recent decision refers explicitly to the 
European plan. It is therefore a solid basis for the United 
States as well as for the Twelve. But what do we see in 
reality? The Serbs accepted this plan two whole months ago, 
respecting the territorial concessions requested in favor of the 
Muslims --one third of the country. Only the authorities in 
Sarajevo have refused this document. Will Washington's 
intervention in the peace process persuade the Muslims to accept 
this plan? That is the main question being asked today. It is 
true that there are a few points that have yet to be answered, 
such as Muslim access to the Adriatic coast and to the Save. 
The important thing, however, is to put an end to the war, and 
then we can negotiate in detail the issues that remain 
unresolved. 
  [Van Velthem] But Mr. Karadzic has said that his aim is 
annexation to Serbia. 
  [Momcilovic] It is too early to envisage such a hypothesis 
before a lasting peace is imposed on Bosnia. Firstly, we should 
settle all the questions raised by the hasty recognition of the 
former Yugoslav republics. The international community -- and 
President Mitterrand has admitted this -- committed a serious 
mistake when it based its decision on the internal borders born 
out of communism, without taking into account the status of 
minority groups and the distribution of rights between the three 
communities. 
  [Van Velthem] If NATO's requirements are satisfied, will the 
FRY try to take advantage of this to obtain the lifting of the 
embargo? 
  [Momcilovic] The peace negotiations do not concern just 
Sarajevo but are related to the whole process, including the UN 
sanctions. It is clear that if the first step is accomplished 
with a peaceful solution being found for Sarajevo, then 
naturally the issue of lifting the sanctions will have to be 
considered. All the more so, since after 24 months of sanctions 
the shortage of goods is becoming very trying for the civilian 
population of the FRY. In addition, they have to support half a 
million refugees. 
  [Van Velthem] Precisely, is Yugoslav public opinion still 
caught up in the events in Bosnia, or has economic survival now 
become the priority? 
  [Momcilovic] The Serbs are always interested in everything 
that affects them directly. In total, in both world wars, we 
lost more than four million of our people standing up to fascism. 
  We want just one thing: To be able to live together, in 
peace, without being considered minorities. You should not 
forget the demography of the Balkans: More than 10 million 
Serbs as opposed to five million Croats, and two million 
Muslims. Why should we accept being split up into three states? 
We are a single people vital to stability in this region. 
  [Van Velthem] Zagreb and Belgrade have reopened their 
dialogue with mutual diplomatic representation. However, 
nothing has been settled in Krajina. 
  [Momcilovic] It is up to the authorities in Zagreb and 
Krajina to define among themselves what their future relations 
will be. For us, in the current situation, the first steps are 
all-important. The normalizing of relations between the FRY and 
Croatia is a step in this direction: Restoring communications, 
rebuilding the economic fabric, and reestablishing bilateral 
trade are major initiatives since they illustrate how we used to 
complement each other before the war. 
  This is the path we must take in the future. All of our 
destinies, the fate of the former Yugoslav peoples, lies with 
cooperation and coexistence, not in permanent confrontation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Martinazzoli Tells Berlusconi: `The </F>
People Are Not Merely an Audience'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Between a left with no identity and "a lucky 
businessman," only the center can prevent the return to "a 
little Italy" and "enable the country to come into line with the 
democratic Europe." [Italian Popular Party ,PPI, Secretary] 
Mino Martinazzoli, in an editorial appearing in today's IL 
POPOLO, takes issue chiefly with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi, albeit without naming him. 
  "We are in a political desert," he writes, "which encourages 
the emergence of improbable demagogues and the resistible rise 
(or, rather, the resistible decline, as we say) of dubious 
saviors." To those "who want some order and certainty and who 
are scandalized by political corruption" and want "to entrust 
politics to those who have shown that they can manage their own 
affairs properly," Martinazzoli points out that "political 
responsibility isn't limited to the individual, but includes 
others, and requires a mature awareness of the common good." 
"The people," he writes, "are not merely an audience and do not 
deserve misleading messages" and "magic words." 
  Next Martinazzoli expands his criticism and attacks "the 
supposed new faces which are often no more than masks." He also 
addresses the voters of the progressive alignment to "appeal for 
a return to common sense on the part of those who are rightly 
aware of the disingeniousness and dangers of a left which, 
without being able to say what it now stands for, presumes to 
occupy a stronger position only because it swears that it is no 
longer the same as before." 
  The PPI leader asks whether current Italian politics "is 
moving in the opposite direction from what the country's 
interests require" and whether it is possible that "the `chaotic 
innovation' that has emerged, nurtured by decadence, is not the 
solution, but its final decline." "It is not only possible," the 
PPI secretary says, "but highly likely, unless the Italian 
people are helped to find a capacity for critical judgment and 
reflection." 
  Martinazzoli speaks in terms of a "decline of a political 
vision" and of the "invasiveness of a disastrous mystification, 
incapable even of realistically representing the difficulties 
affecting our national community." "The formulas that we hear," 
he explained, "are only magic words, rashly used." His final 
wish is this: "What we do not want the Italian people to be 
reduced to measuring their political time on a clock with no 
hands."

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Commentaries and editorials in several 
Italian dailies have discussed the merit of the various 
coalitions running in the parliamentary elections, which will be 
held on 27-28 March. Press views have ranged across the 
political spectrum, but most dailies have been critical of the 
decision by television magnate Silvio Berlusconi to enter the 
race with a new party, Forza Italia. 
<H5>  CORRIERE DELLA SERA Opts for Center </H5>
  In a 30 January front-page editorial in the Milan daily 
CORRIERE DELLA SERA, editor in chief Paolo Mieli supported 
centrist forces in the election against "those who...preach the 
need to break up the center and the formation of two opposing 
blocs" on the right and the left. Mieli wrote that what is 
needed now is for the parties to express "clear policy lines," 
especially toward the economy and institutional reform. The 
voters expect the centrists, especially the Italian Popular 
Party (PPI), to explain clearly whether they will go into 
opposition or try to form a government coalition should they--as 
is more than likely--not receive a majority of seats in the 
election. The moderate wing of the left, particularly the 
Democratic Alliance and some factions of the Democratic Party of 
the Left (PDS), should also clearly state whether it will 
include the PPI in any government it would form after an 
election victory, Mieli continued. The government options 
offered to the electorate should be transparent, and those 
parties which have formed alliances for the elections should 
remain together after the election and agree on a choice for 
prime minister, Mieli concluded. 
  Writer, journalist, and television commentator Arrigo Levi's 
commentary in the 29 January CORRIERE DELLA SERA rejects the 
polarization of the political spectrum into left and right 
blocs. The many politicians and commentators who advocate such 
a division claim that it is the best way to prevent the 
government from falling into the hands of communists, 
reactionaries, or separatists, Levi wrote. However, a two-bloc 
election would not provide a political home for the many voters 
of the center who want change but also wish to preserve what was 
good about the old system. According to Levi, such voters would 
be forced to support "unacceptable" partners in both 
blocs--ex-fascists, neocommunists, opportunists such as Forza 
Italia, dogmatists such as the Rete, or groups with "obscure 
intentions" for Italy such as the Northern League. After the 
elections, Levi predicted, both blocs will lose their cohesion 
because of the incompatibility of the component groups. The 
effectiveness of the new government will, consequently, be 
impaired. Levi asks why a center bloc, small but politically 
homogeneous, should not participate in the race. In an election 
that Levi views as part of a larger political transition, some 
"moderate and progressive" parties would do better to run on 
their own rather than as part of heterogeneous coalitions. 
  Regular CORRIERE DELLA SERA commentator Angelo Panebianco 
noted in the 27 January edition that Silvio Berlusconi's entry 
into the political arena was a gift for the leftist coalition 
because Berlusconi provides the left with a "boogey man" to 
attack during the electoral campaign. In addition, Berlusconi's 
entry fragments the liberal-moderate forces, including the PPI, 
already weakened by the refusal of Northern League leader 
Umberto Bossi to join forces with it. Finally, the entry into 
politics of television magnate Berlusconi has rallied the 
journalists of the state-owned RAI television networks behind 
the PDS, causing intense controversy over public television's 
political objectivity. 
  Commentator Ernesto Galli Della Loggia observed that 
Berlusconi's decision to enter politics to defend the moderate 
forces is an indication of the confusion reigning among those 
who identify with those forces. Berlusconi "thinks he is the 
doctor when in fact he is the disease," Galli Della Loggia wrote 
in CORRIERE DELLA SERA of 26 January. 
<H5>  LA REPUBBLICA Favors Left </H5>
  Alberto Cavallari, former editor for CORRIERE DELLA SERA and 
currently a regular contributor to the Rome daily LA REPUBBLICA, 
has suggested that he saw "nostalgia" developing among 
conservative parties "for 1948 "--a time when the left was 
attacked by the right to prevent a change in the government. In 
the 3 February LA REPUBBLICA, Cavallari characterized the 
current political situation as the formation of a "cartel" by 
eight leftist parties followed by the formation of an opposing 
coaltion by eight rightist parties in response. If the center's 
objective is the same as that of the right--that is, to destroy 
the left--then the center, Cavallari maintained, inevitably 
becomes a part of the right. In fact, what unites the eight 
rightist parties is a 1948-style anticommunism. These parties 
act as if nothing changed in 1989 and as if the Italian left is 
a variant of Soviet communism. Cavallari asked rhetorically 
whether it would not be better to "utilize" the crisis created 
by the decline of the Socialist and Christian Democratic 
parties, and of international communism, to try a system that 
allows for alternating governments, instead of returning to the 
old center-right, center-left alliances which have governed 
Italy since 1947. 
  In a 27 January LA REPUBBLICA commentary, Ermanno Gorrieri, 
former Christian Democrat and currently an official of the newly 
founded leftist Social Christian movement (part of the 
Progressive Alliance headed by the PDS) thanked Northern League 
leader Umberto Bossi for the latter's rejection of an electoral 
pact with the PPI. Had the PPI joined the center-right 
coalition, the drift to the right of many PPI members would have 
been "a disaster," Gorrieri maintained. He characterized the 
PPI's intention to form a centrist coalition in opposition to 
both the right and the left as "worrisome." This decision, 
intended to safeguard the Catholic presence in politics, in fact 
weakens the center. Under the new electoral system, parties 
will be forced to form alliances to survive, Gorrieri wrote. 
The PPI's insistence on running alone condemns it to a smaller 
representation in Parliament. While many believe that the PPI 
needs to be in the opposition for a while, Gorrieri asks whether 
lay Catholics should give up their responsibility to help face 
the upcoming challenges. That is why the Social Christian 
movement was created: to organize left-leaning Catholics within 
the Progressive Alliance. Gorrieri concludes by claiming the 
Social Christians have gathered significant numbers of PPI 
members who do not support PPI chairman Mino Martinazzoli or 
former Christian Democrat Mario Segni. 
  In a 24 January front-page editorial criticizing 
Berlusconi's 
entry into politics, LA REPUBBLICA editor in chief Eugenio 
Scalfari also criticizes Segni for trying to bridge the 
ideological distance between his Pact for Italy and the PPI on 
the one hand, and the Northern League and Forza Italia on the 
other. Segni did not understand that the ideologies of the two 
groups are too far apart, Scalfari wrote. He is still trying to 
align the Pact not only with the League and Forza Italia, but 
also with the National Alliance. According to Scalfari, the 
latter three parties are planning for a League election victory 
in the North and a National Alliance victory in the South, with 
Forza Italia as the "glue" holding the group together. Scalfari 
warns that this is a strong alliance with the means to 
manipulate public opinion. 
<H5>  LA STAMPA Critical of PDS </H5>
  Editor in chief Ezio Mauro asked for "clarity" from the 
leftist Progressive Alliance in a 2 February editorial in the 
Turin LA STAMPA. Commenting on the formation of the Alliance 
the previous day, Mauro wrote that in Italy it is easier to call 
oneself progressive than conservative and the leftist alliance's 
choice of the word "progressive" allows for a broader and less 
exacting definition than the concept of "the left." The word 
"progressive" makes no distinctions within the alliance and can 
also appeal to voters from the center. It is a label that 
avoids having to account for the past actions of socialism and 
communism, Mauro wrote. Italy needs a left, but only a European, 
western, and noncommunist left, Mauro argued. Thus it is 
important that the left explain which of the old policies it is 
willing to give up and which it is continuing to promote. 
However, it has instead refused to identify with its history 
because that would limit the number of potential electoral 
allies. This failure by the left to address its history has 
allowed Berlusconi to tag it as "communist," Mauro maintained. 
The various groups within the Progressive Alliance should 
confront each other, knowing that there will be 
disagreement--and the PDS, as the leading party in the Alliance, 
should decide in which direction it is heading and who the 
Alliance candidates for prime minister and other government 
posts will be if it wins the elections, Mauro advised. 
  University professor Gianni Vattimo, in a 30 January LA 
STAMPA commentary, criticized the PDS's belief that after the 
elections it can form a governing coalition with the PPI. Such 
an arrangement would destroy any hope of a radical renewal of 
the Italian political system, Vattimo wrote, and would be 
nothing more than a return to the old corrupt political schemes. 
Vattimo wrote that the PDS's two leaders, Achille Occhetto and 
Massimo D'Alema, pretend not to understand that the PPI's 
Martinazzoli is saying very clearly he does not want to ally 
with them. While the PDS promises a postelection 
"governability" derived from an alliance with the PPI, it is 
going ahead with plans to form an election alliance with 
Communist Renewal and the Rete--parties which, Vattimo wrote, 
are to function as election allies but are supposed to disappear 
when the time comes to form the PDS-PPI government coalition. 
Citizen enthusiasm in Italy's "Second Republic" will wane if 
the left and Martinazzoli's center lose their separate 
identities, Vattimo concluded. 
<H5>  IL MESSAGERO Favors PPI Running Alone </H5>
  Giulio Anselmi predicted that despite all forecasts to the 
contrary, Italy will not be able to adapt to a bipolar political 
system. Anselmi, editor in chief of the Rome daily IL 
MESSAGGERO, maintained in a 30 January commentary that the PPI 
has emerged as the third bloc in Italian politics. Berlusconi, 
who is using his influence to bring the League and the National 
Alliance together, is opposing the PPI, and Anselmi wonders 
which of the two groups will fight the PDS for control of the 
country. Berlusconi says he is the only true anticommunist in 
the race, because after the elections Martinazzoli will offer 
his support to the probable leftist winner, Anselmi wrote. 
However, by refusing to present himself as "anti-anything" and 
clearly distinguishing himself from the National Alliance, the 
League, and the PDS, Martinazzoli is the only candidate to have 
retained some credibility, according to Anselmi. Martinazzoli 
has the support of the pope and the Church in their call for 
Catholics to remain united, preferably in one party. Amselmi 
wrote that Martinazzoli deserves credit for having resisted the 
temptation to transform the PPI into something totally different 
from the old Christian Democratic Party (DC) and for having 
weathered the breaking away of the party's right wing. His PPI 
offers the moderate voter a choice other than the left or the 
right. 
  In comparing the rightist and leftist coalitions, 
commentator 
Angelo Bolaffi noted that League chief Bossi's plan to pose as 
the only true anti-PDS force has been spoiled by the similar 
line taken by the National Alliance and Forza Italia. The 
bickering that took place among the leftist coalition partners 
for the placement of candidates is being duplicated in the 
rightist coalition, but the discord on the right is worse 
because of the great divergence in the political ideologies of 
the League and the National Alliance. Efforts at forming a 
coalition could backfire, forcing League and National Alliance 
voters against each other to the benefit of Berlusconi, who 
would once again show his exceptional business ability in 
"speculating" with the votes of others, Bolaffi concluded (LA 
STAMPA 1 February). 
<H5>  IL SOLE--24 ORE Defends Berlusconi </H5>
  The Milan financial daily IL SOLE--24 ORE was the only 
monitored newspaper to defend Berlusconi's decision to enter 
politics. An unsigned editorial on 29 January states that while 
the benefits of having a media millionaire like Berlusconi enter 
politics is debatable, Berlusconi's person and program should 
not be "criminalized." Berlusconi's opponents, the editorial 
continues, should remember that just a few years ago the League 
was ridiculed in much of the press for the crudeness of its 
language and leader. After the last elections, however, it 
became clear how deeply entrenched the League was in society. 
Berlusconi is introducing a liberal culture which has never 
taken hold in Italian politics, the editorial maintained. 
Although the League has also been expounding liberalism, it has 
been accepted only in the North. Segni's waverings and the 
distancing of many Catholics from his policies is leading many 
voters to see Berlusconi as someone who can open a debate on 
issues of interest to people both in the North and the South, 
such as lowering taxes, easing fiscal regulations, improving the 
administrative system, and safeguarding public security. Other 
parties, especially the leftist parties, should express clear 
opinions on these issues, the editorial concludes.

  [Text] The European Investment Bank (EIB), the long-term 
financing institution of the European Union, yesterday signed 
the documents in Athens for its first Greek Drachma bond issue 
for 10 billion drachmas (about $40 million). 
  EIB announced yesterday that the drachma issue is "timed to 
coincide with the move of the Greek capital market toward full 
liberalisation." 
  This is the first ever Greek-drachma denominated bond issued 
by a non-resident issuer, as well as the first-term debt drachma 
security carrying a fixed interest rate. The bond, underwritten 
by some 20 Greek and foreign banks, is co-financed by Hellenic 
Industrial Development Bank (ETVA). Underwriting banks include 
ABN-AMRO, Paribas, Barclays, Bayerische, BNP, Citibank, 
Dresdner, Natwest, and Midland. 
  The issue is for a five-year term, due on 8 March 1999, and 
carries a coupon of 17.5 percent. Bonds will be issued in 
bearer form in denominations of one million, five million, 10 
million and 50 million drachmas. Applications will be made to 
list the titles on the Athens and Luxembourg stock exchanges. 
  Luxembourg-based EIB notes that it will henceforth "be 
better 
placed to continue developing its lending in Greece, by matching 
closer the funding needs of Greek project promoters."

<F P=106> [Article by "bag": "Aid From Bonn Didn't Arrive in Eastern </F>
Communities--East's Cities Allotted Three Times the Capital 
Funding of Western Ones"] 
  [Text] In 1993, east German municipalities were able to 
reduce their personnel expenditures by about 2.5 percent, 
despite salary increases and alignment with salaries in western 
Germany. This year, they hope to maintain personnel costs at the 
level of 19.5 billion German marks (DM). 
  Early in 1993, personnel costs in the east German 
municipalities were still expected to increase, but this did not 
happen because many incorporated towns reduced the number of 
employees at a rate faster than had been anticipated. According 
to a report on municipal finances by the Deutsche Staedtetag 
(DST) [Congress of Municipal Authorities], positions were cut 
primarily at social facilities, particularly day care centers 
for children. The DST does not anticipate any further salary 
alignments beyond the present 80 percent of salaries in western 
Germany. The east German municipalities anticipate per capita 
personnel costs of DM1,355 or 136 percent of similar costs in 
western Germany, as heretofore. 
  In all, east German municipalities have budgeted DM62 
billion 
in expenditures for 1994, an increase of 4.5 percent. They 
anticipate revenues of DM56.5 billion, an increase of 5 percent 
which represents a DM5.5. billion deficit equal to that in 1993. 
  In 1993, the "German Unity" fund, one of the primary sources 
of income of the east German laender and municipalities, was 
increased by DM3.7 billion. The DST criticizes the fact that 40 
percent of these funds were not turned over to the east German 
municipalities as required by law, but instead were given to the 
new laender for already planned allocations. This also applies 
to the DM1.5 billion government investment fund. 
  Expected tax revenue of DM5.8 billion for 1994 is likely to 
equal just 30 percent of the west German level. This is due 
primarily to the fact that per capita small-business tax revenue 
is equal to only 15 percent of that collected by west German 
municipalities. In the case of income tax revenue and real 
estate taxes, the corresponding ratios are 35 and 53 percent 
respectively. 
  The report notes a slight increase in current allocations 
(DM24 billion) and no change in investment allocations at DM9 
billion. Current allocations per capita in 1994 are almost twice 
as high, and investment allocations are three times higher than 
in western Germany. Estimated income from fees and other charges 
is expected to decline to 6 percent from the sharp increase of 
16.1 percent in 1993. 
  The cities and towns in the new laender are planning for a 
5-percent increase in current material costs. Expenditures for 
social services are expected to rise sharply (71 percent) but 
will still be appreciably lower than in western Germany. The DST 
fears that social welfare, the lion's share of social 
expenditures, will become the "explosive issue in the government 
budgets" of the new laender during the next few years as it has 
elsewhere. 
  In contrast to 1993, east German fiscal experts believe that 
expenditures will grow at a higher rate than revenue this year. 
As a consequence, eastern Germany's own potential for investment 
will be reduced and, since more substantial federal and laender 
subsidies are not expected, they fear it will be impossible to 
match the high rate of investment of years past. This year 
investments will total DM18 billion, as against DM18.5 billion 
in 1993. But in view of the "accelerated decline in investments" 
by municipalities in western Germany, per capita expenditures 
for construction in eastern Germany will be twice as high as in 
the west. 
  After 1994, the east German laender will receive 
substantially higher transfer payments from the augmented 
"German Unity" fund of the old laender, since they will be 
included in the laender financial redistribution program and 
will also be receiving supplementary federal aid as of 1995. In 
addition, as provided under investment aid legislation for 
eastern reconstruction, they will be getting more than DM6.6 
billion. 
  In contrast to the legislation governing the "German Unity" 
fund (which calls for allocating 40 percent to the 
municipalities), it is up to the land governments to decide how 
to share the substantially increased income with the 
municipalities. The DST calls for retaining the 40-percent 
quota. After all, the west German municipalities are also 
required to contribute 40 percent of the transfer payments.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Winfried Muenster: "No New Division of </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] Europe is getting wider, not deeper. The partner 
states of the European Union [EU] adopted the Maastricht Treaty 
with great noise and much ado. The treaty continues to create 
controversy to this day. Yet in the next few weeks, the 
Community of Twelve is preparing to change its face even more: 
almost beyond recognition, some fear. Nevertheless, this is 
taking place without much fuss. 
  By the end of the month the enlargement negotiations with 
Finland, Norway, Austria, and Sweden should -- or have to -- be 
concluded, so that these four EFTA [European Free Trade 
Association] countries can join the EU at the beginning of next 
year. The Community will thus not only grow to 16 members but 
rather follow a guiding star into the future. The Community of 
the six founding states was still characterized by the war, 
which taught them that political thinking free of illusions must 
lead to integration, the common base for national sovereignty if 
the danger of war is to be banned once and for all. The current 
Club of Twelve is dominated by romantic solidarity thinking: 
All for one, especially the North for the South. It is France 
and the Mediterranean countries that are keeping up the flag of 
integration, and it would be unfair to surmise that they were 
only interested in political or economic net balances. 
"Deepening (the Community) before (its) enlargement," is the 
motto, with which Commission President Jacques Delors wanted to 
prevent new members from throttling the pace on the path "toward 
an ever closer union." 
  Yet, this is exactly what cannot be avoided. In theory, the 
character of the Community must not be significantly changed by 
the fact that it becomes larger. Apart from a few restrictions, 
the governments of the four membership candidates have readily 
accepted the treaty, on the basis of which the Community 
functions, even including the future project of joint foreign, 
security, and defense policy. It would be naive, however, to 
assume that the mentality of the current Twelve would remain 
unaffected by the arrival of such self-willed nations as the 
Nordic ones. The Swedes and Norwegians are more than capable of 
doing what the Danes could, who initially rejected the 
Maastricht Treaty. In a union of 15 or 16, a new -- at least 
relative -- majority will emerge, which, despite all loyalty to 
the Community, will instinctively try to prevent any more powers 
being shifted to Brussels. 
<H5>  Minimum of Consensus </H5>
  In doing so, it will not even have to try very hard, 
because, 
one thing is, that the enlargement of the Union is providing the 
ground for its extension to the East. One can bet that the 
Poles, Hungary, and the two successor states to Czechoslovakia 
will join the Union earlier than the Germans are hoping and the 
French would like. In a Community of 20 or even more highly 
differing sovereign states, the federalists will probably have 
to forget their ideas of a European federal state for another 
generation. Edmund Stoiber does not even have to try so hard. 
Even in the Community of the Twelve the minimum consensus is 
hardly ever achieved. 
  The other thing is that one must not forget that all has 
gotten into a phase of economic decline. The times in which a 
generous America provided security cheaply and the standard of 
living increased as if by a natural law are over for the moment. 
In such times, loyalty to the European idea quickly changes 
into concern for one's pocket. From the negotiators of the 
Nordic entry candidates one can easily gather anyway that what 
makes the Union attractive for them is the single market, while 
they accept the remaining "achievements" of the work of European 
unification, specifically its agricultural policy and the 
subsidy fund, rather as ballast. After all, Finland has lost 
parts of its vital markets in the East. 
<H5>  Unworthy Game </H5>
  The four membership candidates thus, consistently argue that 
the difference between membership in the Union and the "European 
Economic Area" (EEA), to which they already belong, is that it 
is not important to have the single market but to sit at the 
table of the Council of Ministers in Brussels and to have a say 
in how this market is created and shaped. Only Norway -- 
because of its rich fishing grounds and energy resources -- does 
not really need it, which makes Union immediately look less 
attractive. Even the Austrians might be deterred if they have 
to vote on it in a referendum in June, perhaps tired of the 
really unworthy game to which it has been subjected by Brussels? 
Its application for membership reached Brussels five years ago, 
when it was denigrated as an attempt at a new "Anschluss" via 
Europe's front door. 
  Because of this long waiting time alone, which is a 
disgrace for the EU, it is necessary to conclude the entry 
negotiations in the next few rounds. Failure to do so would not 
be proof of big problems of substance but of the fact that a 
strong faction within the Twelve continues to believe that it 
can preserve a Europe as deeply integrated as possible, in which 
the center of gravity would still lie in Paris and Germany would 
remain a border country. So one has to say that 28 February 
will necessarily have to be the deadline, since some candidates 
will otherwise be unable to ratify their accession in time. In 
Sweden, for example, Parliament must hold two votes, with the 
second one having to take place at least six months after the 
first and with a new election of Parliament in the meantime. 
Not forgetting the European Parliament, which should be asked 
for support before it is dissolved in late spring for 
reelection. The candidates are pressing for accession on 1 
January 1995, when the process of revising the Maastricht Treaty 
will start, in which they quite rightly want to participate. 
  Such pressure of time is, of course, enticing for the 
opponents of enlargement, which is why they are tightening this 
screw. Asking the four candidates to reduce the prices for 
their agricultural prices overnight to Community level, that is 
to say by up to 40 percent, instead of granting them the 
traditional transition periods looks like a nasty trick. This 
is how one can paralyze the talks and nourish the hope that, in 
the referendum, the scales will here and there tend toward a no. 
  Yet, these obstructionists will ultimately not gain the 
upper 
hand. The Community needs the economically strong EFTA 
countries if it wants to shoulder the burden that is approaching 
from the East. This is, at the same time, Germany's special 
cause, and France knows that it has to put aside its idea of an 
integrated Europe for the time being and give priority to these 
interests to prevent Germany from feeling left in the lurch. 
After all, the partners in Bonn and Paris are in agreement that 
Europe must not be divided again on the fine-selection for EU 
membership. A lot can be achieved on the basis of this 
agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by Dietrich Zwaetz: "Words and Action"] </F>
  [Text] It honors the U.S. Administration that after the 
new failure of the trade talks with Japan, it is taking another 
30 days to reflect on possible punitive duties on U.S. imports 
from Japan. It is also to Washington's credit that despite the 
20 years of futile negotiations, it does not want to start a 
trade war. 
  If sanctions were to be imposed against Japan, then these 
should only refer to one marginal event: the breaking of the 
1989 agreement which reserved 33-50 percent of the cordless 
telephone market in Tokyo to the U.S. firm Motorola. 
Eventually, the Americans received only 5 percent. 
  Maybe Tokyo will take this last threat from Washington 
seriously. Maybe Japan's border barriers will not go up for cars 
and car parts, computers, telephone systems, medical equipment, 
and insurance companies from the United States. It is more 
likely that Tokyo has once more gained time -- and the United 
States is once more using the threat to impose sanctions in 
vain. Such actions wear off, even if U.S. trade delegate Mickey 
Kantor has announced the reactivation of the ill-famed Article 
301 of the 1988 Trade Law, under which the United States claims 
the powers of an international trade policeman. 
<H5>  Irresolute International Trade Policeman </H5>
  The surprising element in the U.S. position is its 
irresolution, the apparent gap between words and action. If 
Washington really were to regard Japan's $58 billion in trade 
surplus with the United States as intolerable, and if Tokyo 
fails to fulfill concessions it made and draws out negotiations 
over decades, which is what the Americans think, then the threat 
to impose sanctions must not remain pure tongue lashing. 
  Then Kantor must encourage his President in the White House 
to finally let action follow the many words, tragic as this 
would be for free international trade and the atmosphere in the 
GATT. Yet Kantor, who has been described as a "tough fellow," 
has again and again proved to be a hesitater and, in this 
manner, he is gaining very little for his country. 
<H5>  Put Credibility at Stake </H5>
  Meanwhile, in their trade talks with Japan, American 
politicians only experience what they themselves are doing to 
other countries -- for example the FRG in the air transport 
negotiations. Washington's negotiators probably only laugh 
about German threats to cancel the meanwhile obsolete air 
transport agreement. 
  Trade policy is always nationalistic, even if exercised on 
the seemingly neutral forum of the GATT in Geneva. Nobody 
blames trade politicians for representing the interests of their 
countries. Yet, they must be careful not to lose credibility. 
And it is this credibility that the United States is putting at 
stake in its negotiations with Japan. 
  No one wants a trade war, even if it takes place in foreign 
regions; it would be an infringement on the GATT rules. Yet, 
if the United States still wants to be taken seriously, it must 
take itself at its word. The catalogue of sins that Japan has 
been confronted with for many years quite obviously does not 
have the expected effect. Trade delegate Mickey Kantor has a 
reputation for being tough. Maybe toughness is only a disguise 
for a lack of concept, a lacking conclusive policy.

<F P=106> [Speech by Chancellor Helmut Kohl at Christian Democratic </F>
Union conference in Hamburg; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] ...that's why I'm asking you, that's why I'm 
requesting you to return home from Hamburg and say to our 
voters: We the union of Germany want to win these elections I 
just mentioned. Our goal is to win, not just to place. 
[applause] 
  The first signal goes to Lower Saxony, to our colleague 
Christian Wolf and all our colleagues who are campaigning there. 
And my request here is that all those who are called upon -- 
there can never be enough -- join us in Lower Saxony. That 
they, along with us, seek out the voters and explain our 
policies and support our cause. 
  And we can do that easily in Lower Saxony. We have an 
excellent candidate [applause] who has all the qualities needed 
by a young candidate. [applause] And that is why -- and I'm 
saying this to our friends from Lower Saxony in particular -- it 
is not sufficient just to applaud here. Instead we must return 
home together and fight together, and not let cracks appear 
anywhere as if certain people have no wish to fight. That is a 
precondition if we want to win. [applause] 
  And in the examples of Lower Saxony and Hesse we are 
experiencing what Red-Green means in this dramatic moment in 
German history -- where it is no longer a question of keeping 
the status quo or strengthening assets and where we should be 
concentrating on securing the future and succeeding. And using 
the examples of Lower Saxony and Hesse, it is also possible to 
say how things would be if the Social Democrats [SDP] wishes 
became reality -- if Red-Green [coalition] took over power and 
responsibility in Germany. This is what we have to make clear 
to the voters. [applause] 
  The voter has to know what the issues are, where the 
differences lie, and, despite all those who give us advice on 
how we should move toward electoral victory like a slalom racer, 
the voter does not want the differences to be blurred. I am 
indeed in favor of a fair electoral campaign, but fair does not 
mean that someone lashes out at us and we, with Christian 
convictions, turn the other cheek -- we have no intention of 
doing that, church assembly. [applause] 
  Our country is setting its future course and everyone senses 
this. We must make clear what we stand for: for a policy for 
peace and freedom. This means that we should tell people that 
this is not a gift granted from heaven, but that the correctness 
of Bismarck's words that the fate of a nation is decided in its 
foreign and security policy has become noticeable again in 
recent days, weeks, and months. A policy of peace and freedom 
for Germany always means friendship and partnership with our 
neighbors. Since Konrad Adenauer it has been our important goal 
to be reliable friends and partners, and our success in the 
world has been based on this. [applause] 
  This means a policy to stop and reduce unemployment. We 
cannot and must not accept an unemployment figure of 4 million. 
This is the great domestic challenge facing our country, but 
this also means a policy for investment, a policy for growth. 
And I want to say this too -- this means that everyone must 
take part in this. It is not as easy as all that, just saying, 
when things were good, it was the companies and unions, and when 
things were bad, it was down to the politicians. We all have a 
joint responsibility here. [applause] 
  Growth and jobs with a secure future always mean that we are 
capable of reform and of a rethink. Many are surprised that we 
are facing a rather unusual situation in this election campaign. 
Those who on the election day will have had the responsibility 
for 12 years, talk about further development, safeguarding the 
future, and the need for a rethink, while those who want to take 
power talk about (?economic) assets. I like this division, 
because it forces us and makes it necessary for us to tell 
people what is going on, to say things that may appear 
uncomfortable, and to carry through what is required. Our 
country will have no future if we do not now take stock and see 
our future prospects, and if we are not capable of asking quite 
soberly what has gone well in this decade -- and many things 
have gone very well -- and what has proved not worthwhile. 
  The SDP is taking a very easy path, as they have done time 
and again in recent decades. With their plans they would lead 
the country -- if they had the responsibility of government -- 
into international isolation. 
  Willy Brandt said it: The German SDP against the rest of 
the world. And if you take a look now at the position of the 
German SDP within the Socialist International in Europe, you 
will notice that they are completely isolated. Friends, the 
word isolation must never again become a motto for German 
policy. [applause] We have paid a bitter price in this century 
for the occasions when our country isolated itself or when, as 
often happened, it allowed itself to be driven into isolation. 
We must remain capable of playing a full part in the alliance, 
and this is essential if we are to enjoy trust. There has just 
been a lot of talk, and rightly so, about the unification 
conference of the Union here in Hamburg [on 1 October 1990]. We 
would never have seen the day of German unity if our friends in 
the West, and our partners in the East had not trusted us -- and 
trust is the prerequisite for everything, both in private life 
and in politics. [applause] 
  This 1994 election year is a difficult year, not only here 
in 
Germany, but everywhere, in all industrial countries. This 
observation is correct, but it does not help us here at all. We 
are living through dramatic changes in the world, in Europe and 
in Germany. It is virtually impossible now for the ordinary 
citizen to grasp the meaning of the daily, rapid succession of 
images reflecting new, dramatic events. Many feel that it is 
all too much for them. This gives rise to a sense of 
uncertainty and to anxiety, and leads people to expect far too 
much of politicians. This then leads to that famous word, 
disillusionment [verdrossenheit], which we have already heard 
this morning. People then talk about disillusionment with 
politics [politikverdrossenheit], but I may add that all I can 
see is a general disillusionment: When I compare the Christian 
Democratic Union's [CDU] declining membership figures with those 
of the trade unions, proportionately speaking, I don't get the 
impression that one of us is any better off than the other. The 
dignified gentlemen in the employers' organizations don't talk 
about the numbers leaving them, but those figures are sizable, 
too. We also know about the figures for the churches and for 
sports clubs. 
  We are witnessing a development which extends far beyond 
everyday politics. People are becoming increasingly reluctant 
to make commitments, and this is naturally being reflected in 
politics as well. But precisely because this is the case, we 
cannot give in immediately to every passing trend. No! We must 
stand up for our program, we must present it in a language that 
people can understand, and we must act resolutely against those 
false prophets who seek to exploit anxieties and feelings of 
uncertainty for their own political ends. Ladies and Gentlemen: 
Rarely before have such persistent efforts been made to use 
belly-aching and the cover of pessimism to mount political 
campaigns. 
  A witness who is really worth quoting here is Martin 
Waltzer, 
who recently said the following in his honorary doctorship 
speech in Dresden on the topic "Unity Is Not failing." I quote: 
There are evidently people who are principally in a bad mood 
who cannot stand their own personal disillusionment. Thus, we 
are all supposed to share this disillusionment. Then he 
continues that a party that also uses historical difficulties 
for party political polemics shows it is unable to make any 
suggestion to resolve the difficulties. I have nothing to add to 
that. [applause] 
  This means that we, that I, will fight for every vote, that 
we will represent our beliefs on the offensive. And, Ladies and 
Gentlemen, on the offensive means being prepared for the fight. 
Offensive does not mean inviting people to background talks and 
telling them things -- if possible without stating who is saying 
it -- which one is otherwise too scared to tell the people. 
That is no great achievement. Offensive for me does not mean 
being afraid of one's own courage, giving in to those who 
believe they are powerful because they perhaps have had access 
to the opportunities provided by printed materials or television 
screens. We stand for our policies. We will win without giving 
in to anyone, friends. That is the decisive thing. [applause] 
  That does not mean the end of discussion, not by any means. 
A large party such as ours, a large political community such as 
ours has of course to struggle to find the correct future path. 
We must do this with respect for the views of others. We have 
to be capable of listening to arguments and weighing them up. 
But, Ladies and Gentlemen, we must not completely forget to 
think about the calender. When there is an election in a 
federal state parliament in three weeks' time, everyone in the 
CDU in Germany is obliged to think of the electoral campaigns 
that will take place in the evenings in that state in the snow 
and ice, and to put their heads on the block for this party. 
[applause] 
  And there cannot be for anyone, and I say anyone because I 
mean anyone, there cannot be for anyone a place in the box at 
the state theater of the republic where one watches with slight 
amusement the performance of some jester-like creatures on the 
stage. Those who now create an image for themselves at the 
expense of the whole exclude themselves from the community. 
[applause] 
  Therefore, dear friends, let's not now discuss how we will 
do 
in the elections. In case we finish badly, we may have a grand 
coalition and hide under the wing of the SDP. It's smelly, but 
it's warm. That cannot be our policy, dear friends. [applause] 
  We want to continue the coalition CDU/CSU [Christian Social 
Union] and FDP [Free Democratic Party]. And certainly not 
because of loving feelings. It is a question of reason. How 
can we decide questions about Germany's future that we are now 
facing with such overwhelming pressure? I think, and not just 
me, that despite all the things that sometimes annoy us in a 
day, that this is best possible with the FDP. Therefore, let us 
stop helping the SDP in their election campaign by addressing 
them from the outset as our future partner. When I say this, so 
that there is no doubt about this, I still maintain the 
statement that the Christian Democratic Union of Germany is 
naturally able to form a coalition with any democratic party. 
We have such coalitions in the federal states and I support 
them. However, for the federal government this does not augur 
well, but we want things to be good in our country and that is 
the decisive thing. [applause] 
  Therefore, dear friends, to state it briefly, this is our 
policy. Those who want a different policy have a chance between 
now and late Wednesday afternoon [23 February] to argue their 
case in this room. But when we go home on Wednesday, these 
debates are finished. Then we will fight together and those who 
don't want that will be isolated. That is clear. [applause] 
  It is also true, dear friends, that politics in the 
nineties, 
every decade has its characteristics, that politics in the 
nineties has become more difficult also because our country and 
our people are subject to more changes than in previous periods. 
This is reflected not only in opinion polls, it is reflected 
everywhere. I will give an example of how fast-moving we are. 
And I say this to myself, too. 
  You see, in Bad Kleinen in June 1993, officers of the GSG-9 
[special task force] and of the Federal Criminal Investigations 
Office apprehended terrorists. One GSG-9 officer was murdered 
in the operation. The killer, who was a terrorist, also died. 
It has now been shown to have been a suicide. In the days that 
followed, blame was pinned not on the perpetrator, but on the 
officer who had given his life for our country and our freedom. 
Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, if we allow -- and this is a matter 
for us, as we sit here, not just the concern of the chancellor 
and the party chairman, but our common concern -- if we allow a 
mood to be generated in Germany that compels the murdered man to 
prove that he is not a murderer, if we have a development where 
one can be prosecuted and forced to answer publicly for 
describing such a perpetrator as a murderer, and if we no longer 
even talk about the victim, that is intolerable for the 
atmosphere in this country. [applause] 
  I am glad to take the example of this GSG-9 officer as an 
opportunity to express gratitude to all those who spend day and 
night guarding our security and who receive far too little 
sympathy and support. [applause] 
  We should not let ourselves be upset by what is being said 
every day. Many people are looking at me now as if I were a 
rather strange creature, as if to say: How can he possibly 
still talk about winning the election? Ladies and Gentlemen: I 
am going by my experience, and my experience is that I have been 
constantly sustained by waves of support during these past 
decades, as you know. You know, I remember exactly what it was 
like in December 1982 and January 1983, when many, even in our 
own party, said we would have hardly any time in power and that 
we would fritter everything away by calling early elections. My 
argument that we could not go ahead with the deployment of the 
Pershings on the strength of a borrowed election result counted 
for little, at least at first. Our SDP colleagues and friends, 
who had moved out and were sitting with their suitcases in the 
parliament building, were saying it was just an accident and 
they would soon be back. It has been 12 years now, they have 
unpacked their cases, and I am in favor of them keeping those 
cases in the attic for a little while longer. [applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: Where would we be today, what would 
have happened to German unity, and what would be happening right 
now to NATO in former Yugoslavia, if we had followed the SDP 
then? 
  I don't need to look back that far. Think of Lothar de 
Maiziere. Remember February 1990 -- surely we are still allowed 
to do that! I read -- and many of those who wrote it so wisely 
are watching me now, and that is why I extend a particularly 
warm welcome to them, Ladies and Gentlemen -- at that time I 
read the following: Those areas, in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, 
Thuringia and so on, are ancient Social Democratic strongholds, 
and how can you possibly hope to campaign there? Our chances 
were rated as zero. There were many factors, I admit, but we 
won the election, Ladies and Gentlemen. We won the election to 
the first Volkskammer [People's Chamber] with Lothar de Maiziere 
and our friends. That is the reality. [applause] 
  Therefore, and I will put it quite simply, whichever way 
the wind blows, whether we can change its course depends 
crucially on us, and if we do not just talk about a close 
relationship with people, but we practice it, and if we take 
part in debates, and if we present our program and our 
representatives in a credible manner, then we have a very good 
chance. Therefore, let's get on with things together. 
  Here in Hamburg we have to say first and foremost why we 
want 
to take on the responsibility of government in Bonn again, why 
we are putting ourselves forward, and what our arguments are. I 
think that the first and most important factor is that in 
domestic policy we are capable -- despite 4 million unemployed 
and the problems associated with this -- of safeguarding Germany 
as a location for investment and business, that we know that 
without performance there will be no growth, no jobs for the 
future and no social security, and that, friends, whether we 
like it or not, there has to be a rethink, because the changes 
in the world have been so dramatic. As an industrial nation, we 
now have so much new competition that it is also necessary to 
call into question (?economic) assets. 
  We want to be elected because our social policy safeguards 
people's homes and orientation. We want to be elected because 
we stand for a strong liberal state based on the rule of law, 
not for a laissez-faire state, but for a state which provides 
protection and security for its citizens. And we want to be 
elected because we stand up for understanding between the 
generations, between young and old, for strengthening families 
with children, for recognizing, respecting, and showing 
affection for the elderly on whose shoulders we are standing. 
  We want to be elected because our foreign and security 
policy 
guarantees peace and freedom and because we are reliable 
partners. This also includes -- and I am referring here 
especially and expressly to all my predecessors in the post of 
party chairman, such as Rainer Barzel, as well as in the post of 
chancellor, insofar as they were from the CDU/CSU parties -- the 
fact that we are and remain the party of Europe. German unity 
and European unification are two sides of the same coin. 
[applause] 
  We also want to be elected because for us freedom, 
solidarity, and justice must be the guiding principles of our 
policy, and because the debate at this party conference on the 
key program makes this even clearer. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, we also want to be elected because we 
do not begin to sway in the wind when it is necessary to 
distance ourselves clearly and without hesitation from 
extremists on the right and left. For us right-wing extremists 
are living in the past and have not learned from history, and 
left-wing extremists are responsible for the material and 
spiritual devastation in one part of Germany. In other words, 
extremists on the left and right are a disgrace to our country. 
[applause] 
  Friends, we also want to be elected because we can point to 
our successes. Saying this also means, of course, that nothing 
more will be paid for this afterwards. But when you look at the 
documents you have about our successes and achievements over the 
last 10 years, and in particular in recent years, you will see 
that many outstanding things have been achieved over a brief 
period and we should keep reminding people of this. 
  It was nevertheless possible. And we did it. From 1983 up 
until shortly before German reunification we reduced the state 
quota drastically. The average income of an employee rose by 
almost 18 percent in real terms. And we proved that we could 
find jobs by creating 3 million new jobs. I am saying this 
because the SDP with their miserable policies want to cover up 
the fact that the stability of the former West Germany up until 
1989 had created the prerequisites required to overcome the 
economic challenges of the following year of German unification. 
[applause] 
  Friends -- leaving money aside for a moment -- we can look 
around this room today and see people from Brandenburg, from 
East Berlin, from Saxony, from Saxony-Anhalt and from Thuringia 
and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and we can say we are happy in 
the old German fatherland. That is the first thing and the most 
important thing. [applause] 
  And it really is a dream come true. When I spoke to Boris 
Yeltsin recently about the form this day at the end of August 
would take, 50 years later, when the last Russian soldiers 
withdraw, then I asked myself and I ask all of you, would we 
have ever believed it possible that this would happen in total 
friendship, in partnership, in close cooperation 50 years on? 
That is a fantastic thing. This is a reason to be pleased and 
not a reason to hide away this joy we may feel. [applause] 
  And friends, if we stop for a moment and ask ourselves -- 
and 
we can all answer this -- when in recent German history has 
there been a period in which the government of our country has 
had such excellent, friendly relations with Washington, with 
Moscow, with Paris and with London? That is our policy, so make 
sure you tell the people out there so that it is not gambled 
away by the SDP who would lead the country into isolation. 
[applause] And saying thank you should not become outmoded in 
our country, either in private or political life. For this 
reason it was a great joy for me to be able recently to express 
once again our country's thanks to George Bush and his 
colleagues in Washington, as I do with Mikhail Gorbachev at 
every possible opportunity. We don't want to forget what these 
two men and others did for us. [applause] 
  But friends, this gratitude should also include, in the 
states of former West Germany in particular, the thanks to our 
17 million fellow countrymen in the former GDR who were the ones 
who made this great achievement possible in the first place with 
their call for Germany, united fatherland. [applause] 
  We are not delving around in old files when we simply say 
that at this great hour for our people the SDP stood on the 
sidelines, that they were wrong. And I say this above all 
because it is something that I am reminded of every day. I get 
letters almost every day from mayors, lord mayors, state 
councillors, state politicians, not least from my own home 
state, who urge me to do everything to ensure that the Americans 
stay here at all costs. And they are the same people, Ladies 
and Gentlemen, who for years voiced anti-American sentiments at 
their council meetings; "Ami go home," they used to say. 
[applause] 
  It is not delving around in old files, or mudslinging, and I 
won't even touch these Stasi files, if I start from the 
experience of these years, such as the decision by the SPD 
Bundestag group, this is not some Stasi secret, it's an official 
resolution from 1984, on the issue of the office in Salzgitter, 
to stop the funds. What was this all about? It has to be said 
because people have forgotten it all in such a short time. 
After the experiences with the Wall and barbed wire, after the 
building of the Wall, it was about setting up an office in West 
Germany to document the acts of inhumanity, of crimes against 
humanity in Germany. 
  Afterall, during these years over 40,000 incidents of 
maltreatment, torture, and so on were registered, in order to be 
able to name those responsible at a later date. It was one of 
Honecker's most important demands, which he also made to me, to 
remove this thorn in the flesh of the henchmen of the then GDR. 
And, Ladies and Gentlemen, and if we now recall how intolerable 
it is for this to be trivialized today, we recall, Ladies and 
Gentlemen, that one could hardly demonstrate then for humanity 
and human rights in Chile or in South Africa while at the same 
time forgetting one's own compatriots. We say no more and no 
less than this. We will continue to exercise our right to do so 
during the election campaign, not least among the 17 million of 
our fellow citizens in the former GDR, which is now the new 
federal states, when carping criticism is made of the transitory 
problems which he have to solve together. [applause] 
  Nor, Ladies and Gentlemen, do we forget that leading German 
SDP were ready to accept Honecker's other awful demand for our 
compatriots with dual nationality to be expatriated. And since 
I was the one who negotiated with the Hungarian Government 
during the summer of 1989, I know what would have happened if we 
had kowtowed to Honecker when tens of thousands of our 
compatriots from the GDR and Hungary crossed the Austrian border 
into freedom. This is the experience of history, and it's not a 
matter of closing the file, as Mr. Thierse says, and then 
setting up a historical commission. I don't have anything 
against historical commissions, but they would reach exactly the 
same conclusion: That at a decisive phase in German history, 
leading German SDP betrayed a piece of our country's future. 
That is the truth. [applause] 
  Friends, we now have the equally important and difficult 
task 
of rethinking Germany's position as a business location with a 
view to the economic and social development of our country. 
That means, first of all, not giving in to the illusion that it 
is now sufficient to create improvements in our economic 
position without simultaneously removing the deep-seated faults 
that are the underlying cause of the economic slump. This was 
not, to quote, a normal economic slump. It is not a normal 
economic trough. Deep structural faults that have grown over 
the years have become visible. It is also true -- and I don't 
have to be a guru to know this -- that there are clear signs of 
an improvement in the economic situation, only we are not under 
any illusions. It will take a lot longer before we experience 
positive effects on the labor market. And the labor market does 
not mean a statistic of 4 million to me. Instead we should move 
away from statistics and look at the faces of the people -- 
those who want to work, not those who shirk work and abuse the 
social benefits system. But the many million who want to work, 
those people -- when they are not able to work and particularly 
those who have been unemployed for a longer period -- ask 
themselves ever more frequently: Am I of any use whatsoever? 
That is the question we are asking ourselves. And a Christian 
Democratic Union, which is committed to social justice -- we are 
not supporters of the market economy, we are supporters of the 
social market economy, Ladies and Gentlemen -- a Christian 
Democratic Union of this kind [applause] has to concern itself 
with this, has to think of everything that can be done and find 
a remedy as soon as possible. 
  There is no point in blaming one another. It is of course 
true that two signatures are required on wage agreements -- that 
of the employers and that of the employees. It is of course 
true that a dramatic overregulation has come about in many areas 
of our country over the decades. You can now see the effects of 
these terrible rules and regulations in the reconstruction 
process in the states of former East Germany. If Ludwig Erhard 
had had this overregulation in 1953, the upturn would not have 
been successful until decades later. We really must find the 
courage to say we want a state based on the rule of law rather 
than on the means of law enforcement, and we have to take the 
appropriate steps and do a great deal of dismantling. If we let 
it rest for five years, I believe that if the Federal Republic's 
construction laws -- which we, me included, were proud of at the 
beginning of the eighties -- if we were to put them on ice for 
five years, then we would build more and build better, that's my 
belief. [applause] 
  For this reason I am pleading passionately for us give it a 
try. We will make new mistakes, but doing nothing would be the 
biggest mistake of all. And we have just seen two examples of 
this. The railroad reform is an opus in itself. Here sits 
Matthias Wissman, our fortunate minister of transportation, and 
he deserves credit for his success, but Hans-Christoph Seebohm 
started it all at the end of the 1950's. Think: We needed 
decades to meet one of the crucial needs to lighten the burden 
on our roads and not to have all our goods being transported 
along the roads and autobahns, namely to build fast trains and 
get them running. For an industrialized country which wants to 
be among the best in the world this is a luxury which we can no 
longer afford. [applause] 
  Or take the postal service, which has many tens of thousands 
of the most modern jobs. Other countries depend on us. Our 
late friend Jozsef Antall, at one of the last cabinet meetings 
before his death, decided that Germany would be commissioned 
with modernizing the Hungarian postal service, and he did so 
with the classic justification, namely that the Germans would 
shortly have the world's most modern postal system. He believed 
it, so why don't we, my friends [laughter], why don't we believe 
it and why don't we bring it about, despite all the difficulties 
we have? 
  I believe, if we tackle the subject this way, and make 
securing Germany's economic future our main theme, that we will 
justifiably be able to point to tremendous results. I would 
wish, for example, that the presidents of all our chambers of 
trade and commerce, when they make clear what they want policies 
to achieve, which is well and good, would begin by saying that 
the reduction of corporate tax in Germany has led to the lowest 
ever level in this sector. And that it provides an excellent 
boost to growth and employment. 
  I would wish, second, that employers and unions, and I have 
to say in all honesty we, the state, the public sector, the 
chancellor, must all begin to implement flexible working hours 
and not just talk about them. [applause] Or put it another 
way: Does mass employment of this sort have to occur before 
practices are adopted in the auto sector in Rastatt or 
Kaiserslautern which were not possible before? Now some are 
saying we want to do away with keeping Sundays holy. Nothing of 
the sort is the case. But, Ladies and Gentlemen, we were well 
on the way to making Saturdays far holier than Sundays ever 
were, that is the point. [applause] 
  And now at last, after going back and forth for far too 
long, 
we have been able to update the law on genetic engineering. All 
this is contained in the question, will the Federal Republic of 
Germany, our country, be capable of meeting international 
competition? I cannot repeat often enough that we are not a 
rich country. With the exception of coal, we have scarcely any 
natural resources. And a word of warning to those who look only 
to the short term when it comes to coal, that this a 
short-sighted policy. Similar to agriculture, there are areas 
that should not be looked at solely in terms of the market 
economy. We need to secure our source of food through our 
farmers tomorrow and for decades into the future. We need a 
source of energy, and we will need coal as well, in the 21st 
century. I do not say this just because I'm in Hamburg. It is 
no good for a country with a coastline, with access to the sea, 
to say we will get out of the shipbuilding industry. There are 
three major areas of importance with which you won't win the 
Ludwig Erhard prize, I know, but you will secure a piece of the 
future. For this reason, I say we need an understanding here of 
the requirements necessary to maintain our position on the world 
market. 
  In other words, we did not get much worse than the others; 
they got better. We used to talk just about Taiwan and Japan; 
and now, my friends, the competition is at our own front door, 
and we want it this way. It is of elementary importance to our 
security that the Russians, the Ukrainians, the Czechs, and the 
Poles find their economic feet as soon as possible and that they 
become truly able to feed themselves. At our own front door, in 
the Czech Republic, they have a country which is home to one of 
the most intelligent peoples in Europe. And if 3 marks [DM] are 
paid for a skilled engineering worker at a major European 
company in this country, in Bruenn [Brno], and 40 are paid in 
Mannheim, the trend is clear to anyone. 
  This cannot mean that we go down from 40DM, nor can it mean 
that they stay at 3DM, but we must make a real mental effort in 
order to make up to a certain extent what we are losing in terms 
of our future development. That means investment in first class 
education and qualifications for workers. Furthermore, 
improving the infrastructure: I have already spoken about 
railroads, about postal services. We can do many things 
differently here -- what our local state chairman has just 
written to the mayor of Hamburg is part of all this -- 
concerning the Transrapid [fast route from Hamburg to Berlin]. 
  It means looking after the medium-sized companies, Ladies 
and 
Gentlemen. We have no problems with multicultural... [pauses] 
we have no problems with large companies, we have no problems 
with Europe-wide, worldwide companies. We are grateful for 
every job. However, Erhard's policy was always to recognize 
that what in those days was [words indistinct] is medium-sized 
companies in our economy, that is the driving, dynamic force. 
That must become clear again, along with all that it involves. 
[applause] 
  This entails something else as well. This will play a major 
role at this party conference, and I am in favor of it: The 
rational linking of the environment and the economy, of ecology 
and the economy. I would far prefer to use the word creation 
rather than environment, because it contains far more in terms 
of our ethical responsibility. We in our generation do not have 
the right to let the country go to the dogs from the point of 
view of the environment and of environmental protection. 
  If I summarize all this, then we need more flexibility, we 
need more innovation, we need stability. That has consequences 
for our budget and our currency. Flexibility, for example, 
means doing what is overdue, that is creating more part-time 
jobs. It is incomprehensible, Ladies and Gentlemen, that 2.5 
million people in the Federal Republic who have jobs say, when 
asked, that they would like to work part-time, but for reasons 
that are quite incomprehensible to me -- moreover in the civil 
service, which also sets a terrible example -- no progress is 
made here. In the Netherlands, every third employee is a 
part-time employee; here it is every sixth. If we introduced 
the Dutch example here, then we would have some 2 million jobs. 
We do not need to wait until the year 2000. We can get this 
moving now. The legal bases were created long ago. 
  In the agreement in the chemical industry -- and I would 
like 
to give due credit here -- we have examples of more flexibility. 
I will say quite openly, I cannot understand at all: If a 
large trade union such as that in the chemical industry can come 
to such agreements, why should there be serious talk at the 
moment about strikes and lock-outs? We are committing a crime 
against the future of our country if we allow ourselves to 
experiment like that right now. [applause] 
  When I spoke of a rethink with regard to innovation -- and 
there we have an unusual responsibility -- there is also the 
question of our responsibility in the past and our 
responsibility in the future for a favorable climate for 
technology and research in Germany. Ladies and Gentlemen, we 
have tolerated for too long this nonsense which was spread 
about, young people were persuaded they had to be afraid of 
taking a positive view of life and the future and should study 
for as long as possible because the outside world was cold. We 
need young people who are confident and this attitude has to be 
shaped at home, at school and, as far as I'm concerned, now and 
again during the sermon on Sunday. Both, all three, can be very 
useful for young people. [applause] 
  We are obviously very pleased when our sportsmen and women 
are successful. We can see this as the winter Olympics are now 
taking place. The medals will be counted and everyone, many 
people, will feel personally moved and the example of a young 
skier is obviously a motivation to hundreds of thousands of 
young people to achieve something themselves. Why don't we 
transfer this experience from the world of sport to the area of 
technology and science? Why don't we finally say a firm yes to 
this as a prerequisite for a functioning republic, namely a yes 
to an elite of achievers. No democracy can exist without an 
achieving elite. And that is particularly evident in this 
field. [applause] 
  Friends, I am not preaching a blind belief in progress here. 
At the end of this century we understand what this means. 
Progress, progress in science and technology must always have 
an ethical basis and responsibility to ensure that everything 
that is feasible is not necessarily allowed. But we cannot 
maintain our living standards and the social security in our 
country if we are not in the forefront of developments in the 
world, if our companies no longer consider that the results of 
research will produce more marketable products. This is not a 
primary objective of politics -- politics has to provide the 
framework and I'm in favor of that and industry can quite 
rightly demand that. But, Ladies and Gentlemen, when I 
occasionally hear people complaining about us, I think people 
should keep their own houses tidy before criticizing us. We 
have made mistakes but so have other people, and if everyone 
rectifies their own mistakes then the country will have a good 
future. It's that simple. 
  One more thing is important, stability which will secure the 
future -- we are all agreed on that -- stable state finances, a 
stable mark -- we cannot increase state debt any further. We 
reduced the state quota in 1949, in 1982 --it has increased to 
an intolerable level again. We cannot continue to increase 
taxes, because this will destroy the country and the people's 
desire to work. We have to see economic output in relation to 
the social welfare state. That is why we have to save. There is 
no further scope for the distribution of wealth. That is why we 
say honestly to one another what is possible and what is not. 
In a country like Germany, where social benefits total 1 
trillion with a 3 trillion marks GNP, a further increase is not 
possible. That does not mean we should dismantle the welfare 
state, but we should restructure it. We have to combat abuses, 
but we are not just talking of abuses of the unemployment 
benefit system -- although they unfortunately exist -- but also 
of tax and subsidy frauds. None of these three are trivial 
offenses. [applause] 
  Dear friends, we must do that. And I can only ask you 
again and again to tell people this because it is the prime 
basis for our future ideas. We must do it in a demographic 
situation whose effects are still not understood by many. It is 
the free decision of the Germans that we have one of the lowest 
birth rates in the world for people in their 20's. 
  It is gratifying that we have increasing life expectancy -- 
in the year 2000, it will be 75 for men and almost 81 for women. 
It is gratifying that we now have more than 3 million persons 
who are over 80 in Germany, and you know the effects on the job 
market, the social security system, the economy as a whole. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, the number of pensioners is rising, and 
so I will say a frank word about that. These pensioners are not 
just anybody -- it is the generation of my parents, for the 
young here it is the generation of their grandparents. And a 
pension is not alms given to people by the state; it is the 
life's work of a man or a woman. If that is the case, they have 
a right to a secure pension. So let's stop experimental 
speculation about this, which can only make people unhappy in 
the end. That cannot be our policy. [applause] 
  We will stick to the principle of linking wages and 
contributions and securing people's living standards in old age. 
But the statistics show something that is one of the most 
incomprehensible things nowadays, that is the absolute necessity 
for nursing care insurance. We know -- and will stick to this 
-- that it must not be an additional burden for the economy. 
This must be done in such a way that it is not an additional 
burden. However, we have 1.8 million people in need of nursing 
care in Germany. And what are we doing now? We have 30 days of 
vacation, we have between 11 and 14 other holidays. That makes 
eight weeks of free time. What is important now is not even to 
cut two days of vacation, but to leave them as they are and not 
to pay for them in holiday pay, or to give the worker the 
opportunity to make up for them out of his leave entitlement. 
  We wrangle over this now, and the old ones -- I won't say 
senior citizens, because it is much closer to reality -- fall by 
the wayside. I find the way this matter is being discussed 
quite intolerable. [applause] 
  If at the same time in German cities the number of single 
people is increasing -- some 50 percent of the households, and 
of them, 6 million people between 25 and 65 -- then it is clear 
that hardly anything is changing in the overall climate of the 
country at present. Hence it is not a CDU obsession -- there 
are some strange utterances from the FDP that I cannot 
understand at all -- when we say that the topic of family and 
children is the central topic when we are talking about securing 
the future in the medium and long term. We have already set 
great things in motion from family allowances to parental leave 
and parental leave allowance. There is also our recognition of 
time spent rearing children for pension purposes and many other 
things. 
  This is not enough, however. I promise, with a view to the 
state's finances -- and our manifesto will look this way barring 
any great changes in the sums involved -- during the next 
legislative period we will have to do something in the tax area 
for industry to promote investment and eradicate unemployment. 
But we must also take a further step, even if it is only a 
small one, on behalf of families with children. And, Ladies and 
Gentlemen, this is not just any old issue, which is why I am in 
favor of a further reduction in the tax burden, for raising the 
level of statutory tax exemption, which is anyway necessary for 
constitutional reasons, in line with subsistence level, and we 
will certainly have to discuss a series of other issues. I 
would however ask that we discuss this in private before we do 
so in public, Ladies and Gentlemen. [applause] But -- and I 
add this by way of warning, because I'm afraid we have also 
fallen a little behind the times -- as important as all the 
material things are, there is something far worse to criticize, 
namely that there is no overseeing how cold our society has 
become in its attitude toward children, and that this is at 
least as significant as anything we can do in financial terms. 
Having a positive attitude to children is a wholly personal 
matter where the state has no business interfering. But where 
children are present, the state has to act protectively in 
another way. And the every day life of a family with children, 
and above all the every day life of single parents, not least 
single mothers, is such that it is depressing how society, our 
society, treats them. [applause] 
  Permit me to say a few words on the subject of our country's 
unity. I said, and it is an opinion we all share, that we are 
happy with the gift of unity. But it is also true that on this 
path to unity we found out that 40 years, 40 years of 
separation, had left far deeper marks than we, myself included, 
thought. It is also true that overcoming the legacy of the SED 
regime is the central task we face. But that's the way it has 
to be. And when we distribute public money -- we can spend it 
only once -- and more goes toward east Germany than the west, 
then I say, and this is something we have to tell people as it 
is also part of the truth, that it's now the turn of those who 
had to wait 40 years. And where I come from, where the building 
of a new bridge across the Rhine has been an important issue for 
30 years, for 30 years we have argued, for 30 years we failed to 
find a suitable site, and now it's the autobahn from Rostock to 
Luebeck that has priority, because without it there can be no 
development in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. [applause] 
  Friends, let's not let ourselves be impressed by those who 
say they are speaking in the name of the people. The large 
majority of our people, also in the western part of Germany, 
know full well that this theory is correct. But what we now 
need to tackle -- in addition to what has to happen on the 
economic side of things -- is the question of the people living 
together, and this touches the lives of millions every day. 
  I must tell you what repeatedly fills me with consternation 
-- perhaps this is not the right word, hurts me -- is how little 
soul -- I will use that word -- is characteristic of our contact 
with one another. And many speak condescendingly after 40 years 
of their experience of the western administration system. 
People almost always forget what that means, what kind of 
people are now sitting in state federal government and are 
mayors. Five years ago they were doctors, surgical nurses, 
everything conceivable. Now they are negotiating with 
international concerns about the setting up of car factories and 
many other things. Of course, not everything runs smoothly. 
Anyone who examines local politics in western Germany cannot 
seriously say that everything is functioning perfectly there. 
Read the local newspapers, Ladies and Gentlemen. [applause] 
  All the people -- I myself included -- in the states of 
former West Germany have been impregnated and shaped over a 
period of many years by a certain type of politics. You know 
that if you are on camera you do up your jacket then you come 
out with hollow words when you don't want to say anything. 
That's the usual course of things. And then you are considered 
right and proper. But, Ladies and Gentlemen, this is not 
possible when you have lived on a different planet for 40 years. 
If you believed for 40 years that free public opinion was also 
your opinion. That has to be learned, and I have experienced 
that from our colleagues in the Bundestag and in the cabinet. 
What we need now are reasonable talks with one another: We 
need to have patience with one another, that is the most 
important thing that we need in Germany now. [applause] 
  But equally, part of the picture is that we tell our 
compatriots in eastern Germany that the standard of living 
reached in west Germany was not created in four years but took 
decades to achieve, and that we have to exercise patience with 
each other. I have no doubt, Ladies and Gentlemen, that 
together we can achieve whatever we want. Despite all the 
worries and [word indistinct] which I see and which you can see 
as well, the complete change in people's prospects, but when I 
see for example how the roads and autobahns look in east Germany 
today, and when I take just as a small example the fact that 
during the 40 years of the GDR precisely 1.8 million telephone 
lines were installed and that in just a few recent years the 
figure has been 4.1 million, to take one example [sentence as 
heard]. When I look at the trend in pensions, a subject 
particularly close to my heart, which amounted to 450 to 500 
Ostmarks after 45 working years before German unity, and which 
is now 1,250DM, then it is justified that we do so, we need make 
no excuses, this is a concrete example of solidarity in practice 
in Germany. [applause] 
  And I concede every day that we have made errors, I, Lothar 
de Maziere, when we were negotiating the agreements at the time, 
Wolfgang Schaueble and others. In April 1990, the GDR's assets 
were estimated at 1 trillion marks. And we were not the only 
ones. It was the great economic gurus not just here but on the 
other side of the Atlantic who made these estimates. And then 
we said we would write in the agreement that when everything had 
been calculated, that which remained -- Detlev Rohwedder named a 
sum of 600 billion -- the amount would be credited to the then 
inhabitants of the GDR. My friends, to make sure there's no 
misunderstanding, this was not 40 years ago, it was four years 
ago. When I recall the Bundestag debate on this, I don't want 
to bore you with it, every other [word indistinct] would have 
tortured ourselves if we had said we would not do it. The 
forecasts at the time were of an entirely different nature. And 
so I was wrong as well. I did not expect the Soviet Union to 
collapse and that 25 billion in trade would have shrunk to 
around 5 billion, and that only with the help of Hermes 
guarantees. But I was not wrong on one count. First, German 
unity and second, I still maintain, even if somewhat later, that 
there will be flourishing landscapes in the former GDR. 
[applause] 
  And, my friends, the whole world expects this of us. 
Francois Mitterrand has always used the same formula: The 
Germans have great problems, they would not be proper Germans if 
they did not master them. And here comes the sentence which is 
not my own, I quote: And afterwards they will be stronger than 
ever before. And, you see, this a central point which faces us 
at the moment. It is the question all our neighbors pose: What 
exactly is the matter with you Germans? What do you stand for? 
When Volker Ruehe negotiates with a counterpart, he is asked, 
well, are you actually allowed to do that? When the foreign 
minister goes away for negotiations he comes back and says: It 
was terrible. Everyone said this and that has to be done, but 
they all looked past me because we are unable to act. 
  You see, Ladies and Gentlemen, it goes against the honor, if 
I can put it this way, it is against the honor and dignity of 
our country that we are a member of the United Nations and can 
make use of the rights this brings, but shirk responsibility 
when it comes to obligations. [applause] 
  It does not speak in our political favor if we fail to find 
an answer to this question and turn instead to Karlsruhe 
[Constitutional Court] with the attitude that it is far easier 
to unload our burden in Karlsruhe than to do our duty ourselves. 
It does not speak in our favor, we should stop talking about 
disillusionment with politics when politicians are themselves 
not capable of providing the prerequisites necessary for action. 
  I think we are seeing in these hours, and I mean this quite 
literally, the possibility of a new chance. The way things look 
this morning, the objectives the NATO ultimatum intended to 
achieve will now be possible, at least in the Sarajevo area. I 
myself have contributed over the last few days, and I must say 
also the nights, to the efforts to end this terrible bloodshed, 
these horrible killings, first in that place and then elsewhere. 
  I would like to say expressly that I welcome the fact that 
with Boris Yeltsin and the Russian government another important 
force has assumed responsibility. I have tried to make great 
efforts to make this possible. 
  I would also welcome it if over the next few weeks -- we do 
not have much time -- we could invest all our strength in order 
to produce an overall plan, there are already some reasonable 
pieces, in order to end the whole suffering in the former 
Yugoslavia and, after careful preparation, to hold a very 
high-level international conference. We must do all we can to 
make our contribution to this, within our possibilities. 
  But this example shows that we Germans do not hide away in 
our niche when the storms of history break out. That would not 
be acceptable. We cannot be one of the strongest countries in 
Europe, we cannot want to take on an important role in the world 
and use the Red-Green coalition in Germany's motto: When it is 
to our advantage we will join in, when it is not, we will leave 
the playing field and wait in the shower until the storm is 
over. That is not politics, that would be a wretched thing for 
our country and for this reason we must also win the election to 
ensure that this wretched thing is not practiced throughout the 
world. [applause] 
  Friends, this kind of politics also includes a clear and 
unreserved yes to the Bundeswehr. There are few things 
[applause] which have affected me so badly over the last weeks 
as the necessary savings measures for the Bundeswehr and in the 
area of technical innovation. This cannot go on for ever. We 
have to enter areas and [word indistinct] but alongside the 
money, it is above all a question of thoughts and emotions. Is 
this the army of our children, our sons, or not? Should we 
allow a mood to emerge in our country and society where soldiers 
are reviled for the service they perform? Or, put more 
amicably, those who serve are regarded as stupid compared to 
those who don't. That is unacceptable. [applause] 
  My friends, given all my respect, and I have great respect 
for young people who do alternative service in hospitals in 
[word indistinct] or elsewhere, the priority lies with 
compulsory military service. It is important for the future, 
and I say with equal clarity, I am and remain a convinced 
supporter of general conscription. Changing this would change 
the fundamental structure of our country, this cannot be stated 
often enough, unpleasant as it may be. [applause] 
  Experience in Yugoslavia teaches us something else, 
something 
of extreme importance, I think. I also have to address this to 
myself. We have to concentrate our arguments in the fight for 
Europe's political unity increasingly on the truly decisive 
factors. We want the political union of the Maastricht Treaty. 
We want economic and currency union on the clear-cut conditions 
of a stable economy and above all a stable currency. But, my 
friends, all this will be in vain if we fail to maintain peace 
and freedom in Europe. The question which faces us now, after 
the experience of the last few years and months, is: Is the 
unification of Europe not above all a question of war and peace? 
  In six years the century will be over. And of course history 
does not repeat itself entirely exactly, but there was a time 
when Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann won the Nobel peace 
prize and when everyone, almost everyone in Europe and Germany 
believed there would never be another war between France and 
Germany. Eight years later came Hitler, six years after that 
the Second World War. History does not repeat itself. But does 
anyone in this hall honestly believe that the terrible example 
we see today of racial hatred and ethnic cleansing, religious 
hostility and the worst kind of chauvinism in the Balkans, that 
these evil spirits only live there and could never go elsewhere? 
Can we not hear from other parts of Europe, starting in Moscow, 
tones which -- we don't want to attach too much importance to 
them -- but which at least ought to make us stop and think. 
This means that this country, Germany, our country, at the 
center of Europe geographically and geopolitically, the country 
with most frontiers, is linked to European unification for good 
or ill. If we go it alone we will once again go into isolation 
and once again take the wrong path, that is the experience 
history shows us. [applause] 
  For this reason we want to build this Europe as our vision 
has always been, irrespective of what others may say for 
temporary opportunistic reasons ahead of various elections. 
That is not our policy. It should become what we have 
described in the motion which which will be submitted to you 
tomorrow. The shape of the European Union has to be that of a 
liberal, democratic, federal, subsidiarity-based federal state. 
Because Europe safeguards the future of nations, it also 
safeguards their identity. And the European identity will grow 
with the experience of joint action. It is the community of 
peoples' cultural roots and the fatefulness of their interests. 
Deep attachment to one's roots, national identity, and common 
European features complement and depend on one another. This is 
our Europe. We remain citizens of Hamburg, we remain people 
from Silesia and Holstein or Lower Saxony. This is our home. 
This Germany is our fatherland and our common future lies in 
Europe. If we understand it this way, the people out there will 
do so as well. [applause] 
  This is why our program of principles is so important. 
Day-to-day politics has its significance. Day-to-day politics 
delivers the headlines. But if the Community's compass loses 
direction, we lose viability for the future and with it our 
opportunity for the future. All this has been the chief idea 
behind our Union [CDU/CSU] since 1945 and 1946, which in part 
arose as a great new political instrument of change in our 
country and was the precondition for unification and for the 
most liberal system the Germans have ever had. 
  We have enjoyed the gift of peace for 48 years, 48 years, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, of which our founding fathers and mothers 
could only have dreamed. And it is almost 50 years since 
Wolfgang Borchert, here in Hamburg, wrote Draussen vor der 
Tuer [Outside the Door], a work which deeply shocked an 
entire generation. And it is now just 51 years since this town 
was destroyed in a terrible attack in which many thousands died. 
  When preparing this speech, I came across by chance, by 
happy 
chance, the recently published memoirs of Vernon Walters, the 
[former] U.S. ambassador and a friend of our country. He writes 
in his book of a visit here in 1946, with Averell Harriman, a 
great American who played a great role in German and European 
history. 
  I quote: In 1946, we visited a German family in the ruins of 
a bombed out building. They lived in the only part of the 
building which was still habitable, in the cellar. When we 
returned to the surface I asked whether I would ever see a 
rebuilt German city. Averell Harriman answered that I would, and 
very soon. He asked me if I had seen what the German family had 
standing on the table in their cellar. A bowl of flowers, I 
answered. Then Harriman said solemnly, people who amid such a 
sea of destruction can pick flowers and place them on the table 
are also capable of rebuilding everything else. 
  My friends, that was the generation of our parents and 
grandparents, and I think that during the second great challenge 
facing the Germans in the building of this republic, following 
the first great effort of the 1950s, that flowers are a good 
symbol. Let's make sure that the flowers stay on the table as 
the symbol of a peaceful and free Germany, an open and 
hospitable Germany, a Germany in which hatred toward Germans or 
foreigners can never find a home. Then this Germany will be the 
country we wish for ourselves, our delightful fatherland, and 
that is something worth working for. [applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Martin S. </F>
Lambeck in Bonn; date not given: "We Cannot Afford Quarreling"] 
  [Text] [Lambeck] Mr. Chancellor, on the eve of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] congress in Hamburg, various 
opinion polls are painting a gloomy picture for the 
CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU]. How will you motivate the 
concerned members of your party in the super election year 1994? 
  [Kohl] First of all, our members are not unmotivated. I am 
continuously on the road and I not only get a lot of 
encouragement, but many people are also militantly prepared to 
shape this election year. The following is valid for the whole 
party: We have to struggle for every vote. I am confident that 
we will also win the election in this way. We must explain the 
considerable achievements we want to point out to the citizens. 
We must not let every antagonism scare us. In the past 
quarter, we achieved things others were unable to accomplish 
over decades. These include railroad and postal service 
reforms, which are hardly mentioned any longer. We Germans made 
a very decisive contribution to the conclusion of the GATT 
negotiations. In this way we created an important prerequisite 
for free world trade, which is of utmost importance for a top 
exporting nation like Germany. My colleagues in the European 
Union decided that the European Central Bank will have its seat 
in Frankfurt. Moreover, I state that this Federal Government 
and this head of government have excellent, friendly relations 
with Moscow, Paris, Washington, and London. When has that ever 
been the case in Germany's recent history? I do not see a 
reason for pessimism and fatalism, but I will say the following 
at the party congress: We must fight and some must stop talking 
nonsense. 
  [Lambeck] How do you explain the facat that the citizens 
have hardly taken note of this catalogue of achievements? 
  [Kohl] There are many reasons. Basically, I want to say the 
following: One is talking of weariness concerning politics. I 
deny that politics alone is at issue. There is a general 
weariness, certainly also weariness concerning parties, but, for 
example, weariness concerning trade unions, too. At any rate, 
the German Trade Union Federation lost considerably more members 
in the past 12 months than the democratic parties. There is 
weariness concerning the employers' associations. There is 
weariness concerning the church. There is weariness concerning 
the media. I do not know what would happen if the German 
citizens were able to decide completely and freely whether they 
should pay fees to the television station which are compulsory 
under public law. 
  No, the mood is generally bad. This is all the more absurd 
because it does not correspond to the real mood of the 
individual. You can see this in all opinion polls. If you ask 
the people how they feel personally, the results will be 
surprising. If they are graded using the marks one to six like 
at school, the personal situation ranges from about two minus to 
two plus. If the same people are asked how the country is, the 
result will be five minus, which means that the promotion is 
endangered. This is an absurd result! A bad mood is being 
preached constantly. I will not be infected by it. 
  Germany is one of the most beautiful countries of the world. 
This has nothing to do with chauvinism. I, Helmut Kohl, am 
lucky that I can live here in a time of dramatic changes, in a 
time when we have had 48 years of peace in Germany. All my 
foreign visitors tell me: Is that all you have to worry about? 
Of course, we have many worries in our own country. We have to 
cope with dramatic changes. We have unemployment, we have to 
save money, but we are still better off than comparable 
countries. 
  [Lambeck] The pollsters are stating that many citizens 
expect a change of government in October. How do you explain 
such a trend? 
  [Kohl] First of all, the statements by pollsters are not a 
trend. You know, the election will be decided on the evening of 
the election at 1800. Four years ago, before the first really 
free election in the former GDR, the People's Chamber election, 
the pollsters predicted a disastrous result for us. Even the 
very clever people said at that time: These are traditional 
laender of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. And on 
the evening of the election, they only stammered silly excuses 
on German television. I was the frontrunner in four Land Diet 
elections in Rhineland-Palatinate, and I am now facing my sixth 
Bundestag election. How often have I heard that everything is 
going wrong and how often have I been politically buried! 
  [Lambeck] One often has the impression that leading 
CDU/CSU politicians contradict each other from one day to the 
next. Is the CDU/CSU lacking the necessary consistency? 
  [Kohl] Consistency is far more difficult for the party that 
bears responsibility than for one that is in opposition. I, 
myself, was the leader of the opposition. It is far easier to 
state at 1200 on Friday that one is disgusted and indignant at 
the acts of the government than to do the right thing in 
difficult times with 4 million unemployed. Some controversies 
within the party are necessary, some are absolutely unnecessary 
and only help some squabblers to acquire status. However, this 
does not change the fact that we cannot afford these quarrels. 
At the federal party congress in Hamburg an end will be put to 
unnecessary quarrels. 
  [Lambeck] Mr. Chancellor, do you feel that some party 
friends have let you down in your struggle for a victory in the 
election? 
  [Kohl] I feel as I have always felt. We are a big party, 
just like the other people's party, the SPD. And the people do 
not leave their identity in the cloakroom of the Adenauer House. 
Our spectrum of opinions is very broad. Whoever cannot bear 
this must not become party chairman or chancellor. 
  [Lambeck] The spectrum of parties has increased. How 
dangerous will the challenge from the Instead Party and 
Brunner's party be for the CDU/CSU in the election year? 
  [Kohl] I am deeply convinced that we will have a good 
turnout at the Bundestag election, as has always been the case 
since 1949. The turnout will certainly be close to 80 percent. 
This is a very important statement because the 5-percent clause 
will have a completely different weight. 
  The CDU/CSU cannot give any votes away. Whoever runs against 
us is a political opponent. We have to take him seriously. 
There are certainly differences. In general, the following 
applies: We have to form a tougher, more decisive front against 
all radicals from the left and the right. As for the rest, we 
have to struggle for ourselves. 
  [Lambeck] But such parties, as well as the Republikaner, do 
not develop from nothing. Do the big parties have to reproach 
themselves for failures? 
  [Kohl] Of course, we have to reproach ourselves for 
failures! The question of the big people's parties capacity of 
integration is at issue again and again. We in the CDU -- just 
like the others -- have certainly made mistakes here. 
  [Lambeck] Fewer and fewer citizens are currently prepared to 
commit themselves in political parties. What can you and the 
CDU do against this? 
  [Kohl] Are the citizens prepared to commit themselves in 
other fields? Commitments in a party, a sports club, a youth 
group are permanent commitments. And the preparedness to 
participate here has decreased alarmingly. 
  This is a basic fact of our society. The situation is 
completely different if you call for a specific charitable 
action to help people, for example, children in Bosnia. You 
will hardly find as much encouragement and support as here in 
any other country of the world. 
  But let us come back to the parties: If the CDU presents a 
reasonable, clever, and convincing program to the people, it 
will show its charisma and motivate the members. I am 
completely sure of that. But I am also saying: The 
presentation of the party personnel has to be in line with the 
programmatic claim. Then we will be successful, despite the 
undeniable antagonism about which you are rightly talking. 
  By the way, I am pleased to state that there are currently 
many district associations in the CDU that are joined by a 
considerable number of new members every month. If one inquires 
about the reason on the spot, one ascertains that the 
responsible persons commit themselves; they go to the people in 
their local and district associations, and they talk about the 
pending problems. They are successful with it.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Dr. Angela Merkel, deputy leader </F>
of Germany's Christian Democratic Union, by Tony Paterson in 
Berlin "this week"] 
  [Text] Germany's Christian Democrats, Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl's party, face a "difficult" election year and will have an 
uphill struggle in winning back disaffected east German voters, 
their deputy leader, Dr Angela Merkel, told THE EUROPEAN this 
week. 
  In an unusually frank interview, Merkel admitted that in the 
four years since reunification, her party, the CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union], had made a number of mistakes, particularly 
in the east, which threatened to damage its chances seriously in 
the l9 elections it faces this year. 
  "A headwind is blowing hard into our faces," she said, in a 
reference to the political climate in eastern Germany. "My 
biggest fear is that voters may find the experience of democracy 
so repugnant that they will stay away from the polls." 
  Merkel, an east German MP who is also minister for women and 
youth affairs in the Federal Government in Bonn, was speaking in 
the run-up to the CDU conference in Hamburg, at which strategy 
for Germany's election marathon will be decided. 
  There is disillusionment with all parties in eastern 
Germany, 
but opinion polls have shown that Kohl's party could not expect 
to win more than 30 percent of votes in the region if a general 
election were held now. 
  Merkel blamed the drop in the CDU's popularity in the east 
on 
the initial "very high" expectations over German reunification. 
But the east Germans were not necessarily justified, she said, 
in thinking that they had been given a false promise by Kohl 
when he assured them in a pre-l990 election speech that their 
region would soon be a "blossoming landscape." 
  Merkel said: "We have made the landscape blossom as much as 
possible in the amount of time available. But the process is 
taking longer than anyone expected. There is disappointment in 
many areas. It is going to be a much more difficult election 
than before." 
  She admitted that the government had made a mistake by 
failing to stress that reunification would also bring widespread 
unemployment to eastern Germany, together with a western system 
of bureaucracy which failed fully to recognise east German 
qualifications. 
  Unemployment and insecurity about the future are considered 
to be among the main reasons for the decline in the CDU's 
popularity. Last week unemployment in Germany as a whole reached 
a postwar record of more than four million, and 17 percent of 
eastern Germany's workforce are without jobs. Most analysts 
maintain that if the CDU loses large numbers of eastern votes in 
Germany's October general election it will be ousted from power 
in Bonn or forced into a coalition with the opposition Social 
Democrats. 
  Merkel also conceded that her party had failed to stress the 
sacrifices of reunification early enough in western Germany, 
which obliged voters to cut back their high living standards. 
"One of the main problems is that neither the Chancellor nor 
any economic institute realised how bad a state the east German 
economy was in at the time of reunification," she said. "But 
what was the alternative: should we have said no to 
reunification?" 
  Merkel insisted that the CDU would not waver from its 
pro-Maastricht course and a commitment to widening EU membership 
eastwards -- despite opinion poll showing that around 72 percent 
of the German electorate was opposed to the Maastricht Treaty's 
provisions. 
  However, she conceded that part of the blame for the lack of 
enthusiasm for Europe lay in Bonn's failure to conduct an open 
debate, Danish style, on the issue. 
  She indicated that her party had been hit badly by the 
public 
controversy last year over Steffen Heitmann, the Saxon justice 
minister and the CDU's initial choice of candidate for the 
German presidency. Heitmann was forced out of the running 
because of criticism about his views on women, the Holocaust, 
and Europe. 
  But there is to be no let-up, she hinted, in the CDU's 
efforts to discredit Johannes Rau, the opposition SPD's 
presidential candidate, by insinuating that he had been 
supported by East Germany's communist regime. 
  Rau is the most popular choice among many Germans to replace 
Richard von Weizsacker as president in elections this May. He 
has been accused by the CDU of wanting to shut down a west 
German centre monitoring human rights abuses in the former East 
Germany, in return for communist support. 
  Merkel underlined that the CDU had no special recipe 
designed 
to win votes: "We can only say what we have done and how we 
intend to carry on. I remain optimistic. If people don't 
accept that they can vote for someone else."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Schoehuber's Visit to Streibl: </F>
`Completely Idiotic'"] 
  [Excerpts] Munich/Berlin -- yesterday Christian Social 
Union [CSU] leaders very clearly verbally distanced themselves 
from the Republikaner. Former Bavarian Minister-President Max 
Streibl had met secretly with Republikaner Chairman Franz 
Schoenhuber last November. [passage omitted] 
  Streibl acted "stupidly," said Juergen Ruettgers, Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] parliamentary manager of the CDU/CSU 
Bundestag group. It is "completely idiotic" when leading 
politicians meet with the Republikaner chairman, CDU Deputy 
Horst Eylmann said. However, one should not overestimate 
Streibl's action. Guenther Mueller of the CSU called for 
dealing politically with the Republikaner. "However, the 
question arises of whether this must be done on one's own sofa 
at home." 
  Last Saturday [12 February], Streibl called his CSU chairman 
and told him what had happened. Finance Minister Theo Waigel 
was assured of the private nature of the meeting and, outwardly 
he reacted with Bavarian calmness. The CSU's attitude toward 
the Republikaner has not changed: There will not be any 
cooperation with them. Asked whether it is prudent to meet with 
Schoenhuber at this time, Waigel said that everyone has to 
justify this to himself; the party cannot decide this. 
  Bavarian Culture Minister Hans Zehetmair viewed the action 
as 
a temporary clouding of his party colleague's political 
instinct. Streibl will "come to his senses again," his deputy 
of the Upper Bavarian CSU said. Zehetmair ruled out the idea 
that his party colleague might join the Republikaner. "I think 
he is too smart for that." Zehetmair called the Republikaner 
the "declared opponents" of the CSU. 
  Schoenhuber announced: "Streibl did not give me any internal 
CSU information." In the same breath, he yesterday rejected the 
accusation that he had told DER SPIEGEL about the meeting. "I 
state categorically and unambiguously that I did not talk about 
the meeting, which took place months ago, and that I strictly 
adhered to the agreed confidentiality." 
  Yesterday Alliance 90/Greens in the Bavarian Landtag 
demanded 
that Streibl be watched by the Land Office for the Protection of 
the Constitution. Anyone who cultivates friendly contacts with 
the chairman of a right-wing extremist party and fans hatred of 
foreigners must be counted among the sympathizers of this party, 
which is hostile to the Constitution. Interior Minister 
Beckstein, who is officially responsible to such requests, did 
not want to comment. He is on vacation until Ash Wednesday, it 
was said in his office.

<F P=106> Article by "ff.": "Moellemann's New Liberal Strategy--Paper </F>
on Modernization: Leaner State, Lower Taxes"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 1 Feb--[Juergen] Moellemann, the Free 
Democratic Party (FDP) chairman for North Rhine-Westphalia, 
announced his long-expected "proposal for a new liberal 
strategy" today. The document, which the former German economics 
minister drafted jointly with four other FDP political leaders, 
contains the FDP's independent position on government 
modernization, the economy, and society as a whole. In support 
of the new ideas, Moellemann proposes to conduct a "propaganda 
campaign unhampered by coalition concerns and commitments to 
political alliances." The campaign is to be buttressed by 
"independent candidates for high government offices." He and his 
co-workers are calling for a "lean government" based on 
large-scale privatization of government programs, "vigorous 
reform" of fiscal policies, and cuts in taxes and social 
insurance deductions. The social insurance system is to be based 
on individual responsibility. 
  Speaking in Duesseldorf, Moellemann maintained that the Bonn 
government coalition has reached a low point in popularity. The 
polls, conducted during the past six months, indicate that the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) 
would obtain "somewhat less than 30 percent" of the vote if the 
Bundestag election were held at this time--with the FDP 
obtaining about 6 percent. This situation calls for decisive 
action, he said. Legislation to shore up the national and 
laender budgets must be passed this spring. If nothing is done, 
this, too, would "send a message," Moellemann said, stressing 
the position of his party's leadership that a decision on 
coalition plans should not be made until after the summer 
recess. He said he believes that a decision on this matter might 
be reached, but this would have to wait on developments during 
the next few months. 
  At the moment, Moellemann said, the political party 
landscape 
is undergoing a sea change which is why it makes sense for the 
FDP to concentrate on what it has to offer to the voters on its 
own. Moellemann reiterated his intention to vote for Social 
Democratic Party (SPD) presidential candidate Johannes Rau, if 
it comes to a third ballot in the federal assembly. He disputed 
the contention of chairman Solms of the FDP Bundestag caucus 
that he and chairman Rohde of the FDP caucus in the Duesseldorf 
land assembly are the only ones to have decided to do so. 
Moellemann's "proposal for a new liberal strategy" was 
co-authored by Rhode, North Rhine-Westphalian politician 
Tschoeltsch, and Bundestag deputies Friedhoff and Schuessler. 
The 39-page document was distributed to all FDP land 
organizations today. According to Moellemann, it is to 
invigorate the party's strategy debate as it prepares for its 
convention in Rostock next June. 
  The priority goal, according to the proposal, is the 
creation 
of an "efficiency government" whose programs are to be 
restricted to what is necessary. This calls for the large-scale 
privatization of numerous public institutions such as hospitals, 
old-age and nursing homes, theaters, museums, and libraries. 
"Management" is to take the place of "administration" as part of 
"downsizing the bureaucracy." Moellemann and his 
comrades-in-arms are calling for a reform of civil service 
regulations and for the assignment of civil servants solely to 
governmental functions. The political leadership should set an 
example by reducing the size of the Federal Government and the 
legislatures. The reformers also call for the consolidation of 
laender and for letting the individual laender create their own 
budgets. 
  The FDP politicians would like to introduce a "replacement 
principle" for future legislation, i.e. existing regulations 
would be repealed every time a new law is passed. New markets, 
e.g. information and health services, would require new types of 
legislation. All laws applicable to such services which hamper 
economic development should be repealed by the end of next year 
unless reapproved by parliament. Among other things, subsidies 
should be cut in order to "rescue the budget." As far as hard 
coal is concerned, the Moellemann document suggests retention of 
a "rudimentary mining capability" which could be expanded on an 
ad hoc basis to meet an energy crisis. 
  The paper further proposes a simplification of tax laws 
through the creation of just five types of taxes, i.e. income, 
corporate, value-added, inheritance, and resource taxes. All 
other taxes, church taxes among them, are to be repealed. On 
social insurance the document favors "retention of basic 
benefits" but calls on individuals to make provisions for their 
old age on their own. The employment exchanges are to be 
transformed into regional "employment exchange limiteds" which 
offer unemployed workers as "workers for rent on the market," 
the idea being that "premiums for the labor exchanges and such 
workers are good for competition."

<F P=106> [Dietrich Menkens report: "Greens Develop Strategy for Super </F>
Election Year"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- Renunciation of nuclear power, 
anticapitalism, and environmental protection: With this protest 
program, the Green movement succeeded in entering the German 
legislatures at the beginning of the 1980's. Ten years later 
came the unexpected decline: The party plunged to 3.9 percent 
in the 1990 Bundestag elections. 
  A comeback now seems possible for the Greens (who have, in 
the meantime, merged with the Alliance 90 [to form the Green 
Alternative--GAL]). With a radically changed course, they even 
want to achieve more than 10 percent in the super election year. 
Polls are encouraging them. The institutes predict 
double-digit results. The reason is that the Greens are 
creating a new image. "Money instead of muesli" is their new 
slogan. Former anticapitalists are suddenly turning into 
convinced advocates of the market economy. Mass unemployment, 
flexible working hours, and the privatization of state-owned 
enterprises are central topics of the election campaign. "We 
finally want to address economic issues," strategist Joschka 
Fischer stressed. The head of the GAL in Hamburg, Krista Sager, 
believes that the Greens might turn into a people's party. She 
is confident that she will win the first direct mandate for the 
Greens in the history of the FRG in the upcoming Bundestag 
elections in the GAL stronghold Hamburg. 
  To achieve the high goals, the election campaign is being 
planned strategically. For the first time, all land 
organizations want to wage a joint election campaign. An agency 
is currently coining glib slogans like "Green please." "Ecology 
is no longer necessarily our priority." This is how Saarland 
spokesman Hubert Ulrich described the new strategy. His party 
wants to acquire a stronger profile in the economic sphere and 
enter parliament again after the next landtag elections. To 
everybody's surprise, the Greens in Saarland do not even rule 
out an alliance with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] led by 
Environment Minister Toepfer. The environment minister is not 
against this idea. "There are many points where cooperation 
would be possible." He considers alliances between the CDU and 
the Greens to be quite conceivable. 
  This is no isolated case: In Saxony, the Greens and the CDU 
are also moving closer together. "Why should we not cooperate 
with the Alliance 90," the education expert of the CDU in 
Dresden, Matthias Roessler, asked. "We have a great deal in 
common with many members of our old citizens movement." The 
conservative Deputy Minister President Volker Schimpf expressed 
a similar view regarding a coalition after the elections in the 
fall. "Ninety percent of the functionaries support a coalition 
between the CDU and the Greens," an insider stressed. 
  Things have reached a more advanced stage in Thuringia. In 
the district capital, Meiningen, the Greens officially offered 
the CDU nationwide cooperation for the first time. 
  The CDU group in the city parliament has already signalled 
its interest. In the local elections on 12 June, the citizens 
in Thuringia will, for the first time, be able to vote on this 
unique project. An eastern model with export chances?

  [Text] The tactic came too late. "We rightists," wrote the 
BRANDENBURGER BEOBACHTER, militant newspaper of the extreme 
right-wing German Alternative (DA), "must learn to establish our 
own profile in other themes." The time will come when the 
population will be overwrought by the complex of foreigners, 
leftists, and asylum-seekers. 
  So, in a strategy paper, the neo-Nazis listed alternatives 
from current ecological themes, from the demand for alternative 
energy sources to the limitation of domestic aviation. The DA no 
longer benefited from the cloak of green camouflage. The 
interior minister has since forbidden the organization. 
  But the other radical rightist parties and groups also want 
to utilize environmental protection for themselves--just in time 
for the super election year. Ecological slogans and green themes 
are supposed to make their nationalistic and xenophobic 
objectives presentable. The diagnosis of the Berlin ecologists 
Albrecht Lorenz and Ludwig Trepl: "Avocado-syndrome: green 
shell, brown core." 
  Environmental protection as a cause for the radical 
rightists. "We are the national protectors of the environment," 
states Franz Schoenhuber, chief of the Republikaner, "because 
anyone who loves his fatherland will not permit the landscape to 
be ruined." The German League for Nation and Homeland "is 
calling for consistent protection of nature and species--as an 
expression of love for the people and homeland." The same tenor 
prevails in the DVU [German People's Union]: "Love for the 
homeland, people, and fatherland" are "the best weapons against 
environmental pollution." 
  In the case of the NPD [National Democratic Party of 
Germany], it is clear what is behind the commitment of 
extremists "to an organically grown and clean environment." 
"Living space for us Germans." Consequently: "no further space 
taken up for housing for non-Germans." It is the old 
blood-and-soil ideology in a new package. 
  It is precisely the original ecologists who are coming in 
the 
sights of the guardians of the homeland. The German League roars 
about the "so-called Greens, who want to put an additional 
ecological burden on our homeland already overpopulated with 
more and more foreigners." 
  Nevertheless the "rightist rat catchers" (Greenpeace chief 
Thilo Bode) are availing themselves of the Greens and 
associations for environmental protection. The League for Nation 
and Homeland is now also calling for "state action" against 
"chloric substances that damage the ozone," for example, which 
for years has been a militant theme of Greenpeace. They have no 
ideas of their own in this connection. 
  The Republikaner are the number one ecological populists. 
The 
party program rewritten for the super election year is full of 
confessions on protection of the air, ground, and water to 
secure the "vital foundations of the German people." They offer 
mainstream themes, from the "reduction of agricultural 
chemicals" to "avoidance of refuse prior to utilization of 
refuse." 
  "Quite simply plagiarized," says Joschka Fischer, green 
environmental minister in Hesse, with annoyance. "But the 
decisive thing," according to the top strategist of the 
Alliance, "is not what is in the program but what comes across 
as messages. And with the Republikaner that is `clean nature for 
Germans, and foreigners go home.'" 
  To be sure, Republikaner chief Franz Schoenhuber asserts 
that 
there is "no relationship" between environmental protection and 
foreigners. The postal service does not see it this way. Thus it 
refused to deliver bulk mail from Otmar Wallner, vice chairman 
of the Republikaner in Bavaria. The charge: instigation of the 
populace. Bavaria's protectors of the constitution and the 
postal directorate in Regensburg agree that the slogan 
"environmental protection is incompatible with the arrival of 
more foreigners" produces "a hostile attitude toward foreigners 
that is supposed to be justified through the idea of 
environmental protection." 
  The ecological course of the radical rightists is "reason 
for 
extreme concern," according to the Nature Protection Alliance of 
Germany (NABU). President Jochen Flasbarth now wants to check 
"all program statements to determine the extent to which they 
can be misused by radical rightists." 
  The voters, Flasbarth hopes, would know "that environmental 
problems are so demanding and so complex that they cannot be 
resolved through the hollow logic of radical rightists." 
  It is a dramatic fact, however, that the turning of the 
radical rightist parties toward the environment coincides with a 
phase "in which the environmental commitment of the established 
parties is declining." 
  Radical rightist theoreticians are providing their camp with 
the heaviest caliber weapons for the fight against the 
ecological collapse. Thus, Wolfgang Venohr, historian and member 
of the Independent Ecologists of Germany, is yearning for the 
"ecological dictatorship." "Times of martial law in which 
democracy no longer plays any role" will come. Then "Poles, 
Hungarians, Czechs, Austrians, Swiss, and Slovaks" would have to 
"comply with" the German ecological state. 
  The Germans derive their ecological leadership from their 
holy groves and trees. The conclusion: the peoples of the Nordic 
race are the best protectors of the environment. 
  The germ cell of the fashionable brown theme of the 
environment is considered to be the World Alliance for the 
Protection of Life (WSL) with a veteran president Werner 
Haverbeck, once an official of the NSDAP [National Socialist 
German Workers Party], a confidant of Hess, and head of the 
Imperial League Nationhood and Homeland. In the 1960's, the WSL 
organized the first resistance against nuclear power plants out 
of concern for German genes. The WSL memorandum, "The Question 
of Foreigners as an Ecological Problem," pointed the way. 
  Besides the foreigners, radical rightist ecologists make the 
antifascist reeducation after 1945 and the resulting materialism 
and liberalism responsible for the destruction of the 
environment. This mode of explanation, write Thomas Jahn and 
Peter Wehling from the Frankfurt Institute for Socioecological 
Research in their book "Oekologie von rechts" [Ecology from the 
Right], appears frequently in the radical rightist camp, "even 
among the Republikaner." 
  The environmental organization, Robin Wood, unmasks the 
brown 
notion with a simple counterquestion: "If all the foreigners 
were thought away, would `we' then have empty autobahns, 
manageable garbage heaps, reasonable rates of energy 
consumption, healthy forests and rivers, and sufficiently pure 
drinking water?" It is scarcely likely.

<H5>  Abused Nature </H5>
  DVU [German People's Union]: "The best weapon against 
environmental pollution is love for the fatherland." 
  UOeD [Independent Ecologists of Germany]: "Satellite towns 
for Immigrants: the end for nature and the homeland." 
  NPD [National Democratic Party]: "No to further sealing of 
the land for living space for non-Germans." 
  DL [German League for People and Homeland]: "Protection of 
nature and species as an expression of love for the fatherland 
and homeland." 
<H5>  [Box, p 42] </H5>
<H5>  Republikaner--a Coat of Green </H5>
  In the 1987 party program of the Republikaner, the Frankfurt 
social scientists Thomas Jahn and Peter Wehling see "vestiges of 
the Nazi jargon" in the party's ecological themes. There 
environmental protection serves only to "preserve the German 
nation, its health, and its ecological living space." 
  In 1990, the Republikaner declared environmental protection 
to be a "patriotic responsibility." In 1993, the party linked 
specific demands for environmental protection with xenophobic 
themes. To preserve an environment worth living in, it is 
necessary "to end further immigration of foreigners to Germany." 
<H5>  [Box, p 41] </H5>
<H5>  "The German People Are Not Stupid" </H5>
  Interview with Joschka Fischer, chief strategic of the 
Alliance, on the radical competitors in ecology: 
  [FOCUS] The radical rightist parties have discovered the 
"green" subject of environmental protection. Do you fear the new 
competition? 
  [Fischer] No, not at all. The so-called envirnonmental 
commitment of the radical rightists amounts to this: a clean 
environment for the Germans, and foreigners get out. Neither Mr. 
Frey nor Mr. Schoenhuber will get far with this. The German 
people are not stupid. But I heard this aggressive thesis for 
the first time not from a radical rightist party but from Mr. 
Gauweiler. He has been bugging us for two years in the 
conference of environmental ministers with a combination of 
ideas on protecting nature and warding off immigration. 
  [FOCUS] The radicals declare ecology to be a "right" cause. 
The basic prerequisite is supposed to be love of the homeland. 
Is environmental protection becoming a cause of people living in 
the past? 
  [Fischer] No. Environmental protection is a theme of the new 
and young middle strata. They, including employees, are our 
voters. Today the worker in the automotive industry also knows 
that an environmentally sound product planning is a prerequisite 
for a secure job. The bellowing stag on the wall and nonsense in 
the back of the heads of rightists will not be enough to get 
control of the ecological crisis. That is clear to most voters, 
even if the radical rightist parties keep on trying through 
national blood and soil themes to stir up fear of excessive 
foreign influence. 
  [FOCUS] The radical rightists are using ecological arguments 
in an anti-Europe course. Is Europe ecologically precarious? 
  [Fischer] We are definitely in favor of the European Union 
[EU]. But the decisive shortcoming is the lack of democracy. For 
us Maastricht is the end point of the European unification from 
above. But: it would be the worst possible folly in history to 
lose Europe, a step backward to the centuries-old tradition of 
this continent, which is rather dreadful. The fact that after 
power trivialities, hegemonic conflicts, and wars we are now 
betting on integration as one of the greatest achievements since 
the end of World War II. 
  [FOCUS] But Europe is moving backwards in environmental 
protection. For example, the EU is reducing the recycling quotas. 
  [Fischer] But there are also many decisions of the EU that 
go 
further than our national decisions. Germany is being sued on 
many points by the European Court, because we are not adhering 
to environmental guidelines. In the issue of refuse, Germany is 
the dirtiest country in Europe. We are one of the largest 
exporters of wastes in the world. We are the country without a 
general speed limit, with the very highest motorization density, 
the greatest industrial concentration, and the largest area used 
in road construction. Not everything that the EU does is golden 
but there is no alternative to a joint environmental policy.

<F P=106> [Juergen Voges report: "Militant Police Defend </F>
Republikaner"] 
  [Text] Hannover -- Friday evening [11 February] about 
2,000 mostly young people protested in front of Hannover's 
Stadthalle building against an election campaign event held by 
Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber. After a rally, called 
by trade unions, Greens, and the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD], 1,000 Lower Saxon policemen used extremely harsh 
measures to put an end to all attempts to block the Republikaner 
event. 
  After a protest march to the Stadthalle, which was 
completely 
cordoned off, Helga Christensen, Hannover district chairwoman of 
the German Trade Union Federation, and IG-Metall district head 
Juergen Peters made speeches, pointing to the connection between 
mass unemployment and the danger from the right. Hannover Mayor 
Herbert Schmalstieg (SPD) said at the rally that it was a 
mistake to have leased part of the Stadthalle to the 
Republikaner. Schmalstieg regretted that the city's attempt to 
ban the Republikaner rally failed because of a decision by the 
Administrative Court. 
  After the rally, calls to block the Republikaner event were 
issued by megaphone. Previously there had been individual 
brawls between young demonstrators and Schoenhuber fans. Eggs, 
fire crackers, and bottles occasionally flew in the direction of 
the Stadthalle or the police. The police acted with 
extraordinary brutality against the remaining demonstrators. A 
mounted police unit galloped into the crowd. Three water 
cannons fired at the Republikaner' opponents. Individual groups 
of demonstrators were herded together and beaten with 
truncheons, even while some of the demonstrators were already on 
their way home. 
  The leftist group Anti-Republikaner Action Alliance later 
spoke of "a police operation as Hannover had not seen for a long 
time." Gila Altmann, spokeswoman of the Alliance 90/Greens Land 
Executive Committee, criticized the police operation as 
"excessive and brutal." Within just a few minutes the police 
made the first, second, and third calls on the demonstrators to 
disperse, so that afterwards they could act against the 
anti-Schoenhuber demonstration with all possible harshness. One 
cannot speak at all of de-escalating behavior by the police, 
which had been agreed on beforehand.

<F P=106> [Report by Renate Koecher: "Back to the Big Ones"] </F>
  [Text] Until recently, there seemed to be only one trend 
for the big parties: a downward one. Every election and almost 
every opinion poll showed low ratings for the Social Democratic 
Party [SPD] and the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], while 
right-wing extremist groups, the Party of Democratic Socialism 
[PDS], and other protest parties won remarkable successes in 
land and municipal elections. To many people it seemed certain 
that an increasing number of voters would turn away from the big 
parties in the Bundestag elections. With the German tendency to 
feel terror in anticipation of possible events, memories of the 
Weimar Republic were evoked. 
  In this process, most people did not realize that the 
weakening of the popular parties is by no means a law of nature. 
There are two settings that decrease popularity of the small 
parties and concentrate voters' attention on the big parties. 
If a problem affecting national fate is to be decided in 
elections and if the two popular parties take clearly defined 
oppositional views on it (this was the case in 1990 when the 
CDU/Christian Social Union's [CSU] unrestricted commitment for 
unification stood against the SPD's tendency to slow down the 
process), then a polarization between the two popular parties 
in a question that deeply concerns the nation strengthens these 
parties and decreases interest in new groups. The second 
setting is competition between two big parties, a situation, 
where voters consider a change in power possible, but by no 
means certain. This is the case today. 
  It is, therefore, hardly surprising that the trend toward 
small parties and protest groups has been stopped for the time 
being. Over the past few weeks, the CDU/CSU and the SPD have 
gained support, while all other parties have lost potential 
voters. In December, 8.4 percent of those polled wanted to give 
their second vote in the Bundestag elections to the Free 
Democratic Party [FDP]. By the end of January, only 7.7 percent 
intended to do so. The share of those who wanted to vote for 
Alliance 90/Greens sank from 10.2 to 9 percent; support for the 
PDS went down from 5.3 to 3.4 percent. Support for the 
Republikaner has declined by almost 50 percent, from 4.6 to 2.7 
percent, the lowest figure since January 1992. In contrast to 
that, the SPD has gained just under 4 percent, the CDU/CSU 2 
percent. For the first time since 1991, the SPD is supported by 
more than 40 percent of the population. Together, the two 
popular parties currently achieve 76 percent, distinctly more 
than the 1993 average, which was 69 percent. 
  Parallel to growing support for the two popular parties, the 
conviction is increasing that one of them will reach a majority 
capable of forming a government, together with a small coalition 
partner. Only 26 percent of those polled expect a grand 
coalition, while 47 percent consider such an alliance unlikely. 
  The strong fluctuations in party preferences and the great 
number of undecided voters show that the outcome of the 
elections is completely open. At the moment, the SPD is in the 
lead. Its candidate, Scharping, gets more support from the 
voters than Chancellor Kohl. But when Rau and Lafontaine ran 
against Kohl, the starting position was the same. Just how 
unstable the preference for a particular candidate is, can be 
seen from the answers to the question in whom those polled would 
put the most confidence in case of a foreign policy crisis: If 
the situation in Russia gets more critical and this threatens 
Germany, the population favors Helmut Kohl as chancellor at a 
proportion of two to one.

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Poll on Security: Parties Failing"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- Trust in the competence of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and Christian Social Union 
[CSU] has declined dramatically regarding internal security. 
Only 10 percent of the German people believe that the CDU/CSU 
"is working hardest to ensure our safety from crime." This is 
the result of a representative poll conducted by the Allensbach 
Opinion Research Institute in November 1993. Ten years ago, 71 
percent of those polled affirmed that the CDU/CSU was taking 
care to effectively combating crime. In its history, the 
CDU/CSU has not had to accept a more massive loss in trust -- 
and that in a key policly area. 
  However, the people also attest to the failure of the other 
parties. Only 5 percent cite the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany as the party that is doing most against crime, 1 percent 
the Free Democratic Party of Germany, 1 percent Alliance 
90/Greens, and 3 percent the Republikaner. The comment by the 
Allensbach institute: "The fact that 80 percent answer this 
question with `no party' or do not have an answer is an 
extremely alarming sign." Furthermore, the opinion research 
institute has discovered that the Germans' fear of crime 
increasing further has become one of the people's main worries. 
In the west of the republic, 49 percent of people are afraid 
"that crime is going to increase in Germany;" in eastern Germany 
this is felt by as many as 65 percent. A total of 44 percent 
feel threatened by crime in their everyday life. One in four 
said they had been a victim of robbery during the past three 
years. 
  Asked about the most important reasons for increased crime, 
38 percent of those polled by the Allensbach Institute cite 
unemployment; 24 percent point to "wrong education," 22 percent 
to the "crisis in values and meaning," 14 percent to foreigners, 
13 percent each to the welfare and leisure-time society as well 
as to the media, and 12 percent to politics. 
  The people's demands for large-scale measures to restore 
public order are clear: 76 percent interviewed by the Allensbach 
Institute called for better equipment for the police, 69 percent 
want the police to be given more rights and potential in their 
work, and 59 percent demand stricter laws. Currently, 31 
percent even think that the death penalty should be reintroduced 
in Germany. A total of 48 percent of citizens think that 
stricter education of children and adolescents is necessary. 
  Against the background of steadily rising crime, the 
Allensbach Institute comes to the conclusion: "There are no 
indications that the latest measurement...describes the climax. 
The signs of anxiety among the people point to a storm...."

<F P=106> [Article by Helmut Loelhoeffel: "SPD Prefers To Rely on </F>
Experienced Politicians in European Elections; SPD Will Campaign 
Against Racism and Nationalism in June Election and Try To 
Appeal to Foreigners"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Against the background of the national and 
regional elections later this year all the political parties are 
getting ready for the upcoming elections to the European 
Parliament on 12 June. The Alliance 90/Greens were first to 
decide on their slate of candidates. The FDP [Free Democratic 
Party] will name its slate this weekend, and on 25 January the 
SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] will hold its 
conference of delegates. 
  "We consider ourselves the advocates of German interests in 
Europe," the SPD call to the conference states. There are four 
issues on which the SPD proposes to focus both in terms of 
European policy and in the campaign for the 99 seats allotted to 
Germany: to create new jobs and social democracy; to maintain 
the living standard on our continent; to enhance protection 
against crime; and to safeguard the peace and to defend against 
the new nationalism and racism. The SPD hopes that these slogans 
which will appear probably in one form or another in the 
programs of the other parties will help it to retain at least 
the 36 seats it presently holds in the Strasbourg parliament. 
  Germany's Social Democrats are trying to enlist the public's 
support by stating that "with your vote you are saying yes to a 
strong, just, ecologically viable, and peaceful Europe." They 
are appealing not only to the indigenous population but in 
particular to 1.5 million citizens of foreign countries living 
in Germany who are able to vote for the first time ever. Polls 
have shown that support for the SPD among foreigners is greater 
than average. The campaign manifesto does not specifically 
address the roughly 1.5 million voters but the names of Wijsma 
Zimmermann, a Dutch woman, and Jannis Sakellariou, a Greek, 
appear on 36 of the safe seats the SPD expects to win. 
  The SPD believes its chances are good. To be sure, after 
winning 40.8 percent of the vote in the first European election 
in 1979, the party slipped to 37.4 percent five years later and 
stagnated at 37.3 percent in 1989; but in view of the fact that 
the party is unified on European policy it believes it will do 
better this time. Part of the reason for the SPD's strong 
showing in the first go-round was the fact that Willy Brandt 
himself appeared on the ballot as the top candidate. Katharina 
Focke, a female political leader of the time, occupied that 
position on the SPD slate in the second election and in the 
third election the party named Gerd Walter, a virtual unknown 
nationally, who had made a name for himself as a deputy in the 
European Parliament and subsequently became a minister in the 
cabinet of Schleswig-Holstein. This time around the top position 
on the ballot went to Klaus Haensch, an even more inconspicuous 
member of the party. 
  Haensch, 55, who was born in Silesia and now lives in 
Duesseldorf, is listed in the Bundestag directory as a 
publicist. A member of the SPD since 1964, Haensch worked as 
press spokesman in the North Rhine-Westphalian Science Ministry 
and has been a member of the European Parliament since 1979. 
From the start he has held important posts in the socialist 
caucus of which the German social democrats are a part and which 
was recently renamed the caucus of the Social Democratic Party 
of Europe (SPE). Haensch has been deputy chairman since 1989. 
  However unknown Haensch may be outside his home district of 
Mettmann, he is highly regarded and successful in Strasbourg, 
Luxembourg, and Brussels. He considers it an achievement that he 
got the SPE caucus "more rapidly than some others" to react to 
the changes in Germany "at a time when even the SPD itself had 
not yet begun to adapt to the new situation." He is also proud 
of the fact that he managed to obtain a consensus for the 
controversial increase in German seats in the European 
Parliament from the present 81 to 99 in the near future "in 
close cooperation with Reinhard Bocklet of the Christian Social 
Union (CSU)" who now holds the post of minister of agriculture 
in Bavaria. Haensch also claims "that I did my bit in getting 
the SPE caucus to agree to the Maastricht Treaty." Other German 
members of the European Parliament call Haensch "extremely 
goal-oriented and convincingly diligent," i.e. qualities which 
make up for his lack of charisma. The SPD leadership vainly 
looked for attractive top candidates. In the end, the party 
decided to put up "experienced people" rather than to offer the 
voters some media personality who might not deliver as expected 
later on. Haensch deplores the fact that "we no longer have 
exemplary European candidates such as Willy Brandt or Katharina 
Focke to offer but that is something we have to live with." 
  The truth of the matter is that the SPD representatives to 
the European parliament are perfectly presentable. They may be 
underestimated by the German media and go unnoticed back home 
but they are highly regarded wherever European policy is made. 
Those who are not running again include Hans Peters, the 
European parliament's vice president; Thomas von der Vring, the 
chairman of the budget committee; Klaus Wettig, a fiscal expert; 
South Africa expert Barbara Simons; Dieter Schinzel, a media and 
Arab world expert; Leyla Onur, a social affairs expert; and Karl 
Mihr, the chairman of the factory committee at the Kassel VW 
plant. The new SPD candidates--40 percent of the first 36 on the 
list are women--include Bundestag deputy Barbara Weiler from 
Fulda and Fritz Kuckelhorn, a metal workers union official from 
Cologne. 
  The SPD planners do not view this election as a "test" for 
the Bundestag election although Haensch thinks that "it will 
indicate a trend." Detlev Samland, a European Parliament deputy 
and a member of the SPD campaign committee, has been given the 
job of coordinating the European election with the other 
elections this year. The campaign which will be kicked off at 
the delegates conference in Bonn on 25 February will conclude 
with a rally in Duisburg in June and will cost less than 30 
million German marks. Twelve buses with small theater companies 
will be sent around the country for purposes of publicity and 
information, cultural presentations and discussions. TV spots 
have been recorded, a computer game has been produced; fan club 
soccer tournaments are scheduled; pamphlets and leaflets are 
being distributed, including a European pocket glossary which 
provides information on a whole range of topics such as exhaust 
gas emissions and fiscal intricacies. 
  Haensch admits that a great many SPD members feel that they 
are out of their depth in the campaign. To provide missing 
information, the party headquarters has been distributing 
briefing material based on the concept "fit for Europe." But 
Europe is a "difficult subject," Haensch says. "Part of every 
meeting always sounds like an adult education seminar."

<F P=106> [Thomas Koeller report: "Controlled Actions From the Right"] </F>
  [Text] The chief prosecutor general's office (BAW) in 
Karlsruhe is investigating five persons suspected of having 
produced and disseminated the neo-Nazi brochure DER EINBLICK 
[THE INSIGHT] as well as being members in right-wing extremist 
criminal organizations. Wolfgang K. from Ruesselsheim is said 
to be the leader, and is currently in detention pending trial. 
The other four, who belong to the inner circle of the FRG 
neo-Nazi scene, have not been arrested. 
  About two months ago DER EINBLICK was disseminated through a 
Danish post office box. The brochure contained 40 pages with 
names and addresses of political opponents. During a search 
last week, police arrested 25-year-old Wolfgang K. He is 
accused of having written the text and the introduction. In 
contrast with the other four suspects, Wolfgang K. was not 
previously known. 
  In Rodach in Upper Franken, the Bavarian Land Office of 
Criminal Investigations searched the apartment of right-wing 
extremist Eberhard Hefendehl. Investigations were initiated 
against him. For eight years Hefendehl has been publishing the 
openly racist, anti-Semitic brochure DER SCHEINWERFER [THE 
SPOTLIGHT] in his "ODAL publishing company." The 63-year-old 
man is also said to have printed the first 500 copies of DER 
EINBLICK. Hefendehl has excellent contacts in the FRG Nazi 
scene. He closely cooperates with Kai Dalek, of the Kronach 
cadre of the militant "New Front Association of Like-Minded 
People" (GdNF), who boasts of having spied on leftists before 
the "Rudolf Hess memorial marches" and on the "KOMM" youth 
center in Nuremberg. 
  Hefendehl was not only able to publish materials written by 
convicted right-wing terrorist Manfred Roeder and Erhard Kemper, 
former chairman of the North Rhine-Westphalia "Liberal German 
Workers Party" (FAP) in DER SCHEINWERFER, but also articles by 
Christian Worch from Hamburg, who is the chairman of the GdNF 
and one of the leaders of the "National List" (NL) in Hamburg. 
Via the NL brochure INDEX, Worch plays a leading role in the 
anti-antifa [anti-antifascist] activities. The paper of the Aid 
Association for National Political Prisoners (HNG), which 
regularly contains one anti-antifa page, was also disseminated 
via Hefendehl. 
  Hefendehl is also doing business on the international level. 
The Austrian office of DER SCHEINWERFER is headed by 
Otto-Rudolf Braun. He publishes articles in BAUERNSCHAFT 
[PEASANTRY], which is published by neo-Nazi Thies 
Christophersen, who fled to Denmark. DER SCHEINWERFER is 
disseminated not only in Europe, but also in South Africa, 
Namibia, the United States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and 
Chile. Last spring 23-year-old Stefan Cumic, from Wiesbaden, 
traveled through Chile, where he reportedly collected money for 
the publication of an anti-antifa brochure. "Over the past two 
and one-half months I, myself, was abroad (visiting German 
emigrants in Chile and Argentina) to make propaganda for the 
idea of DER EINBLICK at the international level," he writes on 
24 May 1993. This admission is available to the BAW. 
  Cumic, who is now being investigated by the BAW for being a 
member of a right-wing extremist criminal association, announced 
the publication of DER EINBLICK as early as in September 1992, 
in the GdNF brochure NEUE FRONT-WIDERSTAND [NEW 
FRONT-RESISTANCE]. However, nothing came of it. 
  Instead, "National Info-Telephone" (NIT) in Mainz regularly 
announced the addresses of post office boxes belonging to 
regional anti-antifa groups and called for the collection of 
material. Neo-Nazis Michael Petri (21) and Sascha Chaves (21) 
from Mainz are behind NIT. The BAW had suspected Petri, former 
member of the banned German Alternative and now federal chairman 
of the newly founded German Nationalists, and Chaves of having 
participated in DER EINBLICK since the beginning of December. 
Both were arrested following searches of their apartments.

<F P=106> [Heinz Heck report: "Audit Office Attacks Ruehe"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The Audit Office is criticizing the defense 
minister's procurement policy. The concrete reason is Volker 
Ruehe's intention to refrain from using partly brand-new combat 
and transport helicopters (Mi-24 and Mi-8) of the GDR [German 
Democratic Reublic] National People's Army (NVA). In the 
opinion of the Audit Office, the use of the equipment might save 
up to 1.5 billion German marks [DM] from 1994 to 2002, while, 
"however, the transport and operational opportunities of the 
Bundeswehr helicopters would be improved." At the same time, 
the Cabinet committed Ruehe to saving an additional DM1.25 
billion in his budget in 1994 alone. 
  The helicopters are the only armored ones owned by the 
Bundeswehr and they could thus effectively support dangerous 
humanitarian missions (Somalia) or such of the new 
"crisis-reaction forces." It is assumed that the reason for 
Ruehe's resistance is that he either does not want to correct a 
former decision of his house or fears that the plans for new 
helicopter models would then be stopped for the time being. The 
budget committee of the Bundestag will deal with the topic at 
the end of February, since an agreement between the Audit Office 
and the ministry was not achieved last week. 
  According to the Audit Office, the limited use of the NVA 
helicopters would permit the earlier replacement of outdated or 
unfit helicopters and accelerate the planned transition to more 
powerful machines. Moreover, the planning of new construction 
programs by the Bundeswehr and industry is ensured. 
  The Audit Office also criticized the delayed and incomplete 
delivery of documents. In May 1993, the Audit Committee of the 
Bundestag (a body in the Budget Committee) called on Ruehe "to 
check the further use of the total stock of all available 
helicopters by means of cost-benefit analyses and analyses of 
demand and to reconsider, above all, his decision to refrain 
from using the Mi-24 combat helicopters and the Mi-8 transport 
helicopters." 
  The Defense Ministry stated that all necessary examinations 
had already been carried out earlier. The Audit Office said: 
"Nevertheless, a new examination, which was internally checked 
by the Defense Ministry until January 1994, was going on until 
September 1993. The present report contains a survey of the 
'Bundeswehr's helicopter planning'; however, it neither contains 
the requested analyses of demand nor cost-benefit analyses, but 
it only recompiles already known information." 
  According to the Audit Office, the Defense Ministry's 
assumptions in its cost accounting for the use of the two NVA 
helicopters are "incomplete or incorrect," which disadvantages 
the NVA material. The Defense Ministry's statement that there 
are no documents that show the costs of use by the NVA are not 
available is "wrong."

<F P=106> ["cri"-attributed report: "Exports to East Asia Rising </F>
Strongly This Year Again"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- As a result of the continuing 
strong growth in most East Asian countries, domestic exports to 
this region of the world are expected to increase strongly again 
this year. However, according to the Institute of German 
Economy (DIW), this will not result in stimulating economic 
development. In order for this to happen, exports would have to 
grow by more than 10 percent, which was the average rate 
achieved over the past few years. "However, a noticeable 
acceleration of demand from the East Asian countries cannot be 
seen." 
  Furthermore, the relationship between imports and exports is 
essential in order to assess the economic effects of business 
with East Asia. Imports from East Asia are, however, still 
clearly higher than exports to this region. "Without a further 
reduction of the deficit in trade with these countries, one 
cannot expect expansion of exports to have an economic effect on 
the overall economic development." For the current period it is 
not certain whether the deficit will continue to go down. Last 
year, the trade deficit amounted to 26 billion German marks 
[DM], according to DIW estimates, following DM32 billion during 
the previous period. As a result of German unification, the 
deficit skyrocketed from almost DM22 billion in 1990 to about 
DM38 billion in 1991. Scientists doubt that the reduction will 
continue during the current period. "The East Asian states have 
become cheap and internationally dominant suppliers of important 
electronic goods, and will try to keep their markets abroad 
despite the continuing weak economic development." Therefore, 
imports from this region will probably stagnate in 1994 or even 
rise a little, the institute thinks. 
  Machine-building, about 26.5 percent, made the greatest 
contribution to German exports to East Asia in 1992. 
Road-vehicle construction followed with 18 percent, the 
chemical industry with 16.5 percent, and electrical engineering 
with 14 percent. Thus, together these four branches composed 
three-quarters of the exports to this region. Yet, they only 
contribute about 58 percent to overall German exports. The most 
important purchasers of German products are Japan, China, and 
Taiwan. Thus, in 1992 more than 16 percent of machine-building 
exports to East Asia went to Japan; China's share was similarly 
high. 
  However, the rising exports to East Asia must not cover up 
the fact that there is a large pent-up demand in this region. 
One-fifth of total U.S. exports already go to East Asia. In the 
statistics for Germany, this proportion is only about 10 percent.

  [Text] Vienna, Feb 23 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency on Wednesday [23 February] gave North Korea until 
the end of the month to announce the date it will allow 
international inspection of seven of its nuclear sites, 
officials said. 
  It said that if North Korea does not meet the deadline, IAEA 
director general Hans Blix will call for another meeting of the 
agency's Council of Governors to press the UN Security Council 
to impose sanctions on Pyongyang. 
  The sources added that the IAEA would abstain from calling 
the deadline an ultimatum so as not to impede on ongoing 
negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea. 
  "A large number of board members... asked the director 
general immediately to convene a board meeting in the absence of 
satisfactory developments in connection with the inspection," 
said board chairman Ronald Walker. 
  The members had asked that the meeting be called "notably if 
a firm, early date for the start of the inspection had not been 
settled by the end of this month," he added. 
  Western diplomatic sources said China in particular had been 
opposed to setting a specific deadline. 
  Earlier Wednesday, the IAEA Council of Governors meeting 
here 
was told by the Pyongyang delegation that North Korea has 
informed the United States it would be ready to allow inspection 
of its nuclear sites as of March 1, but on four conditions. 
  The main condition is a public announcement of the 
cancellation of the annual joint U.S.-South Korean manoeuvres 
code-named "Team Spirit," Ho Jin Yun, the advisor to the North 
Korean Embassy in Vienna, announced. 
  He did not specify what the other conditions were, but 
implied that they were still under discussion in New York. 
  A Western diplomatic source said Pyongyang's proposal 
"changed nothing" with regard to the IAEA's talks here. 
  The IAEA and North Korea agreed last week on ways of opening 
up seven nuclear sites to inspection under the framework of the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  Ho accused Blix Wednesday of orchestrating a "political 
plot" 
aimed at casting fresh doubt on Pyongyang's nuclear activities. 
  In a speech to the Council he denounced the IAEA's demand to 
carry out special inspections as "tantamount to an attempt to 
drive the Democratic People's Republic of Korea out of the NPT." 
  The IAEA is pressing to carry out inspection of two sites at 
Yongbyon, where it suspects Pyongyang is stockpiling liquid and 
solid nuclear waste which could come from a military nuclear 
programme. 
  In his opening report on Monday, Blix stressed that unless 
the IAEA were allowed to visit other sites and have access to 
extra information, it would not be able to verify whether 
Pyongyang's initial declaration on its nuclear programme was 
full and accurate. 
  Walker said after Wednesday's meeting that the board 
"expressed its continuing deep concern at the seriousness of the 
situation and its support for a negotiated, peaceful solution of 
the nuclear and other security issues of the Korean peninsula."

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 23 (AFP) -- NATO is in no hurry to 
extend its Sarajevo air strike ultimatum to other regions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, sources at North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation headquarters here said Wednesday [23 February]. 
  Speaking after a meeting of NATO ambassadors, one source 
said 
the "Sarajevo model" -- the threat of force to achieve an end to 
fighting -- could work elsewhere only if more ground troops were 
available to implement it. 
  NATO managed to produce a ceasefire around Sarajevo, plus an 
end to the bombardment of the Bosnian capital and a withdrawal 
of Serb heavy weapons, by threatening air strikes after a 
midnight deadline last Sunday. 
  Since then, there has been considerable pressure for taking 
the same action to stop fighting around other besieged Bosnian 
towns, such as Srebrenica, Mostar and Tuzla. 
  A diplomat said the "Sarajevo model" might not be used 
elsewhere, at least in the near future, because priority was 
being given to re-launching the stalled Bosnian peace process 
between Serbs, Muslems and Croats. 
  "Is it the right time to complicate things with the Russians 
and the parties to the conflict by waving a big stick?" he asked. 
  Earlier Wednesday, Russian President Boris Yeltsin suggested 
a five-power summit to deal with the conflicts in ex-Yugoslavia. 
  The NATO ambassadors also agreed that it was too early to 
consider making more Sarajevo-type air strike threats elsewhere, 
because the nature of fighting was different in each region, the 
sources said. 
  At Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, road routes for 
humanitarian 
aid are blocked and Canadian peacekeepers are trapped in the 
town. 
  In central Bosnia, the fighting involves infantry rather 
than 
artillery, with civilians trapped in between. At the southern 
town of Mostar, Croats are battling Muslems. 
  In the northeastern town of Tuzla, the United Nations has 
given no official date for forcing open the airport which has 
been kept closed by Serb artillery. The NATO sources say they 
are waiting for UN instructions.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 24 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister 
Francois Leotard Thursday [24 February] called on the United 
Nations to act "as fast as possible" to reopen the northern 
Bosnian airport of Tuzla. 
  Tuzla airport, closed since May 1992, is surrounded by Serb 
forces who have refused to allow UN humanitarian flights into 
the Muslem-held city from where aid could be dispatched to other 
people in the northeast of the country. 
  Reopening of Tuzla airport "had to follow immediately in the 
steps of the Sarajevo operation," Leotard told France Inter 
radio station, speaking of this month's North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation (NATO) ultimatum to force Bosnian Serbs to withdraw 
heavy weapons from around the besieged Bosnian capital. 
  "Everything has to follow up immediately on the Sarajevo 
ultimatum" even if force has to be used, the minister also said. 
  NATO has also called for the reopening of Tuzla airport, but 
so far has refrained from issuing an ultimatum to the Serbs in 
this respect. 
  The UN has indicated it hoped the airport might be opened to 
humanitarian flights in March.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 24 (AFP) -- Western creditor countries 
have quietly granted Russia a further dose of debt relief to 
encourage Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's newly-revamped 
government to speed up the pace of economic stabilization and 
reforms, Western diplomats said here Wednesday [23 February]. 
  They disclosed that official creditors in the Paris Club 
recently granted Russia a four-month extension -- until the end 
of April -- on last year's agreement to reschedule over ten 
years a massive 15 billion dollars of debt service and interest 
arrears due in 1993. 
  Group of Seven (G7) finance ministers are expected to assess 
the implications of the latest political upheavals in Moscow 
when they meet near Frankfurt on Saturday. Their agenda is 
expected to include a review of the closely linked issues of 
Russian debt, economic stabilization and reform efforts and the 
flow of external aid to back them. 
  The creditors' decision, described by debt negotiators as a 
"short-term measure," was therefore seen as a significant 
development by Paris experts. The extension, according to 
diplomats associated with debt negotiations, may ease the 
Russian debt service burden by an estimated 2.0 to 3.0 billion 
dollars during the January-to-April period. They stressed it 
was agreed in the hope "that by then the Russians will be able 
to negotiate a new programme with the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF)." 
  Monetary sources indicated Wednesday that talks underway in 
Moscow since February 1 on a new IMF arrangement with Russia 
were marking time. The Russians "have not made enough progress 
in drafting their policies" and have been unable to present "a 
sufficiently serious" programme, one official explained. 
  The result was a joint decision to put off until later a 
planned secrecy-stamped visit to Moscow this week by IMF 
managing director Michel Camdessus, the same sources said, 
stressing this did not mean that an understanding would not 
eventually emerge. 
  With some G7 countries -- in particular the United States -- 
urging the IMF and other international institutions to provide a 
larger share of Western aid to Russia, concern has been mounting 
that Chernomyrdin's reshuffled, conservative cabinet may delay 
much-needed economic stabilization and reform moves. 
  Camdessus, who is to present an interim report to the G7 
ministers, is likely to voice his concern about the absence of 
action by Moscow to check rising inflation and reverse the 
growth of Russia's balooning budget deficit. This would be 
among conditions that Russia must meet in order to secure the 
disbursement of the second and last 1.5 billion dollar 
installment of a special IMF credit granted Moscow just before 
last July's Tokyo summit of G7 leaders. Monetary sources ruled 
out any easing of the conditionality required under the IMF's 
charter. 
  The Fund has recently drawn fire from some U.S. 
Administration quarters on this count but has secured firm 
support from U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and from 
other G7 members, they said. 
  "We need to see the Russian (reform) process moving ahead, 
so 
that aid may follow," a senior European official commented. 
  The World Bank, which has so far granted Russia loans 
totalling about 1.4 billion dollars, meanwhile has a project 
pipeline of nearly 6.5 billion dollars, but finds it difficult 
to speed up disbursements. 
  "Nobody can accuse us of not trying," a senior Bank official 
said, but "it takes two sides to implement a project." 
  Besides unblocking an additional 1.5 billion IMF credit, an 
accord with the Fund would give the go-ahead for serious Paris 
Club talks on a rescheduling of debt service falling due this 
year on an estimated 60 billion dollars of official debt, from a 
total ex-Soviet debt now set at about 85 billion dollars. 
  Recent IMF figures show that last year's 15 billion dollar 
rescheduling accounted for nearly half of Western financial aid 
for Russia announced for 1992-93 and so far actually delivered. 
  At their Tokyo summit the G7 countries endorsed a 43.5 
billion dollar package of bilateral and multilateral aid for 
1993, which contained some of the components of a similar 24 
billion dollar package initially unveiled by then U.S. President 
George Bush early in 1992. 
  Out of the total of 55 billion announced, only 38 billion 
had 
been delivered as of last month, including the debt relief 
offered by the Paris Club, IMF data show.

  [Text] [Announcer] President of the Republic of Albania 
Sali Berisha signed the Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative 
in Brussels today. First he met NATO Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner. For more details, we go over to a telephone report by 
Aida Shehu: 
  [Shehu] The meeting expressed a common concern over the 
situation in the Balkan region, and [it was noted] that the 
attention of the international community is concentrated on 
Bosnia at a time when it is evident that the problem of Kosova 
is a key problem, and that without resolving it there can be no 
solution to the regional crisis. At the meeting concern was 
also expressed over the division of Bosnia, because, it was 
said, this division favors the aggressor and creates premises to 
set up new states through force. 
  The meeting also focused on the increasing expansion of 
relations between Albania and NATO, a concrete sign of which is 
the signing of the PFP initiative. 
  The Woerner-Berisha meeting lasted for about 30 minutes. In 
the presence of the North Atlantic Council, President Berisha 
gave a speech before signing the PFP agreement. After 
expressing his thanks to the North Atlantic alliance for the 
invitation to our country to cooperate as a partner, Berisha 
stressed that he was confident the decision to further 
cooperation with the former communist European countries taken 
at the NATO summit in January this year constitutes a historic 
step in the life of our continent and the whole international 
community. NATO is now the only military alliance in our part 
of the world that, because of its moral values and military 
potential, has the indisputable responsibility for peace, 
security, and European stability. NATO is today the only great 
hope to cure Europe and the international community from the 
Bosnian (?penitent) syndrome. 
  Later, President Berisha stressed that as a country fully 
interested in stable peace in the region. We [Albanians] should 
stress that over the last 20 months, developments at a military 
level, together with the many defeats of the negotiations, 
clearly testify that dividing Bosnia is a hopeless option to end 
the war and establish peace. The time may have come to replace 
it with another option that respects the principles of 
preserving Bosnia's integrity, the right of the people to turn 
back to their centuries-long hearths, and does not reward the 
aggressor. President Berisha said that, though the defense of 
these principles seems difficult at first sight, he thought this 
was the only way to establish peace and it was many times more 
productive than the acceptance and implementation of contrary 
principles. 
  President Berisha reminded those present that one of the 
great knots of the present Balkan crisis is undoubtedly the 
problem of Kosova. There should be no solution to the Balkan 
crisis without solving the Kosova issue. That is why Berisha 
asked them that the question of Kosova, which could at any 
moment trigger a Balkan war, be accorded the proper gravity and 
the dimensions that it possesses. For this reason, he said, I 
consider it very important to link sanctions on Serbia to the 
situation created by Serbia in Kosova, to dispatch UN monitors 
to the province, and to exert pressure on Serbia so as to start 
negotiations with the legitimate representatives of this 
province within the framework of the Geneva conference, as well 
as to make a clear inventory for the return of all the violently 
seized institutions and to solve its status by respecting the 
human and national rights of 2 million Albanians who live in 
their ancient territories. 
  President of the Republic of Albania Sali Berisha signed the 
PFP agreement at 1045 [0945 GMT] in the presence of the North 
Atlantic Council members.

<F P=106> [Statement by Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock; place </F>
and date not given: "We Need Security Zones Everywhere"] 
  [Text] The cease-fire in Sarajevo is the first positive 
approach in this bloody Bosnian war after a long time. Now 
there must be a "follow-up": A conclusion must be the 
establishment of additional security zones -- which we have been 
demanding for one year: Bihac, Tuzla, Gorazde, Srebrenica. 
There must be military reactions to every violation of these UN 
protection zones. This means that NATO has to continue to 
maintain its operational readiness at any time. If two to three 
real security zones are created -- as has, for example, now been 
achieved in Sarajevo -- a new, large-scale peace conference 
would be conceivable. However, a concept has not yet been 
developed. 
  The problem of Sarajevo has not been solved yet by the 
observation of the ultimatum. Effective humanitarian help has 
to be organized now. After the conclusion of negotiations with 
the European Union, I will increasingly devote myself to the 
Bosnian conflict. At present, I am making intensive efforts to 
gain partners for a children's hospital in Sarajevo and for an 
action that enables children from Sarajevo to relax in Vienna.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Michael Fink </F>
and Georg Nowotny; place and date not given: "`When Everything 
Goes Wrong, It Is the Government's Fault'"] 
  [Text] [WIENER] The mobilization of the Austrians 
conducted by opponents to EU membership, who range from the 
extreme left to the extreme right, seems to be functioning well. 
There are initiatives, meetings, and mailings all over the 
place. Why does one get the impression that the opponents are 
faring better than the supporters? 
  [Mock] It's human nature; it is simpler to oppose something. 
The second point is that this phenomenon primarily occurs in 
medium-sized and smaller states; consider the Danes, the Irish, 
and the Portuguese. There is a fear that one will be swallowed 
up when one becomes a member of a larger entity, that one will 
lose one's identity, and fear can be turned into a very 
effective political instrument. 
  [WIENER] The government's arguments tend to be based on the 
intellect, and those of the EU opponents tend to stem from the 
heart, from gut feeling. Should the government not rethink its 
approach? 
  [Mock] There is definitely something to be said for that. I 
believe one must convince people by using political arguments. 
Economic, ecological, and financial issues play a part, but the 
most important question is why Austria should belong to the 
European Union at all. 
  [WIENER] So, why should it? 
  [Mock] First, it is the first practical chance for Europe to 
avoid national wars between participants in integration. The 
second argument is security. We should learn from the dramatic 
events in former Yugoslavia that when it comes down to it, we 
are alone. The third argument is that we do not want to become 
a second-rate country that only carries out the wishes of others 
without having any say in matters. 
  [WIENER] As far as security is concerned, many Austrians 
fear that if their country is a member of the European Union and 
the Western European Union, it will be drawn into foreign 
conflicts that have nothing to do with Austria. 
  [Mock] We will never be drawn into anything of the kind by 
the European Union. The European Union has neither decided nor 
can it decide if we should participate in a war, because it does 
not possess the authority to do so. 
  [WIENER] Nevertheless, the population does have fears of 
that nature. 
  [Mock] Well, that is what I have to explain. It cannot be 
done just through brochure's and posters; these media definitely 
do not achieve the desired result. The government and those 
groups that support a united Europe, from Gmuend to Leibnitz, 
from Bregenzerwald to Marchegg, must speak continually to 
citizens. 
  [WIENER] So, would you have had the emphasis in EU 
advertising placed elsewhere? 
  [Mock] Yes, I would have done so. 
  [WIENER] So, what direction would you have chosen? 
  [Mock] I would have opted for political talks and political 
arguments, and emphasized the importance of safeguarding jobs. 
  [WIENER] The chancellor has been much criticized for his 
statement that Austria must join the European Union without any 
ifs and buts. Does this kind of "either or" policy not reduce 
our scope for flexibility? 
  [Mock] One has to acknowledge that a politician is also a 
human being who has emotions. The fact that the chancellor 
supports the conditions I put forward in Brussels shows that 
Chancellor Vranitzky does not support an unconditional 
membership on our part. 
  [WIENER] Many critics say that the government would stick 
its head in the sand and not discuss what would happen if the 
result of the EU referendum is a no? 
  [Mock] A head-in-the-sand approach would be wrong. In that 
case -- as I always say -- we would not starve. However, we 
would be in a much more difficult situation competitively. 
There would be a whole list of very concrete disadvantages one 
could list. 
  [WIENER] However, that is happening. 
  [Mock] One would have to formulate that differently, the 
current discussion is far too polite. 
  [WIENER] The government could counter the horror scenarios 
being put forward by EU opponents should Austria join the 
European Union with horror scenarios about what would happen if 
Austria does not join. 
  [Mock] One should, without creating horror scenarios, state 
clearly what would happen. That is enough. Ninety percent of 
the domestic textile industry would collapse. That would also 
be the case with automotive industry supplies. Our current 
unemployment rate of between 3 and 4 percent, which is very good 
in international terms, would increase to between 5 and 7 
percent. To maintain the same level, we would have to work 
harder generally and work harder at restructuring in particular. 
  [WIENER] So, in the final period before the referendum, one 
one should describe the disadvantages very clearly. 
  [Mock] The self-criticism that one should not formulate 
matters in too populist a manner is often an admission that one 
is unable to state things clearly and plainly. 
  [WIENER] The supporters of EU membership also have to 
contend with the fact that part of the retail and wholesale 
trade is afraid of tough EU competition. 
  [Mock] The basic problem is undoubtedly that the Austrians 
are often too fainthearted. The reality of the past few decades 
shows that we are better than we believe. 
  [WIENER] There are even businessmen who are members of the 
Austrian People's Party [OeVP] and the Economic Federation 
financing the opponents of EU admission. 
  [Mock] I have never asserted that short-sightedness is 
restricted to the members of other parties. 
  [WIENER] What is better for admission to the European Union 
-- a referendum before or after that Nationalrat elections? 
  [Mock] That is something about which I, myself, am unsure. 
However, I would be inclined to prefer a referendum before the 
elections, because the European Union is currently very ready to 
accept an expansion of membership. The mood can change. 
  [WIENER] What will happen if you lose the referendum? Would 
you then support another referendum, as was the case in Denmark 
following the Maastricht flop? 
  [Mock] No, I would definitely not favor that, because then 
citizens feel they are being mocked. However, I am in favor of 
analyzing the mistakes that were made and those lay primarily 
with the government. Irrespective of that, European unification 
remains a fact. 
  [WIENER] So, if things go wrong, it is not the fault of 
the people, but of the government? 
  [Mock] It is primarily the fault of the government. There 
might also be other factors. One must be fair and admit that 
among the opposition there are very different views about the 
European Union. When the government and all the groups that 
want a peaceful Europe really make an effort, then we will 
receive the backing of the Austrians. 
  [WIENER] Could Austria obtain more in new negotiations if 
the outcome were a no? 
  [Mock] One should not have illusions that the European Union 
will make as substantial concessions as they made to the Danes, 
because we have not joined. The European Union does have a 
certain interest in seeing Austria join, but we would be 
deceiving ourselves if we thought it could not exist without us. 
  [WIENER] Would a clear defeat for the government in the EU 
referendum prompt you to resign? 
  [Mock] I will definitely not resign and I will continue to 
struggle for European integration. 
  [WIENER] It is a question of the post. 
  [Mock] I have already suffered enough defeats and not given 
up. One gives up if one has made a serious that will bring harm 
to the country or something that would have benefited the 
country is lost, and if one makes serious mistakes in carrying 
out one's duties or breaks the law. 
  [WIENER] Regarding harm, you have always staked heavily on 
the federal president as a unifying figure and as someone who is 
a leading supporter of EU admission. Can that weapon still be 
used following the scandal surrounding his marriage? 
  [Mock] I think a significant number of Austrians draw a 
distinction between private and political problems. The 
president continues to carry the same weight on this issue as 
before. I do, of course, realize that what a politician does is 
never completely private. 
  [WIENER] The republic's top crisis manager did not perform 
all that splendidly in his own case. 
  [Mock] That it was not a pleasant matter, and was not 
pleasant for the president too, is obvious. He also knows it 
has tarnished his image, but he has retained all his capacity 
for political action. 
  [WIENER] Observers say this affair has not only harmed 
Klestil, but also the OeVP, which created Klestil, and has 
benefited the Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], that 
is, Vranitzky. 
  [Mock] It is true it has not helped us but, at the same 
time, the president is not a party functionary. 
  [WIENER] He is at least a figurehead for the OeVP. 
Following the breakdown of his marriage, this symbol of 
conservative hopes no longer quite shines in the same way as it 
did a few months. 
  [Mock] Show me a politician who always shines. 
  [WIENER] The entire OeVP is currently in anything but a 
strong position, it has maneuvered itself into a historical low, 
and has give up seeking a leading position, even if only 
verbally. As former party leader and honorary chairman, what 
way out of this situation is there? 
  [Mock] Those responsible must give their full support to 
party chairman Dr. Busek, and do so when the situation is 
difficult, too. Second, a lot of work must be done on making 
what our party stands for more clear-cut, so that people know 
what the party wants. Over the past few years, our party also 
undertook reforms that carried a risk of unpopularity: the 
railroad reforms, the second taxation reforms, and privatization. 
  [WIENER] Evidently, the OeVP has been unable to convince 
people that it is such an important reform party. 
  [Mock] There was not enough done to present our position, to 
provide information. And things were expressed too 
diplomatically to put it mildly. The citizen wants to know 
where his party stands and what a politician's concrete position 
is. 
  [WIENER] So, it is rather like the case of the EU 
propaganda. Less intellect and more from the heart, more gut 
feeling. 
  [Mock] Yes, exactly, and more precise statements. 
  [WIENER] In the case of cooperation with Haider's Freedom 
Party of Austria [FPOe], the course you are following is rather 
different from that of Erhard Busek. Would an OeVP-FPOe 
coalition be a possibility following the next elections? 
  [Mock] I also completely support Dr. Busek's course on this 
issue. What I warned against was the systematic exclusion of 
Dr. Haider as a quasi-Nazi. Whoever adheres to the rules of the 
game has a right to be accepted as a democrat whether one likes 
him or not. The second line of argument that I do not like is: 
When the liberals and the socialists cooperate, then they are 
reformed characters and liberals. When they work together with 
us, they are Nazis. 
  [WIENER] So, is the OeVP-FPOe coalition.... 
  [Mock] ...an option that cannot be considered at the present 
time, because the grand coalition has addressed important 
structural issues, partially solving some of them, and because 
it faces important tasks. 
  [WIENER] If you suffer a major defeat in the elections, 
would you be in favor of the OeVP going into opposition? 
  [Mock] Under certain circumstances, that would certainly be 
an option to be considered. 
  [WIENER] The Austrians admire you for being so incredibly 
hard-working and disciplined. Stress can also affects one's 
health. How do you feel? 
  [Mock] I feel very well today, but I will soon feel much 
better, because hopefully and in all probability, a positive 
decision will be reached in the EU negotiations. 
  [WIENER] And that will affect your health? 
  [Mock] It will affect my feeling of well-being. 
  [WIENER] Would you consider remaining foreign minister under 
a fourth Vranitzky cabinet if called upon? 
  [Mock] It depends on whether I feel fine. If one has not 
slept well for three days, is constantly rushing around the 
world, and things do not work out, then one naturally considers 
how long one should remain in the government. 
  [WIENER] So, the decision also depends on the state of your 
health. 
  [Mock] It will depend on the political situation, but also 
on what one can still do after 30 years in politics. 
  [WIENER] But if it is possible, you would carry on? 
  [Mock] If it is possible, I would.

  [Text] Austria's exports to East Europe in 1993 rose by 5 
percent to 59.3 billion schillings; the surplus now already 
amounts to 16.3 billion schillings. The most important partner 
is Hungary (7.9 billion schillings), which is the fifth largest 
buyer of Austrian goods in the world. Exports to The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Croatia, Albania, and Slovenia 
experienced a particularly strong upswing.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Losses in Trade With Germany"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- In 1993, Austria's foreign trade with 
Germany saw the biggest decline since the end of World War II. 
Although the downward trend in exports has slowed down somewhat 
over the past few months, exports decreased by a total 6.1 
percent, to 182 billion Austrian schillings, Guenter Graf, the 
Austrian trade commissioner in Frankfurt, said. 
  These figures indicate an above-average decline in exports 
to 
Germany -- with total 1992 exports going down by 4.3 percent. 
Imports from Germany amounted to 234 billion schillings, that is 
8 percent, or 20 billion schillings, below last year's figure. 
The trade deficit with the FRG sank by 14.1 percent, to 52 
billion schillings. In 1993, 39 percent of Austria's exports 
went to Germany, compared with 40 percent in 1992. Imports from 
Germany currently account for 41.5 percent of all imports; in 
1992 the figure was 43 percent.

<F P=106> [Report signed "jost": "East European Economy Shakes Off </F>
Depression"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- An economic recovery is becoming visible 
in Central and East Europe. In Russia and the other successor 
states to the Soviet Union, however, there is no hope for an 
early stabilization. This is the content of the most recent 
economic report by the Vienna Institute for International 
Economic Comparison (WIIW). Concerning the East European reform 
countries, the institute revised its forecast slightly upward 
for this year. 
  Whereas Poland was the only country with a positive growth 
rate last year, the WIIW experts expect the decline of economic 
activities to continue only in Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. 
Particularly since the second half of 1993, there has been a 
noticeable production increase in the reform countries, Gabor 
Hunya, the author of the study, stated. 
  Growth is primarily sustained by domestic demand. The export 
situation is very difficult at the moment. "Whereas imports 
into the reform countries rose by 18 percent in the first three 
quarters of 1993, exports dropped by 1 percent," Hunya pointed 
out. "This is in line with Western interests." Only the Czech 
Republic was able to increase its exports because, as a result 
of the devaluation of the koruna at the beginning of the 
reforms, is still enjoys big cost advantages. 
  However, the production increase has not yet had an impact 
on 
the employment situation. Unemployment rates are still rising 
in these countries. The WIIW expects rates between 7 percent 
for the Czech Republic and 18 percent in Slovenia and Slovakia. 
  In Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, the development was 
characterized by a major production decline and hyperinflation 
-- which stands at 1,000 percent per year in Russia -- in 1993. 
A reversal of the trend is not yet in sight, the Russia expert 
Peter Havlik pointed out. The political and social chaos 
prevents a stabilization. These economies are particularly 
affected by the collapse of trade among the CIS states after the 
dissolution of the ruble zone last autumn. 
  Despite the unfavorable election results for the camp of 
reformers, Havlik does not see a danger for Moscow's reform 
course. Even in the past it was not possible to implement 
radical reforms. Since the middle of 1992, a reorientation aimed 
at financial stabilization to support production has been 
observed. The current government in Moscow may even turn out to 
be more efficient because it is homogeneous, he stated.

<F P=106> [Report signed "voel": "Crimes Down 1.7 Percent"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- Two weeks ago, Interior Minister Franz 
Loeschnak presented the "most pleasing," but only preliminary 
1993 crime statistics: Criminal offenses decreased by 0.5 
percent. On Tuesday [22 February], he presented the final 
figures: The total number of criminal offenses went down by 1.7 
percent in 1993. The total number of offenses committed was 
493,786, that is 8,654 fewer than in 1992. 
  The decline in crimes is reflected in eight of the nine 
provinces; only in Vorarlberg was there a 7.7 percent increase. 
At 6 percent, Burgenland saw the biggest decrease; in Vienna 
the crime rate went down 1.4 percent. 
  Justice Minister Nikolaus Michalek said that for the first 
time in seven years the number of crimes fell. The Justice 
Ministry will present a draft to change the criminal law in 
order to be better able to fight major crime. This should hit 
organized crime particularly where it is most vulnerable, at its 
financial center. It must be made easier to get at the profits 
from criminal offenses, Michalek said. 
  Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] Chairman Joerg Haider 
accused 
the interior minister of "being at war with truth." He said 
Loeschnak was doing "first-rate cosmetics." If fewer offenses 
are indicated, this is due to the fact that fewer are being 
registered. 
  Haider also criticized the fact that criminals continue to 
draw social benefits, such as unemployment and social welfare 
benefits, while they are in prison. "The longer you are in 
jail, the richer you get," he concluded. 
  The Justice Ministry rejects these accusations: The fact is 
prisoners draw neither unemployment benefit nor social welfare 
benefits. It is only after release from prison that they have a 
right to social welfare benefit, or -- if they worked in prison 
-- unemployment benefit. Incidentally, the FPOe was involved in 
passing this regulation in parliament.

<F P=106> [Alain Guillaume report: "Strange Letter to Jean-Luc </F>
Dehaene: Belgium in Danger Unless it Pays 350 Million to Khan's 
Friends?"] 
  [Text] Everybody remembers the arrest in Brussels last 
October of separatist leader Amanullah Khan, president of the 
Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front [JKLF]. Mr. Khan had been 
invited to a roundtable organized by the European Socialist 
Deputies' Group. A Western intelligence service had been 
informed of this visit, passed on the information to the Belgian 
Criminal Investigation Department, which passed it on to the 
gendarmerie. Although Mr. Khan had a Pakistani passport and a 
visa issued by our embassy in Islamabad, he was reported to 
Interpol by India, which accused him of heading a terrorist 
group. 
  The case caused a sensation at the time but, after two 
months 
of detention, Amanullah Khan was expelled by the Belgian 
Government to Pakistan. Case closed? 
  Not really. A few days ago a letter -- the existence of 
which had been kept a close secret until now -- written on 
behalf of the JKLF and apparently signed by Mr. Khan, reached 
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. Its author demands, in the 
name of the JKLF, the payment of compensation of $10 million 
(350 million Belgian francs) for the arbitrary detention which 
Mr. Khan suffered in Belgium. If this sum is not quickly paid 
into a bank account in Rawalpindi (Pakistan), the author of the 
letter states that the JKLF militants will regard Belgium as a 
hostile country. 
  According to information from reliable sources, this letter 
did reach the prime minister's residence (which has said: "no 
comment") and was passed on to the Criminal Investigation 
Department and to the Joint Forces Antiterrorist Group (GIA). 
It is being taken very seriously, although its authenticity 
cannot be guaranteed. 
  Indeed, Belgian analysts think that, for various reasons, 
the 
arrest and subsequent release of Amanullah Khan generated only 
anger and frustration among all those involved in this case: 
The JKLF and its president, Pakistan and India, the United 
States (which has a great influence in that region of the 
world), some European Socialists, and several intelligence 
services. It is therefore not impossible, analysts think, that 
this letter is a forgery by one of these parties and is aimed at 
reviving tension by bringing the Khan case back into the news 
(through the media). In other words, whether genuine or a 
forgery, the "Khan letter" is still important and significant. 
  Does this mean that there is really a threat of attacks on 
Belgium? "No, not really," the intelligence services say, "at 
least not at present." 
  However, one thing is certain: Jean-Luc Dehaene does not 
intend to pay the 350 million Belgian francs into the account 
indicated by his correspondent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Voluntary Service Announced for </F>
1995"] 
  [Text] Voluntary community service should enter into force 
in 1995. The young people involved in it will work in 
nontrading sectors for a monthly wage of about 15,000 francs 
[BFr]. The service will last a minimum of six months, a maximum 
of 12 months, and a maximum of 24 months for foreign service. 
That is the main thrust of the project set up by Defense 
Minister Leo Delcroix that was presented Tuesday [22 February] 
to the press. Voluntary community service (SVC), which is to 
succeed the defunct obligatory military service, covers a period 
during which a person voluntarily provides services aimed at 
improving life in society via a particular institution or 
organization. 
  In principle, SVC will be open to everyone, men and women, 
Belgians and non-Belgians, whether able-bodied or handicapped, 
without any restriction on age. Initially, however, it will be 
limited to young people between the ages of 18 to 25. 
  SVC may, for example, be served in the health and welfare 
sector, the sociocultural sector, in education and aid to young 
people, in the environment or heritage conservation sector, 
security at federal, regional, or local level, or in development 
cooperation. 
  It will still be possible for any candidates who so desire 
to 
undertake voluntary military service. 
  Such candidates may, for example, participate in the armed 
defense of the territory, even though -- during crisis periods 
-- they will not be sent outside the national territory. "This 
is neither a third labor channel nor a special, temporary 
framework," Delcroix stressed. "Nor do we intend to use this 
project to usurp the jobs which have devolved upon professional 
labor." 
<H5>  Methods </H5>
  SVC candidates will enjoy a special contract. They will be 
guaranteed social security protection during their service. 
Thus, this period of service will be taken into account when 
calculating pensions; it will count as a waiting period for 
unemployment; family benefit will be maintained during service 
up to the age of 25 years; and the level of social protection 
(health/disability insurance) will be maintained. 
  Candidates will receive a nontaxable allowance of around 
BFr15,000 per month and will have two holidays per month. At 
present it is impossible to put forward a budget estimate of the 
total cots of SVC in so far as the budget will depend on the 
number of volunteers, Minister Delcroix stressed. The financial 
breakdown of this cost could be as follows: The authority 
concerned (regional or federal department) will pay a portion of 
the BFr15,000 allowance, as well as social benefits, and 
administrative costs. 
  The institution or organization which uses a volunteer will 
pay a fixed amount per person per month, as well as insurance 
premiums for the volunteers involved and any costs for training, 
which it will provide itself. 
  In so far as the regions and communities have broad powers 
in 
the areas for which the SVC would apply, a consensus would have 
to be reached within the negotiation committee, Delcroix 
explained. The organization of the system would be centralized 
among the departments of the prime minister, which would have a 
coordination unit guaranteeing relations between national 
departments, the communities, and the regions. 
  The project is to be submitted to the Council of Ministers 
before the Easter vacation. Negotiations with the communities 
and regions could be organized before 1 August 1994, the project 
could be submitted to Parliament at the end of the year, and the 
SVC could become a reality in 1995.

<F P=106> [Wio Joustra commentary: "Hague Ministries Divided on </F>
`Sarajevo Formula'"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- In Cooperation Development Minister Jan 
Pronk's political testament from this cabinet period, in the 
document entitled "A World in Dispute," there is a call for the 
"decompartmentalization" of Netherlands international policies. 
The PvdA [Labor Party] minister says that the compartments 
between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Development 
Cooperation and Defense should be removed, because the world is 
a global village crying out for an integral approach. 
  If Pronk is looking for an illustration to prove he is in 
the 
right, then he has to look no further than Netherlands policies 
on the crisis in Bosnia. While the "Sarajevo formula" has 
gained an almost magical ring to it at the Foreign Ministry, 
thanks to the success of the NATO and UN ultimatum, it is in 
fact reticence which is steadily gaining the upper hand at the 
Defense Ministry under the influence of the deployment of the 
reinforced airborne battalion in turbulent eastern Bosnia. 
  It is very understandable that Foreign Minister Kooijmans 
wants to use the momentum from Sarajevo to progressively set 
ultimatums in other parts of Bosnia which cannot easily escape 
the stranglehold of the civil war. It is less understandable 
that he should choose the town of Mostar as the next test case 
for the determination of the international community. Unless 
the aim is to keep up the pretense of impartiality and balance, 
because Muslims and Croats are fighting in this town. 
  The understanding for Kooijmans' crusade in political 
circles 
in The Hague ends there. Mostar is not among the six areas 
which were designated as safe havens for Muslims by the United 
Nations last year. Therefore a new resolution would be 
necessary to set a military ultimatum, which would virtually 
certainly run up against a veto from Moscow. After the Russian 
diplomatic success of last weekend, Russian Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev has warned that Moscow has little enthusiasm for a 
repeat of the Sarajevo formula. 
  It is a cast-iron law in international diplomacy that the 
countries which shout the loudest must be prepared to put words 
into deeds. In the case of Bosnia the Netherlands has nothing 
to be ashamed of. In fact, in relative terms it makes the 
biggest contribution to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. 
  But Defense Minister Ter Beek repeatedly emphasizes that The 
Hague, with its promises to the United Nations of some 3,000 
troops, has reached its ceiling. As far as he is concerned 
there can be no possibility of sending more Netherlanders to 
Mostar. 
  Moreover Sarajevo has revealed the limited possibilities of 
UNPROFOR. Even the "soft" UN option of 7,600 UN troops for the 
six safe areas to be protected is a long way from having been 
reached. For this reason, the commander of UN troops in Bosnia, 
General Rose, was forced last week to call in reinforcements 
from other parts of the former Yugoslavia to monitor the 
withdrawal or disabling of Serbian tanks, artillery, mortars, 
antiaircraft artillery, and multiple rocket launchers. 
  Because several hundred Russians were not able to carry out 
this task alone, Jordanians came from Croatia and Malaysians 
from Bihac. Dozens of observers were even used. But two British 
companies from Vitez were also brought in. They were exactly 
half the battalion of British infantrymen who are supposed to 
offer protection to the humanitarian aid convoys of the 
Belgian/Netherlands transport battalion in central Bosnia. This 
is an area where there is strong fighting and the area where 
some 440 lightly armed Netherlanders are operating. 
  Last but not least, another reason why the Defense Ministry 
and Parliament have reacted sceptically to relief of the 
Herzegovina capital is the position of the Croats. 
Countermeasures from Zagreb are definitely not to be ruled out 
if the international community were to turn against the Croatian 
troops who are determined to make Mostar the capital of Bosnian 
Croatia. 
  The hundreds of thousands of refugees are not the only Croat 
"trump card." From the harbor of Split, they manage what could 
be called the lifeline of the Netherlanders who are to be 
stationed in central Bosnia (Lukavac) and eastern Bosnia 
(Srebenica and Zepa) during March. The closure of the Dalmatian 
coast would have disastrous consequences for the successful 
running of the entire UNPROFOR operation in Bosnia. 
  Last March the United States decided to drop food over 
eastern Bosnia using Hercules transport planes. The Foreign 
Ministry felt the Netherlands really ought to participate as 
well and that the Defense Ministry would just have to use F-27s 
and Orions. From the humanitarian point of view everything 
favored this; the only problem is that every royal airforce 
Fokker or Orion crashes every time a door is opened when it is 
airborne. A year later the lack of coordination between The 
Hague's foreign and security policies is again taking its 
revenge.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Hague Sceptical About Bosnia </F>
Plea"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 22 Feb -- The Netherlands Government has 
watered down its position on measures to protect the population 
in the other Bosnian "safe areas." Yesterday Foreign Minister 
Kooijmans spoke of a certain form of ultimatum after the success 
in Sarajevo. He was in favor of action in Mostar, a town where 
the population is being hard pressed by the Croats. 
  This morning the Foreign Ministry spokesman said an 
ultimatum 
could be an instrument and the same strategy could be considered 
as in Sarajevo, but added that "the momentum of this moment" 
could be maintained by other measures as well, including the 
request for air support if the UN troops in Bosnia were unable 
to carry out their duties. This was approved by the Security 
Council last summer, and the NATO fighter aircraft have 
practised these duties. 
  At the Defense Ministry there are quite strong objections to 
applying the Sarajevo model elsewhere in Bosnia. In every new 
action from the air, the danger air actions pose for the ground 
troops must be considered carefully, according to military 
experts at the ministry. Moreover the heavy means of air 
support undoubtedly would lead to an escalation in the violence, 
and the UN troops on the ground would in fact have to go into 
action out of self-defense. 
  The United Nations wants 3,000 extra UN troops in Sarajevo 
to 
monitor the ultimatum. British troops have had to be partially 
withdrawn from Vitez for these duties. The British duties also 
include protecting the Belgian-Netherlands transport battalion 
and taking the lead in a possible evacuation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cabinet Decision To Lower Taxes and </F>
Social Security Charges Gets Positive Reception"] 
  [Excerpt] The cabinet decision to lower taxes and social 
security contributions on citizens and companies by a total five 
billion guilders in 1994 and 1995 has been received positively 
from all sides. Only the opposition in Parliament has 
criticized the way in which the tax reduction is to be financed. 
  In part, the measures will be paid for by the 
higher-than-forecasted fiscal income received by the cabinet 
last year. In addition, the cabinet is assuming that next year 
income will be positive due to the higher growth forecast made 
by the CPB [Central Planning Bureau] for 1995. According to the 
initial CPB estimate, which does not take the tax reduction into 
account, next year growth will be 2.5 percent compared with 
slightly less than 1 percent this year. 
  The cabinet decision is a compromise between the wishes of 
the governing parties. The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] 
wanted most of the money to go to employers, while the PvdA 
[Labor Party] preferred lowering personal taxation. Both 
parties can live happily with the compromise. A CDA spokesman 
described the cabinet decision as a "respectable package, a very 
defendable mix." The PvdA said it was "happy with its main 
points." 
  The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] 
criticized 
this method of finance. VVD spokesman Korte said the cabinet 
was selling something it did not have by spending money now, 
while it was far from certain whether the revenue would appear 
next year. D66 [Democrats 66] also thought the cabinet was 
moving too fast. D66 spokesman Ybema said only a new cabinet 
could make such a decision. Despite these criticisms, both 
parties supported the tax reduction option. 
  In a commentary on the cabinet decision, Prime Minister 
Lubbers said the tax reduction was entirely in line with the 
SER's [Social Economic Council] recommendations on mid-term 
economic policy. 
  In the draft recommendations, the SER calls for taxes and 
social security contributions to be lowered by some 15 billion 
guilders in the next four years. This is intended to boost 
employment. Lubbers estimated that the cabinet decision would 
lead to the creation of some tens of thousands of extra jobs. 
  The reduced taxation is not only good for employment, but 
will also have a positive effect on all incomes, including those 
of people on social security. Finance Minister Kok, the PvdA's 
leading candidate, said this would probably allow the linkage 
between wages and social security to be reestablished in 1995. 
  On Sunday [20 February] Kok called on employers and trade 
unions to make a "social pact" with the cabinet for the coming 
years to increase employment. The cabinet decision means that 
wage increases could remain limited in 1995, according to 
Lubbers. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "VVD and CDA Programs Offering Most </F>
Jobs"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The electoral programs of VVD [People's 
Party for Freedom and Democracy] and CDA [Christian Democratic 
Appeal] are offering the largest numver of jobs for the next 
cabinet period. The PvdA [Labor Party] program would lead to 
the most even distribution of purchasing power. This was 
revealed by the Central Planning Office's (CPB) figures 
published this morning with regard to the electoral programs of 
CDA, PvdA, VVD, D66 [Democrats 66] and GroenLinks [Green Left]. 
  All electoral programs focus on employment. Cuts in public 
spending must yield the necessary funds to reduce labor taxes 
and fees. CDA's cuts during the next cabinet period will be 
highest, i.e., 18.4 billion guilders. The other parties will 
save 17.6 (VVD), 12.6 (D66), 8.8 (PvdA) and 8.4 (Green Left) 
billion guilders. 
  These cuts, announced by the parties in their electoral 
programs, come on top of the 5 billion guilders announced by the 
Lubbers/Kok cabinet in its "Million Note 1994." The decrease of 
taxes and fees decided by the cabinet last Friday [18 February], 
does not take account of this deficit in the budget. The CDA, 
VVD and D66 would have found it wiser if the cabinet had first 
covered this deficit, before reducing payments. "It is a shame 
that a cabinet which is leaving the setbacks for the next team, 
is already handing out bonuses which remain to be seen," VVD 
leader Bolkestein says. "One should not open the sunshade 
before one knows that the sun is actually shining, otherwise one 
might end up in the dark," Representative G. Tepstra, financial 
spokesman for the CDA party, says. 
  The cabinet wants to reduce payments permanently in 1994 and 
1995 by 5 billion guilders. In an interview with our newspaper, 
CPB Manager G. Zalm states: "It seems to me that these 
reductions are excessive, especially if they are not compensated 
fo by adjustments. There is the chance that the next cabinet 
will have to scrape together the cuts required to finance 
decreased income." 
  In the PvdA program, the purchasing power of minimum 
wage-earners and people with an average income (40,000 guilders) 
decreases by 0.25 percent a year. The purchasing power of those 
earning twice the average income, decreases by 1 percent. The 
differences are a little more outspoken in the CDA, VVD and D66 
programs. The purchasing power of the minimum wage-earners 
increases by 0.5 percent in Green Left's program, while payments 
by people earning average and twice-the-average income increase 
heavily. 
  The CDA freezes all social allowances. The VVD also freezes 
allowances, except Old Age Pensions (AOW). D66 reduces 
indexation by more than half, but permits reduction of the gap 
between those on pension and people under 65 receiving an 
allowance. The PvdA wants to apply the indexation of allowances 
to the evolution of wages up to two-thirds during the next 
cabinet period. Yesterday, PvdA Party Leader Kok said that 
there is a "real possibility" that allowances would partly 
follow wages from 1995 onwards. Freezing the allowances has a 
"demoralizing effect. This is already true for a period of one 
year, let alone if you freeze it for four years," Kok stated on 
AVRO radio. 
<H5>  D66 Reducing Deficit to 2.5 Percent </H5>
  D66's electoral program leads to the lowest financing 
deficit, i.e., 2.5 percent of the GNP in 1998 (the present 
deficit is 3.7 percent). The VVD arrives at a slightly higher 
figure, while the other parties arrive at a financing deficit of 
3 percent. This is why VVD and D66 have less leeway in easing 
payments, which in turn has an unfavorable effect on growth, 
employment, and purchasing power over a four-year period. 
  The overall tax burden (sum of taxes and social fee) reaches 
42.0 percent in 1998; the VVD arrives at a slightly higher 
figure. D66 and PvdA reach a tax burden of 43.3 and 43.7 
percent respectively. Green Left reaches an overall tax burden 
of 45.5 percent, due to the implementation of the energy tax. 
It is the first time that Green Left had its electoral program 
audited. The small Christian parties did not have their 
programs audited, although "quality support" was given. 
  In VVD's program, new jobs are the result of a system 
change. 
The VVD introduces a minisystem for new cases, for whom the 
allowance amounts to 60 percent of the minimum wage. "Both in 
1998 and in 2002, the VVD is the job champion, although few jobs 
are created in the public sector," CPB Deputy Manager Van den 
Berg explains. It is remarkable that in Green Left's program, 
employment decreases in the market sector, while the number of 
jobs increases in the public sector.

<F P=106> [Interview with Democrats 66 leader Hans van Mierlo by Frans </F>
Boogaard and Cor van Santen; place and date not given: "D66 
Remains D66"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] According to 
market researchers De Hond, supposedly D66 [Democrats 66] could 
win 45 seats if it set itself further apart from the other main 
parties. 
  [van Mierlo] Radicalism is now in vogue. A determined face, 
and in with the knife. However, I do not believe in that 
approach. Furthermore, it must tally with the rest of the 
party's visiting card. I feel strongly about that: Consistency 
in one's attitude, and in one's presentation -- being 
reasonable. I know that other parties are not bothered about 
this, but that is precisely the difference between us. I am 
governed by my opinions, not by the desire to win 35 seats. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] And yet you, yourself, give rise to 
expectations, for example by reproaching the cabinet for making 
drastic cuts in allowances and administrative blundering in your 
party publication. That gives rise to the expectation that you 
can do better. Will D66 stick to its approach of lesser 
allowances? Can you promise that you will not make any cuts? 
  [van Mierlo] For three years the government has not listened 
to us. The only thing it has done is make cuts -- in everyone's 
budget, but nas not solved the budget problem. Now it is too 
late. We are sparing old age pensions, but linking the other 
allowances to wage movements by 50 percent. In so doing, we 
have opted for a respectable path. The PvdA [Labor Party] is 
suggesting that full linkage is possible, but there is no way in 
which that is true. Freezing levels for the next four years, as 
proposed by the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], is unfair 
psychologically, because doing so would mean excluding an entire 
category in advance, for the next four year, from any possible 
growth in prosperity. We are offering those people receiving an 
allowance the prospect of being able to "half-grow" with the 
economy. However, that approach may also be superseded. I 
cannot give any guarantees. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] Your party congress wants the Betuwe 
[railroad] line to be laid underground, or at least dug into the 
landscape, which would cost an extra four to five billion 
guilders. A ticklish issue in the coalition formation? 
  [van Mierlo] The congress supports the party, but the party 
lost the debate in the Chamber. We are doing our best. We will 
fight terribly hard for this. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] One of your members, Rinnooy Kan, 
president of the employers' federation, sees nothing to be 
gained by the energy tax, for which D66 is making such a strong 
pitch. How eligible is he for a ministerial post? 
  [van Mierlo] I am not talking about ministerial posts. 
Rinnooy Kan speaks as a representative of the employers' lobby, 
and those are clear views. He is an excellent party colleague. 
I know damned well that the opinions he is expressing when he 
says that are those of the employers. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] And yet surely he cannot have completely 
different opinions on, say, energy tax as the D66 minister for 
economic affairs? 
  [van Mierlo] I do not know. I have a difference of opinion 
with employers' president Rinnooy Kan, not with D66 member 
Rinnooy Kan. Very soon there will be a coalition agreement, and 
every future minister will have to comply with that agreement. 
Otherwise he will not become a minister. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] D66 is staking a great deal in the 
campaign on the referendum. However, does Jan Modaal not merely 
want to be able to walk safely down a clean street with a 
reasonably full purse? 
  [van Mierlo] Yes, that is what the rest of the platform is 
about. However, we consider the referendum to be just as 
important. A little more power to the citizens, and a little 
less to the politicians. If the citizens really do not want a 
particular law, then you give them the chance to pull on the 
hand brake. That is of a different political order than the 
energy tax or the fight against crime. People are supporting us 
on that. I also would consider it to be treason retrospectively 
to drop the matter after 25 years. It constitutes part of the 
identity of the party. If we were to drop it, then we would 
have been better off never having gotten started in the first 
place. One has a moral duty to make a go of it. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] If the CDA and PvdA were shortly to 
suffer 
great losses, and the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy] and D66 made tremendous gains, who would then take 
the lead when it came to forming a cabinet? 
  [van Mierlo] One guideline is the size of the party, another 
is who has won the most seats. Mostly it is a cocktail of the 
two. There is no law about it. I believe the most important 
criterion is which party is the largest. And of course, to soem 
extent, parties also look after their own interests. It is not 
merely the quantitative aspect that is important, but also the 
qualitative aspect -- how people emerge from a campaign. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] You stick with your preference for a 
purple coalition? 
  [van Mierlo] As long as you do not write that I raised the 
subject! 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] But could VVD and D66 ever agree? 
  [van Mierlo] I would be the last person to say that 
compromises are inconceivable with certain parties. And I am 
not doing so now, although I will admit there is a large gap 
between the VVD and D66 -- apart from on a few points. The VVD 
has radical views, but I must still see that it keeps going, in 
whatever coalition there may be. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] So purple has precedence? 
  [van Mierlo] I continue to believe that a purple coalition 
would be structurally good for the Netherlands. The question is 
whether the PvdA and VVD can wriggle out of their traditional 
attitude. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] Could you become a minister in such a 
cabinet and also remain a political leader? 
  [van Mierlo] Everything is conceivable, up to and including 
a 
party leadership. I think the most plausible scenario, also for 
our citizens, is one in which I join the cabinet in one capacity 
or other, but I am not ruling out anything.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "D66 Increases Environmental Demands </F>
in Platform"] 
  [Excerpts] The D66 [Democrats 66] party conference has 
increased its environmental demands in its election platform. 
Particularly when it comes to major infrastructure projects, D66 
sets great store by the protection of the environment and 
landscape. The Betuwe [train] line must still be built in a 
ditch and partly underground; the extension of Schiphol 
[Amsterdam airport] must take environmental factors more closely 
into account. [passage omitted] 
  At the election conference, D66 formally designated Van 
Mierlo as its leading candidate Lower House elections. In the 
fight for the candidacy for the European Parliament, the 
incumbent MEP [member of the European parliament], J.W. Bertens, 
defeated his competitor, top European official L.J. Brinkhorst. 
Bertens gained 350 votes, Brinkhorst 300. 
  On Saturday morning, the party summit announced how D66 
would 
make the extra savings of 2.5 billion guilders, on top of the 
10.5 billion called for in its draft program. The extra amount 
for restructuring will be found by cutting back on agricultural 
subsidies, civil servants salaries, road building, the WW 
[unemployment benefits act], family allowances, and the AWW 
[general widows and orphans act]. [passage omitted] 
  Until 1998, D66 wants the provisional package of 13 billion 
guilders to [help] create approximately 100,000 jobs, including 
6,000 in the area of education, 10,000 in the police force, and 
18,000 in the health care sector. 
  According to Van Mierlo, the CDA [the Christian Democratic 
Appeal] and VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] "are 
being tremendously gutsy" by increasing their savings much more 
rapidly for the sake of employment. The CDA intends to save a 
total of 17 billion, the VVD 20 billion. The PvdA [Labor Party] 
is proceeding on the basis of partial separation of wages and 
benefits, which will benefit people covered by the Pensions Act. 
However, D66 wants those pensioners with substantial 
supplementary pensions to pay a premium on their state pension, 
so that, in effect, they will contribute to the maintenance of 
this provision for their old age. 
  Compared with the other major parties, D66 goes rather far 
with its increases in energy taxes (raising the price of natural 
gas for households) and with its reductions on labor taxes. On 
balance, D66 arrives at an average annual tax reduction of 450 
guilders per taxpayer. 
  In his speech, party chief Van Mierlo accused the cabinet of 
having damaged political credibility and alienating citizens. 
The examples he cited included the decision on Zestienhoven, 
and the letter from Minister Bukman on natural gas prices for 
truck farmers. 
  Van Mierlo said: "The most serious thing, to my mind, is 
that the cabinet thinks it can get away with this. The prime 
minister described Bukman's letter as `superfluous and 
constitutionally erroneous.' This now applies to the entire 
cabinet."

<F P=106> [T.T. Oudejans report: "Netherlands Adopts Wait-And-See </F>
Attitude Toward Mexico"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Netherlands companies are also 
showing increasing interest in Mexico, it emerged last week 
during the three-day working visit to Mexico by Economics 
Minister J.E. Andriessen. "We see Mexico as a country in the 
process of stabilization which offers ever greater growth 
potential," the minister said there. 
  The ministry likes to visit Mexico, although the country is 
number 40 in the list of the Netherlands's trading partners. 
Andriessen's previous visit was in November 1991, while his 
secretary of state, Yvonne van Rooy, led a trade mission to 
Mexico only a year ago. 
  In his meetings last week with President Salinas and other 
key figures in various ministries and large Mexican companies, 
the minister had a long shopping list with him. To mention a 
few things: Martinair wants to acquire landing rights, while 
Van Ommeren has shown an interest in providing container 
processing in the Mexican harbors which are to be privatized 
this year. 
  Aircraft manufacturer Fokker is positive about potential 
sales to Mexican airlines, but sees problems in financing 
possible orders. Schiphol is involved in the plans to expand the 
international airport in Mexico City, while there are also plans 
to build a new airport just outside the city. 
  In turn, the Netherlands Government wants to provide 
assistance in developing the harbor in the coastal town of 
Veracruz. Cooperation on the governmental level is also being 
sought in the field of medical technology and, in the spring, a 
return visit by a delegation from the Mexican Energy Ministry is 
expected to examine how coal gasification is conducted in the 
Netherlands. 
  There are opportunities to spare, above all in the 
infrastructure where large investments are expected in the 
coming years in NAFTA's wake. Various Netherlands engineering 
consulting firms have already become involved in this sector. 
In addition Andriessen thinks there are opportunities for 
Mexican industry to set up a European distribution center in the 
Netherlands. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by </F>
Xavier Gautier in Paris; date not given: "Hurd: Serbs Must 
Return One-Fourth of Their Territory"] 
  [Text] [Gautier] After the "success" of the talks in 
Sarajevo, do you think an ultimatum is required to unblock the 
situation in Tuzla and Srebrenica? 
  [Hurd] The situations in those places are different. 
However, we need to open the Tuzla airport and provide relief 
for Srebrenica. A Netherlands reconnaissance unit is already in 
Srebrenica. There is a plan to open an air corridor and channel 
aid from Tuzla (...). It is almost ready to be executed, but 
there are other towns where the suffering is greater: Mostar, 
Vitez, and the Maglaj pocket. The United Nations must prepare a 
plan that is suited to each of these situations (...). 
  [Gautier] After Sarajevo, is the threat of air strikes still 
necessary in Bosnia? 
  [Hurd] Everything depends on what happens. The ultimatum is 
holding in Sarajevo. If the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
forces are attacked anywhere in Bosnia, they will be defended 
from the air (...). I do not rule out the use of force in the 
future (...). 
  [Gautier] The situation in Sarajevo was unblocked following 
Russian mediation. You were the first to welcome the "success" 
of Russian diplomacy. What kind of inspiration does Moscow's 
big return to the Balkans have for you? 
  [Hurd] I would first like to point out that this initial 
success in Sarajevo is due to three factors. First of all, 
obviously, there was the NATO decision. Then there was the work 
on the ground by an excellent British general and excellent 
French troops. Lastly there was the Russian initiative, which 
was very positive. The Russians have always exerted an 
influence on the Balkans. The question is knowing whether they 
are using this influence for the right cause. That was indeed 
the case this time (...). The lesson (of recent days) is that 
we must keep the Russians informed and involved in the peace 
process. 
  [Gautier] Have the negotiations regarding Bosnia, which have 
stalled for months, been given a new boost? 
  [Hurd] I hope so, but I am not sure. I hope that all the 
parties will now admit that military victory is not possible 
(...). Reestablishing peace may take some time yet. We must be 
sure that Europe, the United States, and Russia work together to 
bring the deadline closer. A European peace plan was adopted 
before Christmas. The Americans also have ideas based on the 
same principle: giving the Muslims one-third of the territory 
and access to the sea. There also may be Russian ideas, but 
they are less clear. 
  [Gautier] What solution do you advocate for Sarajevo: a UN 
protectorate or partition? 
  [Hurd] The situation in Sarajevo will temporarily require an 
intense international commitment. I prefer to avoid talking 
about an administrative protectorate, because that solution is 
likely not to be acceptable to any of the sides. 
  [Gautier] Outside Sarajevo the war is continuing, especially 
in central Bosnia. You recently went to Vitez. Can we remain 
confident? 
  [Hurd] The fighting continues in Vitez and Mostar (...). I 
hope that the United Nations will be able to draw up a peace 
plan for these two regions. We now need to see whether or not 
this plan will commit NATO. Perhaps there will be no need, but 
we must not concentrate solely on Sarajevo. 
<H5>  `Permanent Danger' </H5>
  [Gautier] In Mostar, a town besieged by the Croats, the 
situation is rather similar to that in Sarajevo. Will we have 
to threaten the Croats with air strikes? 
  [Hurd] That remains to be seen. Mostar needs a plan ensuring 
the reconstruction of the old bridge, the reopening of the roads 
that cross the town heading toward central Bosnia, and the 
removal of the siege against the Muslims. This plan will commit 
the United Nations, General Rose (...), and perhaps NATO (...). 
  [Gautier] Even if all the sieges were to be lifted, the 
political impasse would remain intact: The Owen-Stoltenberg map 
is not applicable and no Muslim state is viable without access 
to the Adriatic. What is the solution? 
  [Hurd] Peace cannot be imposed from the outside. It must be 
accepted freely. We must try and convince the three sides. The 
positions have already moved closer together, but there is still 
disagreement about the extent of the Muslim territory and about 
the territories into which the Serbs will withdraw. What 
everyone does agree about is that the Serbs must give up about 
one-fourth of the territory that they are occupying. 
  [Gautier] There is a risk of seeing the conflict turn into a 
bloody guerilla war. If that happens, will Great Britain 
withdraw its UN troops, which are particularly exposed in 
central Bosnia? 
  [Hurd] They are currently living in a situation of permanent 
danger (...). At present, the positive effects of our presence 
are greater than the risks being run, which tends to makes us 
lean toward leaving our UN troops there. If the situation were 
to change, it would be possible to draw another conclusion. 
  [Gautier] The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] 
risks becoming the next area of tension in the Balkans. Greece, 
which is one of the parties in the crisis, is a member of the 
European Union. What is your solution? 
  [Hurd] Talks between Greece and The FYROM under the aegis of 
the United Nations are needed to alleviate Greek concerns. I do 
not think it is wise for the Greeks to increase the difficulties 
of the people of that small republic, which is fighting (for its 
survival) in the middle of the Balkans, especially since Greece 
is currently the president of the Community.

  [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd today told Sinn Fein 
that there were now "no good reasons" for further delay in 
responding to the Downing Street declaration on the future of 
Northern Ireland. 
  He warned that whether Sinn Fein joined or stayed out the 
Government wanted to continue to seek political progress through 
talks involving the constitutional parties in the province. 
"There can be no question of Sinn Fein having a veto on 
progress," he insisted. 
  Mr Hurd told a Tory meeting in Westminster: "If Sinn Fein 
and 
the Provisional IRA renounce support for violence and terrorism 
permanently, then Sinn Fein could join this political progress. 
They can then contribute to deciding on the future for Northern 
Ireland by democratic means. The offer is on the table and will 
stay there." 
  Mr Hurd said market research showed that 97 percent of the 
people in Ireland backed the declaration when it was issued. 
  "Only Sinn Fein have given no response. In the United States 
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, obscured the real reason. 
At his party conference this weekend, Sinn Fein have another 
opportunity to give their response. They should do so." 
  Mr Hurd added: "There are no good reasons for further delay. 
Britain and Ireland are today close partners, both in planning 
the future of these two islands and in Europe. We are in 
complete agreement that the future of the people of the island 
of Ireland must be determined by its people. The process must 
be one of self-determination, not one in which others try to 
impose a solution, and not one in which a solution will be 
imposed by a particular party or by violence." 
  He warned: "Moreover -- and this is central to the message 
for Sinn Fein -- an enforced settlement that ignores present 
realities could never succeed. Holding the view that partition 
is wrong does not justify trying to enforce Irish unity. 
Differences within the island of Ireland will never be bridged 
by an imposed settlement. Terrorism can only reinforce these 
differences. What is needed is agreement and consent between 
the people of the island of Ireland, North and South." 
  He added: "It is not for the Government to act as a 
persuader 
for any particular outcome."

<F P=106> [Amir Taheri report: "British Police Preparing To Pursue </F>
`Liberationists' and `Afghans'"] 
  [Text] London -- Police sources in London emphasized 
yesterday that Britain is planning to launch a campaign against 
the "Afghans" from various Arab and Islamic states who are 
active in the capital and and other British cities. 
  The sources said that the most important organization 
targeted by the campaign is an organization which calls itself 
"the British branch of the Islamic Liberation Party." 
  The police has sent documents obtained during the storming 
and searching of houses of some members of the organization to 
the attorney general and the home secretary to take urgent 
measures. 
  The documents include propaganda material calling for the 
hijacking of passenger planes and the use of terrorist methods, 
on the grounds that they are legitimate means, to confront what 
it terms "real enemies of Islam." 
  The organization is accused of inciting racist and 
anti-Semitic feelings, thus violating British law. 
  So far the authorities have not officially proved the 
existence of channels of communication between the British 
organization and the "Liberation" parties operating in the 
Middle East. As is known, one of the Liberation Party's 
organizations was accused recently of trying to assassinate King 
Husayn of Jordan. 
  The Liberation Army is officially banned from operating in 
almost all Islamic states because it participated in violent 
operations in several states, including Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, 
and Indonesia. Its members are known as the Afghan Arabs, even 
though a small number of them actually fought in Afghanistan. 
  Police sources say that the British branch of the Liberation 
Party is active among university students in London, who come 
from more than 20 Muslim countries, and recruits some of them. 
The party is active in Birmingham, Bradford, and York among 
students and emigrant workers from the Indian subcontinent and 
Arab states. 
  Campaigns are launched against other groups operating as 
charity organizations, especially to support Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Farid Qasim, spokesman for the British branch of the 
Liberation Party, yesterday denied the accusations leveled at 
the party by the police. He said that his group is carrying out 
"legal informational actions" dissociated from any "activities 
violating the law." 
  The information about the Liberation Party's activities and 
other groups in Britain came from France and several Arab 
states, according to the sources. 
  The police sources estimated the number of the 
organization's 
members in Britain at "a few score," saying that some of them 
received special training in states like Iran, Afghanistan, and 
Sudan. The organization's members could face imprisonment or 
expulsion from Britain if they are convicted of violating the 
law.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The European Union, as well as the 
United Nations, the United States, Russia, and Canada have 
called on Bosnia and Croatia to seize the opportunity for peace 
offered by the easing of tensions in Sarajevo. After meeting 
for over four hours on Bosnia, Juergen Chrobog, the Foreign 
Ministry political director, said in Bonn this afternoon that 
the senior officials participating in the meeting had expressed 
their readiness to give unreserved support to the process of 
negotiations between Croats and Bosnians. 
  The conference participants want to exploit the dynamism 
resulting from the success of Sarajevo. They decided to work 
closely together in order to promote a speedy solution of the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The prospects of a peace 
settlement have improved. The latest developments in Sarajevo 
are an important step toward ending the war in the whole of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the conference participants said 
they were very concerned about the serious situation in other 
regions of Bosnia. 
  As a first step, the conference wants to see to it that the 
cease-fire in and around Sarajevo is stabilized through an 
effective disengagement of troops. The reappearance of the heavy 
weapons withdrawn from there in other arenas of war must be 
prevented. Free access by road to the capital of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must be guaranteed, and normal life in 
Sarajevo must be restored with the help of the United Nations. 
Free access for humanitarian aid supplies must be achieved for 
Srebrenica, Zepa. 
  The conference also urges a speedy opening of Tuzla Airport 
for humanitarian aid. An effective cease-fire should be imposed 
in Mostar. Military disengagement measures should be taken in 
central Bosnia to achieve a cease-fire between government troops 
and Bosnian Croat forces. Free access for humanitarian aid 
should also be secured in Maglaj. 
  Chrobog stressed the aim of the conference had been to take 
stock rather than make decisions. The results of the analysis 
would now be submitted to the foreign ministers of the countries 
involved. Whether they then meet or whether a conference of 
heads of state and government takes place hinges not least on 
the further development of the peace process between the warring 
parties themselves.

<F P=106> [Margarete Limbach report] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel reiterated in a radio 
interview this morning that he advocates a political solution to 
the Bosnian war. His meeting with his Croatian counterpart in 
Bonn today also served this purpose. 
  The diplomatic merry-go-round regarding the Bosnian war 
continues. The Bonn government, the chancellor, and foreign 
minister have noisily stressed their contribution to the search 
for a political solution to the conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia, and hosted the Croatian Foreign Minister Granic 
today. According to the principle that everybody who has 
something to do with efforts to end the war in the Balkans tries 
to influence that party to the war with whom he maintains good 
relations, Germany is expected to devote its special attention 
to Croatia, which turned from the victim of the Serbian 
aggression into an equally brutal aggressor in the eyes of the 
international community of states a long time ago. 
  Thus, the presence of Croatian Government troops in Bosnia 
was also discussed today. The U.S. intelligence service 
believes that 5,000-6,000 Croatian soldiers are deployed there. 
A UN resolution calls for their complete withdrawal. So far 
the Croats have not provided any clear information, and it is 
difficult to identify the fighting soldiers, because they 
naturally do not wear Croatian uniforms. Yet, Granic promised 
today that Croatia will observe the UN resolution. A total of 
600 Croatian soldiers are to be withdrawn from the Muslim part 
of Mostar in the next few days. As far as Mostar itself is 
concerned, where the Croatian population has suffered at least 
as much as the citizens of Sarajevo, the town is to be placed 
under European control after the adoption of a cease-fire. 
Germany is ready to play a major role here, Kinkel pointed out. 
  In central Bosnia, where a Muslim offensive is taking place 
against the Bosnian Croats, and in other trouble spots, 
officials want to achieve with political instruments what was 
accomplished by means of a military threat in Sarajevo -- that 
is a cease-fire and the disengagement of hostile troops. Kinkel 
does not want to rule out completely the instrument of a 
military ultimatum, but a political solution is to be given 
priority. The Russians have already made it clear that they 
reject the Sarajevo model. 
  Above all, it is now important to make full use of the 
dynamism that resulted from the success of Sarajevo. 
Negotiations between the former allied, but now hostile, 
Muslims and Croats, which will continue in Zagreb today, are 
also a sign of hope. Although efforts are under way to end the 
war in the former Yugoslavia, the Federal Government is still 
skeptical of the proposal submitted by Russian President Yeltsin 
to convene a summit conference. Such a summit would have to be 
prepared carefully, Kinkel stated. He does not believe that the 
time has come yet. He expressed the hope that the Russians will 
prevent the Serbs from using the weapons withdrawn from Sarajevo 
in other places in Bosnia.

  [Text] Bonn, Feb 23 (TANJUG) -- Croatian Foreign Minister 
Mate Granic said on Wednesday [23 February] that Croatia is 
ready to pull out its troops from the former Yugoslav republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina and that it has already withdrawn 600 
soldiers in the past few days. 
  Granic met in Bonn with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel 
to discuss the involvement of Croatia's regular army troops in 
the fighting between the Bosnian Croats and Muslems in Mostar, a 
city in southern Bosnia, and in other regions. 
  The UN Security Council has ordered Croatia to withdraw its 
troops from Bosnia by February 17 or face international 
sanctions. After the deadline expired, the UN secreatry general 
informed the Security Council that about 5,000 soldiers of the 
regular Croat Army remain in Bosnia. 
  Following talks with Granic, Kinkel said there are hopes for 
a peaceful solution to the war in Bosnia especially after the 
favourable developments in Sarajevo, but he underscored that 
there are `several Sarajevos' in Bosnia. 
  In an interview with the German radio Kinkel said that 
Russia's involvement in the peace process in Bosnia is extremely 
important and that there can be no resolution of the crisis in 
the former Yugoslavia without Russia. 
  Granic told a press conference that the Croatian Government 
would do everything so that the problems in Bosnia and in the 
other parts of the former Yugoslavia are resolved in a peaceful 
way through political means.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN)--German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
does not rule out new threats by NATO with the aim of achieving 
further demilitarization in Bosnia-Herzegovina following the 
peace brought about in Sarajevo. After talks with Mate Granic, 
his Croatian counterpart, Kinkel told journalists in Bonn today 
that it is now important to increase efforts to find a political 
solution to end the civil war. The prerequisites for this are 
good. Granic pointed out the negotiations taking place between 
the Croatians and the Muslim Bosnians in Zagreb today. 
  Kinkel emphasized that "Sarajevo" had been "a first small, 
but very important step." Now they will, as if working on a 
mosaic, try to bring peace to the other main crisis areas in the 
conflict. It is important to open Tuzla Airport. It must be 
possible to transport humanitarian aid to the people in the 
disputed areas. 
  The foreign minister announced he would be explaining the 
overall situation in the former Yugoslavia to the cabinet on 
Thursday [24 February]. A "new momentum" has entered the 
negotiations over the past few days that must be exploited. He 
also spoke to Granic about the repatriation problem regarding 
Croat refugees in Germany. Both sides are interested in a joint 
solution.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has 
promised Ukraine further German support to help develop the 
country's economy. Kinkel met Anatoliy Zlenko, his Ukrainian 
counterpart, in Bonn today. Oleh Slepichev, Ukrainian minister 
of external economic relations, and Ukrainian Health Minister 
Yuriy Spizhenko also attended the meeting. 
  Following talks that lasted more than two hours, Kinkel told 
journalists that the country, with its 53 million inhabitants, 
has considerable economic problems. Germany also wants to help 
within the scope of the European Union. Kinkel also stressed 
that Ukraine must be included in the new European security 
structure. 
  Zlenko acknowledged Germany's willingness to support the 
process of economic reform in Ukraine. The country remains on 
the economic reform course. In order to continue these reforms, 
it needs the support of partners, he said. 
  Earlier, he handed a letter from Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The letter contained 
specific requests for help, Zlenko added. He announced that 
Kravchuk will visit Germany soon.

  [Text] Bonn, Feb. 23, IRNA -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel Tuesday [22 February] underlined the significance of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's vital in the world, the region and 
Islamic world. [sentence as received] He made the remark in a 
meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Euro-American 
Affairs Mahmud Va'ezi who is currently in Germany. 
  Stressing that Bonn attaches great importance to Iran and 
Iranians, Kinkel added that Germany would never treat Iran under 
the influence of external pressures. He described as "good" 
Tehran-Bonn relations, and said now that the world is 
increasingly becoming interested in the Islamic world Bonn is 
decisive to take a brighter outlook towards the issue but 
assured it would not impose its ideas on the Islamic states. 
The German official pointed to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and reiterated Germany's support for the Bosnian Muslims, adding 
that they should be helped. 
  Va'ezi who arrived here Monday night on a five-day visit, 
praised Bonn's supports for Bosnians and its initiatives to 
solve the crisis. He also called for further help of Germany 
for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Bosnian 
Muslims. 
  Touching on the issues of weapons of mass destruction and 
regional and global terrorism, Va'ezi announced Iran's readiness 
for any cooperation with Germany and Europe to bring stability 
and security to Central Asia, Caucasia and Persian Gulf regions. 
He welcomed Bonn's more active role in this connection. 
  Welcoming Iran's readiness to have cooperation on human 
rights issue and campaign against terrorism and weapons of mass 
destruction, Kinkel expressed pleasure over the meeting of the 
third Iran-Germany seminar on human rights, to be held in Tehran 
next april. 
  In another development, Va'ezi held talks with his German 
counterpart Dieter Kastropp who said that exchange of visits 
between officials of the two countries was an effective factor 
to preserve and continue bilateral relations. Va'ezi said that 
further Tehran-Bonn cooperation would be to the benefit of 
international interests and would guarantee establishment of 
regional peace and stability. 
  Kastropp called for further cooperation in the field of 
cultural relations through signing agreements in the area.

export guarantees. A spokeswoman for the Federal Economics 
Ministry stated on Tuesday [22 February] that, as far as Bonn is 
concerned, the point is to prevent financial damage, while Iran 
did not want to cut itself off from the possibility of being 
granted further Hermes guarantees. Both sides have differing 
views regarding, among other things, the beginning of the 
repayment of debts and the number of installments. Before the

<F P=106> [Karl-Ludwig Guensche report: "Islamic Terror Threatens </F>
Germany"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- Scientists hold disputing views on 
whether "Islamic fundamentalism" is the correct term, or whether 
one should rather speak of "Islamism." There is some dispute 
among politicians on how dangerous the new religious fanaticism 
is. What is undisputed, however, is that militant Muslims 
around the Mediterranean are reaching for power. It is also 
undisputed that through the war in Bosnia, where most of the 
victims are Muslims, Islamic fundamentalism has reached Europe 
-- and that Germany and France, as the countries with the 
highest Islamic populations in West Europe, are directly 
affected. 
  Bonn government circles and European intelligence services 
agree that a victory of fundamentalists in Algeria and Egypt, or 
even Tunisia and Morocco, would disturb the security balance in 
Europe. 
  Intelligence experts consider Germany to be a "place of 
rest" 
for many fanatical Islamic organizations that are also prepared 
to use terror in Germany. Cambridge orientalist Ahmad 'Akbar 
says that every one of the 14 million Muslims in Europe "can 
turn into a radical activist under certain circumstances."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Half A Million A Day"] </F>
  [Text] Even after it was banned, the left-wing extremist 
"Workers Party of Kurdistan" (PKK) continues its activities in 
Germany: Turkish business people and asylum-seekers of Kurdish 
descent are forced to provide financial support for the PKK 
guerrilla fight against the Turkish state. According to 
information received by the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations [BKA], the PKK wants to collect 500,000 German 
marks [DM] a day in Germany. 
  More and more victims defend themselves: Since the PKK was 
banned in November 1993, the BKA has registered an increase in 
charges filed against those who extort "donations." A total of 
100 cases became public last year, while police are expecting 
significantly more in 1994. Numerous Turks who have been 
exposed to PKK extortion are taking advantage of special 
telephone lines by which they can also provide anonymous 
information. In large cities such as Berlin, Cologne, 
Frankfurt, or Dortmund, police are carrying out investigations 
through special PKK commissions. 
  The brutality of the PKK thugs is reflected in recent cases 
from the files of the investigators: Three men armed with 
handguns beat up a Kurdish asylum-seeker in the Swabian city of 
Schorndorf because he refused to donate. In Dunningen 
(Baden-Wuerttemberg), four PKK men with wooden sticks attacked a 
Kurd for refusing to "donate" DM1,000 a month. In 
Swisttal-Odendorff (North Rhine-Westphalia), one Kurd got a 
thrashing even though he had delivered DM1,200 to Bonn's 
Kurdistan Center before. The PKK thought the amount was too low.

goals of the "Median Cultural Center," which was banned in 
November 1993 as part of the PKK. The organization was notified 
of the ban on Monday. According to Schnoor, fliers and posters 
of the PKK were impounded during a search of four apartments.

Schaeuble by unidentified correspondent in Hamburg on 23 
February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Where does the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU] stand after this party congress in Hamburg? 
  [Schaeuble] Well, despite some pessimistic predictions, at 
this party congress -- just as in Berlin half a year ago -- the 
CDU once again proved that it is cohesive; that with Helmut Kohl 
it is determined to continue leading this country into a good 
future, to complete Germany's unification, to overcome the 
economic problems, to create work for all, and to guarantee 
external peace and internal security. And we know that we can 
do this best with Helmut Kohl. 
  [Reporter] This was also Helmut Kohl's party congress. Do 
you think that his charisma, which has attracted the party here 
in Hamburg, can also be conveyed to the outside? 
  [Schaeuble] Quite certainly, quite certainly. Helmut Kohl 
is the chancellor of German unification. He has been the most 
successful German chancellor for 12 years. It was Helmut Kohl's 
party congress, and the CDU wants to win the 1994 elections with 
Helmut Kohl so as to continue its work for Germany's future.

<F P=106> [Harald Watermann report: "Hintze, the Media, and the </F>
Principles of the CDU"] 
  [Text] Hamburg -- Peter Hintze, general secretary of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU], must have been deeply hurt: 
Immediately after the assertion that only the Christian 
Democrats can lead Germany into a safe future, he struck back at 
the media at the CDU congress in Hamburg. Offended by numerous 
press reports about his person and his ability as secretary 
general, he sharply attacked the media -- "certain magazines 
that invent primitive slogans, which spy on party friends and 
colleagues, which write impertinent serialized stories and 
provide corresponding slogans to the opposition." He told the 
900 journalists who attended the party congress: "I hope you 
contribute to making it possible for the political dispute and 
the formation of public opinion to take place in a matter of 
fact and unpolemical way." 
  Then he turned to the political opponent, the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD]: He accused the party of avoiding the 
discussion of topical issues with the CDU. The only thing the 
SPD has offered in the past few months was obstructionism at all 
levels. 
  The following sentences were balm for the 1,000 CDU 
delegates: "We are winning support. Approval for our policy is 
increasing. Numerous people, including those in the new laender, 
are acknowledging what we have achieved." Then the CDU 
secretary general presented the new basic program of the 
CDU: 

  -  Society: "We want to continue to strengthen the 
family. Those who educate children should pay fewer 
taxes." 
  -  Unemployment: "Our reply to 4 million unemployed is: 
Only a strong economy ensures jobs. We will expand the social 
market economy and create new future-oriented jobs in this 
way." 
  -  Social benefits: "We will restructure the welfare state. 
We need new structures to ensure social justice and social 
balance tomorrow." 
  -  Internal security: "We advocate the right of 
the citizens to security. Concerning `electronic evidence,' we 
would like to tell the Free Democratic Party of Germany: Nobody 
in Germany supports a liberalism that facilitates the work of 
dangerous criminals." 
  -  Europe: "We will make Europe strong. 
Europe must never again be powerless in view of murder, rape, 
and immense suffering." 
  -  Environment: "We will develop a global 
environmental strategy that will offer the poor an opportunity 
for development through their own strength. It remains our task 
to preserve what God has created." 
  The deputy chairman of the CDU Bundestag group, Heiner 
Geissler, noted a crisis of confidence in the CDU. In a speech, 
which was received with prolonged applause, he stressed that 
confidence and competence cannot be restored through "pride in 
oneself" but only through arguments.

<F P=106> [Report by Thomas Klaus: "Flogging for `Germany Haters'"] </F>
  [Text] Sometimes big is not big enough. This seems to be 
the opinion of the Alliance for Overall Germany -- Voters 
Association of East Germans, Central, and West Germans (BGD) 
[Bund fuer Gesamtdeutschland -- Ostdeutsche, Mittel, und 
Westdeutsche Waehlergemeinschaft], which has its seat in 
Duisburg. Thus, it considers unification with the former GDR 
just one step on the path toward the creation of "Overall 
Germany," which would include, among other areas, Memelland, 
Eastern Prussia, Gdansk, Pommerania, Western Prussia, Eastern 
Brandenburg, Silesia, and the Sudeten region. 
<H5>  "German Reich Continues To Exist" </H5>
  The BGD basic program says it clearly: "The German Reich did 
not cease to exist as a subject of international law in 1945. 
It simply lost its ability to to act as a result of military 
occupation." At the federal party congress in Miltenberg in 
April 1993, the strictly rightist splinter party hungered for 
retaliation: "The annexation of foreign territory and the 
driving of people away from their homes" must be "made good 
again" because it is a "most serious strain on any community of 
peoples," a "crime." 
  However, things have not yet gone that far. Therefore, the 
BGD is smelling betrayal of the people and hostile lobbyists at 
the levers of power in our country. The basic program whines 
about the destruction of the "cultural and ethnic identity of 
the German people" by "multicultural changes." In the party 
newsletter (the new title: UNSERE DEUTSCHE HEIMAT [OUR GERMAN 
HOMELAND]), BGD Chairman Horst Zaborowski throws another piece 
of wood on the fire: "Not once in our 2,000-year-old history," 
he complains, "has the simultaneous foreign rule over the German 
people in its material and intellectual substance been achieved 
as perfectly as in our days." 
  At the end of 1993, in the same newsletter, the 67-year-old 
ex-businessman added to his views. In his article "Freedom for 
Germany," he emphatically called for "getting rid of the 
restrictions that have been imposed on the German people since 
1945." In Zaborowski's view, the fact that "for the last 45 
years," German history "has been limited to the period from 1933 
to 1945 and, in the process, has been distorted" is due to the 
"biggest manipulation in human history." 
<H5>  "Sheep on the EC Pasture" </H5>
  The process leading toward the European Union (EU) is a 
thorn 
in the side of Zaborowski and his followers. Even though the 
BGD is running in this year's elections to the European 
Parliament, it categorically demands Germany's departure from 
the European Union (Zaborowski: "conceived as a prison for our 
German people"). 
  It fits into the picture when, in a memorandum to the 
members, retired priest Walter Fischer from Sangershausen smells 
a "new conspiracy against Germany": "From the inside by the 
controlled media, from the outside by constantly reminding us 
Germans of the brown [fascist] period and degrading us to humble 
sheep on the EC pasture." However, the theologian seems to like 
being reminded of his eight years in the "Hitler Youth." These 
years "gave me, who was permitted to become a soldier because of 
a cardiac defect, much of what I wish with all my heart for our 
poor, misguided rock and pop youth -- namely, love for my 
homeland, discipline, comradeliness, courage, and idealism." 
  It also fits the picture when the BGD organ UNSERE DEUTSCHE 
HEIMAT makes propaganda for maps produced by Publishing House 
for Folklore and Research Into Contemporary History [Verlag fuer 
Volkstum und Zeitgeschichtsforschung] in Vlotho. Its owner, Udo 
Walendy, is a former Bundestag candidate of the NPD [National 
Democratic Party] and already belonged to the NPD Presidium at a 
time when this right-wing extremist party had just been 
established in 1964. In his publishing company, Walendy has 
published, among others, the book The Auschwitz Lie 
by Nazi propagandist Thies Christophersen. 
<H5>  Rhyming Racial Teachings </H5>
  The BDG organ has also printed poems by Renate Schuette, who 
has repeatedly published her effusions in papers of the 
terrorist FAP [Liberal Workers Party]. In her collection of 
verse, entitled Racial Teachings, it says: "Tempting 
someone to mix races/is large-scale genocide/Many proud empires 
have died early/when they succumbed to this mania." 
[German-language original rhymes] 
  There are also links with the monthly DER SCHEINWERFER. In a 
1990 study conducted by the Protestant Students' Community in 
Bonn, the paper is accused of containing "anti-Semitic, racist, 
revisionist, and antidemocratic articles." Among the permanent 
employees of the editorial office, one finds Siegfried 
Neubacher, BGD district chairman of Upper Franken and candidate 
in the elections to the European Parliament. 
  Neubacher's Bavarian land association is headed by Mathias 
Weifert, 33 and a representative of the younger generation, who 
is studying sociology with Professor Lothar Bossle in Wuerzburg. 
Bossle, a former confidant of Franz Josef Strauss [late 
Bavarian minister-president], moves in BGD circles and is a very 
controversial man because of his dubious connections with the 
military dictatorship in Chile and the Mun Sect. However, 
Bossle is still suitable as a conservative pretense for the BGD, 
which is rolling about in brownish waters.

<F P=106> ["ptz"-signed report: "Rexrodt Admits Setback at the End of </F>
the Year"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The FRG Economics Ministry currently 
assesses the economic development with more restraint than a few 
weeks ago. "Around the end of the year," the economic 
development "did not show a unified picture; however, the basic 
economic trend seems to go generally upward," Rexrodt's ministry 
now notes. 
  The economists in Bonn are more worried about the situation 
in the west German industry. "Orders received and production 
once again declined there during the fourth quarter, following 
an upswing that was observed during the third quarter." All in 
all, the adjusted GDP, as a comprehensive expression of the 
overall economic performance, "may have declined a bit" during 
the last quarter of 1993. As a positive element, the ministry 
notes "improved" business expectations in the processing 
industry. 
  On 21 January, the ministry said: "The slow climb out of the 
deep valley of the economic development had already begun in the 
old laender last year. During the second and third quarter, the 
GDP increased slightly and probably stayed at the achieved level 
also during the last quarter of 1993."

<F P=106> ["R.O./DPA" report: "IG-Metall: Toughest Strike in 10 </F>
Years"] 
  [Text] Hannover -- The west German metal industry is 
facing a strike, the likes of which the republic has not 
experienced in at least 10 years. 
  This was announced by Klaus Zwickel, chairman of the 
IG-Metall trade union, in the event that "the employers do not 
finally give up their demand for a wage suspension and abolition 
of the vacation bonus." 
  The strike vote, scheduled for the first week of March, will 
result in at least 75 percent of IG-Metall members voting for a 
strike, Zwickel said, speaking to 3,500 members of his trade 
union at an action day of the IG-Metall district of Lower Saxony 
in Hannover. More than 1 million metal workers have proved 
their readiness for strike by staging warning strikes over the 
past two weeks. The IG-Metall chairman said the employers' plan 
to abolish the vacation bonus, along with a wage suspension, is 
"not only socially unacceptable but also economically 
irresponsible." The trade union does not want a strike, but it 
is necessary so that it can continue to represent the working 
people's interests. 
  On Saturday [19 February], the employers of the west German 
metal and electrical industry warned IG-Metall against a 
"phantom strike." "One cannot gain employment security through 
strikes," Dieter Kirchner, the main manager of the Gesamtmetall 
employers' association, told WELT AM SONNTAG. The trade union 
wants to ensure employment through shorter working hours. 
However, working hours are regulated by uncanceled wage 
contracts. "Therefore, a change in working hours cannot be 
achieved through strikes," Kirchner stressed. 
  IG-Metall can hold a legally permitted strike only for the 
canceled wage contracts on wages or the vacation bonus. These, 
however, are precisely the topics of a "small solution" that the 
employers have suggested. But IG-Metall does not want that, 
because this would not cover employment security. However, 
employment security can be achieved only through negotiations. 
Therefore, a strike would not be just an economic disaster. It 
must also "end in a disaster for IG-Metall, because it leads the 
striking people into battle for the wrong goals," Kirchner said. 
Kirchner does not believe that negotiations will still be held 
on a peaceful settlement of the wage conflict. 
  In an interview with BILD AM SONNTAG Zwickel said a strike 
could still be prevented "if the employers' association makes a 
concrete offer for negotiations worthy of discussion." 
IG-Metall must pay 41 million marks for 100,000 striking people 
per week. "If we are forced to do so, we can hold out for 
weeks." 
  Tomorrow IG-Metall leaders will decide on motions of the 14 
wage districts concerning a failure of the current negotiations 
and the holding of strike votes. A strike in the west German 
metal and electrical industry, which has 3.6 million working 
people, could begin in March. The last big strike in the west 
German metal industry took place 10 years ago for the gradual 
introduction of the 35-hour work week. 
  In his speech in Hannover, Juergen Peters, Lower Saxony's 
IG-Metall district chairman, threatened employers that the metal 
workers' patience has reached its limit. According to him, the 
wage contract is not "the nation's piggy-bank." Lower Saxony's 
Minister President Gerhard Schroeder (Social Democratic Party of 
Germany) appealed to the employers' reason: "Do not force 
IG-Metall to strike; this is something our economy does not 
need." The Social Democratic politician expressed the hope that 
a strike can still be avoided through reason.

<F P=106> [Article by J. Jufelschulte and P. Miller: "Wanted: Mole; </F>
Intrigues or High Treason? Nerves Are Raw in the Federal 
Intelligence Service"] 
  [Text] The employees of the secret service suspected clever 
intrigue, even treason. They needed the evidence to back it up, 
though. 
  Otherwise quite successful at spying and information 
gathering, top officials in the Federal Intelligence Service 
(BND) were at a loss for a clear answer. Minister of State Bernd 
Schmidbauer wanted a concrete answer last Tuesday [25 January] 
in the Federal Chancellery; just who is running all over the 
BND? Just who is the troublemaker? 
  In Pullach near Munich, headquarters of the spy agency, with 
approximately 7,000 employees deployed domestically and abroad, 
morale is currently at a low point. "Our nerves," one BND 
insider revealed to FOCUS, "are completely raw." 
  Worst case ever of double agent activity among Germany's 
most 
silent officials: 
  An official from the administrative level, so goes the 
gossip 
among Pullach subordinates, is supposed to have removed secret 
materials from the office over a period of years. The 
materials--without his knowledge--traveled over hazardous 
routes, eventually ending up in the GDR Ministry for State 
Security. A "super GAU" [district] for the BND. 
  The top official was defended immediately. 
  "We have no prior knowledge of this," emphasized Secret 
Service Coordinator Schmidbauer. Joachim Lampe, attorney for the 
Federal Supreme Court in Karlsruhe, who was informed immediately 
of the charges, also made a placating statement: "At this time 
we have no case against this man." 
  Nevertheless, the Office of the Federal Attorney is 
currently 
conducting an investigation in a case of espionage that would 
not have been conceivable without direct BND participation. 
  And just as certain: The unknown remover of highly 
confidential analyses and papers has not yet been exposed. The 
BND is searching for its mole. 
  One of those implicated in this espionage affair today sits 
embittered in his house in Munich and has, at the age of 81, 
only one last wish: "I want to spit in the face of this 
blackguard from the Stasi." 
  Dr. Gerhard B., once editor in chief for the West German 
technical journal SOLDAT IM VOLK, still finds it hard to grasp 
just how badly the floppy-hat members of GDR State Security 
crucified him. 
  The Background. Dr. B., who always had access to 
internal circles of the Bundeswehr and the West German Secret 
Services, was recruited under a "foreign flag" during the 
fifties. In other words: At that time he began meeting with men 
who--although they were Germans--claimed to be working for the 
French intelligence service. 
  Dr. B. experienced no pangs of conscience. The Frenchmen, he 
truly believed, were surely loyal allies in the effort to create 
a strong Europe. 
  The alleged agents of the French secret service were in 
reality "patrons" of the Leipzig Stasi-district government, who 
were passing the information they received immediately to the 
espionage headquarters on Normanen Street in East Berlin. 
  Federal Supreme Court Attorney Lampe is currently examining 
whether B. actually was unaware of the true identity of his 
handlers, and whether he unknowingly got mixed up with Mielke's 
men. 
  The journalist Dr. Gerhard B., known by the Stasi under the 
cover name "Schwarz," was apparently a top source. Until 1988, 
over a period of 30 years, he is suspected of having reported 
willingly on military policy conferences and training courses 
held at Bundeswehr training facilities. The people from Leipzig, 
among them agents whose cover names were Tratmann and Veit, also 
learned as much as they could about the Bavarian Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution and the CSU [Christian Social 
Union]. 
  The Leipzig former Stasi Colonel B., according to the legend 
"resident of the French office for the German-speaking area," 
was able to get ahead using the achievements of his inofficial 
employee from Munich. "Schwarz" is also supposed to have 
supplied them with informational reports, situation reports, and 
security analyses over the years, which originated from BND 
headquarters. A jackpot for the Stasi. 
  It remains unclear today exactly how this secret procurement 
in Pullach could have occurred. Federal Supreme Court Attorney 
Lampe is currently not investigating this point, however he sees 
a legitimate interest in the "clarification of this issue." 
  Dr. Gerhard B., interviewed by FOCUS, admitted that he quite 
often received "several items" from his "good old friend" Dr. 
Kurt W., a former BND director. The Stasi knew this and even 
gave the "good friend" Dr. Kurt W. a cover name--"Berater" 
[adviser]. 
  "Berater" was once a sparkling figure in the West 
German Secret Service. The former head of Department 1, chief of 
all BND agents around the world, is supposed to have taken part 
in the creation of a secret service within the Secret Service, 
out of frustration over the social liberal coalition in 
Bonn--the unlawful operation was conducted under the code name 
"Operation Eva." 
  Dr. Kurt W., alias "Berater," also maintained very close 
contact with the Pullach circles even after his retirement. 
Through one of his former colleagues, according to BND 
employees, Kurt W. is supposed to have gotten hold of official 
documents. With this action the top BND official would have at 
the very least committed betrayal state secrecy laws. 
  The subsequent stages in the floppy-hat sequence: 
  Kurt W. is supposed to have passed papers and other 
information on by mouth to Gerhard B. alias "Schwarz." He did 
this allegedly without suspecting that he would further pass the 
information--knowingly or unknowingly--on to the Stasi. 
  Ex-BND Director Kurt W. can today no longer be questioned on 
these events. After suffering a severe stroke he is now 
considered in no condition to be questioned. 
  With their IM [unofficial agent] "Schwarz," the Stasi, 
disguised as the French intelligence service, played a crazy 
foreign agent game to the very end. 
  On Gerhard B.'s 75th birthday, 19 September 1987, something 
unusual happened to Colonel B. from Leipzig. On the basis of his 
great services paid to France, "Schwarz" was supposed to be 
dubbed "knight of the Legion of Honor," which is comparable in 
Germany to the Federal Service Cross. 
  The solemn ceremony was held in the "blue room" of the 
elegant Schloss Hotel in Igls near Innsbruck. 
  The Stasi was already thinking ahead. Via Gerhard B. they 
attempted to approach a BND employee, to whom, as a precaution, 
the cover name "Zange" [tongs] was given. 
  At this point it remains unclear whether the recruitment was 
a success. 
  Volker Foertsch, who has been left out in the cold in the 
wrangling for a position of influence in the BND, may be looking 
into this question immediately. Foertsch, head of Department 1 
(operative training) since 1989, has been now been assigned to 
handle security and counterespionage. Department 5, within the 
BND, serves as the traditional stronghold for service intrigues. 
  Foertsch's successor after February is Dr. Rudolf Werner, 
alias Dr. Kempe, up to now BND resident in Washington. 
  Insiders are wondering whether the American friends from the 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) will give Werner, who will be 
departing his post as BND governor, a small going-away gift. As 
is generally known, the filmed data on Stasi foreign espionage, 
which up to now have been presented to German protectors of the 
Constitution only in abridged form, lie in the CIA archives 
(FOCUS 48/1993). 
  Maybe with a little luck and some good intentions these 
could 
help to expose IM Zange....

<F P=106> [Report by "D.Gd.": "A White Paper for the Soldiers of the </F>
Year 2010"] 
  [Text] Further, faster, with more professional soldiers 
and equipment, and without dropping our nuclear guard. The 
authors of the white paper on defense commissioned last May by 
Edouard Balladur have ambitious objectives for the French armed 
forces by the year 2010. 
  The document was presented yesterday by the prime minister 
and Defense Minister Francois Leotard to the deputies and 
senators of the Defense Commissions of the two houses. This is 
the first exercise of this kind since Michel Debre's white paper 
in 1972. The latter orchestrated the strategy and missions of 
the French armed forces following the acquisition of the strike 
force in the context of the Cold War. The 1994 version of the 
white paper takes a defense posture in an international context 
which has become particularly fluid since the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union. In addition there are heavy budgetary 
constraints set by Edouard Balladur in his five-year law to 
control public spending. 
  This white paper, drawn up by around 100 experts, members of 
the military, and senior civil servants, under the chairmanship 
of Marceau Long, first vice president of the State Council, will 
serve as an "explanation of the themes" of the forthcoming 
1995-2000 military programming law which should be debated in 
Parliament in June. It has received the implicit approval of 
Francois Mitterrand who approved its terms during two defense 
council meetings in January and February. 
<H5>  Uncertainty and Diversification of Threats </H5>
  The uncertainty applies to the stability of the countries of 
the former Warsaw Pact and the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. The new threats lie in the probable multiplication 
of regional conflicts, ethnic or religious extremism, terrorism, 
and drug trafficking. 
  In this context, the white paper takes up the two classical 
aims of French defense policy. First, to defend the country's 
vital interests, "alone if necessary, against any threat 
whatever its origin." This is the role of the nuclear 
deterrent. Second, to watch over France's "strategic interests" 
which "correspond to its international responsibilities and its 
rank in the world." Six crisis scenarios of varying scales (see 
below) stem from this, ranging from the potentially nuclear 
conflict to the defense of the DOM-TOM [French Overseas 
Departments and Territories]. 
  Most of these commitments will take place in the framework 
of 
coalitions, under the auspices of international organizations 
(United Nations, NATO, Western European Union, CSCE). The white 
paper thus defines the role which France intends to play in 
these organizations. It reflects the recent rapprochement with 
NATO, while formally rejecting a return to the organization's 
integrated military structures which France left in 1966. 
<H5>  Nuclear Doctrine Unchanged </H5>
  French strategy, it reaffirms, "is a strategy of deterrence, 
rejecting any confusion between deterrence and use." The white 
paper thus takes up the 1972 definition conferring on the 
nuclear deterrent the virtue of "rendering recourse to all-out 
war unacceptable as an active political method." Added to this, 
and included in French doctrine for years, is the "final 
warning," characterized by a limited strike against military 
targets. 
  The text says remarkably little about the question of 
nuclear 
tests, which Francois Mitterrand decided to halt in 1992 -- a 
halt now opposed by the government. No mention is made of the 
international moratorium on tests. The authors of the report 
view "favorably the drafting of a treaty for a total ban on 
tests," provided it does not "hamper the maintenance of our 
deterrent's credibility." Similarly, although the white paper 
stresses the need to safeguard "the capability for technological 
development" of the military use of nuclear power by 
strengthening "the test simulation program," it refrains from 
choosing the component (naval, airborne, or land-based) 
responsible for delivering the "final warning." 
<H5>  More Autonomous Conventional Forces </H5>
  The same vagueness surrounds the numbers of men in the 
conventional forces which, according to the details provided in 
the crisis scenarios, should remain stable after the reductions 
started in recent years. Indeed, it is their capability for 
intervening in overseas crises which will be strengthened. The 
recent crises (Iraq, Somalia, Cambodia, the former Yugoslavia) 
have shown how very difficult it is for the French armed forces 
to simultaneously deploy sizeable forces on several theaters of 
operations. 
  "There must gradually be a real conversion in the role of 
conventional means. It is henceforth their use outside a 
nuclear context which predominates," and hence "their aptitude 
for the prevention, limitation, or settlement by force of 
regional crises or conflicts which do not present the risk of 
escalation to the extremes," the white paper notes. 
  The philosophy being to "prevent" the eruption and 
development of these crises, the white paper thinks it is 
necessary for the French armed forces "to simultaneously conduct 
several actions: A very intense regional conflict in the 
framework of a coalition; one or several interventions to help 
an overseas departement or territory or to implement defense 
agreements; a limited peacekeeping or international law 
enforcement operation." This presupposes the strengthening of 
the complementarity of forces within the armed forces. The aim 
is to have a "reservoir of rapidly mobile forces of 120,000 to 
130,000 men" in the army. 
<H5>  No Professional Army </H5>
  Although it is in favor of a greater professionalization of 
the armed forces, the white paper rejects the move to a 
professional army, regarded as "unrealistic" especially because 
of "excessive budget costs." National service, "the best 
guarantee of the importance which the nation and the citizens 
attach to their defense," should be both "condensed" in its 
military aspect, whose 10-month duration is not questioned, and 
diversified in its civilian forms. 
<H5>  Budgetary Constraints </H5>
  The armaments sector, which currently represents 300,000 
jobs 
of which 100,000 are indirect, will have to be "radically 
restructured" for mainly financial reasons: "It will no longer 
be possible for it to be present in every niche" as was the case 
until 1985. Outside the nuclear sphere, France is called upon 
to develop European cooperation, but also to resort to buying 
armaments abroad. Similarly, it is explicitly stated that the 
state "will no longer be able to support its arms industry in 
all spheres, as it has in the past." The restructuring of the 
arms industries started a few years ago will be continued by 
"opening up the capital of some public enterprises" and 
"improvements in productivity." 
  It is by this tightening up and by European cooperation that 
the authors think that the cost of arms spending can be reduced 
(around Fr100 billion per year excluding export revenues). In 
the present context, the document admits, the challenge of 
"maintaining the defense effort" presupposes "3 percent annual 
growth in volume to fund all the current programs." The white 
paper therefore envisages "arbitration concerning all the 
current programs" to avoid jeopardizing the new programs deemed 
to have "priority." Some of the existing major programs will 
either have to be abandoned or scaled down. 
<H5>  The Six Crisis Scenarios </H5>
  No country is named, but everybody is free to identify them 
on the basis of the recent crises or crises which are 
foreseeable in the next 15 years. The six crisis scenarios 
foreseen by the white paper are designated S1 to S6 and place a 
major nuclear conflict last. 
  S1 -- Regional conflict not endangering our vital interests: 
  This is the Iraqi case, envisaged in the Middle East, but 
also in Europe and the Mediterranean and its "degree of 
probability is high in the short and medium term." Bringing 
into conflict countries with modern conventional weapons, it 
involves "high intensity engagements." In this case, France 
would intervene in the framework of an international mandate 
with a coalition. 
  S2 -- Regional conflict which could threaten our vital 
interests: 
  Regarded as "plausible at the turn of the century" in 
Europe, 
the Mediterranean, the Near or Middle East, it involves a 
nuclear power and "by a knock-on effect" is likely to threaten 
our vital interests. Action in an international framework could 
be of a deterrent nature if necessary. 
  S3 -- Attack on the integrity of national territory outside 
the mainland: 
  This scenario, the likelihood of which is "low at present" 
but could "increase with time," concerns the DOM-TOM. France 
"must be able to control and settle this kind of conflict in 
complete independence and disregarding possible international 
pressures." 
  S4 -- Implementation of defense agreements: 
  These are French interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. Very 
high probability. 
  S5 -- Peacekeeping and international law enforcement 
operations: 
  These are foreseeable on all continents and result in very 
high probabilities of French participation in a multinational 
framework. The white paper advocates fixing the duration and 
scale of the resources committed by France from the start. 
  S6 -- Resurgence of a threat to West Europe: 
  This is the nuclear threat stemming "from a state or 
coalition of states with large nuclear and conventional forces." 
"Very difficult to imagine and unlikely in the period 
considered," this risk "cannot be ruled out because it is a 
lethal danger." The deterrent must play its role. In view of 
the fact that the reemergence of this threat should "take long 
enough," it should be possible to carry out "a gradual 
adaptation and a change of format in the defense tool." This 
clearly means reconstituting the forces formerly directed toward 
the Warsaw Pact.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 24 (AFP) -- Defence Minister Francois 
Leotard said on Thursday [24 February] that France would likely 
resume nuclear testing in the Pacific after the presidential 
elections of May, 1995. 
  Speaking on French state radio, Leotard said he personally 
backed resumption of tests "at the right time," either in 1995, 
1996 or 1997. 
  Leotard said that the question of resuming tests would arise 
only after the presidentials because President Francois 
Mitterrand, who has exclusive powers to order tests, wanted to 
stand by a moratorium observed by all the United Nations 
Security Council members, except China. 
  The defence minister said France's nuclear deterrent would 
be 
"perfectly effective until the year 2010" and would not be hurt 
by the lack of testing. 
  On Wednesday, speaking after publication of a government 
white paper on defence policy for the next 20 years, Leotard 
said tests were necessary both to modernise nuclear weapons and 
to develop a capacity to simulate tests in the laboratory. The 
aim of simulation is to obviate the need for field tests 
altogether.

"French Frigate in Cape Town -- France and South Africa Resume 
Military Relations"] 
  [Text] For the first time since 1976, and two weeks after a 
similar visit by the Royal Navy, a French military ship has gone 
to South Africa as part of an official visit. The Germinal 
surveillance frigate, under the command of Captain Patrick 
Giaume, is staying in Cape Town from 14 to 21 February. Several 
meetings with South African Navy officials as well as a 
demonstration of the ship's capabilities are scheduled to take 
place during the visit, which bears witness to closer military 
relations between the two countries. 
  France has just reopened its Military Attache Office in 
Pretoria, which had been "frozen" for several years as a result 
of sanctions. The arrival of the Germinal coincides with the 
visit in South Africa of a parliamentary delegation headed by 
Yvon Bourges, a former defense minister and the vice president 
of the Senate's Foreign Affairs and Defense Commission. The 
delegation met with South African Defense Minister Kobie Coetsee 
as well as several military officials. 
  The Germinal -- the latest in a series of six frigates -- is 
armed with a 100-mm automatic cannon and sea-to-sea Exocet 
missiles. It carries a Dauphin helicopter and was designed for 
extended missions, including general-purpose sea surveillance, 
evacuation of nationals, and interventions. These are the 
features which motivated the ship's presence in Southern Africa 
in the first place. South Africa -- whose whole naval strategy 
used to be geared toward defending the Cape Town route in case 
of an East-West conflict -- must now redefine its objectives and 
equipment requirements. According to Vice-Admiral Bernard 
Moysan, the president of the Sea Trials Commission, who came to 
Cape Town on board of the Germinal, the frigate is perfectly 
suited to the country's new naval needs.

<F P=106> [Report by Anne Fulda: "Francois Mitterrand -- An Act of </F>
European Faith"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt -- Between two select committee meetings 
on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, the president of the 
Republic flew to Frankfurt for one of those historical-cultural 
escapades he so likes. At about the same time that European 
foreign ministers and their Bosnian and Serb counterparts were 
meeting in Bonn, the head of state was participating in 
Frankfurt's 1,200th anniversary celebrations. 
  Arriving in the snow and in miserable weather in this town 
described by Mayor Andreas Von Schoeler as the "cradle of German 
democracy," Francois Mitterrand yesterday morning attended the 
festivities accompanied by German President Richard Von 
Weizsaecker. The word "festivities" is perhaps a little strong, 
since the chosen musical program and the speeches of the various 
speakers in the town's Alte Oper [opera house], richly decorated 
with red and white flowers, did not really convey a spirit of 
conviviality. 
<H5>  "Europe Is Our Common Heritage" </H5>
  Finally, at the end of this dreary ceremony it was the 
French 
head of state, "crowned" citizen of honor of the town in 1986, 
who received the most applause. It has to be said that the 
president of the republic, who recalled that his first visit to 
Germany as head of state was to Frankfurt -- "I had come before 
but it was not a real visit" -- flattered his audience by 
saying how pleased he was that this town had been chosen as the 
seat of the European Monetary Institute. 
  "The European Monetary Institute has just been set up in 
Frankfurt. The stakes for both our countries is the creation of 
a strong and stable currency. On that point, you know your 
business," Francois Mitterrand said. The choice of Frankfurt, 
he continued, "bears the future, the symbol of German monetary 
power, and, why not, of European monetary power. Therefore, let 
us not hide the fact that Germany, to which we have attributed 
the headquarters of the European Bank, has a special 
responsibility in ensuring the success of this undertaking." 
  The president of the Republic also reminded his audience 
that 
Frankfurt had always been "a crossroads for the European idea," 
since it was here, in this region that used to be called eastern 
Franconia, that Charlemagne convened the first imperial synod in 
794. Finally, after mentioning Goethe, Nietzche, and Francois I 
-- "Francois, France, Franconia, Frankfurt -- I find it all very 
confusing" -- the head of state declared, more European than 
ever: "Long live Frankfurt, long live Franco-German friendship, 
long live Europe, our shared heritage!"

<F P=106> [Report by Gilles Bresson: "Over Lunch, Chirac Gets Out His </F>
Knife"] 
  [Excerpt] It just took a little drop in Edouard Balladur's 
popularity to give some bite back to Jacques Chirac. The RPR 
[Rally for the Republic] president, who used to be rather 
reserved during the Tuesday [22 February] majority luncheons at 
the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office], unreservedly 
criticized Edouard Balladur's policy yesterday while enjoying 
the cassoulet which was served. 
  According to a participant, the RPR president was "very 
aggressive." He first criticized the prime minister, and more 
especially [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard for not resuming 
the nuclear tests. He explained to his interlocutors that in 
their position he would have done so and that, technically 
speaking, it was possible. He then wondered how Francois 
Leotard could still have the courage to face public opinion 
after lacking courage before the president of the republic. 
  Jacques Chirac, in brilliant form, did not stop there. 
Taking the tone of "when will there be a decision on....," he 
then demanded a reform of the electoral system for regional 
elections. And he demanded a postponement of the municipal 
elections until after the presidential election. On this last 
point, Edouard Balladur gave him satisfaction. And Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing acquiesced. 
  After these three fierce attacks, the mayor of Paris 
attacked 
Charles Pasqua. The interior minister is not in favor of the 
RPR president's wishes with regard to the regional elections. 
He thinks that there is no panic and he is extremely reticent 
about regional constituencies. According to him, it would 
amount to placing the other local communities under supervision 
and would be a first step toward a Europe of regions. Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing simply spoke of nothing but Bosnia. 
  The atmosphere at the luncheon, one leading member of the 
majority said, "was strangely reminiscent of the `Gunslingers.' 
The atmosphere was very heavy. They are now all firing on 
Balladur. He is their target." The prime minister looked very 
pale, seemed "completely cornered," and said virtually nothing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michel Rocard, Socialist Party secretary </F>
general, by Paul Guilbert and Joseph Mace-Scaron; place and date 
not given: "Rocard: `The Only Recovery We See Is the Right 
Recovering the Positions of Power'"] 
  [Text] After the Conference on Social Transformation and 
the electoral "shudder" at the recent cantonal elections, the 
leader of the PS [Socialist Party] passes judgment on the action 
of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. In an interview with LE 
FIGARO, the Mayor of Conflans shows that the Socialists have had 
no problems in adjusting from a government to an opposition 
frame of mind. 
  [LE FIGARO] Edouard Balladur stressed, in his appearance on 
"L'Heure de Verite" ["Hour of Truth" TV show] that no other 
policy was possible. Do you share that opinion? 
  [Rocard] There is an implicit hypothesis behind that 
statement: Namely, that general economic policy is limited to a 
monetarist policy. This is a postulate that I refute 
categorically. 
  [LE FIGARO] How can you run a policy to fight unemployment 
when you can only act "on the fringes"? 
  [Rocard] I would firstly say that the phenomenon of 
unemployment in France is currently taking on a new aspect. The 
number of long-term unemployed has passed the million mark while 
the rate of youth unemployment has reached a worrying level. 
When you consider that drugs and criminality are highly 
dependent on unemployment, how can we accept this linear growth 
without changing anything? The most serious threat hanging over 
us today is not bankruptcy but social disintegration. First, 
the room for action does exist, even if it is minimal, and it 
can be increased. Second, there are other things to take into 
consideration, aside from the room for maneuver. We can also 
work at the heart of the problems, for example, by considering 
the idea of a rapid New Deal to find the path to strong growth 
on the European level. 
  [LE FIGARO] Is that not a new utopia? 
  [Rocard] On the contrary, it is very realistic. Technically, 
Europe has a great potential for growth. The crisis has 
weakened all local and regional authorities, it is true, and 
countries. The European Union has escaped this torment. It is 
not in debt and has the best profile in the world, since it is 
underwritten by 340 million economically-powerful consumers. 
Politically, my friends in social democratic parties, several 
of whom are already in power and others on the verge of 
government, increasingly share the idea of an enormous European 
loan to finance the major projects which will lay the road to 
the future, create immediate employment, and stimulate activity. 
  [LE FIGARO] Outside of Europe, then, there is no salvation? 
  [Rocard] On the contrary. In France itself many things are 
possible. For example, the creation of jobs in the services 
sector. 
  Vast numbers of essential needs can be covered: nursery 
education, treatment for the elderly and handicapped, 
environmental tasks, cultural activities, etc. To create and 
finance these jobs, we need a philosophy close to that of the 
employment-solidarity contracts (CES) that I created, which 
implies the true, active involvement of all bodies whose sole 
action today consists in paying out benefits. It will also 
require the state's determination to grant certain exemptions. 
There are a number of paths we can go down, but you can always 
say that there is no other policy possible when you do not 
invent anything. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you not think that the five-year employment 
law is nonetheless the beginning of a process for the reduction 
of working time? 
  [Rocard] On the contrary. Mr. Jean-Yves Charnard, who 
poisoned the debate by caricaturing it, and Mr. Balladur, who 
opposed it haughtily, have between them slowed the process. 
While service jobs represent a considerable source of 
employment, the reduction in working time would be another major 
contribution. 
  Mr. Balladur says it is unimaginable for France to go it 
alone in the world: I challenge this erroneous reasoning in its 
entirety. Firstly, because Germany, the Netherlands, and the 
Scandinavian countries have a slightly shorter working week. 
Also, because nobody has suggested an authoritarian, blind, and 
brutal reduction. Put more simply, everyone knows that if we are 
to recapture growth we need to work more. What we need is more 
work to be done by more people. 
  Problems of adjustment are very complex, but the state must 
assist by supplying the required finance. Moreover, it must 
stimulate activity in two ways: Through the general law which 
can provide a framework for future negotiations per sector, and 
through its policy toward its own salaried workers -- there is 
nothing to stop it from negotiating within administrations and 
state-owned companies. 
  There are many other possibilities that depend just on us. 
The Swedes did not wait for other countries before it created 
progressive retirement, i.e., the possibility for an employee to 
move from full-time to two-thirds time to one-third time. He 
keeps one-third or two-thirds of his salary and receives 
one-third or two-thirds of his pension, and that gives better 
results. 
  Another method is applying a surplus tax to overtime in 
order 
to gradually start social negotiations for its suppression and 
replacement by compensatory leave. Then there is the issue of 
voluntary part-time work. Since this formula provides 
flexibility, is must be negotiated between the company and the 
employee. The five-year law does the opposite: It enables the 
selected work time to be imposed...by the employer! 
  Once again, there are many paths we can take. I admit that I 
do not understand how a government which has such a comfortable 
majority can simply opt to do nothing. 
  [LE FIGARO] Are your criticisms of Edouard Balladur aimed 
more at what he is doing or his method? 
  [Rocard] They are leveled at what he is doing. What is his 
method? All heads of government negotiate to a greater or 
lesser extent. For him it is to a lesser extent. 
  [LE FIGARO] The other side to the prime minister's argument 
is the desire not to be too hard on an already fragile society. 
Basically, we are not far from the reform by consensus that you 
wanted to implement when you were prime minister... 
  [Rocard] Yes we are. When a consensus is possible, that is 
fine, it means that the reforms take deeper root. When it is 
not, decisions have to be made. Remember the general social 
contribution (CSG) and urban solidarity, and all those other 
decisions! I had no comfortable majority. 
  I should add that the most important reforms are not always 
applied through legislation. I am in particular thinking of the 
renewal of public service, which I still think is a fundamental 
reform. Reform is more difficult when you have no absolute 
majority, but Mr. Balladur has 480 deputies behind him, a large 
majority in the senate, his friends control 20 of the 22 
metropolitan regions, three-quarters of the departments, and 
one-half of all urban districts. So what is he waiting for to 
reform? We had none of these advantages. 
  In periods of improving growth, as between 1988 and 1990, it 
is harder to reform because people cannot see the need as much: 
There is growth, some money, all you need to do is take people 
on. In difficult times, it is true, there is the temptation to 
turn inwards, but people are much more willing to listen. 
However, not once during the "Heure de la Verite" program did 
Edouard Balladur give the impression that he had the slightest 
idea of what France should be like in five or six years' time, 
not once! How can you expect people to make an effort 
themselves consisting of accepting reforms when you do not tell 
them why? 
  I cannot accept the parallel between patience and 
immobility. 
Mr. Balladur either makes hasty decisions -- such as on pensions 
and the increase in the CSG -- or no decisions at all, with the 
promise of better days being constantly postponed. 
  [LE FIGARO] Can we not already see the first signs of a 
recovery? 
  [Rocard] The only recovery we can see is a renewed recovery 
by the right of the positions of power! Mr. Raymond Barre (UDF 
[Union for French Democracy]) was right when he spoke of the 
"partial state in disguise." Of course, all governments operate 
a policy of appointment -- I did. There are quantitative 
problems of speed and numbers; there are qualitative problems 
concerning men and women; and there are problems of the 
political balance of the new appointments. Everywhere, Mr. 
Balladur is methodically weaving his web. 
  France is not made to be governed by some 30 or so men who, 
assured of political power, today control the whole banking 
sector, most of insurance and industry, and almost all the 
audiovisual sector. The latter area is the most obvious but is 
far from being the only one. However, when, on top of that, Mr. 
Balladur blandly claims he only heard about the Canal Plus 
affair in the press, I would say, to remain polite, that he is 
rather overestimating the French people's gullibility... 
  [LE FIGARO] Is not a prime minister who is candidate to the 
presidency of the Republic necessarily inclined to err on the 
side of caution? 
  [Rocard] I would say that the fact of finding yourself as 
candidate to the presidency just a few months from the elections 
should encourage you to implement reforms and launch yourself 
into the future. 
  [LE FIGARO] In your opinion, then, the fact of being 
candidate to the presidency of the Republic is more of a spur. 
  [Rocard] Yes, a spur to nurture results and, quite simply, 
to 
do what you have to do, what serves the present and prepares for 
the future. 
  [LE FIGARO] You recently said that it is not the prime 
minister who determines policy directions... 
  [Rocard] This is a formula that respects the attributions of 
the president and it appears to me to be profoundly true except, 
of course, during a period of cohabitation. As Edouard Balladur 
reminded us, it is then the head of government's job to 
determine the new policy's direction. 
  [LE FIGARO] Does the current majority risk, during its term 
of office, encountering the same difficulties the Left 
encountered? 
  [Rocard] Of course, but it always claimed that these 
difficulties were specific to the Left. It has been proved that 
this is not the case. Everything else comes on top of the basic 
concern generated by unemployment. Since the right has only 
made a political analysis of our electoral defeat, it did not 
consider it necessary to reply to this concern. 
  [LE FIGARO] It appears that, at the beginning, you had some 
problem accepting the "Balladur phenomenon?" 
  [Rocard] It is more in my nature to act than to demolish. I 
readily accept that I found it hard to apprehend what you call 
the "Balladur phenomenon." Since I do not like personal attacks 
and I do not like systematic criticism, I was caught in an 
awkward situation. However, Mr. Edouard Balladur determined the 
issue himself. It began with the announcement on the same day 
of 17,000 public company layoffs. The prime minister -- already 
-- said he had not been informed! Then there was Air France, 
then the Iranians wrested from the Swiss justice authorities, 
then the Falloux law, then the fishing disputes, it all started 
then... 
  [LE FIGARO] What, in your opinion, has been the prime 
minister's biggest mistake? 
  [Rocard] It is not a mistake, but a constant feature... 
perhaps of his character. The man who refused to meet with the 
fishermen is the same man who, in 1986, abolished the wealth tax. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you feel you have time to rebuild the Left 
and 
prepare its candidate for the presidential election? 
  [Rocard] Yes. At the time when it took 23 years for a 
president to be replaced, you needed 10 years to prepare for the 
presidential elections. Now we know it can be done in just 23 
months, so draw your own conclusions. 
  [LE FIGARO] To gather the whole of the Left you need to 
adopt 
a policy of breaking away. Will you choose to break away from 
the past history of the Left or break away from the present of 
the Right? 
  [Rocard] Break away, indeed! I think, on the contrary, that 
we must build on an assumed past to offer a vision of the 
future. Our party conference established our relations with the 
past, successes and failures, and without any complacency. I am 
one of the rare political leaders to have published a 
self-critical review. We need add nothing more. Now, the "PS 
house" is in reasonable order, our meetings go well, the active 
party members no longer always react according to events but in 
the aim of party progress. 
  Similarly, we still have four major meetings planned to 
follow up on the Conference for Social Transformation. This is 
the first time since the beginning of the century that the whole 
of the Left is working together and that all sides agreed to 
have an open debate. It is with that and on that basis that we 
are going to build the project for society that we want to offer 
the French people. 
  [LE FIGARO] Thus, you favor progress based on thematic 
affinities rather than renewing alliances? 
  [Rocard] Yes. Nothing is more solid than shared convictions. 
The idea of agreements between party leaderships is an archaic 
one. Today's electorate is more changing, rather concerned, and 
very widely spread. Its capacity for gathering around a cause 
cannot be negotiated among the main political leaders. No one 
has a right to society's votes. That being said, aggression is 
not the right way to prepare for a second round of voting, 
either, as we saw in March 1993. 
  The word "alliance" does not adequately describe the process 
that can occur. As for having an innovative imagination, I 
think we will be good enough. However, the main thrust of our 
future action consists less of looking for necessarily new ideas 
than applying ideas that already exist. An idea remains new for 
as long as it is not put into practice. It is true of the 
European New Deal, and it is true of the four-day working week. 
Having said that, that does not exclude us from coming up with 
new suggestions. 
  [LE FIGARO] Who do you fear more in the second round of the 
presidential elections, Edouard Balladur or Jacques Chirac? 
  [Rocard] I really do not care, since the problem lies 
elsewhere. Either we are not capable of a political rebirth and 
anyone can beat us, or we are capable and we can beat anyone.

<F P=106> [Report signed "S.R.": "Historic Trade Surplus in 1993"] </F>
  [Text] The French trade balance broke all records last 
year, showing a surplus of 87.26 billion francs [Fr], according 
to the initial figures published yesterday by the Customs 
Department. 
  This historic surplus is an encumbrance! In fact, it was 
obtained as a result of an equally unprecedented recession, with 
the low level of demand by households and the fall in 
investments by enterprises bringing imports down by more than 10 
percent. 
  On paper at least, the year is ending well, thanks to the 
sale of several Airbus planes. The trade balance showed a 
record monthly surplus in December of Fr13.2 billion, after the 
Fr6.5 billion in November. Exports, in figures adjusted to take 
account of seasonal variations, reached Fr103 billion, of which 
Fr5.3 billion came from the invoicing of 14 Airbus planes. 
Exports totaled Fr99 billion in November. Imports totaled Fr89 
billion in December, as against Fr92 billion the previous month. 
  Last year's record is almost a trebling of the 1992 surplus 
which was Fr30.9 billion. It also by far exceeds the 
government's budget forecasts which were based on Fr39 billion. 
  However, the introduction of a new system of customs 
statistics for intra-Community trade on 1 January 1993 prompts 
caution. Since the establishment of the single market, the 
figures for trade with the rest of the European Union have been 
calculated on the basis of voluntary statements by enterprises. 
This is an innovation which has led to a lack of reliability in 
the figures for at least the whole first half of the year and 
forced the Customs Department to make major revisions from one 
month to another. 
<H5>  Positive Balance with Germany </H5>
  Essentially, the government yesterday took care not to 
rejoice too much about the unprecedented trade surplus. 
According to the accumulated figures obtained from the Customs 
Department, 1993's historic surplus can be explained mainly by 
the fall in imports as a result of the economic recession, which 
weakened the demand from French enterprises and households. For 
instance, the accumulated total of imports in gross figures, the 
most significant in this case, amounted to Fr1,091 billion, in 
other words a drop of 10.4 percent compared with the previous 
year. 
  Exports also fell, to Fr1,181 billion. But the drop of 5.4 
percent was half that of imports, hence the record surplus. 
  On the basis of geographical area, foreign trade doubled its 
surplus with its European Union partners: It reached Fr32.7 
billion (gross figures) as against Fr16.6 billion. This 
performance can mainly be explained by the marked improvement in 
trade relations with Germany. Indeed, last year France recorded 
a surplus of Fr2.1 billion with its main trade partner, as 
against a deficit of Fr1.4 billion in 1992. On the other hand, 
Japan continues to account for France's biggest bilateral 
deficit (a deficit of Fr23 billion).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Superphenix To Be Reactivated for </F>
Research Purposes"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the government decided to reactivate the 
Superphenix fast breeder reactor, which "will no longer be 
operated as a nuclear power station, but will become a reactor 
reserved for research and demonstration purposes." 
  "The reactor will develop as rapidly as possible toward 
subgeneration [sous-generation] so as to limit the quantities of 
plutonium produced," added the press release issued by the 
offices of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, which also set forth 
several conditions relating to security. 
  The Superphenix, which will now become "a research 
prototype" 
and no longer function as "an industrial power station," will be 
reactivated after the successful completion of the work aimed at 
combating the fires caused by sodium leaks, after a phased 
start-up procedure, and on condition that the production of 
electricity is no longer a prime objective. 
  Moreover, the offices of the prime minister stressed that by 
virtue of its being a prototype, the functioning of the 
Superphenix could be suspended. In an effort to explain this 
decision to reactivate the Superphenix, they stress its 
importance for research into long-life radioactive waste 
reduction. In its press release, the government also stressed 
that the reactor would be integrated "into efforts to master 
nuclear technologies," with the "two main objectives being 
research on the utilization of plutonium (...) and the reduction 
of long-life radioactive waste produced by reprocessing fuel 
from nuclear reactors."

<F P=106> [Interview with Greek Public Order Minister Stilianos </F>
Papathemelis by Maria Gilda Lyghounis; place and date not given: 
"Embittered Macedonia"--first two paragraphs are L'EUROPEO 
introduction] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] One of the Greek politicians 
most inflexible on the Macedonian question is Stilianos 
Papathemelis, public order minister in Andreas Papandreou's new 
Socialist government. It is no coincidence that he was born in 
Salonika, the capital of Greek Macedonia, and was minister for 
Northern Greece in the eighties. EUROPEO asked him his opinion 
of Italy's recent initiative for the recognition of Macedonia. 
  "It is a serious mistake. A move that cannot be considered 
an expression of the solidarity that should exist between two 
member states of the European Union. And I do not think that it 
favors your country's real interests." 
  [Lyghounis] Are you referring to another boycott of our 
spaghetti, as happened before, three years ago? 
  [Papathemelis] The Greek Government does not encourage such 
initiatives. But we cannot prevent the people's reactions from 
influencing trends in consumption. 
  [Lyghounis] What is your grievance with Italy? 
  [Papathemelis] Its failure to understand that the key to 
everything lies in the name, "Macedonia." The population of 
Skopje are Slavic and have every right to give themselves a name 
that relates to their own history. But they cannot appropriate 
a name that has belonged to the Greek region of Salonika for 
thousands of years. Especially since the place name, Macedonia, 
was adopted by Stalin and Tito for the Skopje region with the 
clear intention of destabilizing Greece! As a politician, I 
think that vital interests of the Greek people are in jeopardy. 
  [Lyghounis] And as a Macedonian? 
  [Papathemelis] I feel insulted. This, because Skopje's 
official ideology is irredentist: They are supposedly the "free 
Macedonians" who have territory and enslaved brothers in Greece. 
That must be liberated as soon as possible. How can we accept 
this? And how can Italy recognize a government that has such an 
ideology?

<F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa, of the </F>
Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, by Giovanni Valentini; place 
and date not given: "`I Challenge Miracle Man to Unarmed 
Combat'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Valentini] Mr. 
Spaventa, why did you eventually agree to challenge [Forza 
Italia leader] Berlusconi? Are you not afraid of pitting 
yourself against him? 
  [Spaventa] I did not accept. I did more than that: I 
suggested it. I am not afraid. I am a teacher by profession, 
and I am not investing everything in this contest. I can always 
return to university and earn no less than I would as a deputy, 
and certainly more than as a minister. My motivation is not to 
win a seat in the lower house. 
  [Valentini] So what did prompt you to run as a candidate? 
  [Spaventa] Let us say moral irritation. 
  [Valentini] What does that mean? 
  [Spaventa] I was prompted by two factors. The first is that 
I have spent many years of my life condemning the intrusion of 
politics into industry, its contamination of business, and 
attacks on the production system. These ties are harmful to 
everyone. And now a representative of the economic world is 
entering politics, in an improper manner. You cannot become 
your own monitor. 
  [Valentini] What is the second reason? 
  [Spaventa] I do not think that at present it is permissible 
to deceive the Italian people with promises or announcements of 
miracles. Our past two governments have taken a difficult and 
exhausting path of reform. It is dangerous to think that anyone 
can guarantee at a stroke the recovery of employment, growth, a 
new economic miracle, and a reduction in taxes. 
  [Valentini] Pardon me, Minister, but your constituency is 
made up of wealthy Rome storekeepers: How do you think voters 
will respond to a program of austerity and stringency? 
  [Spaventa] We shall see whether there is an aware and 
responsible bourgeoisie. The choice is between believing in 
miracles or seeing things rationally. The people are free to 
choose: They will decide whether to place their trust in someone 
who is intimately acquainted with the city's problems or whether 
to assign the role of savior to someone coming from outside who 
does not know much about them. 
  [Valentini] Which sectors will you be addressing in 
particular in your quest for votes? 
  [Spaventa] Everyone. Absolutely everyone, without giving 
priority to any one source of votes. I want to understand and 
to reason with other people. Ours is a very diverse 
constituency, which includes some underprivileged areas. It 
could therefore constitute a representative sample of the entire 
city. 
  [Valentini] Will you occupy an awkward third position 
between 
Berlusconi and Michelini [Pact for Italy]? 
  [Spaventa] If the term "awkward" refers to my own personal 
situation, it is appropriate. I certainly do not have much 
experience, and I lack resources. The barefoot infantrymen must 
face armored divisions. I am fighting with my bare hands. 
  [Valentini] The law sets a ceiling of 92 million lire for 
each candidate: How much do you expect to spend? And where 
will you get the money? 
  [Spaventa] No, I could never spend as much as 92 million. I 
will draw on my meager savings. I have yet to see how. An 
electoral apparatus costs money, and I have no television 
networks. But the law also forbids explicitly costly forms of 
propaganda. It will not be an easy venture. 
  [Valentini] What do you think of the Mammi law, which 
granted 
Fininvest three television networks? 
  [Spaventa] A great number of gaps and shortcomings in this 
law have already been highlighted. The entire matter must be 
reappraised. In healthy conservative countries, such as 
Britain, no one private individual can own more than one network. 
  [Valentini] Do you consider Berlusconi the reincarnation of 
[former Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi? 
  [Spaventa] Many say so. Certainly in the past his proximity 
to Craxi did him no harm. 
  [Valentini] What is your opinion of the electoral agreement 
between Forza Italia and Fini's National Alliance? 
  [Spaventa] It is fundamentally ambiguous. It seems that the 
transitive relation, whereby the League is with Forza Italia in 
the North and Forza Italia with the National Alliance in the 
South but the League will not stand with the National Alliance, 
does not work. There are some major differences within this 
alignment, first and foremost over the federal issue. Here, 
more than in other instances, the uniting factor is merely 
electoral. 
  [Valentini] Do you think Berlusconi needed [Northern League 
leader] Bossi more, or vice versa? 
  [Spaventa] The League realized that it could lose some 
positions in the North to Berlusconi. This is no marriage for 
love, but a marriage of convenience. And perhaps each partner 
is thinking of his own interests. 
  [Valentini] Some people are already talking in terms of a 
new 
fascism, of an Italian-style Peronism. Do you consider the 
right-wing front an authoritarian movement? 
  [Spaventa] For the present, it is easier to say what it is 
not. Obviously it is not a responsible conservative right. Nor 
is there anything reminiscent of the Thatcher experience. In 
that alignment it is not easy to identify a uniting rationale 
and program, other than the slogan, "if we prevail everything 
will be fine." In other words, we lack one of the essential 
democratic elements -- a liberal-conservative right. 
  [Valentini] This being so, are you not afraid that the 
so-called "pact for freedom" could win and govern, even on its 
own? 
  [Spaventa] Until recently this prospect seemed very 
unlikely. 
Now it is much less so. Many misjudgements have been made, 
abroad too: Last month at a seminar at Harvard, everyone was 
still asking me for information about the League, not about 
Forza Italia. But I would like to quote from the FINANCIAL 
TIMES of 15 February: A victory by the left, it wrote, is the 
lesser of two evils; the greater danger comes from the League, 
the National Alliance, not to mention -- and I am translating 
literally here -- from Berlusconi's dubious credentials. 
  [Valentini] Many predict that the next parliament, lacking a 
self-sufficient majority, will be ungovernable. 
  [Spaventa] This danger does exist. Perhaps wings will be 
clipped on both sides. There could perhaps be some changes of 
heart with regard to the government. The center will be 
crucial, and in fact even it is a two-headed creature. 
  [Valentini] If that does happen, could there be a second 
Ciampi government? 
  [Spaventa] This hypothesis could be part of the postelection 
scenario. However, present conditions are very different from 
those of the first Ciampi government, which stemmed from a 
political disintegration. The new parliament may be fragmented, 
but it will be highly motivated from all sides. A political 
truce is unlikely to recur. 
  [Valentini] So will we not have a government of experts? 
  [Spaventa] I prefer to talk in terms of an institutional 
government. Be that as it may, it will have a stronger 
political role. 
  [Valentini] Could you become prime minister, Mr. Spaventa? 
  [Spaventa] Please! Let us not talk about such things. 
  [Valentini] In recent weeks you clashed with Berlusconi over 
the issue of tax cuts. Is it really impossible to alleviate the 
tax burden? 
  [Spaventa] We can and must do a great deal to reorganize 
what 
is a rickety system. In particular, taxes on industry are 
excessive and ill-conceived. Our tax system favors debt, but 
discourages risk capital. There could be a reduction of direct 
taxation, counterbalanced by an increase in indirect taxation. 
But a reduction of the tax burden is not feasible in view of 
our public debt situation. 
  [Valentini] Forza Italia argues the need for further public 
spending cuts. 
  [Spaventa] A gradual cut in expenditures is possible, and 
this has already been started by the government. But the 
results will be achieved in the medium term. Our welfare 
system, for instance, bears the burden of the fact that the 
entire West is growing older, with longer life expectancy and 
lower birth rates. Pensions reform must also safeguard the 
interests of our children when they grow old. 
  [Valentini] What about interest costs? 
  [Spaventa] The average cost of the debt is falling, with the 
cut in interest rates. As the positive response from the 
markets show, this is the only road to a proper reform. If tax 
reform were to fail, taxes would rise sharply and public 
finances would suffer as a consequence. 
  [Valentini] So what is your answer to Berlusconi's group 
when 
they propose cutting taxes and reducing expenditure by 1 percent 
a year for the next 10 years? 
  [Spaventa] I do not know whether those gentlemen have ever 
examined a state budget. I really would like to know where they 
intend to make such huge cuts. In some sectors, such as public 
investments and research, there have already been drastic 
reductions, verging on the intolerable. I am impatient to 
discover what other areas of expenditure they want to cut, and 
how. 
  [Valentini] Meanwhile, Communist Renewal leader Fausto 
Bertinotti is suggesting taxing treasury bills above a certain 
ceiling. 
  [Spaventa] That interest cannot be touched. This element of 
the state budget can be contained by credible debt management: 
The Treasury did so very successfully in 1993. The wealth tax 
or other such proposals are a recipe for the country's economic 
and political suicide. 
  [Valentini] But Communist Renewal is part of the left-wing 
cartel. 
  [Spaventa] Both in the Senate sand in the lower house 
Communist Renewal voted against my finance bill. They are well 
aware of who they are dealing with. Nor do I intend to 
relinquish the finance bill. 
  [Valentini] Do you think that anything can be done to combat 
unemployment? 
  [Spaventa] This disaster is affecting the whole of Europe. 
Unfortunately there are no solutions that will work overnight. 
There are means of facilitating higher employment: flexibility, 
the reduction of labor costs -- above all for young people -- 
and labor mobility. For instance, there is no reason to prevent 
any youngster from working in a supermarket for three hours a 
day. 
  [Valentini] Mr. Spaventa, what does "solidarity" mean today? 
  [Spaventa] Well, it is difficult to define in a few words. 
  [Valentini] And who are the "progressives"? 
  [Spaventa] This reminds me of the "shining and progressive 
future." Of course, everyone wants progress. The progressives' 
label seems to me a rather generic one. There is no question of 
changing forms of ownership. The progressives want a 
well-regulated and disciplined form of private capitalism; state 
intervention to regulate and redistribute (this is where the 
concept of solidarity could be relevant) in order not to debase 
some and to elevate others. In other words, a system more 
similar to other, better capitalist economies capable of 
achieving social solidarity. A system capable of limiting the 
domination of the economy by politics and, still more, the 
domination of politics by the economy.

<F P=106> [Report by Vittorio Testa: "Berlusconi: `Our Affinities? </F>
We are Lombards...'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "What are the affinities between me and 
[League Secretary] Bossi? There is only one: We were both born 
in Lombardy." "[Clean Hands Public Prosecutor] Di Pietro as 
justice minister? Why not?" "National Alliance [AN]? It could 
provide external support for a League-Forza Italia government, 
assuming a fully-fledged revolution does not take place 
instead." In other words, assuming that Forza Italia and the 
League do not win an absolute majority. "[Pact for Italy 
leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] 
Martinazzoli? They will be defeated, obliterated. They will 
not even manage to have 20 deputies elected." This was the 
political extract distilled yesterday evening by Silvio 
Berlusconi during his star appearance on [interviewer Maurizio] 
Costanzo's "Uno contro tutti" ["One Against All"] TV program. 
While Berlusconi was launching his sally about his non-existent 
affinities with Bossi, for his part the "Lombards" leader was 
not mincing his words in criticizing Forza Italia. Berlusconi -- 
who on Monday [21 February] had told "Mixer" [TV news show] that 
a marriage with the League is essentially a marriage of 
convenience, and that Bossi had many virtues but was also a bit 
uncouth -- blamed Bossi's wrath on a newspaper who used the 
"uncouth" in a headline. Is the marriage of convenience 
beginning to break up even before the elections? 
  Another thorny issue which Berlusconi had to confront during 
"Uno contro tutti" was that of the rejected lists in Veneto and 
Puglia. Berlusconi's evening therefore closed with a couple of 
annoying stumbles on record. However, the Knight's [Berlusconi 
nickname] evening as Costanzo's guest was characterized by a 
tranquil mood, with the presiding interviewer playing the part 
of an impartial, ironical, and caustic moderator; [TG4 TV 
announcer] Emilio Fede that of an enthusiastic supporter of 
Berlusconi; [TG5 TV announcer] Mentana showing himself 
scrupulous and detached; whereas [philosopher] Baget Bozzo was 
aggressive and polemical both against Costanzo and "a certain 
left-wing ethos" which, in his opinion, tarnished the most 
incisive contributions, namely, those made by journalists 
Barbara Palombelli and Norma Rangeri, who were guilty of having 
asked Berlusconi if he did not find it embarrassing to support 
[Italian Social Movement (MSI) member] Teodoro Buontempo's 
candidacy in the Ostia constituency, which was recently the 
scene of the aggression by the so-called naziskins on a young 
Tunisian. Furthermore, they asked whether Berlusconi did not 
feel that he had projected a somewhat too polished image of 
himself, rather like the image of a millionaire; and why did he 
insist on depicting a possible left-wing government as a curse, 
when the best administered regions in Italy were precisely those 
governed by the Left. Berlusconi said he did not believe that 
those youths belonged to National Alliance. He not only 
condemned that act of violence but also the aggression on 
Mascia, the leader of the boycott against the Snake. He evaded 
the question concerning the left-wing local governments, 
asserting that their successes were "rather limited," and he 
then resumed a forceful tone: "Wherever their recipe was 
applied, it failed miserably." And again: "The communists, the 
PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] say they have changed. But, 
if I may make this comparison, it is as if someone who has been 
a thief all his life suddenly puts himself forward to become a 
magistrate." On the subject of his TV spots' ostentation, he 
said ironically: "All right. Next time I'll have them filmed in 
my garage." Norma Rangieri remarked she had glimpsed "a very 
valuable painting, perhaps by Tiepolo" behind the Knight, in one 
of his "TV spots." "I can assure you that you are mistaken," 
Berlusconi replied. Fede added: "The Tiepolo was a present for 
me, to thank me for having broadcast his first convention." 
Berlusconi came out in Fede's defense: "He took an objective 
approach. He decided to show Italians an object of great 
interest." Berlusconi then accused the press of publishing 
accounts which were full of gaps: "Color, and nothing more. No 
coverage of what I actually said."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bossi Breaks the Ice -- It Is </F>
Possible With Fini"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] There is no room in the 
government for the National Alliance [AN] but there is room for 
it in the parliamentary majority. For the first time, [Northern 
League Secretary] Umberto Bossi has abandoned his crusading tone 
and opened up to Fini's right wing. 
  He did it at the same time the leader of the AN was shaking 
the hand held out to him by [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi. "The right is ready to govern," Fini replied to the 
call put out by Berlusconi, who wants to transform the electoral 
agreement between Forza Italia, the Alliance, the League, and 
the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] into the political 
alignment destined to govern the country after 27 March. 
  In the space of a single day, the moderate alignment took 
more than one step forward. Interviewed on Rete 4 [Fininvest TV 
station], it was Bossi who broke the ice. To speak of Fini's 
movement he took the long way around. He reiterated that the 
Fascist Party had become the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and 
that the MSI "then became something else again," implicitly 
admitting that a change was underway. "In parliament, Fini's 
group will be statist, whereas now it is antistatist," he noted 
with irony. 
  Thus, it is possible to move from opposition to cooperation. 
That does not, however, include cooperation in the executive, 
the League secretary warned, "since they have to clean up their 
act." Bossi predicted support "from the outside," to cite him 
verbatim. 
  In short, they are no longer "fascists" but "snails": even 
Bossi's words appear at least kindly this time. Is this just a 
momentary conversion? According to Roberto Maroni, the League's 
parliamentary floor leader, the AN will not form part of the 
government. The League and Forza Italia "have the consensus 
they need" and will form a minority executive to which "anyone 
can give their external support." Thus, Fini's deputies would 
not be unwelcome. 
  A dialogue is underway -- albeit at a distance, and with all 
the necessary provisos (no to government posts, but yes to 
forming part of the majority) -- between the League and the AN. 
Moreover, an agreement has been concluded between Fini and 
Berlusconi. 
  Opening the electoral campaign in the capital, the MSI 
secretary also dropped the "anti-everything" tone he used to 
adopt back in [former President] Cossiga's days, in the same way 
as the Forza Italia leader has toned down his anticommunist 
stance of recent days. The explanation is clear: Fini and 
Berlusconi are today opting for proposal rather than protest, 
since the polls show them on the up -- i.e., no longer in 
howling opposition, but in the lineup being put forward for the 
government. 
  Fini stressed: "Moving from the first to the second republic 
must include overcoming the divisions of the past and bring 
about the union of Italians who are trying to roll up their 
sleeves and get down to work." Fini asked his followers to 
refuse the "left's policy of casting its opponents in the role 
of the Devil." He asked the moderates to "oppose the statism 
which links [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] 
Achille Occhetto, [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti, and 
[Italian Republican Party Chairman] Visentini today, and which 
will try to embrace [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Mino 
Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni tomorrow." 
  Bossi said of Segni: "I will let him come forward for a 
while and then I will strike him and beat him back, because I 
know that the DC [Christian Democratic Party] plus Segni will 
disappear from Italian politics in the new electoral system. 
Then it will be we and the former DC centrists, whom we are 
holding onto so they do not have to fall back into the oblivion 
left by the disappearance of their former party."

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F>
Francesco Sorti in Rome on 19 February: "`Rather Maroni Than 
Ciampi'"] 
  [Text] "We are within arm's reach of government. Remember: 
We are the only ones who can keep the promise of federalism, 
regionalism, and fiscal decentralization. The others, 
especially the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and the Pact 
members, are just creating confusion. The head of the next 
government has one name alone: [League lower house floor 
leader] Roberto Maroni, and we will win almost everything in the 
North. In the center and south, on the other hand, [Forza 
Italia leader] Berlusconi is the one who will save the day." In 
his first interview since the beginning of the election 
campaign, [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi outlined his 
strategy for combating the front led by the PDS. 
  [Sorti] Bossi, tomorrow is the day of reckoning for the 
League. We shall at last know officially who your candidates 
are. Any advance news? 
  [Bossi] There will be no big surprises. As far as I know, 
almost all our current deputies will be running again. 
  [Sorti] You have been unexpectedly "betrayed" by Germontani, 
who has gone over to Fini. 
  [Bossi] It came as no surprise to us. Let us not forget that 
the Federal Italy League was a "federalist provocation" in an 
environment that, in reality, was not yet ripe for federalism. 
  [Sorti] How many constituencies do you expect to win in the 
North? 
  [Bossi] More or less all of them. The League is the only 
road open in the North. 
  [Sorti] Nevertheless, the election campaign in the other 
regions will be extremely hard-fought. What do you expect to 
achieve in the major cities in central Italy, where the PDS has 
an extremely strong network of influence? 
  [Bossi] That is a question you should ask Berlusconi. He 
knows better than I do how the attack on Rome and the rest of 
central Italy will have to be launched. 
  [Sorti] In other words, it is up to him. 
  [Bossi] It is up to him because in some areas we have seen 
that we cannot get beyond 1-2 percent. That is where the votes 
that used to go to the former DC [Christian Democratic Party], 
which in reality no longer exists, must be drained off. 
  [Sorti] After the election a government will have to be 
formed, and the League could be part of it as well. But with 
whom? National Alliance, for example, does not seem to be on the 
shortlist of potential alliesnsulates 
  [Bossi] I confirm that. I do not believe at all that we 
could govern with [National Alliance Secretary] Gianfranco Fini, 
who suddenly pronounced himself a federalist a month ago: a 
quick-change act in which Fini ran the risk of losing his 
grass-roots support overnight. 
  [Sorti] In its manifesto, the PDS stresses fiscal 
decentralization and regionalism. 
  [Bossi] I know. That bunch think that all they need is a 
pinch of federalism, a pinch of privatization, and hey presto! 
The PDS manifesto! The truth of the matter is that nearly all 
of them are trying to recycle themselves as best they can, 
whereas people must not forget that we are the ones who provided 
the decisive thrust to topple the old parties like the DC and 
the PSI [Italian Socialist Party]. We are the real federalists 
and antistatists. 
  [Sorti] But who will be prime mininster? Give us at least 
three names. 
  [Bossi] Three names? I will cite only one, that of Roberto 
Maroni. I b. ve he would be an excellent prime minister, 
although he would probably suggest someone else... 
  [Sorti] What about Berlusconi? Objections are voiced on 
several sides that if Berlusconi were to become prime minister, 
the opposition would attack him on account of his alleged 
"interests" as a businessman. 
  [Bossi] We have never proposed Berlusconi as head of 
government. As a Milanese proverb has it, everyone should stick 
to his own trade. However, the qualifications required by 
  Some of government are obvious: He must know his own mind, 
he must be consistent, and he must have the requisite openness. 
I would also add that he must not be liable to blackmail, or at 
least he must have no intention of being blackmailed. 
  [Sorti] Italy has always been the country of blackmail and 
veto and counterveto ... 
  [Bossi] Yes, but I solved the biggest case of veto and 
counterveto for Italy when I kept the DC and [Pact for Italy 
leader] Segni out of the two opposing poles: That was the 
biggest case of blackmail, the biggest ambiguity, and we were 
the ones who "dealt with it."

<F P=106> [Stefano Marroni report: "Bertinotti Stirs Up Treasury Bill </F>
War"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "Every time that attention is turned in 
Italy to fiscal questions, the same reaction is stirred up: 
From the center-left there is always someone who is seeking to 
appear as the protector of small and legitimate interests, in 
order to defend large and illegitimate interests. This time, 
however, I have the feeling that the maneuver will not succeed: 
ordinary people, pensioners, workers will have no difficulty in 
understanding the prize at stake." Fausto Bertinotti does not 
agree, and resolutely rejects the squall of criticism which is 
descending on him from almost the whole of the political world. 
  A wall of noes greets his hint that the left will need, if 
it 
enters government, to review the taxation of interest on 
treasury bills, for anyone owning government securities in an 
amount exceeding 200 million lire [L]. However, he is not 
giving in, stating that he will be announcing tomorrow the 
details of a proposal for an inheritance tax, which is one of 
the key items -- together with reducing the workweek to 35 hours 
-- of Communist Renewal's program. 
  But the "treasury bill war" has now been triggered, and 
everything leads us to believe that it will continue throughout 
the election campaign. The right --from the League to the 
National Alliance -- is attacking: denouncing the attempt to 
further squeeze those who save, and gleefully attributing the 
Communist Renewal secretary's intentions to the whole of the 
progressive ticket. For Forza Italia's Antonio Martin 
Bertinotti starts with "the right premise," but comes to the 
wrong conclusion. "It is true," the economist states, "that in 
absolute terms the fact of excluding interest on government 
securities from taxation leads to unfair results, with a person 
earning L100 million from working paying half this sum in taxes, 
while someone earning this amount from securities keeps the full 
amount. But this inequity is not so easy to resolve: Unless 
one accepts a huge rise in real interest rates and and a whole 
set of negative consequences on the budget and employment." 
  At the center, Pact for Italy members and the PPI [Italian 
Popular Party] let it be known that Bertinotti's proposal "does 
not make sense," and, as PPI politician Roberto Pinza points 
out, an attack on savings "would end up increasing the hostility 
generated by the tax burden." Tax lawyer and Pact candidate 
Giulio Tremonti gives Renewal's leader credit for at least being 
ostensibly and completely consistent with the culture of the 
"financial left." From this perspective Bertinotti's views are 
more coherent and convincing -- Tremonti states in an open 
polemic with refutation of the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left] program -- than those of certain groups whose internal 
rivalry we are currently witnessing. And the VOCE REPUBBLICANA 
speaks of a left which is in jeopardy, which goes "into battle 
with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi by implying a tax on 
savings, while latter promises to abolish as much tax as 
possible. Let us therefore not be surprised then, if the right 
is already shouting victory based on opinion poll results." 
  But quite a lot of Bertinotti's allies are also distancing 
themselves, and not hiding their irritation and embarrassment at 
a move which could boomerang. Or, in the words of Socialist 
Fabrizio Cicchitto, an "exercise which is good only for losing 
votes for the progressive front." After Mussi's "political" 
clarification, the PDS is letting the voices of its technicians 
be heard: "There is no need to intervene with new taxes on 
treasury bills," Vincenzo Visco, responsible for PDS tax policy, 
assures; interest rates are falling, and we are moving toward a 
stabilization of government debt. The deficit reduction is 
being obtained by another means, and for this reason 
interventions of this kind do not make sense." 
  For Paolo Leon, any revision of the taxation of financial 
activities is not a question for the near future and , 
therefore, "should not be viewed as a threat but as an 
opportunity." But Filippo Cavazzuti is very decisive: 
"Treasury bill holders can be calm -- the vice chairman of the 
Senate Financial Committee explains -- the suggestion of a 
revision of the taxation of treasury bills is not shared by the 
majority of the progressive front. It is a position of the 
Renewal." 
  Nor does Bertinotti hide that this is so, and waxes ironic 
on the fact that, in Italy "it falls to a Communist force to 
advance proposals of a frankly socialist flavor." For him, "no 
one has been able to explain in a convincing way why L50 million 
earned by an employee should be taxed at the source, and the 
same income, in the form of interest on treasury bills, should 
be totally exempt." The Renewal, Bertinotti assures us, has no 
intention of taxing the small saver, "the fruit of labor which 
has already been amply taxed. It is obvious that, as is the 
case a primary residence and any inheritance tax, one must 
provide an exemption threshold below which nothing is paid. I 
have mentioned the figure of L200 million." 
  The question of taxing wealth, that is another matter, the 
Renewal's leader makes the distinction, "because this is what we 
are talking about: the raking up of treasury bills was how, 
during the eighties, large industrial profits, trillions, were 
transferred from production to financial investment. This has 
been the path of the `financialization' of Italian capitalism, 
which with one hand collected contributions from the state for 
restructuring, and on the other hand was investing in treasury 
bills instead of in plant and machinery. And therefore 
reviewing the taxation of securities -- with the qualification 
that if interest rates fall, taxes will also be reduced -- also 
means promoting the return of resources from financial 
investment to productive investment, to industrial 
capitalization." 
  For his critics, and in particular those of the left, 
Bertinotti has a curt response: " What needs to be determined 
is whether or not the will exists to reform the tax system, 
whether it is possible to achieve equity while surrendering to 
unacceptable blackmail. I have the impression that many of 
these heated objections are specific to the election campaign. 
In the past, millions of workers went on strike, based on CGIL 
[Italian General Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian 
Confederation of Trade Unions], and UIL [Italian Federation of 
Trade Unions] programs, which had this proposal at their center. 
And by the way," he concludes sarcastically, "I do not remember 
major objections being raised in those days."

<F P=106> [Report by Marco Ventura: "Occhetto Wants Ciampi at the </F>
Quirinale"] 
  [Text] Rome -- For the past few days the PDS [Democratic 
Party of the Left] has kept silent about Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. 
This confirms that a bargain has been struck: The former Bank 
of Italy governor can now start training to jog his way up to 
the Quirinale [President's Palace]. On the other hand, Palazzo 
Chigi [prime minister's office] would now open its doors to [IRI 
(Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) President] Romano 
Prodi. 
  This changeover is expected to take place after the 27 March 
elections -- Sisde [scandal allowing. It is the voters who will 
indicate the timing and the way in which it is carried out. The 
coupling of the two politicians is indissolubly linked to the 
vote. In order for it to be possible, the progressives must win. 
However, they must win with a percentage that forces them to 
join forces with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian 
People's Party (PPI) secretary Mino] Martinazzoli. Basically, 
this you-scratch-my-back-I'll-scratch-yours arrangement looks 
set to be the ideal result of an agreement between left-wing 
forces and Mino [Martinazzoli] and Mariotto [Segni's] centrists: 
a left-wing Catholic -- Prodi -- for prime minister, and a 
personality capable of vouching politically for the PDS for 
seven long years -- Ciampi -- as head of state. Is this 
political fiction? 
  In order to explain the maneuvering currently under way, we 
must start with [PDS Secretary] Occhetto. Together with PDS 
Deputy Secretary Massimo D'Alema, the PDS secretary has become a 
TV globetrotter. Massimo paid a visit to [Fininvest talk show 
host] Costanzo, and Achille [Occhetto] hurried off to be 
[Fininvest talk show host] Funari's guest. D'Alema also payed 
Funari a visit, and Occhetto evened the score by meeting [RAI 
talk show host] Minoli. Fair enough, the tandem is faced with 
the task of explaining, to millions of Italians, the difference 
between "being under investigation" and "being reported." 
However, it was precisely in the course of the political and 
judiciary tour that Occhetto, in response to a question, said: 
"For us, Ciampi is a reserve of democracy." 
  At first, everybody considered Carlo Azeglio a dignified 
reserve player for the Palazzo Chigi, where he already occupies 
a seat anyway. This hypothesis is becoming increasingly 
improbable. Ciampi could continue to be prime minister if the 
progressives were to win massive support in the elections. 
Basically, the former governor would remain at the head of the 
new government for a few months, long enough to make Italians 
digest the victory of the former communists, in order to then 
pass on command directly to Occhetto. However, judging from the 
opinion polls, it is unlikely that the left forces will win more 
than 40 percent of the vote. Assuming the coalition made up by 
[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, [League leader] Bossi, and 
[National Alliance Secretary] Fini does not achieve more than 50 
percent, the PDS will be forced to seek the support of the 
Center's survivors -- Martinazzoli and Mariotto -- in order to 
be able to govern. This is, in fact, the objective of the plan 
which many are engaged in putting together behind the scenes: 
Prodi thrown in the bargain to keep the People's Party happy, 
and ferry-man Ciampi providing the maximum guarantee for the 
PDS. There is no lack of small and large signals pointing to 
the resurrection of the accord between the Catholics and the 
PDS. A case in point is the appointment of Mario Sarcinelli to 
head the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which was welcomed by 
Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] and even sponsored by the 
PDS, just as Renato Riverso's upcoming nomination as chairman of 
the national airline company Alitalia. Riverso is favored by 
Ciampi and Prodi. The latter would also be getting ready to 
wipe the slate clean at the STET [Turin Telephone Finance 
Company] by replacing Chairman Biagio Agnes and Managing 
Director Michele Tedeschi. Are these purely coincidental 
occurrences, or rather a foretaste of what may happen after 27 
March? 
  In order to steer to the Left, Occhetto has no alternative 
but to establish a link between the Palazzo Chigi and the 
Quirinale issues. The Sisde storm is not abating, and it is 
becoming increasingly difficult for the progressives to defend 
Scalfaro in an official capacity. But, if it wins, the PDS, 
must not "scare off" moderate voters by choosing a head of state 
-- such as Borrelli, the head of the Milan Public Prosecutor's 
office or, even less, Rete member Capponnetto -- who might -- 
admittedly for very different reasons -- appear to be partisan, 
just to mention two of the names currently being mentioned at 
the Quirinale. Paradoxically, Ciampi would ensure innovation 
within a framework of continuity, having already headed the 
government and being very reliable, in the estimation of 
Occhetto's party. 
  The rest of the Catholic-progressive team would include 
[lower house Speaker] Giorgio Napolitano as foreign minister, 
[Anti-Mafia Commission Chairman] Luciano Violante as interior 
minister, Massimo D'Alema as defense minister, [Budget Minister] 
Luigi Spaventa as budget minister, and [PDS financial affairs 
spokesman] Vincenzo Visco to deal with the problems of the 
economy. In order to show its democratic goodwill, the PDS 
would also take [Labor Minister] Gino Giugni on board as labor 
minister, [Civil Service Minister] Sabino Cassese as head of the 
civil service, and [former judge] Giuseppe Ayala as justice 
minister. That, more or less, is the Left's shadow cabinet, 
which would obviously give Green Party Coordinator Carlo Ripa di 
Meana the environment portfolio. Of course, at the height of 
the electoral campaign none of those involved will be willing to 
confirm that they are aiming for the various ministries, much 
less for the Palazzo Chigi or the Quirinale. Ciampi was still 
saying that he is to stay out of the fray. Quite, but only if 
the moderate front carries the day.

<F P=106> [Antonello Caporale report: "Signatures Betray Segni"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- Disqualified before the start. Excluded 
from the last round in this very tough election campaign without 
even having been able to size up their adversary. [Pact for 
Italy leader] Mariotto Segni is paying a higher price than some. 
His list, the Pact for Italy, is absent from several electoral 
constituencies. There are a few problems (fewer than before) 
for [Radical leader] Marco Pannella, and a few difficulties 
(more than expected) for the Democratic Alliance, the Greens, 
and Rete. 
  It is the fault, so to speak, of the new electoral law, of 
its least well-known rule, which requires for the presentation 
of each list the signatures of no less than 4,000 citizens (and 
no more than 4,500) for each of the 26 proportional 
constituencies into which Italy is divided. And of 500 
signatures to support the candidates in the single-candidate 
constituencies. In this election, however, these figures have 
been reduced by decree to half, since it is taking place early. 
  This was not the case before. All the parties represented in 
parliament by at least one deputy were exempted from having to 
gather signatures. Now no such allowances apply to anyone. As 
expected, this penalizes most the less well-structured groups 
with the least well-established support throughout Italy. There 
have been no problems for the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left], the League, or the National Alliance. Forza Italia 
(which was able to count on the League in the North and on the 
organized strength of many faction leaders of the former 
four-party alliance in the South) found things harder than 
expected. Be that as it may, there has been no confirmation (or 
denial) of any difficulties from its headquarters at Arcore. 
  However, there was confirmation from Segni's headquarters on 
largo del Nazareno: The Pact's list -- which is separate from 
that of Martinazzoli's Popular Party -- will definitely not be 
presented in Basilicata, Abruzzi, Trentino, and Lombardy 3. 
There are also fears for the future of the Pact in the Lazio 2, 
Piedmont, and Veneto constituencies. So Segni, who holds the 
record for gathering signatures (he made his involvement 
conditional on gathering a million signatures in support of his 
policy line) is suffering the shame of seeing his group excluded 
from many cities in both the North and the South of the country, 
as a result of his movement's still weak organization. 
  The Democratic Alliance has also emerged battered from the 
chase for signatures. The numbers achieved mean that Adornato 
and Bordon are being forced to relinquish their candidacies in 
Abruzzo, Basilicata, and in Lombardy 2 and Veneto 2. There are 
major anxieties about the findings of the local courts of appeal 
in Friuli and Marches. 
  Lucania has treated the Greens badly, too. They are bowing 
out of Lombardy 3 and Lazio 2. Rete is having to leave Friuli 
and Veneto 2. However, Marco Pannella's list was again able to 
benefit from his long experience of organizing referendums. The 
Radicals managed to limit the damage, though Pannella's list was 
not successful in Basilicata and Marches. The figures for 
Trentino and Umbria have still to be confirmed. 
  It was Pannella who sounded the warning. Beware, he said: 
we need thousands of signatures to back our lists on the 
electoral registers. People do not realize this, he shouted; 
the press and television stations are saying nothing about it. 
Suddenly all the minor groupings -- which have been busy for 
weeks recruiting, shifting, or turning down candidates -- 
realized that he was right. Only last Thursday [17 February] 
(the Pact finalized its lists late Friday morning) did they turn 
their attention to signatures. The law requires that the 
gathering of signatures follow the choice of candidates; that 
the signatories all be residents of the constituencies in which 
the candidates are standing; and, moreover, that each signature 
be accompanied by an electoral certificate. In some cases, that 
really proved too much.

<F P=106> [Report by "s.m.": "Pannella the Dueller Aims for </F>
Bull's-Eye"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- Once upon a time there was the Radical 
Party. Then came the Anti-Prohibitionists and the Pannella List. 
Now Marco Pannella has invented another label, that of the 
"Reformers"; has revived his List; and has succeeded in planting 
a number of loyal associates in areas dominated by the Northern 
League, thanks to a last-minute agreement between Pannella and 
[Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. Thus, the keenest 
supporter of the plain single-candidate system -- that is, of a 
British-style two-party system -- is yet again swimming against 
the tide and complicating matters by aligning his candidates 
under three different banners (four, including the League's). 
If this proves successful, Pannella will hit the bull's-eye. 
If not, he and all his men risk missing a turn. 
  As he promised, Pannella will challenge Italian Social 
Movement [MSI] Secretary Fini in the capital's most right-wing 
constituency, Rome 24 (Prati-Flaminio-Tor di Quinto), where the 
progressive forces are fielding Edoardo Missoni and the Pact is 
fielding the Liberals' Costanza Pera. Running under the same 
banner ("Pannella List-Reformers"), the paparazzo, Oliviero 
Toscani, will be running against [Democratic Party of the Left 
Secretary] Occhetto and Pierferdinando Casini [Christian 
Democratic Center] in the red constituency of Bologna 3, while 
Paolo Villaggio (who failed to be elected by a whisker last time 
round, on Communist Renewal's list) will be standing in a 
college in his home region of Liguria. These three different 
names, with different backgrounds, perhaps share a common future 
of almost certain defeat. Indeed, Pannella's aim seems to be, 
rather, to make a provocative protest against the predominant 
absence of real competition in this election. 
  But what about seats in parliament? Those should result from 
the proportional quotas, to which the Pannella List will try to 
accede in almost all the regions (apart from the smallest -- 
Umbria, Molise, Basilicata, Marches, and Calabria, where it has 
not even presented lists). The other 19 constituencies will be 
contested by (apart from Pannella himself) the usual members of 
his clan -- Emma Bonino, Roberto Cicciomessere, Peppino 
Calderisi, Massimo Teodori, Paolo Vigevano, Lorenzo Strik 
Lievers, Marco Taradash, Elio Vito... The interconnections have 
been so made that if the threshold of 4 percent is achieved the 
whole clan will return to the lower house. If not, there will be 
no seats, and it will be farewell to the Pannella List. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Carla Aguiar: "The End of Social Distribution"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The very foundations of social security are 
threatened by an earthquake of gigantic dimensions called 
"aging." The system for financing social security presently 
rests on the contributions of 3.5 active citizens per retired 
worker, a situation already responsible for large state deficits. 
  Were the system to continue unchanged, however, prospects 
are 
even more disquieting, given that in 60 years, barely 1.3 active 
workers will pay the costs for each retiree. This means that in 
the year 2050, each worker will bear alone the almost entire 
amount a retiree costs. 
  Within this scenario, the system's financial burden may 
"grow 
7.5 times," from 300 million contos distributed in 1990 in old 
age pensions to almost 2.3 billion contos, meaning that the 
system's deficit will rise to "unconscionable heights." 
  This is the point of departure chosen by the authors of the 
book Financing Retirement: The Contribution of the 
Insurance Sector to reach alternative solutions. [passage 
omitted] They advocate the adoption of a mixed, noncompulsory 
system at the company or individual level, leading to the 
accumulation of funds. The management of the these funds may be 
entrusted to entities specializing in this type of activity, 
such as, for instance, insurance companies or pension fund 
managers. 
  While three other types of theoretical solutions are 
possible, "their practical applications entail difficulties": 
pensions can be reduced, the retirement age can be pushed back, 
or contributions can be increased during a worker's active life. 
  Despite the fear expressed by the specialists with regard to 
the first two solutions, given the Portuguese social reality of 
"small pensions with companies increasingly resorting to early 
retirements," the government did not hesitate to postpone the 
retirement age and modify the basis for computing retirements, 
an initiative that resulted in smaller pensions in a number of 
cases. The new social security law also increased the 
contributions of self-employed workers.

<F P=106> [Morten Fyhn and Geir Salvesen report: "Internal EU </F>
Conflict Leaves Its Mark on Negotiations"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Late yesterday evening, after three 
hours of debate, the EU [European Union] countries' foreign 
ministers had still not succeeded in reaching agreement on a 
joint fisheries position vis-a-vis Norway. But the Spanish 
demands for a large quota have not been rejected, and clear 
signals from the meeting indicate that at today's negotiating 
meeting with Trade Minister Grete Knudsen the EU will try to 
find out how far Norway is willing to go. 
  Yesterday evening the trade minister was disappointed that 
there has still been no clarification from the EU. "There is 
nothing special in the fact that things are moving so slowly in 
the final spurt, but I had hoped that the fisheries position 
would be ready by the time we arrived in Brussels," she said. 
  If Knudsen firmly rejects demands for increased EU quotas 
the 
EU will be forced to decide what concrete demands should be 
pushed in the negotiations next weekend. If the other EU 
countries either are unable to force Spain onto the retreat, or 
choose to back a demand for a little fish at least, the scene 
will have been set for a crisis in the negotiations. 
  "I think that Norway will have to expect that the EU will 
make strong demands on Norway in the fisheries field," 
Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos told AFTENPOSTEN. Poos 
said that Norway's stance that it does not have a single fish to 
give away has given rise to strong reactions from some of the EU 
countries. At the meeting Poos stressed that the EU must take 
account of the Norwegian demands, chiefly those to do with the 
country's northernmost regions which are particularly dependent 
on fishing. 
  "But Norway cannot expect the EU not to demand access to 
Norwegian waters," Poos said. But he believes that Norway is in 
a good negotiating position bearing mind the fact that several 
EU countries do not want to give Norway full access to the EU 
market from day one of membership. 
  "You can do a trade off market access against quotas," he 
proposed. 
  A major problem for the EU countries' attempts to hammer out 
a common fisheries stance is the fact that Spain -- supported by 
Portugal -- does not want the EU concept of relative stability 
to apply to an EU with 16 members. Relative stability means 
that quota allocation occurs on the basis of historical rights. 
Spain has claimed that with new countries in the EU a new 
situation arises which means that all quota allocations must be 
renegotiated. Such a demand is unacceptable to a number of EU 
countries, including Denmark. 
  At yesterday's meeting on fish Spain reiterated its demands 
for 7,000 tonnes of cod for itself and a so-called solidarity 
quota of 11,000 tonnes. Spain and Portugal are also opposed to 
the idea that Norway will have better access to the EU's waters 
than they themselves have achieved. They will not have full 
access until 2003. France and Ireland are standing firm on 
their demand that Norway be denied full market access. Here 
Spain is proposing that Norway adopt voluntary limits on exports. 
  It is likely that there will be limits to how much progress 
can be made in the round of direct negotiations with the 
applicant countries which begins today. Norway thinks that it 
is realistic to expect to tie up the energy protocol, the 
declaration of the principle of public access to information, 
and questions to do with the position of the Lapps. But these 
are mere bagatelles against the heavyweight areas which will 
have to wait until the weekend. 
  The trade minister said yesterday that Norway still has the 
goal of negotiating in parallel with the other Nordic countries. 
But Norway thinks that achieving a good agreement is more 
important than the danger that Norway could fall behind a little. 
  Late last night the EU countries took a break from the 
fisheries discussion and tackled agricultral and regional 
issues. In this latter area the Commission has proposed that a 
new so-called objective region classification be created -- 1(A) 
-- for the Nordic countries. They in their turn have asked to 
receive structural support under today's Objective 1 region 
classification -- something to which Spain, among others, is 
opposed. The new objective region classification aims to meet 
the applicants' demands that account be taken of their special 
circumstances.

  [Text] Sweden has turned down a United Nations request to 
send more troops to Bosnia on the grounds that it presently has 
no soldiers trained to carry out the assignment. Sixteen other 
countries, including Norway, have also been approached. And, 11 
Swedes are receiving intensive training in Serbo-Croatian in 
order to serve as interpreters in the Nordic UN battalion in 
Bosnia. They are to replace Swedish interpreters of Yugoslavian 
origin who, it is feared, run the risk of being considered 
biased by Bosnia's ethnic groups on the grounds of their accents 
or family names.

<F P=106> [TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA report: "EU Proposal Could </F>
Provide Support for the North"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The EU [European Union] Commission is 
putting forward a new proposal on regional policy in the 
membership negotiations. The proposals opens up the possibility 
of additional support for Norrland. 
  "Understanding of the problems of Norrland is growing in the 
EU," European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel commented. 
  The Commission is proposing that a new category of support 
be 
introduced which will mean that additional support can go to 
regions with a low population density -- fewer than 7 
inhabitants per square kilometer. 
  This would cover large areas of Norrland. It is therefore a 
proposal which is fully in line with the Swedish Government's 
demands in recent weeks. 
  The EU Commission has made its proposal after member 
countries were unable to reach agreement on support for the 
northernmost regions of Norway, Finland, and Sweden. 
  But when the proposal was discussed by the EU countries on 
Monday [21 February] evening it ran into opposition chiefly from 
France and Spain who are opposed on principle to any changes to 
the EU's current rules. However, the proposal had the support 
of several member countries. 
  The Commission is proposing that the new category of 
support, 
which is being called 1(A), should provide a slightly lower 
level of support per inhabitant than Objective 1 support, which 
is paid to poor regions. But it will be a level of support that 
is higher than that from the other support funds, to industrial 
and agricultural regions with problems -- so-called Objective 2 
and Objective 5B support. Unlike other proposals this would 
also mean that a new permanent form of support would be 
introduced. 
  In its proposal, which TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA has seen, 
the Commission writes that this new form of support could also 
solve the special problems of the inland regions of Sweden south 
of Norrbotten. 
  The Swedish Government has demanded the highest possible 
level of support for Sweden's four northernmost provinces and 
for Halsingland and Gavleborg province. But Ulf Dinkelspiel has 
said that the important thing is that the EU recognizes 
Norrland's special problems. 
  On Monday Dinkelspiel met the EC commissioner responsible 
for 
regional policy and probably discussed the new proposal. He was 
unwilling to say whether the new proposal fits the bill for 
Sweden. But he looks clearly satisfied, after being criticized 
at home for making demands that looked too much like ultimatums 
in the negotiations on regional policy. 
  "There are some interesting ideas in the proposal," 
Dinkelspiel said. 
  The new proposal states that countries like Finland and 
Norway can have some regions which are classified as Objective 1 
regions and which will therefore receive the highest possible 
level of support. Other regions which do not fully meet the 
EU's poverty criteria will receive support according to the 
criteria of Objective 1(A). 
  Payments from other support funds, such as Objectives 2 and 
5B, will not be affected by the new category of support. 
  The EU Commission has also put forward a concrete proposal 
about the circumstances under which the applicant nations may 
give additional support to farmers in their northern parts over 
and above the normal EU support for agriculture. One of the 
conditions is that such support will only go to agriculture 
north of the 62nd parallel, which is more or less on a level 
with Sundsvall in Sweden. 
  But farmers south of this line will also be able to receive 
support in certain cases. Among the criteria being proposed is 
that population density must not exceed 10 persons per square 
kilometer. The size of support will be based on the number of 
animals on or the cultivated area of each farm. 
  However, the EU Commission is proposing that the applicant 
countries must foot the bill for all of this additional support, 
while the Swedish Government wants the EU budget to be 
responsible for a large proportion of this money. 
  This proposal from the Commission looked to be winning the 
support of member countries on Monday evening. 
  Dinkelspiel will meet the EU ministers for negotiations 
today. But yesterday evening it was still unclear whether the 
meeting will lead to any further agreements. 
  The two sides are close to an agreement on tourists' 
duty-free alcohol allowances and other regulations covering 
travelers. On Monday evening the EU countries agreed to give 
the applicant countries two alternatives for how long they are 
to be allowed to limit the import of alcohol and tobacco on 
which tax has already been paid. Either a four-year 
transitional period with no possibility of extension or a 
two-year transitional period with a review thereafter which 
could make an extension possible -- on the lines of the 
so-called Danish model. 
  This offer will be put to Finland today in a so-called 
minipackage, which will also include summer cottages, Aland, and 
the ferries which sail between Sweden and Finland. 
  Yesterday evening it was unclear whether the proposal on 
regulations covering travelers will also be raised in the 
Swedish negotiations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Anne Wibble by "J.D."; </F>
place and date not given: "Anne Wibble: `Single Currency Is 
Essential to Single Market'"] 
  [Text] [LES ECHOS] What advantages do you hope to gain 
from Sweden's membership of the European Union [EU]? 
  [Wibble] A series of good things thanks to greater 
integration: more competition, a more open economy, and support 
for the vital structural changes in our country. But, in my 
view, the greatest benefit will be to make Sweden more 
attractive to foreign investors, especially for investments with 
high added value. I also hope that this membership will 
contribute to reviving growth and improving the employment 
situation. In exchange, we represent a major potential market 
for the Twelve who will also be able to benefit from our 
research programs and our openness to third countries. 
  [LES ECHOS] What do you think is the main problem to be 
overcome before the end of the negotiations? 
  [Wibble] There are three: agriculture, regional policy, and 
the amount of our contribution to the EU budget. But in the 
present debate which is taking place in my country, the budget 
issue strikes me as the most sensitive. Indeed, we do not want 
our arrival in the EU to produce a shock in that area. We have 
launched a medium-term program, adopted by Parliament, to reduce 
our deficits, and my fellow citizens would not understand our 
being forced to change it if our contribution was too high from 
the beginning of membership. Regional policy is also causing 
great anxiety. We want all our territory to be inhabited and 
for that we must maintain economic activities in the north, 
especially through aid to compensate for the large distances 
which separate those regions from the capital. It is important, 
therefore, for us to be able to continue to do that and be 
helped in this by the EU. 
  [LES ECHOS] Can Sweden quickly fulfill the Maastricht 
criteria for moving into the third phase of Economic and 
Monetary Union? 
  [Wibble] Not very quickly because our budget problem is very 
difficult to solve. But our stabilization policy is a step in 
the right direction. Not only toward fulfilling these criteria 
but above all toward stabilizing our economy, which is vital. 
It is also important for our public opinion to understand that 
this program is aimed at restoring growth and employment and is 
not a priority dictated from outside. 
  [LES ECHOS] Are you in favor of the single currency? 
  [Wibble] I support the idea of it. The single currency is 
vital to bring all the advantages of the single market. But the 
timetable for its implementation now strikes me as more 
uncertain than it was a few months ago. At all events, before 
accepting the transition to this single currency, we will have 
to obtain the go-ahead from our Parliament. 
  [LES ECHOS] Do you think that the "yes" vote will prevail in 
the referendum which you will hold when the negotiations have 
been completed? 
  [Wibble] Recently a broad movement seems to have emerged in 
favor of the "yes" vote because the opinion polls are reporting 
an increase of almost 15 percent in the supporters of EU entry. 
But that will largely depend on the results of our negotiations 
with the Twelve. However, I do not think that the Swedes will 
take it into their heads to say no to Europe. I am therefore 
fairly optimistic. Recently, a series of very detailed studies 
on the advantages and disadvantages of our entry into the EU all 
concluded that in most areas, be it the development of our 
economy, social policy, the protection of the environment, or 
even security questions, Sweden stands to gain from joining the 
EU. These are arguments which I hope will convince my fellow 
citizens.

  [Editorial Report] According to Sifo polling between 24 and 
27 January, 47 percent of Swedes now believe their countrymen 
will approve EU [European Union] membership in a referendum; 37 
percent believe they will reject it. The increase in those 
optimistic about approval -- 17 percent -- is the largest 
recorded thus far. Mattias Bengtsson writes in the 4 February 
SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 3 that this is an indication that the 
membership debate has entered a new stage: The yes side has been 
gaining momentum since January polls showed an 8 percent 
increase in support for membership. Bengtsson cites several 
reasons for increased optimism. An upturn in the economic 
situation in Sweden has given people more confidence in the 
future. At the same time, reporting on the EU accession 
negotiations has made membership a more concrete and less 
frightening prospect. About 25 percent more respondents now 
believe that the negotiations are being handled well: 55 
percent in January versus one-third in October.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] On 3 February the Social Democrats for 
the EU [European Union] presented their manifesto of arguments 
for EU membership. According to an article by Ewa Stenberg in 
the 3 February DAGENS NYHETER on page 9, the kickoff of the 
Social Democratic campaign for membership ends what some SDP 
[Social Democratic Party] members had criticized as a period of 
passivity in which the party left it to the conservatives to 
argue for membership. Anders Lindstrom, a member of the group's 
board, said that this passivity gave many Social Democratic 
voters the impression that "the European Union is a rightist 
project that will require reduced social benefits in Sweden." 
The manifesto tries to convince voters otherwise, arguing that 
EU membership is necessary to maintain the welfare state. 
Sweden can only take measures to stimulate the economy and 
eliminate the high unemployment that threatens the welfare state 
in the context of a larger market; the massive speculation 
during the 1992 currency crisis showed that a small country 
cannot keep the economy in balance by itself. The manifesto also 
cites a common security policy and joint action on the 
environment as benefits of membership. Lindstrom believes that 
if Europe had had a common security policy, "the war in the 
former Yugoslavia could have been prevented." 
  Even the liberal DAGENS NYHETER praised the Social 
Democrats' 
manifesto. In an editorial on 4 February on page 2, the paper 
said: "The program is aggressive and modern. It focuses not on 
the Swedish exception but on a radical ambition to join in and 
improve Europe's employment situation, welfare, environment, and 
security together with other countries and parties."

  [Text] Serge Abou, the European Union [EU] observer on the 
Cyprus issue, said that the signing of an agreement between the 
two communities on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] 
would be a significant achievement. Abou also noted that such 
an agreement would create the correct impetus, as he put it, for 
achieving an overall Cyprus solution. 
  In a statement after his meeting with Foreign Minister 
Alekos 
Mikhailidhis this morning, Abou described the contacts he had 
with President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave Feissel [the UN 
secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus] 
as very important in view of the report on the Cyprus issue, 
which he will start preparing for the EU's Council of Ministers. 
  Asked if the CBM's are compatible with EU norms, Abou said 
the United Nations has assured him that there is no problem. 
But, he added, there is no easy answer to this issue. 
Answering another question on Turkey's stance, he noted that 
during his recent visit to Turkey, he received assurances that 
Turkey supports the CBM's. 
  Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said in his statement 
that the government will assist the observer in his task in 
every way. He added: The government's goal is to explain to the 
EU observer the government position on how the various 
approaches toward a Cyprus solution are linked with Cyprus' 
efforts for accession to the EU. 
  Abou completed his orientation visit and left Cyprus this 
afternoon.

  [Text] The government does not intend to turn the 
residents of Famagusta who will return to the fenced-off area 
into an enclave. For this reason, the government is expecting 
answers to the vitally important questions of safety and access 
to Famagusta. This statement was made by Foreign Minister 
Alekos Mikhailidhis, who added that next week the course of 
discussions on the implementation of the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's] will be determined. 
  Mr. Mikhailidhis was addressing a news conference this 
morning on the results of his contacts in Germany and said that 
the prospects for the CBM's are not favorable right now. He 
also stressed that, if the Turkish side's intransigence and 
filibustering tactics continue, the whole course will be 
reexamined. Mr. Mikhailidhis further emphasized that the Greek 
Cypriot side should be particularly careful so as to be 
convincing about the Turkish intransigence and pointed out that 
the discussions on the CBM's will have repercussions on Cyprus' 
efforts for accession to the European Union [EU]. Referring to 
these efforts, Mr. Mikhailidhis said that the next goal set by 
the government is setting a date for opening official EU-Cyprus 
negotiations on the island's accession. This goal, he added, 
will be pursued during the Greek presidency of the EU. Mr. 
Mikhailidhis also expressed satisfaction over his contacts with 
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel who, he said, supported 
Cyprus' accession to the EU.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has stressed that their duty 
should be to protect the Turkish Cypriot people's interests in 
any agreement and to establish a package which will also be 
viable for the Greek Cypriots. Denktas stated that as long as 
the Turkish Cypriots' constructive stand continues the Turkish 
Government will support the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 
[TRNC]. 
  The TRNC delegation comprised of Denktas; Prime Minister 
Hakki Atun; Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime 
minister; Atay Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and defense minister 
returned to the island after completing their contacts in Turkey. 
  In a statement at Ercan [Tymbou] Airport, Denktas said that 
views were exchanged on the Cyprus issue and on the 
confidence-building measures at the meetings held with the 
Turkish delegation headed by President Suleyman Demirel. 
Indicating that the TRNC delegation also submitted its economic 
demands to the Turkish Government, Denktas said that these 
requests were received with understanding. 
  Denktas also expressed the wish that the Greek Cypriot 
administration stop its claim that it is the sole government of 
Cyprus, thus preventing the perpetuation of the negotiations. 
  Denktas said: I told you prior to my departure that I wish 
for us to return from Turkey happy and content. We have 
returned to the island happy and content.

<F P=106> [Interview with Maltese Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami by </F>
Andre Riche; place and date not given: "On Malta Candidacy to 
European Union"] 
  [Text] [Riche] There is a great deal of talk about the 
expansion of the European Union [EU]. Negotiations with Sweden, 
Finland, Norway, and Austria are ending. But negotiations with 
Malta, which is also a candidate, are a long way from starting. 
Are you satisfied with the way in which the EU is treating your 
candidacy? 
  [Adami] We are satisfied with the opinion that the European 
Commission has given on our candidacy. It stresses Malta's 
European vocation and indicates in what sphere the Maltese 
economy will have to be restructured with a view to joining the 
Union. Since then, we have had technical discussions with the 
European Commission's offices. The result is very satisfactory. 
  [Riche] In what spheres are there problems? 
  [Adami] There are some overprotected economic spheres which 
we will have to open and tariff barriers which we are 
dismantling. We will have to continue the program to liberalize 
our economy, particularly in the financial sector. 
  In the fiscal sphere, we will have to come into line with 
the 
European directives, but I think that Malta will always play a 
special role as a financial market place in the Mediterranean 
without being a tax haven. In general, all the provisions which 
the Commission recommended to us are already planned in my 
government's program. 
  [Riche] Your country's small size has often been cited as a 
possible obstacle to membership and to the normal functioning of 
the institutions. 
  [Adami] I am aware that there is an institutional problem 
brewing in the Union which relates to small countries. But 
there is no reason for delaying the membership negotiations if 
Malta fulfills the necessary conditions. 
  [Riche] Would you agree, for instance, that because of its 
small size, your country should not be taken into consideration 
in the Union's rotating presidency? 
  [Adami] I could not accept such discriminatory treatment. 
  [Riche] What benefit could your membership bring to the EU? 
  [Adami] If Malta was a member of the Union, it would bring a 
new political dimension, as a country occupying a central 
position in the Mediterranean, on the Union's southern flank. 
Malta could play an important role as a link between the Union 
and its southern neighbors. 
  [Riche] At present, the Union is negotiating expansion to 
four countries which are much richer than the Community average 
and which will contribute to the budget. Do you think that it 
will quickly negotiate with poorer countries, like Malta, and 
all the other declared candidates? 
  [Adami] Malta is such a small country -- 350,000 inhabitants 
-- that notions of net contributor or net beneficiary from the 
Community budget lose all relevance. Our economic wealth is 
comparable to the levels of Greece or Portugal. Our current 
growth rate is around 4.5 percent. Our inflation is low: Less 
than 4 percent, as is our foreign debt. And unemployment is 4 
percent. Our public deficit is within the Maastricht convergence 
standards. Indeed, we could be members of the Monetary Union. 
  [Riche] What benefit will Malta derive from accession to the 
Union? 
  [Adami] Better opportunities for economic expansion. In a 
way, our economy is already integrated into that of the Union 
because almost 80 percent of our exports go there. In the 
political sphere, membership will bring greater stability to 
Malta and the Mediterranean region. And this stability is bound 
to benefit everybody. 
  [Riche] Are you not afraid that your case will be paired 
with 
that of Cyprus which is also a candidate but which will probably 
have to await a settlement between Greece and Turkey? 
  [Adami] It emerges from all the recent European summits, 
that 
the membership applications of Malta and Cyprus will be taken 
into consideration on their own merits. It is true that the two 
questions have been linked in speaking of "Mediterranean 
candidacies" but since then it has been clearly admitted that 
they are different. 
  [Riche] What is the Maltese public's feeling with regard to 
membership? 
  [Adami] Very largely positive. There is not one organized 
group -- party, trade union, and so forth -- which is opposed to 
it.

  [Text] A bombed attack has been perpetrated on the 
Iraq-Turkey crude oil pipeline near Sirnak's Idil District. 
  According to information received by the BOTAS [Pipeline and 
Petroleum Transport Cooperation] Press and Public Relations 
Office, the bomb, which was placed on the pipeline by 
unidentified persons, exploded yesterday night at around 2115. 
  It was reported that the fire resulting from the explosion 
is 
continuing but that the loss will be minimal due to the 
reduction of the pressure in the pipelines.

  [Text] Sinn Fein said today a "definitive" response to the 
Downing Street declaration on Ulster is unlikely to emerge from 
the party's annual conference in Dublin this weekend. 
  An emergency motion tabled by the executive of the IRA's 
political wing for the two-day meeting merely repeats demands 
for clarification from Britain "which has the power and 
responsibility to advance the situation." 
  Senior Sinn Fein official Pat McGeown said the party had 
been 
left in "an impossible position" by the British refusal to 
clarify the declaration signed in December by Prime Minister 
John Major and Irish Premier Albert Reynolds. 
  He insisted: "There are issues still needing to be 
clarified. 
As soon as we get that clarification we will respond." 
  Mr. McGeown said he believed the IRA were in a similar 
position, adding: "In the present circumstances, it is unlikely 
there will be a definitive decision this weekend." 
  Sinn Fein were seeking explanations from Britain in 
connection with its long-term policy on Northern Ireland, he 
told a Dublin news conference. 
  "The big question is whether the British are serious about 
the peace process." 
  He added that consultations would continue within Sinn Fein, 
but it was still not possible to say when the reponse would come.

<F P=106> [Interview with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl by Ulrich </F>
Wickert at the CDU Congress in Hamburg on 22 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Wickert] Chancellor, the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] has now adopted an economic program. Was this necessary? 
  [Kohl] Of course, an ad hoc program, a crash program is 
essential in the current situation. The program on principles, 
that the Congress in Hamburg will also adopt, defines our 
principles, which are the principles of the social market 
economy, which is what we stand in for. However, at the moment 
we are facing quite unique problems. We are not only faced with 
an economic crisis but with a deep structural slump. We now 
have to pay for the mistakes that were made in our society in 
two or three decades, which is why we must press for rapid 
changes. Let me give you one example: Our main problem -- 
unemployment -- could be tackled much more quickly. At the 
moment there are somewhat more than 4 million people without 
work in Germany, which is too many, far too many. Hence, we 
have to stimulate the economy to protect jobs and create new 
jobs. Still, we have an example in our immediate vicinity -- 
the Netherlands, and they can be compared with us. In the 
Netherlands, 34 percent of all jobs are part-time jobs, while in 
Germany it is no more than 14 percent. There are 2.5 million 
Germans who would like to work part-time and who do have 
employment. So something could be changed quickly. We have 
created the legal conditions. The state -- this also applies to 
us, the federal, laender, and local governments -- the 
companies, and trade unions must now try to create new jobs for 
those who are interested in part-time work. 
  [Wickert] In your address you almost sounded like a leader 
of the opposition. You spoke of decades of controversy, of 
over-regulations, that is too say too much bureaucracy. Yet, 
you have been in power for 12 years. So could you not have 
changed a thing or two? 
  [Kohl] The problems as far as over-regulation are concerned 
are not only problems of the past 10 years. 
  [Wickert] Still, you could have changed something. 
  [Kohl] But we did. First of all, I would like to say that I 
was not putting the blame on anybody. We have discussed railway 
reform since 1959, and now it has been put into practice. This 
is certainly an achievement of Helmut Kohl. We have talked 
about postal reform for decades. Both reforms are important 
conditions for securing Germany's future, which have now finally 
been implemented. In the years in which I was able to work 
without potential outside influence, so to speak, the years 
1983-1989 -- we reduced state debts to almost 45 percent, 
created 3 million new jobs.... 
  [Wickert, interrupting] Still, Germany's debts have never 
been higher than they are now. 
  [Kohl] This is a classic journalistic claim, which is 
correct even though it is not the truth. 
  [Wickert] So what is it? 
  [Kohl] Just listen, I am going to explain it. First of all, 
one must look at the situation before we had German unity. 
Before it, we did, of course, reduce state debts. And without 
the policy we pursued between 1983 and 1989, we would not even 
have been able to make the current necessary investments in the 
new laender. Everything we are now investing in Saxony, Saxony 
Anhalt, and everywhere else is, of course, an investment in the 
future. Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, 
and Thuringia will be blossoming landscapes tomorrow or the day 
after tomorrow, which will most likely be of advantage for all 
of Germany. 
  [Wickert] Do you not regret the statement of the blossoming 
landscapes? 
  [Kohl] Not at all, because it is true. Excuse me, but why 
should I be sorry about that statement. Even today you can see 
in large parts of the new laender that things are truly 
developing in a positive way. What is true is that developments 
have taken place more slowly. I was wrong on this point, and I 
have admitted it. It is the number of years -- it does not 
matter whether I say four of five years. Still, Mr. Wickert, it 
is also part of the truth that when I was making that statement, 
I started from the assumption that, as the former GDR [German 
Democratic Republic] did, we would export goods to the Soviet 
Union worth 20-25 billion German marks [DM]. However, the 
Soviet Union has disappeared, has ceased to exist. And now we 
only export DM5 billion worth in goods, and with Hermes export 
guarantees, at that. 
  So I am maintaining this statement; one only has to add a 
few 
more years. But what difference does it make, whether it is 
four of five, or eight or 10 years? We have achieved Germany 
unity, freedom for all Germans -- and this is the real 
achievement. And nobody would like to turn back the clock, not 
even my severest critics would deny that we pursued the right 
course. 
  [Wickert] You have just mentioned the Soviet Union. You 
were on the telephone with Boris Yeltsin yesterday, and, I 
suppose, the main issue in your talks was Bosnia. The success 
of the ultimatum is obvious. Yet, now Germany also has to 
contribute its energy. Are you ready to exert your influence, 
particularly on the Croats? 
  [Kohl] What we have achieved so far has something to do with 
our influence, and, above all, with mine. I am happy that, for 
the first time -- I am not saying that it will be a success -- 
there is a real opportunity for achieving a peaceful solution. 
This would not have been possible without the contribution of 
the Russians. Now the Russians are there, and the Americans have 
committed themselves more than ever, and so have the French and 
British. Within the framework of our possibilities, among others 
within the European Community, we must also bring our influence 
to bear. And we must do it together with others. 
  I hope that, beyond Sarajevo, it will be possible to reach a 
plan for all of Bosnia, that means that other.... 
  [Wickert, interrupting] But that means to exert pressure. 
  [Kohl] Yes, and I am in favor of keeping up the pressure. 
Still, now I am starting from a vision that I hope will become 
reality, namely that, over the next few weeks and months, we 
will achieve a carefully worked out overall plan, with the 
parties to the conflict -- the Croats, Muslims, and Serbs -- and 
that the major powers will then guarantee, so to speak, what 
Boris Yeltsin and others have now suggested. For the first 
time, I can now see a real chance, which is why the pressure has 
to be maintained. Since we have a special relationship of 
confidence, it is our main duty to talk to the Muslims and 
Croats. After all, it is these two groups, in particular, that 
want the Germans to participate in the negotiations and help 
protect their interests. 
  [Wickert] It will probably take longer to solve the Bosnia 
problem than to conduct the election campaign: The election 
will be held in October. Some have already complained about the 
mudslinging. Are you ready to participate in that mudslinging? 
  [Kohl] I am not engaged in such mudslinging. You know, I 
would say that those who are actually engaged in mudslinging are 
those who complain most about it. I am not engaged in 
mudslinging. I am in favor of discussing concepts and ideas, and 
who is able to show the better path into the future. Still, if 
I talk about the future, I also have to talk about the present, 
and I cannot disconnect the present from the past. We are 
currently facing the challenge of filling concrete positions. 
And he who agrees to being a candidate for the office of 
federal president must accept questions regarding what he did in 
a crucial era of German history, namely the past few years, what 
he did regarding the relationship with our fellow citizens in 
what used to be the GDR. I am opposed to mudslinging. I am 
also against digging up Stasi files from early morning to night. 
The results are quite often detestable and disgusting, and I do 
not get any satisfaction from it.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with German Foreign Minister Klaus </F>
Kinkel by an unidentified correspondent; place not specified -- 
live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] What do you 
consider the most important result of yesterday's high-level 
meeting in Bonn? 
  [Kinkel] The most important result was that all of those 
with 
an interest in resolving this conflict were pulling 
together--Europeans, Russians, the United States, Canada, and 
the United Nations. We are using the momentum, and yesterday's 
talks gave a useful boost toward consolidating the position in 
and around Sarajevo, toward continuing deliveries of 
humanitarian aid to the people in need. Above all, we 
decided--and this will be implemented--to try and find solutions 
similar to what has been done for Sarajevo, in the form of a 
mosaic, for the other main trouble spots--such as in Bihac, 
Srebrenica, Mostar, Zepa, and Gorazde. There is still much to be 
done--too much. 
  [Correspondent] It has been possible to more or less lift 
the 
Bosnian Serbs' siege around Sarajevo with the undisguised threat 
of force, using NATO fighter aircraft in agreement with the 
United Nations. Is this necessary to stop the fighting around 
all the places you just named? 
  [Kinkel] Well, a political solution still has to come, first 
and foremost, as President Clinton said again yesterday. The 
conditions have been met for a peaceful political solution. I 
would not want to rule out that a similar approach could be 
adopted in individual cases in future, as has been the case 
here. This, however, must be considered very carefully. You 
have to be clear that what you threaten to do can actually be 
done in practice. For this reason, I would want to continue not 
with further threats but with looking for a political solution. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, several observers urge that 
Sarajevo--the successful NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian 
Serbs--could be a model for the solution of other regional 
conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Do you agree with that? 
  [Kinkel] Yes, it can be a recipe for success if you mean--as 
was demonstrated here--that the people who address this issue 
mean the combination of firmness and at the same time 
flexibility. It does not mean in the sense that I would 
automatically transfer the situation in Sarajevo to all the 
other places mentioned, to the six peace zones that were 
determined by the United Nations. I also spoke to Secretary 
General Woerner for a long time last night. We must not lose 
sight of the political process now, but we [words indistinct] so 
that it can and perhaps must be said loud and clear: this far 
and no further. We should not flog it to death unnecessarily, 
however, and give it too [word indistinct] in advance. 
  [Correspondent] You were just highlighting the agreement of 
the participants of the conference yesterday in the interest of 
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, one [words indistinct] 
was Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin, who said that 
successes of the Sarajevo experiment, as he called it, were not 
a model case and that a repeat of the NATO ultimatum for other 
areas was not an option. Is that not a setback for your efforts? 
  [Kinkel] No. You cannot say that. I had a long 
conversation with Mr. Churkin yesterday morning. He was quite 
decisively jointly responsible for the fact that the Serbian 
side could be won over for the withdrawal. The Russians never 
made a secret of the fact that they would not have liked to have 
seen the NATO ultimatum carried out, that they would not like to 
see it repeated, but that alone cannot be the deciding factor 
for NATO and the United Nations. I will say it again: We have 
to have the Russians on board, and we have the Russians on 
board. This is very, very important. As we have a certain 
influence on the Croats, for example, and a certain influence on 
the Muslims, the Serbs also have a specially good relationship 
with the Russian side. We have to use that. Russia is also a 
dimension, without which peace in former Yugoslavia will not be 
possible. It should not be the case, however, that someone from 
one side says certain things are ruled out or that a veto is 
imposed from the start. Nor do I think that this is Churkin's 
view or the view he expressed during the talks. He explained 
the Russian position, which is a little different from ours. As 
I said, however, the Russians are on board with us and are on 
board to a decisive degree. 
  [Correspondent] You mentioned at the start that your 
Croatian counterpart, Mate Granic, is coming to Bonn today. What 
will you be discussing with him? 
  [Kinkel] I will be discussing current developments with him, 
in order to advance the political process of finding a solution. 
The talks are under way and are based, as I said, on the 
European plan of action, which is [Alain] Juppe's and my own 
idea. The Americans have now become involved very actively in 
every respect. That was one of the reasons why the conditions 
for a solution have improved somewhat. We have to use the 
momentum. I will be discussing the state of the peace efforts 
with Mr. Granic, whereby it is particularly important to close 
the extremely wide gap between the Muslims and Croats because 
things have become bogged down given the hostile positions 
caused, in particular, after the attacks by the Muslims in 
central Bosnia against the Croats. This has to be overcome 
first. In addition, there are a host of questions that have to 
be discussed, such as Mostar, a question addressed particularly 
to the Croats and Muslims.... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] And where the Croats are the 
aggressors? 
  [Kinkel] I do not think you can say that at the moment. We 
have reached a situation where you cannot say in each case who 
attacked whom. I will put it this way, however: None of them 
are angels. The original act of aggression--and this should not 
be forgotten--came from the Serbs. 
  [Correspondent] The government in Zagreb is being accused of 
still supporting the Bosnian Croats with regular troops. Do you 
have any knowledge of this? 
  [Kinkel] I have been trying for weeks to verify this. I have 
not had any great success in this so far, and I am not the only 
one. I have asked the United Nations and our partners [words 
indistinct] for information. We know that a not inconsiderable 
number of volunteers are there. There are also reasonable 
grounds, however, for believing that at least Croatian troops 
were there. I have also--particularly in the light of our 
relatively good relationship with the Croatians--repeatedly 
called on them to withdraw their troops if they have any there. 
They say this is not the case. 
  They are aware of the Security Council resolution calling on 
them to withdraw their troops, but little has been heard of this 
recently because there is apparently no evidence of it. You also 
have to remember that if troops were there, they would not be 
wearing the uniform of the official Croatian Army and would not 
be easily recognizable or identifiable. I will ask Mr. Granic 
about this again, however, and I will call on him in the 
clearest possible terms to withdraw the troops if this is the 
case. 
  [Correspondent] Last question, Mr. Kinkel. As the 
high-ranking officials were discussing the situation in Bosnia 
yesterday, the Society for Threatened Peoples accused you--or 
rather the Foreign Ministry--of encouraging war crimes and mass 
deaths. I quote, [word indistinct] a type of euthanasia in 
Bosnia. They were referring among other things to the fact that 
there are evidently a number of Croat and Serb war criminals in 
Germany whose names are known. What is the Foreign Ministry 
doing in this regard? 
  [Kinkel] Well, this is an absurd accusation that I, of 
course, reject. Anyone should try and show me what documents we 
have in our possession, or what we have failed to pass on, or 
what we have suppressed. It is just absurd to accuse me, as a 
long-standing state secretary at the Justice Ministry and 
ex-justice minister, of not operating extremely precisely and 
painstakingly in every respect. It is repeatedly alleged that 
we received lists containing the whereabouts of Serbs who have 
committed crimes in Germany. I would like to see proof of this, 
and I would ask proof to be furnished when absurd claims such as 
this are made. I consider it so absurd that I do not want to go 
into it. By the way, all of the lists we have received--which 
do not refer to the residence in Germany of Serbs or other 
possible criminals--have, of course, been passed on to the 
international organizations that are responsible for 
investigating these matters. I was one of those who called 
loudest--successfully it now seems--for an international court 
of criminal justice to deal with these things. I will 
personally make sure we in Germany do everything possible.

  [Excerpts] What will France's policy on defense be for the 
next 20 years? There is a white paper out which reveals this, a 
kind of geostrategic manual containing some 150 pages, drafted 
by a commission chaired by Marceau Long. Edouard Balladur and 
his defense minister, Francois Leotard, presented it to the 
National Assembly and Senate defense commissions today before 
revealing its content to the media. Jean-Michel Blier: 
  [Blier] It is a document made necessary by developments in 
the geostrategic context: the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 
splitting apart of the Warsaw Pact profoundly changed the nature 
of the threats. At the same time the upsurge of nationalism in 
several countries has brought about the appearance of conflicts 
of a new kind, and the former Yugoslavia is an example of this. 
What response, what means, what alliances should be implemented 
in view of this new situation? This is the subject of this 
white paper, which, compelled by the requirements of 
cohabitation, has been the subject of lengthy discussions with 
the Elysee [presidential office]. The document which was 
presented this afternoon should not affect the consensus, except 
on one point, the suspension of nuclear testing, which Francois 
Mitterrand has made a question of principle, and which is being 
maintained. 
  Francois Leotard said clearly this evening that he, 
personally, was in favor of resuming testing, while at the same 
time acknowledging that for the immediate future the credibility 
of our deterrent was not in any way thrown into doubt. [passage 
omitted] This is Jean-Michel Blier at the Senate for France 
Inter. 
  [Announcer] Jean-Michel Blier has just been talking to us 
about it. Let's now listen to Francois Leotard on this subject 
of whether or not to resume nuclear testing: 
  [Begin Leotard recording] For 30 or so years now France has 
implemented with great persistence a nuclear policy which means 
that today it is the only, or nearly the only, one in Europe to 
possess a nuclear force which is produced by itself, produced 
for itself, and produced according to its own needs. It would 
be a pity to abandon a 30-year effort, and thus in order to 
ensure that this force responds to the requirements of the 
future, in other words the beginning of the third millenium, its 
suitability must be strengthened. At this time this force is in 
no way, and I repeat in no way, threatened by the moratorium on 
nuclear testing, I stress in no way affected. It is completely 
effective, it is completely credible, it is completely 
appropriate, and for a long time to come. [end recording]

Italian Foreign Minister Andreatta, Mate Granic was told that 
Italy is willing to help in the process of seeking solutions. 
Minister Andreatta -- who is very familiar with the situation 
-- expressed satisfaction with the fact that Italy is involved. 
He told Minister Granic that Italy has a great deal of 
understanding for Croatia's position. The talks resulted in the 
realization that relations between Croatia and Italy are being 
advanced to a great extent and that Italy can exercise a 
positive influence in the process of seeking solutions. The two 
ministers talked extensively over a working lunch. The Croatian 
side assesses the talks as cordial and very fruitful. 
  Minister Granic and Ambassadors Rudolf and Livljanic talked 
early this evening with Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, the 
Vatican's state secretary. The sixth meeting between the two 
politicians took place in a very cordial atmosphere. The Holy 
See is following developments on the ground with great interest 
as well as the diplomatic process for resolving the crisis. It 
is paying particular attention to the agreement between Generals 
Roso and Delic. In the Vatican there are reports that this 
agreement has a good chance of success. 
  The Holy See reiterated its opinion that a solution to the 
crisis should certainly be found, and also that agreement should 
be reached between the Croats and Muslims. The pope will be 
informed about the talks. Minister Granic has handed over 
President Tudjman's message to the pope. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report from Rome by Silvije Tomasevic, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA </F>
correspondent, for Croatian radio] 
  [Text] The NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs has been an 
absolute success, and now the question arises of how to prevent 
further conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina and resume peace 
negotiations, Croatian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mate Granic 
told us this afternoon following his talks with Italian Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Andreatta and the Holy See State Secretary 
Jean- Louis Tauran. It has been concluded that the key to peace 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina can be found through the Croat-Muslim 
agreement [as heard]. Americans, Germans, and Italians are 
involved in the search for that key. 
  Minister Granic told us that he came to Rome today in order 
to clarify the Croatian standpoint regarding the creation of a 
Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There are some 
differences as regards the set-up of the future 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, Granic told us that the Croatian 
position was met with understanding by the Italian side. 
Croatia's view of Italy's importance in the negotiations is 
positive, Granic told us. 
  In reference to his talks with Tauran, he said that the Holy 
See assessed as positive the fact that Croatia has accepted the 
Vatican's suggestions.

<F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "Deryabin: The Peace Treaty Can </F>
Be Discussed"] 
  [Text] Russia's ambassador in Helsinki, Yuriy Deryabin, 
said that it could be a good idea to scrutinize the contents of 
the Paris Treaty. Deryabin urges a debate on the peace treaty 
and on relations between Finland and Russia in two newspaper 
interviews. 
  The Russian ambassador was interview by SUOMEN KUVALEHTI on 
Friday [18 February] and ILTALEHTI on Saturday. 
  In SUOMEN KUVALEHTI Deryabin said that there is no reason to 
depart from the peace treaty of 1949. He also stressed that the 
Russian government has no proposals for changes preapared. 
Deryabin was expressing his own personal view. 
  He also said that Russia is currently looking at Finland's 
response to the note about the two organizations, IKL [National 
Patriotic League] and Suur-Suomi [Greater Finland]. 
  It is Deryabin's view that some sort of psychological 
problem 
is currently disturbing relations between Finland and Russia. 
It seems as if people in Finland do not trust Russia. 
  Of the EU [European Union] negotiations Deryabin said that 
membership could bring with it certain legal problems with 
regard to Aland's demilitarized status. Aland's position is 
defined in the Paris agreement. Deryabin does not think that 
membership will have a negative effect on relations between 
Finland and Russia. He said that special arrangements for trade 
between Russia and Finland are possible. 
  But Deryabin does not want to see Finland as a member of 
NATO. An enlargement of NATO in such a way that Russia is left 
outside would mean that Russia would be isolated, "with all the 
consequences this brings with it, including those in the field 
of domestic politics." 
  For countries which are worried about their security 
Deryabin 
proposed some other alternative -- security guarantees from NATO 
and Russia, for example. 
  In the interview in ILTALEHTI Deryabin stressed that if the 
Paris peace treaty is changed, Britain should also be consulted. 
Like the Soviet Union Britain enjoys a special position under 
the terms of the treaty. When the debate about the note flared 
up, Deryabin also had discussions with the British ambassador in 
Helsinki. 
  According to Deryabin, Russia approves the unilateral 
interpretation of paragraph III of the treaty which Finland made 
in 1990 according to which Finland may acquire more defense 
materiel than the peace treaty actually permits. 
  In ILTALEHTI Deryabin justified the note about the two 
organizations with the argument that "major events often start 
off as minor events" and referred, for example, to the new 
right-wing extremist parties that have been founded in Germany 
and Sweden. 
  In the Paris Treaty of 1947 the popular patriotic IKL 
movement, civic guard organizations 
[skyddskaarorganisationerna], and women's voluntary defense 
services were banned. Deryabin stressed that his questions only 
relate to the IKL.

  [Text] Late tonight, the European Union's [EU] special 
envoy Commissioner Hans van den Broek met Greek Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou in Maximos Palace. Van den Broek briefed 
Prime Minister Papandreou on his contacts in Skopje, where he 
will return tomorrow before going back to Brussels. 
Correspondent Konstandinos Dhimtsas has the following report 
from Maximos Palace. 
  [Begin Dhimtsas recording] EU Commissioner Van den Broek 
will 
have a new meeting with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias 
at the Foreign Ministry tomorrow as the most important EU 
initiative on Skopje unfolds. The EU commissioner reportedly 
told the prime minister that in Skopje he found a climate of 
goodwill to resume the dialogue with Greece under the auspices 
of the United Nations. He also presented a letter from Gligorov 
to Papandreou. 
  The main points of Gligorov's letter are: Skopje seeks a 
dialogue on all the issues on the foreign ministerial level in a 
third country under UN auspices. If Greece does not revoke the 
sanctions against Skopje, Gligorov said, his country will file 
an appeal to the UN Security Council and the CSCE. 
  In a statement, Foreign Minister Papoulias described 
Commissioner Van den Broek's effort as positive. We hope, he 
said, that it will continue. The EU commissioner said the EU is 
in full agreement with Greece and Gligorov agrees that good 
neighborly relations are essential for the survival of his 
statelet. Prime Minister Papandreou's reply to EU Commission 
President Jacques Delors is being drawn up in the prime 
minister's office. In his letter, the prime minister will 
support that taking counter measures against Skopje is a 
political issue. The letter will also stress that the measures 
that concern the national sovereignty, history, and security of 
our country cannot be seen as issues of customs or trade. 
Papandreou will also outline legal arguments stressing that 
Greece's decision does not violate international or EU law and 
will recall that Greece has signed no accord on surrounding 
states. [end recording]

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 24 (AFP) -- The Islamic Conference 
Organization [ICO] alled on NATO Thursday [24 February] to 
extend its threat of airstrikes to other regions of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to secure a ceasefire there. 
  ICO Secretary General Hamid Algabid warned officials of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization of the "urgent necessity of 
reopening the airport at Tuzla which provides a vital route for 
the supply of humanitarian aid to the stricken populations," the 
organisation said in a statement issued here. 
  NATO has indicated that it would be "premature" to seek to 
apply the Sarajevo ultimatum -- in which besieging Serbs were 
ordered to withdraw their heavy weapons or face airstrikes -- to 
other besieged areas of Bosnia. 
  The ICO expressed its concern at the deployment of Russian 
peacekeepers in Sarajevo, the statement said. 
  It noted that the 51 member nations of the ICO were also 
willing to send troops to serve with the UN Protection Force in 
former Yugoslavia. 
  Algabid "urged NATO to maintain its pressure on the Serbs 
until they ceased their aggression and a fair peace is 
established over the whole of Bosnian territory and in the 
sub-region," the statement added.

  [Text] In Geneva, India has urged friendly countries at the 
ongoing session of the UN Human Rights Commission to give up 
their neutral stance on the Kashmir issue and come out openly 
against Pakistan's state-sponsored terrorism in Jammu and 
Kashmir. The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman 
Khurshid, told the heads of various delegations in informal 
meetings in Geneva that abstaining in the event of a voting on 
the Pakistan-proposed resolution on Kashmir will undermine the 
very concept of human rights and will encourage Islamabad's 
involvement in terrorism. Talking to Indian reporters, Mr. 
Khurshid said New Delhi expects a categorical rejection of the 
resolution.

<F P=106> [Patrick Marx report: "GATT: Aeronautics Back on the </F>
Scene"] 
  [Text] Jean Pierson, managing director of Airbus Industrie, 
feels that the American attitude toward the Saudi contract 
proves that, in their view, "GATT is just a piece of paper," 
valid only "for other people." Aerospatiale Director Louis 
Gallois feels that American political pressure should ecourage 
Europeans to examine this very revolutionary way in selling 
airplanes. 
  In effect, the Saudi contract revives the U.S.-European 
dispute about international trade in airliners, an issue that 
was not resolved during the recent marathon of GATT 
negotiations, since the United States preferred not to make any 
conclusions on this point until they could find a chink in the 
armor of European defenses. It refused to include the 1992 
agreement as one of the exceptions to the GATT general rules, 
and it is still seeking to limit Airbus influence in the world 
while attacking the consortium for the reimbursable advances 
which its industrial partners receive from the four countries 
involved in the the project (France, Germany, Great Britain, and 
Spain). At the same time the United States defends tooth and 
nail their own system of indirect support through military 
research programs which lead to civilian spin-offs. 
  It was hoped that the agreement reached in 1992 between 
Washington and Brussels on direct and indirect public aid to the 
civilian aviation industry would calm moods. The Saudi affair 
shows that this is simply not the case. By referring to GATT, 
the leaders of the European aeronautics industry are baulking at 
Washington's argument, because Article 4 of the text concerning 
the trade in airliners expressly states that "the signatories 
shall refrain from subjecting airlines (...) to excessive 
pressure for the purpose of buying civilian aircraft of a given 
origin, which would entail discrimination against suppliers from 
another signatory." 
  By announcing the signature of the Saudi contract, Bill 
Clinton provided the Europeans with a weighty argument during 
the negotiations on the aeronautics section of GATT which are to 
enter a crucial phase this year.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 24 (AFP) -- GATT tariff-cutting offers 
made by the European Union on Wednesday [23 February] are 
conditional upon other countries sticking to their tariff 
commitments, an EU spokesman warned here Thursday. 
  EU officials said only 22 of 116 countries involved in the 
Uruguay Round of GATT trade talks had submitted their final 
tariff-cutting offers, which were supposed to reach the GATT 
secretariat by February 15. 
  Member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade agreed last December 15 on the principle of significant 
cuts in import tariffs under the Uruguay Round, which is due to 
be signed formally in Marrakesh on April 15. 
  The GATT members were supposed to translate their general 
tariff-cutting commitments into detailed product-by-product 
reductions. The EU has done so but many other countries have not. 
  The EU spokesman said: "Our offers are based on the 
condition 
that the offers of the other parties are not diminished from 
what was approved on December 15 in Geneva." 
  EU officials say they are worried by Washington's apparent 
intention to reduce U.S. offers -- notably for utility vehicles, 
electronics and non-ferrous metals -- in reprisal against 
Japan's refusal to increase imports of U.S. goods. 
  They have warned that the Union might reduce its own tariff 
offers if it is disadvantaged by any shrinking in cuts offered 
by other countries.

<F P=106> [Report signed "ga": "Brussels Helps Medium-Sized </F>
Enterprises Gain Footing in Japan"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- Under the name Gateway to Japan, the 
European Union [EU] has begun a three-year campaign in Tokyo to 
support small- and medium-sized European enterprises from nine 
competitive industrial branches that are underrepresented in 
Japan in order to expand their business activities. 
  In the first stage (1994-1995), the business sectors 
concerned are machine-tool building, material motion technology, 
furniture, and medical technology. In the second stage 
(1995-1996), they are presumably ship's equipment, building 
machines and equipment, packaging machines, and waste-treatment 
technology. The budget for the whole project is about 14 
million German marks. 
  Seminars for enterprises in these fields are being organized 
and planned in Europe in May and June this year and next year. 
As a second step, the joint participation of a selected group 
of enterprises in Japanese trade fairs will be organized, that 
is, the Logis-Tech (material motion technology/logistics), which 
is taking place now, the JIMTOF [expansion not given] 
machine-tool fair this autumn, the Jetro Health Care in March 
1995, and the Japan Pack, the Japan Home Show, the New Earth, 
and the International Furniture Fair from October to December 
1995. As a third step, follow-up visits to Japan will be 
organized for the enterprises within the framework of this 
project about half a year after each respective trade fair. 
  The basic costs of participation in the fairs and the 
visits, 
the publication of brochures and catalogues, the organization of 
receptions, news conferences, and seminars, the rent for stands, 
and the costs of the decoration of stands will be paid by the EU 
project budget. The participating enterprises, however, will 
have to pay for travel and accommodation themselves. 
  The implementation of the whole project is in the hands of 
the Association of European Chambers of Commerce (Eurochambers), 
while the enterprises that are to be supported are selected by 
national coordinators in cooperation with the consultants Roland 
Berger GmbH, which belong to the Deutsche Bank Group. On the 
Japanese side, the EU initiative is supported in particular by 
the Economics Ministry (Miti) and its foreign trade 
organization, Jetro.

  [Text] Brussels -- Europe is not completely blind to Asia, 
but it needs more active East Asian policies. European 
companies must go and get involved in the region, according to 
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC foreign trade commissioner. 
  Last year the EC had more trade with the countries in East 
Asia (previously the Far East) than with North America. By the 
turn of the century China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan will be 
economically more powerful than the United States alone or 
Germany and Japan together. They will also export more than 
Japan and Germany do at present. 
  "Estimates such as these will mean that every analysis of a 
threefold division of world trade between the EU, the United 
States and Japan will quickly disappear into second-hand 
bookshops," Sir Leon said on Thursday [17 February] evening in 
London, in what he himself had announced in advance as a "major 
policy speech." 
  Brittan also warned that the same dynamic could destabilize 
East Asia with "potentially catastrophic and far-reaching 
consequences." North Korea is still subject to a regime which 
plays "nuclear poker" and China is facing rapidly increasing 
economic diversity and "decreasing centralized power," according 
to Brittan, who is to visit the People's Republic next week. 
  According to the British EC commissioner, Europe has much to 
offer East Asia. But he warned that Asia's supposed dependence 
on Europe for capital and know-how, or in order to 
counterbalance Japan and the United States, would soon "be 
entirely a question of historical interest." East Asia has its 
own capital and developed technological resources. 
  One European advantage is that it has no political ambitions 
in the region, Brittan said. In Asia, Europe has a lead in 
sectors like transport infrastructure, telecommunications, 
aviation, oil, gas and environmental technology and service 
sectors such as banking and insurance. 
  Brittan said "the multilateral framework" for doing business 
with the region was important. He hoped that China, with its 
unprecedented economic perspectives, could joint GATT this year. 
"If the whole of East Asia is represented in the multilateral 
trade system, then economic relations would be easier because we 
would all speak the same language and apply the same rules," 
Brittan said. 
  But he does not want to subordinate that goal to the content 
of the entry negotiations. The EU is setting the following 
conditions for Peking's membership of GATT: further opening of 
Chinese markets, an import tariff ceiling of between 15 and 25 
percent, further liberalization of exchange rates, and the right 
to carry out foreign trade and invest. 
  Brittan also warned the East Asian community in advance that 
the West was determined to "discuss" trade in relation to 
environmental demands, fair competition and social conditions. 
These should be "an integral part of the Community's policies 
for the region," Brittan said. 
  He wants to give industry prime responsibility for the 
relations between the EC and East Asia. The Commission will 
negotiate in the GATT framework but beyond that its role will be 
limited to "helping companies help themselves." That means 
export support and the provision of information on a European 
scale. The BBC has been asked to make recommendations on 
cleaning up Europe's "poor image" in Asia.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Jurgen Storbeck, German "caretaker </F>
co-ordinator" of Europol by Isabel Conway; place and date not 
given: "Like All Tigers, It Needs Its Teeth"--quotation marks as 
published] 
  [Text] It is, say its critics, in the wrong place, and 
with the wrong brief. It has no legal identity, no agreed 
budget, and no executive powers. But, according to Jurgen 
Storbeck, German caretaker co-ordinator of Europol, the European 
Drugs Intelligence Unit, it's going to work. 
  The official launch this month of Europol, in a leafy Hague 
suburb with a residence for Jesuit priests on one side and a 
high-school playground on the other, was more an act of faith 
than a warning to international drugs traders. 
  But Storbeck believes it can still justify its existence as 
a 
symbol of Europe's yearning for a common security policy. "A 
lot will depend on the leeway we are given by justice and other 
European Union ministers, who will ultimately decide where 
Europol is going at their convention later this year," maintains 
Storbeck. 
  His biggest fear, he told The European, is of 
"over-restrictive rules and regulations" which would "take the 
teeth out of the mouth of the tiger before he was even grown 
from a cub." 
  Storbeck's vision is of a strongly federalist Europol drugs 
unit with a wide brief so that "international task forces under 
the authority of member states, but supported by Europol, could 
be formed to fight drug trafficking, money laundering and other 
investigations into organised crime. "I believe that in time 
the politicians will agree to a much more federal role for 
Europol. It might have been unthinkable ten years ago, but 
drugs and other forms of crime are creating such major problems 
now that this will in time be seen as essential," says Storbeck, 
an Interpol veteran. 
  Storbeck recognises that Europol is facing weighty 
bureaucratic and technical obstacles, not least of which is its 
"cart before the horse" status. 
  It does not have a legal identity yet and depends on a maze 
of national and bilateral agreements and goodwill rather than 
the compulsory sharing of intelligence between its partners. It 
cannot prove itself until a draft treaty setting out its powers 
and duties is drawn up, agreed and ratified by the 12 states in 
October. Its non-executive nature means that Europol cannot 
establish a formal relationship with Interpol and other key 
crime-fighting organisations or look to a future crime-busting 
role beyond its current limited horizons. 
  The only employees so far are the skeleton staff of 19 
liaison officers seconded from the 12 member states spread out 
around the huge building which once housed the Dutch 
Intelligence service. Contacts with their own national police 
force are maintained by telephone and fax, although some 
countries expect computer access to their national criminal 
files shortly. 
  Recruitment of Europol's administrative staff and the 
provision of the required 24-hour ring of steel depends on the 
member states eventually agreeing on a budget. Getting the unit 
running will cost in the region of 35 million guilders ($18m), 
according to Europol chiefs. The available budget of 4 million 
guilders this year falls far short of that. 
  Storbeck claims that Europol is already proving that it can 
offer a "much faster service" than Interpol. Even without 
executive powers, the liaison officers (by the year's end 50 
will be based in The Hague) are demonstrating the commitment of 
member states to co-operate fully with each other's requests for 
help in co-ordinating information and eventually developing an 
intelligence network, he reports. 
  Storbeck says: "I would like it to be obligatory for member 
states to assist each other in gathering information and 
swapping intelligence within the new structure. But that is for 
the politicians to decide."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Letter Bombs: `Hot Scent' Leads to </F>
German Bomb Maker"] 
  [Text] According to Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak, the 
police have now discovered a promising clue about the person who 
made the letter bombs. The suspect lives in Germany, belongs to 
the extreme-right scene, and possibly assembled the fiendish 
envelopes while on a visit to Austria. 
  The Wiesbaden Federal Office of Criminal Investigation 
searched the suspect's apartment in Germany with "interesting 
results." 
  Further investigations are in progress, but the man has not 
been arrested. No further details were reported because of the 
news blackout. 
  Commenting on Peter Binder and Franz Radl junior, who are 
imprisoned in Vienna, Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak said 
that there are 25 pieces of evidence in their case. Moreover, 
there are two witnesses who have incriminated the two neo-Nazis. 
  According to Loeschnak, all in all, this incriminating 
material should be sufficient to bring charges in a few weeks -- 
charges "that will stand." 
  Regarding the new "hot scent" leading to Germany, the police 
assume that this right-wing extremist might have made the letter 
bombs during a visit to Austria.

<F P=106> [Peter Michielsen report on interview with FYROM Foreign </F>
Trade Minister Stevo Crvenkovski in The Hague; date not given: 
"`If we Survive This, We Will Survive Anything'"] 
  [Text] The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] is 
stuck between two embargoes: First, the UN embargo against its 
northern neighbor, the former Yugoslavia, which used to account 
for 70 percent of its trade and now contributes nothing. And 
now, there is the recent Greek boycott, which is costing FYROM 
another 70 percent of its trade. But Foreign Trade Minister 
Stevo Crvenkovski remains optimistic. 
  The FYROM Foreign Trade Minister Stevo Crvenkovski, who was 
in the Netherlands for a brief visit, said he still did not know 
why Greece had chosen this moment to restart its boycott of 
FYROM which ended last year. "We have not provoked them," he 
said. In fact, Greece has made it very clear why they want to 
close off FYROM from the outside world at this particular time. 
The measures, Greek Trade Minister Simitis said last week, were 
"a necessary consequence of the premature recognition" of FYROM 
by the entire international community, including EU [European 
Union] countries and the United States. 
  The recognition has irritated the Greeks because they feel, 
as they have done since 1991 when their northern neighbor became 
independent, that FYROM should change its name, flag, and 
constitution. Because the name and constitution contain 
implicit territorial claims on the Greek province of Macedonia 
and the flag still contains a Greek symbol, the Star of Vergina, 
it is therefore "a provocation." Athens wants to talk about 
bilateral relations only when FYROM has met these conditions. 
  The solidarity from abroad has not yet helped FYROM: Greece 
is holding firm. Nor will the visit by European Commissioner 
Hans van den Broek to Skopje and Athens today and tomorrow 
produce much, because "Van den Broek is not mediating," 
Crvenkovski said. "Our talks with him will be limited to trade 
relations with the EU only." 
  Therefore FYROM must reckon with an economic blockade which 
will last some time and could have dramatic consequences. No 
trade is possible with its northern neighbor, the former 
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), because of the UN embargo. 
Trading with FYROM's other neighbors, Albania and Bulgaria, is 
difficult, because there are no rail links with these countries 
and, as Crvenkovski said, "the road links are bad, they are 
fully used and are completely jammed." Therefore FYROM is 
isolated economically by the Greek decision. 
  "It is one disaster after another," Crvenkovksi said. "The 
embargo against Yugoslavia has cost us US$3 billion, according 
to international estimates. The EU has promised us US$120 
million compensation but that has only been given in part and 
what still gets through has to come via Greece, therefore that 
too is at a standstill. We have suffered relatively more damage 
than the rest of Yugoslavia's neighbors: They have lost 5-10 
percent of their foreign trade, we have lost 60-70 percent." 
  Add to that the fact that FYROM was already poor, that it is 
in the middle of economic restructuring, that it is groaning 
under the strict conditions of an IMF stabilization program, and 
that last year it was hit by the worst drought in 50 years. It 
was clear that the Greek measure, to put it mildly, came at a 
very bad time, he said. "In a normal situation the closure of 
the southern border by the Greeks would have been a big, but not 
extreme problem," he said. "However, now it is an extreme 
problem. There is no alternative to the route through Greece." 
  He went to Albania himself last week, he said, and Tirana is 
offering full cooperation but can do little in practice. 
Bulgaria is offering FYROM the harbor of Boergas as an 
alternative to Thessaloniki but this "good gesture" does not 
mean much, because "the harbor is not the problem, but the 
roads, the connections." No, he said, the best thing was to 
talk to the Greeks, but they did not want to. "Talks continued 
until last April," he said. "Then the Greeks asked to suspend 
them because of their elections. The talks were never 
restarted. As far as we are concerned we have not finished 
discussing; we are ready to talk again at any moment." 
  But Crvenkovski would hear nothing of prior conditions, as 
demanded by Greece. "After all it is impossible to negotiate 
about any subject whatsoever without a negotiating process," he 
said. It was clear in advance that FYROM has no territorial 
claims on any of its neighbors. "But we have always said that," 
he added. 
  FYROM, closed off as it is, will only be able to defend 
itself against Greek surprise attacks in the long term. With 
international aid, work is continuing on an East-West link, a 
Transbalkan road, railroad and communication networks which are 
to link FYROM to the world -- Italy and Turkey -- via Albania 
and Bulgaria. However, that is a question of years and in the 
meantime the whole of the FYROM economy could be run down. 
There were already social and ethnic tensions in FYROM, 
Crvenkovski said. "As experience shows, they grow as economic 
conditions worsen," he said. "No economy in the world is able 
to survive complete isolation from its normal markets." 
  This does not stop the minister from remaining optimistic. 
"The FYROM economy is stronger than during the previous Greek 
boycott," he said. "We have been independent for three years 
now. We are better organized. We have state institutions. 
There is a functioning system." In the meantime 50,000 private 
companies have been set up in FYROM, he said. "If two-thirds go 
bankrupt, one third will still remain, with which we can 
continue. We have already gone through a lot. The fact that we 
have survived these blows during these three years illustrates 
the vitality of our economy. If we survive this, we will 
survive anything. Then there will be every reason for optimism."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans by Pierre </F>
Petit and Jan Warners in The Hague; date not given: "The Hard 
Approach Has Worked"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- Around Sarajevo the heavy weapons of 
the Bosnian Serbs have now been placed under UN supervision. 
The NATO ultimatum worked. Minister Pieter Kooijmans, aged 60, 
who has always called for a hard approach, should be satisfied. 
  [Kooijmans] Yes, but a victory must be followed up, 
otherwise 
it becomes a Pyrrhic victory. I am happy that a decision was 
taken -- albeit too late -- to make the show of strength that 
was required to bring an end to a situation that had become 
untenable. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] The NATO ultimatum proved effective for 
Sarajevo. Does it not now follow that all resolutions adopted 
by the UN Security Council can be enforced by applying pressure? 
  [Kooijmans] That pressure has already been vented. It has 
been asked why, in the NATO declaration imposing the ultimatum, 
Tuzla and the change in Srebrenica and Zepa were not mentioned. 
  My answer to that is simple. It had already been done: At 
the NATO summit held in Brussels on 10 January. We would have 
lost our credibility if we had repeated it again. Because the 
outside world would then wonder why we were doing the same thing 
again. That is why there is a willingness to use air support, 
if necessary, to achieve two objectives -- opening up the 
airfield at Tuzla, and changing the guard in Srebrenica and Zepa. 
  Furthermore, the UN secretary general has empowered his 
representative in Yugoslavia to request NATO support if 
necessary. So therein, too, lies a forceful argument. 
  The second question is whether an ultimatum has to be 
imposed 
each time. That argument is used to achieve specific political 
objectives. If they can be achieved through consultation, then 
it has worked. 
  When I read now that the opening of the airfield at Tuzla is 
up for discussion with the Serbs -- a prospect that appeared to 
be totally out of the question in the talks we had on 22 
December -- then I think that the statement made by the summit 
on 10 January was not without some effect. 
  As long as we can still reach our objective through 
negotiations, that path must be followed in the hope that 
following the ultimatum for Sarajewo, the other parties will 
definitely feel the same determination and resolve regarding 
Tuzla. 
  Many barriers that were definitely there before -- who will 
ultimately request air support, must there be a separate 
deicisionmaking procedure within NATO? -- have now been 
eliminated. So the path has become a lot shorter. Naturally, 
that has a far more convincing effect. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] But if the UN objective cannot be 
achieved 
at the negotiating table, you can then say: Do we not need to 
impose any more ultimatums? 
  [Kooijmans] You will not hear me saying that. Rather, on 
each occasion you have to consider whether or not to impose an 
ultimatum, depending on the actual situation. If you resort to 
that option too quickly, then the weapon becomes blunt. 
  So inventiveness is required. No two situations are 
comparable. Take Mostar. I am in favor of declaring that city a 
safe area, but first there must exist a legal basis on which 
that can be done. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] Is the Security Council working on that? 
  [Kooijmans] Tonight there will be a meeting of the UN 
Security Council at which the subject of Mostar will feature on 
the agenda at the request of France. Theoretically, an annex on 
Mostar could be appended to Resolution 836 which lists the safe 
areas. 
  However, the situation in Mostar is different. The artillery 
positions do not encircle the city. The mortars are located in 
the city. So we have to develop a different campaign there. 
That is something we are currently looking into. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] For several weeks now, the United States 
has been a player in the diplomatic game, as have the Russians 
since one week ago. The divided Europe that let Lord Owen carry 
on messing around at the negotiating table for months on end has 
now gathered around itself some players with more decisiveness. 
Must Owen now be replaced? 
  [Kooijmans] The whole context has changed, which is 
something 
I do not regret. I, myself, wrote to my U.S. colleague, Warren 
Christopher, asking whether he wanted to become more closely 
involved in the peace process -- even the French have pressed 
for the same thing. 
  In the new context, no UN or European Union representative 
is 
needed any longer as a negotiator. The United States is also 
actively involved, as is -- surprisingly enough -- Russia. I do 
not know how things should be worked out further. 
  My impression is that the United States is busy implementing 
its own exploratory trip in an endeavour to find out what it 
feels constitutes the best approach. In the first instance, 
that approach would seem to concentrate on reconciling the 
Croats and the Muslims. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] What do you expect to emerge from 
Russian involvement in the peace process? 
  [Kooijmans] So far, Russia has not been in any position to 
participate actively in the peace process. On the other hand, 
it is not in the Russian interest for the ulcer currently 
threatening stability throughout the whole of Europe to be 
allowed to merely continue festering away. After the imposition 
of the ultimatum, Russia felt obliged to play a more active 
role. They had the choice between a confrontation with the West 
-- according to them the ultimatum should never have been 
allowed to be imposed because it supposedly contravenes the UN 
Charter -- and taking a leap into the deep end by trying to make 
the best of things by fully exploiting their contacts with the 
Serbs. Fortunately for the people of Sarajevo this resulted in 
the heavy weapons being withdrawn, placed under UN supervision, 
or neutralized. 
  The thorniest problem remaining is to find an international 
solution for Sarajevo. The city can be placed under UN 
administration. That would require a UN Security Council 
resolution to that effect. However, the main thing is that it 
remains the capital of Bosnia. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] But should Owen now be replaced? 
  [Kooijmans] Let me put it like this: It is quite easy to 
send the messenger away, but that changes nothing regarding the 
contents of his message. Of course, the criticism focuses on 
the messenger. What one has to do is consider whether one can 
still work functionally now that the context has changed -- 
Geneva in another guise. The person best placed to judge this 
is Lord Owen himself. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] Has Europe frittered away a great deal of 
credibility over the last two years? 
  [Kooijmans] For a very long time now, Europe has called for 
greater involvement on the part of the United States. Perhaps 
we misjudged the situation when the United States said that 
Yugoslavia is a European problem that Europe must resolve itself. 
  When Prime Minister Lubbers and I were in Washington, we 
said 
we thought that view was wrong. Stability in Europe is just as 
much of a U.S. as a European interest. The United States has 
100,000 troops stationed on European territory. Now I do not 
mean to intimate that President Clinton directly replied "Oh 
yes, well, I was wrong to see things that way." However, it is 
pleasing to see such a message getting across. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] And yet, is the commitment shown by the 
United States and Russia now complicating matters or rather 
clearing them up? Because Owen is, or was, the very 
personification of European discord? 
  [Kooijmans] You must not forget that a Russian 
representative 
was there at the request of the European Union. Because the 
Russians may be expected to actively influence the Serbs. The 
Serbs do not have that many friends in the Western camp who can 
exert credible pressure on them. 
  If the Russians feel forced to play a more active role by 
the 
run of events, so much the better. Because if they commit 
themselves to the peace process they are the ones who can 
exercise the necessary influence on Belgrade, and via Belgrade 
on Pale (the site of the headquarters of the bosnian Serbs -- 
ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD editor's note). 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] Do you believe that if hostilities cease 
the West may in the end acquiesce to an ethnic division of 
Bosnia? 
  [Kooijmans] I find that question so frightfully difficult to 
answer here behind my desk in The Hague. I have also asked the 
Bosnians, and President Izetbegovic, who must really abhor such 
a prospect, the same question. 
  And they replied that they do not want to regard whatever 
remains of Bosnia, ultimately as a Muslim state. Bosnia is a 
multicultural state, they say, just look at our army and our 
administration. On the other hand, they also say that it will 
be extremely difficult in the near future to build up a society 
in which people who have subjected each other to all manner of 
things that we would until recently have viewed as impossible 
can be considered members of a single integrated association of 
states building up something together. 
  [ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD] You sometimes get the feeling that 
certain 
Western governments, including the British and Greek 
Governments, think: Let the war in the Balkans just blaze away, 
because in the years to come it will be even worse if an Islamic 
entity starts acting up in the Balkans. 
  [Kooijmans] That is why I find it so important to stick by 
Izetbegovic's claim that Bosnia is not an Islamic state, but 
rather a multicultural society where everyone is welcome. 
  However, I do believe that the Western countries are less 
fearful of an Islamic state than of being drawn into the 
conflict, falling victim to the so-called Vietnam syndrome in 
the United States and the Northern Ireland syndrome in the 
United Kingdom.

  [Text] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated 
that other countries should not be concerned by Turkey's 
interest in sending troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Cetin, at The 
Hague as the official guest of the Dutch Foreign Minister Peter 
Kooijmans, concluded todays' contacts. 
  TRT correspondent Ihsan Gunal reports from The Hague: 
  [Begin recording] Following the official meetings, Cetin 
answered reporters' questions and said that Turkey wants to send 
troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to have peace established 
there as soon as possible. Indicating that there are rumors as 
to Turkish troops should not be sent because one of the parties 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina might object, Cetin pointed out that in 
spite of the Bosnians' objections, certain countries' troops are 
still being sent to the region, noting that this constitutes a 
double standard. Stressing that Holland also shares Turkey's 
views on this issue, Cetin indicated that the Dutch believe that 
fresh military forces are needed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that 
they should be reinforced. 
  Cetin also explained that during the official meetings he 
briefed the Dutch delegation on the terrorism and human rights 
issue in Turkey. Stating that the Netherlands -- in keeping 
with its legislation -- cannot ban terrorist organizations, 
Cetin added that nevertheless it will continue to prohibit 
terrorist activities adding that the Netherlands finds Turkey's 
fight against terrorism justified. 
  In answer to a reporter's question, Cetin explained that 
Greece's closing the Thessaloniki port to Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] exacerbates the crisis 
in the Balkans. Stressing that this move should not have been 
perpetrated, Cetin said that, if necessary, Turkey will extend 
all kinds of help to the FYROM via Varna. [end recording]

  [Text] The Hague, Feb 24 (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin on Thursday [24 February] said that Turkey is in a 
position to influence the solution of the Bosnia problem, adding 
he "sees no reason why Turkish soldiers would not go where the 
Russian soldiers went." 
  Currently in The Hague on an official visit and addressing a 
group of foreign reporters, Cetin said Turkey has sent troops to 
Korea and Somalia and he sees no reason why it should not send 
any to Bosnia. 
  He said Turkey wants peace and stability in the Balkans, 
underlining the fact that a plan to reach peace in Bosnia and 
proposed 20 months ago was refused. 
  "It was later understood that Turkey was right in its point 
of view, but it was too late," Cetin said. 
  Turkey was since the start of the conflict favoring limited 
military air intervention in Bosnia. 
  Answering reporters' question on terrorism, Cetin said in 
Turkey there is no such thing as a "Turkish-Kurdish problem," 
citing as example the northern Iraqi Kurds. 
  "Who else except Turkey helps the Kurds in northern Iraq," 
he 
said adding Kurdish origin Turkish citizens would escape to 
Holland and not other Turkish provinces, if there was such a 
problem. 
  On Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] issue, he said Greece should refrain from escalating the 
tension, adding the embargo imposed on the former cannot be 
compared to the ones imposed to Iraq or Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Last week Greece announced it would let only humanitarian 
supplies of food and medicine across the border with FYROM and 
would deny its neighbour the use of the port of Salonika. 
  Cetin said Turkey will provide humanitarian help to FYROM 
and 
try to meet its need for oil, adding it is not sending that 
country any arms, artillery or soldiers. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman told the press on Wednesday 
Turkey 
will give gasoline and diesel fuel to the FYROM at favorable 
prices to meet its vital and urgent needs, adding Turkish sea 
ports will be opened to the FYROM's sea transportation. 
  On the Cyprus issue, he said Turkey favours a lasting and 
just peace, to be reached by way of dialogue, adding both sides 
should not be influenced by provocations from other countries.

  [Text] The Hague (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin on 
Thursday [24 February] said that the presence of any foreign 
organization's observers during the coming local elections in 
Turkey is unnacceptable, adding Turkey is a democratic country 
and anyone can come and observe as an individual. 
  He was speaking at a luncheon he hosted in honour of his 
counterpart, Peter Kooijmans, at the Turkish Embassy in The 
Hague. 
  After the luncheon, Cetin met with members of the Foreign 
Ministry commission of the Netherlands' parliament.

contacts in The Hague have been very constructive, adding talks 
focused on terrorism, the sitaution in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
economic relations. 
  On terrorism Cetin said that it is the international 
responsability of all countries not to support terrorist 
organizations, adding the NATO and UN resolutions necessitate 
this. 
  Cetin also said that the Turkish citizens living in Turkey 
[as received] will be able to vote during the local elections.

<F P=106> [Peter Almon, Defence Correspondent, and George Jones, </F>
Political Editor, article: "MPs Fear Army Cuts Will Limit UN 
Peacekeeping Role"] 
  [Text] The all-party Commons Defence Committee said last 
night that it viewed with "utmost gravity" the Government's 
decision to send out 7,016 redundancy notices to Army personnel 
today. In a statement pointing to growing evidence of 
instability and volatility in Central and East Europe, the 
Committee said: "The Committee fears that these reductions will 
mean that the Government will be unable to respond...to requests 
from the UN for additional forces in the peacekeeping role 
without unacceptable strains on other military commitments." 
  However, senior Army officials said the redundancies were 
necessary to shape the Army properly to about 120,000 troops. 
Announcing the cuts yesterday, they said they would launch a 
major drive to recruit 12,000 full-time soldiers -- 20 percent 
more than the current recruiting effort -- from April despite 
the redundancy notices. 
  Senior Army officials explained the apparently contradictory 
action by saying that the service had to find the right ages and 
right jobs for its future structure. 
  Adjutant General Sir Michael Wilkes said: "Soldiering is a 
young man's occupation. An ageing army year after year is not 
the answer, and unfortunately some people have to go." 
  A total of 720 officers and 6,295 soldiers were being made 
redundant today. For the first time 953 soldiers were being 
made compulsorily redundant, in addition to 142 officers. 
  The cuts were being made across the Army, including soldiers 
in Bosnia and Northern Ireland. After breakfast this morning 
commanders were informing their troops who would be getting 
their requested voluntary redundancies and who was being forced 
to leave. 
  Army officials declined to say how many redundancy notices 
were going to the 2,400 troops in Bosnia, but Gen Wilkes said it 
was fewer than last year. 
  He also declined to say that this third, and last, 
redundancy 
phase in the 1990 Options for Change cuts would indeed be the 
last. 
  Although the Army is moving about 3,000 support jobs to the 
front line, the Ministry of Defence's Front Line First study is 
expected to cost extra jobs. 
  Gen Wilkes said: "We live in a very changing environment. We 
will have to get out of the Cold War mentality. When will the 
changes stop? We have got to reconcile ourselves to be flexible 
to any changes that are thrown out." 
  The redundancies fall heaviest on junior and senior NCOs and 
on 31 colonels and 25 brigadiers. 
  They will all receive comprehensive redundancy packages 
totalling 250 million pounds. Older brigadiers will, if they 
commute some of their pensions, receive tax-free payments of 
about 200,000. 
  However, politicians objected from all three major parties. 
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative MP for Upminster and chairman 
of the Commons Defence Committee, said he was concerned at the 
size of the redundancy list, the largest of the three phases. 
  Mr David Clark, Shadow defence secretary, said: "Once again 
the Government are badly mis-managing British military forces. 
It is outrageous that our troops will be sacked while they are 
risking their lives in Bosnia." 
  Mr Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, 
said: "This decision is foolish and insensitive. 
  "It will severely damage morale and it will undoubtedly 
affect the ability of the Army to meet its obligations."

<F P=106> [Report by Phillip Johnston, George Jones and Boris Johnson, </F>
EC Correspondent in Brussels: "Holidays Vetoed as Tories Are Put 
on Euro-Poll Stand-By"] 
  [Text] Cabinet ministers and Conservative MPs have been 
warned not to book early summer holidays because they will be 
needed for a Tory fightback in the run-up to the June 9 
elections to the European Parliament [EP]. 
  A report yesterday predicted that the Conservatives were 
facing big losses in the Euro-elections -- a critical mid-term 
test for Mr Major and his Government -- with the Liberal 
Democrats set to win their first seats. 
  In an attempt to provide the maximum opportunities for 
campaigning, the Government has decided to call a two-week 
Commons Whit recess from May 27 to June 13. It will means 
Parliament will not be sitting in the 10 days up to the 
elections. 
  At a political session of the Cabinet yesterday, Sir Norman 
Fowler, the Tory party chairman, said everybody from Cabinet 
ministers to backbench MPs should get out and about in the 
country during the recess and galvanise support. 
  Later, Mr Hurd, Foreign Secretary, attempted to distance 
Tory 
MEPs [member of the European Parliament] from their alliance 
with Continental Euro-federalists, on the eve of today's 
potentially embarrassing publication of the Christian Democrat 
[CD] manifesto for the Euro-elections. 
  He has written to all Tory backbenchers, insisting on the 
distinct Conservative status of the 32 MEPs, as their CD allies 
announce commitments to the single currency, full 
Euro-federalism, and the Social Chapter. 
  In his letter, Mr Hurd attempts to dismiss the alliance with 
the European Peoples' Party [EPP] (Christian Democrats), 
initiated after the fall of Lady Thatcher in 1990, as a mere 
convenience. 
  He stresses that the MEPs' alliance with the EPP does not 
imply membership of the party; though Euro-sceptics such as Lord 
Tebbit have complained that Tories in Strasbourg, led by Sir 
Christopher Prout, are listed as "EPP" in all handbooks. 
  Projected results for the European elections were published 
yesterday by the Electoral Reform Society [ERS], based largely 
on the outcome of last May's county council elections. 
  Predictions have been made difficult by the addition of six 
seats and subsequent boundary revisions in many of the 84 
constituencies. 
  The Conservatives fared badly when the European elections 
were last fought on 78 constituencies in 1989, losing 13 seats 
and ending up with 32 to Labour's 45. 
  On the new boundaries, the ERS expects the Tories to do even 
worse, losing a further 12 seats and leaving them with 20. 
Labour is predicted to gain eight to 53 and the Liberal 
Democrats, who have no seats, to win 11.
