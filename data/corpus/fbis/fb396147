<F P=106> [Article by Stelian Damov: "Intercepting Political Traps, </F>
the Opposition Declares War on the Scenario of the Ordinances"] 
  [Text] 
  -- Wishing to remain "uncommitted," the Left, supplementing 
the tactic of stalling for time with political discussions at 
Cotroceni Palace, is trying to sidestep Parliament in connection 
with the approval of the IMF agreement, so as not to be forced 
to give a clear "yes" or "no" to the economic reform envisaged 
in this agreement. 
  -- The opposition refuses to give the government the 
competence to adopt ordinances, seeking, instead of a 
parliamentary recess, an extraordinary session for the open 
discussion of the very issues in the area of which the Executive 
claims to have authority. The draft law by which the government 
seeks the authority to adopt ordinances during parliamentary 
recesses has been the occasion for a new conflict. 
  -- Representatives of the opposition have withdrawn from the 
Chamber of Deputies. The opposition does not think that this 
authority should be given and has proposed that Parliament meet 
in extraordinary session, as soon as 3 January 1994, to discuss, 
in plenary session, all the regulations which the government 
seeks the authority to issue. Nevertheless, the parliamentary 
majority (based on the support of the forces on the left) really 
wants a parliamentary recess. The real reason is not fatigue and 
stress but a hidden reason, which our newspaper exposed long 
ago: It wants the "approval" of the IMF agreement without going 
through Parliament, even though the international organization 
called for parliamentary approval. The political undertone is 
very clear -- it is trying to avoid a strong "yes" or "no" from 
the leftist forces. If they were to say "yes," then they could 
be accused of being turncoats because the measures stipulated in 
the IMF agreement are right-wing measures. This would mean an 
ideological movement to the side of the opposition, despite the 
fact that they "blew it" just this month in the vote on the 
motion of censure against the government. If they say "no," this 
means that they really do not support the government, which has 
already signed the IMF agreement. It is impossible to resolve 
this dilemma so the only solution is a "welcome Parliamentary 
recess," during which all the responsibilities will rest with 
the government, thereby absolving from responsibility the 
political forces which support it.... This is only one problem. 
More dangerous is the fact that it also affects things which 
have nothing to do with the memorandum signed with the IMF. And 
even things which are in conflict with this memorandum! For 
example, the government wants to have the authority to: 
  -- modify the budget by sidestepping Parliament, which is 
inadmissible; 
  -- carry out an operation (with tragic results for the 
economy!) of total compensation for so-called arrears, without 
the approval of Parliament. Thus, a concealed assumption by the 
state of debts of bankrupt state enterprises which never could 
be repaid. "By the state" actually means on the backs of the 
people. 
  -- resume, through the back door, without transparency (a 
study in opportuneness made available to Parliament), 
investments in the nickel and cobalt combine in Cuba and a 
thermoelectric power plant in the PRC; 
  -- attempt to provide legal basis for maintaining the 
difference between wage increases and price increases; 
  -- contract for foreign credits, without mentioning the 
sources (!), which, in the case of approval by Parliament, would 
not be possible. If some of these things are necessary, it is 
all right, but we should know about them also!

<F P=106> [Commentary by Julius Gembicky: "Who Is Muhammad and Who Is </F>
the Mountain? Monkey Wrench in the Works of Slovak Foreign 
Policy"] 
  [Text] There are areas, in any at least somewhat organized 
state, where party interests or other particular interests 
should not come to the fore. Foreign policy is definitely one 
of these areas. Unfortunately, irrespective of foreign policy 
considerations and Slovakia's interests, the exact opposite is 
the case. With haughty baseness, we are using even the 
diplomatic field to settle domestic accounts and fighting for 
who should play the first fiddle on it. Is it a miracle that, 
when one diplomatic faux pas follows the next, foreign partners 
are turning away from us? 
  We can afford things that would be unimaginable in other 
countries -- to disparately interpret at the highest level the 
problem of the dismantling of [bilingual] road signs; to arrive 
late, without any reason, for a visit to a neighboring country; 
not to see off the head of state, out of sheer spite, when he 
departs for an official visit to Germany, as would be 
appropriate; or to vie for who will play the first fiddle at the 
meeting of representatives of the Visegrad Four countries with 
President Clinton. We can afford to first make threatening 
gestures at Radio Free Europe and, thereby, indirectly also at 
the U.S. Congress, in a display of world power manners, only to 
quietly put the tail between the legs later on and reverse the 
original decision, as if suffering a fit of asphyxia from 
smoking too strong a tobacco. We are unable to send out on 
time, by 15 January, our official response to the recommendation 
of European Union experts on how to divide the Danube water at 
Gabcikovo [between Slovakia and Hungary] or to complete, prior 
to President Michal Kovac's visit to Poland, agreements that are 
practically ready to be signed. We can even afford the luxury 
of [Economy] Minister Ducky's absence in the delegation 
accompanying the president and of putting the host country out 
of countenance in this way. And all that is aired to 
journalists, and at home in parliament, still during the 
official visit, all "in the interest" of improving Slovakia's 
positive image abroad. 
  An ordinary citizen who, for all the flowery diplomatic 
rhetoric, does not have the chance to hear the monkey wrench in 
the works of Slovak foreign policy, does not understand these 
blunders and acts of defiance of the highest constitutional 
officials. He cannot concede to himself the possibility of 
personal or political feuds being carried from the home kitchen 
to the hosts' living rooms and public lounges. After all, we 
all learn to try to leave in them a good, and not a bewildered, 
impression, let alone arouse some piquant scandal there. 
  We will have to learn to carefully distinguish where is the 
source, and who is the originator, of these elephants' moves in 
the diplomatic china shop. We will either have to accept the 
prime minister's claim about the government's accommodating 
approach toward the preparation of the president's trip to 
Poland, or the diplomatic tact of the president, who, when 
questioned in Warsaw by inquisitive journalists about Minister 
Ducky's absence, noted that the motives were not of a political 
but of a technical nature. Since even the decision to terminate 
Radio Free Europe broadcasts on medium waves was presented as a 
technical problem, it is obvious even to a layman that this was 
not the case. In the background is the struggle, which is 
becoming increasingly difficult to camouflage, for the unrivaled 
dominance of Slovak politics and, hence, also the steadily 
growing strains in relations between the government and the 
Castle [seat of the president]. A tough struggle between the 
prime minister and the president for primacy was waged even over 
the composition of the delegation for [the Visegrad leaders' 
summit with Bill Clinton in] Prague. A thorn in Vladimir 
Meciar's side was Pavol Demes [former minister of foreign 
affairs and President Kovac's current foreign policy adviser], 
whom the prime minister refused to include in the 12-member 
delegation and who, as Vladimir Meciar suggested, should go and 
have a nice beer during the talks with President Clinton. On 
the other hand, since the U.S. side and the representatives of 
the Visegrad Four states came to the talks with their ministers 
of defense, Imrich Andrejcak's absence would have been 
embarrassing, also in view of the discussion of NATO's 
Partnership for Peace offer. 
  The tug-of-war over whether the president or the prime 
minister was the real number one or number two during these 
negotiations of the year has, unfortunately, resulted in the 
fact that they did not consider it necessary to brief one 
another about the contents of their talks. If, in the final 
analysis, Jozef Moravcik, the chief of our diplomacy, will have 
to foot the bill for this, it will be clear to everyone who is 
Muhammad and who is the mountain.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pavol Hagyari, chairman of the Conservative </F>
Democratic Party, by R. Ruzickova; place and date not given: 
"First Goal--Get Into the Parliament; Second Goal--Win the 
Elections"] 
  [Text] The Conservative Democratic Party [KDS] is one of 
the parties that only came into existence after the June 
elections--on the ruins, so to speak, of the former Public 
Against Violence [VPN]. Therefore, it is one of the parties that 
so far have had no possibility to try for a seat in the 
parliament or the government, and, as is known, it has not the 
most modest of goals for the future in that respect. We talked 
about where it is coming from and where it is aiming with its 
chairman and active participant in the area of justice, trade, 
as well as production, Dr. Pavol Hagyari: 
  [Hagyari] I'll begin with the reason why we came into being. 
Since the political right lost in the election because of its 
fragmentation, this orientation in effect totally lost its 
influence in the solving of society's problems. We conceive and 
constitute ourselves as a conservative party positioned between 
the center and the right, and when we look at this area of the 
political spectrum today, we see there, besides us, practically 
only the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and the 
"pseudoright" Slovak National Party [SNS], which embraces the 
right in words, but if I am to judge it by its concrete actions 
in the parliament--that is, according to its voting on important 
laws--then it really is not particularly noted for its right 
orientation.... 
  [Ruzickova] Not even Cernak's wing? 
  [Hagyari] Mr. Cernak, besides the rightist rhetoric, also 
knows where SNS should be aiming as a party of the right. Maybe 
there are a few more people like that around him, but for the 
time being it is difficult to say how the party will actually 
develop. Somehow it has not yet crystallized. But I shall go 
back to the characteristics of our party, which I mentioned at 
the beginning. If we also categorize KDH as a rightist and 
conservative party, it should also be said that it speaks to its 
followers on the denominational basis. Whereas we cast ourselves 
as a civic party. We would like to appeal to the right-oriented 
citizens who, let's say, do not share with KDH a common view on 
the questions of faith, abortion, and attitude toward the Slovak 
state. We have already merged with the former Civic Democratic 
Party [ODS] on the basis of this common objective and signed an 
agreement on integration with the Democratic Party [DS]. When 
you realize that together this political right gained 10 percent 
of votes in the last elections, and you add to it our effort not 
to engage in needless politicking and philosophizing but to 
really pursue practical politics directed at the citizen, I 
believe that our plans for the future are not unrealistic even 
though they are not, I admit, modest. 
  [Ruzickova] Will you disclose them? 
  [Hagyari] We make no secret of them. In the next 
elections--and I should point out that I think it should be 
early elections--we want to become a parliamentary party, and 
even to win as an integrated right the next elections after 
that. Because if we want to achieve our goals, we must be in 
power. But we are not looking only at the parliament, we are 
also systematically preparing ourselves for the local elections. 
I can say that today the majority of mayors in towns sympathizes 
with us; 90 percent of them are right-oriented. By joining with 
DS, we gained influence also with mayors in those communities 
where DS is in a good position. Specifically in order to be 
useful to them, we are now formulating an agricultural program. 
We are making a great effort to bring prominent people into our 
party, because without them and their appearances and statements 
in the media, we cannot influence public opinion. We hold to the 
principle that a person must already be in some respect 
prominent when entering politics. He or she must already have 
the image of an expert, an influential entrepreneur, or a public 
official. We do not want it to be the other way around--that 
only through being active in politics they become prominent. 
  [Ruzickova] Your effort to bring in prominent people 
obviously stems from the fact that many known representatives of 
VPN, ODS, and DS are actively engaged in KDS--therefore 
rightists who lost in the elections, and although they are very 
active even now within the KDS, nevertheless, it would probably 
not be very good tactics for them to work too arduously at 
making themselves "visible" so soon after the election debacle. 
But I cannot altogether agree with you when you place primary 
importance on personalities. I believe that the 
citizen--especially after the innumerable disappointments with 
beautiful words and promises--will be paying more careful 
attention in the next elections to the programs. And the 
programs are what particularly interests us, all the more so 
because you are talking about helping entrepreneurs and 
transforming the economy, but in the same breath you are also 
talking about solving the problems of retirees, health care, and 
education. How do you propose to reconcile these interests and 
needs that are more antagonistic than synergetic? When our 
society, which is in the beginning stage of transformation, is 
faced with overcoming cutbacks, difficulties, and failures until 
we reach a certain degree of growth? Of course, a populist 
program, which only promises that everything will be fine, would 
be a mistake. No. The program must also say that there will he 
hard times. And a program for overcoming the hard times needs 
arguments and prominent people who know how to present the 
program and convince people. What, then, in brief are the 
characteristics of the individual parts of your program? 
  [Hagyari] It is essential to tell the truth. Even an 
unpleasant truth, so that people would at long last understand 
that socialism is really gone. But because there are actually 
areas that always and everywhere have to be subsidized, it is 
all the more important to think about creating resources. To do 
that it is possible to stay with the tried-and-tested approaches 
that are in fact used everywhere, and those form the basis of 
our programs. They are antistatism, that is, minimizing the role 
of the state, anticollectivism, because it was never 
progressive, and anti-egalitarianism--which means, the principle 
that people are equal under the law but are not equal in their 
abilities. We place emphasis on the individual, that is, the men 
or women who are able to lead, who know how to take care of 
themselves but also of others. The most important is the 
economic program.... 
  [Ruzickova] And what about education, for example? 
  [Hagyari] We propose to minimize state expenditures for 
education, establish as many private schools as possible, and, 
since we are now talking about the social sphere, privatize 
health care. The social sphere is dependent on the economic 
sphere, therefore there can be no miracles, they do not exist. 
The foundation is the economic program based on privatization by 
all the methods. 
  [Ruzickova] But privatization affects the former socialist 
properties. It includes the large enterprises. And as we know, 
in every good economy the smaller enterprises are the 
foundation. The middle stratum. But it has to grow from 
different roots, not from the privatization of the giants, but 
from increased private entrepreneurial activity. What mechanisms 
do you have ready to help this middle stratum come into 
existence? Meaning small workshops, medium-sized workshops, 
smaller factories. 
  [Hagyari] We already have the middle stratum. It was being 
formed during the small privatization. I myself am the co-owner 
of a small factory, which I acquired in 1991. Since that time, 
we substantially increased wages in it and invested in the 
development of technology. Truly, the best way to achieve growth 
leads through small and medium-sized enterprises. But here we 
find ourselves in a vicious circle that we have to break out of. 
The small and medium-size enterpreneurs do not have sufficient 
credit resources, because banks are still providing loans to 
unproductive state enterprises. 
  [Ruzickova] And the solution? 
  [Hagyari] Bankruptcies! I do not think that bankruptcies are 
some kind of tragedy. An enterprise declares bankruptcy, a 
competent entrepreneur appears and buys the factory. He will be 
interested in doing well, so he obtains the technology and 
employs people again. The second possibility is to bring in 
foreign capital. But that requires stabilization of the 
political scene. Our party has represented itself from the 
beginning as a party that wants to benefit precisely the 
entrepreneurial sphere. We enjoy very good cooperation with the 
Party of Enterpreneurs and Small Businessmen, and are thinking 
about integrating with them. We do not think, you see, that a 
special party of enterpreneurs has any prospects; unfortunately, 
nowhere in the world are such parties in power. And so we are 
making an effort if not to directly integrate with them, at 
least to create a bloc of the right. 
  [Ruzickova] What specifically have you already done for the 
small and medium-size entrepreneurs? 
  [Hagyari] Our economic program is based on creating the best 
possible conditions for entrepreneurs. Since we are not a 
government party, we at least make proposals in the legislative 
sphere that are in their interest. We pointed out, for example, 
that the law on land is contrary to the spirit of the 
Constitution, that the penal code incorrectly establishes 
criminal responsibility for unintentional failure to pay tax, 
and we initiated the protest against mandatory settlement of 
claims through Fizako. Our proposals are presented as 
initiatives for the Constitutional Court. 
  [Ruzickova] How do you want to cooperate with the Democratic 
Alliance, and what possibility do you see for cooperation with 
the liberal wing of HZDS [Movement for Democratic Slovakia]? 
  [Hagyari] I already said that we are ready to create a 
rightist bloc. There will be official discussions with the 
Democratic Alliance of the Slovak Republic following their 
congress. I believe that we will find points on which we agree. 
  [Ruzickova] I would also like to ask about your foreign 
contacts. You indicated that you are endeavoring to become 
members of suprastate, supranational central organizations. 
Which way do your lean? Toward the liberal or the conservative 
ones? 
  [Hagyari] We are a conservative-liberal, or to put it 
another 
way, a neoconservative party, and we have applied for membership 
in the European Democratic Union. There they welcomed our effort 
to integrate the Slovak right and promised us support not only 
moral but also specific. They will organize various educational 
seminars here. We are interested in becoming members of the 
European Democratic Union. 
  [Ruzickova] If you succeed in that, it will certainly 
increase not only the international but also the domestic 
standing of KDS, which you head. Your main goal--success in the 
elections--will nevertheless depend on whether you find the 
correct, balanced, and for other parties acceptable way for 
integrating the right. No matter how cautionary the election 
loss caused by the fragmentation of the right is, its memory by 
itself certainly will not be enough to unite the right. 
  [Hagyari] It would be ideal if on the right spectrum of the 
political scene we had only one or two parties; but, such a 
situation pobably will not exist here for a long time yet. As I 
said at the beginning, if the right is in fact represented by 
KDH and us, I think that KDH should address its people on the 
denominational principle, and we should address ours on the 
civic principle. We already succeeded in integrating with ODS 
and DS, which today also includes the former Movement for 
Understanding Between Czechs and Slovaks. I think that 
considering the Slovak conditions it is quite a good 
accomplishment. I believe that the Party of Enterpreneurs and 
Small Businessmen will also identify with our goals. We have an 
almost identical economic program with KDH, and their social 
program was formulated by one of our members. It is a strong 
movement. So far they have not expressed their view on the 
coalition of rightist parties--we are really ready to begin 
discussions on forming the rightist bloc at a moment's notice. 
It would be a good thing if the entire right were to succeed in 
uniting. Finally--the acid test of such tactics could come 
already in the local elections....

  [Text] Bratislava -- The deficit in the foreign trade 
balance of the Slovak Republic increased to 16.2 billion korunas 
[Sk] by the end of November 1993. The deficit for the first 10 
months of last year stood at only Sk10.2 billion. 
  According to an analysis carried out by the Slovak 
Statistical Office, the greatest deficit -- Sk23.129 billion -- 
is in the Slovak Republic's trade with the former CEMA [Council 
for Mutual Economic Assistance] countries, excluding the states 
of the Visegrad Four, that is, the CEFTA [Central European Free 
Trade Association] countries. The Slovak Republic's foreign 
trade balance with CEFTA countries shows a surplus of Sk7.449 
billion, Sk2.858 of which is accounted for by the Czech 
Republic. In the first 11 months of the year, the Slovak 
Republic also had a surplus, amounting to Sk1.72 billion, in its 
trade with the states of the European Union. Trade with the 
states of the European Free Trade Association shows the opposite 
trend. In the first 11 months of 1993, the Slovak Republic 
recorded an Sk6.012 billion deficit in trade with these 
countries. On the other hand, the Slovak Republic had a surplus 
in its trade with Asian countries and with the states of the 
African continent. An Sk2.235 billion deficit was recorded in 
the Slovak Republic's trade with the United States and an Sk118 
million deficit in trade with Australia. 
  According to the Slovak Statistical Office analysis, the 
Slovak Republic primarily imports raw materials, fuels, mineral 
oil, bitumen, and wax. The number one item among Slovak exports 
are iron and steel. Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, and 
appliances and their components are in second place, and motor 
vehicles, tractors, and motorcycles in third. 
  [Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak on 28 January on 
page 2 carries a 300-word "ba"-attributed report on Slovak 
Statistical Office data on foreign trade in the first 11 months 
of 1993, which adds that the Czech Republic accounted for 36.7 
percent of Slovak imports and for 42.2 percent of Slovak exports 
in this period.]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Ladislav Konecny, director of the </F>
Radioactive Waste Department at the Nuclear Control Office of 
the Slovak Republic, by Vladimir Duduc; place and date not 
given: "Deep Under Limits"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] When taking into account all 
the radionuclides contained in liquid waste, we can see that the 
yearly limit of beta activity for the A1 and V1 blocks in the 
Bohunice nuclear plant was fixed at 37,000 Mega becquerels 
(MBq). This limit was set at 0.21 percent and the limit for the 
V2 blocks -- 1,000 Mbq -- at 2.3 percent. In absolute figures, 
this means that from the V1 blocks, 1,600 cubic meters of 
decontaminated liquids were released into the environment in 
July, 650 in August, and 990 in September. The situation in 
other months was quite similar. 
  The remaining part of liquid radioactive waste cannot be 
released, since it would remain radioactive even after the 
decontamination process. Waste of this kind, as well as solid 
waste, such as various contaminated objects and equipment used 
for maintenance, routine repairs, and overhauls of atomic 
reactors (rugs, protective tools, metallic tools, and other 
materials), are stored in specially designated areas equipped 
for this purpose. 
  Both liquid and radioactive waste must be fixed [ridden of 
volatile parts] during further processing to meet transportation 
and storage regulations. "Fixation, or the solidification of 
radioactive waste, is nothing more than giving the material a 
convenient structure for long-term storage," Konecny says. The 
fixation of liquid and solid waste is done using various methods 
-- cementation, bituminization, vitrification, and other methods. 
  The deadline for the test run at the site of the radioactive 
waste permanent deposit in Mochovce is approaching. So far, the 
radioactive waste has been stored inside the power stations -- 
at the Bohunice V1 and V2. From a long-term view, however, this 
is not the final solution, especially if we realize that last 
year, the nuclear power station in Jaslovske Bohunice produced 
120-200 cubic meters of solid waste and 250 cubic meters of 
liquid waste that cannot be decontaminated.

  After his return, Peterle said that the Slovene delegation 
signed an agreement on establishing diplomatic relations with 
Kirghizia; a similar agreement was also reached with Uzbekistan. 
The delegation signed agreements on cultural cooperation and on 
developing closer economic relations with Kazakhstan and 
Turkmenistan. Several economists were invited to Slovenia to 
attend business meetings. 
  Peterle was accompanied by a group of Slovene businessmen. 
The Slovene delegation found a great deal of interest in 
economic cooperation in each country. In Turkmenistan it 
concluded a major business deal -- to barter Slovene 
pharmaceuticals (from the manufacturers Lek and Krka) for 
Turkmen diesel fuel.

the method of collection is not yet known since this regulation

  [Text] Luxembourg, 18 January -- At the European Investment 
Bank [EIB] headquarters, Slovene Minister of Finance Mitja 
Gaspari, accompanied by Andrej Umek, minister of transportation 
and communications, this afternoon signed an agreement for an 
ECU50 million loan, granted to the Ljubljana railroad enterprise 
to modernize some priority sections of the railroad network in 
our state. 
  This will be the first tranche of a loan earmarked for 
Slovenia in accordance with the transportation agreement signed 
last year between Slovenia and the EC and the financial protocol 
derived from this agreement, enabling Slovenia to receive an EIB 
loan of ECU150 million. Further cooperation between Slovenia and 
the EIB was also the topic of discussion between Gaspari and the 
EIB vice president. 
  Gaspari was also received by Luxembourg Prime Minister 
Jacques Santer and thanked him for his help with Slovenia's 
inclusion in World Bank activities (Slovenia is in the so-called 
constituency with Belgium and Luxembourg). Drawing on 
Luxembourg's considerable experience with the steel industry, 
they also discussed the possibility of Luxembourg helping the 
Slovene steel industry, not with money but mainly with advice or 
engineering. The economy ministers of both countries are to meet 
as soon as possible for further discussions. As far as we know, 
today's talks were not related to the Slovene Government's 
decision to temporarily deposit the repayments of outstanding 
liabilities of Slovene debtors to the Consortium of Commercial 
Banks. As reported, this money is to be deposited in a special 
account at the Dresdner Bank in Luxembourg.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 21 Jan (TANJUG) -- We will start 
implementing the new measures at the end of next week when the 
Republic's government is expected to adopt them, although we are 
already adhering to some of them, stressed Vladimir Lukic, the 
prime minister of the Srpska republic [RS], at a meeting devoted 
to economic recovery measures in Banja Luka this evening. 
  The meeting was attended by Jovan Zebic, the deputy prime 
minister of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], Nikola 
Stanic, the coordinator of the team of experts for monetary 
reconstruction and economic recovery of the FRY, Momo Pejic, the 
governor of the National Bank of the RS, Misa Jandric, the head 
of the Center for Development at the FRY Government, several 
ministers in the governments of the RS and the republic of Serb 
Krajina [RSK], and a number of scientists, businessmen, and 
bankers. 
  Apart from the essential features of the measures, most of 
the attention centered on future relations between Yugoslavia 
and the RS and RSK, and how monetary reconstruction will affect 
them. 
  Speaking about the unification of the monetary system, 
Stanic 
underlined that agreement must be reached on two key issues 
because the flow of goods, capital, and people on both sides of 
the Drina [river dividing Serbia proper and the Srpska republic 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina] must be completely free in the economic 
sense, while unification, due to the climate in international 
relations, should be carried out on the basis of agreements 
concluded between the three governments. 
  Stanic proposed that groups of experts from all three Serb 
states be formed for several important areas. The governors of 
the national banks should become members of the board of the 
Yugoslav National Bank, and groups should also be formed for 
coordinating the fiscal system, customs, and customs protection 
toward third countries, as well as for coordinating regulations 
on foreign capital.

<F P=106> [Article by Dragan Cicic: "The Road of Petroleum: Showdown </F>
in No-Man's Land"] 
  [Text] Why the price of gasoline in Belgrade jumps 
whenever some Bulgarian mafioso in Sofia kills a Bulgarian 
policeman. 
  Armed conflict on the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border, which both 
sides tried to hush up, occurred on Tuesday, 21 December. 
Fortunately, the fighting was not between the armed forces of 
the two states. The targets of the attack by Bulgarian special 
police were criminals from Sofia who were in the "no-man's land" 
between the Gradina border crossing on our side and the Kalotina 
border crossing on the Bulgarian side. 
  The criminals had retreated into our territory, but the 
special police followed them and in so doing crossed onto our 
side of the border. However, since this obviously involved a 
chase, the only visible consequence was the posting of Yugoslav 
special police along the border. Or to be more precise, the only 
consequence as far as Yugoslav-Bulgarian relations are concerned. 
  The second consequence will affect a significantly larger 
number of people. The battle on the no-man's land was at the 
same time a battle at the biggest gasoline market supplying the 
citizens of Serbia under the weight of sanctions. 
<H5>  Market </H5>
  Days after the showdown, there are dozens of canisters 
scattered about the land between the two border crossings, while 
the asphalt is so oily and slick from the spilled gasoline that 
a great deal of caution is called for in walking across it. A 
market has existed at that site for the last two or three 
months. Seeing that the citizens of Serbia often have problems 
taking out large quantities of fuel, the resourceful Bulgarians 
began to cross their part of the border and sell gasoline on the 
no-man's land. People from Serbia would cross only the Yugoslav 
border, buy gasoline, and return home without contact with 
Bulgarian customs officials. It is true that the Bulgarians were 
selling the fuel at twice the price--1.5 to 1.6 German marks 
[DM] per liter--of the fuel at the pump only several kilometers 
away (between DM0.8 and DM0.9 per liter). To the Serbs, even 
this increased price was preferable to the endless waiting at 
crowded pumps and to the problems, often based on "material" 
considerations, with Bulgarian customs officials concerning 
"export" permits. 
  Everyone was satisfied, and an increasing number of cars 
registered with our eastern neighbor were trying to quench the 
thirst on this side of the border. Sales were made primarily 
from tank to tank until some strong men realized that big money 
was changing hands between Gradina and Kalotina. The ordinary 
citizens had to go, and complete control over the "market" was 
assumed by people whom the local population calls the "mafia." 
They arrived in convoys of 10, 20, and even 30 vans full of 
gasoline, unloaded canisters, and started pouring. The din of 
voices and throng of commerce flowed among hundreds of barrels 
and siphon tubes for nearly 24 hours a day. All of this took 
place a few dozen meters away from the Yugoslav and Bulgarian 
customs authorities. "It's not like they did not benefit from it 
as well," says one of the old gasoline barons from Nis. 
<H5>  Kolo </H5>
  The idyll was suddenly disrupted by the aforementioned 
showdown. One of the bosses of the petroleum business killed two 
policemen in Sofia during an attempt to arrest someone else. The 
Bulgarians received information indicating that the person in 
question could be found at the border market, and on Tuesday 
before last, between 1930 and 2000, special forces conducted a 
raid in which several persons were injured. The mafiosi 
retreated into FRY territory, the special police rushed in after 
them, and our police apprehended several of the fugitives, 
together with one Bulgarian colleague. The latter was released, 
the criminals were turned over to the Bulgarian authorities, and 
the market was shut down. 
  However, that is not the end of the road for gasoline. Nor 
is 
it the beginning. Ever since it became almost impossible to 
import petroleum in tanker trucks, it has been brought in from 
Bulgaria on organized bus tours. Logically, the "safest" ones 
have also been the most expensive ones. For DM200 per person, 
the organizers guaranteed that passengers would return to Serbia 
with 200 liters of gasoline each in canisters. Naturally, the 
largest part of the money went to "unofficial duty," which ended 
up in the hands of Bulgarian customs agents. Still, there was 
always risk involved. Inspection teams occasionally managed to 
replace bribable officials, and to change the shifts of those 
simply under suspicion. In that case, a bus would park in front 
of the crossing while the unfortunate passengers waited for 
eight or even 16 hours, over night, until "their man" arrived. 
Fatigue, torment, and the fear of loss pushed nerves to the 
limit, after which incidents were not out of the question. One 
of our passengers poured gasoline through a window onto an 
industrious Bulgarian customs agent who would not let the tour 
pass and tried to set him on fire. 
  Once they finally managed to cross the Bulgarian part of the 
border, the people got 200 liters of gasoline for which they 
paid around DM0.9 per liter in Bulgaria, plus DM1 per liter as 
the transaction cost. Just on our side of the border, they met 
up with the local financial police, who collected a fee of DM0.6 
per liter. Thus, upon entering Serbia the gasoline already cost 
DM2.5. Nevertheless, the passengers were content, and despite 
all the difficulties they could rest easy. "When we passed Nis, 
the kolo dancing would begin," one of them says. Music from 
cassette players accompanied dancing around the tightly packed 
bags and canisters, while cigarettes burned in the darkness of 
the bus, the scent of their smoke mixing with the smell of the 
gasoline fumes. These traveling lakes of gasoline often 
comprised a whole metric ton. 
<H5>  "Mixing" </H5>
  Besides the buses originating in Belgrade, the residents of 
towns close to the border have also been doing business through 
private deals, primarily with their own vehicles. This means 
that gasoline for them is significantly cheaper, so that the 
resale price in southern Serbia has been around DM2 to DM2.2. 
Given the various additional methods for improving profits, this 
has paid off. Clearly the best-known method is "mixing" the fuel 
with water. But there are others as well. At one of the "sales 
points" (cans with tubing and funnels set up beside the 
highway), a man sells 12 liters of gasoline, pouring it from a 
canister with a clearly imprinted label reading "10 liters." 
  The stricter controls since last week's incident have 
drastically reduced the quantity of fuel that these "private 
businessmen" are able to move, to say nothing of the buses. 
Besides the mounds of abandoned plastic at the former market, a 
similar pile is building up at the Bulgarian crossing. Upon 
entry into Bulgaria, local customs agents now confiscate not 
only empty canisters, but also practically any container into 
which fluid can be poured, including plastic 
one-and-a-half-liter cola bottles. Periodically, forklifts 
arrive to carry all this off somewhere. Those who attempt to 
pass without having the trunk of their car checked are pulled 
from their car in the middle of the crowd by a large customs 
agent with a pistol in his shoulder holster, yelled at, and then 
thrown like a sack of flour back behind the steering wheel and 
told to get back in line. 
  The procedure seems unnecessarily harsh, and the search for 
empty containers seems excessively stringent unless the same 
crossing is made in the evening in the opposite direction, 
toward Yugoslavia. The crowd no longer even knows how many 
parallel lines there are, people walk around in all directions 
as if taking their evening stroll, so that the customs agents 
have no choice but to wander among the jammed vehicles and ask 
individuals whether they are carrying gasoline, and possibly 
conduct a superficial check of every 10th car. But the reason 
that even the smallest containers are confiscated upon entry 
becomes clear only when one sees the pump in Slivnitsa, a town 
15 km from the border, which the Serbian army at one time 
attempted unsuccessfully to occupy. 
<H5>  War </H5>
  Plastic containers for cooking oil or antifreeze, the volume 
of which is never more than a liter, are removed from various 
hiding places in the cars. A tall fellow with an earring pours 
into a cola bottle that is so battered and twisted that it is a 
wonder that it does not leak. Once it is filled, he wraps it up 
among part of the engine and hides other containers in the gaps 
as well. Additional liters of gasoline are placed in the rear, 
in a gas tank that is no longer used for its intended purpose. 
While he gets into his old car, which could now be almost as 
dangerous as the vehicle of a Hezbollah kamikaze driver, he 
shrugs: "So what, I'm 23 and have no other prospects." 
  Smuggled gasoline is often camouflaged by other goods, the 
"export" of which is perhaps viewed more favorably. The rear end 
of the car is almost dragging the asphalt under the weight of 
rice, salt, toilet paper, meat, oranges, and whatever else in 
the trunk. "You have war in your country, nothing else," says a 
young Gypsy Zoja with concern and understanding at an improvised 
booth in Slivnitsa. 
  However, the small quantities of fuel hidden under piles of 
third-rate goods or in engines do not meet the demand by a long 
shot, which raises the prices when controls are tightened. Thus, 
we are learning here to what extent the market is a sensitive 
mechanism. A Bulgarian mafioso kills two policemen in Sofia, and 
the price of gasoline rises in Belgrade.

<F P=106> [Article by Biserka Matic: "Federal Budget Becomes Important </F>
Topic Before Adoption of New Economic Program: Olympic Athletes 
More Expensive Than Some Ministries"] 
  [Text] The preliminary federal budget for the first 
quarter valorized from 210,600,000,000 to 179,061,000,000,000 
dinars; fighting inflation through indexing; key expenditures 
for the Armed Forces, but large sums also go to many less 
important items. 
  Ever since the Federal Assembly was placed in the position 
of 
outsider, with its functions assumed by the federal government, 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia too has ceased to be financed 
according to the Law on the Federal Budget; instead, that 
financing has been provisional or based on decrees or decisions. 
At the end of last year, when the government, acting on its own 
and without the parliament, adopted one of last year's numerous 
rebalancings of the federal budget, Belgrade attorney Milenko 
Radic brought suit before the Yugoslav and Serbian 
Constitutional Court in an effort to prove that the government 
was acting in conflict with the Constitution and with the law. 
  Naturally, no one paid the least bit of attention to this 
attorney's objections, nor to the criticism voiced by many party 
leaders who were alarmed that the Federal Assembly was 
increasingly being held back and marginalized societally and 
legislatively. On the contrary, the government in the meantime 
(in early January) issued a decree on the provisional financing 
of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] "for the period from 
January to March 1994," and in the first paragraph it washed its 
hands, so to speak, of all potential objections and criticism. 
"Until enactment of the Law on the Federal Budget for 1994, by 
31 March 1994 at the latest, the authorities of the FRY shall be 
financed in accordance with the Law on the Federal Budget for 
1993, with a real amount established by this decree." This is 
the first paragraph, which "covers" the federal government 
before the FRY Constitution. The Constitution states that laws 
are enacted by the assembly, while decrees and decisions come 
from the federal government. 
  In the case of the federal budget, legal experts from the 
Palace of the Federation in Novi Beograd will repeat that here 
too it is simply a matter of indexing. Being added to the 
established price of a certain good are only the costs of 
inflation, hyperinflation, or mega-inflation, depending on the 
pace at which prices are rising. 
  In the first quarter, the authorities of the FRY will be 
financed by a sum of 210,660,000,000 dinars, according to 
SLUZBENI LIST No. 2 of 10 January. In case anyone is concerned 
that this is too little and that it will be additionally and 
excessively devalued by further inflation, it must be said that 
the federal government has also considered that possibility. The 
very day after the enactment of the decree on the provisional 
financing of the FRY, a decision was adopted to valorize the 
funds for financing the FRY and was published in SLUZBENI LIST 
(No. 3) of 11 January. Here it now says that the funds 
(established by the decree) for the first quarter are valorized 
and "established" as 179,061,000,000,000 dinars, "based on the 
estimated growth in retail prices." 
<H5>  Each According to Merit </H5>
  Thus, the decision became older than the decree, so that it 
is no longer possible to speak of the 210,066,000,000 dinars, 
but rather of the sum established by the decision. We have 
verified that the government has enacted no new decrees and 
decisions in the meantime, so that the one published in SLUZBENI 
LIST on 11 January is still in force. 
  According to the decision, everything is in order on the 
revenue side: 111,018,500,000,000 dinars will be secured from 
base revenues, 53,720,000,000,000 dinars from long-term National 
Bank of Yugoslavia loans, and 14,322,500,000,000 from bonds. It 
is also calculated that in the first quarter 35.7 trillion will 
be collected from the excise tax, 52.19 trillion from revenue 
stamps (for the first time this sum is greater than the excise 
tax, which indicates that the population faces paying enormous 
stamp duty), 15.3 trillion from customs, and another 254 billion 
from administrative fees. 
  The key items on the expenditure side are outlay for the 
Armed Forces of Yugoslavia (135.137 trillion dinars), the 
operation of federal agencies (20.502 trillion), disabled 
veteran benefits (14.056 trillion), and supplemental funds for 
the territories under UN protection (1.7 trillion dinars). 
  During the first quarter, the Federal Assembly will cost 
847.5 billion dinars (independent of possibility that it may not 
convene during that period), the general secretariat of the FRY 
president 110 billion, the Federal Court 74, the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office 27, the Federal Constitutional Court 53.5, 
the Federal Public Legal Office 14.9, the Federal Council for 
Violations (!?) 53.3, and the general secretariat of the federal 
government 803 billion dinars. 
<H5>  Concern for Olympic Matches </H5>
  We assume that every federal ministry has been 
well-assessed. 
In fact, mention is made in several places of certain funding 
for "intervention in the economy" (as in the case of the 
Secretariat for Legislation, where the amount is as much as 
5.987 trillion dinars) or for "maintenance and procurement of 
equipment and other basic resources of federal agencies and 
organizations" (in the case of the Ministry of Justice, where 
the amount is 544 billion dinars). All institutions are present, 
from computer science to patents and the institute for measures 
and precious metals, as well as all inspectorates and the Office 
for the Performance of Specialized-Technical Work for the Needs 
of Federal Agencies (a total of 2.05 trillion dinars). 
  According to the decision, the budget provides 90 billion 
for 
bank rehabilitation (it does not say which ones--whether, for 
example, Dafiment Bank is included) and another 877 billion for 
settlement of part of the obligation for deposited 
foreign-exchange savings. The largest part of the 126 billion 
provided for the Ministry of Sports will go to "funding for the 
program of the sports leagues of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav 
Olympic Committee [JOK]." 
  In the decree on provisional financing, 135 million out of 
the 149.2 million earmarked for the aforementioned ministry is 
provided for (as attorney Radic says) "Bakocevic's Olympic 
Committee," or a little less than what is provided for the 
entire Ministry of Agriculture, and twice as much as for the 
Archives of Yugoslavia, the Federal Market Inspectorate, the 
Ministry for Trade, or the Ministry for Science, Technology, and 
Development. In short, if one is cynical one must note that the 
government has perhaps allocated little for these purposes based 
on the successes achieved by the JOK in clearing the way for our 
athletes to participate in the Olympic Games. 
  Nowhere, neither in the decree nor in the decision, is there 
any mention of youth or veterans organizations, but they can 
indeed be found under individual ministries or as "other needs." 
For example, financing of the operation of organizations and 
associations for veterans and the disabled is mentioned in the 
item linked with the Ministry of Health, while additional 
funding for practically the same purpose is found under "other 
needs." It is true that the federal government did not exactly 
have to give special consideration to the budget items, nor to 
whether some of the old expenditures were sandwiched--the budget 
was not the subject of parliamentary debate. Far from the 
deputies' eyes, the government was able to provide for and 
finance whatever it wanted, because for now no one is being held 
accountable for this, or for anything else.

<F P=106> [Article by Vesna Vujic: "Kostunica and Djindjic in the Same </F>
Deputy Team"] 
  [Excerpts] After it had been reported that the Democratic 
Party [DS] and the Democratic Party of Serbia [DSS] would form a 
joint deputy caucus, numerous questions were asked about 
relations between the two parties. To what extent is this move 
only a temporary practical solution, and to what extent is it a 
step toward closer cooperation, even perhaps reunification under 
the same roof? Following the flood of speculation, we asked the 
parties to the agreement what the joint deputy caucus would 
mean, especially in view of the increasingly cordial relations 
that began before the elections. 
  The DSS spokesman Milorad Jovanovic stressed that in this 
way 
the parties would solve practical problems in the new assembly. 
The DSS-DS deputy caucus is a temporary solution, until the 
Rules of Procedure of the Serbian Assembly are changed. 
According to the new rules, deputy caucuses would be reduced 
from 10 to five members. All opposition parties in the 
parliament are demanding this change. The agreement reached by 
leaders of four opposition parties is that a joint deputy caucus 
be formed until the new Rules of Procedure are adopted. This 
will probably be done by DEPOS [Democratic Movement of Serbia], 
DZVM [Democratic Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians], and the 
coalition of the PDD [Party for Democratic Activity] and the DPA 
[Democratic Party of Albanians]. This was accepted as a 
rational solution, because in this way the opposition parties 
would have a majority over the SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] 
in assembly committees, and possibly one more deputy than the 
Socialists in the Chamber of Republics. 
<H5>  The Importance of Clean Accounts </H5>
  Jovanovic used this opportunity to stress the importance of 
the DSS' decision not to go into any coalitions before the 
elections. Now that accounts are clean, all parties can 
cooperate better. "Perhaps we paid a price for it, but it is a 
fact that opposition parties have no difficulties today in 
reaching agreements on certain issues," the DSS spokesman said. 
  There are democrats in both parties who would again want to 
see the emergence of a single party through the setting up of 
the joint deputy club. The most frequently mentioned argument 
for a single party is that in fact there are hardly any 
differences in the party programs, that is, in the polices of 
the DSS and DS. The differences lie more in the form. 
Djindjic's young democrats claim that they are pragmatists in 
the realization of the party's interests. They say that 
Vojislav Kostunica's democrats were "oppositional 
fundamentalists" in the struggle against the regime, which is 
perhaps the key difference between them. 
  The person whom we found in the DS to talk to us about this 
topic wanted to remain anonymous this time. He wanted to stress 
that the DSS has never accused the DS of "collaborating" with 
the SPS. This party had not done this even though it perhaps 
had more right to do so than any other party. The party has 
never been linked with the Socialists in any way, and it 
considers this fact to be one of its special qualities. The 
criticism came from the SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] and the 
SRS [Serbian Radical Party], which divided power with the SPS 
(SPO in Savski Venac, and the SRS in Novi Sad and the Vojvodina 
Assembly). 
  This statement is reminiscent of someone who is nostalgic, 
someone who wants primarily to stress the importance of elements 
that link the "pragmatical" and "fundamentalist" democrats. 
There are also some observers who, forgetting all choice 
epithets connected with politics in general, were even seriously 
surprised by the joint deputy caucus of the two democratic 
parties. They immediately recalled the time when the DS was 
experiencing rifts and when its leaders were accusing one 
another without apology. [passage omitted] 
  In any case, the outcome today is that relations between the 
two parties had begun to normalize even before the elections. 
This was followed by talks between party leaderships. The DS, 
as it claims, received its first sincere congratulations from 
the DSS on its election success. The founding of the caucus is 
therefore, in a way, natural and politically constructive. Some 
democrats say that they would not be surprised if the two 
parties entered the next elections with joint candidates. 
  Time will, of course, show what happens. However, when 
assessing the chances of the democrats building a joint house, 
one should not lose sight of the fact that, after all, these two 
parties have each built their political identity in their own 
way.

<F P=106> [Communique by the Government of Serbia: "Regulations for </F>
Stabilization"] 
  [Text] At yesterday's meeting presided over by Nikola 
Sainovic, the Government of Serbia adopted the final text of 
about 30 regulations and decrees setting the tasks of the state 
bodies and facilitating the overall application of the Program 
for the Reconstruction of the Monetary System and Strategy for 
the Economic Recovery of Yugoslavia in 1994. The republic 
government reexamined the package of stabilization measures 
because the government task forces working on the implementation 
of the program proposed certain changes and additions to the 
original decisions. 
  The government also called for the active involvement of 
government officials and authors of the measures in order to 
mobilize all the public, from enterprises to state bodies and 
citizens, to work for the implementation of the program. Thus, 
the citizens of Serbia will be informed as soon as possible 
about the substance, nature, and implementation of the measures 
offered as the most suitable manner for coming out of the crisis. 
  The republic government examined the draft of the new 
criminal law and established the procedure for sending this 
important law to the National Assembly of Serbia for adoption.

  [Text] Yesterday's Democratic Party communique stresses 
that, by introducing the new tax system through decrees, the 
government of Nikola Sainovic is ignoring the assembly, which is 
the only entity that has the right to decide on this matter. By 
introducing these decrees, the republic government, whose 
mandate expired with the dissolution of the assembly, is in 
violation of Article 52 of the Serbian Constitution, which 
stipulates that "taxes and other fees can only be introduced 
through law." This bypassing of the laws passed in the assembly 
and governing by decree in fact represents the introduction of a 
state of emergency by the Government of Serbia. 
  Thus, the introduction of a new tax according to which all 
enterprises are obligated to pay 10,000 German marks at the 
beginning of the year, regardless of their income or number of 
employees, will shut down even the small number of successful 
enterprises and force everyone who wants to earn a living to do 
so in an illegal way. It is the same with the introduction of 
the republic tax on buses leaving the country, which affects the 
poorest strata of the population the most. 
  All of this indicates that the ruling party, instead of 
attempting to achieve a consensus of all the parties in the new 
assembly in order to stop the hyperinflation and introduce order 
in the legal system and the market, has opted for unlawful 
measures by which the citizens of Serbia are being robbed. The 
Democratic Party believes that such behavior at a time when our 
country is in a great crisis cannot bring good to our people, it 
is stated in this communique.

<F P=106> [Article by R.L.: "Taxes Higher Than Annual Income"] </F>
  [Text] The newly introduced republic tax with which one 
virtually pays for the right to work (from 100 to 10,000 dinars 
depending on the type of activity), at least judging from the 
first reactions, has embittered many. Are there good reasons 
for this? 
  "This is the greatest stupidity that could have been 
adopted," Duka Samardzic, in charge of the private sector in the 
Economic Chamber of Belgrade, says. "Judging from the text of 
this decree, several provisions in it are logically hard to 
explain and to understand. For example, it calls for 
representative offices of foreign firms to pay the highest tax 
amount of 10,000 dinars. Do we want in this way to chase away 
even the few such offices that are in our country? I had 
thought that it was in our interest to keep foreign firms in our 
country, to be in contact with the world through them, and now I 
see that the people in the government think differently." 
Samardzic believes that this decree especially affects the 
owners of private firms. The majority of firms are registered to 
conduct several types of business activity, including, for 
example, foreign trade. The authors of the decree call for firms 
to pay taxes based on the business activity for which, according 
to this decree, the highest tax amount is set. Thus, the 
majority of private businessmen will have to pay the 5,000 
dinars set for foreign trade, although they did not transact a 
single business deal in this sector, having worked mostly in the 
services sector, for which the prescribed tax is only one-fifth 
as much. 
  Samardzic says that this decree will also affect those who 
have recently registered their firms and so far not carried out 
any business deals: "If they have not managed to earn anything 
yet, how will they pay these 5,000 dinars? This equals 5,000 
German marks. This is a lot of money today, and it is not easy 
to pay it just so that one might gain the right to work. Anyway, 
many do not manage to make that much money even in a whole year, 
so how can they pay this amount?" 
  To make the problem worse, the closing of a firm is not a 
way 
out for those affected by this decree, because the procedure for 
closing a firm can cost even more. "At this moment it is really 
difficult to be wise and advise people on what they should do," 
Samardzic says.

<F P=106> [Interview With Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo </F>
Crvenkovski by Zaneta Skerlev; place and date not given: "The 
Strategic Interest of Macedonia Is -- Macedonia"] 
  [Text] [Skerlev] There have many public commentaries saying 
your ministry is introverted. Will secrecy continue to be the 
manner of the work of the Ministry for Foreign Relations? 
  [Crvenkovski] Secrecy is characteristic of all foreign 
ministries in the world; therefore, that principle will also be 
there in the future to a certain extent. What is evident, if you 
have followed the events over the years, is that for a while 
there have been practically no secrets. There was also a period 
when we really cut off almost all information. If we compare the 
results of the two periods, I think we easily realise which of 
the two was better for the role and place of Macedonia in the 
international community. 
  [Skerlev] Is it not somewhat naive to believe that the 
public, or whatever is published in our mass media, was the 
Greek Government's real source of information on the actions we 
were going to take? Your predecessor once said that was the 
reason why they were always "one step ahead of us," as 
justification for secrecy in the work. They probably have their 
own sources, and our public has the right to be informed. 
  [Crvenkovski] Anyway, it is far from true that any diplomacy 
uses the newspapers as its source of information; there are 
certainly many other sources of information available. Every 
country, including our own, has many friends in international 
communications who assist in getting information. 
  [Skerlev] If secrecy is characteristic of periods when 
something is in preparation, what preparations are underway for 
the Greek-Macedonian negotiations, since there is no other 
information except the public's general worries? 
  [Crvenkovski] First of all, I would like to say that, 
regarding secrecy, an image has been created that we have less 
information than Greece. If you take a closer look, there are 
many pieces of false information! And they are accepted by our 
public, despite our frequent warnings they are false and untrue. 
It is necessary to follow up cautiously not only the quantity, 
but also the quality, of information, in order to see the 
attitude of the public to a certain ministry. 
  As far as the negotiations with Greece are concerned, there 
are no secrets at all. We have clearly expressed our interest in 
resuming the negotiations in New York, and in December we had a 
meeting with Mr. Cyrus Vance, who was directly informed about 
our interest. Before that, we stated the same thing to UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali -- all this was published, 
as were the contents of the letter, and there were no secrets 
there. There is nothing else. Not only are there no secrets, but 
there is nothing more than that. 
  [Skerlev] According to the Greek press and the statements of 
their current politicians on different compromises and 
concessions, it seems that there is "something"? Has Macedonia 
received signals about a possible change in the Greek attitude 
toward our country? 
  [Crvenkovski] I could not say whether and how much their 
attitude has changed, because it cannot be known before we sit 
down and listen to what they have to say. What is probably a 
fact, for a cautious observer of the events, is that both sides 
are maturing in the knowledge that good relations between the 
two countries are indispensable for both countries. How will 
that knowledge be reflected in some concrete actions in future 
is something we will have to wait and see. At this moment, since 
a continuation in the process of negotiation is missing, it is 
difficult to assess the real positions and the possible changes. 
  On the other hand, we have not yet received any official 
information on the resumption of negotiations from the mediator. 
  [Skerlev] Do we expect the relations with Greece to be 
solved 
first on the political plane and only then starting with the 
development of the economic, cultural, scientific, and other 
relations, or, are they going to be insisted upon as the basis 
for solving the political disputes? 
  [Crvenkovski] I think that all spheres of cooperation with 
Greece are open and they have to be utilized. What we have 
clearly stated everywhere is that our policy is to be open with 
all, particularly with our neighbors. There should be no 
obstacles to cooperation. 
  [Skerlev] Are there any initiatives on such a cooperation 
from the Greek side? 
  [Crvenkovski] I do not know about initiatives on levels 
other 
than those that we are engaged in and that are within our 
competence. However, I can see there are a lot of contacts of 
businessmen, intellectuals, journalists. All forms of contact 
and cooperation can contribute to overcoming the problems. 
  [Skerlev] Lately, a great number of U.S. politicians and 
high 
army officers visited Macedonia. Is the promotion of the level 
of diplomatic relations between the two countries in sight? 
  [Crvenkovski] We have daily visits, not only by U.S. 
personalities, but from practically all over the world, which is 
a sign that interest in Macedonia is growing. Not only the 
interest of the United States, but of almost all important 
countries. Regarding relations with the United States, there 
exists a very clear continuity. Since the beginning of the 
process of our independence, we have received express support 
for the territorial integrity of Macedonia and for the stability 
of the country. I would also say that bilateral relations are 
developing according to a logical schedule. The level of 
contacts improve daily, the opening of the office in Skopje was 
a logical step, as well as the December meeting at the level of 
foreign ministers. That office will most probably be enlarged 
with new diplomats. It is sure that relations will be improved 
following that logical development. However, anticipating the 
dynamics of the development of relations can be an ungrateful 
job. 
  [Skerlev] What is, in your opinion, the reason for this 
intensified interest in Macedonia, particularly in the context 
of the different theories on spheres of interest? 
  [Crvenkovski] There appear to be various speculations in the 
public on different spheres of interest, different alliances of 
countries interested in having influence of one type or another 
on this territory. I must say that these speculations are mainly 
dominated by concepts of the 19th and the first half of the 20th 
century. The strategic interest in Macedonia at this moment is 
the fact that we have promoted a new model of relations. In the 
external, but mainly in the internal policy. In extremely 
difficult surroundings, in extremely difficult conditions, with 
a war raging in the neighborhood, with blockades, and with a 
growing ethnic conflict in the Balkans, as in the greater number 
of postcommunist countries, we offered a model contrary to that 
leading to conflicts and wars. 
  The success of the model of stability, with the help of all 
groups and structures in society, through the opening of 
economic and democratic areas, is of strategic interest and it 
is of great interest to the United States and Europe, as well as 
to the whole democratic world. In that sense, Macedonia has got 
an extraordinary strategic interest of the type that dominates 
at the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century. 
  [Skerlev] Do you think that foreign policy is sufficiently 
engaged in the economy, first of all in making up for the 
damages caused by the sanctions, and how great an accent is 
placed on economic relations in the ministry? 
  [Crvenkovski] The sanctions have been our main subject in 
all 
our international activities. Practically, there has not been a 
meeting in which the sanctions were not the first point on the 
agenda. However, in all the statements we have made, we were 
explicit in saying that overall compensation up for the 
sanctions is an illusion deriving from great hopes. What we 
succeeded in was to open a process in the United Nations with 
the Security Council Resolution with which the countries members 
were called to help Macedonia. We succeeded in arousing the 
interest of the international financial organizations in 
undertaking concrete actions. We have made an agreement with the 
IMF and we have signed an arrangement that has, so far, been the 
most favorable arrangement signed by the IMF with any country. 
The IMF has signed up such an arrangement only with Russia and 
Macedonia! It opens doors for negotiations with the Paris Club 
regarding the regulation of Macedonia's debts, thus opening a 
normal process of banking communication on a commercial level. 
  What is worth mentioning about the economic situation in 
Macedonia is that we frequently talk about the sanctions, but 
even without them, we would have been faced with a very 
difficult situation. Normally, it was due to the break-up of the 
old Yugoslav market, but primarily due to the break-up of the 
whole Eastern European market. The establishment of relations 
will be carried out slowly, not because of us, but because of 
the situation in the Eastern European countries. Frankly 
speaking, the economic situation in Macedonia, as well as the 
standard, the level of currency stability, are far from the 
situation in all these countries. 
  A year and a half ago, or two years ago, the main question 
asked by the international public relating to Macedonia was 
whether this country was capable of surviving economically. That 
was before the sanctions. When it became clear that Macedonia 
was surviving despite the sanctions and the blockades from the 
south -- that it was paying a much higher price, but surviving 
economically and politically, the image about Macedonia and the 
interest in Macedonia changed. Despite everything, we 
demonstrated that we were capable of surviving economically in 
abnormal conditions, paying a very high price. Thus the image 
of, and the interest in, Macedonia was suddenly changed in the 
international community and they could all see a new model. 
Although that model was promoted, and it turned out to be 
successful, it will spread to other countries at a slow pace. 
Even the strategic position of this region can be changed. 
Because of all that, a country with a 2 million population is 
playing a far, far greater role in the international policy and 
in the interest of the international community than it was 
expected to, bearing in mind its size and importance in the 
region. 
  [Skerlev] What are the new developments in relation to the 
announced extension of the Macedonian diplomatic net throughout 
the world, and in that context, the main subject -- the 
appointment of ambassadors. 
  [Crvenkovski] Very soon, we shall open two or three offices. 
In a greater number of countries we have our offices -- of 
course, we are now raising offices to the level of embassies. 
However, I can see that a false image has been created in the 
public on this issue, that we shall have embassies wherever we 
have established diplomatic relations. This will certainly not 
be the case, for many reasons. First of all, due to the 
financial conditions, because running offices is very expensive. 
Moreover, also because, today, a great number of countries have 
established a different model of diplomatic services, which we 
think will also be suitable for our state. It means that, in 
many countries, ambassadors of another friendly country in the 
region can hold our letter of accredition. Also, and perhaps the 
most frequent solution applied by Sweden for decades, slowly 
accepted by others, is to have accredited ambassadors located in 
Skopje, in the ministry. Therefore, the greatest number of 
countries will be thus covered. 
  There is another thing that we are going to make the first 
practical action, and I consider it has to be spread very much 
and very fast, which is -- the appointment of honorary consuls. 
That is the cheapest and the most efficient way to implement 
services for our citizens abroad. The honorary consuls will be 
nominated, first of all, by the citizens of the host countries, 
therefore not by our citizens living abroad. 
  [Skerlev] Nevertheless, you will agree that it is in the 
interests of Macedonia, is it not, to have real embassies in 
some countries, despite the financial restrictions.... Where 
will we have embassies? 
  [Crvenkovski] The five countries that are permanent members 
of the UN Security Council will have to have embassies, and we 
have not yet established diplomatic relations with some of them. 
Those countries are: the United States, Russia, France, Great 
Britain, and China. Germany and Japan also, of course, because 
they are countries of economic and political importance. After 
that, the countries with a great number of our people, like 
Canada and Australia, the Scandinavian countries, which will be 
most probably covered from one center, Switzerland because of 
its double role -- the bilateral relations and the relations 
with the United Nations, that is with the specialized UN 
agencies, and of course, the neighboring countries. 
  [Skerlev] In the course of this year, the validity of the 
old 
Yugoslav passports expires, and only the Macedonian passports 
will be valid. However, there are many countries, for instance 
the Latin American, African, and some Asian countries, from 
which the ministry has not received information about the 
recognition of the Macedonian passport. 
  [Crvenkovski] The ministry has received information from all 
those countries that have regulated the status of the Macedonian 
passport. It is true that some of the countries from Latin 
America and Africa have not yet regulated that status. We are 
now in contact with a greater number of those countries and we 
believe that this process will be completed in the near future. 
  At this moment, apart from a number of neighboring countries 
with which we know well the problem about our passports, it has 
been accepted by all other European countries. The Macedonian 
passport has been recognized by the United States, Canada, and 
by almost all Asian countries. Nevertheless, a number of 
countries that we are now establishing contact with have not 
sent official information, but the practice has shown that, just 
after the establishment of contacts, there are no more problems, 
and this issue is easily regulated. We are expecting the 
imminent recognition of our passport, which is perhaps above the 
average compared to the other countries that started regulating 
their status at the same time. 
  [Skerlev] How did a movie director [Crvenkovski's previous 
profession] succeed, in your opinion, in dealing with the policy 
of foreign affairs? And where do your ambitions lead -- policy, 
diplomacy, or directing? 
  [Crvenkovski] Many people with different previous 
professions 
can cope with policy. A great number of foreign ministers used 
to be chemists in their previous lives. And there are rare 
ministers who were previously engaged in professional diplomacy. 
I would not like to talk about the way I manage it. The 
directing and my present profession have, I would say, a certain 
link -- communication with people and the assessment of the 
effects on the people of communication. 
  I will, by no means, give up directing. I have come to this 
present function without any previous plans, and now, at this 
moment, the situation is such that I do not have enough time to 
plan my future. However, if I shoot a film one day, it will 
certainly not be a political film. That has been my 
determination since the days of my study, and the longer I deal 
with policy, the more I believe that my determination was right. 
<H5>  [Box, p 6] </H5>
<H5>  Macedonia on the World Map </H5>
  [Skerlev] The critics of Macedonian foreign policy, among 
other things, often use as an important argument the fact that a 
great number of countries have recognized us by the name of 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the way in which we were 
admitted to the United Nations, and they say the happiness and 
satisfaction over the admission and recognition have been 
decreased because of that. 
  [Crvenkovski] I do not know how much the satisfaction has 
been decreased, because satisfaction and emotions were not at 
stake, but it was necessary to put the Republic of Macedonia on 
the world map and to enable its function as a state! Survival 
was at stake. There are a number of organizations within the 
United Nations system without which a state cannot function, and 
those organizations regulate telecommunications, post office 
services, railways, air traffic, and if you are not a member of 
those organizations, you cannot function as a state in the 
world. You cannot travel, companies cannot include themselves in 
commercial cooperation, they cannot transport goods, banks and 
financial institutions cannot function, and the IMF is most 
important. 
  It was practically demonstrated that membership in the 
United 
Nations was of the utmost importance. 
  What is of interest from that period, for those assessments, 
as well as for relations in the foreign policy is that, from a 
period when foreign policy was attacked from all sides and with 
all possible means, and when the attacks against it were a daily 
subject in Macedonia, we have now moved to a situation in which 
the attacks are concentrated on one or two issues, and are of no 
great intensity. Therefore, if you take a look at what has been 
going on in Parliament over the past year, you will see that 
there have been no real criticism of the foreign policy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo </F>
Crvenkovski by Hajri Shaqiri; date and place not given: "A Good 
Year for Macedonia"] 
  [Text] [Shaqiri] It is the end of the year. How is 
Macedonia ending this year, in the area of foreign policy? 
  [Crvenkovski] During 1993, there have been basic changes in 
the international position of Macedonia. At the beginning of the 
year, we did not belong to international organizations and very 
few states recognized Macedonia. We had diplomatic relations 
with only a few states. At the present time, the Republic of 
Macedonia is a member of more than 30 international 
organizations , including some of the largest organizations such 
as the United Nations, and, in particular, agencies which are of 
special importance such as the organization for 
telecommunications, UNESCO, the Food and Agriculture 
Organization, and the IMF. Problems with the World Bank are 
expected to be resolved. As of now, we have diplomatic relations 
with 21 states and this number is increasing each day. I do not 
know what the number will be when this interview is published in 
the newspaper. I think that it can be said that this has been a 
successful year for Macedonia in the area of foreign policy. 
  [Shaqiri] Despite the progress which Macedonia has achieved 
so far, the problem with Greece continues to be a great, and, 
one might say, unsolvable, problem. Is this true? 
  [Crvenkovski] During past years, a number of problems have 
been created in relations between the two countries. Most of 
these problems seem irrational to a normal world. However, I 
believe that it is becoming more and more clear that obligatory 
mutual relations between Greece and Macedonia are necessary. I 
believe that the Greeks are increasingly coming to the 
conclusion that there is a need for good relations between the 
two countries. However, it is a very complex and emotional 
problem and it is hard to find a quick solution. Nevertheless, I 
believe that, because of its irrational roots, the problem can 
be resolved. 
  [Shaqiri] A large number of states have recognized 
Macedonia. 
However, there is a problem with the name. Will it win or lose 
the battle about the name? 
  [Crvenkovski] I believe that there are misinterpretations in 
regard to this problem as a result of lack of knowledge of the 
matter. The name is what it is and we never gave up on this name 
or accepted any document with any other name. 
  [Shaqiri] There is the impression that neither one of the 
parties in the conflict is making any concessions. In the 
meantime, it is said that the two parties are ready for 
compromise. If this is true, what kind of compromise are they 
talking about? 
  [Crvenkovski] If we dwell on this aspect of the problem, it 
is difficult to find any solution, so, for all practical 
purposes, it is impossible to resolve this problem. It must be 
understood that the problems are not symbolic in nature but are 
problems of relations between two countries. If things are seen 
in this light, a solution can be found. The dialog on real 
problems can result in a solution. 
  [Shaqiri] However, recently, hasn't Greece been basing its 
entire strategy on the problem with the name? 
  [Crvenkovski] This was characteristic of the past period but 
now I think that it has understood that the essence of the 
problem is relations between the two countries. 
  [Shaqiri] During your visit to Washington, you met with 
[Secretary of State] Warren Christopher. There are indications 
that the Americans are insisting on a compromise with Greece. 
Did you discuss any such thing with Christopher? 
  [Crvenkovski] I think that we should not give much credence 
to interpretations in the foreign press, in this case, the Greek 
press. The attitude of the United States from the beginning up 
to acceptance has been constant. During this time, we have had 
its support for the territorial integrity and stability of 
Macedonia. In regard to the dispute with Greece, the U.S. 
attitude is clear and it says that no one has the right to 
interfere in a country's internal affairs. At the same time, the 
Americans stress that this problem should be solved by dialog. 
  [Shaqiri] How do you explain the fact that the Americans 
have 
not recognized Macedonia yet? 
  [Crvenkovski] The recognition of a country and the 
establishment of diplomatic relations is a process which takes 
time, sometimes more and sometimes less. 
  [Shaqiri] Why has this process taken a long time for the 
Americans? 
  [Crvenkovski] It has taken a long time for rational reasons 
and we will see how long it will take. At this time, I cannot 
give any analysis of this delay. I think that the causes are 
well-known to our people. The support which we have from the 
Americans is also known. 
  [Shaqiri] Speaking of the Americans, a while back it was 
said 
that they have set up military bases in Krivolak but, recently, 
according to the Greek press, they have set up military bases in 
Kriva Pallanke, with several thousand soldiers. What is the 
truth in regard to these statements? 
  [Crvenkovski] The truth is that the Americans are 
participating in a United Nations operation in the framework of 
the mission sent by the UN. It is true that this is the first 
time that the Americans have participated in such a mission. It 
is also the first time that the UN has taken part in a mission 
of a preventive nature. This action has been evaluated by all 
the international forums as one of the most successful actions. 
It is clear that anyone who is thwarted by the operation would 
weave various tales to deny the sucess of such an action. 
  [Shaqiri] Let us try to characterize relations with 
neighboring states. Let us begin with the East: Bulgaria accepts 
Macedonia as a state but does not accept the Macedonian nation. 
What does this mean, in your opinion? 
  [Crvenkovski] Macedonia has established diplomatic relations 
with Bulgaria at the ambassadorial level. The idea of the 
nonacceptance of a nation is ridiculous to many well-informed 
people. The acceptance of a nation is something which does not 
depend on the political acts of any state. I think that this is 
an idea in which no basis for discussions can be found. The 
existence of a Macedonian nation and language is a fact which is 
accepted by world opinion. 
  [Shaqiri] In your opinion, Mr. Minister, what is the 
northern 
neighbor of Macedonia? 
  [Crvenkovski] At this time, there is an undefined situation 
in the international sphere and we, as UN members, respect the 
positions of this organization. Thus, we will go along with the 
development of events and the positions of the UN. 
  [Shaqiri] I have the impression that Macedonia does not have 
a clear position in regard to the issue of Kosovo. Are you 
satisfied with this statement? 
  [Crvenkovski] I would not be satisfied with this statement 
because Macedonia has a clear position in regard to all the 
neighboring states. This means that the foreign policy of the 
Republic of Macedonia is based on noninterference in the 
internal affairs of every state. No position could be any 
clearer than this. 
  [Shaqiri] In the recent elections in Serbia, the socialists 
won again. Is this good or bad for Macedonia and the Balkans? 
  [Crvenkovski] For Macedonia, it does not matter who wins the 
election in any state. We took this position during the Greek 
elections. The most important thing for us is for citizens of a 
state to elect the government they want. 
  [Shaqiri] It is said that Macedonia still has close ties 
with 
Serbia. Serbia is under an embargo, but various products, such 
as newspapers, come into Macedonia from this state. Can these be 
considered to be goods? 
  [Crvenkovski] We do not have any sort of ties with Serbia. 
We 
do not have any official relations. But, naturally, this is not 
good because it is in our interest to have good relations with 
all our neighbors. As for the press and literature, I think that 
a democratic state such as Macedonia is and must always be open 
to all the information media and to all ideas. 
  [Shaqiri] How would you define relations with Albania? 
  [Crvenkovski] I think that relations with Albania are 
following a positive course and this is illustrated by the early 
establishment of diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial 
level. This would mean that relations between the two countries 
are normal. Of course, here, just as everywhere in the Balkans, 
there is a collection of inherited problems and I think that 
there is no lack of willingness on the part of both sides to 
solve existing problems. 
  [Shaqiri] Albania has shown its willingness to eliminate 
visas but Macedonia has not agreed to this. Why? 
  [Crvenkovski] The visa issue is being resolved by the two 
countries. A number of problems have been raised, some of them 
in the form of recommendations which have been given to the 
Albanian side for signing. I think that many issues in the area 
of relations between the two countries will be resolved and 
settled. 
  [Shaqiri] In addition to the problems which Macedonia has in 
the area of foreign affairs, it has not completely resolved 
domestic ethnic problems. In your opinion. what would be the 
proper status of Albanians in Macedonia? 
  [Crvenkovski] I cannot respond to this question in my 
capacity as foreign minister, but I can give you my personal 
opinion. In my opinion, the only solution for problems in 
Macedonia is the strict observance of the foundation laid by the 
Constitution of Macedonia. This means that Macedonia, first of 
all, is a citizens' state and, in a citizens' state, the rights 
of all citizens are equal. 
  [Shaqiri] But what happens when it is a matter of ethnic 
groups, like the Albanians in Macedonia, who consider themselves 
to be a nation and insist on equal rights with the Macedonians? 
  [Crvenkovski] I am a member of a liberal party and I was a 
liberal even before the formation of parties in Macedonia. The 
philosophy of every liberal party in the world is based on the 
fact that the individual is more important than any sort of 
grouping and that the rights of the individual are essential to 
the profile of a state. 
  [Shaqiri] Can it be said that Macedonia has been spared, 
once 
and for all, from war? 
  [Crvenkovski] It would be hard to say this is we consider 
the 
wars which have developed in the region. The danger of the 
expansion of the war is always present. I would say that 
Macedonia has not yet escaped this danger but, at the same time, 
it has done a lot to lessen this danger. 
  [Shaqiri] What do you have to say about Zhirinovskiy's 
recent 
statement in Sofia that Macedonia should be united with 
Bulgaria? 
  [Crvenkovski] Zhirinovskiy has recentlyn made a number of 
such statements. He is still excited after the recent elections 
in Russia and one might say that he has not yet begun to think 
like a real politician. 
  [Shaqiri] Does his victory present any real danger for 
Macedonia and the Balkans? 
  [Crvenkovski] I do not think that it presents any danger for 
Macedonia but, nevertheless, it brings up some topics for 
examination.

<F P=106> [Article by V.V.A.: "The Law on the Census Is Ready, but... </F>
Fear of Politicized Count"] 
  [Text] By the end of the year, the Macedonian Assembly 
should present the law on the census. It is a very desirable 
deadline so that there will be time left over to be used for 
finishing all the preparations for carrying out the census 
planned for April 1994. 
  The text of the law has been prepared, and after its 
approval 
by the government, it will be submitted to the Assembly; two 
phases for this procedure are anticipated. 
  As everyone knows, only two years after the last census--the 
data from which are official--the government is introducing a 
new census. The reason for this is that the previous census, 
taken in 1991, does not reflect the entire statistical picture 
of the country because it was boycotted by the Albanians and 
also because of organizational weaknesses in the way the census 
was carried out. Not much time had elapsed before a number of 
Assembly representatives, mainly from the Albanian parties, 
began to inflate their figures for the Albanian population in 
Macedonia--their data differed considerably from the official 
statistics--and their missionaries strolled through various 
European associations. In a similar fashion, various parties of 
the other ethnic groups in the country had reservations and 
doubts about the data with respect to the breakdown by ethnic 
groups. As a result of all this, the Republic Institute for 
Statistics came up with the idea of introducing a new census 
with international observers and international financing, and 
this idea has been accepted. 
  At the Republic Institute for Statistics, the law has been 
treated as an entirely new project, developed on the basis of a 
number of scientific and expert consultations. When it was being 
drafted, the recommendations of the United Nations for 
population censuses, the suggestions of the expert group from 
the Committee of Deputy Ministers from the Council of Europe, as 
well as the experience of various countries were taken into 
account. 
<H5>  Taking the Census </H5>
  In contrast to the earlier law in which citizens of the 
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, foreign citizens, and 
people without citizenship who resided in Yugoslavia were 
included, in this census, it is proposed to register people who 
have an official, legal residence in Macedonia regardless of 
whether they are physically in the official place of residence 
or somewhere else in the Republic at the time of the census. 
Also to be included are those who have permission to be in 
Macedonia and who have been temporarily in Macedonia for at 
least one year, but who have a permanent place of residence 
outside Macedonia, with the exception of the refugees who have 
been staying here. On the list are also those individuals who 
have an official-legal place of residence in Macedonia, and at 
the time of the census, but for no more than one year before the 
census is taken, are engaged in work outside the country. The 
census will include those who have an official place of 
residence in the country at the time of the census but work in 
diplomatic or consular posts for Macedonia or for various United 
Nations organizations and military personnel or business 
representatives stationed abroad.... The census also takes into 
account refugees who, at the time of the census, find themselves 
on Macedonian territory and individuals who, at the time of the 
census, find themselves on Macedonian territory, irrespective of 
the reasons; citizens of the Republic who have been outside 
Macedonia for more than a year at the time of the census will be 
listed separately. 
  It is interesting to note that the expert group from the 
Council of Europe has a different attitude, according to the 
proposed resolution in the law with respect to which population 
should be counted. This group thinks that the census should 
include the entire population which habitually resides [here], 
those people who stay in a habitual place of residence in 
Macedonia, individuals who are residing anywhere in Macedonia at 
the time of the census, those who have been abroad less than one 
year, as well as those who have been staying here temporarily 
for less than one year but who have a permanent place of 
residence outside the country. 
  Despite such suggestions, the Republic Insitute for 
Statistics opted for a different solution and countered the 
other one from the expert group by citing the experience of 
numerous European countries where the census was made of the 
population which had legally lived in the country for one year. 
They explained that the habitual population--as conceived by the 
expert group--was only applicable to certain countries, and 
those have had a means to document and legally regulate entry 
and exit to and from their countries for many years. 
<H5>  Bilingual </H5>
  Before the census of 1991 was begun, the use of languages in 
taking the census was an issue that broke many a lance. Two 
variations were proposed to handle it for this census. The first 
of these is for the census to be conducted in the official 
Macedonian language with Cyrillic letters, but a person who 
belongs to a different ethnic group can be enrolled using his 
own language if he so chooses. In such a case, the form should 
also be filled out in the language of the person being 
questioned. The forms would be printed in the Macedonian 
language and in the Cyrillic alphabet and in the languages and 
alphabets of the ethnic groups. The alternative is for the 
census to be taken in the official Macedonian language with 
Cyrillic letters, but in the local administrative areas, where a 
majority or a significant number of members of an ethnic group 
live, the census would also be done in the language of the 
ethnic groups. In this case, the forms would be printed in 
Macedonian and in the language of the ethnic groups which are a 
majority or a significant number. The expert group thought that 
the alternative should be dropped, but the Republic Institute 
for Statistics believed that both variations should be presented 
to the government. 
  A new way of constituting the opstina [township] census 
commission was also proposed. In the past they had from seven to 
13 members, along with a chairman. A commission had to have 
three experts and one member each from the Macedonian 
nationality and from any ethnic group, whose members residing in 
the opstina totaled more than 1 percent of the population 
according to the 1991 census. The remaining members of the 
commission were selected in accordance with the proportion of 
the population belonging to an ethnic group compared to the 
total population of the opstina. At the same time, for each 20 
percent of a nationality or ethnic group, one member was 
elected; but a definite limit is proposed: Where the 
representation exceeds 80 percent, only two members could be 
chosen. 
  In the draft text of the law, which has 58 articles, all 
other aspects connected with the introduction of the census are 
being elaborated. At the Republic Institute for Statistics, they 
expect that it will not be necessary to have meetings to adapt 
the laws as far as technical aspects are concerned. The 
procedure could be complicated only to the extent that it is 
politicized, or if we have to re-enact the debate over the one 
in 1991. But, believing that the prevailing attitude of the 
politicians is in favor of having a census following 
international standards, the Institute hopes that such 
complications can be avoided. However, how smooth the law will 
find its way cannot be predicted by anyone, given the 
legislature's structure and the influences within it. 
<H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5>
  According to the calculations of the Republic Institute for 
Statistics, a total of $1,515,454.00 will be required to carry 
out the census. These funds must be underwritten by 
international organizations and associations. They are 
irrevocable and will be channeled regularly to the bank account 
for the census, but the law must first be passed. 
<H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5>
  In addition to verifying the exact data, the credentials of 
the census taker, and the control over the people being counted, 
the following documents are required: an entry from the birth 
certificates of the parents, marriage certificates, 
certification of residency, citizenship papers, certificates 
providing the civil registration number or personal 
identification card or travel document.... And, there is a 
difference of opinion about the law, in the case of the expert 
group. That is, the European experts think that a decision 
should be made to the effect that a person being enumerated only 
submits documents when it is necessary. The Republic Institute 
for Statistics, however, has disagreed, retaining a proviso that 
not all of these documents would be required, only the essential 
ones.

<F P=106> [Article by E. Geroski: "Why Does the Parliamentary </F>
Commission for Control Over the Activities of the SDB (State 
Security Service) Focus the Public's Attention on Itself? 
Hide-and-Seek Instead of Control?"] 
  [Text] The Parliamentary Commission for Control Over the 
Activities of the State Security Service spent the day once 
again trying to focus the public's attention on itself. The 
reason is clear, understandable, and explicable: The members of 
this parliamentary body from the opposition parties were trying 
to promote yet another public attack on the incumbent chief of 
police. And, in the name of democracy, one has to wish them luck 
in their endeavor. Why else should there be an opposition? 
  The funny story is that the opposition makes the mistake of 
feigning skill and confidence. This latest attempt is devoid of 
such attributes. Let us take, for example, the debate about the 
abolition of the Department of Security. The work was pushed to 
the forefront in a strange way. It would have been natural and 
logical for the opposition to contrive the abolition of the 
institution in whose sphere of action the personnel in favor of 
expanding the police behemoth would defend themselves (maybe the 
members of the opposition agree with this characterization). 
Unfortunately, the opposition and their rivals are running in 
entirely opposite directions. 
<H5>  Media Bomb </H5>
  But, it is not even necessary for us to penetrate the 
essentials of the debate on this question. Simply, by what logic 
and with what explanation can the "competency" of this 
commission be defended? What connection does this question have 
with the control over the activity of the SDB? To whom did it 
occur that this commission should concern itself with such a 
dilemma now when it should deal with the key mission of the 
body: the preparation of the annual report on the activity of 
the SDB?! 
  And precisely when we are approaching the task, the 
commission launches yet another little "bomb" for the media. 
[Minister of Internal Affairs] Frckovski does not want to 
receive members of the commission or enable them to look at the 
SDB's documents. By the way, three members of this commission 
from the government's side disassociated themselves from that 
announcement. That is, in spite of the fact that in this case 
the parliamentarians from that commission appeared to come 
forward with a demand: now or never! More revealing is what the 
commission implies in its protest statement, suggesting to the 
public this kind of inference: there is no report by the 
commission on the activities of the SDB just because Frckovski 
has locked the MVR [Ministry of Internal Affairs] gate against 
the members of the commission. 
<H5>  Fame and Glory </H5>
  And logically, the opposite inference can be held: If the 
parliamentarians succeed in getting into the SDB, we would get 
good quality parliamentary control (the report implies) over 
that service. This is a thesis that is difficult to swallow. We 
all remember well the time when the same commission was holding 
such meetings about the "irreparable" Frckovski and then [with 
permission] of the SDB it was looking through an account in 
which only compliments were apportioned to the service. 
  The truth lies under another bush: that parliamentary body 
does not have at its disposal either a suitable procedure or the 
instruments, or indeed the quality personnel support to conduct 
a relevant appraisal of the work of the SDB. so that afterwards 
the public would say calmly: Well, that's that! And instead, the 
parliamentarians, especially those from the opposition, instead 
of solving the real problems, played hide-and-seek games and 
created celebrity and a martyr's halo above their own heads. 
  Out of this entire confusion, only one overwhelming fact 
will 
remain: Macedonia is left without effective parliamentary 
control over the intelligence-defense structure in the 
government!

<F P=106> [Interview with Miliam Fejziu, chairman of the Democratic </F>
Forum for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms, by 
Abdylnaser Sinani on 1 December 1993; place of interview not 
given: "The Rights of Albanians Are Not a Minority Issue"] 
  [Excerpts] Ever since it began its activity three 
years ago, the Democratic Forum for the Defense of Human Rights 
and Freedoms [FDMDLNJ] has investigated and provided evidence of 
a multitude of cases of violation of rights and freedoms of 
Albanians in Macedonia and has continued to inform international 
organizations in this area. By means of the photographs provided 
by the Democratic Forum, international public opinion has been 
informed about violations of human rights and freedoms in 
Macedonia and international convictions and opinions have been 
formed on the basis of this information. International Human 
Rights and Freedoms Day, 1 December, served as an occasion for 
us to talk with Miliam Fejziu, the chairman of the Democratic 
Forum. [passage omitted] 
  [Sinani] Is International Human Rights Day a good time for 
an 
institutional overview of human rights and freedoms here in 
Macedonia? 
  [Fejziu] [passage omitted] It must be said that Albanians in 
Macedonia are mistreated and even when Albanians are in the 
majority they are dominated by the Macedonian minority. In these 
cases, it is not a matter of the violation of the rights and 
freedoms of the Albanians but of constant repression. Albanians 
are mistreated in the health system, in education, in the armed 
forces, in the press, and in politics. The current Macedonian 
government has the political will to destroy the cultural and 
historical heritage of the Albanian people. Physical force has 
been used against Albanians in Macedonia and there are 
increasing cases of psychological and physical mistreatment, 
beatings and raids, detention and imprisonment for 
transgressions and penal acts, and even loss of life without the 
necessary official explanations of the government organs. Since 
this interview is taking place on International Human Rights 
Day, it is appropriate for me to stress that the issue of the 
juridical and political position [of the Albanians] does not lie 
solely in the human rights sphere. Upto now, Europe and the 
United Nations have been treating the issue of Albanians in 
Macedonia improperly, as a matter of concern for an institute 
for human rights and freedoms in the framework of minority 
mechanisms. 
  [Sinani] What are the work methods of the Democratic Forum 
and how does this forum actually operate? 
  [Fejziu] During the past three years, despite the fact that 
it did not have sufficient experience in work methods, the 
Democratic Forum used the contacts established with sister 
organizations, especially the councils for human rights in 
Kosovo and in Albania, and its cooperation with international 
organizations, to create the methodology to accompany cases of 
violations of rights and freedoms. During this period, one of 
the main tasks was the collection of documentation of the cases 
and events brought about by the Macedonian government which 
resulted in flagrant violations against the Albanian population, 
denying them their rights as individuals and their collective 
rights. Among the most flagrant violations of rights, the 
Democratic Forum cited the cases occurring in Ladorisht, Dibra, 
and Bit Pazar, the events in the Idrizova and Shutka jails, the 
arrest and detention of several Albanians in the recent weapons 
case. The necessary documentation was collected on all these 
cases and presented to public opinion in the country and in the 
world. It should be emphasized that, after the Bit Pazar case, 
the Democratic Forum presented documents to the regional 
prosecutor's office dealing with transgressions carried out by 
representatives of the Ministry of Interior of Macedonia, 
pointing out that a large number of representatives of this 
ministry, headed by Minister Ferchkovski, took part in these 
transgressions. Although the documents were submitted in March, 
so far, the regional prosecutor's office has remained silent, 
even after several communications in writing. We are not 
demanding a positive response but we would like evidence, a 
response which we will be able to use in an appeal to the 
International Court in The Hague. 
  [Sinani] The photographic exhibition held in honor of 
International Human Rights Day and the videocassettes dealing 
with special events give the impression that in Macedonia, three 
years after the arrival of the democratic processes, the rights 
and freedoms of the Albanians are still being seriously 
violated. 
  [Fejziu] This is the first time that the Democratic Forum 
has 
organized a presentation of the documentation collected during 
the three-year period, for the general public, in which the most 
extensive violations of rights and freedoms of Albanians, both 
individual and collective, can be seen. This documentation 
contradicts the assertion of the current government that 
Albanains in Macedonia have more rights than they deserve. It 
should be stressed that this is the evaluation of the Macedonian 
government while we have the case of the atrocious strangulation 
of Halil Halili from Gercec in Skopje and the strangulation of 
Nazmi Jusufi from Luboteni in Skopje, who were strangled in the 
police station along with two cases where Albanians were 
murdered in prison with the explanation that they committed 
suicide or died from heart attacks. This documentation clearly 
shows that Albanians are being deprived of their lives so that 
this government will be able to continue the repression which it 
is carrying out against the Albanians and so as to create the 
image of Albanians as a destabilizing element and, on the other 
hand, to present itself to the Albanian population as a strong 
force which must be obeyed. 
  [Sinani] According to what you have said, it seems that the 
Albanians are the only ones whose human rights are being 
violated. 
  [Fejziu] During the three years of activity of the 
Democratic 
Forum, in addition to the violations against Albanians, we also 
found proof of some instances of violation of the rights and 
freedoms of Turks in Macedonia, such as the case in Zhupa in 
Dibra. where Turkish pupils are not allowed to have their mother 
tongue as the language of instruction. The Democratic Forum 
reported this situation promptly. 
  [Sinani] You believe that both the collective and the 
individual rights of Albanians in Macedonia are being violated 
and denied. In which areas of life is this situation most 
serious? 
  [Fejziu] The current repression which the Macedonian 
government is exerting against the Albanians is a continuation 
of the anti-Albanian policy inherited from the past. At present, 
Albanians in all the lands of the former Yugoslavia are 
experiencing a grave denial of human rights and freedoms. 
Albanians in Macedonia are subject to unprecedented 
discrimination in all spheres of life, especially in education, 
in the media, and in the institutions of the system. Many 
foreign observers who have been here report on the flagrant 
violation of the basic human rights and freedoms of the 
Albanians. For example, in the area of culture, Albanians are 
not allowed to found institutions or bodies which would preserve 
their cultural heritage. The goal is for Albanians to lose their 
cultural identity as a collective in Macedonia. 
  [Sinani] How does the Democratic Forum cooperate with 
political subjects and associations in Macedonia and with 
international organizations in this domain? 
  [Fejziu] We must say that cooperation with political and 
nonpolitical subjects in Macedonia is not at the level required 
by current needs. There is a need for closer cooperation because 
the Democratic Forum, in the documentation which it prepares on 
a regular basis, has kept the Albanian associations informed and 
has asked for assistance in solving various cases but, often, 
this cooperation has been lacking. One of the main tasks of the 
Democratic Forum is to expose the repressive policy of the 
current Macedonian government since our political subjects have 
not fully exploited the policy of the government. It is 
essential that this cooperation be raised to a higher level and 
there must be a more serious approach to the problem of the 
political-juridical position of the Albanians in Macedonia. We 
can say that cooperation with international human rights 
organizations is fruitful and close. We have been able to have 
frequent contacts with delegations of international 
organizations such as Amnesty International in London, the 
International Federation for Human Rights in Frankfurt, Helsinki 
Watch and the Free Foundation of the American Congress, and the 
European Assembly for Human Rights.... We cooperate with these 
organizations in various forms, by sending delegations out in 
the field to get information on specific occurrences and by 
providing information to these organizations. On the basis of 
this cooperation, recently, the violations of rights and 
freedoms of Albanians in Macedonia have been included in the 
annual reports of a number of international organizations. When 
these reports are sent to the government of Macedonia, the 
government either rejects them as untrue or denies them in their 
entirety. International organizations have often protested this 
behavior through official channels in Macedonia but the 
Macedonian government continues to ignore these reports. 
  [Sinani] Recently, there has been a decline in the activity 
of the Democratic Forum, which was noted in its annual report. 
What are its causes? 
  [Fejziu] We are only partially satisfied with the activity 
of 
the Democratic Forum because during the past year the Forum's 
activity has decreased, both on the organizational level and on 
the functional level. During this period, there were concrete 
tasks but they were not all carried out. This situation must be 
corrected by a reinvigoration of the leadership of the Forum and 
of other activists.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Georgi Ajanovski: "What Is Athens Afraid of?"] </F>
  [Text] The situation in Macedonian-Greek relations has been 
at a stand-still for some time now, and both sides are going on 
with their mutual accusations about unpreparedness to solve the 
disputed questions. In the light of the great importance that 
these relations have for the wider stability in the region, the 
West is continually insisting on a speedier solution of the 
disputes and on normal cooperation. In doing that, one must bear 
in mind that Greece, as the farthest part of the European Union, 
has a special role in this region in assisting and facilitating 
the Macedonian options for approaching Europe. Without the 
establishment of more stable communications between the two 
states, it is impossible to make any attempts at a further 
process of Balkan consolidation. 
  Totally aware of the importance of such a cooperation, 
Macedonia never misses the opportunity of expressing its 
readiness for a mutual dialogue with Athens. It believes there 
are no problems that cannot be solved if there is good will, and 
that the best and most efficient way, tested and affirmed in 
international practice, is to sit at a negotiating table and 
review all the disputable questions between the two states, 
without any prejudices. 
  The greater number of the hitherto Macedonian initiatives 
have, unfortunately, remained without an answer from Athens. The 
Greek side, hesitating and laden with various nationalist 
prejudices, is simply exhausted when looking for excuses; thus, 
it is conditioning the dialogue with unilateral requests that, 
from the aspect of international relations, are totally 
groundless and unjustified, and their treatment depends on the 
will and readiness of both sides. Those requests are imposed by 
the internal political and propaganda needs of Greece for which 
the Papandreu government tried to urge European support, but in 
their essence they can only be solved with the agreement of the 
two states. 
  The Athens government is not ready to face that fact, 
although it has become perfectly clear that it does not have any 
other choice. At this moment, the most bitter problem of the 
ruling Greek group is making that known to its own people. 
  The requests made hitherto by Greece also prove it to be 
true. Once it requested the rejection of the name Macedonia, 
then it suggested prefixes to that name (the Greek propaganda 
itself has prepared a whole list of proposals: Vardar, North, 
Central-Balkan, Slav, New Macedonia and so on), now it mentions 
the state symbols, the borders, the Macedonian Constitution. All 
this discrepancy and uncertainty in the Greek policy has a 
common characteristic: fear or shame to admit an unavoidable 
fact! To admit something it has ignored for decades, something 
it presented as a nonexistent and manufactured question, as an 
artificial state, a manufactured state, a manufactured language, 
a fabricated history and culture. However, it is aware that 
admitting these facts will mean uncovering other questions that 
it has been hiding. 
  The method of unilateral conditions and dictates, as a bad 
excuse for postponing dialogue and for blaming the "unyielding 
Skopje" and the "stubborn Gligorov," has evidently become stale 
and counterproductive. There are few in the world who can 
believe in such cheap tricks. The reputation of Greek policy has 
been devaluated to such an extent that even its closest allies 
are worried and placed in an awkward position. Their efforts to 
place Athenian foreign policy on normal European tracks are not 
hidden. It did not pass the first test in the dispute with 
Macedonia: the test of democracy! 
  The Macedonian policy, nevertheless, believes in a positive 
outcome. It firmly believes that Athens will become more 
realistic and gather enough strength to overcome the passions. 
However, one must not forget that the Macedonian leadership has 
also not been spared from various internal pressures and 
resistances. The strength of a policy is assessed by the 
realization of great goals, by the main and the real interests 
of the people. No one can ask anybody to be nationally 
humiliated and betrayed, and nobody has the right to keep 
nations in conflict and without mutual respect and 
understanding. The hitherto policy of the two states, aside from 
spreading mutual mistrust and hostility, has not produced 
anything good for either state. Sincere and overall cooperation 
between them will, in any case, be of greater value not only for 
the two states, but it will also demonstrate that the Balkans 
are fed up with divisions. 
  In order to achieve all this, discussions are necessary. 
Without mutual disdain, without conditions from a position of 
power. History does not recall any dispute solved without mutual 
compromises. The other alternative is violence: The stronger 
wins the dispute. However, that is the philosophy of war. 
Macedonia has had too many experiences with such justice 
throughout its history. For the first time now, as a member of 
the United Nations, it is in a position to conduct equal 
negotiations and decide on its own destiny. This is the only 
status it can have in the dispute with Greece. 
  The moment that they sit at a negotiating table will reveal 
who is more ready for negotiations, for a successful solution of 
the disputes, for the possibilities of mutual compromise and 
concessions. In a direct dialogue, it will not be enough only to 
deliver personal requests, but discussion of the requests and 
remarks of the other side will also be needed. The terminology 
of the United Nations and International Law states: dialogue 
between equal partners. 
  Certainly, the problems that have piled up over decades will 
not be solved overnight. Nevertheless, the basic thing is that 
both sides start negotiations with the wish for success, in 
order to realize principles of mutual confidence that will 
establish a climate conducive to results. 
  Then the problems regarding the symbols, the flag, the 
borders, and the Constitution will be treated adequately, as 
will, for instance, the question about various discriminatory 
laws toward Macedonia and the Macedonians that are still valid 
with our southern neighbor, and that represent an anachronism in 
modern international law, such as the problems of human rights 
and liberties in which lie the framework are minority rights, 
the property rights of its one- time citizens of Macedonian 
origin, the bans they are exposecd to when they try to visit 
their birthplaces, the destruction of historical and cultural 
monuments of non-Hellenistic character, whose protection and 
maintainance have been proclaimed in UN acts. 
  These are, briefly, only some of the disputed questions 
between the two states that require solutions, and today or 
tomorrow, the governments of Macedonia and Greece will have to 
sit down and agree if they wish to establish modern, civilized, 
democratic solutions to their mutual relations, or, to be more 
precise: if they want to enter modern-day Europe. 
  Macedonia has chosen that road and it believes it is the 
right one. It expects support from Greece and wants to have 
friendly relations with it. It is ready for a dialogue on an 
equal footing. Perhaps athens will reply tomorrow. Let us hope 
it will be a positive reply.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic </F>
Union of Vojvodina Hungarians, by Ferenc Kepecs in Budapest on 
29 January: "The Dialogue Has Become Public"] 
  [Text] [Kepecs] How do you evaluate Foreign Minister Geza 
Jeszenszky's recent visit in Belgrade? 
  [Agoston] This visit took place at a time when we succeeded 
in taking a big step forward in starting a dialogue between the 
Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK] and the Serbian 
Government. This visit confirmed the achievement and made it 
public in an interstate sense as well. This visit is also 
important because it is becoming increasingly clear that the 
international community is actually helpless regarding the 
Yugoslav crisis. Under these circumstances, we must create the 
conditions for Hungary to have advantageous contacts with Serbia 
after the lifting of the embargo, particularly in the economic 
sphere. After all, we are talking about neighboring countries 
and the relations between neighbors are sensitive irrespective 
of the international situation. 
  [Kepecs] Has this visit made the Serb policy legitimate, a 
policy condemned by the entire world? 
  [Agoston] Under circumstances when the international 
community is completely helpless, the visit of the foreign 
minister of a neighboring country, a visit dealing mainly with 
practical issues, does not affect the legitimacy issue. Only 
the international community can efficiently declare everything 
that happened in the past years as legitimate or illegitimate. 
  [Kepecs] But there are also Hungarian grievances involved 
here! At the talks, Milosevic said that his government would 
not tolerate a situation in which anyone has to leave his 
birthplace. In the meantime, many Hungarians in Croatia who were 
driven out by Serbs are still not able to return to their homes! 
  [Agoston] All I can say to this is that this issue must be 
solved at interstate talks. We accept the fact that the 
Democratic Union of Croatian Hungarians is the authority to 
decide on this matter. As far as I know, they work efficiently 
on making it possible for the refugees to return to their homes. 
  [Kepecs] Has Jeszenszky's visit changed anything on the 
situation of Hungarians who fled to Hungary from military 
conscription, people who still should not return home? 
  [Agoston] According to the VMDK, no one should be put into a 
disadvantageous position or on trial for refusing to participate 
in the civil war as a citizen of small Yugoslavia. If the 
recent domestic policy changes continue, changes that are 
positive for us, we can hope that it will be declared in the 
form of a state act that everyone can return without fear of 
reprisals. 
  [Kepecs] Mr. Agoston! Do you agree with the opinion 
according to which Serbia has come out as a victor in this civil 
war? 
  [Agoston] From the very beginning, we have been saying that 
we do not want to interfere in the historic debate of these 
people. This is only natural in our situation and the events 
proved that our position was correct. Of course, we can have 
individual opinions but, as the chairman of the VMDK, I would 
not like to speak about this.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stelio Papathemelis, minister of public </F>
order of Greece, by Filip Cakuli; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Cakuli] Mr. Minister, as a member of the new Greek 
Government, how do you evaluate relations with neighboring 
Albania? 
  [Papathemelis] Greece's relations with Albania certainly 
should develop in the framework of good-neighborliness, 
especially after the decision of the former PASOK [Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement] government to remove the state of war. 
Good-neighborliness means, first of all, good faith, mutual 
confidence, and friendly cooperation. Also it means the 
recognition of the rights of existing minorities, which are a 
result of international conventions. The new Greek Government is 
fully predisposed to develop relations with Albania, on the 
foundation of good-neighborliness. However, it considers the 
following as basic conditions: not only the legal and formal 
recognition of the rights of the Greek minority in Albania but, 
first of all, their actual implementation in all spheres of 
life: religion, language, education, local government, and so 
forth. It is also important to avoid actions and statements that 
might have negative effects on and consequences for relations 
among states. Greece steadfastly desires normal relations with 
Albania but, at the same time, it will determinedly and 
unrelentingly defend the rights of the Greek minority in 
Albania. 
  [Cakuli] You recently visited Albania with a group of 
deputies from the Greek parliament. What are your impressions 
from this visit? 
  [Papathemelis] My impressions of Albania are of a country 
which is trying, with great difficulties, to rise above some 
very great economic and social problems inherited from the past. 
I am hoping for the victory of those political and social forces 
which are seeking a peaceful and democratic future for Albania, 
those forces which are predisposed to respect the political and 
personal rights of all the residents of Albania, regardless of 
their origin, Albanians, Greeks, or people of any other origin. 
Of course, I am disturbed when I see some forces which are 
trying to penetrate even into the official political opinion of 
a friendly country, seeking to cultivate disagreements with one 
of the countries with which Albania has a border -- Greece. 
  [Cakuli] One of the greatest concerns for our two countries 
is the problem of the Albanian refugees in Greece. As a result 
of a deterioration in relations between the two countries, there 
was a massive return of Albanian refugees by your side. The 
support and employment of these refugees, who were forced to 
emigrate because of difficulties, constitute valuable assistance 
which Greece and its people gave and are giving to Albania. Our 
high officials, especially the president of the Republic, have 
expressed gratitude for this publicly, both inside and outside 
the country. The previous government talked about legalizing 
their status and the two sides have talked but the issue has not 
yet been resolved. What do you think about this matter and what 
do you think could be done to resolve it? 
  [Papathemelis] I would say that it is not quite like that 
and 
perhaps it is just the opposite. Thus, it is not a matter of a 
mass return of illegal refugees as a result of tension in 
relations between the two sides but just the opposite: Every 
time that Greece is forced to send back to Albanian territory 
those criminal elements which penetrate into the ranks of 
illegal refugees, Albania causes tension in bilateral relations, 
with accusations and threats which, fortunately, Greece does not 
regard seriously. Instead of accepting the emigration to Greece 
of thousands of its desperate residents, Albania would be better 
off to cooperate with the Greek Government, which is ready to 
grant economic and technical assistance to Albania, assistance 
that would contribute to the resolution of the social problem in 
your country. The gratitude of the Albanian side, which you 
mentioned, for the real reception which Greece has given to all, 
should not be accompanied by measures, for example in education, 
in regard to the church, and so forth, which do not show the 
respect required by international norms of law. Nevertheless, 
the Greek Government is ready to resolve this issue in the best 
way possible, in accordance with democratic views on human 
rights and (it goes without saying) the protection of the mutual 
interests of the two countries. 
  Note: The editorial board of RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE has 
its objections to this interview. It expresses its thanks to Mr. 
Stelio Papathemelis for his readiness and it is open to the 
expression of opinions regarding this interview, while wishing 
for the constructive development of Albanian-Greek 
relations.

1993, at the invitation of the Sejm Presidium, a delegation of 
deputies arrived from Albania. They are members of a workers' 
deputies group from the council of the People's Republic of 
Albania and include: Deputy Shaban Memia, of the Albanian 
Democratic Party (APD) in Tirana, who was chairman of the 
delegation; Deputy Simon Puta (AFD); Deputy Nevrus Cela (APD); 
Deputy Ethem Ruka (Albanian Socialist Party); Deputy Roland 
Tafili (APD); and Deputy Skender Gjinushi (Social Democratic 
Party). 
  On 15 December, the guests were received by Sejm Speaker 
Jozef Zych, and on this occasion they underscored the value and 
pleasure of their visit and their opportunities for deepening 
their knowledge of the extensive structural changes made in 
Poland. The chairman of the delegation expressed his belief that 
their stay in Poland would begin a process of cooperation 
between both parliaments and countries and said that one of the 
goals should be for a Polish group to visit Albania and call for 
bilateral groups in both parliaments. 
  The Albanian deputies held talks with the heads of the 
following committees: Foreign Affairs, Constitutional 
Responsibility, Legislation, Privatization, and the National 
Assembly Constitutional Commission. 
  The delegation met with the leadership of the SLD 
[Democratic 
Left Alliance], UD [Democratic Union], and UP [Union of Labor] 
parliamentary clubs. 
  The deputy chief of the Sejm Chancellery, Director General 
Wojciech Popkowski, briefed the deputies on the legislative 
process, the Sejm's Rule of Procedure, and the powers of the 
State Tribunal. 
  Janusz Ziolkowski, secretary of state and chief of the 
Presidential Chancellery, and Iwo Byczewski, deputy secretary of 
state in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, discussed the 
prospects for developing bilateral relations with Albanian 
members of parliament. Clarification of some of the aspects of 
the Balkan situation were also discussed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by E. Sadiku: "Albania Has Violated the Embargo </F>
Against Serbia and Montenegro"] 
  [Text] Belgrade, 23 December -- At a session of the Chamber 
of Deputies of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] 
Federative Parliament, a deputy of this chamber, Mr. Petricevic, 
said that citizens of Montenegro have received oil from Albania, 
from the port of Durres, and the largest quantities were sent to 
the Serbs in Bosnia or, more exactly, were sent to Bijeljina, a 
city in which more than 50 percent of the residents are Muslims. 
Deputy Petricevic said, among other things, that when he was in 
this city he saw several tanker trucks carrying oil, which, 
during the time that international sanctions against the FRY are 
continuing, was being transported from the bay of Durres. 
  If this is true, then it must be said that the Albanian 
Government, or, rather, the Albanian state, has seriously 
violated international norms, has gravely betrayed its country 
and its people within and outside the country, and has given 
direct aid to the expansionist, hegemonistic policy of the 
Serbian occupier in Bosnia and elsewhere. We would have liked 
not to believe the words of federative deputy Petricevic but, 
unfortunately, he spoke the truth because, so far, no one has 
contradicted him.

<F P=106> [Interview with Fatos Bitincka, minister of transportation </F>
and telecommunications of the Republic of Albania, by Goli 
Trebeshina in Tirana; date not given: "Economic Reform in 
Transportation"] 
  [Text] [Trebeshina] After Albania's many years of isolation 
and after many disasters in the transition period, one of the 
sectors of the economy which has frequent and extensive contact 
with Europe is that of automobile, sea, and air transport. Mr. 
Minister, what are some of the achievements so far in the 
implementation of the reform according to contemporary 
requirements? How is privatization proceeding and are there 
still some problems to be resolved? 
  [Bitincka] Because of the limited investments in this branch 
in comparison to industry and agriculture, transportation and 
communications suffered more from the socialist system of 
centralization and from the many years of isolation. The sector 
is on a much lower level than it is in any other country of 
Eastern Europe. It inherited a serious backwardness and a very 
grave situation in the respective infrastructures, in the means 
of transportation and in the machinery and eqipment in the 
workshops. About one-third of the roads which are under the 
administration of our ministry are asphalted and half of these 
were asphalted 20 years ago. More than 90 percent of the 
existing railroad tracks have wooden crosspieces. As a result, 
the technical-utilization indicators and the speed of the trains 
are extremely low. Rinas Airport has depreciated. The landing 
strip is seriously damaged and must be reconstructed immediately 
since there is a danger that it will deteriorate rapidly with an 
increase in air traffic. During the transition period, serious 
damage was caused to the means of transportation, especially the 
passenger cars and the freight cars which are used for 
transporting goods outside the country, as well as the buses, 
the ships of the merchant fleet, the lighting equipment in the 
airport, the telephone communication lines, and so forth. The 
democratic government has made it possible for the 
transportation system to contact Europe, first of all. This is 
the result of the establishment of a strategy and activity with 
a rapid effect, which is part of the application of the economic 
reform through the restructuring of enterprises, the initiation 
of privatization, the encouragement of new private activities 
and cooperation with a number of countries in the preparation of 
transportation agreements. The restructuring of enterprises and 
of transportation sectors brought, first of all, reform, which 
was accompanied by the division, downsizing, and breaking up of 
enterprises and activities. At the beginning of 1993, 28 percent 
of the enterprises were restructured by the reform process. Some 
eight joint enterprises were created. Along with the 
restructuring, provisions were made for public assistance for 
workers in all the enterprises which suffered a reduction in the 
number of workers and in excessive and unproductive 
administrative personnel and there was also a decrease in the 
main activity in some sectors, such as in the railroad sector 
because of reduced need to transport ores, and so forth. Thus, 
37 percent of the workers in the [transportation] system are on 
public assistance. Privatization is the main objective of the 
economic reform in transportation. During the two years of the 
reform, in the automobile transport sector, the vehicles of the 
taxi service for goods and passengers have been privatized. 
Currently, the services of agencies in the sea transport sector 
are privatized. The implementation, step by step, of the 
measures for economic reform and the utilization of corridors in 
the country by the transportation system have developed many 
transportation sectors, at quite high levels. Compared with the 
situation three years ago, the number of vehicles in automobile 
transport in the country as a whole has quadrupled; sailings in 
our ports have increased from three or four a month to five or 
six a day; air traffic has increased fourfold. The number of 
automobiles transiting Albania has increased about 35 times. The 
development of the transportation has made it possible to employ 
a number of workers. This number is expected to be three to four 
times the number of those receiving public assistance. 
  [Trebeshina] On what criteria was the administrative 
institutional reform in your ministry based and have any party 
criteria been placed above the criteria of ability and 
professional skills? 
  [Bitincka] The administrative reform in the ministry was 
carried out on the basis of tasks set by the government, in a 
very tight and constrained budgetary situation. In this 
framework, we tried -- while setting as a final goal the 
establishment of an able staff for the purpose of responding to 
the great and new demands which must be confronted in this 
sector -- to coordinate skilled and experienced specialists who 
have worked in difficult sectors of transportation with young 
cadres who are taken from the whirlpool of transportation. As a 
result of the restructuring of the apparatus, 68 percent of the 
jobs were recycled. I believe that the staff carried out a 
number of tasks in accordance with specified objectives and that 
this was the basis for bringing about an administrative and 
institutional reform in accordance with the new criteria of the 
market economy. 
  [Trebeshina] Rinas Airport, the Tirana-Durres highway, the 
seaport of Durres are all coveted by foreigners or.... What 
concrete investments will be made? Have sources of financing for 
the transportation infrastructures been obtained and what place 
does Albania occupy in the meeting of the Group of 24 countries 
in which you are participating? 
  [Bitincka] The rapid development of transportation and, in 
particular, the heavy traffic, require investments in the 
backward infrastructure. The implementation of the economic 
reform and of competition concretize the possibility of 
obtaining souces of financing from abroad. In these projects, we 
making the final preparations to make it possible to begin 
obtaining financing from abroad, such as, in the first 
transportation projects, from the World Bank and the Kuwait Fund 
for the rehabilitation of the highway system, the rehabilitation 
of the seaport of Durres, and also for the initial work on the 
construction of the Tirana-Durres highway, with contemporary 
parameters. The meeting held in Brussels, especially for 
Albania, was for the purpose of holding discussions with 
international financial bodies, various states to obtain support 
for a medium-term program for 1991-96 in projects identified in 
the transportation sector, which are included in the priority 
projects of the country. 
  [Trebeshina] At the Qafa e Thanes customs control point we 
have often seen cars waiting in line for hours and even days. 
How can speedier and more effective movement be achieved? What 
are the obstacles and who should assume responsibility for this? 
  [Bitincka] This is a real problem. There is need for action 
as soon as possible, along with the possibilities which have 
been created for opening border control points in Bllate and 
Tushemisht, in Diber and Pogradec districts, respectively. With 
the sparse funds in our budget, we have begun some very 
necessary work, but, for the future, if the necessary funds are 
obtained for financing, investments are earmarked for widening 
the narrow transit points in accordance with contemporary 
requirements. 
  [Trebeshina] After the 22 March elections, the democratic 
government transferred the posts and telecommunications sector 
to your ministry. Was this sector a bonus or...? 
  [Bitincka] In my opinion, the democratic government, which 
took over the management of the country in a very serious 
economic crisis, combined sectors in a very tight budgetary 
situation dictated by the economic reform. It was thought that 
it would be best to combine this sector with the transportation 
sector. 
  [Trebeshina] There is a lot of talk about corruption. What 
is 
the situation in the sector which you head? 
  [Bitincka] This matter has been at the center of attention 
in 
our activity. We have tried to draft, approve, and promulgate 
the appropriate regulations, ordinances, and criteria for the 
examination of activities, projects, and other issues which have 
been the objects of activity in the transportation sector. 
Important issues and basic problems have been the subject of 
roundtable discussions, combatting the tendency to avoid 
discussing undesirable phenomena in our sectors. 
  [Trebeshina] Recently, the democratic government drafted and 
approved a medium-term program for the development of the 
economy during the 1993-96 period. What is the place of the 
transportation and posts and telecommunications sector in this 
program? 
  [Bitincka] In the medium-term program stipulated by the 
democratic government, transportation is a priority branch of 
the economy. Therefore, it is in a key place and is given its 
proper value, after being underappreciated in the socialist 
system during the past 50 years.

<F P=106> [Article by Dylejman Karaj: "Another Year of Growth"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Many experts in the country and the rest of the 
world believe that the present and future well-being of the 
Albanians lies in the subsoil, agriculture, and tourism. Their 
development, on the basis of the concepts of the capitalist 
market economy, will be priorities for the economic development 
of the country, without denying the positive role played by 
trade and construction. Now, at the conclusion of the second 
year of democratic government, it is very significant that these 
three fields of economic development have registered increases. 
Statistics are more eloquent that any propaganda of orators, 
since they do not allow you to depart from reality and they 
clearly show the development of Albania on the basis of the 
program of the Albanian Democratic Party. 
<H5>  The Voice of Progress From the Subsoil </H5>
  The figures are higher at the end of this year, compared to 
1992, for all the mines and the processing industry. For 
example, compared to the same period in 1992, the Chrome 
Corporation had, for the 10-month period, some 1,939,455,000 
leks' worth of goods sold, or 617,758,000 more than in 1992 -- a 
147 percent increase. Before the end of the year, the Copper 
Corporation had 1,295,822,000 leks' worth of goods sold, or 
167,643,000 leks more than last year -- a 115 percent increase. 
The work continues without interruption. The Petroleum 
Corporation had 6,386,541,000 leks' worth of petroleum sold for 
the period from January to the end of October 1993, 
2,082,745,000 more than in 1992 -- a 148 percent increase. 
Elektro-Energjetika is coming into the new year with 735,521,000 
more leks' worth of product sold than in the first year of the 
democratic government. The demarcation line between the 
communist hell and the free and rich life is 22 March 1992. 
[passage omitted] 
  In 1993, 24,889 more metric tons of petroleum, 7,882 more 
tons of gas, 13 tons, or 117 percent more lubricating oil, and 
13,162 more tons, or 126 percent more distilled fuel oil were 
processed than in 1992. Other petroleum subproducts such as 
petroleum pitch and petroleum coke also registered increases of 
6,544 tons and 7,895 tons, respectively. This has been a good 
year for the chrome mines, which are the treasures of the 
Albanian subsoil, along with the petroleum and copper resources. 
Some 5,156 more tons of 41.6 percent enriched chrome and 11,356 
more tons of carbonic ferrochrome were produced in 1993 than in 
1992. And what about the copper mines? Some 6,141 more tons of 
concentrate, 426 more tons of blister copper, and 204.2 more 
tons of copper wire and cables than in 1992. There was also an 
increase in the production of electric power, caustic soda, 
glass products, fabrics, knitted goods, clothing, plastic 
products, and so forth. 
<H5>  New Investments of the Democratic Government </H5>
  In the area of investments, the team of the Ministry of 
Mines 
and Mineral Resources, headed by Abdyl Xhaja, worked in 
accordance with the program and the economic platform of the 
democratic government. Thus, in the sectors covered by this 
ministry, some 432.3 million of the planned 562.7 million leks 
were invested in only nine months. Some 116.8 million leks were 
invested in oil drilling and prospecting and we have 101.8 
million leks for geological prospecting. [passage omitted] 
  During the year, considerable investment funds were devoted 
to the construction of roads connecting the mines to residential 
centers, cities, and villages. Some 32.7 leks were invested for 
more than 12 segments of roads, 103 percent more than in 1992. 
About 28.2 million leks, more than the planned amount, have been 
invested for the modernization of some wells and other annexes 
in the main mines of the country, for the purpose of increasing 
production and creating new work places. 
<H5>  New Work Places Are Being Created </H5>
  For the mineral processing and mining industry, the year 
1993 
saw an increase in the creation of new work places, although not 
to the extent which is possible for this priority field of our 
economy. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that more people 
got jobs in the industry in 1993 than in 1992. As of 1993, about 
103,507 people are employed in enterprises of the mining 
industry, including the budgetary and nonbudgetary sector. In 
addition to the wage fund of 2,802,038,000 leks, the democratic 
state has given these workers an additional 570,897,000 leks in 
compensation, for the purpose of relieving and alleviating the 
social problems which are a natural result of the implementation 
of economic reform.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Muharrem Seseri: "The Publication of Maps Is </F>
Culture"] 
  [Text] The technical-engineering personnel of the Army 
Topographical Institute should be thanked for publishing a road 
map of Albania. We hope that this map will be followed by others 
to fill in the gaps in Albanian cartography. We know that every 
map, in addition to the subject matter which it treats, also has 
a political influence. For example, in the bookstores of Skopje, 
Macedonians were selling their maps which included all of Lake 
Ohrid and two lakes in Prespa. But the Greeks are producing, and 
even bringing into Albania maps on which their border extends as 
far as Lake Shkumbi. The road map was prepared and published 
this year. Therefore, it is unexplainable why the name of the 
state to the north and northeast of Albania continues to be 
listed as "Yugoslavia," when it is known that the republic of 
Kosova has been recognized by the Albanian parliament. The 
presentation on our geographic maps of the places of residence 
of Albanians is a patriotic necessity. Today, when a number of 
states are taking action for the defense of Kosovo, we should be 
doing more. Concretely, the road map published by the Army 
Topographical Institute should include all of Kosovo. Indeed, 
Cameria [part of southern Albania which is under Greek rule] 
should also be included in a map of all the Albanian lands. In 
the mileage tables, there is no reason why the distance to 
Pristina, Gjakovo, Tetovo, or Filati should not be shown. The 
republic of Macedonia has been recognized by the Albanian state 
but the map published by Albanians in Tirana ignores this name! 
Thanks to democracy, Albanians now move freely and do business 
outside the Balkans. The maps could show the routes which they 
could take and give comparative mileage. As soon as possible, 
maps should be published for foreign businessmen and tourists. A 
prepublication review would improve their content and appearance.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Markovic: "Air Defense of the Republic of </F>
Srpska Ready for Attack; Respond to Fire With Fire"] 
  [Text] The military of the republic of Srpska have the 
powerful "Kub" and "Volhov" missile systems, which are effective 
at altitudes up to 30 kilometers. U.S. officers compare military 
action in Bosnia to searching for a needle in a haystack, but 
Serbian commanders see it as an adventure endangering the entire 
region. 
  The latest threats of military intervention and NATO air 
strikes did not surprise the military of the republic of Srpska. 
The military air defense of this youngest Serbian republic was 
in full readiness even before the threats. The military 
commanders, who take these new threats very seriously, are 
inclined to believe that "all this serves to pressure the 
Serbian side before the pending talks in Geneva." 
  However, if the threats of the trigger-happy Western war 
planners were to be fulfilled, resulting in a military action, 
it would be dangerous for the entire region. The military of the 
republic of Srpska, who are known to have a mass of antiaircraft 
artillery weapons and night-capable missile systems, believe 
that nobody needs this kind of adventure. 
  The first thing the soldiers of the republic of Srpska like 
to display are the most modern antiaircraft "Bofors"-type guns 
made in Sweden. They have laser sights which guarantee maximal 
precision in hitting aerial targets. They are also capable of 
high fire concentration, several thousand rounds per minute. 
Serbian fighters are also proud of their mass of portable 
shoulder-launched "Strela" [arrow]-type laser-equipped devices. 
"Strelas" are effective within a range of 3.5 kilometers against 
approaching or departing targets; they represent a particular 
threat to fighter-bombers because their range covers the 
altitude most suitable for fighter-bomber attacks on ground 
targets. 
  The "Kub" is a highly maneuverable missile system; it 
consists of three launchers on a single vehicle; it is designed 
for medium- and high-altitude targets. But the most powerful 
missile system is the stationary "Volhov"-type system. This 
system involves the most powerful missiles in the air-defense 
arsenal of the republic of Srpska military. The system has been 
modified to incorporate new guidance devices. These missiles are 
effective even at an altitude of 30 kilometers, and their speed 
matches that of the most modern NATO planes. 
  The terrain configuration is very advantageous for the 
Serbian air defense forces; it makes it very difficult for even 
the most modern electronic equipment to detect targets. Thus, 
our commanders feel that the probability of destruction is 
negligible. Their views are supported by data which show that 
such destruction of ground targets (as proposed by the Western 
war planners) is hard to achieve even in training exercises. The 
Gulf War experience also confirms this fact; there were only 17 
percent direct hits there. 
  Higher-ranking U.S. officers compare the possible military 
action against the Serbs in Bosnia to searching for a needle in 
a haystack. They have publicly expressed their skepticism about 
air strikes despite the variety of weapons possessed by NATO 
forces. Although they are aware that the Serbian military does 
not have fighter planes (interceptors), the high-ranking U.S. 
officers respect the air defense of the republic of Srpska's 
military, pointing out that the Serbs could easily conceal their 
heavy weapons in wooded mountainous areas and settlements. U.S. 
officers expressed the opinion that this would make pilots 
reluctant to attack.

Izetbegovic in Geneva by Mirko Munda; date not given: "Alija 
Izetbegovic and the 200,000 Soldiers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army Were Not There Then"] 
  [Text] Last week one more round of negotiations on 
the fate of Bosnia-Herzegovina ended in Switzerland. Once again 
the negotiators did not make any progress. President of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija Izetbegovic, when he gave 
our newspaper an interview, also told us in Geneva, after the 
very first day, on Tuesday evening, that he did not expect 
anything special. 
  [Munda] Peace is the first and most sacred principle. Is it 
possible to achieve it in Bosnia-Herzegovina? What are the basic 
conditions under which you would consent to it, Mr. President? 
  [Izetbegovic] Our principle is not peace, but rather a fair 
peace. After all these countless and unsuccessful negotiations, 
I am no longer convinced that it will be possible to achieve it 
at the negotiating table, at least not with the present balance 
of power and not with the people who are now sitting at the 
other side of the table, since they are the ones who launched 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We Muslims will probably have to prove for a while longer 
that they cannot conquer us. Only when they realize that will 
they be prepared to offer us a fair peace. 
  [Munda] And what should that offer include? 
  [Izetbegovic] The basic thing is preservation of the borders 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a 
state. In the kind of form that is being proposed by the 
emissaries of the European Union and the world organization, 
Owen and Stoltenberg, i.e., as a union of three republics, which 
of course is not even close to being a happy and good solution, 
it is possible and it would be possible to accept it. 
  In that case the Serbs and Croats would have to leave the 
areas that they have now occupied, and in which the Muslims were 
the majority population before the war. The Muslim republic 
would thus be a solid entity with access to the Sava in the 
north and to the sea in the south. In the east and west, it 
would be adjacent to the Drina River and the Una. That state 
would be able to live and function. 
<H5>  Saving What Can Still Be Saved </H5>
  [Munda] Is that feasible? Are you still convinced that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina can remain a unified state within the borders 
that were recognized by the international community with the 
three peoples living together in it, or have you already 
reconciled yourself to the partition of your state? 
  [Izetbegovic] You obviously have doubts, as I sometimes do 
myself. I can turn your question around, however. Is there any 
other way? For the time being we do not see one. Can we drive 
Mladic's army out of Bosnia-Herzegovina? According to our 
estimates there are about 100,000 people in it, and they still 
have 700-800 tanks and 2,000 cannons. During the war to date we 
have already destroyed 300-400 of their tanks, and also some of 
their personnel, but above all it is important that we have 
crushed their morale. The morale of Mladic's soldiers is very 
low, and technical superiority is all that their side still has. 
The relationship between our army and theirs is an inverse one: 
our people are highly motivated, their morale is high and is 
still growing stronger, but they are too poorly armed. On the 
other side, there are well-armed people with very low morale, 
behind whom crimes of the worst sort stretch like a shadow. 
  [Munda] After all the crimes and inconceivable horrors, is 
coexistence even still possible? 
  [Izetbegovic] When we talked about this, the following idea 
arose: by partitioning the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina into 
three republics, we would at least prevent the advance of the 
occupying army, which is also spreading classic fascism, 
actually a mixture of the worst in both fascism and Bolshevism. 
And we are firmly convinced--and it is also confirmed by 
history--that neither fascism nor Bolshevism can last forever, 
and that they cannot survive either in peace or in war. Fascism 
was defeated in war and in peace in Spain, and Bolshevism 
collapsed on its own. One thus just has to have enough time and 
patience and wait for them to end. 
  Let me be completely clear. We are convinced that neither 
the 
fascism on the Serbian side nor on the other one--I am thinking 
of Boban's Croatian parastate in Bosnia-Herzegovina--can 
survive. Our strategic concept is therefore to save what it is 
possible to save in Bosnia-Herzegovina, to establish a 
democratic system, to rebuild "our" part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and then, through the reputation of our political model, to 
defeat the fascism of the left and the right. Of course, the 
decisive factor in this is time, which means 20 to 30 years. 
  [Munda] Is it still possible to stop Karadzic, when he has 
already announced publicly the merger of Serbian Bosnia with 
Milosevic's Serbia? Boban is also obviously aiming at the same 
thing, the annexation of his Herceg-Bosna to the Croatian state. 
  [Izetbegovic] The international community would not accept 
anything like that. Milosevic will not become involved in 
anything like that without our consent. It is not possible to 
legalize that, just as it is not possible to enter something 
stolen in an enterprise's ledgers, if I can make what is perhaps 
not the best comparison. Karadzic consequently cannot break up 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and secede without our consent, because we 
are an internationally recognized state, and that recognition 
only guarantees certain rights which cannot be simply ignored. 
  [Munda] Are you also convinced that Serbian President 
Milosevic and Croatian President Tudjman already agreed on a 
partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina years ago, when you and Kiro 
Gligorov were still firmly advocating an asymmetric Yugoslavia, 
or Yugoslavia as a confederation? 
  [Izetbegovic] I was convinced of that since day one. Only 
blind people did not see what was already clear from day one. We 
opposed it as much as we could. Thus, for instance, we neither 
recognized that secret agreement or accepted it as a fact; we 
acted outwardly as if that plan did not exist, and we organized 
against it, because we of course knew about it. 
  A while ago Mr. Franjo Tudjman reminded me of 1939, when 
Bosnia was partitioned by the Serbs and Croats, and he asked me 
whether I was convinced that something like that was no longer 
possible, saying "You know, it is a real danger." Although I am 
usually a tactician, that time I answered him undiplomatically: 
"You know, Alija Izetbegovic and the 200,000 soldiers of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina army were not around then." 
  [Munda] Then you statesmen also speak in that undiplomatic 
language.... 
  [Izetbegovic] I do have calm nerves, I know how to control 
myself and be a tactician, but during that conversation Franjo 
Tudjman reminded me of something that always upsets and affects 
me. He should not have brought up certain historical disgraces, 
the fragmentation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, when Cvetkovic and 
Macek agreed that they would divide up Bosnia according to the 
majority principle: wherever there are more Serbs should belong 
to Serbia, and wherever there are more Croats should belong to 
Croatia. When one of them asked what would happen where the 
Muslims were in the majority, the other one answered, "We will 
act as if there are no Muslims." 
<H5>  The HVO Conducted the Most Brutal Ethnic Cleansing </H5>
  [Munda] What is actually happening in central Bosnia? Are 
the 
intensified battles in that section perhaps the result of an 
assessment that the Croats are militarily more vulnerable than 
the Serbs? Are you attacking there, or defending yourselves? 
  [Izetbegovic] Don't forget that every action by our army in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is legal, as long as it is in accordance with 
the laws and no crime is involved. That is all that it is not 
permitted in its own state. The Bosnia-Herzegovina army is 
acting there against the rebel HVO [Croatian Defense Council], 
which tried to establish a Croatian parastate. Furthermore, the 
broader public does not know that the HVO, where it had power 
and superiority, i.e., in central Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
conducted the most brutal ethnic cleansing. Thus, for instance, 
it "cleansed" Mostar, and it did the same thing in the 
traditional Muslim center Stolac and in central Bosnia. There 
are no more Muslims in Vitez, even though they were about 50 
percent of the population previously. They are also no longer in 
Busovaca. The HVO consequently not only acted legally, since it 
is a paramilitary force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also 
criminally. The Bosnia-Herzegovina army's actions there are 
legal and legitimate; our army cannot be a conquering one, but 
only a liberating one. 
  [Munda] Are you seriously disappointed in the world 
community, which seems to have completely turned its back on you 
and is indifferently watching the slaughter in your state? 
  [Izetbegovic] I think that all well-intentioned people in 
this world are disappointed or at least richer by an extremely 
bitter experience. Perhaps in the beginning we Muslims really 
were badly mistaken, since we were convinced that the world 
community would help us, especially since it kept adopting 
promising declarations and resolutions and constantly citing 
documents on human rights. One day we had to rid ourselves of 
these illusions, and we did. 
  Bosnia is a model example of what the international 
community 
seriously intends to do and of where it does not go beyond 
declarations. Bosnia is a sort of test, not only of good will 
but also of the world's seriousness and moral strength. Many of 
Europe's values lie under the rubble in Bosnia. What Europe 
represented for the world community has also been destroyed. 
  After all of these bitter experiences and disappointments, 
we 
can also wonder whether Europe really is what we thought it was, 
and as we imagined it--a symbol of progress, peacefulness, and 
human rights. Let me remind you that in this century alone this 
continent of ours has "given birth" to great evil twice: fascism 
and Bolshevism. Europe really is the French Revolution, it 
really is the declaration on human rights, but it is also Hitler 
and Stalin, with purges and concentration camps, gas chambers. 
Europe has borne within itself a great deal of evil, which we 
Europeans do not like to remember. 
  [Munda] Wouldn't another possible explanation be that you 
Bosnian Muslims are the victims because Europe supposedly did 
not want to have an Islamic state within its bosom? Furthermore, 
Islam, possibly because of Iran and Iraq, represents something 
negative in the eyes of the public.... 
  [Izetbegovic] I think that it primarily has to do with 
passivity and indecisiveness, since that is primary in human 
nature. For instance, if Milosevic invites Europe and all of the 
West not to do anything and to take care of their own economy 
and profit instead, and we cry out to them and ask them to send 
their people here to help us, if citizens of the West are dying 
here, of course they listen to Milosevic first and more. 
  If a Muslim republic would really be disruptive, one has to 
ask why the West was also indifferent when the Serbs destroyed 
Vukovar and fired on Dubrovnik. Believe me, Europe does not see 
Serbia as a bulwark against Islam, as one hears from that 
country. It is quite clear to the vast majority that it is a 
question of Serbia's policy of naked conquest, although I am not 
ruling out a completely different possibility, namely that a 
certain number of states are really secretly counting on 
something like what you hinted at in your question. 
  I can proudly tell you that my people behave in a much more 
European manner than some big Europeans. They have destroyed and 
are destroying our mosques, bridges, and libraries, but such 
buildings and institutions are sacred to us, and we would never 
touch them. 
<H3>  "The Weapons That Janez Jansa `Discovered' in Maribor Are 
Ours" </H3>
  [Munda] People who are not familiar with the background in 
which diplomacy usually operates are convinced that everyone has 
turned his back on you except for the Muslim countries. What 
about Slovenia? 
  [Izetbegovic] Slovenia is proof that it is not true. 
Slovenia 
is not big and it is also not a strong state, but from the very 
beginning it has given us political and moral support. 
Furthermore, it has received almost 70,000 of our people. The 
position of our refugees in Slovenia is considerably better than 
in Croatia. In our country we speak with great respect about 
Slovenia, which, even though it has just left Yugoslavia itself, 
has managed to help us. 
  [Munda] You are speaking very nicely and pleasantly about my 
young state. It seems that a shadow has just fallen between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia, however. What I have in mind is 
the scandal you know of at the Maribor airport, when 120 tons of 
what were obviously your weapons were discovered, and you also 
had to speak up in defense of one of your citizens, with the 
statement that from the beginning the suspect Hasan Cengic was 
an authorized representative of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Izetbegovic] Hasan Cengic was an employee of ours, an 
authorized representative of the Bosnia-Herzegovina government. 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was attacked, and we had to defend ourselves 
and arm ourselves. We could only obtain weapons from abroad. 
When Croatia closed the roads to us, we only had Slovenia left. 
The weapons that Janez Jansa "discovered" in Maribor are ours; 
we bought them in a certain other country and were bringing them 
to Bosnia through Slovenia. That is the truth, and nothing else. 
Hasan Cengic was not any sort of private arms dealer, but rather 
our representative for those affairs, not just in Slovenia but 
also in several countries. 
  [Munda] Why was it done so surreptitiously? 
  [Izetbegovic] Because an embargo was imposed on importing 
weapons into our country. It is paradoxical that the 
international community recognized the sovereign state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also recognized that we are a victim of 
aggression, but at the same time did not allow us and is not 
allowing us to be able to defend ourselves, even though we have 
a right to do so even under the Charter of the UN, of which we 
are a member. Every state has the right to defend itself in two 
ways, but we were not defended by other states, nor did we 
supposedly have the right to self-defense. 
  The fruit of that policy on the part of the international 
community is a devastated and to a considerable extent occupied 
country, and a refugee population, because at the beginning of 
the war we did not have weapons and we did not have anything to 
defend ourselves with. That is why we had to fend for ourselves 
and open up some other channels in spite of the embargo. Thank 
God, we succeeded, since otherwise we would have been literally 
trampled. 
  We saved and are still defending what is certainly not a 
large, but nevertheless significant part of our state's 
territory: the valleys of the Bosna and Neretva Rivers, along 
the Drina Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica, Krajina in the west, 
Sarajevo has already been defending itself for 20 months, and so 
on. That is all thanks to weapons brought from elsewhere, since 
one cannot defend oneself against tanks and artillery with bare 
hands. 
  [Munda] And how will you survive if Serbia and Croatia 
completely close you off? 
  [Izetbegovic] Our people have shown extraordinary vitality 
and the ability to defend themselves. For some time Serbia and 
Croatia will still surround us; they are surrounding us now and 
furthermore are still attacking. But we have survived, and we 
are still holding on. 
  [Munda] In the eyes of the public you are--forgive me if I 
am 
also a bit provocative--a sort of symbol of the defeated 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic seems to 
represent something new and uncompromising. 
  [Izetbegovic] I only know that Haris Silajdzic is younger 
and 
more handsome than I am. 
  [Munda] Sooner or later you will see peace. What is your 
view 
of the future and the rebuilding of Bosnia, Mr. President? 
  [Izetbegovic] Even if the Western countries have not helped 
us to defend ourselves, I am convinced that they will help us in 
rebuilding our country. Perhaps in that way they will somehow 
ease their consciences; and I am completely convinced that the 
Muslim countries will help us. A people that has been hardened 
in war, "purged," and has passed life's test, will quite 
certainly cope in peacetime. After these wartime experiences, I 
am not afraid of the future.

<F P=106> [Statement by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F>
Silajdzic at the extraordiary session of the Government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Sarajevo -- live] 
  [Text] I will now propose conclusions, taking into account 
the reports by the two ministers. I propose the following 
conclusion on the first item on the agenda: After the perfidious 
murder of the British citizen, a representative of the UNHCR [UN 
High Commission on Refugees], and the wounding of the two 
workers of this organization in Zenica on 27 January 1994, the 
Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina conveys 
expressions of its deepest condolences to the family of the 
murdered man, the Government of Great Britain, and the UNHCR. 
Condemning this terrorist act, the Government of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will do everything with a view to discovering 
and punishing the culprits of this horrific crime. This murder 
has taken place at the moment when we need humanitarian aid the 
most, but we are convinced that this act will not lead to the 
suspension of the delivery of humanitarian aid in central Bosnia 
and we think that it would be catastrophic if the innocent 
population paid the price for this terrorist act. 
  As for the second item on the agenda, the military 
intervention of the armed forces of the Republic of Croatia in 
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I propose the following 
conclusion: The Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
asserts, according to the reliable reports from the field, that 
an open military intervention was launched on the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by the armed forces of the Republic of 
Croatia. The Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
asks for an urgent session of the UN Security Concil and demands 
that the UN Security Council condemns this aggression and takes 
measures in conformity with Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and all 
relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General 
Assembly adopted so far. 
  These were the two conclusions on the two items of the 
agenda. Do we agree with these conclusions? [word indistinct] 
Thank you. The extraordinary session of the Government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has been concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Dr. Zlatko Binenfeld, reserve </F>
Croatian Army general and adviser to Croatian defense minister, 
by Mate Piskor; place and date not given: "Tuzla and Vitez Are 
Ecological Bombs"] 
  [Excerpts] Reporting from the fronts in Croatia and later 
also from those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croatian media on 
numerous occasions has alleged that the Serbian and the Muslim 
forces have been using chemical agents banned since 1925 by 
international convention. However, there has been very little 
credible evidence and this has been the reason why the Croatian 
Army so far has not openly reported it, stresses Professor Dr. 
Zlatko Binenfeld, reserve general of the Croatian Army and the 
defense minister's adviser for research and military-technical 
development. 
  [Piskor] General, your lecture on the application of 
chemical welfare in the clashes in the former Yugoslavia, which 
was given at Croatian Defense Ministry last week, has perplexed 
the public. Why did you present it to the public in such a 
shocking way and why only now? 
  [Binenfeld] You see, I am a scientist and I always insist 
that each claim must be supported by the appropriate evidence. 
There had been no material evidence for the use of chemical 
agents in Croatia even though there was much talk about it. We 
have the evidence now and we are presenting it to the public. 
This involves an Oganj rocket filled with the CS 
[chlorobenzamalonitride] chemical agent, which landed near 
Pokupski a year and a half ago and a hand grenade filled with 
the same chemical agent that was recently found near Zadar. 
<H5>  Shocking Information </H5>
  [Piskor] You have stated that the former Yugoslav National 
Army has approximately 100 metric tons of CS at its disposal. 
How great a danger does this represent? 
  [Binenfeld] Before I give a specific answer, I must explain 
something. I have been studying the problems of protection from 
chemical agents for 42 years. I have lectured at the Military 
Medical Academy and the Military Technical Faculty in Zagreb, I 
was an adviser to the former Yugoslav Government on the 
Disarmament Committee in Geneva, and a participant and lecturer 
at numerous international conventions on the use of and 
protection from chemical agents. Despite this, I did not know 
what the Yugoslav People's Army was manufacturing in Bijelo 
Polje near Mostar. I thought that that they were manufacturing 
quantities of chemical agents that were only sufficient for 
protection tests, but in fact they manufactured large 
quantities. General Tus, the commander of the air force of the 
former Yugoslav National Army in Mostar, was not informed 
either, and not even the omniscient CIA had any such notion. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Piskor] There is growing evidence that chemical agents are 
being used in the clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that the 
Muslim forces are using it increasingly often against the 
Croats. What is your view? 
  [Binenfeld] This whole business about the use of chemical 
agents in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I consider the use of chlorine 
to be a chemical agent, started long ago with Silajdzic's 
statement that, if given no other choice, they would use 
chlorine as a weapon. He threatened to poison all Europe with 
chlorine and similar nonsense. Had he used the chlorine in 
Tuzla he would have killed his own people first, because a 
chemical agent kills unselectively, and especially pays no 
attention to ethnicity. 
  But they really do have 500 tons of chlorine in Tuzla and 
now 
comes the most dangerous bit about it. They have threatened to 
use chlorine against the Serbs and the Serbs have accused them 
of actually doing so. However, this is not certain because UN 
experts have found smoke boxes and not bombs filled with 
chlorine. However, they have used chlorine against the Croats 
several times. 
  When we started to receive the initial reports about the use 
of chlorine-filled bombs in Vitez and Busovaca, for a long time 
we would not allow this to be revealed to the public until we 
held what we considered evidence. Evidence means the name of a 
hospital, a date, the name and surname of the patient, date of 
birth, symptoms, a medical examination, therapy, and the seal 
and signature of the physician in charge. Unfortunately, there 
is plenty of such evidence published. We have not received a 
denial of a single one either from the Muslims, whom we were 
accusing, or from the UN Protection Force. [passage omitted] 
  [Piskor] Grenades filled with chemical agents are being 
manufactured in Tuzla. However, is Tuzla dangerous just because 
of this? 
  [Binenfeld] Precisely. The Sodaso factory in Tuzla is a 
real ecological bomb. I studied the Sodaso factory in autumn 
1992. Bearing in mind that I obtained information about the 
exact quantities of chemicals that they possess from the factory 
itself, I informed all the important officials in the world 
about the danger. They have all acknowledged it but nobody has 
done a thing about it. I have informed the world that the 
approximately 60 tons of mercury in Tuzla presents a danger of 
contamination spreading via the Spreca River practically all the 
way to the Black Sea. The representative of Tuzla in Zagreb has 
openly threatened to do this. Bearing in mind that, apart from 
mercury, they have more than 150 tons of a chemical similar to 
the one in Bhopal, where a tenth of the quantity caused a huge 
ecological catastrophe and killed several thousands of people, 
it becomes clear why I have said that Sodaso is a real barrel of 
gunpowder. There is also a great quantity of hydrochloric acid 
and other acids. If an explosion occurred, lethal 
concentrations of acids would emerge. It is actually difficult 
to anticipate what would happen, how many people would perish, 
how many would be injured, and what the environment would be 
like afterward. It would be a catastrophe. I have proposed that 
these chemicals be transported somewhere safe, but, naturally, 
again without any success. [passage omitted]

  [Text] (STA) Sarajevo -- The Sarajevo daily OSLOBODJENJE 
reported yesterday [27 January] that 61 men of the Bosnian Army, 
including Ramiz Delalic-Celo, a former brigade commander, are 
charged with organizing an armed rebellion last July and 
October. The trial against the defendants will begin within a 
month in the military court in Sarajevo. Most of the accused 
soldiers, who belonged to the deactivated 9th and 10th Sarajevo 
brigades, have been detained; a detention order was issued for 
the remainder. 
  The soldiers are charged with an act of rebellion to return 
their former commanders, Musan Topalovic-Caco, a former 10th 
Mountain Brigade commander, and Ramiz Delalic-Celo, a former 9th 
Motorized Brigade commander, to their positions. Caco, Celo, and 
three other commanders used their units to blockade Sarajevo. 
They placed a cannon on the Bistrika mountaintop and aimed it at 
the 1st Corps building housing the security services and the 
city jail. According to the bill of indictment published by 
OSLOBODJENJE, the defendants are accused of planning an attack 
on the Bosnian Presidency Headquarters and several police 
stations in Sarajevo on 2 July and 2 October. 
  The rebellion was mercilessly suppressed during the night of 
26-27 October. Three police, six military police personnel, and 
eight civilians were killed in the operation against Celo and 
Caco. According to the Bosnian Government's statement, Caco was 
shot while trying to escape arrest.

  [Text] Trogir--It is very lively every 10 days at the 
Trogir [a town near Split] railroad station. The reason is that 
members of the King Tomislav 2d Trogir Company of the 114th 
Brigade of the Croatian Army are leaving for positions on the 
southern battlefield. 
  Thus, we photographed the members of the 2d Trogir Company 
while they waited for the bus before their departure. They will 
replace their friends and fellow fighters, also members of the 
Trogir Company.

  [Text] Zagreb -- Of the many Serbian priests who left their 
parishes following the aggression against Croatia, Jovan 
Pavlovic, Zagreb-Ljubljana metropolitan, returned to Zagreb on 
Thursday, becoming the first Serbian Orthodox priest to return 
to his diocese after a two-year absence. 
  Metropolitan Jovan was greeted by a large crowd of 
worshipers 
at the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord in the center 
of Zagreb. He returned for the feast of St. Sava, one of the 
major holidays of the Serbian Orthodox Church. 
  The return of the Zagreb-Ljubljana metropolitan to his 
residence in Zagreb after a two-year absence spent in Belgrade, 
combined with visits to Ljubljana, has a deep meaning for global 
Croatian-Serbian relations as well as for normalization of 
relations following the signing of the Geneva Declaration by 
Franjo Tudjman and Slobodan Milosevic. Metropolitan Jovan is a 
Croatian citizen. He has a Croatian identity card and passport 
that were recently given to him personally in Ljubljana by 
Dalimir Vidis, an official of the Croatian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, in the name of the Committee for Normalization of 
Croatian-Serbian Relations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Drazen Budisa, president of the Croatian </F>
Social Liberal Party, by Vlado Vurusic; place and date not 
given: "We Should Not Have Signed the Agreement With the 
Serbians Before Serbia Has Recognized Croatia!"] 
  [Text] [Vurusic] What is your comment on the Geneva 
agreement that establishes relations between Croatia and the FRY 
[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]? 
  [Budisa] From the comments of those who prepared the Geneva 
declaration it is obvious that much work had been done on the 
Croat-Serb agreement. We were not surprised by the agreement; 
it is a consequence of the continuity of Croatian policies 
toward Belgrade and Milosevic. We have always pointed out that 
Croatia must pull out of Milosevic's embrace because it brings 
us nothing good, while it is gradually getting Serbia out of 
international isolation. We believe that technical rather than 
political negotiations should be held with Serbia, until the 
time they recognize Croatia and Bosnia- Herzegovina within their 
integral borders. Until that happens, agreements such as the 
Geneva one will be harmful for Croatia, and beneficial for 
Milosevic's regime. The worst thing is that these agreements 
always come about when Milosevic's regime is under intensified 
international isolation. This agreement was reached at the 
moment of most serious talk about air strikes on Serb military 
targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There was even talk of more 
drastic sanctions. 
  [Vurusic] How would you account for President Tudjman's 
actions? 
  [Budisa] The question is if the Croatian president can still 
manage to pull out of the embrace he was caught in during the 
famous negotiations in Karadjordjevo. If Dr. Tudjman were to 
try to do so, who knows what would emerge concerning the talks 
he and Milosevic held before, especially concerning 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moreover, this agreement has been reached 
at a time the West is facing a redefinition of its positions 
concerning the events in the former Yugoslavia, which was 
prompted by the changes in Russia. I think that the new western 
plan for Bosnia, which even the French are inclined toward, will 
reduce the possibility of the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. I 
do not see what the new plan could contain apart from 
recognition of integral Bosnia-Herzegovina and giving up on 
ethnic states in Bosnia. Croatia must adjust to the concept 
supported by the international community, rather than stubbornly 
insisting on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina and finding 
common grounds with Milosevic. 
  [Vurusic] Do you think that Milosevic is in a way 
blackmailing Dr. Tudjman? 
  [Budisa] I do not know about that, but if we were to turn 
our back on Milosevic completely, the contents of all the former 
talks between Tudjman and Milosevic would probably be revealed. 
  [Vurusic] Radovan Karadzic has recently said that Serbia 
profits more from the agreement, while opening the Office in 
Serbia makes Croatia equal with the so-called Krajina and the 
Serb Republic. 
  [Budisa] Croatia's mistake is consenting to open the Office 
before the FRY has recognized us within our borders. When there 
is such an agreement, the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party] 
will do its best to mend and regulate the Croat-Serb relations. 
Until then, we believe that Serbia must be left under all the 
sanctions and have the status of aggressor. We in the HSLS do 
not want to give interviews even to the democratic -- 
provisionally described as independent -- Serb papers. 
  [Vurusic] The Geneva agreement will reflect on Croat-Muslim 
relations. 
  [Budisa] Although those involved deny it, the declaration 
certainly makes our relations with the Muslims difficult. If it 
were an agreement on recognition of the borders, there could be 
talk of a significant step toward the Serb recognition of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina within its borders, but since this has been 
avoided in the declaration, I am afraid this is another mistake 
Croatian diplomacy has made. 
  [Vurusic] What do you consider positive in the Geneva 
declaration? 
  [Budisa] Perhaps just this -- even the HSLS was attacked 
about the recent meeting of the Croatian and Serbian 
intellectuals in the Mimara [art gallery in Zagreb], although we 
had nothing to do with it. It is interesting to see the critics 
of the meeting silent now. The declaration could cause some 
sobering. It is evident that the agreement does not refer to 
the Security Council Resolution 871, but the UN Charter and the 
documents of the CSCE, the organization that the FRY is not a 
member of!? What does it mean for such country to sign such an 
agreement? 
  [Vurusic] It seems that the reactions of the West are mostly 
constrained, even negative. 
  [Budisa] The West, faced with the breakthrough of Greater 
Russian nationalism, which has become spokesman of the Russian 
parliament, and bearing in mind the danger of a new eastern 
block being founded on the nationalist-Orthodox basis, is in a 
position to support the principle on the borders being 
unchangeable more firmly than before. I think that the West is 
giving up on Bosnia- Herzegovina being a union of three states, 
and that Croatia must adjust to that and base its foreign policy 
on that principle. I think that the West has sobered after the 
changes in Russia, and that it realizes that the precedent of 
allowing the disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a 
recognized member of the international community, could bring 
about events of unprecedented scope in the countries of the 
former Soviet Union. 
  [Vurusic] Yesterday Croatia officially expressed the wish to 
be included in the Partnership for Peace, some kind of a 
antechamber to membership in NATO. 
  [Budisa] We welcome that intention. It has been done in a 
rather hesitant way, late, and probably due to the impression 
that, with the Croat-Serb agreement, we have gotten into the 
area of Russian politics. The fact that Churkin was preparing 
the Geneva agreement is no accident. With the application for 
the Partnership for Peace Croatia is expressing the wish to pull 
out of the Balkan embrace. President Tudjman himself realizes 
that he has gotten too deeply involved in the relations with the 
countries that separate us from the West. I think that this 
initiative is late. The HSLS proposed a long time ago, and 
included the proposal in the program, that Croatia apply for 
membership in NATO. 
  [Vurusic] Is there a possibility of Croatia becoming a 
subject of ridicule because of this agreement, as it has granted 
amnesty to its aggressor? 
  [Budisa] Indeed, it seems to me that Croatian politics is 
losing credibility, and that with such an agreement we are 
losing the reputation and national dignity, while in return we 
gain nothing. I would therefore agree with your statement. 
Croatian politics got entangled the moment it started making 
arrangements with the aggressor. Such moves truly insult the 
Croat national dignity and endanger the international 
community's main positive achievement -- the political and 
economic isolation of Serbia, which is now being questioned. 
Moreover, the Muslim doubts concerning the benevolence of this 
agreement are provoked. The former animosity between the Serbs 
and Croats has been brought to the boil, and now that it has 
fulfilled its purpose, by questioning the survival of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, this projected hatred should be brought down 
to a normal level. I am afraid of the agreement being presented 
as an act of the Croat-Serb solidarity in the face of the 
alleged danger of Islamic fundamentalism. I still believe that 
the Muslims are our allies -- not "natural" ones, but that they 
have become our allies through a combination of historical 
circumstances and the fact that Serbia is the aggressor -- both 
against Croatia and Bosnia. 
  [Vurusic] Why does Dr. Tudjman keep negotiating with 
Milosevic, despite the fact that Milosevic has several times 
proved that he does not abide by what he signs? 
  [Budisa] Because President Tudjman is captured by the 
concept of rearranging the former old Yugoslavia in completely 
different historical circumstances. He has pointed out several 
times that there is no solution to the Croat issue without an 
arrangement with Belgrade, and that our interest is the 
encompassing of the Croat ethnic territories. This is in itself 
neither correct nor wrong outside the historical context. Macek 
[Croatian signatory of the 1939 agreement founding the Bannat of 
Croatia] also acted upon these bases, and this is how he partly 
succeeded. However, in these historical circumstances of 
Yugoslavia disintegrating and parts of Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina being occupied this approach has lead to 
cooperation with the aggressor and the war with the Muslims. 
  [Vurusic] Do you think that Tudjman is trying to find his 
Dragisa Cvetkovic [prime minister of Yugoslavia, co-signatory of 
the 1939 agreement mentioned above] in Milosevic? 
  [Budisa] Today, unlike in 1939, there is no prince Pavle in 
Serbia. Why Dr. Tudjman persists in acting this way despite the 
fact that Milosevic has evidently cheated him several times is a 
question you will have to ask him. I no longer understand it. 
  [Vurusic] The key question raised by the Croat-Serb 
agreement is whether Milosevic has given up on the concept of 
Greater Serbia. 
  [Budisa] I am certain he has not. I think that the key to 
integrating our occupied areas is in the resolution of the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If Croatian politics were to 
concentrate on that as one of its main tasks, then there would 
be fewer negative consequences of this agreement, and in the 
future they would completely disappear. If the Croatian 
politics continues to aspire toward Herzeg-Bosna being annexed 
to Croatia, then the question arises how we will retrieve our 
occupied areas. There is constant talk that the two thirds of 
the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina who will be left outside the 
Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna will be equal in all respects. 
If this is really true, why should a separate republic be 
created for only one third of the Croats in Bosnia, when it is 
precisely the founding of such republic that questions the 
equality of the Croats who are left outside its borders in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Vurusic] What organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina do you 
propose? 
  [Budisa] The Croats, as the least populous in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, should have parity authority, while the territorial 
division should also be based on the observance of the ethnic 
principles, but not on creating separate states. Why would 
Bosnia- Herzegovina not be decentralized, divided into a certain 
number of counties? The advice of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
bishops and the messages from the Pope should be accepted. 
  [Vurusic] Western commentators mostly think that the Geneva 
agreement has definitely divided Bosnia. 
  [Budisa] Yes, many have interpreted it that way. However, 
since the West, under the pressure of the political changes in 
Russia, is changing its attitude on Bosnia, I am more optimistic 
about the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina than I was several 
months ago. The tragedy is that Tudjman does not see what is 
going on and that he is letting Milosevic have his way. Croatia 
is still not so badly off; it has the international credibility 
that is still incomparable with Milosevic's. Valentic's 
[Croatian prime minister] measures have yielded positive 
effects. Serbia has nothing to lose, and now it is dragging us 
into games in which we have a great deal to lose. 
  [Vurusic] The Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna and the Serb 
Republic have recently signed an agreement. In your opinion, 
does that make the situation in Bosnia easier or more difficult? 
  [Budisa] This is just one of the many papers. I think 
that Sarajevo has given up on the initial idea according to 
which the Serbs could separate from the Union of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina after two years. Bosnia-Herzegovina can be 
preserved if three of the four factors support it: the Muslims, 
the Croats, and the international community. I think that a 
great number of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina are in favor of 
preserving it, even those in Herzegovina. Croatia, on the other 
hand, is behaving as if the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina depends 
on Karadzic. 
  [Vurusic] There have been some significant personnel changes 
in Herceg-Bosna lately: after General Ante Roso, Vice Vukojevic 
also arrived in Herzegovina. What is your comment on that? 
  [Budisa] I see the arrival of Ante Roso differently from 
that of Vice Vukojevic. When he arrived in Herzeg-Bosna, Ante 
Roso was no longer a general of the Croatian Army, while Vice 
Vukojevic put on the uniform of the brigadier of the Croat 
Defense Council while still a Parliament representative and 
president of the Committee for Selection and Nomination. It 
seems as if some of our politicians are competing in who is 
going to make more political mistakes. 
  [Vurusic] Does the HSLS intend to start a discussion of the 
Geneva declaration in parliament? 
  [Budisa] We can not remain silent, though I do not know what 
will be on the agenda of the next parliament session. The HSLS 
can start many actions and initiatives, but there is less chance 
of the Croatian authorities changing some elements of its 
policies if it is suggested by the liberal party. We are forced 
to place our ideas through the members of the party in power who 
are close to us. On the other hand, the representatives of the 
Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] are, due to party 
discipline, often simply forced to vote against the HSLS 
proposals. 
  [Vurusic] Will you ask President Tudjman to make additional 
explanations, will you perhaps demand someone's resignation, 
since you have stated that the declaration was "an attack on the 
vital national interests and the national dignity"? 
  [Budisa] I am not sure we will not raise such questions, 
too. A strong reaction at the HDZ moves is demanded of us, but 
people forget the balance of power in parliament. We are aware 
of the fact that major political decisions and changes may 
result from the conflict within the HDZ, and not only from the 
Parliament discussion between the opposition and the party in 
power. 
  [Vurusic] Do you think that the Croats support the Geneva 
declaration? 
  [Budisa] I think that it is difficult to find a Croat who 
would privately support an agreement that offends our national 
dignity. The HSLS has not issued any slander against any 
people; there are no chauvinists and primitive people in the 
party, and we are not saying that there should be no 
negotiations with the Serbs and with Serbia, but the basis for 
that is well known -- the recognition of the borders and the 
reintegration of the occupied areas in the constitutional and 
legal system of Croatia. However, I am appalled at the HDZ 
masochism, at the consent to forget Vukovar, Petrinja, Okucani, 
Drnis, Baranja, all the destruction and all the atrocities done 
to us. I am afraid that we are slowly sliding into the position 
that was imposed on the Croats in the former Yugoslavia. I am 
afraid that the Croat national feeling will again be limited to 
what the Serbs mind about the manifestations of Croatianness. I 
am afraid that it will be our realist-politicians who will 
adjust to the Serb "oversensitivity" to Croatianness, that we 
will again have to be careful about not "offending" the Serbs 
with our Croatianness. After all they have done to us, from 
Vukovar to Dubrovnik, I am afraid that the present Croatian 
policies will lead to the situation in which we will no longer 
be allowed to talk about these crimes so that the Serbs do not 
get angry with us, or proclaim us nationalists. We can 
therefore again find ourselves in the position in which we will 
be as Croat as the Serbs will bear or allow. I am afraid that 
there will be some people in Croatia who will become accustomed 
to it, and who will adjust their speech and behavior to what I 
call national defeat. I fear that such people could again 
become representatives of professed Croat political interests, 
in the name of the so-called realist politics. I am prepared to 
go to Knin and make peace with the Serbs, but only after they 
recognize Croatia within its borders. What do Pejnovic's 
[deputy president of the Serb National Party] statements about 
the resolution of the Serb issue in Croatia depending on the 
observance of all the Serb options mean? Does that include the 
Chetnik ones? The Serb issue can not be resolved from the 
Ustasha positions, and Croatia must not respect the Chetnik 
positions. I hope that this is clear. We are not in such an 
unfavorable political and economic situation as Serbia and the 
so-called Krajina are. We should not be in a hurry and we 
should not have to curry favor with them. We have no reason to 
enter rash and insufficiently defined arrangements. 
  [Vurusic] What is the HSLS comment on the continuation of 
the conflict within the HDZ, from the Second HDZ Congress until 
the present, which culminated in the open argument between 
Manolic [president of the Chamber of Counties] and Susak 
[defense minister], and the announcement of [parliament 
chairman] Stipe Mesic's resignation? 
  [Budisa] As a rule, we do not comment on what goes on in 
other parties. The HDZ has recently accused the opposition of 
destabilizing Croatia, and we are witnessing the opposing 
positions within the very top of the HDZ. Their internal 
polemics are more irreconcilable than those between the 
opposition and the authorities, which is truly destabilizing the 
Croatian state. At his recent meeting with heads of counties, 
President Tudjman appealed for a united stand on the Croatian 
state politics, and we in fact do not know what it is. The 
defense minister has completely different opinions and positions 
on many key state and national issues from those of the 
president of the Chamber of Counties and Representatives. I 
therefore must ask what the Croatian state politics is and what 
concept it is that we should all unite about. 
  [Vurusic] Lately there has been talk of factions within the 
HSLS, and even of your having submitted your resignation as 
party president. Is that correct? 
  [Budisa] I have not submitted my resignation. At the Lower 
Council session we discussed personnel issues, which involved 
many people from the party leadership. The opinion prevailed 
that the continuity of the party should be preserved in the 
personnel issues as well, which means that I will run for 
president of the party at the next HSLS congress. I do not know 
who my opposing candidates will be. For the time being, there 
are seven candidates for deputy party president. There will be 
many candidates for certain positions, but, unlike in the HDZ, 
it can not happen in the HSLS that I dispute and change anyone's 
candidacy at the congress. 
  [Vurusic] The popularity of your party is decreasing; there 
have been reproaches that you often did not react the way the 
strongest opposition party in Croatia should have done. 
  [Budisa] I am certain that the HSLS would currently win more 
votes than at the last elections. However, our popularity has 
dropped in relation to the period after the elections. 
According to the surveys published in the press, however, 
almost half of the people do not want to declare their opinion. 
You see, there is a fierce media campaign against us, mainly on 
Croatian Television, the theme of which is that if we attack the 
authorities, we also attack Croatia. 
  We are also fighting against the HDZ because we believe that 
we would conduct the Croatian politics and the Croatian state 
better, more efficiently, and more successfully than the HDZ. 
  [Vurusic] Will you demand early elections? 
  [Budisa] Not for the time being. Our insistence on 
elections would certainly postpone them.

Republic Army Military Police: "The Transformation of the Army 
of the Czech Republic--The Number of Colonels and Lieutenant 
Colonels at the Ministry of Defense and Within the General Staff 
Has Not Declined"] 
  [Text] If we ask ourselves the question as to whether 
the Army of the Czech Republic should be transformed into an 
army of a democratic state that is unequivocally guided by the 
doctrine of securing the defense of its own territory, there can 
be no response other than yes. But then it is necessary to ask 
ourselves a second question: Whether this is to be accomplished 
by a method that is deemed applied by the present Army Command? 
The answer is equally unequivocal, but obverse: no! There are 
far too many and obvious reasons which prevent the Army from 
being transformed by the existing method: It is impossible not 
to believe that this is occurring deliberately and without 
regard to the efforts of all those who have the requisite 
knowledge and, primarily, the moral credibility. 
<H5>  There Are Sufficient Examples </H5>
  We have enough examples of transformation in other 
posttotalitarian armies out of the past; we only lack the 
appetite for being guided by them. The example of the 
denazification of the Wehrmacht after 1945 is worthy of note, as 
is mainly the method by which the Americans and their Western 
allies implemented the "exchange" of the Army Command that had 
been discredited on a worldwide scale. They were faced by the 
same problems that confront us today: to let the "irreplaceable 
military specialists" continue in the service and maintain the 
combat capability of the new Bundeswehr, or to remove actual 
Nazis from the Army and weaken combat capability for a certain 
period of time? Thousands of court verdicts involving Nazis and 
the appointment of those who were not corrupted or those who 
were the least corrupted bore fruit not only within the new 
German society, but also in terms of the international 
community's view of the new Bundeswehr. Even the position taken 
by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany in 
combining the Bundeswehr with the Army of the former GDR is 
worth mentioning; it is best documented by the words uttered by 
our new chief of the General Staff, Major General Nekvasil: "Not 
a single one of my fellow students from the advanced military 
schools of the former USSR is serving in the Bundeswehr." That 
is the end of the quotation--all that remains is reality! 
<H5>  The Indispensable Specialist </H5>
  A second example that should prompt our protagonists with 
regard to solving the democratization of the Army of the Czech 
Republic is the isolation of Austria following the election of 
Kurt Waldheim as president. The connection with the 
transformation of the Army in this case appears to be abstract, 
but only until the moment that we recall our experience. Colonel 
Divis, the author of a book (published in 1988) that is a 
festive ode to the superiority of socialist military equipment 
over capitalist military equipment, was promoted to general rank 
(like many others) immediately after November 1989 and became 
the chief of the Directorate of Foreign Relations. Of course, he 
became indispensable, both for the supreme commander and the 
minister of defense, as well as for the newly appointed chief of 
the General Staff, Pezl, and lest we happen to be deprived of 
such a "specialist" by having him retire, he was appointed to 
head the CSFR delegation for disarmament at the Vienna CSCE. A 
noteworthy utilization of an "indispensable specialist." 
  I do not believe that the intelligence services of the NATO 
countries were so paralyzed by euphoria over the velvet 
revolution that they failed to note such facts. It is, perhaps, 
only refined diplomatic conduct that prevents the other side 
from telling us about these facts directly and with frankness. 
  To recall the fact that as soon as they found out in Great 
Britain that their intelligence and counterespionage services 
were infiltrated by agents of the KGB, they preferred to 
disestablish the entire intelligence service and to rebuild it 
from the ground up is, perhaps, necessary only for the lay 
public, because, in specialized circles, this is well known. 
Clearly, the architects of the new Army of the Czech Republic 
are not specialists. 
<H5>  General Vacek's Attestations </H5>
  The first postrevolutionary minister of defense, General 
Vacek, issued Order No. 11, calling for attestations and the 
method for carrying them out in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism: 
They were to be handled in such a manner as to preserve the Army 
Command and the General Staff to the maximum possible extent, 
even at the cost of the departure of approximately 10,000 young 
officers who were least impacted by communist ideology. The 
declaration of the then political exponents (and actually even 
of today's exponents) regarding the indispensability of 
"specialists" and the absolute ignoring of the experiences from 
other countries that were compelled to experience similar 
torment permitted no movement of any kind in terms of 
democratizing the Army. 
  This "comrade" minister did only that which he was permitted 
to do. After publication of his share in the responsibility for 
"Operation Zasah" and "Operation Vlna" in November 1989, he was 
very positively evaluated by the supreme commander of the 
Federal Army and was replaced by Mr. Dobrovsky. 
<H5>  Minister Dobrovsky </H5>
  The sole qualification for this office held by L. Dobrovsky 
was his dissident past, membership in the Civic Forum [OF] 
movement, and being acquainted with Messrs. Dienstbier and 
Havel. Of course, his activities as an intelligence officer in 
Moscow and many other aspects, publication of which would have 
been ill-advised, were not taken into account. That is why, in 
less time than is required to tell the difference between rank 
and function, the situation compelled him to proclaim: "I cannot 
visualize my work as minister of defense without these 
generals." He selected a colleague from the OF movement to head 
the General Staff who was, of course, also a former Communist. 
What else? Following such appointments to the highest Army 
offices, there can be no surprise over the fact that the present 
chairman of the Defense Security Committee in parliament stated 
that rehabilitated Communists are not a whole lot different from 
the "normalizers." This is an interesting view provided that the 
chairman did something more than making only a populist 
statement. Not surprisingly, this will not tend to advance the 
transformation. 
  Without exaggeration, the period during which Mr. Dobrovsky 
was minister and Mr. Pezl was chief of the General Staff can be 
referred to as the latent period of the communist government by 
the generals and the highest-ranking officers at the Ministry of 
Defense and within the General Staff. This supremacy by the 
Communists can also be documented on the basis of the fact that 
since November 1989 not a single nonparty member has been 
promoted to the rank of general (always only a former 
Communist). However, the culmination of everything was the 
promotion list of new generals, signed by the prime minister and 
by the president of the Republic on 25 February 1993, clearly in 
celebration of the 45th anniversary of "victorious February." 
Compared with such an approach to Army questions, the 
"broiler-boiler" predecessors in the leadership of the state are 
only laughable. 
  This team remained in power in the Army until the elections 
in 1992, when Mr. Dobrovsky was replaced by Mr. Andrejcak, whose 
loyalty did not belong to the federal president, but to Mr. 
Meciar. 
<H5>  Minister Baudys </H5>
  The inaugural proclamation by Mr. Baudys was full of 
optimism 
indicating that a beginning from the ground up would actually be 
made within the Army. But it was only fiction! 
  The same colonels and generals who were in office during the 
single-party government period remained in all offices (all key 
offices!). This team worked out the plan for the transformation 
process and things within the Army continued to occur according 
to this plan. The singular exception confirming the rule is the 
fact that this process was participated in by a single graduate 
of a school other than the Soviet Military School, Lieutenant 
Colonel Luzny. 
  The generals who were appointed to their jobs as cadre 
reserves of the CPCZ [Communist Party of Czechoslovakia], as 
graduates of Soviet advanced military schools, who gathered 
their military experiences during the period of duration of the 
Warsaw Pact, are clearly the right stuff for building a 
democratic army. How can they build a new army in which the 
officer corps is supposed to be made up of one-third officers 
and two-thirds noncommissioned officers, as is customary in the 
armies of other democratic nations and as was also customary in 
our country during the First Republic? They would have to 
eliminate themselves primarily! So many colonels and lieutenant 
colonels could perhaps only exist in a socialist-type army. That 
is why the order issued by Mr. Baudys regarding the latest 
efficiency evaluations lacks a solution to this problem, sounds 
like a splash in the water, and it is surprising that it does 
not even bother our parliamentary delegates. But our delegates, 
and not only those in the Defense Security Committee, have other 
problems, such as, for example, the problem involving Paragraph 
102. 
<H5>  The Erroneous Implementation of Transformation </H5>
  Thus far, the carrying out of the transformation is 
absolutely aberrant and it is impossible to ignore the fact that 
the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff have virtually 
retained the same number of officers they had prior to the 
downsizing of the Army. According to the notions of the 
minister, these numbers were to decline as a result of the 
efficiency ratings that have been ordered. This did not occur 
because the efficiency ratings were only copied from the 
attestations ordered by Comrade Vacek, both as to form and 
results. According to a statement made by Mr. Pospisil, deputy 
minister of defense, in the press, the percentage of officers 
found to be unsuitable from the standpoint of moral credibility 
is so conspicuously small that the impression gained by the 
public that it is once more being duped is obviously correct. 
Once again, no consideration was given to the fact that the 
former members of the VKR [Military Counterintelligence Service] 
were members of the Third Directorate of the Ministry of the 
Interior and that the legalization of their service status 
should be subject to the lustration law or that they would have 
to obtain exemptions--something that no minister has hitherto 
found the courage to do. The same holds true of the former 
political apparatus. The political commissars and other 
political protagonists of the former regime continue in service. 
<H5>  General Nekvasil </H5>
  I have clearly kept the most important of reasons why it is 
not possible for the Army to be transformed into a desirable 
form until the end. This is the appointment of Maj. Gen. 
Nekvasil to be the new chief of the General Staff. He is a 
graduate of two Soviet advanced military schools and anyone who 
knows under what conditions a "foreigner" could be accepted 
there will understand that these fears have realistic roots. The 
repercussions to his appointment, which have recently been 
published in the daily press by people who served as his 
subordinates, are also not reflective of the high position that 
he occupies. After all, this is the highest Army office! Based 
on several encounters that I have had with Maj. Gen. Nekvasil, 
both prior to and after his appointment, it is impossible to 
formulate an objective viewpoint, but I acquired the impression 
that the problem lies not in his person, but in those who 
proposed and approved his nomination. 
  These anachronisms are of such dimensions that the Army and, 
specifically, the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff, are 
unable to find a final solution to the problem of the Army 
lobby, using their own forces, without participation by 
parliament.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Subert, spokesman for the Czech Ministry of </F>
the Interior: "The Ensuing Twilight of Political Espionage"] 
  [Text] The former journalist Jan Subert, who is today 
the spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech 
Republic, is setting out to familiarize readers of CESKY DENIK 
with the recent past and the current status and direction of the 
Czech intelligence service. 
  The mission of the current intelligence service of the 
democratic state is to predict and mitigate the risks that 
threaten not only the democratic state, but all of human 
civilization. The greatest dangers include, for example, the 
expansion of technologies and components for the production of 
nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, international 
terrorism, illegal transfers of classical weapons to locations 
causing concern in the world, racism, chauvinism, as well as 
anti-Semitism. But it is necessary to stress that positive 
intelligence can function well and serve only as an integral 
part of a comprehensive information system. 
  Much like counterintelligence, the present-day Czech 
intelligence service--the Office for Foreign Contacts and 
Information--has been rebuilt from the ground up and is 
operating in accordance with totally new principles. After 
November 1989, we took absolute account of the fact that every 
secret service is a civilian barometer of the political regime 
of a given country. We were completely guided by the principle 
according to which a fundamental political change within a 
country must be followed by a fundamental change in its secret 
services. In other words, we did not embark on 
"democratization," but, as the only postcommunist country, we 
began building these services from the very beginning. Our 
approach is highly regarded today by all democratic Western 
services that accept us as equal partners as the only ones from 
the former Soviet bloc. 
  As far back as 1990, communist espionage officers who 
operated under diplomatic cover were withdrawn from all 
Czechoslovak embassies. The liquidation of their stations also 
resulted in disconnecting the entire agent net of the 
pre-November intelligence service operated by the Federal 
Ministry of the Interior, which employed around 300 agents and 
confidential sources from among the ranks of foreign nationals 
during the period of 1970-89. The likelihood that these people 
continue to work against our Republic and against other 
democratic states is virtually nonexistent. Intelligence 
services with hostile aims must expect that the disconnected 
agent net is not only known to our intelligence service today. 
  The Office for Foreign Contacts and Information even settled 
with the so-called illegals who were operating abroad without 
diplomatic cover. All of them--their numbers did not exceed 
40--were exclusively Czechoslovak citizens who, as officers in 
the communist intelligence service, had undergone long-term 
training. They arrived at their destinations, where they lived 
as foreign nationals, equipped with false documents, generally 
via a third country from which they emigrated to the target 
country after several years of living in the third country. They 
were to be activated only in times of international crisis or in 
the event of war. All of the illegals were invited to return by 
the Office for Foreign Contacts and Information: Many heeded the 
call and with respect to those who remained in place our side 
undertook steps to limit their activities against our Republic 
and against the other democratic nations. 
  The structure and activities of the Office for Foreign 
Contacts and Information are based on a completely new 
philosophy of positive intelligence that is based on the demise 
of communism and, thus, on the demise of a bipolar world. The 
harsh and merciless war between the democratic and totalitarian 
secret services has come to an end and the bitter opponents of 
40 years are faced with the possibility of partnership 
relationships and collaboration. The twilight of political 
espionage is beginning; traditional forms of espionage are being 
reevaluated; the concept of an enemy is being replaced by the 
concept of danger and the "espionage" environment of agents, 
illegals, and active measures is being shifted to the area of 
anticivilization risks. In current intelligence work, more and 
more information is being acquired from overt areas. 
  But not even this development changes much about the fact 
that secret services continue to represent a sharp sword and 
that democratic states must hold them on a short rein by 
exercising strict control over them. Nevertheless, the current 
political climate has already given rise to the process for 
their dedemonization and transparency. The public has the right 
to know what the secret services in democratic countries are for 
and why they exist. They are here to protect national interests, 
to protect freedom and democracy, and, as a result, also to 
protect every one of us against violence, crime, and a lack of 
freedom.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article including interview with Andras Toth, </F>
spokesman of the Hungarian Socialist Party; place and date not 
given: "They Are Counting on the Activists--MSZP Tickets of 
Support"] 
  [Text] Not long ago the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP] issued 25 million forints' worth of so-called tickets of 
support, and it wants to use the sum that came in from this 
source for its campaign goals. Who buys these tickets of 
support? We asked spokesman Andras Toth. 
  [Toth] The idea comes from the British Labor Party, and 
there 
are decades of tradition behind it here. We "sell" these tickets 
of support in our citizens' forums and in our local 
organizations. So far, the typical supporter is a party member 
or sympathizer with a small income, often a retired person, who 
gives us one or two hundred forints. A few have given us 50,000 
forints and their names will be made public, in keeping with the 
party law, in our end-of-the-year accounting. 
  [MN] How large is the sum that has been received so far? 
  [Toth] About 1.2 million forints in Budapest. We think that 
the MSZP will be able to collect a good part of 25 million 
forints. The first nationwide reckoning is expected in March. 
Incidentally, one-half of the received sum is earmarked for our 
local organizations, and one-half for our central budget. 
  [MN] How much money are the socialists using for the 
campaign? So far Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] is the 
only party that has announced that its national committee has 
approved 18 million forints for the campaign. 
  [Toth] I cannot give an unequivocal answer to this, but this 
much is certain, that we will not spend more than the above 
amount either, and financial factors will not dominate our 
campaign. 
  [MN] Do you mean that since it is well-organized, the party 
will substitute the communal work of its activists for money? 
  [Toth] Yes, because after all the middle-class type of party 
is, by virtue of the way it is structured, geared to elections, 
while the social democratic, left-wing type of party, which the 
MSZP is, functions continuously and so has at its disposal a 
significant activist network. In the course of the campaign we 
will emphasize low-level work, and it is certain that our 
members and sympathizers will be happy to take our flyers to 
people's houses so that we will not have to use the services of 
the post office. 
  The socialists presented their education program in their 
Thursday media club. [MSZP] vice president Gyorgy Janosi 
stressed that it is one of the most important goals of the party 
to modify, even if only in the long term, the inequality of 
opportunity that is presently noticeable. To achieve this, it is 
necessary to have a flexible, penetrable educational system as 
well as autonomous schools. In its program the MSZP considers 
the so-called sector-neutral education financing system to be 
the good one, independently of who runs the school, since the 
sum used for this purpose is a right of the student by virtue of 
citizenship. The party considers it very important that the 
state ensure teachers' wages from the central budget, without 
burdening local governments.

toward the election of a successor to Geza Herczegh, who 
resigned from his position as constitutional justice when he 
became a member of the International Court in The Hague.

<F P=106> [Report by Panta Dzambazovski: "Have the Authorities Played </F>
Down the Problem?"] 
  [Text] Following the arrest of Mithat Emini, former 
secretary of the Party for Democratic Prosperity [PDP] and one 
of the party's founders and most influential figures, on charges 
of associating with the intent to pursue hostile activities 
against the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia, 
accused of being the supreme commander and ideologist of the 
Albanian paramilitary army in Macedonia, the whole affair on the 
creation of paramilitary formations discovered at the beginning 
of November is now being reassessed in terms of what was 
(official) cognition. A new analysis is under way. 
  The affair was discovered by the press and it was just two 
days later that the authorities -- the Interior Ministry and 
Interior Minister Ljubomir Frckovski -- issued public 
statements. They announced that on 5, 6, 7, and 8 November 
eight Macedonian citizens had been arrested and charged with 
criminal activity. From the end of 1991 to the present they had 
created armed formations and arranged the purchase and illegal 
entry of arms, explosives, ammunition, and other military 
equipment in cooperation with institutions and services of 
foreign countries. 
<H5>  November's Dilemmas </H5>
  Minister Frckovski reported that the Interior Ministry's 
action was the result of a two-year operation following the 
independence of Macedonia. During this period some smaller and 
some larger groups had been detected smuggling arms with the aim 
of overthrowing the constitutional order of Macedonia. In the 
end, eight people were arrested, while three foreign nationals 
escaped. It had been planned to recruit 20,000 recruits. The 
arrested group did not have direct links with any of the 
political parties, and, according to information from the 
Interior Ministry, Frckovski said there were no grounds for 
linking the group with a political party. One of those 
arrested, Deputy Defense Minister Hisen Haskaj, "appeared to be 
a citizen having individual activities in this matter or with an 
activity in liaison with the arrested group." The minister 
stated that there was no evidence of involvement of any other 
person from government structures, thus denying reports about a 
direct link between the group and the PDP when asked about the 
involvement of the deputy health minister Imer Imeri. 
  Different interpretations of events began to circulate in 
public. The VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization- Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity] 
said it was not merely an ordinary case of arms smuggling, 
emphasizing that the paramilitary formation was under the direct 
leadership of the PDP, and was controlled and headed by the 
Albanian Government and its Defense Ministry. The other 
opposition parties reacted by saying that "a part of the 
coalition is working against the state"; asking for the 
"dissolution of the coalition"; arguing that the "national key 
resulted in unskilled professionals"; and calling the whole 
affair a "fiasco of the authorities." They also called for the 
PDP and NDP [National Democratic Party] to be banned. The 
temperature in the public was rising, albanophobia was 
increasing. There were also some parties, however, that 
appealed to reason, saying that "not all the Albanians should be 
identified with the fascist nationalists and separatists" (the 
nonparliamentarian associated political parties). 
  The PDP, that is, its delegate group, as its coordinator 
Muhamed Halili stated, also looked at the situation from all 
possible angles. The PDP delegates did not dissociate 
themselves from the events, while the PDP center issued a 
statement only a few days later. The PDP recalled the period of 
the breaking-up of the Socialist Federated Republic of 
Yugoslavia, the beginning of the wars, and the departure of the 
Yugoslav National Army from Macedonia. "A vacuum was created in 
the maintenance of the security of the citizens...vigilantes 
appeared in inhabited areas, a model that became a thing of the 
past after the formation of the Macedonian Army." The statement 
reiterated the pleas of the PDP (for the Republic of Macedonia) 
and revealed dissatisfaction with the fact that some of the 
arrested were not given a chance to defend themselves. In fact, 
the PDP did not react the way it was expected to. 
  Information obtained from "reliable sources" then began to 
appear in the media. Mithat Emini and PDP President Nevzat 
Halili were mentioned, the former as the commissioner of the 
political organization of the All-Albanian Army Headquarters, 
the latter as the one who approved the letters and documents 
that fled to Albania. It was claimed that the whole undertaking 
had logistical support from the top of the Albanian state -- 
President Sali Berisha, Prime Minister Alexander Meksi, and 
Defense Minister Safet Zhulali. Bekir Zuta, then vice chairman 
of the Macedonian Government, was mentioned as one of the 
fundamental strategists of the paramilitary army. Many details 
of the activities undertaken by the top figures of the 
paramilitary army appeared. 
<H5>  Serious Accusations </H5>
  When Mithat Emini was arrested a week ago, when a couple of 
days later a ten-person group was charged, the leading figure in 
which was Emini, as "supreme commander," and when the text of 
the indictment was "revealed" and published in the press, things 
became clearer. However, this also called for a different 
assessment from the one that was made three months ago. 
  Emini resigned from his position as party secretary three 
weeks before the affair was discovered "for health reasons." He 
gave no other explanation. What he left behind were statements 
on peace and coexistence; he was publicly opposed to arming and 
was an advocate for solving all problems and issues through 
dialogue. He was considered a moderate and wise politician. 
His party colleagues were of the same opinion, as were other 
government authorities and foreign politicians, because he was 
the key figure in government discussions with the mediation of 
the international community. Can we associate his resignation 
with the Interior Ministry action? 
  The fact that Emini was invited for a discussion by the 
investigating judge and was then imprisoned raises the question 
about the relationship between the Interior Ministry and the 
District Court, because members of the Interior Ministry were 
not involved in the arrest of the first defendant. Some sources 
even tried to associate the resignation of the deputy secretary 
of the Interior Ministry Pavle Trajanov with the Emini case. 
  Nevertheless, one of the defense lawyers believes that the 
authorities were very prudent in carrying out their 
investigation, trying to avoid any political pressures and 
heating of the atmosphere among the Albanians, and postponing 
Emini's arrest until the last minute. 
  The indictment raises serious charges against the defendant. 
The text says there was a hostile association known as 
"Headquarters for National Defense," designated to be the 
commanding body. With the support and initiatives of the first 
defendant, Mithat Emini, and on his orders, action was taken to 
obtain technical equipment, computers were provided, and a 
computer center was established where plans were prepared for 
the personnel and recruitment of, as was mentioned, a 
paramilitary force consisting of 20,000 recruits. Plans for the 
formation of battalions and detachments were prepared (three 
battalions for Skopje, Kumanovo, Tetovo, and Gostivar 
respectively, and one for Debar and Struga). Funds were 
provided for the purchase of automatic rifles, and they had 
bought 200 rifles from Albania. The documents of the 
paramilitary army regarded the Macedonian Army and the 
Macedonian Interior Ministry as enemies, and also the "orthodox 
Slavs," and the intention was to solve the problem by force of 
arms. With the cooperation of the former deputy defense 
minister Hisen Haskaj a plan for the liquidation of the 14th 
infantry brigade and of other commands and units of the 
Macedonian Army was prepared. In the documents, there was also 
a formulation about national defense in the framework of 
territorial autonomy by the name of "Ilirida." 
  Ultimately we can question the way the political authorities 
acted, because it seems that, either because of the procedures 
of the investigation, or for the sake of maintaining peace, it 
did its best to play down the dimensions and nature of the 
activities undertaken by a group of Albanians, which included a 
number of prominent PDP members. The question related to the 
PDP is why it never broke the liaison with the case and why it 
did not dissociate itself from the paramilitary organization, in 
principle. Ultimately, as a participant in the government, the 
PDP must tidy up its ranks. What is often heard nowadays is 
definitely not true -- that none of the PDP members, or none of 
the Albanians, regard Macedonia as their own state, and that 
they all think of forming the so-called "Ilirida" and of joining 
Albania (so-called Greater Albania). 
  Therefore, there is yet another test for the state to pass, 
as well as its leadership, its authorities, and also the 
citizens of Macedonia themselves. And of course, the court must 
complete its work regardless of and without any political 
pressure. There is no doubt we must await its last word before 
we start making judgments and disqualifications. 
<H5>  [Box, p 4] </H5>
<H5>  Emini Does Not Confess </H5>
  Our editorial staff has obtained the text of the statement 
made by the first defendant Mithat Emini. It is taken from the 
indictment against Emini, and reads as follows: 
  "The defendant Mithat Emini did not confess the offences he 
was accused of by the investigating judge. He defended himself 
and justified his actions, placing them in the context of the 
period when the wars started on the territory of former 
Yugoslavia, when there was a threat to Macedonia's sovereignty, 
and therefore also to the Albanians living in Macedonia. His 
defense was based on the justification that whatever he had 
undertaken and done was done to prevent bloodshed and secure 
peaceful coexistence for all citizens in Macedonia. Defendant 
Mithat Emini denied all statements made by the defendants who 
mentioned him in their testimonies, and he did not accept the 
written documentation prepared regarding the event, because 
everything was done without his knowledge."

<F P=106> [Article by Mirka Velinovska: "Shadow Diplomacy: What Kind </F>
of Foreign Policy Would We Have if the Most Nationalistic Party 
Came to Power?"] 
  [Text] A day or so ago, listening to a Macedonian radio 
conversation with VMRO-DPMNE's [Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian 
National Unity] shadow foreign minister, it became somehow 
clearer to me what would have happened in Macedonia had that 
party, which calls itself the most nationalistic, won a complete 
victory in the last election. To be more precise, the extent to 
which the policy, which Vranislav Sinadinovski interpreted for 
us in an original manner, would have been carried out. And 
considering that the VMRO-DPMNE, or its shadow minister, in his 
media debut is already predicting a victory in the forthcoming 
election, I think that it is essential for us to analyze its 
positions and priorities with respect to the foreign policy that 
Macedonia will conduct if the most nationalistic and populist 
opposition wins. 
  First of all, Sinadinovski said that "his party is the only 
one that has a platform about the conduct of foreign policy," 
and he personally had offered to rent an auditorium to read his 
book, which was not written by chance. Of course, the gentleman 
continued, "the government did not want to make good use of that 
platform," nor, by analogy, of his book. And just what is it 
that should be "made good use of" if not what he intended to 
read, which appears to be the following: When it was ascertained 
(by the untried minister or the VMRO-DPMNE) that "the current 
foreign policy is not scientifically planned," mainly because of 
"the lack of preparations by the government to organize a 
hearing for a critical analysis of foreign policy," and it is 
still "pro-Yugoslav," "in fact, it is not pro-Yugoslav, but has 
long been its slave," and "Yugoslavia is, for practical 
purposes, dead, and there is no chance for its revival"; the 
shadow minister also promoted his scientifically based foreign 
policy, saying: "The VMRO-DPMNE has prescribed the pursuit of an 
independent foreign policy." Immediately after that came a 
public acknowledgment that he is a realist and pragmatist, and 
then he suggested that "Macedonia should make itself into a true 
friend of the only remaining world superpower and some European 
superpowers" (?!). Afterwards, in a scientifically based way, he 
said that, "the VMRO-DPMNE clearly and firmly strives for a 
reconciliation with neighboring countries," and, to avoid 
ambiguity, he criticized the current government for being 
"insufficiently active with respect to strengthening relation 
with Greece and Serbia," and indeed, the government does not 
make good use of the opportunities to provide good services to 
those who recognize us, such as, for example, Bulgaria. What [he 
refers to here] corresponds well to the affronted feelings on 
the part of official Bulgaria (implied at the Bulgarian minister 
of defense's appearance at the assembly of the European Union's 
military alliance, where he said that, "Macedonia conducts a 
policy that is not exactly well-disposed toward Bulgaria"), but 
it [his criticism] is not [in keeping] with our policy, which 
has been endorsed in the Assembly, of [keeping] all four 
neighbors at an equal distance, a policy that guarantees life 
for us. 
  The following is an analysis of the policy that a VMRO-DPMNE 
government would conduct with respect to international 
recognition and the definition of the status and the role of our 
country in the Balkans and in the world, beginning by 
establishing that "the government lied to the people when it 
said that Macedonia was a recognized state," when, in fact, he 
[probably President Gligorov], as a career diplomat, "knows that 
the establishment of relations at the level of consulates is not 
recognition," as was at first cited concerning the twelve 
European countries. Now, I am a little uncertain, perhaps 
because I am not privy to diplomatic secrets, but according to 
my own logic, that could also mean that Bulgaria and Russia did 
not recognize us because they have not opened any missions here 
as embassies, but that does not stop any criticism directed at 
the current government because it did not exploit possibilities 
to support itself more firmly through friendship with those 
countries in the representation of Macedonia's interests 
globally. In fact, the finding mentioned previously dovetails in 
no way with the preliminary disclosure by the same gentleman 
that: "Macedonia is recognized by many countries, and that fact 
should be exploited in the strengthening of the weak 
international position of our country." But my logic is 
obviously not scientifically based, and perhaps because of that, 
I did not succeed in understanding the following statement: 
namely, since it was already established that, "the government 
lied to the people about the external [situation]," what could 
be said about the domestic one? Sinadinovski reveals yet another 
ruse: "I beg you, to whom is the government lying when it says 
over and over again that Macedonia will get $230 million in 
financial aid?" Indeed, to whom is the government lying? Again, 
I think that it concerns the possible IMF credit, which is 
dependent upon Macedonia having its macroeconomic program for 
the coming year. The conditions in order for the money to be 
obtained are the introduction of certain laws for which the 
Assembly is responsible. And in the Assembly, the VMRO-DPMNE is 
also sitting, and God knows, independent, nationalist, and 
scientifically based. And Mr. Sinadinovski, as a man in the 
shadow [government], who says what he says in connection with 
that (he unveils the government's falsehood to the people), 
really should anticipate that that deceitfulness will be cruelly 
repudiated. Well, let it cost what it may, I mean "by the 
people, that is, the citizens who live in Macedonia," as defined 
by the new constitution according to Sinadinovski. 
  However, on that occasion, the minister in the corpulent 
opposition shadow [government] brought in his "scientifically 
based opinions" with which he and his party would solve the 
problems with the immediate neighborhood and would raise [the 
level] of goodneighborly relations as soon as it wins the 
election. At the same time, it is said that they would penetrate 
the Balkans, or since, as they put it, "Macedonia's place and 
status in the new European construction should be defined." I 
must admit that I concentrated a little more here to listen to 
the alternative recipe for success, when it appeared that: "The 
goodneighborly relations with Greece and the greater initiative 
of the future Macedonian foreign policy, for example, will be 
raised in a way in which there will be no discussions about the 
name, the flag, and so forth." As if neither he nor his party 
knew that the problem with Greece is precisely the current 
foreign and domestic policy of Macedonia, which considers 
everything, but does not accept changing. As to Greece, Mr. 
Sinadinovski is getting ready "to present Greece with the 
problem of the Macedonian minority which lives in Greece." Thus, 
a nice shortcut. The Greeks could hardly wait for us to turn to 
them, but everything was already decided, and Greece was almost 
ready to sit down with the Macedonians to talk about the 
Macedonian minority, when it does not admit that it has a 
minority, and still less does it recognize that there is a 
Republic of Macedonia on its northern border. 
  Actually, Sinadinovski, as a "real" politician, and above 
all, a "pragmatist," understood that the current Greek policy 
should be to respond by doing the same thing in Macedonia. What 
guarantee will lead to improving neighborly relations and to 
stabilizing the Balkans and exactly define the place of 
Macedonia in the future European structure? However, I live in 
hope that Mr. Sinadinovski will re-examine this theory, this 
time bearing in mind the fact that such a "scientifically based 
foreign policy" in the Greek, Serbian, and other Balkan cases, 
produces lethal results. Unless the world's information 
[sources] are lying .... 
  Finally, in the name of the shadow government, its minister 
for relations with foreign countries convinced us that Macedonia 
did not have to enter the United Nations under the conditions it 
did. To the question from the journalist -- "What would have 
happened to Macedonia if it had stayed outside the mainstream of 
the world organizations" -- came the following answer: "And what 
did it gain by entering?" Well, you see, if it is not clear to a 
potential minister even after several months what all Macedonia 
gained with its admission to the UN (it was entirely clear to 
Greece) and with a thesis that "Macedonia must act more 
aggressively in the world," then shouldn't I come to the 
conclusion that the motherland requires that the gentleman in 
question be in foreign policy and on the political scene in 
general? With one reservation: that perhaps the foreign policy 
of this party can be understood as a street event, a meeting, a 
flag, and a song, and in this case, the above-mentioned 
[position] would be entirely logical.

<F P=106> [Article by Matej More: "Stabilization Only As a Model"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Macedonia has started to carry out a 
stabilization program that has already begun to show initial 
results, although perhaps only temporary ones. 
  [Passage omitted] The social product (in material terms) 
declined in 1991 and 1992 by 11 and 15 percent, respectively. 
The recessionary trends also continued in 1993. After an almost 
16-percent decline in industrial production in 1992, during the 
first seven months of 1993 industrial production was 15.3 
percent lower than during the same period in 1992 (most heavily 
affected were the paper industry, with a 34 percent decline, the 
footwear and leather industries, with 35.2 percent, and 
metallurgy, with 24 percent). It is estimated that both the 
social product and industrial production fell another 15 percent 
in 1993. In 1992 the social product amounted to only $818 per 
capita, and last year it probably declined to $657. 
  Other economic areas are also falling behind. Agriculture 
has 
been seriously affected (also because of the drought); it is 
estimated that agricultural production was between 15 and 20 
percent lower than during the previous year. Construction (in 
terms of the number of hours worked) will reach a negative 
growth rate during the first seven months of 10 percent 
(compared to the same period the previous year), and in terms of 
value, during all of last year it was even 30 percent lower than 
one year earlier. Overnight stays in tourism grew somewhat, but 
only at the expense of domestic guests (28.1 percent), whereas 
the number of foreign overnight stays remained at the level of 
the previous year, which was already more or less at an 
extremely low level, since the war events in the former 
Yugoslavia had already almost completely cut Macedonia off from 
tourist foreign exchange income the year before. Investments in 
capital assets are also continuing to decline. In 1993 their 
share in the social product was 15 percent, whereas in 1990 it 
was still 17.7 percent. 
  Unemployment is at the extremely high level of 27.4 percent, 
and is still growing. More than 174,000 people are unemployed. 
It is interesting that in recent years this figure almost did 
not increase, in spite of large declines in production. Thus, in 
the middle of 1992 there were 172,000 people unemployed, and at 
the end of 1991, 166,900. In the first half of 1993 it grew by 
1.5 percent. This indicates high latent unemployment, and also 
the fact that people in Macedonia are trying in every possible 
way to prevent a growth of unemployment and the resulting social 
tension, even at the price of artificially maintaining 
employment. This, of course, will only be possible for a while 
longer. Sooner or later it will be necessary to restructure the 
economy and also start to solve the problems in the real 
economic sphere. Then we can expect a major growth in 
unemployment. 
  Just like the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], until 
recently Macedonia was also solving more and more of its 
problems by printing money. This, on top of the significantly 
reduced supply of the Macedonian market, and the significantly 
increased transportation costs (because of the above-mentioned 
transportation difficulties, etc.), was reflected last year in 
1,691 percent inflation. The year 1993 began with a rapid growth 
of prices (15.6 percent in January, as much as 32.5 percent in 
February, and 8.5 percent in March). Later Macedonia started to 
carry out a stabilization program that is already showing 
initial results (although perhaps only temporary ones). The 
National Bank is conducting a restrictive monetary policy; 
selective loans have been eliminated; in May there was a 
transition to a sliding exchange rate for the new Macedonian 
currency, the denar. Inflation fell to 3.4 percent in April, and 
in June there was even deflation (a 0.9 percent decline in 
retail prices). The renewed jumps in July and August (7.7 
percent and 9.5 percent), however, indicate that the 
stabilization was rather short-lived. In fact, the external 
shocks, along with the small size of the Macedonian economy and 
the high correlation between changes in the exchange rate and 
price growth, are rapidly stimulating a new inflationary spiral. 
This is particularly true since Macedonia has a large budget 
deficit (at the level of 6.5 percent of the social product in 
1992 and even 10 percent this year), which can be rapidly 
monetized, while there is a real danger of a new explosion of 
wages, which already thwarted the stabilization program once 
last year. 
  The situation in Macedonia, to be sure, is not as critical 
as 
in the FRY, but recently there has also been a severe decline in 
the standard of living here (real wages in 1991 fell by 13 
percent, and a year later by 33 percent). In spite of this, real 
average wages are still between 250 and 300 German marks. The 
situation, however, is also being alleviated by the very strong 
and rapidly developing gray economy, which according to some 
estimates is already reaching 25 percent of officially recorded 
production. 
  Macedonian finances are in a rather weak position. Most of 
the financial resources have been blocked at the National Bank 
of Yugoslavia in Belgrade. Foreign exchange reserves are 
approximately at the level of $130 million and are increasing 
negligibly (by $1 million a week). With its slow recognition on 
the international scene, the country has been virtually cut off 
from international loans and aid. It was only during last year, 
with loans from the Soros Foundation and the receipt of some 
foreign aid (Macedonia was granted aid in the amount of $120 
million by the United States and 30 million ECU by the EC as a 
sort of compensation for the damages it suffered as a result of 
the UN sanctions against Serbia) somewhat alleviated matters. 
This was also helped somewhat by mobilization of the foreign 
exchange funds received from the sale of socialized apartments. 
  On the other hand, it is estimated that the country has more 
than $1 billion in foreign debt (as of 30 June 1993 Macedonia 
owed $848 million for the principal and $349 million in 
interest). The lack of sources of foreign exchange has put 
Macedonia in a position in which it cannot meet its debt 
obligations. In addition to the unpaid $128 million from last 
year there is also another $165 million, which Macedonia will 
likewise not be able to service without additional foreign 
financial aid. 
  Macedonia has an already traditional foreign trade deficit, 
which was previously mostly covered by the Yugoslav federation. 
Ever since independence, foreign trade has been seriously 
affected. Of the countries on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia, trade is taking place more or less normally only 
with Slovenia, which is becoming an increasingly more important 
trading partner for the Macedonians. Croatia has introduced 
tariffs on imports of Macedonian goods; the FRY is under an 
embargo anyway. There are also difficulties, primarily in regard 
to transportation, in trade with the EC and East European 
countries. According to the Macedonian government's data, the 
trade deficit was otherwise significantly reduced in 1992 (to $7 
million from $225 million in 1991 and $418 million in 1990), and 
in 1993, after a surplus in the first quarter, the deficit is 
expected to rise again to the level of $80 million. Furthermore, 
there has also been an almost complete disappearance of foreign 
exchange earnings from tourism, which previously brought $50 
million a year; foreign exchange remittances from abroad are 
also down to a third of those before the collapse of Yugoslavia. 
  The government has already taken some steps toward 
strengthening market forces. Central subsidies have been 
reduced, the independence of management has been strengthened, 
likewise price controls have been mostly eliminated, and only a 
small number of basic food and energy products are still under 
state control. Recently a privatization law was also passed, 
which introduces somewhat different models of privatization from 
those we are familiar with from other East European countries 
and Slovenia, and for which Macedonia has received very positive 
evaluations by the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. Its basic goal is to lead to a change in the 
management of enterprises as soon as possible. Enterprises will 
be sold in terms of a majority share (51 percent). The aim of 
this is to find a new majority owner and manager immediately. 
Small investors will only be able to buy the remaining shares 
(49 percent), in smaller amounts. In contrast to other East 
European models and also the Slovene one, an enterprise, instead 
of having a multitude of dispersed owners, will already have a 
majority owner and manager at the very beginning. At the same 
time, this will also prevent someone with a smaller share (for 
example 10 percent) from acquiring the exclusive right to manage 
the enterprise. Privatization does not include distribution for 
free, and instead workers have the right to a 30 percent 
purchase at a discount of up to 70 percent. 
  The volume of Slovene-Macedonian trade has significantly 
declined from 1990 to the present. In 1990 Macedonia, although 
it was within Yugoslavia, was an extremely important trading 
partner for Croatia, the present FRY, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Calculated on the basis of the average exchange rate, Slovene 
exports to that country amounted to $586 million (on the basis 
of statistics from the SDK [Public Auditing Service], which 
monitored internal flows in Yugoslavia and are not completely 
comparable with the foreign trade statistics, so these figures 
should be taken with a grain of salt), which is more than we 
exported to Austria in 1992, and approximately at the level of 
exports to France. In 1990 and 1992 our sales to Macedonia 
declined abruptly, but still reached about $382 million in 1991 
and $133 million in 1992. It is interesting that trade with 
Macedonia increased substantially in 1993. While trade with 
other parts of the former Yugoslavia is still declining, the 
volume of trade with Macedonia in the first nine months of last 
year almost doubled in comparison with the same period in 1992. 
Macedonia has thus broken through to seventh place among 
Slovenia's most important trading partners. By September exports 
to Macedonia ($145 million) had already exceeded the total for 
1992, while during the same period in the previous year they 
only amounted to $77 million. We traditionally have a surplus in 
trade with Macedonia. In 1992 it was about $55 million, and last 
year it was already $77 million. 
  Several factors contributed to the extraordinary increase in 
trade. On one hand, it probably involves a gradual 
normalization, after the drastic decline during the crisis years 
of 1991 and 1992, to which the reestablished transportation 
routes like the ferry link between Koper and Durres (and further 
on to Skopje), but also the regular air link between Ljubljana 
and Skopje, also contributed in their own way. On the other 
hand, part of that trade probably also conceals some goods that 
after arriving in Macedonia seek a further path into Serbia, 
which is otherwise, in theory, isolated. 
  In terms of structure, most of our exports are 
pharmaceutical 
and cosmetic products, which last year represented a fifth of 
all Slovene exports, and exports of paper, textile, and wood 
products are also important. Significant items in imports are 
copper, electrical cables, textile products and clothing, and of 
course also Macedonian wine (this year import duties were 
eliminated) and fruits and vegetables, etc. Both economies are 
showing strong interest in increased cooperation. A large number 
of Slovene enterprises are present in the Macedonian market in 
the form of joint firms or representations (for example, 
Gorenje, Peko, Kompas, Planika, Stol Kamnik, Libela, and so 
forth). Among other things, the Macedonians are also interested 
in establishing a bank in Slovenia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Bronislaw Geremek, chairman of the </F>
Sejm Commission on Foreign Affairs, by Jaroslaw Gizinski and 
Maria Graczyk; place and date not given: "Raison d'etat"] 
  [Text] [WPROST] Has Poland again, as in the period between 
the world wars, found itself in the position of "heat from two 
directions?" [w dwa ognie, referring to a children's popular 
ball game]. 
  [Geremek] The geography has not changed--the Germans are 
still on one side, Russia is on the other. On the other hand, 
the geopolitical situation has changed considerably, and, 
regardless of the uneasiness that is the result of the 
developments of the past several months, one cannot forget the 
fact that Poland, for the first time, finds itself in a 
situation in which it does not have to fear outside aggression. 
  This does not mean, however, that one should underestimate 
the dangers that are manifesting themselves in the East. Anarchy 
in the post-Soviet expanses is a threatening phenomenon. Equally 
threatening is the appearance of tendencies that indicate the 
resurgence of an imperial domination by Russia. I do not think, 
however, that Poland will find itself in the position of being 
the solitary sacrifice. 
  [WPROST] In Bonn and Moscow, one hears talk lately of a 
so-called friendly axis between the two countries. A 
German-Russian accord over our heads, however, awakens certain 
uneasy historical associations. 
  [Geremek] When [Foreign] Minister Kozyrev spoke on the 
subject of the German-Russian axis, his German colleague 
Minister Kinkel made no protest. This in itself is reason enough 
to feel apprehension. Poland should watch these talks with care. 
I do not hide the fact that these talks awaken apprehension in 
me as well, but it is necessary to contrast them with other 
statements of German public opinion. Such careful observation 
allows one to assume that the policy of building Russian-German 
relationships over the heads of other partners will not find 
support in the German political structure. Such a temptation 
exists, however--we recognize it from history and we know what 
the results were. Therefore, the guiding principle of Polish 
foreign policy should be the perception of a threat, 
counteracting it and, at the same time, maintaining a feeling of 
realism in the evaluation of an actual threat. 
  [WPROST] In light of this, can we assure security for 
ourselves other than through seeking an alliance with NATO? 
  [Geremek] The fundamental orientation of Polish foreign 
policy is determined by Poland's ties to the West. One cannot 
imagine that an eventual conflict that would engulf a nation of 
40 million people in the center of Europe would be a regional 
conflict, capable of staying limited in scope. However, what is 
threatening is the fact that NATO has refused the acceptance of 
Poland. The West is repeating old mistakes and is giving in to 
political blackmail, in treating the problem of Russia as a 
priority problem to which everything else must be subordinated. 
  [WPROST] Shouldn't one also detect this problem in Polish 
foreign policy? In the opinion of Jerzy Giedroyc, "a threat on 
the part of Russia was belittled by the governments of the 
so-called Third Republic, which proved unable to formulate an 
eastern policy." 
  [Geremek] We achieved one basic thing in Poland's eastern 
policy: We freed ourselves from dependence on the Soviet Union, 
and we did not fall into dependency on Russia. I also view the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Poland as a success of our 
Eastern policy. On the other hand, there is no doubt that Poland 
needs to find a friendly partner in Russia, and not a foe. But 
this is dependent on the development of democracy in Russia. Our 
support of the development of democracy in Russia is in the 
interest of Polish raison d'etat. 
  [WPROST] Relationships with our other Eastern neighbors also 
leave much to be desired. 
  [Geremek] Unfortunately, we have been unable to establish an 
active policy of a Polish presence in the East. It is necessary, 
however, to take into consideration that this is also due to the 
economic situation. If Poland were now able to sell its exports 
on credit in Eastern markets, we would have no problem with 
attaining these markets. The lack of the necessary financial 
sources means that Polish activity in this arena is limited. 
Treaties alone will not solve this problem. 
  Poland should perform its role as a large state in this 
region of Europe, but it should not entertain a world-power 
fantasy. We must acquire political imagination, which we tend to 
lack from time to time. Poland is also active on behalf of the 
interests of the Visegrad Group, but successes here are less 
than we expected. 
  [WPROST] Perhaps such initiatives no longer fulfill the 
hopes 
associated with them? 
  [Geremek] I think that the Visegrad Group has a future. It 
is 
a reality inasmuch as a free-trade zone will emerge, in which 
all four countries are interested; there is also a mutual 
orientation to enter the European Union. I also place a lot of 
hope in Baltic cooperation; Poland should play a more active 
role in this arena than it has thus far. 
  [WPROST] In the meantime, however, we find ourselves in a 
situation that is hardly optimistic. In vain we knock on the 
West's door, while we have nothing to offer to the East. 
  [Geremek] I am categorically opposed to conclusions of 
hopelessness. I say this as a historian and not as a politician. 
It would be difficult to envision a political situation in which 
Poland's prospects would be better than they are at the present 
moment. There exists a real chance that Poland will enter into 
all of the agreements that integrate Europe, so that neither 
Germany nor Russia would be a threat to Poland. In glancing at 
the history of the last one thousand years, this is indeed an 
exceptional situation. 
  At the moment, I do not believe that Poland, in case of an 
outside threat, could be left alone to deal with it. An 
international arrangement already exists in which aggression 
against Poland would result in allies coming to our defense. 
  [WPROST] Similar confidences prevailed before the World War 
II.... 
  [Geremek] At that time we found ourselves between two powers 
and both attacked us. I think that now one of them is so sick 
that it is in no condition to attack anyone, and the other one 
is not interested in doing so. Even so, I recognize both 
threats--both German economic hegemony and Russian imperialist 
policy. 
  [WPROST] What will remain for us should decisions that are 
unfavorable to us be made at the January NATO summit in Brussels? 
  [Geremek] One should talk less about NATO and not attach 
such 
central importance to it. I am convinced that Poland will enter 
NATO, or NATO will cease to exist. It is only a matter of time. 
We should not only concentrate our attention on the problem of 
NATO, but also aim to create conditions of cooperation in the 
framework of Europe and concern ourselves with various security 
systems. 
  For the present, the only functioning security system on 
European terrain is NATO, and that is why we are interested in 
it. At any rate, the pact has to change its character; it must 
secure European stability. For the time being, it is not 
prepared to do so. Despite the wave of criticism aimed at 
Poland's foreign policy, Poland has never been so close to 
entering the alliance as it is now. The problem is not if Poland 
is to enter NATO, but when. 
  [WPROST] Isn't this conviction merely a manifestation of 
"wishful thinking?" 
  [Geremek] Attaining membership in NATO is not only a 
privilege but also carries with it the necessity of fulfilling 
certain conditions, such as, for example, the stabilization of 
democracy in the country, which broke away from communism in an 
unequivocal manner. A disordered country, without a program for 
systemic transformation, is a country that has no chance of 
entering NATO. Entry into NATO also means obligations, 
far-reaching economic and military obligations. Only after their 
fulfillment can we realistically think of participating in the 
pact. 
  Poles are unable to forget their past; every "whirlwind" 
that 
appears in the East or in the West provokes feelings of a lack 
of security. For that reason, membership in NATO has become so 
important for us. More and more politicians from various NATO 
countries are supporting us in this effort. 
  [WPROST] There are opinions in the West--not isolated 
opinions--that are apt to treat the left-wing electoral victory 
in Poland as a serious warning for NATO. 
  [Geremek] I hope that these fears are not justified, but it 
is difficult to say that there are not grounds for them. The 
question remains whether the result of the September 1993 Polish 
elections should be viewed as a sign that the former political 
forces have returned to power or as testimony to the fact that 
Poland is sufficiently democratic that the opposition forces can 
come to power by means of an election. I favor the optimistic 
version: Poland will not return to communism and will remain a 
democratic country. I understand, however, the fears of Western 
public opinion. 
  [WPROST] Many Polish politicians refrain from commenting on 
the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon." In your opinion, can this be seen 
as an indication of political wisdom or, rather, overconfidence? 
  [Geremek] I belong to that group of people that does not 
make 
light of Zhirinovskiy. I believe that those who reduce him to a 
mere element of political folklore, minimizing his significance, 
act foolishly. This is a phenomenon of great importance. After 
all, it is a problem not of the person but of policy. One can 
already see what kind of influence this policy exerts on the 
present political administration of Russia. We should show 
interest in this phenomenon, but we must not be guided by 
hysteria. 
  The opinions now emerging in the West that the major goal is 
order in Russia and not the processes of democratic 
transformation are becoming dangerous. Poland's voice may have a 
certain influence in the manner of thinking about Russia. To 
date, however, it is not heard loudly enough. 
  [WPROST] The Russian minister of foreign affairs recently 
claimed that Zhirinovskiy's election success reduces the chances 
of the Central European states entering NATO. 
  [Geremek] I think Minister Kozyrev is mistaken in his 
diagnosis. The election results in Russia rather increase the 
chances of Poland's getting into NATO. Let us not fool 
ourselves, however. What Poland will be in the future does not 
depend on the North Atlantic Pact. The situation in Europe and 
the world is preparing various surprises for us, and one should 
look after one's own army and military potential. There is an 
old saying that if one does not spend money on one's own army, 
one spends money on a foreign army stationed on one's own soil. 
The success of Polish foreign policy depends on the success of 
its economy as well as on the competent assurances of its 
military potential. 
  Poland was a leading country in the process of 
transformation 
and the elimination of communism. One cannot present a bill for 
this or expect gratitude. It is, however, a chance for Poland 
because Poland can play an active role in organizing the process 
of transformation in other countries. Visualizing different 
scenarios does not depend on how many tanks one has or on what 
kind of budget deficit one has. It depends on one's imagination. 
This can become the chance for Polish foreign policy.

<F P=106> [Article by (mt): "A Strong Economic Group: BPH, Elektrim, </F>
Exbud, Stalexport"] 
  [Text] Tens of trillions of zlotys of sales and 3 trillion 
zlotys [Z] worth of profits in 1993 constitute the best calling 
card and, at the same time, is a confirmation of the potential 
possibilities of the Polish Economic Consortium. 
  The Polish Economic Consortium, established by the Bank of 
Industry and Commerce S.A. [BPH], Elektrim, Exbud, and 
Stalexport, is the first such strong economic group in Poland. 
The Consortium's chartering document was signed by president 
Janusz Quandt for the BPH, while Elektrim was represented by 
president Andrzej Marian Skowronski, Exbud by president Witold 
Zaraska, and Stalexport by president Ryszard Harhala. 
  The main goal of this joint effort is a joint enterprise and 
the implementation of large economic plans of a material and 
capital nature, including, as was specifically noted in the 
signing of the charter, participation in the highway 
construction program. 
  With these plans and undertakings, the consortium wants to 
play an active role in the transformation and restructuring of 
the Polish economy, taking into consideration the needs of 
healthy market competition. 
  At the same time, the consortium intends to play a direct 
role in the process of privatizing the Polish economy by means 
of the purchase of state enterprises; it also intends to create 
new economic entities and to undertake proexport activities and 
developmental ventures. It will also be an active participant in 
the capital market, acting to secure and administer Polish and 
foreign capital. The consortium also intends to be involved in 
the restructuring and remodeling of Polish enterprises, 
including in management. 
  The task of the consortium is also the creation and 
management of economic entitities, the undertaking of investment 
activity--it is essential that this latter point include, above 
all, regions with high unemployment--and active entry into 
existing economic relationships. The consortium also intends to 
participate in the National Investment Funds--namely, in the 
program of mass privatization of state enterprises. 
  The Polish Economic Consortium is not a holding company but 
only an accord, which does not mean, however, that, in the 
future, a holding company including these four economic entities 
will not be created. The consortium counts on the realization of 
an investment by the State Treasury; it is precisely this 
expectation that accounts for mention of participation in the 
construction program of Polish highways. 
  The Bank of Commerce and Industry in Krakow, created in 1989 
as one of the commercial banks that emerged from the National 
Bank of Poland [NBP], is one of the largest banks in Poland. In 
terms of the value of its own capital, it ranks sixth among 
Polish banks. It has a wide range of services in national and 
foreign sales and is an active participant in both the money and 
capital markets. The BPH cooperates with more than 80 banks 
worldwide, including the World Bank, Credit Lyonnais, Deutsche 
Bank, Barclays Bank, and the American Express Bank: The BPH's 
guarantees are honored by foreign financial institutions. 
  Elektrim was privatized two years ago. In 1992 (1993's 
results are not yet balanced), sales increased more than 30 
percent, while net profit increased by over 170 percent (tax 
liabilities were over Z762 billion). These positive tendencies, 
in spite of the continuing recession and unfavorable business 
outlook, also appeared in 1993. Elektrim is a shareholder in 18 
companies in 11 countries. Exbud functions on the principles of, 
and in its organizational structure as, a holding company. It is 
made up of 29 companies in which Exbud holds the majority share, 
as well as five economic establishments and 11 foreign 
representations. In addition, Exbud has capital shares and also 
majority shares in 11 Polish and 10 foreign companies of a mixed 
nature. 
  Stalexport is not only a traditional exporter of steel and 
metal products but also, for some time now, an investment firm, 
specializing in the tourist nature. The company is developing 
dynamically.

<F P=106> [Article by Jana Dorotkova: "Power Supply Cut Threatens </F>
Slovak Firms"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Slovakia's many lumbering factories may 
be pushed to the brink of death by the state-owned electricity 
monopoly's decision to slash production 10 percent as of Dec. 1. 
  Slovensky energeticky podnik (SEP), citing many state 
enterprises' unhealthy dependence on free electricity, passed 
the cut on to the three regional distribution monopolies (one 
each in western, central and eastern Slovakia) who will now have 
to decide which insolvent factories to pull the plugs on. 
  "We have become the biggest and cheapest bank in the 
country," said SEP finance director Jaroslav Lehota. "Everybody 
owes us money." 
  SEP general manager Rudolf Kvetan said the move would not 
plunge Slovakia into a crisis. "It doesn't mean a complete 
blackout," he said, announcing the cuts in late November. "This 
is just a warning." 
  SEP made a similar warning in July, when exasperated 
directors complained of having their hands tied by the 
government in efforts to solve their nearly 3.5 billion Sk debt. 
"Our coffers are empty, and we have to take steps to break this 
vicious cycle," an SEP official said at the time. 
  Government representative Ivan Vlachovsky, who was 
commissioned to tackle the energy crisis, preached patience. 
  "For more than 40 years we were not encouraged to have 
independent economic thinking. Now solidarity and togetherness 
are required for us to navigate the Slovak economy into peaceful 
waters," Vlachovsky said in July. 
  So SEP and the three distributors let things go until 
November, when SEP's steam plants, which produce more than 30 
percent of the country's electricity, found themselves burning 
up their last coal reserves. Tired of waiting for cash, 
Ukrainian coal suppliers finally cut off SEP's deliveries, 
Lehota explained. 
  The Vojany power plant in eastern Slovakia has about 120,000 
tons of coal left. According to SEP spokesman Juraj Sidor, 
Vojany burns 5.5 tons a day. Vojany director Jan Kudlovsky said 
his reserves would last three more weeks. "The situation is not 
critical, but it is very serious," he said. 
  Of the three distributors, the most troubled is 
Stredoslovenske energetickezavody (SSE) in Zilina, central 
Slovakia. Communist planners stuffed this hilly region with arms 
factories and other heavy industry that has been hard pressed to 
survive the last four years of economic transformation, 
Prague-ordered weapons production cuts, and the world recession. 
Now, most of the factories lay in the polluted green valleys 
like dead ugly monsters, working at half or quarter capacity 
only because SSE has been in effect providing them with free 
energy. 
  The central Slovak distributor is owed 1.3 billion Sk, and 
SSE chief economist Michal Poloni says the most he can ever hope 
to see is about 500 million. SSE has already severed electricity 
flow to two small factories, and Poloni said 40 more could face 
a cutoff. "The bankruptcies will definitely start, and it's not 
going to take long. Finally things will start moving. Primary 
insolvencies will crop up," he said. 
  With unemployment raging at or above 20 percent in several 
central Slovak districts, a rash or bankruptcies would represent 
the last nail in the coffin for scores of battered factory 
towns. "It's awful, especially from a human point of view," 
Poloni said. "[The factory managers] [bracketed insert as 
published] inherited something from the past and now there's 
nothing they can do about it." 
  SEP and government officials prefer to view the cutback more 
as a disciplinary action against negligent companies, rather 
than the long-delayed kickoff of the painful bankruptcy process. 
  "We're counting on their conscience. They do have money," 
Lehota said, adding that companies had simply learned that 
unpaid electricity bills would go unpunished. Indeed, in the 
week after SSE's announcement, 300,000 Sk worth of old bills 
came pouring in. 
  Imrich Szitas, the Economics Ministry's director of 
industrial policy, laughed when asked about the plight of the 
debtors. "I get 28 phone calls a day! They think we can supply 
them forever, even if they don't pay if there is no pressure." 
  In what they described as an attempt to ward off a possible 
wave of bankruptcies, SEP and government officials agreed that 
instead of completely cutting off especially negligent 
factories, the distribution companies would provide them with 
the "technical minimum," defined as the least amount of 
electricity required to prevent the factory's equipment from 
breaking down (due to lack of use). The experience of operating 
a factory that cannot produce, officials hope, will scare the 
companies into action. 
  "We could start a chain of bankruptcies, but it wouldn't 
bring us the money back," SEP general manager Kvetan said. 
  Most officials, however, preferred to avoid the topic of 
bankruptcies. One SEP official, speaking under the condition of 
anonymity, explained, "I've got the strong impression that 
nobody wants to set off a chain of bankruptcies, they push it 
around like a hot potato. You know, politically something like 
that could have very unpleasant consequences," he said. 
  SEP's move was intended to a large extent to inject a dose 
of 
market reality into what has always been a state-run apparatus. 
Leftover Communist pricing practices, officials say, have 
saddled energy producers with a burden that has only gotten 
worse since the 1989 revolution. For example, large industrial 
producers pay about 1.2 Sk per kilowatt hour for their 
electricity. Smaller businesses, using costlier smaller wires, 
pay 2 Sk/kwh, but private households, with their even more 
expensive wires, pay just 0.83 Sk/kwh. 
  "Just like under socialism, industry pays for the individual 
consumer in order to give the impression that energy is cheap," 
Poloni said. 
  SEP officials contend that even with three hikes since 1989, 
prices are still ridiculous; they complain that two attempts to 
raise them earlier in the year were rebuffed by the government. 
"The whole rate system needs to be redone, it's unbelievable," 
Poloni said. 
  Undoubtedly change is in the air, and the government is 
getting involved. Finance Minister Julius Toth said Dec. 5 on 
television that price would probably have to go up some time in 
January. 
  Meanwhile SEP still awaits privatization. The Slovak 
government in June announced that the monopoly would be 
privatized no later than October, but then immediately kicked 
the project back down to the Economics Ministry, where it 
continues to languish. After reapproval, the project will have 
to go through the hands of the acting privatization minister, 
Premier Vladimir Meciar. 
  "The government gave the project back to make it better," 
Szitas said. "These are very important tasks. They have to be 
solved."

  [Text] Slovenia and the European Free Trade Association 
(EFTA) started negotiations in Geneva on a free trade agreement. 
"These may be preliminary talks, but they are quite important," 
said EFTA spokesman Jorg Renk. The two delegations began 
discussing a draft free trade agreement, prepared by EFTA 
experts. In its form and content, the draft is very similar to 
agreements between EFTA and other central European countries. 
The delegations also agreed that Slovenia should prepare a list 
of products on which import taxes will be gradually lowered by 
2001. Slovenia is to hold bilateral talks with EFTA member 
countries on agriculture. Vojka Ravbar, the state secretary at 
the Ministry of Economic Relations and Development, is heading 
the Slovene delegation in negotiations, while Joseph Mayer, 
deputy director general of the Austrian Ministry of Economic 
Affairs, is the head of the EFTA delegation. A new round of 
talks between Slovenia and EFTA is scheduled in the spring. 
However, no exact date was set, since simultaneous talks are 
also planned between Slovenia and the European Union. "We 
observe the principle of strictly parallel meetings with the 
EU," Renk said.

<F P=106> [Article by mu: "The President Does Not Sue Anybody"] </F>
  [Text] Ljubljana, 28 January -- Yesterday afternoon, 
Milan Kucan, president of Slovenia, was a guest for an hour on 
the live call-in show hosted by Glas Ljubljane Radio Chief 
Editor Ales Kardelj. Kucan talked with the editor and answered 
listeners' questions. 
  With regard to Mrs. Albright's invitation for Slovenia to 
join the Partnership for Peace program within the NATO 
framework, which was also the topic of yesterday's talks between 
President Kucan and U.S. Ambassador Wendt, Kucan emphasized that 
the NATO Council will make the final decision. It will not only 
debate the military aspect of the partnership but will also 
evaluate the openness of the Slovene economy and the human 
rights situation in our country. The president hopes that we 
will pass these "entrance" exams. He noted only one possible 
deterrent: We still do not have civilian control over the 
military sector. 
  With regard to Slovene relations with the Balkans, he thinks 
it is necessary for Slovenia to formulate a clear strategy 
towards this area now and not to wait until the end of the war 
when it would be ineffective. 
  Referring to the Geneva agreement between Milosevic and 
Tudjman, Kucan did not see any reason for optimism if this is 
only an agreement between two partners at the expense of the 
third one, that is, at the expense of Bosnia and the Muslims. 
  Referring to new party alliances in Slovenia, he said that 
it 
is a natural tendency for the parties to unite and form 
alliances. He expects a merger of the parties on the right and 
in the center of the political spectrum in the near future while 
nobody wants to be on the left yet. He is concerned by the 
trend to polarize the political arena, to divide the people 
between "ours" and "yours," "red" and "black." 
  Evaluating the effort to create an independent Slovene 
state, 
he said that, accordingto the European standards, we succeeded. 
However, now that we have to organize life in a state that is 
law-abiding and socially responsible, a will to define a common 
interest and common vision seems to be lacking. In his 
assessment, people in power are not sufficiently aware that, in 
the final analysis, all the government's decisions must serve 
the people. 
  Responding to the question as to whether he, as a president, 
is suing somebody at a time when this seems to be the "fashion," 
he stated that he is not suing anybody, although he would have 
reasons to seek moral satisfaction; however, he does not want to 
solve political disputes in court since the courts have a 
backlog already.

<F P=106> [Article by Radovan Pavic: "Muslims Will Bend to the Serbs </F>
and Join Yugoslavia"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] In the area of the former 
Yugoslavia, one of the strangest wars is being waged, in which 
almost anything is possible. Thus, a new alliance between the 
Muslims and Serbs is possible. It would be a logical alliance, 
because the Serbs and the Muslims are to a certain degree 
natural allies since they have both a mutual enemy (the Croats) 
and a mutual long-term interest, which is an outlet to the 
Croatian sea [as published]. [passage omitted] 
  This is why the pressure to obtain this outlet on the 
Croatian sea will become more pronounced and more intense. The 
sea has a mythical significance; it is an unavoidable element in 
the process of creating statehood. For the Serbs, it is indeed 
a century-old dream which today could possibly be achieved. In 
1878, when Serbia was recognized as an independent state, it was 
still very far from the sea--it was separated from it by 
Sandzak, Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija, Albania, and Macedonia 
(Turkey). The same year, Austria occupied Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and Serbia lost the possibility of resolving the issue of access 
to the sea through this "Serbian land." Thus, the moment of 
Serbia's greatest affirmation (creation of the state) was linked 
to its greatest frustration, which Serbia has carried as an 
undescribable burden until today. For the Muslims, too, the 
outlet to the sea means a final affirmation of their statehood, 
and they will not renounce this goal very easily. [passage 
omitted] The Muslim-Serb alliance will thus receive a special 
momentum when the republic of Srpska, with the Muslims' consent, 
leaves Bosnia-Herzegovina. Then the Muslim-Serb conflict and 
problem can be viewed as resolved, which means a new possibility 
for their alliance. [passage omitted] 
  This is why the Republic of Croatia and the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must, above all, be decisive in not 
surrendering the sovereignty of their coast and must be ready to 
defend this sovereignty even with military force. Likewise, in 
the political sense, the Croats must, during the negotiations, 
be on the offensive, i.e. they must request part of Sarajevo, 
because "they need it," and, of course, that part of Sarajevo in 
which there are no Croats at all, just as the others are 
demanding a part of the coast where there are no Muslims or 
Serbs. Does this sound strange? No, not at all--it only sounds 
logical and just.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Miomir V. Kalezic: "A Jewel Among Guns"] </F>
  [Text] For antiarmor combat at distances between 2,000 and 
3,000 meters, according to the price/efficiency criterion and 
from the standpoint of operational use (the variety of the 
ammunition kit, high rate of fire, and low flight time of the 
projectile), the advantage of artillery pieces over guided 
antitank missiles is obvious and manifold. In view of the fact 
that there is a need in our armed forces for technical 
modernization of antiarmor artillery, during the 1980's they 
began research and development in the Military Engineering 
Institute on a unified program whereby two activities were 
effectively accomplished: a 100-mm towed antiarmor gun was 
developed and given the name TOPAZ. This weapon was designed to 
incorporate the internal ballistic solution of the T-12 100-mm 
gun, with elements used from the carriage of the Yugoslav D30-J 
122-mm howitzer. A day-night system of fire control (SUV) was 
also developed for this gun; that system can also be used on the 
T-12 and MT-12 100-mm antiarmor guns. 
<H5>  On the Carriage of the D30-J Howitzer </H5>
  In the procedure that preceded selection of the conception 
for development of the new cannon, the parameters which from the 
standpoint of waging antiarmor combat decisively influenced the 
decision to use the carriage of the D30-J 122-mm howitzer were 
the following: 
  -- The D30-J howitzer has a three-leg carriage, which 
affords 
a circular horizontal field of operation. Even if the butt end 
of the barrel is over one of the legs of the carriage, firing is 
possible at elevations from -5 degrees to +18 degrees, which is 
quite acceptable for direct firing on armored targets. 
  -- The device to combat recoil on the D30-J howitzer has 
been 
installed above the barrel. This configuration helps to increase 
the stability of the gun during firing, which is an important 
advantage in antiarmor cannon from the standpoint of precision, 
the rate of fire, and firing conditions. 
  -- The mechanism for the traverse of the barrel on this gun 
is designed so that the barrel can be quickly and easily trained 
(by disconnecting one of the elements in the kinematic drive) 
and the sector of operation changed (with the strength of just 
one operator!). 
  -- In the traveling position, the two movable legs on the 
D30-J mount are folded back and fixed to the stationary leg of 
the carriage. The barrel (which has first rotated 180 degrees) 
is also fixed to the stationary leg, and the entire gun is towed 
by the towing eye, which is fixed to the muzzle brake. This 
unusual, but very worthwhile, design makes the gun short in the 
traveling position (the TOPAZ is two meters shorter in the 
traveling position than the T-12 gun). 
  -- The torsion-bar suspension system and 9.00x20 tires give 
the gun good cross-country ability on all types of roads and 
terrains and good maneuvering characteristics. 
  A barrel has been designed for the new TOPAZ gun which has 
the interior ballistics of the T-12 100-mm towed gun, and it can 
use the same ammunition, which is a particular advantage from 
the logistics standpoint. 
  The total weight of the TOPAZ 100-mm towed antiarmor gun so 
designed with the three-leg carriage is slightly greater than 
the weight of the D30-J 122-mm howitzer at 3,600 kg. The 
increased weight did not affect the towing characteristics and 
cross-country ability of the gun, but it did contribute to 
exceptional stability during firing under all conditions. 
Incorporation of a seat for the gunner on the gun's carriage has 
considerably improved the capability for sighting and tracking a 
moving target. 
<H5>  The New Fire Control System </H5>
  In view of the fact that incorporating a fire control system 
considerably reduces the system's reaction time and increases 
the likelihood of a kill and effectiveness of operation against 
armored targets, a fire control system was designed for the 
TOPAZ gun which has laser range-finding to the target and 
electronic (digital) determination of the target's angular 
velocity. The firing elements on this fire control system are 
determined by a ballistic microcomputer, and fed 
optoelectronically to the sighting device by the projection of a 
bright dot in the gunner's field of vision. Weather and 
ballistic figures for adjustment of the firing elements are fed 
in manually. This system affords action at night and under 
conditions of poor visibility. 
  The main components of the fire control system are the 
day-night sighting device with laser range-finding, the computer 
and electronic unit, sensors for the target's angular velocities 
in the traverse and elevation, batteries for power supply, and 
wiring. 
  In preparing for operation, the gunner activates the program 
for self-diagnosis and thus checks in advance that the fire 
control system is in proper working order. After rectification 
(bringing the axis of the optical sight and the axis of the 
barrel into the prescribed spatial position), figures are fed in 
manually on air and gunpowder temperature, air pressure, 
components of wind velocity (lengthwise and lateral), the change 
in muzzle velocity because of barrel wear, and the angle of lean 
of the axis of the cradle shoulder. 
  After the target has been spotted, the gunner trains the 
barrel onto the target with the levers of the mechanism for 
movement in the traverse and elevation. Data on the type of 
projectile chosen and the course of the target's movement are 
entered in the computer. Looking through the eyepiece, he brings 
the center of the engraved cross hairs onto the target point on 
the silhouette of the target and begins to track the target, at 
the same time activating the main program on the ballistic 
computer. During the tracking of the target, but after two to 
three seconds, reliable data are automatically obtained on its 
angular velocity. After that, the bright mark generated by the 
computer appears in the field of vision. It notifies the gunner 
to activate the laser to measure the range to the target. 
  On the basis of that data, the computer determines the 
firing 
elements and projects in the field of vision a bright dot 
shifted by the magnitude of the table angle for elevation and 
the lead angle in the horizontal plane (the bright dot remains 
in that position three to five seconds). Adjustment of the 
barrel brings the bright dot to coincide with the sighting point 
on the silhouette of the target, and then the projectile is 
launched. If a projectile is not launched in the envisaged time, 
the bright spot is extinguished and the target tracking cycle is 
repeated to determine new firing elements. 
<H5>  Significant Tactical Advantages </H5>
  The TOPAZ is a modern towed antiarmor artillery piece to 
fire 
on targets at an effective range up to 2,000 meters. It has high 
firepower, high precision, and a high rate of fire. The 
probability of hitting a moving target (at distances within the 
effective direct range) with the first round is higher than 70 
percent. Reaction time of the system at the battery level is 
less than 15 seconds! It uses destructive, hollow-charge, and 
hard-core shells. It has complete ballistic compatibility with 
the T-12 and MT-12 100-mm guns. 
  Thanks to the low height of the firing line and the tripod 
mount (which affords a circular traverse field of operation), 
the TOPAZ has significant tactical advantages in combat 
operations of antiarmor defense. The compact consideration in 
the traveling position and the minimum load on the towing 
vehicle provide the TOPAZ gun exceptional cross-country ability 
and mobility under all road and weather conditions. 
  The fire control system of the M91 is used on appropriate 
mounts on the TOPAZ 100-mm, the T-12, and the MT-12 guns. It is 
designed to determine and visualize the firing elements 
(traverse and elevation) in direct and indirect firing on moving 
and stationary targets. It is simple to operate, reliable, and 
effective. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and the speed of 
determining the firing elements (particularly for fast-moving 
targets), the accuracy in monitoring the firing elements 
adopted, and the exceptionally low total reaction time, the fire 
control system is a unique solution on a world scale and an 
important contribution to improving the firepower of antiarmor 
artillery. 
  With the new ammunition, that includes a subcaliber 
projectile, whose conception and design are up-to-date and whose 
penetrability is at the level of antiarmor projectiles of 
considerably greater caliber, the TOPAZ system will be a new pet 
and reliable weapon in the hands of our artillerymen.

<F P=106> [Article by S.V.: "A More Powerful Veteran"] </F>
  [Text] More T-55 tanks have been manufactured in Europe 
than any other medium armored fighting vehicle. Although 
manufactured at the technological level of the 1960's, it has 
been exported to several countries in the world. It is armed 
with a 100-mm cannon with a rifled bore, which is loaded 
manually, and then the PKT 7.62-mm (or SGM) coaxial machine gun 
and the DShKM 12.7-mm antiaircraft machine gun. 
  Numerous modifications and improvements have now been made 
in 
the T-55 tank in order to increase its rate of fire, armor 
protection, and mobility. More or less successful results have 
been achieved. 
  When production of control systems for the M-84 tanks was 
being prepared in our country, the same system was installed in 
T-55 tanks still in use in units of the VJ [Army of Yugoslavia]. 
That was the first refinement and improvement of the 
characteristics of this armored fighting vehicle. Following 
those first modifications, it turned out that its combat and 
technical characteristics could be considerably improved with 
minor profitable investments, that is, the effectiveness of its 
fire could be increased, armor protection could be raised to a 
higher level, and the work of the crew could be facilitated by 
installing special devices. That, of course, would also increase 
the likelihood of the personnel's survival and protection of 
assemblies under the most extreme conditions of use. 
  This tank's rate of fire was increased by installing two 
launch rails for Malyutka antiarmor guided missiles. As is 
well-known, they can hit enemy armored vehicles and fortified 
structures over a range from 500 meters to 3 km, which improves 
the T-55 tank's ability to wage antiarmor combat more 
effectively over greater distances. At the same time, the 
missile operator is protected from enemy fire. Two antiarmor 
missiles are mounted on each launch rail; they are guided from 
the control panel in the tank. The mechanism for elevation of 
the cannon's barrel is used to set the missile's basic slope at 
the time of launching. The operator guides the missile by 
looking through the tank's existing sights, in which the 
magnification factor is increased by additional optical 
equipment. In addition to the missiles on the launch rails, 
there are four more missiles on the tank's turret. 
  Modifications to the T-55 have also improved the 
characteristics of the ammunition, and installing 
heat-insulating pads on the external surfaces of the cannon's 
barrel have reduced more than 80 percent deformations occurring 
during action because of uneven cooling. This has increased the 
accuracy of the main armament--the cannon. 
  Because an entire family of hand-held antiarmor weapons for 
close combat has developed in recent years, including, for 
example, rocket launchers with shaped-charge warheads, it was 
reasonable to strengthen protection against these projectiles. 
At the same time, increasing the tank's overall armor protection 
would have been very expensive and impractical, and it would 
have considerably increased the tank's total weight and reduced 
its mobility. That is why a system for protection against the 
shaped charge similar to the design on the M-84 tank was 
installed on the tank. That is, screens to protect against 
shaped-charge warheads are used on this tank to protect the 
tank's flanks beneath the mounts of the boxes and fuel tanks, 
the critical line where the tank's armored floor plates join the 
sides, and also surfaces at the level where the tank's turret 
joins the armored hull. 
  Twelve launchers have also been installed on the front of 
the 
turret to eject smoke canisters in front of the tank at 
distances greater than 100 meters. The launch tubes, the firing 
panel, and other equipment were taken over from the M-84 tank. 
Thanks to use of smoke-canister launchers, the tank is 
camouflaged by a smoke screen on the forward side, which reduces 
the disadvantage of the smoke screen of the heat-smoke apparatus 
of the engine, which, depending on the wind direction, is mainly 
created behind or to the side of the tank, and provides it 
insufficient protection from the front. The smoke canisters are 
so designed that they can be activated electrically and by hand 
and thrown around the tank. 
  Aside from making it possible to eject smoke canisters, the 
launch tubes increase the turret's protection against the shaped 
charge. Actually, projectiles fired at the tank are activated 
when they strike those tubes before they hit the turret, which 
reduces their effect during action. 
  A plow has also been installed on the T-55 tank so that it 
can dig itself in; it is on the lower front slanted plate of the 
nose, making it possible for the tank to dig itself in in 15 to 
20 minutes depending on the soil type and category. It takes two 
to three minutes to convert the plow from working to traveling 
position or the other way around. 
  This modification has made the tank more independent in 
providing its own cover, and the plow serves as an armor plate 
affording additional armor protection to the front of the tank. 
  The improvement and modifications to T-55 tanks, although 
carried out under conditions of the embargo, have considerably 
improved essential tactical and technical characteristics of 
this medium tank, above all the rate of fire over longer range 
and protection against shaped charges. This has secured its 
survival on the battlefield and made it possible to respond 
decently to the enemy's tanks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Bozidar Djokic, commander of </F>
the Leskovac Corps, by R. Popovic; place and date not given: 
"The Mistakes Must Not Be Repeated"] 
  [Text] [Popovic] General, was the youngest corps in the 
Army of Yugoslavia [VJ], which you head, formed because of 
experience in the last war, and what do you think as a fighter 
and commanding officer about the applicability of that knowledge 
in the everyday life of members of our armed forces? 
  [Djokic] The experiences in the last war certainly should be 
appreciated; they can be used in training the men and the 
commands, which does not mean that there will be a considerable 
change in the general approach to training our armed forces. 
That conflict on the space of the former Yugoslavia still 
represents only one of the forms of military action typical of 
civil war in which the initiative of individuals, small groups, 
and units is prominent, which would not be the case should there 
be aggression from outside. The Army of Yugoslavia must be able 
to defend the country against an aggressor who is well-armed, 
trained, and several times stronger. I think that the 
experiences at the operational and strategic level are more 
important than the "tactical experiences" gained in the war in 
1991 and 1992; we learned through them that units at the front 
cannot be commanded from a great distance and directly from the 
Supreme Command. That is why at the beginning of the war, 
wherever possible, temporary structures were formed which we 
called operational groups. The commands of the operational 
groups were made up of men who did not know each other well 
enough, so that in the extreme case they were teams that had not 
practiced together and frequently their results in direction and 
command were poorer than results achieved by commands at the 
formation level. We can no longer allow ourselves to make such a 
mistake. 
  [Popovic] The formation of new units in the VJ is not the 
only innovation in the process of transformation which has 
spread through all the pores of military life. How do you look 
on that process? 
  [Djokic] The transformation has two basic spheres. First, 
the 
material sphere, which pertains above all to changes in 
organization and military structure taking place without major 
hindrances; they soon will be completed, successfully I hope. In 
the second sphere, the nonmaterial, political, and moral sphere, 
a transformation is also taking place and has already been given 
its framework, which is now clear to the immense majority of 
members of the Army of Yugoslavia. That part of the 
transformation requires changes in people's behavior, in the way 
they think, in the way they regard their obligations and tasks. 
That is the part that involves depoliticization of the armed 
forces and professionalization of its members. It is quite 
expensive and requires much more effort than transformation of 
organization and military structure. We have had very important 
results in this area, which shows that our people have already 
cast off the burden of earlier political commitments, along with 
many unnecessary tasks, so that now we can commit ourselves more 
successfully and resolutely to modernization of the armed forces 
and to professionalization, which should not be conceived as a 
completely new phenomenon. Even earlier, in the JNA [Yugoslav 
People's Army], we had active officers who were part of an army 
which was highly professional. Now, we are increasing the number 
of people who will defend the country professionally, including 
in our ranks soldiers under contract, who already make up a 
sizable portion of members of the Army of Yugoslavia. 
  [Popovic] Now that you are already talking about soldiers 
under contract, how really professional are they? 
  [Djokic] Certain time is needed for soldiers under contract 
to be turned into professionals, masters of the art of war. So 
far, we have not had the time to achieve that result through the 
process of training and screening of personnel. These are only 
the initial steps, which in military police units, the 
paratroopers, and other special-purpose units have already 
produced the first contours of our professional soldier. In 
other units, that process is going somewhat more slowly, and 
minor mistakes have also been made. For example, assigning 
soldiers under contract from border areas to border units 
carries a high risk that individuals will abuse their position 
and the duties they perform. The difficult conditions under 
which we are living now make such doubts increasingly realistic. 
In future, then, the number of soldiers under contract will be 
reduced to a reasonable number, and they will be replaced by 
soldiers serving their regular required military service, from 
whose ranks we will later recruit professional border guards. In 
any case, it should be said that most of the soldiers under 
contract have been performing their wartime duties very 
competently, and we can confidently say of them that they are 
real professionals. 
  [Popovic] You have mentioned the border, could you say 
something more about the situation at the moment on the border 
with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia? 
  [Djokic] For more than two years now, we have been securing 
the border with Macedonia under very difficult material 
conditions. Our border units are mainly housed in old and 
abandoned schools, by contrast with certain other services on 
the border, which have new buildings with steam heat and all 
other conditions for an extremely comfortable life and work. A 
large number of our border guards lived until recently in tents, 
and even now we are using them to store certain supplies and to 
perform some of our regular activities. This certainly makes it 
more difficult for us to secure the national border. Thanks to 
the exceptional efforts we made in the last three months, with 
support of authorities in the opstinas of Vranje and Bujanovac 
and even from the Health Ministry of the Republic of Serbia, we 
now have several abandoned outpatient clinics which were built 
in settlements near the border, which we are going to adapt and 
use as watchtowers. 
  For the moment, we have no very serious problems concerning 
border security. There are very few with bad intentions, but on 
the other hand there are many who are trying to cross the border 
to smuggle fuel. The numbers of those smugglers and the poorly 
marked or unmarked border resulted in the recent incident which 
the Macedonian news media exaggerated somewhat, although in the 
estimation of our border personnel their patrol did cross onto 
our territory, which is why it was stopped and taken to the 
watchtower, and from there, after a brief routine conversation, 
it was returned to their territory. 
  [Popovic] General, some of the units in your corps are being 
manned from the reserves. Can you say something about the 
response of military registrants to the call-up for exercises, 
and in that same context about the influence of party activities? 
  [Djokic] We have given very high marks to the mobilizations 
which we have carried out up to now as an indicator of the 
readiness of units to perform special-purpose missions. In 
recent months, it can be said without exaggeration that we have 
recorded a considerable growth in the responsibility of members 
of our war units and an increased reporting rate, which now 
ranges between 80 and 90 percent of military registrants called 
up. There has also been an increase in the response of recruits 
to do required military service, so that there is less and less 
need to replace peacetime personnel with military registrants, 
so that they are being called up less and less often and serving 
less time in wartime units. 
  As for party activity and the influence of parties or their 
attempt to have an adverse effect on the call-up of military 
registrants, I must say that there was quite a bit of that in 
the past. Over the last year, that influence has almost ceased, 
or is at least negligible. It seems to me that now everyone has 
understood that defense of the country is the patriotic 
obligation of citizens and that this cannot be contrary to the 
program of any party. 
  [Popovic] You say that there has also been an increased 
response of recruits in the units of your corps; do you have 
precise figures, for example, on how recruits from those areas 
are reporting to do required military service? 
  [Djokic] The response of conscripts from the territory of 
the 
Nis Military District and military sectors in the zone of 
responsibility of the Leskovac Corps was higher than 100 percent 
in the September induction period; that is because quite a few 
volunteers reported to do their required military service 
because they wanted to do it earlier. The response of conscripts 
from other areas to our units is somewhat below that, more 
precisely about 95 percent. Thanks to additional efforts of our 
unit, we nevertheless exceeded the number required to man our 
units. These percentages do not apply to conscripts of Skipetar 
or Muslim nationality, who still are responding to the draft 
either scantily or almost not at all. 
  [Popovic] It is well-known, General, that you train 
conscripts according to the drafts of the new training 
curricula. How have they been accepted in your units, and how 
are you getting along in the general lack of money? 
  [Djokic] Experience so far has shown that those curricula 
provide good conditions for training men and officers 
successfully and quickly to perform the tasks assigned them. 
Further practice will certainly point up a need for minor 
corrections, which will contribute still more to their quality 
and adapt them to the real needs of units. 
  The shortage of supplies and funds has been adversely 
affecting the process of combat training insofar as we are 
unable to continuously renew certain expendable supplies such 
as, for example, sources of electric power, for which fresh 
financial resources are always needed. In no case can the 
shortage of money stop the training process. 
  [Popovic] An unavoidable question in that connection is how 
much the lack of money affects the soldier's standard of living? 
  [Djokic] We share the fate of all members of the Army of 
Yugoslavia, and, as far as I know, most of our people. It is 
hard to say it, but for several months we have been feeding the 
soldiers only canned food. Whatever efforts we made, we were 
altogether unable to buy fresh meat. Now, we have nevertheless 
found some sources of our own for the supply of meat, fruit, and 
vegetables, because last summer and fall we sent some of our 
personnel to harvest crops in the work organization "Delises," 
and we also offered help to "Porecje" in Vucje. Now, we are 
getting fresh fruit and vegetables from their coolers as we need 
them. Thanks to cooperation with "Mesokombinat," we have 
replenished our facilities for fattening hogs. We have also 
gotten feed, and we will have larger quantities of fresh meat in 
the spring, through an arrangement that is mutually satisfactory 
and advantageous. 
  [Popovic] Are the officers also in a better position? 
  [Djokic] When it comes to the standard of living of 
officers, 
the situation is still more serious. Regardless of the efforts 
we have made to provide winter supplies and fuel at more 
favorable prices, some of the officers still have not managed to 
prepare for the coming winter. Those officers and their families 
who came to our units without anything from the secessionist 
republics are in the most difficult situation. At the moment, we 
have more than 260 families who do not even have housing. 
  [Popovic] In these confusing times, General, we very often 
forget those who were our associates until recently. How are 
"your" pensioners living, and how are they getting along? 
  [Djokic] We have not forgotten them. Nor have we forgotten 
the disabled persons and survivors of those who were killed in 
the last war. We provided winter supplies and fuel both for 
ourselves and also for them. We delivered fuel right to the door 
of disabled persons. Insofar as the law, and, of course, our own 
capabilities, allow, we are also providing financial assistance, 
but all of that, unfortunately, is less than modest. At this 
point, it is difficult for everyone, but pensioners who were 
awarded a well-deserved pension during this last year are in a 
particularly unenviable position if they still have not managed 
to get their bearings and find a way to supplement their small 
pensions with any other sources of income. 
  [Popovic] There was a long wait for adoption of the new law 
on the VJ. Has any significant change occurred since its 
adoption? 
  [Djokic] We are inclined to justify all manner of things by 
looking for an excuse even in the absence of a regulation so 
that we would have a respite and justification for certain 
oversights that certainly should not have occurred. The new law 
has now created all the preconditions to rightly require greater 
accountability not only of individuals in the Army, but also of 
structures outside the VJ, which are also responsible for 
defense of this country. Because, as I have said, we have been 
forced into a difficult material situation, we are greatly 
restricted in performing our obligations, which does not mean 
that we are not where we ought to be and that our people are not 
ready to perform their missions which the homeland expects of 
them. The measures which are now being taken to straighten out 
the situation with personnel are bringing about conditions for 
full successful performance of all tasks assigned to our units. 
This is a job on which up to now we have been rather sluggish, 
slow, irresolute, and inconsistent. Now that the law has been 
adopted, we need to adopt as soon as possible other regulations 
and complete the process of straightening out the personnel 
problems of units. The time in which we trained obedient 
operatives is behind us. We must bring to the leadership of our 
units and institutions brave officers who have initiative of 
their own, who are ready to take a risk and complete their part 
of the job, assuming full responsibility for what they have 
done. The Law on the Army offers us that opportunity. If we take 
advantage of it, each of us will precisely know and have his own 
obligations and his own rights. 
  [Popovic] Will the incisions made in personnel policy leave 
us without a bureaucracy or without field officers? 
  [Djokic] The bureaucracy is a product of the society in 
which 
we live. Just as it multiplied in society at large, so it has 
also found fertile ground in the Army. During this time, we have 
had numerous and cumbersome commands with many departments and 
staff officers who were always thinking up new jobs for new 
departments and new staff officers. We have had filing cabinets 
full of all kinds of analyses and studies which never did anyone 
any good. Because of the financial conditions we have been 
facing, in the course of just a few restructurings we have made 
a radical turnaround and considerably reduced that structure for 
direction and command. I have the impression that at the same 
time we have not reduced the amount of work as much as we have 
the number of people, so that now we have a situation where some 
essential staff officers are really burdened and cannot manage 
to do all the work.

<F P=106> [Article by Damir Dukic: "The Serbian Scrap-Iron Navy Is </F>
Moving From Kumbor"] 
  [Text] The Navy of "Yugoslavia's" armed forces intends to 
create yet another refuge for its rusty fleet 7 km north of 
Ulcinj, almost at the southernmost end of the Montenegrin coast. 
We are talking about Valdanos Bay, the only inlet in that part 
of the coast which has natural features for building a naval 
base. This is the only way in which the leading Serbian 
"navigators" intend to remedy the numerous complexes acquired 
with disintegration of the once respectable Yugonavy, now that 
it has been driven from most of the Adriatic. 
  For quite a long time now, the vessels of the Serbian Navy 
have been floating in close quarters in the ports of Kumbor and 
Tivat in Kotor Bay. The narrow entrance to the "bride of the 
Adriatic" is no problem to spot from outside, so that the 
"floating scrap pile," as Italian Admiral Acquille Zanonni 
recently called the Yugoslav Navy, is in a fearful 
claustrophobic panic. It thus needs a way out, deliberation from 
its phobia, but also from the loser's syndrome which has greatly 
affected the souls of the officers there. But there are other 
reasons for building a naval base at Valdanos as well. One is 
certainly to change the composition of the population in the 
Ulcinj part of the coast, which is unfavorable for the Serbs. 
When that area is militarized and the families of Serbian 
officers move there, the high share of Montenegrins and 
Albanians in the ethnic composition of the population there will 
be offset to some extent. 
  Another reason for building a naval base in that bay lies in 
the constant fear of an external enemy. Serbian strategists, 
that is, have estimated that it is only in that region that the 
international forces conducting the naval blockade off the coast 
of Montenegro could land marines. That is why they set up a 
radar station even earlier in the hills above what previously 
was the military vacation resort at Valdanos, but also numerous 
fortifications and gun emplacements. 
<H5>  Defect--The Proximity of Albania </H5>
  All of this in fact confirms certain earlier tendencies 
shown 
by the Serbian top government leadership. That is, there were 
signs even in the past that that top leadership was moving more 
and more toward industrial nourishment of the warmaking spirit, 
little by little transforming their economy and industrial 
potential toward military production, the only industry in "FR 
Yugoslavia" which is still somehow getting by. Within that 
context, there is a possibility of military industrial plants 
being moved or established in the Montenegrin hills, especially 
when we bear in mind that sizable ground forces are already 
concentrated above Valdanos Bay, but nothing close to what is 
just now being planned. 
  The naval base at Valdanos, that is, has one important 
defect--it is close to the Albanian border. Should there be a 
real military conflict with its southern neighbor, "FR 
Yugoslavia" must secure the hinterland of the Navy stationed at 
the future base, although that will not help it much because 
Valdanos is within range of Albanian artillery, which is not a 
comfortable realization for Serbian officers. What is more, 
Valdanos does not have the necessary depth (the bay is only some 
15 meters deep), and it is barely broad enough to allow two 
large vessels to maneuver at the same time. 
<H5>  Outmoded Missiles </H5>
  Nevertheless, in spite of all these deficiencies, the 
project 
of a naval base at Valdanos is nevertheless moving toward 
realization. Aside from the reasons already given, among which 
we should emphasize once again that this is the only bay on the 
Montenegrin coast which has the natural features for something 
of this kind, achievement of this plan for a naval base would 
certainly have a large psychological impact on the unnecessary 
and outmoded vessels which at the moment are only discharging 
oil into Kotor Bay and serving as potential targets. In terms of 
the number of vessels, of course, this is still an impressive 
fleet, but the level of its maintenance is indicated by the 
"incident" that occurred a year ago during the visit to the Navy 
by Milan Panic and Zivota Panic, who at that time were the 
Yugoslav prime minister and chief of the General Staff, 
respectively. Just as those two left a warship, it began to sink 
for no apparent reason. 
  Even if the Yugonavy were not so neglected and rotten, it 
would not be able to accept engagement on the open sea. In 
addition to the chronic shortage of trained personnel, it is 
also troubled by the fact that it is no longer suitable for the 
altered circumstances of a potential naval war. That is, the 
number of warships, which still seems frightening at first, was 
adapted in its structure to defending the coast of Croatia, 
exploiting the natural advantages of the numerous Croatian 
islands and bays. Lora, near Split, was to be the main point of 
support, and Vis and Lastovo were strong detached fortresses. 
That is why the ships were mainly fast and light, able to jump 
out at an enemy from behind a peninsula or island and to hide 
still more quickly in the next cove. 
  However, the Montenegrin coast is not very indented, and 
coastal artillery located on the hills there can be used 
effectively for its defense. But domination beyond territorial 
waters (12 nautical miles from the coast) can be achieved only 
with the help of large ships, cruisers, for example. But the 
Serbian Navy lacks them. Perhaps it would welcome the 
"surface-to-surface" missiles which the Yugonavy was purchasing 
in sizable quantities from Sweden, but they have mainly been 
taken as war booty by the Croatian Navy. Those missiles they 
still possess are outmoded and of poor quality. Nor can they 
boast of strong coastal artillery, because they were compelled 
to install ordinary "field" guns for that purpose. Here again 
they were "crippled" by the Croats, who captured numerous 
coastal batteries. 
<H5>  River Submarine </H5>
  In spite of all that, Dojcilo Isakovic, commander of the 
Serbian Navy, a Chetnik from Lora well-known to the people of 
Split who at one time made a "reputation" with the published 
secret plans to build a new Serbian weapon--a river 
submarine--which was supposed to strike horror into enemies and 
be the envy of the world, but actually was an unprecedented 
stupidity, has been persistently repeating the story to the 
effect that the fleet was successfully evacuated from Croatia, 
mostly thanks to none other than himself. Dojcilo says that the 
Croats have only what the Serbs intentionally left them, and 
that amounts to three vessels that were under repair. In this 
way, Rear Adm. Isakovic is laying the groundwork for his glory 
in the war, now that he has already managed to prove himself to 
be a "Serb from head to toe." But his stories can at the very 
least be regarded as lies and arrogant boasting, because he 
"gave" to the Croatian Navy more than 30 vessels, among them the 
most modern--the missile-carrying fast attack craft which now 
bears the name of King Petar Kresimir IV. When we look at the 
"gifts," Dojcilo and Milan Zec, his chief of staff, did not 
deserve to be decorated and promoted, but to be tried for 
treason. 
  All that we have said obviously serves to promote still 
further the dream of "martial glory" which is supposed to take 
up full-fledged positions in the "Serbian sea" as well. 
Something like that is the purpose of the plan to which we have 
referred to build an expensive naval base at Valdanos intended 
for the "scrap pile," pointing out at the same time that the top 
Serbian leadership has not the slightest intention of developing 
the tourist potential and collecting foreign exchange from 
foreign visitors, but intends to improve military industrial 
plants, pursue general militarization, and make money from the 
sale of arms. No question of good-neighborly relations; they are 
a permanent threat to the peace.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Cebalovic: "When Will the Oil Start Flowing </F>
in the Pipeline?"] 
  [Excerpts] The normalization of relations between 
Yugoslavia and Croatia calls for, among other things, the 
beginning of the operation of the Omisalj (on the island of 
Krk)-Pancevo oil pipeline. Zagreb wished for something like that 
to happen earlier, and so did Hungary, the Czech Republic, and 
Slovakia, which used to receive through this pipeline 
significant quantities of petroleum that they needed, especially 
since the once brotherly USSR route "had dried up." 
  In spite of a great number of problems that are difficult to 
resolve, it is possible for oil to start flowing in the pipeline 
as soon as Belgrade and Zagreb agree. However, one should not 
forget that 120 km of the pipeline pass through the republic of 
Serbian Krajina (RSK), and it is thus clear that the agreement 
between Yugoslavia and Croatia is very unlikely to be effective 
without the consent of Knin. When we wrote about the pipeline 
earlier, Knin repeatedly stated that "the oil can continue to go 
to Zagreb only if they return the confiscated Serbian oil and if 
they pay for the transit through the RSK." Is Knin going to 
maintain this position? If it is, it is very unlikely that the 
oil pipeline will start operating very soon. 
  Everything happened on 6 September 1991, when the official 
on 
duty at the oil pipeline in Novi Sad recorded the information he 
received at 1404 hours from Sisak that, due to damage, the 
pipeline had stopped operating. [passage omitted] 
  Because of this act, 130,000 metric tons of oil intended for 
the Pancevo refinery and 82,000 tons for the Novi Sad refinery 
remained on Krk. Before the closing of the pipeline, blackmail 
had been arriving from Zagreb for several months, and every oil 
delivery intended for Serbia was charged a higher tax. 
Everything was paid for regularly, together with the transit 
costs. Zagreb did not permit even the unloading without proof of 
payment. 
  But they were mistaken in Zagreb when they thought that they 
could cut off the delivery of oil to Serbia and deliver it in an 
undisturbed manner to the Slovene firm Lendava, to Hungary, and 
to former Czechoslovakia. The control valves were in the RSK, in 
Banija. The oil, of course stopped coming. [passage omitted] 
  The story of the pipeline is a long one. It started in 1966. 
[passage omitted]. All the accumulated problems continued up to 
1991. Nothing has been resolved: who the owners are (Croats say 
that they are), how much oil there is in the pipeline and to 
whom it belongs, the cost of transport, and who will manage the 
facility. Nor has it been established who invested in the 
construction of the pipeline and how much. How can now all of 
that be resolved?

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 20 January edition of the Belgrade 
daily POLITIKA, in a page 9 article examining the social program 
section of "The Program for the Reconstruction of the Monetary 
System and Economic Stabilization of Yugoslavia," says that its 
main goal is to shift the burden of social welfare from 
enterprises and the economic sector to the state. The article 
cites Mirosinka Dinkic, an employee of the Belgrade Economic 
Institute who participated in the drafting of the social 
program, who states that the problem of surplus workers has to 
be resolved as soon as the program goes into effect because "the 
economy cannot function efficiently if the current number of 
employees remains. This means that in the entire economic sector 
-- excepting private firms -- out of a total of 1,780,000 
employees, there is a surplus of 1 million workers." Thus, 
virtually every firm will be faced with downsizing in order to 
improve its business operations. According to the program's 
assessment, 200,000 people currently employed in firms all over 
Yugoslavia own land, and such people will inevitably have to 
return to their land and be without work permits. It is up to 
the firms to decide when and how this will be done but if they 
want to succeed, they will have to do it as soon as possible, 
Dinkic says. Dinkic points out, in addition, that it has been 
assessed that about 100,000 workers in public enterprisesalso 
own private firms which, in the future, should become their only 
businesses. About 500,000 of the workers who will lose their 
jobs will receive 50 percent of their salaries as unemployment 
compensation from the state budget for a period of one year.

  [Text] A plane from Russia with 22 metric tons of 
humanitarian aid for distressed children and humanitarian 
organizations in Yugoslavia and eastern Bosnia arrived at Surcin 
Airport yesterday afternoon. 
  The shipment contains 20 tons of food for babies and small 
children and two tons of indispensable medications such as 
penicillin, other antibiotics, and diarrhea remedies. Two-thirds 
of the shipment will stay in Yugoslavia; one-third will be 
distributed in eastern Bosnia, according to Lindel Sachs, 
spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Belgrade. 
  According to Mrs. Sachs, this is the first humanitarian 
shipment of food from Russia. Prior to this, only teams of 
drivers used to come from Russia to drive trucks through the war 
zones. 
  "Our office was accorded the honor of organizing the 
distribution of the shipment, which is always welcome in these 
regions," said Lindel Sachs. 
  The donor of this humanitarian aid is the State Committee of 
the Russian Federation for Elimination of Consequences of 
Natural Disasters and for Civilian Aid; the intermediary is the 
Russian Embassy in Belgrade; while the distributor is the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees in Belgrade.

<F P=106> [Article by I.B.: "Unions Dissatisfied With Minimum Wage of </F>
20 Super Dinars"] 
  [Text] Belgrade -- The Serbian Government's decree to 
guarantee a minimum wage of 20 "super dinars" (20 German marks 
[DM]) to every employee was adopted without the consensus of the 
trade union negotiating team. Union representatives reminded the 
public on Wednesday that unions were again excluded from such an 
important matter as the agreement on minimum pay. At the same 
time they denied all responsibility for renewed protests by 
workers. 
  That there will be new strikes is evident from the data that 
20 dinars are not even enough to buy a liter of milk and 600 
gram of bread a day. The cost of the daily consumer basket is 
equal to the minimum monthly pay. To buy just bread and milk, a 
worker would need 39 "super dinars" a month, twice the minimum 
wage. 
  As a result, 800 IMT workers blocked Tosin Bunar Street in 
front of their factory in Novi Belgrade on Tuesday. They 
demanded from the government an immediate one-time payment of 
DM100 per employee, a regular supply of food and other 
necessities, and a guaranteed monthly income to enable their 
families "to survive and not to starve." 
  More than 600 Zastava workers from Kragujevac announced a 
general strike on Wednesday. These are the employees of the 
defense plant, which is the only one still in operation. The 
Kragujevac "gunsmiths" demand pay of DM20 a week as well as the 
resignation of Director Vukasin Filipovic, whom they accuse of 
numerous abuses. The Kragujevac workers announced: "No appeals 
or pressures from Belgrade will stop our strike. It is easier 
for us to sit hungry than to work hungry."

<F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Patriarch Pavle by Mirjana Kuburovic </F>
in Belgrade; date not given: "The Healthy Do Not Need a Doctor"] 
  [Excerpts] His Holiness Serbian Patriarch Pavle 
consented to the request of the editors of NIN for a Christmas 
interview to be published in the first issue of this weekly, 
which in the future will be independent. He received us in the 
red salon of the Patriarch's Palace in Belgrade, which is 
"reserved" for all official visits to the head of the Serbian 
Orthodox Church. Visibly fatigued because of his numerous duties 
and still more frequent requests from many foreign media wishing 
to convey what the patriarch has to say in their respective 
countries, Patriarch Pavle responded--in his own way--to all the 
questions we put to him. 
  [Kuburovic] It is often said--in differing connotations, 
unfortunately--that the Serbs are a chosen people, "people of 
heaven." What, in your opinion, Your Holiness, does that mean, 
and where is that promised land of Serbia? 
  [Pavle] You recall the words of Mother Jevrosima, that is, 
the words of our people spoken through the person of Mother 
Jevrosima: "Do not, son, speak falsely, influenced either by 
your father or your uncles, but look only to the justice of the 
true God. Better to lose your head than to commit a sin against 
your soul." Those lines contain in compressed form the 
historical and evangelical view of the Serbian people, the rule, 
the core and soul of that people, by which it has lived for 
centuries. It is true that we are men, children, of the earth, 
but we are also children of heaven. That is why down through the 
centuries there have been members of our people--both men and 
women--who have achieved the ideal of the evangelical doctrine: 
Saint Sava, Saint Basil of Ostrog, Saint Peter of Cetinje, Holy 
Prince Lazar, and so many others. We who live in these times are 
of the same flesh and blood as they were, and so we should 
strive to be the chosen people, that is, to live according to 
evangelical principles. That, as far as I am able to understand, 
is what it means to say that the Serbs are a chosen people. 
  [Kuburovic] A chosen people, then, is a people that tries to 
live according to all the principles of justice.... 
  [Pavle] Yes. According to the principles of justice, God's 
truth, and everything that is holy and honorable and acceptable 
to dear God. But to generalize and to say that all Serbs are 
holy and honorable is not only inaccurate, it is immoral, to say 
the least. So, we can only say with pride that there have been 
individuals in our people who have set the standard, and it is 
from them that we came to be called the chosen people and chosen 
Serbia. But to say that all Serbs have been such, we do not even 
dream of thinking that. 
  [Kuburovic] Does that mean that every people, thanks to 
honorable individuals who have set the standard for entire 
generations, can at a particular moment refer to themselves as 
chosen? 
  [Pavle] Our church deals with quality, not quantity. It is 
not the number of believers that is important, but the sincerity 
and depth of their belief. This is pointed out to us by the Lord 
himself and Jesus when he refers to Moses tending the sheep of 
his father-in-law Jethro in the desert. He saw a bramble bush 
that was burning, but was not consumed. Moses went to see this 
sight and heard a voice from the bush: "Moses, put off thy shoes 
from they feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy 
ground. I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God 
of Jacob." Abraham is the father, Isaac the son, and Jacob the 
grandson. God refers to himself as the God of three men from 
three different generations, although there were millions of 
people in each of those generations. God does not refer to 
himself as the God of the millions, but the God of the holy. It 
is up to us, then, to try among the millions to be people who 
are not inhuman, but among those individuals who strive toward 
divine justice. 
  [Kuburovic] Recently, public interest of both believers and 
others has focused on a letter which you sent out some time ago 
to the clergy of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which in a way 
fixed how much a priest could collect for his services. What is 
that about? 
  [Pavle] Saint Paul the Apostle, in referring to maintenance 
of the Old Testament clergy, told the Christians: "Do ye not 
know that they which minister about holy things live of the 
things of the temple, and they which wait at the altar are 
partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that 
they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel" (1 
Corinthians 9:13-14). It is clear, then, that the faithful have 
a duty to support their pastors who preach God's word to them 
and perform services for them. 
  Over time, that maintenance has been provided in various 
ways. Now, in most of our church this is done by the believers, 
when services are performed, providing funds to the priest for 
his support, either in money or in kind. This is not the buying 
and selling of God's blessing, nor, as it is said, "a charge for 
clerical services." The letter pointed out that the 
parishioners' ability to pay must be taken into account, the 
priest must bear in mind that now it is a question of survival 
for both under these great economic difficulties. 
  [Kuburovic] Does that mean that the priests of the Serbian 
Orthodox Church do not receive a monthly salary when they are 
supported by the contributions of their congregation? 
  [Pavle] Ever since the war, priests have not had any pay 
except what they received from their congregation. To be sure, 
in the practice of the Christian church, and this goes back 
almost 2,000 years, and in many countries that principle is 
respected even today, congregations support their own priests. 
To be sure, priests had a duty to take only as much as they 
really needed, but today it is difficult to make a strict 
definition as to how much is really needed. And we have been 
informed that there are priests who have been raising their 
standard of living in an unexemplary way and at the expense of 
their congregation, which accounts for these disagreements, 
dissatisfaction, and criticism. [passage omitted] 
  [Kuburovic] Some of your actions, including the frequent use 
of public transportation, surprised the public. Although many of 
our people have now become accustomed to meeting you on the 
street, in a bus, or in a train, they nevertheless wonder: Why 
is the Serbian patriarch not traveling by car like his 
predecessors? 
  [Pavle] I have heard that there are people who think that 
this is some kind of posturing on my part, because, as a man on 
the street told me, "I understand that there are times when 
there is a need to astonish people." That view is utterly 
foreign to me as well as to Christianity in general. People 
probably do not know that I come from the country, that after 
the war I lived for a long time in an area where there was no 
public transportation, and usually one had to go on foot, and 
even when there were vehicles, the monasteries were almost 
always left far from the main highway. In these times today, we 
have all forgotten man's real need to walk, to clean his lungs 
and limber up his legs. For years, I have been accustomed to 
walk and this is no difficulty for me. But people are people, 
they interpret everything according to their own thinking. I 
will not deny that the patriarchate has a car and gasoline, but 
in these times of scarcity it is essential to preserve what we 
have. What would happen if we had no reserve of fuel in the 
patriarchate and the patriarch of Istanbul came to visit? We 
would certainly be in an inextricable position, but people from 
the rest of the world have a hard time understanding our 
troubles. 
  [Kuburovic] Your Holiness, you are a man known for not 
liking 
to attract public attention. Still, there have been very 
frequent occasions when some act of yours caused a stir. I am 
thinking specifically of Arkan's visit to the patriarchate and 
to you personally. There is talk that in connection with that 
visit about 300 priests held a meeting and informed you that 
they objected to your having received him. Many are therefore 
wondering whether you are aware that in these times of political 
ferment there are party leaders who will represent that meeting 
as an expression of your support for his party and policy? 
  [Pavle] I receive people in politics mainly as people, not 
as 
presidents or members of this or that party. That was also my 
approach in this case, considering it my obligation to meet 
everyone who requests this of me on the spiritual plane. Those 
are the reasons why I acceded to the call of a man condemned to 
death to visit him in the Nis prison and take his confession. I 
also went to Zabela near Pozarevac to talk to a man sentenced to 
20 years in prison, just as I responded to the call of Vuk 
Draskovic when he was in prison. Why, then, would I not receive 
Zeljko "Arkan" Raznatovic as well? I have made use of all these 
meetings with political figures to call upon them, assuming that 
they have certain influence, never to forget that it is their 
obligation to always behave as men and adhere to the principles 
of the Gospel. I remind those who have forgotten that Christ 
said: "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to 
repentance." And then He said: "They that are whole have no need 
of the physician, but they that are sick." Seeing it as my 
pastoral duty that I should always talk to all people who seek 
it of me, I am ready to accommodate whenever I can. 
  [Kuburovic] But you do not deny that certain people want to 
misuse the meeting with you in an attempt to use the church for 
certain interests of their own? 
  [Pavle] It is true that some people want, not only want, but 
are in fact striving, to tie the church to their own boat and 
yoke it up to their own cart. We all know that there are people 
in politics today who want to manipulate everyone and 
everything, including the church, but we in the Serbian Orthodox 
Church cannot reconcile ourselves to that. The church does not 
want to pull the wool over anyone's eyes by manipulating the 
doctrine of the Gospel, but it likewise tries to protect itself 
from all those who would use it, lead it, and mislead it. 
  [Kuburovic] Does that mean that the Serbian Orthodox Church 
is neutral, more precisely, uninterested in politics? 
  [Pavle] We know it is not possible to be neutral, and that 
is 
why we always try to act for the good of our people, but in such 
a way that that action does not harm any other people either. 
The church, and the Serbian Orthodox Church in particular, has 
never wanted to govern all and everything in this world; it has 
always tried to be what the father is in the family, making 
itself heard only when some serious situation arises. It is the 
role of the church to advise both the people and individuals 
what their duty is, which often we forget when some very serious 
situation arises. 
  [Kuburovic] For years now, along with all the other troubles 
which have befallen it, the Serbian Orthodox Church has suffered 
from a dangerous disease: dissension. Incidentally, other 
Orthodox churches have not been spared this either, they also 
have their dissenters. Therefore, Your Holiness, please give us 
your comment on the events in Cetinje on Saint Luke's Day. Is 
autocephaly something to be demanded when someone has a 
political need for it? And why do you think atheists are so 
interested in having "their own" church? 
  [Pavle] The church was established 2,000 years ago in order 
to serve the people, but not to serve it by human measure, but 
by the measure that comes from God, and that means that it 
ennobles the intrinsic characteristics of any people. If the 
church, however, exceeds that measure, and because of interests 
that come from this world it misses its aim and ceases to be the 
"pillar and bastion of the truth," allowing people to hitch it 
up to their own cart, then the church ceases to be God's church 
and becomes a political church. It does not surprise us, then, 
that the atheists should be striving to hitch the church up to 
their cart, because they understand the role the church has and 
could have among people, and so they want to use it for their 
own purposes. Our duty, I am referring to the church, is not to 
allow ourselves to be manipulated. Not because we want to be 
above everyone else and to tell everyone what to do, but simply 
because it is the obligation of the church to act for the good 
of all men. 
  As for the church in Montenegro, it has always been a part 
of 
the Serbian Orthodox Church. Presumably, Patriarch Arsenije III 
Carnojevic, who was born in Cetinje, and then Bishop Visarion, 
and Bishop Sava, and then Bishop Peter I the Holy, and Bishop 
Peter II, knew to what nationality they belonged and what church 
they served. People who do not understand that, and it rather 
appears they do not want to understand it, the less truth they 
have in their hands and the weaker their evidence, the louder 
they get. We should therefore remember the principle of the Holy 
Father that in conversation we be mild in our speech and strong 
in our evidence. Never the other way around. That is why it is 
clear to us--upon hearing the strong words in Cetinje in defense 
of a so-called independent Montenegrin church--we realized that 
they had no evidence at all. You could see that these people 
shouting in Cetinje, talking about some church of their own, did 
not even attempt to cross themselves. 
  [Kuburovic] It seems that the Cetinje dissension is a 
continuation of what happened a few decades ago according to the 
Macedonian formula, which is special because church dignitaries 
are chosen by the acclamation of the "people," that is, by a 
particular policy. 
  [Pavle] Back in Turkish times in Montenegro, the popular 
assembly did choose the political ruler, but never the spiritual 
ruler. To be sure, it is another matter that in Montenegro the 
spiritual and political leaders were often the same person. The 
final split with the church in Macedonia, which has not been 
recognized by any Orthodox patriarchate in the world, actually 
occurred because our church could not allow spiritual leaders to 
be elected in a secular council. It was clear to everyone that 
this was a case of political abuse. 
  [Kuburovic] Now that splits in Orthodoxy have been 
mentioned, 
we cannot fail to ask you whether suffering in common has 
brought the Orthodox peoples closer together and unified them? 
After all, by all appearances today it is somehow the Orthodox 
peoples suffering the most: the Russians, Jews, Serbs, and the 
sanctions against our country are not bringing any good to the 
Bulgarians, Romanians, and Greeks, inflicting immense financial 
loss on them. 
  [Pavle] The Orthodox peoples have always had something that 
joined them together, and that unity in trouble has become still 
more pronounced and direct. You recall that Njegos said: 
"Sympathy is a kind of support." It is enough for someone to 
understand us, and if at the same time they offer material and 
spiritual support, that is exceedingly important. There is a 
rule that troubles shake up a person, indeed even entire 
nations, so that they are able to sense what is essential, what 
brings them closer to others. All of us Orthodox peoples have a 
need for us to support one another with our common faith, to do 
what we can--not less--and what is in our power, and what the 
time and occasion requires, we believe that God will act on our 
behalf, as he has done for our ancestors. 
  [Kuburovic] Some people say of this time that it is a time 
of 
trial for Orthodoxy and Christianity in general. 
  [Pavle] To be sure, in the place where they arose 2,000 
years 
ago--in Egypt, Palestine, and the East--Orthodoxy and 
Christianity have been almost entirely wiped out. Only God knows 
why this is the case. But if there must be suffering for the 
truth and justice, then it is 1,000 times better for us to 
disappear because of the truth and justice than for us to remain 
on the road of falsehood, injustice, and evil. 
  [Kuburovic] Is not a world congress for the Orthodox peoples 
and churches more necessary in this time than ever before? Is 
that precisely what representatives of the 14 regional Orthodox 
churches from all over the world agreed on some time ago in 
Geneva? 
  [Pavle] Since the eighth century, the Orthodox Church has 
for 
one reason or another never had a worldwide congress, and the 
issues have built up over the centuries. All the Orthodox 
churches and peoples have a common need to resolve them. I 
cannot say when the long-awaited Eighth World Congress of 
Orthodox Churches and Peoples will take place. There are 
difficulties in organizing the congress, from the question of 
where to meet to political pressures and the Iron Curtain behind 
which various Orthodox churches have lived at one time or 
another. The Geneva meeting of representatives of the world's 
Orthodox churches of which you speak will certainly help to 
clear the way to holding future meetings and to resolving the 
very important issues such as qualifying for autocephaly. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Kuburovic] You talk to foreign journalists almost daily. 
What do they ask you most frequently, Your Holiness, do they 
understand that the world has contributed to the occurrence in 
the former Yugoslavia of what none of the nationalities would 
have wished upon themselves? 
  [Pavle] It is true that we frequently meet foreign 
journalists, whom I try to introduce to things which I know are 
not easy for them to understand. When they ask me: Who is to 
blame for this unfortunate Yugoslav war? I answer what I really 
think--that we ourselves are most to blame, and that means the 
Serbs, the Croats, and the Muslims, but that Europe and the 
United States also have a share in all our troubles. It is 
difficult, however, for foreigners to understand our 
reality--our historic divisions not only from the time of World 
War II, but also earlier--even when they are the most 
well-intentioned, but especially if they have certain interests 
of their own. Unfortunately, the world wants to fit us with a 
cap made for itself. 
  One of the journalists from the outside world to whom I 
talked recently seems to have gotten a good understanding of the 
world's influence on the disintegration of the former 
Yugoslavia, and he told me: "What are you going to do when the 
breakup of Yugoslavia is often being decided on by people who do 
not distinguish Slavonia from Slovenia or Slovakia?" Thus, I 
have been accused, after a recent visit to Austria, of talking 
about events in Bosnia and making no distinction between the 
Muslims and the Turks. Those who make those utterly groundless 
accusations against me perhaps do not know that I lived in 
Bosnia for 10 years before the war when I was going to junior 
high school in Tuzla and in the classroom I had a Muslim on one 
side and a Croat on the other. So I know Bosnia quite well, I do 
not confuse the Turks with the Muslims, but neither do I accept 
that the Muslims are Bosnians, that is, autochthonous, and the 
Serbs aggressors who came I know not from where, presumably from 
Serbia, having decided to drive that autochthonous people from 
its home. If people in the outside world took a bit more care 
with the facts, the historical facts, they would know that as 
far back as the 10th century Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus 
mentioned the Serbs in Bosnia, saying that they had a border 
with the Croats at Livno and on the River Cetina. Historical 
facts are historical facts: In the 12th century, the Priest 
Dukljanin records that the Serbs were settled from the great 
River Drina westward, which is called Bosnia, but eastward all 
the way to Lab in Kosovo. Ignorant of this or not wishing to 
know it, some people would at this point like to prove to us 
that the Serbs belong only in Serbia. 
  It seems some people want to prove that the only place for 
the Serbian Orthodox Church is in Serbia, and so they are 
bombing the seats of the bishops, the church treasuries, 
temples, and ancient monasteries. The most recent in the series 
of these unfortunate examples occurred on the night of the 
Catholic Christmas in Karlovac, where the headquarters of the 
Orthodox bishop was bombed, the building was destroyed, and no 
one knows what happened to the rich treasury, whether it was 
looted or buried. 
  [Kuburovic] All of this is happening at a time when the 
metropolitan of Zagreb and Ljubljana has been asked by the 
government to return to Zagreb for the Orthodox Christmas, 
having fled from there two and a half years ago. How will the 
Serbian Orthodox Church react to all that? 
  [Pavle] In principle, as I understand it, no one has the 
right to prevent church officials from visiting their 
congregations and directing them. I am referring here not only 
to the Orthodox, but to priests of the other faiths as well. But 
in reality it is different: Seven Orthodox bishops cannot return 
to their seats, and a new trouble has occurred, an explosive 
charge was planted in the bishop's palace in Karlovac. How can 
the Serbian Orthodox Church, then, tell Bishop Nikanor of Upper 
Karlovac to return to Karlovac or Bishop Lukijan to go back to 
Pakrac, when they have nothing to go back to there? That is why 
the church will not tell anyone to go or not to go, but it is 
clear to everyone that the conditions do not exist for going 
back, at least for the present. We know of the need, the 
important need, for priests to be with their people, but it is 
difficult to expect people, not only if they have a family, but 
even if they are monks, to risk their lives for the church they 
serve. We hope that the time will come when priests can return 
among their believers in safety. 
  [Kuburovic] Are you encouraged, Your Holiness, by the fact 
that at the recent ecumenical meeting in Pecuj representatives 
of all the religious communities of the former Yugoslavia 
unanimously signed the declaration condemning not only the war, 
but also the sanctions? 
  [Pavle] We are, of course, encouraged that everyone 
unanimously--all the representatives of the Roman Catholics, the 
Orthodox, and members of the Islamic Religious 
Community--condemned the war and the sanctions, although, it is 
true, they did not mention by name against whom those sanctions 
were imposed. It is good to see a change beginning in the 
conception that there is no collective guilt of one people, 
because war crimes are committed only by individuals, not by 
entire peoples. We have always felt and have tried to represent 
to the world that in these times we cannot behave as in the time 
of Hitler and Mussolini, who punished entire peoples for a 
nonexistent collective guilt. To our great regret, again in the 
case of the Serbian people the world has applied the principle 
of collective punishment to an entire people. It is therefore a 
particular success that representatives of the religious 
communities from the former Yugoslavia unanimously condemned the 
war and the sanctions, and sanctions were applied only against 
the Serbs. 
  [Kuburovic] Does it not seem to you that the outside world, 
although it does not recognize its own participation in 
provoking the Yugoslav war, is trying in a way to correct its 
mistake by issuing permits to the Serbian Orthodox Church to 
import 4,000 metric tons of food from Bulgaria and Greece? 
  [Pavle] It is true that the UN Security Council did issue us 
a permit to import a large quantity of food and drugs, but it is 
also true that the period of time given us to accomplish that is 
extremely short, and we are fearful about whether we will 
succeed in getting together the necessary funds. And a great 
deal is needed to purchase such a quantity of food and drugs. 
But let us hope that the Serbs in the outside world will once 
again this time help even more than they are able, and it is up 
to us to do everything to distribute the aid as fairly as 
possible. Unfortunately, it must also be said that people ready 
to take advantage of the suffering of others for their own 
personal gain always turn up in times of great trouble. 
So-called war profiteers are making money from the misfortune of 
their people. The government, of course, has a duty to protect 
us from such people, but while evidence has been found for many 
of them, innocent people are suffering. 
  [Kuburovic] At the time when this issue of NIN reaches its 
readers, we will be celebrating Christmas. What kind of 
Christmas message, Your Holiness, could you convey to all Serbs 
both in the country and abroad, but also to all people of 
goodwill all over the world? 
  [Pavle] I desire peace for all peoples in the world and hope 
that God will help so that no nation and no state in the world 
goes through what has befallen us. We need peace as the 
foundation of everything necessary in this world, and for us 
Christians Jesus represents our peace. He said: "I leave you My 
peace, I give you My peace." How necessary peace is and the 
extent to which we Orthodox know how to appreciate peace is 
evident in the liturgy of Saint John the Eloquent, which is used 
the most in the Orthodox Church. The word "peace" is mentioned 
more than 30 times in that liturgy. The reference is, of course, 
to man's peace with God, which then brings peace for man himself 
and all people. That need for peace is very strong in our 
people. That accounts for the custom of saying "God's peace be 
with you," a greeting that the Serbs have used down through the 
centuries on Christmas: "God's peace be with you! Christ is 
born," just as the Serbian people long ago understood the value 
and need for peace, I would like to see that peace prevail 
between our people and among all peoples in the world, both our 
friends and enemies, greeting them all with the old Serbian 
greeting on the holiday of Christ's birth: God's peace be with 
you--Christ is born!

<F P=106> [Commentary by Miroljub Jevtic: "The Masks Have Fallen"] </F>
  [Text] The arrest of almost the entire leadership of the 
Montenegrin branch of the Party for Democratic Action [SDA], 
including its president Harun Hadzic, precisely at the time of 
the trial of their compatriots in Novi Pazar, displays the 
party's real face. The authorities have found an arsenal of 
sophisticated infantry weapons in the apartments and hiding 
places of the leaders of this Muslim political party. The arms 
were intended to be used for bringing down the Montenegrin state. 
  The masks have, therefore, finally fallen. After this, how 
can anyone say that the critical remarks regarding the activity 
and behavior of this party were exaggerated and an "expression 
of inborn mistrust of the Muslims," which is how Alija 
Izetbegovic's followers like to qualify them? When their 
activity is linked with elements of the Novi Pazar indictment, 
which stress that their [the defendants'] goal was to carry out 
attacks on military buildings, the destruction of roads, and the 
liquidation of undesirable Muslim and Orthodox citizens, then 
the framework of the SDA mosaic is complete. To anyone who is 
vaguely familiar with the described game of this party, and the 
ideology that inspires it, this must have seemed inevitable. 
  From the very beginning, the founders of the SDA branches in 
Montenegro and Serbia took as their basic ideological foundation 
Alija Izetbegovic's political program, explained in the famous 
Islamic Declaration. It is practically a declaration of war on 
all those who think differently and quite directly stresses that 
the Muslims not only can, but should use the most brutal 
violence to stifle their opponents' resistance. 
  It is particularly important to note that the followers of 
the SDA, particularly of its leadership, did not have a choice, 
since the individuals in charge of purity of religion pointed 
out that this was the only real Islam. The now already former 
Reis Ul Ulema Jakub Selimovski, talking about Alija 
Izetbegovic's declaration, said the following: "Alija 
Izetbegovic's declaration expresses his opinion and views 
regarding things in general, based on his religious education 
and affiliation to Islam." Therefore, if the Reis himself -- a 
man who interprets what is, and what is not correct according to 
Islam -- says that Izetbegovic's declaration is based on real 
Islam, then it is logical that Harun Hadzic and the others -- as 
devout Muslims -- should act according to the norms prescribed 
by their religion. 
  The Yugoslav public, and particularly the authorities, have 
to be clear about the fact that this ideology will not stop 
bringing forth new branches for as long as Islam does not 
emancipate itself in the same way that Christianity has done, 
based on the principle -- religion on one side, politics on the 
other.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andras Agoston, leader of the Democratic </F>
Community of Vojvodina Hungarians, by S.P. Stamatovic; place and 
date not given: "The Plan Involves Tripartite Autonomy"] 
  [Text] "According to our basic concept, we demand 
tripartite autonomy: territorial, personal, and local. 
Territorial autonomy would encompass regions where our 
delegates won a majority in the regional Assemblies in Subotica, 
Kanjiza, Ada, Becej, Backa Topola, and Mali Idjos," Andras 
Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina 
Hungarians [DZVM], stated in the interview to BORBA yesterday, 
in response to what the Hungarians demand in Vojvodina. 
According to Agoston, personal autonomy incorporates the 
possibility that ethnic Hungarians alone manage affairs in the 
fields of culture, education, and media ("alone, but in 
compliance with laws and the Constitution"). The planning and 
organization of the cultural, educational, and media activities 
under personal autonomy would be carried out through the 
minority council of personal autonomy. 
  [Stamatovic] What is the principle according to which the 
council would be elected, and who would constitute it? 
  [Agoston] The council of personal autonomy would be elected 
according to the multiparty principle and members of all 
nationalities in Serbia may be elected in it. Those who declare 
themselves Hungarians would be voting, as well as those who do 
not declare themselves Hungarians but are using our 
institutions. Included in the process of forming the council and 
voting on it would be those who do not use our institutions, but 
are giving financial aid to those institutions. 
  [Stomatovic] What does local autonomy mean? 
  [Agoston] Local autonomy would mean that in the 16 townships 
in Vojvodina where ethnic Hungarians are in the majority, they 
themselves vote on their local councils, as is the usual 
practice in classic examples of local self-government the world 
over. 
  [Stomatovic] Rumors indicate that you have already held 
several talks with the president of Serbia on that matter, and 
that certain things have been promised to you. 
  [Agoston] No agreement exists. In terms of a concrete 
agreement we have not yet spoken with the president of Serbia. 
In the discussion with the president I demanded the 
establishment of a publishing house that would collect news on 
the activities of ethnic Hungarians, the establishment of a 
network of ethnic Hungarian elementary and high schools, as well 
as the financing of cultural institutions, to be carried out 
through the association of ethnic Hungarian cultural 
institutions. We also demanded a change of the existing law on 
territorial organization, which would make possible the 
establishment of a county with an ethnic Hungarian majority, 
with an ethnic Hungarian governor. The president said that the 
first three issues might be discussed and an agreement might be 
reached. As for the fourth issue (foundation of a county with 
an ethnic Hungarian majority), the president brought up the 
possibility that the issue might be discussed, but without any 
notion that the proposal might be implemented. We believe it is 
a great step forward, and as far as I know, Vojvodina Hungarians 
have welcomed the results of those talks. We do not expect 
autonomy to be a gift of one party, but rather that the leading 
political forces in the Serbian Assembly understand that it is 
in all our interests, and that the acceptance of that proposal 
will lead us into Europe. 
  [Stamatovic] Many people believe that what you are demanding 
now is a result of your ability to considerably influence the 
voting results by voting for this or that party in the Serbian 
Assembly, which is to say, you can set terms. 
  [Agoston] Now we do not want to implement political force, 
but rather to settle our issues solely through political 
agreements. We do not want any political conditioning, but 
rather a consensus that is in our mutual interests. Our current 
behavior in the Assembly is in the interest of all ethnic 
Hungarians. We do not want to generate conflict with a segment 
of the political forces in Serbia because of our voting. I 
believe it is in the interest of all the citizens of Serbia to 
find a common language, which is to say, that the 
representatives of the great Serbian political parties first 
find it. It should be pointed out that no party has exerted any 
political pressure on us whatsoever.

purchase price for other products, and in the case of services, 
at the rate charged for those services. Prices and rates are 
those in effect at the time of the payments in kind. 
<H5>  Article 3 </H5>
  By derogation from the provisions of the previous article, 
salaries and other salary-related rights or discrepancies from

year are tax deferred over the 12 months of the year, cumulating 
with other compensations of this nature paid by units during the 
respective year, even if their value covers a period greater 
than one year. If the payments cover a period shorter than one 
year, they are tax deferred over the months which they cover. 
These rights are not cumulative for taxation with other income 
from units in which employees serve their basic function. 
<H5>  Article 5 </H5>
  Not included in taxable monthly incomes and not taxed are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Taxable Monthly Income                |Monthly Tax                           |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|4,001 -- 6,800                        |299 + 17% over 4,000                  |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|16,401 -- 27,700                      |2,557 + 20% over 16,400               | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|27,701 -- 38,600                      |4,817 + 21% over 27,700               |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The portion of the total taxable monthly income that exceeds 
300,000 lei is taxed at the rate of 60 percent. 
  When these tax rates reduce the net monthly income of an 
employee at the unit where he serves his basic function to under 
7,600 lei, the tax is reduced so as to ensure this amount of 
income. Income in the form of salaries and other salary-related 
rights received by employees for work performed outside of their 
basic functions and outside the units which hold their work 
cards is taxed separately at each work site at the rate 
stipulated in Para. 1 of this article, with the tax increasing 
by 30 percent. 
  In the case of salaries and other salary-related rights in 
foreign currency, the tax is calculated by an exchange to lei at 
the exchange rate valid on the last day of the month in which 
the payment is made, after which the tax in lei established on 
the basis of the rates in Para. 1 is converted, withheld, and 
deposited in the budget, in foreign currency, at the same 
exchange rate. 
  Together with indexing, as well as for salary compensation 
allowances, the government will appropriately modify the taxable 
monthly income categories stipulated in Para. 1, the amounts 
established by Para. 2 and 3 of the present article, as well as 
the amount indicated in Art. 6, letter (c) of the present law, 
so as not to annul the effect of the indexing or compensation. 
<H5>  Article 8 </H5>
  The income tax is calculated by payers and is withheld 
monthly from the amounts due on the second 15-day period of the 
month. 
  For the monetary rights stipulated by Art. 4 of the present 
law, taxes are calculated and withheld at each payment, by 
cumulating the amounts paid previously during the same month by 
the same payer. 
  If the payer has a bank account, the income tax is withheld 
and disbursed together with the collection of the amounts to be 
paid for the second half of the month. 
  When the amounts for payment of salaries in Rumania or to or 
from abroad are collected, banks must verify the withholding and

  [Text] A novel test system that facilitates fault 
detection in a variety of materials and combinations of 
materials has been developed, built, and tested by Battelle 
Engineering GmbH in Frankfurt. Even molded parts with 
complicated geometries can easily be inspected. 
  Cavities down to a minimum diameter of 3 mm directly below 
the surface and larger faults deeper down can be detected, even 
when there are local differences in foam hardness. 
  The system's capacity for detecting faults in glued joints 
between one metal and another, metal and plastic, plastic and 
wood, other combinations of materials, and honeycomb structures 
has also been put to the test. 
  The system can be used, for example, for monitoring the 
start 
of a new series, optimizing foaming or bonding processes, 
strength testing, random sampling during manufacturing, and 100 
percent monitoring of critical sectors. 
  The range of potential applications is thus wide: The motor 
vehicle and associated industries, the aircraft industry, the 
wood and plastics converting industries, shipbuilding, and many 
other areas can benefit from the new inspection system. 
  It holds out another advantage as well: It needs no 
specialized personnel to operate it, nor does it require the 
products to be pretreated in any particular way prior to 
inspection. There is no need to use coupling [Koppel-] fluids 
and pastes. The basic device incorporates the power supply, the 
excitation and evaluation electronics, and the acoustic fault 
indicator. An optical fault indicator is integrated into the 
test head along with the electromechanical excitation system and 
the sensor. The signal is given on-line when a fault is 
detected.

and Plant Engineering Dept., Battelle Engineering GmbH, Am

  [Text] Ceramic Antifriction Bearings Spreading from 
Exotic Nook 
  Obsolescence of lubricants is inevitable in special 
applications for the Chemical and Food Industries. Professor and 
Doctor of Engineering H. Maier says what we lack is quick pilot 
production. 
  VDI-N, Aachen, 15 Oct 93. They are still lurking as likely 
machine elements with properties yet unknown to many engineers. 
This can change, however, because ceramic bearings are ideal for 
numerous applications where conditions are extreme. They feature 
a high thermal stability and an extremely high corrosion 
resistance, and do not always require lubrication. 
  Owing to the special properties of the material, ceramic 
bearings are bound to be eventually used where heretofore 
conventional antifriction bearings cannot be used as, for 
instance, in chemical reactor vessels. "The demand for ceramic 
bearings will grow," Grad. Eng. Matthias Popp is convinced, 
"wherever not only environmental compatibility, durability, and 
maintenance-friendly operation but also energy consumption and 
availability of the material are the principal considerations." 
As business manager of the Wemhoener &amp; Popp enterprise in 
Herzogenrath near Aachen, which designs and manufactures 
antifriction bearings from purchased ceramic raw material, he is 
since 1989 active in this new and very innovative market. 
  Users are meanwhile still very skeptical about this new 
high-performance material, which has the reputation of crumbling 
upon the slightest touch. What is commonly called brittleness 
Prof. Dr. Horst Maier, director of the Institute of Ceramic 
Components in Machine Construction (IKKM) at the RWTH Aachen, 
calls "limited ductility." 
  The vocabulary used here makes it quite clear that, up to a 
certain limit, the ceramic material can display all its 
advantages while maintaining its extremely high shape stability. 
"This limit is not reached under the specific load for which a 
machine element has been designed", explains Professor Maier and 
he adds: "For many years we have been making the mistake of 
letting only specialists in fracture mechanics deal with ceramic 
materials. They can tell us precisely indeed when something will 
break to pieces, but in modern ceramic technology we are 
concerned about reliability rather than about probability of 
fracture." 
  Professor Maier sees an essential task for the IKKM to be 
seeking new applications for "his" material. For the purpose of 
a still more effective collaboration with the industry, there 
was in 1990 established the Institute of Ceramic Processing and 
Application Engineering (IPAK). Unlike in classical research and 
development, areas of applications in IKKM and in IPAK are not 
subdivided into those pertaining to machine construction or 
processing technology. The director explains the operation of 
his Institute as follows: "We analyze our applications for the 
ceramic material on the basis of its properties so as to 
subsequently identify those utilizing, for instance, its small 
specific gravity or shape stability". As a specific example, 
still in the development stage, he cites the possibility of 
using a ceramic material in a blast furnace, where materials 
must be extremely heat-resistant at temperatures up to 
1300C. Steel stokers, until recently used in these 
furnaces, require cooling. Owing to the high heat, not only the 
water and energy consumption is high but so is also the 
CO[.sup]2[/] emission. These economic and ecologic drawbacks 
can be overcome by use of ceramic stokers which, because of 
their heat resistance, require no cooling and thus eliminate the 
need for a coolant circulation loop and the intensive 
maintenance thereof. 
  Except for a few classical applications, such as those where 
temperatures are high, wear is a significant factor in chemical 
apparatus, or in filters. For potential users, use of this 
ceramic material as a structural one still remains worthwhile in 
discovering unknown territory. "I view myself somewhat as a 
trail blazer intent on setting things in motion", says Professor 
Maier. "We bring the partners to the table for a regularly 
ongoing `target ceramics' research and application forum. We 
carry on educational activity concerning application 
possibilities for the ceramic material, we are laying out the 
theory while also showing practical examples which include 
finished products." 
  Professor Maier assesses the research and production status 
in Germany. "In the area of structural ceramics our chances are 
now very good." In the area of functional ceramics as for 
sensors or chip carriers, he says, "We just have missed the 
boat. Japan is leading here by having better coordinated 
research and manufacture." 
  Actually the manufacturers operate with an overcapacity, 
asserts Professor Maier. "What we lack is quick pilot 
production, considering that flexibility in production of small 
lots is needed for helping the user innovate." In this way it 
would be possible to develop new areas of advancement. These 
include sliding ring seals for pumps and compressors as well as 
unlubricated antifriction bearings for the food industry. 
  The pace at which ceramic bearings are marketed is slow, but 
not so much because of manufacturing engineering problems. 
"Testing was discontinued not because of the intricacy of the 
bearing manufacturing process," Matthias Popp offers a 
background explanation, "but because we were not quite clear 
about the actual market potential." In his opinion, the mistake 
was focusing on replacement of steel bearings instead of seeking 
new applications for the ceramic material. 
  Popp knows not only the advantages and disadvantages of 
ceramic material but also the problems of customers in the 
chemical apparatus, machine construction, and processing 
technology sectors. "The best applications for totally ceramic 
bearings are found foremost in chemical technology and 
biotechnology where they will operate hermetically sealed from 
the environment and run in aggressive media such as acids, lyes, 
or liquid synthetics and thus where use of conventional metal 
bearings is out of question." 
  Ceramic bearings made by Wemhoener &amp; Popp from silicon 
nitride and zirconium oxide as raw materials can withstand 
temperatures up to above 1000C. They also remain 
corrosion-resistant in almost all media and are extremely 
wear-resistant owing to their quite appreciable 80 Rockwell C 
hardness. "Steel bearings require grease or oil lubrication and, 
therefore, cannot be placed in chemical reactor vessels where 
they would contaminate the reaction product." Popp does not 
hesitate to compare them with ceramic bearings which, on the 
contrary, could become lubricated by the processed medium such 
as fruit juice and therefore could enjoy a long life even 
without an added lubricant. He adds that "these ceramic bearings 
also run lighter than conventional antifriction bearings, owing 
to a 40% smaller friction coefficient." With a specific 
weight 
60% lower than that of steel, they are also ideal for 
light-weight structure. Last but not least, a fully ceramic 
bearing is nonmagnetic and dielectric. 
  "Ceramic bearings are today made almost exclusively of hot 
isostatically pressed silicon nitride (HIPSN), because of the 
homogeneous structure of this material," explains the bearings 
expert, "because hardness is very important as far as 
antifriction bearings are concerned." In comparison with 
high-alloy steels such as 100 Cr6, for example, HIPSN is with a 
1,500-1,700 DPH 0.5-kg number more than twice as hard. The 
hardness is retained at temperatures up to 800 and 
decreases only very slowly at still higher temperatures. 
  At the same time, however, making harder materials also 
means 
a more elaborate treatment. For this the Aachen producers of 
antifriction bearings use modern CNC grinding center wheels 
which most often carry diamond bits so as to ensure the 
necessary precision. A sensor touches the treated surface 
continuously throughout the grinding operation, the operation 
then being automatically terminated as soon as the desired 
finish has been attained. The result of this treatment is a 
high-precision product: antifriction bearings with dimensions 
deviating less than 4 m from nominal, the race length 
deviating only 0.2 m maximum, and the race width deviating 
only 1 gmm maximum. 
  Not only in chemical technology can ceramic material be used 
under extreme conditions. This high-tech material is also 
invading everyday life. For example, ceramic antifriction 
bearings in the bicycle hub shown here ensure 
maintenance-friendly light running. Photograph by Wemhoener &amp;

"Companies/Research/Technology": "Composites for Submicron 
Structures. Organic Lipids Can By Themselves Arrange Themselves 
Into Special Structures"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Chemists at the British University in 
Bath under the direction of professors Stephen Mann and Douglas 
D. Archibald have found a fabrication process for 
organic-inorganic microcomposites that allows one very flexibly 
to make quite different structures of materials. The process 
points out new ways to make submicron structures. 
  The process is based on laboratory observations that organic 
lipids that have a hydrophilic sugar group like that of the 
so-called cerebrosides can by themselves arrange themselves into 
special structures. Moreover, lamellar, fibrillar, or tubular 
developed microstructures form via self-arrangement. 
  When suspensions of these structures are brought into 
contact 
with ferric chloride in an acid environment, films of iron 
oxides form that eventually change into magnetite-type crystal 
beds. So, ceramic structures form from an organic matrix with 
metallic oxide particles. 
  Their structure can be compared with that of bone matter, 
which consists mainly of an organic matrix made of the 
cartilage-forming protein collagen and are embedded in the 
inorganic particle made of the mineral calcium phosphate 
hydroxyapatite, and thereby impart to the bone hardness and 
strength together with a certain elasticity. 
  Until now similar microcomposites have been able to be 
produced in small amounts only with zeolites, into whose pores a 
few different organic molecules were embedded. A greater 
multitude of different structures is possible now because of the 
ability to influence the organic components of the 
microcomposites. 
  Although one can not yet predict which end products can be 
synthesized in large quantities even technically in the future, 
synthesis from lipids represents an important advance in the 
direction of the utilization of self-arranging organic 
compounds. However, extensive research work is still required. 
  The University of Bath (Bath BA2 7AY, United Kingdom) 
reports 
that it hopes that a portion of this work can be sped up by 
means of special designer programs that can make, already before 
the actual synthesis and synthesis reactions, quite precise 
theoretical statements concerning the properties that can be 
expected.

  [Text] New Materials: Efficacy of Various 
Smart-Material Midgets 
  Researchers in Saarbruecken are magically making new 
materials with fantastic properties from incredibly small 
particles. Whoever has mastered this technology possesses the 
key to a multitude of product innovations. 
  Some materials coming from the laboratory of the 
Saarbruecken Institute of New Materials (INM) GmbH [GmbH = Ltd] 
seem to be coming from a witch's kitchen of modern alchemists: 
From unimaginably small particles, hardly larger than molecules, 
they make materials which in an almost any desirable way combine 
the heretofore not concurrently attainable properties of glass, 
ceramic, metals, and plastics. Novel automotive varnishes whose 
color can be changed instantaneously by push-button action are 
foreseen by the INM experts, as are finest filters which 
automatically close their pores when they detect the presence of 
certain gases. 
  There is more to such futuristic application concepts than 
the pure joy of experimentation. "In the future new custom made 
materials will play the key role in development of innovative 
products and in solution of confounding problems" predicts Prof. 
Helmut Schmidt, business managing director of the INM. 
  INM researchers are developing synthetic materials and new 
processing techniques so that boundaries between glass, ceramic, 
plastic, and metal become blurred. 
  The new wonder materials satisfy every conceivable 
requirement: to be more resistant, more durable, and more 
elastic than every metal; to automatically indicate invisible 
defects as, for instance, in the outer skin layer of aircraft, 
or to withstand temperatures of up to several thousand degrees 
when used as heat shields. 
  The secret of the Saarbruecken researchers are so-called 
nanoparticles, only a few nanometers large particles. In this 
field the INM (with a staff of 150 persons) has attained the top 
position globally and is pressing like a resourceful David 
against the Japanese superpower in the future-oriented race for 
new materials. 
  INM chief Helmut Schmidt says, "With their wonder materials 
these Saarlanders are opening unthought-of application 
possibilities which promise enormous advantages in the global 
contest." 
  With relatively simple mixtures, the Japanese have already 
in 
the eighties demonstrated how decisive materials are in winning 
the global contest. "With ingenious and inexpensive components 
made of glass", Schmidt cites as an example, "copier equipment 
manufacturers like Canon have dislodged U.S. competitors and 
their costly optics." 
<H5>  Success with Ormocers </H5>
  With tiniest glass globules a few micrometers in diameter 
embedded in the surface of video tapes, the Japanese were able 
to set a new standard and conquer the world market. "At the same 
time", says Schmidt, "about 75% of all high-tech products 
use 
materials especially developed for them." 
  This busy materials expert knows what he is talking about. 
In 
the mid- eighties he was already engaged in developing the 
so-called Ormocers (Organically Modified Ceramics), to create a 
sensation: inorganic ceramics and organic plastics being grown 
together -- a long technological step forward in materials 
research. Two heretofore not concurrently attainable properties, 
hardness of ceramics and high ultimate strength of plastics, are 
here realized in one material. 
  During the 1986-90 period Schmidt was, as director of the 
Fraunhofer Institute for Silicates Research in Wuerzburg, 
successfully engaged in industrial application of Ormocers. An 
example is the mixture specially developed by the Wuerzburg team 
and used by the Rupp &amp; Hubrach KG [Kommanditgesellschaft = 
Limited Partnership] in Bamberg as an exceptionally 
scratch-resistant material for coating eyeglasses. With only 
12.6 kg of this material, the French have reached a sales figure 
of 15 million DM in 1992 alone. Another Schmidt-Ormocer is used 
by the Biberacher Basotherm GmbH as an extremely effective 
additive in a novel skin creme against acne. 
  No wonder that in 1990 this busy materials expert and 
research manager readily accepted the offer to become chairman 
of the INM, which had been established in 1987. "Here we can in 
a downright ideal way combine industry- related projects with 
government-financed basic research". He can enumerate about 100 
joint projects with companies like Daimler-Benz, Bayerische 
Motor Werke (BMW), or Schering. Some of these projects pertain 
to extension and further development of the Ormocer technology 
along with its underlying sol-gel manufacturing process. 
  Still more momentous for the future appears to be 
nanotechnology invented by the INM basics researcher Prof. 
Herbert Gleiter. There is an unpredictable number of possible 
applications for this technology in areas ranging from metals 
and plastics processing to optoelectronics and bioengineering. 
<H5>  Multicolor Mixture </H5>
  What is being researched at the Institute of New Materials? 
Color emulsions for the nanotechnology: starting material for 
ultrafine powders of particles a few nanometers in diameter. 
<H5>  NANOCOMPOSITE MATERIALS </H5>

  Smart Materials: Intelligent materials whose properties will 
change for a purpose in response to light, electric signals, or 
mechanical action are nanotechnological materials. With these 
materials one can build active components which do not require 
external sensors and control elements. 
  Environment-Protecting Materials: Custom made materials 
which 
absorb toxic gases or harmful liquids such as, for example, 
gasoline sludge. 
  Bioengineering Materials: Nanocomposite materials can be 
adjusted more precisely than conventional materials to given 
biological conditions (e.g., for more compatible implants). 
  Materials for Integrated Optics: With nanocomposite 
materials 
one can produce special effects required of optical switches in 
communications, engineering, and future computer engineering. 
Passage of incident light rays through a transparent material of 
this kind can be either permitted or barred by appropriate 
optical signals. 
  Graded Materials: Controlled growth of the material 
structure 
makes it possible to impart special properties to thin 
(micrometers thick) layers. 
  Coatings For Metals and Plastics: Nanotechnology facilitates 
improvement of surface properties of addition of new ones. 
<H5>  GLASS </H5>
  Glass Composites: The sol-gel process makes it possible to 
produce coatings which will confer a variety of properties on a 
surface. The principal aim is to convert the glass surface into 
an intelligent system to be used in vehicle construction, 
architecture, and display techniques, etc. 
  Sintered Glasses: The processes which precede sintering 
(baking a mixture by heating) in glass manufacture by the powder 
technology are being further developed. Not only synthesis of 
novel functional coatings for glass surfaces but also joining 
glasses homogeneously at temperatures below the softening point 
without use of adhesive becomes feasible. 
<H5>  CERAMICS </H5>
  Synthesis of Nanopowders: The goal is to eventually produce 
diverse nanoparticles of almost any desirable composition and 
size. 
  Processing Technology for Nanopowders: Techniques of 
processing extremely fine raw materials already adjusted for 
practical use by industry indicate new ways of making ceramic 
materials. 
  Ceramics Processing Technology: Further development of the 
nanotechnology is aimed at a lower cost of making completely 
nondefective homogeneous raw ceramic materials (greenware) and 
at lower the sintering temperatures. 
  Says INM researcher Reiner Kasemann, "The new forms of 
material synthesis will trigger a revolution similar to that 
triggered by microelectronics." 
  With tiniest particles, only a few dozens of times larger 
than a molecule, it is possible to properly program the 
properties of a material. This is so because the synthetic 
midgets, visible only under a transmission electron microscope, 
exhibit entirely new properties when assembled en masse. 
Granules smaller than 15 nm in diameter thus become properly 
transparent. A nanocomposite material made by mixing such 
plastic and ceramic particles in an intricate chemical process 
becomes astonishingly a transparent material. 
  This leads to application possibilities one can dream of. 
Electrochromic and photochromic nanocomposites are thus being 
developed by the INM whose color or optical transmittance can be 
changed by application of voltage pulses or exposure to sunlight 
respectively. Window glass coated with such a material could be 
darkened instantaneously by push-button action. 
  In automobile manufacture, too, there are good opportunities 
for smart nanomaterials. The color of rear and side windows, for 
instance, can in the future be arbitrarily varied by an electric 
signal coming from a dashboard switch. The benefit this feature 
offers is that it prevents excessive heating of the interior by 
intense solar radiation. 
<H5>  Marketable Nanomixtures </H5>
  In addition, Schmidt is now developing smart fluids for new 
shock absorbers which will, within fractions of a second, adjust 
their stiffness to the road condition. The mechanism of this 
curious change rests on the damper fluid becoming as stiff as 
legs exactly when an electrically controlled sensor indicates 
very deep pot holes. On this basis, much more comfortable and 
also simpler spring systems could eventually be built. 
  Nanomixtures of plastic and ceramic material are harder and 
have a higher load capacity than every metal, which makes them 
eminently suitable for coatings. Their first marketable 
applications have already been developed: 
  1. For extra highly resistant aluminum surfaces. 
Conventional 
coating with epoxy resins provides merely inadequate long-term 
protection and, moreover, requires surface cleaning and pickling 
treatments during which chloroferous sludge is being discharged. 
Much more scratch and wear resistant nanocoatings can, on the 
contrary, be deposited without polluting prior surface treatment. 
  2. Nanocomposite materials are also eminently suitable for 
dirt-repellant coatings. The INM material which consists of 
special ingredients containing aluminum, silicon, and fluorine 
respectively is much more durable than the conventional plastic 
coating material and, in addition, prevents detrimental dirt 
deposition. 
  3. The INOPEX GmbH in Saarbruck will eventually produce 
bathroom mirrors with a nanocoating designed to prevent water 
vapor deposition and to last much longer than comparable 
products. 
  For ceramic materials nanotechnology offers downright 
fantastic possibilities. The shortcoming of these 
extraordinarily wear-resistant and high-temperature 
heat-resistant materials has until now been their attendant 
fragility, owing to irregularities of the original powder mass. 
With the aid of the nanoparticle technique, the INM researchers 
were able to effectively avoid dreaded formation of defects in a 
very promising all-around material by making it from grains 
thousand times finer than before. 
  In addition to that, the Saarbrueck researchers want to 
produce by a novel processing technique the heretofore awfully 
expensive nanopowder (now costing a few thousand DM/kg) for a 
price of 50-150 DM/kg. They were the first ones able to mix 
perfectly uniform ceramic particles only 15 nm in diameter so as 
to space them closely but allow them to move freely. Until now 
nanotechnologists unfortunately tended to produce particles on 
the premise that making them smaller made its easier for them to 
"stick" to one another, but this led to formation of worthless 
lumps. 
  The INM researchers have tamed these obstinate midgets, a 
billion of which would fit in a pinhead, by coating them with an 
ultrathin molecular monolayer sheath. This sheath ensures that 
they remain spaced exactly 0.4 nm apart. 
  This superior processing technique makes many heralded 
applications for a heretofore notoriously fragile material 
realizable. A nanoceramic material may to a large extent replace 
steel or aluminum in automobiles. While it is so elastic as to 
be suitable for spring components, its wear resistance and 
high-temperature heat resistance are also so exceptional that 
costly water cooling could be dispensed with. 
<H5>  Meager Assistance </H5>
  Despite all the successes and magnificent prospects, Schmidt 
remains altogether skeptical about German materials research. 
"Materials require an especially long lead time, ten years or 
more being necessary for innovation. In Germany as a rule", the 
INM chief complains, "no projects lasting longer then three 
years are being subsidized." 
  Not so in Japan: The chief guardians of technology at the 
Ministry of Industry MITI are pumping 10 billion dollars into 
materials research over the 1989-98 period alone. For 
comparison: According to the materials expert Michael Witzel at 
the Arthur Little business consulting firm, the Federal Ministry 
of Research and Technology subsidized altogether 577 projects 
with only 894 million DM from 1985 till the beginning of 1992 
and in the future it will provide rather less. 
  There is an additional disadvantage which the German 
industry 
faces in dealing with competition from the Far East: "The 
research structures in Japan are," says INM chief Schmidt, "much 
more efficacious. In Germany we have many specialists, to be 
sure, but nobody who would lead them as would an orchestra 
conductor toward coordinated team effort. In Japan this role is 
taken over by MITI."

  [Text] Superlight Primadonna 
  Metallic materials of the future are expected to be as hard 
as steel but substantially lighter. A magnesium-lithium 
superlight alloy developed at the Hannover University is half as 
heavy as aluminum. 
  The alloy consists of 60% atom. Mg and 40% 
atom. Li. Its 
density is only 1.3 g/cm[.sup]3[/], making it weigh six times 
less than steel and half as much as aluminum. The credentials of 
this new material from Hannover demonstrate that the scientists 
of the Hannover research team have, with their novel binary 
alloying technique, come a whole lot closer to realizing the 
dream of superlight materials. 
  Researchers have for decades been fascinated by the 
challenge 
to produce superlight materials with a lower than 1.5 
g/cm[.sup]3[/] density by alloying with the lightest metallic 
element, which is lithium. Magnesium alloys are an interesting 
possibility as such a partnership, their density being 40% 
lower than that of aluminum-based materials. 
  Such binary materials have encouraging properties: not only 
a 
much lower density than that of conventional magnesium alloys 
but also a better formability. Their advantages are, however, 
unfortunately attended by serious drawbacks: very low mechanical 
strength and very low corrosion resistance. 
  "Alongside the basic concept of an integrated material 
development is also considered the industrial aspect of 
subsequent material production, i.e., evaluation of industrially 
feasible alloy making processes and testing techniques", so does 
Prof. Dr.-Eng. Heinz Haferkampf describe the scope of work done 
by the Hannover research team as sponsored by the DFG (Deutsche 
Forschungsgemeinschaft = German Research Association). Powder 
metallurgy and nondestructive testing methods are accordingly 
being refined for adaptation to the specific properties of that 
new group of alloys. 
  Unfortunately, the new material behaves like a moody 
primadonna. It poses serious problems in the magnesium and 
lithium mixing stage, inasmuch as both metals are chemically 
very active even in a normal atmosphere. A protective gas such 
as argon shielding the material from air must, therefore, be 
provided throughout the alloy making process. 
  Magnesium with its hexagonal basic crystal lattice is, 
moreover, by nature brittle. Increasing the lithium content 
influences the crystal structure in a way which improves its 
formability. Because of the high lithium diffusion rate, on the 
other hand, segregation takes place and the material becomes 
nonhomogeneous. 
  Even after successful casting there still remain unrelenting 
difficulties. Unlike aluminum-based materials, which form a 
continuous oxide surface film protecting them against further 
corrosion, magnesium-lithium alloys form steadily growing chappy 
chemically active layers. A high lithium content in the alloy 
and humid environment accelerate the loss of material. 
  Material researchers limit the mobility of lithium by adding 
elements which appropriately inhibit the diffusion of lithium, 
for instance by binding lithium into compounds. Addition of 
hydrogen to the melt has proved to be very promising. 
  A material with much better properties is, however, obtained 
by adding slight amounts of aluminum and zinc. This will 
unfortunately result in accelerated coarsening of the structure 
during heating and thus will not ensure the mandatory long-term 
stability required of engineering materials. 
  Experimentation with additives such as silicon, cadmium, and 
zirconium seems to have revealed a way out of this dilemma. 
"Already slight amounts of silicon make the material more 
corrosion-resistant and thus reduce the loss of material to half 
the loss of conventional structural steel due to corrosion" 
Professor Haferkampf states joyfully. "For goal-oriented 
modifications of the alloy composition there are available 
metallurgical techniques which will ensure a low contamination 
level during treatment of highly chemical reaction prone alloy 
melts and thus ensure reproducibility of alloy making and 
treatment procedures." 
  The alloy making process involves homogenization of the melt 
by stirring and its subsequent casting into steel molds. 
Attendant conversion and heat treatment are designed to improve 
the mechanical properties and to increase the corrosion 
resistance. 
  A homogeneous melt can then be "frozen in" by rapid cooling. 
Material combinations can thus be obtained which are not 
obtainable by conventional casting methods. The melt is 
subsequently atomized into small droplets by injection of a 
high-energy gas jet. The finished material is a fine metal 
powder consisting of globular particles. The diameter of 
globules produced in a fully automatic spray-nozzle apparatus 
ranges from 0.02 mm to 0.25 mm, depending on the process 
conditions. This powder is then, by heat and pressure, converted 
into a compact material. 
  Use of superlight cast Mg-Li alloys has been first 
demonstrated on a 10 mm thick and 300 mm in diameter light 
lamination (weighing only 0.7 kg) of a rotary neutron selector. 
It withstood speeds higher than the minimum required 20,000 rpm. 
Such rotors make it possible to select specific radiation 
propagation velocities for analysis of magnetic materials, 
electronic components, and plastics. Professor Haferkampf is 
satisfied: "Excellent machinability and high neutron absorption 
capacity, among lithium's relevant properties, enable this new 
kind of alloy to reach a very promising application potential in 
competition with fiber-reinforced plastic materials currently in 
use."

<F P=106> [Article by re: "Corrosion Research Can Help Avoid Billions </F>
in Damage"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Each year corrosion causes losses 
amounting to about 100 billion German marks [DM] in Germany. But 
a large part of the damage could be avoided if the existing 
knowledge were correctly used. Dechema Deutsche Gesellschaft 
fuer Chemisches Apparatewesen, Chemische Technik und 
Biotechnologie eV, Frankfurt, is drawing attention to this on 
the occasion of the Corrosion and Corrosion Protection Research 
and Development Program (FEKKs), which is now being held in 
Leipzig (22 to 25 November) concurrently with the Innomata '93 
international exhibition meeting for materials technology and 
materials applications. 
  A 20 to 30 percent share of the corrosion damage cannot be 
avoided, however, because it is the result of our technical 
development. Primarily the use of new or further developed 
materials and the use of known materials for new applications 
always leads to unexpected corrosion damage from previously 
unknown corrosion mechanisms. 
  The research program on corrosion protection, which has been 
under way for 20 years, with more than 500 individual projects, 
is estimated by experts to have contributed benefits worth 
billions. It is also said to be the basis for solving future 
tasks. Through the intensive coordination and cooperation 
between materials producers and users and research institutes, 
the knowledge about corrosion processes and corrosion protection 
has grown tremendously and has today been included in the 
standards. 
  As Dechema further reports, there are also examples of 
direct 
conversion of the know-how. Thus, a patent for the production of 
aluminum-rich surface layers on steels is being used by a small 
enterprise to protect flaps and shafts which are under extreme 
thermal stress in engine control systems. 
  In the last few year corrosion experts have devoted 
themselves in detail to the problems of construction with 
concrete. It has been possible to develop an electrochemical 
method for localizing places in the concrete where the 
reinforcing steel corrodes. It was further possible to 
demonstrate that it is electrochemically possible to realkalize 
concrete while simultaneously extracting the 
corrosion-triggering chloride. With this process the original 
protective effect of the concrete can be restored. The 
experience and success of the now concluding program have, in 
Dechema's opinion, shown how important long-term, continuous 
support in the field of corrosion research is. The emergence of 
new technologies continuously makes new demands on corrosion 
protection, it was further said. For example, completely new 
concepts and methods of study are necessary for microtechnology, 
because corrosion rates on the order of microns a year are not 
tolerable, while in classic equipment engineering materials with 
such rates are classed as "stable." 
  The importance of microbiologically induced corrosion as a 
cause of damage has only really been recognized in the last few 
years. In this field as well, interdisciplinary cooperation 
between microbiologists and materials and corrosion experts and 
other disciplines must be strengthened in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by JB: "Hot Gas Filter Increases Effect"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt--The Center for Heterogeneous Analysis, 
reg. assn. (Rudower Chaussee 5, 12489 Berlin) has developed a 
hot gas filter to be used for desulfurization of coal gas. The 
filter can be used in future combination power plants. It 
consists of a ceramic filter coated with zinc oxide on a 
foundation of polyurethane sponges. 
  In order to produce the filter, the synthetic sponges are 
soaked in a clay suspension and fired at temperatures of up to 
1,200 degrees Celsius. In so doing the synthetic burns up 
completely and leaves behind a ceramic matrix with a structure 
similar to the sponge. The ceramic is then dipped in a 
zinc-oxide-clay suspension and again fired. 
  In this way an active zinc-oxide coating is formed, which is 
responsible for the desulfurization process. The thickness of 
the layer is between 40 and 400 microns. The hydrogen sulfide in 
the coal gas reacts with the zinc oxide to form zinc sulfide and 
water. 
  The filter can be used with a gas temperature of up to 1,000 
degrees Celsius. At higher temperatures the pore structure is 
destroyed. The thicker the zinc-oxide coating of the filter and 
the pressure of the coal gas, the greater is also the conversion 
rate of the hydrogen sulfide. During the conversion process, the 
pore volume of the filter decreases. 
  In so doing, carbon deposits and small zinc sulfide balls 
form in the filter matrix. After it has done its job, the filter 
can be regenerated by adding air. In the exothermal regeneration 
reactions the deposited carbon is burned and the zinc sulfide 
converted to zinc sulfate. The latter again decomposes at higher 
temperatures into zinc oxide and sulfur trioxide. 
  During the regeneration, the temperatures in the filter 
increase more the more carbon and zinc sulfide it contains. 
Since during this process it is possible to reach local 
temperatures of more than 1,000 degrees Celsius, the filter 
should be monitored and regenerated gently. It works best at a 
desulfurization temperature of 560 degrees Celsius and a 
pressure of between one and 19 bar. 
  Conventional gas purification in a wet-chemical process 
normally takes place at temperatures up to 175 degrees Celsius. 
But the higher the temperature of the coal gas can be for the 
cleaning, the greater is the overall effect of the combined 
power plant. Hot gas purification at temperatures above 300 
degrees generally results in an increase in efficiency of up to 
four percent.

Process Engineering and Chemical Research Projects With 
Fullerenes; Hopes for a Future Market, but Up to Now Still No

Research Laboratories"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--According to Utz-Hellmuth Felcht, a 
member of the board of directors of Hoechst, Inc., who is in 
charge of research, economic successes, or even breaking even on 
costs, is not the goal of the company's current activities in 
this field of research. But now, in a generally poor economic 
situation, the chemical company is making an effort to learn to 
understand a very promising, potential material of the future in 
terms of its reactions and to keep in mind applications of it 
that will prove interesting for the company in the long run. 
  The company at present produces worldwide fullerene C-60 and 
C-70 in lots of several kilograms for many universities and 
industrial research laboratories. In so doing, the process that 
Wolfgang Kraetschmer and Donald R. Huffman developed in 1990, 
with graphite electrodes in an arc light, is used. 
  The company generally asks for a "cost contribution" for 
very 
pure fullerene (99.4 percent pure) of $135 per gram; the 
contribution for larger quantities is negotiated or they are 
given away if a financially badly off university laboratory 
decides to collaborate with the company. The current production 
of fullerenes is certainly not yet a cost-effective business. In 
this way, Hoechst wants to ensure the later commercial 
evaluation of the possibly useful results of its research. 
Twenty university teams are at present collaborating with 
Hoechst in Germany, as the company recently let us know. 
  Comparable collaboration between universities and industry 
is 
rare in this country. But chemists do not find it so difficult, 
since they themselves are scarcely in a position to make use of 
their inventions and discoveries under their own control. The 
chemical company had no difficulty in incorporating test lot 
production into its Knappsack plant as early as in 1992 with a 
converted plasma unit. Since then, it has developed an improved 
separation process that should be ready for patenting, the 
capacity of which in continuous operation is close to the limit 
of the currently required amounts of fullerene. 
  Fullerenes are completely new materials with properties that 
neither graphite nor diamonds, as pure modifications of carbon, 
exhibit. Moreover, the ball-shaped fullerene molecules are 
extremely stable from the kinetic point of view, but then again 
very unstable in thermodynamic terms. And because of their 
thermodynamic behavior, they can be readily transformed into new 
kinds of compounds. 
  As explained by Swiss Prof. Francois Diederich of the Swiss 
Technical College in Zurich, because of their hollow, 
ball-shaped structure, fullerenes can be modified in four 
different ways, all of which they have already been able to 
verify with experiments. In the process, the inclusion of 
molecules in the cavity itself did not prove to be very 
effective since they are hardly ever released again. 
  The cage-like structure on the existing double bonds of the 
carbon atoms can be forced open and then many other molecules 
can be incorporated into and added onto it. Individual carbon 
atoms can also be successfully replaced with other atoms, boron, 
for example. As a fourth possibility, new atoms can be packed in 
between the cavities of the fullerene balls, which are only a 
few nanometers in size, and new kinds of crystalline compounds 
obtained. Scientists are today already speaking of a "fullerene 
chemistry," with which dozens of possible applications are 
heralded in at least the fields of electronics, chemistry 
itself, and new materials. 
  Because of their physical properties, chemically altered 
fullerenes can lead to new kinds of semiconductors in molecular 
or nanoelectronics. Because of their electrical and nonlinear 
optical properties, photoconductors and utilization of their 
optical-electrical behavior are conceivable. Fullerenes are 
genuine electron conductors that, unlike other organic 
molecules, transmit charges via defective electrons, so-called 
electron holes. That is why they are regarded as electrolyte and 
electrode materials for lightweight accumulators and batteries. 
Light activates fullerenes and the electron conduction leads to 
a useful electroluminescence. They are also studying their 
superconducting properties. But the results of this research are 
not yet far enough advanced to arouse hopes for a new class of 
high-temperature superconductors. 
  In the field of chemisty fullerenes can be readily altered 
to 
become catalysts. Because of their molecular size, which is 
equivalent to that of anthracene molecules and is in the 
nanometer range, luminous new colors for printing or 
photocopying technology are especially conceivable. 
  Up to now several pharmacological effects of fullerenes have 
been noted. With attached active groups, they can also be used 
for new medicines on the molecular biological scale or only as 
carrier molecules for radio isotopes or other active substances. 
  Encapsulated, in the form of so-called nanocapsules, they 
appear to be less well-suited to this because their molecular 
structure is probably too stable, which is why the encapsulated 
active substances are hardly released again. But precisely 
because of this, they are well-suited to the production of new 
kinds of contrast agents for X-ray diagnosis or tomographic 
display procedures. Antiviral and antibacterial action, which 
can, morever, be controlled by light induction, opens up new 
ways of creating antibiotics. Fullerenes or their crystal 
compounds, fullerides, with metals or other elements, will 
probably not appear on the market so quickly as new kinds of 
active substances since they would have to be produced cheaply 
in large quantities for that purpose. And that has not yet 
become apparent for the moment. 
  Some of the application possibilities fall within Hoechst's 
own production categories and will possibly open up new fields 
of operation for the company, in pharmaceuticals or antibiotics. 
Hoechst, which with sales volumes of more than DM8 million 
(first half of 1993: DM4.523 million) occupies a leading 
position in the world market for pharmaceuticals, is on the 
lookout for new pharmacological substances. 
  To be sure, Hoechst today already supplies high-temperature 
superconductors for research and industry but, if it is 
demonstrated that fullerenes can be produced more cheaply and 
can retain their superconducting state under the influence of 
magnetic fields as well--as scientists think they will on the 
basis of the initial experiments--market opportunities clearly 
exist in this field. 
  Because of the wealth of possible applications, it is still 
too early to determine which fullerene compounds they will 
actually be able to market as well in 10 or more years time. But 
the company does have good prospects of becoming a leading 
supplier.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Bister: "Matra Marconi Space -- </F>
Engineering Revisited"] 
  [Text] In June 1990, Matra Marconi Space's Engineering 
Division embarked on a concurrent engineering project -- a 
challenge encompassing technical, information technology, and 
human factors. 
  Designing a satellite means integrating the know-how from 
many disciplines: Computer-aided design [CAD]; mechanical, 
thermal, acoustic, and electrical engineering; electronics; 
impact propagation; propulsion; space and flight environments; 
payload.... All specialists from these disciplines must work as 
one if the satellite is to be successfully developed and 
launched. Until recently, however, such specialists have tended 
to act sequentially rather than concurrently: "The design 
department and the engineering department have always worked 
quite independently from each other," explains project manager 
J.C. Amieux. Potential configurations are developed by the 
design department, while the engineering services study their 
compatibility, first with the launcher, then with the space 
environment. 
  Development of the satellite then proceeds with the project 
being shuttled back and forth between the design department, 
which designs systems, and the engineering department, which 
throws light on a number of design weaknesses; the design 
department makes corrections, the engineering department runs 
its computational codes once more, and so it goes until the 
configuration meets the mission's requirements. Thus the 
problem is both simple and complex: While such an iterative 
process is obviously very time-consuming, unifying the two 
worlds of CAD and engineering is a real challenge with respect 
to technical, information-technology, and human aspects. 
<H5>  Technological Challenge </H5>
  First of all, for the various participants to act 
concurrently, they must speak the same language. However, the 
design department and the scientific disciplines in charge of 
the various calculations do not share the same representation of 
reality: CAD specialists work on complete models very similar 
to the real thing, while engineers use idealized structures. 
  J.C. Amieux: "In fact, this is a problem of 
multirepresentation. There are two ways around it. We can 
either start with the CAD model and simplify and abstract it in 
order to build an x-number of models corresponding to an 
x-number of scientific disciplines. Or we can begin with simple 
structures used in engineering, and then flesh out the model: 
Why construct a complex CAD model when the various groups have 
not come up with a final configuration yet?" 
  While the second solution may appear preferable, it creates 
another problem: All projects soon need to be expressed through 
an artist's view, a realistic rendering whose purpose is the 
management of interfaces between satellite and launcher, between 
boxes and support plates, between antennas and payload 
plates.... Not to mention interfaces with the outside world: 
between Matra Marconi Space [MMS] and its customers, between 
MMS and its subcontractors.... It must also be possible to 
consult with the latter at any time during the project. 
However, the multirepresentation problem is not as critical as 
in other fields: No-one would dream of developing a consumer 
product without knowing very early on what it will look like. 
So there is no single solution: "No matter which way is 
chosen, each discipline is going to stick to its own model...and 
our task will be to manage those models, and to make sure they 
can actually communicate," J.C. Amieux explains. 
<H5>  Information Technology Challenge </H5>
  MMS's first goal was to consolidate the computer environment 
so that all models could communicate. "Rewriting all programs, 
thousands of lines of code, would be neither realistic nor 
useful," says J.C. Amieux. "We had to come up with other 
solutions: direct connection with data structures or the use of 
communication standards." The first approach is only 
conceivable if there is access to the data structure, which is 
easier said than done.... Furthermore, this does not necessarily 
solve problems arising as part of relations with the various 
partners: One can hardly compel them to use a given software 
package.... 
  The alternate route is that of data exchange standards. 
While 
it may appear an easier one, it has its own set of problems. 
Some highly specialized fields have almost no standards. As for 
those standards that do exist, they are not always "standard": 
Some designers use their own substandards...which make 
transferring data from one software package to another highly 
perilous! Unless, again, one is in touch with the designers of 
the software. The ideal solution would be an opening and a 
standardization of packages as wide as possible: "Exchange 
standards are sheer hell...but since we are not locked in one 
place, anything goes," says Matra Datavision Marketing and 
Communications Director Jean-Yves Guinemer, who also supplies 
MMS with packages such as Euclid. 
  For the time being, since there is no simple solution, MMS 
has chosen one that is a compromise. Close links with Matra 
Datavision have led to an interconnection of the tools used by 
the design department and the engineering department, the tools 
having been made compatible with the ESABASE European satellite 
modeling language. The result is Systema, a computerized system 
which consists in a number of integrated and interconnected 
tools and makes it possible for specialists belonging to 
different disciplines to talk to one another. "However, this is 
not a centralized system which a single operator could use to 
`design' a satellite: All we did was to interconnect the 
various departments in order to let them work together on the 
same project," explains J.C. Amieux. This tool drastically 
reduces a satellite's design time: Over a 10-year period, MMS 
has cut this time by half, with spacecraft becoming increasingly 
complex. "What remains to be done now is to interconnect the 
three integrated sets we have created: the tools the satellite 
will use to respond to its environment, structure-oriented 
computational tools, and CAD tools," says J.C. Amieux. 
  This is one of the subsequent phases on the road to 
concurrent engineering: integration, from the design stage, of 
all elements of a satellite's lifecycle. 
<H5>  Human Challenge </H5>
  So concurrent engineering is based on methodology and tools. 
But there is more: "In this concurrent engineering project, we 
started with the tools -- if there are no tools, people do not 
begin to change their methodology. But because they have the 
tools does not guarantee they will change methodologies!" Thus, 
as always, convincing people to change their ways takes a lot of 
work. MMS has a powerful argument, however: "A critical review 
of the way people work never fails to show that they 
increasingly refuse repetitive and costly work. Transcribing a 
model from one standard into another is hardly productive...," 
explains J.C. Amieux. However, one basic principle must be kept 
in mind: "All this work must not be visible to the end-user, 
who must only think: I could not do this before, and now it is 
both possible and more efficient...." Let us take a project 
group as an example: Experts of the various disciplines used to 
meet in the flesh, with all their paraphernalia of pens and 
papers. Now, they can work together via the large screen of a 
workstation: They will have access to the project's history and 
to all calculations already performed; they will be able to make 
changes and see very quickly their impact on the various 
disciplines.... 
  In other words, it is possible to work concurrently and in 
parallel on several disciplines. Moreover, much better use of 
the results of other projects can be expected: 
Cross-fertilization, which currently takes place only within 
the various departments, should now be possible at the upper 
level also. "A wholly new concept of engineering is emerging. 
This was made possible by, among other things, networking and 
ever-cheaper and more powerful workstations. This new approach 
is essential if productivity, quality, and prices are to be 
improved. Especially in an industry which is characterized by 
fierce international competition," Jean- Claude Amieux concludes. 
<H5>  Engineering Workshop </H5>
  The concept of "framework" -- single development environment 
or engineering workshop -- is a difficult one. "This is an 
information technology notion, an essential one for the 
development of concurrent engineering. However, there is 
currently no consensus as to what a single development 
environment really is," says J.C. Amieux. Conventional CAD/CAM 
software packages generally offer a single work environment, 
albeit...a proprietary one: Developing a special module entails 
calling on the package's developers. The problem? Engineers 
want to make such tools their own.... "We developed our concept 
around Matra Datavision's Euclid software, among others. But we 
now realize that this was not the best approach to total 
integration. So we talked with Matra Datavision and this led to 
a completely reversed proposition: the Cascade software package. 
  This product is an answer to single development environment 
concerns: It is a software system, a tool kit through which 
engineers will be able to access all the tools required in a 
concurrent engineering environment," J.C. Amieux says. In fact, 
the conditions have been entirely reversed: It is no longer a 
software package that is being supplied, but the tools necessary 
to put together the appropriate system. "Cascade also 
represents a substantial technological leap. It cannot be 
implemented all at once; therefore, we are going to integrate 
Cascade into the existing tool, little by little," J.C. Amieux 
explains. 
<H5>  MMS in Toulouse </H5>
  Matra Marconi Space (MMS) was born of the 1990 merger 
between 
Matra's Space Division and British conglomerate GEC Marconi. As 
a result of the merger, MMS became Europe's first space-oriented 
integrated company. MMS' Toulouse center specializes in 
satellite engineering and integration: In addition to the 
actual platforms, its engineers design everything upstream and 
downstream, including instruments, on-board systems, control 
centers, and ground facilities. This expertise is put to use in 
several space-related domains. First, Earth observation 
satellites: Meteosat 1 through 6, SPOT-1 through -4, 
Helios...up to and including the future polar platform Columbus. 
These are instrument-carrying satellites. The basic module is 
reusable; only the on-board instruments are changed: from two 
cameras for SPOT-1, to six or even 20 on the future Columbus 
platform. 
  Here, the central idea is to design and build elements that 
can be used in various configurations. Concurrent engineering 
should make this much simpler. 
  Second, telecommunications satellites. While Earth 
observation satellites follow a quasi-polar heliosynchronous 
orbit at an altitude of 800 kilometers, telecommunications 
satellites are on a geostationary orbit at 36,000 kilometers. 
Hence, very different environments and therefore specific 
technologies and system constraints. 
  The third field of activity, scientific satellites, is a 
highly specialized business; however, costs remain moderate: 
"These are one-of-a-kind platforms," says Jean-Claude Amieux. 
For instance, Hyparcos, the "star surveyor," beams back results 
with an accuracy of 2 milliseconds of arc. 
  Then there are strategic satellites, a field where 
circumspection is of the essence. However, as with scientific 
satellites, this is a field where second-best is not an 
acceptable proposition. 
  The last domain relates to manned spacecraft, with one 
specialty: on-board data processing. While MMS has been a 
participant in such projects from the very beginning, the 
current sundry vacillations on the subject do nothing to comfort 
the company's belief in the future of these activities.

<F P=106> [Article by Francois Falempin of the "Hypersonic Vehicles" </F>
Unit, chief of the PREPHA program of the National Office for 
Aerospace Studies and Research (ONERA): "Toward a Super-Ramjet: 
Cooperation With the Moscow Central Institute of Aircraft 
Engines"] 
  [Text] Since the spring of 1992, the ONERA [National Office 
for Aerospace Studies and Research] and its industrial partners 
Aerospatiale, Dassault Aviation, SEP [European Propulsion 
Company], and SNECMA [National Company for the Study and 
Construction of Aircraft Engines] have been involved in a series 
of cooperation activities with several research and study 
centers in the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] on the 
subject of the super-ramjet and associated technologies. This 
strategy is part of the wider national PREPHA (Research and 
Technology Program for Advanced Hypersonic Propulsion) program. 
  This means that close relations are being maintained with 
such prestigious institutes as the MAI [Moscow Aviation 
Institute] or the institutes of the Siberian branch of the 
Novosibirsk Academy of Sciences (Institute of Theoretical and 
Applied Mechanics, Thermophysics Institute, and others). In 
this context and with the support of the DRET [Research, 
Studies, and Technologies Directorate of the Ministry of 
Defense], the ONERA has been able to develop a particularly 
fruitful cooperation with the CIAM [Central Institute of 
Aircraft Engines Moscow], whose activities are located on two 
sites: In Moscow, where most of the theoretical and laboratory 
work is done, and in Turayevo (50 kms from Moscow), where the 
institute has an impressive complex of industrial testing 
facilities. 
  Under the leadership of its present director Donat 
Ogorodnikov, the CIAM, which is specializing in the study and 
development of aeronautical engines, devotes a substantial 
amount of its activity to the study of the super-ramjet, and in 
particular the hydrogen-powered scramjet. Existing cooperation 
focuses on two main areas: 
  -- the development of computation codes in aerothermics and 
in aerothermochemistry; 
  -- the in-flight experimentation of an axisymmetrical 
scramjet. 
<H5>  High-Performance Digital Diagrams </H5>
  Concerning the development of computation codes, the CIAM is 
suggesting digital diagrams derived from that of Godunov and 
which are particularly economical in terms of computation time. 
Areas of joint activity include a comparative evaluation, based 
on the computation of a series of test cases, of the CIAM 
diagrams and those used at the ONERA. When this evaluation is 
finished, Russian specialists will come to France to help their 
French colleagues embed CIAM digital diagrams in some of their 
codes, notably those dealing with supersonic aerothermochemistry. 
  Other than the initial work of selecting and embedding the 
most appropriate digital diagrams, ongoing research will be 
continued within the scope of the PREPHA program aimed at 
defining and validating the models which best represent the 
physical phenomena governing aerothermics and 
aerothermochemistry of the scramjet. The CIAM and certain 
Novosibirsk-based institutes will be able to contribute their 
experiences and their databases in this field, but ways of 
cooperation on this issue remain to be decided. 
  Although the development of computation codes is a very 
promising area of cooperation in the medium and long term, 
in-flight testing of a scramjet is, in the short time, the most 
beneficial. 
<H5>  First Test Inconclusive </H5>
  In November 1991, the CIAM conducted an initial in-flight 
test of a hydrogen axisymmetrical scramjet. A stabilized 
supersonic combustion phase could not be reached during this 
test because the carrier rocket's trajectory control was 
insufficient and the hydrogen flow control was set too close to 
the limits for unpriming [desamorcage]. As a result, the engine 
operated only a few, very short moments in supersonic mode. 
  During the summer of 1992, ONERA's financial contribution, 
thanks to support by DRET, enabled the CIAM to start up 
preparations again for a second experiment, which had been 
interrupted for lack of funding. 
  A second in-flight test was carried out on 17 November 1992 
from a military base located between Priozersk and Baykonur in 
Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan government officials and scientists 
attended the testing alongside French and Russian scientists. 
<H5>  Second Jointly French-Russian Test </H5>
  The design of the axisymmetric super-ramjet tested by the 
CIAM resembles that of the ESOPE engine tested on the ground by 
the ONERA at the beginning of the seventies in the S4MA wind 
tunnel at its Modane Avrieux center in the French Savoy region. 
The hydrogen combustion, which ignites as soon as the engine 
reaches Mach 3.5, takes place initially in subsonic mode because 
of an injection of hydrogen in the zone upstream of the 
combustion chamber. When the Mach number goes beyond five, the 
injection is distributed between the upstream and downstream 
zones of the combustion chamber to stabilize combustion in 
supersonic mode. 
  This engine and its control system were developed by the 
CIAM 
on a special small-sized test bench in its Turayevo center. The 
mechanical design and manufacture were subsequently handed over 
to the Soyuz development division located near this center. 
  The engine does not fly autonomously. The combined 
engine/control system/tank module is tandem-mounted on a rocket, 
derived from a ground-to-air missile, which ensures its 
acceleration to up to Mach 5.5. This rocket was modified by the 
Fakel engineering and design office which perfected the control 
system in such a way as to ensure a trajectory which is 
sufficiently close to the nominal trajectory enabling the 
super-ramjet to perform well. 
  The rules controlling the hydrogen flow injected into the 
upstream and downstream zones of the combustion chamber are 
based on controlling the priming of the combustion throat [veine 
de combustion] (supersonic flow in the whole chamber). These 
rules were modified for the second flight test to improve the 
available unpriming margin and to enable the engine withstand a 
possible incidence intake during the supersonic combustion phase. 
<H5>  Encouraging Results </H5>
  The trajectory executed by the rocket during the second 
experiment was much nearer to the nominal trajectory than in 
1991. A tank pressurization problem limited the flow of hydrogen 
injected, independently of any regulation, as soon as the 
engine's regenerative cooling system started working at full 
capacity. However, supersonic combustion could be stabilized for 
about 15 seconds. 
  Because the engine remains connected to the carrier rocket, 
it is impossible to obtain a direct measure of the thrust. 
However, the wide use of pressure and temperature gauges along 
the length of the engine should enable the fluid dynamics into 
the engine to be understood better and therefore to facilitate 
the comprehension of physical phenomena governing the 
performance of the super-ramjet. In addition, this will also 
lead to establishing test cases in real, well-documented flight 
conditions for the development and validation of computation 
codes. 
<H5>  An Operation To Be Continued... </H5>
  Although this second experiment was relatively successful 
with the stabilization of combustion in supersonic mode during a 
significant length of time, it should be noted that because of 
the lack of hydrogen flow this operation was far from nearing 
the unpriming limits, therefore at a weak thrust. They were 
also unable to check the efficiency of the hydrogen flow control 
system, whose technology is somewhat old-fashioned, in 
regulating the hydrogen flow to avoid unpriming of the 
combustion throat. 
  Continuing the operation should initially allow the tank 
pressurization problem to be solved, thus avoiding the engine's 
operation at nominal capacity and allowing its in-flight 
control. Next, the engine should be equipped with more 
finely-tuned instruments, possibly based on Western technology, 
and the carrier rocket should be developed to enable a maximum 
Mach flight number to be reached. This should allow us to 
improve our knowledge of the super-ramjet and the quality of the 
validation of computation codes. 
<H5>  Not Just a First Step </H5>
  It is clear that the super-ramjet of the axisymmetrical type 
is not the best propulsion technology for a hypersonic vehicle. 
Indeed, the expanse of wet surfaces, and therefore losses 
through friction and heat exchange, slightly limits the maximum 
thrust level. In addition, it is difficult to combine the 
highly integrated propulsion system needed on hypersonic 
vehicles with the circular section of each engine module. The 
current operation, which benefits from the advances being made 
at the CIAM, should therefore be considered as an initial phase 
making it possible to: 
  -- acquire expertise in the development and experimentation 
of a scramjet; 
  -- set up a database for the validation of computation 
codes. 
  The PREPHA program, although it involves the study of large 
two-dimensional super-ramjets (chamber entrance section: one 
square meter under study, five square decimeters in ground 
testing, to be compared with one square decimeter for the CIAM 
engine) will be the first to benefit from this cooperation. 
  It is above all in the longer term that the evaluation of 
the 
working methods and skills of the CIAM in the field of design 
and testing the super-ramjet will optimize conditions for a 
cooperation program which aims to experiment the autonomous 
flight of a super-ramjet whose design is closer to future needs 
and future applications of hypersonic air-breathing propulsion. 
<H5>  The Scramjet </H5>
  The ramjet benefits from natural recompression linked to a 
slowing down in air intake flow rate. For Mach numbers under 
six, it can be interesting to slow the flow down to subsonic 
level to ensure the best combustion rate without thrust levels 
being strained by too weak pressure recuperation levels in the 
air intake. Beyond this limit (about Mach 6), recompression to 
subsonic flow causes precombustion pressure and temperature 
losses which do not allow enough energy to be added to the flow 
and to transform it into thrust through a sonic nozzle. It is 
therefore preferable to limit recompression to a moderately 
supersonic Mach number (2 to 4) on condition that the techniques 
to stablize supersonic combustion flow are functioning. This is 
scramjet mode. 
  Studies carried out over the past few years on the subject 
of 
partially air-breathing propulsion systems for space launchers 
have led French teams to estimate that limiting the 
air-breathing phase to the Mach-O to Mach-6 level will not 
improve the overall performance in terms of net mass in orbit in 
relation to full rocket propulsion: "Air-breating technology, 
which is heavier, does not pay its way." To develop this field, 
a scramjet is required capable of reaching Mach numbers over 10 
and, which is more likely, close to 12. Although subsonic 
combustion ramjet technology is relatively well mastered in 
France thanks to a number of exploratory developments and to the 
development of the ASMP and the (incomplete) ANS [supersonic 
antiship missile], some research into super-ramjets has been 
conducted during the sixties and seventies (ESOPE: tests at Mach 
6 under forced control [conduite forcee]). This is why PREPHA's 
main objective is to improve our knowledge and our tools for the 
design of the super-ramjet, a potential solution for entirely 
recoverable and reusable launchers in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatol Johansen: "Flying High Without Much </F>
Money -- Europe's Astronauts Will Go Into Space in a Capsule on 
Board the Ariane Rocket"] 
  [Text] Europe is running out of money in space. The 
European research ministers agreed last year that the 13 member 
states of the European Space Agency (ESA) were to spend about 40 
billion German marks [DM] on space up to the year 2000. The 
talk later was of DM35 billion, but even this sum can no longer 
be scraped together. In particular Germany, which has paid an 
annual contribution of DM1.2 billion to ESA to date, and Italy 
wants a further cut in their dues. 
  The European space planners thus find themselves forced to 
change course: The Hermes manned space transporter, which has 
already cost over DM1.75 billion to develop, has been officially 
struck off the ESA program. 
  The "Proposal for a New ESA Strategy" that has now been 
submitted to the ESA member states in Paris recommends a manned 
capsule by the name of the "crew transfer vehicle" (CTV). The 
CTV will be able to convey at least four astronauts into space 
and cost "only" DM2.5 billion. The investment required for 
Hermes is put at DM12 to 15 billion. 
  The capsule will be borne into space on the new European 
launch rocket, Ariane-5, which is scheduled to enter service in 
1995. The planned space vehicle could provide transport to and 
from an international space station and would render Europe 
independent in manned space flight, even without Hermes. 
  The new proposal that ESA has put to its member states also 
envisages a further reduction, to only six meters, in the length 
of the manned Columbus cabin, which is designed to form part of 
an international space station. The module would thus not only 
be cheaper, but would weigh in at about 10 tonnes: Light enough 
for launch on the Ariane-5 rather than the American space 
transporter, as previously envisaged. 
  As late as the November 1992 meeting held in Granada, 
expenditure amounting to about DM5 billion had been sanctioned 
for the Columbus module over the 1994-2000 period. The 
foreshortened model is now expected to be almost DM1.5 billion 
cheaper. ESA also intends to design the Columbus module in such 
a way that, should the need arise, it could serve as the basis 
for a small ESA space station. 
  Last but not least, a space tug will also be built to carry 
manned space vehicles and other payloads from low orbit to the 
space station. 
  The ESA Council is due to meet in Paris on 14 December to 
discuss the new European space program.

  [Text] According to news obtained by SPAZIO INFORMAZIONI 
from a reliable source, the decision by University Education and 
Research Minister Prof. Umberto Colombo on whether to complete 
or abandon the program for the development of the Italian 
scientific satellite SAX (X-Ray Astronomy Satellite) should be 
given in the coming days or at most in the coming weeks. After 
the much-publicized controversies that emerged within the ASI 
[Italian Space Agency] on the scientific value and costs of the 
mission (also involving former ASI Scientific Committee Chairman 
Prof. Remo Ruffini and the Board of Directors at that time 
chaired by Prof. Luciano Guerriero), Minister Colombo had 
foreseen the possibility of freezing the SAX program, assigned 
by the ASI to Alenia Spazio. In an interview given to a 
Milanese daily newspaper last summer, Colombo declared: "I have 
found there is extreme interest in the project. We must 
consider the 320 billion lire already spent and decide whether 
to conclude rapidly to guarantee the effectiveness of the 
research to be performed for a further five to six years, or 
whether it would be advisable to stop now. However there are 
international commitments which must not be forgotten." The SAX 
program, costing a total of approximately 700 billion lire 
(including 418 billion lire for building the satellite), also 
includes the scientific and industrial participation of the 
Netherlands through the NIVR (Dutch Institute for Aircraft 
Development and Aeronautics). 
  The structural and thermal mockup of the satellite is 
currently undergoing vibration, thermal vacuum, and sound tests 
at the European Space Agency (ESA) ESTEC [European Space 
Research and Technology Center] in Noordwijk (the Netherlands), 
while the engineering model is being subjected to a series of 
tests at the Alenia Spazio plant in Turin. "Up to 90 percent of 
the contract has already been spent on building the satellite," 
say the Italian engineers, "and all the hardware is now ready. 
The assembly of the satellite flight units will start in early 
1994. We are making normal progress and our view is that the 
project is gaining increasing scientific importance." According 
to recent forecasts -- and if Minister Colombo does not decide 
otherwise at the last minute -- the SAX satellite should be 
launched into orbit at the end of 1995 by an American launcher, 
Atlas. The current plans of the ASI foresee the building of an 
earth station in Singapore for receiving astronomical data 
collected by SAX and for retransmission to Italy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Communications by Lasers in Space: </F>
`Roll-out' of a Telescope To Receive Laser Signals From ESA's 
ARTEMIS Satellite"] 
  [Text] ESA [European Space Agency] is pushing ahead with 
very advanced technology to transmit data directly from one 
satellite to another. Fibre optics is a well-established 
technology on the ground, but ESA is now developing space 
optical communications using lasers. The first ever 
demonstration of such a link will take place in 1997. 
  The deployment of a one-metre telescope on Tenerife, Canary 
Islands, to receive laser signals from satellites is part of 
this effort. The telescope, financed by the German Space Agency 
DARA, was built by Carl Zeiss Jena and was presented for the 
first time to the public on 23 November 1993. 
  Following comprehensive testing in Germany, the Zeiss 
telescope will be installed on Tenerife in the second half of 
1995, awaiting the launch of ESA's telecommunications satellite 
ARTEMIS [Advanced Relay and Technology Mission] at the end of 
1996 and the comprehensive tests with its SILEX [Semi-Conductor 
Laser Intersatellite Link Experiment] laser-optical payload. 
  ARTEMIS is an advanced satellite for testing and operating 
new telecommunications techniques and will also help to 
introduce several other new services. The SILEX optical 
terminal carried by ARTEMIS will enable it to exchange data with 
other satellites or with ground stations, by sending or 
receiving a laser beam. 
  The Tenerife site chosen for the deployment of the telescope 
is at 2,500 metres altitude. Observations are almost entirely 
undisturbed by stray light and the site is particularly well 
suited to simulating and testing laser optical communications 
with a satellite in geostationary orbit. 
  The first satellite to make use of ARTEMIS laser 
communications capabilities will be the French SPOT-4 Earth 
observation satellite to be launched in early 1997. From its 
low-Earth orbit some 700 km above the ground, SPOT-4 cannot send 
its image data to any one ground station for more than ten 
minutes. Data sent to ground stations overseas often have to be 
transported over long distances for processing and distribution 
to users. 
  Thanks to SILEX, an uninterrupted link between SPOT-4 and 
its 
operations centre in Toulouse, France, will be possible whenever 
the satellite is in sight of ARTEMIS on its geostationary orbit 
36,000 km above Europe; in practice, SPOT-4 will therefore be 
able to observe more than half of the Earth's land masses via an 
ARTEMIS data-relay link. The data rate of SILEX is 50 Mbit per 
second. 
  SILEX is being developed in close cooperation between ESA 
and 
CNES [French National Center for Space Studies]. The 
manufacture of the optical terminals to be installed on the 
spacecraft has been entrusted to a consortium of European 
companies led by Matra-Marconi-Space.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC Biotechnology Policy"] </F>
  [Text] It is generally agreed that biotechnology is a 
vital key to future industrial competitiveness and strength, but 
the EC Commission is concerned that Europe is lagging badly 
behind the United States in this very important field. 
  This was the major point made by the Commission speaker at a 
well attended IETT [Institute of European Trade and Technology] 
conference on the subject in London on November 9th. The 
speaker was Dr. Maurice Lex, who, before moving to the CEC's 
[Commission of the European Community] Biotechnology Unit in 
Brussels, was Acting Director of SERC's [Science and Engineering 
Research Council] Biotechnology Directorate. He went on to list 
what the Commission sees as Europe's chief weaknesses in the 
area. These are: 
  -- Lack of consensus on the scientific objectives to be 
aimed 
for; 
  -- The relative isolation of academic research; 
  -- A complex regulatory system which many find hostile to 
research; 
  -- Under development of the SME sector; 
  -- A poor and declining public perception and understanding 
of biotechnology. (This Dr. Lex identified as perhaps the most 
significant weakness. Even a small amount of negative coverage 
on TV, he said, can have a powerful effect on public opinion, 
even putting students off deciding to specialize in the subject). 
  It was sad to see European companies moving their research 
activities to the United States where regulations are easier, he 
commented. 
  So far, Member States had come together in joint projects as 
part of CEC programmes. More collaboration is needed. 
  But Europe does have its strengths, too: 
  -- Biotechnology is given reasonable priority in the Member 
States; 
  -- There are substantial investments in R&amp;D by large 
companies, mainly chemical, agro-chemical, seed and 
pharmaceutical companies; 
  -- Collaborative behavior has been stimulated by previous EC 
programmes; 
  -- There is strong involvement of a large cross-section of 
industry in horizontal activities -- CEFIC [European Council of 
Federations of the Chemical Industry], SAGB [Senior Advisory 
Group on Biotechnology], National Biotech Associations, 
Industrial Platforms etc.; 
  -- High expectations from various parts of society for 
various reasons. 
  There would be a very significant increase in the funds 
available for supporting biotechnology research in the fourth 
framework programme, Dr. Lex told the conference. He also 
referred to three recent reports issued by the industrial R&amp;D 
committee (IRDAC) of the EC on the life sciences programmes -- 
covering in particular biomedical research, and agriculture, 
biochemical and food, with reference to the fourth Framework 
Programme. 
  IRDAC calls for more industrial participation in all 
projects, and identifies a number of lateral issues which merit 
special attention including training, productive systems, safety 
regulation, intellectual property and education. Copies of 
these reports can be obtained from Dr. Lex, Fax: Brussels 
296-4322. 
  As previously reported, there is a third call for proposals 
under the current CEC Biotechnology programme with a deadline of 
12.1.94. An information pack may be obtained from: E. Magnien, 
DGXII-E/1. Fax: Brussels 295-5365.

<F P=106> [Article by Marjolein Roggen: "It Will Not Be Really Quiet </F>
in the Cabin of the Fokker 100"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam -- Passengers sitting at the rear of a 
Fokker 100 will, for the time being, continue to suffer from 
excessive engine roar. Antinoise systems that have been tested 
by Fokker and the TNO [Netherlands Central Institute for Applied 
Research] Institute of Applied Physics (TPD) seem unable to 
muffle the sound from four independent turbines. Worse still, 
if conditions are unfavorable, the noise actually increases. 
  Passengers in the F-100 are not bothered by the jet engines 
as they sound on the ground, but by the moving parts of the 
engine. In contrast to the engines of the Boeings which 
dominate the fleet in the Netherlands, the engines of the F-100 
are mounted at the rear of the fuselage. Each engine contains a 
high-pressure and a low-pressure spool, in turn consisting of a 
compressor and a turbine. These spools rotate independently of 
one another and each produces its own sound. This imbalance 
means that the passengers seated at the rear of the cabin are 
subjected to a roar of 85 decibels -- a good 10 decibels louder 
than the noise experienced by their fellow passengers at the 
front of the cabin. 
<H5>  Low Frequencies </H5>
  All Fokker's attempts to eliminate the engine imbalance and 
to make the engine suspension more flexible using insulators 
have not had the desired effect. Since the problem is caused by 
low frequencies, conventional, passive silencers have also 
failed to reduce the roar. Antinoise is a highly promising 
technology, particularly for suppressing low frequencies. In 
brief, antinoise systems consist of a microphone which absorbs 
noise, a control unit which records and analyzes this noise, and 
then via a loudspeaker emits a sound into the room which is of 
the same amplitude but the opposite phase, so that ideally it 
should generate silence. 
  Headphones with antinoise are already commercially 
available, 
and next year will see the launch of the first propeller 
aircraft with an antinoise system. However, its first 
commercial application in jet engines will not be for some time, 
principally because there are four frequencies to be suppressed, 
rather than just one as in a propeller airplane. 
<H5>  Eliminate </H5>
  Fokker's antinoise efforts started about three years ago, 
with the Asanca European technology program. The aim of this 
project was to determine how many loudspeakers and microphones 
were required, and where they should be located, to eliminate a 
single frequency. By continually relocating one loudspeaker, a 
mathematical model could be developed. From this model it could 
be deduced that a reduction of six decibels could be achieved 
using four loudspeakers. Using 30 loudspeakers, this figure 
increased to 16 decibels. "That may not be much to people used 
to industrial noise, but in an airplane we are happy with just 
one decibel," said E. Waterman of Fokker Aircraft, speaking last 
week at a symposium about antinoise systems. 
  The results of another project in collaboration with the TPD 
were less encouraging. Four loudspeakers and microphones were 
placed on the rear four rows of seats. The measurements showed 
that this small system was not enough to muffle the noise in a 
restricted area. On the contrary, at the edges of the rows of 
seats, the motor roar was actually eight decibels louder. A 
larger system would be needed to achieve adequate noise 
muffling, even over a small surface area. 
  The results of the test using two frequencies were even more 
dramatic. According to Waterman, it did not work at all. The 
closer the frequencies were to each other, the less successful 
the system was in muffling the sound. Here, too, the noise 
actually increased when the frequencies were virtually 
synchronous. The problem is that the speed of the engine is not 
known in advance. 
<H5>  Purely Comfort </H5>
  The antinoise system as envisaged by Fokker and the TPD is 
not set to be a success just yet. Waterman dismisses ideas for 
making passengers wear (working) headsets or clamping them into 
a headrest with little microphones right beside the ear. She 
says that noise silencing is purely a question of comfort, and 
that passengers will not suffer hearing damage. She is also 
against any system which would prevent passengers from talking 
normally to one another or force them to wear headphones. 
  Whatever the case, Fokker is about to begin follow-up 
research which will look at whether it might be more effective 
to suppress the vibrations.

<F P=106> [Jean-Paul Croize report: "Space Europe in Economy Class"] </F>
  [Text] The desire is there, but still no real agreement: 
Despite a marathon meeting that stretched until 2200 [2100 GMT] 
at the headquarters of the European Space Agency (ESA) in Paris 
last Tuesday, representatives of the agency's 13 member 
countries came away without concluding a detailed arrangement 
that would allow them to finance Europe's "manned flight" 
activities until the end of the century. The next meeting, 
planned for the end of the month, may make it possible to remove 
the obstacles that have caused the talks to stall for more than 
a year: The financial allocation of work which everyone agrees 
is necessary if Europe is to keep an "honorable" place in the 
area of human activities in orbit at the end of the century. 
  "We are confident. Not only did the delegates confirm their 
agreement on what must apparently be carried out, but they also 
defined the global budgets that must be allocated in 1994 and 
1995," said ESA spokesmen yesterday. They said that following 
the meeting the ESA member countries unanimously confirmed their 
approval of the two "leading" European projects in the area of 
human activities in orbit: The creation of a Columbus module 
that can be docked to the international Russian-American space 
station and an improved space capsule, which would be designed 
in two versions: one manned, and the other automatic. 
  One point was even presented as "very positive": The 
potential partners for these two projects agreed on the total 
amount to be earmarked to their implementation over the next two 
years. Following what has been called an "act in council," it 
was decided to earmark 1.9 billion French francs [Fr] for that 
period to the Columbus program. This amount, however, not only 
covers the design of a manned module, but also includes the 
financing of Euromir space flights which the ESA is to undertake 
next fall and in 1995 with the Russians on board the MIR space 
station. 
<H5>  Problem With Rates </H5>
  The space capsule program, now called the MSTP, should 
benefit from a budget of Fr1.45 billion intended to finance four 
projects: projects for the two types of planned capsules (manned 
and automatic), as well as studies on the robot arm identical to 
that on the shuttle to be built by Europe, and the spacesuit 
which ESA astronauts will need in order to carry out 
extra-vehicular missions. 
  The problem, however, is that these projects remain 
dependent 
on a display of "willingness:" "Problems with the conversion 
rates of currencies for certain partners with respect to the 
European unit of account have prevented the conclusion of an 
agreement on the proportion that each party should pay for these 
programs," said the ESA spokesman. In concrete terms, there has 
not been much of a move away from the decisionmaking level 
reached during the last ministerial summit held in Granada in 
late 1992. Even if the manned flight program has been 
approached in a more modest manner since 1987, everyone is still 
agreed on the fact that the ESA must have autonomy in this area. 
However, outside France, nobody has proven genuinely interested 
in paying for it. 
  The representatives of the ESA member countries decided to 
meet again at the end of the month. Informal talks should be 
held between now and then in an effort to try and reach an 
agreement on the respective shares for each party in these two 
programs. In the event of failure, the situation would become 
serious: "There is no longer the possibility of delaying if we 
want to move forward using genuinely coherent information at the 
next ministerial meeting planned for next year, and especially 
if we want to present in time -- i.e., by the end of the century 
-- a modern orbital capsule which the Russians and Americans 
would have a real interest in using," stressed industrial 
circles.

<F P=106> [Article by G. Seibert: "The EMIR-1 Program - A Basic </F>
European Microgravity Research Programme"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Background and Objectives </H5>
  In June 1992 the ESA Microgravity Programme Board adopted a 
Resolution on the future structure of the Programme, which 
requested that in future the Agency's microgravity activities be 
split into two distinct financially independent elements: 
  -- A basic European Microgravity Research Programme (EMIR); 
  -- A programme to develop the facilities required for 
microgravity experiments to be carried out in the Columbus 
Attached Laboratory (MFC = Microgravity Facilities for Columbus). 
  This Programme Board Resolution was approved by the Council 
at Ministerial level on 9/10 November 1992 at Granada. 
  In May 1993 the Microgravity Programme Board approved the 
transformation of the ongoing extended Phase 2 of the ESA 
Microgravity Programme into the EMIR-1 Programme by re-orienting 
its scientific/technical content towards fundamental research. 
<H3>  The Subscription Levels of Participating Member States to 
the EMIR-1 Programme </H3>
<H3>  Scale of Subscriptions of Participating Countries in the 
EMIR-1 Programme </H3>
  -- Germany: 25 percent 
  -- Austria: 0 percent 
  -- Belgium: 3.81 percent 
  -- Denmark: 1.96 percent 
  -- Spain: 2 percent 
  -- France: 12 percent 
  -- Italy: 15.86 percent 
  -- Ireland: 0 percent 
  -- Norway: 0.34 percent 
  -- Netherlands: 4 percent 
  -- United Kingdom: 1.15 percent 
  -- Sweden: 4.50 percent 
  -- Switzerland: 4 percent 
  -- Total subscription: 74.62 percent 
  -- Not covered: 25.38 percent 
  The motivation of Member States to establish a basic 
microgravity research programme EMIR is based on the desire to 
ensure modest but assured funding for basic microgravity 
research activities independent of possible programmatic changes 
in large infrastructure elements such as Space Station/Columbus 
and Hermes. It is assumed as a general guideline that Short 
Duration (Sounding Rocket, Parabolic Aircraft Flights etc), 
Shuttle-related and non-Shuttle related activities are of 
approximately equal importance and are therefore funded at 
similar levels. 
<H5>  1.1 Scientific Aspects </H5>
  The main features of microgravity are the elimination of 
gravity-driven convection, sedimentation and fluid-static 
pressure. The feasibility of containerless processing is 
another advantage of this unique environment. 
  Density gradients in liquids and gases arise wherever 
temperature or concentration gradients exist. This is the case 
with any heat treatment and any process involving phase 
transitions or chemical reactions. Density gradients and their 
corollary, buoyancy-driven convection, prevail thus in fluids on 
Earth. The effects of convective flow may dominate heat and 
mass transfer and limit the control of numerous processes such 
as crystallisation. It prohibits conducting defined model 
experiments for testing theoretical models. Under microgravity 
conditions gravity-driven convection is virtually eliminated. 
Consequently a new generation of experimental research in Fluid 
and Materials Sciences becomes feasible in space. 
  Fluid dynamics phenomena can be investigated without the 
interference of gravity-driven convection. Results from such 
studies are expected to provide important feedback for the 
testing and development of theories describing three-dimensional 
laminar, oscillatory and turbulent flow generated by various 
other driving forces. 
  In space, diffusion-controlled heat and mass transport 
conditions in fluids can be achieved. This was demonstrated 
with a variety of experiments, whereby exceptionally precise 
data on self-diffusion, hetero-diffusion and thermo-transport 
were obtained. 
  In crystallization, the control of heat and mass transfer 
presents a major problem, and microgravity is therefore of great 
interest for the solidification of metals and alloys and for 
crystal growth in general. Virtually all crystal growth 
processes from melts, solutions, and vapours involve thermal and 
concentration gradients driving buoyancy flow on Earth. The 
crystallisation under conditions of diffusion-controlled heat 
and mass transfer in microgravity should enable to optimise 
these processes and finally to better control the product. 
Chemically homogeneous semiconductors have been obtained and 
crystals grown from the vapour phase and from solutions have 
reduced defect density. 
  One of the very promising projects is the crystallization of 
proteins. The molecular structure of only several hundred out 
of an estimated million of different proteins has been 
unravelled. The difficulty lies in obtaining sufficiently 
large, and sufficiently perfect crystals for X-Ray diffraction 
analysis. There are clear experimental indications that the 
crystallisation of proteins is enhanced in space. Recent 
experiments yielded a variety of protein crystals of a quality 
superior to those obtained on the ground. 
  In space, the behaviour of mixtures of liquids with gases 
and 
solids can be investigated without sedimentation causing 
separation of the components according to their densities. The 
elaboration of composites such as high-porosity alloys or 
particle and fibre dispersions which cannot be obtained on the 
ground, can be investigated in space. 
  The absence of fluid-static pressure and of gravity-driven 
convection provides optimal conditions for the investigation of 
capillarity phenomena, phase transitions, and critical point 
phenomena in fluids. As the critical point is approached, the 
compressibility of fluids increases by orders of magnitude, and 
on Earth a fluid is therefore compressed under its own weight. 
The fluid is stratified according to density, and homogeneous 
bulk samples needed for investigating phenomena near the 
critical point can only be obtained in space. 
  In the absence of gravity, melts can be positioned and 
manipulated without containers. Containerless processing is of 
interest since crucibles can be the source of contamination, 
heterogeneous nucleation, and mechanical stress. So far very 
few microgravity experiments on glass formation have been 
undertaken. There is the possibility of studying under cooling, 
nucleation, and the formation of metastable phases in the 
containerless mode. 
  Combustion is an example of a process where microgravity has 
dramatic effects. There are complex chemical reactions with 
large temperature and concentration gradients and, therefore, 
with strong convection. Microgravity is the only means by which 
combustion phenomena can be investigated under 
diffusion-controlled conditions and without sedimentation 
(droplet and particle burning). 
  There is a new class of experiments emerging using the 
near-weightlessness condition for fundamental physics 
investigations. Besides tests of general relativity (e.g. STEP 
project), there are projects on developing an ultraprecise 
atomic clock with the long-term perspective of application in 
Global Pointing Systems, studies on fractal materials, 
aggregation phenomena and thermal radiation forces. It can be 
expected that more physicists will discover microgravity as a 
tool for research in the future. 
  Space life sciences experiments aim at identifying the part 
which gravity plays at all levels of life from the organization 
of a single cell to the nature of gravity-resisting and 
detecting mechanisms in more highly developed organisms 
including man. 
  In the life sciences, microgravity provides unique 
experimental conditions that are unavailable on Earth. 
Microgravity studies on the underlying mechanism in cellular 
processes add a new dimension to our basic knowledge in biology. 
Studying higher organised life forms such as plants, small 
animals or even man himself, can reveal gravity-dependent 
processes, or gravity responses to gravi-sensing mechanisms, all 
of which can be considered as an extension of ground-based 
research. 
  To the biologist, microgravity offers a whole new area of 
research: Life has evolved within the limits of the particular 
physical conditions on Earth, where most of these conditions - 
with the exception of gravity - are variable. Most of our 
understanding of the functioning of living organisms was 
obtained by varying these conditions in a controlled manner, 
however, always against a background of at least 1 g. 
  Investigations under reduced gravity forces therefore 
represent a completely new field for biological research. 
Initial studies were performed in plant biology, where 
microgravity proved to be a unique tool for research into 
mechanisms of graviresponse. 
  Studies in developmental biology and cell biology have 
generated many new and open questions. On a macro-scopic level, 
most biological processes appear not to differ in a microgravity 
environment. However, results clearly show that on the level of 
individuals cells or tissue, unexpected and often rather drastic 
differences occur. These results are intriguing. They provide 
a strong basis for obtaining insight in the (unexpected) role of 
gravity in fundamental cell biological processes, in regulatory 
mechanisms and their influence on the level of whole plants or 
animals (including man). 
  Further research in these fields will also contribute to the 
field of exobiology. Questions about the origin of life on 
Earth, the likelihood of life having originated on other 
celestial bodies, the possibility of interplanetary (or 
interstellar system) transfer of living organisms will all be 
addressed by this discipline, that is included in the programme. 
The finding that gravity may influence cellular, or even 
molecular processes, therefore has strong relevance for the 
study of those fundamental questions. 
  Furthermore, there is a group of processes of adaptation to 
the absence of gravity, the study of which could well illuminate 
the normally-occurring process. In the absence of gravity bone 
becomes demineralized and muscle proteins are broken down faster 
than they are built up. The cardio-vascular system has to 
function differently in the presence of different hydrostatic 
forces. Prolonged bed-rest can simulate some of the gross 
effects of weightlessness, but microgravity has already been 
shown to produce additional effects, presumably because of the 
elimination of actions due to differences in the magnitude and 
direction of force on individual components of the body. 
  The study of the interaction of cosmic-ray particles with 
living matter is another area of research. While a considerable 
part of this work can be conducted with particles generated 
using Earth-based accelerators, the full spectrum of HZE 
particles, however, is difficult to produce simultaneously. 
There already is some experimental evidence that space flight 
factors such as weightlessness enhance the biological effects of 
radiation, and the mechanisms of this could cast much light on 
the functioning of the genetic apparatus. It will also assist 
with the evaluation of the radiation hazards to man during 
prolonged space missions, in terms of both, their immediate and 
their longer-term effects. 
<H5>  1.2 General EMIR Programme Objectives </H5>
  The main objectives of the EMIR Programme are: 
  -- To promote fundamental and applied research in materials, 
fluid, physical and life sciences in space; and 
  -- To establish the necessary knowledge base of research and 
engineering results in order to provide the firm foundation upon 
which future activities with a more applied or commercial thrust 
can be built. 
  These objectives shall be met by: 
  (a) The Development of Research Facilities 
  Multi-user Facilities and dedicated specific experiment 
equipment will be developed for sounding rockets, Shuttle, 
Spacelab, Foton/Nika type retrievable carriers and MIR in such a 
way as to reflect the evolving scientific needs. 
  (b) The Provision of Flight Opportunities 
  A balanced programme of flight opportunities using 
short-duration suborbital flights (parabolic aircraft flights, 
sounding rockets, etc.) Spacelab, retrievable carriers and MIR, 
will be provided in such a way as to ensure the regular 
availability in the short and medium term of the microgravity 
environment to the scientific user communities. This is 
considered a prerequisite for the further evolution of basic 
research in the microgravity environment. 
  (c) The Nurturing of the User Community 
  Ground-based research which may ultimately require further 
experimentation in low-gravity conditions will be encouraged at 
the European national level or via ESA Prodex programmes 
whenever possible. 
<H5>  2. Operating Principles of the EMIR Programme </H5>
  (a) Scientific Emphases 
  The Agency's EMIR Programme will give equal importance to 
life sciences and materials/fluid/physical sciences. Scientific 
excellence will be the overall guidelines determining 
priorities. The Agency will pre-select, with the help of 
independent scientific peers, the experiments on the basis of 
scientific merit and space relevance and will submit lists of 
pre-selected experiments to the Microgravity Programme Board for 
approval. With the help of its Microgravity Advisory Committee 
the Agency intends to identify areas of scientific priorities 
and to initiate a grouping of experiment proposals into focuses, 
which will, in general, be centred around proposals of 
exceptional quality. 
  (b) Use of Existing Facilities 
  The selection of flight opportunities will be made on the 
basis of cost effectiveness, and so maximum use will be made of 
existing multi-user and dedicated experimental hardware. 
  (c) International Cooperation 
  Since the orbital flight opportunities are rather scarce at 
present, the Agency will continue to expand the international 
cooperation with the United States of America, Russia and other 
countries pursuing microgravity activities. For instance in the 
immediate future this means that the Agency intends to expand 
its use of the NASA spacelab missions and the Russian Foton/Nika 
type retrievable carriers and MIR missions. This cooperation 
covers also joint basic microgravity research and joint use of 
the experimental flight hardware. 
  (d) Technology Development 
  The ESA EMIR Programme will pursue and extend, in its 
Supporting Technology Element, the development of advanced 
technology required for the development of high-quality 
experiment equipment, its automation, the application of 
telescience and robotics. 
  (e) Data Base 
  In the frame of the ESA Microgravity Programme a 
Microgravity 
data base of scientific results has been established. This data 
base is available to all users from academic and industrial 
research laboratories. It is expected that via a data 
dissemination system a wide spectrum of the research community 
can be reached. 
  (f) Scientific Reporting/Education 
  A further means to promote microgravity research will be the 
presentation of results at conferences of scientific and 
professional associations and the support of "microgravity 
summer schools" which aim at the involvement of young scientists 
in future microgravity activities. 
  (g) Advisory Bodies 
  The Agency intends to continue to utilise expert advisory 
bodies, i.e. the Microgravity Advisory Committee and discipline 
working/expert groups which are made up of top level scientists. 
These groups regularly review the programme, support the Agency 
in selecting the best research proposals (use of scientific peer 
groups), and suggest - based on the results of experiments - new 
studies, the introduction of new research fields and also 
focusing on prioritized research fields. 
<H5>  3. Overall Description of the EMIR-1 Programme Elements </H5>
  The proposed EMIR-1 Programme is a merger of Phase 2, and of 
the Second Extension to Phase 2. For EMIR-1 two basic options 
concerning the programme content can be identified. The two 
options referred to as Option A and Option B, relate to the fact 
that the Spacelab Mission E1, which the Microgravity Programme 
would like to use to the maximum extent, has not been approved 
yet. It is uncertain, at present, if Member States will agree 
to "sufficient" funding in the framework of these Columbus 
Precursor Missions to finance the E1-Spacelab Mission. 
  Option A reflects the programmatic content and the proposed 
adjustments of the Second Extension assuming that the E1- 
Spacelab Mission will be funded. This option is the clearly 
preferred one and has been a key planning hypothesis over the 
past years. 
  Option B reflects a situation where the E1-Spacelab Mission 
would not be funded. This option has not been studied to the 
same extent as Option A in view of the indication given by the 
States participating in the Precursor Missions in the past, that 
preference would be given to funding of the Spacelab E-1 
mission. Therefore, Option A was discussed as planning baseline. 
  In the following subsections the various programme elements 
are described, and where relevant, the alternative flight 
opportunities are identified if no E1 Spacelab missions would be 
funded. 
  The various programme elements are grouped in the following 
activities: 
  -- General Activities, covering studies, technology, data 
base and expert working groups etc.; 
  -- Mini Missions, covering sounding rockets, parabolic 
aircraft flights, GAS and drop tower/tube experimentation; 
  -- Spacelab Facility Development/Reflights, covering the 
following individual facilities: 
  a) Biorack reflights on IML-2 and E1 Spacelab missions; 
  b) Bubble Drop and Particle Unit reflight on IML-2 and E1 
Spacelab missions; 
  c) Critical Point Facility on IML-2 and E1 Spacelab 
missions; 
  d) Anthrorack reflight on the E1 Spacelab Mission; 
  e) Advanced Fluid Physics Module reflight on E1 Spacelab 
Mission; 
  f) Advanced Protein Crystallisation Facility on Spacehab 1, 
IML-2 and two other missions; 
  g) Advanced Gradient Heating Facility on Spacelab missions 
such as E1 or equivalent. 
  -- Spacelab Independent Payloads, covering the development 
and mission costs of the diffusion measurement Facility (a GAS), 
and mission costs of the APCF on Spacehab (June 1993); 
  -- Payload Development/Refurbishment, covering the planned 
development of the Fluid Physics Facility (derived from LSF), of 
the Floating Zone Stability Module for Foton, the costs 
associated with the utilisation of existing facilities on MIR, 
and the development of the Breath Analyzer and BIB-incubator for 
the MIR-95 mission. (BIB = Brunel Institute of Bioengineering.) 
In addition, the refurbishment costs for the reflights of 
Biobox and Biopan are included in this programme activity. For 
new developments for Foton an attempt will be made to apply the 
technology used for sounding rockets; 
  -- Mission Costs for Retrievable Carriers/MIR, covering 
missions costs for ESA payloads on Foton/Nika-type missions and 
potentially special payload services for the MIR missions; 
  -- Participation in NASA Spacelab Missions, covering at 
present the development of the Torque Velocity Dynamometer (TVD) 
and Neurorack for the NASA Spacelab Missions SLS-3 and SLS-4, 
but could be extended to cover ESA payloads on other Spacelab 
missions of NASA; 
  -- Phase B Studies, covering the Phase B studies of 
multi-user facilities for Columbus (i.e. the Biolab, Materials 
Science Lab and the Fluid Science Lab) which will later become 
part of the MFC programme. 
  In the following sections, short descriptions of those 
programme elements or activities shall be given which still play 
a major role in the future. 
<H5>  3.1 Future Studies </H5>
  Since the amounts obtainable from General Studies are more 
and more reduced, there is a strong need for this activity to be 
maintained within the EMIR Programme. In 1993 the funds needed 
are especially high because parallel Phase A studies had been 
initiated in 1992 for the microgravity facilities for the 
Columbus APM. Past experience has shown that parallel studies 
are in the best interest of the Agency from a 
cross-fertilisation viewpoint and in order to maintain 
competition up to fixed-price offers for the Phases B and C/D. 
Other areas which require studies are: 
  -- Analysis of scientific, technical and operational 
requirements of proposed experiments; 
  -- Payload accommodation studies for retrievable carriers; 
  -- Investigation of required gravity levels across all 
Microgravity disciplines; 
  -- Feasibility studies of multi-user facilities (e.g. 
Neurorack); 
  -- The implementation telescience. 
<H5>  3.2 Supporting Technology </H5>
  In order to remove technological, schedule and hence cost 
risks, a supporting technology programme element is needed to 
ensure timely development in potentially critical areas. At the 
request of the Microgravity Programme Board the originally 
planned amount for supporting technology has been reduced and to 
the programme element "Mission Costs for Retrievable 
Carriers/MIR" has been increased accordingly, because no funds 
were originally planned to support the suddenly upcoming 
Euro-MIR 94 and 95 missions. This means that the planned early 
breadboarding of MFC within the Supporting Technology Programme 
can no longer be performed. 
<H5>  3.3 Microgravity Data Base (MG-DB) </H5>
  The MG-DB entered its final test phase in March 1993, after 
the building up phase of collecting and formatting the data had 
been concluded. The first release of the MG-DB to the large 
user community is planned for the autumn of 1993. 
  The User Support Centres MARS, MUSC, CADMOS and DUC were 
involved in the establishment of the data base and have ensured 
the largest possible coverage of microgravity experiments. 
Between March and June 1993, a selected number of users were 
given the opportunity to examine the application, easy access, 
man-machine interface as well as the quality of the data. The 
ESA MG-DB contains at present the description and results of 
about 180 European and 600 NASA/United States experiments. By 
the end of 1993 the MG-DB will contain all the European 
microgravity experiments flown and a short description of the 
objectives of those experiments which are planned to be flown in 
the near future. 
  The Agency reached an agreement with NASA to share the 
experimental data of both sides and to develop and use 
compatible formats and application procedures. 
<H5>  3.4 Experts, Advisory/Working Groups, Purchase Orders </H5>
  This programme element includes a number of general 
activities which in the past fell under ESA internal costs, but 
which in reality do not belong there. The following expenses 
are covered by this programme element: 
  -- Experts and consultants, scientific advisory/working and 
expert groups, peer groups for experiment evaluation, symposia 
support, etc.; 
  -- Use of facilities, laboratories and computer services; 
  -- Purchase orders (this type of procurement procedure is 
often used for smaller equipment items because it strongly 
reduces the administrative effort and associated delays). 
<H5>  3.5 Sounding Rockets </H5>
  Sounding rockets have played a significant role in 
microgravity experiments, particularly in Europe through the 
German national programme TEXUS (Technologische Experimente 
Unter Schwerelosigkeit), in which ESA participates at a level of 
about 50 percent. In the United States and Japan sounding 
rocket programmes were also carried out for microgravity 
research, but in a more sporadic manner. In addition to the 
normal two TEXUS rocket flights per year, the Swedish Space 
Corporation (SSC), with major ESA participation (about 90 
percent), started a sounding rocket programme called MASER 
(Materials Research Experiment Rockets) in 1987, with a flight 
frequency of one payload every 18 months. 
  Five successful Maser flights were carried out to date, and 
the sixth is planned for November of this years. 
  Apart from the established usefulness of such flights for 
materials/fluid sciences, sounding rockets offer good 
opportunities for experimental study and assessment of the 
gravity relevance of some key bioprocesses which do not require 
long exposure to microgravity. Sounding rocket experiments are 
especially appreciated by the scientific community because of 
the short lead time between experiment selection and flight, and 
because of the frequent flight opportunities. 
  In the TEXUS programme 30 sounding rocket payloads were 
flown 
since 1977. Microgravity durations of the order of six minutes 
are achieved by payloads of about 360 kg (250 kg pure 
experimental hardware) flown to an altitude of 250 km. Launch 
and recovery takes place at ESRANGE near Kiruna in Northern 
Sweden, the launch vehicle being a Skylark 7. 
  The payloads of Texus and Maser consist of up to six 
autonomous experiment modules, each with its own power supply, 
data handling, and in some cases, video monitoring and 
telecommand for real-time experiment control. New module types 
are continuously under development, depending on the experiments 
selected during each call for experiment proposals. 
  The use of longer-duration sounding rocket flights using 
larger rockets, is attractive for many experiments. Therefore 
MBB/ERNO and SSC established the Maxus sounding rocket programme 
and considered the following design criteria: 
  -- Re-use of existing Texus/Maser hardware; 
  -- Microgravity time off up to 14 minutes; 
  -- Experimental payload of about 440 kg. 
  The first Maxus flight partially failed, however, the 
payload 
was safely recovered. The reflight in November 1992 was 
successful. 
  The programme element sounding rockets has somewhat suffered 
from the: 
  -- Stretching of approved MG programmes within the same 
financial envelope; 
  -- From the increase of the mission costs (flight ticket and 
payload), because for geographic return reasons, new 
unexperienced contractors for the development of payload modules 
had to be involved. 
  Considering the present budget for sounding rockets, which 
has not been reduced or blocked as a consequence of the low 
subscription to the approved Extended Phase 2, the mission 
scenario looks as follows: a Maser (6) and a Texus (31) flight 
in November 1993, a further Texus flight in 1994, a Maxus 2 
flight in Spring 1995, followed by Maser 7 in Spring 1996. It 
is assumed that new funds will be available from the EMIR-2 
programme for the 1997 sounding rocket activities. 
<H5>  3.6 Parabolic Flights </H5>
  For many years, in the United States and in recent years 
also 
in Europe, aircraft flying parabolic trajectories have been 
employed to produce low gravity conditions. In the early years 
this was mostly for astronaut training and similar activities. 
More recently, these parabolic flights have been used for 
microgravity activities, especially precursor experiments, 
equipment checkout and experimental parameter optimisation, in 
materials sciences and the life sciences. 
  From the life sciences perspective, parabolic flights are 
useful not only for testing new procedures and equipment, but 
they also provide the opportunity of crew involvement. 
Furthermore, the periods of hypergravity, which occur during 
re-acceleration and climb to altitude in such flights, are also 
useful, for example, for the construction of physiological 
models over a wider range of gravity levels, and for 
understanding instantaneous dynamics of physiological reactions 
to transient g-levels. 
  Several types of aircraft were used. ESA was able to use the 
NASA KC-135 aircraft six times, both as precursors to Spacelab 
flights for experiment optimisation, and also, more generally, 
for experimental opportunities for interested microgravity 
researchers. The disadvantage of the KC-135 flights was that its 
campaigns were performed as JSC Houston, so that all 
experimenters with their equipment had to travel to Houston. 
Therefore the French company NOVESPACE, with major investments 
of CNES, made a Caravelle airplane available which ESA has used 
twelve times since February 1989. In 1994 the flight 
certificate of the Caravelle (the aircraft is some 20 years old) 
will probably expire and a new solution for parabolic aircraft 
flights has to be found. In this context the procurement of an 
Airbus A 300 was proposed; however a procurement of leasing 
would cost between 14.5 and 20 MAU [million accounting units] 
for 4 to 8 years' leasing options. In addition, the Airbus has 
a very large capacity (about 12 tons, 50 passengers) - too large 
for it to be used fully and efficiently for the ESA MG 
programme. The advantages of Caravelle's frequent flight 
opportunities -- so much in demand -- would be lost to the users. 
  Another alternative to Caravelle might be the commercial 
offer of the company "Elbe Space and Technology Dresden", 
proposing parabolic flight services with a Russian aircraft 
IL-76 MDK. However, the safety aspects, which are also based on 
the flight history of a plane, might pose a problem. The 
technical capabilities of the IL- 76 MDK are somewhat larger 
than those of the Caravelle and its utilisation is therefore 
slightly more expensive. 
  The budgetary planning of parabolic aircraft flight 
campaigns 
in the EMIR-1 Programme (each consisting of some 90 parabolas 
with about 20 seconds of 10-2 periods) assumes two campaigns per 
year until 1997. 
<H5>  3.7 Spacelab Facility Development/Reflights </H5>
  This major element of the programme covers the developments 
in the past and the refurbishment and reflights of some ten 
different independent multi-user facilities. Since all these 
facilities were described in detail in PB-MG documents (e.g. 
ESA/PB-MG(89)9), a document of 85 pages, most of them also in 
"Microgravity News" and in many external publications, no full 
description of these facilities will be repeated here. However, 
remarks to the status of flight opportunities, especially where 
the not yet approved Precursor Mission E1 is concerned, will be 
given below. 
<H5>  3.7.1 Vestibular Sled </H5>
  The Vestibular Sled, already developed prior to the start of 
Phase 2 of the Microgravity Programme, was designed to support 
the investigation of the functional organisation of man's 
vestibular apparatus and orientation system and the vestibular 
adaptation process in the absence of gravity. 
  The Sled was flown on the German Spacelab mission D-1 in 
1985. It provided a linear acceleration (0.2 g max) with a 
well-defined level and profile, on an astronaut attached to a 
seat which moved on rails along the centre aisle of the 
Spacelab, the Astronaut could be oriented in three planes with 
respect to the acceleration vector. The vestibular system of the 
astronaut could be stimulated both thermally and optokinetically 
during the experiment. 
  Mainly due to its heavy demands in terms of resources (total 
Spacelab floor) and due to disturbances generated during its 
operation, Sled could not find further Spacelab flight 
opportunities. However, both Sled models were used successfully 
in terrestrial research laboratories. No further expenses for 
the Vestibular Sled are planned in the MG Programme. 
<H5>  3.7.2 Biorack </H5>
  The Biorack is a multi-purpose facility for experiments in 
cell and developmental biology and radiation biophysics. Its 
first two flights were on the German Mission D-1 in 1985 and on 
IML-1 1992, and it will be reflown on the NASA International 
Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2 Spacelab Mission in July 1994. 
  The main elements of the Biorack are incubators, a 
cooler/freezer and a glovebox. It also includes special 
canisters for transporting and maintaining sensitive biological 
samples under a well-defined thermal environment. Experiments 
are in general housed in small experiment containers of standard 
dimensions. The experiment containers are provided to the 
investigators who accommodate their biological samples, 
nutrients, etc. according to their specific requirements. 
  In future, after IML-2, it is planned to refly Biorack on 
the 
E1 Spacelab mission. If this mission is not approved, there is 
a good chance that Biorack will be selected for a NASA Spacelab 
mission. In the "Call for Experiments" for the NASA Spacelab 
mission SLS-4, Biorack is offered to support research areas in 
cell and molecular neurobiology and developmental processes at 
cellular level. 
<H5>  3.7.3 AFPM (Advanced Fluid Physics Module) </H5>
  The AFPM evolved from the Fluid Physics Module. It was 
successfully flown on the German Spacelab mission D-2 in April 
1993. It is designed, like the FPM, for investigation of liquid 
bridge stability. Marangoni convection, drop coalescence, 
surface and interfacial forces, capillary phenomena and the 
behaviour of containerless immiscible fluids. The system and 
diagnostics are more sophisticated than the original FPM. 
  The core of the AFPM is an interchangeable test chamber with 
two coaxial discs (up to 100 mm diameter). Liquids can be 
injected through one of the discs so that a liquid column can be 
mechanically stimulated either by rotating the discs or by axial 
vibrations. The discs can be heated such as to establish the 
temperature gradients required in the liquid. 
  Illumination of meridian or cross-sectional planes permits 
the observation of phenomena within the liquid. Images can be 
recorded by two TV cameras. A thermographic camera permits also 
the determination of the surface temperatures. 
  In future, after D-2, it is planned to refly the AFPM on the 
Spacelab Mission E-1. Should this mission not be realised, the 
following near term alternative exists: The Floating Zone 
Stability Module, planned to be developed for a Foton flight in 
1996, could be extended to cover the essential capabilities of 
the AFPM. The remote control capabilities of Foton are rather 
limited. Therefore an effort should be made to improve this 
capability of Foton. 
<H5>  3.7.4 BDPU (Bubble Drop and Particle Unit) </H5>
  The BDPU is dedicated to the study of the behaviour of 
bubbles, drops and particles in transparent liquids. The unit 
is modular consisting of a test container with test cells, a 
fluid injection system and a fluid reservoir. The test 
container can be replaced in orbit. The temperature of the 
fluid can be controlled and thermal gradients can be generated. 
Acoustic and mechanical means for mixing of the fluids are 
provided. The diagnostic means include direct observation by 
TV, cine and still cameras, a Point Diffraction Interferometer 
and a Schlieren Optics System. 
  Temperatures are monitored by ten sensors in the wall of 
test 
cell, and surface temperatures are determined by a thermographic 
camera. 
  The BDPU will fly on the Spacelab mission IML-2 in June 
1994, 
during which about half of its utilisation is given to United 
States investigators in return for a free flight ticket (i.e. 
mission and integration) on IML-2. NASA is also interested in 
sharing the utilisation of BDPU on the E1 mission and would 
compensate this by reducing the Shuttle costs for the E1 
mission. Should there be no E1 flight opportunity, the BDPU 
could probably refly on one of NASA's Spacelab missions, which 
are planned by NASA as successor missions - with international 
participation - of the national USML-1 and USML-2 missions, or 
on Space Station Precursor missions. 
<H5>  3.7.5 CPF (Critical Point Facility) </H5>
  This facility is designed to investigate phenomena occurring 
near the critical point in transparent fluids under microgravity 
conditions. It has flown on IML-1 in 1992 and is scheduled for 
flight on the IML-2 Spacelab mission in June 1994. 
  The major elements of this facility are a precision 
thermostat with an experiment-dedicated fluid cell. Various 
stimuli, such as acoustic stirring, heating and cooling can be 
applied. Thermal and optical diagnostic systems permit 
observation of flow and of phase separation. 
  The thermostats can be exchanged in orbit so that different 
systems can be investigated. The temperature in the thermostats 
can be controlled in the range of 30-70 Degrees Celsius with an 
accuracy of 1 milli-Kelvin and a stability of 0.1 milli-Kelvin. 
  The optical diagnostics consist of a Schlieren optics 
system, 
a Twyman-Green type interferometer, a small and wide-angle light 
scattering measurement system and a light-attenuation 
measurement system. 
  In future it is planned to fly the CPF on the E1 Spacelab 
mission. Should this mission not take place CPF could probably 
fly on one of NASA's missions, under similar conditions 
(IML-conditions) as on IML-1 in 1992 and IML-2 in 1994. There 
is considerable interest in the United States of America to 
continue joint ESA/NASA flights on the CPF. 
<H5>  3.7.6 Anthrorack </H5>
  The Anthrorack is a multi-user facility for research in 
human 
physiology, which was successfully flown on the German Spacelab 
mission D-2. The concepts is to measure interrelated body 
systems (e.g. cardiopulmonary metabolic etc.) simultaneously on 
the same subject, thereby allowing the intercomparison of data 
in a whole body analysis. 
  Such an approach allows sets of high quality extensive 
science data to be acquired, and it mitigates the effects of the 
serious lack of mission opportunities and the low number of test 
subjects, which have precluded a normal statistical approach. 
Specific system-stimulation devices are provided in order to 
perturb well- regulated and balanced body systems e.g. heart 
rate and fluid distribution, in a calibrated and reproducible 
fashion. 
  Anthrorack contains specialised equipment for monitoring, on 
a non-invasive basis, the cardiovascular adaptation, 
deconditioning and pulmonary function. It has provisions for 
sampling, processing, conservation and acquisition of signals 
representing the biopotentials (ECG, EMG, EOG, EEG), blood 
pressure, body temperature and ambient conditions. 
  The experiments on the first mission covered three major 
groups, namely cardiovascular, pulmonary and hormonal research 
experiments. There are two major monitoring and diagnostic 
systems: the Respiratory Monitoring System, based on a mass 
spectrometer for analyzing the pulmonary functions, and the 
Ultrasound Monitoring System for studying cardiovascular 
functions. The major body stimulation equipment is a Bicycle 
Ergometer mounted on the centre aisle of Spacelab. A high-speed 
centrifuge is included to permit the processing of blood samples 
on board. 
  It is planned to refly Anthrorack on the E1 Spacelab 
mission. 
Should this mission not take place, the Anthrorack could be 
converted into an ESA-Neurorack for the NASA SLS-4-Neurolab 
mission. For a Neurorack it is planned anyhow to use similar 
infrastructure and service elements as for Anthrorack. 
Anthrorack would have to be modified for the specific needs of 
the Neurolab mission objectives. 
  In particular re-use of the following Anthrorack 
sub-elements 
is foreseen: 
  -- Central computer unit for data acquisition and transfer; 
  -- Modular support equipment with plug-in modules and the 
modular support system for experiment specific equipment (ESE); 
  -- Automated blood pressure measurement system; 
  -- Remote signal conditioner units for support of EMG, EOG, 
ECG, EEG, strain gauge dynamometer/potentiometer, and 
temperature sensors; 
  -- Ambient conditions monitoring system; 
  -- High-resolution colour video monitor. 
  In this case of conversion of major hardware elements of 
Anthrorack into a Neurorack, which serves a different 
physiological science community, i.e. the neuro-physiology 
community, it would be desirable to extend the experimental 
opportunities on the MIR-94 and MIR-95 mission to serve the 
"traditional" Anthrorack user community in the cardiovascular, 
pulmonary and hormonal research fields. 
<H5>  3.7.7 AGHF (Advanced Gradient Heating Facility) </H5>
  This facility is a Bridgman-type furnace for crystal growth 
and directional solidification. Relatively large samples of up 
to 18 mm diameter and 300 mm length can be processed under 
well-controlled conditions of thermal stability, solidification 
rate and interface planarity. The cartridges containing the 
samples can be exchanged so that a series of samples can be 
processed. Electric pulses can be applied to the samples 
causing instantaneous growth rate variations for interface 
demarcation. To minimise microgravity disturbances, the 
cartridge remains stationary whilst the furnace is translated. 
  NASA and ESA had planned to fly and utilise the AGHF during 
the NASA USML-2 Mission in 1995. However, NASA was not allowed 
to fly AGHF on the United States-National Spacelab mission 
USML-2. 
  It is now planned to fly the AGHF on the E1 Spacelab mission 
with the same set of selected ESA and NASA experiments, as 
planned for the USML-2 mission. 
  Should the E-1 mission not be realised, a joint re-flight of 
AGHF on a NASA Spacelab mission is envisaged. NASA is very 
interested in using AGHF. 
<H5>  3.7.8 APCF (Advanced Protein Crystallisation Facility) </H5>
  This facility is designed for the growth of protein 
crystals. 
The two APCF flight units fit technically into two Shuttle 
middeck-lockers and can accommodate 96 (= 2 times 48) protein 
crystallisation reactors at closely controlled temperatures (+4 
Degrees Celsius and +20 Degrees Celsius for IML-2). APCF 
consists of two completely independent identical modules. This 
means that a one middeck-locker size APCF facility could be 
flown and operated at any desired temperature between + 4 
Celsius Degrees and some 30 Celsius Degrees. This APCF provides 
the possibility to utilise the three crystallisation methods 
favoured by the investigator community: 
  -- Free interface diffusion; 
  -- Dialysis; 
  -- Vapour equilibrium. 
  High-quality video observation and recording is available 
for 
20 reactors, which will allow the study of growth rates and 
mechanisms and determination of the size and habitus of the 
grown crystals prior to re-entry (possible damage). There also 
is a simple light-scatter nucleation-detection device, which may 
be developed into an advanced diagnostic system for crystal 
growth at a later stage. 
  APCF successfully flew for the first time on the Spacehab 1 
mission in June 1993. It will refly with two modules (two FM's) 
on the IML-2 mission in 1994, and two more flights were agreed 
with NASA in the 1994/95 time frame, in exchange for NASA's use 
of the ESA glovebox on the USML-2 mission. 
  In future, no problems of flight opportunities of the APCF 
are expected, because the facility is compatible with standard 
Shuttle middeck lockers and with Spacehab lockers. 
<H5>  3.7.9 Glovebox </H5>
  The glovebox concept was derived from the Biorack glovebox, 
an enclosed space penetrated by gloves, which isolates the 
internal content from the glovebox' environment. The glovebox 
protects the astronauts' living environment from the experiment 
and the experiments from each other. This is accomplished by a 
constantly filtered air flow and a slight underpressure with 
respect to the Spacelab cabin. Residual leaks will draw clean 
air in to be filtered rather than allow contaminated air out. 
  The Biorack glovebox was so successful that NASA requested a 
next-generation version for the USML-1 Spacelab mission, which 
flew in 1992. This new glove-box was aimed more towards 
materials/fluid science experiments. The improved technical 
capabilities included video channels for downlinking and 
on-orbit recording. 
  In return for NASA's utilisation of the glovebox on USML-1, 
the Agency already obtained the APCF flight opportunity (two 
middeck lockers) on the IML-2 mission, and will obtain two more 
flight opportunities (one middeck locker each) for APCF on 
future Shuttle flights, in return for the utilisation of 
glovebox on the USML-2 mission in 1995. NASA's life science 
office have specifically requested that ESA's glovebox fly on 
the SLS-4 mission in order to replace the originally planned 
large NASA General Purpose Work Station (a Spacelab Double 
Rack). The glovebox would permit biological sample preparation 
and handling in a safe and contained environment. In return, 
the ESA investigators selected would be offered to use NASA 
facilities during the SLS-4 mission. 
<H5>  3.8 Biobox and Biopan for Foton </H5>
  The two facilities were developed by the Agency for flight 
on 
Russian retrievable Foton type satellites. 
  Biobox is a fully automatic and programmable incubator (with 
a 1 g reference centrifuge) for research in gravitational 
biology. It flew for the first time in December 1992/January 
1993 on the Russian Bion 10 retrievable satellite mission (a 
Foton re-entry capsule). It is planned to refly Biobox in 1994 
and 1996 on cost reimbursable Foton missions. 
  The Biopan is a multi-user experiment facility intended to 
support research into the effects of cosmic radiation on 
biological sample materials. Biopan is designed to fly on 
recoverable satellites, on missions with an orbital inclination 
of 62.8 Celsius Degrees or 82.3 Celsius Degrees, and with a 
duration between two weeks and six months. Biopan will be 
mounted on the outer surface of its carrier satellite and will 
allow direct exposure of the biological samples to the hard 
vacuum and radiation environment of outer space. 
  The candidate carriers for Biopan are, in the first place, 
the operational Russian satellites of the Bion, Foton and Resurs 
type, and at a later stage the Russian Nika-T satellite, which 
will make its first flight in 1995. Different numbers of 
Biopans (between one and four) can be accommodated on these 
satellites. 
  In the frame of the ESA/RSO arrangement mentioned above, it 
is planned to perform Biopan's first operational flight at the 
end of 1993 and to refly it in 1994 and in 1996. Already in 
October 1992, a technical qualification flight of Biopan on 
Foton was successfully carried out. 
<H5>  3.9 New Payload Development for Retrievable Carriers and MIR </H5>
  It is planned to develop - after Biobox and Biopan - the 
following two fluid science facilities for flight on Foton: 
  -- Fluid Physics Facility (FPF); 
  -- Floating Zone Stability Module; 
  And it is proposed to develop two life sciences facilities 
for the MIR 1995 flight: 
  -- Breath Analyzer; 
  -- BIB-MIR Incubator. 
<H5>  3.9.1 FPF (Fluid Physics Facility) for Foton </H5>
  ESA made, in summer 1992, a detailed comparative assessment 
of the capabilities of the two fluid science facilities BDPU and 
the Liquid Structure Facility (LSF)(ESA/PB-MG(92)21). The 
background for this comparison was the strong reduction in the 
scope of Columbus Precursor missions from originally two Eureca 
reflights and two Spacelab missions (E1 and E2), to one E1 
mission with only 50 percent ESA payload, and 2 MIR missions. 
Since the ESA multi-user facilities already developed for 
Spacelab, exceed by far the accommodation capabilities of a 50 
percent E1 Spacelab, it was strongly recommended to refly either 
BDPU, or to develop the LSF and fly it on E1. The Microgravity 
Programme Board decided in September 1992, that a peer group 
examine the situation by taking into account the feasibility of 
the priority-A fluid science experiments which could either be 
performed with the BDPU, LSF, or with both facilities. 
  In short, the Peer Group reached the following conclusion: 
The development of a derivative of LSF for flight on Foton was 
justified, because three priority A experiments could not be 
performed with the capabilities provided by the BDPU. The 
Microgravity Programme Board accepted this recommendation, and 
the Executive has, in the meantime, started a Phase A/B study 
for the FPF (as a LSF derivative), which will be concluded in 
autumn 1993. It is intended to subsequently initiate the 
development phase of the FPF in order to meet a launch on Foton 
in the 1996 time frame. 
<H5>  3.9.2 Floating Zone Stability Module </H5>
  A European team of scientists (six laboratories from four 
member states) proposed to develop a new fluid science facility 
either for Foton or for Maxus, to investigate the stability of 
non-axisymmetric liquid columns. The study/development of such 
a facility would certainly obtain a high priority if no E1 
mission with the AFPM as payload was to be realised. 
<H5>  3.9.3 Breath Analyzer for MIR </H5>
  The Breath Analyzer proposed here is derived from a 
technological concept developed by a Danish company (Bruel &amp; 
Kjaer) and is based on a combination of acoustic, infrared light 
an paramagnetic measuring principles. Compared with the 
Anthrorack mass spectrometer gas analyzer, the characteristics 
of this new analyzer are compactness, low power consumption, 
high stability and no vacuum requirement. 
  The new analyzer transforms gas concentrations to 
acoustically detectable signals, and a highly sensitive 
microphone can be used as transducer for gas analysis. This 
transformation results in an alternating pressure obtained by 
applying phased energy (IR light) to the gas molecules and by 
choosing the pulsation frequency in the audible range. In the 
frame of the ESA Technological Research Programme, a breadboard 
model for space application was already built and showed similar 
resolutions, apart from CO, as the Anthrorack mass spectrometer, 
but was by a large factor smaller regarding mass, volume, and 
power. 
  Since a gas analyzer is an instrument needed for monitoring 
the astronauts' pulmonary and cardiovascular functions, but 
which is not yet aboard MIR, it was proposed to develop the 
flight model and associated support and data storage equipment 
for the Euro-MIR-95 flight. 
<H5>  3.9.4 BIB Incubator for MIR </H5>
  The call for experiments for the Columbus Precursor missions 
resulted in a large number of proposals (more than 80) in the 
field of biology. The peer group evaluation of these biological 
experiment proposals resulted in some 33 category-A proposals. 
ESA examined which of these 33 experiments could be 
accommodated in the BIB-MIR incubator, and found that it would 
be possible for some 15- 20 of these category-A experiments to 
be performed with this incubator, originally conceived for 
flight on the Russian-British MIR flight. 
<H5>  3.10 Torque Velocity Dynamometer (TVD) </H5>
  NASA invited the Agency to participate in NASA Spacelab 
Mission SLS-3. SLS.3 is a dedicated life sciences Spacelab 
mission, which will be launched in the first quarter of 1996. 
The objective of this mission is to study the effects of 
microgravity on the musculo-skeletal system in the human body. 
This mission will also encompass the CNES/NASA Rhesus Projects, 
rodent experiments and an extended-duration orbiter medical 
programme. The mission will last 16 days. 
  Although NASA had already selected its experiments related 
to 
studies in the human musculo-skeletal system, NASA had invited 
ESA to participate in this mission by developing a research 
facility, called Dynamometer, a facility for testing skeletal 
muscle performance overall and for specific research into muscle 
disuse atrophy. In return for ESA's contribution, European 
scientists were invited to participate in this mission. ESA had 
identified several experiment proposals from the Columbus 
Precursor Missions which were rated as Category A and would 
match the scientific objectives, both of the mission, and the 
potential research hardware provided by ESA. 
  In particular, ESA plans to develop, together with industry, 
the Dynamometer which can measure force, torque and velocity of 
various human limbs/joints, in an adjustable and reproducible 
way. 
  The Torque Velocity Dynamometer will be of central 
importance 
to the understanding of adaptation processes taking place in the 
skeletal muscles during the "0-g immobilisation". The 
quantification of the deconditioning in space with the help of 
the TVD is new compared to the pre- and post-mission muscle 
performance programmes carried out for the SLS-1, SLS-2 and D-2 
missions. The TVD is also useful for studying and defining 
countermeasures. 
  In order to comply with the very compressed SLS-3 schedule, 
NASA has offered to support this TVD development in the areas of 
safety aspects and Spacelab interface aspects, and to utilise a 
recently qualified NASA portable computer for control and data 
acquisition from the TVD. It is intended that the TVD hardware 
will also be technically compatible with a Shuttle Middeck 
accommodation. 
  In the medium term the TVD could also be flown on long 
missions on the planned MIR-2 Space Station, where it would be 
an interesting complement to the Breath Analyzer. During these 
long-term missions it is important to maintain sufficient muscle 
strength for the time of return to the 1g environment. 
<H5>  3.11 Neurorack </H5>
  NASA invited ESA and other space agencies to participate in 
the Neurolab Spacelab mission (SLS-4) in 1998. The SLS-4 
Neurolab mission is dedicated to studying fundamental 
neuroscience questions and to studying mechanisms responsible 
for neurological and behavioural changes that occur in space 
flight. 
  In order to evaluate the best way for ESA to participate in 
the SLS-4 mission, and in order to discuss the hardware 
requirements of the European neuroscience community, ESA has set 
up a Neurolab Science Team in February 1993. The preliminary 
recommendation of the hardware ESA should study, is a Neurorack, 
which is composed of an infrastructure similar to that of 
Anthrorack, and which would provide the following services: 
  a) A central computer service unit, a Facility Support 
Computer for: 
  -- Data acquisition and data transfer between involved 
nodes; 
  -- Communication with peripheral micro-processors/computers 
in connected or other Neurorack equipment; 
  -- Data Acquisition and power supply support of the existing 
Anthrorack Plug-in Module (PIM) and Modular Support System (MSS); 
  -- Provision of two individual displays: One stationary and 
one mobile, the latter connected to the rack by a flexible 
data/power cable. The facility Support Computer accommodates 
separate interface cards for support of specific interface 
requirements. 
  b) Automated Blood Pressure Measurement System (ABP) derived 
from Anthrorack (Finapres system); 
  c) A Remote Signal Conditioner Unit (RSCU) for support of 
EMG, EOG, ECG, EEG, dynamometer (strain gauge)/potentiometer, 
and temperature sensor; 
  d) A vestibulo-ocular interaction recording device; 
  e) Plug-in Module (PIM): For support of data 
acquisition/power/status coming from rack-external equipment. 
  f) Modular Support System (MSS): For support of fully 
integrated units, connected through the Modular Support system 
(MSS) which may provide device control, data and power support 
as well as data acquisition by the Facility Support Computer. 
  g) Video Colour Monitor (high resolution) for real-time 
display of video images and other support functions. 
  ESA intends to initiate a Phase A study of Neurorack, which 
is based on the recommendation of the Neurolab Science Team in 
the near future. This study will also cover the scenario in 
which an E1- Spacelab mission would not be funded, so that 
Anthrorack hardware elements could become available for use in 
Neurorack. This should enable to strongly increase the 
capability of Neurorack. 
<H3>  4. Programmatic Changes Introduced by the Transformation of 
the Previous MG Programme (Extended Phase 2) into the EMIR-1 
Programme </H3>
  The changes/adjustments introduced when the Extended Phase 2 
was transformed into the EMIR-1 Programme, (lasting until 1997), 
are the following: 
  a) It is assumed that no Eureca reflight will take place 
until 1997. 
  b) The EMIR-1 Programme will support the ESA MIR missions in 
1994 and 1995, as far as the utilisation of existing French, 
German and Russian experimental facilities onboard MIR are 
concerned, and in the frame of EMIR-1 a breath analyzer, an 
incubator, a freezer, a separation centrifuge, and other support 
equipment will be developed/procured and operated on MIR. 
  c) The number of payload elements to be reflown on E1 or 
equivalent missions will be increased by reflights of Biorack, 
BDPU and CPF. 
  d) New facilities will be developed for the recently offered 
NASA Spacelab missions SLS-3 and SLS-4: 
  -- A Torque Velocity Dynamometer for the SLS-3 mission which 
is planned for early 1996; 
  -- A Neurorack for the SLS-4 mission planned for early 1998. 
  e) Additional funding has been allocated to develop, for 
flight on the Russian retrievable carrier Foton, a Fluid Physics 
Facility, FPF (which is derived from the former Liquid Structure 
Facility), and a Floating Zone Stability Module (FZSM). 
  f) The funding of the Technology Support Programme will be 
reduced and the resulting "saved" amount will be used to support 
the microgravity experiments selected for the Euro-MIR 94 and 
Euro-MIR 95 missions. 
  g) Additional funding has been allocated to cover the 
mission 
and utilisation costs for retrievable carriers such as Foton. 
In particular the following flights are planned: 
  -- Biopan reflight in 1993 (September), 1994 and 1996; 
  -- Biobox reflights in 1994 and 1996; 
  -- Flights of the FPF and the FZSM in 1996; 
  -- Performance of materials sciences experiments using the 
existing Foton and MIR furnaces. 
  h) The Phase B-Studies (detached design) for the 
microgravity 
facilities for the Columbus Attached Laboratory have been 
blocked until the Columbus Programme is approved. This Phase 
B-Study is the only Columbus Programme element which remains 
within the EMIR-1 technical programme content. 
  i) The annual budget limitation of the EMIR-1 Programme 
imposed by the Granada Council Meeting at ministerial level, of 
88 MAU (1992 economic conditions), a sum which included the 
blocked amount of 25.5 percent or about 24 MAU resulting from 
the low subscription level of only 74.5 percent, has been 
introduced. This means that for EMIR-1 a net annual budget of 
about 64 MAU (1992 economic conditions) will be available, from 
which all industrial development/refurbishment expenditure, 
mission/flight costs, expenses for experts and consultants, 
scientific working groups, peer groups, test facilities, science 
teams and all ESA internal costs have to be paid. 
  The approved EMIR-1 Programme incorporates a high degree of 
flexibility, enabling it to adapt to changes in related 
programmes (i.g. Columbus Precursor Missions) and to allow for 
timely adjustment to the emergence of new scientific results, or 
scientific focusing, which might require a change in scientific 
emphases.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Dieter M. Wolf of the German Aerospace </F>
Research Institute's Central Space Systems Analysis Department: 
"The Evolutionary DSL Space Carrier Concept"; first paragraph is 
DLR-NACHRICHTEN introduction] 
  The DSL space carrier concept constitutes a promising 
component for a future space launcher family. The following 
paper sets the concept out in detail and presents the initial 
results. 
  In comparison with launch systems currently in use or under 
development, such as Ariane-4, Ariane-5, the Space Shuttle, 
etc., future space launch systems must basically be cheaper to 
launch, more reliable, safer, especially when used for manned 
missions, they must allow launches in rapid succession and on 
demand, and be environmentally acceptable. 
  Aerospace planes, a rough term for horizontal-takeoff space 
launch systems with air-breathing engines, meet many of these 
requirements. Their horizontal takeoff and air-breathing 
engines give them significant inherent safety and reliability 
advantages over conventional vertically launched systems. For 
instance, a horizontal launch may be aborted at practically any 
point in the whole launch phase, as the abort maneuvers are 
considerably less critical than with a vertical launch. 
Aerospace planes also permit a relatively high launch 
frequency, as they only require a conventional runway, not a 
special launch pad with a launching tower. 
  DSL is a two-stage space launch system with a supersonic 
carrier aircraft as its first stage and a variety of types of 
second stage. The potential range of second stages for the DSL 
stretches from conventional expendable systems, via the 
partially recoverable systems of the immediate future, to the 
fully reusable systems of the distant future, with either 
straight rocket or combined air-breathing and rocket engines. 
The DSL concept thus paves the way for the evolutionary 
development of a fully reusable space carrier family using a 
supersonic carrier aircraft that will remain more or less the 
same. This in itself holds out considerable further development 
potential, for instance in the direction of a supersonic carrier. 
<H3>  Development Characteristics of the Supersonic Carrier 
Aircraft </H3>
  The design of the DSL supersonic carrier aircraft is 
determined by the following requirements: 
  1. Avoidance of heating-up problems as in hypersonic first 
stages; 
  2. Use in principle of available aircraft technology; 
  3. The second stage to dock into a recess on the underside 
of the fuselage. 
  To meet the first design criterion, the carrier is a 
relatively simple modification of the supersonic carrier 
aircraft in current use. The operational maintenance, 
servicing, and overhaul requirement for first stages generally 
rises in proportion to the thermal stress to which they are 
exposed, or in other words, to the potential or actually 
obtainable Mach number, especially when an extra thermal 
protection system is required. For instance, hypersonic first 
stages must be inspected after every flight and the structure, 
which is exposed to high thermal stress, and thermal protection 
system must be overhauled. In the DSL concept, therefore, the 
separation Mach number is limited so as to obviate the need for 
an extra thermal protection system for the supersonic carrier 
aircraft. 
  In terms of materials and construction methods, the use in 
principle of available aircraft technology means employing 
conventional materials such as aluminum, titanium, and alloys 
thereof along with carbon fiber-reinforced plastic components 
etc. The top design separation Mach number is therefore 
determined by the maximum operative range tolerated by these 
materials. In terms of the propulsion system, available 
technology means using kerosene turbo engines. Although it is 
not state-of-the-art, the use of liquid hydrogen-burning 
turbojets is being analyzed in parallel, with a view to 
evaluating and assessing the impact of this technology on the 
overall system. Both these propulsion concepts allow for an 
optional extra rocket engine, as this can facilitate 
acceleration to separation Mach number and have a positive 
effect on the overall mass of the carrier aircraft. No 
aerodynamic support is required as a result of having the second 
stage dock into a recess on the underside of the supersonic 
carrier aircraft. Moreover, it gives the DSL concept 
flexibility as to the type, size, and mass of the second stage. 
<H5>  Potential Types of Second Stage </H5>
  The range of potential types of second stage is as follows: 
  -- Conventional expendable stages for carrying payloads 
(e.g., similar to the Ariane-5 central stage with payload 
cladding), which could be replaced at a later stage of 
development by a reusable propulsion and avionics module. 
Instead of a payload, various smaller systems can be carried in 
this stage, for example: 
  a) capsules (including supply module); 
  b) winged systems for personnel transport (such as Hermes or 
the PLS personnel launch system); 
  c) logistics vehicles (such as the ATV automated transfer 
vehicle); 
  d) demonstrator vehicles (for demonstrating "tail on" or 
"head on" reentry and vertical landing on Earth, for example); 
  -- Reusable winged systems with rocket propulsion, both 
conventional-design systems and CCV (control configured vehicle) 
systems or lifting bodies being conceivable; all these concepts 
can be either manned or unmanned; 
  -- Reusable systems with air-breathing propulsion, of the 
ramjet or scramjet type, for instance, both manned and unmanned 
versions being conceivable. 
  In particular, the supersonic carrier aircraft can be used 
to 
carry experimental ramjet and scramjet aircraft. The supersonic 
carrier aircraft can also be used to launch smaller multistage 
systems such as Pegasus or a hypothetical "supersonic Pegasus." 
<H5>  Separation Mach Number Ranges </H5>
  The first two design criteria for the supersonic carrier 
aircraft give a top separation speed in the Mach 3-3.5 (Mach 4) 
range. As the separation Mach number should be as high as 
possible with rocket-propelled second stages so as to achieve a 
high payload-mass ratio, these systems are basically separated 
from the carrier at the top sustainable or obtainable Mach 
number. With second stages with air-breathing (ramjet or 
scramjet) engines, on the other hand, the separation Mach number 
is in the Mach 1.5-2.5 range so as to exploit the full potential 
of air-breathing propulsion. As a result, the DSL concept has 
two potential separation Mach number ranges, one from Mach 1.5 
to 2.5 and the other from about Mach 3 to 3.5 (Mach 4). 
<H5>  Implementation Stages and Potential Spin-Offs </H5>
  In order to limit the development risk and, consequently, 
keep development costs as low as possible, the first generation 
of the supersonic carrier aircraft will in all probability use 
kerosene turbojets. The shorter the development timeframe 
available, i.e., the earlier the system is scheduled to enter 
service (for instance, as the successor to Ariane-5), the 
likelier this is. The second generation of the supersonic 
carrier could then use liquid hydrogen- burning turbojets, which 
would comply with the main first generation design criteria, 
i.e., basically, a maximum separation speed in roughly the Mach 
3.5 range. However, it cannot be ruled out that, for example, 
the first generation of the supersonic carrier aircraft might 
already use liquid hydrogen-burning turbojets for ecological 
reasons or with a view to creating spin-offs for aviation. 
  In order to avoid a high development risk in connection with 
the second stage as well, conventional expendable systems can 
initially be developed. As explained in detail above, the 
further development potential of small reusable systems for 
carriage with the expendable stages in place of a payload 
extends right up to air-breathing second stages, and various 
second stages or types of second stage can be run in parallel. 
  The various types of second stage, however, reflect various 
levels of progress, primarily in the structural and propulsion 
technologies. Merely building them thus constitutes an 
evolutionary development. The DSL space carrier concept with 
the supersonic carrier aircraft and the expendable second stage 
thus represents the true beginning of an evolutionary 
development toward a fully reusable space carrier family. 
  As far as materials and construction methods are concerned, 
experience with earlier systems, such as the central stage of 
Ariane-5, can contribute to the development of the expendable 
second stage. As will become apparent below, the rational 
solution for this type of second stage is a rocket engine with 
characteristic parameters such as mixture ratio and specific 
impulse similar to those of the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) 
or the RD-0120 Energiya central stage engine. 
  The development of the small reusable manned carrier will be 
able to benefit from know-how and experience acquired to date 
from the Hermes and Hermes Technology programs, although there 
is an enormous development requirement here with regard to 
materials and construction methods, thermal protection systems 
included. 
  The evolutionary development of the fully reusable types of 
second stage is expected to produce spin-offs in materials and 
construction methods from the small carrier for the type of 
reusable second stage with rocket propulsion, and from this 
system for the type of second stage with air-breathing 
propulsion. Nevertheless, they all present a considerable 
development requirement. As far as the propulsion system is 
concerned, the rocket-driven type of second stage benefits from 
engine development for the expendable system, especially if a 
reusable propulsion and avionics module for the expendable 
system is developed in the course of time. Nevertheless, a new 
engine type for this type of second stage could bring 
advantages. Compared with the current state of the art, the 
type of second stage with air-breathing propulsion requires 
considerable development work on the propulsion, including 
engine-fuselage integration. The development of the 
air-breathing propulsion can benefit from the experience, 
know-how, and developments provided by the German hypersonic 
technology program and the French Prepha program, and further 
know-how in this area might be acquired from the CIS states. 
  In one potential development building on the supersonic 
carrier aircraft, the separation speed will be substantially 
higher than Mach 3.5, for instance Mach 5. The advances 
expected by then in materials and construction methods, in 
particular with regard to hot bearing structures, should make it 
possible to retain most of the advantages of the supersonic 
carrier aircraft. Basically, this means avoiding an extra 
thermal protection system. Various propulsion concepts are 
conceivable for this carrier aircraft, for instance liquid 
hydrogen-burning turbojets plus rocket engines or liquid 
hydrogen-burning turboramjets. Spin-offs from the air-breathing 
second stage type are to be expected in the latter case. 
  Basically, only reusable rocket-driven systems are being 
considered as potential second stage types for this generation 
of the carrier aircraft, expendable systems not being ruled out 
for carrying heavy payloads. As the higher separation speed 
gives second stages with air-breathing propulsion no advantage, 
there is no point in developing a second generation of these 
systems. 
  The DSL concept is expected to produce further spin-offs in 
several areas. Firstly, the supersonic carrier aircraft could 
result in spin-offs for aviation, primarily with regard to 
turbojets and materials and construction methods. 
  The development of aerospace planes, which is conceivable in 
the distant future, could exploit the technologies of both the 
supersonic carrier aircraft and the various types of second 
stage. The main impact of spin-offs from the supersonic carrier 
aircraft would be on propulsion systems (LH2 turbojets, possibly 
LH2 turboramjets), whereas those to be expected from the various 
types of second stage would mainly affect materials and 
construction methods and air-breathing propulsion. 
Nevertheless, single-stage aerospace planes still require 
considerable development work on materials and construction 
methods and on the propulsion system. 
  In addition to the aforementioned spin-offs for aviation 
and/or for the single-stage aerospace planes of the distant 
future, the DSL concept holds out unique opportunities for an 
international space carrier system. For example, the supersonic 
carrier aircraft could be developed as an international or world 
program. However single countries with their own space programs 
could pursue the development independently of one another. The 
second stages can also be developed by single countries with 
their own space programs according to their specific needs and 
their level of technological progress. 
<H5>  Initial Results </H5>
  Initial studies on the DSL space carrier concept were 
carried 
out at a separation speed of Mach 3.5. In order not to exceed a 
pad weight of about 500 Mg [myriagrams] for the overall system, 
the pad weight of the second stages immediately after separation 
from the carrier aircraft was set at 200 Mg for the purposes of 
the studies. 
  In addition to analyses for an expendable second stage, the 
same calculations were also performed for a reusable second 
stage with rocket propulsion. Both Vulcain-derived and 
SSME-derived engines were used as the propulsion for both types 
of second stage. The resulting payload weights for a 400-km 
orbit are set out in figure 5. The SSME derivates gave the 
expendable second stage a payload capacity of just under 19 Mg 
and the reusable second stage one of approximately 8.5 Mg. The 
propulsion concept considerably affects payload capacity. Using 
Vulcain derivatives reduced the payload capacity by about 5 Mg 
in the expendable second stage and by about 3.5 Mg in the 
reusable system. 
  Initial analyses for the supersonic carrier aircraft gave a 
pad weight of around 300 Mg: about 200 Mg empty weight plus 100 
Mg fuel. The carrier aircraft is propelled by a total of eight 
scaled Olympus engines with an overall installed ground thrust 
of about 2,860 kN [kilonewtons]. The vehicle is about 70 m long 
and has a wingspan of approximately 50 m. 
  The payload capacity of the reusable second stage propelled 
by SSME-derived engines is about 1.6 percent of the pad weight 
of the entire system. This payload ratio is only marginally 
worse than in the Saenger with an unmanned upper stage but is 
achieved with a first stage of substantially more conventional 
technology. Using liquid hydrogen-burning turbojets in the 
carrier aircraft raises the payload ratio, which ought even to 
exceed that of the Saenger. Not least in the light of these 
results, the DSL concept constitutes a promising version of a 
future space carrier system or family and merits further, more 
detailed studies with regard to both concept verification and 
potential spin-offs.

  [Text] The Joint Chiefs of Staff committee has recently 
assigned the Air Force the management of space programs 
currently being developed within the framework of the Ministry 
of Defense Military Space Plan. This was confirmed by Air Force 
Chief of Staff Gen. Adelchi Pillinini at a meeting with 
journalists from UGAI (Italian Aerospace Journalists 
Association), who also stressed that "all three branches of the 
armed forces will be involved in the development of space 
programs" and that the above mentioned committee has assigned 
the Air Force in particular with "the management of the SICRAL 
(Italian Satellite for Confidential and Warning Communications) 
and Helios programs." SICRAL is a national satellite for 
government communications and Helios, which is currently under 
development as part of a cooperation accord among France, Italy, 
and Spain, will be used for strategic observation. 
  As for SICRAL, it has been made known that COSTARMAEREO 
(Ministry of Defense Headquarters for Aeronautical and Space 
Construction) should issue the RFP (Request for Proposal) for 
the satellite's development in early 1994 and that this should 
be followed by the signing of a contract with Alenia Spazio. 
The overall cost of the program is estimated at 500-550 billion 
lire and includes the construction of a single satellite, its 
launching into orbit (probably using the European Ariane-4 
launcher) and the TT&amp;C (Remote Control, Telemetry, and 
Control) 
ground station. The SICRAL launch is expected to take place by 
1997. 
  A Space Activities Office divided into two sections, Space 
Policy and Space Programs, was recently established within the 
4th Division of the Air Force Chief of Staff and will be 
directed by Col. Giuliano Giannone to better carry out the 
mandate on the management of defense space programs.

  [Text] It appears that some good news about the 
development of the new VEGA (European Advanced Generation 
Carrier, an original acronym that reveals the international 
ambitions of the program) Italian launcher project, has reached 
the management of BPD Difesa e Spazio (Gilardini/Fiat group) 
during these last weeks of 1993. In fact VEGA uses technologies 
that have been perfected by BPD for other national and European 
projects (these being the boosters for the Ariane launchers, the 
Zefiro propulsor and the perigee engine IRIS [Italian Research 
Interim Stage]) and uses the same philosophy as the San Marco 
Scout launcher, designed some years ago by Prof. Luigi Broglio 
of La Sapienza University in Rome. 
  The first piece of good news came from the Italian Space 
Agency (ASI). ASI Commissioner Prof. Giampietro Puppi appears 
to have signed a contract valued at about 10 billion lire that 
would allow BPD and the other subcontracting companies, 
Contraves Italiana and Riva Calzoni, to acquire the necessary 
sophisticated technologies for the development of the new 
launcher. Secondly, another go-ahead for the VEGA, that is no 
less important, seems to have come from the commission of 
experts nominated last summer by University and Scientific 
Research Minister Prof. Umberto Colombo to definitively settle 
the question of the realization of a national light launcher and 
what has become the violent contraposition of the two programs 
that have been launched by the ASI in this sector. On one hand 
there is the San Marco Scout, proposed by Rome University, using 
mainly technologies and subsystems that have been produced by 
the U.S. company LVS, and on the other hand there is the VEGA, 
that initially started as a progressive industrialization and 
Italianization of the San Marco Scout, but that has slowly 
acquired its own form, proposing itself as a valid alternative. 
The commission of experts, presided over by Dr. Sergio 
Ristuccia, a magistrate from the State Audit Court, has recently 
ended its work and delivered its conclusions to Minister 
Colombo. According to some indiscretions, the Ristuccia 
commission has expressed a negative evaluation of the San Marco 
Scout project, mainly because this carrier would use 
technologies that are now obsolete, and because the public 
funding that would be necessary to update it would largely be 
spent in the United States, without a valid economic and 
technological return for our country. Vice versa, the report of 
the commission would have expressed a favorable opinion on the 
development in Italy of an industrial project (this being the 
VEGA). It also confirms that there are real market 
possibilities for a light launcher able to launch small 
scientific, applications, and commercial satellites, weighing 
between about 400 and 1,000 kilograms, into low orbits. 
According to some estimates, the current BPD project, which has 
been derived directly from the so-called "F configuration" of a 
study of an optimized national launcher, that was put forward by 
the ASI would have global development costs of about 400 billion 
lire. The most important market opportunity for the VEGA, apart 
from the eventual launching of small scientific satellites for 
the ASI, such as the CESAR [Central European Satellite for 
Advanced Research], would today seem to be flights to put the 
Iridium satellites, developed by the U.S. Motorola company for 
the Motorola global personal communications system, into orbit. 
This business involves between two and four launches each year 
for at least 10 years. The VEGA, which could be sold at about 
$14 million, should be the ideal candidate. This depends on 
whether Italy, the ASI, and BPD quickly manage to demonstrate 
(some say before 1996) that they possess an effective and 
reliable launching system and that they do not just have one of 
the many "dreams in the drawer."

  [Text] The European Transonic Wind Tunnel (ETW) will 
considerably enhance the competitiveness of the German and 
European aviation industries. After five years in the building, 
close to the German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) in 
Cologne-Porz, the wind tunnel has now been officially opened by 
Federal Research Minister Dr. Paul Krueger and will be fully at 
the disposal of the aviation industry and aerospace research for 
aerodynamic tests on future aircraft configurations from 
mid-1994 onwards. 
  The wind tunnel represents a decided breakthrough in 
aviation 
test engineering in Europe, as it explores new ground in 
operational and test technology. The operating concept is based 
on what is known as the cryogenic principle, whereby the high 
Reynolds numbers typical of the transonic range are achieved not 
by using large aircraft models, as was previously the case, but 
by injecting liquid nitrogen to obtain a drastic reduction in 
the temperature of the flow medium, to as low as minus 180 
degrees Celsius. 
  This entails a number of advantages: The wind tunnel itself 
can be significantly smaller, and this in turn makes for 
considerably lower plant costs. Operating costs are also 
substantially lower than those of comparable conventional plants. 
  Present-generation passenger aircraft and those of the 
coming 
decades mostly fly at just under the speed of sound. This gives 
rise to locally occurring supersonic fields with vibrating 
compression shocks on the upper sides of airfoils. This can 
lead to flutter phenomena on the airfoils and result in flight 
characterized by irregular shuddering. In the near-supersonic 
range, design and fluidic measures that prevent or attenuate 
these compression shocks also achieve a marked reduction in 
aerodynamic drag and, consequently, make for considerable fuel 
savings. 
  With the ETW, engineers are acquiring an ultramodern tool 
that will enable them to determine the final configuration of a 
new aircraft from model measurements much more accurately then 
before, thus obviating the need for expensive modifications in 
the light of subsequent flight testing. 
  The four states involved are sharing the 660-million German 
mark building costs as follows: United Kingdom and France 28 
percent each, the Netherlands 6 percent, the BMFT [Federal 
Ministry of Research and Technology] 27 percent, the Land of 
North Rhine-Westphalia 10 percent, and the German aviation 
industry one percent -- a further step in the direction of 
European integration in aeronautical research and development.

  [Text] Kourou--Europe's 59th Ariane rocket was scheduled to 
make a one-shot launch of seven satellites during the night of 
24-25 September, between 0127 and 0145 hours UT. One of them was 
the SPOT 3, France's third Earth observation satellite. Its 
siblings were launched in 1986 and 1990, and served in the Gulf 
War in addition to performing their overwhelmingly civilian 
duties. 
  Arianespace decided to employ the least powerful of its 
models, the Ariane-40, for the flight. Though it has no strap-on 
booster, the 40 is still more than sufficient for the job. 
  The multiple launch has nothing in common with the volley 
firings (eight satellites at once) of Russia's Proton rockets. 
The 31st Ariane-4 is being asked to place into polar orbit at 
820 km above the earth total payload of 2,357 kg, including 
2,118 kg that make up the total weight of the 7 satellites. 
  SPOT 3 alone weighs 1,907 kg at launch, while its seven 
traveling companions weigh between 12 and 90 kg. The heaviest of 
them, STELLA, a National Center for Space Studies (CNES) space 
geodesy satellite, will circle the Earth for 2,000 years as part 
of the world laser satellite network to study global 
deformations. It will be France's second contribution to the 
project since Starlette in 1975. 
  Ariane's 59th flight has essentially been set aside for 
SPOT-3, and will thus insure the continuity of Earth observation 
using the SPOT pictures that are marketed by Spot Image and its 
international subsidiaries. Presently the world leader in remote 
sensing, ahead of the Americans, Spot Image must defend its 
hard-won position against growing competition from American, 
Russian, and--soon--Japanese firms. 
  Besides the obvious military uses (surveillance, spying, 
tactical tracking, and strategic preparation), Earth observation 
has other, civilian and scientific purposes. SPOT has uncovered 
previously unknown faults in the Himalayas, facilitated the 
drawing of accurate relief maps, detected new mineral resources, 
and evaluated harvests and crop and forest diseases. Oil 
companies employ Spot documents (detection, exploration), which 
are also used to monitor ocean pollution, study urban centers 
and archeological sites, and so on. 
  Spot images are not photos taken at an altitude of 800 km. 
They are a succession of computer data that are recorded aboard 
the satellite and sent to earth stations. The Toulouse 
processing center extracts, at customer request, the desired 
marrow. Whether displayed in true or false colors, the 
magnificent images recreated by SPOT are like so many abstract 
paintings showing atolls, sebkhras (salt-water swamps), volcanic 
cones--and even the Eiffel Tower's shadow on the Champ de Mars, 
the cargo boats in front of the Statue of Liberty, Chernobyl's 
smoke plume, or burned Kuwaiti oil wells. French armed forces 
are using Spot technology to develop the future military 
satellite Helios in conjunction with Matra and the French space 
agency. 
  SPOT 3 is identical to its predecessors and will be followed 
in 1997 (perhaps sooner) by SPOT 4, and in 2000 by SPOT 5. The 
4th and 5th versions of the satellite are expected to have an 
orbital life exceeding the current three years, and resolution 
of less than 10 meters. They will be equipped with infrared 
radiation detectors, and will be able to shoot one region from 
two different angles while traveling the same orbit. 
  It had become urgent to launch SPOT 3. Although still alive 
and kicking despite its launch date of 22 February, 1986, SPOT 1 
has no recorder at this point. And the recording equipment of 
SPOT 2, which was launched 22 January, 1990, is also showing 
signs of fatigue. 
<H5>  SPOT 3's Five Microsatellite Companions </H5>
  The five microsatellites that will be making the trip with 
SPOT 3 are American, Portuguese, Korean, and Italian. They weigh 
from 12 to 50 kg, and will all be placed into polar orbit at an 
altitude of 800 km. 
  The launch costs of microsatellites are minimal since they 
are launched with big ones, and the smaller satellites are 
considered one of the best ways to test new, often complex 
techniques being developed in university research centers and 
laboratories. Microsatellites are playing an increasingly 
important role in preparing the technologies of tomorrow. 
  The 12-kg Italian satellite ITAMSAT is being sent up by the 
Associazione Radioamatori Italiani to exchange the messages of 
its radiohams with the rest of the world. It was built by the 
American firm Interferometrics. EYESAT-A, 12.5 kg, is an 
experimental satellite for the location and monitoring of 
industrial equipment, to provide information about the equipment 
to its manufacturers. The first should operate for between seven 
and ten years, and the second from five to seven years. 
  The other three fall into the 50-kg weight class and employ 
the same platform design, which was devised by Surrey Satellite 
Technology Ltd. SSTL is a subsidiary of Britain's Surrey 
University, one of the world's leaders for this type of 
microsatellite. 
  The chief aim of the Portugeuse satellite POSAT-1 is to 
stimulate and train Portugal's space applications industry. It 
will receive and transmit images and messages using signal 
compression. The microsatellite will establish its position with 
the help of the American Global Positioning System (GPS), and 
will measure the radiation it receives and the effects of that 
radiation during its five years in orbit. 
  HEALTHSAT-1, sponsored by SateLife (United States), is 
humanitarian in purpose, and will supply information to medical 
schools and universities, hospitals, and health documentation 
centers in Africa. 
  Finally, Korea's KITSAT-B will conduct telecommunications 
experiments designed to round out those of its sibling, 
KITSAT-A, which Ariane has already launched. Integrated and 
tested in South Korea by SaTReC (Satellite Technology Research 
Center), the microsatellite will capture and process digital 
images, implement--also for five years--signal compression 
techniques, and receive, store, and transmit messages. 
<H5>  STELLA, France's New Space Geodesy Satellite </H5>
  STELLA is the National Center for Space Studies' second 
contribution to the world network of laser satellites that are 
vital to space geodesy research. It consists of a 
uranium-238-alloy ball measuring 240 mm in diameter and covered 
with a skin bearing 60 reflectors. STELLA will serve until 2000 
as a target for the lasers of world specialists who are studying 
the deformations of the Earth's globe, the force of the Earth's 
gravity field, and the variations in that force over time and 
space. 
  Like Starlette, France's first geodesy satellite launched in 
1975, STELLA will enable scientists to measure ocean, ground, or 
atmospheric tides, the movement of tectonic plates, and the 
consequences of the variations in polar glacial masses for 
several decades. It will also add to their knowledge and 
understanding of convection motion inside the earth's mantle and 
offer new data for research into the Earth-Moon system. 
  STELLA will be joining a constellation of laser-target 
satellites that travel orbits of varying altitudes and 
inclinations. Exact knowledge of their position is vital to 
gradually refining measurements and thus establishing the 
respective positions of the stations that "take aim" at the 
satellites. 
  Roughly the size of a soccer ball, STELLA will circle the 
globe at an altitude of 800 km and a speed of 28,000 km/hr, 
along an orbit inclined 98 degrees. That gives you some idea of 
the crack marksmanship skills of the laser stations. 
Fortunately, the stations possess projected arrival times and 
astronomical tables, and their firing turrets are trained by 
computer. 
  Several French teams under the umbrella of the Space Geodesy 
Research Group (GRGS) are coordinating the reception--notably at 
the Grasse station--and processing of the data obtained. In 
Europe, an organization called Eurolas is centralizing and 
distributing the raw data, organizing measurement campaigns, and 
putting together the astromical tables.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Jacquier: "Airbus Poises for the </F>
Recovery"; first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction] 
  [Text] The A330 is the keystone of the European aircraft 
maker's strategy. When the recovery kicks in, the new airplane 
should lure airlines, which will be introduced to the A321 in 
1994, and the A319 in 1996. 
  A stitch in time saves nine. That piece of advice from good, 
old Jean de La Fontaine is still giving Airbus Industrie 
managers headaches. 
  While the airliner market plunges to new depths, the 
European 
consortium--indifferent to the economic downturn--is stepping up 
the number of its product launches. In fact, it is sending up so 
many new airplanes that the whole thing looks like a fireworks 
show. Airbus's A340 quadrijet went into service last February, 
while its twin, the A330 twinjet, is beginning its final phase 
of certification testing now. If everything goes as planned, the 
first A330 should join the fleet of Air Inter, which ordered 15 
of them, in December. However, the airline might postpone 
delivery of the last 10, depending on how the economy looks. 
  There is more. A month later, in January, 1994, Airbus will 
add a new member to its family with the A321, the new stretch 
version of the bestselling A320, assembled in Hamburg, Germany. 
It will be joined later by the A319, the small 130-seater whose 
1996 birth was announced at the last Bourget Show. That makes 
four new programs in the space of four years, or almost one a 
year. Does Airbus think it is a car manufacturer? 
  Most important is the question of how the European aircraft 
manufacturer plans to amortize the nearly Fr4.5 billion it has 
invested in these developments. Its sales are at their lowest 
level ever (see table). Since 1 January 1993, 58 Airbus orders 
have been canceled, against only 27 new orders written. That is 
a negative balance of 31 planes. And manufacturing plants are 
slashing thousands of jobs: 3,000 at Germany's Deutsche 
Aerospace, and 1,600 at Aerospatiale's airplanes division in 
France. 
  The truth is, Airbus had little choice. Most of its new 
planes were launched before the recession. The decision to go 
ahead with the most expensive of the programs, the dual 
A330-A340 project ($3.6 billion in development costs), was made 
in 1987, three years before the slump began. The most recent 
arrival, the A319, is an exception, and meets a pressing market 
demand for small planes to serve airline "hubs" and regional 
routes. Moreover, as a derived model, the 319's development 
costs are a modest $250 million. The challenge in the 
aeronautics industry is to make very long cycles to coincide 
with the abrupt turnarounds in the travel market. It takes five 
or six years to bring a new program to fruition, once the 
decision to launch it is made. And engineers design the new 
aircraft to last 20 years. That means manufacturers always base 
their strategies on long-term trends. The important thing is to 
constantly stay ahead of competitors, for technological 
innovation is what ultimately pays off. 
  Innovation is what has enabled Airbus, which started from 
scratch less than 20 years ago, to challenge Boeing by capturing 
30 percent of the world market. Its first move was to invent the 
concept of a large-fuselage, short-haul carrier (the A300). 
Later it gambled on automated cockpits with the A320. But to 
confirm its penetration of the Seattle giant's market, Airbus 
still needed a complete family of airplanes. With its four new 
programs, it now has one. Even in the midst of a recession, say 
officials in Toulouse, a complete line "will limit the damage 
and help sell older models, inasmuch as airlines prefer 
homogeneous fleets, to save money." The A330 will probably not 
lift Airbus out of the current doldrums. Its sales have topped 
out at 127 firm orders since the beginning of the year. On the 
other hand, Airbus managers are convinced that the airplane and 
its siblings are vital to the consortium's "rebound" once the 
recovery kicks in. 
  According to the two major launch airlines, Air Inter and 
Malaysia Airlines, the A330 is certainly not without assets. It 
is the world's biggest twinjet, designed to serve both as a 
high-density (440 passengers) short-haul carrier and a long-haul 
plane (up to 6,000 km). This makes it extremely flexible to use. 
The A330 is even more fuel-efficient than any rival to date. It 
does not consume any more kerosene than the first A300s, and can 
carry 30 percent more. Outfitted with the same equipment as the 
A320, 321 and 340, the A330 offers fantastic productivity gains, 
notably in maintenance and crew training. The same simulators 
mean the same procedures: A pilot can easily shift from one to 
the other in a few days time. It is easy to imagine how 
interested airlines are. "The A330 is a recession airplane," 
claims Air Inter, which will be able to use it to prepare for a 
price war in Europe. The domestic carrier plans to employ the 
A330 on its most-traveled routes, i.e. Paris-Marseille, 
Toulouse, Nice, Strasbourg, and Montpellier. It will gain about 
18 percent on operating costs per seat. 
  Meanwhile, the A340 quadrijet has acquired the nickname 
"World Ranger" since it captured the record for the world's 
longest flight this summer in a 19,000-km trek from Bourget to 
Auckland, New Zealand. The A330, together with its A340 twin, is 
probably Airbus's best weapon for the coming years, provided 
that traffic continues to pick up and transporters' finances 
improve. Both Toulouse and Seattle believe they will. After long 
claiming that there was no market for an A330-A340 type 
airplane, Boeing is trying to counter the new threat from Europe 
with its 777 family. It is running two years behind. Only the 
future will tell which company took its stitch in time.

<F P=106> [Article by Tanguy Hugoo: "Prodem Introduces Superplastic </F>
Forming of Pipes"; introductory paragraph in boldface as 
published] 
  [Text] The process has many advantages. A savings in 
time (one hour to do a job that used to take 25 hours), a 
25-percent reduction in cost, and quality close to that of the 
finished product. 
  The superplastic forming of titanium sheets is well known, 
especially in the fields of aeronautics, aerospace, and 
armament. Now the same technology is being applied to the 
production of pipes in complex conical shapes with chimneys and 
connectors. And all in one operation! Prodem (turnover of 20 
million francs, 50 employees), a subsidiary of Bonnans, Inc., is 
the company rushing into the breach opened by Aerospatiale and 
press manufacturer ABC. The young Toulouse firm has just filled 
the slot and is marketing titanium hot-air pipework for the 
Airbus A330 and A340. A result of research conducted by 
Aerospatiale, pipe forming consists of "inflating" an airtight 
titanium pipe. One end of the pipe is blocked shut, after which 
a nozzle is attached to the other end to inject argon with a 
pressure of about 10 bars. Upon being heated to a temperature of 
900 degrees C., the alloy of superplastic titanium (enriched 
with six percent aluminum and four percent vanadium) expands as 
much as 600 percent in the press, hence its name "superplastic." 
The pipe expands to fit the mold in which it has been placed. 
The resulting surface smoothness and quality are close to that 
of the finished product. So much so that the forming process 
eliminates the traditional machining and welding operations--as 
well as the string of inspections accompanying them. As a 
result, the metallic structure of the titanium does not undergo 
change. 
  Another advantage is that "a piece can be completed in less 
than an hour. Compared to traditional boilerwork, which would 
require 25 hours," explains Yves Marcel, a development engineer 
at Prodem. The result in the case of short runs is to make the 
cost of a piece 25 percent less than it would be in traditional 
boilermaking. Despite that, the "entry ticket" remains high: 
about 150,000 francs for a mold of refractory steel. In 
addition, the price of titanium--over 300 francs per 
kilogram--does not make the development of applications easy. As 
regards the Prodem shop's production capacity, it is limited, 
the reason being that "one must allow from 10 to 12 hours for 
heating the press to 900 degrees C. And during the rest of the 
day, one can form about 10 pieces," says Marcel. That rules out 
any mass production. The consequence is that unlike superplastic 
aluminum, forming titanium pipe remains limited to the aerospace 
industry. Despite everything, Prodem is confident that Russian 
titanium will soon arrive on the market. Since the Russian 
product costs 30 percent less than titanium from the United 
States, which currently has a monopoly, it may be that the 
process will spread to other industrial sectors.

<F P=106> [Article by Heinrich Hemker under the rubric "Technology </F>
Journal": "BRITE-EURAM Project in the Wind Tunnel. Integration 
Problem for Super Jumbo Engines"; first paragraph is an 
introduction] 
  [Text] The fan's diameter can be increased in order to 
lower the fuel consumption of today's turbofan engines. However, 
it will be ever more difficult to integrate the larger engines 
into the aircraft. Now this problem has been studied in the wind 
tunnel. 
  Today's passenger airplanes are propelled by turbofan 
engines. Unlike jet engines that work with just one region--the 
combustion region, in such a two-region engine an additional 
turbine drives a fan. This has exclusively the task of 
accelerating ambient air to the rear and thus of providing 
additional thrust. Therefore, the bypass ratio (BPR) is an 
important characteristic for rating these engines. It gives the 
ratio of the air mass flow rate in the outside fan region to the 
air mass flow rate of the inside hot region. The engines used 
today work for the most part with a bypass ratio of between four 
and six. 
  The principle of conservation of momentum of physics is used 
in order to calculate an engine's thrust. As applied to a 
turbofan, it means: The thrust is equal to the moving air mass 
flow rate times the change in velocity between the inlet and 
outlet planes of the engine. From this one can construe that 
increasing the air mass flow rate makes it possible to reduce 
the velocity difference with the same thrust. This has the 
direct result that the requisite fuel consumption and 
accordingly the emission of pollutants too are reduced 
substantially. A reduction in consumption of 10 to 15 percent is 
achievable in practice. Thus, in increasing the air mass flow 
rate in turbofan engines there is considerable potential for 
building more environmentally compatible engines. 
  If this principle is embodied, one arrives at so-called 
very-high or, as the case may be, ultrahigh bypass (UHB) 
engines. But a higher bypass ratio also means that the engine's 
outside diameter increases as compared with that of today's 
turbofans. This is their disadvantage. Because of the larger 
dimensions, the problem of the interaction of the airframe and 
engine becomes still more important, because the aerodynamic 
interference brought about grows strongly in significance. On 
that account, in order for the possible consumption advantages 
not to be reduced because of the increasing drag of the overall 
configuration of the airplane, it is necessary to provide, at 
the preliminary stage of the development of new aircraft--super 
jumbos, for example--the theoretical and experimental tools for 
dealing with the integration problem. 
  The "Ducted Propfan Investigation" (DUPRIN) assignment has 
been taken up as part of the European Community's BRITE/EURAM 
subsidy program, in view of the importance of this problem. 
Under the lead management of Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, 14 
European partners from industry, research and higher education 
are working on supporting, through research on the integration 
problem, the development of engines having a higher bypass 
ratio. The DUPRIN team has managed a first step via wind tunnel 
measurements in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel (DNW). Important 
results for the UHB-engine integration problem have been able to 
be obtained by the first successful employment of UHB simulators 
with a contrarotating fan. Measurements in the same wind tunnel 
model with conventional turbofan simulators had already preceded 
these studies. The wind tunnel model and simulators were made 
true to scale. 
  According to Heinz Hoheisel of DLR [German Research 
Institute 
for Aerospace] in Braunschweig, the development of the UHB 
simulators was a particular problem. A compressed-air-driven 
four-stage turbine having an output of 162 kW drives via a 
reversing gear an eight-blade contrarotating fan having a 
diameter of 254 millimeters. The prototype of the new engine 
simulator, designated CRUF, is based on the MTU-CRISP [Motoren- 
und Turbinen-Union GmbH [Engine and Turbine Union Limited 
Liability Company] Counter Rotating Integrated Shrouded Propfan] 
design and was developed by DLR in Braunschweig together with 
Dynamic Engineering, Inc. of Virginia, USA. A second simulator 
was developed and built by the Technofan company in Toulouse, 
France, on the same basis within the framework of the DUPRIN 
assignment. 
<H5>  Encouraging Test Results </H5>
  In contrast to conventional turbofan engines, whose optimal 
position on a passenger aircraft's wing is known, an expectedly 
favorable position has to be found first for the new engine 
design. The capabilities of computer simulation, for one thing, 
are helpful for this. The flow pattern around the wing and 
engine can be assessed by means of its evidence. The drag 
behavior is of quite special importance in the integration 
problem for new engines having an increased bypass ratio, 
because the installation drag must not be greater than for 
conventional turbofans. The first measurements for the complete 
model were made for this purpose in the German-Dutch Wind 
Tunnel. The important aerodynamic forces--lift and drag--were 
determined by means of a new weighing machine incorporated into 
the wind tunnel model. In addition, pressure measurements were 
made at a total of about 800 pressure points on the surfaces of 
the fuselage, wing and engine cowling, in order to be able to 
assess more precisely the flow behavior. This measuring 
equipment had to be accommodated in the wind tunnel model, in 
addition to the air, oil and coolant supplies for the engine 
simulators. 
  The test results gotten in the measurement rounds have 
encouraged the researchers. Additional assignments, designated 
in the DUPRIN program, on the integration problem for UHB 
engines are to begin now in the near future.

<F P=106> [Article by Norbert Burgner under the rubric "Aerospace </F>
Journal": "Route Tests Successfully Concluded. Airbus 330 Flies 
More Economically Than Expected"; first paragraph is an 
introduction] 
  [Text] Testing of the efficiency and reliability of the new 
Airbus 330 in daily scheduled use was the focus of the route 
tests that the European consortium conducted in cooperation with 
Malaysia Airlines and Air Inter. 
  The first phase of the so-called route tests as the 
concluding part of the certification program for the new Airbus 
Wide-Body Twin A330 began at the end of August in Kuala Lumpur 
in conjunction with the Asian first customer, Malaysia Airlines. 
By 6 September the aircraft had passed in a total of 30 flights 
just under 103 flying hours on the Asian airline's domestic and 
international route network. In addition, in more than 40,000 
nautical miles (74,000 km) to Perth in Australia, Johannesburg, 
Tokyo, Kuching, Bangkok or Hong Kong, the Airbus offspring 
achieved 100 percent reliability, according to the company's 
data. 
  The second phase from 14 to 17 September with the 
short-route 
test on the routes of French launching customer Air Inter was 
just as successful. Equipped in a single-class configuration 
with a seating capacity of 412, the maxi-twin's so-called 
high-density/high-frequency qualities above all were challenged 
here. Its ground handling characteristics--from docking at the 
gate and the passengers getting off, to new passengers getting 
on, and leaving the gate position--had to prove themselves 
during an average of five to six flights per day over routes 
with a time in operation of between 60 and 80 minutes--like, for 
example, from Paris-Orly to Toulouse, Bordeaux, Marseilles or 
Nice. 
  The company says that there were striking results during the 
route tests, but above all even for the efficiency data obtained 
during flight. "The total weight of the A330 is approximately 
1.5 tons below the airline guaranteed values of 217 tons 
maximum. Not least, its take-off and landing properties could be 
improved because of this. But it is much more important that the 
fuel consumption was able to be lowered once again by a good two 
percent," stated G&eacute;rard Guyot, head of Airbus Flight 
Division's testing and development department. In comparison 
with its competitors--the Boeing 777 and the McDonnell Douglas 
MD-11, the A330's fuel burn on a 2000-nautical-mile (3704-km) 
segment is between 17 and 21 percent more favorable, according 
to Airbus statistics. This would represent a saving of between 
$600,000 and $1 million per year per aircraft. Lastly, for 
operating costs even a reduction of up to $3.1 million per year 
is realistic. The two U.S. manufacturers are doubtlessly of a 
different opinion in this matter. 
  Last but not least, in addition the A330 also successfully 
passed the certification test for long over-land and over-water 
flights by twin-jet aircraft. These ETOPS (Extended Range Twin 
Engine Operations) certification flights are for proving the 
safe continuation of a flight in case of an engine failure with 
multiple system failures at the same time--depressurization and 
failure of the electrical system and the generation of fumes, 
for example. Airbus Industrie will be supplying the A330 version 
furnished with Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4168 or with Rolls- Royce 
Trent 
700 engines with 90-minute ETOPS certification for the time 
being. Aircraft with the now proven General Electric CF6-80E1 
are being offered with 120-minute ETOPS certification, which 
means that, with the problems named above, an alternate airport 
has to be reached within two hours. 
  Certification for the new Airbus is to occur some time in 
October after lastly approximately 1000 hours in flight testing. 
The delivery of the first of a total of 15 aircraft to Air Inter 
is to take place towards the end of the year. Malaysia Airlines 
is to receive the first aircraft from the middle of 1994, at an 
estimated price of about $115 million apiece.

<F P=106> [Article by Volker Leuchsner under the rubric "Aerospace </F>
Journal": "Capsule Instead of Hermes--or What Is Happening With 
the Space Laboratory? New Start for Europe's Space Flights"; 
first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] ESA is pinning its future hopes totally on the 
launching capacity of the Ariane 5. The space laboratory is to 
be adapted for this and a capsule is to be developed as a taxi. 
But what Europe's ultimate contribution to a global space 
station is to look like continues to be disputed. 
  The persistent economic difficulties in its member countries 
and the latest developments concerning the American space 
station are now forcing the European Space Agency (ESA) too to 
reorient itself. Not even quite 10 months after the ministers' 
conference in Granada its director general, Jean-Marie Luton, 
presented at the end of September a new scenario that is to 
serve as a guideline to the year 2000. Manned space flights 
above all have been affected by the changes. 
  One has to adapt, Jean-Marie Luton stated. He said further 
that all the same Europe must not lose its status in space 
travel and has to make an independent outstanding contribution 
to the future global space station. Furthermore, in the context 
of financial and technological cutbacks, ESA is pinning its 
hopes on European participation in the space station and on 
greater cooperation with Russia. The Hermes shuttle is being 
canceled completely, and the Columbus world space laboratory is 
to be integrated in a diminished version into the new Manned 
Space Transportation Program (MSTP). Because both versions of 
the space station that are being discussed at present--with and 
without Russian participation--are now planning the docking of a 
European module not until the year 2002, the entire program is 
to be extended to this point in time and 4 billion European 
currency units [ECU] (8.2 billion German marks [DM]) are to be 
saved. Expenditures of ECU22 billion (DM45.1 billion) were 
planned in the Granada plan for the years 1993 to 2000, and 
these are now to be limited to ECU18 billion (DM36.9 billion) 
for the years 1994 to 2002. Everyone is being affected by hard 
times, the ESA chief said. The most important thing now, Luton 
said further, is to reorganize on the basis of clear performance 
targets and broad agreement and to remotivate the European 
partners in this manner. 
  The foundations of the new scenario are the Ariane 5, whose 
development is to be sped up further without cuts, and the trio 
consisting of the APM (Attached Pressurized Module) space 
laboratory, ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) transfer vehicle 
and CTV (Crew Transport Vehicle) capsule, integrated into the 
MSTP program. At around DM14 billion, the CTV and ATV transport 
elements are to cost only approximately a third of what was 
estimated for Hermes. All three basic elements are to be 
designed so that they can be launched by an Ariane 5. The APM 
laboratory module is a diminished version of the Columbus 
module. Only five double racks for scientific experiments, 
instead of the originally planned eight, are to have a spot in 
it. With a total mass of around 10 tons and a payload of 1.7 to 
3.4 tons, it is approximately equivalent to the Spacelab. 
  A ballistic re-entry capsule, that for reasons of cost is 
not 
to be reusable, is planned for the transport of astronauts and 
cargo. In the manned version it is to be able to transport from 
four to nine persons to the space station. The CTV is 
accordingly three times as large as the Soyuz and is to be 
simpler to handle and more precise when landing, Luton 
emphasized. The European design would also be ideally suited as 
a rescue capsule. 
  The MSTP system will be completed with the ATV transfer 
vehicle. It is necessary in order to take the laboratory and the 
capsule to the space station and to dock them automatically 
there. Two versions weighing 12.7 and 14.5 tons are being 
examined at present. 
  The Ariane 5 would accordingly be the third carrier system 
in 
addition to the Shuttle and the Russian rockets able to succeed 
in placing a space station in a 400-km-altitude orbit with an 
inclination of 51.6 degrees, as planned for the global station. 
Kourou's location close to the equator presents further 
advantages here. Europe's new carrier rocket could, that is, as 
it is being developed at the moment, carry 18 tons to a station 
in this orbit. This is something absolutely new, and a 
strengthening of Europe's position. In the original planning for 
Freedom the Americans permitted only Shuttle flights and charged 
a lot of money for them. 
  However, ESA's new plans also include an independent 
scenario 
for the case of cases that an international space station does 
not come off. Equipped with a logistics module and solar cell 
paddles, the APM could also orbit alone around the earth. 
Jean-Marie Luton emphasized in closing that the paper in 
question is a strategy document and is to serve as a reference 
point for the next two years. The first actual decisions are to 
take place not until at the next ESA ministers' conference at 
the beginning of 1995. 
<H3>  BDLI [Federation of the German Aerospace Industry] Fears 
Further Loss of Jobs </H3>
  It is uncertain whether ESA will manage to succeed with this 
plan with every member country. Though Federal Research Minister 
Kruger and his French and Italian colleagues agree that 
Europe in any case is to take part in phase two of the 
American-Russian space station, however, as it looks, there are 
various opinions about this. The new head of DARA [German Agency 
for Space Affairs], Dr. Jan-Baldem Mennicken, said to the press 
on this matter at the beginning of October, "It is also being 
considered whether it is not possible to do without an 
independent laboratory and integrate Europe's contribution into 
a joint international laboratory." Mennicken said further that 
this has to be discussed in the near future with ESA and the 
industry. Timetables, costs and any disadvantages have to be 
taken into consideration here. The maintenance of the industry's 
technological capacity will play a decisive role in this 
discussion. But the APM is still a stipulated part of the 
program, he stressed. 
  The chairman of BDLI's space flight working group, Horst 
Rauck, demanded in this connection, in the light of further cuts 
in funds, "The Europeans have to take part as equal partners in 
the global space station." Keeping the German contribution for 
ESA at the earmarked sum of DM1.172 billion is the prerequisite 
for this, he says. Otherwise the further weakening of Germany as 
a site for industry and the loss of high-technology jobs are to 
be feared, he stressed. What will remain at the end, with the 
shrinking process of the Columbus European space station, is 
written in the stars. The Freeflyer was stricken off the list a 
long time ago already, and the docked laboratory (APM) has been 
scaled down and postponed once again. We will wait and see.

<F P=106> [Article by Wolfgang Engelhardt: "Eastern Germany's Space </F>
Enterprises Hope for Better Participation in ESA Projects"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Included in the general efforts for 
economic integration by the new laender are also activities to 
include the very efficient space capacities of the GDR in the 
western German and European satellite programs. Numerous 
problems must be solved for this, so that the enterprises which 
until now were oriented more toward the former East Block can 
learn, for example, to compete for industrial contracts from the 
European Space Agency, ESA. 
  The first successes by the DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AG] and 
Zeiss company group in Jena with high-performance optoelectronic 
telescopes and satellite components are stimulating this 
difficult adjustment process. In order to accelerate this 
development, the German Space Agency (DARA) in Bonn recently 
arranged an industrial conference especially for those newly 
founded enterprises which also deal with satellite projects. 
  What is involved is about 60 companies with 10,000 
employees, 
some of which often have only a few dozen people working in this 
field, however. DARA itself has supported the reorganization of 
the socialist research structures from the beginning, of course, 
and fought for the preservation of the highly qualified 
technical and scientific space capabilities in the new laender. 
  Accordingly, this year DARA has distributed about 16 percent 
of the national space flight budget of about 350 million German 
marks [DM] to enterprises in eastern Germany and thus almost 
achieved a percentage which corresponds to the population 
figure. Three years after unification this is regarded as a very 
good integration result in the national space flight sector. 
  On the international level, this inclusion of the eastern 
German satellite industry has not been very successful, however. 
To begin with, it involves concrete aid, such as how the new 
laender should actually apply to ESA for project participation. 
A complicated formalism is required for this, which can only be 
mastered after some practice. 
  It begins with the special English-American expressions and 
does not even begin to end with the knowledge of the 
ramifications of the European space flight industry. Concrete 
help is urgently needed, because in 1993 eastern German 
companies were only able to obtain ESA contracts worth DM 1 
million for preparatory studies. That is only a tenth of a 
percent of the German contribution of more than DM 1 billion to 
the European space flight organization this year. 
  In order to increase this share significantly, DARA, 
together 
with German Aerospace, recently invited ESA's director general 
Jean-Marie Luton to Jena-Optronik in Thuringia, and Luton 
expressed himself quite impressed by the technical capability 
and the involvement of the approximately 100 employees, who 
previously developed and built special cameras and other 
optoelectronic equipment for Russian space projects. 
  The French research politician gave assurances that in the 
future the eastern German enterprises should have the same 
chance to obtain space flight contracts within the European 
framework as other ESA nations. The companies in Jena and other 
locations will get concrete opportunities for larger contracts 
as soon as the German and European space flight cooperation with 
Russia really gets under way, because that is where the eastern 
German experts, with their Russian knowledge and the experience 
they acquired at the time of the GDR with projects in the East 
Block, have clear advantages. 
  Jena-Optik therefore calculates that it has good chances for 
getting several ESA contracts amounting to about DM 25 million 
next year. Above all, they involve the Omos-Ozone telescope for 
the Envisat satellite for atmospheric and earth reconnaissance, 
as well as a solar sensor for the Artemis communications 
satellite and components for the XMM X-ray telescope, which will 
be launched at the very end of the 1990s. 
  Another important project for including eastern German 
capabilities in European space flight is being proposed by the 
Carl Zeiss company in Jena. This involves an astronomical 
telescope which is to be used for experiments in optical data 
transmission with the European Artemis communications satellite. 
  This instrument is based on several other telescopes, which 
were previously built by VEB Carl Zeiss Jena for several 
observatories in the East. The telescope has received improved 
electronic controls and additional equipment for laser 
experiments. 
  Despite the general economic problems, in the last few years 
a number of western German companies in the space flight 
industry have become involved in the new laender by taking over 
companies there with a similar production range or by founding 
new branch offices. This applies not only to large companies 
such as Deutsche Aerospace or Carl Zeiss, but also to 
medium-sized systems enterprises such as OHB-Bremen and 
Kayser-Thede, Munich, as well as to many small companies.

  [Text] Daewoo is inaugurating its TV factory in Fameck, 
Lorraine, after an investment of 155 million francs. Its planned 
capacity is 400,000 TV sets a year, and it will employ 160 
persons, then 350 persons in 1995. Initially, the cathode ray 
tubes will be supplied by European manufacturers. Beginning in 
1995, they will be produced by the future plant for which Daewoo 
recently laid the first stone at Longwy. These two units will 
enable the Korean firm to strengthen its position in the 
European markets, while shedding their label as "assembly 
plants."

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Vitor Malheiros: "PoSat-1's Photo Album"; </F>
photographs mentioned in the text have not been reproduced; 
introductory paragraph in boldface as published]] 
  [Text] The two video cameras carried by PoSat have 
already sent several hundred images back to earth, although only 
on an experimental basis for the time being. The (black and 
white) images are still being used only to fine-tune the 
programs, but the regions photographed are already 
recognizable. 
  As far as the scientists responsible for PoSat-1 are 
concerned, the photographs illustrating this page are not even 
worth publishing. They are images obtained during the process of 
fine-tuning the two video cameras carried on the Portuguese 
satellite, and they are still a long way from providing the 
quality that it will be possible to achieve within a few weeks. 
But they do provide at least a sample of the capabilities of the 
instruments carried by the Portuguese satellite--even though it 
has not been possible so far to obtain the images of Portuguese 
territory that everyone is waiting for. 
  "We have not yet managed to obtain any image of Portugal 
because of the poor weather conditions," we were told by Miguel 
Leitmann of the National Institute of Engineering and Industrial 
Technology (INETI). "Every time we have used the cameras over 
Portugal, the only thing we have picked up is clouds." 
  But the difficulties inherent in obtaining images by 
satellite are far from being just a matter of atmospheric 
conditions. In fact, to obtain a good image with the two video 
cameras on PoSat--they are used not to film pictures but to 
obtain photographs--it is necessary above all to calibrate them 
to adapt them to the features of the desired image and thus 
obtain the maximum amount of information. Like commercial video 
cameras, the two on-board cameras--a wide-angle camera and one 
with a narrow angle--have electronic sensors to capture light. 
And it is the signals picked up by those sensors which, after 
being processed by the on-board computers, give rise to the 
images shown above. But just as a photographer has to first 
choose which film speed he will use, so it is also necessary in 
this case to adjust the kind of processing that is being used in 
order to obtain the best possible contrast. That is one of the 
jobs to which the PoSat team has been devoting itself. 
  That calibration process is, however, relatively slow 
because 
it depends on the type of image captured: The way the camera is 
adjusted to obtain an image of the green Amazon Region is 
completely different from that used to photograph the white 
Antarctic or that used to photograph the sea. And again, the 
process can be compared point by point to what a photographer 
does to take a photograph (choice of film and choice of filters, 
shutter speed, and lens aperture), the only difference being 
that in the case of satellites, it is all done after the fact by 
a computer program that manipulates the data captured by the 
cameras. 
  To be sure that the image processing programs they are using 
are the most appropriate, the members of the PoSat team have 
been trying at the moment to obtain images whose optical 
characteristics are well known (sea, ice, forest, and desert) so 
that they can use those images to calibrate the cameras--like 
natural "sighting instruments." And only when all that is done 
do they expect to obtain images of good enough quality for use 
in managing natural resources or studying the dispersion of 
pollutants. 
  Another difficulty still being posed by PoSat is its 
movement. At the present time, the satellite is still swinging 
like a pendulum and covering an angle of about 9 degrees, and it 
is moving in a rotating motion. This means that it is still 
impossible--for the time being--to know exactly where the 
satellite is pointing, with the result that arduous searching in 
atlases is required to locate precisely the areas that were 
photographed. The fact is that because of the way PoSat-1 
currently moves, the center of the images it captures may be 
anywhere within a circle having a 120-km diameter. If we add to 
that the fact that the camera with the narrowest angle covers an 
area measuring 160 km square (the wide angle covers almost an 
entire continent), it is easy to see the difficulty of 
determining location. 
  In the images we show here, the difficulty of determining 
location is increased by the fact that the regions photographed 
are distorted in relation to the image we are accustomed to 
seeing on maps. The reason is that many of the images were 
captured while the satellite was "looking to the side." 
  But all those difficulties are expected to diminish when the 
satellite starts using two of its position-finding and 
attitude-indicating systems: the GPS [Global Positioning System] 
receiver (which makes it possible to determine PoSat-1's 
position relative to a system of satellites going by the name of 
Global Positioning System) and the star sensor (which will make 
it possible to determine the direction the satellite is facing). 
When that happens, it will be possible to order the satellite to 
take a picture while pointing at a given site instead of doing 
so, as now, by determining which region of the sky the satellite 
is in.

Phase"] 
  [Text] Paris--CNES has just decided to place into service 
the Spot-3 earth observation satellite which was launched last 
26 September by Ariane. 
  Equipment performance has met the required specifications, 
which are comparable to those recorded during Spot-1 and Spot-2 
flights. Radiometric and geometric image quality are 
"excellent," as the bulletin emphasized. The Spot-1 satellite, 
currently on stand-by, has retained its direct viewing 
capabilities, while Spot-2 is still carrying out its operations. 
  The high precision DORIS radio localization system aboard 
the 
satellite "is functioning perfectly" and the American experiment 
POAM II (Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurements) has begun 
gathering data, particularly on the ozone layer above the poles. 
  Developed by CNES in cooperation with Belgium and Sweden, 
with participation from the National Geographic Institute (IGN), 
Spot was built by Matra Marconi Space as prime contractor.

  [Text] At the scientific press conference in Berlin this 
week, Post Office board member Dr. Guenter Tumm, Prof. Dietrich 
Wabner of Munich Technical College, and experts from the 
Bavarian Federation for Technical Control (TUeV), and the Energy 
Management Research Center explained the technical advantages of 
an innovative battery technology that the German Federal Post 
Office wants to use in electric vehicles in the parcels service 
starting in 1995. Developed by Jerusalem firm EFL, the battery 
uses zinc-air electrodes and has successfully completed a 
practical test with the Bavarian Federation for Technical 
Control. 
  Whilst a 900 kilogram lead-gel battery gave a Post Office 
electric van a range of only 54 kilometers, with a 650 kilogram 
EFL battery it can travel 300 kilometers. Apart from the new 
battery's drastically increased storage capacity, Professor 
Wabner stressed in particular the system's operational safety in 
the event of a short circuit. By contrast, some electric 
vehicles fitted with sodium sulfide batteries had gone up in 
flames when a short circuit occurred. 
  The remarkable thing is that even when cooled to minus 18 
degrees the EFL battery can still give full power within 
millionths of a second. Wabner described the EFL energy system 
as the best battery in the world at present. Initially, 
starting in 1995, not more than 70 vehicles owned by the Post 
Office and various firms and municipalities will be fitted with 
the new batteries. The field trial will serve to clarify not so 
much technical as operational questions. Dr. Tumm said the 
running costs of an EFL vehicle were initially 1.40 German marks 
[DM] per kilometer, whereas a diesel vehicle today costs only 42 
pfennig [0.42 DM] per kilometer. But Post Office experts 
calculate that once the EFL batteries have been introduced the 
price per kilometer could fall to 54 pfennig [0.54 DM] by the 
year 2000.

<F P=106> [Article by Thierry Mahe: "Renault's Laboratory On Wheels, </F>
Pasha"; first paragraph is INDUSTRIES ET TECHNIQUES introduction] 
  [Text] Engineers at the Aubevoye test center in Eure are 
validating active suspension technology by mounting each wheel 
on a computer-controlled hydraulic jack. 
  There are no highway signs to guide you to Renault's test 
center in Aubevoye (Eure), where the manufacturer guards its 
secrets carefully behind high hedges. The center is where 
Renault tests the road handling of its prototypes. It also 
validates there--with the agreement of the Rueil research 
center--the new "skid resistance" technologies (suspension, 
steering, braking, etc.) that will be standard on mass-produced 
cars within 10 years. The suspension system of the Safrane (AMV) 
passed its final examination at Aubevoye. The center will also 
produce Renault's first "real" active suspension system. Nicolas 
Varlot, the head of test systems development, explains. 
"Renault's Safrane or Citroen's Xantia do not, strictly 
speaking, have active suspension systems. Their shock absorbers 
have simply been altered, without any addition of energy. 
Outside of the Formula 1, the only example of active suspension 
is Nissan's Infinity." Aubevoye has some strange-looking mutants 
on its roads, including an R25 with an oddly upswept front hood 
and a license plate that reads "Pasha", for "Active Hydraulic 
Suspension Automobile Prototype." Each of Pasha's wheels has a 
computer-driven hydraulic jack, and its rear trunk contains a 
powerful (32 Mips) computer and an array of electronic boards. 
Under the vehicle's front hood snakes a mass of hydraulic 
circuits, and each suspension jack features three sensors to 
monitor distance traveled, speed, and effort. Computations 
consume a total of 32 input parameters. Pasha is a real 
laboratory on wheels, designed to simulate all types of 
suspension. Its has a steering counterpart, called Dirac. Says 
Nicolas Varlot, "We have been testing Pasha since the beginning 
of the year. By mid-1994, we will have worked up a 
specifications sheet, and by late 1994, we will have preliminary 
vehicles." Safrane's replacement may sport an active suspension 
system... 
  Two parameters can be used to synthesize suspension 
behavior: 
wheel wobble, a safety factor; and autobody cycling, which is 
linked to comfort (cycling = the oscillations to which the body 
is subjected). Pasha can modulate these two parameters over a 
very broad range. Depending on adjustments, passengers can feel 
they are riding in a 2 hp, or a luxury limousine! Renault 
engineers are experimenting with 16 types of servocontrol, one 
of which will be selected as offering the best tradeoff between 
comfort and safety. Assessing those two variables still provides 
a great deal of food for thought. Francois Hebert, head of the 
electronics/data-processing lab, stresses, "With Pasha, we can 
even induce a counter-rolling motion. When the vehicle turns, it 
leans in the opposite direction to that of most cars! Is this 
good? Reducing or reversing rolling motion may be a good idea to 
help cars grip the road, but the change skews the perception of 
the driver. The same goes for the ABS, which makes people safer 
and encourages them to drive faster. It's dangerous, especially 
when the driver switches back to a regular model!" 
  The Aubevoye center is involved in every step of creating a 
vehicle, starting from the very basic research level, during the 
technology scouting stage. It remains active during the 
pre-project phase "before the vehicle even gets to the drawing 
board", and again during development of the prototypes. "Our job 
is to work up the specifications sheet and check that the 
prototype is valid. One of our suppliers (Valeo, Bendix, etc.) 
then makes it. In return, we inspect the equipment," says 
Nicolas Varlot. 
  One of the peculiar features of electronic equipment is that 
it tends to break down. Annoying when the automatic window 
controls are involved, failures are catastrophic if they affect 
the steering, braking, or suspension systems! "Hence the 
importance of strategies involving graceful degradation, which 
occupies between 60 and 80 percent of the computer's memory. 
Engineers must, for example, anticipate one of the suspensions 
being knocked out--and design the other three to adjust 
accordingly!" adds Nicolas Varlot. 
  Will numerical simulation of vehicle behavior make certain 
road tests obsolete? "It's an old question.... We thought 
structural computations were going to eliminate crash 
studies--but they didn't at all. The more you refine a 
simulation, the more new parameters pop up! At best, road 
handling simulators will eliminate certain standard tests." 
Concludes Varlot, "A problem solved raises other that need 
solving. When the ocean recedes, it exposes new shoals!" 
<H5>  Boxed Material: Using Electronics in Testing </H5>
  Francois Hebert's electronics lab has a staff of six and two 
electronics CAD stations that run the Cadence program. Cadence 
can be used to design and simulate digital/analog boards. Says 
Francois Hebert, "One of the product's great features is its 
behavioral simulation module, which enables us to close the 
simulation loop." Indeed, the sim module can be used to model a 
mechanical device--jack, steering column--governed by linear or 
non-linear laws. The laboratory designs between 15 and 20 boards 
a year, each of which requires about three months of study. "By 
extending the limits of electronic board simulation, we have 
reduced the number of touchups per board from 4 or 5 to 1.2 or 
1.4. With each touchup costing 30,000 or 40,000 French francs, 
CAD quickly pays for itself." 
<H5>  Boxed Material: Two Facilities for Torturing Prototypes </H5>
  Renault has two facilities for prototype testing. The first, 
at Lardy (Essonne), specializes in engines, while the second, in 
Aubevoye (Eure), focuses on skid resistance (chassis, 
suspension, brake system, etc.) and vehicle dynamics. Aubevoye 
was created in 1982 and employs about 300 people. It boasts 21 
kilometers of roadways to test speed, road handling, skid 
resistance, comfort, and endurance. The test roads recreate 
pothole conditions, high-speed national highways, city streets, 
and mountain roads. The center has an acoustical bench and a 
climate wind tunnel.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Mobile Charging Stations Extend </F>
Operating Time of Electric Busses--Novel Battery Exchange 
Technology a Plus for Emission-Free Local Passenger 
Traffic--Pilot Projects in Belgium and Saxony"] 
  [Text] Varta and Neoplan recently presented a 
semi-automated battery exchange technology. This joint 
development is considered a step forward in the field of 
electric commercial vehicles (delivery vehicles and city busses) 
and could help reduce exhaust in cities, metropolitan and resort 
areas. 
  Moveable battery exchange stations in a container are to 
improve short-term prospects for battery-driven busses used for 
public local passenger transportation and in delivery vehicles 
within the city. Modern exchange stations would avoid the 
drawbacks of relatively short ranges and operating times which 
are currently preventing the use of electrically driven busses 
and commercial vehicles. 
  These mobile charging stations using a container format 
require only a small space (the required area for a standard 
version is 2.5 x 6.0 meter) and can be set up practically 
anywhere. Recharging the batteries from the AC line current 
requires only a 380 V outlet. 
  As Rainer Bitthin, head of systems development at Varta, 
points out, this allows unrestricted 24-hour scheduled city bus 
service. Neither "refuelling" at fixed charging stations which 
takes hours nor the rather cumbersome battery exchange by 
fork-lift truck are necessary. 
  As he explains, the bus driver himself can exchange the 
battery at the mobile charging station within a few minutes. To 
start the semi-automated battery exchange the bus rolls 
backwards to the charging station with its charging flap open. 
Two roller belt arms from the changing station are connected to 
the bus. When a button is pushed the empty battery automatically 
moves across the roller belts to an empty charging site at the 
station. 
  By pushing another button a charged battery is automatically 
moved across the roller belts into the rear section of the 
vehicle. All the bus driver has to do is to connect the 
batteries. 
  Depending on the version, the battery exchange containers 
can 
accept four to six batteries. They are placed in two shelves on 
two or three levels each and can be charged there. The required 
charging devices including the water supply for the Varta 
Aquamatik system are in a separate compartment inside the 
container. 
  According to calculations by the experts at Neoplan and 
Varta, for instance, five batteries would be needed for 
permanent scheduled service with two busses between 6:00 a.m. 
and 10:00 p.m including the required battery exchange intervals. 
For the pilot projects, Neoplan and Varta are using led-traction 
batteries with tubular plates. 
  According to reports the Varta Perfect type battery with 
electrolyte circulation and Varta Aquamatik is very energy 
efficient and requires little maintenance. The charging time per 
battery is reported to be five to six hours. 
  As Bitthin explains, the complete system including bus, 
battery and exchange station has been studied as a pilot program 
in Saxony and Mechelen/Belgium. He says that there has been wide 
acceptance both among the bus service operators and the bus 
drivers who actually had to exchange the battery.

<F P=106> [Article by Cecile Remy and Tierry Mahe: "Electric Cars: </F>
Who's Taking the Risk?"; first paragraph is INDUSTRIES ET 
TECHNIQUES introduction] 
  [Text] For a vehicle reputed to be quiet, the electric car 
has generated a lot of hype. Until Renault and PSA industrialize 
their concept-cars, small independent automakers will struggle 
on alone to build a future for electric vehicles--and assume all 
the risks. 
  Two years ago PSA was trumpeting that France would have 
between 10,000 and 50,000 electric vehicles by 1995. Projections 
have since fallen to 5,000. The culprit, of course, is the 
recession. But cold feet on the part of big manufacturers and 
the cautious attitude of collectivities--the only players 
capable of "getting the market off the ground"--are also 
responsible. With no Draconian law in effect to curtail urban 
pollution1, cities saw electric cars mainly as an 
inexpensive way to fashion a "glamorous" image for themselves. 
Virtuous in the extreme, non-polluting, quiet, robust, and 
easy-to-drive and park electric cars are nonetheless guilty of 
one sin: they are expensive. The (1995) electrified version of 
the Clio, for instance, will cost 170,000 French francs [Fr], or 
three times as much as the standard one! The limited autonomy of 
electric vehicles and, most important, the lack of urban 
infrastructure (recharge terminals) also work against them. In 
fact, electric cars are the victims of a classic vicious circle: 
Limited infrastructure plus high prices equals few users and 
small production runs, thus keeping prices high and the number 
of customers low. This raises the question of who will take the 
risk of jumping in first. Initially, big automakers seemed the 
answer. So far, neither PSA nor Renault has done anything more 
than electrify very-small-run commercial vehicles. Renault will 
not start series production of the Master until March, or of the 
Express until October, 1994, following eight years of 
experimentation and 400,000 km of road tests at its 
Chatellerault pilot site. Moreover, annual production volumes 
will not exceed 1,000--a drop in the bucket! True, Renault's 
Clio and PSA's 106 and AX will come out in electrified versions 
by 1995. But here again, the doses will be homeopathic. 
Automakers are offering electrified "commercial" vehicles first, 
both to supply companies and collectivities and for technical 
reasons. Battery weight in relation to total weight is less of a 
drawback on commercial vehicles than it is on personal 
automobiles. In addition, the industrial investment needed to 
electrify vehicles is virtually negligeable. Laurent Bernard, 
project head of Renault's Electric Commercial Vehicles Division, 
confirms this. "Whether or not the vehicle is electric makes no 
difference in the process. Clio's engine plant is replaced by 
its electrical equivalent. The only change is the addition of an 
assembly island to install the battery block." Launching series 
production of the first personal cars truly designed to be 
powered electrically would be striking evidence of the 
commitment of big automakers. Unfortunately, Renault's Zoom, 
Citroen's Citela, and Fiat's Downtown are still nothing more 
than elegant theoretical constructs, with no launch dates in 
sight. The same manufacturers have not yet definitively chosen 
between all-electric vehicles and hybrid ones, as evidenced by 
Volkswagen's Chico, BMW's E1, or Renault-Volvo's ECC. Most 
important, the pricing policy of big automakers is a huge 
discentive. "It's because we haven't got costs under control. 
Seventy percent of the value of a traditional car is 
subcontracted, against 90 percent for an electric car!" pleads 
Laurent Bernard of Renault. 
  What might look like a wait-and-see attitude actually 
reflects real difficulties in keeping in step with a market 
whose volume is too low. As Dominique Mathon, director of 
Microcar (Jeanneau), explains, "Starting at 5,000 cars a year, 
we would have to revamp our manufacturing process. In contrast, 
5,000 is the break point at which big manufacturers can consider 
launching a series!" So it is the "Tom Thumbs" of the industry 
that hold the future of the electric car in their hands, and 
will continue to do so for another several years. Most of these 
pioneers began as makers of small motorized vehicles that do not 
require driver's licenses and of commercial vehicles. Examples 
include Erad, Aixam, Microcar, and Automobiles Ligier. In 
producing electric cars, they are remaining faithful to their 
light, two-seater, urban vehicle niche. The automakers have 
banded together under the banner of Apvere. As Pierre Bazier of 
Rocaboy indicates, it is an objective alliance in which "Each 
supplier offers a line that complements the others'." Adds 
Bazier, "Each time one of us sells an electric car, he helps 
shore up the market." 
  Jack Vergne, director of Seer-Volta, sees no reason to be 
anything but optimistic. "Our production doubles every year: 75 
vehicles in 1991-92, 150 in 1992-93. Our goal for 1994 is 300." 
The company has resolutely opted to produce just one product: a 
small commercial vehicle comparable to Citroen's C15 and 
Renault's Express for roughly the same price. How will the 
company be able to justify making its electric vehicle when the 
two groups launch their own series? Jack Vergne is untroubled. 
"Unlike those `electrified' models, Volta was designed to be 
powered by an electrical engine. This shows in its performance. 
Volta has a payload of 500 kg, against 300 kg for the C15; its 
degree of lock is shorter; the car's batteries do not cut into 
the amount of space available in the interior; and its 
suspension has been adapted to handle the extra weight." 
Competition from the big names does not scare Pierre Bazier of 
Rocaboy either. "Our model can be transformed in any way we need 
to." Erad agrees, pointing out that "We are satisfying demands 
that the big car companies will never be able to meet. One 
example is a modified version with a very short degree of lock 
to enable it to maneuver easily in the tunnel under the 
Channel!" Technologically, the companies must take a pragmatic 
approach, and the small firm Seer-Volta makes do with what it 
can find on the market. That means lead batteries and d.c. 
motors. "Nickel-cadmium technology would push up the price of 
batteries from Fr17,000 to Fr70,000. If that happened, we would 
offer lease contracts to enable customers to stagger their 
payments." 
  Most of the small car makers hold down their manufacturing 
costs by using non-industrialized technologies. Seer-Volta, for 
instance, buys its tubular frames from the supplier of Renault's 
Alpine. And it molds its body in polyester resin, a simple and 
cheap process that makes the vehicle quite light. Won't these 
modest processes curb production if the market takes off? "Not 
at all. We can supply up to 1,000 vehicles a year without 
changing anything in our procedure," says Jack Vergne. Another 
shrewd move on the part of the automaker is avoiding the long 
and costly crash-test process. "Volta features an `advanced 
cabin'; a simple Utac inspection is enough." Of all the 
automakers, Erad boasts the most varied line: three leisure 
vehicles (Agora, Spacia, Junior) and two commercial ones. Two 
years ago, electric vehicles accounted for two percent of its 
sales; today they make up 30 percent! Pascal Ansart, marketing 
director of Erad, describes the typical Homo Electricus Rex: 
"He's a veterinarian! He uses the car for his work, in urban 
areas and over short distances. Since he travels alone, he 
appreciates a `two-seater' that is easy to park and less 
expensive than a thermal vehicle: Fr1,400 altogether against 
Fr1,700 a month for a diesel." At Fr51,000, Erad's Agora is 
certainly the cheapest vehicle on the market. "It's because we 
make everything in house, using hyper-light materials. Agora 
weighs only 650 kg, including batteries. The vehicle's cost is 
tied directly to its weight/power ratio." Although the Junior is 
"electrified", the models that followed it were literally 
designed around batteries. "The load is perfectly distributed, 
which gives the vehicle excellent steering. That is not true of 
electrified vehicles." 
  Rocaboy, for its part, is a pioneer, having homologated its 
first electric vehicle in 1977! The RK200 commercial vehicle is 
now its leading product. Pierre Bazier, Rocaboy's director, 
explains. "Electric vehicles are expensive, I agree; but in 
certain cases, a thermal model would be even more so! For 
instance, if thermals were required to run quietly or without 
spewing any emissions into the air. So we supply Atomic Energy 
Commission plants and the Louvre Museum with vehicles for their 
service areas. Electric vehicles are perfectly suited for 
industrial use involving stops and starts every 500 meters and 
close handling." Finally, there are the companies that design 
special-use vehicles: Sita and Semat for street cleaners and 
garbage trucks, and Charlatte for industrial vehicles. Says 
Sita's Alfred Trombini, "Our electric models derive from thermal 
ones; they are quiet and non-polluting, two requirements which 
are found in certain municipal bid invitations. Given the price 
of this type of vehicle, the additional cost of electrification 
is only 10 to 30 percent." Such a small ratio makes it possible 
to retain a thermal engine to enable the vehicle to get back to 
repair shops and incineration plants, which are located far from 
urban areas. 
  Small electric carmakers still have a few years before the 
"big guys" invade their turf. At that time they might taste the 
bitter experience of having been the first ones on the block. 
Then again, they could, in the meantime, widen the gap so far 
that they will become forces to be reckoned with. 
<H5>  Boxed Material: Electric Vs. Electrified Vehicles </H5>
  "Electrified" vehicles are avatars of thermal ones--that is, 
they are series models whose original powerplants have been 
replaced by electric motors. All large-run personal vehicles 
will continue to be electrified versions for the next several 
years. Electric vehicles, in contrast, are designed with 
electrical propulsion in mind. Generally they feature two or 
three seats. Since battery weight and space needs are factored 
in from the outset, electric vehicles offer better skid 
resistance, comfort, and ergonomics. Their batteries, whose 
placement is better planned, do not cut into the room available 
in the vehicle's interior. 
<H5>  In a Nutshell </H5>
  --Once they reach a volume of 5,000 a year, small 
manufacturers will have to revamp their production processes. 
That is still a ways down the road. 
  --A vehicle designed to be powered electrically can carry 40 
percent more payload than a classic electrified vehicle. 
  --Agora weighs only 650 kg, including batteries.

  Sita has been making its Lama 6000 street cleaner since 
1990. 
The same company supplies electric garbage trucks to the cities 
of Bordeaux and Paris. It was awarded the EUREKA label for one 
of its research programs on electric vehicles. 
  Renault's Master and Express are electrified vehicles. 
Tested 
since 1986 in Chatellerault, they will be mass-produced in 1994. 
The city of Goteborg (Sweden) has ordered 200. 
  Erad's Agora, made since early 1993, is the least expensive 
electric car on the market at Fr51,000. It is a small, 
two-seater, convertible with almost 2 HP! Its maker Erad is in 
the process of industrializing its shops to meet demand. The 
company expects to sell 450 electric cars (half personal, half 
commercial) in 1994. 
  The BMW E1 is an example of a hybrid vehicle equipped with a 
combustion and an electric engine. It has the qualities of a 
road car and is expected to reach maximum speeds of 125 km/h on 
its electric engine. 
  Peugeot's electric 106 and its AX cousin--also 
electric--will 
be given to 50 individual drivers for a year and a half in La 
Rochelle. This user test will precede product launch. It will 
also give the city a chance to test the smart-card-operated 
recharge terminals, slow recharge in parking lots, and quick 
recharge in certain gas stations. 
  Renault's Zoom concept-car, devised by Matra Automobile, 
prefigures the urban electric car of the next millenium. Its 
rear suspension is mounted on a retractable chassis, which 
shortens it 60 cm and allows it to be parked perpendicular to 
the sidewalk. The Zoom's nickel-cadmium batteries are expected 
to give it automony of 150 km. In 1995, Renault should 
industrialize its first electric recreational vehicle, the Clio. 
  Opel's Twin is a four-seater vehicle, with one seat in the 
front and three in the back. A 10-kW three-phase engine equips 
each wheel hub. The Twin can reach speeds of 120 km/h. 
Carbon-lithium batteries give it autonomy of 250 km. 
Footnotes 
  1. In California, the law requires that two percent of all 
vehicles be emission-free (and thus electric) by 1998, and that 
10 percent meet that standard by 2003. In France, a 25 October 
1991 decree defines special protection areas where prefects can 
take any measure needed to bring atmospheric pollution levels 
below an admissible threshold.

and Electronics"; first paragraph is INDUSTRIES ET TECHNIQUES 
introduction] 
  [Text] Electrochemists, electrical engineers, and 
electronics engineers are going back to the drawing board with 
electric cars in mind. This new consumer product might also 
benefit electrical installers and mechanics. 
  "Electric cars require a 40-percent ratio of new 
components," 
says Jacques Saint Marc, general secretary of GIVE, the 
Interministerial Group for the Development of Electric Vehicles. 
Industrialization of the new product raises dazzling prospects 
of new technological outlets for electrochemistry, of course, 
and for electrical and electronics engineering. It allows 
planners to dream of new professions, from electrical installers 
of computerized point-of-sale devices, to mechanics certified as 
"electric car maintenance technicians." 
  The electric cars now on the market have given a few 
equipment manufacturers, such as Leroy Somer or Oldham, an 
opportunity to join the ranks of automobile equipment makers. 
Both already specialized in industrial traction--one for engines 
and the other for batteries. Like Valeo, auto equipment 
manufacturers are inclined to wait for the next generation of 
vehicles and firm orders before committing themselves to the 
market. 
  The first component stimulated by electric cars is 
batteries. 
Field experiments conducted by cities and by Electricity of 
France (EDF) are expected to quickly produce a "smart" battery 
similar to sensors of a decade ago. "The trick is to incorporate 
monitoring functions into the battery, so that it has a good 
energy gauge. The battery must control its life," explains 
Syriacus Bleijs, Electric Car Program coordinator at EDF's 
Research Division. The battery will feature sensors and 
electronics that will provide it with information on its 
available energy capacity, the amount of energy it could absorb 
via recharge, and its aging status. 
  Renault's Express and Clio already have a small computer 
that 
fully controls the battery and that hooks up to the corrective 
maintenance unit available to dealers. Charger research is 
moving in the same direction, to determine whether batteries can 
tolerate rapid recharges. The goal is to restore 50 percent of a 
battery's capacity in 20 minutes. The 3.3-kWh terminals 
developed by Merlin Gerin and installed in La Rochelle recharge 
an electric car in eight hours. Rapid recharge terminals, which 
have been ordered from Westinghouse SGTE, should offer an 
additional 1-2 km of autonomy per minute. The rapid terminals 
offer far greater electrical power--over 30 kW--and research on 
them is being conducted as part of the European Elegie program. 
Induction recharge--that is, recharge without making 
contact--seems the best way to get electrical energy from the 
terminal to the car. The Praxitele program involving 
freely-traveling vehicles will experiment with this technique. 
  Naturally, batteries themselves are spurring the creativity 
of many researchers. Most vehicles now on the road are equipped 
with lead batteries, which are the cheapest and best known. A 
few models are running on nickel-cadmium batteries, which are 
more expensive but offer more autonomy as well as an energy 
density of 65 Wh/kg against 35 Wh/kg for lead. By using other 
materials, electrochemists hope to push the limit beyond 100 
Wh/kg and provide automobiles with autonomy of over 100 km. 
  The 33 percent state-subsidized PREDIT, or Ground Transport 
Industries Research and Development Plan, has opted to push 
lithium batteries. It has teamed up with Saft to promote 
carbon-lithium ones, and with EDF, Bollore Technologies, and 
Grenoble University to push polymer-lithium batteries. According 
to Syriacus Bleijs, EDF's research coordinator, carbon-lithium 
batteries seem closer to industrialization than fully solid 
lithium ones do. 
  Battery research has given rise to a new component: 
supercapacity, or a condensor that can deliver 10 kW/kg 
instantaneously. Supercapacity can handle strong acceleration 
surges, eliminating the traction power limitations of electric 
cars. When the supercapacity is discharged, it can also recover 
the energy produced during braking. PREDIT official Claude 
Prost-Dame says the very robust condensor seems well suited to 
automobile use. 
  Engines do not require as much research as batteries. 
Electrical engineers need only adapt their old standbys, which, 
roughly speaking, consist of d.c. motors, induction motors, and 
autopiloted, synchronous motors. Adaptation means not only 
meeting the technical specifications of automakers, but learning 
to live with their test procedures and quality checks. Leroy 
Somer is undergoing that apprenticeship as it develops three 
lines of d.c. motors. Indeed, d.c. motors are the most common 
engines used in electric cars today. Leroy Somer has totally 
revamped its industrial traction models, while the Danish firm 
Thridge Enco custom-designed one to meet the demands of the 
automaker Erad. The advantage of this type of engine is that it 
is controlled by relatively simple and low-cost thyristor power 
electronics. 
  Vector-control induction motors seem rather promising for 
upcoming models. They eliminate problems stemming from exhaust 
manifold wear, but require more complicated electronics, 
especially for starting. ABB has supplied Renault with a very 
compact prototype induction motor that can run at over 10,000 
rev/min. A sensor placed directly over the rotor checks the 
state of the motor as it starts up. Michel Kant is working with 
Valeo at the University of Compiegne to study the various 
characteristics of autopiloted, synchronous motors and of 
vector-control induction engines in a Volta body. "It is the 
whole pull chain that has to be considered, especially since it 
will not necessarily involve one motor, but two, or even four, 
one on each wheel," he says. 
  The Engineering School of La Rochelle (EIGSI) is working on 
protocols for measurements made on electric vehicles. "We have 
cabinets full of data that will not do us much good until we 
learn how to interpret them," stresses Claude Ades, one of the 
school's officials. "We have modified the measuring center that 
is used by CERAVE, the Center for Applied Research on Electric 
Vehicles. And we are developing new test procedures to model the 
behavior of electric vehicle drivers." The long-term goal of the 
school's research is to devise an assisted-driving or automatic 
help system. If electrical cars never hit the road, they will at 
least have helped advance a number of techniques. And if their 
use becomes widespread, new occupations could spring up. The 
electrical installers responsible for recharge systems could 
become electrical experts in point-of-sale devices, and 
mechanics could become "electric vehicle maintenance 
technicians." CERAVE has just teamed up with the La Rochelle 
Occupational Chamber to provide continuing adult education in 
"electric vehicle maintenance" to mechanics or newcomers (two 
years of college are desired) in 1994. The EDF-GDF Services 
Center in Versailles has also concluded a technical partnership 
agreement with Seer to provide maintenance for electric vehicles 
in the Paris area. 
  In the meantime, more and more hip technocrats are rallying 
round the product--which uses technology to fight pollution for 
the benefit of local collectiviies--with the expectation that it 
will one day become a consumer product (what better issue to use 
in an electoral campaign!). We have already cited CERAVE, the 
Center for Applied Research on Electric Vehicles; PREDIT, the 
Ground Transport Industries Research and Development Plan; and 
GIVE, the Interministerial "Electrical Vehicles" Group. Other 
important names are ADEME, the Agency for the Development of the 
Environment and Energy Control; a manufacturer organization 
AVERE, the European Association for Electric Road Vehicles; and 
CETUR--soon to be renamed CERTU--which is a division of the 
Equipment, Transport, and Tourism Ministry that coordinates 
municipal programs. 
<H5>  In a Nutshell </H5>
  --Batteries must become "smart." They need the equivalent of 
a gauge so that drivers can know how much energy they have. 
  --The goal of quick recharging is to provide 2 km of 
autonomy 
for each minute of recharge. 
  --Vector-controlled induction motors seem fairly promising 
for the next crop of models.

<F P=106> [Article by Olivier Lauvige: "Special Component Regulates </F>
Carburetor Air Intake; Mecaplast Uses Shape-Memory 
Alloys"--first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction] 
  [Text] The technical benefits of shape-memory alloys are 
many. Manufacturers must still be persuaded to equip their cars 
with this miracle device. 
  Quite sensitive, it shrinks in the slightest cold air draft. 
Then, it expands languorously under the effect of heat. 
Developed by the Mecaplast company, this car-engine thermal 
air-intake regulator is the first to use the surprising 
properties of shape-memory alloys. 
  "The system spares motorists who drive in very cold areas 
the 
unpleasantness resulting from the icing of intake valves," 
Didier Theron, the marketing manager of this Monaco company 
specialized in plastics engineering, explained. When the air 
temperature falls below a given value, the spring becomes less 
stiff, which causes a trap door to close, thus protecting 
carburetion components against the rigor of cold weather. 
Conversely, when the weather becomes milder, the spring recovers 
its initial characteristics and opens again the trap door. 
  The trick? The reversible behavior of these shape-memory 
alloys which reflects the passage from one crystalline structure 
to another. This transformation takes place in a number of 
alloys, such as copper-aluminum-nickel or titanium-nickel, 
following suitable heat treatments. 
  Mecaplast uses products made by the Memometal company. 
Located in the Alberville area in Savoie, this company has all 
the equipment required to make the precious material (vacuum 
furnaces, annealing furnaces, drawing machines, etc.). It can 
prepare the formula that will exactly meet its clients' 
requirements. 
<H5>  Fast and Reliable Regulators </H5>
  What are the advantages of shape-memory alloys to regulate 
the carburetion air intake? First, an extremely short response 
time: about two seconds compared with about 50 for traditional 
systems using wax caps. "These performance characteristics make 
it possible to achieve a much more precise regulation, which is 
therefore more suitable for the current electronic injection 
systems," according to Didier Theron. Another advantage is its 
reliability, as there is a minimum of moving parts. This 
simplification also reduced manufacturing costs by about 30 
percent. 
  In spite of all these benefits, the regulator is not yet on 
the market. In fact, we shall have to wait patiently for a few 
years, until car manufacturers venture to add this "quasi magic" 
component under the hoods of their cars. This wait-and-see 
attitude, however, does not shake the Mecaplast engineers's 
faith in the future of shape-memory alloys in the automobile 
world. They just filed a new patent in order to use these alloys 
to regulate the ventilation of engine hoods according to the 
outside temperature.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Georg Raschbichler, chief managing </F>
executive, Magnetschnellbahn Berlin-Hamburg GmbH [Berlin-Hamburg 
High-Speed Maglev Railway Limited Liability Company], under the 
rubric "Vistas '94": "`Transrapid' Has Now Made the Breakthrough 
to Worldwide Marketing. Technology and Transportation 
Representative for Germany As an Industrial Base. For High-Speed 
Maglev Railway Head Hans G. Raschbichler Success Is Also an 
Indication of Engineers' Forcefulness"; first paragraph is VDI 
NACHRICHTEN's introduction] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 24 Dec 93 (VDI-N)--With the 
government's affirmative decision to build the Transrapid 
high-speed maglev railway, a decision was made that reaches far 
into the future in terms of transportation and environmental 
policy. Hans Georg Raschbichler, chief managing executive of 
Berlin-Hamburg High-Speed Maglev Railway Limited Liability 
Company, takes this view in the following article. This graduate 
engineer is absolutely certain that Transrapid will 
revolutionize our transportation system. 
  The federal government's decision of 8 December 1993 to 
implement the Berlin-Hamburg high-speed maglev railway cleared 
the way for the first application of maglev railway technology 
in Germany. This decision is not just the prelude to a new era 
of environmentally compatible and industrial-trend-setting rail 
transportation. It is at the same time proof of German 
industry's innovation strength. And this applies both to the 
no-contact and no-wear technology that has for the first time 
overcome the limitations of wheels and tracks, and to the 
financing plan worked out by industry and the banks. 
  As with many projects of the century, it was the creativity 
and commitment of engineers that set the course toward the 
future. If in 1835 it was the first railroad that began its 
triumphant march as a new transportation representative on the 
Nuremberg-to-Furth line, so at the beginning of the 21st 
century it will be the high-speed maglev railway that 
revolutionizes our transportation system. Hence, in terms of 
transportation and industrial policy, recently a decision was 
made that reaches far into the future. 
  It all began with Emsland Graduate Engineer Hermann Kemper, 
who was annoyed by the noise caused by the railroad going by his 
house. His idea was to replace the railway's wheels with 
electromagnets. He knew that magnetic forces can assume the 
carrying and guiding functions of the wheel and track and thus 
enable no-contact levitation with high speeds and low noise 
generation. 
  His Reich patent from the year 1934 for a "levitation 
railway 
with wheelless vehicles that by means of magnetic fields are 
guided levitating along iron tracks" (DRP [German Reich Patent] 
64 33 16) was more than the vision of a young engineer who was 
ahead of his time, for the possibilities in electronics and 
vehicle construction were still very limited at that time. 
Consequently the implementation of his ideas was limited. 
  In 1966 engineers took up anew the technological 
possibilities of this idea and tested its technical feasibility. 
But they also in particular correctly judged its importance in 
terms of transportation policy. The results of the high-capacity 
high-speed railway study completed in 1971 were so positive that 
the development work begun soon led to the first experimental 
vehicles having quite different designs. 
  As a young engineer, I began my work on the development of 
the high-speed maglev railway in the middle of the sixties. 
We--my comrades-in-arms and I--were then conscious of the 
awakening in a new era of railway technology in which Germany 
had played a leading role all along. 
  A pilot system having a new design--the so-called 
long-stator 
maglev railway technology--was able to be put into operation 
successfully in Kassel as a result of a joint effort begun in 
1974 with Professor Weh of Braunschweig Technical University. In 
this design the motor is not located in the vehicle as usually, 
but in the railway. Because of this, the highly problematic 
transmission of power through current collectors at high 
traveling speeds was able to be avoided. In addition, the result 
was an especially lightweight and simple vehicle. 
  The various development directions thus far were assessed in 
1977 in a sweeping system decision of the Federal Ministry for 
Research and Technology. It was decided to focus further work on 
the long-stator maglev railway technology. Thus we had put 
through our design as the main development direction. 
  Then in 1979 came the first large-scale application on a 
just 
under 1- km-long line on the occasion of the International 
Transportation Exhibition in Hamburg (ITE '79). The government 
license for passenger transport was able to be obtained for the 
vehicle already then. Fifty thousand visitors were transported 
in scheduled service with reliability already very high for the 
state of development then. 
  The success in Hamburg was also decisive for the 
construction 
of the pilot system unique in the world for railway systems, the 
Emsland Transrapid Pilot System (TVE). 
  So, railway history has been written since 1984 in North 
Germany, between Lathen and Dorpen. The Transrapid 
high-speed maglev railway has proven its everyday usefulness in 
continuous service with a running capacity of more than 160,000 
km and a world-record speed of 450 km/h. Its readiness for use 
was certified at the end of 1991 after comprehensive testing and 
assessment by the German Federal Railways and leading university 
institutes. 
  This was also proof of German industry's leading role in a 
high technology that has now made the breakthrough to worldwide 
marketing, in addition to its use for a new transportation 
representative--especially after the affirmative decision for 
Berlin-to-Hamburg. 
  When I sum up personally today, after working nearly 30 
years 
in high-speed maglev railway development, I come to the 
conclusion that it was decisive for success that we--the 
engineers, companies and politicians-- steadily kept up our 
common commitment over so long a time, in spite of often serious 
obstacles and setbacks. 
  Only because of this is it possible now that a particularly 
attractive and environmentally compatible transportation system 
will open its service between the two largest German cities, 
Berlin and Hamburg, at the beginning of the new millennium. Then 
Transrapid trains will transport over 40,000 passengers a day 
every 10 minutes, comfortably and safely, over the 284-km-long 
distance with travel time of less than an hour. 
  Also a prerequisite for this is the plan--which is no less 
innovative-- adopted by the federal government for the financing 
and private-sector operation of the Berlin-Hamburg high-speed 
maglev railway. It goes far beyond the practice thus far in 
transportation investment, and is without precedence nationally 
and internationally. For example, the operating company that 
will operate the high-speed maglev railway will be privately 
financed for the first time. Furthermore, the financing proposal 
also provides for a high degree of taking the burden off the 
federal government in financing of the railway. 
  I am convinced that the implementation of the Berlin-Hamburg 
high-speed maglev railway through the joint initiative of the 
federal government, the states taking part and German industry 
will be a sign visible worldwide of the achievement and 
innovation strength of Germany as a technology and industrial 
base. It will prove strikingly the creativity and forcefulness 
of engineers, who with the high-speed maglev railway have also 
continued a part of the tradition showing them to be pioneers of 
progress.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Protein Structure and Design"] </F>
  [Text] Protein engineering is now a mature technology, 
while databases of sequence and structure continue to grow. As 
a result, protein design and modelling has become a strategic 
science, with important implications for the understanding of 
cell receptor function and rational drug design. The 
Biotechnology Directorate recently supported a joint N+N meeting 
with the German GBF [Biotechnological Research Association] in 
Braunschweig, to discuss the potential for collaboration and 
envisage future research needs and directions. 
  One of the key conclusions to emerge from the meeting was 
that many of the groups present were independently examining the 
three-dimensional structure of proteins, comparing structures 
and substructures and investigating protein alignment to define 
protein families. For example, Paul Barlow, of the Department 
of Biochemistry at Oxford University, described work on the 
structure of protein "modules". Recombinant DNA 
[desoxyribonucleic acid] technology permits the expression of 
protein segments that have autonomous folds and functions, whose 
structure can then be solved by multidimensional nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR). Others are predicting structure from 
sequence. At the European Molecular Biology Laboratory [EMBL], 
in Heidelberg, 700 protein families have been identified, based 
on their common primary structure. Using aligned families to 
train neural networks, it is now possible to predict secondary 
structure with an average accuracy of 70 percent. 
  Christine Orengo, of the Biomolecular Structure and 
Modelling 
Unit at UCL [University College London] reported on analysis of 
data in the Brookhaven Protein Database (PDB). She has 
identified 150 unique folds, and is developing fast automatic 
methods for comparing structures. Uta Lessel, from the host 
organisation, the Gesellschaft fuer Biotechnologische Forschung 
[GBF] in Braunschweig, described similar work based on 
calculating intramolecular C distances. This too isolates 
structural families from the PDB. Tim Hubbard, of the Cambridge 
Centre for Protein Engineering at Hills Road, takes this 
predictive approach in a different direction. He pointed out 
that the increased number of structures in the PDB allows one to 
use pair-wise interactions and H-bonding patterns to build 
potential tables for the topology of Beta-strand alignment, a 
technique that is sufficiently powerful to distinguish correct 
from incorrect alignments. Beta-strands are extended 
conformations of polypeptide chains. In modelling, it is 
essential to obtain the correct register and alignment of 
adjacent Beta-strands, which remains a difficult problem for 
anyone who wants to predict structure from sequence. 
  Gerald Boehm, of the University of Regensburg, is developing 
techniques to assess the quality and reliability of model 
structures. These include correlation functions, derived from 
non-redundant protein structures, that put statistical limits on 
the accuracy of a structure. The technique has been validated 
against deliberately misfolded models, and is now being used to 
investigate proteins from extremophiles to identify their 
individual sources of stability. 
  Although more nucleic acid data, from more diverse sources, 
is being collected every year, Rainer Fuchs of the EMBL Data 
Library cautioned that the quality of these data is probably 
lower. There are more than 100 types of database available 
today, and Fuchs called for more logical data structures, with 
better relational links between databases, in the future. Some 
of this development will take place during the next 18 months, 
as the Data Library moves to its new site in Cambridge. 
  Peter Artymiuk, of the Krebs Institute at Sheffield 
University, spoke about the development of two programs, POSSUM 
and PROTEP, that ease the comparison of 3-D structures, 
detecting new folds and identifying relationships between 
structure and function. The programs work at either main chain 
or side chain level, and have discovered previously unrecognised 
structural relationships between proteins in the PDB. 
  Paul Wrede, of the Free University in Berlin, has developed 
pattern recognitions programs using neural networks, which are 
particularly useful for protein design. PROFI, for example, 
extracts useful features such as signal peptide sequences, while 
PROSID simulates molecular evolution and can be used to design 
new cleavage sites. Another approach is to generate artificial 
structures by modifying the course of the main chain of a known 
structure. Frieder Kaden, of the German National Centre for 
Computer Science, explained how this generates a new topology 
with the same space-filling characteristics, which can then be 
used to create an enhanced database for the development of 
folding algorithms. 
  Putting the proteins and programs together to design new 
functions remains a challenge. Dietmar Schomburg explained how 
the interdisciplinary group at CAPE in Braunschweig has designed 
some very specific proteins, including an elastase inhibitor and 
a new dehydrogenase that is designed to work on chiral amino 
acids and keto-acids. Jan Pedersen, of the University of Bath, 
reported on the development of software tools for protein 
design, especially of antibodies and antigens. Docking 
algorithms and molecular modelling and simulation allow the 
group to target mutagenesis of specific regions of antibodies. 
  Taking design forward into specific drugs, Ed Hodgkin 
described how his company, British Biotechnology Ltd. in Oxford, 
chases peptide "leads," small regions that play an active part 
in biomolecular interactions, and constructs specific mimetics 
based on them. Peptide libraries are increasingly guiding 
people to those leads, which have so far been used to design 
receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors. Hans-Joachim Boehm, 
of BASF in Ludwigshafen, uses a similar approach, positioning 
new molecules and substituents on a known lead structure. He 
called for more research into methods for "annealing" these new 
ligands and receptors. 
  The final session concerned the forces and dynamics of 
proteins. Jim Warwicker, of the AFRC Institute of Food Research, 
in Reading, outlined methods of estimating and depicting the 
electrostatic surface of proteins, which give insights into 
protein function and may, in future, be used to asses the 
accuracy of estimates of stability and pH response. Manfred 
Sippl, of the University of Salzburg in Austria, explained how 
his work uses the frequency of occurrence of secondary 
structures to calculate force fields for particular protein 
structures. Like Warwicker, Sippl foresees using this kind of 
information to assess and validate protein structures. Rod 
Hubbard, of York University, is trying to speed up computation 
for modelling, for example by simplifying the depiction of side 
chains. Protein 3D co-ordinates can be extracted from published 
stereo pair images of main chains, and many other tools are 
being developed to make it easier to determine structure and to 
model interactions. 
  In all, the meeting was judged a success. It put scientists 
in touch, within and across national borders. It also 
identified a major area for future collaboration: the use of 
comparison and alignment studies to identify protein families. 
There is, however, a need for more exchange of software, and as 
a result of this meeting a directory of available programs will 
probably be made available. One useful suggestion is that the 
various programs be put to work on a small number of common 
structures, to allow an objective assessment of their relative 
capabilities. This may be a project that the SERC's [Science 
and Engineering Research Council] EMBnet node at Daresbury could 
undertake, in collaboration with the EMBL Data Library. More 
post-doctoral visits and exchanges will probably take place 
within the groups, and collaborations will be forged to create 
partnerships for the forthcoming EC Framework programme.

modifying plants so that they can produce large quantities of 
high- polymer fructans. These fructose polymers offer new 
industrial possibilities which were inconceivable using 
conventional glucose polymer starch. The Van der Have refining 
company is investigating whether the production of fructans is 
economically profitable. 
  Fields of sugar beet stretching as far as the eye can see. 
This is how the future looks if we make everything from sugar, 
from phosphate substitutes in detergents to plastics components. 
Theoretically, sugars are cheap raw materials which are easily 
decomposed in the environment. However, one problem is that not 
all sugars are equally suitable for use as building blocks for 
new products. So far, starch, which is easily recoverable, has 
been used with varying degrees of success. Recent results 
obtained by Dr. Sjef Smeekens' research team (Molecular Cell 
Biology research group at the University of Utrecht) bring 
high-polymer fructans within the reach of industry. 
  Smeekens obtained the high-polymer fructans by transferring 
a 
gene from the bacteria Bacillus subtilis to plants. Only a 
limited number of plants produce fructan with a chain length of 
between 10 and a few 100 fructose units. Certain bacteria, 
including types in our oral flora, can easily produce fructans 
consisting of 100,000 units. The genetically engineered plants 
are now equaling this performance. 
  Delft University carbohydrate chemistry Professor Herman van 
Bekkum welcomes this discovery under the motto: "The longer the 
chain, the better. The very fact that you can safely cut up the 
raw material or make derivatives from it gives you far more 
possibilities." 
<H5>  Spin-off </H5>
  The fructan-producing plants came about more or less as a 
spin-off of the fundamental research carried out by Smeekens. 
He investigated how the end products of photosynthesis, such as 
glucose, fructose, and sucrose, are processed by plants. An 
increasing concentration of sugar in the cell may possibly 
inhibit photosynthesis and therefore the growth of the plant. 
By studying the effect of various types of sucrose 
polymerization on photosynthesis, you obtain a clear picture of 
this inhibition. 
  Using genetic engineering, the researchers endow the plant 
cell with enzymes which can produce specific types of sugar 
chains, for example fructans. If a plant is to produce an alien 
sugar chain without problems, it is also important that the 
increase in this chain takes place in the right place (in the 
cytosol, the vacuoles, or in the extra-cellular environment 
itself). To ensure that this happens, the genetic information 
about the storage location of the final sugar chain is 
controlled, as well as the gene which codes for a specific 
polymerization enzyme. By combining these properties, Smeekens' 
group was the first to succeed in making plants produce 
high-polymer sugars. 
  In follow-up research funded by the EC and other 
institutions, Smeekens will delve further into the possibilities 
of the technique. "We want to condition the polymerization 
enzyme in such a way that specific polymerization occurs. This 
means that we can also produce sugars other than fructans. 
Ultimately, we can make any plant produce any sugar." 
<H5>  Scaling Up </H5>
  The SON and STW [Technical Sciences Foundation], which are 
financing the research, have now filed a patent application for 
the principle of producing specific sugars using genetically 
engineered plants. Furthermore, the Zeeland-based Van der Have 
company has bought the operating rights. Research leader Cees 
Noome believes it is now time to select a suitable crop (sugar 
beet or chicory for example), so that the high-polymer fructans 
can be profitably produced. 
  Noome says we will have to wait and see whether a useful 
result will be produced quickly. "Such long-term projects are 
risky because of the many stages involved in producing an ideal, 
stable strain. It will be a few years before we can say we have 
an industrially useful raw material."

<F P=106> [Article by Marcel aan de Brugh: "Dinko Valerio: `There Is </F>
Plenty of Money in the Netherlands for Gene Therapy'"] 
  [Text] "In the end there will be six or seven centers 
worldwide which will carry out gene therapy on a commercial 
basis. Europe will have one of them. And we intend to be that 
European center," said Professor Dr. Dinko Valerio. 
  The director of the recently set up company of Introgene has 
a deep-rooted belief in private enterprise, a positive outlook 
on business that is normally encountered only in America. "Oh, 
the Netherlands are not so different from America, it is just 
that we are not yet convinced of the fact. If you look at the 
matter carefully, we do not have anything to complain about. 
The Netherlands possesses a good climate for research, with a 
long-standing tradition of both medical research and 
biotechnology. During the past few years, more and more 
universities have acquired an entrepreneurial attitude, and the 
government is also showing positive support. The tremendous 
subsidy scheme covering genetic manipulation and gene therapy is 
prove of this. We are wealthy. The possibilities ahead of us 
are enormous." 
  Despite all this praise, the majority of researchers are 
still crossing the Atlantic when they want to set up their own 
company. Valerio does not only see a brain drain in the 
direction of America, but also an entrepreneurial drain. "There 
is a great gap in Europe as far as any commercialization of 
knowledge is concerned. There is as yet no clear 
infrastructure, and financial backers have not yet had much 
experience of risk-carrying initiatives. I want to change all 
that." 
  In America, for instance, it is absolutely normal that a 
venture capitalist should invest in a company, thus giving it a 
chance to grow. The knowledge available and the value of the 
business increase visibly. After a few years, the company 
appears on the stock exchange. It is sold to the public, long 
before it has made even a guilder in profits. The venture 
capitalist receives his investment back with interest, while the 
company has got off the ground. 
  Valerio wants to be able to extract an investment of 1.1 
million Dutch guilders from Atlas Venture, a Netherlands venture 
capitalist, by using this economic maneuver. In addition, he 
will receive a Pioneers' Grant (1.5 million guilders) as well as 
subsidies from the Rotterdam University Hospital and from the 
Ministry of Economic Affairs. 
  Within a short while, Valerio hopes to be able to exchange 
his out-dated laboratory on TNO [Netherlands Central Institute 
for Applied Research] ground in Rijswijk for brand new premises 
on the grounds of Leiden University. From 1996 to 1998 Leiden 
State University (at which Valerio was recently appointed 
professor of gene therapy) will subsidize the university 
research group which Valerio will lead. The new professor can 
then reckon on a subsidy of 2 million guilders. According to 
Valerio, "all the investors concerned are aware that the market 
for gene therapy is not just around the corner. I think that we 
have to wait for at least about eight years for that. 
Fortunately they also understand that the Netherlands could 
become an important center in the field of gene therapy." 
<H5>  Adenosine Deaminase </H5>
  In March of this year Valerio became the first researcher to 
apply gene therapy to a human being. In this case, a French 
child in the Necker Hospital in Paris was treated for ada-scid, 
a disorder of the immune system in which a defect in the gene 
that codes for the adenosine deaminase (ada) enzyme interrupts 
the production of white blood cells. Patients fall prey to all 
kinds of infections from which they can die if not treated. 
  Valerio and his colleagues played a large part in the 
success 
of the operation. They transferred a correct ada gene into 
isolated bone marrow cells from the child. The bone marrow 
cells were then injected back into the body of the patient, the 
intention being that the cells will resume their function and 
produce completely perfect white blood cells. Whether the 
operation will actually produce any results will not be known 
for several months. 
<H5>  On the Way to a Routine Technique </H5>
  While gene therapy was originally seen as a solution for 
hereditary diseases, nowadays researchers also see possibilities 
in such disorders as hepatitis B, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
cancer (of the brain and of the lung, amongst others). All 
kinds of cell types are being considered for the technique: 
muscle cells, lung cells, nerve cells. 
  Valerio's group intends to specialize in gene therapy in 
genealogical cells, and therefore is making use of bone marrow 
cells. "We want to bring the technique to the point that it can 
be routinely applied. We ourselves will probably be involved in 
the treatment of only one, at the most two diseases, as test 
cases for the technique. For other diseases we will eventually 
only deliver the tools. We will make those so simple that 
anyone will be able to work with them."

  [Text] Microsystems engineers at the Munich-based 
Fraunhofer Institute of Solid-State Chemistry, working with 
microbiologists from the University of Regensburg, have 
developed a new HIV test in which a biosensor detects traces of 
the AIDS virus in blood samples. The Fraunhofer Society (FhG) 
has recently announced that the system, which works 
automatically, is ideal for use in mobile units and large test 
batches and is cheaper and faster than conventional detection 
methods. 
  The new process is based on the same test principle as 
previous methods, exploiting the antigen-antibody reaction. 
When a human being becomes infected with the HI-virus, which 
triggers the lethal immune-deficiency disease, AIDS, his or her 
immune system produces specific antibodies to proteins on the 
surface of the pathogen. These proteins are termed antigens. If 
a blood sample is exposed to artificially produced antigens, any 
AIDS antibodies present in the blood will fasten onto them. In 
the conventional enzyme immune test, which takes several hours, 
this bond triggers a change of color. 
  The FhG reports that the new system detects the 
antigen-antibody reaction in only 10 minutes. An injection 
valve feeds the blood sample into a stream of liquid flowing 
through a measuring chamber with a sensitive piezoelectric 
oscillator. An electronic alternating field causes these thin, 
pure quartz platelets, of the type used, for instance, in 
watches and modern digital scales, to vibrate. If anything is 
deposited on the quartz, the oscillation frequency changes, the 
change being recorded by the oscillator and the frequency 
counter. 
  The researchers used gold, to which proteins adhere well, to 
coat the quartz platelets with AIDS virus antigens. As soon as 
HIV antibodies fasten onto the sensor, its mass increases, as 
does its oscillation frequency. It is reported that test 
batches of a thousand samples each can be tested automatically 
with this process. If the AIDS antibody is discovered in one of 
the samples, the apparatus must be cleaned or the piezoelectric 
oscillator changed. The society's report states that all 
previous tests showed a marked difference in response to 
positive and antibody-free serum samples. As the new test is 
basically an offshoot of the conventional detection process, the 
researchers assume that it is equally accurate.

<F P=106> [Article by Franz Miller, Fraunhofer Society, Munich, under </F>
the rubric "Research and Technology": "Immune Diagnostics/Quick 
HIV Test Could Reduce Risk in Blood Transfusions. Sensor Enables 
Testing of Blood Donation As Late As Just Before the 
Transfusion"; first paragraph is an introduction] 
  [Text] Wednesday, 10 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT)--Microsystem 
engineers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solid-State Technology 
(IFT) in Munich together with microbiologists at the Institute 
for Medical Microbiology and Health of Regensburg University 
have developed a new testing method by means of which banked 
blood can be tested for HIV immediately before transfusion. The 
first testing instruments are available as prototypes, but they 
still have to be certified first by the Paul Ehrlich Institute 
before series production. 
  A car accident. The profusely bleeding front-seat passenger 
is taken to the hospital. Diagnosis: just cuts and lacerations, 
which are sutured. But blood transfusions become necessary 
because of heavy loss of blood. The patient, afraid of HIV 
infection, panics. "Don't worry," the doctor reassures, "I am 
now putting a sample of the blood into this testing instrument, 
and in 10 minutes you will be able to see for yourself that the 
banked blood is free of HIV antibodies." This could soon be 
everyday medical practice if the new HIV test goes into 
production. 
<H5>  Up to 1000 Specimens Tested Automatically </H5>
  The heart of the analysis system is a biosensor that detects 
an antigen- antibody reaction. This highly sensitive biological 
sensing device causes any antibody to attach to just its quite 
specific antigen. This is usually described, approximately and 
in simplified fashion, by the lock-and-key principle. If the 
proper antigen is put into the blood specimen and the reaction 
takes place, then this is proof that the antibodies looked for 
are present in the specimen. 
  Antibodies are detectable in the blood of any HIV-infected 
patient several weeks after the infection. The analysis reaction 
just has to be transformed into a visible or other kind of 
signal. Most conventional HIV tests are based on this 
measurement principle and indicate the existence of antibodies 
by means of a change of color. The new HIV test employing a 
biosensor is essentially a further development of the 
conventional tests and is closely similar. However, the enzyme 
immune tests used thus far take several hours, whereas the 
biosensor makes its test result known in 10 minutes. "But this 
quick result cannot be obtained in diagnostic tests, because 
positive test results first have to be confirmed by a second 
independent test," qualifies Professor Hans J. Wolf, a 
microbiologist and director of Regensburg University's Institute 
for Medical Microbiology and Health. 
  The biosensor can produce a substantial cost saving with 
very 
large test quantities and relatively low hit rates--as is 
usually the case in HIV tests: It is not consumed so long as no 
positive specimen appears. No bothersome specimen preparation, 
pipetting, dilution, purification and so forth are required for 
a test. A single compact analyzer is sufficient, in which up to 
1000 specimens are automatically inserted, prepared one by one, 
and, clocked online, pumped through the biosensor measuring 
chamber. 
  The decisive advantage of the biosensor analysis system lies 
in its automated system configuration--and this is the 
trend-setting direction for all advanced test development. The 
complicated handling with the dangerous, in this case 
potentially infectious, specimens was integrated into the 
instrument. Accordingly it is suited not only for serial tests 
at blood banks or other blood-processing establishments, but is 
also plainly cut out for on-site use. So the doctor needs only 
to put the blood specimen into the unit and then the test 
proceeds automatically. 
  That the two so different institutions cooperated 
intensively 
as early as from the first idea--over four and a half years 
ago--was decisive for the scientists' success. There was basic 
preliminary work to do in finding out how microelectronic 
sensors can be coupled with proteins. HIV was chosen as the 
model system from the start. Finally a suitable measurement 
principle was found and investigated and further developed into 
a functioning signal converter for the detection of antibodies. 
<H5>  Quartz Oscillators Convert the Measuring Signal </H5>
  Quartz oscillators--thin wafers made of pure quartz 
crystal--that because of their high reliability are used as 
frequency-, cycle- or time-regulating components are the heart 
of the measuring system. They are found in timepieces, in 
advanced digital scales and also in computers or engine 
controllers. As mass-produced electronic products they are not 
particularly expensive. Quartz oscillators are excited to 
oscillate by means of an electronic alternating field. If 
something is deposited on the quartz oscillator, with the 
increase in mass the frequency also changes. This change is 
detected by an oscillator and frequency counter. 
  Once the measuring principle was functioning, the team dealt 
for a long time with the problem of how biological material can 
be put onto quartz wafers. Unlike other research teams, they 
used gold electrodes here, which permit good adhesion and 
stability of the biological material. Then there was a 
breakthrough too: The hydrophobic interaction between a protein 
and gold surface brings about such good adhesion that the 
proteins are not washed off. 
  Finding suitable antigens for the coating was the job of 
Professor Hans J. Wolf, who has already developed several 
conventional HIV tests and other virus tests. "We know the 
general sequence of the HIV genome, and with the aid of our 
self-developed computer-aided protein analyses selected virion 
envelope regions which we knew are well recognized by the immune 
system of infected patients." These proteins--the regions are 30 
to 40 amino acids long--were produced chemically and tested with 
normal sera. Color reactions indicated whether the sera 
recognize this little piece of the virion envelope. 
  The now finished testing system is based on the flow 
injection principle, which consists of two liquid circuits 
driven by pumps: a circuit in which the specimens are prepared 
and automatically lined up in a waiting loop. An injection valve 
feeds them, precisely timed, into the liquid stream of the 
measuring circuit. The carrier stream constantly flows through 
the measuring chamber containing the sensitive quartz oscillator. 
  The flow-through compartment's geometry is chosen so that 
the 
antibodies come into as good as possible contact with the quartz 
oscillator. The quartz oscillator's mass increases as soon as 
antibodies attach to the quartz oscillator. This is detected and 
the infective specimens are labeled. The quartz oscillator 
employed has to be replaced now. 
  "Every test by the new analysis system presented a clearly 
discernible signal," Professor Hans Wolf reports. The analysis 
system is so sophisticated in terms of medical standards and 
system engineering that it can be transformed into a marketable 
product, he says. However, it still has to be certified by the 
Paul Ehrlich Institute, which should be no problem according to 
Professor Wolf's experience thus far. The time frame for the new 
analytical method's being employed in medicine: three to five 
years.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Laperrousaz: "Medical: Merieux Gives Up </F>
Extraction of Placental Albumin; Genetic Engineering Does Not 
Deliver"--first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction] 
  [Text] Genetically engineered albumin could rule out any 
risk of contamination. But the process is still too costly. 
  The decision made by the Merieux Institute to stop the 
production of placental albumin should logically reawaken 
interest in recombinant albumin obtained through genetic 
engineering. 
  The Merieux Institute, which had set up an original process 
using placentas collected throughout the world, had to stop 
production under the pressure of health authorities. The latter 
are in fact quite concerned about the risk of contamination by 
infectious agents, such as the one that causes the 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome in patients treated with growth 
hormone. 
  In principle, using genetically engineered products will 
rule 
out any risk. The best example of this is precisely the growth 
hormone which, today, is exclusively of genetic origin. Why, 
then, not follow the same path for albumin? 
  Rhone-Poulenc, in collaboration first with Genetica, then 
with Merieux, which since then has joined the group headed by 
Jean-Rene Fourtou, was among the first to think of it. Research 
was even sufficiently advanced to consider applying for an AMM 
[marketing authorization] by 1995-1996. Today, however, the 
group is questioning the feasibility of the process, and the 
project has been put on the backburner. 
  Actually, manufacturing albumin by genetic engineering poses 
a fearsome industrialization problem, in particular at the 
product purification stage. "Compared with other recombinant 
products introduced in recent years, for instance tPA, we are 
working on a quite different scale because the quantities 
involved are much larger and the market price much lower," 
people at Merieux explained. The current world albumin 
production is 250-300 tons, eight percent of which is produced 
by Merieux. The product sells for 18 francs per gram and is used 
in quantities of several hundred grams per dose, whereas a 
recombinant drug sells for several thousand francs per gram but 
is administered in doses measured in micrograms. 
  Does that mean that we should give up all hope of ever 
manufacturing genetically engineered albumin? Will the need for 
maximum security tip the scales in the right direction, as was 
the case for another blood product, the antihemophilic Factor 8, 
the first recombinant version of which was introduced on the 
market this year by the U.S. company Baxter? But it is true that 
this is another product used in infinitesimal doses.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginia Silveira: "Resumption of Space Program"] </F>
  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos--The Brazilian space program has 
received incentives this year [1993] for speeding its 
development of satellites through the use of funds from the 
Federal Government's privatization program. The China-Brazil 
Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) project and the Complete 
Brazilian Space Mission (MECB) have a guaranteed appropriation 
of $85 million for the coming two years. 
  Of that total, about $21 million is already available this 
year for the Chinese-Brazilian project, and another $15 million 
will be available for the period from 1994 to 1996. The first 
portion of the money was advanced by the Bank of Brazil at the 
end of October. The funds were obtained from an agreement signed 
between the Bank of Brazil, the Ministry of Science and 
Technology, and the Funding Authority for Studies and Projects 
(Finep). 
  According to Carlos Santana, manager of the CBERS, release 
of 
the $21 million will make it possible to resume the program by 
contracting with firms to supply the electronic and mechanical 
equipment for the satellites. The National Institute of Space 
Research (INPE), which is developing one-third of the project in 
cooperation with China, has already issued seven invitations to 
bid in order to put together the group of firms that will 
participate in the program. 
  At present, eight firms are working with the INPE on the 
Chinese-Brazilian project. They are: Tecnasa Professional 
Electronics, Elebra Defense and Control Systems, Esca 
Telecommunications, Composite Technology, Aeroelectronics, 
Brazilian Nuclear Industries, Digicon, and Embraer. 
  According to Santana, the new contracts being worked out 
with 
the other firms are concerned with electronic and mechanical 
equipment for the following satellite subsystems: power supply, 
mechanical structure, image transmitter, data collection 
transmitter, antennas, and UHF transmitter. 
  According to manager Santana, Brazilian countertrade in 
connection with the Chinese-Brazilian program this year has made 
it easier to expand the space agreement with China. In the first 
week of November, the two countries signed a new memorandum of 
intent to carry out a joint study of the feasibility of 
communications satellites. 
  According to Santana, the new technological cooperation 
agreement with China also calls for launching a scientific 
satellite, to be built by the INPE, in conjunction with the 
first satellite in the CBERS series in October 1996. The 
Brazilian share of the launching is budgeted at $15 million. 
  The launch contract was signed early this month between the 
INPE, Finep, and China's Great Wall firm. It also includes an 
offset agreement ensuring Brazil of exports in the same amount 
as the deal reached with China. The remote sensing satellites 
will be launched using Great Wall's Long March IV rocket. The 
satellite weighs 1,500 kg and has an estimated useful life of 10 
years. 
  Construction of the scientific satellite, which will be 
carried on board SSR-1, will be financed by Finep and will cost 
a total of $4 million. According to Santana, the satellite will 
use the same technology as that developed for the data 
collection satellite, and its mission will be to conduct 
research in the electromagnetic field of the ionosphere and 
X-rays and gamma rays. 
  Under the terms of the agreement signed with China in 1988, 
Brazil's share of the CBERS program amounts to $50 million, or 
30 percent of the project. It will be up to the INPE to develop 
one of the cameras for the satellite's observation system, the 
flight structure, the mechanical model, and the telemetry and 
communications transponder. 
  The mission of the remote sensing satellites will be to 
photograph the planet for the purpose of observing land use and 
mapping the soil's natural and mineral resources and also to 
sense climatic changes in specific areas. The satellites will 
also make it possible to improve agricultural activities by the 
use of space technology to forecast harvests and planting. 
  The INPE's program to develop satellites is also supported 
by 
a $24.7 million line of credit extended by Finep. That financing 
will be used to pay the firms participating in the satellite 
program, with the funds to be released over the next two years, 
according to Marcio Nogueira Barbosa, director of the INPE. 
  The INPE expects at least 13 contracts to be covered by 
Finep 
financing. According to the timetable for releasing funds from 
that line of credit, the firms already hired and those approved 
in future bidding will receive $7.5 million this year. Another 
$11.1 million is expected in 1994, followed by $6 million in 
1995. 
  According to Barbosa, the funds from Finep will make it 
possible to complete part of the work planned in connection with 
the MECB and the CBERS, which have experienced constant setbacks 
because of delays in paying the firms involved.

<F P=106> [Interview with Amaury Halna du Fretay, President of the </F>
GIFAS [French Aerospace Industries Group] Equipment Group, by 
Jean Dupont; place and date not given: "`The Year 1994 Will Be 
Still More Difficult Than Last Year'"] 
  [Text] 
  [Dupont] Your branch seems to have been relatively spared in 
the 1994 defense budget. Would you say that it will help you 
maintain employment at equipment manufacturers? 
  [Halna du Fretay] As you just said, the 1994 budget shows a 
slight upturn. Unfortunately, it comes after several years when 
it was reduced in current francs. It is a good sign; it shows 
that the government is aware that the situation of our industry 
had become tragically inadequate. For all that, this budget will 
not enable us to solve all employment problems. Our current 
activity also depends on previous years' budget commitments. Our 
feeling is that the year 1994 will be still more difficult than 
last year. There will be still more layoffs, more employment 
adjustment plans, and probably more companies filing for 
bankruptcy. I would like to add that the difficulties raised 
against our prime contractors concerning the implementation of 
employment adjustment plans constitute an incentive for them to 
take back some activities and subcontracting. In other words, 
you prevent layoffs in one place and you create them in another. 
All we can say is that things will not get as much worse in 
1994, with a defense equipment budget of 130 billion francs 
[Fr], as would have been the case if the budget had remained at 
Fr97 billion like last year. 
  [Dupont] Each new program increases self-financing by 
manufacturers, in particular equipment manufacturers. Do you 
feel that you are in a position to make the effort required? 
  [Halna du Fretay] For many French equipment manufacturers, 
the need to provide additional co-financing while sales and 
series production are decreasing and margins getting smaller 
forces them to operate in the red or on the verge of it. For the 
NH-90 program, the financing required of equipment manufacturers 
represents 40 to 100 percent of design and engineering costs. 
All equipment manufacturers are eager to compete for this 
program, especially because there are not that many new 
programs. But some will be unable to keep up with the 
self-financing levels currently considered. In addition, with 
NH-90 we have the quite abnormal situation of a military program 
which may or may not go on to series production. On the other 
hand, the U.S. government pays for 100 percent of military 
research and development! 
  [Dupont] With declining deliveries of new aircraft, fleets 
throughout the world are aging. What are French equipment 
manufacturers doing to seize the opportunities that may arise in 
customer service and modernization? 
  [Halna du Fretay] We can say today that French equipment 
manufacturers have reached the level of their U.S. competitors 
as far as customer service quality is concerned. Besides, since 
the beginning of this decade, the Airbus inventory represents a 
significant part of the world fleet, which now provides us with 
a solid base for customer service. 
  As far as spare parts for older aircraft are concerned, our 
competitors are the "brokers" and we must be at least as good as 
they are; which means that we must offer airlines close-by 
servicing facilities, just as they do. For new-generation 
aircraft, we must increasingly be able to offer overall service 
in the form of maintenance agreements based on flight-time, the 
goal being to free airlines from the burden of maintaining spare 
parts inventories. The same trend can also be observed on export 
military markets, where equipment manufacturers are increasingly 
required to provide these services. That is an additional effort 
that we must make. 
  In another respect, fleet aging does create an emerging 
market among airlines, to improve the operational capacities, in 
particular landing, and the operating costs of their older 
aircraft. As for the modernization of military aircraft, the 
French are already quite well represented on these markets. But 
this will never amount to much and it will not replace domestic 
original-equipment markets. 
  [Dupont] The crisis in the aircraft manufacturing industry 
hit equipment manufacturers before it hit prime contractors. 
Will the recovery also be felt first at equipment manufacturers? 
  [Halna du Fretay] The crisis hit equipment manufacturers 
before prime contractors because spare part markets collapsed 
and original-equipment inventories were reduced, or because 
prime contractors took back some activities. It is very 
difficult to make a forecast as to the recovery of spare parts 
markets. But if prime contractors have actually depleted their 
intermediate product inventories, then I agree that recovery 
might be stronger for us and pose rather difficult problems. In 
some cases, we may even find that suppliers cannot cope because 
they have reduced their activities so much that it will take 
them a very long time to bring back their capacities to 
pre-crisis levels.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont and Nicole Beauclair: "Equipment </F>
Manufacturers on a Lean Diet"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Sales in the branch dropped by nine percent in 1993. 
Employment followed suit, with an eight percent decline. New 
layoffs should affect 10 percent of the personnel next year. 
  "The year 1994 will be still more difficult than last year." 
While giving this warning, Amaury Halna du Fretay, president of 
the GIFAS Equipment Group, is aware that the two leading 
indicators of the future of his branch have stopped 
deteriorating. 
  According to the new government, the defense equipment 
budget, the famous Title 5, was increased by 5.7 percent, to 
Fr103 billion. Although we could argue that this new budget 
conceals a Fr5.5-billion carryover of last year's unused 
appropriations and that, in substance, it is just barely stable 
in current francs, we must acknowledge that, from this point of 
view, France is treating her industry better than her neighbors 
treat theirs. For instance, the British defense equipment budget 
for the year 1993-1994 was cut by 3.7 percent, down to 9.9 
billion pounds (Fr87 billion). As for Germany, its defense 
budget has already been cut by 21 percent since 1991, and will 
be cut by another 2.5 percent next year, dropping to 48.6 
billion German marks [DM] (Fr168 billion). The German government 
decided to cut back the Eurofighter-2000 budget to DM520 million 
instead of the DM820 it had promised or the DM890 deemed 
necessary by German manufacturers participating in the program. 
  The other indicator, that of the Airbus production rate, is 
now stable. The European consortium maintains its 1994 forecast 
at 12 units per month. Still, it would seem that this forecast 
includes future (and therefore hypothetical) orders from the 
Saudia airline. 
  Although the two main indicators of the branch seem to have 
stopped their descent into the red, Amaury Halna du Fretay 
promised "more layoffs, more employment adjustment plans, and 
more companies filing for bankruptcy." This statement is 
paradoxical only at first sight. Actually, the aircraft industry 
is a long-cycle industry. Decisions made today will take several 
years to bear fruit. 
  The government is fully aware of it: It submitted a higher 
Title-5 budget and practically at the same time it announced 
that the nuclear aircraft carrier and, later on, the Rafale 
program, would be delayed by six months as a result of the 
previous government's decision, made in early 1993, to stagger 
budget appropriations. In addition, our neighbors' defense 
budget cuts, far from causing French manufacturers to rejoice, 
raise concerns for all programs carried out with European 
cooperation. 
  Faced with all these uncertainties, the French aircraft 
industry will therefore continue to shorten sails in 1994. This 
trend, which has prevailed for three years now, already brought 
about layoffs in excess of 20 percent at equipment manufacturers. 
  According to the results of our survey involving nearly all 
French equipment manufacturers, it appears that overall sales 
for the branch dropped another nine percent in 1993, i.e. 11 
percent in real terms if we take inflation into account. 
Employment followed suit, although it declined by only eight 
percent. The two indicators differ because manufacturers had 
recourse to partial unemployment and took measures to reduce 
working hours; these now account for nearly five percent of 
working hours. 
  New layoffs are still to be feared. A survey of its members 
made by the GIFAS Equipment Group shows that layoffs should 
affect another 10 percent of the personnel next year. 
<H5>  From Partial Unemployment to Reduced Working Hours </H5>
  Partial unemployment variously affects companies, depending 
on their position in the regional economy and on the level of 
knowhow that must absolutely be retained. In some cases, as at 
ECE [Electrical Equipment and Engineering Company] in Niort, 
partial unemployment this year amounted to the equivalent of 
eight work weeks, which made it possible to maintain employment 
at about 800 people, compared with 850 before the crisis began. 
  A sign that workloads will remain low for a long time is 
that 
a new form of partial unemployment is becoming quite common: 
short-time work. The measure was adopted late in the year at 
Sextant Avionics, Lucas Air Equipment, and Thomson-CSF. In the 
first case, the agreement aims to avoid a third 
employment-adjustment plan involving over 600 jobs. At Lucas Air 
Equipment, 200 jobs were saved by a work-time reduction 
equivalent to 49 days of partial unemployment. At Thomson-CSF, 
1,200 layoffs were postponed. 
  These measures, however, are limited because, in the long 
run, they tend to demotivate employees, lower productivity, and 
lengthen cycles and lead times, as Jacques Barillot-Creuzet, 
president of the GIFAS Equipment Group committee on PMEs and 
PMIs [small to mid-size businesses and industries], explained in 
the interview he gave us. One employer even told us that some of 
his employees, who had problems after two years of reduced 
wages, asked him straight out to end partial unemployment, even 
if that meant layoffs. 
  The financial situation of equipment manufacturers is not 
any 
brighter than their employment situation. During the traditional 
publication of the results of the branch, last May, Jean-Paul 
Bechat, then president of the Equipment Group, recalled that the 
140 companies belonging to his branch were practically all 
operating in the red at the end of the previous year. Nothing 
occurred in 1993 to reverse this trend. 
  Confusion is spreading among equipment manufacturers as they 
receive conflicting signals from the government, prime 
contractors, and the markets. Thus, when programs are staggered 
they must reassess their capacities. When market volume is 
reduced, competition gets stronger and forces them to try and 
increase productivity, which unavoidably leads to new layoffs. 
They are asked to reduce costs and at the same time they learn 
that they will also have to shorten lead times significantly, as 
required by Charles Bigot, the Arianespace CEO [chief executive 
officer] who wishes to reduce his production costs by 23 or even 
30 percent, and to shorten his production cycles by one third 
before Ariane-5 is set into service. 
<H5>  The Thorny Problem of Design and Engineering Financing </H5>
  This confusion turns to griping where new programs are 
concerned. In 1993, the first invitations to bid were issued for 
the equipment of the European helicopter NH-90. When French 
equipment manufacturers read the terms imposed for bidding, they 
were bitterly surprised to learn that they would have to finance 
at least 40 percent of their development costs. "A quite 
abnormal situation," Amaury Halna du Fretay protested, demanding 
that military programs be entirely financed by the State, as 
they are in the United States. 
  In fact, how could equipment manufacturers make this 
additional effort when their series production is so depressed 
and when companies must bear the financial burden of the 
employment-adjustment plans they started in the past two years? 
Jean-Robert Martin, the Sextant Avionics CEO, is concerned by 
the flight forward that might result if equipment manufacturers, 
wishing to position themselves for the future at all costs, were 
soon to face financial difficulties. "Are we trying hard enough 
to reuse things that were already studied or invested in?," he 
asked, adding: "If we want to continue launching many programs 
with small production series, the solution may just be to 
retrofit existing equipment." 
  The situation of aircraft equipment manufacturers is far 
from 
uniform throughout the branch. The eight major companies 
(Thomson-CSF, Sextant, Messier-Bugatti, Dassault Electronics, 
SAGEM-SAT [Company for General Applications of Electricity and 
Mechanics-Telecommunications Company], Hispano-Suiza, SFIM 
[Measuring Instruments Manufacturing Company], and 
Intertechnique), whose aerospace sales exceed Fr1 billion per 
year, saw their 1992 sales in the sector increase by 4.3 
percent. However, we should not trust appearances: Their growth 
is essentially due to takeovers, and it reflects the first of 
the consolidations that continued in 1993. Mid-size equipment 
manufacturers (those with sales ranging from Fr100 million to 
Fr1 billion) regressed by more than 10 percent. As for the 
smaller ones (less than Fr100 million in sales), they saw their 
invoiced sales drop by a clear 18.8 percent. 
<H5>  Marriage of Convenience </H5>
  Hurel-Dubois (Mixed Shipping Company) was the first one to 
engage in a large-scale operation; during the last days of 1992, 
it announced its alliance with the North-Irish Shorts company 
(Bombardier group). The consolidated sales of the nacelle and 
thrust-reverser activities of the two companies, which merged to 
form the GEIE [European economic interest group] International 
Nacelle Systems (INS), amount to some $180 million (over Fr1 
billion). According to Jacques Marchand, the GEIE president, the 
main responsibilities of INS will be to market and sell nacelle 
systems as a single supplier, to coordinate the technical and 
industrial activities of the two parent companies, and to 
provide customer support. Relying on agreements signed before 
its creation, INS just achieved a first success, after one year 
of existence, when it signed an agreement with the Spanish 
company Gamesa, covering the design, development, and production 
of nacelles for the Allison GMA30007 engine that will equip the 
EMB145 aircraft of the Brazilian company Embraer. Estimated 
value of the contract: $170 million. 
  Another important player in the nacelle field is 
Hispano-Suiza which created the Euronacelle company in September 
1992, together with the Italian company Alenia; it announced its 
intention to form a partnership with the U.S. company Grumman 
for the specific purpose of working on the Eurofan nacelle. 
That, Raymond Poggi, the French company's CEO, indicated, should 
throw back into question Hispano-Suiza and Alenia's mode of 
cooperation, without for all that breaking off relations between 
the two companies. 
  Landing gears were not spared by the wave of partnerships 
and 
restructuring. Last June, Messier-Bugatti and its British 
competitor Dowty (which recently joined the international group 
TI) announced their desire to create a European landing-gear 
pole. It was officially created on 2 December 1993 when SNECMA 
[National Company for Aircraft Engine Study and Manufacturing] 
and the TI group signed an agreement providing for the merger of 
the landing-gear activities of their respective subsidiaries, 
Messier-Bugatti and Dowty. If the creation of Messier-Dowty is 
approved by the shareholders of both companies and by national 
and community authorities, the new company will achieve close to 
Fr2.5 billion in sales and it will control 41 percent of the 
world landing-gear market. 
  In the middle of the summer, observers were alerted when 
Sextant Avionics shares stopped being quoted on the stock 
exchange. Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale, the two largest 
shareholders of the leading French avionics manufacturer, were 
preparing a large-scale operation. Thomson-CSF acquired a 
two-third controlling interest in Sextant, Aerospatiale retained 
a blocking minority interest of 33.4 percent, and both want an 
alliance between their subsidiary and the U.S. giant 
AlliedSignal. 
  The joint venture is expected to be set up by the end of 
this 
year [1993]; it will join the civil avionics activities of 
AlliedSignal and Sextant, in the civil and in the military 
sector. It will boasts sales close to Fr8 billion. This 
rapprochement follows an implacable logic. To ensure the 
viability of its civil activities, Sextant must absolutely sell 
to U.S. aircraft manufacturers, but it cannot do so because of 
the Aerospatiale label it is stuck with. Bendix/King, the brand 
under which AlliedSignal markets its avionics, is increasingly 
edged out by its two U.S. competitors, Rockwell-Collins and 
Honeywell, which both operate in the more buoyant cockpit and 
tracking-system subsector. 
  As the year ends, a great name among simulator manufacturers 
disappears. The English company Rediffusion, exhausted after 
several restructuring plans that saw its personnel shrink from 
3,000 to 1,400, is throwing in the towel. Thomson-CSF, which 
already took over another English company (Link-Miles) in the 
same sector three years ago, offered to take over Rediffusion. 
If it can get the official authorizations required to do so, 
Thomson-CSF will be able to increase its sale of simulators to 
nearly Fr3 billion, becoming the second-ranking company 
worldwide after the Canadian CAE, with a simulator catalog 
covering the entire range of 100-seaters and larger aircraft of 
the western world. 
  Alain Gomez, the Thomson-CSF CEO, keeps looking toward 
England where his sonar-manufacturing partner, Ferranti, is 
threatened with liquidation. GEC-Marconi, who wanted to take 
over the last activities still controlled by this former jewel 
of British high technology, gave up its plans when it met with 
the fierce resistance of Ferranti shareholders; the company is 
now totally bankrupt and was just placed in receivership. 
Thomson-CSF, which enjoys a preemption right in the 
Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems joint-venture, is also said to 
consider an alliance in this field with GEC-Marconi. This would 
result in the creation of a group with Fr4 billion in sales, 
which would become the leading sonar manufacturer, ahead of IBM. 
  Mergers also multiplied in France. Early in February, MATRA 
[Mechanics, Aviation, and Traction Company] merged its 50-50 
MS2I [Matra-SEP Imaging and Information Science] subsidiary, the 
champion of satellite-image processing, with Cap Sesa Defense, a 
subsidiary of the Cap Gemini Sogeti group specialized in 
information and command systems. The new company is called Matra 
Cap Systems (MCS); it boasts sales worth Fr900 million and 
expects to grow by five percent per year, buoyed by one of the 
last defense market that are still developing: that of defense 
and imagery data-processing systems. 
<H5>  Market Shares Only </H5>
  Edmond Marchegay, the Intertechnique CEO, relies on the war 
chest he amassed already four years ago, when he sold his IN2 
data-processing company. It already served to finance the 
takeover of ECE in 1990. In 1993, Intertechnique took over 
Ferma, a hyperdynamic small to mid-size voice-server 
manufacturer that lacked equity capital. But Edmond Marchegay 
will not stop there; he announced that he was considering taking 
over three more companies. However, as a sign that the capacity 
of the industrial base has really become too large compared with 
aeronautical markets, this time Edmond Marchegay wants to take 
over market shares only. 
  In September, SODERN [Nuclear Research and Development 
Company], which belongs to the Philips group, also consolidated 
its activities by taking over one of its suppliers of aerospace 
optic systems, the Cerco company. According to its CEO, Henri 
Dugre, the objective is to maintain SODERN, which was hard hit 
by the slowdown of nuclear and space programs, at about its 
ideal size, with sales of Fr270 million. This is a prerequisite 
in order to preserve the future of this jewel of French high 
technology, which exports its satellite attitude sensors even to 
Japan. 
  In last year's special issue on equipment, we noted that a 
takeover wave had shaken the United States: General Dynamics was 
taken over by Lockheed; the electronic activities of GE merged 
into Martin Marietta; LTV ended up belonging to Loral. This 
year, as can be seen, the shock wave reached Europe. 
  All the same, you will note that, in adversity, large 
companies are the ones which actively consolidate their 
operations. Small companies seem to be on their guard and, as a 
manager told us, still hope to hold out until the crisis kills 
their weaker competitors. In this game, there will have to be 
losers, and it looks as if some players have not yet taken the 
full measure of the present crisis, which is here to stay. 
<H3>  Interview With Mr. Jacques Barillot-Creuzet, President of 
the GIFAS PME-PMI Committee: "Some PMEs Lost 50 Percent of Their 
Sales" </H3>
  [Dupont] Is employment hit harder in PMEs and PMIs than at 
prime contractors? 
  [Barillot-Creuzet] It is difficult to give statistics 
because 
the PME base is highly diversified. But many of our members lost 
40 to 50 percent of their sales in the past two years. Jobs 
reflect that fact, even when companies try to preserve them and 
maintain knowhow through partial unemployment. But this leads to 
a demotivation of employees, lower productivity, and longer 
cycles and lead times. 
  [Dupont] What efforts do you make, on export markets or 
through diversification, to make up for the decline of domestic 
markets? 
  [Barillot-Creuzet] PMEs have limited self-financing 
capacities, which makes it difficult for them to diversify 
successfully. They are often blamed for not taking advantage of 
the prosperity of the late eighties to diversify. But you should 
recall that at the time they were under such pressure to shorten 
lead times and increase production rates that it was materially 
impossible for them to turn to other markets. PMEs have reduced 
chances on export markets because of the unavowed protectionism 
practiced by all countries. In addition, the compensation 
mechanisms included in the large contracts awarded to prime 
contractors sometimes force the latter to take back products 
that were developed by their French associates and entrust them 
to foreign companies. Therefore, it takes a lot of financial 
strength to obtain financing for all or part of development 
costs or to generate openings on export markets. 
  [Dupont] What is your reaction to the present situation, 
where support for R&amp;D occurs at the expense of series 
contracts? 
  [Barillot-Creuzet] Only a very small part of R&amp;D 
budgets goes 
to PMEs. Unfortunately, that is a French practice. The United 
States took advantage of their strong growth in the late 
eighties to grade their base of subcontractors and small 
equipment manufacturers according to whose knowhow was deemed 
critical. Here, it was the crisis that eliminated the weakest. 
We deplore the fact that there was no industrial logic behind 
all that. 
  [Dupont] What do you think of state measures taken to limit 
layoffs at prime contractors? 
  [Barillot-Creuzet] Clearly, these measures result in a 
transfer of our jobs to prime contractors, as the latter take 
back workloads. Actually, these measures just shift the problem 
to make it less conspicuous, but probably at the expense of our 
economic and eventually our social best interest. 
  [Dupont] What about the increased frequency of filings for 
bankruptcies? 
  [Barillot-Creuzet] Some companies now view filing for 
bankruptcy as a management method, with the sole objective of 
maintaining their workloads by cutting prices. This sometimes 
leads commercial courts, which are concerned about employment in 
their regions, to liquidate all the debts of these companies in 
order to encourage takeovers. That generates unfair competition, 
which may lead to economic, industrial and social imbalances.

<F P=106> [Article by Wilfried Klapprott: "Joint Ventures Give SNI A </F>
Boost In Eastern Europe -- There Was Little Activity before the 
Change;" first paragraph is COMPUTER ZEITUNG introduction] 
  [Text] Unlike other European firms in the IT [information 
technology] sector, Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems AG (SNI) 
does not have a traditional presence on eastern European 
markets. Nevertheless, the company achieved a turnover of some 
50 million German marks [DM] there in the 1991/92 fiscal year. 
  Heinz Nixdorf, the dominant patriarch of the former Nixdorf 
Computer AG while he was alive, would not hear of contacts with 
the East. At an international Cebit press conference he called 
the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] a "shit country" [as 
published], and he thought just the same about other nations in 
eastern Europe. He therefore did no business with the East. 
The COCOM [Coordinating Committee for East-West Trade Policy] 
rules also obliged Siemens AG to exercise restraint in its IT 
business, and the only remarkable activities it developed before 
the eastern markets opened up were in the rail transport and 
telecommunications sectors in the former Czechoslovakia. 
  But immediately after the reunification Siemens Nixdorf 
Eastern Europe GmbH (SNO) was set up in Dresden with the aim of 
"meeting the demands and requirements of industry and society in 
the reformed states of central and eastern Europe and central 
Asia in the best possible way." It currently employs about 300 
people, coordinating the activities of the regional agencies it 
has had in Moscow, Prague and Warsaw since 1990 and in Almaty 
(Kazakhstan) and Kiev (Ukraine) since 1992. This year an office 
was also opened in Bratislava, Slovak Republic. Most of the 
staff of the regional establishments are nationals. 
  SNO offers the entire range of SNI products and services. 
Investments in services and partnerships are to the fore in 
almost all new business. For example, SNO is cooperating with 
national companies in production, development, sales, service 
and training in order to meet the specific national IT 
requirements in the best possible way. According to SNO, the 
promotion of partnerships is also "intended to contribute to 
value creation in the country." 
  With Russian partners SNO has developed the Polis police 
information system to national specifications, based on similar 
systems in Germany and other European countries. Polis is being 
introduced at central, regional and municipal levels in Russia. 
A follow-up order has already been received from Kazakhstan. A 
contract has been signed with the Ministry of the Interior under 
which police offices in Kazakhstan's 23 regions will be equipped 
with a total of 700 video terminals. In addition to the 
hardware and software, training and after-sales service will 
also be provided. Installation will begin before the end of 
1993 and will be completed in three years. An SNI mainframe 
with the BS2000 operating system will handle data management and 
data security at police headquarters in Almaty. Middle-power 
range Sinix systems operate as communications servers in a 
country-wide network, while PC's or workstations are used as 
video terminals. Among other things, Polis includes a 
relational database and optical archiving and image processing 
components. The Kazakhstan police will use it as an information 
and investigation system and for processing cases. 
  SNO is also cooperating with the NIZEVT Computer Technology 
Scientific Research Institute in Moscow. At an investment cost 
of DM3 million and with a significant input from NIZEVT staff, 
SNO has developed a migration concept from "Eser" (uniform 
system of electronic computer technology in the former CMEA 
[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] area) to BS2000 and set 
up a demonstration computer center. 
<H5>  Earlier Siemens Contacts Helpful </H5>
  In the Czech Republic SNO is benefiting from the 
comparatively favorable free-market conditions and earlier 
Siemens contacts in the telecommunications sector. Among 
others, a project has been carried out for the foreign insurance 
section of Czech Insurance with the VESYS program package, using 
an SNI H60 system. The Czech social insurance is also going for 
SNO/SNI, and has had 97 Sinix MX300-60 systems with a total of 
1500 PC workstations installed in its branch offices. SNO is 
undertaking automatic passenger handling for the Czech State 
Railway CD; five years ago Siemens-Nixdorf technology was used 
to automate freight wagon circulation for the then Czechoslovak 
State Railway. SNO has supplied the Slovak Republic's largest 
bank, the General Credit Bank Bratislava, with 70 automatic 
teller machines, connected online to the authorization center in 
Bratislava. 
  SNO is paying particular attention to basic and advanced 
training for its own and its clients' personnel. Besides 
imparting basic knowledge wherever SNI systems are installed, 
SNO says it is also offering courses in software development, 
data communications, marketing, management and work methods, 
basic business management, and foreign languages, among others. 
SNO is also setting up training centers where major potential 
customers are located, mainly to provide software training in 
the respective national languages. In some cases training is 
also given at its own training center in the West or in 
cooperation with foreign educational establishments. 
  Over DM4 million have been invested in the Moscow training 
center. It now has four rooms available for a total of 80 
trainees. Mostly, courses are given on the MS-DOS and Unix/Sinix 
system management, the BS2000 system administration, and network 
management. There are 60 types of courses in all. In addition, 
special courses for particular projects or clients are arranged 
when required. 
  The range of services offered is also extensive. It consists 
of four complex units, within which clients can select modules 
to suit their requirements. The units are: system servicing, 
security systems, infrastructure, networks, and additional 
services which cover also other firms' hardware and software 
used in conjunction with SNI products. Whether in planning, 
execution, training or service, in all fields SNO cooperates 
with partners and potential clients to identify their specific 
requirements. They are explicitly seeking to avoid grafting on 
ready-made western solutions.

<F P=106> [Article by Nicole Beauclair: "N-Star's First Giant </F>
Reflector Has Left Mureaux"] 
  [Text] Under a contract signed with its associate 
Space Systems/Loral [SS/Loral], Aerospatiale Espace &amp; Defense 
[Aerospatiale E &amp; D] has produced one of the Japanese N-Star 
satellite's major pieces of equipment: the Ku/S [shaped-beam] 
antenna's 4.5 m X 2.6 m reflector. 
  "We had never before gone this far in the fabrication of 
antenna shaped-profile reflectors," says Alain Noir, head of the 
N-Star operational group in Aerospatiale Espace &amp; Defense's 
Mureaux plant. The largest "shaped-surface" reflector 
Aerospatiale E &amp; D had ever produced heretofore had not 
exceeded 
2.2m in diameter. The actual size of the reflector for the 
N-Star satellite's Ku and S frequency bands antenna measures 
4.5m by 2.6m, for a design objective of 3.5m by 2.6m. 
  In addition to this reflector for the Ku/S antenna, the 
terms 
of the contract signed in May 1992 (see AIR &amp; COSMOS no. 
1375, 
p. 44) also call for Aerospatiale E &amp; D to design and build 
the 
reflector for the C and S frequency bands antenna. The 
design-objective size of the opening of the latter reflector is 
3.25m by 2.6m. It is a parabolic reflector, the first unit of 
which is to be delivered at the same time as the shaped-profile 
reflector. The contract calls for six reflectors in all, 
including four flight models for Japan's two N-Star satellites A 
and B, ordered by NTT from SS/Loral. These two satellites are to 
be launched by Ariane in April and Oct 1995. 
  The N-Star satellite is of the 4-4.5 metric ton class. 
Designed to cover Japan's complex communications needs, it had 
to have an optimized zone of coverage. It was therefore decided 
to substitute a single-source for a multiple-source approach, 
and to develop a shaped-beam antenna that would provide ground 
coverage in the form of a string bean, covering the entire and 
only the entire Japanese archipelago. Practically speaking, the 
satellite thus beams down solely on Japan and concentrates its 
entire power on its targets. 
  To obtain this optimal coverage, the surface of the Ku and S 
bands reflector cannot be uniform as in the case of parabolic 
antenna reflectors. Its surface is a complex of hills and 
valleys. With reference to a paraboloid as a base, its hills 
(bumps) may swell to heights up to +20.3 mm, and its valleys 
(hollows) descend to depths of -40.64 mm. This configuration 
also greatly simplifies the electronics of the satellite's 
antenna. 
  Aerospatiale at Mureaux designed and developed the reflector 
on the basis of SS/Loral's specifications, with due attention to 
all criteria: dimensioning of the reflector by modeling; 
computation by the finite-element method; thermal constraints 
(the reflector must retain its exact shape--between -185C 
and +134C--throughout the life of the satellite); etc. 
  Given the above-mentioned criteria and weight requirements, 
the choice of materials had to be made from the outset, 
  The shell of the reflector consists of a thin reflecting 
skin, 6.35 mm thick, a honeycomb weave of Kevlar (beehive), and 
a second skin made of carbon. Stiffeners arranged in a 
crisscross pattern serve to strengthen the assembly. These 
stiffeners also consist of a sandwiched structure of thin layers 
of carbon and artificial fiber in a honeycomb weave. The 
reflector is consolidated by an autoclave curing process. 
  It might have been thought that the shaped profile of this 
reflector is obtained by molding the reflecting layer over an 
evolutional profile of the honeycomb weave. This is by no means 
the case. Not wishing to divulge too many of the technological 
elements of Aerospatiale E &amp; D's know-how in the field of 
reflectors, Alain Flechais, head of the Technical Directorate's 
Space Products Department, emphasized the production cost gains 
resulting largely from the method adopted. The differences in 
surface levels are obtained by molding the carbon layers, and 
placing the honeycomb weave directly over a mold having the 
shape of the reflector. This tooling, a shaped mold made of 
Invar, was designed by Aerospatiale E &amp; D. Given the size of 
the 
reflector, Aerospatiale E &amp; D chose to have it fabricated by 
Framatome. 
  Prior to its delivery to SS/Loral, scheduled for Monday 29 
November, the Ku and S bands reflector underwent numerous tests: 
weight of 25 kg; three-dimensional check; verification of shape, 
whose precision attained a quadratic mean value of 0.25 mm; 
stiffness; frequency of the primary mode of 33 Hz; thermal 
specifications; etc. These tests were conducted at the Mureaux 
Plant as well as at the Cannes Division. But this reflector, the 
first flight model to be delivered to SS/Loral, has already made 
a round trip for its initial tests by the prime contractor for 
the satellite. The delivery of this first flight model, the size 
of which is still unequalled elsewhere, attests meaningfully to 
Aerospatiale E and D's qualifications as a space equipment 
manufacturer. Delivery of the second flight-model unit is 
already being programmed for May 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Guichardaz: "Southeast Asia: An El </F>
Dorado where French Businesses Must Prove Themselves"--first 
paragraph is LE MONDE INFORMATIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] Very few PMEs [small to mid-size companies] have 
durably succeeded on the Asiatic market, although that market is 
booming. Criticism--failure to meet deadlines, overall lack of 
professionalism--added to difficulties in obtaining help account 
for their inconspicuous presence. 
  What is it that drives to Asia French PMEs like Ilog, an 
SSII 
[data-processing services and engineering company] specialized 
in software engineering which just set up a subsidiary in 
Singapore, or Gemplus, the smart card leader which has been 
operating in Singapore for four years and is now opening an 
office in China? "We are aware of the French market limitations. 
International markets, especially the Asiatic market, are a 
matter of survival for us," Edouard Efira, the Ilog assistant 
general manager, assured. If they relocate, therefore, it is not 
to benefit from lower labor costs at the expense of French 
workers, but because they are determined to gain market shares 
in Asia. 
  Actually, most countries in the region have the advantage 
not 
only of experiencing economic booms, but also of being perfectly 
solvent. Just a few figures will illustrate the existence of a 
sort of Asiatic El Dorado. Whereas, according to the OECD, the 
seven major western industrialized countries are expected to 
record 1993 growth rates in the +2.6 to -1.9 percent range, the 
World Bank reported 12-percent growth for Communist China in 
1992; according to Chinese sources, growth should reach 13.5 
percent in 1993. As for the other countries in the region 
(Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, and Thailand), the World Bank stressed that no group 
of countries ever experienced such a high growth rate within 30 
years: 5.5 percent on the average between 1960 and 1990. 
  Yet, less than three percent of French foreign trade is with 
the "three Chinas" (Communist China, Taiwan, Hong Kong). Apart 
from the French giants in the electronics sector (Alcatel, 
Bull-Zenith, Thomson), French presence is limited to a few 
enterprising PMEs (Ilog, Gemplus, OST [Observatory of Science 
and Technology], Pact Group, Lisa Engineering, etc.), which are 
usually well positioned in their subsectors and quite determined 
to expand all over Asia. Thus Ilog, the leading European 
supplier of object-oriented development tools, which possesses a 
technological lead in constraint-oriented programming, has made 
a remarkable breakthrough in Singapore, especially in government 
offices. "We expect our sales in the region to increase from 4 
million francs [Fr] now to Fr40 million in four to five years," 
Edouard Efira disclosed. 
  As for Gemplus, it achieved Fr30 million in sales with 
significant projects such as the electronic wallet credit card 
it implemented jointly with a Japanese partner, a Singapore 
bank, Visa International, and the U.S. company Verifone. The 
price of success for the French company was that South Koreans 
and Taiwanese asked for licensing agreements, for which they are 
prepared to pay a high price... no doubt in order to be able to 
compete with Gemplus later on. The problem, therefore, consists 
in knowing how to manage what is transferable and what is not. 
"For the time being, we have not yet made any technology 
transfers," we were told by Eric Alzai, a former manager of 
Gemplus Technology Asia. 
  The two French PMEs have one thing in common: They have 
practically no competitors on location, and their markets are 
buoyant. "The more sophisticated the PME's subsector, the 
greater its chances of success, because when it comes to 
standard products Asiatic countries are hard to beat," according 
to Eric Alzai. It is not by chance that they both chose 
Singapore as an operating base: the island offers a high 
technological level, international trade experience, and a very 
western-like culture, especially in legal matters. Moreover, the 
majority of its population is Chinese, which helps penetration 
into Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Communist China. "Actually, these 
markets are linked. For instance, Taiwan is the leading investor 
in Communist China," people at Ilog pointed out. 
<H5>  A Certain Lack of Professionalism </H5>
  For all that, these successes may well be the exceptions 
that 
confirm the rule concerning the presence of French PMEs in Asia. 
"Last September, a Philippine mission came to Paris, looking for 
opportunities to work together with French companies in the 
software field. Since these companies did not respond, the 
Filipinos turned to the Germans and the British. It is a pity 
because, with the high-speed train in Korea, Ariane and the 
subway, France has a good technological image in these 
countries," people at the Paris Chamber of Commerce regretted. 
"Geographic and cultural distance, but also our companies' lack 
of professionalism account for this lack of a French presence in 
Asia," according to Elisabeth Landemaine of the Financial 
Company for Asia. Actually, French businessmen are often 
perceived as people who do not approach markets in a 
professional manner, who do not meet deadlines. Their lack of 
fluency in the English language can also prove a serious 
handicap. "If the only English-speaking individual in a PME 
happens to be out when the Asiatic partner faxes a letter, he 
will not get an answer until that individual is back, which is 
very detrimental," Nadia Gourievidis, head of the Asean 
department at the Paris Chamber of Commerce, observed. 
  Besides, some French banks and organizations such as COFACE 
[French Foreign Trade Insurance Company] (State insurance 
against export-related risks) are said not to be very eager to 
help PMEs. "We had a lot of trouble obtaining prospection 
insurance from COFACE and discounting facilities on our invoices 
from our bank," the managers of an SSII told us. 
  In spite of these obstacles, it is possible to succeed, like 
Ilog and Gemplus who received little or no help from the French 
government or from major French groups already on location. "You 
must not hesitate to go on location to study the market, to 
write your commercial documents in English, to project a very 
professional image, to provide thorough information on your 
products, and above all to find good partners because, in Asia, 
the more middlemen you have, the better your image," Eric Alzai 
confided. But the supreme quality to succeed is perseverance. 
"You must show that you are settling down for good," Edouard 
Efira concluded.

  [Text] Naples. The science park projects will be launched 
by the end of January. The announcement was made by Aldo 
Romano, Science and Technology Park Committee Coordinator for 
the Ministry of Scientific Research, at a meeting held to 
commemorate the 70th anniversary of the CNR [National Research 
Council]. By the end of the year, the organizations whose 
proposals have been selected will be required to submit their 
general projects and the committee will see to launching the 
programs immediately after. 
  Ministry of Scientific and Technological Research 
Undersecretary Silvia Costa stated that the selection of 
organizations that had requested funding had been very severe 
and only 10 out of the 31 proposals presented have been 
considered "buildable" projects. Undersecretary Costa also 
explained that no facilities will be built to house the research 
and manufactuirng activities, but that there will be 
coordination among all the research institutes and companies 
connected with them. If projects that necessarily call for the 
construction of laboratories and plants are presented, these 
will be examined very carefully by the committee. 
  The Ministry for Extraordinary Interventions in Southern 
Italy had already allocated 1.1 trillion lire, 300 billion of 
which just for the start up phase.

<H5>  Principal Observations and Recommendations </H5>
  This fifth report of the TGE Council affords an opportunity 
to review trends in past spending and outlays planned over the 
course of the next few years for TGEs already in existence or 
still under construction. It also contains recommendations on 
certain projects which the Council examined in detail in 1992. 
  For future budgets, as for the budget adopted in 1992, CNRS 
has distinguished between companion appropriations and the 
budgets proper of GANIL [Large National Heavy Ion Accelerator] 
and Saturne. This methodology, which conforms to that practiced 
by the ministry and other agencies, significantly affects the 
figures in the following tables. 
<H5>  General Observations </H5>
<H5>  Developments in 1991-1992 </H5>
  Expenditures for TGEs, exclusive of personnel costs, totaled 
2,150 million French francs [Fr] in 1992; the corresponding 
figure for 1991 was Fr2,000 million (cf. 1992 report). Thus, 
absolute spending (without adjusting for inflation) increased by 
7.5 percent. 
  Although CNRS outlays remained practically unchanged (cf. 
Table 2), CEA's dropped sharply (-94 million) by reason of 
serious budgetary problems in 1992. The net increase [i.e. for 
TGEs] was due principally to the space sector (+147 million for 
CNES) and to the Fr38 million voluntary contribution made to 
CERN, without which spending in that category would have 
remained unchanged. 
  The apparent decline of personnel outlays (Fr926 million in 
1992 versus Fr965 million in 1991) is due solely to a change in 
the method used by IN2P3 to determine the sums allocated to 
TGEs: The old method added in both the budgets proper of the TGE 
facilities and the primarily personnel-related expenditures 
allocated to the laboratories. These latter are now more 
correctly included under companion appropriations (see part 
three of this report). 
<H5>  1993-1992 Compared </H5>
  Nonpersonnel outlays rose from Fr2,150 million in 1992 to 
Fr2,328 million in 1993. The Fr178 million increase (up 8.3 
percent) is again due primarily to the steady growth of space 
programs (+ 157 million), especially ENVISAT-1, but in lesser 
degree to restoration of the CEA budget to its previous level 
(+20 million, principally for Super Torus). Start-up costs for 
Project VIRGO are responsible for the Fr32 million augmentation 
of CNRS's budget. Absolute spending on personnel was unchanged 
at about Fr925 million. 
<H5>  Post-1993 Projections </H5>
  Nonpersonnel spending is programmed to increase by Fr115 
million between 1993 and 1994 (from 2,328 million to Fr2,443 
million). For the first time in many years, the augmentation is 
not due to space programs, which are slated only for moderate 
growth (+20 million). CNRS outlays are scheduled for a 
substantial increase (+53 million), primarily because of Project 
VIRGO (+59 million), the agency's other programs remaining at 
the previous level or even declining, as in the case of ILL 
[Laue Langevin Institute], which is down Fr13 million in light 
of new accords between the three partners. Should construction 
of the LHC at CERN not get under way in 1994, the authorization 
in the CERN budget for this project (about Fr60 million) will be 
reviewed. 
  For out-years, no growth in spending is programmed (Fr2,455 
million in 1995), which leaves little room for discretionary 
spending to launch new projects--especially on the part of CNRS, 
whose projected budgetary needs for 1995 (Fr298 million) are 29 
percent greater than for 1992 (Fr231 million). Though outlays by 
the individual institutions were not itemized, simultaneous 
financing of all projects currently on the drawing boards at 
CNRS and CEA (GANIL-Plus, the 15-GeV [billion electron volts] 
European electron accelerator), Orpheus-Plus, the SOLEIL 
synchrotron radiation source, [particle] detectors for the LHC, 
etc.) seems out of reach, even if the Saturne project is 
discontinued. Choices must be made. 
<H5>  Long-term Trends (Nonspace) </H5>
  If one calculates the growth of nonpersonnel expenditures, 
excluding outlays entailed by the space programs of CNES and 
CEA, the diminution of real spending for the TGEs, first seen in 
1992, continues in 1993 as shown in the following table: 



  Table 1: Nonpersonnel Outlays for Non-Space-Related TGEs 

(millions of French francs) 

Year     1988     1989     1990     1991     1992     1993     1994     1995     1996

Constant 1993 francs 


  In current francs, five-year growth from 1988 to 1992 is 
only 
10.2 percent, or two percent per year on average, significantly 
less than inflation, as shown in the second line of Table 1. The 
spending level for 1993 will be very close to the 1992 level, 
i.e. no increase. Projections for 1994 offer the hope of some 
renewed growth in allocations for non-space-related TGEs, 
principally as a result of an expanded VIRGO program. 
  The stagnation of (non-space-related) TGE spending seen in 
the last few years is due to several factors: 


    -  the commitment of certain agencies such as CNRS 
[National Scientific Research Center] to rein in growth of TGEs 
and wait several years before launching new projects; 
  -  limitations--indeed, reductions in the case of the CEA--in 
the 
financial resources at the disposal of the various institutions; 
  -  the small number of new projects that have come to full 
maturity in the last few years; 
  -  the large share of new research funds earmarked for space 
programs. 

    As in reports for previous years, it is interesting to note 
(Table 2) the changing ratio of nonpersonnel TGE-related 
spending to total research ministry program authorizations in 
the budget bill for CNRS and CEA, two agencies heavily involved 
with TGEs.

  [Text] The previous relative growth in the percentage 
earmarked for 
TGE-related expenses has stopped in both agencies: 


    -  in CNRS, TGE spending has been virtually constant since 
1990, and its share of total program authorizations has declined 
slightly; 
  -  in CEA, 1992 was marked by a sharp reduction both in program 
authorizations and in TGE-related expenditures. Although the 
ratio does not change for 1993, the figures in both categories 
are somewhat higher.

  Table 3 shows that between 1988 and 1993, TGE-related 
spending in the space domain enjoyed substantial growth (close 
to 11 percent per year on average, though with pronounced 
fluctuations). This growth corresponded to a clearly declared 
budget priority. However, augmentations in actual outlays were 
not as sharp as the annual CNES [National Space Studies Center] 
program proposals would have suggested: Significant 
reprogramming was necessary, in particular for Topex-Poseidon 
and ERS-2, as seen in the tables presented in the Council's 
reports for 1991 and 1992. Projections for the next few years 
for already-approved projects suggest a certain stagnation in 
spending. 
<H5>  TGE Spending Share </H5>
  To calculate the ratio of investments in scientific TGEs to 
total spending on civilian research, the ratio between the 
following two quantities can be evaluated: 


    -  total nonpersonnel spending for scientific TGEs; 
  -  total sum of program authorizations in the BCRD [Civilian 
Research and Development Budget] plus ordinary foreign ministry 
appropriations earmarked for BCRD (these latter principally 
cover contributions to CERN, ESO, and EMBL [European Molecular 
Biology Laboratory].

<H5>  Remarks and Recommendations </H5>
<H5>  Project VIRGO </H5>
  In May 1992 the director general of CNRS submitted to the 
Council the Franco-Italian VIRGO proposal to build a gravity 
wave detection antenna. 
  VIRGO is an experimental research project in the field of 
fundamental physics, completely new, and strongly 
multidisciplinary in terms both of implementation and expected 
results. 
  The Council first reviewed the proposal in April 1990. At 
that time, it noted its interest in the scientific objective 
being pursued and its appreciation of the high quality of the 
research teams proposing the project. However, it also 
underlined the need to strengthen those teams, continue with the 
research and development needed to build the antenna, and 
provide accurate cost estimates. 
  The Council has been informed of subsequent improvements not 
only in the project's design but also in its organization and 
collaborative aspects, and has familiarized itself with the 
exhaustive cost estimates since provided. 
  In consequence, taking into account the acknowledged value 
of 
the scientific objective pursued, the quality of the research 
teams proposing it, the excellence of their comprehensive 
description of the project, the solid European cooperation built 
into it, and the collaborative ties already established with 
Project LIGO [Laser Interferometer Gravity Wave Observatory], 
which was launched in 1992, the Council unreservedly recommended 
that: 


    -  this project go forward to the construction phase as 
quickly as possible, i.e. as soon as permitted by the budgets of 
the French and Italian agencies providing the financing; 
  -  the institutions concerned set up a very clearly articulated 
structure for the "project group" with responsibilities well 
defined, to assure effective coordination and complementarity of 
the French and Italian teams working on subsystems of this 
unique, high-technology antenna; 
  -  progress on the project be evaluated periodically by a 
"review 
committee" composed of experts not associated with the project; 
  -  as early as possible the appropriate manufacturers be 
informed 
of or involved in development of project components, especially 
the mirrors. 

<H5>    Project SOLEIL </H5>
  As the project now stands, the Council is not in a position 
to make precise recommendations. The value to the French 
scientific community of having access to an apparatus like 
SOLEIL is scarcely in question. We must be assured, however, 
that a premature positive decision not lead to dispersion of 
efforts within the French community: It would be a pity not to 
make maximum use of the ESRF [European Synchrotron Radiation 
Facility], a high-quality facility in support of which France 
makes a heavy financial contribution. 
  The very difficult problem that must be faced by 
institutions 
involved in the project is that of financing it. Projections of 
TGE-related appropriations presented in the first part of this 
report leave no resources available in the short term to finance 
construction of SOLEIL, absent a sizable augmentation of 
allocations for the TGEs operated by these agencies. The Council 
therefore awaits detailed proposals from these institutions. 
<H5>  Project LHC (CERN) </H5>
  The Council remains concerned by the large volume of costs 
that agencies will have to support to ensure suitable 
participation in construction of the detectors associated with 
the LHC. It would like to obtain specifics from them concerning 
how they expect to finance them, as it believes that a large 
part of this financing will have to come from internal 
reprogramming, as was already recommended in 1991. 
  The Council will wait to receive all the information which 
the CERN directorate promised to provide to member-state 
delegations--in principle before the end of 1993--before 
rendering an opinion on the project. 
<H5>  Part One: Multiyear Program Description </H5>
<H5>  TGEs Defined </H5>
  The Council endeavored, in its first meetings in 1988, to 
clarify the notion of TGEs. These are instruments whose 
importance for the scientific community and whose cost to build 
justify a decision-making process concerted at the national 
level and multiyear financial programming: 


    -  Such facilities must be international in their 
scientific impact, even if managed at the national level. 
  -  The research center that develops around the instrument in 
question must be a hub that attracts a significant portion of 
the French researchers in the discipline concerned, as well as a 
number of foreign research teams. 
  -  Most TGEs are built in the framework of an international 
collaborative effort: Even where such a facility is entirely 
national, it should figure prominently in France's international 
cooperation policy. 
  -  Financially, construction of a TGE necessitates multiyear 
programming and demands, if not a temporary or permanent 
increase in the budget of the responsible institution, at least 
a significant reprogramming of that budget. Given its role as a 
hub for the discipline concerned, financing is in general 
provided by all the institutions active in that field. 
  -  The minimum consolidated construction cost (including 
personnel 
outlays) for a national TGE amounts to several hundred million 
francs. If the facility is an international one, the French 
share is on the same order of magnitude, and the total cost of 
the facility is generally in excess of Fr1 billion. 

    Owing to these criteria there exists, between TGEs and the 
so-called "light-heavyweight" facilities (rarely costing more 
than Fr10-15 million), a third category of important facilities 
("heavy infrastructure") which must appear under separate 
budgetary headings at the agency level but do not require a 
decision-making process that involves participation of the 
Council on Large Scientific Facilities. 
  The current list of TGEs in operation or under construction 
is presented in Annex A2. 
<H5>  Tables Explained </H5>
  The research entities involved with TGEs have updated the 
figures furnished last year, which allows us to compare, in the 
following tables, actual spending for 1992 (in millions of 1992 
francs) versus projected spending for 1993 and subsequent years 
(in millions of 1993 francs). 
  It is quite evident, especially for the later years, that 
figures furnished by the institutions are only provisional: They 
constitute, at the current scientific juncture, the best 
estimate of needs to come. The final figures may be amended, 
among other factors, as a result of the need to take new 
projects or the overall growth in institutional budgets into 
account. 
  It should also be noted that the budgetary programming 
presented here covers only those facilities for which a firm 
go-ahead for construction was given prior to 31 December 1992. 
Projects on which a Council opinion is still under preparation 
are presented in the second part of this report. 
  Information furnished by the institutions has been used to 
prepare two groups of tables: 


    -  a breakdown of all facilities by broad scientific 
discipline (Tables I-1 to I-6); 
  -  a comprehensive breakdown by research institution and 
responsible ministry (Tables II-1 to II-6), which has been 
placed at the end of this report (Annex A5) to keep down the 
length of the main text. 

    Annual expenditures for each TGE are presented in three 
columns: 


    -  personnel expenses, covering persons employed at the 
TGE itself. These outlays can be evaluated very accurately for 
the national TGEs and for most of the international TGEs. 
However, the appropriate breakdown between personnel outlays and 
construction expenses is very difficult to establish for CNES 
and ESA [European Space Agency] scientific programs, and has not 
been obtained; 
  -  operating expenses, which cover all nonpersonnel expenditures 
obligated after the TGE went into service. These include both 
operating costs and new investments to improve or extend the 
facility's capabilities; 
  -  construction expenses, which include all nonpersonnel outlays 
entailed by construction of a TGE up to the time it goes into 
service, as well as major remodelings. 

    This classification, which puts the information into the 
form 
most useful for the Council, does not necessarily correspond to 
typical budgetary breakdowns between ordinary expenditures and 
program authorizations. The reasons for this are explained in 
Annex A3. 
  Since appropriations for the institutions are granted on an 
"all-taxes-included" basis, the data provided in the tables are 
quantified in the same way. Because of the special tax status 
enjoyed by CEA, it is difficult to establish the precise amount 
of taxes paid by each facility: An average rate of 9.3 percent 
was added to the HT [taxes not included] data to rationalize 
comparisons of CEA data for national TGEs with data from other 
facilities. The data for contributions to international 
facilities take the varying tax regimes into account. 
<H5>  Project Status Reports </H5>
  This section summarizes briefly the most important 
developments in the TGE sector in 1992; it does not represent a 
detailed and systematic description of activities in all the 
TGEs. 
<H5>  (1) Elementary Particle Physics </H5>
  Activities of French physicists working in this domain 
continue to be divided mainly between CERN in Geneva and the 
DESY [Deutsch Elektron Synchrotron] laboratory in Hamburg, 
though contact is also maintained with the large international 
research centers. 
  CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research/European 
Particle Physics Laboratory: the acronym comes from its original 
name, European Council on Nuclear Research) has seen the number 
of its member states grow from 14 in 1990 to 17 as of 1 January 
1993 with the entry of Finland, Poland, and Hungary. The Czech 
and Slovak Republics will be admitted separately in the course 
of 1993, bringing the number of member states to 19. 
  Scientific activity in 1992, as in the previous year, was 
focused on exploitation of the LEP [Large Electron-Positron 
Collider]. Thanks to several important technical advances, beam 
intensity is expected to exceed specifications in the very near 
future. As a result, more Z boson decays were observed in 
1992 (3 million) than in the three previous years. Very precise 
tests of the "standard model" are carried out with the help of 
four large detectors whose performance is being steadily 
improved. 
  The program to augment the beam energy level continues: By 
the end of 1994, the energy level should be high enough to 
produce a pair of W bosons (160 GeV); the maximum energy level 
of 180 GeV should be reached by spring 1995, with installation 
of 192 superconducting accelerator chambers. The performance of 
the first chambers delivered by the manufacturers (including one 
French enterprise) regularly exceeds contractual specifications. 
Beginning in 1993, 48 LEP chambers will be operational. 
  Finally, work continues apace on preparatory studies for 
construction of the LHC, both the apparatus itself and the 
detectors. This subject will be discussed in greater detail in 
the second part of the present report. 
  The annual budget of CERN's basic program for 1993 totals 
951 
million Swiss francs; growth from 1992 is less than inflation. A 
further reduction of about 2.5 percent is planned for 1994, 
Germany having been exempted from contributing the full amount 
of its quota until 1995. The French contribution for 1993, 
representing 16.6 percent of the combined normal contributions 
of the 14 "original" member states, comes to 153.3 million Swiss 
francs (down 2 million Swiss francs from 1992), or about Fr567 
million (one Swiss franc = Fr3.7, as of 1 February 1992). France 
in 1992 was able to make a voluntary contribution of 10 million 
Swiss francs, thanks mainly to fluctuations in the exchange 
rate, to help resolve the dispute with the Eurolep consortium. 
  As in previous years, we must add to the contribution the 
sum 
of about Fr50 million for repayment of taxes on the income of 
French international employees residing in France. Thus total 
appropriations to CERN in 1993 will amount to about Fr617 
million. The breakdown shown in Table I-1 (particle physics, 
nuclear physics, fusion) is calculated by applying to our 
contribution the overall relative proportions of the three 
expense categories in the CERN budget. The only expenditures 
listed in the "construction" category are those associated with 
the LEP (final instalment to pay off debts incurred for Phase I 
in 1992 and completion of Phase II) or programmed for 
construction of the LHC if approved at the end of 1993. The 
figures corresponding to the years 1995 and 1996 all concern the 
LHC: In case the decision is postponed, they would of course be 
revised. 
  As will be recalled, the HERA (Hadron Elektron Ring 
Accelerator) electron-proton collider went into service in 
Hamburg in June 1992. A large team of French physicists (IN2P3 
and CEA) made a major contribution to realization of the "H1" 
detector and is now analyzing initial data. The DESY laboratory 
is a German facility financed by BMFT [Federal Ministry for 
Research and Technology] and the city of Hamburg. France between 
1987 and 1989 made in-kind contributions (superconducting 
magnets) worth about Fr100 million toward HERA's construction. 
[table omitted] 
<H5>  (2) Nuclear Physics </H5>
  French nuclear physicists have at their disposal two large 
national installations (broadly open to international 
cooperation): GANIL at Caen, and the Saturne National Laboratory 
at Saclay. Operating and capital expenses for the two facilities 
are divided equally between CEA and CNRS/IN2P3. 
  a) GANIL (Large National Heavy Ion Accelerator) is a 
three-cyclotron unit, in service since 1984 and currently one of 
the best installations in the world in its field, which is 
acceleration of heavy ions over a vast range of masses and 
energies, on the order of several tens of millions of electron 
volts per nucleon. Research there focuses primarily on exotic 
nuclei and general properties of nuclear matter. 
  Nonpersonnel operating expenses planned for 1993 amount to 
Fr52 million. These figures do not take into account 
appropriations earmarked expressly for laboratory operation. 
Companion appropriations for outside research teams for 
experiment preparation are listed and discussed in the third 
part of this report. GANIL's budget for 1993 should be 
sufficient to allow it to return to a normal operating schedule 
(37 weeks) instead of the 33-week schedule funded in the 1992 
budget. 
  Future prospects for GANIL, apart from obtaining very 
high-intensity beams, depend on installation of radioactive 
beams, which will open up a new line of research in nuclear 
structure. A final proposal will be presented in 1993: If 
approved, the financing required beginning in 1994 would amount 
to about Fr12 million (all taxes included) per year for each of 
the three partners (CEA, IN2P3, and the Basse-Normandie region). 
  b) The Saturne accelerator, rebuilt between 1974 and 1978 as 
an "intermediate" energy accelerator dedicated to nuclear 
physics and enhanced in 1987 by a new injector (MIMAS), 
accelerates protons up to 3 GeV and "light" heavy ions up to 1.2 
GeV per nucleon. It is the world's best generator of polarized 
protons and deuterons. It is used to study the internal 
structure of nuclei and nucleons with the help of the "hadron 
detector," which offers the advantage of high effective sections 
but has the disadvantage of complex interaction with the object 
being studied. Except in the domain of polarized light ion 
beams, Saturne's capabilities are now exceeded by those of the 
SIS [strategic information system] synchrotron at Darmstadt. For 
1993, its operating budget is Fr38 million, divided equally 
between CNRS and CEA. This is enough to support 5,000 hours of 
operation (versus 4,500 hours in 1992), while maintaining 
accelerator and experimental equipment operations. Beyond 1995, 
the future of LNS [Saturne National Laboratory] is uncertain and 
depends on decisions made on other projects. CEA is not 
programming any funds for it beyond that date. It should be 
noted that the personnel costs borne by CEA (Fr60 million in 
1993, versus Fr14 million for IN2P3) are particularly high: The 
equipment is operated primarily by CEA personnel, but most users 
are employed by IN2P3 or foreign laboratories. In its resource 
program for the next few years, CEA notes that it plans to end 
its contributions to Saturne's operating budget. 
  In the domain of intermediate-energy nuclear physics, 
priority for utilization of the flux magnetometer in conjunction 
with a 15 GeV continuous-beam electron accelerator was announced 
in the report which the Research Ministry requested from the 
Academy of Sciences in 1989 ("La physique nucleaire 
fondamentale," G. Charpak et al., November 1989); this priority 
was reaffirmed by French physicists in a report requested for 
the scientific council of IN2P3 and DSM/CEA [Sciences and 
Materials Directorate, Atomic Energy Commission] and published 
in 1992 ("Du nucleaire a la matiere nucleaire: rapport sur la 
physique aux energies intermediaires," B. Desplanques et al., 
January 1992). Under CEA's MACSE [Accelerator Module with 
Superconducting Electron Chambers] program, it has been possible 
successfully to test models of superconducting chambers for this 
project, studies for which continue in the framework of NUPECC 
[Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee], now under 
the aegis of the European Science Foundation. A draft proposal 
is expected to be presented in 1993. 
  The Council established guidelines on this subject in its 
1991 report and is waiting for submission of more advanced 
proposals. 
<H5>  (3) Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion </H5>
  European research in this domain is closely coordinated at 
the level of the European Communities Commission, under the 
aegis of the EURATOM [European Atomic Energy Community] Treaty. 
The fusion program is one of the major elements in the Framework 
Program for Research and Technology Development [PCRD]. 
  a) The European JET (Joint European Torus) Tokamak located 
at 
Culham, near Oxford in Great Britain, is the European 
Community's most advanced torus and is utilized in collaboration 
with Sweden and Switzerland. The decision to build it was made 
in 1978, and JET first produced plasma in 1983. JET's objectives 
are to define the parameters and operating conditions of a 
tokamak fusion reactor. 
  The capabilities of JET make it far and away the world 
leader. Achieving ignition of the plasma will require the 
"fusion product" (density of plasma x energy containment time x 
temperature) to be further increased by a factor of 5. While 
performance may have been satisfactory in terms of heating and 
plasma containment, the impurity ratio is posing problems as 
more and more energy is injected into the plasma. It was 
primarily in order to deal with this problem that the research 
council in October 1991 agreed to extend the life of the JET 
program to the end of 1996. 
  A preliminary experiment using a weak tritium concentration 
was carried out in November 1991, producing two megawatts of 
fusion power. The experiment yielded valuable information about 
the behavior of tritium in tokamaks. 
  The JET was shut down in February 1992 for a period 
scheduled 
to last about 18 months (to October 1993), during which time the 
"divertor coils" needed to fix the impurities problem will be 
installed. A great deal of new equipment will also be installed 
to prepare for the final phase of tritium operations in 1995 and 
1996. 
  Eighty percent of JET's funding comes from the EEC, 10 
percent from the host country, and the other 10 percent from the 
respective partners in the fusion program. France's direct share 
(Fr16 million in 1993), paid by CEA, represents 2.5 percent of 
JET's total budget, which for 1993 comes to 105 million ECU. 
  b) France's Super Torus, located in Cadarache and operated 
by 
CEA, will get back on a normal budgetary footing this year (the 
operating budget increases from Fr52 million in 1992 to Fr70 
million in 1993, all taxes included). The program is oriented 
toward sustained output, a major objective of the international 
program. 
  It should be noted that in June 1992 an output of 1 
mega-ampere [MA] was sustained for a full minute. All basic 
diagnostics are operational. Research efforts are focused on 
obtaining quasi-stationary output by adjusting heat levels and 
mastering techniques for adjusting active and passive components 
of the primary confining field. This equipment needs further 
development, to furnish data usable for Project ITER 
[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]. In the final 
phase of experimentation, it might be able to produce output 
lasting as long as 1,000 seconds, comparable to ITER's 
performance projections. 
  The preparation of "Next Step," i.e. the next-generation 
apparatus with which the successor program to JET will work, is 
becoming an important component of the European program. The 
detailed planning phase ("Engineering Design Activities"--EDA) 
of Project ITER, which was described in the Council's 1991 
report, has become a reality. A general accord and an initial 
protocol between the four global partners--Europe, the United 
States, Japan, and Russia--were signed in July 1992. This phase, 
which will last six years, should lead to a proposed apparatus 
demonstrating the possibility of self-sustained plasma 
combustion lasting on the order of 1,000 seconds. Its technical 
objectives are in process of being determined. The project 
leader is a Frenchman, and the work will be carried out at three 
sites (Garching, San Diego, and Naka). The cost of the EDA phase 
is projected to be about a billion dollars. It probably will 
entail an augmentation of fusion program appropriations in the 
course of the fourth PCRD, even before construction of the 
apparatus, which will require substantially greater investments 
in the fusion program. 
  In the very short term, financing for the fusion program as 
a 
whole will be difficult in 1994, owing to extreme budgetary 
stringencies affecting the third PCRD. [table omitted] 
<H5>  (4) Ground-based astronomy </H5>
  a) The European Southern Observatory (ESO) is the European 
research umbrella for ground-based astronomy. Its charter is 
modeled on that of CERN. ESO today has eight member states. The 
organization gives European astronomers access to a large, 
modern observatory located at La Silla, in Chile. Its major 
project, approved in late 1987, is construction of the Very 
Large Telescope (VLT), which by the end of the century will be 
the most powerful telescope in the world. 
  ESO's total budget for 1992 was 113 million German marks 
[DM] 
(Fr385 million), of which close to DM46 million represents 
investment in the VLT. Personnel expenditures are 32 percent of 
the budget. France is providing 24.7 percent of the funds (its 
contribution will grow from Fr95 million in 1992 to Fr97 million 
in 1993). 
  The VLT is a cluster of four telescopes, each equipped with 
an 8-meter-diameter mirror. Fabrication of these mirrors is a 
technological challenge in itself, since the primary mirrors 
will be shaped like thin menisci whose shape must be 
continuously adjusted using active optical technology. The VLT 
will be installed at Paranal, 500 km north of La Silla, site of 
the current ESO telescopes. The infrastructural work begun in 
1991 will continue, in particular evaluation of seismic risks 
and a study of near-surface geological strata. Contracts for 
providing the foundations (Schott) and smoothing the mirrors 
(Reosc) are proceeding as planned. 
  CNRS's National Institute of Physical Sciences (INSU) is 
preparing the French astronomical community for the arrival of 
this very large facility. In accordance with ESO's policy, VLT's 
focusing apparatus will be fabricated at laboratories of member 
countries. French teams are involved in two of the 
instrumentation projects: 


    -  development of a multi-object fiber spectrograph, 
Fuegos (French-Swiss-Italian consortium under the direction of 
the Paris observatory); 
  -  development of a spectroscopic imaging instrument for the 
10-micron window (Franco-Dutch consortium under the direction of 
the DSM/CEA astrophysics service in Saclay). 

    Also, special efforts are being made in the field of optic 
interferometry. Contracts have been signed with ESO to develop 
(in France) improvements in the interferometric instrumentation: 
development and fabrication of very small deformable mirrors 
(Marseille observatory), and development of a system of 
[interference] fringe monitoring. 
  A convention was signed in December 1992 between ESO, the 
Max 
Planck Gesellschaft (MPG), and INSU for amplification of VLT's 
interferometric mode: The idea is to supplement the ESO proposal 
for two auxiliary telescopes 2 meters in diameter (VISA/VLTI 
[VLT Interferometric Sub Array]) with a third telescope and a 
delay line, which will greatly strengthen its imaging 
capabilities. Over a three-year period beginning in 1993, France 
will contribute Fr17 million to this improvement. 
  b) The Canada-France-Hawaii telescope (CFH) is financed by 
equal lump-sum contributions from the University of Hawaii, the 
Canadian National Research Council, and INSU. These institutions 
are also sharing equally in financing of the 1991-1993 
instrumentation plan. 
  Out of the Fr16 million that CNRS is contributing in 1993, 
Fr10 million corresponds to personnel expenses; there is also 
Fr4 million to defray travel costs for users. 
  c) The Institute of Millimeter Radioastronomy (IRAM) 
received 
new support with the adhesion of the National Geographic 
Institute of Spain, which reduces CNRS's participation to 47 
percent. The growth in activities, now that antennas are fully 
operational and Spain is involved, explains the programmed 
budgetary growth. Out of the Fr33 million authorized for 1993, 
about Fr19 million is to meet personnel costs. 
  In 1994 and 1995 financing will be required for additional 
equipment on the Bure plateau to support Very Large Base 
Interferometry (VLBI), a project approved in December 1988; the 
project will be funded by INSU (since MPG financed the VLBI in 
Spain). 
  The proposal to add two antennas to the interferometry 
infrastructure on the Bure plateau will be deferred, as MPG has 
no plans to finance it in the short term. MPG and CNRS will 
review project development in June 1993, and a decision may be 
made in December 1993. CNRS's decision will be closely tied to 
the program to restructure French ground-based observation 
facilities. 
<H5>  (5) Space-based Astronomy </H5>
  The satellite and space probe programs of which French 
physicists have been beneficiaries have been carried out by CNES 
in collaboration with the European Space Agency, Russia, and the 
United States. CEA contributes to fabrication of some of the 
instrumentation. 
  a) The Hipparcos astrometry satellite launched in 1989 is 
still carrying out its original mission despite a very eccentric 
orbit, the result of problems during launch. High-level ESA 
teams have made substantial efforts to save the mission. In 
particular, ESA is financing four receiving stations at diverse 
longitudes (instead of a single station if the orbit were 
geostationary). The satellite's power supply should enable it to 
remain operational until mid-1994. The precision required for 
the five astronometric parameters (2 milliseconds of arc) very 
probably will be obtained. 
  Operating allocations (Fr3 million in 1993) are henceforth 
set aside for support of the French research teams involved. 
  b) The ISO satellite is part of ESA's scientific program. 
Launch date has been postponed from 1994 to 1995 because of 
snags in development. Four focal instruments will be launched. 
France, playing an important role in the consortium, is 
responsible for the ISOCAM camera; CEA is project leader. In the 
framework of another European consortium, France is 
participating in the large wavelength spectrometer. Nonpersonnel 
outlays programmed by CNES for 1993 amount to Fr55 million. 
Another Fr1 million is being provided from the CEA budget. 
  c) The first "cornerstone" of ESA's Horizon 2000 program 
includes: 


    -  the SOHO [Solar and Heliospheric Observatory] 
observatory, whose purpose is to study the internal structure of 
the corona and solar winds, scheduled for launch by NASA in 1995; 
  -  the "CLUSTER" mission to study small-scale fluctuations in 
the 
magnetosphere with the help of four identical satellites 
positioned at key locations, also scheduled for launch in 1995 
or 1996, aboard one of Ariane 5's qualification flights. 

    French laboratories are closely involved, since France is 
project leader for six of the observation instruments, and CRPE 
[Center for Physical and Environmental Research] is responsible 
for important coordination functions at the European level. 
Development costs to CNES in 1993 come to Fr214 million, and CEA 
is contributing an additional Fr1 million. 
  d) The second "cornerstone" of ESA's Horizon 2000 program is 
the XMM observatory. Its cost, apart from the apparatus itself, 
is estimated at 531 million 1991 ECU. The industrial 
construction phase is expected to get under way by the end of 
1993, with launch scheduled for 1999. 
  The basic objective of the XMM mission is the study of soft 
and medium-strength x-ray radiation (wavelengths between 1 and 
50 Angstroms) emitted by gases at very high temperatures (tens 
of millions of degrees) as a result of supernova explosions. 
Spatial imaging resolution is better than 0.5 minutes of arc. 
Spectral resolution is "medium." 
  The feasibility of the mirrors, which it was hoped could be 
molded onto a structure made of composite materials, has not 
been fully established: A more traditional but less lightweight 
solution based on nickel shells is being studied concurrently. 
  Instrumentation consists of three cameras, two 
spectrometers, 
and one optical monitor. French participation, which concerns 
the cameras on the principal focal plane, is in the framework of 
a consortium of European laboratories; three French space 
science laboratories are involved very closely with this project. 
  The French share of the construction budget for this newly 
embraced TGE is Fr15 million in 1993. It will increase 
incrementally to Fr169 million in 1996. 
  e) France's SIGMA on-board telescope, whose mission is to 
provide high-resolution spectral and angular imagery of the sky 
in the low-energy gamma-ray band, has been in operation since 
December 1989 on board the Soviet satellite "Granat." Given the 
importance of the results obtained, especially in the region of 
the galactic center, it was decided to continue operating this 
instrument for as long as possible. Since 1992, operating costs 
have been shared with Russia. CNRS will contribute Fr4 million 
in 1993 to defray nonpersonnel expenses, and CEA will contribute 
Fr1 million. 
<H5>  (6) Planetology </H5>
  a) The 1994-1996 Mars mission in cooperation with Russia is 
the first phase of exploration of the planet Mars, which will 
continue in a series of launches between now and the year 2000. 
The 1994 Mars probe will orbit the planet and leave small 
stations and penetrators. In 1996, a balloon and small vehicle 
will be dropped onto the planet's surface. CNES's share of the 
program this year will be Fr82 million. 
  b) The Cassini-Huygens mission is being developed for 
exploration of the planet Mars and its satellite Titan. It will 
be a joint Franco-American project. An orbital module (NASA) 
will be put into orbit around Saturn, while a descent module 
(ESA) will be dropped into the atmosphere of Titan. The mission 
is scheduled for launch by NASA in 1996. CNES will spend Fr74 
million on development in 1993, and CEA Fr3 million. 
  Funding for these two projects does not increase in 1993. 
<H5>  (7) Oceanology </H5>
  a) - The oceanological fleet TGE consists of the sea-going 
oceanographic vessels and their on-board equipment; the vessel 
most recently launched is the "Atlante," which went into service 
in 1991 equipped with an EM 12 multibeam depth sounder. 
  One facet of the fleet renewal program, funding of the 
future 
High-Seas Research Vessel (NRH) at a total estimated cost of 
Fr160 million, is divided over the 3-year period 1992-1994. 
  In 1993, Fr7 million is earmarked for repairs to the 
"Noroit" 
in addition to its quadrennial overhaul. In 1995, Fr10 million 
will be allocated for repairs to the "Suroit." 
  For 1995-1996, consideration is being given to program 
authorizations for Project Nereis, a light drilling vessel (Fr50 
million in 1995, Fr60 million in 1996). Appropriations for each 
fiscal period correspond to needed renovations or equipment 
maintenance. 
  In 1993, the oceanological fleet is allocated Fr158 million 
for operations. This endowment, insufficient to ensure optimal 
operating conditions, will increase in stages to Fr170 million 
in 1996. Most of the funds are earmarked for GENAVIR, (a 
subsidiary of IFREMER [French Research Institute for Exploration 
of the Sea]), and are used to defray salary costs. The equipment 
budget will increase from Fr60 million in 1993 to Fr70 million 
in 1996. 
  Expenses for IFREMER personnel serving on the oceanological 
fleet amount to about Fr3.2 million per year. [table omitted] 
  b) - Construction of the Marion Dufresne 2 (MD2), the new 
polar research vessel provisionally approved by the Council in 
February 1992, has now received the official nod. An economic 
interest group [GIE] to be composed of General Maritime Company 
(CGM) and the Polar Institute is now being formed. A contract 
has been signed between CGM, acting on behalf of the future GIE, 
and the shipbuilding yards at Havre, subject to final approval 
of a financial package. Total cost of the operation is Fr556 
million, of which Fr50 million is for scientific equipment and 
technical gear (cranes, winches, etc.) A project group is being 
established. 
  The MD2 will embody important improvements over MD1, 
including: 


    -  better accommodations for scientific personnel, in 
terms of both living quarters and working conditions 
(laboratories, analytical instruments, computers); 
  -  a more flexible propulsion system and better navigational 
equipment; 
  -  installation of a multibeam depth sounder. 

    The possibility of returning only once each year to 
Marseille 
is being studied in conjunction with the Polar Institute; this 
would increase the length of the annual oceanographic season and 
perhaps extend the vessel's operating radius to take in all of 
the Indian Ocean, to facilitate participation in various 
international cooperation programs (Indonesia, Australia, etc.). 
The recommendation of the Council on Very Large Facilities 
concerning "ice" rating was not followed. Implementing it would 
have been too costly. On the other hand, beginning this year, 
one-time funding requests are subject to the same scientific 
evaluation as other oceanographic projects. 
  The budget for the Polar Institute's fleet remains stable in 
1993 at Fr24 million. 
  c) The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) was initiated in 1968 in 
the United States (Deep Sea Drilling Project). In 1974, France 
became a partner in the first phase of this project, which 
concluded in 1983. The project enabled researchers to 
reconstruct the general history of the geological events over 
the last 200 million that led to the present configuration of 
the world's oceans and continents. 
  Since October 1984 (after a year devoted to planning and 
refitting the vessel), a new ODP program has been established; 
participating in it with the United States are seven 
international partners: Canada-Australia (consortium), France, 
Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, a 12-nation European 
consortium, and Russia. The heart of the program is the drilling 
vessel "Joides Resolution." Results stemming from the initial 
objectives have contributed to improving science's understanding 
of fluid circulation in the lithosphere and demonstrated their 
role in tectonic phenomena. The program has also contributed to 
the study of paleo-environments. 
  The French ODP community consists of about 230 researchers, 
engineers, and landside technicians. France's annual 
contribution is $2.75 million, or Fr18 million. Expenses for 
IFREMER personnel are estimated at Fr1.2 million per year, plus 
a companion appropriation of Fr1 million to aid French teams 
participating in the project. 
<H5>  (8) Earth Observation </H5>
  The Council reiterates that it is absolutely essential to 
establish some means of coordinating the preparation, operation, 
and scientific exploitation of the entire array of space-based 
earth observation programs. Despite the efforts of CNES, which 
created a committee on earth observation programs, the user 
communities are still too unstructured. 
  a) The Franco-American Topex-Poseidon satellite launched in 
August 1992 will complete its radar altimetry measurements of 
worldwide fluctuations in sea level, pinpointing areas of high 
and low "pressure" produced by oceanic circulation. France will 
contribute Fr106 million to this project in 1993, the year that 
analysis of the data gets under way. Discussions with the United 
States are currently being held to prepare a successor to that 
apparatus. The structure of the companion appropriations for 
this TGE is presented in summary form in the third part of this 
report. 
  b) The WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) program is 
devoted to the study, over a five-year period (1990-1995), of 
heat redistribution via oceanic circulation. It includes a 
program of hydrographic measurement and tracers that will cover 
all the oceans, laying of surface and subsurface floats, 
networks of current-measuring anchorages, and intensive 
utilization of altimetry data. 
  In all, worldwide hydrographic survey activity will amount 
to 
the equivalent of 25 ship-years. In addition to these 
observation programs, WOCE has plans to involve itself in the 
vital domain of simulations and data analysis, which will 
require substantially augmented data processing facilities. 
  The French part of the WOCE program is concentrated in two 
regions: the South Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, 
including its antarctic part. IFREMER is responsible for 
development the of subsurface floats (over a two to three-year 
period). In 1992, nonpersonnel expenses amounted to Fr15 
million. This level will be maintained in 1993 and 1994 and then 
diminish. Personnel outlays remain stable at Fr4 million. 
  c) The ENVISAT program adopted at Granada in November 1992 
involves a series of satellites dedicated initially to the 
objectives of research on climate and terrestrial environment, 
especially radioactivity. It uses a mid-size platform optimized 
for payloads in the 1.5-ton range. The ENVISAT-1 platform will 
carry five instruments built by ESA and four financed on a 
national basis (pursuant to a "call for proposals"). 
  The ENVISAT-1 program will get under way in January 1993, 
looking toward a launch date in 1998 with an expected five-year 
orbital life. The budgetary cost to France in 1993 is Fr167 
million; the amount will increase each year thereafter, reaching 
Fr293 million in 1996. 
  d) The ERS (Earth Resource Satellite [or Earth Remote 
Sensing 
Satellite]) is an "optional" program for ESA. It consists of two 
satellites: ERS-1 and ERS-2. These satellites (the first was 
launched in July 1991, the second is to be launched in 1994) 
will carry out missions in oceanographic meteorology, primarily 
with the aid of UHF instruments that will permit continuous 
observation of the ocean surface (temperature, wind, waves) and 
ice. France's contribution is Fr1,200 million (in 1988 francs) 
to ERS-1 and Fr800 million (in 1990 francs) to ERS-2. Programmed 
CNES outlays in 1993 amount to Fr234 million. The ERS satellites 
will ensure continuous observation over a six-year period; in 
principle, they will then be replaced by ESA's POEM-1 (Polar 
Orbit Environment Monitoring) mission about 1998. 
  The Council notes that, as it had predicted, earlier 
decisions will once again have a very significant impact on 
spending in 1993. Between 1992 and 1995 there will be a 
substantial increase in resources allocated to earth observation. 
<H5>  (9) Geology and Interior Geophysics </H5>
  The Deep Geology of France (GPF) project has recently 
completed two drill holes in the Ardeche. In a meeting in 
November 1992, the scientific council for the program took note 
of the high quality of the multidisciplinary research conducted 
during the previous 18 months on materials from the first drill 
hole. 
  In early 1991, the program steering committee decided to 
elevate GPF to the status of a European-level program, 
reinforcing dialogue with the scientific communities of 
neighboring countries, and in particular strengthening links 
with the corresponding German program. The first step was to 
create a new scientific council on which several countries are 
now represented: Germany, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, United 
Kingdom, and Switzerland. 
  The TGE Council believes the project has not yet reached a 
sufficiently mature stage to warrant examination and the 
rendering of an opinion. 
<H5>  (10) Condensed Matter Studies </H5>
  Beginning in 1994, European scientists at Grenoble doing 
research on condensed matter will have at their disposal a pair 
of installations unique in the world: the European Synchrotron 
Radiation Facility (ESRF) and the Laue Langevin Institute (ILL). 
  In addition, the French scientific community has its own 
national facilities, the LURE at Orsay and the Leon Brillouin 
Laboratory (LLB) at Saclay. 
  a) Neutron sources 
  The High Flux Reactor (RHF) is operated by the Laue Langevin 
Institute of Grenoble, a private French enterprise. An 
intergovernmental convention structures relations between it and 
its partners, the CEA and CNRS in France, the KFK in Karlsruhe 
in Germany, and the SERC [Scientific and Engineering Research 
Council] in the United Kingdom. Through the end of 1993, the 
annual budget will be funded by approximately equal 
contributions from the three partners (France's 1993 
contribution amounts to Fr134 million, taxes included). The 
French contribution covers the taxes in their entirety. 
  The RHF is currently idled, following discovery of cracks on 
the baffle plate of the heavy water circuit. In May 1992, the 
steering committee decided to completely overhaul the reactor at 
a cost of Fr173 million; financing was obtained by reprogramming 
funds within a budget that has remained unchanged (exclusive of 
taxes) from 1992 to 1993. Plans are to restart the reactor in 
July 1994. The reactor being almost completely rebuilt, one can 
expect it to remain in operation for 20 more years without major 
problems. 
  The English side has given formal notice it plans to 
withdraw 
from the international convention, which expires on 31 December 
1993. A codicil to the convention was negotiated between the 
partners and signed in March 1993. It authorizes a reduction in 
the English contribution. ILL has reorganized and implemented 
various steps to cut costs: Operations will be limited to five 
cycles (232 days), with only 25 instruments programmed, compared 
to six cycles (279 days) and 30 instruments before the shutdown. 
ILL plans to delegate responsibility for the spectrometers 
increasingly to research teams, under contracts analogous to 
those between ESRF and collaborating research groups [CRGs]; it 
also plans to develop additional scientific partnership 
conventions like those already in existence with Switzerland, 
Spain, and Austria. 
  The budget for 1994 is estimated at Fr270 million (1992 
francs), with contributions from partners covering only Fr240 
million. France's share will be Fr126 million (including Fr10 
million in taxes). Beginning in 1995, a Fr6 million reserve will 
be set aside to cover reprocessing of fuel elements currently in 
storage. [table omitted] 
  The Orpheus ["Orphee"] reactor and the Leon Brillouin 
Laboratory (LLB), a facility jointly owned by CEA and CNRS, are 
located at the Saclay research center. For 1993, the budget will 
be Fr120 million (including Fr68 million for data analysis 
operations). The reactor started up only about a dozen years ago 
and remains very modern. But maintenance outlays will have to be 
budgeted in 1994 and funds set aside, as with the RHF, for fuel 
reprocessing (Fr9 million in 1993, Fr12 million in 1994). 
  Neutron flux is four times weaker than in the RHF, but the 
reactor has a collection of features (two cold sources and one 
radioactive source) that give it useful characteristics. 
Twenty-one spectrometers are used in experiments. 
  The number of experiment proposals grew considerably in 1992 
(from 300 to 500) following shutdown of the RHF and remains at 
the higher level this year. To accommodate the surge in 
requests, CEA and CNRS have taken steps (Fri.1 million) to keep 
the reactor in operation and available for use as much of the 
time as possible (about 275 days). These measures will be 
continued in 1993 and 1994. 
  A new type of cold source, ring-shaped, may be installed in 
the reactor in 1994, to augment the amount of neutron flux 
available with existing equipment. No decision has been made 
thus far on proposed augmentation of the reactor's experimental 
capacities, which in any case cannot be completed without 
external partners or before the RHF is back in operation. The 
financing (Fr70 million), stretched over a 3-year period, could 
begin in 1993 with a Fr2 million allocation for studies. Actual 
work will be timed to coincide with the reactor's overhaul, 
which cannot be delayed beyond 1997. 
  French researchers have access to other neutron sources, 
including the ISIS pulsed source at England's Rutherford 
Appleton Laboratory. The CNRS-CEA-SERC accord on ISIS expired at 
the end of 1992; since French requests for access to ISIS more 
or less counterbalanced British requests for access to LLB, CEA 
and CNRS have proposed continued collaboration with SERC in the 
form of reciprocal access times at LLB and ISIS. In both cases, 
experiments are selected from proposals after discussion by a 
committee of experts. 
  b) Synchrotron radiation sources 
  The principal objective of the private company ESRF 
(European 
Synchrotron Radiation Facility) is to build and operate at 
Grenoble a synchrotron radiation source and ancillary 
instrumentation to be used by the scientific communities of 
contracting countries. The source, a 6 GeV electron-positron 
storage ring, is already producing hard x-ray beams of very high 
intensity, six months ahead of schedule. 
  ESRF will contribute to fundamental and applied research on 
the structure of condensed matter in domains such as physics, 
chemistry, crystallography, earth sciences, biology and 
medicine, surface phenomena, and the study of materials. The 
apparatus is financed by Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, 
Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Netherlands, United Kingdom, 
Sweden, and Switzerland. 
  Numerous experiment stations (beam lines) are under 
construction around the periphery of the storage ring. Even 
before tests of the radiation source have been successfully 
concluded, initial test experiments have been performed on the 
three beam lines already installed in the ring experiment 
building. These experiments confirm source consistency with 
respect to beam intensity and stability. 
  The floor stability problems noted in the experiment hall do 
not threaten to derail early completion of the project. 
Corrective measures are under way. Results of first efforts to 
fix the problem confirm the repair work has improved plate 
stability; it remains to be seen whether the improvement is 
permanent. This is why all lines currently being installed are 
clustered in the south half of the experiment building, so the 
floor can be replaced one section at a time, if necessary. 
  For 1993, the objective is to continue intensive testing of 
the first group of beam lines. A few scientific experiments may 
be scheduled concurrently. More than 20 experiment proposals 
have already been submitted. The first such experiments were 
conducted in December 1992. 
  Scientific exploitation of the facility will begin in 1994 
with seven fully tested beam lines (the number should reach 30 
by 1998). 
  France's share of the ESRF budget will be Fr156 million in 
1993. It will be Fr150 million in 1994, then drop to Fr126 
million in 1996. The share devoted to exploitation will 
increase, going from Fr26 million in 1994 to Fr50 million in 
1996. It should be noted that the Convention calls for the 
portion funded by France to decline from 33 percent during 
construction period to 27.5 percent after operations get under 
way. 
  In the framework of CRG contracts with ESRF, France is 
fitting two beam lines on cambered magnets. This equipment has 
been financed by the Ministry of Research, the Rhone-Alpes 
region, and the department of Isere (a total of Fr21 million 
over the three-year period from 1990 to 1992). An additional Fr6 
million from CEA and CNRS is in the pipeline to complete the 
project. Installation is scheduled for early 1993, with 
equipment going into service by the end of the year. 
  The Laboratory for Utilization of Electromagnetic Radiation 
(LURE) will receive a total 1993 endowment of Fr116 million 
provided by CNRS, CEA, and MEN [Ministry of National Education]. 
In keeping with the decision of the board of trustees, start-up 
financing will conclude in 1993. The cost of operating CLIO 
[Collaboration for an Infrared Laser at Orsay] has been included 
in the LURE budget. The EEC contract for "access to large 
installations," of which the laboratory was a beneficiary, 
expired in 1992. A new request has been prepared. 
  The growth in the number of users of synchrotron radiation 
and the aging of LURE's existing equipment have prompted 
consideration of the idea of building a new source that would 
become operational about the year 2000. The apparatus in 
question, "SOLEIL," is still on the drawing boards. Scientific 
justification and technical specifications are under 
preparation. A preliminary discussion may be found in part two 
of this report. 
  c) The EURECA [European Retrievable Carrier] space platform 
is a module launched by an American shuttle with recovery 
scheduled for several months later. On board are microgravity 
devices to produce semiconductor and protein crystals, treat 
alloys, and perform biological experiments. Compared to 
Spacelab, it has the advantage of being able to conduct longer 
missions under better microgravity conditions and with reduced 
safety requirements, but it demands more sophisticated 
automation of experiments, since there is no possibility of 
outside assistance. The primary payload consists of five 
multi-user instruments plus several national experiments (two 
were developed by French laboratories). 
  EURECA was launched in July 1992, and recovery is scheduled 
for sometime in the first half of 1993. The cost for CNES is 
Fr39 million for 1992 and Fr19 million for 1993. No further 
flights of this platform are currently scheduled. 
<H5>  (11) Life Sciences </H5>
  The life sciences community is making increased use of large 
facilities devoted to the study of condensed matter (synchrotron 
radiation and neutron diffusion). 
  The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in 
Heidelberg is a facility that offers European scientists a 
cluster of high-quality semi-heavy scientific instruments. It 
also has two branches at ILL in Grenoble and the DESY Laboratory 
in Hamburg. This laboratory, a 15-nation project, has evolved 
into one of the best in Europe in the fields of cellular and 
structural biology. It is particularly active in the domains of 
cellular biology, differentiation, biological structures and 
information systems, genetic expression, physical 
instrumentation, biochemical instrumentation, information 
processing services, and data banks. It also conducts training 
for researchers who are completing or have already completed 
their doctorates. 
  EMBL has plans to expand its Grenoble branch, to take more 
advantage of the ESRF, and to establish a new branch (European 
biological information systems), the site for which had not yet 
been chosen by the time this report was prepared. 
  Contributions by member states in 1993 will amount to DM68 
million (up 11 percent from 1991). Personnel expenses account 
for close to 60 percent of the budget. The French contribution 
(16.7 percent) will be DM11.5 million, equal to about Fr39 
million. 
  Considering the size of the financial investment, the level 
of participation of French researchers is still too low, and the 
Council urges that incentives be offered to the French 
scientific community to promote increased participation by 
French scientists in the work of EMBL. [table omitted] 
<H5>  (12) Interdisciplinary Projects </H5>
  Under this heading are two research programs that involve 
diverse disciplines. 
  a) Detection of gravity waves (Project VIRGO) 
  This project in fundamental science, under the leadership of 
CNRS/IN2P3, involves a broad spectrum of physicists and 
astrophysicists, theoreticians, and experimenters. It was 
approved by the Council in 1992, and in cooperation with Italy 
it has now been launched. CNRS is considering committing a Fr40 
million program authorization in 1993 to this project, which is 
described in detail in part two of this report. 
  b) Manned space flights 
  These are experiments carried out with human beings in 
attendance, under microgravity conditions (10[.sup]-3[/] to 
10[.sup]-5[/] g). The primary areas of research involved are: 
  --study of human behavior during manned flight: 


    -  understanding the effects of gravity on the process of 
perception and spatial orientation; 
  -  analysis of adaptive responses of major physiological 
functions 
to microgravity (cardiovascular and immune systems) 

    --biology: reproductive functions, radiation environment and 
its effects on living tissue; 
  --physical sciences in general: materials, crystal growth, 
atomic physics, etc. 
  The latter two research categories do not require the 
presence of human beings and could be pursued with robotic 
equipment. 
  CNRS in 1993 will spend Fr170 million on all these programs, 
the cost of which is bound to increase. The manned flight 
program is an important element of bilateral collaboration 
programs (United States, Russia) and the ESA program (notably 
the European contribution to the Freedom space station, which 
could require sizable investments). 
  The Council does not yet have a clear vision of the level of 
resources France is prepared to commit under these three 
categories and questions the scientific priority of these 
programs. 
<H5>  (13) Technical/operational Facilities </H5>
  Outlays programmed under this heading are noted here only 
for 
purposes of information, and only for those international 
facilities that deserve the appellation "very large facility." 
Programming decisions concerning them fall outside the 
competence of the TGE Council. 
  a) Construction of the European Transonic Wind Tunnel (ETW) 
at Porz (Germany) continued in 1992, remaining on schedule. The 
goal of completing the mechanical engineering was met. The 
calibration and testing phase is next. Inauguration of the 
facility is set for June 1993. 
  Projections of total cost remain under the budget ceilings 
set by the governments of the four participating countries 
(France, Germany, Great Britain, Netherlands). France's 
28-percent share of costs in the construction phase (which ends 
in 1994) will translate in 1993 into a Fr37 million contribution 
from the Ministry of Transport (and an equal amount from the 
Ministry of Defense). 
  b) The METEOSAT network of meteorological satellites in 
geostationary orbit was developed under the overall lead of the 
European Space Agency and is exploited by the meteorological 
organization EUMETSAT [European Meteorological Satellite 
Organization]. France's share in 1992 was financed with a Fr139 
million contribution from the Ministry of Transport (national 
meteorological directorate). This subsidy is listed in the BCRD 
under technical programs. The corresponding amount for 1993 will 
be Fr197 million. 
  Data collected by these satellites is used primarily by the 
meteorological forecasting services. It is also used in research 
on climatic change, especially research on cloud cover. [table 
omitted] 
  The operational character of the METEOSAT satellite network 
prompted EUMETSAT to reposition one of its satellites to 
compensate for the delay in stationing of an American satellite, 
thus to ensure coverage of the Atlantic zone for the United 
States. One of the tangible benefits from this action was the 
detection of Hurricane Andrew last August and issuance of an 
alert a week before its passage over Florida. The expected 
increase in appropriations between 1993 and 1996 will be 
sufficient to keep the existing system operational until about 
the year 2000 (construction of two additional satellites and one 
launch), to begin building the new-generation satellites that 
will replace them, and finally to fund European participation 
(per international agreements) in observations from polar orbit, 
which today only the United States can conduct. The budget 
augmentation is less than projected initially. In fact, from a 
technical standpoint the METEOSAT satellite system is doing so 
well that the launch date for the next satellites could slip 
without jeopardizing continuity of EUMETSAT operations; having 
loaned METEOSAT-3 to the United States to cover for the delay in 
orbiting GOES-Next, we can expect the favor to be reciprocated 
at some point, should the METEOSAT system run into problems. 
France therefore has persuaded EUMETSAT to stretch out financing 
of the project. 
<H5>  Commentary on Future Needs </H5>
  The elements appearing in Tables I-1 to I-6, in particular 
I-6, "Summary by Disciplines," prompt the Council to make the 
following observations: 


    -  In elementary particle physics, the future of the 
discipline depends on whether it is decided to build the LHC at 
CERN: The Organization by the end of 1993 must furnish the 
information needed to make a final decision, but already it 
appears that building the detectors is likely to pose difficult 
problems at the level of national agencies and institutions. 
  -  The Council has noted CEA's intention to cease operating the 
Saturne accelerator in 1996 in order to move ahead along new 
lines of research using the GANIL beginning in 1994 (radioactive 
ion beams). This change of direction has not been expressly 
confirmed by CNRS, which exploits the equipment on a shared 
basis with CEA. The Council still hopes to see an international 
project elaborated to build a 15-GeV continuous-beam electron 
accelerator. 
  -  In the domain of controlled nuclear fusion, it is noted that 
the budget for Tore-Supra [Super Torus] is returning to normal 
levels, after a temporary dip in 1992. Also, the Council notes 
that the detailed planning phase of Project ITER is now under 
way. To the extent that this facility would be realized outside 
Europe, in a global context, the Council is not certain whether 
it is qualified to render an opinion on that subject. 
  -  The Council notes with satisfaction the progress on 
construction of the VLT, and is pleased that INSU has made 
available the supplementary funds needed to expand that 
instrument's interferometric mode. 
  -  In the sector of space-based astronomy, the Council notes the 
delay in construction of the ISO satellite. It also points out 
that it was not consulted before approval of the XMM mission. 
  -  In oceanology, construction of the two vessels recently 
approved by the Council (the NRH and the Marion Dufresne 2) is 
proceeding as planned. 
  -  In the domain of earth observation, the sizable augmentation 
in 
financial requirements already foreseen last year has been 
confirmed (up Fr155 million). It is bound to continue, given the 
higher funding levels that will be required for ENVISAT-1: Fr90 
million more in 1995 than in 1993. Like the XMM, this 
environmental study mission, adopted at the Granada conference, 
was not the subject of consultation with the Council. 
  -  Programmed outlays in the condensed matter sector will 
steadily 
decline (down Fr85 million) between 1992 and 1996, thanks to 
completion of the construction phase of ESRF and operational 
economies at ILL. This could leave room for the possibility of 
new projects, but reprogramming to other scientific domains 
(e.g. Project VIRGO) must also be taken into consideration. 
  -  The Council is pleased that an accord guaranteeing the 
long-term future of ILL has been signed with the two partners, 
English and German, despite the attendant financial restrictions 
on full exploitation of the facility. 
  -  The Council notes with satisfaction the fact that progress on 
construction of the ESRF continues ahead of schedule, as well as 
the high quality of the x-ray beaming equipment furnished. 
  -  The Council continues to question the pertinence of the 
expenditures for manned space flights, the scientific utility of 
which still appears to it unclear. 

<H5>    Part Two: Progress on Projects and new Projects </H5>
  Only one TGE proposal advanced sufficiently in 1992, in 
terms 
of planning within the scientific community, for the Council to 
take it up to render a definitive opinion: That project (VIRGO) 
is discussed in this second part of this report, accompanied by 
the Council's recommendations. 
  In addition, the Council received updates on the status of 
progress in the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation accelerator project 
and the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN. The status of these 
two projects and the Council's preliminary recommendations are 
also presented in this second part of the report. 
  As previously noted, in rendering its opinions the Council 
decided to put most emphasis on the following points: 


    -  the scientific value of the project and its impact on 
the discipline concerned; 
  -  the size of the community of potential users and the 
structuring role of the facility for that community; 
  -  the role of the facility at the international level, and 
analysis of the cooperation expected; 
  -  construction and exploitation costs, attendant laboratory 
costs, personnel needs, and ramifications for institutional and 
agency budgets. 

    These conditions have already been formulated explicitly in 
the previous reports. 
<H5>  Project VIRGO </H5>
  The Council in May 1992 formally took up the Franco-Italian 
gravity wave detection proposal (VIRGO) submitted by the 
director general of CNRS. 
  The Council had examined the project previously, in April 
1990. At that time it indicated its interest in the scientific 
objective pursued and noted the high technical caliber and 
overall quality of the scientific teams proposing it; it 
underlined the necessity for further strengthening these teams 
and continuing with the research and development needed for 
fabrication of the antenna and precise evaluation of costs. The 
analysis, presented in the 1991 report, is updated in what 
follows. 
  Scientific program: Modern theories of gravitation predict 
that a group of accelerated masses can engender gravitational 
radiation. General relativity, the best known and most accepted 
of these theories, allows of precise predictions of the 
properties and intensity of this radiation. Close study of 
pulsar PSR 1913 + 16 has established that the slowdown of the 
binary system to which this pulsar belongs is fully consistent 
with the hypothesis of the emission of gravity waves. Their 
direct observation would be still more convincing. Even more 
importantly, such detection would have the long-term consequence 
of giving birth to a new mode of observation in astrophysics. 
The physical observation being sought is an infinitesimal 
variation in the distance between two mass points during the 
passage of a gravity wave. 
  The only detectable signals--and they are very weak--come 
from condensed astrophysical objects. The collapse of the core 
of a supernova situated in our galaxy will generate a brief 
signal (1 millisecond), one of the most intense imaginable, but 
this type of event is rather infrequent. It is thus necessary to 
be able to detect more distant supernovas. Consequently we must 
aim for a relative sensitivity of 10[.sup]-21[/] to 
10[.sup]-22[/] (approximately the ratio between the radius of 
an atom and the distance between the earth and the sun). Such 
sensitivity would also make possible the observation of other 
sources whose existence is all but certain. 
  In short, this is an experiment in fundamental physics which 
requires recourse to highly multidisciplinary technologies, and 
whose impact on astrophysics, albeit long-term, could be 
essential. 
  Technical characteristics of the project: The development of 
laser metrology opens up the possibility today of 
interferometric detection of gravity waves thanks to increased 
sensitivity over a wide band of frequencies. This approach is 
much more promising than those hitherto explored. 
  The interferometry projected for VIRGO has the structure of 
a 
Michaelson [interferometer], i.e. a separating plate that splits 
the laser beam into two waves propagating along two 
perpendicular arms. The passage of a gravity wave train induces 
differential deformation of the two arms, producing a phase 
displacement of the partial wave, thus a change in observed 
luminosity. The optimal signal level (differential phase 
displacement of the two arms) is reached when the optical length 
L of each arm is equivalent to one-fourth the length of the 
gravity wave. For a band of frequencies below the kilohertz 
[kHz], this yields optical paths greater than 75 km in length. 
  Inasmuch as such a length is not practically attainable, the 
arms of the interferometric apparatus, 3 km long, form a 
Fabry-Perot [resonating] chamber with a grid fineness rating of 
50. Despite this optimization, the effect to be measured is 
still infinitesimal (10[.sup]-16[/] m). 
  Preparations for VIRGO were responsible for several complex 
technical advances: computer-programmed simulations of the 
precise characteristics of optical components, vibration 
isolation, high vacuum in a large container, and an extremely 
stable single-mode Neodymium/YAG laser. 
  It is important to note that indisputable proof of the 
existence of gravity waves can only be obtained by simultaneous 
detection of these waves by two independent detection devices, 
to be certain of eliminating ground noise mimicking the signal 
being investigated. 
  Structure of the project: New researchers, engineers, and 
technicians became involved in the project in 1991. About 90 
people are currently participating in it. 
  Project teams have made considerable progress in defining 
and 
testing all components of the antenna with the exception of 
mirrors. 
  As early as 1991, the scientific value of the project was 
accepted unreservedly by scientific experts independent of the 
project. The reliability of the technology, the modalities, and 
the cost of building the antenna were set forth in February 1992 
in the "Final Conceptual Design" (FCD) prepared by the Italian 
and French promoters. At the request of INFN [Italian National 
Institute of Nuclear Physics] and CNRS, experts reviewed it in 
April 1992. The experts have submitted a very favorable 
recommendation, which was taken into consideration along with 
subsequent comments from the scientists concerned. 
  Investment and timetable: This favorable evaluation led CNRS 
to request a formal opinion from the Council, with a view to 
giving top priority in the TGE program to finance this project. 
The antenna would be installed at Cascina, near Pisa. 
Construction would last six years and cost 81 million ECU in 
1992 currency (about Fr540 million), to be divided between INFN 
(55 percent) and CNRS (45 percent). Personnel needs have been 
estimated at about 500 man-years. Most personnel will be 
researchers, engineers, or technicians belonging to INFN or 
CNRS; their salaries are not included in the above figures. 
  International context: Detection of gravity waves is the 
subject of research in all major countries, but especially the 
United States and Europe. Project VIRGO today is collaborating 
closely with America's counterpart Project LIGO and receives 
scientific and technical support from English and German 
researchers. 
  After Britain's SERC backed off from a joint project with 
Germany's MPG, that project was shelved. But European efforts to 
build at least one antenna in Europe are being more closely 
coordinated. A tripartite ad hoc committee--called for in an 
April 1992 declaration of common interest signed by CNRS, INFN, 
and MPG--met in Geneva in May of that year. It recommended that 
German, British, French, and Italian physicists and engineers 
expand technical collaboration and coordinate their research and 
development efforts. Representatives of MPG confirmed their 
interest, though the latter is not currently in a position to 
participate in financing. 
  Collaboration with the American Project LIGO (which calls 
for 
two antennas in the United States) has been expanded, with a 
view to correlating future American and European observational 
data. In comparing the two projects, the Council made the 
following comments: 


    -  In its initial version, VIRGO will be able to make 
finer measurements: The American antennas will be much less 
sensitive below 50 Hz and about equal between 100 and 10,000 Hz; 
  -  there are significant design differences between VIRGO and 
LIGO, a fact which will reinforce the credibility of signals 
detected by all the antennas; 
  -  assuming the existence of two 
American antennas with sensitivity equal to VIRGO, the latter's 
presence would significantly augment the probability of 
detecting a signal; 
  -  the two LIGO antennas will not be built simultaneously: NSF 
[National Science Foundation] estimates that the second will be 
completed a little less than two years after the first, and 
VIRGO would be completed before the second American 
antenna. 

    In consequence, given the acknowledged value of the 
scientific objective pursued, the quality of the proposing 
research teams, the excellence of their comprehensive 
description of the project, the solid European cooperation 
embedded in it, and the collaboration already established with 
Project LIGO (which was launched in 1992), the Council 
recommends unreservedly that: 


    -  this project proceed to the construction phase as early 
as possible, i.e. as soon as research budgets permit; 
  -  the agencies and institutions put in place a very well 
articulated structure for the project group, with 
responsibilities well defined, to assure strong coordination and 
complementarity of French and Italian teams working on 
subsystems of the novel and highly technical antenna; 
  -  progress on the project be reviewed at regular intervals by a 
review committee composed of experts not involved in the project; 
  -  as early as possible the appropriate manufacturers be 
informed 
of or involved in development of project components, especially 
the mirrors. 

    The CNRS's council on large instruments has also endorsed 
Project VIRGO. But the construction schedule and corresponding 
program authorizations have been altered to take into account 
what CNRS can contribute (Fr40 million for construction) and to 
smooth out the 1994 spending surge entailed by the optimal 
timetable proposed in the FCD. This means about six months' 
slippage in completion of the project. 
  The Italian partner, INFN, has accorded it top priority 
among 
its special projects for the next five-year plan, which is to be 
negotiated during the first half of 1993. 
<H5>  Project SOLEIL </H5>
  The Council has already mentioned, in its 1992 report, the 
deliberations of the Prospects Committee established in 1990 by 
CNRS, CEA, and the Ministry of National Education to evaluate 
the synchrotron radiation needs of the French scientific 
community. The institutions' request was motivated by problems 
of aging of some equipment at the LURE laboratory, in particular 
the linear injection accelerator and the DCI ring [Igloo 
Collision Device]. In the document that it prepared ("Rapport du 
Comite de Prospective pour l'utilisation du rayonnement 
synchrotron en France," H. Benoit et al., July 1991), the 
Prospects Committee categorically recommended construction of a 
new storage ring to complement the ESRF (which operates in the 
hard x-ray range). This new ring would enable France to hold 
onto its position in the far ultraviolet to soft x-ray range 
despite scheduled decommissioning of LURE's installations. The 
ring, with an energy level of about 2 GeV, should have the 
characteristics of so-called "third-generation" devices and be 
able to function either at high intensity or with a low number 
of packets to permit experiments involving time correlations. 
  In that connection, the LURE scientific community conducted 
a 
study of the laboratory's future in the year 2000 and France's 
synchrotron radiation needs once ESRF becomes operational. The 
result was a November 1991 draft proposal for "Optimized Source 
of Intermediate-Energy Light at LURE" (SOLEIL). This document 
gives a brief description of a 2.15 GeV machine, indicates the 
principal technical variables that dictate the structure of the 
project, and gives a more exhaustive presentation of scientific 
arguments in favor of the new equipment. 
  As of early 1993, a fuller technical study is being 
prepared, 
with detailed evaluation of the cost of construction for the 
machine, eventual supporting facilities, and scientific 
equipment. 
  At the current stage of thinking, the institutions 
concerned--CNRS, CEA, DRED [Directorate of Research and Doctoral 
Studies] (Ministry of National Education)--have not yet come to 
a decision whether to support the project, hence whether to 
request a formal opinion from the TGE Council. 
  The Council, which has expressed the desire to be kept 
informed not only of fully matured projects but also of those 
for which preparatory work is well advanced, asked one of its 
members (G. Ferey) for a report on the current status of SOLEIL. 
The report was given at the Council meeting in November 1992. 
The principal elements of G. Ferey's report, and comments from 
the Council during the discussion, are summarized below. 
<H5>  National and international context </H5>
  a) LURE Laboratory: The current status of the LURE 
laboratory 
is described in the "SOLEIL" report. The laboratory presently 
operates three machines: the DCI, the Super-ACO, and the 
injector that serves both. 
  DCI: Built between 1971 and 1975 for high-energy physics, it 
was used for that purpose for 9 years but was converted in 1985 
into a synchrotron radiation source. The 1.85-GeV energy beam 
generates photons at energy levels between 3 and 25 keV 
[kiloelectron volts] on magnetic dipole lines and 3-40 keV on 
lines from the superconducting wiggler. The machine is notable 
for the exceptional duration of its powerful beam (55 hours at 
an intensity of 300 milliamperes [mA]). It is handicapped in 
some experiments however by the large transverse dimension of 
the positron packet (hence of the optical source), the lack of 
sufficient space surrounding the ring, and limitations on the 
number of insertions (only one in practice). It presently has 22 
experiment stations. Start-up funds provided in 1990 should be 
sufficient to ensure acceptable operations up to the end of the 
decade. 
  Super-ACO: Built between 1982 and 1987, this ring was the 
first of the so-called third-generation machines dedicated to 
synchrotron radiation. The source is small in size, and its 
cross-sections can accommodate up to six undulators. At present 
it has 28 experiment stations operated full-time or on a shared 
basis around the ring. It currently is the best machine in the 
extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray range. With energy of 800 MeV 
[megaelectron volts], it permits coverage of the visible band up 
to 5 keV and will soon operate in the millimetric wavelength 
range (the SIRLOIN experiment now in the final stages). 
  It is the only machine that makes such massive use of 
temporal structuring of the beam, which operates 50 percent of 
the time in a stable two-packet mode, with a 120-nanosecond 
interval, at a total intensity of 200 mA, while the other half 
of the time it operates in a 24-packet mode at a total intensity 
of 400 mA for production of high-flux photons. 
  Injector: This is a linear accelerator with energy of 2.3 
GeV 
which with the help of a converter generates positrons with 
energy of 1.1 GeV. The choice of positrons is justified by the 
fact that they make it possible to obtain beams that are more 
stable and have longer duration than electrons. The oldest part 
of this apparatus dates from 1957, the most recent from 1968. 
  With this impressive equipment endowment and with what might 
be called its adolescent years behind it, LURE has grown 
considerably in recent years. In 1991 it had close to 1,300 
users working at some forty experiment stations--a load factor 
that makes use of almost all possible beam lines. Seventy-five 
percent of users are French (European demand has been rising 
steeply over the last two years), and participation is evenly 
balanced between the Paris region and the provinces; industrial 
demand (including demand assimilable to industry, such as 
calibration of on-board satellite instruments for ESA via IAS 
[Institute of Space Astrophysics], or experiments conducted by 
CEA's DAM [Directorate of Military Applications]) accounts for 
about 10 percent of all work sessions. The number of projects 
submitted and the number of users have more than doubled in the 
last 6 years. This trend, noted at LURE as well as other 
centers, shows no sign of leveling off--quite the opposite. 
  LURE's weak points have to do with the age of some of the 
equipment: The injector is old, too big, and very costly to 
maintain; the DCI ring, built 20 years ago for elementary 
particle physics, is no longer competitive with machines being 
built now. On the other hand, the Super-ACO could continue to 
play an important role in its domain for many more years if 
furnished with a modern injector. 
  b) Status of the project vis-a-vis ESRF: ESRF is beginning 
to 
get into operation at Grenoble well ahead of schedule, and is 
already obtaining excellent beam quality. However, several 
objective considerations argue for giving French researchers 
access to a complementary machine that operates at lower energy 
levels: 


    -  The ESRF source is unable to cover the ultraviolet to 
far-ultraviolet to soft x-ray range (photons with energy less 
than 1 keV, basically the domain of Super-ACO). Also, it is 
unlikely that the time-structured configuration can be used with 
the ESRF synchrotron radiation source; 
  -  our financial contribution will give French researchers 
access 
to about 25 percent of ESRF's operational availability, the 
equivalent of about ten full-time experiment stations (including 
time used by collaborating research groups). 

    Access will thus be difficult and competition very tough. 
Experience in the neutron domain has demonstrated the utility of 
having, along with ILL, facilities at LLB for purposes of 
training users, conducting standard analytic tests, preparing 
original experiments, developing new technologies, and serving 
the needs of industry. 
  c) Other projects in Europe: Several facilities that are 
comparable to SOLEIL (energies between 1.3 and 2.5 GeV) and 
complementary to ESRF are already in operation or under 
construction in neighboring countries: 


    -  In Germany, DORIS III (at Hamburg) will be augmented, 
per a very recent decision, by the BESSY II in Berlin, a 
third-generation ring optimized for the ultraviolet-far 
ultraviolet-soft x-ray range; 
  -  In Italy, ELETTRA will enter into service in Trieste in 1994 
with a program very comparable to that of SOLEIL; 
  -  In the United Kingdom, since 1987, the SRS at Daresbury has 
been Europe's best source of high-intensity x-rays. A new 
machine is under study (DAPS [Daresbury Advanced Photon 
Source]); In Sweden, construction of the MAX II at Lund has been 
authorized; In Spain, plans are being considered to install a 
2.5-GeV synchrotron in Catalonia (Barcelona). 

    Technical characteristics of the project: Project SOLEIL is 
the result of taking the following factors into consideration: 


    -  user requests, described hereinafter; 
  -  the experience acquired in developing ACO, DCI, and 
Super-ACO; 
  -  experience at the international level, ESRF in particular. 

    The project starts from the concept of a 2.15-GeV positron 
storage ring (i.e. with enough energy for the undulator to 
function properly in the kiloelectron volt range) with about 
thirty emission points, about one-third of which are multi-user, 
for a total of about forty experiment stations. The 
circumference of the ring is close to 200 m. Its energy is 
comparable to third-generation machines such as ELETTRA and 
BESSY II. With optimization of parameters, the ring can be very 
compact and cost-effective. 
  The apparatus supports maximum-flux operation with a total 
intensity of 300 mA (240 packets) and beam life of 15 to 20 
hours, the possibility of operations with one to six packets, 
and unit intensities of 10 mA for more than 10 hours with 
excellent emissivity (greater than Super-ACO at 800 MeV, and 10 
times greater than DCI). It should be noted, and this is the 
most novel feature of the project, that the solution adopted 
meets user needs in terms of both emissivity and beam duration, 
accommodating both temporal structuring and high flux. 
  Most of the technical decisions have already been made, 
thanks in part to the experience acquired by LURE itself and to 
the optimizing solutions adopted by other centers. This is the 
case in particular for alignment techniques, which will be based 
on ESRF's experience (alignment by hydraulic level, with lifters 
capable of effecting displacements on the micrometric scale in a 
gamut of frequencies ranging from .1 to several dozen Hertz 
while preserving excellent time precision). 
  Already finalized options concern utilization of positrons 
(despite its initial cost), sextipoles fully integrated into the 
quadripoles, generalized utilization of split-pair control of 
beam elements, the vacuum chamber, injection, photon beam 
stability, and topography of the building. 
  Two options are still open. They concern radiofrequency 
acceleration and beam lines, an area where LURE, despite its own 
experience, is very closely following developments under way at 
other centers to stabilize photon beams. 
  As for the injector, in light of the experience amassed and 
the options adopted in numerous other projects, the proposal is 
leaning toward the idea of a booster synchrotron adjoining the 
positron source rather than a long linear accelerator. 
Accordingly, the system will include: 


    -  a 200-MeV linear electron accelerator delivering beam 
pulses of 2 to 5 A [Angstrom units] via an electron-positron 
converter; 
  -  a converter (e[.sup]+[/]/e[.sup]-[/] output =0.02 GeV); 
  -  a linear positron accelerator with an energy of 400 MeV; 
  -  a booster synchrotron accelerating the positrons at 2.15 GeV 
before injection into the ring, the two accelerators being built 
by a company with expertise in the field. 

    With the booster option, and assuming it is built at the 
Orsay site, the estimated cost is Fr700 million HT (1991 
prices). The proposal calls for financing in two stages. The 
first (five year) stage corresponds to construction of the 
machine and two-thirds of the beam lines; the second, also five 
years long, would see installation of the final one-third of the 
lines and introduction of experiments. 
  Scientific justification: This takes into account the strong 
pressure for utilization of methodologies already mastered, 
openness toward other research sectors, and the possibility of 
new upstream research in the physics of radiation-matter 
interactions. For the source to have characteristics that meet 
these three objectives, three options were explicitly adopted: 
spectral range, temporal structure, and photon beam polarity. A 
doubly versatile machine was needed: coverage of both UV and 
x-ray bands by numerous insertion units, and operations at 
either high intensity or utilizing the unique temporal beam 
structure of this type of machine. Beyond the intensive 
discussions between engineers and researchers entailed by these 
objectives, an instrument was required which, from an 
interdisciplinary perspective, was optimized in an energy range 
where coupling of structural and electronic research is 
maximized. 
  a) In atomic and molecular physical chemistry, the 
challenges 
first of all concern particles that are unstable or difficult to 
produce. These include radicals and transitory particles that 
govern elementary chemical reactions, van der Waals molecules 
and aggregates, the structure and reactivity of which are not 
precisely understood, and simple and multiple-charge ions found 
in plasmas, the ionosphere, or in interstellar space. Owing to 
high densities, high-resolution spectroscopy of these particles 
is essential. SOLEIL's high-flux capabilities, in the 
ultraviolet as well as x-ray region, will provide that 
resolution; its pulsed character will allow spectroscopy of 
threshold electrons and field ionization. Apart from current 
developments in ion disintegration (selective photochemical 
reactions, dissociation dynamics), this domain is not yet well 
developed, owing to insufficient intensities, whereas in this 
energy range the typical nuclear vibration cycles are equivalent 
in time-span to the duration period of gaps in the inner shells 
(10 fs [femtoseconds]), giving rise to interference effects not 
yet well explored. 
  Finally, in this sector of research, SOLEIL will make it 
possible to perform experiments combining two sources of photons 
(RS [radioscopic source] + laser, or RS + free-electron laser) 
for the study of ionization of excited particles and dynamics of 
short-term dissociation (50 ps [picoseconds]) in order to 
understand transition states in the break-up of complex 
molecules. 
  b) In biophysics, the demand of biocrystallographers in the 
areas of x-ray diffraction, diffusion, and absorption is 
constantly growing. The domains concerned, where the frantic 
pace of international competition impels us to decisive and 
immediate action, range from time crystallography to the study 
of molecular interaction with very large groups of molecules, to 
studies of microcrystal structure, to resolution of the phase 
problem by use of anomalous dispersion at variable wavelengths. 
In this respect, SOLEIL is complementary to existing facilities 
elsewhere, Grenoble in particular. 
  The other category concerns the study, using pulse 
fluorometry, of dynamic and structural properties of proteins in 
solution and multimolecular systems (membranes, micells). 
Synchrotron radiation, which makes it possible to repeat a great 
number of measurements across a wide range of wavelengths of 
excitation, offers the only means of meeting this demand. The 
tunability of energy wavelengths and operability with small 
numbers of packets complement the picosecond laser measurements; 
the high flux levels of SOLEIL's undulators permit studies of 
weakly fluorescent samples as well as kinetic experiments with 
excellent quantification potential. 
  c) In the domain of surfaces and interfaces, the synchrotron 
remains an essential tool, notwithstanding near-field 
microscopy. In the hard x-ray domain, ESRF opens up new 
possibilities, but a majority of experiments must continue to 
rely on an intense white source centered in the soft x-ray 
region (hv less than 3 keV), which ESRF covers rather poorly. By 
permitting x-ray absorption in polarized light, combined with 
anomalous glancing diffraction and stationary waves, it supports 
structural, electronic, and magnetic depiction of imbedded 
interfaces, which are of capital importance in miniaturized 
systems. 
  With SOLEIL, angular photoemission and photodiffraction can 
be further improved with resolutions down to a few meV 
[millielectron volts]. Numerous domains (opening of "gaps," 
quantic "wells," Kondo effect) are sure to benefit. With 
polarization, photoemissivity will yield information on magnetic 
moments at the surface of magnetic materials. 
  SOLEIL's capabilities will allow further progress in surface 
EXAFS [expanded x-ray absorption fine structure] and 
glancing-incidence diffraction on very thin heteroepitaxies, and 
much broader extension of the infrared spectroscopy work begun 
on the Super-ACO with vibrations of adsorbed molecules. The 
primary benefits will be very high resolutions 
(cm[.sup]-1[/]) and excellent sensitivity (up to 
10[.sup]-3[/] unilayers). 
  d) In the materials sciences, x-ray adsorption or 
diffraction 
is important in a great number of domains, in particular 
materials that are unordered on the large or very small scale 
(aggregates, films, multilayers). In addition, the recent trend 
away from stationary systems toward studies of the dynamics 
under stress of the crstallographic and electronic parameters of 
materials creates a considerable need, no more than one-third of 
which currently can be satisfied. 
  In Project SOLEIL, the very important feature of 
polarization, especially in adsorption, will support structural 
anisotropy and studies of local magnetism by selective 
measurement of partial density of spin for a given type of atom. 
By virtue of the geometric characteristics and duration of 
beams, SOLEIL should greatly facilitate adsorption experiments 
not only at high resolution but also with multiple stresses. 
  Another important and unique feature in the domain of 
adsorption, also linked to high resolution, has to do with 
K-threshold light-element spectroscopy (low-energy domain: 
200-3,000 eV). The excellent extractability of different events 
at this level should make it possible to obtain direct 
structural information simply by examining structures near the 
thresholds. 
  With other structural methods (diffusion and diffraction), 
SOLEIL will continue to provide a useful service for a 
traditional but wider community: that of occasional users who, 
having extracted the maximum information compatible with their 
semi-heavy equipment, employ the source for its white spectrum 
and its wavelength tunability, its linear and circular 
polarization capacities, and its microsecond temporal beam 
structuring. It can be predicted that such users, given the 
nature of their needs, will not be using high-energy source such 
as ESRF over the medium term. These users want a high-quality, 
easily accessed source of intermediate energy that incorporates 
recent progress and responds to their needs. This large 
community must not be forgotten, because it plays a very 
important role in current developments on new materials: 
quasicrystals, superconductors, multilayers, fullerenes, etc. 
  Site of the machine: Much of the LURE laboratory's current 
success is a function of the exceptionally fine scientific 
environment in which it is situated: the immediate vicinity of 
the University of Orsay and the Saclay nuclear studies center, 
close to the large universities of Paris. At the technical 
level, LURE has considerable drawing power vis-a-vis the large 
nearby CEA and IN2P3 laboratories. 
  Current estimates of the cost of the project assume a site 
on 
the Saclay plateau, at Orme des Merisiers, where 15 hectares of 
land belonging to CEA is available. The land and soil 
characteristics--important to consider--are excellent. 
  Assuming a site outside Ile-de-France [the Paris region], 
one 
would have to take into account, in addition to problems of 
accessibility, the currently strong interaction with the local 
science and technology community, and the percentage of 
researchers and engineers willing to accompany the project away 
from Orsay, and the costs such a transplantation would entail: 
creation of new work areas, reception facilities, ease of access 
to site, scientific environment, etc. At all events, a gradual 
disappearance of large installations at the Orsay-Saclay complex 
would seriously weaken this important scientific hub. 
  Remarks and recommendations of the Council: At the current 
stage of the proposal, the Council is not in a position to issue 
precise recommendations. The usefulness for the French 
scientific community of having a machine such as SOLEIL seems to 
admit of little doubt. As a scientific instrument it would 
complement the ESRF, toward which France makes a heavy financial 
contribution: Assurances would be needed that the communities 
concerned have the capacity to exploit them both. 
  The most difficult problem with which institutions affected 
by the project must concern themselves is how to finance it. 
Projections of TGE-related expenditures presented in the first 
part of this report appear to leave no resources available, in 
the short term, to finance construction of SOLEIL unless these 
institutions receive significantly larger allocations for TGEs. 
The Council is thus waiting for these institutions to submit 
precise proposals exploring all the possibilities. 
<H5>  Project LHC </H5>
  In its 1991 report, the Council examined the LHC issue, 
which 
at the time was presented in a preliminary form that required 
future technical and financial studies. 
  With the information then at its disposal, the Council was 
in 
a position to "recommend that France maintain a positive 
attitude in pursuit of negotiations to secure approval of the 
project by the member states of CERN, provided however that the 
growth in our own contribution remain limited and that the 
companion appropriations necessary to build the detectors must 
for the most part be found by redeploying current budgets in the 
discipline." 
  At its meeting in September 1992, the Council undertook to 
review the status of progress in the decision-making process and 
on preparation of the detector proposal. 
  The TGE Council took note of an important resolution of the 
CERN Council, adopted unanimously at its December 1991 meeting. 
In that resolution, the CERN Council declared: 


    -  "that in every respect the LHC is the right machine to 
ensure the future of CERN and continuation of its mission;" 
  -  that before the end of 1993 the director general shall 
furnish 
detailed information on the cost and participation of member and 
nonmember states, to enable the Council to move toward a 
decision on the LHC; in particular, information is required on 
the following points: 

    --technical feasibility of the project; 
  --best estimate of the final cost of the machine, sources of 
finance, and timetable for delivery of components; 
  --details of the program of experimentation, its objectives, 
and direct costs to CERN, as well as indirect costs that will 
have to be borne by the financing agencies of the principal 
participating institutions. 
  The year 1992 was marked by important progress in design and 
preparation of the LHC: 


    -  the injection system, utilizing existing accelerators 
(including the 26-GeV PS and the 450-GeV SPS), was tested 
successfully; 
  -  the machine's grid was optimized. Maximum energy of 7.7 TeV 
[teraelectron volts] will be obtained with a field of 9.5 Tesla; 
  -  installation of half the (4 x 12 kW) cryogenic stations is 
under way as part of Project LEP 200. These stations will also 
be used for the LHC; 
  -  fabrication of prototypes of the superconducting magnets is 
progressing at a satisfactory pace. 

    With regard to the strategy for preparation of the 
experimentation program, the Council heard a presentation from 
J.E. Augustin, president of the ECFA (European Committee for 
Future Accelerators). At the European level, the strategy is 
being developed in cooperation with CERN's committee on 
scientific directives and with ECFA. 
  Important steps were taken in 1992, in particular at an 
important colloquium held at Evian in March, where 650 
physicists from 30 countries met for a broad discussion of 
possible experiments and the detectors needed to conduct them. 
  In November, CERN hosted a meeting for public presentation 
of 
the "letters of intent" prepared by three collaborative teams 
that hope to build and operate a detector. Only two detectors 
can be installed adjoining the machine, and the LHC committee on 
experiments will therefore have to make its decisions before the 
close of 1993--probably thereby encouraging some restructuring 
of the groups: 


    -  the ATLAS team has chosen a magnetic field created by a 
large toroid, which permits precise measurement of muons, 
complemented by a superconducting coil in the center. The 
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry uses a liquid argon 
detector; 
  -  the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) team proposes to install a 
high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeter (CeF[.sup]3[/] 
crystals) inside a large superconducting solenoid (3-meter 
radius) providing a 4-Tesla field; 
  -  the L3P (Lepton and Proton Precision Physics) team proposes 
far-reaching modifications to the L3 detector installed for the 
LEP, to adapt it to the LHC. 

    French teams are strongly represented in ATLAS and to a 
lesser degree in CMS and L3P. Their research and development 
efforts have focused on calorimetry, trace measurement, and 
radiation-resistant electronics. They have often come up with 
innovative solutions. 
  Each team involves between 400 and 900 researchers 
representing 50 to 90 laboratories. Depending on which proposals 
are accepted, the estimated cost (exclusive of salaries) would 
be between 300 and 450 million Swiss francs per detector. 
  France's cumulative investment in LEP detectors amounts to 
Fr170 million (1983 francs), or Fr240 million in 1993 currency. 
Assuming a French contribution of 15 percent of the total cost 
of the two LHC detectors, and taking the lower cost estimate 
(600 million Swiss francs), we obtain a burden of about Fr350 
million, or 50 percent more than France's cumulative investment 
in LEP detectors. 
  The Council remains concerned by the magnitude of the 
financial burden which institutions will have to shoulder to 
participate at an appropriate level in construction of these 
detectors. It wishes to obtain detailed information from them on 
how they plan to accomplish this, given that the majority of 
such financing will have to be found by internal reprogramming, 
as it already recommended in 1991. 
  The Council is also waiting to be provided with all the 
information promised to the member-state delegations by the CERN 
directorate--in principle before the end of 1993--before 
rendering a definitive opinion on the project. [passage omitted]
