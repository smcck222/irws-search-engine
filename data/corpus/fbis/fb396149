  [Text] Professor Atsushi Ikai, Faculty of Bioengineering, 
Tokyo Institute of Technology, in cooperation with Suntory Ltd. 
(Shinichiro Torii, president) has succeeded in greatly 
increasing antibody production capability by combining serum 
globulin and an artificial vaccine, which poses no danger of 
infection but does little on its own to stimulate antibody 
production. When researchers tried to produce antibodies against 
the AIDS virus in mice, they found that not only did antibody 
production begin rapidly, but the amount produced was double 
that produced by previous methods. This discovery brings us one 
step closer to creation of an AIDS vaccine. This method is 
expected to be effective in the case of other diseases such as 
malaria for which vaccines have not yet been developed. 
  The artificial vaccine is called a peptide vaccine, and it 
consists of many artificially synthesized antigenic amino acid 
sequences from proteins on the surface of the virus. This kind 
of vaccine is different from a vaccine in which the virus has 
been attenuated, so although the peptide vaccine poses no danger 
of infection, it is very small as vaccines go, and the white 
blood cells (macrophages) that produce antibodies do not readily 
take it up. Therefore, it is not effective in stimulating 
antibody production and its practical application has been 
delayed. 
  Professor Ikai and researchers from Suntory made use of the 
fact that macrophages easily take up _a_2-macroglobulin 
(_a_2M), 
a serum globulin, so they combined the peptide vaccine with 
_a_2M to solve the problem. _a_2M is a serum globulin that 
binds 
to receptors on the macrophage surface. The researchers used 
_a_2M purified from human blood. Suntory researchers 
synthesized 
a peptide sequence of 23 amino acids that plays a major role in 
infection by the AIDS virus, and they used this to make the 
vaccine. 
  When researchers repeatedly injected mice with the vaccine 
and checked the amount of antibody production after three weeks, 
they found that although the peptide alone hardly caused any 
antibody production, when it was linked to _a_2M the effect was 
dramatic, and the mice produced twice the amount as previous 
methods that do spur antibody production but require the use of 
toxic, oil-based adjuvants. 
  Combining the artificial vaccine with _a_2M increases its 
rate of uptake by macrophages roughly fifty times, which also 
greatly shortens the time before antibody production begins. 
  Vaccines in general use are made with attenuated virus. They 
stimulate high antibody production, but because the major genes 
of the virus still remain, there is always a chance of 
infection, which means they cannot be used for an AIDS vaccine. 
With the artificial vaccine there is no fear of infection, and 
safety will be enhanced even more if the essential portion of 
the _a_2M is also synthesized.

<H3>  I. The Necessity for Introducing Low-Pollution Vehicles and

  In Japan the abatement of atmospheric pollution has been 
advocated for quite some time, and to date, various types of 
measures have been devised to counter the so-called fixed 
sources like factories, e.g., emission concentration controls, 
aggregate emission volume controls and restrictions on fuels 
used by factories and the like. 
  As a result of the use of petroleum-fueled internal 
combustion engines as the motors for automobiles, they too, like 
the other fixed pollution-generating sources, have become the 
source of a considerable portion of the total volume of urban 
exhaust gases. 
  For this reason, and in light of what is known about the 
behavior in the environment of various substances in exhaust 
gases and their effects on the human body, a systematic, phased 
response has been devised within the technical framework of the 
petroleum-fueled internal combustion engine designed 
to abate exhaust gas from automobiles, e.g., through the 
establishment of long-term technology development goals by the 
Central Environmental Pollution Countermeasures Council, etc. As 
a result, current petroleum-fueled internal combustion 
engines may be safely called combinatorial aggregates of 
incremental improvement technology which responds to 
widespread demands for environmental considerations in addition 
to such primary requirements for automobile engines as fuel 
consumption and horsepower, etc. 
  In addition, a great many businesses, beginning with the 
road 
transport carriers, and other parties associated with road 
transport, the ones using automobiles, have been giving their 
due cooperation as well in reducing environmental impact by 
implementing rational operations along with timely and 
appropriate introduction of vehicles which have been improved in 
this manner. 
  Although regular progress is being demonstrated in this way 
by the restrictions on individual substances in exhaust gases 
from automobile units, the volume of automobile travel brought 
about by growth in the national economy is increasing, and the 
overall volume of exhaust gases continues to rise. 
  Where this trend is particularly evident is in the 
environmental problems of the greater metropolitan areas like 
Tokyo and Osaka. Specifically, there are many areas where the 
environmental standard for nitrogen dioxide (NO[.sup]2[/]) 
has not been achieved and there is no trend of improvement in 
evidence. In order to cope with this situation, the ``Special 
Measures Law Concerning the Reduction of the Total Amount of 
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) Emitted by Automobiles in Designated 
Areas'' was passed in June of this year, and the basic policy, 
etc. for reducing the total volume of NOx is scheduled to be 
clarified by autumn of this year. According to the Environment 
Agency, once this law is put into effect, environmental quality 
standards will be attained by the year 2000; however, the 
popularization of substantial numbers of low-pollution 
vehicles is being counted upon to achieve this goal. 
  Furthermore, social concern over current environmental 
issues is in transition to a global environmental approach 
on issues like global warming from carbon dioxide 
(CO[.sup]2[/]), and acid rain which is attributed to sulfur 
oxides (SOx) and NOx, etc. In addition, a more global sweep is 
being evidenced, e.g., the UN Conference on the 
Environment and Development was held in Rio de Janeiro in 
June of this year, and a Climatic Changes Framework Agreement 
(Treaty to Prevent Global Warming) obtained the signatures of 
more than 150 countries. 
  The amount of CO[.sup]2[/] emissions per person in Japan 
is among the lowest group among the developed nations, but the 
amount of these very CO[.sup]2[/] emissions is equal to 
approximately 5% (276 million tons) of the world total, 
fourth 
highest in the world. Japan has established an Action Plan 
To Prevent Global Warming designed to promote systematic, 
comprehensive measures to deal with global warming and says that 
it will achieve per-capita CO[.sup]2[/] emission volumes 
which are at the 1990 level in the year 2000. A considerable 
amount of effort is going to be required to achieve this target. 
  That being the case, hereafter, in response to consciousness 
of environmental issues in which the focus will likely be placed 
on the global environment in this manner, the 
question of whether or not some sort of specific results will be 
achieved by petroleum-fueled internal-combustion engine 
automobile technology while pursuing the conventional 
policy of incremental technical improvements is 
likely to become an issue. 
  Regarding this point, there are those who indicate concern 
about trade-off issues between existing technologies already 
developed in response to conventional technical requirements, 
and there is concern that, increasingly, the technical options 
are becoming far too narrow and the solutions more difficult. 
  Naturally, while we continue to feel that it is important to 
keep up with technical challenges in this fashion, there are 
limits to coping with present and future environmental issues, 
and to overcoming and improving on them with this approach 
alone. Especially now, when the trend of society as a whole is 
to demand material contributions toward protecting the 
environment from those connected with road traffic, e.g., a 
great many businesses, beginning with all road transport 
carriers, it is necessary to accelerate actions and measures 
designed to protect the environment by everyone concerned in 
order to take some sort of obvious steps. 
  In particular, the deterioration of the urban environment, 
e.g., the failure to achieve NO[.sup]2[/] emission standards, 
etc., is being pointed out, while on the other hand, at present, 
when it is being recognized that prompt implementation of 
comprehensive measures like the elimination of extreme 
concentrations or the improvement of traffic flow by the 
promotion of road maintenance and upgrades is, very regrettably, 
difficult, the adoption of a comprehensive, tandem approach of 
seeking and promoting possibilities for using 
low-pollution vehicles (low-emission vehicles) or 
vehicles with no exhaust gas (zero-emission vehicles) 
is being recognized as necessary and significant. 
  It is recognized that some of the so-called 
low-pollution vehicles have matured in terms of their 
stage of technical development to the extent that it is possible 
to evaluate them as subjects of study. This study committee 
adopted such a viewpoint, and on the assumption that there are 
vehicles which have possibilities for mitigating in all aspects 
the environmental impact from automobile exhaust gas which would 
be used by road transport carriers who now have great occasion 
to use diesel vehicles, which have contradictory characteristics 
concerning both CO[.sup]2[/] and NOx in particular, and also 
that the degree of their technical maturity has reached a 
prescribed level, the committee decided to subject four types of 
vehicles to study, i.e., energy-regenerating-type hybrid 
vehicles, methanol vehicles, compressed natural gas (CNG) 
vehicles and electric vehicles. 
  In addition, the decision was made to give consideration to 
comprehensive introductory support measures so that these 
vehicles could be introduced in as smooth a replacement cycle 
for conventional vehicles as possible. In line with this, we 
studied whether or not it is possible to use each of these 
vehicles as productive assets. 
  As one of the steps in the study, the committee decided to 
gain an understanding of the operating structures of the road 
transport carriers which would correspond to the actual 
operation of the four types of low-pollution vehicles and then 
to do a compilation of vehicle use realities in the road 
transport industry, to include vehicle procurement methods. 
  The committee decided that if, after having illuminated the 
realities of vehicle usage learned in this manner and having 
confirmed that a market exists which could match the performance 
of low-pollution vehicles, it should be determined that their 
autonomous popularization could not be anticipated in terms of 
the operating structure of the industry, they would take under 
consideration policy support measures. 
<H5>  II. Operating Structure of Road Transport Carriers </H5>
<H5>  1. Size of Freight Carrier Firms </H5>
  We will gain an understanding of this from various types of 
data concerning the present status of freight carriers. However, 
since the currently available data predates the effective date 
for the Second Law on Material Handling, the data still contains 
distinctions such as route and area, etc. According to the 
classification of a small or medium enterprise established by 
the Minor Enterprises Act, as of the end of March 1991, 
99% of 
area carrier firms and 83% of route carrier firms fell 
under 
the small or medium enterprise classification. When divided into 
route and area classifications, small firms accounted for a 
great majority of area trucking firms in terms of 
capitalization, number of employees and number of vehicles. On 
the other hand, among route trucking firms, it appears that 
those capitalized at &yen;100 million or more accounted for 
17%, while those with 301 or more employees accounted for 
19%, 
and that these large firms account for a considerable share of 
transport. 
  Thus, there are a great many medium and small-sized firms 
among the road transport carriers, and so in order to bring up 
the diffusion rate of low-pollution vehicles, it is important 
that we begin working on firms at this operating level and not 
just the large firms.

<H5>  2. Operating Conditions </H5>
  In order to gain an understanding of the business and 
operating realities of road transport carriers, we will analyze 
various kinds of business indicators by size of the carrier 
firms. 
  First of all, in looking at the settlement of accounts 
status, in route trucking, 13 firms were operating at a loss in 
contrast with 98 firms operating at a profit, while in area 
trucking, there were 194 in the black and 28 in the red. No 
particular difference in the ratio of firms operating in the red 
was detected in correlation with route and area trucking. 
However, when analyzed by size, in contrast to the absence of 
any correlation to size for firms operating at a loss among the 
area trucking group, none of the firms operating at a loss among 
the route trucking group were found among firms with 101 
vehicles or more, and one could say there is a clear difference 
correlating to size among the route trucking firms for the ratio 
of firms operating at a loss.

  Secondly, profitability of freight carriers when compared 
with other firms is as follows. Route trucking has risen to the 
4-5% level and area trucking has leveled off at the 
5% level. 
On the other hand, this figure is at the fairly high level of 
7-8% for manufacturing and 7% for the retail 
industry. 
Nevertheless, in the wholesale industry this level is low at 
5%.

  Furthermore, from the standpoint of efficiency, we will try 
to consider indicators such as the rate of earnings on total 
capital. The average rate of recurring profit on total capital 
for route trucking is 5.4% and falls below that for firms 
other 
than those with 1-20 vehicles or with 301 and above. In 
addition, there appears to be a difference in the ratio of 
recurring profits to operating revenue which correlates to the 
size of the firm. In the case of area trucking, the correlation 
between this difference and size is all the more apparent. In 
particular, the average for firms with 1-20 vehicles is 
-1.6% 
and a great many of these firms are operating in the red.

  Also, from the standpoint of financial stability, we will 
consider indicators like liquidity ratio and the like. This 
represents the ratio of liquid assets to current liabilities, 
and normally, when this ratio exceeds 100%, one can 
conclude 
there is no need to worry about short-term solvency. In 
connection with route trucking, other than firms with 1-20 or 
with 301 or more vehicles, this ratio falls below 100% and 
there is lingering concern about short-term solvency. On the 
other hand, in the case of area trucking, excluding firms with 
20 or less vehicles, this ratio exceeds 100% and from the 
standpoint of liquidity, one can say that area trucking firms 
are in better shape. Also, when the ratio of long-term 
capitalization to fixed assets (where one evaluates the 
operating status of long-term capitalization) exceeds 
100%, it 
indicates that there are current liabilities requiring 
short-term repayment in connection with the portion which is in 
excess and that it is being covered by fixed assets capital. In 
route trucking, firms other than those with 1-20 or 301 or more 
vehicles, and in area trucking, firms with 20 or less vehicles 
exceed 100%. Also, among these firms, the individual net 
worth 
ratio is declining as well.

  Judging from the various business indicators cited above, 
the 
operating realities of road transport carriers vary greatly 
relative to the size of their operations. Note: In the majority 
of firms among small and medium-sized enterprises, profitability 
is low, and their operating efficiency and financial structure 
too are not altogether good. In particular, the liquidity ratio 
is quite a bit below 100%, and one could say that there is 
lingering concern about their short-term solvency. 
<H3>  3. Total Expenditure and Composition for Freight Carrier 
Firms </H3>
  In order to analyze the operating realities of the firms, we 
study the composition of the various expenses incurred in the 
course of their business activity. According to small and medium 
cost indicators compiled by the Small and Medium Enterprise 
Agency, the average sales volume of a sound enterprise is 
&yen;309 million, and 96.1% of that goes to cover total 
costs 
with fixed costs accounting for 37.5% and variable costs 
for 
58.6%. Also, the personnel cost ratio, including welfare 
costs, 
employee training and the like, is 38.8%. Fuel costs, 
repair 
costs, and depreciation costs are cited as expense items 
relating to vehicles during the course of business. Depreciation 
costs average &yen;13 million and as a ratio of operating costs 
have grown to 13.6%, a sales volume ratio of 4.4%, 
second only 
to executive salaries and allowances. As for other industries, 
e.g., manufacturing, the figure is &yen;39 million, 3.2% 
of the 
total cost structure; for the wholesale industry it is &yen;9 
million, 0.4% and for retail, it is &yen;2.5 million, 
1.1%. 
Vehicle fuel and repair costs average &yen;8 million, 
2.5% of 
the total cost structure.

  Furthermore, according to the MOT's motor carrier business 
indicators, the ratio of fixed asset depreciation costs is 
3.9% 
for route trucking firms, with 2.8% relating to the 
vehicles. 
Among area trucking firms, vehicles account for 5.0% of 
the 
fixed asset depreciation costs. Also, in totaling up fuel costs, 
maintenance costs and depreciation costs, they account for 
7.6% 
of operating costs among route trucking firms and 14.1% 
among 
area trucking firms, and the cost burden relating to vehicles is 
growing for area trucking firms. 
  Further, if you examine these costs by the numbers of 
vehicles, the weight of vehicle depreciation costs 
for route trucking firms with 50 or less vehicles, it exceeds 
the average for route trucking firms. Among area trucking firms, 
the ratio of vehicle-related expenditures is higher overall when 
compared with that for route trucking firms, and here again, the 
depreciation cost component ratio is higher among smaller firms 
with 50 vehicles or less. 
  The introduction of low-pollution vehicles is a very 
important business issue for road transport carriers. As 
evidenced in the indicators of the Small and Medium Enterprise 
Agency, compared with other industries, their depreciation cost 
burden is higher, and according to MOT indicators, it is obvious 
that the smaller the enterprise, the larger the burden for fuel 
costs, maintenance costs and vehicle depreciation costs 
accounted for in operating costs. In the future, when weighing 
measures to popularize and promote low-pollution vehicles, it 
will be necessary to consider handling measures with business 
realities such as these fully in mind.

Data: MOT, FY1989 Road Transport Firm Business Indicators 


<H5>  4. Bus Company Business Realities </H5>
  In examining bus company business realities, both private 
and 
public, it is obvious that they have become deficit-prone 
business operations. According to the motor transport business 
indicators of the Road Transport Bureau of the MOT, as far as 
can be determined by the indicators when averaged, bus service 
operators, both private and public, are operating at a deficit, 
and even charter bus firms have a very low earnings structure. 
In particular, public bus service companies are running 
substantial operating deficits. Of the general bus service 
companies which qualify to receive MOT regional bus subsidies 
(333 firms), no more than 55, 16.5%, are operating in the 
black, and the overwhelming majority have lapsed into deficit 
operations. 
  In addition, bus companies have high capital investment in 
vehicles and buildings and the like, and a high fixed assets 
ratio (fixed assets/net worth), even in comparison to trucking 
firms. That is also manifested in a low rate of turnover of 
total capital (operating revenue/total capital), and the fact 
that revenue is extremely low compared to the scale of 
investment and that investment efficiency has deteriorated is 
obvious. Because this operating structure has become intrinsic, 
with the exception of public companies, the liquidity ratio 
(liquid assets/current liabilities... indicates the ability to 
make external payments) of bus companies has dropped below 
100%, and they are confronting credit-related problems. 
  When we look at costs per operating kilometer, income per 
kilometer of actual travel is &yen;451, while costs are 
&yen;490. According to the component itemization of these costs, 
the component ratio of personnel costs is very high, vehicle 
maintenance costs account for 2.91%, and vehicle 
depreciation 
costs for 4.43%. The ratio of vehicle depreciation costs 
is 
equivalent to that for the costs of fuel, oil and lubricants, 
and in terms of the overhead burden has become an important 
factor. 
  Thus, bus operations are working under extremely stringent 
conditions, and in a great many cases bus service operators are 
pursuing other lines of business as well. Generally, bus service 
companies are assessed as enterprises having a highly public 
nature, and their credit rating as enterprises ends up being 
boosted. Accordingly, when you examine the ratio of operating 
profit to net sales by size of operation for bus service only, 
among the bus services in question the operating costs exceed 
operating revenue in all cases, regardless of size, but when 
evaluated on an overall enterprise basis, including the other 
lines of business, those bus companies with 1-30 and 301 or more 
vehicles are generating operating profits, and even in terms of 
recurring profit are showing up in the black. 
  Thus, for bus companies which are operating in a business 
environment more severe than that for trucking firms when judged 
as a separate and independent business, the introduction of 
low-pollution vehicles will be a greater burden. However, the 
public bus companies have opportunities to bring in funding from 
general revenue sources, and the pilot introduction of 
low-pollution vehicles in terms of the aspect of environmental 
management is to be anticipated. Also, among the private firms, 
even in those where the bus service operation is running at a 
deficit, when one makes allowance for subsidies from within the 
company, it is perhaps possible that the burden of introducing 
low-pollution vehicles can be covered to a certain extent. 
However, even in that case, reduction of the costs to introduce 
these vehicles will determine the numbers introduced just as it 
will for the trucking firms, and so various types of support 
measures will be needed to facilitate their popularization.

<H5>  III. Current Vehicle Usage of Road Transport Carriers </H5>
<H5>  1. Vehicle Procurement Methods </H5>
  Later on we will present these in detail, but as a measure 
for popularizing low-pollution vehicles which are relatively 
high-priced in comparison to existing diesel vehicles, 
especially among small-scale firms with low liquidity ratios, 
the mitigation of the initial capital burden will be highly 
significant, and it is conceivable that a great many cases will 
require support measures in combination with a lease system 
designed for this purpose. Nevertheless, it appears that at 
present, there are few cases in which these businesses use 
leases to procure vehicles. Accordingly, along with clarifying 
current forms of procurement and the reasons for not using 
leases, etc., by implementing a questionnaire survey of these 
businesses, we gained insight from existing data into the 
circumstances for and problems with using leases when procuring 
vehicles. 
  First of all, let's look at the types and methods of vehicle 
procurement by businesses. According to a questionnaire survey 
sent out to the various branches of the Tokyo Metropolitan 
Trucking Association in which a majority of the members are 
small and medium firms, almost all (23 out of 25) responded that 
``when required, trucks are purchased in small lots,'' and cases 
of combined, large-lot purchases are limited. Also, it is 
obvious that when purchasing vehicles, approximately 60% 
of the 
firms are cognizant that ``it is important because of the need 
for a fixed amount of depreciation costs every year'' from an 
accounting standpoint. 
  Furthermore, as reasons for the poor utilization of leases 
for vehicle purchases, ``because even when money is borrowed, 
funding can be procured at low-interest,'' and ``because of the 
structuring to produce profits for the actual years of a 
vehicle's serviceable life after it is fully depreciated'' were 
cited most often. Also, more than one third of the respondents 
indicated that it is ``because they do not fully understand the 
merits of leasing.''

  On the other hand, according to data of the Japan Leasing 
Association, it is clear that among the forms of procurement for 
trucks and buses, the utilization of leasing is rising. As of 
1990, the number of lease-held passenger cars was 420,000, 
buses, 10,000, and trucks, 680,000, and in terms of component 
ratio, trucks and passenger cars were the more prevalent. Also, 
in terms of the ratio of lease-held vehicles accounted for in 
the numbers of vehicles in use, leases accounted for 7.2% 
of 
buses, for 7.1% of trucks, for 1.3% of passenger 
cars, and for 
an overall average of 2.7%. Whatever class of vehicle one 
considers, lease utilization is rising steadily, and it appears 
this trend is going to continue in the future as well. 

  Incidentally, according to a FY1990 lease demand trends 
survey on leasing overall conducted by the Japan Leasing 
Association, corporations then utilizing leases accounted for 
86.9% of the total, a 2.3% rise in comparison with 
a survey 
conducted in 1986. As for the items being leased, communications 
equipment and exchanges were the leading category, and for 
vehicles, leases were used by 31.5% of enterprises, 
demonstrating a rise of more than 10% in comparison with 
the 
20.2% recorded for 1987. 
  All of which is to say that for low-pollution vehicles, the 
speed of future technical innovation will be greater in 
comparison with existing vehicles, or in other words, as a 
result, the risk of their becoming superannuated is expected to 
be high, and so too there will be a greater need to avoid the 
risk of superannuation associated with the speedy introduction 
of low-pollution vehicles with higher performance, and in this 
aspect, the merit of leasing seems to be growing. 
  As far as we can judge from the data and the survey findings 
mentioned above, for medium and small enterprises vehicle 
procurement is an important business issue and independent 
procurement is the norm. Also, as far as dissatisfaction with 
the lease system is concerned, there are problems relating to 
``the impression that it is relatively expensive,'' and ``the 
terms establishing the residual value, or the period of the 
lease.'' Consequently, in the event assistance policies which 
employ leasing are devised, a system which is responsive and 
easy for businesses to use, and the employment of low-interest 
funding such as fiscal investments and loans designed to negate 
``the impression that leases are relatively expensive'' will 
likely be indispensable. And, it will probably be necessary to 
give consideration to the methods of establishing residual value 
and lease periods as well.

  In any event, if a lease system is incorporated as part of 
the assistance policies, concrete, readily understandable public 
relations (PR) aimed at these businesses is going be a major 
prerequisite. 
<H5>  2. Business Operations and the Realities of Vehicle Usage </H5>
  We sorted out the realities of how trucks and buses are 
being 
used on a daily basis in various businesses primarily on the 
basis of the results of a questionnaire in cooperation with the 
Tokyo Metropolitan Trucking Association supplemented with 
existing data and investigative hearings. Below, we have 
compiled the actual conditions and special features concerning 
the forms of truck and bus usage judged in terms of, (1) size of 
enterprise, (2) transport destination, and (3) items conveyed. 
<H5>  (1) Forms of Usage in Terms of the Size of the Enterprise </H5>
  In the case of the major transport carriers, for usage 
within 
an urban area (travel distances of 50-80 km), 2-ton vehicles are 
the primary choice. However, 4-ton vehicles are used for hauling 
to industry. For suburban, large-volume hauling (travel 
distances of 100-140 km), 5-ton vehicles or larger are used. For 
long-distance hauling (travel distances of 500-600 km), 10-ton 
vehicles or larger are used, and transport is conducted at night. 
  In the case of medium-sized transport carriers, 2-ton 
vehicles are used primarily for short-haul (travel distances of 
30-50 km), and medium-to-long haul transport (travel distances 
of 300-1000 km) is handled with 4-ton and 10-ton vehicles. 
  City-route buses travel around 110 km per day. They always 
perform nearly the same travel pattern (frequent stops, and an 
average vehicle speed of around 11 km/hr.). Also, the per-trip 
travel distance of sight-seeing buses is around 200 km, and the 
travel patterns of buses employed for specific services such as 
shuttle service within airports, etc. are fixed within a 
specific area.

<H5>  (2) Form of Usage in Terms of Transport Destination </H5>
  For transport to factories (travel distance of 70-200 km), 
trips are mostly early morning and daytime, and mainly 4-ton and 
10-ton vehicles are used. Transport to distribution centers is 
handled with 2-ton and 4-ton vehicles for 40-120 km trips, and 
10-ton vehicles are used for trips exceeding 200 km. Trips are 
made primarily in the early morning and daytime. 
  For deliveries to wholesale and retail stores, trips are 
made 
primarily during the day within the cities, and the travel 
distance is 50-150 km. For deliveries to wholesale stores 2-ton 
and 4-ton vehicles are used, and for deliveries to retail stores 
2-ton vehicles are used. 
  In addition, for deliveries to construction sites, a variety 
of vehicles, from 2-ton to 10-ton, are used and the travel 
distances and operating features are diverse as well.

<H5>  (3) Forms of Usage in Terms of Items Conveyed </H5>
  For transport of raw materials (travel distance 200-300 km) 
and spare parts (travel distance 100-300 km), primarily 4-ton 
vehicles are used. For transport of construction materials, a 
variety of 2-ton, 4-ton and 10-ton trucks are used, and the 
operating features are diverse as well. For the transport of 
finished goods, food, daily necessities, books and printed 
material, and liquors, mainly 2-ton and 4-ton vehicles are used. 
Travel distance of around 100 km, primarily daytime trips within 
the cities, and numerous delivery items is characteristic.

  In addition, in sorting out the needs of users vis-a-vis 
trucks and buses in terms of travel features, we found that 
2-ton vehicles often have occasion to operate in back alleys 
because they travel primarily within cities, and are called upon 
to make sharp turns, and they have a great many stop-start 
cycles in their travel. Among 4-ton vehicles, there is a 
tendency to emphasize upgrade capability. 
  For long-distance transport, because there is a lot of cargo 
to deliver and comfortable accommodations are sought due to long 
driving time, etc., primarily 10-ton vehicles are used. Also, 
since refueling in the course of a run is not desirable, 
vehicles with good fuel consumption are sought. 
  In the case of route buses, stops are highly frequent, and 
there are a great many acceleration and deceleration cycles. 
Features such as road performance and ease of handling are 
sought. 
  In the case of long-distance buses running between cities, 
long-distance, overnight, high-speed operation is called for, 
and safety, accommodation and cruising range, etc. are the 
features sought. 
<H5>  3. Current Status of Urban Traffic </H5>
  The present status of truck and bus usage by various 
enterprises is as described above, but here we will address the 
realities of truck usage and possession overall. 
  The number of trucks owned nationwide as of the end of March 
1991, was 8.83 million, and of that, the number of trucks for 
businesses numbered 900,000. In terms of the composition of the 
types of cargo vehicles on a registered vehicle basis, compact 
trucks accounted for just under 70% nationwide in 
contrast with 
full-sized trucks which, conversely, accounted for approximately 
70% of business vehicles. In the case of compact trucks, 
a high 
percentage were gasoline vehicles. We will examine in detail the 
full-sized truck class in which diesel vehicles accounted for 
the majority. In the makeup of business vehicle types, 
full-sized trucks in the 9-ton-and-over-to-under-11-ton class 
were the most prevalent, accounting for 18.8%, followed by 
trucks in the 3-4-ton class at 15.2% and the 2-3-ton 
class at 
15%. However, when full-sized and compact trucks are 
lumped 
together according to carrying capacity, the 2-3-ton carrying 
capacity class vehicles were most prevalent at 19.8%. When 
classified by operating area, the 2-3-ton class vehicles were 
the overwhelming leaders in the Tokyo metropolitan area (Tokyo, 
Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba) at 32.5%, and no more than 
6.2% 
nationwide, while trucks under 2 tons accounted for 10.5% 
in 
the Tokyo metropolitan area and about the same nationwide. In 
the Kinki area (Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo) as well, the ratio of 
2-3-ton class vehicles was higher in comparison with the 
nationwide ratio. In the Nakagyo area (Aichi, Mie), unlike these 
other two areas, the 3-4-ton class vehicles were the more 
prevalent, and the component ratio for 9-11-ton class trucks was 
high as well.

Vehicles 

Data: MOT ``Numbers of Vehicles Owned'' 

Note: Regional data was not classified by type of vehicle (full-sized, compact, etc.) 


  The average transport distance of trucks clearly varies 
according to the carrying capacity of vehicles identified as 
full-sized and compact. The average transport distance for 
regular-sized business trucks is 83.2 km, and for compacts it is 
35.3 km. Also, we consider these in terms of average transport 
distance and number of tons transported per actual working 
vehicle day.

  Kilometers traveled per working vehicle day were 214.2 km 
for 
full-sized vehicles and 105.2 km for compacts, and the number of 
transport tons per working vehicle day were 11.3 tons for 
full-sized vehicles and 1.6 tons for compacts. It appears from 
these figures that in practical terms, refueling is done once a 
day, and so the cruising ranges which these travel distances 
will demand of the low-pollution vehicles to be introduced will 
be considered. For the number of transport tons, the number of 
tons transported per working transport trip, rather than the 
number of tons per day, will be considered for the performance 
required. According to these figures the per-trip tonnage is 5.3 
tons for full-sized vehicles and 0.8 tons for compacts. However, 
large-sized trucks are included among the full-sized class, and 
we need to take into consideration the fact that this inflates 
the figures. 
  Note: Since these figures include times when the vehicles 
are 
running with no cargo, they represent the distances traveled, 
rather than the average transport kilometer for business 
vehicles cited above.

Data: MOT, ``Annual Vehicle Transport Statistics Report'' 

Note: 1. Kilometers traveled per working vehicle day = kilometers traveled/total vehicle 
working days. 2. Number of tons transported per working vehicle day = number of tons 
transported/number of working vehicle days. 3. Number of transport trips per working 
vehicle day = total number of transport trips/number of working vehicle days. 4. 
Kilometers traveled per working transport trip = kilometers traveled/total number of 
transport trips. 5. Number of tons transported per working transport trip = number of 
tons transported/total number of transport trips. 


  Next, we will sort out in simple terms the travel conditions 
within cities. First of all, in terms of trucks in general, the 
travel modes comprise a combination of 4 elements: idling, 
acceleration, constant speed and deceleration. The 10-15-mode 
travel used in calculating such things as automobile exhaust gas 
regulations are representative. And, in diesel vehicle 
regulations, 6-mode-travel is applied to heavy vehicles. In 
FY1994, this will be changed to 13-mode to correspond with the 
10-15 mode. Currently, the average 10-15-mode-travel vehicle 
speed is 22.7 km/h. 

  According to this, in terms of average vehicle speeds, 
although the data is from 1985, the average for Tokyo's 23 wards 
was 14.9 km/h, roughly less than half the national average of 
36.9 km/h. This average has declined in other metropolitan areas 
as well, it was 19.5 km/h in the Osaka-Nagoya area, a reduction 
in average speed of just under 13% for Osaka and of just 
under 
24% for Nagoya when compared with 1980 data. According to 
this 
data, it appears that the average vehicle speed is falling and 
that the frequency of idling is rising as shown in these graphs 
based on the results of study by the MOT's Traffic Safety and 
Nuisance Research Institute. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-17A>           Graph 3-9. Current Travel Modes (10-15 Mode, 11 Mode) </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-17B>           Graph 3-10. Average Traveling Speeds on Public Roads (Peak Hours) </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-17C>           Graph 3-11. Average Vehicle Speed and Idling Cycles per km </FIG>


  Also, since the frequency of idling cycles is high for buses 
because of idling at bus stops and while passengers get on and 
off, in addition to traffic signals and traffic backups, their 
average vehicle speed is low. According to the constant speeds 
established in the urban bus operating schedules for FY1989, the 
average bus speed in the Tokyo metropolitan area was 11.4 km/h, 
and 12.8 km/h in the Osaka-Nagoya metropolitan area, even lower 
than the average vehicle speeds cited above. And, according to 
data on actual Tokyo route buses (Shibuya-Shinbashi, 17 January 
1992), the lowest average speed in one day was 9.15 km/h over 10 
vehicle hours, approximately less than half compared to that for 
the early morning. 
  In addition, backup time at the major intersections within 
Tokyo reached 2,150 hours in 1990. On a per-day basis this was 
equivalent to approximately 6 hours. Thus, for urban travel, 
travel patterns with high idling frequency and low average 
vehicle speed are on the rise.

<H3>  IV. Features and Possible Uses of Vehicle Types Covered by 
Study </H3>
  In this chapter we will sort out the features and specific 
systems as well as possible uses, etc. for (1) hybrid vehicles; 
(2) electric vehicles; (3) methanol vehicles and CNG vehicles 
respectively. 
<H5>  1. Hybrid Vehicles </H5>
  A brief synopsis of the concepts, special features and 
specific systems relating to hybrid vehicles is offered as 
follows: 
<H5>  1) Concepts </H5>

  Hybrid vehicles have internal combustion engines and 
non-internal combustion engines for motors, and depending on the 
travel conditions, etc., have the ability to combine the motive 
power of its non-internal combustion engine with the internal 
combustion engine output, or to make exclusive use of the motive 
power of its non-internal combustion engine. 
<H5>  2) Features </H5>
  We would sort out the principal features of hybrid vehicles 
as follows: 
  (1) Their intent is to allow the merits and demerits of 
internal combustion engines and non-internal combustion engines 
to compliment one another, and to resolve problems such as fuel 
consumption, exhaust gas properties, cruising range, and the 
like. 
  (2) They offer a great deal of flexibility in terms of the 
internal combustion engine for which it is possible to consider 
a wide range of engines such as methanol and natural gas engines 
and not just gasoline and diesel engines, and afford a variety 
of combinations to meet performance requirements. 
  Furthermore, based on the latest technical advances, hybrids 
have been proposed which, instead of being limited to simple 
combination methods, focus on ways to harness energy 
regeneration and on energy conservation measures and the like. 
<H5>  3) Specific Examples </H5>
  Various types of systems have been proposed for hybrid 
vehicles, some examples of the leading specific systems are as 
follows: 
<H5>  (1) Excitation-type Regeneration Systems </H5>

  a. Developed with the aim of lowering pollution, conserving 
energy and reducing the volume CO[.sup]2[/] exhaust. 
  b. Regenerates braking energy and the like and stores it in 
batteries. An electric motor is activated with this 
battery-stored energy and the output of the internal combustion 
engine is supplemented by it for starting, acceleration and 
upgrades. By reducing the load on the internal combustion engine 
with this stored energy, lower pollution, energy conservation 
and the like are to be achieved. 
  c. Capable of sustaining output equivalent to that of 
current 
diesel engines. Reduction of fuel consumption as well through 
the regeneration of energy is conceivable. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-18B>           Graph 4-1. Diesel-Electric Hybrid Vehicle </FIG>

  d. Among the excitation-type regeneration systems, a working 
bus with the HIMR (Hybrid Inverter-Controlled Motor and Retarder 
System) method diesel-electric hybrid system has been perfected, 
and has been put into partial use. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-19A>           Graph 4-2. Diesel-Accumulator-type Hybrid Vehicle </FIG>


<H5>  (2) Accumulator-type Hybrid System </H5>
  a. Developed with the aim of lowering pollution, conserving 
energy and reducing the volume of CO[.sup]2[/] exhaust. 
  b. Braking energy is regenerated and stored with hydraulic 
pressure. A hydraulic pump is activated with this stored 
hydraulic pressure for starting, acceleration and upgrades and 
by reducing the load on the internal combustion engine with this 
hydraulic stored energy, lower pollution, energy conservation 
and the like are to be achieved. 
  c. Capable of sustaining output equivalent to that of 
current 
diesel engines. Reduction of fuel consumption as well through 
the regeneration of energy is conceivable. 
  d. Operational tests with test vehicles are being conducted. 

<H5>  (3) Engine-Generator-type Hybrid Systems </H5>
  a. Technology developed with the aim of improving the 
cruising range of electric vehicles. 
  b. Operates an internal combustion engine at a high 
efficiency rating point to run the vehicle and power an electric 
motor to produce electric power. Stores the surplus energy 
generated by the internal combustion engine in batteries. 
  c. Output performance is equivalent to that of an electric 
vehicle so that the vehicle can be powered by the electric motor 
alone. 
  d. Concept stage (theoretical studies), or basic research 
stage. 
<H5>  (4) Engine-Electric Motor-Combination-type Hybrid System </H5>
  a. Improved energy conservation the main development 
objective. 
  b. System which operates on either the internal combustion 
engine or the electric motor. A variety of methods have been 
proposed over quite some time, but one of the latest systems, 
the VW-Audi System (operates on an electric motor as the primary 
engine for travel within the city and on an internal combustion 
engine as the primary engine for travel outside the city, and 
when the electric power output runs down, it uses the internal 
combustion engine as an auxiliary engine) has been proposed for 
passenger cars. 
  c. Improvement is needed on power output problems to where 
the system is equivalent with gasoline engine systems, as well 
as on the cruising range. 
  d. VW-Audi is perfecting the system on the passenger car 
level. It is in the theoretical study stage in Japan. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-19B>           Graph 4-3. VW Hybrid System </FIG>

<H5>  4) Possible Uses </H5>
  Considering things like the technical features of hybrid 
vehicles like those described above, they are judged to be 
particularly suitable for large-city traveling. As pointed out 
earlier, travel within cities demonstrates a pattern of 
repeating starts and stops, and hybrid vehicles devised to 
regenerate braking energy can be described as systems with high 
introduction value. 
  Also, the introduction of hybrid vehicles requires no 
provision of special infrastructure, and so one can claim there 
are few physical impediments to their introduction. Furthermore, 
test operations are proceeding smoothly, and technical 
reliability is growing. 
<H5>  2. Electric Vehicles </H5>
  We will sort out the concept and features of electric 
vehicles as automobiles, and the issues, etc. presently being 
confronted as follows: 
<H5>  1) Concept </H5>

  Electric vehicles use electric power as their energy source 
and operate with electric motors. Charging batteries are used 
primarily as the energy supply source. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-20A>           Graph 4-4. Vehicle Component Diagrams </FIG>


<H5>  2) Features </H5>
  Given that it eliminates entirely exhaust gases with SOx and 
NOx while operating, and that, in terms of the electricity 
generating source, the volume of CO[.sup]2[/] gas emitted is 
small compared to that of gasoline vehicles, the electric 
vehicle is the ultimate expression of a low-pollution vehicle. 
Also, it has the added advantage of producing very little noise. 
<H5>  3) Problems </H5>
  At present, 1,000 vehicles or more, mainly compacts and 
light 
vehicles, are being used on the road in Japan, but the short 
per-charge cruising range (approximately 100-150 km at a 
constant speed of 40 km/h, around 50 km within the city), and 
the short life span of the batteries have been pointed out as 
problems in terms of their use. Also, continuing new development 
is needed on systems overall for electric vehicles because the 
current price levels are very high, from 2 to 10 times that of 
existing vehicles, and that wide variation is also a major issue 
in terms of popularizing their introduction. 
  Furthermore, acceleration is poor, and the driveability in 
cities, where responsive driving is called for, leaves something 
to be desired. And for vehicle design as well, current designs 
are premised on lead storage batteries, and design constraints 
in terms of weight and space are imposed. It appears that in the 
future factors like the aging of the truck operator population 
and the employment of some women will be inevitable, and if 
attempts are made to offset this with chassis design strategies 
as part of the measures to secure a labor force, these storage 
batteries might become limiting factors. 
  In order to solve these problems, development of smaller, 
more powerful storage batteries (high-energy-density batteries) 
is needed, and a great deal of hope is placed on results from 
development work on storage batteries as mobile, high-output 
sources of electricity being promoted by the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI). In this connection, 
research and development (R&amp;D) on a new type of compact, 
high-performance battery, including a fast-charge system, began 
in April of 1992, and along with it research studies are to be 
initiated on the provision of social systems and infrastructure 
which will support the mass popularization of electric vehicles. 
It is also anticipated that in the future, with mass production, 
there will be substantial declines in the price levels of 
electric vehicles. 

<H5>  4) Possible Uses </H5>
  At the current stage of development, in terms of road 
performance, etc., it would be difficult for electric vehicles 
to compete with existing diesel vehicles, especially in carrying 
capacity in the 2-ton class or above. However, once the essence 
of electric vehicles is understood, one can assume that because 
they produce no exhaust gas and very little noise, they will be 
used actively in specific fields. And, with future advances in 
storage battery technology, gradually, their fields of use are 
likely to broaden. 
<H5>  3. Methanol Vehicles </H5>
  We will sort out the concepts and features of methanol 
vehicles as automobiles, and the specific issues they are 
confronting at present as follows: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-21A>           Graph 4-5. Areas of Responsibility of Related Industries in Electric Vehicles and Gasoline Vehicles </FIG>

<H5>  1) Concepts </H5>

  With methanol vehicles there are two types of concepts, the 
auto type and the diesel type. The auto type is a vehicle 
mounted with a methanol engine which is a slightly modified 
gasoline engine, and the diesel type is a vehicle equipped with 
a spark ignition device or glow plug ignition device based on a 
diesel engine. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-21B>           Graph 4-6. Auto-Type Methanol Engine </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-22A>           Graph 4-7. Diesel-Type Methanol Vehicle </FIG>


<H5>  2) Features </H5>
  With the auto-type methanol vehicle it is possible to 
achieve 
exhaust gas levels which are equivalent to those of gasoline 
engines for CO, HC and NOx because of the use of a ternary 
catalyst. And, with the diesel-type methanol vehicle, NOx 
exhaust content is lower than that of diesel engines and black 
smoke is not exhausted. 
<H5>  3) Problems </H5>
  With equivalent capacity fuel tanks the cruising range per 
fillup is short, half that of gasoline and diesel vehicles, and 
so it is limited to short-range service like pickup and delivery 
within cities. 
  Also, their use for long-distance transport would require 
the 
installation of a fuel supply network. While long-distance runs 
would be possible by increasing the carrying capacity of the 
fuel tanks, it would have to be at the cost of lowering the 
effective carrying capacity of the vehicle. 
  In addition, there are technical problems like the corrosion 
resistance of the fuel supply system materials, and with the 
auto-type, improving the low temperature starting and high 
temperature restarting performance and reducing the levels of 
unburned methanol and aldehyde in the exhaust gas, etc. 
<H5>  4) Possible Uses </H5>
  Methanol vehicles have already been under test operation for 
an extensive period of time and a broad field of use is assumed. 
However, as cited above, the cruising range per refuel is short 
and the installation of new fuel supply facilities will be 
required, so for the time being their use will be focused on 
travel within cities. In the future, as fuel-supply networks are 
established, it is assumed they will be used in long distance 
travel modes as well. 
<H5>  4. CNG Vehicles </H5>
  We will sort out the concepts and features of CNG vehicles, 
and the issues and specific systems, etc. as follows: 
<H5>  1) Concepts </H5>
  Natural gas vehicles (NGV) are vehicles fueled with natural 
gas, and NGV presently operating are classified according to the 
form of the natural gas in the fuel tanks: as compressed natural 
gas (CNG) vehicles or as liquefied natural gas (LNG) vehicles. 
  The total number of NGV presently operating in the world is 
estimated to be from 750,000 to 1 million (according to a 
``Clean Fuels Report'' article of April 1990), and most of these 
are CNG vehicles. LNG vehicles on the other hand, have yet to be 
generally popularized due to difficulties with the fuel supply 
and storage aspects, and so, other than some in the U.S., only a 
very few are in use. 
  There are also adsorbed natural gas (ANG) vehicles which 
store natural gas at low pressure (1/5 - 1/3 of the pressure of 
CNG vehicles) using an adsorbing material, but at present, these 
are in the research stage on natural gas adsorbing materials and 
have not been put into practical application. 
<H5>  2) Features </H5>
  We will sort out the main features or advantages of CNG as 
follows: 
  (1) Natural gas fuel has been established as an energy 
substitute for petroleum, reserves equivalent to those of 
petroleum have been confirmed, and it is endowed with superior 
supply stability since the producing nations are not 
disproportionately located in the Middle East. 
  (2) It has a low CO[.sup]2[/] generation rate per calorie 
unit (70% that of petroleum). 
  (3) Because impurities are removed when it is liquefied, the 
purity of the methane is high and it has great potential for 
lowering pollution. 
  (4) The following can be pointed to for its features as an 
automotive fuel: 
  a. It has a high octane value of around 130 and superior 
knocking resistance, enabling a high-compression-ratio engine as 
a result. 
  b. Lean-burn stability parameters are broader, resulting in 
improved fuel consumption (energy conserving). 
  c. By burning in a mixture with light oil, it is possible to 
use natural gas as a fuel in diesel engines without modifying 
them by adding plugs. Technical development is underway on the 
assumption that this will result in lower exhaust of black smoke 
and NOx, and this will have the effect of improving the vehicle 
usage process. 
  d. Because it is a gas fuel, it has good starting properties 
in cold climates. 
  e. Since fuel supply will use gas pipelines, vehicle 
transport with tank trucks and the like are not necessary. 
  f. Since impurities are not found in the fuel, it will be 
possible to extend engine life and to reduce maintenance and 
administrative costs. 
  (5) When converting vehicles into NGVs, one needs only to 
modify a gasoline or diesel vehicle's fuel supply system, spark 
or ignition system (only for CNG diesel type vehicles) and, as 
needed, the compression ratio. Vehicle performance already has 
been demonstrated in the case of gasoline-type vehicles. Also, 
with mass production, it is possible that the costs can be kept 
at a level that is equivalent to that of conventional vehicles. 
<H5>  3) Problems </H5>
  The principal CNG problems are as follows: 
  (1) The areas in Japan which are supplied with natural gas 
by 
pipeline are limited to the major metropolitan areas and the 
domestic natural gas production areas of Shinkata, Akita and 
Chiba, and at present, this network cannot be quickly expanded 
nationwide. 
  (2) On-board space must be secured and vehicle weight 
increased in order to accommodate a fuel storage cylinder. 
  (3) The per-refuel cruising range is short, around one 
fourth 
that of gasoline and diesel vehicles equipped with identical 
capacity fuel tanks, so they are limited to short-range service 
such as pickup and delivery duty within cities. 
<H5>  4) Specific Examples </H5>
  A variety of system types have been proposed for CNG 
vehicles, and these are roughly classified as light and heavy 
vehicle types, and generally categorized according to engine 
system and form of fuel usage. 
<H5>  Categories of CNG </H5>
  Light Vehicles: Bifuel, gasoline and CNG, systems (fuel 
switching), and CNG-exclusive systems. 
  Heavy Vehicles: Bifuel, gasoline and CNG, systems; 
dual-fuel, 
diesel fuel and CNG, systems (mixed burn); and CNG-exclusive 
systems. 
  They also can be classified in terms of two combustion 
methods, the lean-fuel-air-combustion (lean burn) method and the 
theoretical-air-fuel-ratio-combustion (stoichiometric) method. 
<H5>  (1) Gasoline/CNG Bifuel Vehicle </H5>
  The gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle is one that is capable of 
interchangeably using the two fuels, gasoline and CNG. A 
majority of the NGVs presently operating in the world are 
gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicles which are gasoline vehicles that 
have been modified by adding CNG fuel systems. Conversion kits 
for these modifications can be procured cheaply overseas. The 
reason for the spread of this method appears to be due to the 
lower convenience of vehicles fueled with CNG alone, as a result 
of the restricted cruising range (travel distance per tank of 
fuel) and fuel supply facilities. 
  In gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicles, the CNG is stored in a fuel 
cylinder under 150-200 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] of pressure and after 
it travels through a fuel pipe and it is reduced to 
near-atmospheric pressure in a pressure regulator 
(pressure-reducing valve) located in the engine compartment, it 
is fed to the engine through a gas/air mixer. As for the engine 
combustion method, in nearly all cases in Japan it is the same 
as that for gasoline engines, the theoretical air-fuel ratio 
combustion method, in which the air-fuel ratio (_l_) is 
operated 
at close to 1.0, is employed, and in order to purify the exhaust 
gas, a ternary catalytic device is added. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-24A>           Graph 4-8. Schematic of Foreign Gasoline/CNG Bifuel Vehicle </FIG>


<H5>  (2) Diesel Fuel/CNG Dual-Fuel Vehicle </H5>
  Natural gas has a low octane rating in comparison to light 
oil and it is hard for auto-ignition to occur, and so it is 
difficult to use in this manner in compression-ignition type 
diesel engines. Therefore, if one is going to combust natural 
gas in a diesel engine, an ignition source is needed. 
Accordingly, one gets the natural gas to combust by modifying 
the fuel and intake systems and using light oil as the ignition 
source. This is referred to as the diesel fuel/CNG dual-fuel 
system. The diesel engine is operated with a high compression 
ratio, and so it is possible to make more efficient use of 
natural gas with it than with a gasoline engine. However, 
because the kits to convert diesel vehicles into diesel fuel/CNG 
dual-fuel vehicles have not come into wide use at present, the 
price is high, and the installation is more complicated than in 
the case of a conversion to a gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle. 
Nonetheless, since the use of this type of vehicle is 
conceivable as a measure to improve the use of diesel vehicles, 
there are hopes for technology development. 
<H5>  (3) CNG-Only Vehicles </H5>
  Gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle and diesel fuel/CNG dual-fuel 
vehicle engines use a number of different fuels, and so while 
they are optimized to make the best use of the combustion 
features of natural gas, they cannot help but do an inadequate 
job. CNG-only vehicles are mounted with engines designed for CNG 
in order to make the best use of the combustion characteristics 
of natural gas. For cases in which the vehicle is being 
converted from a gasoline vehicle, a 
theoretical-air-fuel-ratio-combustion method engine is used. For 
conversions from diesel vehicles, a lean-fuel-air-mixture method 
is under development. 
  CNG-only vehicles, including those converted from diesel 
vehicles, are mounted with diesel-type, premixed, 
single-chamber-ignition system engines; diesel-type, premixed, 
precombustion-chamber-spark-ignition system engines; a 
mechanical-carburetor-control system engine developed by Gasunie 
NV (The Netherlands); and an engine in which the fuel-air-ratio 
is electronically controlled developed by TNO (The Netherlands). 
<H5>  5) Possible Uses </H5>
  Numerous CNG vehicles already are in actual use in various 
foreign countries, and from a technology development standpoint 
there are few problems. However, CNG-only vehicles have a short 
per-refuel cruising range, and so their use will be focused in 
cities. As stated earlier, the CNG supply system is limited to 
areas which are focused on large cities, and these CNG-only 
vehicles can be described as suitable for use in large cities 
where the environmental problems are severe. 
  Since CNG dual-fuel vehicles can use diesel fuel as well, it 
will be possible to use them for long-distance trips as well. If 
they are used as transit vehicles and the like for major cities, 
the claim could be made that their use would be highly valuable 
from an urban environmental standpoint. 
<H3>  V. Study Concerning the Social Infrastructure Upon Which 
Introduction of These Vehicles Is Premised </H3>
  1) The low-pollution vehicles addressed by this study 
committee are hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, methanol 
vehicles and CNG vehicles. Hybrid vehicles are fundamentally 
based on light oil-fueled vehicles, and do not require road 
transport carriers and others to make new investments in fuel 
supply facilities and the like or in related infrastructure. 
  On the other hand, for electric, methanol and CNG vehicles, 
the use of their energy/fuels as fuel for conventional 
automobiles had not been foreseen, and so no nationwide supply 
system for them as automotive fuel has been established. 
Therefore, when road transport carriers have attempted to use 
these vehicles, they have had to procure the energy sources, and 
in addition, to set up facilities to supply their vehicles on 
their own. 
  Nonetheless, as confirmed by the questionnaire study 
conducted as part of this study committee's work, it has been 
difficult for urban businesses to add on large-scale fuel 
facilities to their company sites, and restrictions on the 
further establishment of supply facilities and questions about 
how uninterrupted supplies of fuel are going to be secured, 
etc., have led to difficulties in expanding the scale of supply 
of petroleum-substitute fuels. On the other hand, until these 
issues are overcome, the reality is that there can be no clear 
awareness that we must use petroleum-substitute-energy vehicles. 
  For the service stations which sell conventional gasoline, 
etc. and which are in the most convenient locations to supply 
petroleum-substitute fuels, the situation has been one in which 
they have had no confidence whatsoever concerning the volume of 
sales that can be anticipated, and whether it can succeed as a 
business, and the fact that there has been no choice but to be 
negative toward new investment has been a major obstacle from 
the standpoint of establishing petroleum-substitute-energy 
supply stations. 
  2) Nonetheless, in light of the very recent rise in concern 
about global environmental issues, etc., a major shift in energy 
supplier awareness of petroleum-substitute energy supply is 
evident. To support this, we cite the report of the 
``Petroleum-Substitute Energy, Energy Supply Systems for 
Automobiles Study Committee'' (22 June 1992) which studied 
petroleum-substitute energy supply systems with the 
participation of the ``National Federation of Petroleum Dealers' 
Associations,'' an association of petroleum dealers. 
  This report: 
  i) Provides a uniform assessment of the role of 
petroleum-substitute-energy vehicles saying, ``they will have 
the effect of killing two birds with the same stone by resolving 
pressing issues like environmental policies for the reduction of 
CO[.sup]2[/] and energy policies on lessening the degree of 
dependence on petroleum.'' 
  ii) Adopts an aggressive energy-supply-side attitude, 
indicating that ``the relationship between 'alternative-energy 
vehicle R&amp;D and popularization' and 'the establishment of 
energy 
supply networks for alternative-energy vehicles' is a 'chicken 
and egg' relationship, and until we cut through this dilemma, 
rapid popularization of alternative-energy vehicles cannot be 
anticipated. Rather, there is a need to establish the role of 
both as 'two wheels of the same vehicle' and to promote both in 
a systematic, policy-type manner.'' 
  iii) Further mentions the handling of service stations and 
states that they should make efforts to be able to handle 
automotive energies other than gasoline and light oil (CNG, 
methanol, electricity) in the medium-to-long term. 
  iv) Pointing out that there are dangers with any form of 
energy, and in terms of urban disaster prevention, the separate 
establishment of supply stations for these respective energies 
is not desirable, and that the cost of land is high in urban 
areas where the need for alternative-energy stations is great, 
and so the cost of establishing alternative-energy stations 
could be prohibitive, the report advocates ``that the provision 
of infrastructure be undertaken by making use of 60,000 service 
stations nationwide.'' 
  The report further clarified the study committee's position 
on the provision of infrastructure by indicating in particular 
that in using existing service stations, ``we should attempt to 
establish alternative-energy stations as model operations for 
the first three fiscal years, and for the time being, 
policy-type incentives such as subsidies, etc. would appear to 
be needed because of the lack of commercial interest.'' 
  In accord with this, the Agency of Natural Resources and 
Energy (ANRE) has formulated the ``Environmental Vehicles 
Popularization Infrastructure Program (Eco-Station/2000 
Program).'' 
  In concise terms, it aims for the establishment of 2,000 
``eco-stations'' by the year 2000; calls for the provision of 
about 100 ``eco-stations'' as model operations during the 
initial phase of the program, from 1993 through 1995; for 
national treasury grants to cover the expenses; and for 
nationwide development of the remaining stations from 1996 to 
2000 with provision of the required funding through a system of 
interest-free loans. 
  The budget request relating to ``eco-stations'' for FY1993 
is 
&yen;1.8 billion, and a very major step has been taken relating 
to the provision of a supply infrastructure for 
petroleum-substitute energies. 
  In other words, in connection with the provision of a supply 
network for automotive petroleum-substitute energies, it is safe 
to say that, at the very least, there are prospects for a 
solution to this issue in the form of facility establishment by 
suppliers at a prescribed pace. 
  Thus, based on current circumstances in which an increase in 
the ``number of taps'' is being affirmed, the focus in terms of 
the prime issue for road transport carriers relating to the 
supply of alternative energies likely will shift to the 
questions concerning whether or not supply margins for 
petroleum-substitute energies will be stable enough for 
automotive markets in the context of world or Japanese domestic 
demand, followed by questions concerning how prices will react 
once automotive fuel demands are created as new sources of 
demand for these energies. 
<H5>  (1) Electric Power Supply </H5>
  In looking at the supply and demand structure of electric 
power which is the motive energy for electric vehicles, one 
finds that there are major swings in the course of a single day, 
with consumption high during the day and low at night. At the 
same time that daytime electric power supply and demand is 
growing tighter, the range of fluctuation between day and night 
demand is getting bigger from year to year as well. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-26A>           Graph 5-1. Daily Electric Power Demand Load Curve </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-26B>           Graph 5-2. Changes in the Biggest 3-Day Averages per Month </FIG>


  In the event electric vehicles are popularized in large 
numbers, it is anticipated that electric power supplies will 
grow all the more tight if things like daytime charging of 
electric vehicles and fast-charging, etc. are carried out. 
Electric power has superior features, e.g., it is clean and can 
be used for a variety of purposes. Conversely, the fact that it 
cannot be stored is a drawback. As a result, facility capacity 
must be slightly more than peak demand. Consequently, facility 
utilization rates (annual amount of electric power output 
divided by 8760 hours and then multiplied by 100) tend to be 
low, and the generating costs end up being that much higher. 
  In order to cope with these circumstances, it is necessary 
to 
attempt to level the load by introducing a system of rates 
differentiated by time periods. A time-differentiated-rate 
system attempts to facilitate consumer load shifting and to 
smooth demand load by establishing different rates for peak-load 
and low-load periods. 
  It will be necessary to encourage the charging of electric 
vehicles at night and to smooth out the supply and demand 
balance through the introduction of this kind of night rate 
system. Also, if low-cost, night-rate charging can be used, it 
will contribute to improved electric vehicle energy costs, and 
so this too will serve to promote their popularization. 
  First of all, development of an electric vehicle 
fast-charging system is to be initiated this fiscal year using a 
new type of battery power storage system (making effective use 
of nighttime power output by storing it and then using it for 
charging demand during the day) being developed by the New 
Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization 
(NEDO). In addition, in order to promote the popularization of 
electric, methanol and CNG vehicles, MITI has announced an 
``eco-station'' program to establish 2,000 stations by the year 
2000 which will supply electricity and natural gas, and is 
studying the provision of subsidies beginning in 1993 to be used 
to cover the costs of remodeling existing gas stations. 
  Thus, while the provision of infrastructure for the use of 
electric vehicles is inadequate, it is possible to make the 
assessment that steady progress is being made. 
<H5>  (2) Methanol Supply and Demand </H5>
  First of all, in looking at the international supply and 
demand for methanol, current estimated annual worldwide demand 
is approximately a little less than 20 million tons, around 
80% 
of the sustainable supply (approximately 23 million tons). In 
terms of regions, supply capacity is great in North America and 
Eastern Europe, while demand is great in North America and 
Western Europe.

  Also, in terms of methanol uses, in addition to being used 
as 
a chemical feedstock to produce things like formalin and 
terephthalic acid, etc., in recent years it has been in the 
spotlight as a feedstock for MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) 
which is used as a basic component for elevating the octane 
rating of high-octane gasoline. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-27A>           Graph 5-4. Methanol Uses (Worldwide Basis) </FIG>


  Next, if one looks at the CIF (cost, insurance, freight) 
price of refined methanol as an indicator for understanding the 
methanol supply and demand situation in Japan, considerable 
fluctuation from year to year is evident as shown in Graph 5-5. 
This demonstrates instability in the supply and demand structure. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-27B>           Graph 5-5. Changes in Methanol Production, Import and CIF </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-27C>           Graph 5-6. Changes in Methanol Demand and Price </FIG>



  The raw material for methanol itself is natural gas, and 
there is general consensus on the point that there is no need 
for concern about a shortage in the supply of natural gas. 
Therefore, it seems there is no need to consider a shortage in 
methanol feedstock as a factor in future supply and demand 
instability. 
  On the contrary, current price fluctuations are the primary 
cause of supply and demand imbalances. The methanol production 
industry is a typical process industry, and when a methanol 
plant is expanded it is on the scale of 600-700,000 tons per 
plant; in other words, expansion is conducted on the order 
3% 
of the global supply capacity. When demand rises, given the 
comparatively high operating rates of current facilities, price 
jumps occur easily, and this promotes strong motivation to 
increase production facility capacity, but after capacity 
increases, it creates noticeable surplus capacity once a decline 
in demand occurs, leaving a market structure susceptible to 
``pig cycle'' types of price fluctuations in which prices slump. 
  In addition, at present, there is no consensus on which 
types 
of service vehicles M85 and M100 respectively are going to be 
used for, and, as indicated in connection with this point by the 
``Energy Supply Systems for Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles 
Study Committee'' mentioned earlier, ``comprehensive study is 
needed, to include the social and economic aspects, and not just 
the technical aspects.'' 
  In any event, if one takes the long view, it will likely 
require efforts to establish a stable supply and demand 
relationship which is independent of supply and demand for 
chemical-feedstock methanol in order to secure stable supplies 
of methanol as an automotive fuel. 
  On top of that, because of properties like the formation of 
combustible, explosive gas compounds and invisible inflammation, 
etc., methanol is regulated by the Fire Protection Law, the 
Poisonous and Deleterious Substances Control Law, and the Labor 
Safety and Health Law, and since there must not be any 
discharges outside the systems of use, if widespread 
popularization with ordinary users is anticipated, it is 
conceivable that revisions of the relevant laws and ordinances 
or the creation of new standards will become necessary. 
<H5>  Natural Gas Supply and Demand </H5>
  First of all, in looking at the supply and demand structure 
of natural gas which is the motive energy of CNG vehicles, we 
learned that the worldwide demand for natural gas in 1990 was 1 
trillion 931 billion cubic meters, a 2% increase over the 
year 
before. The former Soviet Union and Central Europe accounted for 
approximately 40% of the overall consumption. Total global 
production volume in 1990 was 1 trillion 957.1 billion cubic 
meters, a 2% increase over the year before. The former 
Soviet 
Union produces approximately 40% of the world's total and 
the 
U.S. approximately 25%. The former Soviet Union in 
particular 
has greatly expanded its production, approximately four-fold 
over the last 25 years. 
  With natural gas there is little emission of SOx and NOx, 
and 
even the emission volume of CO[.sup]2[/], which is a cause of 
global warming, and is 70% that of petroleum and 
60% that of 
coal when combusted. Therefore, it is evaluated highly as a fuel 
in terms of environmental considerations. 
  Also, in terms of supply, it is stable in comparison with 
other fuels. The resource supply nations are widely distributed 
in places like the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia, etc., 
and there are 12 years more proven reserves than there are for 
petroleum. Japan depends on the Middle East for 6% of its 
natural gas supply, very low compared to 70% for its oil 
supply. 
  In view of these facts, natural gas appears to be a 
desirable 
petroleum-substitute fuel for transport. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-28A>           Graph 5-7. Composition of Proven Reserves of Natural Gas </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-28B>           Graph 5-8. Composition of Proven Reserves of Natural Gas </FIG>


  Natural gas demand is forecast to grow 3% annually 
until the 
year 2000. Petroleum demand, on the other hand, will grow at an 
annual rate of 1.5%. Under the circumstances with 
environmental 
issues and the like, energy demand in Europe has begun to shift 
rapidly to natural gas. There are prospects that by the year 
2010, the ratio accounted for by natural gas for all energy 
sources, including petroleum and coal, will expand from the 
current 15% to 30%. 
  In terms of supply as well, with the collapse of the Soviet 
Union, which has been the leading supplier nation up to now, 
development is now under way with western capital. Furthermore, 
the Middle East, which accounts for 30% of total 
reserves, is 
being counted upon to satisfy the increase in demand, and the 
probability of stable supply is growing. 
<H5>  (Infrastructure Establishment) </H5>
  The biggest obstacles to natural gas being used for vehicles 
are the establishment of a supply infrastructure and especially, 
the securing of supply for the ``eco-stations.'' 
  In Japan the areas which have natural gas pipelines 
installed 
and which are being supplied are limited to large cities and 
their environs and domestic natural gas producing areas such as 
Shinkata, Akita and Chiba, etc. The concept of a pipeline 
traversing the whole country (targeted completion in 2010) and 
the like have been rumored, but in any event, Japan is in no 
position to develop a pipeline network right away. 
  Within the currently supplied areas there is the possibility 
of using the existing pipelines for terminal distribution, and 
it is conceivable that refueling facilities for CNG vehicles 
could be established with relative ease. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-29A>           Graph 5-9. Town Gas Supply Areas Which Supply Natural Gas </FIG>


  At present, six CNG dedicated stations have been established 
nationwide and are being used to supply fuel to CNG vehicles 
owned by the gas companies. CNG refueling is rapid and timed, 
and the refueling technology has been proven overseas. The 
development and establishment of compact, rapid refueling 
facilities (compressor and dispenser) is a pressing matter, and 
in Japan a 3-year project was started in FY1992 with an AIST 
subsidy for the ``development of practical NGV refueling 
equipment,'' and needed infrastructural technology is being 
readied for mass popularization. 
  Furthermore, in order to popularize CNG vehicles, relevant 
legal system revisions and the like will be sought. The revision 
of the High-Pressure Gas Control Law and the establishment of 
vehicle technical standards, etc., and various types of 
environmental apparatus directed toward mass popularization have 
become urgent matters.

<H3>  VI. Estimates of Costs To Introduce and Operate 
Low-Pollution Vehicles </H3>
<H3>  1) At this juncture we are going to make estimates of the 
introductory and operating costs for the hybrid, electric, 
methanol and CNG vehicles which are to be targeted for </H3>

introduction by the road transport carriers, bearing in mind 
analyses of the studies cited earlier and the like. The object 
of these cost estimates is to enable forecasting concerning such 
issues as how big a burden would be imposed on these businesses 
if they introduce and operate the vehicles in question, and if 
various types of support policies are devised, how effective 
would they be? 
  In order to establish more realistic premises and take into 
account the features, etc. of each of the vehicle types, the 
estimate premises are not necessarily common to all, but the 
basic cost framework was made common to all. Thus, before 
getting into the estimates for each of the low-pollution 
vehicles, we will sort out the common premises. 
  The following items are offered as common premises or 
thinking: 
  (1) We used estimated prices formulated on the basis of data 
on the various vehicle types provided by the auto industry of 
Japan as a premise of study by this study committee, and on the 
basis of investigative hearings with associated industry groups 
and enterprises. 
  (2) It is assumed that fuel is to be procured from 
``eco-stations'' and the like. Note: We will explain fuel price 
later on as well, but because it is difficult to accurately 
predict, as a premise of this exercise, we formulated and used 
uniform-estimate values. 
  (3) Expense accumulation items were placed in six areas: 
vehicle price; maintenance costs; fuel costs; operating costs; 
infrastructure and facility costs; and education and training 
costs. 
  (4) To evaluate low-pollution vehicle introduction costs, we 
used the method of comparing the total costs of the accounting 
period, which totals the initial costs (vehicle price, 
automobile acquisition tax, etc.) and operating expenses (fuel 
costs, expendable items, interest payments, etc.), and the 
average annual costs with those for current base vehicles. 
  In estimating the introductory and operating costs of 
low-pollution vehicles using premises such as these, we found 
that with a simple purchase case, assuming average service life, 
the average annual operating cost in the case of a hybrid 
vehicle is &yen;1.51-1.89 million/year, equivalent to 1.3-1.7 
times current vehicle costs. For a methanol vehicle, it is 
&yen;1.23-1.89 million/year, equivalent to 1.4-2.1 times current 
vehicle costs. For a CNG vehicle, it is &yen;1.12-1.73 
million/year, equivalent to 1.3-2.0 times current vehicle costs. 
  Given the road transport carrier operating structure 
outlined 
in Chapter 2, it is difficult to view these as cost levels 
supporting autonomous popularization. Therefore, in order to 
lower these operating cost levels, various types of support 
policies will be devised, and we have assumed a variety of 
options, presented below, as the principal thinking on handling 
policies. 
  (1) Lowering financing costs in order to reduce the cost of 
procuring the new vehicles. As operating premises of this study 
committee, the use of fiscal-investment-and-loan-type special 
interest loans, and a financing ratio of 50% are assumed. 
Also, 
regardless of the source of funding, implementation of some sort 
of grant for paying at a fixed rate of interest is assumed. 
Specifically, reference is made to the system of interest 
subsidies relating to purchase funding for vehicles conforming 
to the latest regulations with transport industry promotional 
subsidies. 
  (2) Lowering initial introductory costs in view of the low 
financing capacity of medium and small-sized firms. As an 
operating premise of this study committee, we assumed the use of 
leases in combination with fiscal investment and loans. 
  (3) Incorporation of credit supplementing measures since 
medium and small-sized firms are short on credit resources. As 
operating premises of this study committee, in the event these 
are used in combination with a lease system, the introduction of 
a system in which business cooperative associations stand surety 
for money loaned and the lowering of lease rates are assumed. 
  (4) Endeavoring to lower the per-year cost burden by 
devising 
incentives in connection with corporate taxes, etc. As an 
operating premise of this study committee, allowing a tax 
deduction equivalent to 7% of the basic lease fee (total 
amount 
of the lease fees x 60%) for companies using a lease 
system, 
similar to ``MITI's Medium and Small-Sized Enterprise New 
Technology Promotion Tax System (known as the Mechatronics Tax 
System),'' is assumed. 
  (5) Allowance to use incentives in connection with all other 
vehicle taxes. As an operating premise of this study committee, 
reduction of the vehicle acquisition tax, and vehicle tax is 
assumed. 
  2) Note: Electric vehicles, as mentioned when we presented 
their technical features, are particularly superior in terms of 
their lack of exhaust and quietness, and they are generally 
recognized as the ultimate expression of the non-polluting 
automotive vehicle of the future. Development efforts to date 
have focused on vehicles in the ``light automobile'' class 
because of the relationship to the issue of the capacity of 
current storage batteries. For this reason, in the 2-ton 
commercial vehicle class which is considered necessary for the 
actual introduction of low-pollution vehicles by the road 
transport carriers, development is still in the stage where 
demonstration vehicles have begun to be provided for trial 
operation. 
  For the electric vehicle itself, as stated earlier, 
extensive 
technical component development still remains to be done on 
storage batteries and in other areas. Also, technology 
development aimed at making the important peripheral electric 
vehicle equipment, the recharging facilities, more inexpensive 
is needed. 
  Thus, a lot of hope is riding on the potential for future 
component technology development for the 2-ton class electric 
vehicles, and given the cost estimates, including operating 
costs, based on the price for the trial manufactured 2-ton 
vehicles, the majority of the committee feel it is still too 
early, and so we will forego specific estimates on these at this 
juncture. 
  3) Also, estimating the ``costs'' of petroleum-substitute 
energies proved extremely difficult; although it is relatively 
simple to get a handle on the comparative costs for electricity 
and CNG (the price for LNG, the feedstock material, is set by 
long-term contracts), there are many elements of uncertainty, 
not to mention methanol, which as was pointed out in the report 
of the ``Study Committee for Energy Supply Systems for 
Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles'' cited earlier, ``is one 
of the feedstock materials for MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl 
ether) in which there is heightened interest as a gasoline 
component, and research study on future supply and demand trends 
is needed.'' 
  Consequently, as an operating premise of this study 
committee, for fuels in which the related enterprises have some 
degree of responsibility for supply prices, we made reference to 
the price estimates of those enterprises, and for those fuels 
for which no such circumstances exist, we estimated supply 
prices on the premise that the fuel costs per kilometer of 
travel would not be cheaper than those for petroleum-derivative 
fuels. 
<H5>  1. Hybrid Vehicle Cost Estimates </H5>
  Cost category content for the introduction and operation of 
hybrid vehicles is as shown below. It is assumed that by 
employing energy regeneration, hybrid vehicles will have better 
fuel consumption rates than existing vehicles, and that some of 
the introductory costs will be recovered with lower operating 
costs. Note: For maintenance costs, we used the estimates of the 
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Also, given the 
technical features of the hybrid vehicle, there is no need for 
the provision of new infrastructure, and since instruction and 
training can be handled in a very few days, the decision was 
made to disregard those costs in these estimates. 
  These estimates are premised on a 4-ton truck and a 
large-model route bus as the test hybrid vehicles. With respect 
to the former, the establishment of a 2-ton class, compact 
vehicle was studied out of consideration for the realities of 
truck usage in urban areas, but in taking into account the 
technical features of the hybrid vehicle and the current stage 
of technical development, etc., the committee decided to premise 
the estimates on the highly feasible 4-ton vehicle. For the bus, 
we targeted the large-model route bus which already has a track 
record as a test vehicle and for which there are a great many 
units in use. Note: Taking into account economies of scale 
depending on the scale of manufacturing, we established a 2-tier 
price structure for the vehicle prices. Also, we adopted a 
10-year and 13-year service life for the trucks and buses 
respectively based on data of the Vehicle Inspection and 
Registration Association. Travel distances were set at 35,000 
km/year for trucks and 60,000 km/year for buses on the basis of 
the results of the questionnaire which was sent to the Tokyo 
Trucking Association and existing statistical data. Using 
existing experimental data, etc. as a reference, the rate of 
energy regeneration was calculated at 20%.

<H5>  Hybrid Vehicle Estimate Findings </H5>
  In estimating the hybrid vehicle introduction and operating 
costs in accordance with the premises cited earlier, as is shown 
in the summary chart that follows, we found that compared with 
existing vehicles, the average annual costs and the total costs 
for trucks and buses are fairly high. 
  First of all, if we look at the figures for trucks, in 
contrast to an average annual cost of &yen;1.14 million for 
existing trucks, for a simple purchase case, without policy-type 
assistance measures, the cost at an annual production level of 
100 units is &yen;1.99 million, just under twice that of current 
vehicle cost. If annual production is expanded to 5,000 units, 
the average annual introduction and operating cost falls to 
&yen;1.51 million, around 1.3 times that of existing vehicles. 
However, as it stands, it is hard to believe that hybrid 
vehicles are going to be popularized with road transport 
carriers. 
  Accordingly, when automobile and corporate tax reduction 
measures are taken as steps to promote popularization, average 
annual cost drops to &yen;1.44 million with an annual production 
level of 5,000 units, and if a lease system which incorporates 
fiscal-investment-and-loan financing is added, that cost falls 
to &yen;1.32 million. Furthermore, if a fixed-rate-interest 
subsidy is added on, the average annual cost is lowered to 
&yen;1.27 million, 1.11 times the current average annual vehicle 
cost. Thus, with complete commitment of the main assistance 
measures assumed initially, it is possible to shrink the 
disparity in cost with existing vehicles to around &yen;130,000 
per year. 
  The same holds true for hybrid buses as well, required costs 
swell in comparison to existing vehicles. Compared with trucks, 
the vehicle price disparity between existing buses and 
low-pollution buses is relatively small, and so the disparity in 
cost with existing vehicles ends up being the limiting factor. 
If it is assumed that all support measures are possible, and if 
annual production expands to 1,000 units, that cost disparity 
will shrink completely to a mere &yen;70,000 in average annual 
cost, and so substitution for current vehicles can be 
anticipated within existing frameworks for new vehicle 
replacements.

<H5>  2. Methanol Vehicle Cost Estimates </H5>
  Introductory and operating cost categories for methanol 
vehicles are shown below. 
  For maintenance cost estimates, we used the estimates of the 
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. To calculate fuel 
costs, we established fuel consumption and fuel price, and 
multiplied those with the annual mileage. Methanol vehicles make 
the provision of new refueling facility infrastructure 
necessary. As stated earlier, accurate estimates of fuel prices 
are difficult, and so we made our estimates on the premise that 
``fuel costs per kilometer of travel will not be less than that 
for other petroleum-derived fuels.'' Also M100 was assumed as 
the fuel standard. 
  Estimates are premised on a 2-ton truck and large-model 
route 
bus as the trial methanol vehicles. The large-model route bus 
was chosen because a test vehicle track record already exists 
and a large number of units are in service. Note: Taking into 
account economies of scale depending on the scale of production, 
we established a 3-tier vehicle price estimate structure for the 
trucks and a 2-tier vehicle price estimate structure for the 
buses. Also, we adopted a 10-year and 13-year service life for 
the trucks and buses respectively, based on data of the Vehicle 
Inspection and Registration Association. Travel distances were 
set at 35,000 km/year for trucks and 60,000 km/year for buses on 
the basis of the results of the questionnaire which was sent to 
the Tokyo Trucking Association and existing statistical data.

<H5>  Methanol Vehicle Estimate Findings </H5>
  In estimating the methanol vehicle introduction and 
operating 
costs in accordance with the premises cited earlier, as is shown 
in the summary chart that follows, we found that compared with 
existing vehicles, the average annual costs and the total costs 
for trucks and buses are fairly high. 
  First of all, if we look at the figures for trucks, in 
contrast to an average annual cost of &yen;880,000 for existing 
trucks, for a simple purchase case, without policy-type 
assistance measures, the cost at an annual production level of 
100 units is &yen;1.89 million, more than twice that of current 
vehicle cost. If annual production is expanded to 1,000 units, 
the average annual introduction and operating cost falls to 
&yen;1.55 million, around 1.8 times that of existing vehicles. 
If annual production is expanded to 10,000 units, the average 
annual cost for introduction and operation falls to &yen;1.23 
million, around 1.3 times that of existing vehicles. However, as 
it stands, it is hard to believe that methanol vehicles are 
going to be popularized with road transport carriers. 
  Accordingly, when automobile and corporate tax reduction 
measures are taken as steps to promote popularization, average 
annual cost falls to &yen;1.19 million on the basis of an annual 
production level of 10,000 units, and if a lease system which 
incorporates fiscal-investment-and-loan financing is added, the 
cost falls to &yen;1.13 million. Furthermore, if a 
fixed-rate-interest subsidy (3%) is added, the average 
annual 
cost is lowered to &yen;1.06 million, 1.2 times that of existing 
vehicles. Thus, with complete commitment of the main assistance 
measures assumed initially, it is possible to shrink the 
disparity in cost with existing vehicles to around &yen;180,000 
per year. 
  In looking at methanol buses, similar to the trucks, the 
required costs also swell in comparison to existing vehicles. 
Compared with trucks, the expendable item cost for existing 
buses and the low-pollution buses are relatively small, and so 
the cost disparity with existing vehicles will shrink. However, 
even with all policy support measures (fixed-rate-interest grant 
of 3%), and production expanded to 1,000 units, the 
lowest the 
average annual cost will fall is approximately 1.12 times that 
of existing vehicles, over &yen;440,000.

<H5>  3. CNG Vehicle Cost Estimates </H5>
  Cost categories for introducing and operating CNG vehicles 
are as shown below. 
  For maintenance cost estimates we used the estimates of the 
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. To calculate fuel 
costs, we established fuel consumption and fuel price, and 
multiplied those with the annual mileage. 
  CNG vehicles make the provision of new refueling facility 
infrastructure necessary. As stated earlier, accurate estimates 
of fuel prices are difficult, and so we used a price formulated 
using the prices estimated by the Japan Gas Association as 
reference. 
  Estimates are premised on a 2-ton truck and a large-model 
route bus as the trial CNG vehicles. The large-model route bus 
was chosen because a large number of units are in use. Note: 
Taking into account economies of scale depending on the scale of 
production, we established a 3-tier price estimate structure for 
the trucks and a 2-tier price estimate structure for the buses. 
Also, we adopted a 10-year and 13-year service life for the 
trucks and buses respectively, based on data of the Vehicle 
Inspection and Registration Association. Travel distances were 
set at 35,000 km/year for trucks and 60,000 km/year for buses on 
the basis of the results of the questionnaire which was sent to 
the Japan Trucking Association and existing statistical data.

<H5>  CNG Vehicle Estimate Findings </H5>
  In estimating the CNG vehicle introduction and operating 
costs in accordance with the premises cited earlier, as is shown 
in the summary chart that follows, we found that compared with 
existing vehicles, the average annual cost and the total costs 
for trucks and buses are fairly high. 
  First of all, if we look at the figures for trucks, in 
contrast to an average annual cost of &yen;880,000 for existing 
trucks, for a simple purchase case, without policy-type 
assistance measures, the cost at an annual production level of 
100 units is &yen;1.73 million, a little less than twice that of 
current vehicle cost. If annual production is expanded to 1,000 
units, the average annual introduction and operating cost falls 
to &yen;1.31 million, around 1.5 times that of existing 
vehicles. If annual production is expanded to 10,000 units, the 
average annual cost for introduction and operation falls to 
&yen;1.12 million, around 1.3 times that of existing vehicles. 
However, as it stands, it is hard to believe that CNG vehicles 
are going to be popularized with road transport carriers. 
  Accordingly, when automobile and corporate tax reduction 
measures are taken as steps to promote popularization, average 
annual cost falls to &yen;1.08 million on the basis of an annual 
production level of 10,000 units, and if a lease system which 
incorporates fiscal-investment-and-loan financing is added, the 
cost falls to &yen;1.02 million. Furthermore, if a 
fixed-rate-interest subsidy (3%) is added, the average 
annual 
cost is lowered to &yen;960,000, 1.09 times that of existing 
vehicles. Thus, with complete commitment of the main assistance 
measures assumed initially, it is possible to shrink the 
disparity in cost with existing vehicles to around &yen;80,000 
per year. 
  In looking at CNG buses the same holds true, the required 
costs also swell in comparison to existing vehicles. Compared 
with trucks, the expendable item cost for existing buses and the 
low-pollution buses are relatively small, and so this will 
shrink the cost disparity with existing vehicles. However, even 
with all policy support measures (fixed-rate-interest subsidy of 
3%), and production expanded to 1,000 units, CNG buses 
will be 
cheaper than existing buses, and it is to be anticipated that 
they will replace existing vehicles within the new vehicle 
replacement frameworks already in place.

  1) As seen above, according to cost estimates (full policy 
implementation basis) conducted under a prescribed set of 
conditions from the standpoint of making a comparison with 
existing diesel vehicles, annual costs are expected to rise 
respectively by &yen;130,000 for a hybrid vehicle (4-ton 
carrying capacity), &yen;180,000 for a methanol vehicle (2-ton 
carrying capacity), and &yen;80,000 for a CNG vehicles (2-ton 
carrying capacity). 
  Similarly, for buses, annual costs are expected to rise by 
&yen;70,000 for hybrid vehicles, and by &yen;440,000 for 
methanol vehicles, but conversely, for CNG vehicles a cost 
reduction on the order of &yen;30,000 is anticipated. 
  2) In order to endeavor to popularize these low-pollution 
vehicles even further, the key will be whether or not it is 
possible to find factors which will allow us to shrink these 
cost disparities. 
  First of all are the prices of the hybrid/methanol/CNG 
vehicles assumed within these estimates. Particularly, given the 
far shorter history of technology development on vehicles which 
use petroleum-substitute fuels than that for diesel vehicles, 
when compared to these engines which are ``more tempered'' by 
the demands of the market, it is no exaggeration to say that 
engines which use petroleum-substitute fuels are still under 
development. It is possible that in the future, as a result of 
cooperation between users and manufacturers, far more usable 
engines than those currently available and, in turn, more easy 
than at present for road transport carriers to use, and vehicles 
priced lower than the current estimates will become available. 
  Second, financing cost reduction is possible. Current 
estimates for hybrid vehicles assume an annual fixed-rate 
interest subsidy of 1%, but, for example, in a case in 
which 
the introductory number of units is relatively low, it is 
probably possible to assume higher and more liberal 
fixed-rate-interest subsidies similar to those for methanol and 
CNG vehicles. 
  Also, Japan Development Bank special-interest-rate financing 
is assumed in the estimates for all three types of vehicles, but 
there is a high probability of further cost reductions in the 
area of funding procurement, e.g., the opportunity for the 
parties introducing these vehicles to take advantage of 
preferential interest rates available for medium and small-sized 
enterprises, and further, in the case of using imported 
vehicles, the opportunity to take advantage of the Import-Export 
Bank of Japan product import financing system (interest: 
5.3% 
at financing rate of 70% of item cost). 
  Third, there is the importance of further ingenuity in terms 
of the use of all three vehicles types by the road transport 
carriers actually using these low-pollution vehicles. In the 
case of hybrid vehicles in particular, it is conceivable that 
transport costs will decline due to improvements to the 
relatively conservative mileage estimates as these enterprises 
secure more adequate operational stability and implement more 
efficient operating plans. 
  Also, methanol and CNG vehicles have feature flexibility in 
terms of carrying capacity, mileage and chassis design by 
varying the energy density of their respective fuels and by 
changing their fuel-carrying methods. As a result, it is also 
possible that when we attempt to fully demonstrate the 
respective features, we will end up with more ingenious vehicles 
in terms of capacity, etc., than those premised in these 
estimates. 
  In addition, in the case of CNG vehicles, the 
``eco-stations'' which are likely to be developed will have the 
feature of being completely limited to the areas supplied by 
Tokyo Gas, Toho Gas and Osaka Gas for the immediate future. 
  It is likely that individual road transport carriers will 
devise ways to absorb cost increases by using the features 
illustrated earlier and making them conform sufficiently to 
performance demanded in response to the characteristics of their 
customers. 
  With the accumulation of such efforts and ingenuity by the 
parties concerned, effectively combined with tax incentives, 
fiscal investment and loans, and the like, we probably can 
expect to be able to promote the introduction of hybrid, 
methanol and CNG vehicles. 
  3) As mentioned earlier, no matter how difficult they have 
been to build, the history of low-pollution vehicles is still a 
brief one. Compared to vehicles with diesel engines which have a 
long tradition as commercial vehicle engines, one can 
justifiably argue that low-pollution vehicles which use 
petroleum-substitute fuels in particular are under development. 
As long as current circumstances prevail, users cannot choose to 
bear the burden of full-scale introduction on their own, nor can 
manufacturers decide to undertake adequate R&amp;D investment, or 
facility investment at their own risk. Just as they are for 
structuring issues on the energy supplier side mentioned in the 
report of the ``Energy Supply Systems for 
Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles Study Committee,'' the 
problems in introducing low-pollution vehicles are also 
inherently ``chicken or egg'' issues. 
  In order to come up with breakthroughs on these issues, road 
users, starting with the road transport carriers, should 
formulate ``long-term targets for the introduction of 
low-pollution vehicles'' individually and in step with the 
response of their associated industry, and then strive for 
steady introduction on the basis of those objectives. 
  In particular, if national and local-level government 
organizations make use of these vehicles as part of their 
operations, it goes without saying that they should set their 
own ``targets'' to serve as models for others, and then lead the 
private sector by steadily meeting these targets. 
  Also, the national government should approve the application 
of measures to support their introduction cited earlier only for 
those businesses which have clarified these ``targets,'' and 
should consider eligibility in such a way that they do not 
discourage road users, beginning with road transport carriers. 
Steps should be devised so that these ``targets'' do not act 
simply as triggers for eligibility for these support 
measures. 
  The following idea is an example of such a step. 
  Customarily, whether it is a low-pollution vehicle or a 
regular vehicle, when it comes to a choice between a vehicle 
that has been on the market for several years or one that is 
just hitting the market, the one that has been tried and tested 
by the market will be the superior vehicle in terms of 
performance and price, etc. Therefore, one idea is to lower the 
burden and risk for those enterprises attempting to introduce 
these vehicles ahead of other enterprises by, for example, 
approving the application of support measures for road transport 
carriers attempting to introduce ``low-pollution vehicles'' 
which have not been on the market long, even if their 
``targets'' call for a relatively low proportion of 
``low-pollution vehicles'' among the vehicles they possess, 
while requiring a fairly high rate of introduction of these 
vehicles to be eligible for support measures after a prescribed 
period of time has elapsed and vehicle assessments concluded, 
etc. 
  As for methods of using introduction targets, even aside 
from 
elements which must await government administrative review 
because of issues relating to utilization of tax incentives and 
fiscal investment and loans, clarifying these long-term 
introduction targets can be expected to have the reverberating 
effect of enabling automobile manufacturers to define demand 
estimates, making it possible to lower marketing-associated 
risks even further. 
<H5>  VII. In Conclusion </H5>
  (1) In our study through chapter 6, we have pointed out that 
the possibilities for improving the operating costs and speeding 
up the pace of popularization of low-pollution vehicles increase 
by devising a series of support policies like tax and fiscal 
investment and loan incentives as well as schemes to make use of 
them, etc. 
  In the event the introduction of low-pollution vehicles is 
facilitated as a result of regional features, etc., in addition 
to policies such as these, which ought to be characterized as 
uniform national minimums, it is preferable that the incentive 
measures be added on region by region. 
  Similarly, from the standpoint of alternate energy policy, 
although not policy in direct support of low-pollution vehicles, 
the formulation of any sort of support measures is welcome. As 
long as they are conducive to the popularization of 
``low-pollution vehicles,'' it is probably preferable to need to 
make active use of these policy measures from separate 
perspectives. 
  (2) As explained a number of times, road transport carriers 
have adopted the position that there need to be guarantees for 
the systems from which supplies of energy for 
petroleum-substitute-energy-type low-pollution vehicles are to 
be received. The position of the energy suppliers on the other 
hand, is likely to be that clear estimates of the amount of 
demand and guarantees to cover facility investment risks are 
needed. 
  In order to put a stop to this kind of endless debate, the 
``Energy Supply Systems for Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles 
Study Committee'' introduced earlier has stated that an 
``Eco-Station 2000'' program should be put together and the 
support, etc. it requires implemented. 
  The formulation of support policies such as these in itself 
would be welcomed as being truly opportune. If we were to take 
it upon ourselves to assume the position of a business actually 
operating vehicles and point to this program, the first priority 
naturally would go to the metropolitan areas, especially those 
which are subject to NOx laws and regulations, as investing 
parties in low-pollution vehicles which they themselves would 
use. Therefore, in attempting to invest in vehicles which use 
petroleum-substitute energies, it would be desirable that the 
stations supplying the petroleum-substitute energies, i.e., the 
``eco-stations,'' be concentrated in the metropolitan areas, and 
on the major artery roads closely linked with them. Also, there 
appears to be a great need on the part of the energy suppliers 
like the petroleum retailers, etc. to get a handle on vehicle 
upgrading trends of the road transport carriers. 
  Therefore, in order to formulate future targets for the 
corporate introduction of petroleum-substitute-energy-type 
low-pollution vehicles, it is necessary for those on the user 
side, beginning with the road transport carriers, and those on 
the energy supplier side, the petroleum retailers, et al., to 
come up with estimates for the supply and demand of 
petroleum-substitute fuels that range into the future. There is 
an especially great need to come up with estimates between the 
enterprises and the energy suppliers, the petroleum retailers, 
et. al., on the amount of supply required in the event the use 
of petroleum-substitute-fuel vehicles is attempted, even if only 
in those areas subject to NOx laws and regulations. The issues 
straddle the jurisdictions of several ministries and agencies, 
but a forum to study supply and demand ought to be established 
through the cooperation of the administrative parties. As stated 
earlier, it is of course conceivable that in the initial stages 
of use of low-pollution vehicles, a certain amount of problems 
with the convenience of use will surface. And, some types of 
product complaints need to be fed back steadily to the 
manufacturers. 
  This kind of steady feedback in itself has the ability to 
bring about progress toward a more ``user-friendly'' vehicle, 
and conversely, provide automobile manufacturers with know-how 
and new technical data relating to the use of low-pollution 
vehicles, and as a result, stimulate even wider demand for 
low-pollution vehicles. 
  It will probably be necessary to secure points of interface 
of this kind between users and manufacturers in some form. 
Normally, this role is played by the sales and service 
departments of automobile dealerships, but it seems that if 
several manufacturers build a specific type of ``low-pollution 
vehicle,'' as much sharing of their technical data as possible 
would lead to an effective use of precious manpower. 
  Also, low-pollution vehicles have many points of difference 
with existing automobiles, particularly in terms of upgrading 
and maintenance, etc., and will require mastery of unique 
technology, particularly in the initial stages of introduction. 
For this reason, in using the lease system which this study 
committee made a premise of its review, we should consider 
extending it to a maintenance lease, rather than limiting it to 
a financing lease, so that along with serving the convenience of 
the road transport carriers who will be the users of the 
low-pollution vehicles, it will be possible to use these leases 
as the point of interface between the manufacturers and the road 
transport carriers for upgrading and maintenance data and other 
data. 
  (4) Although tentative proposals have already been made 
regarding the handling of low-pollution vehicles in terms of 
taxes, it is probably going to be necessary to consider the 
optimum methods of implementing various automobile-related taxes 
and fuel taxes as long-term issues needing further study. 
  For example, there is the issue of the automobile weight 
tax. 
This problem is directly manifested in electric vehicles, and 
even if excessive weight increase from storage batteries or the 
weight increase from the accumulator and storage battery 
apparatus in hybrid vehicles, the so-called ``tonnage 
reduction'' issue, is cleared up through the application of 
design ingenuity, rises in vehicle weight tax are unavoidable, 
and so without some sort of consideration, it is inevitable that 
this tax will be a source of cost increase for users of these 
vehicles. 
  Also, within this report, we have addressed the issue of 
terminal sales price in connection with petroleum-substitute 
fuels, and we have kept issues pertaining to intermediate-stage 
taxation completely outside the purview of our study. Hereafter, 
having taken into consideration how they would conform with the 
series of policies aimed at bringing about low-pollution 
automobile traffic, and with promoting the introduction of 
petroleum-substitute energies, it likely will be necessary to 
study the best way to handle the imposition of taxes. 
  (5) Furthermore, in order to confer social approval on the 
use of low-pollution vehicles, active consideration ought to be 
given by the appropriate parties to establishing conditions for 
their use such as devising measures like affording priority to 
low-pollution vehicles in public parking facilities, or setting 
preferential toll road usage fees for low-pollution vehicles, or 
providing standardization and certification systems, etc. 
  In addition to that, active responses will be needed through 
the mutual cooperation of the industries concerned and 
cooperation with local governing bodies, etc. in connection with 
the extensive activities required to enable the smooth future 
popularization of low-pollution vehicles, e.g., the work of 
enlightening those concerned who benefit from the uses of road 
traffic, general consumers, shippers, etc., on the significance 
of using low-pollution vehicles, and improving the ability of 
the automobile-related industries to understand technology 
development trends, etc., which is needed to form a consensus 
that the ``cost increases'' which cannot be further eliminated 
should be borne by society as a whole by formulating tax and 
fiscal investment and loan incentives. 
  (6) As indicated above, there is a considerable amount of 
work requiring close, mutual cooperation between automobile 
manufacturers and road users, and between road users and fuel 
suppliers. These various tasks require in particular the 
establishment of some type of fora for consultations on the 
formulation of low-pollution vehicle introduction targets by 
individual enterprises, for consultations with the petroleum 
retailers, and for consultation with the automobile 
manufacturers. Naturally, it is conceivable that a variety of 
methods could be used to establish these kinds of fora. 
  For now, the establishment of a ``Low-Pollution Vehicle 
Popularization Forum'' (tentative name) with government 
cooperation as a forum to allow the relatively ``soft'' 
undertaking of collective, timely exchanges of manufacturer, 
user, and petroleum retailer information, and above all, direct 
contact and discussion of low-pollution vehicle issues by these 
three parties are likely to be an effective ``first step.'' 
  Item (6) stated above is a proposal designed to supplement 
support policies for the popularization of low-pollution 
vehicles. In addition to ancillary measures like this, even more 
difficult issues remain to be dealt with as far as things that 
should be done to protect the environment in terms of road 
traffic are concerned, e.g., on top of upgrading the road 
network, making the flow of traffic smoother, and the 
distribution of goods more efficient. We would again point out 
the need for greater effort by the parties concerned. 
<H5>  (Reference Data) </H5>
  Given the fact that it seems the price in the initial stage 
of low-pollution vehicle introduction have to be high compared 
to their price in the stage of full-scale popularization, and 
that there are aspects of insecurity relating to marketability 
for the manufacturers, we need to lower the risks for users for 
the initial stage in which specific low-pollution vehicles are 
thrust into the market. Furthermore, more than 80% of 
trucking 
firms are medium-to-small-sized enterprises, and in light of 
their funds availability and credit circumstances, the 
introduction of relatively expensive low-pollution vehicles is 
going to require policy incentives. 
  In terms of specific support measures for enterprises and 
individuals shifting purchases to low-pollution vehicles: (1) 
tax incentives such as reducing vehicle tax and vehicle 
acquisition tax, and corporate and individual income tax 
deductions, etc.; (2) the use of fiscal investment and loans; 
and (3) the use of a lease system, etc. are being considered. In 
addition, (4) a fixed-rate-interest subsidy from the Japan 
Trucking Association; support measures from local governing 
bodies; and (6) other indirect support measures are conceivable 
as well. 
<H5>  (1) Tax Incentives </H5>
<H5>  Automobile Tax (Local Tax) </H5>
  - Extending (the period applicable) the measure to reduce 
the 
rate of the automobile tax for electric vehicles (applying the 
rate prior to the FY1984 tax revision) to FY1993 and FY1994 
  - Extending (the period applicable) the measure to reduce 
the 
rate of the automobile tax for methanol vehicles (applying the 
rate prior to the FY1984 tax revision) to FY1993 and FY1994 
  -Establishing a measure to reduce the rate of the automobile 
tax for hybrid vehicles (applying the rate prior to the FY1984 
tax revision) for FY1993 and FY1994 (period applicable) 
  - Reducing the vehicle tax by to half for 12 months 
following 
a purchase when a diesel vehicle (truck or bus) manufactured 
prior to conformance with the 1979 exhaust gas regulations is 
scrapped and replaced with a new vehicle conforming to the 
latest regulations for FY1990 and FY1991 (period applicable) 
<H5>  Vehicle Acquisition Tax (Local Tax) </H5>
  - Presently 5% of acquisition price for private 
vehicles and 
3% for business vehicles 
  - Extending (the period applicable) the 2% reduction 
in the 
acquisition tax applied to methanol vehicles to FY1993 and FY1994 
  - Establishing a new measure to reduce the acquisition tax 
2% for hybrid vehicles for FY1993 and FY1994 (the period 
applicable) 
  - Providing 1% reduction when a diesel vehicle 
(truck or 
bus) manufactured prior to conformance with the 1979 exhaust gas 
regulations is scrapped and replaced with a new vehicle 
conforming to the latest regulations for FY1990 and FY1991. 
<H5>  Corporate Tax (National Tax) </H5>
  - Will implement tax incentives against the nominal price of 
a vehicle in line with those in MITI's system of tax measures to 
promote new technology investment by medium and small 
enterprises (known as the Mechatronic Tax System) and its system 
of tax measures to promote investment to deal with changes in 
energy and the environment (known as the Energy and Environment 
Tax System) 
  (For reference) MITI System of Tax Measures To Promote New 
Technology System Investment by Medium and Small Enterprises 
(popularly referred to as the Mechatronic Tax System) 
  - Authorizes a special depreciation for medium and small 
enterprise purchases of the latest mechatronic equipment, 
30% 
over the ordinary depreciation for that business year 
(36% for 
imported equipment), or a corporate tax credit (on purchases 
above &yen;1.6 million per unit, up to 20% of the amount 
of 
corporate tax) of 7% of the revenue tax (8.4% for 
imported 
equipment) 
  - For leases as well, in addition to allowing lease fees to 
be treated as deductible, as a method of reducing taxes, it is 
possible under the Mechatronic Tax System to take a tax 
deduction of 7% of the basic lease charge (total lease 
fees x 
60%). 
  (For reference) Tax System To Promote Investment To Handle 
Changes in Energy and the Environment (popularly referred to as 
the Energy and Environment Tax System) 
  - Authorizes a special depreciation of 30% for that 
business 
year on purchases of equipment to counter energy and 
environmental changes (of more than &yen;1.6 million for things 
like vehicle internal combustion engines which conform to the 
FY1990 automobile exhaust gas regulations, etc.), or a corporate 
tax credit of 7% of the acquisition amount (up to 
20% of the 
corporate tax amount for that fiscal year) 
  - Authorizes under depreciated amounts to be carried forward 
for 1 year 
<H5>  (2) Use of Fiscal Investment and Loans </H5>
  - Enable the use of low interest loans from the Japan 
Development Bank and the Small Business Finance Corporation to 
obtain vehicles (interest rate long-term prime rate minus 
0.5-0.8%) 
<H5>  (3) Use of Lease System </H5>
  If a lease system is used, the leasing company assumes the 
burden for the funding to purchase the low-pollution vehicle and 
the user gets by with just paying a monthly lease fee. A further 
advantage to leasing is that the full amount of the cost of the 
item can be treated as deductible within the period of the 
lease. Consequently, if the lease period is shorter than the 
legal service life (within the limits of Ministry of Finance 
notification), it has the effect of saving taxes. Also, since 
cost is centralized in the monthly lease fee, it is simple to 
get a handle on the current value.

  (For Reference) Institutional Leasing 
  An equipment procurement measure referred to as leasing is a 
system devised by MITI in its attempts to rationalize and 
modernize medium and small enterprises based on the 
determination that it is very effective in terms of promoting 
popularization and expanding use of specific equipment and 
functions. The ``National Standard of Living Equipment Lease'' 
which covered ``voluntary-chain'' equipment and ``cold-chain'' 
equipment, etc., with financial debenture underwriting measures 
in 1970 was the start of institutional leasing. Institutional 
leasing subsequently developed into ``Leasing To Promote 
Popularization of New Machinery and Equipment, etc.'' Relatively 
low-interest financing for facilities and equipment for which 
the promotion of popularization is desirable in terms of the 
national economy is made available to lease companies using 
capital derived from financial debenture underwriting measures 
as the source of funding. As a result, lease users end up being 
able to make use of designated equipment for a relatively 
inexpensive lease fee. These institutional leases have continued 
from 1972 up to the present as leases covered by financing from 
the Japan Development Bank, a government-affiliated finance 
institution. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-55B>           Institutional Lease Arrangement Financed by Japan </FIG>

<H3>  Japan Development Bank Lease Financing System Coverage

  Items covered by institutional leasing: ``social welfare 
equipment''; ``point of sales (POS) systems''; ``automatic gas 
cut-off devices for liquid propane (LP) gas''; ``social welfare 
equipment for the home''; and ``satellite broadcasting and 
receiving systems.'' Financing for 35-40% of the cost of 
an 
item is received from the Japan Development Bank. 
  Japan Development Bank Financing is received in various 
other 
categories: 

  -  1. Aircraft 
  -  2. Aircraft Facilities and Equipment 
  -  3. Data Processing, Communications Enhancement 
  -  4. Import System Upgrade (equipment required to facilitate 
imports)

  (For Reference) Lease Subsidy System 
  Begun by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
in 1979 in order to increase consumption of domestic 
agricultural and marine products, in this system part of the 
lease fee is subsidized by the Food Industry Center, Inc. in 
cases where food manufacturers introduce new machinery on a 
lease basis. In other words, a ``lease subsidy system'' was 
begun. Once a subsidy is determined the Food Industry Center 
pays the leasing company a subsidy twice a year. Based on these 
subsidy payments, the user deducts an equivalent amount from his 
payments and then pays the leasing company. When the interest 
equivalent on the cost of the item in the lease fee is 
calculated in terms of annual interest, it is lowered 
approximately 2% with the subsidy. 
  In FY1987, the Forestry Agency initiated a subsidy system. 
This was done in an attempt to facilitate the introduction, 
through leasing, of equipment to increase artificial drying of 
lumber, mainly domestic lumber and wood products, to improve the 
distribution of lumber. In this system the Japan Lumber 
Stockpile Organization subsidizes a portion of the lease fee 
when lumber drying equipment is introduced by leasing. Similar 
to the Food Industry Center mentioned earlier, a subsidy is paid 
to the leasing company and the user bears responsibility for the 
remainder of the fee. In FY1990, coverage was expanded to apply 
as well to computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided 
manufacturing (CAM) equipment among the equipment to improve 
lumber distribution. 
  In 1990 MITI's ANRE initiated a subsidy system. Under this 
system a subsidy for part of the lease fee is received from the 
Federation of Gasoline Retailers and Petroleum Associations in 
cases where equipment relating to restructuring is introduced 
through leasing. Unlike the two systems cited earlier, the 
subsidy is paid to the user. Diagrams of the various subsidy 
arrangements are given below: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003C-57A>           Food Industry Subsidy </FIG>





<H5>  Lease Credit Insurance System </H5>
  This is a national insurance system established in 1973 as a 
system to supplement the credit access of medium and small 
enterprises in order for them to use leasing on advantageous 
terms. In substance, the item insured is stipulated and the 
leasing company concludes an insurance contract with the 
government covering the lease contract, and in the event of 
default such as non-payment of the lease fees, etc., the 
government provides compensation of approximately 50% of 
the 
amount of default. The contracting party in the current lease 
credit insurance system is the Small Enterprise Credit Insurance 
Corporation which took over on behalf of the government in 
October of 1984 from the Machinery Insurance Division of MITI's 
Machinery and Information Industries Bureau. 
  This system not only supplements the credit access for 
medium 
and small enterprises, the insurance money is paid promptly upon 
contract of the insurance, is virtually as efficient as a 
no-interest loan, and it also has the advantage of low insurance 
rates, etc. 
<H5>  Leasing of Aircraft for Overseas Markets </H5>
  As part of the measures to deal with Japan's favorable 
balance of international payments in 1978 (the so-called surplus 
reduction) under the leadership of MITI, the leasing companies 
implemented emergency imports of aircraft and then leased them 
to foreign airline companies. Under this arrangement the leasing 
companies purchase aircraft and plants, etc. from abroad using 
the emergency import foreign currency loan system of the 
Import-Export Bank of Japan, and then provide them under lease 
to various countries. It had the effect of succeeding in 
reducing the surplus amidst growing criticism from a number of 
countries, and of contributing to economic cooperation as well. 
<H5>  (4) Fixed-Rate-Interest Subsidies </H5>
  The Japan Trucking Association, a trucking industry group, 
also has implemented a fixed-rate-interest subsidy for 
replacement purchases of vehicles which conform to the latest 
regulations, and low-pollution vehicles will be covered by these 
subsidies as well. 
<H5>  (5) Local Government Body Support Measures </H5>
  Local government bodies will provide support to private 
enterprises purchasing low-pollution vehicles.

National Aerospace Laboratory and Daiko Limited, respectively] 
  [Text] Abstract: The "rarefied gas numerical 
wind tunnel (RGNWT)" constructed with the universal code 
described using the null-collision direct-simulation Monte Carlo 
method is used for the simulation of rarefied gas flows around 
the orbital re-entry experiment vehicle (OREX). Some aerodynamic 
characteristics and flowfield properties are presented. 
<H5>  1. Rarefied Gas Numerical Wind Tunnel </H5>
  Work is moving ahead on the development and implementation 
of 
the rarefied gas numerical wind tunnel (RGNWT) which is designed 
for determining aerodynamic characteristics when a high-level 
airfoil such as the space plane flies through rarefied gas. 
High-precision, high-efficiency simulation techniques are a must 
for three-dimensional full-airfoil simulations in rarefied gas. 
For this purpose, the null-collision (NC) direct-simulation 
Monte Carlo (DS-MC) method[.sup]1[/] is used where the mean 
molecular lower limit per collision cell is no more than 
approximately 1 and the computation time is short. 
General-purpose use is made of a high-efficiency (uniform) 
rectangular parallelepiped for the computation area, collision 
cell shape, and data cell shape. The boundary conditions at the 
boundary of the computation area are that the uniform flow at 
the object upper flow and vertical and lateral boundaries are 
disregarded, and the changes in the direction of flow at the 
object lower boundary are disregarded in making approximations. 
The object surface cells that are for determining the 
aerodynamic characteristics of the object are divided into 
shapes that are suited to the object shape independently of the 
collision cell shapes. As to the gas molecule reflection 
conditions at the object surface, a mixed form is assumed which 
is a mixture of mirror-surface reflection and diffuse reflection. 
  The gas molecule model used is the variable soft sphere 
(VSS) 
model which was recently proposed as a high-precision, 
high-efficiency molecular model.[.sup]2[/] We are also now 
developing a molecular model for conducting high-precision, 
high-efficiency simulations of actual gas effects such as 
molecular spin, vibration, dissociation, electronic excitation, 
ionization, and radiation. 
<H5>  2. OREX </H5>
  We used the rarefied gas numerical wind tunnel to conduct 
three-dimensional rare flow simulations around the orbital 
re-entry experiment vehicle (OREX). The collision (data) cells 
and the object surface cells are diagrammed in Figure 1. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-01A>           Figure 1. Collision (Data) Cell and Object Surface </FIG>


   Because the inter-molecular potential at high energy is 
indeterminate,[.sup]3[/] we used values for the parameters in 
the VSS molecular model which correspond to those of rigid 
sphere models. We also assumed a uniform flow temperature 
dispersion wall for the object surface. The figures which follow 
depict the results with angle of incidence _a_ = 0 for 
cases where flight is at a uniform flow Mach number 
M[.sup][/] = 27 (speed ratio 
S[.sup][/] = 25) in a rarefied flow with a 
uniform flow Knudsen number Kn[.sup][/] = 10, 
1, 0.1, and 0.01, with the OREX diameter as the standard 
criterion. 
  The object axis (rotational) symmetrical surface infra 
density and temperature distributions are depicted in Figures 2 
through 5 for Kn[.sup][/] = 10, 1, 0.1, and 
0.01. Along with the reduction (high-level reduction) of the 
Knudsen number, the disturbance area in front of the object is 
also reduced. The density reaches several tens of times the 
uniform flow value in the vicinity of the forward stagnation 
point, while the temperature exceeds a hundred times the uniform 
flow value in front of the forward stagnation point. There is 
also a high temperature region in the back flow of the object 
which is several tens of times the uniform flow temperature.

  In Figure 6 are plotted the changes based on the Knudsen 
number Kn[.sup][/] of the drag coefficient 
C[.sup]D[/]. The drag coefficient declines along 
with the decline in Kn[.sup][/]. The degree of 
convergence in the computational results for the decrease in the 
collision cell size is indicated on the diagram also, but the 
convergence is inadequate at Kn[.sup][/] &lt; 
0.1, and we see that it has become a largish value.

  [Text] Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that 
the Numerical Wind Tunnel (NWT) with an actual performance of 
more than 100 times higher than Fujitsu-VP400 is feasible using 
a multi-computer architecture and crossbar interconnection 
network. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Let me tell you what I did at last year's 3d aircraft 
computational aerodynamic symposium. I proposed: 
  (R1) That it is necessary to quickly develop a high-speed 
computer which will exhibit at least 100 times the CFD program 
processing speed of the Fujitsu-VP400 (hereinafter called simply 
the VP400), with a main memory area of 32 GB or so for data 
storage, and to use this in the NAL computer system. 
  This would be for the purpose of exploiting the merits of 
numerical simulation technology, for the purpose of employing 
the CFD gains made thus far in the aircraft aerodynamic 
development which is beginning to be done in Japan, and to push 
CFD to even higher levels. I also showed that it is possible to 
quickly implement this computer by adopting parallel computation 
techniques.[.sup]1[/] 
  In this paper I press last year's argument even further and 
report on: 
  (1) the considerations that form our starting point for 
studying the idea of a numerical wind tunnel, 
  (2) the conditions necessary to produce a practical computer 
exhibiting the performance noted in (R1), 
  (3) the hardware configuration for a computer exhibiting the 
performance noted in (R1), and 
  (4) a summary of the functions required in program writing 
and the compiler. 
  Furthermore, with the purposes for developing a computer 
that 
will satisfy the performance demands noted in (R1) firmly in 
mind, in the remainder of this paper I consider that computer to 
be a numerical wind tunnel (abbreviated NWT). 
<H5>  2. NWT Concept Starting Point </H5>
  In this section I will briefly discuss some aspects of the 
starting point for the NWT concept. The details are discussed in 
the References.[.sup]2[/] 
<H5>  2.1 NWT Approach </H5>

  (1) NWT Will Be Distributed Main Memory Type Parallel 
Computer 
  In terms of how the main memory is structured, we may divide 
parallel computers into those which employ common main memory 
and those which employ distributed main memory (cf. Figure 1). 
We decided to make the NWT a distributed main memory parallel 
computer for three reasons, namely (1) the fact that there are 
few limitations on improving raw computer processing speeds, (2) 
the fact that there are great possibilities for improving 
performance in the future by incorporating advances in element 
technology, and (3) the fact that the big problem with 
distributed main memory type parallel computers -- i.e. the 
problem of addressing main memory -- can be to some extent 
resolved, we now think, by incorporating virtual common main 
memory space.[.sup]3[/] 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-05A>           Figure 1. Distributed Main Memory Parallel </FIG>


   (2) Element Computer (abbreviated PE) Will Be Vector 
Computer 
Equipped With Vector Registers (abbreviated VR) 
  We have learned from our experience to date with vector 
computers that VR-equipped computers having chaining functions 
are suitable for CFD programming. The Fortran compiler 
technology for this mode of computation has reached a high 
level, moreover, and so long as the hardware has the standard 
hardware functions for vector processing, the vectoring ratio 
for CFD programs is 99% or thereabouts. That is why we 
decided 
that the PE would be a VR-equipped vector computer. 
<H5>  2.2 Preconditions for CFD Programs </H5>
  Paralleling and Vectoring Ratios Reaches 99% and 
Higher in 
CFD Programs. 
  Most of NAL's CFD programs now attain a vectoring ratio of 
99% or higher. If the degree of paralleling is determined 
in 
line with the scale of the problem, the paralleling ratio of CFD 
programs also reaches 99% and above. Both of these ratios 
rise 
as the scale of the problem increases relative to the degree of 
paralleling. 
<H5>  2.3 Usable Hardware Elements </H5>
  (1) Theoretical Elements 
  Recent trends in theoretical element (device) speeds are 
plotted in Figure 2. The gate switching delay time is plotted on 
the vertical axis and the year on the horizontal axis. In Figure 
3 are plotted the trends in theoretical element densities, with 
gate density per chip plotted on the vertical axis and the year 
on the horizontal axis. Based on these two figures, and on 
recent theoretical element per-chip power consumption trends, we 
expect that the following three devices can all be used as NWT 
devices. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-06A>           Figure 2. Theoretical Element Speed Trends </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-06B>           Figure 3. Theoretical Element Density Trends </FIG>



  (i) 30,000 gates/chip: Switching delay time 50 ps 
(10[.sup]-12[/] seconds); Power consumption 40 W/chip ECL 
gate array 
  (ii) 100,000 gates/chip: Switching delay time 350 ps 
(10[.sup]-12[/] seconds); Power consumption 20 W/chip BiCMOS 
gate array 
  (iii) 200,000 gates/chip: Switching delay time 600 ps 
(10[.sup]-12[/] seconds); Power consumption 10 W/chip CMOS 
gate array 
  (2) Main Memory Elements 
  As to the main memory element, the 4 M/chip SRAM is 
beginning 
to be mass-produced. Accordingly, it is possible to use either a 
4 M/chip or 1 M/chip SRAM as the main memory element and 
implement a main memory of 30 to 40 GB.[.sup]1[/] Which chip 
to go with will depend on cost and speed considerations. 
<H5>  3. Conditions Needed for Implementing Numerical Wind Tunnel </H5>
  In the introduction we noted that the performance goals for 
the numerical wind tunnel have been established, but the answers 
forthcoming from computer engineering do not give a clear 
picture of how this can be implemented. There are many technical 
decisions which have to be made. 
  We discuss briefly here some conditions that will provide 
judgment criteria when making technical decisions. 
<H5>  3.1 NWT Cost </H5>
  When we look at the numerical wind tunnel from the 
perspective of R&amp;D on aerodynamic technology for aircraft, 
the 
numerical wind tunnel is a piece of aerodynamic testing 
equipment that complements the conventional wind tunnel. If the 
cost is too high, therefore, the NWT cannot be used in 
parametric studies and the like for the purpose of doing 
aerodynamic design of aircraft utilizing the advantages of 
computers. 
  Accordingly, if we are to implement the NWT, then we must 
look beyond performance alone, and do our best to lower 
development and production costs and operating costs. When 
considering such costs, naturally we must think about the cost 
per data set of each wind tunnel test. In this day and age we 
must consider the cost of data as well as the reliability of 
data for numerical simulations based on the RANS equations. 
  This means that it will be very difficult to implement the 
NWT by linking up dozens of supercomputers. 
<H5>  3.2 Reliability </H5>
  The improvements in recent years in both element technology 
and mounting technology have had an enormous impact in enhancing 
the reliability of computers. It is nevertheless a well known 
fact that devices adopted for improved reliability often have a 
negative impact on performance improvement and cost reduction. 
  With a numerical wind tunnel, the volume of materials used 
will probably become enormous, but what would be appropriate for 
the purpose of improving reliability and maintainability? The 
users of the numerical wind tunnel will be CFD researchers and 
technicians, rather than computer engineering specialists, so a 
stringent attitude will probably be taken towards malfunctions. 
Furthermore, since the numerical wind tunnel is not just an 
experimental computer but also a practical computer, it will be 
just as important -- in terms of the success or failure of the 
numerical wind tunnel -- to maintain NWT hardware reliability at 
high levels as to achieve the targeted performance in the first 
place. 
<H5>  3.3 Performance Demands for Element Computer </H5>
  Two items in particular will be necessary in order to take 
the NWT, which is a distributed main memory parallel computer, 
and achieve its widespread use among ordinary operators who are 
not computer specialists, as follows. 
  (i) Either an optimizing compiler for Fortran programs 
written according to a Fortran standard for parallel 
programming, or a compiler that automatically optimizes programs 
written in current Fortran for parallel implementation. 
  (ii) Parallel-running programming support software including 
debugging and tuning tools. 
  We will bring a practical computer in among CFD technicians 
and researchers who are not computer specialists and seek to 
devise both (i) and (ii) above in conversations with computer 
specialists and ordinary users. So doing, we will adopt a policy 
of promoting the growth and proliferation of knowledge needed 
for high-level utilization of parallel computers among users. 
  When this policy is adopted, it is necessary to guarantee 
the 
following minimum limitation for users. 
  (R2) The processing of jobs that are appropriate for 
processing using the VP400 are to be processed on one element 
computer without program alteration, and the processing speed 
therefore is to be the VP400 speed or higher. 
<H3>  3.4 Conditions for Interconnecting Network -- Compatibility 
Between Interconnecting Network and CFD Computation Methods </H3>
  When we survey recent CFD computation techniques from the 
perspective of parallel computing, we see the following. 
  (1) Computation schemes are tending to become more complex 
to 
achieve higher precision. 
  (2) Research is being done on non-structure lattices as well 
as on structure lattices. 
  (3) In terms of solving methods, negative solution methods 
in 
general, and the IAF method in particular, are dominant over 
positive solving methods, but if interest shifts to problems 
such as unsteady problems where there is not much of an 
advantage with the negative solving methods, the present 
situation could change. Nevertheless, when it comes to 
applications to actual problems of technological development, 
the track record of the IAF method cannot be disregarded. 
  Item (1) will make stringent demands on the performance of 
parallel computers in the area of interconnecting network data 
transfers. 
  In processing CFD programs which use the non-structure 
lattices noted in item (2), list vector processing will be 
mandatory. This will make stringent demands not only on 
interconnecting network data transfer performance, but also on 
hardware and software performance. 
  In methods for solving linear equations that are negative 
solving methods, it will be necessary to adopt sequential 
computation for single-axis directions in three-dimensional 
space. 
  With structure lattices which are graphically simplified, it 
is not practicable to disregard the computation methods that 
employ sequential computations in single-axis directions, so, 
when one axis is used in vectoring, the remaining axis will be 
parallelized. 
  When we consider that the scale of problems visualized for 
the NWT having the power set forth in (R1) is on the order of 
several thousand x several hundred x several hundred, this comes 
bouncing back in the form of a limitation on the number of 
parallel computers. 
  In particular, with the IAF technique that is an important 
negative solution method, the sequential computation axis 
changes from X to Y to Z, so not only are stringent performance 
demands made on interconnecting network data transfers, but 
stringent demands are also made on the network topology and on 
the number of element computers configuring the numerical wind 
tunnel. 
  Our numerical wind tunnel must be able to deal effectively 
with all CFD techniques. And we should not adopt an 
interconnecting network which exhibits high performance only for 
specific CFD techniques and inadequate performance for other 
techniques. 
  From (R2) set forth in 3.3 above and the conditions noted in 
this subsection, we can see that it will be very difficult to 
implement NWT with several thousands to several tens of 
thousands of microprocessors. 
<H5>  4. NWT Hardware Configuration, Performance </H5>
<H5>  4.1 PE Configuration, Performance </H5>
  The processing speed of a VR-equipped vector computer is 
determined mainly by the following eight factors. 
  (i) Machine clock cycle time (hereinafter abbreviated _t_) 
  (ii) Pipeline multiplicity 
  (iii) Type and number of pipelines, and number of pipelines 
supporting simultaneous activity 
  (iv) Ability of main memory to provide data 
  (v) VR number and length 
  (vi) Rise time for various pipelines 
  (vii) Instruction execution control format 
  (viii) Scalar instruction processing mode, register 
configuration, cache memory volume and control mode. 
  First, we assumed that items (vii) and (viii) would be the 
same as in the VP400, and then prepared many PE candidate models 
in terms of PE design parameters for the hardware resource 
quantities and timing noted in items (ii) through (vi). Next we 
examined typical CFD programs at NAL and selected 18 
representative characteristics including number of vector 
instructions, ratio of various types of vector instruction, and 
the ratio between vector load/store instructions and vector 
operation instructions and then estimated 18 DO-loop processing 
speeds for various PE models, with vector lengths of 32 and 128, 
using the software simulator VTAP which simulates the actions of 
a vector computer. The error in the VTAP simulations for the 
VP400 processing speeds for the 18 DO loops was within +/- 
10% 
and the mean error was 6.8%. 
  In Figure 4 we have plotted the results for one PE model 
series. The pipeline multiplicity in this PE model series was 
varied from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16, with the other parameters 
being made up of six fixed models. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-08A>           Figure 4. PE Pipeline Multiplicity (128 VRs) </FIG>



  Pipeline multiplicity is plotted on the horizontal axis in 
this figure, and machine clock time _t_ on the vertical axis. 
  Here we modify the (R2) demand that the PE CFD program 
processing speed be VP400 or better to (R2'). 
  (R2') VTAP estimated value for PE processing speed for all 
18 
DO loops at vector lengths of 32 and 128 &gt;  VTAP estimated 
values for VP400 processing speed. 
  The times in Figure 4 of 1.6, 3.1, 6.4, 12.6, and 12.9 ns 
are 
the required PE machine clock times as calculated from the 
simulation results for maximum machine clock times at which the 
PE model satisfies (R2'), and then shortened another 10% 
in the 
interest of safety. The ECL and BiCMOS in the diagram are the 
names of the logic elements that should be adopted to achieve 
these machine clock times. The x symbol indicates that it is 
difficult to achieve this value of _t_ by means of usable logic 
elements. 
  After doing comparative studies on the results of 
simulations 
on various other PE models (besides this PE model series), we 
found that this PE model series is the most effective series 
among the PE models which we studied. 
  After comparing the power consumption of a PE with _t_ = 
3.1 
ns and a pipeline multiplicity of 2 using ECL elements with that 
of a PE with _t_ = 12.6 ns and pipeline multiplicity of 8 using 
BiCMOS elements, we found that the latter PE model would be 
better for use in the NWT. When BiCMOS elements are used, 
moreover, one can be sure that a machine clock time of around 10 
ns will be achieved. 
  In Table 1 [not reproduced] are represented the processing 
times (in MFLOPS) estimated by VTAP for two NAL CFD programs 
(NS3D and NSMD) for this PE model, and the actual measured 
MFLOPS values and VTAP-estimated MFLOPS values for the VP400 and 
VP200. From this table we see that we can expect a CFD program 
processing speed for the NWT PE that is 1.4 times the VP400 
speed. 
<H5>  4.2 NWT Hardware Configuration, Performance </H5>
  Since we made it clear in 4.1 above that the PE performance 
would be about 1.4 times that of the VP400, it is evident that a 
NWT which satisfies (R1) can be configured with 200 or fewer PE 
units. If the number of PE units is less than 200, then we are 
able to adopt an interconnect network that is based either on 
crossbar interconnection or complete interconnection. By 
adopting a powerful network, we can expect a PE efficiency of 
around 0.5. In such a case, the following would apply. 
  -- In order to satisfy R1, it is only necessary to have 150 
or more PE units. If we have 256 MB main memory capacity for 
each PE unit, then the total main memory capacity for the NWT 
would be about 38 GB. 
  In Figure 5 is presented a conceptual block diagram of the 
NWT. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-08B>           Figure 5. NWT Conceptual Block Diagram </FIG>



<H5>  5. Features Needed in NWT Programming and Compiler (P&amp;C) </H5>
  In this section we give a broad overview of the main P&amp;C 
features required for maintaining an NWT PE efficiency of 0.5 or 
better. These features may be implemented in program writing 
(the programmer's responsibility) or by the compiler, or by a 
combination of both. 
  In Figures 6-1 and 6-2 are given conceptual running diagrams 
when programs are run on one PE and on n PE units, respectively.

equals Execution time when P[.sup]j[/] is parallel-processed 
  The time (TS) for processing the program with one PE unit 
and 
the time (TPN) for processing the program with n PE units are 
given by the following formulas. 


  Now, if we take F as the number of floating point operations 
(included only in P[.sup]j[/] or S[.sub]i[/]) required to 
execute the entire program, we get F/TS as the program 
processing speed for one PE unit, and (F/TS) x (TS/TPN) as the 
program processing speed with n PE units. Accordingly, it is 
essential to make TS/TPN as large as possible in the interest of 
improving speed by parallel processing. The P&amp;C features 
needed, 
in conceptual terms, to accomplish are evident from Figures 6-1 
and 6-2. The most important ones are noted below. 
  (A) Improved ability of P&amp;C to find those portions that 
are 
parallel-processable so as to shorten S[.sup]i[/] and reduce 
the ParaOS[.sup]i[/] frequency 
  (B) Improved P&amp;C capabilities to facilitate reduction 
in data 
transmission volume and frequency so as to reduce frequency of 
S\R[.sup]j1[/] and shorten processing time 
  (C) P&amp;C functions to facilitate P[.sup]j1[/] and 
S\R[.sup]j1[/] parallel action 
  (D) P&amp;C functions to facilitate PI[.sup]j1[/] and 
P[.sup]j1[/] parallel actions 
  (E) P&amp;C functions to facilitate reduction of volume and 
frequency of referencing data stored in other PEs for the 
purpose of reducing the SYO[.sup]j1[/] frequency 
  (F) In the interest of decreasing W[.sup]j1[/] as much as 
possible, 
  (i) P&amp;C functions to facilitate equalization of 
divisions of 
P[.sup]j[/] to P[.sub]j1[/] 
  (ii) Since it is necessary to make it so that 
S\R[.sup]j1[/] processing does not compete on the network 
more than the absolute minimum, in order to make 
S\R[.sup]j1[/] equal for all 1's, the necessary P&amp;C 
scheduling functions 
  There must naturally be cooperation by both the hardware and 
the computation methods to facilitate the achievement of (A) 
through (F). If the degree to which (A) through (F) are achieved 
rises, it will be possible to satisfy (R1) with our NWT CFD 
program processing speed using P&amp;C.

  [Text] Abstract: A three-dimensional 
Navier-Stokes calculation of flow inside a supersonic 
mixed-compression inlet, designed for Mach 2.5, was carried out. 
A multi-block method was applied to the calculation grids. 
Complex configurations of bleed holes and throat slot were 
simulated in order to compare the solution with experimental 
(test) data. As a result, detailed information on the flow -- 
which is usually difficult to obtain experimentally -- was 
obtained. 
  At this inlet under the supersonic flow-through conditions, 
the flow was found to be two-dimensional in 90% of the 
spanwise 
direction. In the vicinity of the side-walls, however, 
three-dimensional separation occurred along the cowl shock. The 
separation induced a vortex, and the vortex was stretched and 
swallowed into the throat slot. The ramp bleed ahead of the 
cowl-shock-impinge line was found to plan an important role in 
preventing the separation region from spreading. A 
static-wall-pressure comparison between the results and the 
experimental (test) data showed reasonable agreement. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  In recent years, assiduous research efforts have been going 
on in Japan as elsewhere on supersonic air inlets for 
applications in such vehicles as the next generation of 
supersonic airliners and space planes.[.sup]1[/] Research to 
date has been focused on elucidating the operating 
characteristics, bleed characteristics, and bleeding role in 
supersonic mixed-compression air inlets using experimental 
techniques[.sup]2[/] and two-dimensional mathematical 
analysis.[.sup]3[/] The experimental techniques do provide 
much useful information, but there are limits as to model size, 
blower time, and blow frequency, making it very difficult at 
present to obtain detailed knowledge of complex internal flows. 
  The purpose of our research is to elucidate flow sites 
inside 
supersonic air inlets -- which are difficult to gain accurate 
knowledge of experimentally -- by means of three-dimensional 
mathematical analysis, and then use this information in 
subsequent research. 
<H5>  2. Calculation Grids </H5>
  For the calculation grids we used multi-block mapping. With 
the multi-block method, grids can be generated relatively easily 
for even the most complex shapes, and the analysis codes which 
use this require no special handling for each object shape. In 
Figure 1 is shown the relationship between objects in the grid 
space defined regularly by I, J, and K, and objects in actual 
physical space (x, y, z). In Figure 2 are shown the calculation 
grids used. The number of grid points in the x, y, and z 
dimensions are 103 x 80 x 90 (but the y dimension is calculated 
with the half width of 40 points). For the bleed holes in the 
ramp, a square, porous wall was simulated, and the throat bleed 
holes are made slotted. The grid point coordinates are defined 
by all of the air flow paths (including the inside of each bleed 
hole). Inside the main duct, a fine grid is employed so that 
boundary layers along the wall can be ascertained precisely. 
This air inlet has a height:width proportion of 2:3, with the 
outlet shape not choked off in a circular shape but made a 
square shape (and the same flow path shape as was used in 
experiments described subsequently).

<H5>  3. Analysis Code </H5>
  The basic equations used are the Reynolds mean Navier-Stokes 
integration equations. Coakly's q-_o_ model is used for the 
turbulence model.[.sup]4[/] Separation is determined by the 
limited volume method and cell boundary numerical flux by Roe's 
approximating Rieman analysis, to which TVD conditions are 
applied.[.sup]5[/] For this calculation, the ADI method is 
used for the y-z plane and the Gauss-Seidel method for the x 
dimension. The equations are spatially solved, with the 
first-order-precision negative solution method used for the time 
integration. 
<H5>  4. Analysis Conditions </H5>
  We made the Mach number 2.5, the Reynolds number 
10[.sup]7[/] based on the standard of inlet height of the 
item being tested, with _a_ = _b_ = 0. In this 
analysis, we 
made the area of the exhaust louver-type exhaust port constant 
without particularly regulating the bleed volume. In these 
tests, moreover, since the objective was to ascertain the 
interference in the supersonic section between the sidewall 
boundary layer(s) and the diagonal shock wave(s), we did not 
generate a terminal shock wave, but employed conditions such 
that outflow was still at supersonic speeds at the main duct 
outlet. 
<H5>  5. Analysis Results </H5>
  In Figure 3 [not reproduced] is represented an equal Mach 
contour diagram on the center surface. The two ramp shock waves 
and cowl shock waves, and the entropy compression continuing 
therefrom, were attained as designed, and the results obtained 
were almost the same as those from the two-dimensional 
analysis.[.sup]3[/] The throat shock wave is a diagonal shock 
wave that is generated when the bleed causes the flow to strike 
the back of the slot. Since we have set low back-pressure 
conditions, the flow is accelerated behind this and flows out at 
supersonic speed. In Figure 4 [not reproduced] is shown an equal 
Mach contour diagram at the 95% span position. In this 
way, in 
the vicinity of the sidewall, we find separation in the vicinity 
of cowl shock wave injection point. The third-column ramp bleed 
hole(s) prevent this separation region from spreading, 
indicating the importance of bleeding at this position. As a 
result of varying the cross-section delineated by the equal Mach 
contour diagram in the span direction, we found that 
two-dimensionality is maintained to approximately the 90% 
span 
position. 
  In Figure 5 [not reproduced] we have an equal Mach contour 
diagram at the x = constant cross-section as seen from different 
perspectives, (a) and (b). (The wall surface on the near side is 
not represented.) The separation region in the vicinity of the 
cowl shock wave injection point is sucked into the aft throat 
bleed hole(s), and we can observe a thick boundary layer region 
in the sidewall cowl region(s) also. 
  In Figure 6 [not reproduced] we see flow trails from 
particles emitted from three places very close to the sidewall 
as seen from (a) the side, (b) diagonally from the front, and 
(c) directly from the front. Looking downstream, the 
three-dimensional separation region at the left sidewall becomes 
a vortex which rotates clockwise along the cowl shock wave and 
is eventually sucked into the throat bleed place. The flow which 
passes through the cowl shock wave is subjected to a sudden 
reverse-pressure gradient. The inner layer region of the 
sidewall boundary layer has lower kinetic energy than the outer 
layer, so the flow turns toward the ramp side (up). That is why 
a clockwise vortex is generated. 
  When we view the movement of this vortex in moving pictures, 
we find that the speed of rotation increases the closer the 
vortex approaches to the throat bleed hole(s), with the 
occurrence of vortex stretching. 
  In Figure 7 we compare the wall static 
pressures.[.sup]2,6[/] At (a) is shown a static pressure 
distribution in the flow direction, with comparisons made 
between the values on the center surface in this analysis (solid 
curve), the two-dimensional NS analysis values (dotted curve), 
and the test values (symbols).[.sup]3,7[/] In the external 
compression region (x &lt; 1.7), the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional values agree perfectly, but a slight 
difference develops in the internal compression region (x &gt; 
1.7). We think this is due to the influence of the sidewall. 
Nevertheless, there is relatively good agreement between the 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional analysis and test values. 
At (b) in Figure 7 we have diagrammed the static pressure 
distributions in the span direction at the positions indicated 
in (a) (i.e. Sec. 1, Sec. 2). The agreement with the test values 
is good. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-13A>           Figure 7. Wall Static Pressure Distributions (Compared </FIG>



<H5>  6. Concluding Remarks </H5>
  The following facts were established as a result of 
conducting the three-dimensional analysis on the supersonic air 
inlet. 
  (1) With this air inlet, under conditions of supersonic 
outflow, the two-dimensionality of the flow is maintained to 
approximately 90% in the span direction. 
  (2) In the vicinity of the sidewalls, three-dimensional 
separation occurs along the cowl shock wave, and the 
third-column ramp bleed helps prevent this region from spreading. 
  (3) With respect to the static pressure distribution at the 
wall in the center plane under conditions of supersonic outflow, 
there is almost no difference with the [results of] 
two-dimensional analysis, and there is good agreement with the 
test values. There is also good agreement between the spanwise 
static pressure distribution and the test values. 
  With these findings in hand, we plan to conduct 
three-dimensional analyses in cases where the flow is 
decelerated to subsonic speeds by the terminal shock wave.

  [Text] Abstract: Numerical solutions of 
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are obtained for 
two-dimensional flows inside a mixed-compression supersonic air 
intake with its operation range from supercritical to 
subcritical. 
  Computed wall pressure data are compared with wind tunnel 
data to show that their agreement is quite good except for the 
secondary post-shock value, although the analytical value agrees 
quite well with the present computation. 
  This discrepancy may be due to a three-dimensional effect in 
the wind tunnel experiments. 
  A comparison among numerical solutions for an inviscid flow 
obtained by the use of several types of numerical flux 
expressions indicates that solutions are strongly affected by 
the flux scheme and a possible reason for this can be attributed 
to the scheme's capability of resolving linear characteristic 
waves. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  A supersonic air intake is a device that efficiently 
acquires 
the air necessary for combustion in an air-breathing engine and 
compresses it to the required pressure. Much research work has 
been done in recent years including CFD. We here compare the 
results of our two-dimensional mathematical analysis with test 
results, and compare the numerical solutions based on several 
schemes obtained during the analysis. We then consider what 
effects the different schemes had on the solutions. 
<H5>  2. Supersonic Air Intake </H5>
  The model used in these calculations supports three modes, 
namely a supercritical, a critical, and a subcritical mode (cf. 
Figure 1). The restoration pressure is done [sic] most 
efficiently in the critical state, and progressively less 
efficiently as the degree of supercriticality increases. At 
subcritical, it sometimes becomes impossible to obtain the 
necessary flow volume. Accordingly, operation is normally done 
in a supercritical state that is near-critical, with a margin 
allowed prior to subcritical. When this is done, there is 
interference between the boundary layer(s) and the final shock 
wave inside the duct and this can trigger separation. If the 
vortices induced by such separation become large enough, not 
only is the flow pipe constricted so that the predicted pressure 
restoration cannot be effected, but the final shock wave may be 
pushed out so that a subcritical state is created. For this 
reason, when designing an intake, it is necessary to reproduce 
each of the modes that are determined by back pressure and find 
out what the separation situation is. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-14A>           Figure 1. Supersonic Air Intake Operating Modes </FIG>



<H5>  3. Calculation Model, Calculation Conditions </H5>
  In Figure 2 are diagrammed the shape of the model and the 
calculation grid. A virtual variable-choke nozzle is provided 
for the intake outlet so that any desired back-pressure can be 
simulated. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-14B>           Figure 2. Calculation Model and Calculation Grid </FIG>



  The main flow condition is sea-level Mach 2. 
<H5>  4. </H5>
  The basic equations used are the two-dimensional 
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations in which a two-layer 
algebraic turbulence model is employed.[.sup]1[/] 
  We perform spatial integration using the finite volume 
method, and implement second-order precision with MUSCL. For the 
evaluation of convective factor flux at the cell boundary we use 
Roe's approximate Rieman solver.[.sup]2[/] The viscosity 
factor is discretized with the second-order precision central 
differences. 
  Time integration is performed with the second-order 
precision 
rational Runge-Kutta method.[.sup]3[/] 
<H5>  5. Boundary Conditions </H5>
  As to the exit conditions inside the intake, supersonic 
outflow conditions are imparted by setting the virtual nozzle. 
Conventionally this should be connected to the intake downstream 
at subsonic speed, but it is very difficult to set subsonic 
outflow boundaries for flows containing vortices, and inevitably 
a non-physics result is imparted. With the virtual nozzle the 
back pressure can be controlled and it is possible to set simple 
boundary conditions which make sense in terms of physics. 
<H5>  6. Comparing Calculation Results Against Test Data </H5>
  In Figure 3, at (a) through (c), are shown density 
distributions at supercritical, critical, and subcritical 
states. As can be seen, at supercritical and subcritical, when 
the final shock wave becomes strong, the separation-induced 
vortices are large, while at critical the vortices do not grow 
all that much. The static pressure distribution at the lower 
wall surface is depicted in Figure 4. In this figure the test 
results for the supercritical state are represented by small 
circles. Except for the pressure rise caused by the second shock 
wave, the calculation results agree well with the test results. 
The calculation results coincide with the two-dimensional 
analysis solutions, so the differences in these results are 
thought to be due either to three-dimensionality or to 
measurement errors. The total pressure distribution inside the 
intake is diagrammed in Figure 5. It is evident that 
separation-vortex-induced distortion occurs close to the wall 
surface.

  We found that, in the Eulerian calculations that were done 
at 
the initial stage of analysis, differences occurred in the 
results with the Roe method and the van Leer 
method.[.sup]4[/] We, therefore, added other schemes and did 
the calculations using six different methods, and then compared 
the results. 
  The first schemes we took up were the Roe method, van Leer 
method, Osher method,[.sup]5[/] Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLLE) 
method,[.sup]6[/] and modified Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLLEM) 
method.[.sup]6[/] With the Roe method, furthermore, we 
employed the Chakravarthy[.sup]7[/] and Lin[.sup]8[/] 
techniques in order to satisfy the entropy conditions. With the 
Roe method, it is necessary to add an artificial viscosity to 
the characteristic velocity _l_[.sup]k[/] in order to prevent 
expansion shock at points of sonic velocity. However, with the 
Chakravarthy technique, the _l_[.sup]k+/-[/][.sup]i+1/2[/] 
at the cell boundary obtained by Roe approximation is varied as 
follows, namely, at sonic rarefaction 
(_l_[.sup]k[/][.sup]i[/] &lt; 0 &lt; 
_l_[.sup]k[/][.sup]i+1[/]), 




<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-15D>           p&gt; With the Lin technique, there is a converging acceleration </FIG>

  With the Lin technique, there is a converging acceleration 
effect, and an effect which inhibits the carbuncle phenomenon by 
which the Mach lines are distorted at the nose in hypersonic 
calculations for blunt objects. We next represent the Lin method.

  In these equations, u and a represent 
the Roe-averaged velocity perpendicular to the cell boundary, 
and the speed of sound, respectively. The factor 
k[.sup]1[/] helps prevent expansion shock, 
k[.sup]2[/] helps smooth out the shock wave(s), 
and k[.sup]3[/] helps eliminate instability. The 
k[.sup]p[/] factors are the same as those used in 
stabilizing the convective factor calculation based on the 
central differences of Jameson,[.sup]9[/] and are defined as 
follows.

where p[.sup]i,j[/] is the pressure. At the 
  where p[.sup]i,j[/] is the pressure. At the 
cell boundaries, we use averages of the values of adjacent 
cells. The values of the constants are k[.sup]1[/] 
= 0.25, 0  k[.sup]2[/]  5, and 
k[.sup]3[/] = 15. Here we used 
k[.sup]1[/] = 0.25, k[.sub]2[/] = 5, 
and k[.sup]3[/] = 15. 
  We show the results of Eulerian calculations done in 
relatively coarse meshes. The tip of the intake lip has become a 
flat head having twice the thickness of the grid interval in 
closest proximity to the wall (cf. Figure 6). By this means we 
obtained interesting results. In Figures 7(a) through 7(f) are 
depicted the density distributions based on the Roe 
(Chakravarthy), Roe (Lin), Osher, HLLE, HLLEM, and van Leer 
methods. The respective lower wall static pressure distributions 
are plotted in Figure 8. We can divide these into three groups, 
according to the separation conditions, namely (1) Roe 
(Chakravarthy) and Osher, (2) Roe (Lin) and HLLEM, and (3) HLLE 
and van Leer. In group (1), separation was caused by the final 
shock wave, and the induced vortices pushed the shock waves 
upstream, resulting in subcritical states. In group (2), slight 
separation does occur, but there is convergence in the 
supercritical state. In group (3), no separation occurs. The 
entropy profile in the vicinity of the intake tip is represented 
in Figures 9(a) and 9(b). Inside this high-entropy layer, the 
velocity is slower than outside of it, resulting in a boundary 
layer-like velocity distribution. We think that separation 
occurs here due to a steep pressure gradient produced by the 
final shock wave. The generation of the high-entropy layer 
occurs when the tip angle is exceeded, and we do not think it 
occurs when the tip is made sharper. The group (2) high-entropy 
layers are thinner than those in group (1), for which reason we 
do not think that large separation was reached. In group (3), 
conversely, the high-entropy layer is thick and the peak is low. 
We believe this is due to the fact that the linear wave 
resolutions are inferior with scheme (3), as they are known to 
be. Thus we think that the differences in local linear wave 
resolution cause large changes in the numerical solutions.

<H5>  8. Concluding Remarks </H5>
  We were able to simulate flows in each mode, without going 
to 
extremes, by using a virtual variable nozzle to control back 
pressure. It is also possible to do unsteady calculations by 
continuously varying the nozzle constriction. The results of 
comparisons against test results were good, but we need -- and 
in the future plan -- to work with systems of two equations on a 
three-dimensionalized turbulence model in order to investigate 
separation and vortices. With the inviscid flow calculations, we 
compared convective-factor flux calculation schemes, and found 
differences in the calculation results which appear to be caused 
by linear wave resolution [differences].

  [Text] Abstract: The flowfields in 
high-efficiency mixed compression inlets with throat cavities 
have been performed numerically by solving two-dimensional 
compressible Navier-Stokes equations using Harten-Yee's TVD 
scheme. In the present study, the configuration of the 
experimental inlet is taken in computation as closely as 
possible. The flowfield of the inlet including the throat cavity 
region is discretized and solved simultaneously with the 
external flow regions. The numerical results demonstrate the 
flow behavior around the throat cavity for typical cases of mass 
flow-plug and wall bleed. Comparison with the experimental 
results for static pressure distributions and flow 
characteristics shows reasonable agreement and also points up 
the limitations of the two-dimensional analysis. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The supersonic intake is an important configurational 
element 
which must handle either most or all of the compression 
processes in air-breathing engines for supersonic aircraft. Many 
of these supersonic intakes have bleed holes in the walls for 
the purpose of preventing boundary layer separation and 
improving intake start performance, and throat cavities to 
stabilize the final shock wave. For this reason, the flow inside 
the intake becomes very complex, and precisely predicting flow 
sites is critical to the development of supersonic intakes. 
  Meanwhile, with improvements in computer performance and 
advances in calculation techniques, there have been phenomenal 
advances in mathematical computation technology, and the range 
of applications broadens year after year. In the field of 
compression flows, in particular, it has become possible to do 
high-precision, stable calculations for high-Mach flow sites, 
thanks to the development of the TVD scheme. As a result, it has 
become relatively easy to analyze the flows inside supersonic 
and scram-jet intakes, with an increasing number of such 
analyses being done with each passing year. 
  In this research, we analyzed the flows inside supersonic 
intakes having a cavity in the throat section, using the TVD 
scheme and solving numerically with the Navier-Stokes equations. 
We were thus able to simulate the flow conditions in the 
vicinity of the cavity under various conditions. We also 
compared the results of these calculations with the results of 
wind tunnel tests done on models of the same 
intakes.[.sup]1[/] 
<H5>  2. Basic Formulas, Numerical Calculation Methods </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Intake Model </H5>
  In Figure 1 is presented a simplified view of the supersonic 
intake used in the wind tunnel tests selected for our 
computation subjects. This intake is called a mixed-compression 
intake which uses both external and internal compression. It 
performs external compression with four shock waves which are 
produced from the ramp, and then performs internal compression 
by three more shock waves from the cowl. The flow passes through 
the final shock wave of the throat, is decelerated to subsonic 
speed, and is pressure-restored by a diffuser. In a 
mixed-compression intake it is necessary to hold the shock 
wave(s) inside the channel. This means that we may expect large 
separation to occur with it being impossible to avoid 
interference between the shock wave(s) and the boundary layer. 
For this reason, bleed holes are positioned in the ramp wall 
just in front of the throat to suppress separation of the 
boundary layer. The cavity that is made in the upper wall at the 
throat is called a throat cavity and functions to hold the final 
shock wave stably in the throat. From this cavity there is a 
flow path which extends through to the outside of the intake. 
Part of the flow inside the cavity passes through this path and 
flows out of the intake. A flow plug that is provided at the 
diffuser exit moves back and forth to control the flow volume 
and thereby adjust the exhaust pressure, and is operated so as 
to achieve the optimum start-up condition.

<H5>  2.2 Basic Formulas and Algorithms </H5>
  The basic formulas used are the two-dimensional compressible 
Navier-Stokes formula in which an ordinary coordinate system 
(_x_, _ee_) is employed. The formula used for the viscosity 
factor has been thin-layer approximated. This formula can be 
expressed as follows. 




<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-19B>           Equation </FIG>

  [Text]where 



  [Text]are determined as follows. 



  [Text] 
  where p is the pressure determined from state 
equations for an ideal gas, U and V are 
contravariant velocities, _g_ is the specific heat, 
Pr is the Prandtl number, Re is the 
Reynolds number, a is the speed of sound, and 
J is a conversion Jacobian. When doing the 
calculations, formula (1) is time-integrated with the 
cross-braced ADI method,[.sup]2[/] and steady solutions are 
obtained. The TVD scheme of Harten-Yee[.sup]3[/] is used in 
discretizing the convection factors on the right side at this 
time, so as to enhance the stability and shock-wave acquisition 
capabilities at high Mach numbers. In discretizing the viscosity 
factors, the central differences are used. The Baldwin-Lomax 
algebraic model is used for the turbulence model.[.sup]4[/] 
The cavity and external flow regions are not divided into blocks 
or the like so that they can be calculated separately, but 
handled by expanding them into a single calculation region. For 
this reason, we wind up having grid points in the solid regions 
of cowl and ramp wall also, but these grid points are restricted 
so that the state volume does not change even when time 
integration is performed. With this equation, it is not 
necessary to determine the boundary values algebraically because 
the calculation regions are connected, so the precision of the 
calculation does not suffer. This is also effective for 
supercomputer calculations. 
<H5>  2.3 Calculation Grid </H5>
  In Figure 2 is depicted the grid used in the calculations. 
The grid numbers are 530 x 250 including grid points in the cowl 
and other solid regions, and are generated algebraically. The 
calculation region extends to the external regions as well as 
the regions inside the intake. A channel extends from the inside 
of the throat cavity to the external region, and part of the 
flow inside the cavity is bled naturally to the outside. The 
flow plug provided at the diffuser exit does not handle the same 
shapes as are used in test models. Instead, the plug is 
simplified by providing a second throat and the calculation is 
done. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-20A>           Figure 2. Calculation grid (530 x 250) </FIG>



<H5>  3. Results of Numerical Calculations </H5>
  In this analysis, the uniform-flow Mach number was set at 
3.0, which is the design Mach number for this intake. The 
Reynolds number was then matched with the test conditions, and 
the calculations were performed under conditions of 2 x 
10[.sup]6[/]. The conditions of the flow plug at the exit of 
the diffuser are represented as Ae/At, using the throat area At 
and the diffuser exit area Ae, and calculations were done for 
three cases, with the value of Ae/At being 1.13, 0.94, and 0.86, 
respectively. 
  In Figure 3 are represented the results of computations at 
Ae/At = 1.13. At (a) the overall flow conditions in the intake 
are depicted in terms of a Mach number distribution. At (b) we 
have an enlargement of the throat vicinity. Four shock waves are 
generated from the ramp wall and head for the cowl tip. Then 
from the cowl we have three shock waves which extend as far as 
the throat cavity to produce the shock wave pattern as designed. 
The weak swell that is seen at the ramp wall just in front of 
the throat cavity is due to bleeding. We can see a slightly 
strong swell developing from above the cavity, and thus know 
that the flow is circulating inside the cavity. Part of this 
circulating flow passes through the duct which goes to the 
outside of the intake and is thus bled off to the outside. A 
strong compression wave and swell are visible at the back end of 
the cavity. At (c) is seen a Schlieren photograph taken in the 
vicinity of the throat in the tests. In this photograph we can 
see the shock wave(s) coming from the cowl and the way in which 
they reach as far as above the cavity, as well as the 
compression wave and swell from the back end of the cavity. Thus 
we see how well the results of the numerical calculations 
simulate the flow conditions inside the intake. At (d) we 
compare the wall pressure distributions obtained by the 
calculations and the pressure distributions from the tests. The 
pressure distribution above the ramp wall agrees well with the 
pressure rise from the four shock waves as far as the throat 
cavity. Also, the pressure first declines over the cavity, and 
then rises again due to the shock wave which is generated from 
the back end of the cavity. However, under these conditions, no 
final shock wave exists, and the flow does not become subsonic 
even beyond the end of the throat, so the optimal conditions are 
not attained. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-21A>           Figure 3. Calculation Results (Ae/At = 1.13) </FIG>



  In Figure 4 are plotted the results of calculations at Ae/At 
= 0.94. First of all, from (a), when we look at the condition of 
the flow on the upstream side from the throat, there is no 
change from the computed results under the conditions previously 
indicated. This is because the entire flow upstream from the 
throat is supersonic, and because the effects of the flow plug 
change are not propagated this far. Meanwhile, a terminal shock 
wave appears a little behind the throat cavity. This was not 
seen in the previous case(s). This shock wave appears to 
interfere with the compression wave from the back of the throat 
cavity and curve in an arc. In the Schlieren photograph at (c) 
we see a curved terminal shock wave a little toward the throat 
cavity. However, as may be seen from the computational results, 
this shock wave itself does not curve, but it appears to curve 
due to the interference between the terminal shock wave and the 
shock wave from behind the throat cavity. Compared to the 
previous case(s), the influence of the presence of this shock 
wave is great. Based on the wall pressure distributions plotted 
in (d), the pressure rise that occurs near the throat is far 
higher than in the previous case(s) when no terminal shock wave 
existed. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-22A>           Figure 4. Computation Results </FIG>



  In Figure 5 is represented the flow at Ae/At = 0.86 where 
the 
flow plug is further constrained. In this condition also the 
flow upstream from the throat is entirely supersonic, and 
exhibits no change from the other cases. Basically the condition 
of the flow in the vicinity of the throat is the same as the 
Ae/At = 0.94 case, but the position of the terminal shock wave 
is slightly aft in this case. The interference with the 
compression wave near the cavity has disappeared, and a single 
terminal shock is formed. From the Schlieren photograph at (c) 
we can see that this shock wave appears farther forward than in 
the previous case(s), and the shape thereof is not really curved 
but is close to a straight line. Thus we see that the 
calculations agree well with the results obtained from the 
tests. We see a further pressure rise in the pressure 
distributions in (d). However, when we compare these pressure 
distributions against the test values, the computation results 
always predict higher values. The reason for this is that, in 
the tests, the intake is a duct with a rectangular 
cross-section, and is incapable of exhibiting a completely 
two-dimensional flow. Accordingly, we must consider the 
possibility of the effects of eddies which are produced in 
corners where separation is believed to exist which is 
equivalent to the separation seen above the ramp and cowl 
wall(s), even at the side walls. These eddies reduce the intake 
efficiency, and adequate pressure rise is not achieved. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-23A>           Figure 5. Computation Results </FIG>



  In Figure 6 is represented the relationship between captured 
flow volume (Gco) and total pressure recovery rate 
(Pr). The captured flow volume is roughly constant up 
to the point where the flow plug is closed to a certain point, 
and the total pressure recovery rate increases as the flow plug 
is closed. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-24A>           Figure 6. Intake Characteristics </FIG>




  The captured flow volume decreases from certain conditions 
because the terminal shock wave reaches a point above the throat 
cavity, the flow downstream from the shock wave is pushed inside 
the cavity, and this flows out to the outside. The test results 
are also noted in this graph. When we compare these to the 
computed results, we see that there is qualitative agreement in 
the trends, but the computed values for both the total pressure 
recovery rate and captured flow volume are higher. We can say 
nothing for sure about the reason for this, but a disparity 
appears in the pressure distributions due to 
three-dimensionality, and the cavity bleed hole is 
three-dimensional. Hence the possibility that this also is due 
to three-dimensionality is great. 
<H5>  4. Summary </H5>
  We simulated the flow inside a mixed compression type 
supersonic intake having a cavity in the throat section, using 
the TVD scheme to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. In the 
analysis, we handled the intakes of complex shape in single 
computational regions. This enabled us to perform highly 
efficient calculations. In making comparisons with test results, 
we found that the numerical calculations represent well the 
changes in flow conditions due to opening and closing the flow 
plug, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the numerical 
calculations. On the down side, these analyses also demonstrated 
the limitations of two-dimensional analysis. In the actual 
intakes, we think that there is considerable influence from the 
boundary layer at the side walls, but we were unable to take 
this into consideration with the two-dimensional analysis. For 
this reason, in the static pressure distributions, the 
computation results always predict higher values than the test 
results downstream of the throat where the presence of large 
separation is predicted. Accordingly, if more precise 
intra-intake flows need to be predicted, it will probably be 
necessary to go to three-dimensional analysis. 
  This research is part of a joint research effort between the 
National Aerospace Laboratory and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy 
Industries.

  [Text] Abstract: In this paper, the roles of 
wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in 
the aircraft development is briefly described. The stress is put 
on the importance of CFD as an aerodynamic design tool to 
drastically reduce both cost and period of development. 
  Prior to the application of CFD to practical design problem, 
the existing CFD codes must be verified with the reliable 
experimental data. A demonstrative example of CFD validation is 
presented to show the state of the arts of CFD by comparing the 
Navier-Stokes simulation results with the transonic wind tunnel 
test data for a NACA0012 airfoil at several angles of attack. 
  The importance of application of CFD to inverse design 
problem is also discussed. 
<H5>  1. Role of CFD in Aircraft Development </H5>
  It is no exaggeration to say that the wind-tunnel test used 
to be the only design tool available for aerodynamic design 
work. We create an artificial air flow inside the wind tunnel at 
the same velocity as during flight, we insert a small model of 
analogous shape to the actual craft, and we measure the 
pressures on the surface of the model and the other aerodynamic 
forces which operate on the model as a whole, thus obtaining the 
data necessary for the design. However, wind-tunnel tests have 
to be repeated time and time again until an airfoil shape is 
obtained which satisfies the desired performance figures. This 
requires the expenditure of enormous amounts of time and money. 
Furthermore, due to the interference caused by the wind-tunnel 
walls and model supports, and to the Reynolds number effect, it 
is very difficult to create the same conditions of air flow 
inside a wind tunnel as occur in actual flight. As was pointed 
out early on, the influence of the Reynolds number becomes 
increasingly problematic in aerodynamic design as aircraft 
become larger and faster. 
  But things have changed dramatically in the field of 
aerodynamic design in recent years with the advent of the 
supercomputer and the amazing developments in CFD (computational 
fluid dynamics). By leaving to CFD many of the things that 
previously had to be done in wind-tunnel tests in the 
aerodynamic design process, the cost and time required for model 
fabrication and wind-tunnel operations can now be drastically 
reduced. CFD is particularly well suited to parametric studies 
involving shape variation and the like. CFD is expected to play 
an increasingly large role, as compared to wind-tunnel testing, 
in the conceptual and preliminary design phases. At the current 
time, however, due to the computing times involved, almost all 
of the computer code used in design work that is 
three-dimensional is potential flow analysis code.[.sup]1[/] 
As a consequence, it is very difficult to evaluate aerodynamic 
characteristics at off-design points where viscous effects are 
prominent. So wind-tunnel tests are also required in the 
preliminary design stage. In order for Navier-Stokes code to be 
used freely as the design code in actual design work settings, 
the entire operation -- beginning with airframe shape 
definition, including grid generation and numerical computation 
of flows, and ending with the derivation of the final 
aerodynamic coefficients -- must be concluded within a single 
dat,[.sup]2[/] plus the computation time for each case for 
the same shape must be on the order of several minutes. 
Essential to achieving this will be the development of a 
numerical wind tunnel having functions for the automatic 
generation of airframe surface grids and space grids, and a 
computer with the power to process at 100 GFLOPS or faster. 
  At the stage of the main design or detailed design, after 
the 
preliminary design work has been done, CFD still has a large 
role to play. Ordinary high-subsonic-speed transport aircraft, 
such as the Boeing 747 Jumbojet, are different from fighter 
aircraft or space planes in that the surrounding flow is in a 
relatively simple condition, with either little or no 
separation. It is in this field of aerodynamic design for 
airliner airframes that CFD really shows its power. 
<H5>  2. Wind-Tunnel Tests and CFD Reliability </H5>
  In Figure 1 we have a single diagram that summarizes the 
results of testing the NACA0012 wing shape in a typical 
two-dimensional wind tunnel.[.sup]3,4[/] The shock wave 
position (distance from leading edge taking wing chord length as 
1) is plotted on the vertical axis, and the Reynolds numbers 
based on chord length on the horizontal axis. Despite the fact 
that this is a relatively simple flow under conditions of Mach 
0.8, 0 angle of attack, and wing symmetry, the position of 
the shock wave is greatly different from wind tunnel to wind 
tunnel. A number of factors may cause these differences, 
including interference between the top and bottom and left and 
right wind tunnel walls, air flow bending, error in Mach number 
setting, model fabrication errors, and measurement errors. By 
looking only at this diagram there is no way in the world for us 
to determine which data are more correct, but 
McCrosky[.sup]3[/] analyzed these wind-tunnel test data and 
predicted that the true shock wave position must be somewhere 
between the two dotted lines that are parallel to the horizontal 
axis (i.e. between 44% and 48% of the chord 
length). The data 
of Harris (NASA) -- which is considered the most reliable 
wind-tunnel data and is widely cited to demonstrate CFD 
precision -- comes in on the upper dotted line (48% line, 
corrected [square] marks), while the data from the NAL 
two-dimensional transonic wind tunnel ([bullet] marks, corrected 
for wind-tunnel wall interference)[.sup]4[/] fall in between 
the dotted lines, even though showing some variation. (Note that 
when no corrections are made ([circle], [triangle] marks), the 
shock wave is positioned considerably upstream.) 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-26A>           Figure 1. Shock Wave Position vs. Reynolds Number </FIG>



  As seen in the foregoing, it is possible to considerably 
reduce the variation between different wind tunnels by 
correcting for the wind tunnel walls, but it is utterly 
impossible to make all the data agree. Each wind tunnel has its 
own peculiarities, and it is next to impossible to eliminate 
these. Not only this, but when the same model is retested on a 
different day, there is usually some disparity between the two 
sets of data. The problem is so-called reproducibility. What 
then about CFD in this respect? The situation is absolutely the 
same. There will be as many answers as there are people making 
the computations, as there are schemes used, and as there are 
grids. The designer does not know which data can be relied upon. 
Well, at least this was the situation in the early days of CFD 
development. But CFD has developed rapidly since those early 
days, and its effectiveness is now as widely recognized as its 
limitations. When there is either very little or no separation 
in the flow, so long as we use schemes and turbulence models 
that are reliable in the foregoing examples, for instance, 
almost all of the solutions are nearly the same if the number of 
grid points is large enough. And when it comes to 
reproducibility, CFD is perfect. 
  We next turn our attention to a comparative study of CFD 
generated numerical solutions and wind-tunnel data on the 
NACA0012 airfoil. The basic equations used in the computations 
were the thin-layer-approximation Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes 
equations and, for the turbulence model, the Baldwin-Lomax 
algebraic model.[.sup]5[/] The scheme employed was the TVD 
difference method[.sup]6[/] with the Roe flux separation 
method modified for high precision by the MUSCL method. The 
computation grid adopted was the C-type grid that excels in wake 
resolution. In order to eliminate the grid point number 
dependence for the numerical solutions, when the number of grid 
points in the flow direction and in the direction perpendicular 
to the wing plane, respectively, were increased in multiples, as 
soon as the drag coefficient ceased to vary that was determined 
as the optimum grid (approximately 25,000 total grid points with 
this solver), and this was used in all of the computations. 
Moreover, unless otherwise noted, the entire flow region was 
considered to be turbulent. 
  We begin with the comparison of shock wave positions. In 
Figure 1 are noted both the computed shock wave positions for Re 
= 2.1 x 10[.sup]7[/] and 1.2 x 10[.sup]6[/] ([diamond] 
marks). The shock waves are positioned at 48.5% for high 
Re 
numbers and at 47% for low Re numbers. From these 
results, we 
think that the true position of the shock wave is somewhat 
downstream of McCrosky's prediction. We next compare the NAL 
two-dimensional wind-tunnel data, Harris data, and McDevitt data 
with the computed pressure distribution at Mach = 0.8 and Alpha 
= 0 (cf. Figure 2). The McDevitt results agree roughly with 
the computations, the Harris results have the shock wave 
position slightly shifted, and the NAL wind-tunnel data not only 
have the shock wave pushed quite a bit to the fore but exhibit 
disagreement in terms of the pressure distribution immediately 
forward of the shock wave. We believe this is either due to the 
wind-tunnel model being made incorrectly or a failure to 
completely eliminate the side-wall effects. In actuality, as is 
indicated in Figure 3, when the model fabrication precision was 
enhanced, and the tests were run again with the model's aspect 
ratio changed to 2.0, the results ([triangle] marks) agree well 
indeed with the computation results. If this be so, it would 
seem well to do all the tests with the 2.0 aspect ratio, but a 
high volume of air becomes necessary when the Reynolds number 
becomes high, and data productivity becomes extremely poor, so 
this cannot always be done. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-27A>           Figure 2. Computed Pressure Distribution and Test Pressure </FIG>






<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-27B>           Figure 3. Computed Pressure Distribution and Test Pressure </FIG>



  The comparisons so far have had to do with such localized 
phenomena on the model surface as shock wave position and 
pressure distribution. Next let us look at the drag values where 
a higher order of precision is required. In Figure 4 we have 
plotted both the NAL and the Harris test data with the Mach 
number on the horizontal axis and the coefficient of drag on the 
vertical axis. The Harris drag is large because the Reynolds 
number is low, while the drag values from the NAL wind-tunnel 
tests are lower than the values calculated with the assumption 
that there is a transition at the leading edge, but agree well 
with the values computed when the transition point is fixed at 
5%. The NAL tests were conducted with natural transitions. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-27C>           Figure 4. Mach Number vs. Drag Coefficient </FIG>






   Next we take up the issue of the reliability of the results 
given by CFD when lift is involved. In Figure 5 we compare the 
theory and the experiments for Mach = 0.777 and Alpha = 
1.536. Both agree well overall, including agreement in 
shock wave position and intensity. (In this test we used a model 
having an aspect ratio of 1.5, and the computations were done 
with the transition point fixed at 5% of the wing chord.) 
However, upon closer examination, we see that there is a 
discrepancy between the two at the root of the shock wave. (We 
have already discussed the cause of the difference in pressure 
immediately forward of the shock wave.) This is because the 
shock wave and the boundary layer interfere, so that the 
boundary layer separates at that point and forms a small bubble 
above the wing surface. The Baldwin-Lomax is said to not 
function well for separation flows such as this, and that turns 
out to be the truth, but if the flow again adheres to the wing 
surface, then the agreement between theory and experiment again 
becomes good, as is evident from Figure 5. This indicates that, 
even if there is separation, the Baldwin-Lomax model produces 
good flow approximations so long as that separation is localized 
at the root of the shock wave. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-28A>           Figure 5. Computed Pressure Distribution and Test Pressure </FIG>



  Next let us return to the comparison of aerodynamic 
coefficients. As can be seen from the drag polar curve in Figure 
6, good agreement is indicated between experiment and theory. In 
particular, the values calculated with the transition point 
fixed 5% from the leading edge coincide perfectly with 
the test 
data. We do see some variation in the vicinity of where the lift 
becomes zero, but this gives us a certain index of the 
reproducibility of the experiment or test. Every time the test 
is conducted symbol-sized differences appear, but this cannot be 
helped. We also included the Harris data ([triangle] marks) 
here, but these data are not all that pertinent because the 
Reynolds number is different and the data have not been 
corrected. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-28B>           Figure 6. Drag Coefficient vs. Lift Coefficient Curve </FIG>

  The foregoing has been a comparison between CFD and 
wind-tunnel tests with a two-dimensional airfoil. The next step 
naturally would be to do the comparison for a three-dimensional 
airfoil. Unfortunately, however, for the three-dimensional case, 
we have no available precision data which can be trusted or 
backed up by multiple wind-tunnel tests. Some of the data may 
provide surface pressure distributions but no drag or lift 
information, or if it does provide such information it is often 
very difficult to predict correct drag values due to the 
influence of model-support stings or side-wall effects. If we 
look only at the pressure distributions, it has already been 
demonstrated that the CFD results agree very well with the 
wind-tunnel tests so long as separation is small, as in the 
two-dimensional case. Next, Japan also needs to quickly play 
special three-dimensional experiments and tests for obtaining 
precision data not only on pressure distributions, but also of 
course on force data, on parasitic drag distributions and 
velocity distributions inside the boundary layer, and on wake 
structures, etc., all with the objective of verifying the CFD 
code. We would also like to see international wind-tunnel tests 
conducted in the interest of enhancing data reliability if this 
be possible. 
<H5>  3. CFD Application to Inverse Solution Method </H5>
  The discussion thus far has focused entirely on comparisons 
of CFD and wind tunnel test data. It should be noted that there 
is no difference whatever between these two methods insofar as 
they both simulate flows around given objects. Using CFD in this 
way is, of course, very important. But it should be even more 
important to employ CFD in trying to solve problems that are 
difficult or impossible with wind tunnel tests. One example of 
this is the inverse problem solving method that plays such a 
major role in wing design. An inverse problem would be to derive 
the cross-sectional shape of a wing from a given pressure or 
velocity distribution. Wind tunnels are not very amenable to 
such problems. Inverse solution methods are used in a wide 
variety of ways. They can be used, for example, 1) to pass 
isobars over a three-dimensional wing, 2) to designate lift 
distributions or moments, 3) to suppress undesirable leading 
edge peaks, 4) to weaken shock waves, 5) to prevent 
trailing-edge separation, 6) to achieve wide layer flow regions, 
etc., etc. Many different procedures have been proposed to date 
for resolving such inverse problems, but they can be roughly 
divided into the following three categories: 1) Direct methods 
in which, in principle, pressure distributions (or velocity 
distributions) are designated on boundaries, and then solutions 
that satisfy these are obtained from potential equations or from 
the Eulerian equations so as to derive the desired airfoil 
cross-sections. 2) Optimizing methods, which constitute one type 
of indirect method, in which the flow analysis code and optimum 
value problem solving code are combined, and these are used 
alternately and repeatedly, sequentially correcting the 
cross-sectional shape of the airfoil until the pressure 
remainder (difference between desired and calculated pressure 
distributions) is minimized. 3) Remainder correcting methods, 
which also constitute a type of indirect method, but in which an 
airfoil-surface correction code that is based on a shape 
approximated by means of fluid dynamic equations is used instead 
of the optimum value problem solving code. This author has 
already developed one inverse solution method[.sup]7[/] that 
belongs to this third category and which is being widely used in 
many quarters.[.sup]8,9[/]

  [Text] Abstract: With the evolution of the CFD 
technology, the role of wind tunnel has come to be re-evaluated. 
In this paper, the impact of CFD validation with wind tunnel is 
discussed. That is going to bring the needs for high accuracy of 
test data, and that will finally lead to more accurate new test 
technique, e.g., magnetic suspension, free from the mount 
interference of high RN low speed wind tunnel, actually very 
useful for the low risk aircraft development. 
  Also, wind tunnel facilities in FHI aerospace division are 
introduced. With CFD technology and test technology, FHI has the 
capability of wide range class airframe development; from low 
speed small target plane to space-vehicle. 
  As CFD becomes more and more powerful, we now must 
re-examine 
the role of wind tunnel testing and perform revalidations and 
re-evaluations. In this article we introduce the reader to some 
viewpoints of airframe manufacturers to wind tunnel tests and 
CFD. We hope this will enable the reader to better understand 
how CFD research is progressing, in connection with wind tunnel 
testing. We omit here in detailed discussion of CFD development 
and implementation as that was covered in the previous 
symposium.[.sup]1[/] 
<H5>  1. Problems Surrounding Wind Tunnel Tests and CFD </H5>
  The questions most frequently encountered in connection with 
CFD and wind tunnel testing are the following two. 


    -  Do CFD and wind tunnel testing agree? 
  -  Will wind tunnels 
be replaced by CFD? (That is, if CFD gets a lot better, will we 
cease building wind tunnels?) 

    The answer to the first question is clear, namely that CFD 
which does not agree at all (i.e. does not coincide in physical 
terms) has no technological value, nor is there a method for 
completely computing the motions of air molecules. In other 
words, the issue is the degree to which they agree. In answer to 
the second question, if CFD were "almighty" we would not need 
wind tunnels, but such a state of affairs is still far in the 
future. (Landahl, for example, says that, in terms of the 
calculations for reproducing turbulence movements in their 
entirety, where R[.sup]N[/] = 10[.sup]4[/] it would take a 
year or so, and where R[.sup]N[/] = 10[.sup]6[/] it would 
take about 100 years.[.sup]2[/]) We think that wind tunnels 
will be used for some time to come, at least in design 
verification. CFD currently is being used in design work within 
a framework of "agreeing" fairly well (i.e. with its 
effectiveness demonstrated), with wind tunnels still used in 
final verifications. However, there has at least to be some kind 
of continuity between the results of wind-tunnel tests, on the 
one hand, and CFD, on the other. So we wind up doing 
verification checks on CFD with the wind tunnel. 
<H5>  2. Verification Checks </H5>
  While it is undisputed that wind tunnel tests are physical 
phenomena, CFD is from start to finish a simulation of physical 
phenomena. Accordingly, CFD is always compared to and verified 
by wind tunnel tests, which are physical phenomena. Basically, 
when CFD is set up, specific verification checks are done due to 
so-called standard problems, but when the continuity with the 
design is considered, one ends up carrying on verification 
checks with wind tunnels that are nearby. We cannot have the 
answers agreeing with only one wind tunnel, so we wind up doing 
verification checks using data from a number of wind tunnels. 
This, of necessity, involves us in verifying one wind tunnel 
against another, and, furthermore, fully verified CFD takes on 
the property of being usable in verifying the accuracy of wind 
tunnels in a certain range. Conversely, wind tunnel test 
precision is improved during the course of CFD verification, in 
which sense we can hope that the broad-based combination of CFD 
and wind tunnel testing will result in advances in aerodynamic 
design technology. 
<H5>  3. Wind Tunnel Test Reliability </H5>
  In Table 1 we represent categorical reasons for attributing 
reliability to wind tunnel test data. We think that the concept 
of "seeming to be reliable" probably comes from the "fact that 
many tests are conducted," which is listed last. We get a sense 
of all being well that does not necessarily agree with the 
physical exactitude because of a number of things, such as that 
we are somehow or other able to design aircraft after conducting 
many tests, that we can appreciate the continuities with other 
wind tunnels and understand the comparisons with various and 
sundry derived values, and that we obtain data which can be 
physically interpreted, etc. However, when it comes to 
comparison/verification checks on CFD data, physical exactitude 
is in fact demanded, and we come face to face with the problems 
which wind tunnels naturally have. Typical problems are 
illustrated in Figure 1, for none of which have we found 
determinative solutions with Japanese wind tunnels. We cannot 
disregard these problems when we come to consider CFD 
verification checking. We will now discuss each one briefly.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-30A>             Figure 1. Wind Tunnel Problems </FIG>

  i) Wind Tunnel Wall Interference 
  This is particularly pronounced in two-dimensional wind 
tunnels. In Figure 2 we illustrate a practical wall-interference 
compensation (angle-of-attack compensation) which we use. Using 
the relationship whereby the change in angle of attack 
_D__a_ is 
directly proportional to C[.sup]l[/], we obtain 
the compensation value by comparing the change in pressure 
integral drag to C[.sup]l[/] with the change in 
the wake survey values. If the ratio between chord and wind 
tunnel wall height is made small, the interference amount can be 
reduced, but we need a correction in the angle of attack of 
something like 0.6 with C[.sup]l[/] = 1 even 
when the ratio is 1:10, which is not a quantity which can be 
disregarded. There is also the effect of the side-wall boundary 
layer, and we have to incorporate computations which include the 
wall model when conducting exact verifications. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-31A>           Figure 2. Wall Interference in Two-Dimensional Wind-Tunnel Tests </FIG>


  ii) Support Interference 
  Whenever wind tunnel tests are planned, one must always face 
the issue of how to support the model. Taking the case of a 
space shuttle vehicle, diagrammed in Figure 3, the drag of the 
base has a strong effect on the total aircraft lift/drag ratio. 
However, since the base pressure (base drag) is very different 
depending on whether a top support or back support is used, it 
is important to conduct final free-flight verifications. In 
research on aft fuselage flows, the method of supporting both 
main wingtips is sometimes employed (Figure 4), that does not 
mean that it is possible to eliminate the interference which 
develops between the main wing and the walls at both tips. 
Expectations are high for magnetic suspension technology in wind 
tunnels, but it will no doubt require computations with models 
which include supporting members in conducting the comparisons 
of exacting wind tunnel tests and computations before that 
technology becomes widely used. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-31B>           Figure 3. Support Interference Effects on Base Support </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-32A>           Figure 4. Measuring Aft Flows, Example of Results </FIG>



  The RN effect, as is well known, is particularly pronounced 
in flows which include subsonic C[.sup]Lmax[/] 
separation, etc., and the impact on airline design is great. In 
ordinary wind tunnels, however, due to inadequate RN, it is not 
possible to determine the stall characteristics and 
C[.sup]Lmax[/] well, which brings an element of 
risk into the flight tests. In order to verify the effectiveness 
of CFD in aircraft design, it will probably be necessary to 
verify the continuity between actual flight level RN and 
ordinary wind tunnel level RN, but we have no wind tunnels in 
Japan with such high RN. From the perspective of the 
manufacturer, who must fly the actual aircraft, innovative 
experimental techniques are employed to make up for this RN 
insufficiency. Here at FHI, since the development of the T-1, we 
employ a turbulence grid which artificially increases turbulence 
and simulates separation conditions at high RN (cf. Figure 5). 
As shown in Figure 6, in the case of a straight wing aircraft, 
the lateral instability at stall demonstrated without the 
turbulence grid disappears when the turbulence grid is attached, 
so that we can predict low risk during flight tests. However, 
with a swept-wing craft, the lateral instability at stall does 
not disappear even when the turbulence grid is used, and we find 
out that some kind of device like a fence is necessary. 
Nevertheless, this kind of technique is an expedient, and in the 
future we will need to have high-RN low-speed wind tunnels for 
higher-precision development. Also, we do not believe that CFD 
can adequately function in this area at present, and we must 
await further research.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-33B>           Figure 6. RN Effect and Leading-Edge Device </FIG>


  We can summarize much of what was said above on CFD 
verification as in Table 2. The strict comparison of 
two-dimensional chords and two-dimensional wind tunnel tests 
contains nonsensical elements somewhere, but "two dimension" is 
useful taking design concepts from two dimensions to three 
dimensions, and we believe the verification is meaningful in 
terms of grasping the correlation between 2D CFD and wind tunnel 
tests and determining the scope of effectiveness.

<H5>  4. Wind Tunnel Tests at FHI </H5>
  The current status of CFD was treated in the previous 
symposium,[.sup]1[/] but we now discuss briefly the wind 
tunnel testing capabilities of Fuji Heavy Industries. We hope 
that this, and the previous treatment, will give a better 
understanding of "wind tunnels and CFD at FHI." 
  FHI currently operates six types of wind tunnel and water 
tank facilities with which we can conduct various kinds of tests 
from low speeds to Mach 4. We believe that we need, at minimum, 
the equipment to allow us to perfect basic airframe designs in 
house (cf. Table 3). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-34A>           Table 3. FHI Wind Tunnels </FIG>

  i) With the high-speed wind tunnel (Figure 7 [not 
reproduced]) we can conduct tests from M = 0.2 to 4, with the 
measurement section measuring 0.61 meters square. Full-craft 
six-component tests and various other tests are performed (cf. 
Figure 4). Since this is a suction type of wind tunnel, there is 
little turbulence, maintenance is simple, and the operating rate 
is high. Over an 11-year period we have conducted some 15,000 
blows with this facility. 
  ii) The low-speed wind tunnel (Figure 8) measures 2 m x 2 m, 
has a normal speed of 50 m/s and a maximum speed of 
approximately 80 m/s. This facility is used in full-craft shape 
force and pressure tests, flutter tests, object dropping tests, 
ground effect tests, and rotor tests. This wind tunnel is very 
compact for its capabilities. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-34B>           Figure 8. Exterior View of Low-Speed Wind Tunnel </FIG>

  iii) The smoke wind tunnel (Figure 9) has a 0.2 m x 2 m 
measurement section and uses smoke for flow-line observation. It 
also features three-component, pressure measurements at wind 
speeds up to 40 m/s, and is useful in the development of 
airfoils for use at low RN.[.sup]3[/] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-35A>           Figure 9. Exterior View of Smoke Wind Tunnel </FIG>

  iv) The simplified wind tunnel (Figure 10) has a measurement 
section that is 0.6 m x 0.6 m and is used in visual 3D tests at 
wind speeds up to 15 m/s. It is useful in tests in which lasers 
are used to make eddies visible. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-36A>           Figure 10. Exterior View of Simplified Wind Tunnel </FIG>

  v) The shallow-bottom water tank (Figure 11) simulates flows 
of up to M = 5 in a thin water tank. It is useful in 
quantitative pressure measurements as well as in intuitively 
understanding the behavior of supersonic and hypersonic 
intakes.[.sup]4[/] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-36B>           Figure 11. Exterior View of Shallow-Bottom Water Tank </FIG>

  vi) The visualizing water tank (Figure 12) has a 0.4 m x 0.6 
m measurement section and uses water flows of 50 cm to 50 cm/s 
[sic]. It is useful in making the 3D eddy sites around the 
object visible. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-37A>           Figure 12. Exterior View of Visualizing Water Tank </FIG>

  Thus we have various kinds of wind tunnel facilities. As for 
a large-scale wind tunnel such as is needed for highly precise 
development work, however, we must look to the installation of 
facilities such as the aforementioned high-RN low-speed wind 
tunnel in public institutions.

Association and to the National Space Development Agency.

  [Text] Abstract: At Kawasaki Gifu, the wind 
tunnel tests and CFD technologies have been mostly developed 
since the beginning of 1970. 3D transonic wind tunnel test with 
1 m x 1 m test section and 3D Navier-Stokes Analysis are now 
available in the design work for many airplanes. For example, 
some airplanes (STOL, T-4, etc.) and helicopters (BK117, etc.) 
were developed by using these useful technologies. 
  This report presents the current status of these 
technologies 
in Kawasaki Gifu and the future roles respectively. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Serious wind tunnel testing and CFD work related to 
aerospace 
got underway at Kawasaki Heavy Industries Gifu at about the same 
time, namely in the late 1960's. Currently this work has 
progressed to a three-dimensional transonic wind tunnel and 
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes CFD analysis. 
  During this time, we have made wind tunnel tests and CFD the 
two pillars of aerodynamic design, and have employed the two 
methods in various kinds of R&amp;D and aircraft development 
(modification and new designs), particularly with experimental 
STOL aircraft, the T-4 jet trainer, and the BK117 helicopter. We 
obtained the initially targeted performance, and confirmed that 
the technology is effective. 
  In this article we discuss the wind tunnel and CFD 
activities 
at Kawasaki Gifu and look at prospects for the future. 
<H5>  2. Kawasaki Wind Tunnel Tests </H5>
  The history of wind tunnel activities at the Gifu facility 
are diagrammed in Figure 1. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-38A>           Figure 1. Kawasaki Gifu Wind Tunnel Development </FIG>

  Serious wind tunnel testing got underway in 1968 with the 
rebuilding and remodeling of the low-speed wind tunnel 
originally built in 1938. This wind tunnel facilitates both open 
and closed tests, with the closed configuration being usually 
employed in helicopter tests for rotor blow-down effect tests 
and the like. Subsequently, the two-dimensional smoke wind 
tunnel was brought on line in 1969 and the two-dimensional 
transonic wind tunnel in 1976. The smoke wind tunnel can readily 
capture flow phenomena, including separation flows, and can now 
handle force measurements also with the incorporation of a 
three-component balance scale. The two-dimensional transonic 
wind tunnel is used primarily in studies of airfoil aerodynamic 
characteristics, and was put to good use in designing the T-4 
airfoils. The three-dimensional transonic wind tunnel was built 
in 1988 and can be used in a wide range of wind tunnel tests 
from low speed to transonic speed. This wind tunnel has a 1 m x 
1 m measurement section, and was designed to share in common the 
models, stings, and measurement equipment with the supersonic 
wind tunnel of the same size at NAL. By using this wind tunnel 
in conjunction with the NAL supersonic wind tunnel, tests can be 
conducted continuously over a broad velocity spread, from low to 
high Mach speeds. The manifold pressure can be raised to 5 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/], so, for a three-dimensional wind tunnel, 
this provides the highest Re numbers obtainable in Japan. The 
wind-tunnel features are summarized in Table 1. 
  Table 1. Kawasaki Gifu Wind Tunnels 
  -- Low-Speed Wind Tunnel: Built 1938, rebuilt and remodeled 
1968 (Open type); Measurement section: 2.5 m x 2.5 m; Maximum

m; Maximum velocity: 30 m/s

1.0 m; Mach number: 0.2 to 1.4; Max. confluence pressure: 5 
atmospheres; Re number: 2 x 10[.sup]7[/]; (H = 0.8, C = 0.3M) 
  During this period, when broader-region wind tunnel tests 
needed to be conducted, we used the various NAL wind tunnels and 
foreign wind tunnels (RAE, NAE, CALAC, etc.), and worked hard to 
raise the level of our wind tunnel testing technology. 
<H5>  3. CFD at Kawasaki Gifu </H5>
  Kawasaki develops its basic aerospace software at the Gifu 
factory, and from that base also develops application software 
(for thermal flow analysis and blade/wing lattice/cascade 
analysis, etc.) in various fields for other divisions. 
  When CFD is used in computer-based aerodynamic analysis and 
design, we can divide it into the sequential problem analysis in 
which flows around a shape are analyzed, and inverse problem 
analysis in which a design condition such as a pressure 
distribution is given and the shape is then derived. We will 
discuss these two approaches while focusing on developments and 
applications in the aerospace field. 
<H5>  3.1 Sequential Problem Analysis </H5>
  Sequential problem analysis came through lift line theory 
analysis and began with the two-dimensional panel analysis in 
1970, about the same time that we at Kawasaki rebuilt the 
low-speed wind tunnel. It subsequently passed through the 
development of total-craft panel analysis, three-dimensional 
full potential flow analysis, total-craft Eulerian analysis, and 
full-total-craft Navier-Stokes analysis to the present stage of 
obtaining equilibrium flow analysis for ultrasonic flows (cf. 
Figure 2). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-39A>           Figure 2. Development of Sequential Problem Analysis </FIG>

  As to the individual analyses, precision verification checks 
are performed, depending on the correspondences and so forth 
with the theoretical values and wind-tunnel test results, even 
after development, and improvements are still being made in 
expanding analysis software features, enhancing precision, and 
I/O data processing. 
  We now noted some representative analysis results. We omit 
here any treatment of equilibrium flows because this is given 
detailed treatment in Reference 9. 
  The panel method is based on non-viscous theory, but viscous 
effects can be considered too with the addition of a boundary 
layer. It is also possible to simulate separation flows by 
releasing eddies that satisfy the kutta conditions 
for each time step as diagrammed in Figure 3. In Figure 4 we 
have the development to jet flap analysis with the addition of 
aft jet flows, which is employed in the aerodynamic analysis of 
STOL aircraft. The panel method, while based on non-viscous 
theory, exhibits good correspondences with wind tunnel tests in 
regions where there is little separation. Accordingly, although 
the precision is less than with the differential method, the 
panel method requires less time for computation and input data 
preparation, and we believe it is still an effective design tool 
in parametric studies.[.sup]1[/]

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-39C>           Figure 4. Example of Jet Flap Lift Area Theory Analysis </FIG>

  In Figures 5 through 7 we give typical examples of 
comparisons between wind tunnel test results and the results of 
Navier-Stokes (NS) analysis based on the differential and 
limited volume methods. With these methods, it is possible to 
conduct analyses over a wide range, from low to high Mach 
numbers, including viscosity. In Figure 5 we compare the 
calculations and tests on the ONERA M6 wing for the purpose of 
verifying the precision of three-dimensional NS analysis. Good 
agreement is exhibited, including the position of the shock wave. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-40A>           Figure 5. ONERA M6 NS Analysis </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-40B>           Figure 6. Supersonic Intake NS Analysis Examples </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-40C>           Figure 7. Vehicle Ground Effect NS Analysis Example </FIG>

  In Figure 6 we show an example of the vent effect of a ramp 
and throat in a supersonic intake. An example of ground effect 
analysis is depicted in Figure 7 for a vehicle that incorporates 
a guideway. There is correspondence with the wind tunnel tests 
in the upper part of the diagram (with the guideway and ground 
moving together with the vehicle), while the lower part of the 
diagram corresponds with an actual vehicle (with the guideway 
and ground fixed, and only the vehicle moving). We see 
differences in separation and force between these two, and thus 
find that care must be exercised in handling the wind tunnel 
test data when inferring actual vehicle characteristics from the 
wind tunnel test results. 
  We recently have been conducting studies on STOL craft, the 
HOPE, and the SST, as well as elemental analytical studies on 
flap gap effects.[.sup]2-7[/] 
  Thus we see that, thanks to the development of software for 
the total-craft Euler method and total-craft NS method, the 
analytical capabilities have advanced far beyond those of the 
panel method. For this reason, we are now able to conduct fine 
flow studies and do simulations in modes that are not 
practicable with wind tunnels, although there is still the 
problem of precision when large separation is involved. 
  Even with the advances in computers, much time is required 
from input data preparation to the finished analysis (so-called 
TAT time) (although we believe that two-dimensional analysis has 
now reached that level), and these problems need to be resolved 
before this method can be used in the design stage. 
<H5>  3.2 Inverse Problem Analysis </H5>
  In design work in which wind tunnel tests and CFD sequential 
problem solving is used, shape modifications and aerodynamic 
analyses are often repeated. With this approach, however, there 
is no guarantee that the design goals will be reached, and a 
great deal of time is required to obtain convergent solutions. 
  For this reason, an indispensable tool for us designers is 
inverse problem analysis in which shapes are sought for given 
design target values. 
  In the area of inverse problem analysis for airfoils, the 
methods of Sumiya and Wever have been around for some time. We 
at Kawasaki, however, were interested in inverse problem 
analysis for more general cases of high-lift devices, and so 
first developed a two-dimensional multiple-object inverse 
problem analysis technique based on the panel method, as 
diagrammed in Figure 8, and then brought in viscous effects by 
adding the boundary layer. Subsequently, based on this, we 
developed three-dimensional airfoil inverse problem analysis 
techniques which we use in designing main wings, inclusive of 
fuselage effects, and flaps (cf. Figure 9). For the SST wing 
design we developed inverse problem analysis techniques based on 
lift area supersonic theory. We also have improved design 
precision by employing Navier-Stokes inverse problem analysis in 
which the method of Takanashi is used. The example shown in 
Figure 10 is that of the design of a main wing which includes 
the USB engine.[.sup]8[/]

<H5>  4. Wind-Tunnel Tests and CFD </H5>
  In Table 2 we compare wind-tunnel tests and CFD in terms of 
various problematic categories. 
  Table 2. Wind-Tunnel Tests (WTT) and CFD 
  -- Reynolds number, Mach number: WTT: Limited (especially 
Reynolds number); CFD: Precision is problematic, but yields 
solutions that correspond to Re numbers, Mach numbers of actual 
craft 
  -- Flow Simulation (separation flows): WTT: Can obtain 
actual 
flows (yields solutions that include stall); CFD: Limited with 
respect to physical model (analysis comprehending large 
separation is very difficult) 
  -- Interference Problems (air flow turbulence): WTT: 
Wind-tunnel tests are very difficult; CFD: Can obtain ideal 
solutions 
  -- Preprocessing: WTT: Model design and fabrication is 
costly 
and requires many days to do; CFD: Low cost, but grid 
generation, etc., is time-consuming -- Productivity: WTT: High 
productivity; CFD: High productivity if panel method; low 
productivity if differential method or limited volume method 
  -- Reproducibility: WTT: Depends on model precision, 
configuration set[tings], and wind tunnel wall correction 
method, etc.; CFD: Depends on physical model, grid(s), etc. 
  -- Effects on Design: WTT: Requires trial and error 
repetitions; CFD: Can improve design program and shorten times 
using design code (inverse problem analysis) 
  With wind tunnel tests one cannot obtain real craft Re 
numbers, but one can obtain real flows that include separation, 
and productivity is high compared to CFD. 
  With CFD, on the other hand, there are still problems with 
analyzing large separation flows and with data productivity, but 
there are no restrictions which wind tunnels have (support/wall 
interference, ground effect, etc.), and one can obtain solutions 
in a form close to actual flight conditions. But with wind 
tunnel testing one can easily ascertain fine flow details, such 
as is necessary with sophisticated design technology and 
instruments. 
  We believe that the trend toward CFD is very pronounced, and 
that an increasingly large role will be played by CFD in more 
and more areas, including aerodynamic design. In the near 
future, however, wind tunnel and CFD precision will continue to 
be cross-checked, CFD will be used in analyzing phenomena which 
arise in wind tunnels, and the two approaches will continue to 
coexist. It is therefore desirable that there be close 
communication between technicians employing these two methods, 
in complementary ways, in the future. Designers need to be 
cognizant, at every design phase, of the relative merits of the 
two technologies in terms of such things as productivity, 
applicability, precision, and cost, so as to be able to make the 
most effective use of both. In particular, in the interest of 
making designs with good precision, we must thoroughly 
understand the degrees of approximation and simulation which CFD 
provides, so as to appreciate the scope of applicability. 
<H5>  5. Concluding Remarks </H5>
  The biggest problem with wind tunnel tests is the failure to 
achieve actual aircraft Re numbers with wind tunnel Re numbers. 
For this reason, in order to grasp actual craft characteristics, 
one must rely on Re number extrapolations, with which accurate 
estimates are very difficult. This being so, as can be seen in 
Boeing's keen interest in building a high-Re number wind tunnel, 
we believe that the demand for wind tunnels providing Re numbers 
near those of actual aircraft will continue. 
  On the other hand, there are still problems with CFD 
sequential problem analysis, such as the ability to analyze 
flows which include large separation, the long TAT times, and 
solution reproducibility. We now need to re-evaluate turbulence 
models, shorten preprocessing times using non-structural grid 
techniques, and study dependencies using grids. 
  We are working in the area of non-structural grid 
techniques, 
having perfected software for two-dimensional NS analysis and 
working on the application of this to three-dimensional NS 
analysis. 
  Furthermore, by improving CFD inverse problem analysis 
techniques, it has become possible to make design work more 
effective and more highly precise. In order to make possible 
dramatic design breakthroughs, however, we also think that the 
design goals and pressure distributions, etc., determined on the 
basis of conventional designer experience and know-how, need to 
be theoretically studied, as is seen in the optimized pressure 
distribution.[.sup]10[/]

  [Text] Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics 
(CFD) has established its unique position as a design tool in 
aerospace industries. As the CFD technology has evolved, the 
relationship with the conventional design tool of wind tunnel 
testing has also changed accordingly. This paper reviews the 
relationship of the two major technologies in Mitsubishi Nagoya. 
The typical CFD application is briefly introduced during the 
discussion. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The utility of CFD technology in the aerodynamic design of 
aerospace equipment began to make rapid strides in the 1980s. 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), at its Nagoya Aerospace 
Systems (NAS) facility, has also been working hard on CFD R&amp;D 
and now considers it an important aerodynamic design tool 
alongside of wind tunnel testing. In this article we trace the 
development of CFD at Mitsubishi NAS, giving specific examples 
and focusing on how its relationship with wind tunnel testing 
has changed. We also discuss the significance of these two 
technologies to designers engaged in aerodynamic design work, 
and look ahead to the future of the technology. 
<H5>  2. Changes in CFD and Wind Tunnel Testing </H5>
  Advances in CFD applications in the aerospace field were 
tremendous in the 1980s, and CFD has now developed into an 
indispensable aerodynamic design tool that ranks alongside 
conventional wind tunnel testing. As CFD technology has 
developed, naturally its relationship to wind tunnel testing has 
changed (cf. Figure 1). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-43A>           Figure 1. Changes in Relationship Between CFD Technology </FIG>

  In the early 1980s, when we began to see the possibilities 
for CFD applications, it was being said that CFD was a 
"substitute" for wind tunnel testing. At that point in time, 
that being focused on in CFD technology were the 
analytical functions, as was the case with wind 
tunnel tests, which put CFD in a competitive relationship with 
wind tunnel testing. Subsequently, with the unforeseen 
improvements in supercomputer speeds and CFD technological 
advances, it became possible to handle Navier-Stokes inverse 
solution computations, and after the mid-1980s it was the 
design functions of CFD which came into focus. These 
were absolutely new functions which are not available in 
conventional wind tunnel testing, and in that sense CFD 
technology transcended wind tunnel testing. Then in the late 
1980s the quality of CFD technology began to be questioned, 
which led to careful comparative studies between CFD and wind 
tunnel tests. As a result, there is now emphasis on the 
complementary functions realized by organically 
combining the two technologies. 
  Beginning in the next section, we introduce the reader to 
some typical examples of CFD applications at Mitsubishi NAS, and 
retrace the changes in the relationship between CFD and wind 
tunnel testing. 
<H5>  3. Competition (Analytical Functions) </H5>
  In terms of aerodynamic analytical functions for determining 
aerodynamic characteristics for a given shape, there is no 
essential difference between wind tunnel testing and CFD. 
However, in the field of aerodynamic design, these two 
technologies are clearly differentiated in their use. CFD is 
superior to wind tunnel testing in terms of its greater speed 
and its greater flexibility. 
  Compared to the task of designing and fabricating models and 
then conducting wind tunnel tests, the time involved in 
generating CFD meshes is extremely short. For this reason, CFD 
has great merit in being able to immediately reflect the results 
of aerodynamic performance evaluations in shape designing. And 
unlike wind tunnel tests, where the test conditions are limited 
by the capabilities of ground-based equipment, CFD technology in 
principle poses no restrictions on the evaluation conditions, so 
that aerodynamic performance evaluations can be conducted in 
regions that cannot be simulated with a ground-based facility. 
In Figure 2 a pressure distribution is depicted for HOPE 
re-entry conditions. This kind of function is particularly 
appreciated in the development of such space shuttle 
vehicles.[.sup]1[/] In Figure 3 [not reproduced] is displayed 
a pressure distribution around the blades of an advanced 
turbopropeller (ATP). Obtaining this kind of detailed data for a 
turning object from wind tunnel tests is extremely 
difficult.[.sup]2[/] 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-44A>           Figure 2. HOPE Pressure Distribution (M = 15, _a_ - </FIG>

  In the area of "analytical functions," where it is 
essentially no different from wind tunnel testing, there are 
still many respects in which CFD takes a back seat to wind 
tunnel testing. Take the cost angle, for instance. For some 
shapes, where many data points are required, wind tunnel testing 
holds the advantage. And in the area of precision, beginning 
with turbulence models, some aspects of CFD are still unknown. 
And there is a tremendous difference in terms of track record. 
In the field of aerospace equipment development, for example, 
where very high reliability is demanded, nothing has ever flown 
yet with only CFD. 
<H5>  4. Superiority (Design Functions) </H5>
  CFD design functions perform processes which are exactly the 
reverse of the analytical functions, and here we can expect 
little help from wind tunnel testing. The ability to derive a 
geometrical shape given a pressure field, in what is called 
inverse solving, is extremely important to the aerodynamic 
designer. Recently it became possible to perform Navier-Stokes 
reverse solutions, and the field of applications has spread. To 
the aerodynamic designer who must design "flows," it is a 
tremendous advantage to have the "directness" of being able to 
designate not shapes, but pressure distributions. 
  In Figure 4 is depicted a full-craft pressure distribution 
for a transonic civilian aircraft.[.sup]3[/] The 
high-Reynolds number main wing that is employed in the latest 
airframes represents the positive application of the Reynolds 
number effect -- which used to be difficult to estimate in many 
cases -- so as to achieve high drag-divergence Mach numbers. The 
technology for these new wings would not be possible without the 
high-precision reverse solution method of CFD technology. In 
Figure 5 is depicted an example of applying the Navier-Stokes 
reverse solution method.[.sup]4[/] The HOPE main wing has a 
complex flow field that is surrounded by the fuselage and chip 
fins, so its design required a tool for precisely estimating the 
positions and conditions of the shock wave and separation, 
particularly at transonic speed. By employing the Navier-Stokes 
reverse solution method, it became possible to make extremely 
high-precision designs in a short time. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-44B>           Figure 4. Full-Craft Pressure Distribution for Transonic </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-44C>           Figure 5. HOPE Main Wing Reverse Solution Design (M = </FIG>

<H5>  5. Complementing (Organic Merging) </H5>
  It is impossible [sic] to verify the precision of CFD 
computations by doing careful correspondence studies with wind 
tunnel test data. Out of the process of carefully comparing the 
two kinds of simulation results, we derive "organic merging" 
with which it is possible to make aerodynamic performance 
evaluations at higher dimensions by mutually making up for each 
method's shortcomings. 
  In Figure 6 we have a pressure distribution for a 
swept-forward wing. With a swept-forward wing, due to the 
structural divergence characteristics, the deformations that 
result from static aeroelasticity, even in a wind tunnel model, 
cannot be disregarded.[.sup]5[/] For this reason, we combine 
CFD and structural analysis to estimate the flexure in the model 
beforehand, and then actually fabricate the model in a deformed 
condition so that it forms the aerodynamic shape designed at the 
design points in the wind tunnel tests. This enables us to 
verify high-precision aerodynamic characteristics in a way that 
could not be done with either CFD or wind tunnel testing alone. 
In Figure 7 [not reproduced] are depicted the results of 
two-dimensional wind tunnel side-wall analysis.[.sup]6[/] In 
two-dimensional wind tunnels, particularly in developing 
transonic airfoils with high Reynolds numbers, it is not 
possible to use models with high aspect ratios due to 
limitations in model structural strength, so the side-wall 
effect becomes too large to be disregarded. For this reason, we 
employ CFD to analyze the side-wall effect in a two-dimensional 
wind tunnel, then apply corrections to the wind tunnel test 
results, and thus perform high-precision performance evaluations 
on transonic airfoils with high Reynolds numbers. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-45A>           Figure 6. Forward Swept Wing Pressure Distribution (M = </FIG>


  Now that CFD technology and wind tunnel testing have reached 
the mutually complementary stage, from the aerodynamic 
designer's perspective the situation becomes as diagrammed in 
Figure 8. Wind tunnel tests provide CFD technology with a steady 
stream of verification data for enhanced precision, while CFD 
provides wind tunnel testing with images of flow-site phenomena 
inside the wind tunnel which is very difficult to see in a 
conventional wind tunnel test. The designer continually learns 
physics from the wind tunnel tests while learning how to narrow 
his focus on the points which should be looked at in terms of 
designing and testing. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-45B>           Figure 8. Two Design Tools </FIG>

<H5>  6. Summary </H5>
  Amazing progress is being made in CFD technology at 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Nagoya Aerospace Systems facility. 
In conjunction with these advances, the relationship between CFD 
and wind tunnel testing is changing. Aerodynamic designers 
should now be able to effectively use these two tools in a 
mutually complementary way to design higher-performance 
aerodynamic shapes.

  [Text] Abstract: When aero-engines are 
developed, several different types of wind tunnel tests are 
involved. For instance, one type of tunnel is required for 
fundamental tests of the cascades; a second is required for high 
altitude engine performance tests. Experimental models for these 
tests consist of real engine components or of close replicas. 
Certain effects may not be adequately addressed in wind tunnel 
tests, for example, the effects of high speed revolution, flow 
properties in unmeasureable regions, realistic boundary 
conditions. 
  The twofold object of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for 
internal flows is to predict the performance of models before 
expensive wind tunnel tests are done and to provide information 
of the internal flow that is inaccessible to experiment 
measurement. CFD is already useful for improving designs or 
making new ones. As computers and CFD technology advance, CFD 
can expand from the role of prediction and design to that of a 
numerical wind tunnel. This paper shows how features of 
numerical wind tunnels parallel those of experimental wind 
tunnels. The paper also assesses future trends for the use of 
numerical wind tunnels. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Wind tunnel testing in aircraft engines involves widely 
diverse configurational elements, wind tunnel scale, and 
computation volumes, from the basic turbine and compressor blade 
cascade tests to the high-altitude performance tests of the 
complete engine in the wind tunnel. Usually wind tunnel tests 
and CFD are used together in blade cascade tests and duct tests, 
but the scope has broadened in recent years with the phenomenal 
advances made in computers and analytical techniques. We here 
look at the different wind tunnel tests used on aircraft engines 
and discuss how CFD fits into the picture. 
<H5>  2. Wind Tunnel Testing of Aircraft Engines </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Types of Wind Tunnel Tests </H5>
  As diagrammed in Figure 2-1, the wind tunnel tests used on 
aircraft engines include high-altitude performance tests (Figure 
2-2) to determine overall engine performance, ground performance 
tests (Figure 2-3 [photo not reproduced]), element tests on 
fans, compressors, combustors, and turbines (Figure 2-4), and 
configurational element tests such as blade cascade tests and 
strut tests. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-46A>           Figure 2-1. Wind Tunnel Tests </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-47A>           Figure 2-2. High-Altitude Performance Test Facilities </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-48A>           Figure 2-4. Fan Element Test Apparatus </FIG>

  Then these configurational element problems are further 
divided for investigation into wingtip clearance tests, cooling 
hole effect tests, and the like, and we also do basic testing on 
aft surface step flows and shear flows, etc., in analyzing basic 
internal flows. 
  The ultimate purpose of wind tunnel testing is to improve 
the 
performance of the whole engine. For this reason it is not 
enough for these tests merely to be reliable. There must also be 
a structural rationale to the entire series of tests, and they 
must also match the development resources and time allowed. 
<H5>  2.2 Correspondence With CFD </H5>
  Compared to the wind tunnel test facility, which ranges 
widely in size, the test sample [i.e. model] is almost always 
made of the same material and in the same shape to withstand 
high speeds, high temperatures, and high pressures. Because this 
is so, it is more important that there be an equivalency between 
the actual craft's operating conditions and the wind tunnel 
tests than that of the actual craft and the test sample be 
similar in the flight tests and wind tunnel tests. The issue of 
equivalency in wind tunnel tests includes such things as 
similarity in the supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnel tests, 
and in the environmental impact tests for noise and 
NO[.sup]x[/] generation and propagation. However, if we limit 
the problems to the flows inside the engine, then the issue of 
the degree to which the wind tunnel inlet/outlet and side walls 
coincide with the actual operating conditions becomes very 
important. Even when we break the whole engine down into element 
tests, blade cascade tests, and basic tests, setting the test 
conditions is still a very important issue. When we consider the 
correspondence with CFD, we try to achieve correspondence 
primarily in element tests and blade cascade tests, depending on 
the scale of the computer and test equipment, and the time 
allowed for the wind tunnel tests, and we are working very hard 
to improve the precision with which we set the boundary 
conditions. 
<H5>  3. Roles of Wind Tunnel Tests and CFD </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Role of CFD </H5>
  We have simplified the engine design and fabrication 
processes in Figure 3-1, and attempted the following broad 
classification of the role CFD plays in research and 
development, design, and verification. 
  1) Prediction of R&amp;D results; prediction of problems, 
possibilities prior to design, testing 
  2) New design, modification design; designing by adding CFD 
technology -- which analyzes important design points with 
suitable means in the limited time allotted -- to conventional 
means 
  3) Numerical/mathematical wind tunnel testing; narrowing the 
focus of wind tunnel tests and substituting for wind tunnel tests 
  The object of analysis will vary with the size of the 
computer, the reliability of the analysis, the time allotted, 
and the costs allowable; and we think it will take on the same 
type structure as the wind tunnel tests described above. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-48B>           Figure 3-1. Role of CFD </FIG>

<H5>  3.2 Predicting R&amp;D Results </H5>
  In Figure 3-2 we have diagrammed the prediction of R&amp;D 
problems and possibilities by wind tunnel testing and CFD. With 
correspondence to wind tunnel tests, CFD is being used to verify 
the presence or absence of separation in flows generated by 
simple blade cascades, and in elucidating pronounced flows which 
interfere complexly in internal flows, with the number of 
subject elements increased, so as to match the subject elements 
of wind tunnel testing in terms of everything from predicting 
two-dimensional flow effects to inter-blade interference and 
dynamic and static blade interference analysis. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-49A>           Figure 3-2. Prediction of Problems, Possibilities </FIG>

  In Figures 3-3 and 3-4 [not reproduced] we exhibit the 
analysis grid and analysis results for flows around fan outlet 
guide blades and struts. The guide blades do not have a uniform 
shape, and the strut shapes are each different too, so analysis 
is done all around the circumference, and relatively good 
agreement with the experimental values is obtained in the 
pressure distribution at issue, even though this is non-viscous. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-49B>           Figure 3-3. Grid for Fan Outlet Guide Blade and Strut Flow Analysis </FIG>

  In Figure 3-5 we add flow velocity vectors by analyzing the 
flows inside the combustor liner. This is a useful tool for 
studying the flow of cold air inside the combustor. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-49C>           Figure 3-5. Flow Velocity Vectors Inside Combustor Liner </FIG>

  We believe that increasingly more importance will be 
attached 
to predicting the performance of these shapes, that are 
extremely close to the experimental configurations, prior to 
actual testing. 
<H5>  3.3 New Designs, Modification Designs </H5>
  In new design and modification design work, one basically 
uses analysis techniques which are thoroughly verified by 
comparison with wind tunnel tests. 
  In Figures 3-6 and 3-7 we diagram the results of CFD and L2F 
measurements on moving fan blades, and in Figure 3-8 we compare 
the tests on static fan blades. We now see relatively good 
agreement in terms of performance at design points, even in 
cases of reverse pressure gradients as in fans and compressor 
blade cascades. In Figure 3-9 we show a comparison in the case 
where the injection angle is varied, inclusive of non-design 
points. We believe that this has become useful in estimating 
qualitative trends, particularly injection angle limitations. In 
Figure 3-10 we give an example where these were used in a 
modification design, and in Figure 3-11 a comparison with wind 
tunnel test results. By these means we can verify the propriety 
of both our predictions and our modification designs. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-50A>           Figure 3-6. Comparison of L2F Measurement Results and </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-50B>           Figure 3-7. Comparison of L2F Measurement Results and Numerical Analysis Results </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-51A>           Figure 3-8. Comparison of Static Fan Blade Analysis Results and Experimental Results </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-51B>           Figure 3-9. Variation in Flow-Out Angle and Pressure Loss When Varying Injection Angle </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-52A>           Figure 3-10. Comparison of Oil Flow Patterns in Modification Design </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-52B>           Figure 3-11. Modified Design Wing Aerodynamic Performance Characteristics Comparison </FIG>


  What is urgently needed now is the development of techniques 
for analyzing blade cascades which involve secondary flows in 
reverse pressure gradients. 
<H5>  3.4 Numerical Wind Tunnel Tests </H5>
  We now need numerical wind tunnel tests which will be nearly 
as reliable as, and serve in part as substitutes for, 
conventional wind tunnel tests. To create such numerical wind 
tunnel tests, we must perform more of the verification checks 
discussed earlier, do detailed studies on turbulence models and 
schemes, and improve our measurement techniques. This will 
require us to cooperate widely with other research institutions, 
as we do with basic wind tunnel tests. 
<H5>  4. Measurement and CFD </H5>
  One of the advantages of analyzing an internal flow such as 
found in an engine is that this permits us to estimate flows 
that cannot be conventionally measured. Accordingly, this 
foundational measurement of internal flows contributes greatly 
in improving the precision of our estimations of internal flows. 
In the past the focus has been on measuring the pressures on 
wing surfaces and in blade cascade inlets and outlets, but the 
scope of applications is broadening to such things as the 
photographic effects of the behavior of shock waves at the 
leading edges of rotating fans by means of holographic 
measurements, depicted in Figure 4-1, and the measurement of 
cooling efficiency distributions in cooling paths inside 
high-pressure turbine wings using liquid crystals. We hope that 
such advances in measurement technology as these will pave the 
way for improved CFD reliability and wider CFD applications. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-53A>           Figure 4-1. Inter-Wing Shock Wave Shape Based on Holographic Measurement </FIG>


<H5>  5. Concluding Remarks </H5>
  The scale of wind tunnel tests in aircraft engines varies 
widely from high-altitude performance testing on the high end to 
basic blade cascade tests on the low end, where the test samples 
(models) used are either full or nearly full-size models. Thus 
other things are of greater importance than wind tunnel testing 
and CFD being mutually complementary in high Reynolds number 
regions, namely how CFD can be used to estimate wind tunnel 
tests with good precision, providing information which cannot be 
measured in a wind tunnel, and reflecting this in the design. 
And, as CFD technology, computers, and measurement technology 
become more advanced, the concept of using numerical wind 
tunnels in place of conventional wind tunnels is gaining 
acceptance. We believe that it will not be long before further 
technological breakthroughs give numerical wind tunnel testing a 
more important role to play. We would like to take up the 
matters of environmental impact survey testing and 
supersonic/hypersonic testing in a subsequent article. 
  We are deeply appreciative of all the help we received in 
drafting this article from the National Aerospace Laboratory and 
from universities and other public research institutions.

  [Text] The National Space Development Agency of Japan 
(NASDA) has completed a repair on the arc-heater wind tunnel (at 
the National Aerospace Laboratory in Chofu, Tokyo) which is to 
be used for testing various materials at the ultrahigh 
temperature of 1700C in the development of the Japanese 
version of the space shuttle, among other things. Sumitomo Heavy 
Industries, Ltd., installed the arc heater, one of the main 
features of the wind tunnel, and announced its official delivery 
on 29 September. The total amount of the order to Sumitomo Heavy 
Industries was &yen;420 million. 
  The purpose of the arc-heater wind tunnel is to simulate the 
surface temperature of an object when it re-enters the earth's 
atmosphere and to test the durability of the object under the 
exotic thermal environment. Since the construction of the 
arc-heater wind tunnel by NASDA at the National Aerospace 
Laboratory in 1982, the wind tunnel had used a U.S.-made arc 
heater in performing various tests. 
  However, the U.S.-made arc heater had some limitations in 
terms of the shape and size of the objects being tested, and it 
was plagued with the problems associated with wear and tear in 
recent years, which prompted the present renovation. The 
renovated wind tunnel can be used to test various materials for 
the unmanned winged space vehicle, ``HOPE (H-II Orbital 
Plane),'' among other things, at a surface temperature of 
1700C. 
  The maximum input power of the arc-heater Sumitomo Heavy 
Industries delivered is 750 kW (as compared with the previous 
equipment's maximum input power of 450 kW). The main body is 
divided into 39 segments in order to achieve an appropriate 
heating and cooling balance. Thanks to the segmented structure, 
the heating efficiency is improved by more than 50 percent.

  [Text] Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (IHI) 
completed the F100-220E, an improved version of the F100-100 jet 
engine for the Air Self-Defense Force's (ASDF) intercept fighter 
F-15, and delivered the first engine to the Defense Agency on 29 
October. The new engine is equipped with a digital electronics 
control device (DEEC), which digitally controls all functions of 
the engine. The new engine's main feature is that its 
reliability and controllability have been substantially improved 
over the F100 engine, which was developed in 1975. 
  The DEEC directly controls the engine pressure ratio (EPR), 
using a computer to maintain the air-fuel ratio at the optimum 
level under all flight conditions. As a result, full engine 
performance is guaranteed at every instance to enable the pilot 
to control the throttle with complete freedom. Moreover, the 
DEEC contributes to the improvement of serviceability and 
durability, as well as life-cycle cost. 
  IHI will deliver a total of nine engines this fiscal year to 
the Defense Agency, including the first one it just delivered, 
and 17 additional engines during the next fiscal year.

  [Text] The Defense Agency recently opened the FS-X 
Preparation Office within the agency and officially started the 
preparation for application tests that will begin in FY95 for 
FS-X, the next-generation support fighter currently being 
developed in cooperation with the U.S. The office staff of about 
10 members began work on the pilot-training program and on 
preparation of the facilities required for the application test, 
such as hangars and a flight control system. 
  The FS-X development project began the development in FY88 
of 
a new fighter on the premise that it will be based on the F-16C 
and a combination of Japanese and U.S. technologies. The 
development period was set for 11 years, ending in FY98. The 
basic design was completed and a full-scale mockup built in 
FY92. During FY93, the project worked on detail designs and 
started the production of four prototypes, including two ground 
test prototypes for checking controllability and the structural 
strength and fatigue strength of the airframe and two more 
prototypes for inflight testing of the performance of the 
airframe. 
  In FY94, the developers will continue the work to complete 
the prototypes and will begin the technical tests, including the 
performance check; they hope to conduct the test flight in July 
1995. 
  Since the development has been moving quite well to date and 
on schedule, it was decided to set up the preparation office 
now, to prepare the ground technical support facilities and 
other necessary systems required for the application tests. Two 
FS-X test pilots are being dispatched to the United States this 
month for five months to attend the test pilot course of the 
U.S. Department of Defense. More pilots will be trained later as 
they are selected. 
  At the same time, the test facilities are being built near 
Gifu Base; in addition to the completion of an engine stand, the 
flight-test control system, which will be used for the test 
flight of FS-X and others, has been completed, and its test 
operation began at Gifu Base in September. The system will help 
to accelerate the flight tests and improve safety, as it will 
process and display the test data in real time as it 
communicates with the test airplane during a test flight. In 
addition, test plane hangars and engine hangars are being 
constructed and are expected to be delivered soon, and the 
simulator, as well as its enclosing facilities, will be 
completed by the end of the year, which indicates that 
everything will be ready when it is needed.

  [Text] Bidding for the next-generation broadcasting 
satellite BS4 by the major Japanese satellite makers has been 
clarified. Mitsubishi Electric and NEC will team up with Martin 
Marietta, whereas Toshiba will join Space Systems/Loral's (SSL) 
team. Since the Japanese manufacturers are not competitive with 
the American manufacturers in terms of cost and delivery, there 
is no other choice for them but to join the American teams as 
subcontractors; as yen keeps going up, so does the hurdle for 
the Japanese manufacturers. 
  It was 1990 when the United States signed the Satellite 
Procurement Agreement with Japan under the leverage of the 
Comprehensive Trade Act Super 301. The agreement stipulates open 
international bidding when the government or government-related 
institutions such as NHK and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
(NTT) are procuring a satellite for practical uses. BS4 is going 
to be the third satellite to be procured under the agreement. 
  The order for the communication satellite N-STAR, procured 
by 
NTT in 1991, went to SSL, whereas General Electric got the 
contract when NHK put the job of building its auxiliary 
broadcasting satellite BS3N up for bidding in September 1992. In 
both cases, none of the Japanese companies was able to bid as a 
principal contractor; instead, they remained as subcontractors, 
as in the present case. 
  It is essentially impossible for the Japanese manufacturers 
to compete against the American manufacturers in the same ring, 
because the Americans have the cost advantage of volume 
production as a result of their defense contracts. Moreover, 
with the recent reduction in defense contracts, the American 
manufacturers are desperate for civilian contracts and are ready 
to offer cut-throat prices, lower by $100 million per satellite 
in some cases; as a result, there is no place for the Japanese 
manufacturers in the business. 
  One could understand Japanese manufacturers wanting to give 
the glory of the main contractor to American companies and being 
content with the role of subcontractors, as long as they got 
enough work. A top executive of a Japanese manufacturer, 
however, lamented that ``even if our team wins, it would be 
difficult for us to get a decent share of the work.'' The main 
reason is the steep yen appreciation. If a team gives a major 
chunk of the work to a Japanese partner, the total price will go 
up automatically, and the team won't get the job. 
  Martin Marietta, which is teamed up with Mitsubishi Electric 
and NEC, bought the aerospace division of General Electric this 
spring. 
  So far, all Japanese broadcasting satellites have been built 
either by GE or by someone under GE's license. The BS3N contract 
was given to the GE/Mitsubishi Electric/NEC team, and the same 
team is expected to be the winning candidate. 
  If they win the contract, Mitsubishi Electric will be 
responsible for equipment such as the heat-pipe panel of the 
heat exchanger and for total reliability management, whereas NEC 
will be responsible for onboard equipment such as the antenna 
and radiowave transmitter. All in all, however, a person in 
charge confides that ``it is inevitable that the Japanese 
portions will be less this time than in the case of the BS3N.'' 
  Toshiba's responsibility on the SSL team will be, as it 
stands now, reliability management and after-launch operational 
support. It has not given up on the manufacture of satellite 
hardware, but the chance of getting that is bleak because the 
adverse yen-dollar exchange rate makes its price uncompetitive. 
  Toshiba is also hurting because of a delay in the H2 launch 
vehicle. As a result of the delay in the development of the H2, 
the launch of NASDA's Engineering Test Satellite ETS-VI, which 
was built under the leadership of Toshiba, is also delayed until 
next summer. Thus, Toshiba has lost a golden opportunity to 
appeal its technical expertise to SSL to negotiate a higher 
production share in the present project. 
  In addition to Martin Marietta and SSL, Hughes is expected 
to 
participate in the upcoming bid. The Broadcasting Satellite 
Company, a procurement company that was set up by NHK and in 
which NHK is the principal shareholder, is going to select the 
company in charge of the manufacture by the end of the year. 
Even if a team including one or more Japanese firms wins the 
contract, it is still uncertain how much work the Japanese firms 
can get.

  [Text] The Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC) 
has made a survey and submitted a preliminary report on the FY92 
sales by the space industry. The total figure for the sales, 
which consisted mainly of craft such as launch vehicles and of 
software, was &yen;308,007 million, a drop of about 16 percent 
from the previous year. 
  The total of the spacecraft sales was &yen;175,005 million 
(an increase of 12 percent over the previous year). The sales of 
the H-II launch vehicle, manufactured with local technologies, 
dropped to &yen;53,465 million (a 12.6 percent decrease) as it 
was nearing its completion. On the other hand, space shuttle and 
satellite sales increased by &yen;2,206 million (a 82.4 percent 
increase) and &yen;120,034 million (a 37.2 percent increase), 
respectively. 
  Of the total sales of &yen;308,007 million, 85 percent 
consisted of domestic sales, and the rest was export. However, 
``30-35 percent of the domestic sales were double-counted'' 
(SJAC's comment), as they were counted twice in some cases, once 
when the government ordered, and again when the principal 
contractors issued orders to subcontractors. Therefore, the 
actual size of sales is smaller than what appeared in the 
statistics. 
  On the other hand, the ``services provided,'' which are 
tabulated separately because of their nature of business, 
consisted mainly of leasing business, and the total sales were 
&yen;58,740 million. Because of the increasing use of 
communication and broadcasting satellites, the sales figure more 
than doubled over the previous year. 
  The survey was done in August of this year, with 
questionnaires mailed out to 85 firms involved in space 
development; 66 companies responded, and the results were 
processed to make the report.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) will conduct a trend survey during FY94 regarding the 
commercialization of the space development industry to promote 
the commercialization. Although commercialization of the space 
development industry is actively pursued in the leading space 
development nations, including the United States and some 
European countries, the idea behind the survey is that it sees a 
need for Japan to more aggressively study the policies on space 
commercialization and the issue of how the space industries 
should be developed from this point on, identify the obstacles 
in the course of that, and then seek ways to overcome those 
obstacles. MITI is said to have commissioned the Society of 
Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC) to investigate the 
above-mentioned subjects and to produce a report by March 1995 
based on the results of the investigation. 
  The market size of the Japanese space industry is only about 
&yen;300 billion (FY92). Moreover, the bulk of the business 
comes from government or public undertakings that are also much 
smaller in scale than those in the leading space development 
nations. Any space development project inherently involves a 
gargantuan financial need, long lead time, and R&amp;D risks, so 
that it is often beyond the capabilities of private firms; there 
are a great many problems to be dealt with in the nurturing of 
the space development industry. 
  In the spring of 1993, MITI established a private study 
group 
called Forum for the Institutionalization of Space Industry, 
consisting of the selected members of industry, government, and 
academic circles, to seek the proper direction to be taken in 
nurturing and developing the space industry. 
  The reason MITI is starting a similar study for the space 
industry commercialization at this time is that it sees a need 
to respond to the shift occurring in the leading nations in 
connection with the end of the Cold War away from the use of 
space technology for national or defense interests to commercial 
applications. Also, while the majority of the commercial space 
business is already captured by overseas vendors, several 
international competitions are expected to take place in the 
coming years. MITI believes that Japan has to be prepared for 
such a future. 
  The United States has already established a specific policy, 
which is already in effect, for commercializations in five 
designated areas -- namely, launch services, satellite 
communications, satellite remote sensing, in-orbit materials 
manufacturing and processes, and infrastructure for in-orbit 
businesses. In Europe, various space industries have also been 
established, and commercialization is under way in many fields, 
led by launch services and remote sensing. Furthermore, as a 
result of a severe need to earn hard currencies, Russia is 
offering the service of conducting in-orbit experiments on the 
Mir space station and Foton recovery capsule, while China has 
established a commercialization office to promote its launch 
services. 
  The above-mentioned survey on commercialization will 
investigate and study such items as: 
  (1) trends in space commercialization policies, their 
problems, and the industry's responses in each developed nation; 
  (2) how a commercialization policy is to be established and 
how the industry should be structured in Japan -- specifically, 
a policy transferring government-owned technologies to the 
private sector, risk reduction measures to be taken by private 
firms, determination of which space technologies should be 
transferred, etc.;

<F P=106> [Article by Toshifumi Hirai, general manager of the Aircraft </F>
&amp; Ordnance Division of MITI] 
  [Text] The aircraft industry is in a predicament worldwide 
as a result of cutbacks in defense spending and poor business 
conditions among the airlines. Although the Japanese aircraft 
industry has been growing steadily up until now -- first, in 
connection with overcoming the handicap of being left behind by 
the rest of the world as a result of Japan's defeat in World War 
II and, second, in connection with surviving in the narrow niche 
in the market -- it has yet to face many problems that are now 
known to other high-tech industries. 
  Historically, it is a universal fate of the aircraft 
industry 
of any nation that it can not live without the support of the 
government, because of its close ties to the defense industry 
and because of the huge risks involved in development projects. 
In addition to that, the Japanese aircraft industry is unique in 
that the degree of its dependency on defense needs is much 
higher than that in the United States and Europe; there are only 
a few manufacturers that are dedicated to aircraft production; 
defense needs consist of mostly license productions; and the 
bulk of commercial aircraft and engine productions are also 
limited to subassembly-level productions. 
  Although we cannot deny that such an industrial structure 
has 
made sense up until now, it is obvious that, in light of the 
situation the world aircraft industry will be at the threshold 
of the twenty-first century, an increase in the ratio of 
commercial needs is urgently needed and supporting factors such 
as R&amp;D capabilities and human resources need to improve. 
<H5>  Pursuit of Autonomy </H5>
  If the first task consists in maintaining an optimum balance 
between risk-free defense needs and the risky commercial needs, 
the second task consists in tackling various projects that 
maintain the optimum balance. The projects that are currently 
under way can be divided into those that require developments 
under Japan's own leadership, such as YSX (commercial jet, 
seating 75-90 passengers) and the ``small engine'' project, and 
those futuristic large-scale international projects such as the 
``supersonic airplane'' and the ``ultralarge airplane.'' In 
addition to the above, there are projects that are already in 
the production or marketing phases, such as the ``B 777'' and 
``V 2500 engine'' projects. Development of new technologies such 
as helicopters and new materials should not be overlooked, 
either. While all of those projects need to be promoted in a 
concerted manner to order to keep an optimum balance, it is 
important for us to realize that the premises for it have to be 
aggressive challenges in technological innovations and the 
pursuit of Japan's autonomy under the framework of international 
cooperation. 
<H5>  Maiden Flight in 21st Century </H5>
  YS-11 was developed in Japan about 30 years ago (182 
airplanes sold since); more than 100 of them are still in 
service around the world today. Many people wonder why that 
turboprop airplane seating 60 passengers is, for whatever 
reason, the only commercial airplane ever produced in Japan, a 
country of such technological capability. But times are 
changing, and many promising buds are about to unfold. 
  The YSX project has entered the feasibility study phase 
already; if an economically and politically favorable conclusion 
comes out of it, development will start within two years, and 
the maiden flight will probably take place at the beginning of 
the twenty-first century. 
<H5>  Enhancing International Cooperation </H5>
  Despite its current stagnation, the number of airline 
passengers worldwide is predicted to increase by 6 percent 
annually on a long-term basis. Amidst the worldwide trend of 
expectations of long-term stable growth of the aircraft 
industry, which is certain to bring about innovations and have 
synergistic effects on related industries, Japan must try to 
further advance and expand its horizons while enhancing 
international cooperation at the same time.

  [Text] Fujitsu, Ltd., has developed a software package for 
work stations to be used for the calculation and analysis of the 
orbits of satellites circling the earth. It can be used not only 
to calculate the orbit of a satellite in time series by entering 
the position and speed of the satellite, but also to display the 
calculated orbits on a world map. Its price is only one-tenth 
the price of the software packages for large general-purpose 
computers. As a low-cost orbit-analysis software package for 
personal use by engineers and scientists, it will be aimed at 
various institutions and companies that use satellite data, such 
as National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), aerial 
survey companies, broadcasting corporations, and universities. 
  The software was developed as a package for work stations 
based on orbit-analysis software for large general-purpose 
computers that Fujitsu developed for NASDA and are currently 
operated by NASDA. Depending on the desired accuracy of 
analysis, three different models are available -- Orbiter/1 
(&yen;3 million), Orbiter/2 (&yen;1.5 million), and Orbiter/3 
(&yen;0.5 million). They all work on Fujitsu's S-family work 
stations. The company hopes to sell 20 sets a year. 
  Once the basic data such as position, speed, and time of a 
satellite obtained from the satellite operating company or 
organization are entered into a work station loaded with this 
software, it will automatically calculate the position of the 
satellite at a certain point in the future or the direction seen 
from an arbitrary point on the ground, keeping factors such as 
the atmosphere and the gravity in consideration. 
  NASDA and other space-related research organizations 
normally 
use large general-purpose computers to calculate the orbits of 
the satellites that are currently in operation or are to be 
launched in the future. Since the software packages for large 
computers are quite expensive to develop -- more than &yen;30 
million -- they are not readily available for individual 
engineers or scientists for their own orbit calculations and 
studies. 
  Companies such as aerial survey companies, broadcasting 
corporations, and radio service companies have had to depend on 
data from research institutions, etc. Since this new software 
enables smaller firms to do in-house orbit calculations, there 
are many applications; for example, aerial survey companies will 
be able to plan ``when and where to start next surveys.''

  [Text] The Engineering Test Satellite-VII (``ETS-VII'') is 
an engineering test satellite scheduled to be launched in 1997. 
  Future space activities require a whole new set of 
techniques 
related to delivery and retrieval of materials to and from 
spacecraft, as well as assembly of the spacecraft itself. 
ETS-VII is designed to perform a rendezvous and docking (RVD) 
experiment and a space robotics experiment to learn those 
techniques. 
  ETS-VII consists of a chaser satellite and a target 
satellite 
to perform the rendezvous experiment. After the chaser satellite 
separates the target satellite and distances itself from the 
target satellite about 30-50 km, it tries to approach the target 
satellite again in an accurate maneuver and dock with the target 
satellite at a safe speed with the help of the GPS receiver and 
optical sensor (rendezvous radar and proximity sensor). It is 
equipped with a remote-controlled robotic arm to conduct various 
RBT experiments, such as the coordination control experiment 
between the arm and the satellite attitude control system, 
various remote-control experiments using the task board, the 
in-orbit equipment replacement experiment using ORU, and the 
propellants supply simulation experiment. We will also learn 
techniques for performing in-orbit work via data relay 
satellites (COMETS, etc.) as a result of those experiments from 
the ground via data relay satellites. Those techniques represent 
not only first experiences for us, but also world-class frontier 
technologies. 
  Also, various national research institutions are expected to 
participate in this project to conduct various engineering 
experiments with the onboard space robotics element engineering 
experiment equipment in combination with their own experiment 
equipment, and sometimes with NASDA's own experiment equipment 
as well. 
  Participating organizations and experiment equipment are as 
follows: 
  (1) Advanced robotics arm (MITI; Electrotechnical 
Laboratory); 
  (2) Antenna assembling mechanism (Communications Research 
Laboratory); 
  (3) Truss construction (National Aerospace Laboratory) 
  In addition to the above, the feasibility of various other 
experiments is being studied now, including the world's first 
attempt to manipulate the target satellite with a robot arm 
combining the RVD and RBT technologies. 
  Heightened expectations for ETS-VII in terms of its rich 
variety of possibilities are being reflected in numerous 
requests not only from domestic sources, but also from overseas, 
in terms of opportunities to conduct experiments using these 
resources. 
  At the moment, the ETS-VII project is in its preliminary 
design (Phase 2) stage and a system configuration that is 
capable of conducting not only the basic experiments, but also 
advanced experiments, are being studied. We are trying to 
achieve, within the constraints of schedule and development 
costs, the optimum use of this unique experiment opportunity, a 
rare opportunity even on a worldwide scale.

  [Text] NASDA is currently conducting a microgravity 
experiment project using a small rocket (TR-IA, dubbed 
``Takesaki'') to develop techniques required for conducting 
various experiments on the space station. 
  In the implementation of this microgravity experiment 
project, we have selected experiment themes suitable for the 
technical development objective of each piece of experimental 
equipment and have been supported by representatives of various 
national test and research organizations, universities, and 
private research organizations. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-08A>  Experimental system/rocket (onboard equipment) general performance test </FIG>


  We launched TR-IA 1 in September 1991, and TR-IA 2 in August 
1992 from the Takesaki Range of the Tanegashima Space Center; we 
successfully conducted experiments on a total of 10 themes and 
achieved the expected results using six minutes of microgravity. 
  We will launch TR-IA 3 on 8 September 1993 as the third 
experiment of the series. TR-IA 3 will carry the experimental 
equipment unit (II) in joint research conducted by NASDA and the 
Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc., in addition to 
the experimental equipment unit (I), carried in tests Nos. 1 and 
2, for the development of the space experiment technique. As a 
result, the total length of the rocket is about 0.6 meters 
greater than that of Nos. 1 and 2.

<H3>  Introduction of Test Facility for Space Station JEM (Ultra 
High Speed Collision Test Facility) </H3>
  A large number of meteorites and debris created by 
explosions 
of rockets are floating around the earth. The amount of debris 
is increasing each year and is becoming a threat to space 
shuttles and satellites that are flying around the earth. In 
addition to numerous reports of dents and scratches found on the 
windows of shuttles, there is even a report of a near miss 
between a shuttle and a huge piece of debris. 
  In light of the fact that the space station is expected to 
stay in orbit for 30 years and that there will be four-eight 
people living in it all the time, protecting the space station 
from meteorites and debris is an extremely serious matter. The 
debris in the space station's orbit, which is about 400 km above 
the earth, is moving at a speed of about 7.7 km/sec, and the 
relative speed toward the space station can be as high as 15.4 
km/sec. 
  The debris, classified by size, is as shown in Table 1. 
  Pieces larger than 10 cm have been identified by radar 
observation, and the orbit of each of them has been calculated, 
so that the space station's orbit is changed to avoid the 
collision if the space station is expected to come in contact 
with one of them. 
  The debris of the size range of 1-10 cm is a big problem for 
the space station program, and no effective means of protection 
has been found yet against them; our plan is to avoid potential 
collisions with them through an intensified observation network. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-10A></FIG>

              A bumper will be placed around the experimental module and 
important equipment to soften the impacts of the debris smaller 
than 1 cm. The ultrahigh-speed impact test equipment being 
discussed here is designed to evaluate the protection capability 
of such a bumper and pressure bulkhead. 
  This equipment was manufactured as a part of the basic 
experiments associated with the development of the JEM 
pressurized module and is installed at the Sagamihara Plant of 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries; the preliminary test to collect the 
basic data with helium gas has been completed. At the moment, it 
is undergoing a modification to make it suitable for the tests 
using hydrogen gas, which has a faster expansion rate than 
helium.

  I. Operating principle of ultrahigh-speed collision test 
equipment 
  Fig. 1 shows the schematic drawing of the ultrahigh-speed 
collision test equipment. 



  The phenomena that occur between the ignition of the 
explosive and the impact on the specimen are as follows: 
  (1) ignition of the explosive in the combustion chamber; 
  (2) breaking of the diaphragm by the combustion gas; 
  (3) acceleration of the piston as a result of the pressure 
of 
the combustion gas; 
  (4) compression of the light gas by the piston; 
  (5) breakage of the diaphragm by the high- pressure gas; 
  (6) acceleration of the projectile by the high- pressure 
gas; 
  (7) separation of the sabot from the debris as a result of 
gas resistance; 
  (8) measurement of the debris speed by a laser oscillator; 
  (9) impact on the specimen. 
  The sabot is a case that holds the debris; the use of the 
sabot and the debris as separate pieces enables one to test 
debris of various sizes and shapes. A good amount of experience 
is required to achieve a successful separation between the sabot 
and the debris. 
  2. Main specifications of ultrahigh-speed collision test 
equipment 
  The specifications of the equipment using hydrogen gas are 
as 
follows: 
  Total lengthapprox. 22 m 
  Max. speed8 km/sec (target) 
  Max. debris diameter8mm 
  Max. debris mass0.5 g 
  Equipped with sabot separator 
  3. Test results up until now 
  Fig. 2 below shows the typical test example. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-10B>           Fig. 2 </FIG>


  The picture shows the bumper at the left and the pressure 
bulkhead at the center. The debris went through the bumper and 
the pressure bulkhead as well, leaving a hole approximately 7 cm 
in diameter. The test conditions were as follows: 
  Debris collision speed4.87 km/sec 
  Debris mass1.73 g (AI) 
  Distance between bumper and bulkhead10 cm 
  4. Future test plan 
  Since the design of the bumper surrounding the pressure 
bulkhead has not been finalized yet and it is urgent that the 
structural design of the pressurized unit itself be finalized, 
the evaluation test of the pressure bulkhead will be conducted 
first; the evaluation test of the bumper will be conducted next. 
In the meanwhile, we also plan to accumulate data in 
coordination with NASA and ESA.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kamesaburo Matsunaga, Chairman, Chubu </F>
Economic Federation; first paragraph is source introduction] 
  [Text] Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology Promotion 
Center, Inc., was established in late August with the aim of 
promoting the concentration of the aerospace industry and its 
research capabilities in the Chubu district (the area 
surrounding Nagoya), as well as the sophistication of related 
industries. It is a non-profit corporation for public interest, 
and the successor to Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology 
Promotion Conference, which ceased to exist with the 
incorporation of the other. The new corporation intends to 
promote various business plans aimed at the realization of 
``Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept,'' to realize the 
project in the very near future. As a start, it will work up a 
plan for establishing a ``wind tunnel research facility'' and 
will solicit the central government to bring it to this area, 
and it will collect related information available from NTIS 
(U.S. National Technical Information Service), especially in the 
material science field, and from other sources to build a 
database to provide the information to the local industries. The 
following is the transcript of Mr. Kamesaburo Matsunaga's 
answers to questions regarding future business plans and the 
like. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: First of all, why was it 
necessary for the Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology 
Promotion Conference, an arbitrary juridical person, to be 
disbanded to be reborn as the Chubu Aerospace Industry and 
Technology Promotion Center, Inc.? 
  MATSUNAGA: It has been three years and ten months 
since the Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology Promotion 
Conference was established in October 1989. During that period, 
(1) it held technology-exchange conferences and symposia in 
order to familiarize the local industries with aerospace-related 
technologies and to transfer the technologies to them; (2) it 
conducted surveys and studies on the technology transfer and the 
aerospace-related test-and-evaluation facilities; and (3) it 
solicited the government for national projects (research 
facilities such as a wind tunnel). While we were busying 
ourselves in these activities, we began to hear the member 
companies and the local governments voice their requests for our 
organization to expand its activities and for the need for our 
organization to increase its influence on the central government. 
  Upon hearing those requests and opinions, we studied the 
method of expanding the activities, including the matter of 
incorporation, at the study committee held in August last year. 
In June of this year, a meeting of promoters for establishing a 
non-profit corporation was held, officially initiating the 
discussions on that matter. 
  The conclusion of the discussions that followed was that 
what 
was needed most was to keep the gist of the establishment of the 
Conference and to further enhance and expand. More specifically, 
we agreed that it was essential that we do the following: (1) 
exchange research and offer information in order to acquaint 
people with and promote aerospace-related technologies; (2) 
vitalize the project planning and proposal activities, targeting 
the central government and others (promotion of research 
activities); and (3) enhance the organization, including the 
administration office, in order to implement those activities. I 
believe this will greatly contribute to the formation of ``the 
central region of industrial technology,'' and to the 
vitalization of the local communities. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What are the future business 
plans? 
  MATSUNAGA: In terms of our business plans, we have 
the following five categories of activities we wish to pursue in 
order to promote the concentration of the aerospace industry and 
its research capabilities, as well as the sophistication of 
related industries, in the Chubu district. 
  We will conduct, first, the surveys and studies, as well as 
planning, necessary for the promotion of the concentration of 
aerospace industry and its research capabilities, as well as the 
sophistication of related industries; second, exchange of 
research in order to achieve synergistic effects between the 
aerospace industry and other industries; third, collection and 
supply of information regarding aerospace industries; fourth, 
familiarization and educational activities; and fifth, 
coordination and cooperation with related organizations. 
  During the next two years, in terms of the activities of the 
first category, we will concentrate our efforts on the 
following: (1) studies on the preferred format for the 
information network; (2) project planning regarding the wind 
tunnel proposed in the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park; (3) 
surveys on technology needs and seeds; and (4) project planning 
in the aerospace-related arena. In the second category, we will 
hold technology-exchange conferences (forums) with limited 
members on various specific themes. 
  In the third category, we will work on expanding our 
capability to collect related information available from NTIS 
(the U.S. National Technical Information Service) and other 
sources, particularly, on materials science data, in order to 
build a database to provide the information to the local 
industries. In the fourth, we will organize lecture meetings and 
seminars and international aerospace symposia every other year 
(beginning in 1994), and we will issue an information 
periodical. As to the fifth category, in the next two years, we 
will exchange views and information with aerospace organizations 
in other areas, submit our opinions to the government so that 
they be reflected in the national policies, coordinate and 
cooperate with the government and its subordinate organizations, 
and participate in various related events. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: How are your solicitation 
activities on national research facilities working out? 
  MATSUNAGA: We believe it is not only necessary, 
but also more effective to work with local government and 
economic organizations when it comes to the solicitation 
activities. Therefore, we think it is more appropriate for this 
Center to assume the role of a coordinator. Of course, there is 
a case when it is better that we be the principal player. 
  For example, in terms of the ``wind tunnel research 
facility'' we have been pursuing as one of the focal points of 
our own studies since the days of the previous organization, we 
will continue our activities, carefully watching the move of the 
central government. In order to achieve the objective in this 
matter, we will try to collect information from related 
government branches and their subordinate research organizations 
through conferences (in Tokyo) and individual visits. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: How do you intend to proceed 
on the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept from now on? 
  MATSUNAGA: The concept consists of seven projects: 
(1) Large Evaluation Test Center; (2) Space Technology Center, 
(3) Earth Observation Center, (4) National Aerospace Research 
Facility, (5) Aerospace Information Center, (6) Flight Test 
Center, and (7) Aerospace Science and Technology Recreation 
Arena. 
  Of those, the Information Center has already been realized, 
as the gist of its activities is built into the activities plan 
of this Promotion Center. As for the other projects in the 
concept, we will be studying implementation plans and we will 
move swiftly on to the solicitation activities when the plans 
are completed; however, we will concentrate on the realization 
of the wind tunnel research facility for the time being. In 
addition to the above, we are also evaluating the 
``Aerospace-Related Arena'' as a part of next year's survey and 
study activities. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: How many members do you have 
at the moment, and what are the benefits of being a member? 
  MATSUNAGA: We have about 150 full members 
(consisting of companies, local governments, economic 
organizations, etc.) and a few supporting members. 
  There are quite a few merits to being a member. For example, 
the members will be able to have access to NTIS research papers 
(3,000-4,000 each year) free of charge. The members can meet 
with various people from industry, government, and academic 
circles, including people from different industries through 
various technical conferences and forums. 
  Also, as a member, you can attend the lectures, seminars and 
symposiums presented by authorities and specialists, and even 
consult them on specific matters. We are planning to invite 
authorities to our office as advisors once a week. The members 
can participate in various field trips and visits to special 
places, generally free of charge; the members will also receive 
an information periodical (of the Center). 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Thank you very much for your 
comments. 
  Address: 3-1-1, Sakae, Naka-ku, Nagoya.

  Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept 
  The intention of the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept 
is to bring a core research-and-development organization into 
the Chubu district plus, at the same time, taking advantage of 
the concentration of aerospace industry, sophisticated machining 
and assembling technologies, research-and-production 
technologies on new materials such as fine ceramics, which 
already exist in this district, in order to form a general 
research-and-production complex in this district. 
  It also aims at the integration and sophistication of local 
industries through technology exchange with the aerospace 
industry, which is an amalgamation of advanced technologies, 
and, moreover, the creation of new industries based on such 
advanced technologies in the district. The concept was generated 
by the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept Realization 
Committee of the Chubu Regional Bureau of International Trade 
and Industry in June 1990. 
  The Chubu district has the concentration of major aerospace 
technology provided by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawaaski 
Heavy Industries, and Fuji Heavy Industries, and the output of 
that industry in this district represents more than half of the 
national output. It claims a concentration of various 
world-class frontier industry and research organizations, so 
that the district has a great potential for becoming the leader 
of the aerospace industry in the future.

  [Text] In discussing future space developments, experts are 
predicting a shift away from satellites that merely make use of 
their position in space such as communication and broadcasting 
satellites, weather satellites, earth observation satellites, 
astronomical observation satellites, and navigation satellites 
toward satellite/base stations (material testing satellites, 
space factories, solar-powered satellites, and plants for 
recovering lunar and planetary resources) that use the unique 
zero-gravity high-vacuum environment of space to recover 
resources and energy from space. They also are predicting a 
shift from single-shot launches to a systematic utilization of 
the entire space environment. In order for space to be a place 
of industrial activity that complements the work being done on 
earth. What is needed first is a comprehensive system called a 
space infrastructure. 
  What this entails specifically is building, maintaining, and 
supporting permanent bases in space such as space stations, 
space platforms, and lunar bases. A good example of that is the 
ISS (international space station) project being conducted 
jointly between the United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada, 
but it is the space shuttle (STS) that has given new meaning to 
the STS for the first time. 
  The space shuttle, in addition to being reusable and being 
manned by astronauts, has two other notable features that make 
it different from conventional satellites in terms of orbital 
functions. The first of these has to do with the fact that the 
space shuttle has a rendezvous-docking function (RVD) that 
enables it to move freely in space and rendezvous with and link 
up with a given target. The second difference is a space 
manipulator arm called the Canada arm. These RVD and space robot 
technologies have made it possible for the first time to build, 
maintain, and support the ISS. 
  In this paper, we provide an overview of the RVD and space 
robot technologies and describe the technical problems 
encountered in each, and then outline where we at Mitsubishi 
Electric are at in terms of R&amp;D being done in these areas. 
<H5>  1. Rendezvous-Docking Technology </H5>
  (1) Overview of Rendezvous-Docking Technology 
  Rendezvous-docking (RVD) technology is a general term used 
to 
describe the overall technology for launching a spacecraft 
called a ``chaser'' from the earth or a holding orbit toward 
another orbiting satellite or spacecraft called a ``target,'' 
and having the chaser spacecraft rendezvous with and link up 
with that target spacecraft. The process in which the chaser 
approaches the target is called the ``rendezvous,'' and the 
process of linking up is called ``docking.'' 
  RVD technology also includes a series of processes in which 
after separating from the target the chaser either leaves the 
target and returns to earth or to a fixed orbital position, or 
is jettisoned, that is, allowed to enter the earth's atmosphere 
and burn up. Hence, RVD technology could be called a type of 
complex technology or system technology that spans a wide range 
of activities. 
  (2) Trends in Rendezvous-Docking Technology 
  There are only two countries in the world today, the United 
States and Russia, that have made practical use of RVD 
technology. However, since RVD is one of the basic technologies 
for future space activities, there is vigorous research being 
done by other countries as well including Japan, France, and 
Germany. 
  Since the late 1970s, Japan has been doing research on RVD 
technology at the National Aerospace Laboratory run by the 
Science and Technology Agency, the National Space Development 
Agency, and the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science 
operated by the Ministry of Education. In the fall of 1992, the 
National Space Development Agency installed a computer graphics 
driven simulator at the Tsukuba Space Center to do research and 
testing on RVD systems. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Institute 
for Unmanned Space Experiment Free Flyer), the Ministry of 
Education (Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science), and the 
Science and Technology Agency (National Space Development 
Agency) are also jointly involved in developing a space 
experiment and observation free flyer called the Space Flyer 
Unit (SFU) which is targeted for launch a year and a half from 
now. The Space Flyer Unit will be Japan's first reusable 
satellite. After being launched by a Japanese H-II rocket, the 
satellite will be recovered by a U.S. space shuttle and sent 
back to Japan to be reused (cf. Figure 1).[.sup](1)[/] The 
SFU will be equipped with a navigational guidance and control 
system that can control the spacecraft for up to 44 hours, and 
will be used to take it from an operational orbit to the space 
shuttle recovery point under its own power. In that sense, the 
SFU is expected to be the first Japanese satellite to perform a 
rendezvous. 



  Another project being planned is the ETS-VII (8th 
engineering 
test satellite). The National Space Development Agency is 
currently working on the preliminary design and schedule for 
launching the ETS-VII in 1997. It will be the first time that 
Japan will perform a major RVD experiment in orbit which 
includes docking. As far as future projects, we are looking into 
other uses for RVD technology in the HOPE space shuttle that 
will be launched by an H-II rocket, and will be used to supply 
the international space station (ISS). In Figure 2 [figure not 
reproduced], we show a conceptual drawing of the HOPE rendezvous 
with the ISS.[.sup](1)[/] 
  In conventional rendezvous-docking as performed by the 
United 
States, a pilot from a manned spacecraft performs the rendezvous 
and docking while maneuvering the spacecraft. The former Soviet 
Union used to use a similar technology but later switched to an 
automated RVD system. The type of docking done by both the 
United States and former Soviet Union is called impact docking 
because of the fast relative speeds during docking (about 
0.2-0.5 m/s). Compared with that, Japan is considering an 
automated type RVD technology in an unmanned spacecraft 
(remotely controlled from the ground). It will be a low-impact 
type (2-3 cm/s) so that docking speed will have little effect on 
the equipment carried aboard the spacecraft. This new type of 
RVD technology has proven to be quite a challenge so far in the 
R&amp;D being done by the United States and Europe, but Japan 
hopes 
that with the ETS-VII that it will become the first country in 
the world to test this new technology. 
  (3) Work Done by Mitsubishi Electric on Rendezvous-Docking 
Technology 
  At Mitsubishi Electric, we first began to realize the 
importance of RVD technology in the late 1970s right after Japan 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-14A>  Figure 1.  Conceptual Drawing of SFU Operational Sequence </FIG>

had become the third country in the world to launch a 
geostationary satellite, and subsequently built up a lot of 
R&amp;D 
over the next 10 years. In recent years, the activities with 
which we have been involved include supporting the joint 
research between the National Aerospace Laboratory and the 
National Space Development Agency, taking part in joint research 
with the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science, 
supervising research commissioned by the National Space 
Development Agency, organizing the SFU system, and designing a 
navigational guidance and control system. While being receptive 
to guidance from many quarters, we have concurrently pushed 
ahead with in-house developments.[.sup](1)[/] 
  The R&amp;D spans many diverse fields including sensors 
(imaging 
sensors, laser sensors, etc.), equipment such as docking 
facilities, on-board computers, navigational guidance and 
control systems, flight management systems, S/W AND H/W 
simulators, and design and analysis programs. An example of this 
is the docking dynamic simulator (DDS) shown in Figure 3 which 
we developed in-house in 1990. The DDS is a unit that has the 
capability to precisely reproduce the six degrees of relative 
rotational and translational motion in a zero-gravity 
environment for two spacecraft as they dock and separate. France 
is the only other country in the world with a zero-gravity 
motion simulator based on a similar principle of operation. This 
piece of equipment has been attracting a lot of attention both 
inside and outside Japan. 



<H5>  2. Space Robot Technology </H5>
  (1) Overview of Space Robot Technology 
  The space robot, a kind of robot carried aboard a spacecraft 
and used to perform work in space, is becoming more important in 
terms of future space activities, and so a lot more R&amp;D is 
going 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-14B>           Figure 3.  Docking Dynamic Simulator </FIG>

into the space robot here in Japan and elsewhere. The R&amp;D on 
space robot technology in Japan started in the mid-1980s. From 
1990, the National Space Development Agency has been developing 
plans to do orbital experiments on space robot technology using 
the ETS-VII. 
  In 1991, the National Space Development Agency installed a 
space robot test bed at the Tsukuba Space Center that provided 
an environment approximating actual operating conditions in 
space for the purpose of doing research and testing on the 
element technologies needed for such a space robot. 
  (2) Work Done by Space Robot 
  The space robot has two different configurations depending 
on 
the type of work it is doing. There is the remote-controlled 
space robot and the autonomous space robot. 
  After a chaser spacecraft has rendezvoused and linked up 
with 
the target spacecraft it is to service using the rendezvous 
technology described in the foregoing sections of this report, 
the remote-controlled space robot is used to perform tasks such 
as replacing orbital replacement units (ORU), assembling 
structural elements such as trusses, assisting with other 
structural work, assisting with space experiments, and making 
repairs, all done by remote-control instructions received from 
the ground. What we mean here by the ORU is a module that is 
loaded with replacement batteries and supplemental propellant. 
  The autonomous-type space robot is a space robot having 
sophisticated autonomous features that do not require human 
intervention at all. The autonomous space robot was designed for 
doing busing work by an unmanned spacecraft which is almost 
impossible to do by remote control from earth, and for 
performing activities in deep space where human intervention is 
basically impossible. An example of the busing work done by an 
autonomous space robot is illustrated in the conceptual drawing 
of ASREX (automatic satellite retrieval experiment) shown in 
Figure 4 that was part of a joint research project conducted 
with the Education Ministry's Institute of Space and 
Aeronautical Science in 1987.[.sup](1)[/] 



  (3) Work Done by Mitsubishi Electric on Space Robot 
Technology 
  Mitsubishi Electric has been working non-stop to develop the 
technologies for the two types of space robots mentioned 
above.[.sup](1,2)[/] A major problem that we have encountered 
in developing the remote-controlled space robot has been finding 
a way to resolve the time delays in the data communication 
pathways that connect the operator on the ground with the space 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-15A>  Figure 4. Conceptual Drawing of Automated Busing Work of Satellite </FIG>

robot, and also the limitations on the amount of information 
that can be transmitted. For the reason, we will have to come up 
with several ways to compensate for the addition of partial 
autonomy in the orbital system, and for the deterioration in 
maneuverability. 
  In specific terms, we recognized the effectiveness of 
introducing a force control system in the orbital system for 
permitting alignment and maneuvering errors due to remote 
control, and the effectiveness of introducing a prediction 
display screen in the ground system to enable the operating 
status of the space robot to be predicted in real time with the 
help of a computer. We also confirmed the effectiveness of 
shaping the robot fingers, the objects to be worked on, and the 
work sequence itself so as to make the work done by the space 
robot that much more easier (robot-friendly). In Figure 5, we 
show a schematic drawing of a ground-based experiment involving 
a remote-controlled space robot developed by Mitsubishi 
Electric.[.sup](1)[/] 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-15B>  Figure 5. Ground Based Experiment on Remote-Controlled Space Robot </FIG>



  In the meantime, one of the main goals in developing the 
autonomous space robot is to perfect the busing work involved in 
capturing and releasing a target satellite. In order to develop 
a space robot that will be able to perform the required busing 
work on its own, one of the major things that must be done is to 
develop test apparatus that enable us to do simulations on the 
ground that take into account the bi-directional movement of the 
target satellite captured with the satellite vehicle in a 
zero-gravity environment so that we might develop the necessary 
control algorithms, busing sensors, and confirm these functions 
and operations. 
  Therefore, Mitsubishi Electric has been working on a 
ground-based test apparatus called the ``busing simulator'' 
equipped with an arm that will enable the motion of the 
satellite vehicle and the target satellite to be simulated 
during capture and release of the target satellite by the arm. 
In Figure 6 [figure not reproduced], we show the busing work 
done by the busing simulator. 
  The busing simulator enables simulation of the six degrees 
of 
relative motion between the satellite main unit and target. The 
right side of the photo shows the satellite vehicle with robot 
arm, and the left side of the photo shows the target satellite. 
The satellite vehicle has been provided with visual sensors to 
measure the relative position and relative attitude against that 
of the target satellite. 
<H5>  3. Future Prospects </H5>
  Rendezvous-docking and space robot technologies will be as 
important to future space developments as the wheel was to the 
automobile. 
  A report issued by the long-term policy committee in the 
Space Activities Commission (PM Office), commenting on plans 
beyond the 21st century, said that Japan will continue taking 
part in international joint ventures in areas such as the space 
station, and that it will build its own space station and turn 
this into a base for building large space factories and 
maintaining and operating low-cost space shuttles. The report 
also talked about Japan expanding its space probe activities 
including on-going observations of space from a large facility 
in space, and making direct probes to other bodies in the solar 
system and taking back samples from those places. 
  Rendezvous-docking technology and space robot technology are 
expected to form a solid technological base for achieving the 
large-scale space activities that we have mentioned above.

Institute] 
  [Text] In the early part of the 21st century, a lunar base 
is scheduled to be built for the purpose of exploiting lunar 
resources and making astronomical and scientific observations. 
The first lunar base will be for short-term stays so most of the 
materials will be shipped from earth, but ultimately plans call 
for a long-term colony-type lunar base that will be entirely 
self-sufficient. 
  The surface of the moon is an extremely inhospitable 
environment for humans to live or work in, not merely because it 
lacks oxygen, but also because of the marked differences between 
daytime and nighttime temperatures and other factors such as 
cosmic radiation and meteorites, so one of the important 
functions of a lunar base is to protect its people against those 
type of harsh conditions. There have been a variety of 
suggestions put forward on the type of lunar base to build, but 
among these, the underground lunar base seems to have the 
distinct advantage of being able to use the surface layer of the 
moon as a barrier against cosmic radiation and meteorites. 
  Based on the above perspective, the Takenaka Corp. has 
proposed a gas-balloon method in which a gas-balloon is inserted 
into the surface of the moon and inflated in such a way as to 
form an underground space. 
  In this paper, we outline the gas-balloon method and discuss 
the proposal in terms of the materials used for the gas-balloon. 
<H3>  1. Technical Problems Faced in Constructing an Underground 
Space on the Moon </H3>
  The first thing that we do when constructing an underground 
space on earth is to drill a narrow vertical space, which in 
construction terminology is called a shaft, and then build an 
underground space at the prescribed depth. In the case of the 
moon, however, we cannot expect any cohesion because the soil 
has no water content. This is quite similar to drilling a hole 
in the desert in which the soil cannot hold on its own so the 
drilling surface crumbles. 
  If we drilled a hole into the lunar soil at an angle between 
20 and 30, we would have to drill a shaft having 10 
times the volume of lunar soil in order to drill to the required 
depth. That being the case, we adopted a method in which the 
drilling surface is reinforced using temporary building 
materials such as steel panels and frames. Nevertheless, in 
building the underground lunar base, the following points below 
had to be taken into account because it would be impossible to 
use the same construction methods on the moon as are used on 
earth. 
  (1) Because of the high cost involved in transporting 
materials and machinery from earth to the moon, we feel it would 
be better to limit the use of large drilling equipment and 
temporary materials used in building surface reinforcements. 
  (2) Working in the harsh lunar environment is extremely 
dangerous, so we advise a method of construction that is 
predicated on small workloads and short work periods. 
<H5>  2. Gas-Balloon Construction Method Outlined </H5>
  As we have illustrated in Figure 1, the gas-balloon 
construction method involves building and maintaining an 
underground space by inflating a gas-balloon by means of gas 
pressure. After the balloon is inflated, the living quarters 
inside the underground lunar base are filled with air having the 
same atmospheric pressure as earth (1 atm). If we assume that 
the specific gravity of the soil on the lunar surface is 2.0, 
and that gravity is 1/6 that of earth, we find that the internal 
pressure (1 atm) of the space and the gravity of the lunar soil 
at upper part of the space achieve a balanced state at 
approximately 30 meters below the surface in the interface 
between the 1-atm space and the lunar soil. This puts very 
little stress on the materials used for the interface and allows 
a space to be obtained that has excellent durability and 
structural stability. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-17A>  Figure 1.  Caricature of Gas Balloon Method </FIG>



  Below, we list some of the basic reasons for constructing an 
underground space using gas pressure. 
  (a) A gas-balloon will inflate according to the pressure of 
the gas that is introduced into it. 
  (b) A gas-balloon starts to inflate by passive destruction 
of 
the soil in the area near the gas balloon. In Figure 2, we 
illustrate the equation for passive destruction of the soil 
surrounding the gas-balloon. For example, the initial pressure 
(Pi) with a hemisphere having a 2.5 m radius can be found in 
Table 1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  (c) The expansion process of the gas-balloon follows both 
Boyles and Charles laws. 
  (1) P[.sup]g[/] x V[.sub]g[/] 
= N[.sup]g[/] x R x 
T[.sup]g[/] 
  Here, P[.sup]g[/] is the internal pressure of 
the gas-balloon, V[.sup]g[/] the volumetric 
capacity of the gas-balloon, N[.sup]g[/] the 
number of gas moles within the gas-balloon, R the gas 
constant, and T[.sup]g[/] the temperature of the 
gas balloon. 
  In Figure 3, we show a model of the process of opening up 
the 
underground space by gas-balloon. By introducing an initial 
pressure (P[.sup]i[/]) into the gas-balloon at a 
prescribed setting that causes a passive destruction of the 
surrounding soil, the gas-balloon forces aside the surrounding 
soil and starts to inflate. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-17C>           Figure 3. Inflation Process of Gas Balloon </FIG>



  After starting the inflation process, the gas-balloon 
continues to expand by controlling the incoming gas pressure and 
keeping it at a higher level than the external pressure 
(P[.sup]o[/]) working on the gas-balloon, i.e., 
the soil pressure from the surrounding soil. After the 
underground space is formed to the desired size, a balance is 
created between the gas pressure inside the balloon and the 
external pressure working on the balloon, i.e., soil pressure 
from the surrounding soil. 
  The gas-balloon construction method offers the following 
features: 
  (a) It requires no major drilling work because the 
construction is done by means of gas pressure. 
  (b) It can reduce the amount of temporary construction 
materials and work required for construction by maintaining the 
space by means of gas pressure inside the balloon until the 
construction work on the structures inside the base are complete. 
  (c) It can reduce the amount of structural materials used by 
counting the gas pressure used to maintain the space as part of 
the actual structure. 
<H5>  3. Proposals Concerning Gas-Balloon Materials </H5>
  In the gas-balloon construction method, a base is built 
within an underground space that is formed by balancing external 
pressures such as soil pressure with the gas pressure of the 
balloon. When a gas-balloon is used that is made with an elastic 
material such as rubber, the gas pressure within the balloon 
must be maintained at a certain minimum level until such time 
that the building of structures bearing external pressures such 
as the soil pressure are complete. For that reason, a 
complicated gas control mechanism is required that can account 
for the workers and materials entering and leaving the complex 
gas-balloon during the time that the structure is being built. 
Based on that, the construction process is expected to be quite 
complex. In order to solve this problem, we proposed that a 
superplastic alloy be used for the gas-balloon material. 
  (1) Superplastic Alloy Gas-Balloon 
  When the temperature and distortion rate of a metal having 
an 
isometric and extremely fine crystal grain structure reaches 
certain levels, the material begins to deform with much less 
stress than it would normally, and indicates a high elasticity 
(superplastic deformation). By controlling this elasticity, it 
becomes possible not to cause large differences in strength and 
mechanical properties before and after superplastic deformation. 
  In Figure 4, we show the gas pressure and temperature 
control 
patterns when a gas-balloon made from a superplastic alloy is 
used. By keeping the temperature in the superplasticity region, 
the superplastic gas-balloon is inflated by gas pressure in the 
same way that a gas-balloon made from a material such as rubber 
would do. When the desired space has been formed and the gas 
pressure adjusted so that the inflation stops and the 
superplastic gas-balloon cools, the balloon loses its plasticity 
and recovers its mechanical properties as a metal. As a result, 
the construction of the base becomes extremely easy if the space 
can be maintained by the material strength of the gas-balloon 
itself. 



  (2) Prototype of Superplastic Alloy Gas Balloon 
  We prototyped a superplastic gas-balloon using the prototype 
equipment shown in Figure 5 by sandwiching together two 1.6mm 
thick panels made of an aluminum-based superplastic alloy 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-18A>  Figure 4.  Pressure and Temperature Control Patterns... </FIG>

(AA7475). In Photograph 1 [photograph not reproduced], we show a 
longitudinal view of the inflation process of the prototype 
superplastic gas-balloon. Superplastic deformation in the upper 
panel began as N2 flowed in under superplastic temperatures, and 
60 minutes after gas pressurization began, a space was formed 
with a dome height/base of 0.71. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-18B>           Figure 5. Superplastic Balloon Prototype </FIG>



<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  When we consider the harshness of the lunar surface, the 
possibility of a lunar base seems almost impossible. Therefore, 
the gas-balloon method could be one of the more effective ways 
of building an underground lunar base. 
  Nonetheless, there are quite a number of technical problems 
that still remain to be solved before the gas-balloon method can 
be implemented practically, so we would like to see future 
research tackle these problems.

  [Text] Beginning with Fujitsu, six leading electronics 
firms plan to implement the Ground Self Defense Force Command 
System. Partial operation will begin next March at the Northern 
District Supervisory Office (Sapporo). The system uses the 
latest computer and communication technology and allows the 
commander to rapidly transmit precise commands. Given the 
constraints on the primary facilities budget, defense sales at 
each company are falling. Since contracts for the Ground Self 
Defense Force Command System project long-term, stable income at 
the scale of several billion yen annually, this will probably 
become a valuable source of earnings in the industry. 
  The Ground Self Defense Force Command System will be 
introduced as one link in information and communication system 
facilities known as C[.sup]3[/]I (Command, Control, 
Communication, and Intelligence). Fujitsu is the main 
contractor. In addition, NEC, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Denki, Hitachi 
Seiyakusho, and Oki Electric Installation Ltd. are participating 
in the development. About 10 billion yen is budgeted for fiscal 
years 1991 through 1993. The start of operation at the Northern 
District Supervisory Office will be the first shot at its 
implementation. 
  The initial plan forecasted an annual budget of 20 billion 
yen up to the 100 billion yen needed to complete the system. 
However, due to constraints on the defense budget, this is 
expected to drop dramatically in scale. Nevertheless, orders of 
several billion yen per year will support defense-related 
electronics firms. 
  Although the Air Self Defense Force and Maritime Self 
Defense 
Force already operate command systems that use computers, the 
Ground Self Defense Force that has bases scattered throughout 
the country was late in establishing facilities. Since a reason 
stated for the victory in the Gulf War was the C[.sup]3[/]I 
system of the United States, this is one more field the Defense 
Agency regards as important. After 1994, the objective is to 
continue to expand the system to the Eastern District 
Supervisory Office. 
  In the future, the plan is to set up computers in the Army 
and in occupied regions and to connect operations by light 
communications. General-purpose products are used for the 
hardware, but the performance features like transmission speed 
and maintaining security will become important in the software. 
  The Fujitsu's Defense Division manages the charged 
electronic 
devices for P3C anti-submarine devices and P3C ground support 
system equipment. Total contracts for 1991 reached &yen;38 
billion. However, cutbacks are expected in the primary equipment 
budget to hold the 1993 budget to around &yen;33 billion. While 
the Ground Self Defense Force System that belongs to the Rear 
Division is expected to be stabilized in future budgets and will 
become the core of defense-related business at Fujitsu.

<F P=106> Article by Toshimasa Makino, Vice President of Ship </F>
Ironworks and Defense Division, Sumitomo Heavy Industries 
  [Text] Although being asked to write a piece for the ``Free 
Talk'' column in Defense Technology is a great honor, 
as a person who was in the midst of the business of civilian 
demand until several months ago, I actually feel somewhat lost. 
However, because national defense is very important to the 
country, I consented because of the benefits of having a 
connection to the technology through my work. 
  Examining recent economic trends, a little anxiety is 
apparent. The media has complacently offered discussions on the 
widespread stagnation in consumption and uneven distribution of 
money following the collapse of the inflated economy, the 
unbalance between supply and demand by excess equipment, or the 
absence of required purchases. However, the clear-cut reason is 
simply that the economy has not recovered. I feel that the 
positive aspects must be stressed and lead in that direction. 
  I still clearly remember that a few years ago the media 
primarily tended to discount the importance of manufacturing 
industries. As a result, a large number of university students 
studying science and technology looked for jobs at securities 
companies, banks, and distribution companies. At the time, 
university professors frowned upon this. In a country like Japan 
that is populous but poor in natural resources, manufacturing 
industries are usually very active. It is important for them to 
form the basis for expanding the country's economy and enrich 
the citizens' lives. 
  Technology is usually important in stimulating manufacturing 
industries. The direct connection to development technology, 
production technology, and management technology will become 
increasingly important and an injection of human resources may 
be needed. In addition, society will probably need to be 
educated. The most important element is for technical workers to 
endeavor to keep their places of activity accessible, this is 
directed in particular at new technical workers. 
  Based on the conditions in product output to the conditons 
in 
market input, positioning the origin of ideas on the development 
of civilian goods in what is normally called the ``market,'' 
undertaking the preparation of technology seeds, realizing key 
technologies, and surveying market needs, and product planning 
are continuing. 
  Since market needs in the defense industry are often 
shrouded 
by secrecy, manufacturers find it difficult to understand all of 
the needs beforehand. Because extra time is needed during 
development and hasty conclusions lead to the inevitable fear of 
inefficiencies, trying to conduct a few more discussions among 
the concerned parties is needed. 
  Recently, the fundamental and honest view is to return to 
the 
origin. Education is influenced by the ebb and flow of the 
country and technology supports this. 
  As a technologist, I would like to fundamentally and 
honestly 
return to the correct origin and , without being boastful, to 
cope with these circumstances. To solidly maintain the nation's 
security in the future, I would like to work hard and to guide 
technology studies.

<F P=106> [Conversation between Taizou Terashima, President, Fujitsu </F>
System Integration Laboratories and Touru Yamashita, Chairman, 
Defense Technology Foundation] 
  [Text]Yamashita: First, congratulations on 
assuming your position as president. I've heard that Fujitsu 
System Integration Laboratories has very close ties to the 
Self-Defense Force. When I worked at the Technical Research and 
Development Institute of the Defense Agency, I met a member of 
the Ground Self Defense Force who had excellent technical 
knowledge. So after you retired, I was interested upon hearing 
of your returning to work at this company. Beginning with the 
unique technologies from Fujitsu, new civilian technologies are 
introduced in rapid succession and future contributions are 
anticipated in the modernization of defense systems. I look 
forward to hearing your thoughts on future trends in today's 
theme of ``Defense Technology After the Cold War.'' 
  First, this is the end of the Cold War, The Defense of 
Japan (1992 edition) begins by noting that ``the East-West 
confrontation spanned over 40 years.'' Looking at the defense 
chronology at the end of the book, we see Churchill's ``Iron 
Curtain'' speech in 1946, the North Atlantic Treaty taking 
effect in August 1948, the signing of the Warsaw Pact in 1955, 
the unification of Germany in October 1990, and the dissolution 
of the Warsaw Pact Organization (WPO) in March 1991. What in 
fact was the East-West confrontation? The country as individuals 
or as a human society must revise its idea about what is the 
ideology. This is the same as the path taken by Japan since the 
Meiji Era. We are probably at the point of awaiting the 
decisions of future historians and cannot ignore this as has 
been done in the past. Contemporary problems also exist on the 
periphery. 
  Terashima: Since World War II, the world has not 
only advanced militarily, but political, social, economic, 
cultural, scientific, and technical advances are also evident. 
In addition, I believe various other elements are apparent. As 
for the military in the East-West confrontation, a mutual 
endless expansion of military strength continued and competition 
ensued. This brought about a nuclear stalemate. Moreover, on the 
Soviet side that was challenged by the Strategic Defense 
Initiative of the United States, Gorbachev, who recognized the 
link to collapse if the ruined domestic economy were neglected, 
advocated a new way of diplomatic thought called perestroika. 
This drastically altered East-West relationships. The situation 
at that time was to dismantle WPO and for each NATO country to 
seriously examine arms reduction. Then, the collapse of the 
previous world order of two superpowers has immediately lead to 
the problems of outbreaks of regional low-intensity strife 
rooted in ethnic and religious problems, refugee and displaced 
persons problems, United Nations Peace Keeping Operation 
activities, economic stagnation in other countries, growing 
unemployment, strong variety of military weapons exports to 
protect defense industries, anxiety about the outward flow of 
nuclear technology from the former Soviet Union, North- South 
problems, and worldwide economic blocs, like GATT. This 
resembles various illnesses arising when the physical strength 
of the human body weakens. However, there is no cure, so won't 
this unstable situation continue for now? 
  Yamashita: It will probably be that way as we 
enter the 21st century. 
  Terashima: As you have stated, although each 
country is groping for a new order, a rather long period is 
needed until this will be established. 
  Yamashita: What are the spin offs, the fruits of 
the Cold War era, that contributed socially and economically to 
humanity? Well, first, there are the peaceful uses of nuclear 
power, communications by artificial satellites, investigations 
of resources, atmospheric observations, astronomical 
observations, computer developments, simulators, trainers, 
lightweight structure materials, large-scale high-speed 
transport means (large-scale jets), lasers, milliwaves, system 
engineering techniques come to mind, but interest probably arose 
unexpectedly. We will probably thoroughly investigate this in 
the future. 
  Terashima: With different objectives for military 
affairs, the uses of nuclear energy and space are advances of 
the science and technology in the 20th century and are 
considered to be miraculous in the course of human history. 
However, will the future development of epoch-making science and 
technology be likely? Or instead, will current technology 
advance along the lines of becoming faster, smaller, or bigger? 
Essentially, there are no national borders for technology, but 
this was not so during the traditional East-West confrontation. 
Since the speed of the change in the era became the quickness of 
sharing technology, a variety of technologies in new fields of 
the future will probably appear. 
<H5>  Arms Reduction That Questions the Modernization of Quality </H5>
  Yamashita: Next, I would like to discuss military 
affairs. First, would you explain the arms reduction plans of 
the advanced western European countries? 
  Terashima: Every year the Defense Agency releases 
a defense white paper called Japan's Defense; it has 
already been published this year. By the time this conversation 
appears, I believe it will be available at ordinary bookstores. 
So I urge the readers to purchase and read it. I'll briefly 
discuss what the white paper describes in detail. 
  As seen in the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation 
Talks 
II (SALT II) treaty by the United States and the Soviet Union 
and the taking effect of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces 
in Europe (CFE), the control of armaments and arms reduction is 
progressing worldwide; this trend will probably continue in the 
future. The United States is moving towards the total 
elimination of peacetime nuclear war arms, except for the 
portion loaded on airplanes, and will reduce strategic nuclear 
forces to one-third in the next 10 years. The plan is to reduce 
the Army which currently numbers 1.77 million people to 1.4 
million, the Navy to 413 ships and 12 aircraft carriers, the Air 
Force to 13.3 combat air corps. However, in this case, 
maintaining adaptability, maintaining highly skilled soldiers, 
and supplying and developing technologically superior equipment 
are important. Attention should be paid to preserving the 
attitude of not slowing the speed of modernization. 
  In contrast, reflecting the changing domestic situation in 
Russia, the security guarantee policy is not clear. Although 
long-term trends in arms reduction and arms preparation are not 
clear, it's apparent that efforts are being made to curtail the 
total military force of the Russian army by enacting a law to 
keep it within 1% of the population (1.5 million people). 
But a 
note of caution is a huge Far East Russian Army exists. 
Certainly, there is a substantive decreasing trend, but 
qualitative strengthening and modernization trends in the army, 
navy, and air force are remarkable. Based on the New War 
Strategic Concept at NATO, a 20% reduction in the military 
force is expected. With this as the basis, various plans are 
being designed in each country. China can reduce the military 
force of its army, however, every year national defense spending 
is increasing significantly. This current situation is a great 
deal of effort is being put into the navy and air force in 
particular. 
  This trend in arms reduction progresses in response to the 
state of affairs in the national power of each nation. Attention 
must be paid so that the reduction is not haphazard. Also, the 
fact that modernization will proceed steadily without lowering 
quality during the reduction will not be overlooked. 
  Yamashita: Next, will you speak on Japan's defense 
policy that is affected by new changes in the international 
situation. If this addressed in the white paper, could you give 
us an overview? 
  Terashima: Until now, Japan has maintained 
suitable defensive strength as well as firmly maintaining the 
Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the 
United States of America and a defense system to respond to 
aggression in any situation. As a result, preventing aggression 
beforehand is the basis of the defense policy. When defensive 
strength is thought of as fundamental defensive strength, 
mid-term prevention measures are decided on and the preparations 
continue each year. With the world having undergone major 
changes, I feel we should seriously examine whether following 
the same line of thinking as before is appropriate. The Defense 
Agency is probably examining the defensive military preparations 
and national defense for beyond 1996. When I look at the 
conditions surrounding Japan, I believe we must maintain the 
concept of ``providing the required minimum defensive force and 
firmly maintaining the Japan-United States security system.'' 
Furthermore, policies on international contributions to improve 
Japan's status should be considered more. Also, even with tight 
budgets, improving technology to support modernization and 
providing equipment should not be taken lightly. 
  Yamashita: We well understand that Japan's 
security system will be maintained in the future and given this 
base, Japan's defense will provide and maintain equipment. 
Whether you like it or not, this kind of misleading statement 
probably exists. Since the arrival of Commodore Perry's ships in 
1853, the occupation of the Philippines and Guam by the United 
States in 1898, and the open door policy towards China in 1899, 
increased concern about the Pacific Ocean regions of the United 
States collided with Japan as a rising power that advanced 
behind the great powers of Western Europe, then came war between 
Japan and the United States followed by Japan's defeat. After 
that time, the security of Japan depended on the United States. 
Undivided attention given to economic recovery and today Japan 
has reached the position of the second nation behind the United 
States in GNP. During the Cold War, Japan supported the global 
war strategy of the United States as one member on Western 
Europe's side and functioned as a good partner. While spiteful 
comments like Japan is a country dependent on the United States, 
the mutually close relationship for over 40 years does not stop 
at the governmental level. There are close ties in social, 
economic, and cultural fields. However, the current situation 
presents an agenda of making adjustments between governments and 
conditions related to the cultural and social systems of the 
whole country like the structural barriers capable of developing 
interference in the internal politics of other countries and 
major problems. 
  Although it is criticized by western European countries of 
placing too much emphasis on Asia in the ODA, Japan will 
continue to work earnestly as a partner of the Western Europe of 
freedom and capitalism. Caution and skepticism has already 
arisen in other Asian countries. So without the participation of 
the United States, Japan cannot establish prospects for security 
in the Pacific region. Consequently, from the perspective of 
history, economics, society, politics, and diplomacy, Japan's 
global partnership with the United States must be preserved. But 
one point of concern is ``The Strategic Framework for Asia and 
the Pacific Region'' in the white paper (1991 and 1992 
editions). This is in the report presented by the U.S. 
Department of Defense (DOD) to Congress in April 1990. The fifth 
item describes the relationship to Japan and the importance of 
supporting interoperability is extolled in the fourth item. In 
terms of time, this is just after you assumed the position of 
chairman of the Joint Staff Council. 
  According to the translation of the fourth item, ``By 
encouraging maximum procurement from the United States, 
increasing the back flow of technology, and avoiding as much as 
possible developing systems that are not supplemented, emphasis 
is placed on the importance of maintaining the interoperability 
of weapons.'' People involved in research and development on 
equipment for the Self Defense Force, planning for modernization 
and providing higher level operation, the members of this 
foundation, and readers of this magazine are probably concerned. 
Therefore, the third topic will move to technology. The problem 
of equipment is the problem of procurement. This is a major 
concern of each company that is a corporate member. The Defense 
Equipment Procurement Meeting and the Defense Production 
Technology Meeting held by the Equipment Director are in the 
process of examining this issue. In addition, because the Japan 
Defense Equipment Industry is enthusiastically performing 
research, let's skip this. I would like to hear about what would 
be good to accept concerning the interoperability mentioned 
earlier. 
<H5>  Broad Interoperability Expected </H5>
  Terashima: When Japan and the United States 
collaborate on strategy, the problem of interoperability is not 
important from the perspective of the rationalization of the 
maintenance and operation of a defense system. So all of the 
equipment should not be the same as that of the US military nor 
should domestic development and domestic procurement be stopped. 
The state of affairs in the Japan and the United States differ 
and the doctrines on warfare differ. The physiques of the troops 
also differ. As a result, our troops must be provided with 
equipment suited to them. If products made in the United States 
serve this need, I believe they can be used. 
  There is the phrase ``technology check'' should be thought 
of 
as being linked to checking the promotion of the development of 
technology and the maintenance of technology that can be boasted 
about in the world. Strength in technology is useful as 
bargaining power in negotiations with foreign countries. 
Interoperability is a widely known concept. The plan for the 
integration related to interoperation not simply for equipment 
but for doctrine, education, and training. The one-sided plan 
for only using equipment from the United States is not possible. 
  Yamashita: Yes, that's true. I agree 
wholeheartedly, but my concerns or misgivings are not completely 
dispelled. Hypothetically, agreement is possible, but 
specifically how is this accomplished. If I don't hear them, I 
cannot be reassured. 
  Terashima: How will interoperability proceed 
between Japan and the United States? Well, the next mid-term 
defense that begins in 1996 will probably take this up. However, 
this problem is not simply defense, it is closely related to 
economic problems in Japan and the United States. Moreover, this 
is a serious problem because the aggressiveness of the United 
States may be strong. I would like a policy to be decided that 
stands at the source of defense. 
  Yamashita: This is long in coming. Scholars, 
critics, and the mass media are busy exchanging a profusion of 
critiques and editorials that exchange speculations. 
Unfortunately, for some reason public opinion is formed based on 
this. Therefore, given the principle of democracy, public 
opinion influences the government. The Defense Agency is 
actively performing recent public relations activities. 
Securitarian, the PR bulletin, has been well 
received. The amount of information related to national defense 
is minute compared to the flow through the mass media. 
  Returning to the discussion on technology, Mr. H. F., a 
military critic, who often criticizes the Self Defense Force, 
has recently written ``America's technical strategy was embossed 
in FS-X negotiations. In order to continue to maintain their 
country's monopolistic position, it must hold down Japan. At the 
same time, high tech in Japan is integrated into the US's 
advanced military system production and used as subcontracts. 
Don't release our country's technology, but take what can be 
taken. This is America's strategy.'' In the RIPS letter 
(published 10/15/91 by the Peace and Security Laboratory), 
presenting the source code of the FS-X continues to be refused. 
It has also been pointed out that while the United States 
regulates the outflow of military technology to Japan, 
technology transfer from Japan is planned. The article 
Foreign Policy (Spring 1989) from the same journal 
introduced the following some time ago in a book. It stated, 
``The increase in the degree of dependence on the United States 
for Japan's military technology cannot be avoided in the long 
term. Nevertheless, I hope Japan's technology can be controlled 
as much as possible for the security of the United States. In 
contrast, major restrictions must be added when American 
military technology is transferred to Japan...Strategic 
bargaining with Japan will become a major external problem in 
the future.'' This was an observation of Mr. Ferguson, Science 
and Technology Adviser during the Bush administration. Even 
though he does not belong to the current Clinton administration, 
until this administration's point of view is made public, we can 
only contemplate what the understanding may be. 
  Although I forgot the source, I saw an article that 
presented 
the American view that the FS-X and joint research between Japan 
and the United States is not essential to the United States, but 
they have meaning as symbols of future technological cooperation 
between Japan and the United States. Also in decisions between 
the governments related to national security, the circumstances 
that led to joint development of the FS-X and details on the 
decision are still not clear and are probably matters for 30 
years in the future. While people in the government can find out 
what they need to know, this is not the case for businessman. 
Major risks are assumed with each strategic business decision. 
The reason is Japan Inc. (the term used overseas to criticize 
private and public Japanese organizations) must be in good 
shape. Although the Hosokawa administration will severe the 
union between private and public by abolishing various 
regulations and plan to actively expand domestic demand, and 
lower the black-ink balance, various problems remain. What do 
you think will happen in technical cooperation or joint research 
between Japan and the United States? 
<H5>  Efforts to Check the Proliferation of Weapons </H5>
  Terashima: As you stated earlier, from the 
perspective of checking technology or the effectiveness of 
technological power as bargaining power, the development Japan's 
own technology must be continually planned. When you consider 
that the Japan-United States security system will be closer and 
the huge expenses in weapons development are accumulating, more 
importance must be placed in the future on technological 
cooperation and joint research. However, this does not mean 
proceeding haphazardly. Japan's stance should be to make a 
comprehensive decision on independent technological strength and 
select a theme. The action program of the global partnership at 
the summit between the heads of Japan and the United States 
presents specific items for joint research, including the ducted 
rocket engine. We should see this advance further in the future. 
  Yamashita: The road has opened for providing 
military technology to the United States because of ``the 
critical importance of maintaining effective operation of the 
Japan-U.S. security system in plans for mutual technology 
exchange with the United States in the defense area,'' ``the 
adherence to the objectives of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,'' 
and ``the instrumental position in peace and security in Japan 
and the Far East.'' The Diet resolution on upholding the Three 
Principles on Military Weapons Export will probably be strictly 
observed in the future, but today after the end of the East-West 
confrontation, various countries in Western Europe have worked 
diligently to export weapons without concern about its 
appearance and are planning to maintain and preserve the defense 
industry. This stirs up intense strife in underdeveloped 
countries. The activity of the United Nations' Peacekeeping 
Operation is to squelch this. 
  Terashima: The proliferation of weapons throughout 
the world is a very dangerous problem and must be seriously 
addressed. Shouldn't our country aggressively appeal to the 
world and not take the passive position because it does not 
export weapons? Concerning the future of Japan's equipment and 
technology, I heard that serious discussions took place at two 
recent meetings proposed by the Equipment Bureau director and I 
expect them to be reflected in the next term defense. 
  Yamashita: As you stated, nothing else is so 
anticipated. The North Korean missile that has a range of 1,000 
km also camouflages nuclear capabilities and presents a major 
threat to Japan. According to the newspapers, measures to 
address this were influenced by the United States. I remember 
seeing an article where the research results of Japanese 
industry in early SDI research received high marks in the United 
States. Indeed, what will it be in the future? Of course, joint 
research not only produces joint reform and conflicts with the 
Three Principles of Weapons Export, it is capable of advancing 
the discussion on the principle of collective self defense. 
Fundamentally, this is probably a constitutional question. I 
would like the Constitution to take up expressions whose 
interpretations are not understood. We have passed scheduled 
time, so I would like to thank you for taking the time to talk 
to us.

  [Text]Objectives 
  Based on revised mid-term plans for the defense capacity 
provisions (1991-95), efforts will be made to complete one stage 
of technical research and development. To contribute to 
improving support at the qualitative level of defense capacity, 
in addition to seriously examining remarkable advances in the 
latest technology, the promotion of cooperative relationships 
between Japan and the United States in research and development 
will be considered and the technical R&amp;D position will be 
refined. In the business choices that must be reconciled, their 
importance and priority are carefully weighed and efforts are 
made to promote critical and efficient technical R&amp;D.

<F P=106> [Forward by Toru Yamashita, chairman, Defense Technology </F>
Foundation] 
  [Text] I hope you noticed the new format of the August 
issue of the ``Boei Gijutsu Journal'' that has just come out. I 
would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the 
journal for publishing my inaugural remarks upon becoming 
chairman of the foundation in the May issue of the journal last 
year. I plan to work even harder than before on making the Boei 
Gijutsu Journal a magazine that is for and by the members of the 
foundation, so I request the support, cooperation, and 
understanding of all members. 
  It has been a little more than a year since I became 
chairman, and in that time the editorial staff working under the 
leadership of executive director Yasuo Imai has held numerous 
discussions about the magazine. We have also had help from 
people with previous editorial experience in the private sector 
who were kind enough to share their knowledge with us. The 
director of the foundation, Izumi Tomita, who took on his new 
job last year, also offered help in consolidating the new 
editorial policies and helping with the new layout. Once that 
was done, we started collecting manuscripts, and finally in 
August sent copies of the magazine to foundation members. 
  We would like to see the magazine used not only as a 
resource 
for members to obtain a clear picture of defense technologies in 
Japan today, but also used as a forum for exchanging technical 
information between the public and private sector for the 
benefit of its members. We also would like to see it play a role 
in improving the technical potential for achieving qualitative 
superiority in defense hardware and equipment. 
  From the mid-18th century until today, there has not been a 
single year in which there has not been an armed conflict of one 
kind or another in the world, and since the end of World War II 
there have been more than 100 such armed conflicts in one place 
or another around the world. The words spoken at the time of the 
Roman Empire that ``if you want peace, prepare for war'' are 
just as relevant today as they were back then. There have been 
signs recently of a full-scale debate taking place in Japan 
pertaining to Japan's security arrangement. I believe that this 
debate should also include a discussion of technology as well. 
  From the view of security arrangements for the 21st century, 
I think we should welcome a clarification of the policies that 
go with maintaining and developing an industrial base and 
technology base for producing and developing defense arms and 
equipment. If this is done, a widespread consensus can be 
expected to emerge among the people of Japan. 
  It is my hope that the members of the foundation will not 
only be actively involved in contributing articles to the newly 
formatted magazine but will also take time to express their 
opinions as well.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion between Sachio Uehara (SU), division </F>
manager, Technical Research Division; Toru Yamashita (TY), 
chairman, Defense Technology Foundation; Izumi Tomita (IT), 
director, Defense Technology Foundation; and Yasuo Imai (YI), 
executive director, Defense Technology Foundation] 
  [Text] TY: There seems to be a trend taking 
place worldwide due to the end of the cold war for countries to 
cut back on military spending. A review of Japan's mid-term 
defense budget would seem to suggest that the end of the cold 
war has also had a major impact on the defense industry in Japan 
such as can be seen in the reduction of attack weapons. 
Recently, two roundtable forums, each headed up by the chief of 
the Bureau of Equipment, were formed to discuss defense arms 
purchases and defense industry technologies. The two groups will 
be exchanging views on the future of the defense industry and 
defense technologies with knowledgeable people from both inside 
and outside the Defense Agency. I really feel that the timing in 
forming these two groups could not have come at a better time. 
  In that context, I wonder if we could begin our discussion 
by 
looking at what the real advantages are in doing R&amp;D and 
developing our own technologies in Japan. With that in mind, I 
would like to begin by asking Mr. Uehara to give us his views on 
the future trends in technology, particularly as it pertains to 
defense-related technologies. Would you first start by giving us 
an overview of the Technical Research and Development Institute 
(TRDI), its organizational structure, staffing, average age, 
level of education, and number of exchange students from Japan 
and elsewhere, and so forth. 
  SU: As far as our current organizational structure 
is concerned, there is a general affairs department that handles 
overall administration of the entire division, a planning 
department that handles R&amp;D planning and technical surveys, 
and 
a technical research department. In addition to these, there are 
four other development departments that have been established as 
implementation structures for ``ground,'' ``sea,'' ``air,'' and 
``guided weapons.'' There are a total of five research 
institutes, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th research institutes, 
that oversee element research, and also two branch offices, one 
in Iioka and the other in Kawasaki. The TRDI also has five test 
labs which are located in Sapporo, Shimokita, Tsuchiura, 
Niijima, and Gifu and are used to test and evaluate new 
technologies. 
  The staff is divided according to whether they are 
technical, 
administrative, or self-defense force personnel. R&amp;D related 
personnel include 564 research specialists and another 242 key 
self-defense force people. R&amp;D support personnel total 1,185. 
That number includes 52 people working in either self-defense or 
administrative posts, and 327 people in management, so that 
means that 70%-75% of the personnel working at 
headquarters 
consist of R&amp;D personnel. When we look at the individual 
R&amp;D 
departments, we find that more than half the staff are assigned 
to one of either two departments, namely, telecommunication 
(34%) or machinery (24%). The remainder are 
employed in either 
the aeronautics (11%), physics (9%), chemistry 
(5%), or 
marine (5%) departments. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-25A>           Pie Chart Showing Current Staffing By R&amp;D field </FIG>



  As of 1 June this year, the average age of an administrative 
employee was 40.04, and that of a research specialist was 41.06. 
That figure has been gradually decreasing over the past few 
years as the institute has sought to hire younger employees. In 
terms of academic qualifications, excluding Self-Defense Force 
officers, there are 93 people who hold doctorate degrees and 
another 227 people with master's degrees. 
  In terms of the staff taking part in exchange programs from 
inside Japan and elsewhere, there are at the present time six 
foreigners here doing doctoral work and another two who are part 
of an organizational exchange program. With 14 people pursuing 
doctorate degrees and another 10 seeking master's degrees, there 
has also been a noticeable increase in the number of people from 
within Japan who are taking part in exchange programs. 
  TY: Next, let's shift our attention to budget 
matters including R&amp;D expenses, payroll, and general 
overhead of 
the facility. I know this will be an important issue in the 
future, so I would like to ask what your plans are for 
recruiting recent college graduates and training these people? 
  SU: Before we talk about that, let's look at the 
number of research papers that have been published outside the 
institute. There were 90 papers published in 1989, 113 in 1990, 
107 in 1991, 118 in 1992. That figure has averaged more than 100 
papers a year. It is somewhat less than the figure for national 
research institutes which average about 134.7 papers a year, but 
I do feel we have done pretty well. 
  TY: I've heard that certain academic groups are 
refusing to publish papers from the TRDI, so I would like to ask 
you which academic groups are publishing your research papers. 
  SU: Well, first of all, there is the aeronautics 
group and the telecommunication group, and recently more and 
more papers are being published by foreign academic groups. This 
has resulted in the registration of industrial property rights 
including both patents and utility models. There were 152 
applications filed in 1989 and 68 of these were registered. In 
1992, 89 out of 97 applications were registered. It seemed at 
the time as if almost every application would be registered. I 
think that the future looks rather bright when viewed from this 
perspective. 
  Now, in terms of the TRDI budget, the budget has been 
growing 
at an annual rate of 10%-20%. It went from 
&yen;92.1 billion 
in 1989 to &yen;136.0 billion in 1993. The greatest part of that 
increase was R&amp;D expenses which climbed from &yen;82.8 
billion 
in 1989 to &yen;123.8 billion in 1993. Overhead expenses also 
rose from &yen;1.8 billion in 1989 to &yen;3.0 billion in 1993. 
I think that this strongly suggests how much more emphasis has 
been placed on the TRDI than on other military facilities. 
  In terms of hiring, the TRDI hired only 13 people in 1989, 
22 
in 1990, 17 in 1991, 23 in 1992, and 23 in 1993. The TRDI has 
been hiring at the rate of more than 20 new people each year. 
  [Main Test and Research Equipment at TRDI: missile 
simulator, 
precision guidance simulator, flight simulator, torpedo 
simulator, domed launch range, explosion-proof rocket firing 
test equipment, fixed ground site for testing armored vehicles, 
high-speed shock equipment, electronic war-games simulator, 
aerodynamic propulsion research facility, and electronic testing 
facility] 
<H5>  Attempts To Internationalize Institute </H5>
  TY: Does the same rule still apply about 
maintaining minimum hiring? 
  SU: It does, but the staff increases since 1992 
have been greater than the staff reductions, and in fact, have 
shown a slight upward tendency. And we are trying to figure out 
the best way to train these new staff members. One of the 
problems is management training. This is because as soon as they 
are hired they are subjected to NPA (National Personnel 
Authority) training, internal bureau training, and TRDI 
training. In the case of TRDI training, a new employee must 
first undergo four days of training by the NPA, then a month of 
initial training for I-type employees, and this is followed by 2 
1/2 months of TRDI training. The TRDI is also being 
internationalized, so a month of training was added last year to 
help develop English conversational skills. This is a privately 
run English conversation school in which new employees enroll. 
We have already started to see some good results from this 
program. 
  TY: I think that's a good idea and we should try 
and see if we can do a better job in advertising that fact. 
  SU: We also train our administrative staff. 
Somewhere between the 6th and 8th year after coming to work for 
the Defense Agency, supervisor level employees must take part in 
a three-week training program sponsored by the NPA, and 
somewhere between the 12th and 15th year, lab directors and 
assistant managers must take part in two weeks of research and 
training. Also, I-type employees at the TRDI with 8-10 years of 
service must go through a three-month management training 
program. In addition to these, we are also offering general 
courses and specialized training at the National Institute for 
Defense Studies for those seeking master's or doctoral degrees. 
We are also sending people to the National Defense Academy for 
postgraduate studies in science and technology, and to the 
National Defense Medical College for postgraduate studies in 
medicine, as well as sending people to corporations for 
training. In the case of staff being sent to corporations, we 
usually send young engineers when we are about to launch a new 
project in order to have them study designs and so forth. As far 
as overseas studies, there are age restrictions (under 30 years 
of age) and candidates have to be screened. The TRDI also has a 
program in which it sends employees with PhDs who are 45 years 
or younger for training at overseas research institutes. These 
employees are more independent, so they can write their papers 
while discussing relevant issues with researchers in overseas 
countries. The benefits of this are that the papers that are 
published in Japan receive recognition and inducements from 
overseas universities. 
  TY: I think that presents an accurate picture, but 
there are some organizational problems in this area as well. 
There are a lot of cases where researchers with PhDs cannot get 
their papers published no matter how hard they try. 
  SU: Recently, though, we have been seeing more and 
more papers being published overseas. I think that this bodes 
well for the future. There is also the chance that we will hear 
nothing from these overseas universities. 
  IT: Are you talking about regular universities or 
military institutes? 
  SU: I'm mainly talking about regular universities 
in the United States. We have nothing going on with military 
institutes. There will be some joint research in the future, 
however, so we may eventually do something with those institutes 
as well. 
  YI: There are some people from the TRDI who are 
taking part in some program at an institute in Canada called the 
National Research Council, aren't there? I believe that the 
Canadian government has provided the institute with money to 
attract top researchers from around the world to come and do 
post-doctoral research. I have also heard of a similar type 
scholarship program in Europe. I believe that having younger 
people from the TRDI taking part in international programs such 
as these will go a long way to making the TRDI more 
international. 
  IT: It wasn't that long ago that we were thinking 
about inviting foreign researchers to the TRDI for one year of 
research, but that project never got off the ground because it 
cost so much money. 
  SU: I think that the cost of taking care of these 
researchers while in Japan is too expensive, and we need to look 
at better ways of doing this. 
  TY: I heard about one case involving a foreign 
researcher who was part of an exchange program at the National 
Defense Academy. The NDA looked at the idea of putting this 
person up in a guest house, but this was too expensive, so they 
used a private apartment instead and made it a short-term 
intensive course. 
  IT: I think it would be nice if the Defense 
Technology Foundation could absorb some of those expenses. By 
the way, what do you think lies ahead for the TRDI in light of 
the end of the cold war, the break-up of the Soviet Union, the 
Persian Gulf War, and the trends in Asia? 
  SU: The effect that the end of the cold war had is 
obvious. I think the Persian Gulf War taught us the following: 
  (1) The importance of continuing to ensure and maintain 
high-quality of defense-related hardware and equipment, that is, 
maintaining technological superiority. 
  (2) The importance of building and regularly using a 
C[.sup]3[/]I system that is able to organically integrate and 
deploy sensors, information, and various types of weapons. 
  (3) The importance of having land, air, and sea transport 
capabilities that enable large quantities of troops and 
equipment to be transported quickly to places in Japan in times 
of emergency, and if possible, organizing this according to 
geographical regions. 
  We are also paying special attention to Asian countries, 
especially as it pertains to the removal of U.S. military 
forces, increases in national defense spending starting with 
China and North Korea, and the progress they are making in 
modernizing arms. I think one of the areas where we ought to be 
paying special attention to is in starting to emphasize R&amp;D 
for 
maintaining technological superiority even in the face of 
military reductions by advanced European countries and the 
United States. On the other hand, we are looking to join up with 
international technical associations in order to compensate for 
the cutbacks in national defense spending and still meet our 
R&amp;D 
goals. I think that this would enable us to share the risks and 
costs, marshal our technologies, and strengthen the bonds with 
those organizations. Under those circumstances, Japan must adopt 
policies that are based, and essentially preserve, the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. It must try to do more in the way of 
providing host nation support, conducting joint training 
exercises between the United States and Japan, and bolstering 
the alliance through technical cooperation including joint 
R&amp;D. 
  Looking at the policies adopted in the current mid-term 
defense plans of the TRDI, we can see the effect that this line 
of thinking has had in the section entitled ``Outline of Defense 
Spending'' regarding main weapons in which it talks about 
``innovating and modernizing equipment based mainly on achieving 
stipulated levels, ...and seeking to further beef up 
behind-the-scenes areas such as technical R&amp;D,'' and also in 
another place in which it mentions ``perfecting advanced 
elementary technologies.'' Therefore, I think we must generally 
keep the following things in mind when planning R&amp;D: 
  (1) That our highest priority, in addition to being in 
charge 
of R&amp;D for the SDF, is taking R&amp;D requests made by 
military 
operations. 
  (2) That we must make improvements and refinements so that 
we 
can modernize existing military equipment to keep up with the 
advances made in technology and the changes in the military 
environment. 
  (3) That R&amp;D on advanced elementary technologies be 
done with 
foresight based on advances in technology. 
  IT: What are the main R&amp;D items that the TRDI will 
be engaged in the future? 
  SU: In the area of aviation, we're working on the 
prototype (4th) of an FS-X next-generation support fighter. This 
is the largest prototype that we have built so far, and we 
expect to be able to do a maiden flight by 1995. Next, we're 
working on a prototype (1st) of a new miniature observation 
helicopter. As a successor to the OH-6D, it will be used by 
either anti-tank helicopter units or division flying units to do 
reconnaissance work, issue warnings, or aerial command and 
control, and will be the first helicopter developed by the TRDI. 
Another project involves the research and prototyping (2nd) of a 
combustion wind tunnel. The tunnel is being built in Higashi 
Chitose and will be used to test the ramjet engines used for 
guided missiles, and to test ducted rockets. The tunnel will 
enable us to ascertain the high-velocity aerodynamic properties 
of items such as the base-bleed shell while being fired inside 
the tunnel. Then, we are engaged in the research and prototyping 
(1st) of a device to test engine performance at high altitudes. 
  YI: When do you think each of these projects will 
be completed? 
  SU: I think in perhaps seven or eight years, but 
when we take into account all the facilities that have to be 
built, it will probably take more time than that. Next, in 
guided weapons-related research, we are prototyping (3rd) a new 
guided fighter missile. The conventional infrared guided missile 
systems used in the Sidewinder and AAM-3 track their targets by 
points, but this new guided missile system will be the first to 
use an image-based guidance system to track its targets. These 
things are incomparably faster than the older antitank missiles 
and short SAM missiles. In other words, both we and the enemy 
are both moving, so the CCD signal processing presents really 
serious problems. It looks like we will be quite hard-pressed in 
developing these technologies. 
  In firearms and military vehicle matters, we are working on 
a 
new fuse for use in mortars. We cannot get a release on the VT 
fuse technology from Great Britain under which the new mortar 
shell is licensed, so we'll have to develop this item on our 
own. The next item involves the research and prototyping (1st) 
of a ground-based robot which is used for land mine processing. 
This is a robot that can skillfully get around different types 
of obstacles. The U.S. and other countries have been working 
exclusively on vehicle-type robots, but the TRDI has been 
working on its own to develop a robot that can perform dangerous 
jobs. This research has also gotten a lot of support from 
various corporations. 
  IT: Do you mean this robot will have the 
capability to detect land mines? 
  SU: The research on land mine detection is being 
done separately. We are looking into ways in which land mines 
can be detected by either infrared radiation, milliwaves, or 
different types of radio waves. 
  IT: Is this part of the joint research work 
between the United States and Japan that the TRDI has been 
involved in? 
  SU: No, it isn't. The robots favored by the United 
States are either self-piloted or auto-loading type robots, so I 
do not know whether the United States has any interest in 
Japanese robot technology or not. It may be that they feel that 
they do not want any of Japan's good technologies, or they may 
feel that their own technology is superior. Now, in warship and 
underwater weapons related matters, we are engaged in the 
research and prototyping (3rd) of the main elements configuring 
a future naval escort. In the area of electronic equipment, we 
are involved in research on sonar for surface ships. Another 
interesting item we are working on is a self-propelled target 
that operates on water. The target is hoisted off a ship by 
helicopter and lowered into the ocean. After being lowered into 
the water, it runs according to a preset program and becomes a 
target for bombs or machine guns from Air Self-Defense Force 
aircraft. The target can be recovered and reused, and is 
programmed so that it can be scuttled. This project is scheduled 
to be ready by 1993. 
<H5>  Japanese Defense Technologies Thin in Many Areas </H5>
  TY: By the way, Mr. Uehara, you mentioned earlier 
about the level of Japanese technology in U.S.-Japan joint 
research. I would like to hear your views about how Japanese 
defense technology stacks up against both European and the U.S. 
defense technology. 
  SU: We are talking here about a variety of 
different technical areas, but taken as a whole, I think that 
U.S. defense technology could be equated to a densely populated 
forest, European defense technology to a regular forest, and 
Japanese defense technology to a sparsely populated forest. I 
think the area where Japan is further ahead is in civilian 
technologies such as semiconductors, composite materials, 
superconductors, and ceramics. The defense-related technologies 
in these areas are quite advanced, and are in no way less 
superior than those in Europe or the United States. When we look 
at each area more closely, however, we see in aircraft, for 
example, that Japan is at about the same level as Europe and the 
United States as far as fast subsonic aircraft go, but Japan is 
no match when it comes to supersonic aircraft. I think that the 
FS-X that Japan is developing will more than hold its own 
against the European EFA (next-generation European fighter) or 
Ruffle. One of the problems, however, is that Japan lacks the 
technologies to develop and manufacture the engines for these 
type of planes, and will more than likely never reach the level 
of the F-22 next-generation fighter used by the U.S. Air Force. 
  IT: Didn't that used to be the advanced-technology 
fighter called the ATF? 
  SU: That's right. I think that this is the top of 
the line as far as high-performance aircraft. The thing that 
stands out most about this plane is its stealth characteristics, 
the generous use of advanced composite materials throughout the 
airframe, aerodynamics, and across-the-board systems such as 
avionics. There is no such system like that in Japan that 
combines all these technologies. There is no question that we 
have outstanding advanced technologies, therefore, I believe 
that we must create as many opportunities as we can to develop 
and nurture our technical strengths. The problem is we run into 
cost problems. The chance to develop defense technologies in 
Japan has been quite limited due to small production quantities. 
Japan is at a distinct disadvantage to Europe and the United 
States in this area. I think that cost will become a more and 
more important issue in the development of different kinds of 
aircraft in the future. 
  In the area of missiles, I think that Japan is on an equal 
footing with Europe and the United States in terms of element 
technologies. In fact, when it comes to propellants and sensors, 
Japan has the better technology. In terms of performance, Japan 
is probably equal to or ahead of Europe and the United States 
when it comes to antitank missiles, antiship missiles, 
short-range air-to-air missiles (AAM), and short-range 
surface-to-air missiles (SAM), for example. We cannot compare in 
the area of medium-range AAMs or medium-range SAMs because we 
have no experience developing these, but I think that Japan 
would compare quite favorably if it were to vigorously apply the 
technologies it has developed and the experiences gained from 
developing prototypes for defense purposes. Japan doesn't know 
much about survivability, however, when it comes to coordinating 
the operations of numerous missiles. As we see by looking back 
at the Rowland vs. short-range SAM debate that caused such a 
stir in the Diet, there is still only a thin understanding of 
the concept of survivability. We could probably attribute this 
to a lack of actual war experience. This is an area where we are 
going to have to get feedback from the troops in the field as we 
conduct military exercises employing missile systems. We feel it 
is important that we gain as much experience as we can in this 
area. The recent reports on the problem of intercepting 
anti-ballistic missiles are true in that Japan has no 
capabilities in this area whatsoever. Therefore, I think that it 
is important that we begin doing some type of research in this 
area. 
  IT: Is this something Japan is really going to get 
involved in? 
  SU: I think that Japan will develop this on its 
own independent of GPALS. In the event that the United States 
asks Japan to do this with GPALS, I think they will request that 
Japan take on areas in which it has expertise, but when they say 
that, we really do not have anything at this point to say back 
in defense of that. 
  IT: Well, if that's the case, do you think that 
they will come back again and request that we take part in GPALS? 
  SU: That is a possibility. If that should happen, 
it would most likely be a political matter that would have to be 
addressed as a whole, not by us, but rather by the Defense 
Agency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Even if we should 
actually get the go-ahead, Japan still lacks the technical 
capability to take this on. If it becomes necessary, I think 
that we will have to develop it in the future. In specific 
terms, the VT tube of the missile is reported to be no good. In 
other words, it is ineffective unless the warhead splits up with 
a direct hit. Which is to say that because the warhead is big, 
that even if part of the airframe is destroyed, the warhead will 
still be alive and come in and explode and will have the very 
same effect. For that reason, I believe that Japan must have the 
technology for accurately hitting the warhead. 
  TY: With WESTPAC (Western Pacific Missile Defense 
Plan) and GPALS (Limited Anti-Ballistic Missile Defense System), 
this is something that private industry is involved with on 
their own, and that means that the Defense Agency has nothing to 
do with it. 
  SU: The TRDI must be ready to act so that it can 
handle situations when technology becomes necessary as 
technology. 
  Next, in the warship-related area, I think that Japan is 
about at the same level in terms of shipbuilding. However, it is 
behind when it comes to stealth technology and the technology 
for minimizing wave disturbances in the construction of ships. 
Not much has been said about the stealth warship that the United 
States recently made public. The technologies for both designing 
and building an integrated combat command system or aegis system 
are still not developed, but we have started research on a 
combat direction system and things are proceeding smoothly. As 
far as an aegis warships, we are now working on the technologies 
for this by using the technologies introduced with FMS. In terms 
of weapon systems, we are still importing CIWSs and short-range 
SAMs from abroad, but I think we are getting ready to replace 
these with our own technology. In underwater weapons-related 
technology, I think that if the GRX-4 torpedo we're developing 
is successful that this torpedo will be as good as any in the 
world for this type of weapon. We are also getting good reports 
on new ideas in sonar technology at the National Institute for 
Defense Studies. Researchers, for example, are looking into a 
neurochip circuit that can accurately distinguish the sound of 
one target from that of another. 
  Japanese technologies are superior to that of Europe and the 
United States when it comes to electronic equipment, radar, 
computers, and optical fiber. If we were to apply these 
technologies to defense hardware, Japan would immediately be 
able to catch up with the rest of the world. Examples of this 
include the FCS in tanks, the homing devices in missiles, and 
aircraft avionics. Armored vehicle technology is now at the same 
level as that found in Europe and the United States. Japan is 
now first in the world when it comes to hydraulic/pneumatic 
spanning equipment, auto-loading equipment, and especially the 
technology for firing while underway in which FCS stations are 
controlled in an integrated manner. 
  One area where Japan lags behind the West is in ammunition. 
Europe is way ahead of Japan in this area. This is because the 
amount of money invested in this field at the TRDI has been 
extremely small. R&amp;D outlays for ammunition, though, have 
slowly 
started increasing over the past few years. As far as testing 
and evaluation facilities, we just finished work on a domed 
firing range and soft recovery system, and also built a facility 
at the Tsuchiura Research Institute for observing high-speed 
impacts between various phenomena, and continue to build more 
research and testing facilities. We had no choice but to bring 
the 155mm base-bleed shell to the United States to have it 
tested. Much to our surprise, the technical people there seemed 
to be taken aback by the way in which we collected data on the 
projectile. This was because we had the data transmitted by 
radio wave from the fired shell, and the Mach number and drag 
coefficient were displayed instantly in real time under the 
high-impact and high speed conditions. I think that we are a 
good deal ahead of the West in these kinds of technologies. When 
people hear stories such as that, however, they often take it to 
mean that we are much further ahead in ammunition technologies, 
but the truth of the matter is that these are just blips on the 
screen and we still have a lot of catching up to do. 
  TY: I think that one of the reasons why Japan has 
gotten off to such a slow start in this area has to do with the 
fact that there are no modern facilities in Japan where we can 
conduct tests that meet the minimal standards for testing 
ammunition. Another reason for the slow start may be due to the 
fact that we did not create a solid foundation in our initial 
research with simulators at the lab and this kept our research 
from moving to the next stage. I would really like to make sure 
that this problem never happens again. Ammunition technology is 
a little bit different from other advanced technologies as far 
as the relation with manufacturers goes. In other words, since 
there are no dual uses for ammunition, companies are not able to 
invest in this ahead of time and are forced to rely on 
government as a backup. 
<H5>  R&amp;D on Key Basic Technologies </H5>
  SU: Now, with respect to developing defense 
technologies in Japan, I basically feel that there will be no 
change in the current policy of the TRDI being the main party 
responsible for R&amp;D on SDF military hardware. Military 
equipment 
also becomes outdated, so the TRDI is always thinking about ways 
to modernize and improve military hardware. In other words, the 
TRDI will no longer develop things in the way that it always 
has, that is, based on unilateral requests from the military 
operations, but will move toward a system in which it develops 
future generations of hardware that will not have to be upgraded 
or improved for 10 or 20 years. There will be technical advances 
made during that time and these will be incorporated as we go 
along. For that reason, I think that the TRDI must come up with 
new ideas for applying the results from R&amp;D on basic 
technologies that look into the future of military hardware 
based on requests from military operations. 
  TY: In my earlier years, we would have the troops 
in the field test weapons that we had developed. We would then 
get feedback on how well the weapons performed, and this 
information would then be used for making improvements or 
developing new models. We would then consult with the technical 
engineers from military operations or exchange communication 
with them, but this practice did not last very long. What 
happened was that when a problem from the field was relayed to 
higher levels, it would tend to get stuck at that higher level. 
  SU: Well, if something like that is occurring, the 
TRDI should show some willingness to get involved. We have been 
working on that system. 
  TY: Take aircraft, for example, we never have a 
formal version of an airplane. There are always new systems 
being developed to make improvements. Even as the equipment is 
being used, we will make a modification if we run into a problem 
or find new components that employ new technologies. To have a 
formal version of an aircraft is important. Being an age where 
rapid progress is being made in technology, if we try to adopt 
too many new technologies, we delay upgrades to equipment and 
fall behind other countries. 
  TY: You are getting to ECPs (engineering change 
proposals), aren't you? 
  SU: You mentioned it earlier, but we have to 
increase our research on basic technologies in the future. 
Another area where we need to focus our attention is 
internationalizing the institute. It goes without saying that we 
will have to expand the present level of joint R&amp;D between 
the 
United States and Japan. Moreover, we have been getting a lot of 
requests from different people in European and ASEAN countries 
who want to come see the TRDI, and are asking us if there aren't 
areas where we could work jointly in developing technologies. 
The problem with this is that there are already certain 
established channels between the United States and Japan 
regarding technology, and Japan is actually prevented from 
working jointly with countries other than the United States in 
weapons technology related work by the three-point policy 
governing weapons exports. Therefore, I think we have to look 
more deeply into this in order to see if there is some way where 
technical cooperation could be possible. 
  TY: In the 21st century, ASEAN countries will form 
one of the most important political and economic blocks in the 
world, so we must not forget about them. Next, what do you think 
about the private sector role of the TRDI? 
  SU: I do not think we will see much change in the 
private sector role played by the TRDI. That means the TRDI 
intends to keep borrowing on the knowledge and experience of the 
private sector that enable it to do R&amp;D on advanced 
technologies. In comparison, it would be almost unthinkable for 
this to be done under civilian leadership. If private industry 
comes up with something new and interesting, I think that we can 
have it presented to the government, and the government then 
turn it into an R&amp;D project. The TRDI lacks the design and 
manufacturing technologies to handle those types of things, so 
it has to rely on private industry across the board. It is very 
difficult for private companies to maintain large expensive test 
facilities, so I think that the government should be the one to 
maintain such facilities and let them be used by private 
corporations. 
  TY: What do you think the TRDI's role should be 
with regard to basic research? 
  SU: With respect to basic research, we should 
quickly seize on any ideas that the academic community may have, 
but I do not feel that this is the type of work that the TRDI 
should be getting involved with. I think that this is something 
that should be left to universities, and that we have to 
consider basic technologies in the context of long-term research 
and how it is applied to military hardware. Some examples of 
this include the conformal antenna, the IR-CCD, liquid 
propellants, robot technology, and neurochip applications in 
signal processing. Basic technologies may provide the best route 
for developing applications for advanced technologies such as 
these. 
<H5>  Prototypes Plus </H5>
  IT: There has been a lot of talk recently about 
``R&amp;D not predicated on equipment.'' What are your thoughts 
about doing R&amp;D without it being predicated on equipment? 
  SU: This expression has caused a lot of 
misunderstanding. These words were spoken a lot during a recent 
roundtable discussion on defense industry technology and really 
caused a great deal of misunderstanding. If we think about this 
in terms of real problems, when we started doing research on 
future fighter planes and future guided missiles, that research 
did not have a direct link to hardware, but the research was 
conducted anyhow because it was believed that down the road that 
it would be helpful in making later developments possible. This 
is still going on right now. We feel that by doing this we 
reduce the technical risks in developing new items in the 
future. If we receive a proposal to take part in joint R&amp;D, 
it 
gives us some bargaining power to say that we have such and such 
a thing, or we can develop such and such a thing. In order to do 
this, we are talking first about making prototypes of aircraft, 
naval vessels, armored vehicles, and other hardware so that we 
can test the technology. In some cases, this may mean preparing 
one firing unit (one squadron if we're talking about aircraft). 
  TY: In the case of the Ground Self-Defense Force, 
are you talking about something on a scale used in 
non-commissioned officer schools? 
  SU: This is just my opinion, but we should go 
ahead and do something at that level and equip the units in the 
field with it and conduct field tests. I think we can use the 
feedback from that if necessary to put the item into production. 
The chance to develop items from scratch has been diminishing. 
In that regard, I think that we will be OK if we can maintain 
the technology for that, make it possible for the field units to 
become aware of this again, and evaluate it, and come up with 
development configurations. 
  IT: We'll have to make some modifications in the 
R&amp;D directives then, won't we? 
  YI: Well, technology is going to keep improving, 
so even if the military side knows what system it wants, a 
decision cannot be made without data. Therefore, I think at the 
demonstration model stage that we will have to make a certain 
number of units. 
  IT: You're referring to prototype plus, aren't you? 
  YI: Making a lot of prototypes gives us a lot more 
leeway in responding to different demands. Until recently, most 
people thought prototyping was a sort of trial manufacture 
before an item went into production. 
  IT: This is because manufacturers believe that 
they cannot do R&amp;D without it being predicated on a specific 
item. I think what they were concerned about is amortizing their 
R&amp;D costs, but there are other ways of looking at this 
besides 
that. In other words, by revising the system and doing things 
the way that Mr. Uemura recommended earlier, it would not be 
that much different from doing R&amp;D not predicated on specific 
equipment. We also have to consider what the Office of Technical 
Assessment (OTA) in the United States has been saying about the 
era of producing large amounts of military hardware coming to an 
end, and countries having to start thinking about ways to 
cultivate their most important core technologies. In the case of 
Japan, the approach has always been to receive a request from 
military headquarters, and then develop, demonstrate, and test 
that piece of equipment. I think that we have to be able to say, 
even when the request comes from military operations, that we're 
not going to put an item into mass-production, but we're going 
to cut off production as soon as the testing is done. I think 
that we have to consider doing it that way, or another way in 
which the testing and reporting of military hardware proposed by 
the TRDI is tested and reported on by military operations. 
  TY: When it comes to how the United States pays, 
our understanding is that they make full payments at each stage. 
  IT: No, I don't think that is true. The United 
States has been saying the same thing. They used to pay for 
mass-production, but they say that one of the problems they have 
now is that they can no longer do this. 
  TY: Advanced countries have settlement methods 
based on weapons exports, but that is not possible for Japan, so 
it is tougher. 
  SU: The thing that is interesting about the United 
States, for example, is that despite having decided on an 
initial number of B-1B to manufacture, they were suddenly able 
to cut that number midway through production. The problem with 
that type of system, however, is that money is being paid to 
maintain production facilities. What I mean is even when they 
put private industry on hold, they still come up with the 
necessary money. So, if the need ever arises, they can 
immediately increase the quantity in the system. That type of 
thinking is completely alien in Japan. In Japan, whenever the 
pitch of production is dropped, there are no policies about what 
to do with the production equipment. This is a cause of great 
concern. 
  IT: Even the United States has said that it will 
have to revise part of its system in order to adopt the 
prototype-plus approach. I don't know in what areas this will 
happen, but it will involve some new regulations. In that sense, 
I feel that we should come to some type of conclusion in this 
discussion regarding what approach Japan should take in revising 
its system. 
  YI: The U.S. is studying ways of using limited 
budgets, but if things proceed with the military taking the 
initiative based on conventional spin-offs, it benefits private 
industry because it improves their technology, but now this 
philosophy is being somewhat modified. The idea now seems to be 
dual use, that is, to include spin-ons as well. If things go in 
the direction of spin-ons, I think that it will lead to private 
industry looking ahead to the future, the government providing 
the funding, and the equipment and research. In the past, the 
intense competition between companies in the Japanese electronic 
industry created a high technological level in that industry, 
and even threatened the technological superiority of the United 
States, but now the United States is moving in the direction of 
doing all it can to support industry, and this may force Japan 
once again into an era in which it will have to weather intense 
competition. The United States is moving toward a national 
policy of encouraging independent R&amp;D (IR&amp;D), and is 
trying to 
provide funding to companies for R&amp;D if it can be used for 
future defense purposes. This is similar to the subsidy system 
used by MITI (Ministry of International Trade and Industry) here 
in Japan. The Department of Defense is reportedly taking part in 
this project. We have no such system in the defense area in 
Japan, and it would be very hard for Japanese companies to adopt 
such a system because of their independence. 
  SU: I think if we are going to try and attract 
talent from private industry that we will have to come up with 
ways to raise the level of money budgeted for departmental and 
internal research while at the same time increasing the R&amp;D 
budget of the TRDI. 
  Now, about incentives, the TRDI started a special research 
program in 1992. One of the purposes of the program is research 
on future defense hardware. The program budgets between &yen;20 
and &yen;30 million a year on developing promising new 
technologies. Last year there were eight projects, and this year 
an additional five has been added. We have seen an all-out 
effort by younger researchers in this project who have set 
themselves very ambitious goals even at a cost of failure. 
  TY: When Mr. Moriya was the head of the Technical 
Research Division, we attempted a special research program that 
was later called the proposition research program. Does this 
special research program have the same goals as that? 
  SU: It includes both projects that the TRDI is 
working on independently, and projects that involve 
corporations. As far as independent research, it is amazing how 
many unique ideas we are receiving on various types of research. 
It is hard to tell at this point whether we can immediately 
build incentives into this research or not. There has to be an 
environment in which the germ can grow. I think that we should 
design the system so that we can combine the talents of 
companies in the private industry, too. 
  IT: Are you talking about contracts with 
individual companies? 
  SU: It would have to be based mainly on TRDI 
engineers working independently, so the research would only be 
partially supported by corporations. 
<H5>  FS-X Training/TRDI Prospects </H5>
  IT: There was some mention in the newspapers and 
magazines, but could you mind saying something about the current 
status of the FS-X, and something about the first international 
joint development exercises. Would you also say something about 
the five joint U.S.-Japan joint research projects. 
  SU: As far as the status of the FS-X is concerned, 
we were running about two years behind our original schedule, 
but are doing fine now. Late last year, we moved the fighter 
line from General Dynamics (GD) to Lockheed (LFWC). We were 
worried about what effect this would have on the timeline, but 
the chairman (Tellep) promised us there would be no delays. The 
FY93 prototyping budget, which has a contractual base of 
&yen;96.5 billion, is the largest it has ever been. We are 
making steady progress toward developing the first plane by 
1995. The lessons here, in terms of how to apportion demand 
specifications, equipment, costs, and risks, is to adjust for 
the differences in ways of thinking, ideas, and ways of 
processing (technology transfers, development agreements, etc.) 
unique to each country (government, private corporation). This 
took much longer than we thought it would. It was a really 
difficult problem to resolve at the administrative level. 
  In the area of joint research (proposed projects), we're 
doing research on promising technologies that are not directly 
linked to equipment. These include the following six research 
projects: 
  (1) Ducted rocket engines 
  (2) Advanced steel technology 
  (3) Ceramic engines for armored vehicles 
  (4) Milliwave-infrared complex seekers 
  (5) Closed-loop demagnetization technology for steel ships 
  (6) Eye-safe laser 
  We are also looking into whether we can do joint research at 
the practical business level (JWG). If an agreement can be 
reached concerning the allocation of research items, scheduling, 
expenses, it will constitute an item for joint research. If an 
agreement can be reached, a SOW (scope of work) is set up. If we 
can come to terms on how the agreement for joint research will 
move forward, we will conclude an MOU followed by implementation 
of the research. I would like to tell you where we are at with 
regard to each of the research projects mentioned above. In the 
ducted rocket engine research project, we concluded an MOU and 
have already begun doing research. In the advanced steel, 
ceramic engine, milliwave/infrared, and demagnetization 
projects, we are in the midst of studying the research findings. 
In the eyesafe laser project, we are studying the feasibility of 
joint research. 
  Next, I would like to say something about the basic position 
of the U.S.-Japan relationship in particular, and how it should 
be handled? Technical cooperation is one of the links for 
strengthening the U.S.-Japan security arrangement. The flow of 
requests between the two countries has been shifting from a 
one-sided one in which most of the demands come from the United 
States to one that is more two-sided. We are also promoting 
technology transfers based on R&amp;D findings. After this was 
debated, a major prerequisite was an agreement on which way to 
proceed. It is especially necessary for Japan to try and perfect 
basic technologies on its own so that it will have something to 
offer when it comes time to discuss joint research. 
  TY: Our time is running out, so would you say 
something about the recent trend in the United States toward 
isolating itself, technologically. 
  SU: The United States has first-rate technology, 
and it is a matter of personal pride to use that technology for 
rescuing other countries around the world. I think that this 
will continue in the future. 
  Defense technology has a nationality in a certain sense. The 
standing orders of the military is to try and maintain 
technological superiority over other countries. In the case of 
joint R&amp;D with other countries, the United States wants to 
acquire the technologies of other countries without letting go 
of its own technology. It is not so much isolation, but stopping 
the outflow of technology. An example of that type of thinking 
is when Japan asked the United States for a license for MLRS and 
did not get a reply. I do not think that anything can be done 
about this. Therefore, Japan's only way is to quickly achieve a 
comparable level on its own without having to import the 
technology. If Japan is asked by the United States to take part 
in joint research on a defense technology, I think that in some 
cases that it would be determinative to say that we've developed 
such and such a technology. 
  TY: That only goes to show how important and 
critical it is to have bargaining power when it comes to 
technology. I want to thank you very much for taking the time to 
take part in this discussion. (6 June 1993)

  Sachio Uehara was born in Okayama Prefecture on 10 November 
1932. In March 1956, he graduated from Tokyo University with a 
BS degree in aeronautics. In April of the same year, he went to 
work for Fuji Heavy Industries where he was in charge of T-1 
maneuverability and aerodynamic design. In February 1960, he 
joined the Defense Agency where he was assigned to the 4th 
Development Corps under the TRDI R&amp;D Officer where he oversaw 
guided weapons. While serving here, he conducted research on 
ways of designing missile systems. In September 1963, he 
received his master's degree from the California Institute of 
Technology. In the following year, he returned to Japan. 
  In August 1966, Mr. Uehara resumed work at the Defense 
Agency 
in the Aircraft Division in the Bureau of Equipment. During that 
time, he was put in charge of R&amp;D, procurement, supply, 
maintenance, and management of aircraft in the Maritime 
Self-Defense Force, and was the person responsible for handling 
accidents and upkeep involving Self-Defense Force equipment. 
Later, he was put in charge of the Air Self-Defense Force. In 
April 1968, he was assigned to the 1st Development Corps under 
the Technical Development Officer in the TRDI as the chief 
researcher in charge of aircraft. While serving here, he had a 
hand in developing the T-2, and was also in charge of 
aerodynamics, construction, reliability, and upkeep. In 
September 1971, he returned again to the California Institute of 
Technology to pursue his doctorate degree. In June 1949, he 
received a PhD in aeronautics and then returned to Japan. 
  In October 1974, he became the head researcher in the 3rd 
Development Corps of the TRDI. During that time, he was in 
charge of developing the F-1, developing applications for PASPA 
and carbon-based composite materials as part of future aircraft 
research, and planning the T2-CCV. In September 1977, Mr. Uehara 
enrolled and later completed courses at the National Institute 
for Defense Studies. In August 1978, he was appointed head of 
one of the research labs (4th) in the TRDI No. 3 Research 
Institute, Airframe Department. While serving in this capacity, 
he conducted in-house tests on the P2V-VSA and flight tests on 
the PS-1ATS. In December of the same year, he was appointed head 
of the Guided Weapons Lab in the Aircraft Division of the Bureau 
of Equipment. Here, he developed the domestic AIM-7F and AIM-9L, 
organized development of the ASM-1, took part in Diet debates 
over the adoption of the short-range SAM, and designed ways to 
improve the short-range SAM. 
  In December 1981, Mr. Uehara became the special assistant 
for 
research and development in the Bureau of Equipment. While 
serving in this position, he took part in discussions between 
the United States and Japan regarding technical cooperation and 
third party weapons export, and participated in the 3rd, 4th, 
and 5th S&amp;TF conferences. In May 1984, he was appointed to 
director of the TRDI No. 3 Research Institute. While serving in 
this position, he supervised mechanical and fatigue strength 
tests on the T-4, and structural tests on the composite 
materials used between the main wing spars. In March 1986, he 
became head of the Technology Department in the TRDI. Here, he 
was commissioned to do applied research on AI servicing 
equipment. In April 1987, he became the head of the Planning 
Department in the TRDI. In this capacity, he established 64 
long-term projects, and proposed various topics for joint 
research between the United States and Japan. In April 1989, he 
was appointed director of the TRDI No. 3 Research Institute. 
While holding this position, he installed a flight simulator, 
and reported the research findings on the structure of composite 
materials at a high-level meeting of the executive board. In 
November 1990, he was appointed counselor of the Defense Agency, 
which put him in charge of technology. While holding this 
position, he served as a Japanese delegate, and as Japanese 
chairman in the S&amp;TF executive level council. In December 
1992, 
he assumed his present position as director of the TRDI.

  [Text] About 80 miles east of central Tokyo, there is a 
research and testing facility for radio wave and light wave 
equipment called the Iioka No. 2 Branch Institute. The town 
where the institute is located, Iioka, is the setting for the 
story ``Tenpo Suiko Ten'' and is also known as the birthplace of 
Sukegoro Iioka. The town, which adjoins Choshi City (Chiba 
Prefecture) in the west, and faces the Pacific Ocean in the 
southeast, is sometimes called the ``Pacific Straits of Dover'' 
because of the scenic beauty of Osakabe Point. 
  The Iioka branch was opened in December 1964. At that time, 
it was being looked upon as one of the possible sites for doing 
research on VHF long-range radar. This site was especially 
chosen from among a number of other sites throughout Japan that 
were also being considered. It was deemed to be the best place 
to do research and testing on radio wave propagation because 
there were no obstructions around such as mountains to block 
radio wave transmission, and also because the coast was nearby 
and afforded good visibility. 
  Organizationally, it was started as the first research 
institute and at the time had a research lab (1st) called the 
Radio Physics Research Lab that was mainly charged with testing 
and research on radio materials. Subsequently, in July 1987, 
with the reorganization of the TRDI, this facility became the 
new second research institute called the Optical and Electronic 
Research Institute, and the name of the research lab was changed 
to the Electromagnetic Characteristics Research Lab. It has a 
small but elite staff made up of eight researchers and four 
administrative personnel (FY93). 
  The research being done here mainly has to do with 
reflection, radiation, and propagation characteristics of radio 
waves and optical waves. In 1993, the research projects included: 
  (1) Research on shortwave band characteristics 
  (2) Research on milliwave band characteristics 
  (3) Research on microwave band scattering characteristics 
  (4) Research on light wave band characteristics 
  Other research projects in which it had cooperation in 
testing from other departments included: 
  (1) Imaging radar 
  (2) Laser focusing test equipment 
  The research being done at the Iioka branch can be 
categorized under one of the following four major areas, namely, 
shortwave band characteristics, microwave band characteristics, 
light wave band characteristics, and milliwave band 
characteristics. 
  The research on shortwave band characteristics employs the 
property of short waves for propagation along the surface of the 
ocean. The results of this research should find applications in 
the radio equipment used aboard ships of the future. 
  The research on microwave band characteristics involves 
trying to perfect an accurate way of measuring radar cross 
sections (RCS) which are becoming increasingly important in the 
work being done to make planes and ships more stealthy. In 
conventional RCS measurement, a 1:1 monostatic system was used 
in which the transmitter and receiver were together, but this is 
being changed to a bistatic system in which the receiver is 
installed at some distance from the transmitter for purposes of 
stealth. As part of that research, an experiment is being 
conducted with a device that measures the properties of 
microwave reflection. In this experiment, reflection data is 
gathered while the angle of a mock-up stealth missile is changed. 
  With respect to research on milliwave band characteristics, 
milliwaves holds a lot of promise in the area of defense 
communication, so scientists have selected three frequencies, 
namely, 30 GHz, 60 GHz, and 90 GHz, and are trying to gather 
data pertaining to the damping characteristics of various 
atmospheric phenomena in order to further add to the amount of 
basic data already available on reflection and propagation 
characteristics. The research also involves prototyping a new 
device for assessing milliwave reflection and radiation 
measurements. Using two towers inside the center, scientists are 
testing transmission and reception. 
  However, when we look at these tests, we find that it may be 
true that measuring milliwaves is a time-consuming job because 
as Mr. Takefuji, the director of the center, has said, ``it 
takes a very long time because data cannot be gathered on 
milliwave propagation unless it rains,'' and the chance of rain 
during the year is only 10%-20%. 
  In the research on light wave band characteristics, 
scientists have found that the characteristics of a laser beam 
deteriorates when the laser beam passes through the atmosphere, 
that is, it is affected by atmospheric fluctuations, so the aim 
of this research is to gather data on atmospheric propagation 
characteristics with regards to laser beams, and perfect a 
technique for reducing the effect that atmospheric fluctuations 
have on laser beam propagation. 
  When we look at present growth of electronic-related 
technologies, it is not just the radio wave band technologies 
but also the light wave band technologies that stand out, so the 
future is looking brighter and brighter for TRDI's advanced 
technology manufacturers. (23 June 1993)

  [Text] 1997 Is Deadline for Electric Car Development; Goal 
is Ni-MH Battery But Lead Is Realistic 
  Automakers have begun concentrated efforts to develop 
electric vehicles in time for their fall 1997 product 
announcement. This is in response to new emissions regulations 
in the state of California in the United States that will begin 
in 1998. There is less than four years until that deadline. 
Manufacturers of batteries, semiconductors and motors will be 
involved. A serious problem for the automakers is the secondary 
battery. They want an advanced type of battery with high energy 
density. The top candidate is a nickel-hydrogen battery, but 
there are a mountain of problems to overcome to develop a 
practical model. It is likely that they will start with a lead 
battery, which has low energy density but has a record of safety 
and reliability. There is also hope for an Li-based battery in 
the 21st Century. 
  The deadline for developing electric vehicles is the fall of 
1997. Not much time is left. In the state of California in the 
United States, the new emissions regulation bill (the new clean 
air law) will go into effect in 1998. This regulation obligates 
each manufacturer to ensure that 2% of the total number of 
vehicles it sells are ``zero emission cars,'' and realistically 
speaking, these are electric vehicles (see Figure 1). Automakers 
probably will unveil electric vehicles responding to this 
regulation in the fall of 1997. 


  This regulation will apply to automakers that sold 35,000 
vehicles per year in California. That means that each 
manufacturer must sell a minimum of 700 electric vehicles. 
Automakers that do not meet this regulation will penalized 
heavily. Under the bill that was in force in 1992, the penalty 
was only a fine of $5,000 for each vehicle under the 2% 
minimum. The penalty was changed as a result of a review of the 
1992 law, however, and now, automakers that cannot meet the 
regulation will not be able to sell any gasoline vehicles in 
California for the next year. 
  Furthermore, this action will not stop with California 
alone. 
It is expected to expand to the eastern states in the future. 
For this reason, automakers are forced to make concentrated 
efforts to develop electric vehicles. They also are obligated to 
sell hybrid cars that jointly use internal combustion engines 
and motors (see Figure 1). 
  Normally, automakers take four to five years to develop a 
new 
gasoline vehicle. They cannot meet the deadline if the basic 
design is not already firmed up. At the 30th Tokyo Motor Show, 
automakers displayed not only electric vehicles that were 
converted from gasoline vehicles, but also electric and hybrid 
vehicles that were newly designed from the chassis on up (see 
Figure 2 [omitted]). 
  However, everyone involved with electric vehicles says, 
``The 
electric vehicles that will be presented in the fall of 1997 
will be different from this exhibition.'' According to Honda 
Motor Company, ``Development of electric vehicles to be sold in 
California in 1998 is being done in earnest apart from those 
exhibited here.'' Beneath the surface, tension is growing in the 
development of electric vehicles that actually will be sold. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-56A>  Figure 1. Electric Vehicle Introduction Schedule Under California's Clean Air Law </FIG>

<H5>  Storage Battery Breakthrough Essential </H5>
  Electronics manufacturers play a big role in the development 
of electric vehicles. This is because the secondary battery 
(storage battery) and semiconductors for motor and power use are 
important technologies that make up the electric vehicle. 
Automakers have brought in manufacturers of batteries, 
semiconductors and motors to begin developing electric vehicles. 
  Of these technologies, the storage battery is a serious 
bottleneck to popularization of the electric vehicle. According 
to a major battery manufacturer, ``A number of electric vehicle 
storage battery development projects are in progress in 
partnership with automakers.'' 
  This is because storage battery performance decides a 
vehicle's basic performance, including acceleration and the 
distance the vehicle can travel on one charge. If a high energy 
density storage battery is developed, it will increase the 
distance traveled per charge. If output density (maximum power 
per unit weight that can be extracted instantaneously from the 
battery) can be raised, acceleration performance will improve. 
The automakers' minimum requirements are 70Wh/kg weight energy 
density, 130 W/kg output density and a cycle life of over 1,000 
cycles (see Table 1). 


  In addition, the safety condition of ensuring that shock to 
the battery will not cause an outbreak of fire is indispensable. 
Problems with reliability, such as battery capacity decreasing 
as a result of over-charging, also must be resolved. Eliminating 
the need for maintenance work, such as electrolytic solution 
replenishment, also is an important point. 
<H5>  MITI Standardizes Five Items </H5>
  High cost is another factor that hinders popular use of 
electric vehicles. To promote cost reduction, MITI has compiled 
five standard specifications for batteries and chargers. 
  First, concerning lead (Pb) batteries: Dimensions and 
nominal 
voltage are not set. What has been standardized is voltage 
regulation, which has been set at 80 - 140% of nominal 
voltage. 
  Second, concerning communication protocol between charge 
stand and electric vehicle: When the charger is inserted, seven 
control signals are to be sent from the electric vehicle to the 
charger. They include signals to start or stop charging, whether 
the charger connector is connected properly, etc. 
  Third, concerning the charger connector: At this time, 
contact type connection has been made the standard. The method 
of charging without contact by using electromagnetic guidance, 
as proposed by General Motors Corporation of the United States, 
has not been addressed. It is possible that both methods will 
become standard in the United States. 
  MITI also set standards for charger and charge stand, but 
the 
details have not been released. The Japan Electric Vehicle 
Association plans to compile the standards in a book that will 
be published in January 1994. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-57A>           Table 1: Candidates for Electric Vehicle Storage Battery </FIG>

<H5>  Closed Type Pb Battery Most Likely for Fall 1997 </H5>
  At present, the open type Pb batteries installed in electric 
vehicles that are converted gasoline vehicles need maintenance 
such as electrolytic solution replenishment. ``We cannot ask the 
general consumer to use the vehicle under such conditions,'' 
says the Japan Storage Battery Company. Battery manufacturers 
are working to develop a closed type Pb battery, and already 
have mounted one in an electric vehicle for experimental 
purposes. 
  Many battery manufacturers think that this closed type Pb 
battery is ``the most likely candidate for the electric vehicle 
battery that will appear in the fall of 1997.'' This is because, 
while its weight energy density of about 30 to 35 Wh/kg is low 
and its cycle life of around 400 cycles is short, it is a 
``balanced battery'' with high safety and reliability, according 
to the Japan Storage Battery Company. 
  Nevertheless, since this energy density limits the use of 
electric vehicles, it is not good enough to keep up with the 
California regulation. 
  The distance traveled per charge of the existing closed type 
Pb battery, when loaded with about 200 kg and operated over 40 
km of level ground, is about 75 km. At this rate, it can only be 
used when the distance to be traveled per day is known in 
advance, such as by dispatched freight delivery vehicles, trash 
collection vehicles, or vehicles used for commuting when one way 
is under 30 km. Says Matsushita Battery Industrial Company, 
``The 2% minimum probably can be met by using the close 
type Pb 
storage battery in the first year under the new regulation, 
1998, by selling to a limited market. From 1999 and thereafter, 
however, sales beyond those to a limited market will be needed, 
and that would be tough to do with the closed type Pb battery. 
The automakers say they want the distance traveled per charge to 
be at least 160 km.'' 
  That is why development is underway to improve energy 
density 
and cycle life. Goals for improvement by 1997 are 45 Wh/kg 
weight energy density and a cycle life of 1,000 cycles. 
<H5>  Hopes Pinned to Ni-MH Battery </H5>
  However, even if these goals are achieved, the closed type 
Pb 
battery will not reach the energy density required by the 
automakers. 
  That is why work is being done to develop advanced batteries 
with higher energy density than the closed type Pb battery. 
There are many candidates. These include the Ni-based Ni-Cd 
battery and nickel-hydrogen battery, the Li-based lithium ion 
battery that has started to be used recently in portable 
equipment, and Na-based batteries. All the advanced batteries 
carry unresolved problems, however, and none can be put to 
practical use right away. 
  The most hope is being pinned on the Ni-based battery. Even 
now, its weight energy density is about 60 Wh/kg, about double 
that of the closed type Pb battery, and it meets the 
requirements of the automakers in output density and cycle life 
as well. 
  Expectations are especially strong in the United States. The 
United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC), formed mainly 
by U.S. automakers, is concentrating research on the 
nickel-hydrogen battery with a view toward 1997. The battery 
will be developed by the Ovonic Battery Company of the United 
States (see Figure 3 [omitted]). In Japan, research is being 
done by the Furukawa Battery Company, Matsushita Battery 
Industrial Company and Sanyo Electric Company. 
  However, battery manufacturers who cite the closed type Pb 
battery as the best candidate for the vehicle to be presented in 
1997 cite the high cost of the nickel-hydrogen battery as a 
problem. Says a certain battery manufacturer, ``It may be almost 
double the weight energy density as the Pb battery, but it is 
three to four times the cost.'' It also has problems with 
reliability. Temperature rises in the battery during charging 
and discharging, which shortens its charge/discharge cycle life. 
``Research on suppressing heat is needed. It does not meet the 
requirements fully yet,'' says Matsushita Battery. 
<H5>  The Ideal Li-Based Battery in 10 Years </H5>
  Battery manufacturers that see the close type Pb battery as 
the best with which to start also see the Li-based battery as 
the advanced battery that will replace the closed type Pb 
battery. Manufacturers that see the nickel-hydrogen battery as 
promising also predict that the Li-based battery will succeed 
the nickel-hydrogen battery. 
  The attraction of the Li-based battery is its high energy 
density. There is no other material that can be used for a 
secondary battery that would raise energy density higher than 
lithium. It can raise weight energy density to about 180 Wh/kg. 
Calculated in terms of distance traveled per charge, this is 340 
km. When realized, it can be expected to perform on a par with a 
gasoline vehicle. 
  It will be well into the future before actual use of the 
Li-based battery. ``It probably will be realized in 10 years, 
not in this century,'' says Thomas W. Evernham, senior vice 
president of the U.S. firm Delco Electronics, which is 
responsible for the motor and battery used in the electric car 
``Impact'' that was developed by the General Motors Corporation 
of the United States. Many Japanese battery manufacturers share 
that view. Japanese research on the Li-based battery began in 
FY92 in the ``dispersion type battery power storage technology'' 
project, a 10-year project under the New Sunshine Project. The 
Li-based battery is a long-term R&amp;D them for USABC as well. 
<H5>  A Mountain of Problems with Li-Based Battery </H5>
  R&amp;D has only just begun on the Li-based battery and 
there are 
a mountain of problems. First, serial/parallel connection of 
multiple cells is difficult. When multiple cells with dispersed 
capacity are connected, some cells become over-charged or 
over-discharged. As a result, the battery electrolyte, an 
organic solvent, may leak out and ignite. 
  It is said that in the future, the electric vehicle will 
need 
around 200 to 300V output voltage. If lithium ion secondary 
batteries with 3.6V output are used, this would mean a serial 
connection of almost 100 cells. Parallel connection will be 
necessary to gain capacity. At present, only three parallel 
connections of three-cell serial connections has been achieved 
even for portable equipment. Moreover, large cells with multiple 
A capacity have yet to be manufactured. 
  Work is being done to develop a lithium secondary battery 
that uses a solid electrolyte instead of an organic solvent 
electrolytic solution in order to avoid the danger of fire or 
explosion. Use of a solid electrolyte will increase safety. 
However, this makes it difficult to achieve large capacity, and 
it also has less output density. 
<H5>  Specific Uses of Na-S Battery Possible </H5>
  R&amp;D also is proceeding on advanced batteries other than 
nickel-hydrogen and Li-based batteries. Each one has serious 
problems in practical application, however, and would have 
difficulty in replacing the Pb battery as the most popular 
battery. 
  The Na-based battery is under intense development in 
Germany. 
Because its operating temperature is high (350C), it must 
be heated before use. Once it cools down, it takes time before 
it is heated up again. ``It is not for the Sunday driver who 
drives only once a week, but it probably can be used for 
vehicles that run every day and can maintain the necessary 
temperature, such as delivery vehicles,'' says the Yuasa 
Corporation. Another problem is that experiments cannot be 
conducted on this battery in Japan. There is a legal restriction 
in the Fire Services Law that prohibits the loading of sodium 
and sulfur together over a specified quantity. 
  However, an advantage of the Na-based battery, according to 
the Yuasa Corporation, is that ``The 350C operating 
temperature ensures that there will be no output density drops 
or deterioration of life of the battery due to the cold.'' 
Furthermore, the weight energy density of the Na-S battery is 
100 Wh/kg, almost triple that of the Pb battery. Resources are 
abundant, also. Thus the Swiss firm Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) is 
working on the Na-S battery and AEG Anglo America AG, with the 
backing of the German firm Daimler-Benz, is working on an 
Na-NiCl battery (the zebra battery). Daimler-Benz, BMW 
(Bayerische Motoren Werke) and Volkswagen already have test 
manufactured electric vehicles in which these batteries have 
been installed, and have tested them on public roads. 
  As for the Ni-Cd battery, which is widely used for portable 
equipment, limited cadmium resources is a problem. Deposits 
contain only enough cadmium for about 30 million electric 
vehicles. 
  Other Ni-based batteries are the Ni-Fe and Ni-Zn-based 
batteries. Both have serious problems. The Ni-Fe battery cannot 
be sealed and therefore requires electrolyte replenishment and 
other maintenance. The Ni-Zn battery has high energy density, 
but is short-lived. 
<H5>  Regulation To Be Reviewed in 1994 </H5>
  ``The current situation resembles the one in 1973,'' says a 
major storage battery maker. In 1973, legislation that 
strengthened emissions regulations was promulgated in 
California, and automakers were forced to respond. Japanese 
automakers met these regulations, but U.S. automakers were 
unable to do so, and enforcement was postponed for one year. It 
is possible that this time as well, enforcement may be postponed 
if advanced batteries cannot be developed by 1998. It also is 
possible that the many hybrid cars that were exhibited at the 
recent Tokyo Motor Show may initially be approved in place of 
non-polluting vehicles. The recent legislation is reviewed every 
two years, and the next review will be in 1994.

  [Text] The research group of Professor Junji Furusho and 
his assistant Akito Sano has developed a new type of small 
actuator (drive mechanism). Its distinctive characteristic is 
that it uses electric viscous fluid with viscosity that changes 
in response to the strength of electrolysis. It is anticipated 
that this will be applied as a driving source for micromachines 
that output big force from a small structure. 
  The plastic body of the newly developed mechanism contains 
passageways for the electric viscous fluid, electrodes, and a 
reciprocating piston. The passageway has one entrance, divides 
into two part way, and becomes one again at the exit. The two 
divided passageways are linked part way by another passageway 
where the piston is. 
  The electrodes are made of electric discharge-processed 
stainless steel fluorine resin. An electrode is attached at the 
entrance and exit to each passageway to the piston. There is a 
total of four electrodes. There is a tiny opening the size of a 
comb's tooth between the positive and negative electrodes. When 
voltage is applied there it's difficult for the electric viscous 
fluid to move and the opening is closed. It acts like an opening 
and closing valve. 
  For example, when the left entrance valve is closed, the 
fluid flows into the right passageway, and when the right exit 
valve is closed, the fluid flows through the piston's passageway 
to the left exit passageway. This makes the piston move from 
right to left. If the closing of valves is reversed, the piston 
moves from left to right. The piston is attached to an exterior 
moving mechanism. 
  It's possible to some extent to reduce the size of hydraulic 
mechanisms, but it is difficult to reduce the size of the valves 
so they'll open and close mechanically. In contrast, since the 
electric viscous fluid itself instantly becomes a valve, there's 
no need for mechanically moving parts. It is relatively easy to 
reduce the size of non-moving parts such as electrodes. 
Moreover, subtle control is possible since the closing of the 
valve is responsive to the strength of the electric field. 
  Although for this reason this mechanism has been considered 
advantageous for micromachine actuators, it hasn't been produced 
until now. This time a prototype basic mechanism was created 
that can move and is two centimeters long and three centimeters 
wide. The plan next is to further reduce its size. 
  It is believed that, compared to the static 
electricity-method that has been the mainstream for micromachine 
actuators, this new type using fluids from the exterior will 
display greater driving power relative to its size. It appears 
that by strengthening the force it will be possible to create 
engines for powerful micromachines.

  Professor Toshio Fukuda and others at Nagoya University 
have developed a line-tracing micro robot that travels on its 
own while evaluating its journey. The robot can distinguish 
between the color of the ground (white) and the color of the 
line (black), so its progress is controlled to stick to its 
course. The robot includes an actuator, photo-sensors, and logic 
circuits. Its dimensions are 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter by 1 
centimeter. The micro robot was created for a maze competition. 
Good results were achieved in experiments. 
  The width of the line corresponds to the size of the robot. 
Two photosensors distinguish white from black on the left and 
right. The robot's course is controlled by logic circuits. The 
actuator uses a combination of electromagnets and nylon angled 
hairs. 
  This was developed by Professor Fukuda and his associates. 
It 
uses a coil and an iron core that are drawn and repelled by 
turning electricity on and off. The angled hairs that act as the 
feet of the robot proceed as they are moved forward. A 
distinctive characteristic is that the hairs scratch the ground. 
  There is an electromagnet and angled hairs for both the left 
and right sides. Direction is changed by controlling their 
left-right movement. This was the first time that a 1 cm by 1 cm 
by 1 cm robot with sensing capability and logic circuits was 
used in a micro maze contest. It is noteworthy as a new micro 
robot system.

  [Text] Demand for CAD/CAM/CAE systems has been poor due to 
industry's cuts in capital spending. Of course, peripherals such 
as digitizer tablets and plotters are also suffering. However, 
even though users are experiencing an economic downturn, they're 
not giving up on R&amp;D. Rather, there is a trend because of the 
recession to put energy into developing new products that will 
distinguish themselves. Since CAD is essential to development 
departments, it has been hurt by recession, but not as much as 
machine tools, robots, and other production equipment. 
  According to industry estimates, the CAD systems market was 
&yen;600 billion in 1992. Given that the price of hardware has 
also fallen, the market is expected to fall significantly to 
&yen;400 billion in 1993. There isn't the kind of new demand 
there would be in a good economy. Revenues can be raised mainly 
by replacing other companies' equipment or by providing support. 
  CAE hasn't been hurt as much as CAD/CAM. Although until now 
CAE has been viewed as a tool used by specialists such as 
analysts, recently it's begun to be used by individual 
engineers. There appears to be considerable hidden demand for 
CAE. However, there are some cases in which negotiations have 
been held up by contract extensions and freezes. 
  The market for plotters (CAD drawing output devices) is 
about 
one-tenth that for CAD systems or about &yen;60 billion to 
&yen;80 billion. Demand from recession-ridden Europe has fallen 
dramatically and price decreases have lowered average prices, so 
the plotter market has shrunk by about 25% from the previous 
year and is in much worse shape than anticipated. Inkjet 
plotters, the only plotters encountering favorable conditions, 
sparked the price cuts. Manufacturers of pen plotters and 
thermal plotters introduced low-cost machines and cut prices in 
response to inkjet plotters. Fierce price competition has 
resulted. However, sales of low-cost machines are so-so compared 
to those of high-speed, high precision high-class machines. 
  Rapid prototyping systems, which can be considered as a kind 
of three-dimensional plotter, have also suffered from soft 
demand. But, growth is expected in this field because MITI has 
decided to support the rapid prototyping industry. 1993 sales 
are expected to go no higher than about fifteen systems, but 
about 40 sales are expected in 1994. The keys to increased 
demand will be the establishment of an industry organization and 
the resolution of technical and price issues. 
  The market for digitizer tablets (input devices) is less 
than 
that for plotters since they're aimed at designers who are 
oriented toward inputting using mice or keyboards. The market is 
&yen;10 billion, including exports. Those for the small computer 
graphics market are doing well, but, in general, digitizer 
tablets are doing worse than plotters. There's a trend for the 
rate of tablet attachment to CAD systems to decline. Some 
manufacturers have been directing their efforts toward pen input 
computers which can input almost like using a pencil to draw 
letters or a diagram.

  [Text] At its Ariake plant (Nagasu-machi, Kumamoto 
prefecture) Hitachi Zosen Corp. (Yoshihiro Fujii, president) has 
introduced a high-speed LAN (local area network) linking area 
from design to the production floor in a network, thus becoming 
the first in the shipbuilding industry to construct such a 
full-scale CIM (computer-integrated manufacturing) system. Use 
of the system will begin in December 1993. It will be applied 
first to a robot welding system using three-dimensional CAD/CAM 
(computer-aided design and manufacturing). The plan is to 
complete the implementation of CIM by expanding it to painting 
robots and materials and accounting departments after three 
years. This is expected to improve productivity by twenty to 
thirty percent. Appreciation of the yen has pitted Japan's 
shipbuilding industry against Korea in a difficult battle for 
orders. Hitachi Zosen aims to shrink the cost gap by raising its 
level of production technology. 
  The optical LAN to be introduced has transmission capability 
of 100 mega-bits (one mega equals one million) per second. It 
will directly connect company-developed three-dimensional design 
and development structural CAD data with individual systems such 
as NC (numerically controlled) cutting, welding robots, and pipe 
processing and will transmit data in real-time. Currently the 
application rate for robot welding is only 16%. When 
usage is 
expanded to three-dimensional curved surfaces, the automation 
rate will be raised to 50%. 
  A painting robot in the middle of field testing will be 
introduced in the new painting plant under construction which is 
expected to be completed in two years. It will be directly 
connected to CAD data. It is estimated that productivity of the 
painting process will double after completion. About &yen;2 
billion is being invested in the LAN, the painting plant, and so 
on. 
  Hitachi Zosen will use to the fullest extent the 
shipbuilding 
CIM under development by the Ship and Ocean Foundation (SOF) for 
constructing systematization of other production systems 
starting with the building simulation system, optimal production 
plans, a general process network system, and a management 
information monitoring system. 
  The business organization system for materials, accounting 
and other areas that is in operation will be integrated with the 
newly established optical network. It will be used for 
procurement of steel materials and electronic data interchange 
(EDI) with steel manufacturers. This will make it possible to 
integrate systems involving operations, estimates, design, 
procurement, and production. As soon as this implementation of 
CIM is completed, it will be introduced at the company's Maizuru 
(Kyoto Prefecture) and Kanagawa plants.

  [Text] A group including Professor Toshiro Kutsumiwa at the 
Osaka Institute of Technology has developed a CAD 
(computer-aided design) program using virtual reality for solid 
on-screen displays for automated drawing of initial 
configuration from parts that precedes consumer electronic 
products design. Drawing the initial configuation takes several 
minutes when designing products using CAD. This program will 
reduce that time to several seconds, thereby lessening the 
burden of design. 
  Consumer electronics products, such as vacuum cleaners and 
rice cookers, get their basic shape on a screen when CAD brings 
together the parts necessary for the product to function and 
then adds design on top of that. This program automatically 
draws the initial configuration that is the basis for design. 
The program shows a solid representation using virtual reality. 
This makes it easier to see the product's image. 
  This program uses a three-dimensional (3D) mouse to arrange 
the parts of the product shown using virtual reality. First it 
draws in space the right-angled parallelipeds that cover all the 
parts, then it divides those into tetrahedrons. The initial 
configuration is drawn through a process of successively erasing 
from right-angle parallelipeds to tetrahedrons. 
  For example, for a camera the lens, body, and other parts 
necessary for functioning are arranged in space. Restrictions 
are set so that kirikomi won't be dull, rectangular 
parallelipeds won't be cut into two, etc. When the program is 
used under these conditions it is possible to display the 
initial configuration necessary for the camera to function. 
  Usually a designer uses CAD to impose design on this initial 
configuration. Currently initial configurations are drawn using 
CAD. This is a problem because it takes several minutes and 
forces designers to do work outside their specialty. However, 
this program displays the initial configuration in about two 
seconds. It increases efficiency and allows designers to focus 
on creative activities. 
  The group plans to disseminate this program because it is a 
very practical program which even allows for changing parts in 
the initial configuration. However, the group intends to revise 
the program so it can draw curved lines so the initial 
configuration needn't be made up mainly of straight lines.

  INCS Inc. (3-2-1 Sakado Takatsu-ku Kawasaki City, president 
Shinjiro Yamada, Tel. 044-819-2419) has developed software that 
makes it possible to use data measured by CT scans for rapid 
prototyping (RP). It has begun a service using that RP system to 
create solid models of skulls using light-hardened resin. Price: 
&yen;150,000 each. Light-hardened resin models of skulls are 
beginning to be used in simulations meant to improve results of 
neurosurgery which requires high levels of technical skills. 
INCS entered this field in anticipation of increased demand. In 
January 1994 INCS will introduce a service using CT data to 
produce NC data for processing the ceramics appetite [sic] in 
areas deficient in skull and so on. 
  Skull models made by RP can be very useful when they are 
used 
prior to neurosurgery for decisions on surgical order and for 
practice in cutting open and removal using instruments just as 
in actual surgery. 
  The newly developed software adjusts for data lost due to CT 
scans measuring in two millimeter intervals. When CT scan data 
is sent to INCS, its model creation service will do everything 
from adjusting data to building models. It has already done this 
for Keio University Hospital. 
  D-MEC (Chuo-ku Tokyo), a company 100%-owned by Japan 
Synthetic Rubber, also has a skull model creation service and 
makes 100 per year. In October the Central Social Insurance 
Conference (an advisory body of the Central Medical Association 
and the Minister of Health and Welfare) recognized the ``Plan 
for Surgery Based on Life-Sized Solid Models of Intestines'' -- 
a plan submitted by two medical institutions (including Keio 
University Hospital) for consideration of pre-surgery diagnosis 
and surgical planning using life-sized solid models -- as a new 
advanced form of medical treatment. Accordingly, it is 
anticipated that demand for RP models of skulls will increase. 
  Process data on appetite in deficient portions of skulls is 
revised on the basis of CT scan data and is created after being 
transferred to CAM (computer aided manufacturing). Thus RP 
technology can be used from diagnosis to treatment.

  The first version of STEP, an ISO international standard 
for CAD/CAM systems' data conversion, will be issued in April 
1994. STEP, a product model data conversion standard, is the 
result of development by specialists in Japan, the U.S., Europe 
and other countries. It appears that all twelve parts of STEP's 
initial release finally will be lined up and will be released as 
part of the ISO 10303 document. In Japan, participants in the 
STEP Center -- including companies such as Toshiba, NEC, 
Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Mitsubishi Electric -- have succeeded in 
experiments using STEP data conversion management prototype 
systems to convert data from drawings, thus confirming that data 
can be converted accurately. The time is arriving for practical 
applications of STEP. It is anticipated that a second version of 
STEP will be issued after two to three years during which data 
conversion experiments involving international joint development 
will continue to expand the applicability of data conversion. 
<H5>  ``Version 2'' in Two to Three Years </H5>
  Currently several intermediate file formats such as IGES and 
DXF are used as data conversion standards for CAD/CAM systems. 
However, these have defects such as vagueness in interpretation 
of specifications and inability to be converted to product 
management information due to data conversion's focus on display 
data. Moreover, demand for data conversion between different 
systems is rising with the increasing complexity and 
sophistication of data conversion as LANs (local area networks) 
spread and CAD/CAM systems' capabilities advance. STEP solves 
the problems of existing standards and proceeds toward 
standardization with the goal of achieving complete data 
convertibility at all stages of product lifecycles. 
<H5>  Success in Conversion Experiments </H5>
  A data conversion management prototype system using the STEP 
standard has already been developed. Experiments have been 
carried out which successfully converted the 3-dimensional solid 
model, 2-dimensional basic geometric shape, free curve and curve 
shape data that is essential to STEP. The development system has 
been revised for V01, V02, and the improved version of V01. For 
the improved version of V02, specification definitions are 
described in EXPRESS language for conversion between data models 
and general-purpose systems that rely on a special application 
protocol. Some of the special features are as follows. A 
dictionary is automatically generated from the schema described 
EXPRESS. SPI (standard application programming interface) is 
offered. The dual advantages of the code creation method and the 
real-time interpretation method are used. A STEP environment 
(STEP cell) is offered. 
  This development system is used for conducting experiments 
on 
data conversion of 2-dimensional drawing data between current 
commercial CAD systems and will expand experimentation to 
3-dimensional data, product modeling, industry-specific 
application models, and so on. This is for the purpose of 
issuing version 2 of the ISO's STEP standard in two to three 
years. The phrase ``data conversion for CAD/CAM systems'' 
doesn't suggest the variety and breadth of fields that are 
affected by STEP. 
<H5>  Unconscious of Compatibility </H5>
  The first version of the standard which will be issued in 
April 1994 is about two thousand pages of standards on twelve 
topics [sic]: overview; EXPRESS language specifications; 
physical files and mapping rules; methodology, framework, and 
general concept for verification; foundation for product 
description and support; framework for expression of shape 
expression (geometric and phase); product structure and 
composition; representation; basic models of products; drawings; 
and composition management design. 
  Practical application of STEP, the key to integrating 
next-generation CAD/CAM systems, makes possible the accurate and 
efficient conversion by differing machines of vast quantities of 
design data created and amassed by CAD/CAM systems. This means 
that product design can be made more efficient and design 
quality can be increased through the integrated use of design 
data between and inside companies. Moreover, CAD/CAM users will 
be able to replace and introduce new kinds of CAD/CAM systems 
without thinking about compatibility. STEP-based accurate data 
conversion between CAD/CAM systems is essential for progressing 
with system architecture for CIM (computer-integrated 
manufacturing) which is being promoted as part of the corporate 
movement toward greater use of information systems. 
  The STEP Center is continuing with data conversion 
experiments with an eye to establishing the second version of 
STEP. The experiments will aim at achieving perfect conversion 
of product model data by addressing problems such as the small 
differences between CAD/CAM systems in data expression 
specifications even when data is accurately converted by STEP. 
For example, this involves small differences such as the size of 
characters and shape of arrows.

  The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology's 
Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (Ken'ichi Matsuno, Director) 
has set a goal of developing new electric discharge processing 
technology which would make it possible to process freely even 
the interior of metal receptacles with small entrances which are 
difficult to process. It is possible to process even previously 
unprocessible spots when an ``electric blade'' using electric 
discharge is guided by laser beams. 
  The new technology is called the laser-induced electric 
discharge processing method. 
  Electricity is passed through the metal which is the 
material 
to be processed. Electric current is applied at low voltage 
between the material to be processed (negative pole) and copper 
wire (positive pole). This leads to electric discharge at the 
end of the copper wire. When a laser beam is simultaneously 
shone on the negative pole, metal plasma is created at the point 
where the beam is radiated and the electric discharge from the 
copper wire flies at the plasma. Voltage is low so insulation 
within the atmosphere will be low and electric discharge will 
easily occur. 
  An experiment was conducted in which a YAG laser (output: 
0.45 joules) one millimeter in diameter was shined on the 
surface of a one millimeter thick copper sheet (negative pole) 
and electric discharge was induced from the copper wire 
(positive pole) on the back through a hole opened in the copper 
sheet to the point where the laser was shined. The distance 
between the negative and positive poles was 50 to 100 
millimeters and voltage was 100 volts to one kilowatt. 
Atmospheric pressure was ten to 400 pascals. 
  The experiment showed that the electric discharge can be 
guided to make a u-turn from the point where the laser beam 
radiates opposite the hole through the copper sheet. When 
voltage is high the electric discharge is diffused around the 
point of laser radiation, but when voltage is low, electric 
discharge can be made to occur within a diameter of one 
millimeter around the point of laser radiation. When laser beams 
are reflected off a mirror, then it should be possible to 
process inside metal receptacles.

  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
will aggressively support stereolithographic rapid prototyping 
beginning in fiscal year 1994. First, in January it plans to 
establish a Rapid Prototyping Industry Association (tentative 
name) for dissemination, R&amp;D, and fact-finding surveys. The 
association will be made up of rapid prototyping apparatus 
manufacturers such as D-MEC, a wholly owned company of Japan 
Synthetic Rubber, users such as the Mitsubishi group's CMET, and 
men of learning and experience. 
  It will grapple with the raising the level of rapid 
prototyping (RP) in a four-year &yen;800 million plan as part of 
the theme of ``Technology Development Work for Supporting 
Knowledge Concentration in Small-Medium Companies'' of the Small 
Business National Corporation to be newly established in fiscal 
year 1994. 
  The purpose of MITI's support of the RP industry is to 
promote new businesses in materials process technology 
industries such as metal patterns. 
  RP technology is a method of creating 3-dimensional (3D) 
forms layer by layer using CAD (computer-aided design) data and 
light-hardenable resin on which laser beams are shined. MITI 
sees RP technology as a basic technology for making things which 
can't be made using metal patterns. MITI hopes that it will tie 
in with the automation of design and will have broad 
applications in medicine and welfare, too. It wishes to support 
this technology as a new business for the metal pattern and 
casting industries in which small-medium companies predominate. 
  However, since RP apparatus is expensive -- about &yen;50 
million per machine -- its use is limited to applications such 
as industrial working models and human periosteum. Accordingly, 
R&amp;D themes include topics such as lowering costs of 
manufacturing apparatus, laser development, technology for 
application to casting machinery, and collaboration on CAD data. 
Participants in the Rapid Prototyping Industry Association will 
include manufacturers (such as Mitsui Engineering and 
Shipbuilding Co., Denken, and 3D Systems of the U.S.), and 
software companies, users, research institutions, and men of 
learning and experience involved with RP. The initial general 
meeting is to be held in January 1994. 
  A cooperative association for promoting R&amp;D will be set 
up in 
parallel with the Small Business National Corporation.

  The research group of Professor Takaaki Nagao and Assistant 
Professor Mamoru Teruishi of the industrial mechanical 
engineering department of the University of Tokyo's engineering 
faculty has developed a precision machining system that can 
fully use the senses of sight and hearing. 
  Precision machining, unlike ordinary machining, generates 
virtually no noise. The beauty of the new system is that it 
transforms resistance to cutting into artificial noise in 
response to the degree of strength used. The operator feels as 
if he has entered and is working in a micro-world which makes 
his work easier. Assistant Professor Teruishi mentioned plans 
for applying the technology to ``micromachine production, 
computer board wiring modification, and micro-surgery such as 
connecting nerves.'' 
  This system can be used to detect strength when a strength 
sensor is attached to a tool used in micro-work. It does 
parallel processing by computer of output from the tool's 
movement and strength sensor. 
  There are two types of methods of converting degree of 
strength into noise. The first is to amplify directly the output 
of the strength sensor into noise. The other is to create 
man-made sound in proportion to strength. Either method produces 
a man-made sound similar to that produced when large objects are 
machined. In experiments, paint was removed that had been 
painted on an aluminum alloy surface of several millimeters 
angle. The tool had a long narrow chisel of 0.15 millimeters in 
diameter. Paint was cut away as the operator watched tool's tip 
displayed enlarged on a monitor screen by a charge coupled 
device (CCD) camera. Human hand movements were conveyed through 
a computer to the manipulator moving the chisel. It was 
difficult to work with steady strength by relying on the monitor 
image, so strength changed greatly. However, when man-made noise 
was generated simultaneously, pushing was almost steadily 
controlled at optimal value. 
  Operators who machine metals, woods, and other materials 
make 
use not only of sight, but also of hearing and of sensations 
felt from the tool. Sound provides very valuable information for 
machining. The strength and the highs and lows of the sound 
generated by the contact between the tool and the machined 
material is important for controlling the strength of the tool. 
  However, although reflected information can be collected by 
microscope and CCD cameras and strength information can be 
collected by strength sensors, it was difficult to make the 
noise emitted by micro-machining loud enough for humans to hear 
because it is lower than the noise level picked up by a 
microphone.

  [Text] The research group of Professors Yotaro Hatamura and 
Professor Seinosuke Nagao of the industrial mechanical 
engineering department of the University of Tokyo's engineering 
faculty has developed tools for micro machining that can hold 
close and cut objects as small as 0.01-0.1 millimeters. The tool 
was made for the special purpose of machining micromachines. 
Prototypes were made for a drawing-to-itself-tool for forming 
micro-substances and for a cutting tool. Next, the research 
group will develop a machining system that will permit 
interchanging tools for micro machining as needed while viewing 
the machined material under an electron microscope. 
  The newly developed ``hikitsuke'' tool succeeded in 
attracting to itself copper wire 80 microns (one micron is 
one-thousandth of one millimeter) in diameter and millimeters 
long and also a silicon block with dimensions of 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.6 
millimeters. Three methods of attracting objects are used: air 
sucking force, liquid surface tension, and static electric force. 
  The air sucking force method combines a glass tube with an 
inside diameter of 0.1 millimeter and a vacuum pump. It attaches 
the object at the end of the glass tube using air sucking force. 
The liquid surface tension method uses surface tension created 
by sending a liquid (water was used in experiments) to the end 
of the same glass pipe. The static electricity method attracts 
by using static electricity created by supplying voltage in 
between the tool and the platform on which the object rests. 
Experiments succeeded in opening indentations the same as that 
on dice on 300 micron angle salt crystals using a chisel-type 
cutting tool. The chisel is used on super-hard metal alloys with 
a blade tip 10 microns wide applied to the processed object and 
with added sonic vibration.

  [Text] Assistant Professor Masahiro Asada and others in a 
Tokyo Institute of Technology research group succeeded in making 
an experimental quantum box laser and confirmed its oscillation. 
Theoretically, it is predicted that this future-type 
semiconductor laser will make ultra-low current oscillation 
possible. This laser is different from the conventional element 
which consists of layers of ultra-thin semiconductor film. The 
new structure lines up minute semiconductor particles that are 
30 nanometers in size. With this structure, the electrons can be 
used for radiation without waste. Right now it is necessary to 
supply a large current under an ultra-low temperature condition 
and the laser is not at the point where its full potential can 
be realized. However, it can be expected in the future that the 
performance level can be raised if the manufacturing technology 
is improved. 
  Minute semiconductor particles are lined up. 
  The experimental laser consists of a plane surface 
indium-gallium-arsenide film with many particle forms of 
gallium-indium-arsenide lined up in a grid pattern and embedded 
in it. This film itself is sandwiched between indium-phosphorus 
films. The diameter of a single particle is 30 nanometers, the 
thickness is 12 nanometers, and the space between adjoining 
particles is 70 nanometers. 
  These kinds of semiconductor particles are called ``quantum 
boxes'' since the electrons are confined in these particles one 
by one just as if they are in boxes. The conventional 
semiconductor laser is a thin film with electrons held in it. 
The electrons can be trapped in a much smaller space when this 
is chopped up into boxes and it is predicted that the radiation 
efficiency will be exceptionally advanced. 
  For this reason, in comparison with semiconductor lasers 
actually in use at the present time, it is possible that these 
lasers will be able to oscillate with only several tenths or 
less of the current. Since the current consumption is small, the 
result is that heat generation and such will not be a problem 
even if a number of them are grouped together and it is expected 
that the laser will be useful in the development of optical 
communications and optical computers. 
  In experiments with the experimental laser at 196 degrees 
below zero Celsius, light pulses were oscillated at about 1.3 
microns. It was also confirmed that the quantum box confined the 
electrons well. However, the current necessary for oscillation 
is 1.1 amperes, which, when compared with the current required 
by a conventional semiconductor laser, is rather larger.

  [Text] 
  Demand for MCM (Multi-Chip Modules) has been doubling every 
year, and the market will grow to &yen;3-4 trillion in the year 
2000. Toshiba envisioning this market growth is going to 
strategize the business largely by employing 2 kinds of MCM 
semicustom products. When the LSI design rule reaches less than 
0.5 m level, it will become difficult to lower the cost of 
LSI in order to produce a single chip on Si. On the other hand, 
Toshiba sees that the price of MCM which has a strong market 
demand will fall, its development time will be shortened, and 
the market will expand steadily. Customization will allow for 
the reduction of cost and development time. 
  The packaging and wiring will be partially regulated by the 
company, and the chip will be used like design methods seen in a 
semicustom LSI. Of the two types of chips, one will be made on a 
ceramic baseboard in consideration of low cost, and the other 
will be made by deposition of thin film in consideration of 
performance. The design kit was developed jointly with CAD 
vendors following the method of development seen in ASIC. As for 
testing at this time, although the issue must be resolved in the 
future, the bare chip on board was interfaced by using a special 
socket. 
  The MCM market is expected to grow and the sales of MCM 
employing a semicustom design and manufacturing method have 
started. The demand for MCM is projected to grow to &yen;3-4 
trillion in the year 2000. In order to accommodate the demand, 
low cost and short development time are essential (figure 1). 
For this reason, the shape of baseboard and the part of wiring 
inside the baseboard were regulated, and two types of MCM 
employing a design and manufacturing method following the idea 
of semicustom LSIs were realized. The importance of price 
constraints was emphasized with one type of MCM which started 
selling in October, 1993. The importance of the performance 
constraint was emphasized in the other type of the MCM which 
will start selling in April, 1994. Active promotion will take 
place starting from April, 1994. 


  In design rule before 0.5 m level, a single chip had a 
cost advantage for compact high speed functions requiring 
multiple chips. However, in LSI with high end logic on board 
when less than 0.5 m level reached, it is viewed that MCM 
may 
be advantageous in cost in many areas. Furthermore, because of 
system integration, various kinds of processors will be placed 
on board and then MCM will become more advantageous. Before 0.5 
m level is reached, in terms of cost and characteristics, a 
single chip had an advantage by employing next generation

processing technology. After about 3 years, cost and performance 
were improved, and products using MCM were never created. In 
leading edge high tech devices seeking high speed, the ratio of 
preprocessing cost was rather high, and packaging costs could be 
ignored, and were not included. 


<H5>  &yen;3-4 Trillion Market Expansion In Year 2000 </H5>
  The size of MCM market is doubling every year. Aside from 
the 
demand from military and supercomputer makers, the reason for 
this demand is: (a) a need for MCM is found in high performance 
WS (work stations); (b) the lower cost of MCM is seen instead of 
using LSIs with high end logic on board after the 0.5 m 
level 
is reached in large scale logic. 
  The reason for (a) is because of the demand for small 
computer systems in which high speed, large scale, and short 
development time are increasing. A typical example is the WS, 
which plays a key role in the MCM market growth. Because of the 
requirement of high speed over 100 MHz, it is difficult to 
interface with the chips on board due to the wiring delay. On 
the other hand, because of the desirability of incorporating 
MPU, which is leading edge technology, in the system, business 
can not afford to wait for progress in the development of single 
chip on board such as catch SRAM. Competition in product 
development is fierce, and a half year delay will be caught by 
other competitors resulting in a profit loss of fifty percent. 
  Also because communication devices such as ATM will need 
high 
speed, MCM will dominate the market. Even in an inexpensive 
commercial product, if the device is used like a computer game 
with a RISC processor and high speed graphics accelerator on 
board, MCM will be necessary. For example, screen compression 
expansion chips used for multimedia need 50M - 200 MHz, 
10[.sup]6[/] - 10[.sup]7[/] transistors. 
<H5>  Difficulty Of Producing Lower Cost Single Chip </H5>
  Furthermore, when design rule reaches the 0.5 m level, 
large scale circuits such as high end logic on board will not be 
cost effective and the use of MCM will become more advantageous 
in some areas. In order to clarify this relationship, take the 
example of a system which consists of A, B, C, &amp; D chips of 
some 
generation (see figure 2). Simply making single chips by 
employing the same generation technology becomes expensive. That 
is to say, a single chip needs a certain chip area and system 
scale. 
  After 0.5 m level, the relationship between cost and 
chip 
area will cause the parallel shift to an upward (rising) 
direction. For example, in the era of future microprocessors in 
0.35 m level, there will be four layers of wiring. 
Presently, 
LSI makers are studying low cost processing, but the process 
needed to obtain high performance makes it increasingly 
difficult to reduce the cost. In large scale chips, even if the 
next generation minute processing is used, there are cases in 
which a single chip will not yield a low cost. 
<H5>  Realization Of Low Cost And Short Development Time </H5>
  In order to respond to the MCM market, the characteristics 
of 
low cost and short development time which were not found in 
previous MCM needed to be realized in addition to high speed, 
large scale, and compactness. Here a general classification of 
MCM technology is described: (1) Manufacturing technology such 
as a baseboard; (2) Design and CAD technology; and (3) Testing 
(table 1). Mainly the technology of manufacturing and testing 
will influence cost, and technology of manufacturing and design 
and CAD will influence the development time.

  Low cost of manufacturing in (1) was achieved by employing a 
ceramic baseboard. In addition to a low price baseboard, if the 
same baseboard is used in various areas by customizing, low cost 
will be realized for mass production. The manufacturing time is 
shortened by already prepared baseboards that are regulated. In 
design and CAD technology (2), a tool was developed jointly with 
CAD makers to be used by system designers with no previous 
experience in MCM development. By using this tool, system 
designers can design MCM in a short period of time. In testing 
(3), common socket and test equipment were semi-customized in 
order to test a bare chip in which MCM on board will be placed. 
Therefore testing cost was reduced. 
<H5>  Two Types Prepared Using Ceramic Baseboard </H5>
  In manufacturing technology (1), the reason ceramic 
baseboard 
is more advantageous in terms of cost than a printed circuit 
board or thin film baseboard is because of remarkable price drop 
in multi-layer ceramic baseboards. Ceramic is also suitable for 
the high speed and high integration demanded by the market. 
  For a low cost product, ``TAM10C Series'' (figure 3) using 
alumina (Al[.sup]2[/]0[.sub]3[/]) ceramic multi-layer 
baseboard, and for high speed products over 100 M Hz, ``TAM10Z 
Series'' (figure 4) combining ceramic and deposit of thin film 
of Cu/Polyimide were developed. In reality, MCM-L using printed 
circuit board is cheaper, but the wiring rule is difficult. 
Also, MCM-D using thin film technology is high in performance 
but it is expensive. The big gap in the difference in cost and 
wiring density is quite extreme, and a feeling of Rtoo short for 
a sash but too long for a beltS reflects the demand (table 2).

  In order to realize a semicustom method which is effective 
in 
shortening the manufacturing time, packaging (baseboard), I/O 
structure, assembly tools, test tools, and common part of wiring 
of a power supply and junction layer are standardized. By doing 
this, the experimental product was manufactured in about four 
weeks which shortened the time needed for traditional products 
by half. In MCM-D/C in which Cu/Polyimide thin film is 
deposited, the ceramic part is standardized, and can be prepared 
ahead of time. Because ceramic baking time is eliminated, 
manufacturing time is greatly shortened. 
<H5>  Prepare For Design Environment Following ASIC </H5>
  In design and CAD technology (2), in order to effectively 
promote MCM, a design environment which is easy to use and needs 
less time was built. From input of design information to 
analysis of heat and delay, total flows of design are integrated. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-44A>           Figure 3. MCM-C Using Ceramic Baseboard... </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-44B>           Figure 4. MCM-D/C Thin Film of Cu/Polydimide Is Deposited On Ceramic Baseboard... </FIG>

  MCM design flow can analyze system design, baseboard design, 
wiring, and verification. Following the pattern of ASIC, a 
development support tool, ``MCM Design Kit'' was developed 
jointly with Cadence Design Systems, Inc. in US, Mentor Graphics 
Corporation, and CAD vendors. MCM is designed by using a wiring 
tool which CAD vendors have, a transmission line analysis tool, 
and a heat analysis tool. The design kit has a library which has 
design rules and chip heat and delay information, functions to 
allocate terminals automatically, and functions to estimate heat 
and delay easily. 
  The future topic in design is to form a model of chip 
function. The product this time interfaces with gate level, but 
in the future if large scale interface is considered, a 
functional model will be desirable. However, although the 
functional model of main processor and peripheral chips has 
started its sales quite recently, it will require a long time 
and a great deal of labor to realize the goal. Already some 
companies have produced a functional model, but the product is 
quite expensive and it will take 2 to 3 years to penetrate the 
market. 
<H5>  Prepared Special Socket For Bare Chip </H5>
  In testing (3), the special socket will be used for the 
testing of the bare chip. The bare chip test will influence the 
cost of MCM. Because if the production of MCM is idled due to 
bad quality, then the production of other chips will be idled, 
which propagates the production idling problems. Employing a 
burn-in test using a special socket, will reduce idling time 
caused by failure. 
  Considering the promotion of products, there is a limit for 
one company to supply several kinds of chips, and we wish to 
produce MCM which incorporates several chips on board supplied 
by multiple LSI makers. To do this, multiple semiconductor 
makerUs KGD (known good die) will be necessary. In the US, a few 
companies such as Intel Corporation and Micro Technology 
Incorporated have just started to supply these. Looking at the 
chip, it appears more expensive than a sealed packaged chip, and 
the problem of KGD is more severe. It will take two-three years 
to gain wide recognition for the bare chip. 
  In module testing, different types of necessary sockets are 
eliminated and because of semicustomization cost increases are 
controlled. Designated test patterns will be necessary to check 
chip failures from certain pins at assembly after MCM is made. 
On the other hand, if a chip which has a boundary scan circuit 
on board is used, the problem will be solved. The report on the 
automatic tool which generates a boundary scan test pattern that 
was standardized as IEEE 1149.1 at JTAG (Joint Test Action 
Group) has already been announced. 
  In the case of placing chips which do not have a boundary 
scan, the method of testing will be a future topic to study. In 
reality, test patterns performed by users or machines verify 
pass or fail tests. Furthermore, in order to interface to high 
speed chips, the development of testers for high precision 
multiple pin devices will be critical.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electronics has developed a phase shift 
exposure technology for GaAs MMIC gates, which can interface 
with mass production enabling formation of 0.35 m electrode 
patterns. 
  GaAs MMIC is desirable for high frequency applications in 
which high output and high effective power are needed such as 
mobile and satellite communications. For these reasons, the gate 
pattern is narrowed from 0.5 m to 0.35 m. The 
characteristics which made it possible to succeed with 0.35 
m 
level phase shift exposure technology are: 
  /m(1) Employment of shifter with sharp edge formation 
  /m(2) Optimization of shifter placement 
  /m(3) Optimization of image reversal resist process 
  By employing an edge model phase shifter, when the shifter 
is 
in position (figure 1(a)), it reverses the light phase on the 
mask, and the phase shift of oscillation width of passing light 
is reversed at the right and left of the shifter edge (figure 1 
(b)). When this image is formed on a wafer, light intensity at 
the shifter edge becomes almost zero (figure 1 (c)), and a 
minute dark area is transferred as a pattern, thus a 0.35 m 
pattern is formed. 
  In optimization of shifter formation and shifter placement, 
the width of the shifter was set to over 5 m on the mask, 
thickness of the shifter was set 4000 +/- 450 Angstroms, and the 
angle of shifter edge was set 90 +/- 20 , so that 
asymmetrical pattern due to aberrations of projection lens was 
controlled. 
  Also although traditionally in formation of high output GaAs 
MMIC gate electrodes, recess etching in active layer, gate metal 
vapor adhesion, and recess model gate by a lift off process 
using an organic solvent were employed, a resist pattern 
process, which works well for formation of overhang as well as 
an effective organic solvent, were needed. For this reason a 
reverse image resist process, which can obtain a negative in 
order to form a minute small dark area by edge model phase 
shift, was developed. Formation of a stable 0.35 m level 
recess gate was realized. 
  In this process, tolerance of over 2 m focus is 
obtained 
in pattern dimensions of 0.35 +/- 0.05 m, and the value for 
the dimensions is 3 _s_  0.03m which is quite 
comfortable for mass production.

  [Text] Japan Electronic Industry Development Association 
(JEIDA) and others have established a guideline controlling 
low-frequency electromagnetic interference generated by computer 
displays. This action is taken in response to user anxiety 
expressed over possible hazardous effects of an electromagnetic 
wave on human body. The association's member firms will 
self-impose the standard on products destined for the domestic 
market. Sweden's MPR-II standard is used as reference in 
formulating the regulations. Targeted products are CRT and 
liquid crystal displays. 
  The question of possible hazardous effects of low-frequency 
electromagnetic interference on human body, generated by 
computer displays, had surfaced many times during the past 10 
years or more. Until now, however, no definite conclusion has 
been offered. Perhaps, it is not the type of question which can 
yield a clear-cut conclusion. Under such circumstances, a 
short-cut to dispelling user anxiety is to control a level of 
emission of low-frequency electromagnetic interference 
considered hazardous to health. 
  In October 1993, JEIDA and Japan Business Machine Makers 
Association established ``A Guideline concerning Low Frequency 
Electromagnetic Interference Generated by Displays Used in 
Information Processing Equipment'' (Hereinafter, referred to as 
the guideline). The guideline designated allowable emission 
levels to control the intensity of electromagnetic interference 
generated by computer displays. The established guideline is 
applicable not only to CRT but also to liquid crystal and plasma 
displays. Measurement procedures and conditions of electric and 
magnetic interference also will be regulated. 
<H5>  Application of Guideline Will Begin in 1996 in Stages </H5>
  Japan Electronic Industry Development Association will treat 
the guideline as the industry's self-imposed regulatory control. 
For now, firms which are members of the association, will 
self-impose the guideline on their products sold on the domestic 
market. 
  Ample time is allowed before the regulatory guideline 
becomes 
effective. It has been stated that the guideline will be 
applicable only to those products manufactured after January 
1996. After January 1998, however, all products are said to be 
subject to the regulatory guideline. 
  In October 1991, moreover, the JEIDA has established a 
standard regulating display's static electricity . At that time, 
the Electronic Industries Association of Japan's name appeared 
as one of those involved in developing specifications. In 
establishing a standard this time, however, JEIDA has deferred 
the participation of the Electronic Industries Association of 
Japan. 
<H5>  Japan Trying to Catch Up with U.S. and Europe </H5>
  Japan lags somewhat behind the United States and Europe in 
the regulatory aspect of handling low-frequency electromagnetic 
interference. In the United States and Europe, it is becoming a 
common practice for both end users and computer makers to ensure 
that products satisfy designated emission levels in accordance 
with the established regulations similar to Japan's guideline. 
MPR-II, established by Sweden's official organ, SWEDAC (Swedish 
Board for Technical Accreditation), is the standard most 
frequently consulted. Especially in Europe, this is becoming 
essential, to the point that ``no matter how inexpensive 
products are, the market demands that products adhere to the 
standard established by MPR-II.'' (according to a technician 
working for a display maker). 
  Although the number of MPR-II products for the domestic 
market has been increasing in Japan, still there are a large 
number of products to which no standard has been applied. One of 
the reasons is that Japanese users are not as demanding in this 
respect as their European and American counterparts. However, 
the situation may change overnight. Anticipating this, the JEIDA 
made a move to establish a guideline. 
<H5>  Lenient on Regulating of Electric Fields Emissions </H5>
  In many ways, the guideline follows MPR-II. MPR-II standard 
products, therefore, will be automatically given the seal of 
approval. The low-frequency range of electric and magnetic 
fields allowed by the regulation, as well as the method of 
measurement, basically is the same as those of MPR-II. 
  Levels of electric interference allowed by the Japanese 
guideline and MPR-II, however, differ widely. Those established 
by Japan Electronic Industry Development Association are 50V/m 
or 250V/m with band I (5Hz-2kHz) and 10V/m for band II 
(2kHz-400kHz), which are considerably more lenient than the 
MPR-II's designated values of 25V/m (band I) and 2.5V/m (band 
II). The association's target value for band I varies depending 
on whether grounding is possible or not. The target values for 
the magnetic field are the same as MPR-II's. 
  In setting the allowable levels of interference, Japan 
Electronic Industry Development Association considered 
standardization movements other than MPR-II. At present, the 
United State's IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers, Inc.) and Europe's ECMA (European Computer 
Manufacturers Association are studying similar guidelines. The 
association used the figures appeared in a draft of the ECMA-172 
Standard. 
  Difference between the Japan Electronic Industry Development 
Association's standard and MPR-II lies in cost involved to 
achieve target values. 
  The target value of MPR-II has been determined by 
considering 
two factors, that it is within the range of the technically 
feasible and that this can be achieved without spending a 
substantial amount. Since effects of electromagnetic 
interference on human body is not clear at this time, the target 
values are determined purely on a technical basis. 
  The target values established by Japan Electronic Industry 
Development Association are aiming for the level which enables 
Japan to manufacture displays at lower cost than that of the 
MPR-II products. Even at these target values, since they are 
substantially lower than the standard set in fields other than 
displays, we believe that it will be easy for JEIDA to achieve 
its goal. 
  Reason why only the target values of electrical interference 
are set high is ``electrical interference is more difficult to 
mitigate than magnetic interference'' (a technician from a 
display maker). In order to control electrical interference 
generated by displays, we have either to lower internally 
generated electrical interference itself or to use shielding. 
For instance, with CRT, we can use a shielding method by mixing 
coating with a conductive material and apply it to a tube 
surface. However, this method can be extremely costly if 
materials with superior shielding characteristics are to be 
developed.

  [Text] Matsushita Electronic Industrial Co. Ltd. has 
developed a DC-type, 26-inch (896 x 512 pixel) color plasma 
display. With an improved operating life of 10,000 hours, and 
increased brightness of 150 cd/m[.sup]2[/], the new display 
meets the requirements for practical usage. The problem of short 
lifespan was resolved by adding a resistor to each display cell 
which comprises a picture element. By passing the discharge 
current through the resistor, the current can be limited; 
thereby improving the efficiency of light emission. This results 
in extended lifespan. Brightness was increased by extending the 
application of phosphor from the bottom of the cell to the 
sidewalls of the cell. 
  Flat panel displays are generally used in two types of 
applications. The first is in office equipment such as personal 
computer and workstation displays, and the second is in 
audio/visual type uses such as in flat televisions. For the 
office applications, liquid crystal panels have already come 
into practical use. However, using liquid crystal panels for 
audio/visual applications has not been practical due to the 
panels' limited screen size. Development of 20-inch (diagonal) 
and larger panels has been underway. 
  The plasma display panel (PDP) has drawn attention as a 
possible candidate for flat panel televisions because it can be 
produced in large sizes (40-inch), and because due to its wide 
angle of visibility, can be viewed from an angle. However, 
commercialization lagged behind that of the liquid crystal panel 
because of problems with low light emission efficiency, dark 
screen, and short operating life. 
  In 1993, the color PDP finally arrived on the market. 
Fujitsu 
began selling an AC-type 21-inch color PDP having a lifespan of 
10,000 hours or more, and screen brightness of 200 
cd/m[.sup]2[/].[.sup]1)[/] The operating life of this 
product rivals that of the CRT, and brightness also approaches 
that of the CRT. Subsequently, Matsushita Electronic Industrial 
Co., together with NHK at the NHK Broadcasting Laboratory, 
developed a DC-type 26-inch color PDP having a brightness of 150 
cd/m[.sup]2[/] and a life of 10,000 hours, with a view toward 
commercialization. Large panels can be easily produced since the 
vacuum film growth process needed for AC-type panels is not 
required for the DC-type panel. 
  At present, DC-type panels are being developed by 
Matsushita, 
Oki Electric Industrial Co., and Dainippon Insatsu, with efforts 
focused at the NHK Broadcasting Laboratory. One objective is to 
achieve a practical 55-inch panel which can be used for 
high-definition TV broadcasting of the Winter Olympics to be 
held in Nagano in 1998. However, the immediate goal is to 
achieve by 1995 a practical 30-inch panel which can be used for 
EDTV II broadcasting or for the current NTSC TV broadcasting 
system. Resolving the problems of brightness and lifespan with 
the new 26-inch panel brings achieving this goal one step closer. 
<H5>  Phosphor Emits Light Using Ultraviolet Rays </H5>
  In the color PDP, ultraviolet rays are generated by gas 
discharge, and they are injected into the phosphor to enable a 
color display. The panel consists of two glass plates facing 
each other with a gap of about 200 m between. Gas is sealed 
inside this gap (see Figure 1). Electrode lines are formed in 
the glass plates for alignment, and a single display cell is 
defined by the intersection of these lines. Red, green, and blue 
phosphor is applied to each display cell according to the 
arrangement shown in Table 1. Each display cell is separated 
from other cells by a partition to form a very small discharge 
tube. The partition maintains the spacing between glass plates 
and also prevents color smear between display cells.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-48A>           Figure 1.  Structure of the 26-Inch Pulse Memory DC PDP. </FIG>

  A gas which radiates ultraviolet rays is used for the color 
PDP. The new panel uses a mixture of helium (95%) and 
xenon 
(5%) gas. Although the discharge gas is almost colorless, 
xenon 
emits 147nm ultraviolet rays. These ultraviolet rays excite the 
phosphor, resulting in the generation of visible light. For the 
phosphor, an improved type of that used in fluorescent lamps for 
illumination purpose is used. With the phosphor ordinarily used 
in fluorescent lighting, mercury atoms emit a peak excitation in 
254nm wavelength ultraviolet rays. When this is shifted toward 
the shorter wavelength side, it can be used for the PDP. The 
aspect ratio of the screen is 16:9, to match high definition 
broadcasting. Display size is about 670mm (26-inches diagonal), 
which roughly rivals a 28-inch type CRT display. The pixels 
(cells) are arranged in a ``quartet'' configuration, with each 
side of the square being 0.65mm. 512 cells are arranged 
vertically and 896 are aligned horizontally to make up the 
screen. 
<H5>  Field is Divided into Eight Parts for Gradient Display </H5>
  The panel is driven by means of a pulse memory system (see 
Figure 2).[.sup]2)[/] While a voltage (maintenance pulse) 
which does not cause discharge is applied to all cells, a write 
pulse having the voltage needed to initiate discharge of only 
desired cells is input synchronously with a scanning pulse. Once 
initiated, discharge continues by means of the maintenance pulse 
voltage. To discontinue the discharge, a pulse voltage lower 
than the maintenance pulse is input. (This is called the cancel 
pulse.) If this PDP were to be driven using a simple matrix 
system (time division system), the maximum duty ratio (display 
time ratio) would be 1/512. Since the light emission period is 
short, sufficient brightness cannot be achieved. When the pulse 
memory system is used, the display discharge can be continued 
for a fixed time by means of the maintenance pulse, so 
illumination time can be extended. This is the advantage of the 
pulse memory system. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-48B>           Figure 2.  Drive Waveforms in the Pulse Memory System. </FIG>



  The scanning pulse and subsequent maintenance voltage is 
applied consecutively to each of the 512 cathodes. During this 
time, a maintenance pulse is applied constantly to the anode. 
The maintenance pulse and the scanning pulse are out of phase 
with each other, and discharge does not begin when only one or 
the other pulse is applied. To cause the display discharge, a 
write pulse which is synchronized with the scanning pulse is 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-49A>  Figure 3. Principle of 256 Gradient Display by Subfield Division. </FIG>

applied to the anode. The voltage difference between electrodes 
which occurs due to the write pulse and the scanning pulse must 
be set higher than the discharge initiation voltage. 
  When a system such as this is used to drive the panel, the 
display time for one field of each cell is fixed. In other 
words, one field can display no more than two gradients. For 
multiple gradient display, the field must be divided into 
several sub-fields, as shown in Figure 3. 



  To achieve 256 gradient display, it is necessary to divide 
each field into eight subfields. The display time for each 
subfield is proportionate to 1, 2, ... 128. Combining these 
eight subfields makes it possible to achieve gradient display of 
256 steps. 
  However, in order to scan 512 cathodes for one of one 
subfield, the period t of the scanning pulse must be 
within the following: 
  t = (1/60) x (1/512) x (1/8) = 4 x 
10[.sup]-6[/] (seconds) 
  In other words, discharge must start up within 1 
microsecond. 
To achieve this, discharge starters located in auxiliary cells 
between display cells are kept constantly illuminated. With the 
help of the auxiliary discharge, the discharge startup time can 
be kept at 1 microsecond or less, enabling display of 256 
gradients. 
<H5>  Lifespan of 10,000 Hours, Brightness of 150 cd/m </H5>
[.sup]2[/] 
  Table 2 shows the performance of the new 26-inch panel 
relative to former panels. In former panels, the largest 
problems were lifespan and efficiency of light emission. 
Lifespan is defined here as the point where a drop is reached of 
50% or more in brightness (relative to initial 
brightness) when 
the PDP is continuously and fully illuminated. During use, the 
phosphor and glass of the PDP becomes contaminated, resulting in 
a decrease in brightness. This happens because during display, 
ion collide in the gas enclosed at the cathode surface, and the 
cathode materials becomes dispersed (sputtered).

  The lifespan of former color PDPs was about 1,000 hours. 
This 
has been extended to 10,000 hours or more with the new panel, 
equaling that of the CRT. Efficiency of light emission, at 0.40 
lm/W, is almost triple the former value of 0.151 lm/W. Factors 
contributing to the improved lifespan and light emission 
efficiency include: (1) the discharge current for each pulse has 
been lowered by adding a current limiting resistor to each cell, 
(2) the pressure of enclosed gas has been raised, and (3) the 
phosphor, which was formerly applied only to the bottom of the 
cell, is applied to the sidewalls of the cell to increase the 
utility of ultraviolet rays. 
  By improving the light emission efficiency, brightness has 
been increased and power consumption has been lowered. 
Brightness has been improved from the former 100 
cd/m[.sup]2[/], which is generally regarded to be at the 
practical level. While the former-type panels consume about 140W 
(with the exception of the circuit driver area), the new 26-inch 
panel consumes 80W. As a result, the temperature rise which 
occurs during use has also been limited. When using the panel at 
room temperature, former panels would heat up to about 90C; 
this has been reduced to about 50C in the new panels. 
<H5>  Resistors Added to Each Cell </H5>
  The biggest reason why the new panel has an extended 
lifespan 
of 10,000 hours is because a current limiting resistor has been 
added to each display cell. Former-type plasma display panels 
which do not have this resistor use anomalous glow discharge for 
display discharge. With this method, an increase in the 
discharge current is accompanied by a slight increase in the 
discharge voltage, as shown in Figure 4 (a) and (b). In other 
words, the discharge current can be controlled by adjusting the 
applied voltage. However, when anomalous glow discharge is used, 
the electrode is easily damaged by sputtering, resulting in a 
shortened lifespan. 


  Sputtering can be reduced by increasing the pressure of gas 
within the cell. Increasing this gas pressure also raises the 
efficiency of light emission. However, once the gas pressure is 
increased, discharge changes from anomalous glow discharge to 
normal glow discharge. During normal glow discharge, the 
discharge voltage remains fixed or even decreases when the 
discharge current is increased, as shown in Figure 4 (c). In 
cases where the voltage drops in conjunction with an increase in 
current, uncontrolled discharge occurs if the current is not 
limited; and the cell is destroyed. To utilize normal glow 
discharge, some means of limiting the discharge current must be 
devised. 
  Using a peripheral circuit to limit the discharge current 
has 
also been considered, but this is not regarded to be practical. 
The number of display cells in each electrode line which will 
illuminate changes, depending on the image to be reproduced. 
Controlling the current according to the image would require an 
extremely complex control circuit. Another way of doing this is 
to add an independent resistor to each display cell. By so 
doing, the discharge current can be limited without requiring a 
peripheral circuit (see Figure 4 (d)). 
  It was known in the past that adding a resistor to each 
display cell would achieve a practical lifespan for the 
panel.[.sup]3)4)[/] However, since there were still numerous 
other problems, and there was no suitable resistor material, a 
large-size panel could not be constructed practically due to the 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-50A>   Figure 4.  Normal and anomalous Glow Discharge. </FIG>

increased number of processes involved. Recent advancements have 
been made in the production technology for display panels, and 
peripheral techniques for resistor formation have been 
established. These can now be adopted for 26-inch type panels. 
  Comparing the lifespan of the new panels against former 
panels which did not use resistors, the usable life in former 
models could not be improved by raising the gas pressure (see 
Figure 5). This is because the discharge current would increase 
in conjunction with an increase of the gas pressure. In 
addition, gas pressure could not be increased above a certain 
value due to the possibility of arc discharge. Since the new 
panels have resistors to control the discharge current, the 
discharge current can be managed without high pressure gas, 
resulting in longer life. In an experimental panel, HeZe gas 
mixture was enclosed at a pressure of 40 kPa, and discharge 
current was kept at about 60 A. The brightness half-life was 
extended to 10,000 hours or more. 



  There have also been some other fundamental experiments 
underway in an effort to lengthen the usable lifespan of the 
panel. The lifespan of an 8-inch panel, displayed by NHK at the 
1993 Technology Exhibition, is estimated to be 30,000 hours or 
more. Gas pressure has been increased to 47 kPa in this panel. 
Also, the proportion of Xe gas, which controls sputtering, is 
10%. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-51A>           Figure 5. Lifetime of Panels with Resistors Added. </FIG>

<H5>  Accuracy of Resistance Value Assured by Etching </H5>
  The key points in adding resistors involved determining what 
kind of design should be used to incorporate the resistor, and 
how to produce panels having complex designs. 
  The resistor was formed on the glass plate on the anode side 
(rear side), as shown in Figure 6. The bus line from the anode 
passes through the resistor and connects to the anode in the 
center of the cell. An insulating layer is used to protect the 
anode from resistance. Only the center part of the anode is 
exposed to the discharge space because of a thru-hole situated 
in the insulating layer. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-51B>           Figure 6. Internal Cell Structure of Resistor-Added Panels. </FIG>


  The new resistor-added panel can be produced by simply 
adding 
a resistor printing process, as shown in Figure 7. However, 
since the resistors are built into display cells which are about 
0.5mm square, a higher level of precision is required of the 
printing process. When producing 26-inch panels, it is necessary 
to achieve uniform formation of 450,000 resistors. To achieve 
this degree of uniformity, (1) the shape of the electrode which 
connects resistor to resistor must be precise, and (2) the 
resistor material must be compatible with the electrode and 
insulating film materials. In particular, conventional screen 
printing does not produce sufficient precision when forming the 
electrode -- therefore, a photoetch process was adopted. For the 
prototype panel, a goal of plus or minus 10% was set for 
uniformity of resistance values. Although the actual prototype 
contained some resistors which exceeded this standard, this did 
not significantly affect the display. Efforts are currently 
underway to discover the causes of the variance in resistor 
values.[.sup]5)[/] 



  RuO[.sup]2[/] paste having a sinter temperature of about 
600C was used as the resistor material. The resistive paste 
which is ordinarily used for hybrid ICs was not used because it 
has a higher sinter temperature of about 850C, which cannot 
be used with glass plates. 
  Each resistor has a value of about 1 M ohms. As a result, 
discharge current could be greatly reduced from the former value 
of 150 A to 60 A. Since photo-etching was used to 
produce 
the resistor-added panel, processing required a slightly more 
complex procedure. Also, since the resistor sinter temperature 
of 600C is higher than that used in other processes (where 
temperatures up to 580C are used), there is a higher 
occurrence of stress in the glass. Further study is needed to 
resolve these problems. 
<H5>  Phosphor Also Applied to Sidewalls of Cells </H5>
  The life of the display could be extended by adding 
resistors 
to the cells. The remaining problem involving the brightness was 
resolved by applying phosphor to the sidewalls of the display 
cells, to increase the utilization of ultraviolet rays which are 
generated during discharge (see Figure 8). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-52A>  Figure 7. Production Processes for Resistor-Added Panels. </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-52B>  Figure 8. Transparent Type PDP Panel and Reflective Type PDP Panel. </FIG>


  Color plasma discharge displays initially consisted of a 
design where the phosphor was applied on the front side glass, 
so that the emitted light could be seen through the phosphor. 
The drawback in this design was that emitted light was absorbed 
into the phosphor layer, resulting in reduced brightness. To 
resolve this problem, a reflective-type panel was developed. It 
consisted of applying phosphorous material on the rear glass, 
and emitted light was viewed through the front glass. Since 
there was no light absorbed by the phosphor, brightness was 
improved by 1.5 times. However, since the phosphor was at the 
bottom of the cell, the viewing angle was narrow. 
  In the new panel, phosphor has been applied to the sidewall 
in addition to the bottom of the cell. By doing so, the 
utilization of ultraviolet rays increases, and brightness also 
more than doubles. At the same time, the viewing angle remains 
the same as that of permeation-type displays. Ultraviolet rays 
which struck the sidewalls were formerly not utilized. When 
combining this with the drop in discharge current brought about 
by adding resistors, light emission efficiency has been improved 
almost three-fold, reaching 0.4 lm/W. As a result, a brightness 
of 150 cd/m[.sup]2[/] can be obtained, and the average power 
consumption can be reduced from the former 140 W to 80 W, with 
the exception of power consumed in the circuit drive sections. 
  There are two problems in forming phosphor material on the 
sidewalls. The first is that the panel becomes whitish because 
the color of the phosphor material is white. This can be 
resolved by placing red, green, and blue color filters on each 
pixel, as shown in Figure 9. By adding a filter which allows 
only the color of light emitted by each cell to penetrate, 
reflected light can ideally be reduced to 1/3 without any drop 
in brightness of the display light. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-53A>  Figure 9. Reflection of External Light Is Prevented by Color Filters </FIG>



  The second problem is the degree of complexity involved in 
processing. To form phosphor on the sidewalls, the display cell 
must first be covered with phosphor material, and then the 
phosphor must be removed except for the sidewall areas. To 
selectively remove the phosphor material, a sandblasting or 
photoetching process is required. 
<H5>  Mass Production Technique to Be Established </H5>
  The objectives of improving longevity, brightness, and 
efficiency were basically achieved about one year 
ago.[.sup]6)[/] Remaining technical problems include 
converting the circuit drive into an IC. Once this is achieved, 
the system can be made more compact, and power consumption can 
also be decreased. 
  In DC-type PDPs which have a pulse memory system, the 
discharge voltage is 250 V or higher. This has made it difficult 
to develop a monolithic IC. Recently, new drive systems which 
can be used with drive IC withstand voltage of 200 V or more 
have been proposed.[.sup]7)-9)[/] A bias voltage is applied 
to the entire drive circuit in order to reduce the voltage to 
the drive IC. At the 1993 NHK Technology Exhibition, a 40-inch 
panel using the new drive system was displayed, with picture 
quality that equaled the former type systems. 
  In the new drive system, the amplitude of the drive pulse 
and 
the duration of application are reduced. Therefore, the power 
loss which occurs in the drive circuit section can be reduced. 
In the 40-inch panel, power consumption in the drive section is 
400 W when the former drive system is used. With the new drive 
system, this has dropped to 100 W. When this is applied to a 
26-inch panel, the average power consumption of the entire panel 
can be reduced to 150 W or lower. 
  One more problem is the establishment of mass production 
processes for large panels. Thick film technology could be 
developed to achieve this. When producing large size panels, it 
is beneficial to use thick film rather than thin film methods in 
view of the cost of production equipment, and throughput. 
  There could also be areas where thin film formation 
techniques can be utilized. Mass production processes will 
eventually be determined by balancing yield and cost, while 
comparing low cost thick-film processes to higher cost, but more 
precise thin-film processes.

  There are two methods used in plasma displays -- the DC 
method and the AC method. 21-inch AC-type color panels are 
already being mass produced, and a practical level of light 
emission and usable life have been achieved. 
  There are slight differences in structure between the DC and 
AC systems (see Figure A). In the DC system, the opposing 
electrodes are exposed to the discharge space. When voltage is 
applied between the electrodes, electrons jump from the cathode 
and reach the anode while gas is being ionized. Discharge is 
maintained by a DC discharge current. In the AC method, the 
electrodes are covered with a dielectric layer. The process is 
the same as the DC method in as much as electrons pass from the 
minus electrode side when voltage is applied, and gas becomes 
ionized. However, since the electrodes are covered with 
dielectric material and a capacitor is formed, the current stops 
completely when a fixed charge moves. As implied by the name, in 
the AC method, discharge is maintained by applying an AC current. 



  In the AC system, the charge stored in the capacitor helps 
to 
initiate the discharge. Therefore, a supplemental discharge cell 
is not required to serve as the discharge starter. This makes it 
possible to achieve a smaller cell size. However, the 
disadvantage is that there is a large amount of reactive current 
because AC drives a large capacity panel. 
  The conventional AC system has been regarded to have a 
better 
lifespan. In the AC system, a MgO film that resists sputtering 
is formed on the dielectric layer which covers the electrodes. 
However, in the DC system, since the electrodes are directly 
exposed to the discharge, it is necessary to use an electrode 
material which is resistant to sputtering, such as aluminum. The 
AC method also has the advantage that current is automatically 
limited by the capacitance of the display cell. By keeping the 
discharge current below a certain value, the sputtering can be 
reduced. In the case of the DC method, current must be limited 
by using a resistor or constant-current circuit. 
  For larger size panels which adopt the AC system, a vacuum 
deposition process is required to form the MgO film, thus 
equipment investment and yield are not favorable. In the DC 
method, thick film printing can be used to create the film, so 
it is more suitable for larger screen sizes. On the other hand, 
the construction of the display cell is simple in the AC method, 
so precision can be more easily achieved than in the DC method.

  [Text] Honda Motor Co. (Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president) and 
Ovonic Battery Co. (OBC, headquartered in Michigan), a U.S. 
venture company that produces electronic and electrical parts, 
have agreed on the joint development of a next-generation 
battery for electric vehicles and concluded a development 
contract. This is the first time automobile-related Japanese 
and U.S. corporations have joined hands to develop a 
next-generation battery for electric vehicles. Based on this 
contract, Honda will begin development of a practical battery 
based on the nickel-hydrogen battery on which OBC has been 
conducting research and development has over twice the storage 
capacity and durability of conventional batteries, development 
of a low-cost battery is envisioned at the time of its placement 
on board electric vehicles. 
  In addition, because the battery does not include any lead 
or 
cadmium components, it is said to have the merit of being able 
to avoid secondary environmental pollution. The contract 
specifies that OBC will devise the design specs--based on the 
next-generation battery that the company has developed--for 
mounting in the electric vehicles that Honda is currently 
developing, then develop a prototype. Honda will mount the 
battery in its electric vehicles currently under use. Regarding 
the contract, Honda, in addition to procuring a prototype 
battery from OBC for research, test production, and testing, 
will pursue technology exchange. Honda is paying OBC 
approximately &yen;150 million for the next-generation battery 
technology. With California--due to the problem of 
environmental protection--introducing regulations by 1998 
mandating that two percent of all vehicles sold there emit no 
exhaust gases, the development of electric vehicles is becoming 
hurried. But the development of high-performance batteries has 
become the major prerequisite for that. Amidst such 
developments, Honda is strengthening its development 
capabilities in environmental-protection vehicles by joining 
hands with a U.S. venture company with strength in a future 
field of technology. OBC, a venture company that excels in new 
materials development and chemical synthesis R&amp;D, is a 
member of 
the Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) group of companies. With 
former General Motors chairman and chief executive officer 
Stempel recently becoming chairman of ECD, the parent company, 
the group is said to be strengthening its capabilities related 
to automobiles.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The STS-55 space shuttle (D-2 mission) returned safely to 
Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB) in the United States at 1630, 6 
May 1993, after completing its 10-day mission in space. The 
shuttle had originally been scheduled to land at the Kennedy 
Space Center (KSC), but bad weather over the center forced the 
change in the landing place. 
  The moment the shuttle touched down, approximately 300 
mission controllers and other people, who had been watching the 
large image screen within a studio at the German Space Operation 
Center (GSOC) stood up and applauded, celebrating the safe 
return. Among those people at the studio watching the landing 
were Professor H. Stoewer, managing director of the German Space 
Agency (DARA), Dr. W. Kroell, chairman of the German Aerospace 
Research Institute (DLR), D-2 mission manager Dr. H. Dodeck, and 
the author. 
  Following the 1985 D-1 mission, the D-2 mission was 
originally scheduled to be carried out in 1988. However, it was 
delayed five years due to the accident involving the U.S. space 
shuttle Challenger. Considering the difficulties they must have 
had to overcome during those years of delay, this author could 
read the mixed feelings of relief and hardship on the faces of 
the people in the mission control room. 
  Our company, Space Technology Corporation (STC), was the 
Japanese participant in the D-2 mission. In the following, the 
author will introduce the reason for STC's participation in the 
D-2 project and the experiences we had by participating in it. 
<H5>  Outline of D-2 Project </H5>
  Management of D-2 Project 
  The D-2 project was led by DLR under the supervision of 
DARA. 
The launch of the space lab was delayed several times before the 
launch was carried out in 1993. Germany set up DARA in the 
summer of 1989 to promote space development efficiently by 
empowering it to coordinate all space-related activities within 
the country. In line with this, the responsibility to implement 
the D-2 project was transferred from the German Research and 
Technology Ministry (BMFT) to DARA in August 1990. 
  However, considering the fact that DLA was already 
responsible for promoting the D-2 project, the institute was 
allowed to continue managing the D-2 mission as an exceptional 
measure. 
  In October 1990, the names of four German astronauts, i.e., 
R. Bruemmer, H. Schlegel, G. Thiele, and U. Walter, all of DLR, 
were announced. In September 1990, the Manned Space Control 
Center (MSCC) was set up within GSOC located in Oberpfaffenhofen 
in the outskirts of Munich. The work for launching space lab D-2 
according to the time schedule (Table 1 [not reproduced]) in 
September 1992 proceeded. However, the manifest for the 
launching of the space shuttle was revised several times. The 
shuttle launch from KSC finally took place at 1050, 26 April 
1993, seven months after the original launch schedule. 
  Background of D-2 Project 
  The manned space flight project in Germany started with its 
participation in the space lab development program in the early 
1970s. Based on the success of the manned space lab D-1 mission 
in 1985, the D-2 program was planned. (The D-1 mission sent two 
German astronauts into space.) 
  The D-2 project was led by Germany, with the United States, 
Japan, and other European countries participating, to conduct a 
series of experiments under the microgravity environment of 
space. The project was regarded as the first important step in 
preparation for using Europe's Columbus space center. 
  Scientifically, the D-2 mission aimed at conducting material 
and life science experiments and conducting earth and 
astronomical observations. Technologically, the mission was 
designed to test the operation of the experiment equipment 
systems, to promote the automation of ground control operation, 
to evaluate space robotics technology, and to carry out the 
measurement of microgravity in space using the most advanced 
measurement technology. The scientific experiments involved the 
evaluation of the technologies used in the mission experiments 
and the operability of the experiment instruments to prove their 
functioning and performance in space. 
  The payload of the D-2 mission was composed of 15 payload 
elements involving 28 experimental instruments. Approximately 90 
experiments, taking a total of 210 hours, were conducted in 
space using these instruments. 
  One aim of the D-2 project was to promote international 
cooperation in space endeavors. ESA took charge of the 
development of an anthrorack and a fluid physics experiment 
system. Six ESA experiments were conducted using these 
German-developed systems. ESA shouldered a reasonable percentage 
of the mission costs. 
  CNES of France offered a temperature-gradient furnace for 
use 
in the experiment. NASA cut the launch costs for the European 
partners in exchange for its use of 30 percent of the anthrorack 
and for allowing them to conduct one experiment in the biolab. 
  Originally, 30 percent of the German space experiment 
resources was made available to German industry. However, the 
industry's interest in conducting experiments in space was low, 
and only one company, a beer company, participated in the D-2 
project. As for Japan, STC participated by shouldering a 
reasonable amount of the mission costs. 
<H5>  Background of STC's Participation in D-2 Mission </H5>
  Since former U.S. President Ronald Reagan announced a 
program 
to construct a space station in 1983 and called on Japan, 
Canada, and European countries to participate in the program, 
Japanese interest in the program has been mounting. Since the 
announcement of the program, a group of private companies, led 
by major trading companies, has been set up to study space 
station utilization. In addition, the Japan Space Utilization 
Promotion Center (JSUP) has been established. 
  In 1985, an agreement was reached between the Research and 
Technology Ministry (BMFT) of the former West Germany and the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) regarding 
Japan's participation in the D-2 mission. Both parties agreed 
that it was beneficial to both countries to strengthen their 
mutual cooperation in space fields to expand the industrial 
utilization of space. 
  This agreement was followed by the establishment of STC in 
April 1986, with MITI's backing, as a domestic organization to 
promote Japan's participation in German space experiment 
programs (the D-2 and D-3 projects). STC was set up with 70 
percent of the capital supplied by MITI and the 30-percent 
balance, 5 percent each, shouldered by six private companies, 
i.e., Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Toshiba, NEC, 
Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Mitsubishi Electric. STC was originally 
established to engage in the research and development of 
compound semiconductor materials under microgravity conditions. 
To date, approximately 30 STC researchers have been engaged in 
R&amp;D at its labs set up within the research centers of these 
companies. 
  STC was originally scheduled to participate in both the D-2 
space lab mission, scheduled to be carried out in 1988, and the 
D-3 mission, scheduled to be implemented in 1991. However, the 
Challenger accident forced the United States to drastically 
change the space shuttle program, and this prompted the 
Department of Defense (DOD) to include the expendable launch 
vehicle (ELV) as a payload. The schedule for the resumption of 
the space shuttle launch program, announced in late 1986, set 
the launch of the D-2 mission space lab for 1991, three years 
after the original launch schedule. This delay forced STC to 
thoroughly review its space research plan. As a result, our 
corporation decided to continue research under a microgravity 
environment by using small rockets and the free-fall tower, both 
of which were available for obtaining microgravity conditions. 
  On the German side, on the other hand, BMFT designated 
Intospace as the establishment in charge of accepting 
applications from private German companies, as well as from 
foreign companies, for participating in the D-series missions. 
STC signed a new contract with Intospace for the Japanese 
corporation's participation in the D-2 mission (Figure 1 [not 
reproduced]). The negotiations for STC's participation took time 
because the German side had failed to determine the fees that 
private companies participating in the D-2 project were required 
to pay. The German side had no time to determine the fees 
because it was preoccupied with the preparations for 
establishing DARA. An agreement between the two countries was 
ultimately reached. The agreement required the private 
participants to pay mission costs by taking into account the 
weight, energy consumed, and the length of use of the 
experimental resources by the researchers of the participating 
establishments. 
  In addition to these mission costs, the costs for creating 
the cartridges and for conducting the preparatory experiments on 
the ground in Germany came to an unexpectedly high level. 
<H5>  Access to D-2 Mission </H5>
  When STC was set up, each of the labs located within the 
research centers of the investing companies drew up proposals on 
the kind of experiments that should be conducted when STC 
participated in the D-2 mission. The following are the proposals 
put forth by these labs. 


    -  Lab No. 1 (Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries): 
Growth of a PbSnTe crystal using the Bridgeman technique 
  -  Lab 
No. 2 (Toshiba): Growth of compound semiconductor crystals 
involving the use of several material systems 
  -  Lab No. 3 (NEC): 
Research on the fluid state of materials for growing crystals 
  -  Lab No. 4 (Hitachi): GaAs/Ge heterojunction 
  -  Lab No. 5 
(Fujitsu): Growth of a GaAs/Ge crystal from the melted fluid 
state 
  -  Lab No. 6 (Mitsubishi Electric): Epitaxial growth of 
InP 

    These proposals came when information on the experimental 
systems to be used in the D-2 mission was still scarce. 
Therefore, this caused these proposals to be reviewed later by 
taking into account the results of the preparatory experiments 
conducted on the ground and the characteristics of the 
experimental systems to be used aboard the space lab. The review 
was made in a series of systematized meetings at which STC 
researchers, engineers in charge of the experimental systems 
from Germany and France, D-2 mission officials from Germany, and 
the German contractors participated. They exchanged candid 
opinions on technological matters. It was not easy to reach an 
agreement because of conflicts in the policies and the method of 
dividing the mission costs among the participants. 
  The quadripartite meeting was held a total of six times, 
i.e., in Hanover (Intospace), Koln (DLR), Bremen (ERNO), 
Friedrichshafen (Dornier), Toulouse (CNES), and Tokyo (STC). 
These meetings were very useful in promoting mutual 
understanding, as well as the project, by grasping the actual 
situation surrounding the preparations being made for launching 
the space lab (Photo 2 [not reproduced]). 
  When STC was established, the investing companies intended 
to 
conduct one experiment each, for a total of six separate 
experiments in the D-2 mission. However, they failed to 
coordinate these experiments because of lack of information 
about how long they could use what kind of experimental hardware 
and how much their experiments would cost. 
  Therefore, efforts were made to coordinate and reach an 
agreement with respect to the mission costs at the quadripartite 
meetings. 
  For the D-2 mission, four types of furnaces were 
available--a 
temperature-gradient furnace (CNES), a uniform temperature 
furnace (ERNO), a fast-cooling furnace (Dornier), and a mirror 
furnace (ERNO). STC held discussions with engineers from these 
furnace manufacturers to ascertain if the furnaces could be used 
to conduct the experiments put forth by these six Japanese labs. 
First, Lab No. 3 submitted the specifications for the system for 
conducting an experiment involving the measurement of the 
thermal conductivity of molten semiconductor materials under 
microgravity conditions. The D-2 project was designed to allow 
manned space experiments employing mostly general-purpose 
experiment systems to be conducted. Because of this, it was 
almost impossible technologically to modify the systems to meet 
the specifications required by Lab No. 3. Therefore, the 
quadripartite meeting concluded that the lab's experiment should 
be conducted by launching small rockets mounted with experiment 
systems specifically designed for the lab's experiment. 
Following this conclusion, Lab No. 3 decided not to participate 
in the D-2 project. 
  The superiority of CNES's temperature-gradient furnace made 
many participating establishments want to use the furnace for 
conducting their experiments. This furnace made it possible to 
use larger specimens than did the other available furnaces, and 
it also made it possible to provide heat treatment to three 
specimens simultaneously under the same conditions. Considering 
the necessity for all these furnaces to be used uniformly, the 
popularity of the French-made furnace posed a problem. Other 
labs restudied their experiment themes so that the experiments 
could be conducted in the D-2 mission. Lab No. 2 decided to 
conduct an experiment involving the diffusion of impurities 
within the melted fluid of a material using the uniform heating 
furnace. On the other hand, Lab No. 5 decided to carry out the 
growth of a crystal from the melted fluid of a material using 
the uniform heating furnace in a slow cooling mode. 
  Lab No. 6 submitted a request to use the 
temperature-gradient 
furnace to conduct its experiment to realize the crystal 
gas-phase growth of a material. However, the mission manager 
recommended that the lab use the mirror furnace, and the 
engineers from the mirror furnace company ascertained that the 
furnace had the specifications that would satisfy the 
requirements put forth by the lab. However, the lab insisted on 
using the temperature-gradient furnace, and the Japanese request 
was ultimately met. 
  As the experiment by Lab No. 1 progressed on the ground, it 
became clear that the growth of a good PbSnTe crystal could not 
be obtained unless it was carried out by controlling the 
temperature gradient very accurately over several dozen hours. 
Thus, the lab determined that the CNES's temperature-gradient 
furnace was not suitable, and withdrew from the D-2 mission. 
Instead, the lab decided to conduct its experiment by launching 
small rockets (TEXUS). 
  Originally, Lab No. 4 intended to conduct material 
experiments by launching many small rockets on its own without 
relying on the D-2 project in view of the cost advantage and for 
other research-related reasons. However, taking into 
consideration the agreement between Japan and Germany regarding 
the former's participation in the D-2 mission, the lab finally 
decided to conduct its experiment using the steep-cooling 
furnace designed to be used in the D-2 mission. 
  Finally, STC decided to conduct the four labs' experiments 
involving nine separate specimens in the D-2 mission. However, 
the extension of space shuttle's flight by one day made the 
Japanese corporation conduct more experiments involving the 
unexpectedly larger number of 13 specimens thanks to Germany's 
largesse. 
  Of the research conducted by STC, research results have been 
detailed in the July 1987, July 1988, August 1989, and August 
1990 issues of KIKAI SHINKO. Therefore, the author will refrain 
from elaborating further on STC's research in this report. 
<H5>  Lesson Learned from Participating in International Project </H5>
  The D-2 project was planned and carried out based on the 
experiences and results of the D-1 project. However, the D-2 
project was the first D-series project in which private 
companies, including STC from Japan, were to participate. This 
caused much time to be consumed during the preparatory stages in 
order to determine the mission costs that these companies would 
be required to shoulder. The original estimate of the costs 
which STC would be required to pay was far higher than STC was 
prepared to pay. This made STC, an organization which was set up 
with a limited budget for financing its operation, take much 
time and effort in narrowing the gap. However, thanks to the 
cooperation from the Japan Key Technology Center, a compromise 
was struck between the STC's budget for the D-2 project, which 
was totally dependent on the government's ceiling-limited yearly 
budgetary allocation, and the D-2 mission costs that had 
increased substantially from the original estimate due to the 
delay in the launch schedule. 
  By experiencing these difficulties, we have learned the 
importance of nurturing a good relationship based on mutual 
trust among the project partners for the success of the joint 
project. We have also learned the importance of having a direct 
exchange of opinions among the scientists and engineers involved 
in the project with respect to the data obtained through the 
ground experiments by having the experiment systems used at 
hand. We traveled to Germany a number of times, the expenses for 
which were covered by our limited research budget. However, the 
author thinks that the travel expenses were worth spending in 
that they promoted communications with the German side. 
  Through these experiences we have had in our efforts to 
carry 
out the D-2 project, we have learned (1) that the 
characteristics of experiment systems change greatly depending 
on the conditions of the specimens used, (2) that the effects of 
these changes can be reduced by the use of optional systems or 
through software modification, and (3) that it is important to 
ascertain a system's limitations at the earliest-possible stage 
of the experiment. We have also found that the researchers who 
are equipped with insufficient data for preparatory experiments 
tend to make the requirements too stringent. The availability of 
a coordinator well versed in both the experiment systems and the 
experiments conducted using these systems ensures that a project 
will progress smoothly. 
  In the course of our efforts to promote the D-2 project, we 
have experienced many instances of awkwardness resulting from 
the cultural differences between the two countries. One example 
of this is that we have seen the mission officials from German 
governmental establishments and the officials from the private 
sector having vigorous and candid discussions on matters 
concerning the D-2 project. In Japan, such heated exchanges of 
opinion do not occur between the government and the private 
sector. Another example was that in German documents, that were 
thought to have been prepared with the utmost care, we found 
proofreading errors in passages referring to thermocouples. In 
addition, there were many problems which German researchers did 
not notice and which had to be pointed out by us. These problems 
included the loss of reproducibility of data when specimens were 
changed. 
  There were many occasions in which we were misunderstood by 
the people we contacted in the United States and Europe. These 
misunderstandings were traced mainly to the Japanese penchant 
for valuing the proverb "Action speaks louder than words." By 
carrying out the D-2 project together, we have been able to 
further our mutual understanding with German engineers and 
scientists. At the same time, we have recognized that carrying 
out an international project is not as easy as it is generally 
said to be. 
<H5>  Epilogue </H5>
  The specimens we used in the D-2 mission are scheduled to be 
returned to the research organizations to which they belong 
within about six weeks of the completion of the mission. These 
returned specimens will be analyzed and evaluated, with the 
results to be reported later. STC is grateful that an 
unexpectedly large number of valuable experiments have been 
successfully conducted through participation in the D-2 project, 
i.e., the first large-scale technological cooperation program 
carried out between Japan and Germany. Representing STC, the 
author would like to express the company's gratitude to the 
government departments concerned and to those investing 
companies for their support and cooperation extended to its 
research. 
  In order to promote research on the utilization of the space 
environment, it is important to improve the infrastructure of 
the domestic space industry and to introduce a system which will 
make the users support space research more actively. To realize 
this, the author suggests that research centers, like the Center 
for Commercial Development of Space (CCDS) in the United States, 
in which researchers from government establishments, 
universities, and private industries can conduct R&amp;D 
jointly, be 
established. 
  STC's participation in the D-2 project made us more 
confident 
of promoting further Japanese-German technological cooperation 
in the future. The project also contributed to promoting the 
mutual exchange of scientists and engineers between the two 
countries. The author concludes this article by hoping that our 
experiences in the D-2 program will serve as a guide in our 
continued efforts toward developing space.

  [Text] On 12 September 1992, space shuttle Endeavor (Figure 
1 [not reproduced]) was launched on schedule at 10:23 Eastern 
Time from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. One hour after 
the launch, Endeavor was put into orbit at an altitude of 300 km 
above the ground, and experiments aboard the space ship began 
immediately. Shortly after the experiments were started, a water 
leak was found near the power system for the No. 10 rack. A 
water leak aboard a spaceship in space can lead to a major 
disaster if the floating water droplets find their way into the 
electrical system. The supply of cooling water to the rack was 
suspended immediately, and the experiment on the rack was 
suspended until the leakage could be repaired. A number of 
material experiments were scheduled to be conducted in the No. 
10 rack using a sound-pressure-floating furnace, an image 
furnace, and a zone furnace. These experiments had been selected 
from among the many proposals submitted regarding experimental 
themes to be conducted in space. The proposals had been 
submitted by the public in 1979. During the next 13 years, a 
series of experiments had been conducted on the ground and 
aboard planes in flight in preparation for the space 
experiments. Beginning in April 1992, we conducted three mock 
experiments (POCC) at the Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, 
Alabama, to prepare for the upcoming space experiments. Since 
these efforts had extended over many years, the news of the 
water leak accident shocked us greatly. At the same time, we 
were impressed by NASA's way of handling the accident. 
Immediately after the water leak was found, a meeting of 
specialists was called aboard the space shuttle to determine 
whether the leak could be repaired safely. About 24 hours passed 
before they made a decision on the measures to be taken. After 
ascertaining safety, they cut open a layer of a material 
wrapping the valve where the leak was thought to be occurring. 
The image of the repair work was transmitted to the ground 
stations. The repair was made safely with the help of ground 
engineers. To compensate for the delay in starting the 
experiments caused by this accident, the space shuttle's stay in 
space was extended by one day. Thanks to this, we were able to 
carry out all the scheduled experiments (Tables 1 and 2).

  The space experiment environment allows us to take advantage 
of (1) lasting microgravity conditions, (2) abundant solar 
energy, (3) limitless space, (4) an immense visual field, and 
(5) high vacuum conditions. 
  In recent years, the development of materials began to be 
made on a commercial basis by exploiting the above advantages of 
the space experiment environment (Table 3 [not reproduced]). The 
lasting microgravity conditions in space make it possible to 
melt glass materials without requiring a material container to 
hold them in place. This, in turn, makes it possible to create a 
highly pure glass, free of impurities traced to the container. 
The microgravity environment also makes it possible to create a 
glass without a crystallized structure. If a container does not 
have to be used, it is possible to create a high-melting point 
glass that is not affected by the thermal limitations of the 
container used. In addition, the weightless condition makes it 
possible to create new hetero-glasses that cannot be created on 
the ground and are completely different from conventional 
glasses. The formation of conventional glasses involve a 
crystallization process in which the melted materials are 
maintained at a quasi-stable state. In developing new materials, 
it is important to fully understand the phenomena that are 
expected to affect the results of material development in space. 
The experiments which we conducted aboard the space shuttle 
offered us sufficient time to unravel many of these phenomena, 
something that had been impossible in the experiments conducted 
using a free-fall tower, aircraft, or by launching small 
rockets. Through these space experiments, we obtained valuable 
data for creating new materials. 
  The experiment conducted for the "research to develop the 
optical materials for use in invisible light range 
applications," that had been proposed by the Government 
Industrial Research Institute, Osaka (Item M-17 in Table 1), was 
one of those most important experiments conducted aboard the 
space shuttle. The purpose of the experiment was to establish 
the technology for melting materials using no material container 
and to process the melted materials to create new types of 
glasses, such as high-purity glass and high melting-point glass. 
The experiment was conducted by having the materials floated and 
held in place by means of sound pressure. The materials were 
melted by light, and then solidified by cooling, producing the 
high-purity and high melting-point glasses. One of the purposes 
of developing these glasses was to create a glass with a higher 
infrared transmissivity than that of the quartz glass used in 
conventional optical fiber communications for use in the 
next-generation optical communications networks. The space 
experiments made it possible to verify the usefulness of the 
ground-developed technology for floating glass materials by 
means of sound pressure. The experiments also involved testing 
the float control techniques and studying the technology's 
application fields. Through these experiments, the performance 
of the sound pressure furnace (Figure 2 [not reproduced]) used 
in the space experiments was also ascertained. Table 4 gives the 
compositions of the materials used in the space experiments and 
the conditions under which these materials were melted. One melt 
experiment was conducted using a low melting-point specimen, 
while two experiments were conducted using high melting-point 
specimens. These experiments produced a glass with a high purity 
that could not be obtained on the ground (Figure 3 [not 
reproduced]). However, since the melted glass adhered to the 
cage within which the materials were melted, it was impossible 
for us to recover the glass as the complete sphere of a 
high-purity glass. The experiments we conducted in space and the 
results of the experiments are outlined below.

  By conducting experiments aboard the space shuttle, it was 
found that floating a specimen at a fixed position for a long 
time was more difficult than we had originally expected. (Figure 
4 [not reproduced] shows a floating specimen being heated.) The 
results of the experiment are as follows: 
  Float control: (1) It was ascertained that the 
existing software could be used to control the position of the 
floating specimen. The fact that we could confine the specimen 
to within a fixed area by adjusting the frequency of the sound 
waves to accommodate changes in experimental conditions 
indicates that the software functioned as designed. However, it 
was found out that the program was slow in responding to these 
changes. This required further improvements of the software 
speed. (2) The use of the cage (Figure 5 [not reproduced]) 
proved very useful in easing the unexpected "G-jitters." In 
addition, the cage was necessary not only for serving as an 
auxiliary heater for melting a specimen, but also for increasing 
the safety in handling the high-temperature molten fluid under 
weightless conditions. To further enhance the cage functioning, 
we used platinum cages coated with a carbon film. Carbon has 
poor wettability against platinum, preventing the platinum 
element from finding its way into the molten specimen easily. In 
addition, the carbon film is useful in preventing the molten 
fluid from sticking to the cage. 
  Spot observation of specimen: The purposes for 
conducting the space experiments included the on-the-spot 
observation of the specimen floating within the cage and the 
observation of the melting process via a fiber scope inserted 
into the furnace. However, this time we failed to obtain a clear 
view of the melting process due to the low resolution in the 
images obtained through the fiber scope. The poor resolution was 
attributable to the inability to secure the specimen in a 
designated position. When a larger rack space becomes available 
in the future, it will become possible to obtain clearer images 
by introducing a reflective optical observation system. 
  Observation of melted specimen: In order to 
observe the behavior of the specimen used in the first 
experiment, a cobalt marker was applied to the surface of the 
specimen that was melted by being floated by means of sound 
pressure. When the melted specimen was cooled and solidified, it 
was found that the marker had expanded in length, changing from 
the original shape of a tiny speck to a bar (Figure 6 [not 
reproduced). This change in shape indicates that a glass flow 
occurred during the melting and solidification process. The 
specimen with the expanded marker was used to calculate the 
velocity of the flow, the density change, and the diffusion 
coefficient from the melt temperature and time. In the second 
experiment, in contrast to the yellowish glass that had been 
obtained in ground experiments involving the use of a material 
container, a highly transparent glass was created in the space 
experiment. The glass contained tiny air bubbles that were 
formed on the surface of the glass during the solidification 
process. These bubbles posed a new problem that must be resolved 
if new glasses are to be created under microgravity conditions. 
In the third experiment, it was found that platinum found its 
way into the melted/solidified glass and crystallized at the 
interface between the platinum cage and the chunk of glass 
adhering to the inside of the cage. The invasion of the platinum 
into the glass formed the nuclei of nonuniform material elements 
inside the glass, leading to the growth of a crystal within the 
solidified glass. 
  Measurement of transmissivity in ultraviolet, infrared 
and visible light ranges: The measurement of transmissivity 
was conducted using the specimen obtained from the second 
experiment since the measurement required the use of a highly 
transparent glass specimen. Because the shape of the specimen 
was not a parallelogram, an integrating sphere was used for 
measuring in the ultraviolet and visible light ranges, while a 
condenser beam was used in the infrared range. The 
transmissivity thus measured exhibited lower values in all these 
ranges than did that measured on the ground. However, compared 
with the specimens melted and solidified on the ground, the 
second specimen displayed better transparency. Figure 6 [not 
reproduced] shows the results of measuring the transmissivity in 
the ultraviolet and visible light ranges. It is thought that the 
numerous air bubbles that were formed within the second specimen 
affected not only light's absorption in the specimen, but also 
its transmissivity. Figure 7 [not reproduced] is a photograph of 
the bubbles existing within the melted glass fluid. 
  By conducting these recent space experiments, we have 
obtained much valuable data that will prove useful in improving 
the purity of glass by melting the materials in the microgravity 
environment of space, in creating diversified types of glasses, 
in controlling crystallization by steep cooling of the melted 
materials, in studying the flow of melted glass fluid under 
microgravity conditions, in creating better homogenized glasses, 
in unraveling the reasons for the formation of air bubbles, and 
in reducing the content of impurities. The author hopes that 
this data will be used to help the R&amp;D efforts in realizing 
the 
construction of the projected space station. At the same time, 
the author hopes that this data will also promote the 
development of these technologies for use on the ground.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Scientists began to consider taking advantage of the 
weightless environment of space, characterized by having no 
convection, no buoyancy, no sedimentation, no static pressure, 
and no-contact floating, during their research in the 1960s. 
Experiments in space began to be realized in the 1970s when 
Skylab, the Apollo rocket and Soyuz spaceship were launched. 
However, good results were not obtained easily. These features 
of the weightless environment in space can be best exploited 
when the specimen involved in the experiment is fluid in form. 
The reason for good results not being obtained during those 
early years is thought to be that researchers did not have 
sufficient knowledge of fluid phenomena. The material processing 
technology we are using today is based on the technologies that 
have been accumulated through continued research conducted since 
the days scientists attempted to create gold and silver from 
ordinary metals hundreds of years ago. Compared to this long 
history of efforts, our experience in space is still too meager. 
In the First Material Processing Test Program (FMPT) experiments 
conducted recently that involved creating new materials aboard a 
U.S. space shuttle, the total hours accumulated by Japanese 
researchers in space was about 150. Even if the hours of 
experiments conducted by Japanese researchers under weightless 
conditions are added, the total is still short of 1,000 hours, 
making the space material processing technology no match for its 
ground counterpart in terms of maturity. In this sense, we must 
promote basic physiochemical research. 
  Due partly to the Challenger disaster, material research in 
the microgravity environment of space made little progress in 
the 1980s. However, since entering the 1990s, the platforms 
enabling material experiments to be conducted under microgravity 
conditions have been diversifying. Figure 1 [not reproduced] 
gives these platforms and their relative positions on a diagram 
in which the Y-axis represents attainable levels of microgravity 
and the X-axis indicates the length of time a microgravity 
condition can be realized. The length of time required of 
microgravity conditions in order for an experiment to be 
finished ranges from the comparatively brief time required for 
conducting a fuel combustion test to the several months needed 
to grow protein crystals. The platform selected should be 
determined by taking this time factor into account. Due partly 
to the few chances for conducting experiments under microgravity 
conditions that have been available so far, researchers have 
tended to make proposals for new experiments randomly, without 
considering whether such experiments are really worth 
undertaking. Now, with a number of these platforms having become 
available, we must make proposals that can take advantage of 
these platforms. 
  We can expect that the era of the 1990s will produce many 
significant achievements in our efforts to develop space 
technology. For three years, starting in 1991, Japan has been 
conducting the TR-IA program by launching a series of small 
research rockets. In 1992 Japan carried out the MASTER and FMPT 
programs, followed by the D-2 project carried out aboard a U.S. 
space shuttle and the GAS project implemented in 1993. A series 
of experiments under weightless conditions is scheduled in the 
coming years, including the launch of an EXPRESS satellite with 
a recoverable capsule in 1994 and the SFU free flyer program in 
1995. In 1992, a free-fall tower, the tallest in the world, was 
constructed on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido. The 
facility is already available for conducting experiments under 
weightless conditions. The construction of a space station is 
currently under way, scheduled for completion in 1998. While the 
construction is being carried out by the United States, Japan 
and European countries are participating in the space station 
program. 
<H5>  Importance of Promoting Microscopic Observation </H5>
  In recent years, great progress has been made in the field 
of 
microelectronic technology, a technology needed to produce 
semiconductor devices. The linewidth required to create these 
devices has shrunk steadily, from micron to submicron orders, 
and now researchers are developing a technology that will make 
it possible to control molecule-level dimensions. The need for 
this technology is mounting, not only for semiconductor device 
development, but also in the fields of new material development, 
chemistry and biotechnology. The need for the technology that 
will enable the observation and manipulation of molecule-level 
and atom-level dimensions has been increasing in recent years. 
One of the themes for which the Agency of Industrial Science and 
Technology is actively promoting R&amp;D is "atom technology." 
This 
effort involves the development of a technology that will make 
it possible to observe, measure, and manipulate individual 
molecules and atoms on the surface of various kinds of 
substances and materials under different conditions, i.e., the 
development of a technology that will make it possible to 
measure or observe, on the spot, the formation of atomic 
clusters, their concentration, dispersion, and reactions among 
them within a three-dimensional space, as well as research aimed 
at theoretically unraveling the processes involved in 
absorption, desorption, dispersion and reaction. 
  The agency is also promoting research on "quantized 
functional elements." This research aims at developing new 
functional elements by finely controlling such quantum phenomena 
as the tunnel effect manifested in ultra-microstructures, the 
wave motion of electrons, and the transition between different 
quantum levels. The research to develop the elements has been 
stepped up since progress has been made in shrinking the 
dimensions of the semiconductor device circuits. The production 
of these devices calls for these well-controlled elements to be 
available. When the circuit features shrink, the requirements 
for elements become increasingly stringent. The weightless space 
environment could provide the experiment conditions suitable for 
developing these quantized functional elements. 
  When the requirements for metallic materials become 
stringent, it becomes necessary to improve the characteristics 
of these metals by promoting research at the grain level, i.e., 
the constituent element. Each of these grains, in turn, is 
composed of microstructures that develop during the growth 
process of the dendritic structures. The condition of the 
dendritic growth within these microstructures greatly affects 
the parameters required for these metals, such as the parameter 
for mechanical strength. Research on dendritic growth has been 
conducted for the past 50 years. Despite this long history of 
research, it is only recently that the quantization of such 
growth has become possible. An article by J.S. Langer which was 
carried in the October issue of PHYSICS TODAY points out that 
dendritic growth is affected by the fluctuations of temperature 
in the boundary interface between the surface of the solidifying 
substance and the adjoining atmosphere, as well as by minute 
changes in the surface tension. The author went on by saying 
that while these parameters are important, they have been 
ignored so far. Figure 2 [not reproduced] is the schematic 
representation of the solidification of a metallic substance at 
one moment during the solidification process on the ground, and 
it can be seen that the crystal is growing upward. On the 
ground, air convection occurs above the surface of the 
solidifying substance. However, in the boundary interface, 
convection disappears because the convection is impeded by a 
drag caused by the viscosity of the air in the interface. It has 
recently been found that the molecules present in the 
solidifying interface play an important role. 
  In a weightless environment, convection like that observed 
on 
the ground does not occur, creating the conditions suitable for 
conducting the microscopic observation. On the ground, X-ray is 
the only means used to conduct the microscopic observation of 
metals. However, it is unrealistic to lift an X-ray system to 
space to conduct similar observations. Because of this, organic 
substances, such as (saxinonytril), are commonly used as the 
specimens for use in space experiments. Through the 1990s, space 
experiments aimed at unraveling the solidification process will 
be conducted using these organic specimens. 
  (Grieksman), of the United States, has found by conducting 
many experiments on the ground that the crystallization process 
is influenced by gravity. He is scheduled to conduct an 
experiment involving the growth of the dendritic crystal using a 
U.S. space experiment system (USMP). 
  In Japan, experiments to measure the temperature of the 
atmosphere in the solidifying interface were carried out under 
weightless conditions by launching small MASTER-5 rockets 
carrying a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The experiments were 
promoted and conducted by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, 
Mitsubishi Research Institute, Japan Society for the Promotion 
of Machine Systems, and The Society of Japanese Aerospace 
Companies. These experiments made it possible to see clearly the 
heat radiation from a solidifying substance into the atmosphere 
adjoining the substance and the changes in radiation level in 
the form of video images. Figure 3 [not reproduced] shows the 
printout of one of the frames of images obtained by a 
Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The image in the right half of the 
printout, rendered in the form of finite interference fringes, 
shows the change in the atmospheric temperature near the 
substance over time in terms of temperature profile curves. The 
image in the left half, rendered in the form of infinite 
interference fringes, can be used to measure the temperature. 
Recently, high expectations have been placed on the results of 
research that has been under way in an effort to use the 
light-scattering phenomenon as a means of observing the 
crystallization of a solidifying substance. The effect of 
surface tension becomes conspicuous in a weightless environment, 
and, in this sense, it is important to conduct further research 
on surface tension to clarify the crystallization process. In 
September 1993, an experiment for observing the dendritic growth 
process was to be conducted using the Schlieren optical 
observation system by launching a TR-IA3 rocket. The adoption of 
the observation system makes it possible to realize a visual 
rendition of the crystal growth process when a solidifying 
substance is subjected to supercooling conditions. 
<H5>  Advantages of Weightless Experiment Environment </H5>
  In the following, this author will describe the advantages 
of 
the weightless experiment environment by citing some concrete 
instances. As described above, the need for realizing atom-level 
control in developing semiconductor devices is mounting these 
days. However, on the ground, the convection in the atmosphere 
has impeded the realization of crystal growth with no defects. 
Convection causes temperature fluctuations in the solidifying 
interface of a growing crystal, which causes changes in density. 
These, coupled with supercooling and internal thermal stress, 
lead to the appearance of defects within the grown crystal. In 
addition, convection within a melted fluid causes nonuniformity 
in the material composition and the distribution of impurities 
in the direction of crystal growth. No convection, no buoyancy, 
and no static pressure--these are why the weightless environment 
of space draws such high attention. Under weightless conditions, 
uniform crystallization can be attained because convection does 
not occur. In addition, weightless conditions make it possible 
to produce a large temperature gradient in the interface of the 
crystallizing substance. This, in turn, makes it possible to 
limit the supercooled depth in the surface of a liquid-phase 
substance to very shallow, a condition required to realize the 
stable growth of a single crystal. 
  As new types of materials, the alloys which are made using 
iron, nickel, or cobalt as the base materials, and which display 
high strength and toughness at high temperatures, have been 
drawing attention in recent years. These alloys are created by 
scattering ceramics or metal oxides, or by coating them with a 
ceramic film. In order to produce these alloys in space, it is 
thought that processing methods which ensure the uniform 
dispersion of materials or the oriented solidification of 
materials must be used. The uniform dispersion method could be 
used to produce a material in space by dispersing fine material 
components uniformly across the matrix material, or to produce a 
composite material by having the reinforcing fibers embedded in 
a regular pattern by taking advantage of the absence of buoyancy 
and sedimentation in the space environment. The oriented 
solidification that makes it possible to realize a large 
temperature gradient within a melted fluid can be used to 
produce turbine blades. The experiments that will be conducted 
in space using these methods will include one to improve the 
heat withstanding ability of super alloys by dispersing 
ceramics, one on unidirectional solidification, and one to 
create single crystals. 
  Amorphous alloys can be created by introducing silicon, 
boron, phosphorus, zirconium, hafnium, or niobium into such 
transition metals as iron, nickel, or cobalt, and by subjecting 
the melted mixture of these metals to supercooling, taking 
advantage of the fact that it becomes a solid with the same kind 
of atomic sequence that it has in the liquid state (in other 
words, by super cooling one does not have to take the time to 
realign it in the correct sequence). This causes the amorphous 
alloys to manifest high toughness and high 
corrosion-withstanding ability, which the original metals did 
not. Cooling the melted fluid in space would make it possible to 
produce larger amorphous crystals by restraining the formation 
of the crystal nuclei from the portions where the ground 
production process makes the fluid come into contact with the 
vessel holding it. 
  As for use in optical fiber communications, efforts are 
under 
way to develop a glass with high transparency (low transmission 
loss) in the near infrared range. The development of such a 
glass calls for the introduction of an advanced processing and 
production technology that will make it possible to greatly 
reduce the impurity content. On the ground, glass production 
requires the use of a platinum vessel since glass reacts with 
refractory materials at high temperatures. It is thought that a 
highly pure glass for which no impurities can be traced to the 
vessel holding the materials can be created by melting and 
solidifying the materials while floating them in space. In the 
meantime, the Government Industrial Research Institute, Osaka, 
of MITI's Agency of Industrial Science and Technology is 
conducting joint research with the University of Missouri and 
Loyola University of the United States to create glass particles 
with diameters of a few microns in a weightless environment for 
medical applications. We anticipate good results will be 
forthcoming from the research. 
  The experiment conducted by USML in 1992 to grow protein 
crystals in space drew substantial attention from scientists 
around the world as a pioneering attempt to produce medicine in 
space. Protein crystal is brittle and a large crystal cannot be 
created on the ground due to the effects of air convection and 
sedimentation. A large crystal is not necessarily needed as the 
material for producing medicine. However, to determine the 
suitable three-dimensional crystal structure of a medicine under 
development, the availability of a large, high quality crystal 
is essential. It is said that many recently-developed drugs have 
been designed to be effective against specific viruses in order 
to reduce side effects. In order to develop these drugs, 
unraveling the three-dimensional structures of the protein 
crystals involved is important. Producing these crystals in 
space is costly. Therefore, for the time being, the use of the 
weightless environment of space will be confined to the 
development of drugs against cancer and AIDS, the two major 
diseases afflicting the world today, which must be controlled at 
all costs. In the meantime, MITI, in cooperation with DARA of 
Germany, plans to conduct an experiment to grow a zeolite 
crystal in 1994 by launching an EXPRESS satellite. The products 
of the experiment will be recovered in a capsule. Zeolite is 
said to be useful for use in petroleum refining and for reducing 
diesel engine exhaust. 
  Just like a protein crystal, a large zeolite crystal cannot 
be produced on the ground. Thus far, zeolite has been created by 
determining the crystal structure based on experience. The CATEX 
program is designed to conduct a series of experiments to grow a 
zeolite crystal in space. The first space flight, lasting five 
days, will make it possible to conduct experiments by taking 
full advantage of the weightless conditions in space. After the 
experiments have been completed, the satellite will be recovered 
to obtain the data that will make it possible in the ensuing 
CATEX experiments to conduct detailed observation of the crystal 
growth process by making full use of the on-the-spot observation 
technology available. 
  The experiments conducted by using a free-fall tower or 
within a space station are characterized by the fact that they 
can get the support of specialists every time an experiment is 
conducted. As far as the diagram in Figure 1 [not reproduced] is 
concerned, the free-fall tower and space station give the 
impression that they present experiment platforms with opposite 
capabilities and performance. The use of a free-fall tower makes 
it possible to conduct experiments under weightless conditions 
using the experiment systems as sophisticated as the ones used 
on the ground, even though the dimensions of the systems are 
limited by the size of the capsule used in the free-fall 
facility. A space station can employ a low-acceleration 
propulsion system, like a space shuttle. In addition, a space 
station makes it possible to accommodate equally sophisticated 
experiment systems and allows the adjustment or repair of these 
systems to be made by astronauts when the need arises. The 
National Space Development Agency is already developing the 
experiment systems for joint use in space station. In parallel 
with the development, the agency has been encouraging people to 
propose themes for experiments to be conducted in a space 
station since 1992. However, the author's opinion is that such 
sophisticated experiment systems must be created not by the 
agency, but by those establishments which will be conducting the 
experiments within the space station. The experiments conducted 
using these platforms, involving the use of sophisticated 
experiment systems operated by specialists, will greatly help to 
build a database on thermal property values. 
  For example, in order to simulate the growth of a 
semiconductor crystal properly, accurate thermal property values 
must be used to melt the materials. It is impossible to measure 
these values accurately on the ground because of convection. The 
Space Technology Corporation has conducted a series of 
experiments to measure the thermal conductivity of a number of 
materials under weightless conditions created by using a 
free-fall tower and by launching small TEXUS rockets. Based on 
the results of these experiments, the corporation reported that 
there is a difference in the thermal conductivity of InSb 
between the value measured on the ground and the one measured 
under weightless conditions. According to the corporation's 
data, the value is the same within solid specimens, but 
differences appear when liquid specimens are used (Figure 4 [not 
reproduced]). This data will contribute to building the 
database. Germany has been conducting experiments to measure the 
surface tension, thermal conductivity, viscosity coefficient, 
and other property values of a number of materials using a 
TEMPUS magnetic floating furnace. For the time being, it is 
important for us to accumulate data on as many materials as 
possible by changing the parameters using such a furnace. These 
efforts are what must be undertaken and promoted by researchers 
using the two different types of experiment platforms described 
above. 
<H5>  Expectations for Super-High Vacuum Environment </H5>
  A lasting vacuum condition is another characteristic of the 
space environment. However, at the altitudes space shuttles fly 
in space, the vacuum level is not as high. The vacuum at these 
altitudes deteriorates to around 10[.sup]-4[/] Pa due to the 
gases coming out of the shuttles in various forms and the water 
discarded from the shuttles. At this point comes the idea of 
using the wake. The term "wake" refers to the trace created on 
the surface of water behind a ship when it travels. The vacuum 
level at an altitude of 300 km from the earth's surface is 
dictated by the partial pressure of the atomic oxygen, an 
element which accounts for the largest percentage of those 
elements present at the altitude. The partial pressure usually 
ranges from 10[.sup]-5[/] to 10[.sup]-6[/] Pa. By assuming 
that the gases of these residual elements have a Maxwell's 
distribution pattern, the molecular temperatures of these 
elements approach 1,000 K. At these temperatures, the movement 
velocity of these elements' thermal molecules is about one-tenth 
the orbiting speed of a satellite, and this prevents the 
molecules from scattering behind the satellite. This produces a 
wake of a high vacuum level behind a flying satellite. 
Specifically, the travel speed of a satellite is a few times 
faster than the movement speeds of the thermal molecules of 
hydrogen and helium, and about 10 times faster than the movement 
speeds of the thermal molecules of oxygen and nitrogen. This 
means that the elements that can catch up with the satellite are 
confined to the very small portion of Maxwell's distribution 
that has a very high movement speed. This realizes an area with 
a very low element density behind the orbiting satellite. 
  Based on these assumptions, the vacuum level in the wake 
created behind a flying disk measuring 10 m in diameter reaches 
a maximum of 10[.sup]-13[/] Pa in terms of the partial 
pressure of hydrogen (Figure 5 [not reproduced]). In terms of 
the partial pressure of helium, it comes to 10[.sup]-16[/] 
Pa, while in terms of the partial pressure of atomic oxygen, it 
extends to as low as 10[.sup]-33[/] Pa. These figures are 
equivalent to a single atom of these elements existing within a 
space of a few hundred cubic kilometers. The fact that the wake 
has no walls means that a larger vacuum space is created behind 
the disk with the pumping speed approaching infinity, and thus a 
good weightless environment is realized. The University of 
Houston in the United States plans to grow a thin film of 
gallium arsenide in a wake experiment to be conducted aboard a 
space shuttle in orbit by erecting a 3.6 m disk in the shuttle's 
cargo bay. The first experiment was scheduled to take place in 
November 1993. The university plans to conduct three more wake 
experiments after this. 
  As described above, the next-generation semiconductor 
devices 
call for atomic-level device process technology. Under this 
increasingly stringent requirement, epitaxial technology is one 
of the most reliable process technologies available today. The 
background vacuum level currently available when growing a thin 
film using the MBE or CBE method stands at 5 x 10[.sup]-9[/] 
Pa. However, when these epitaxial film growing systems are in 
operation, the vacuum level deteriorates to 1 x 10[.sup]-6[/] 
Pa for the former method and to 10[.sup]-3[/] Pa for the 
latter. The system commonly used on the ground has many such 
chambers for growing the film. An increase in the number of 
chambers causes further deterioration of the vacuum level. This, 
coupled with the lowering of the vacuum level when the system is 
in operation, could lead to impurities finding their way into 
the synthesized thin film due to the scattering occurring near 
the specimen when growing a thin film. When the specimen is 
switched, the contamination from the chamber walls due to the 
hysteresis effect of a specimen used previously appears. These 
impurities affect the characteristics of these synthesized 
electronic materials, even if their contents are very small. 
Even if the density of a dopant is very small--for example, at 
the level of a few ppt--that cannot be detected by chemical 
analysis, its introduction can change the electronic properties 
of a substance. In order to grow a superlattice, it is said that 
the density of the impurity flux must be reduced to lower than 5 
x 10[.sup]-3[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] per second. This is 
equivalent to a partial pressure of lower than 2 x 
10[.sup]-16[/] Pa. 
<H5>  Epilogue </H5>
  The production process that takes advantage of the 
weightless 
and super-high vacuum environment of space will meet the 
requirements for producing advanced electronic materials, which 
call for an ability to control the characteristics at the 
molecular or atomic level. Until recently, the use of 
sophisticated experiment systems in space has been hampered by 
the malfunctioning of the systems caused by the mechanical shock 
of launch and by the lack of electric power in orbit. This, 
coupled with the problem of not having the opportunity to use 
the systems due to the few available, has discouraged 
researchers from conducting experiments in space. 
  However, in recent years the chance to conduct an experiment 
under a weightless environment has increased with the 
availability of various experiment platforms, including the 
completion of the world's tallest free-fall tower in Japan. When 
the construction of the space station is completed, it will 
become possible for us to conduct experiments using experiment 
systems as sophisticated as the ones we use on the ground. The 
decade of the l990s has witnessed a diversification of 
weightless experiment platforms, including the availability of 
the unmanned SFU free flyer and EXPRESS satellite with a 
recoverable capsule. Researchers in this decade will be able to 
select the type of platform most suitable for their experiment, 
a situation different from the 1980s when they had little choice 
and had to conduct experiments by adapting the experiment 
conditions to the available platform. This decade will make it 
possible for us to take greater advantage of the space 
environment in conducting experiments.

  [Text] Yamazaki (moderator): Gentlemen, thank 
you for taking the time out of your busy schedules to attend 
this discussion today. 
  It has been a long time since it was first said that Japan's 
space industry was experiencing a turning point. The end of the 
Cold War has resulted in a drastic decline in the international 
demand for weapons. This has made it necessary for us to review 
the significance of promoting space development for military 
purposes. In Japan, with the major change in the demand 
situation following the so-called Super 301 Article trade 
friction between Japan and the United States, the environment 
surrounding the space industry has become more complex. 
Meanwhile, we are currently living in the "space age." Last year 
we observed International Space Year. Under the slogan "the 
observation of earth from space," the designation of such a year 
was intended to promote space development. 
  In parallel with this effort, experts investigated and 
discussed the prospects of the space industry in Japan at the 
meetings of the Aerospace Industry Committee. Since the work of 
compiling a report on the results of the investigation and 
discussion has been completed, I would like to hear from the 
gentlemen attending today's meeting who were central members of 
the committee about the focus of the report. At the same time, I 
would like to hear your expectations with respect to Japan's 
efforts to promote the space industry. 
  I would like to have Professor Tsuchiya, who chaired the 
committee meetings, make the opening remarks. 
<H5>  Characteristics of Space Industry and Japan's Role </H5>
  Tsuchiya: The space industry is a major industry 
which involves a number of technologically-related industries. 
However, in space technology, Japan must step up her efforts to 
catch up with the front-running countries in the field. Japan 
has a comparatively long history of involvement in the space 
industry. However, progress during the postwar years has been 
deterred by the restrictions imposed by the war-renouncing 
Constitution. In these front-running countries, space-related 
industries have made great progress, encouraged by the need to 
produce increasingly sophisticated and lethal weapons. In Japan, 
the lack of the military incentive has caused the industry to 
lag behind these major space-related industrial nations. 
  However, the policy of sticking to the peace-oriented 
Constitution has a good side as well. That is, during the 
postwar years, efforts have been made to develop space 
technology for peaceful applications. The space industry is not 
the only industry which has experienced relatively slow progress 
in Japan. Among these slow-developing industries, what 
distinguishes the space industry is the fact that the industry 
has a longer history. I think that this long history reflects 
Japan's intention to maintain balanced industrial development. 
At the same time, the Japanese government may have felt a sense 
of obligation to contribute to the progress of international 
scientific technology through the promotion of space 
development. This has made it necessary for Japan to maintain a 
reasonably high technological level. In addition, this has made 
it necessary for Japan to maintain the right to participate in 
international scientific research meetings and the right to make 
announcements of research results. These necessities may have 
been behind the interdisciplinary cooperation among governmental 
organizations, academic institutes and private companies in the 
development of the space industry. 
  A long time has passed since Japan's space industry was said 
to be experiencing a turning point. Now Japan must earnestly 
consider the role it will be able to play. Japan must also 
consider how to overcome the disadvantages it faces in promoting 
space industry development. These are the questions we must 
tackle seriously in our efforts to develop Japan's space 
industry. 
  Moderator: The turning point issue has two 
meanings: a turning point in the efforts directed toward space 
development, and a turning point in the effort to develop the 
space industry. In fact, we are experiencing a turning point 
with respect to space development. In this sense, as Professor 
Tsuchiya has pointed out, the space industry must step up its 
efforts so that it can pursue its objectives on its own without 
governmental protection. Now is the time for us to step up our 
efforts so that we will be capable of coping with the problems 
Japan's space industry is facing. 
  I agree with Professor Tsuchiya in that we must make an 
effort to ensure a balanced development of the space industry 
vis-a-vis other domestic industries and to have the balanced 
development realized. 
  In space development, the development of rockets is 
experiencing particular difficulty. I would like to have Mr. 
Harada, as a central figure representing the space industry in 
an investigative committee, give his opinion of the current 
situation of space development in Japan. 
  Harada: This is a difficult question to answer. As 
has been pointed out, not only Japan, but also the United States 
and European countries are currently experiencing very hard 
economic times. In this sense, it is a global phenomenon that 
progress in space development is decelerating as a result of 
economic hardship. In Japan, the space industry is a minor 
industry and, accordingly, the budget for space research and 
development is small. This was pointed out repeatedly in the 
latest report. However, in terms of annual growth, the space 
industry has maintained growth close to 10 percent, a growth 
rate which is high compared to the growth rates of other 
industries. In this sense, I think the future of the space 
industry is promising. 
  As referred to a while ago, rockets constitute an essential 
part of space development efforts. As the vehicle providing the 
means for accessing space, the rocket actually constitutes the 
most important part of space development. Rocket development in 
Japan has progressed from the development of the N-I rocket to 
the H-I rocket. We are currently developing the H-II version 
which is scheduled to be launched next year. For those who have 
been involved in the development of rockets, launching the H-II 
rocket is the major goal for the time being. We are confident 
that the rocket will be launched successfully. The development 
of H-II rocket derivatives will be followed by the development 
of rockets which, having different capabilities, can be used in 
various launching tasks. This is the most important part of 
rocket development. In compiling the latest report, I glanced 
through the last report which was worked out in 1988. This 
report emphasized the "commercialization" of the rocket 
development business. 
  The latest report, on the other hand, places priority on 
improvements in the economy in rocket development and rocket 
business management. For Japan, it is impossible to develop 
commercial-grade rockets which can be launched at low cost by 
competing with those countries which have established advanced 
rocket technologies. Even if we cannot develop such rockets, the 
development of rockets which can be launched at reasonable cost 
will make Japan capable of playing a role in the international 
effort to develop rocket systems--a role which is as significant 
as the roles being played by these countries which hold advanced 
rocket technologies. This way of thinking characterizes the 
latest report. The current effort toward space development is 
two-pronged. One involves the development of the derivatives of 
the H-II rocket and the development of commercially-usable 
rockets of different capabilities based on the designs of the 
derivative models. The other is the HOPE project--a project 
involving the development of a space shuttle-type space vehicle. 
We wish to embark on this project in the near future. It will 
lead to manned space flight by sending HOPE shuttles to space 
using reusable rockets. HOPE will probably be launched with the 
H-II rocket or with a rocket to be developed based on a 
derivative of the H-II rocket. Considering the current high cost 
of the H-II rocket, the rockets must be greatly improved to 
allow reuse. The above description is the most plausible 
scenario to be followed in our space development efforts. The 
rocket, as a space transport vehicle, is a field in which new 
targets that must be met are appearing one after the other. 
Before moving on to tackle the next target, we must clear the 
hurdle of the successful launching of the H-II rocket. 
  Moderator: What about the launching of artificial 
satellites? 
  Koshisaka: As Professor Tsuchiya has pointed out, 
the international situation with respect to artificial 
satellites has changed with the end of the Cold War between the 
United States and the former Soviet Union. In the past, they 
competed with each other in space development as national 
projects. As opposed to these superpowers, Japan has been 
promoting space development not for military purposes, but for 
the peaceful use of space. When considering this change and the 
fact that Japan has restricted space development to peaceful 
uses, I wonder if the end of the Cold War has really caused the 
country to experience a turning point in space development. It 
is undeniable that the international situation with respect to 
space development has changed. However, my observation is that 
this change has not affected Japan much because space 
development in Japan has been restricted to that for peaceful 
uses. Japan's space development has no elements which are 
affected by the change in the international situation. 
  The definition of the term "space industry" is quite 
ambiguous. For example, the automobile industry has grown to the 
point that it is engaged in the production of cars without 
requiring government assistance. A business which has developed 
to such a degree could be regarded as an industry. 
  In this sense, space business in Japan is still too small to 
be regarded as an industry. In the case of the automobile, 
camera and electric appliance production industries, the 
international competitiveness they have today has been nurtured 
on the strength of a strong domestic demand. Similarly, in the 
case of the space industry, the development of a domestic demand 
will be a prerequisite for the industry's further development. 
In terms of business scale, Japan's endeavors in the space field 
have been too small to be regarded as an industry. The "Super 
301" clause has served to apply a brake to the development of 
the space industry. 
  The clause imposes very tough requirements on the domestic 
space industry, particularly on satellite manufacturers. Under 
these circumstances, manufacturers must step up their efforts to 
outlast the problems. The fact that Japan's space industry is 
still in the process of development may alleviate the adverse 
impact of the trade clause somewhat. More than 30 years have 
passed since I began working in the field of space development. 
From my experiences in such development, it seems to have taken 
a longer time for space endeavors to develop into a full-fledged 
industry than has happened in other industries. However, the 
degree of the setback caused by the Super 301 clause could be 
low enough to be overcome without much difficulty. By viewing 
the setback like this, we can entertain hopes for the future. To 
aid us in coping with this setback, we hope the government will 
take the initiative in fostering a domestic space industry. 
  The Super 301 trade clause calls for Japan to introduce an 
open bidding system for commercial satellites. This will require 
domestic satellite manufacturers to become more competitive in 
the international market. On the other hand, the clause calls 
for excluding from the open bidding system satellites to be 
launched to conduct advanced research and development. The 
communications industry in Japan has yet to improve its 
infrastructure, thereby realizing a speedier exchange of 
information over a wider geographical region, by launching more 
communications satellites. For the time being, it is important 
for us to strive to realize this. 
<H5>  Effort To Develop Space Industry </H5>
  Moderator: How the significant development of the 
space industry will be realized represents a difficult task. The 
continued expansion of space development will be the key to 
this. In addition, it will be important for us to promote 
cooperation among domestic companies, as well as between 
Japanese and foreign companies. 
  When taking these things into consideration, the system for 
developing space transport systems is expected to undergo 
drastic changes in the future. So far, a number of countries, 
including Japan, the former Soviet Union, the United States and 
EC countries, have been conducting space development 
independently. However, with the end of the Cold War, as the 
scale of the systems grows larger, the trend is toward securing 
compatibility among the systems being developed by the different 
countries. This trend represents a "turning point" in the 
development of space transport systems. Compatibility must be 
secured not for the sake of national prestige, but for the 
benefit of mankind. 
  Professor Nakayama, as a man who has been involved with 
space 
development in Japan from the time it was started, what is your 
opinion regarding this point? 
  Nakayama: My belief is that the development of 
space will bring benefits to mankind. Development plans include 
the exploration of the moon and Mars. As evidenced by today's 
weather forecasting satellites and transcontinental 
communications systems, the utilization of space has now become 
part of our daily activities. It is certain that the use of 
space will continue and expand. The question is whether or not 
the space industry can develop into a self-sustaining entity 
within Japan's economic system without government assistance. 
This question must be considered from a global perspective. 
Taking into consideration the fact that the development of space 
technology will benefit mankind, the ways in which each country 
has been pursuing space development must be modified. Now that 
the Cold War is over, I think that international efforts toward 
the development of space will take a form in which the 
cooperation and exchange of information and services will 
increase among the countries. 
  When such an environment prevails, Japan must be offered 
rights and opportunities equivalent to those accorded other 
countries. If Japan has something which is technologically 
superior, it can offer them to other countries. And, if Japan 
does not have the technology to produce something, it can 
request it from another country which has the right technology. 
This kind of flexibility will contribute to easing the trade 
friction. 
  A new perspective may arise when we become accustomed to 
this 
flexible thinking. The Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry has a number of departments devoted to fostering 
domestic industry. Today, there is a mounting urgency for some 
of these departments to create new sections to handle trade 
friction with foreign countries. These departments' practices of 
sticking to the tradition of protecting domestic industry is 
becoming increasingly out of date under the mounting 
international trade friction. In addition, when there are 
industries which are prone to causing major problems by 
disrupting the domestic economy, the government must deal with 
these problems by creating a new section. On the other hand, in 
those existing sections which oversee the industries which cause 
little trouble, assigning no more than one official to each 
section would be sufficient to take care of the industry. I 
think there is no need for the government to endeavor to foster 
a specific domestic industry by allocating unproportionally 
large resources simply because the government has departments 
dedicated to the promotion of the space industry. 
  It is important for us to maintain continued progress in 
space development. Accordingly, research and development must be 
promoted. Even if it does not produce profits, we must continue 
the development of space technology as long as the government 
continues allocating funds for the effort. We should take 
advantage of this government assistance. When a technology which 
can be put to practical application has been developed, or when 
the need for such a technology arises, then we can think of 
establishing a joint venture with foreign companies to put the 
technology into commercial applications. We can also think of 
selling the [resulting] parts, or of buying similar parts from 
foreign countries when the need arises. What is most important 
is that we continue our efforts toward developing space 
technology. 
  After we have successfully launched the H-II rocket, we can 
proceed with the HOPE project, and after achieving success with 
this project, we can proceed to another task. This is what is 
needed for us in space development. We do not know for certain 
what will happen in the years ahead. Those European countries 
which have been promoting the HERMES project recently began to 
hint that the project will be called off due to a lack of money. 
A thing like this can happen in any country. Even the United 
States is uncertain whether the country will launch a new space 
project after the current space shuttle program ends. Under 
these circumstances, it is possible that these countries will 
turn to Japan for help. Considering this possibility, it is 
important that Japan continue the development of space 
technology. We must promote this effort not as a business for 
producing profits, but to accumulate technological heritage for 
the future and to make a contribution providing international 
benefits by mobilizing the technological and economic resources 
which Japan can currently afford. 
  It is difficult to foresee the future of international space 
development. However, in recent years, it has become 
increasingly clear that a country's progress in the space 
industry is dictated by that country's economy. A deterioration 
of the economic situation in a country can lead to a decrease in 
reliability and flexibility and an increase in accidents. It is 
possible that the day when Japan will play a leading role in the 
international space development effort it will arrive earlier 
than expected. 
  Moderator: Professor Nakayama's observation of 
Japan's capabilities in space development seems to be contrary 
to that made by Professor Tsuchiya... 
  Tsuchiya: I suggested that Japan has been 
disadvantaged in space development based on the fact that 
Japan's efforts have concentrated on nonmilitary purposes and 
that these efforts have been hampered by many limitations, 
including the lack of proper rocket firing ranges. In actuality, 
however, Japan has achieved high technological standards on the 
international level with the development of the H-II rocket and 
satellites. As stated before, the space industry in Japan is 
still very young, and has the possibility of making great 
progress in the future. I think that the space technology which 
will be developed in the coming years will be used in many 
applications. Although not all of the technologies developed 
will be used in commercial applications as soon as they are 
developed, it is still important to continue the efforts to 
develop new technologies. Of course, in the development of space 
technology, the cost factor must also be taken into 
consideration. Efforts to reduce development costs will 
continue, and costs will go down as the reliability of the 
technology improves. 
  As Mr. Harada said, the developer seems to have great 
confidence in the performance of the H-II rocket. If there is 
much demand for rockets in the future, the production costs will 
be substantially reduced, and this, in turn, will generate 
additional demand. Here, the question is whether the lower costs 
will lead to an increase in demand or to the promotion of actual 
space applications. 
  Take the space technology which enables us to determine our 
current location using a satellite, for example. Currently, 
there is relatively great demand for satellite-assisted location 
finding equipment, even though the cost is high. If the cost 
were to decrease further, there would be many more car owners 
able to afford the equipment. If it is proven that yachts and 
ships equipped with such equipment have very low disaster rates, 
the demand for the equipment will increase greatly. If the 
equipment proves very useful, car owners driving cars equipped 
with it will save gas and travel time by avoiding getting lost 
while driving. This will make the introduction of such equipment 
pay off economically. The equipment would prove useful for me 
because I have gotten lost many times when driving alone and 
when driving through unfamiliar places. Other similar instances 
may exist in which the usefulness of the equipment has been 
proven. 
  Considering this, I think there is a strong possibility that 
current efforts in the development of space technology will lead 
to the generation of space industry. 
  At the same time, it is very important to continue the 
development of space technology in order to accumulate the 
technology as a common asset of mankind. The importance of this 
effort must be recognized by all people living in today's world. 
In order to promote this effort, I agree with Mr. Yamazaki who 
pointed out the importance of creating an environment in which 
such an effort can be promoted through international 
cooperation. Japan must participate in the international space 
endeavor even if she is forced to take charge of only a small 
portion of the endeavor. It is possible that space technology 
will be used in a wide variety of consumer appliances in the 
future. Taking this into consideration, it is important that 
businesses continue to invest in space development efforts, even 
if they do not produce profits soon. In order to make the 
investments pay in the long run, we must make efforts to foster 
the space industry. 
<H5>  Costly Space Development Effort </H5>
  Moderator: So far, two important things have been 
pointed out. As Mr. Harada said, the satellite-assisted location 
finder is a good example of applying space technology to 
commercial use. The satellites used for this purpose were not 
originally launched to develop the market for location-finding 
equipment. At first, the equipment cost about &yen;40 million. 
The demand for the equipment increased to the level of thousands 
of units per month shortly after the price was reduced to the 
&yen;150,000 level. This indicates that an industry can spring 
up in a very short time once the production cost of a product is 
greatly reduced. 
  The other important thing which has been pointed out is that 
space is an infrastructure which must be shared by all 
countries. In this connection, the market for mobile 
communications systems has a promising future. If the cost were 
cut substantially, the mobile communications service would 
become accessible to more people more easily. This would then 
make it possible for the market to expand further. 
  Space development has been criticized for the huge costs it 
requires. The hardware used in space development is very 
expensive. The current mobile satellite communications program 
was launched by taking the need to cut costs into account 
through the introduction of cost-cutting measures, which were 
worked out by introducing ideas drawn from Motorola's Iridium 
program. This program was developed by the private sector. 
  Koshisaka: Concerning satellite communications 
using geostationary satellites, until recently satellite 
communications have been performed mostly between these 
satellites and fixed ground stations. In general, satellite 
communications are superior to optical fiber communications, 
although the latter has a number of advantages, including a 
smaller time lag in signal propagation. Satellite communications 
makes it possible for communications to be conducted "any time, 
anywhere, with anyone," the ultimate goal of the communications 
industry. With the number of customers using it increasing in 
recent years, the mobile communications service operated using 
satellites will grow into a major means of communications by 
taking advantage of the superiority of space communications. 
This concept is backed by the fact that, in recent years, the 
industry producing automobile radiotelephones has witnessed a 
sharp increase in demand for the equipment used in 
communications via ground stations. 
  Whether mobile satellite communications systems are 
expensive 
or not will be dictated by the production costs. Considering the 
possibility that a satellite communications system will offer us 
the ultimate means of communication, our current efforts have a 
very promising future irrespective of the current high costs. At 
the same time, taking into consideration the fact that a 
satellite communications system will benefit people around the 
world, the development of such communications systems must be 
financed not only by a limited number of private domestic 
companies, but also by other establishments, including foreign 
companies. 
  Moderator: In recent years, with the availability 
of advanced communications networks, including gigabit-speed 
networks, it has become possible to transmit increasingly large 
volumes of information at faster speeds. When the technology 
behind these networks matches that of the satellite 
communications technology, it will become possible for the 
satellite communications market to expand greatly. 
  Koshisaka: I agree. 
  Moderator: Regarding research on WEDOS, in which 
you played a role, don't you think it is important to make an 
effort to increase the number of WEDOS service customers, 
particularly in the field of earth environment observation, in 
the sense pointed out by Mr. Koshisaka a while ago? I think we 
must make an effort to increase the number of customers who will 
use WEDOS services for various purposes, including disaster 
prevention. 
  Nakayama: World history since the Industrial 
Revolution shows that countries the world over have made efforts 
to overcome poverty. In today's industrially-developed 
countries, poverty has almost been overcome. The next task these 
countries must tackle will be the prevention of environmental 
destruction and natural disasters. Localized problems can be 
dealt with by local governments or individual countries. 
However, many of the problems arising in the world today are 
more than a single country can handle. With the recent progress 
in research on the natural phenomena occurring on the earth, 
including typhoons and abnormally high temperatures, we are now 
able to forecast droughts and floods. We must now launch a 
global effort to tackle these natural disasters as a problem 
common to all mankind. The introduction of space technology will 
help us greatly in our fight against these disasters. In this 
sense, we must promote space development, and WEDOS will prove 
to be very useful in these efforts. Japan must promote the 
international utilization of WEDOS. 
  I hear that the Red Cross has a very strong interest in 
WEDOS. The Red Cross has stockpiled medical and other emergency 
supplies at sites across the world in preparation for disasters. 
When a major disaster takes place somewhere in the world, the 
Red Cross first tries to grasp the number of people who have 
been hit by the disaster and must be helped. The Red Cross may 
have previously obtained statistical data which will enable the 
organization to fathom the extent of the disaster once such a 
natural calamity occurs. The availability of satellite 
observation data on the disaster would greatly help the Red 
Cross take action against the disaster. By combining the 
observation satellites with conventional natural disaster relief 
systems, it would become possible to create a more effective 
international relief system. I think politics is partially 
responsible for these advanced earth observation technologies 
not having been put to practical use more efficiently. 
  Many people have the misconception that space technology is 
very expensive to use. In actuality, a satellite launch costs 
about &yen;20 billion, which is roughly equivalent to the price 
of a single jumbo aircraft. 
  Moderator: Not so expensive in terms of a 
comparable price. 
  Nakayama: I wonder if a large oil tanker or a 
skyscraper like the ones you see in central Shinjuku in Tokyo, 
where such buildings are concentrated, can be bought at prices 
of about &yen;70 to &yen;100 billion. There are many other 
things with prices in this range which are being dealt with 
within today's economic system. When compared with these prices, 
the cost of launching a satellite is not extraordinarily high. 
Then why is satellite usage not more common? I think that the 
reason is that, at present, there is no established system to 
collect the fees from customers for their use of satellite 
services. 
  At one time, we thought it would not be very difficult to 
collect fees if we asked Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp 
(NTT) or the Japan Broadcasting Corp (NHK) to launch satellites. 
These two corporations have well-established, efficient systems 
of collecting fees for the services they offer across Japan. 
However, this thinking proved not to work in the satellite 
business because we failed to recognize the fact that their 
services are confined to the domestic market. Therefore, we must 
find other methods for collecting fees. 
  We were correct in thinking that fees should be collected 
for 
the services offered which employ satellites. Paying a fee for 
using a satellite-assisted disaster prevention system would be 
like paying a premium for a disaster insurance policy. If an 
international system to collect fees for the disaster prevention 
service were established, it would become possible to launch 
satellites. 
  As for the GPS [global positioning satellite] service which 
makes it possible to find one's present location, we have been 
using satellites launched by the United States. So far, our 
interest has been confined to the ground-use equipment, which 
runs about &yen;150,000, to use the service. If a system for 
collecting fees from all those using the service were created, 
it would become easier to launch a new satellite. There are 
other similar instances, including meteorological satellites. 
Many countries are benefiting from satellite service. However, 
these beneficiary countries have no intention of paying for the 
service, nor is there currently a system for collecting fees for 
the service. This is a major task we must tackle in the coming 
years. 
  We have been offering free information services using 
satellites to expand the use of space technology. It seems that 
the United States has been taking this strategy. The same can be 
said of the GPS and the remote sensing services in that they 
have been offered free of charge. However, it is possible that 
the time will come when customers who have been using these 
services free of charge will be required to pay fees if they 
want to continue to use the services. In order for Japan to keep 
in step with the United States in this respect, Japan must keep 
a close watch on the United States to read its real intentions 
in offering free space technology services. One way to avoid 
being taken aback by a sudden change in strategy by the United 
States is for Japan to actively participate in international 
space development projects, such as the Iridium program. 
  At present, I don't know which direction the free service 
system will be moving. However, the important thing is that it 
is time for us to earnestly consider this free service system 
from an international point of view by taking various factors 
into account, including the insurance system. In order to ensure 
the continued development of space technology, it is imperative 
that a system be established under which the customers must pay 
fees for the services they receive. To ensure continued 
development, the Japanese way of subsidizing R&amp;D programs 
using 
the taxpayers' money is not the best one. 
  Koshisaka: I listened to Professor Nakayama's 
remarks with great interest. So far, I have thought that the 
space development efforts had an aspect in which the effort to 
establish a fee-collection system was being ignored by offering, 
among other services, satellite services free of charge for 
earth observation and location finding. The same can be said of 
the services offered using LANDSAT, Noah and GPS. The United 
States has played a leadership role in offering satellite 
services free of charge. By establishing the fee collection 
system, it will become possible for people around the world to 
use satellite services without fearing the sudden suspension of 
services due to the lack of funds to operate them. 
  One more important thing is that the technology which has 
been developed as the fruit of space development efforts must 
bring benefits not only to the people living in today's world, 
but also to the people of future generations. Considering the 
fact that many people today are worried about the deterioration 
of the earth's environment, securing the money to continue the 
operation of the WEDOS service on an international scale by 
encouraging investment in the service will be important. By 
making the effort to secure the funds for continuous operation, 
we can avoid being criticized by those of future generations for 
our negligence in establishing a fee collection system. 
  Harada: In connection with Professor Nakayama's 
reference to the price of launching a satellite, the cost of 
producing a satellite may range from about &yen;10 billion to 
&yen;30 billion. But these figures do not include the cost of 
the rockets used to launch the satellite. In the case of Ariane 
rockets, the cost is &yen;10 billion, while with the space 
shuttle, the rockets used to launch the shuttle to a 
comparatively low altitude may cost between &yen;70 and &yen;80 
billion. This makes the total cost at least &yen;80 billion. 
This means that launching a space shuttle to a relatively low 
altitude two or three times costs the same as constructing a 
large-scale nuclear power plant. Taking this into consideration, 
a satellite launch requires vast amounts of money. 
  However, this does not mean that the high cost situation 
will 
continue forever. Humans have always been able to think of a way 
to solve the problems facing them. For example, when the United 
States participated in World War I, although I am not completely 
sure about this, the U.S. president ordered the production of 
25,000 aircraft. However, the number of aircraft actually 
produced stood at around 14,000. When the war ended, they were 
at a loss about what to do with the many planes left intact. 
Ultimately, they used the planes for air mail service. By going 
through this experience, they developed jet aircraft years 
later, followed by the development of jumbo aircraft in the 
1970s. Since the Wright brothers' feat occurred in 1903, jumbo 
aircraft were developed in a comparatively short time. During 
those years, production costs have been reduced to about 
one-hundredth. Taking this into consideration, the production 
cost of rockets may be reduced at a faster pace than we can 
imagine. A number of designs that differ drastically from the 
conventional ones have been proposed, for example, a transport 
system without Delta Clipper-type wings that rises vertically. 
The first flight test of an experimental model of this transport 
system is likely to take place in a month or two. Considering 
the speed with which new technologies are being developed, the 
reduction in production costs of space hardware may be realized 
at an unexpectedly fast pace. I think the space industry differs 
slightly from the automotive industry in that, in the former, it 
takes more time for the fruits of R&amp;D to be made available to 
benefit the people. If the production costs of space transport 
systems are drastically reduced, it will become possible for us 
to take space trips in the future. For example, people would 
experience great excitement when observing planets moving in 
their orbits through a telescope. Even such an experience as 
seeing the planets through the narrow visual field of a 
telescope would give people great excitement. People will feel a 
completely different level of excitement when it becomes 
possible to observe the earth or space from a spaceship flying 
in a comparatively low orbit. Currently, it costs about &yen;1 
million to lift a 1 kg load into orbit. If a man weighing 100 kg 
is to be sent, the cost will come roughly to &yen;100 million. 
This figure is unrealistic. However, if the cost were reduced to 
one-hundredth, it would become possible for us to take trips 
into space. This will be realized in the not so distant future. 
  In actuality, our continued efforts to develop the space 
industry have resulted in fostering other related industries. 
These include the broadcasting, communications and earth 
observation industries using satellites. These are a few 
examples for which the future is promising with respect to our 
efforts to develop space technology. The most important aspect 
of space development is for the development effort to be 
continued. Our avid interest in space will provide the driving 
force needed to promote the development effort. 
  When President Kennedy of the United States announced the 
Apollo program in 1960, he questioned himself regarding the 
significance of launching the program. He then answered the 
question by saying that they believed that space was the key 
that would determine the future of mankind. When this 
announcement came, the Cold War was continuing. President 
Kennedy also said that, concerning the significance the control 
of space would ultimately hold, no one could forecast it with 
confidence. Today, with the Cold War over, the phrase "control 
of space" should be changed to "development of space." Through 
his remarks, President Kennedy seemed to have wanted to say that 
space development has a charm that encourages people to 
challenge space. It was 30 years ago that he made those remarks. 
However, even today, it seems that space holds such a charm for 
mankind. This may serve as the driving force for our sustained 
efforts to develop space. It is the responsibility of such 
countries as Japan, the United States and European nations, 
which can afford to invest money in space development, to play 
leadership roles in promoting the development. 
  Tsuchiya: The question of space travel aside, the 
demand for space technology may increase in the future. As Mr. 
Harada said, we know from past experience that the production 
costs of industrial products continue to decline as the 
development progresses. The time will come when satellites can 
be launched for one-hundredth the current costs. With these 
possibilities expected to be realized in the not so distant 
future, what is important for us now is to promote space 
development by having a clear vision. The question is how to 
formulate the vision. If we can formulate the vision, it will 
become easier to develop various types of rockets--not confined 
to the development of derivatives of the H-II rocket--that will 
be appropriate for diversified launching tasks. The effort to 
cut production costs will become easier by having a clear vision 
of what purpose a specific hardware item serves. 
  I am not against the idea of collecting fees for the 
services 
from which customers benefit. However, I also think it is 
necessary to subsidize the development efforts until such 
efforts progress to a certain stage. For example, it was 
reported that the California state government was subsidizing 
transportation fees between Los Angeles and San Francisco. I 
don't know if the state has continued to shoulder part of the 
fees. Anyway, by following suit with California, the Japanese 
government should consider introducing a similar system to lower 
the air travel fees between Tokyo and Okinawa. Whatever form the 
system may take, it will be considered a government subsidy. 
Likewise, the government should allocate more funds to 
subsidizing the efforts to develop the demand for space 
technology. 
  We benefit from television weather forecasts. However, we 
would not easily accept it if the television viewing fees were 
to be increased, for example, by &yen;100, just because we 
benefit from the forecasts. Such an increase must be covered by 
a government subsidy. As for the subsidy to space development 
efforts, the government must review its policy on subsidies to 
promote the development of the space technology infrastructure 
for the benefit not only of Japan, but also of the world. For 
the time being, the space industry cannot help but depend on 
governmental assistance to nurture the industry. 
  However, I cannot accept the thinking that we should press 
the government to increase the space development budget 
substantially by covering the increase 100 percent with 
taxpayers' money. Many people in the industry share this view. 
But I would say that, before they make such a demand, they 
should make efforts to create a market for space technology. 
<H5>  Space Development--Common Goal of Mankind </H5>
  Moderator: Mr. Harada pointed out the importance 
of the space industry's playing a leadership role in promoting 
development in the communications and broadcasting industries as 
some of those space-related industries. On the other hand, 
Professor Nakayama stressed the importance of the Japanese 
government's playing a leadership role in promoting cooperation 
among countries of the world in tackling global problems, such 
as the deteriorating environment. These efforts, representing 
the need pointed out by Professor Tsuchiya, will be allowed to 
receive the "forward-looking" government subsidies. I share 
Professor Tsuchiya's opinion on promoting these endeavors. 
  As for the necessity of clear vision, as Mr. Koshisaka said 
a 
while ago, we must switch our space development from a 
military-oriented effort to a nonmilitary effort--that is, in 
terms of protecting the earth's environment, to switch from the 
development of planet earth to the preservation of a good global 
environment. In order to promote the tackling of global 
problems, including environmental ones, cooperation must be 
promoted among the people involved in space development the 
world over. 
  Nakayama: Concerning space travel, it may be 
possible to reduce the production costs of rockets. However, it 
is unlikely that the cost of the fuel required to launch rockets 
will be reduced to one-tenth or one-hundredth the current costs. 
At one time, it was said in the United States that it would be 
possible to reduce the fuel costs substantially. I have recently 
begun to think that such a substantial reduction would be 
impossible. The U.S. view failed to pay due consideration to the 
costs of producing rocket fuel. 
  Moderator: There are some people who do not care 
about the costs of space travel--those newlyweds who are taking 
honeymoon trips. (Laughter) 
  Nakayama: There may be some people who are willing 
to pay &yen;10 million to take a trip to space. However, if the 
cost for space travel is expected to be greatly reduced in the 
not too distant future, [few people may pay such huge sums]. 
  We should continue our efforts to reduce the production 
costs 
of rockets and the launching costs of satellites. However, we 
should not expect these costs to be reduced progressively when 
the production volume increases, as has been the case with 
automobile and household electric appliance manufacturing. This 
is because we will not need as many as a million rockets. And, 
it is unlikely that the production costs would decline to 
one-tenth if the production volume were to increase 10 times. Of 
course, the effort to cut production costs as much as possible 
must be continued. At the same time, it is important to devise a 
scheme which will require the customers of satellite services to 
participate, facilitating the launching of satellites. It will 
not be easy to collect money from every customer. Under the 
circumstances, we must think of other methods. For example, you 
may have noticed that commercial television stations have 
greatly improved their weather forecast presentations by 
introducing illustrations that are easier for viewers to 
understand. The reason that these stations have used extra money 
in their effort to improve their presentations has something to 
do with the effort to attract more viewers to their programs. 
For example, even if a news program does not amuse the viewers, 
they may be attracted to the news program, broadcast by 
commercial television stations, because they want to see the 
beautifully-rendered weather forecast which traditionally 
follows a news program. The increased number of viewers will 
contribute to these commercial television stations' making more 
money. 
  The method of collecting money does not matter. The 
important 
thing is that there is a way to ensure the continued 
availability of sufficient funds to finance space development 
endeavors and to nurture the environment in which space 
technology will be used actively. 
  As for the GPS, for the time being, Japan can concentrate on 
developing the receivers necessary for using the GPS for 
position or location finding, as well as on making money by 
selling the receivers. However, Japan must be prepared to 
shoulder half the cost of the continued operation of GPS service 
by launching satellites. 
  In recent years, the United States has been cutting its 
shares in financing space development programs from the original 
100 percent to a half or even a third, depending on the type of 
program, and has been pressing other countries to increase their 
shares. Under the circumstances, it is expected that, in the 
next 10 to 15 years, these countries will be required to accept 
their share of the responsibility in terms of money or tasks 
involved in promoting space development. 
  Before jumbo aircraft came into service, probably when DC-8s 
were still in service, every passenger was required to pay the 
regular fare. However, with the introduction of jumbo planes and 
with the availability of many more seats, the concept of a 
"bulk" fare system, or a much-discounted fare system, was 
introduced. Thanks to this, group tours of foreign countries by 
Japanese citizens became very popular. In the case of space 
development, a similar strategy could be adopted. In conducting 
an experiment to create a material aboard a space ship, if the 
experiment were conducted by a single researcher, he would have 
difficulty convincing his boss that he had achieved the results 
he expected. By establishing a system under which researchers 
from a number of countries will be able to conduct experiments 
jointly aboard a space lab, and by establishing a system in 
which the results of the experiment are shared by the 
participating countries, such an experiment will become easier 
to conduct. 
  As a way of convincing people that &yen;10 or &yen;20 
billion 
is not extraordinarily high, I have cited the costs involved in 
constructing the great Seto Bridge, which reached &yen;1 
trillion. The authorities are reportedly in favor of 
constructing more such bridges at other sites in Japan in the 
future. In the meantime, the local governments use a total of 
&yen;1.3 trillion of the taxpayers' money for garbage disposal 
every year. If efforts were made to reduce the volume of the 
garbage to half, &yen;600 billion could be saved, which could be 
used to subsidize the space industry. My opinion is that the 
central government must continue to shoulder the costs required 
to promote efforts that will eventually benefit people. 
  Koshisaka: It will be important to form a national 
consensus on that question. 
  Nakayama: The problem is that many members of the 
general public, who have little understanding of the meaning of 
space development, insist that the space issue must be excluded 
when discussing government subsidies. In addition, there are 
others who have been publicizing the merits of space development 
that, in actuality, will be almost impossible to realize. This 
is very embarrassing for us involved in space development. 
  Tsuchiya: Indeed, it is unlikely that even a brisk 
demand for satellites and the rockets to launch them will 
approach 1 million satellite or rocket units in the future. 
However, I think that the production cost of the H-II rocket can 
be reduced to half by the time the total number of rockets 
produced approaches 16. 
  Koshisaka: Here, the rule of thumb comes into 
play. There is a big difference in fuel and production costs 
between producing one rocket and several rockets. 
  Tsuchiya: I agree. The cost can be substantially 
reduced. Some may say that paying a high cost for space 
development is not a problem considering the fact that we pay 
such a high cost for garbage disposal. Nevertheless, we must 
continue our efforts to reduce space development costs by 
increasing the demand for space technology. Many more customers 
could be obtained by improving the reliability of space 
technology and by lowering the insurance costs. It is expected 
that international cooperation will be promoted further not only 
in sharing the cost of launching satellites, but also in 
developing fields for utilizing space technology. In addition, 
international cooperation must be promoted in sharing satellite 
launching facilities. For Japan, this will alleviate the burden 
of constructing new satellite launching centers within the 
country which would have poor functional flexibility. 
  Nakayama: Incidentally, in connection with the 
price of Boeing 767 engines, I hear that the engine 
manufacturers are being asked by customer airline companies to 
lower prices. These companies claim that, considering the fact 
that the prices of commercial airplanes have been decreasing in 
recent years, engine prices should be lowered. Lowering engine 
prices will contribute to further decreases in plane prices. In 
negotiations for purchasing aircraft, these airline companies 
present the prices they can afford. This forces the plane 
manufacturers to step up efforts to cut production costs by 
reviewing the efficiency of the production line and the 
suitability of the production technology being used. On the 
other hand, in the space industry, nothing like this 
cost-cutting process has taken place. There has been no 
discussion on how much production costs can be cut to 
manufacture a rocket which will be priced at, for example, 
&yen;10 billion. 
  Discussions or negotiations will lead to taking a further 
constructive step. One possibility would be to go ahead with the 
rocket fabrication by cutting the price, sacrificing profits, to 
meet the customer's request. Another possibility is negotiating 
with the customer to create several rockets, thereby making the 
production pay. It is essential that we introduce a cost-cutting 
process, as is being practiced in the airline industry, into the 
space industry. 
  Tsuchiya: That means we can still visualize a rosy 
future for the space development effort, can we not? 
  Nakayama: Yes, we can. 
  Koshisaka: In space development, too, we must 
consider the factor of "design to cost." The development of 
space hardware and space technology service must be promoted by 
taking the cost factor into consideration. 
  The effort to meet the requirements as much as possible 
under 
a given cost is very important in pursuing R&amp;D in the field 
of 
system engineering involving advanced technologies. To my 
regret, however, the importance of this effort is not 
necessarily understood by all those involved in space 
development. 
  Nakayama: The lack of a sufficient number of 
customers is partly responsible for the poor understanding. 
  Koshisaka: If those involved in R&amp;D were to 
understand the importance of the concept of design to cost, they 
could find some alternatives in their development efforts--for 
example, by opting for the use of less-expensive conventional 
technology instead of the costly most advanced technology. The 
people currently involved in space development lack this 
flexibility. 
  Tsuchiya: They must make an effort to use 
well-established conventional technology as much as possible. 
  Koshisaka: What is required is for them to make 
the proper judgment regarding which technology is to be used in 
the system being developed, and which technology is not to be 
used. At present, they are not good at making such judgments. 
  Nakayama: We still have many problems that must be 
tackled. 
  Tsuchiya: All in all, it is important for us to 
continue the efforts to achieve a balance between technology and 
cost, and to promote international cooperation in space 
development. Space issues must be tackled from the viewpoint of 
promoting mankind's utilization of space by avoiding a situation 
in which the development efforts are hindered by conflicts over 
the possibility of the monopolization of space by a limited 
number of countries. To promote such development, I hope the 
government will promote international cooperation, for example, 
by increasing the official development assistance (ODA) funding. 
  Moderator: With Mr. Tsuchiya's remarks having 
summed up the topic of today's meeting, I would like to close 
this discussion. Thank you for joining me in meeting today.
