<F P=106> [By Mobaidur Rahman] </F>
  [Text] The present government claims that it has achieved 
macroeconomic successes, but its impact is not discernible in 
the microeconomic sectors. The recent chart depicting the 
economic trends in different countries prepared by the World 
Bank and the Asian Development Bank indicates that no noteworthy 
progress has been made in the economy of Bangladesh. Rather, 
the situation has worsened in certain sectors. 
  It is unfortunate that the flow of foreign investment to 
this 
country is still very insignificant. Between 1986 and 1991, 
foreign investment worth $1.338 billion were made in India and 
$1.131 billion in Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, total foreign 
investment in this period totalled $297 million. During this 
period, foreign investment worth only $11 million dollars was 
made in Bangladesh. Other than clothing-related industries, no 
other industrial units were set up in the country during this 
five-year span. On the other hand, 3,000 plants were declared 
sick and subsequently closed. 
  The industrial growth rate in Bangladesh during the past few 
years has been estimated at 5 percent. In other poor countries 
of Asia, the rate was between 7 and 8 percent. In 1970 the 
contribution of investment to the Bangladeshi GDP was 11 
percent, but in 1990 it went down to 10 percent. 
  The contribution of the manufacturing sector to the GDP is 
20 
percent in India, 24 percent in Thailand, and 16 percent in 
Pakistan. In Bangladesh it is only 9 percent. Apart from the 
poor industrial growth, losses in the industrial sector have 
become routine. In 1992, industrial units in the nationalized 
sector incurred losses amounting to 20 billion taka. The losses 
suffered by the industrial sector are partly responsible for the 
slow growth in direct foreign investment. This discourages 
foreign investors and impedes development. We are not only 
unable to attract overseas investors, but have also failed to 
protect the interests of foreign companies already operating in 
the country. Several foreign companies including Philips, 
Glaxo, Bangladesh Tobacco Company, ICI, and Dhaka Match Company 
have already concluded their business and left the country. 
  Business circles have expressed dissatisfaction over the 
privatization move initiated by the government. They say that 
since the time of the Ershad government, it has been said that 
the Telephone and Telegraph Board will be converted into a 
holding company. So far the government has failed to do so due 
to threats by the workers' union. During the past three years, 
the government has failed to privatize even one large industrial 
unit from the nationalized sector. About a year ago, the state 
minister for textiles, Abdul Mannan, announced that 60 to 70 
billion taka would be spent to set up about 1,000 industrial 
units in the textile sector. Nothing has been done so far. It 
has been learned that the government has not yet approved the 
proposal by the minister for the development of the textile 
sector. 
  The government says that foreign investors are discouraged 
by 
the frequent strike calls. Foreigners believe that the 
deteriorating law and order situation and a weak administration 
are particularly responsible for scaring investors away. A 
similar sentiment was also expressed by Mr. Milam, the former 
U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. In this regard, several foreign 
missions in Dhaka have cited the recent murder of an eminent 
industrialist named Humayun Zahir. Campus violence and killing 
has become routine. The labor union leaders do not hesitate to 
hold the mill managers hostage to press their demands. These 
factors not only deter foreign investors from coming, but also 
discourage local entrepreneurs. Due to this, there has been no 
development in the microeconomic sectors.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Creating a Frankenstein"] </F>
  [Text] Having failed to read the signals properly when on 
November 9, 1993, Ms Barbara Bodine, acting co-ordinator for 
counter-terrorism, US, spoke to the National War College in 
Washington DC about the dastardly attacks of the Kurds in 
various cities, the criminal conspiracy to assassinate President 
Bush in Kuwait and terrorism in various parts of the world 
leaving out conveniently Pakistan without a mention, India has 
done well not to respond to the latest US gimmick of dropping 
the Pressler Amendment against Pakistan. It is nothing but a 
gimmick to draw India into a bilateral dialogue between the 
United States and Pakistan. By choosing to ignore the bait India 
has done well. Any response or resentment by India would have 
drawn the country into what is essentially a bilateral issue and 
equate its own position to that of Pakistan, that being the 
original bait, thus getting trapped into the dragnet of US 
strategic policy to work out a nuclear understanding in the 
South Asian region. India's reluctance to sign the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty due to its discriminatory character has 
been a bugbear with US defence and strategic analysts. The US 
approach to the nuclear issue encapsulates two worlds, the 
have's and have nots--the distinction being made on the grounds 
of who exploded the nuclear bomb before 1967 and those who did 
so afterwards. Instead of protecting the weak and the have nots, 
the US policy discriminates against them and expects all their 
facilities to be placed under the International Atomic Energy 
Agency inspection regime; no self-respecting sovereign country 
could be expected to toe this line willingly. What is most 
diabolical about the treaty is that though it expects the have 
nots to sign the treaty, the treaty per se does not 
contain any clause that extends help and protection to the 
suffering nation in the event of an attack by a nuclear power 
nation. Aware of India's growing economic and scientific clout, 
also aware of India's reluctance to sign the NPT, the United 
States is now using its cat's paw, Pakistan, to enmesh India in 
a regime which will satisfy its strategic needs. 
  From being on the brink of being labelled as a terrorist 
state to the dropping of the Pressler Amendment against it, 
Pakistan has proved to be a mere pawn in the strategic games 
that US plays in South Asia. The Pressler law proscribes 
military sales and economic aid to Pakistan till the US 
President certified that Pakistan was not making nuclear 
weapons. What new and objective evidence has the US pounced upon 
in the last six months that it is willing to drop the Pressler 
law against Pakistan? If anything, the evidence pointing to 
state sponsored terrorism by Pakistan is only mounting. More 
than 20,000 people have died in Punjab and the toll is around 
7,000 in Kashmir till now, and the contribution of Pakistan to 
this death and gore is very critical. The bomb blast in the New 
York Trade Centre is child's play when compared to the mayhem 
created in Bombay this year. Again, it was Pakistan which had a 
lot to explain for such happenings. All these would not have 
happened but for the funding, safe haven, and logistical support 
provided to terrorists by Pakistan. While the US recognises the 
large pool of operatives from Afghanistan working in the Middle 
East and the former Soviet Union, it turns a Nelson's eye to the 
most compelling evidence as to Pakistan's nefarious activities 
in the Indian sub-continent. The US policy has, from time to 
time, proved to be quite thoughtless having created 
Frankensteins wherever it operated. This was the case with the 
World Trade Centre conspiracy, this was the case with respect to 
Iraq and many more such examples can be given relating to UK, 
Germany and France. By choosing to play around with countries in 
the sub-continent, the US is again at its game of pitting one 
country against other, to garner valuable benefits for itself. 
The dropping of the Pressler law against Pakistan will lead to a 
fresh bout of arms purchase by both, Pakistan and India. This 
can only upset the economic reforms programmes being put in 
place by them and also put the peace process of the entire South 
Asian region in jeopardy. Should any such development occur, the 
responsibility will rest solely on the United States of America.

<F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: "U.S. Arms for Pakistan </F>
Operations in Somalia"] 
  [Text] Washington, Dec. 2--The Clinton Administration is 
considering transfer of arms worth $45 millions to Pakistan 
apparently to augment the operations of Islamabad's forces in 
Somalia. The American military transfer, free of charge, to 
Pakistan, is part of a proposed $106 millions of military 
assistance to the U.N. forces in Somalia. 
  Sources in the State Department are unwilling to reveal the 
details of the proposed transfer to Pakistan, but have told THE 
HINDU that the transfer is under active consideration of the 
Clinton Administration. State department sources insist that the 
arms are only for the use of Pakistani troops deployed in 
Somalia and they would not be entitled to take it back with them 
to Pakistan when they leave Somalia. 
  The sources are also reluctant to reveal the nature of the 
military package that is being proposed to be transferred to 
Pakistan. But they suggest that it consists of equipment that 
will facilitate the operations of the Pakistani contingent in 
Somalia. The equipment could include anything from a handful of 
advanced tanks to auxiliary equipment. 
  The American decision to transfer arms to Pakistan via the 
U.N. peace-keeping and peace-making operations is not entirely 
new. State Department sources say that the Clinton 
Administration transferred some armoured personnel carriers and 
transport equipment to Pakistani forces in Somalia last summer. 
But they are unwilling to comment on the exact value of that 
transfer. 
  The Clinton Administration's plans to provide arms to 
Pakistan through the U.N. peace-keeping route has angered the 
U.S. Congressional leadership. In a letter sent last week to the 
U.S. Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, a group of 
Senate Republicans, led by minority leader Bob Dole and Jesse 
Helms, have criticised the Administration's proposal to provide 
military assistance to the U.N. forces in Somalia. 
  The Senators said they were "deeply troubled" by the 
Administration's plans to transfer weapons to the Pakistani 
contingent in Somalia. The Republican Senators said such a 
transfer would circumvent the 1985 Pressler Amendment, which 
bars economic and military assistance to Pakistan because of its 
nuclear weapon programme. 
  But the Administration insists that such arms transfers to 
Pakistan do not violate the Pressler law. Since early 1992, when 
it presented a new interpretation of the Pressler Amendment, the 
State Department has been arguing that only direct 
government-to-government military sales are prescribed by the 
Pressler law. 
  They have suggested, in a clever but tortuous legal 
argument, 
that commercial sales of military equipment to Pakistan do not 
come under the ambit of the Pressler Amendment. The Congress in 
general and Senator Larry Pressler, in particular, have objected 
to this interpretation of the non-proliferation law; but the 
Administration has stuck to its guns. 
  Liberating itself from the constraints of American 
non-proliferation law, the U.S. Government has resumed the sale 
of military spare parts and other equipment to Pakistan since 
1992. But the administration told the Congress, notwithstanding 
its new interpretation of the Pressler Amendment, that it will 
be cautious in considering arms transfers to Pakistan. 
  The U.S. Government says all such transfers will be on a 
case-by-case basis, and Washington will not let Pakistan enhance 
its military capabilities either through upgradation of the 
military equipment or an increase in its numbers. However, the 
Administration has often said that it will not allow a 
deterioration in Pakistan's military capabilities. 
  The military significance of the proposed American arms 
transfers to Pakistan is clearly limited. The political message 
emanating from Washington may be more important. That Washington 
is prepared to find any means--including the United Nations 
peace-keeping operations--to launder military equipment to 
Pakistan, signals a new political resolve in the Clinton 
Administration to revive the strategic relationship with 
Islamabad and reinvigorate its ties with the military in 
Pakistan.

  [Text] Amritsar, 27 Nov (TINS)--India has registered 
its protest against the recent move by Pakistan to deploy army 
personnel in the guise of Pakistan Rangers on the Indo-Pakistan 
border. 
  The protest was registered during the two-day biannual 
meeting of officials of the Border Security Force (BSF) and 
Pakistan Rangers, held here this week. 
  The army soldiers were reportedly deployed during the 
general 
elections in Pakistan, apparently to strengthen the vigil on the 
border. In the normal course, the armies of both the nations 
must remain about 5 km inside the border as the protection of 
the border is entrusted to the BSF in India and the Pakistan 
Rangers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mr Amr Moussa by Ramesh Chandran; place and </F>
date not given] 
  [Text] Cairo, December 1--For the past three months, Arab 
capitals like Cairo, Damascus, Amman, Beirut, Tunis and Rabat, 
as well as the Israeli cities, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, have been 
enlivened by absorbing diplomatic activity to harness together a 
comprehensive and tangible peace agreement for West Asia. It is 
but natural that amidst such a mosaic of complex diplomacy, some 
of the more resourceful and felicitous individuals manage to 
catch the eye. 
  In the recent past, amongst those who have managed to 
distinguish themselves in this diplomacy--at least in terms of 
sheer and strenuous volume of effort--have included Mr Philip 
Habib, Mr James Baker and Mr Warren Christopher. But an Arab 
diplomat who is lately attracting notable attention is Mr Amr 
Moussa, Egypt's multi-lingual foreign minister. 
  Like an Arab Henry Kissinger, Mr Amr Moussa has been 
indulging in recent months in an unflagingly zealous and 
formidable schedule. This month alone took him to Washington, 
Jerusalem, Damascus and Amman, besides Mogadishu, Abu Dhabi and 
Bahrian. Egypt has often produced first-rate international civil 
servants as well as accomplished diplomats. Mr Amr Moussa is the 
third member sought after by the international media in an 
Egyptian troika that includes the U.N. secretary general, Dr 
Boutros-Boutros Ghali, an Egyptian capt, and Mr Ismat Abd 
Al-Maguid, the secretary general of the Arab League. 
  Although there may be differences in national debates in the 
interpretation of the precise ingredients of Egyptian national 
interest as well as the best way of securing them, there is 
broad concurrence that the independence, security and prosperity 
of the national community of Egyptians should take precedence 
over all else. 
  This relative unanimity about national identity and 
interests 
makes Egypt exceptional among the Arab states of West Asia. It 
has also given Egypt's presidents and foreign ministers 
considerable latitude in formulating foreign policy. This helps 
explain why the erstwhile President, Mr Anwar al-Sadat was able 
to sign the dramatic peace accord with Israel in 1979 as well as 
why the present president, Mr Hosni Mubarak, has been able to 
abide by the terms of that treaty. These features could also 
explain the sure-footed diplomatic moves Egypt made to oppose 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and to rally Arab members to 
participate in an international coalition against Iraq to which 
Egypt despatched 30,000 troops. 
  It is the same savoir faire and confidence that 
Egypt often displays in international mediation today. Be it in 
Somalia where Mr Amr Moussa has proposed to the Organisation of 
African Unity [OAU]--of which Egypt is the chairman--that Africa 
ought to develop a diplomatic mechanism for crisis management 
in the continent or seeking international troops in Burundi, 
which Egypt regards as a fellow Nile country. This week's focus 
in Cairo was however on Libya where an adamant Muammar Gadaffi 
is squaring up to the Clinton administration over the release of 
the two Lockerbie bombing suspects. Egyptian diplomats have been 
working up a back-breaking schedule to try to prevent the 
sweeping U.N. sanctions against Tripoli. 
  Having undertaken another leg of his diplomatic shuttle, on 
his return, Mr Amr Moussa's schedule included setting-up secret 
talks in the Egyptian Sinai enclave of Taba between Palestinian 
and Israeli negotiators. Fifty-seven-year-old Mr Amr Moussa is a 
product of the faculty of law of Cairo University and has held a 
variety of diplomatic assignments including the post of director 
of the international organisations department and Egypt's 
permanent representative to the United Nations. He had a highly 
successful and visible stint in New Delhi from 1983 as Egypt's 
ambassador. 
  Smoking his customary cigar, the foreign minister spoke to 
THE TIMES OF INDIA at his new and sumptuously furnished foreign 
ministry office in downtown Cairo. Moments after the interview 
concluded the minister remarked that he had to make a "dash for 
the airport" to receive King Hussein of Jordan. Mr Nagui 
El-Ghatrifi, the articulate spokesman of the foreign ministry, 
was present during the interview. Selected excerpts: 
  After the peace accord was signed between the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Israel, there was a momentary 
lull. Now there seems to be a fresh impetus to the peace 
negotiations with Egypt playing a central role. Are you 
optimistic that we might see a new breakthrough? 
  Yes, indeed, I am optimistic. Things are going in the right 
direction. I don't think they (Israel) will retract on the 
agenda that has been agreed upon between the PLO and themselves. 
Generally negotiations are promising on both the bilateral and 
the multilateral tracks. This of course does not mean there will 
be no difficulties, obstacles or no risks here or there. But 
overall in the region, it seems to be a one-way traffic towards 
peace. I hope that developments will prove me right. The 
Palestinian-Israeli track has already crossed the 
point-of-no-return and the negotiations on Gaza and Jericho are 
also progressing in the right direction. And let me say that the 
Israeli-Syrian track is also not a lost one. 
  Is it then reasonably accurate to state that if the 
Syrian-Israeli talks on the Golan Heights cause extreme dilemma, 
then the Jordanian and Lebanese tracks are less complex? 
  Yes, I would agree. The Jordanian track has already produced 
all the drafts necessary for establishing the framework for an 
agreement. The Lebanon negotiations are even more clear as it is 
a matter of Israeli withdrawal. Even the former Likud government 
had declared that Israel had no territorial ambitions in 
Lebanon. I am positive that if we can really work out a good, 
working, acceptable way of negotiations then the results can be 
achieved. 
  Watching the bloody events in Gaza, the initial 
unenthusiastic response from Hamas and the opposition from 
hardline elements to the peace accord signed by Mr Arafat, has 
this scenario for peace been too upbeat? 
  This opposition is exaggerated. The Gaza hardliners have a 
point of view and it is their right to accept the peace accords 
or to oppose them. However, they have promised not to use force 
or enter into an armed conflict with their brethren or to create 
havoc with the security situation. This, I find, is quite 
satisfactory. Unless of course the arrangements that have been 
agreed upon do not work out. That then is another matter. 
  One finds West Asia commentators looking ahead to the 
next decade painting all sorts of hopeful, rosy scenarios, 
thriving Israeli-Arab economic partnership, portraying even Gaza 
as a flourishing commercial entrepot. Your comment? 
  All these factors that you are referring to are possible... 
It can happen. But much will depend on the developments during 
the next two years. So let us wait and see. I prefer to withhold 
my expression of optimism on this issue. 
  Let's turn to bilateral relations. The high point was 
during the times of Nehru and Nasser. People still recall both 
leaders when referring to Indo-Egyptian ties. Since then, there 
has been a downtrend in this partnership... 
  There has been a king of downtrend. But not a malafide 
downtrend. It resulted from force of circumstances... from 
different priorities. This area has seen difficult times. It has 
been prone to conflicts and wars and Egypt has been involved in 
all this and India, which had its own priorities in South Asia, 
was not in the frontline in West Asia. The Cold War and its 
aftermath has also had its repercussions on the totality of the 
situation in the third world, in non-aligned meet forums. 
  The 1967 war was another turning point which in turn 
affected 
its ties with India and the 1973 war set the relations on a 
different level. Then of course there was Camp David. As of now, 
the prospects for better relations are very good. We believe 
that India plays a major role in her region in the same way we 
do in this area. 
  India's leading position in the third world is recognised by 
Egypt. It is even urged by Egypt. There is no competition 
between us, only complementarity. The strong bonds which you 
referred to during the days of Nehru and Nasser were but an 
expression, or a manifestation of those deep-rooted relations, 
although I don't put the good-relations era as having begun at 
the times of Nehru and Nasser. I would say they began much 
earlier. 
  I am one of those who has advocated the necessity of having 
excellent relations between India and Egypt. Not that we 
wouldn't differ on this or that point but the basic premise of 
our relations should be more cooperation and interaction. 
  Some people in Delhi still recall your successful 
tenure as ambassador. They say forget about worn-out rhetoric 
about non-alignment and concentrate instead on enhancing trade 
and commercial relations between our two countries... 
  Yes, yes indeed. We should focus on economic ties. In fact 
we 
hope to discuss precisely these issues when we meet in Delhi for 
the G-15 summit. And we should set the concrete agenda for more 
meetings, more dialogue. As for your reference to my 
ambassadorship in Delhi, I am very much upset that you say that 
there are only "some" in Delhi who recall my tenure. I would 
have thought "many" would remember me. (Laughs) 
  Regarding regional tensions in South Asia and 
specifically on the Indo-Pak dispute over Kashmir, where do you 
stand? 
  We would very much like to bring this conflict to a close. 
You will appreciate that I cannot publicly--it would be very 
unwise of me if I did--discuss details on this issue. The 
Kashmir dispute is a very old conflict. However, Pakistan has 
succeeded in putting the problem back on the international 
agenda. So many more are talking and discussing Kashmir. Once 
this has been achieved, sitting together and attempting to solve 
it is the best way. Because Pakistan will live with India and 
India will live with Pakistan forever. Remember we are sorting 
out some of our ancient and great problems in the Middle East... 
  Are you suggesting that India and Pakistan should 
follow the example set by old enemies, the PLO and Israel, and 
talk frankly across the table? 
  You are talking. But talks should be fruitful. They should 
have a point and talks should not be setup for the sake of 
talking... 
  In India as well as in Egypt there is serious concern 
about religious extremism and the violence it evokes. Are you 
coming to grips with curbing fundamentalism? 
  Well, as far as India and Egypt, there is some commonality 
of 
events as far as religious extremism is concerned; it is also a 
global phenomena. However, each country has its own 
peculiarities as far [as] this is concerned and has to devise 
individual ways of tackling them... 
  But in your attempts to devise ways of tackling them, 
you have invited some fiery criticism from human rights groups 
concerning Egypt's human rights' record. 
  No, no. This is a sweeping formula. We cannot simply throw 
our countries open to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with 
different motives and agendas. And you can never tell what 
exactly they are doing or even who exactly is doing this. And 
mind you, not all those people who work in NGOs are deep 
thinkers; perhaps many are activists. We need to respect the 
basic principles of sovereignty of our rights, the basic tenets 
of human rights and the principles of fundamental freedoms. But 
we simply cannot submit ourselves to double standards. 
  What double standards? 
  Well, in Bosnia-Herzegovina when "ethnic cleansing" was 
being 
practised, we did not see such fervour from the very same 
non-governmental organisations. So let us adapt one yardstick 
for all. I have argued these points publicly at the Vienna 
commission on human rights and said, that we either have one 
yardstick for all or let's simply forget about this. 
  Looking at the role of the United Nations and its 
somewhat activist role, I was recently on a reporting mission in 
Baghdad. There the impact of U.N. sanctions has squarely hit the 
man-on-the-street whilst hardly affecting the regime in power. 
Now we hear that sanctions against Libya are to be enhanced. Is 
this an effective method of diplomacy? 
  First of all you should not put yourself in a position where 
sanctions have to be applied against you. Second, one needs to 
assess the international situation with caution. This of course 
does not mean we do not sympathise with the plight of our 
brothers in Iraq and Libya. We definitely do. Our work was to 
strike a balance between our obligations and international 
legitimacy which in a broader context is what the U.N. does too. 
  The situation as regards Libya is beginning to look 
dismal. Can diplomacy persuade their leader to give up the 
Lockerbie suspects? 
  This is what we are striving to achieve. For now, one can 
only be hopeful.

  [Text] New Delhi, Nov. 30 (UNI)--India will continue to 
extend moral, material and technical assistance to the 
Palestinians to help them consolidate their progress towards 
self-government, the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, and 
the External Affairs Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh, said here on 
Tuesday. 
  India also offered to train para-medical staff from Gaza and 
Jericho town, which had been granted self-rule by Israel and 
provide scholarships and seats to Palestinian students in its 
universities and colleges. 
  The Prime Minister in his message here on the occasion of 
the 
observance of the international day of solidarity with the 
Palestinian people, said "we hope that all involved in the 
middle-east peace process will seize the opportunity of the 
peace accord for the advancement of the cause of peace and for 
just comprehensive settlement, which restores to the people 
their legitimate rights." Speaking at a function here, Mr Dinesh 
Singh said India will offer goods worth $1 million to the 
Gaza-Jericho self-government authority. 
  A team of experts will be deputed to these areas to conduct 
feasibility studies for setting up a common facilities centre to 
impart training in small and medium scale industries and thereby 
generate employment. 
  Mr Dinesh Singh said the world must face the challenge of 
terrorism unitedly. 
  It is the need of the hour to denounce all forms of 
destabilising terrorism wherever it exists, "including 
cross-border encouragement and subversive activities from 
neighbouring countries." He said the signing of the declaration 
of principles on interim self-government arrangements was a 
notable first step towards ensuring peace and stability in West 
Asia. 
  India will lend its good offices whenever required towards 
confidence building measures in the area, he added. 
  "We hope that these steps would lead to further positive 
developments aimed at achieving the legitimate rights of the 
Palestinian people."

  [Text] New Delhi, 27 Nov--Though primarily an attempt to 
canvass support for lifting international sanctions against 
Yugoslavia, the forthcoming two-day visit to India of the 
Yugoslav Foreign Minister, Mr. Vladislav Jovanovic, extends 
beyond this fixed agenda. This was indicated here by the 
Yugoslav Charge d' Affairs, Ms Milena Vlahovic. 
  Speaking to this correspondent on the eve of the Foreign 
Minister's visit (he arrives here on Sunday, Ms Vlahovic said 
the purpose was to inform the Indian leadership "about the 
situation in the Balkans, propose possible solutions as well as 
explore the possibilities of future interaction, including 
cultural exchanges." 
  Itself a victim of ethnic infighting, Yugoslavia is expected 
to back India on the Kashmir issue. Ms Vlahovic said Yugoslavia 
"completely and unconditionally supports the stand that Kashmir 
is an integral part of India." 
  However, the emphasis on the sanctions issue is indicated in 
the Foreign Minister's itinerary. Apart from calling on the 
President, the Prime Minister and holding discussions with his 
counterpart, the External Affairs Minister, parleys between Mr. 
Jovanovic and the Commerce Minister are also slated. 
  Mr. Jovanovic's visit coincides with the European Foreign 
Ministers proposing a wideranging settlement on the Yugoslav 
question. 
  Covering Croatia as well as Bosnia Herzegovina, this plan 
urges Serbs to offer land to the Bosnian Muslims more than what 
they conceded in the talks which broke down last summer. In 
return, an easing of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro is being 
promised. 
  In addition, aiming to provide relief to the affected 
population, European negotiators want safe passage for U.N. 
relief convoys. Wanting to create another link to central 
Bosnia, the Europeans hope to send technicians to reopen the 
airport at Tuzla. 
  Urging the removal of sanctions, the Yugoslav Charge d' 
Affaires said their negative impact was felt in the 
Balkans. Referring to the geographic centrality of the country, 
she said the sanctions had also been detrimental to Greece, 
Romania and Hungary.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 1--Mr. P.R. Kumaramangalam, Union 
Minister of State for Science and Technology as well as 
Parliamentary Affairs, has been "ejected" from the Cabinet by 
the Prime Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, on the eve of the winter 
session of Parliament, commencing tomorrow, apparently for 
criticising him (Mr. Rao) for the party's poll debacle in Uttar 
Pradesh. 
  The formalities in this respect have not been completed, as 
the President, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, is away. But the 
acceptance of the resignation forwarded by the Prime Minister is 
a mere technicality. 
  The President is expected back tomorrow. The recommendation 
to drop Mr. Kumaramangalam from office has been sent to him. 
  The Minister himself was not available for comment, but 
sources close to him said that he had not written to the Prime 
Minister offering to quit. This tended to confirm the report 
that the Minister's resignation had been sought by Mr. Rao. 
  Mr. Kumaramangalam is the third Minister from Tamil Nadu to 
go out of the Union Council of Ministers, the earlier two being 
Mr. K. Ramamurthy and Mr. P. Chidambaram. Interestingly, Mr. 
Kumaramangalam had offered to quit the Government when the 
Cauvery water issue hotted [as printed] up between his State and 
Karnataka. 
  Clearly, Mr. Kumaramangalam's stinging letter to Mr. Rao on 
the party's election debacle in U.P. and Delhi, in which the 
Prime Minister was criticised for his handling of the party 
affairs, and the virtual dismissal of the entire Congress 
Working Committee (CWC) sought, has cost him his job. 
  Mr. Rao moved against the Minister on the eve of a meeting 
of 
the CWC which is likely to go into the kind of issues 
highlighted by Mr. Kumaramangalam. It is to be seen if this has 
a sobering effect at the CWC. 
  Mr. Kumaramangalam, in his letter, had also said that he 
would be obliged to take "further steps" if his suggestion for 
the resignation of the entire CWC was not accepted. This was 
widely interpreted as an offer of resignation. Subsequently, 
however, the Minister clarified that his was not a case of 
revolt, and that he was not criticising the Government, but the 
conduct of party affairs. 
  During his tenure under the leadership of Mr. Rao, the 
outgoing Minister was engaged in some important Government 
activity, including the attempted resolution of the Ayodhya 
crisis before the demolition of the disputed structure. 
  However, sources said that Mr. Kumaramangalam had developed 
differences with the thrust of the Government's economic 
policies and had lately been voicing his concern in official 
quarters.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 1--In a significant observation, the 
foreign secretary, Mr J.N. Dixit, has said India was willing to 
discuss with Pakistan some compromise to resolve the Kashmir 
issue, reports UNI. 
  Making the comment in an interview with "Asianet" satellite 
channel, the foreign secretary said that during his talks with 
his Pakistani counterpart, Mr Shaharyar Khan, in January next 
year, he would have a "limited brief, that is to emphasize to my 
colleagues in Pakistan that we are willing to reason with them 
to find some compromise to this difficult problem." 
  Mr Dixit said unilateral and "absolute claims cannot be the 
basis for solving this problem." 
  "We have to take into account the developments of over 40 
years on both sides of the line of control, in seeing where we 
should go," he added. 
  The foreign secretary noted that "previously we were saying 
that we will not discuss Kashmir at all unless interference and 
support to terrorism was stopped." 
  "We have now been told that they (Pakistan) are willing to 
discuss this aspect. If that is so, we can take the next step 
for dealing with Kashmir directly. 
  Referring to the Clinton administration's decision to 
withdraw the Pressler amendment, Mr Dixit said that Washington 
was pursuing a policy of non-discrimination and pressure to push 
countries towards non-proliferation. 
  The first step would be to withdraw the Pressler amendment 
and then introduce legislation, which will apply to all 
countries about whom they have doubts. 
  He said that in the last 18-19 years "We have constantly 
taken a decision not to make N-weapons." 
  The foreign secretary expressed views on a number of topics 
including India's relations with China, the U.S. and other 
issues. 
  On India's relations with China, Mr Dixit said both sides 
have an equal level of reasonableness in interacting with each 
other. 
  He said then Prime Minister, Mr Rajiv Gandhi's visit to 
China 
was a landmark. The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's 
visit in September laid firm foundations, which culminated in 
the signing of an agreement to maintain peace and tranquility on 
the line of actual control. 
  The foreign secretary said China is not only a regional 
power, but a global power. He said India should not also 
underestimate the capacity of three continental 
states--Kazakhstan, Russia and Japan.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Dominance of Contributions in Elections"] </F>
  [Text] It is indeed a mighty big problem to regulate the 
election expenses of the candidates and political parties. The 
Chief Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan has again embarked upon 
a good mission to focus attention on the issue. Due to serious 
drawbacks in the election laws, it has not been possible to 
strictly monitor the election expenses. Among all the various 
aspects of the election law, the rules and regulations 
concerning election expenses have become ridiculous aspects. 
  It is estimated that a major party, on national level spends 
up to Rs.1,000 crores (10 billion rupees) on each election. How 
does it get this huge amount? The elections create an illicit 
relationship of ties between politicians and leaders of 
industries. This is the cause of black money (unaccounted or 
hidden) growing into millions of rupees, according to the 
intelligence experts. So far no serious effort was undertaken to 
put an end to this most unpleasant chapter in the history of 
Indian democracy. 
  In order to rectify these drawbacks, suitable amendments to 
the law have to be made. Without waiting for the parliament to 
do this, Seshan has begun to make use of the existing provisions 
of the law to take effective action. He has decided to revise 
the forms intended to get the data regarding election expenses; 
Candidates should give not merely expenses incurred by them, but 
also paid by others, meaning their parties, or other individuals 
or organizations. It is also essential that the candidates 
should solemnly swear and declare that they do not hide anything 
and no expense was omitted. Of course, those who cheat and 
deceive may still invent ways to escape from strict measures. 
Yet there is nothing wrong in making these regulations as rigid 
and strict as possible. 
  It is of course, true, that the dominance of money power in 
elections cannot be eradicated by the action of the Chief 
Election Commissioner. It will be possible only if political 
parties and the government give their full cooperation in the 
matter. Politicians should not hesitate in giving the election 
commission the authority to audit the expense accounts of the 
political parties. In the absence of such an arrangement, 
candidates will show only a fraction of their real expenditure. 
This is because politicians have been practicing the art of 
cheating for so long a time that they have made a mockery of the 
election rules regarding the excessive election spending.

<F P=106> [Analysis by Panrutti Ramachandran, Tamil Nadu MLA (Member </F>
of Legislative Assembly): "Election-Epilogue: The Victory of the 
Common Man] 
  [Text] The world had expected that the elections in four 
states in North India would usher in an important turning point. 
The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] has been playing up Hindu 
religious fundamentalism, spreading hatred against Muslims and 
labelling theirs as the true nationalism, was said to be poised 
for a great victory in these elections. 
  But only in Delhi and Rajasthan did the BJP come into power 
with a narrow majority. But in the states of Himachal Pradesh, 
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, the party was driven out of 
power. 
  Now the BJP says, 'what if we are out of power? We have 
secured a larger percentage of the votes. But they forget that 
it was the same electoral system that elevated them to the seat 
of power. The argument seems like a drowning man clinging on to 
a straw. 
  The BJP aroused emotions among the people but did not 
respect 
truth at all. Emotions may flare up suddenly and also disappear 
all of a sudden. It was by arousing religious sentiments that 
they came into power so suddenly and in the same way lost it too. 
  It has been an accepted fact all over the world that 
everybody is an equal to one another and that every person is 
entitled to equal opportunity. The BJP failed to respect the 
truth and proceeded to emphasize differences and neglected to 
concentrate on vitally basic issues like poverty, joblessness, 
soaring prices of essential goods and this, in fact, brought 
about the downfall of the party. 
  Janata Dal stands for social justice. This party had made 
sacrifices for that cause. Mulayam Singh Yadav when he was Chief 
Minister of Uttar Pradesh, mobilized the people to put up a 
stiff fight against the BJP. He was ridiculed by the BJP which 
called Maulana Mulayam Singh Yadav. As a result of these factors 
the people of the state believed that the best alternative to 
the BJP is Yadav's coalition and they elected his party to 
govern the state. It is not enough to feel there is an 
injustice. But one should stand up and fight against it and for 
this cause undertake any kind of sacrifice. Only such kind of 
people could command respect--this is the lesson learned from 
these elections in Uttar Pradesh. 
  The Congress Party's victories in Madhya Pradesh and 
Himachal 
Pradesh are the result of the dissatisfaction among the voters 
against the BJP ministries there. 
  The election results in these four states have shown, to put 
it in a nutshell, that the true victory belongs not to any 
party, but to the common man. 
  The Bharatiya Janata Party with its stand on Ayodhya issue 
demolished the Babri Masjid and carried on a vigorous campaign 
of hatred and the common man in Uttar Pradesh, searching for an 
alternative leader, found the right person in Mulayam Singh 
Yadav. 
  The BJP regimes in Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and 
Rajasthan failed to solve the day-to-day problems of the common 
folks and the common man decided to teach a lesson to the BJP. 
If only the Congress had waged a vigorous campaign against the 
BJP, it could have won more seats. 
  So far as the Janata Dal was concerned, it was a party 
coming 
out with good ideas. But it did not grow to be a party that 
could be an alternative to form a ministry. The common man also 
realized if he supported the Dal, votes against the BJP would be 
scattered away. This factor was not realized by the Janata Dal. 
Hence it met with defeat. 
  These election results convey loud and clear one message: 
Whether a ruling party or a party that aspires to get into 
power, in order to secure a majority of seats, the party should 
instead of promoting politics of hatred, work hard in finding 
solutions to the people's problems and improving their standard 
of living. 
  The very fact that these election results demonstrated to 
the 
world at large that an Indian citizen is superior to their 
political leaders, is a significant turning point in itself, is 
it not?

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Anger of Muslims and Backward </F>
People Caused Congress' Defeat"] 
  [Text] Bombay, 21 December (N.P.)--One of the main causes 
of the Congress defeat in the Bombay Municipal Corporation 
bye-elections in six wards was the anger of Muslim and backward 
classes against the Congress Party. There was a significant 
increase in the votes for the Janata Dal. It will not be easy 
for the Congress (I) to form another government or win the 1995 
general election . It is very likely that Shiv Sena will take 
over the Bombay Corporation again. 
  It appears that the Muslim voters have not forgotten the 
destruction of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on 6 December 1992 
and the destructive riots that followed it. That is why they did 
not vote for the Congress (I) candidates. Almost 100 percent 
Muslim votes went to the Janata Dal candidates. If we compared 
the results of the general elections held two years ago with 
these bye-elections, we will find that the votes for the Janata 
Dal have almost doubled. In Dharawi, the Janata Dal candidate 
received 3388 votes. Similarly, in Tulsiwadi and Nayagaon, they 
received more than 1400 votes compared to the 800 votes received 
last year. 
  The backward classes also did not give all of its votes to 
the Congress (I) because of the change in nomenclature. They did 
not only not vote for the Congress, but did not give full 
support even to Savita Jitia (Tardev), a Dalit candidate 
representing coalition of the Congress and Republican Party of 
India. The number of the Dalits in that district was more than 
half. 
  The Shiv Sena leaders are overjoyed at this victory and the 
Congress (I) leaders have started to accuse each other. The 
unhappy group of Congress councilors is ready to come out in the 
open against Ramanand Lad, the leader in the Corporation. 
Veteran city councilor R.T. Kadam is leading this group of young 
councilors. He himself is also in the race for becoming the 
mayor. Mr. Lad has lost some prestige because of the defeats of 
Congress candidates, especially in Dharavi. Ramanand Lad (the 
future mayor) was given the responsibility of making sure that 
the Congress (I) candidate from here wins. 
  It will be difficult for the Congress (I) to have its 
candidate as the mayor. The Shiv Sena has increased its number 
of seats from 67 to 71 after winning four more seats. The number 
of Congress members is 109 now. The number of the joint 
opposition has increased to 110. These numbers clearly indicate 
that there will be a lot of bartering during the next mayoral 
elections in March 1994. 
  Looking at the committed supporters of Shiv Sena, and the 
Muslim and Dalit voters who are unhappy with the Congress (I), 
it is clear that the Shiv Sena might win the majority in the 
next election. The Muslims knew that voting for the Janata Dal 
was indirectly voting for the Shiv Sena. Still, they did not 
vote for the Congress (I). Mr. Gunwant Seth, a Congress worker 
who visited homes for votes during the election, said that the 
Muslim voters expressed distrust in the Congress (I) in these 
words, "We can give the key to our house to Shiv Sena people, 
not to the Congress (I). 
  The Congress (I) leaders are blaming these reasons, bogus 
votes, lack of committed workers, and the fact that the major 
leaders did not take this election seriously for their 
defeat.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 1--In what could be termed as the 
most soul-searching exercise since Mr. Narasimha Rao came to 
power in June 1991, a meeting of the Congress(I) Working 
Committee here tonight devoted the bulk of its time to 
discussing the party's debacle in Uttar Pradesh and what needed 
to be done to make good the loss of the traditional base among 
the backward sections of society including the minorities. 
  The Committee meeting to deliberate on the election results 
in the five States of the Northern belt and the future 
implications of the verdict for the party appears to have been 
dominated by the Union Welfare Minister, Mr. Sitaram Kesri, who 
has been highly critical in the last four days of the leadership 
for its failure to capitalise on the fertile ground for the 
Congress(I) in the Hindi heartland. 
  To continue: The party spokesman, Mr. V.N. Gadgil, who 
briefed correspondents on the deliberations of the Committee 
meeting, said only six members of the CWC got an opportunity to 
express their views on the just concluded elections and the 
Committee would continue with the introspection session 
tomorrow. Mr. Kesri, who was the first speaker at the meeting, 
was expected to continue with his speech tomorrow as he had to 
leave mid-way to attend an official function. 
  Among those who took part in the two and half hour meeting 
were Mr. R.K. Dhawan, Mr. A.K. Antony, Mr. Sitaram Kesri, Mr. 
N.D. Tiwary, Mr. K. Karunakaran and Mr. Pranab Mukherjee. 
Presided over by the party president, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, 
the meeting was attended by all the memberts barring four who 
were busy either in Shimla or Jaipur in managing the post-poll 
situation in these States. Those absent at the meeting included 
Mr. Rajesh Pilot, Mr. Balram Jakhar and Mr. Nawal Kishore Sharma. 
  In response to questions, Mr. Gadgil said two members of the 
Committee disapproved of the letter of the Union Minister for 
Parliamentary Affairs, Mr. P.R. Kumaramangalam, seeking the 
resignation of all members of the CWC for their collective 
failure in managing the U.P. Assembly election. Asked about the 
reported resignation of Mr. Kumaramangalam, Mr. Gadgil expressed 
surprise over the development and said he was not aware of any 
such resignation. 
  Supports Rao: In his presentation before the CWC, Mr. R.K. 
Dhawan is reported to have argued in favour of Mr. Narasimha Rao 
and maintained that the defeat of the BJP was a historic 
achievement for the party. He referred to 'deliberate attempts' 
by vested interests to project that the Congress(I) was nowhere 
in the picture and said the rank and file in the party had 
proved beyond doubt that the party was strong and the people 
were behind it. 
  Mr. Kesri in his speech is reported to have complained that 
the party did not succeed in projecting the achievements of the 
Government for the welfare of the backward classes, particularly 
its decision to implement the Mandal Commission report. He 
pleaded that Committee members take note of the changed social 
reality, particularly in U.P., and emphasised the need to create 
a more pro-backward and minorities image. A strong plea for 
greater representation of BCs and minorities in the party power 
structures was also made. 
  The controversial issue of distribution of tickets among the 
kith and kin of the big guns in the party in Rajasthan and the 
consequent damage to the prospects of the party in the State 
also figured in the course of the deliberations. However, no 
names were mentioned in this connection. 
  It was mentioned that the success in Madhya Pradesh was 
partly due to the distribution of party tickets to 80-odd 
members of backward classes. The Committee was told that the 
minorities in other States opted for the Congress only because 
they had no choice unlike as in U.P. A suggestion was made for 
strengthening the Seva Dal as a volunteer force to match the RSS. 
  Research wing: There was a suggestion for the creation of a 
research wing to analyse the election results particularly in 
Uttar Pradesh. It was mentioned that of the 28 seats, won by the 
party in the State, 20 had been captured after a gap of several 
years. It was also said that in Madhya Pradesh, there was 
consistency in the performance of the party in the 1991 Lok 
Sabha and the current Assembly elections and a point was made 
whether there was any model which could be replicated from the 
M.P. example. 
  A member of the Committee suggested that a three-day 
extended 
session of the CWC meeting be called after the coming session of 
Parliament for a detailed review of the election results. The 
CWC would consider the suggestion tomorrow. 
  The ongoing session of the CWC is certain to overshadow the 
scheduled customary meeting of the Congress(I) Parliamentary 
Party coinciding with the winter session of Parliament tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mastram Kapur: "Will Mulayam Work to Fulfill </F>
Peoples' Expectations?"] 
  [Text] Generally the whole nation has welcomed the SP-BSP 
[Samajwadi- Bahujan Samaj Party] government in Uttar Pradesh. 
Except for some fundamentalist elements who are badly shaken by 
this total change in the low castes after centuries, everyone 
should be happy . In a society divided by stratification, the 
confrontation does not take place between those sitting on the 
top rung with those on the bottom rung. The confrontation 
usually happens between those sitting on adjoining rungs--first 
with second, second with third, and third with the fourth. There 
had been some confrontations between the backward classes and 
the scheduled castes. A cooperation between these groups heralds 
major changes, and these changes can convert a ladder-like 
system to a flat social system. The BSP-SP coalition can be a 
strong platform for the claim that the BSP leader Kanshi Ram has 
made about changing the vertical system to a horizontal system. 
  The skepticism expressed by some people about the stability 
of this coalition keeping in mind the traditional confrontation 
is not unjustified, but is pessimistic. The optimistic view 
point would be that history has taken a turn, and this change 
could be the beginning of a major historic transformation. 
  These Vidhan Sabha elections, which can be called mini 
general elections, have given some clear signals which, if read 
correctly, can indicate the path of the future of our politics. 
The first important signal is that the 1990 division of the 
Janata Dal was unreal and unnecessary, and the unity of various 
Janata Dal factions, under whatever name, is the need of the 
time. The Janata Dal in Bihar and Orissa, the Samajwadi Party in 
Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Janata Dal in Haryana, and other 
smaller parties in other states all represent the socialist 
movement and the desires of the farmers and laborers. This 
movement is inspired by the desire to change centuries-old 
unfair social system into an equitable system. Because of their 
personal ambitions and the conspiracies of the opposing forces, 
they were divided even when they agreed as it happened during 
the 1967-70, 1977-79, and 1989-91 periods. The anti-national 
communal forces that ignore the Constitution were able to gain 
power because of this internal strife. The Congress (I) had been 
able to rule at will because of the weakness of this movement, 
and this made our nation's situation very precarious. Therefore, 
keeping in mind out nation's interests, these divided groups 
must unite. 
  The second point made by this election was that politics of 
such useless issues as temple-mosque cannot always work. They 
must raise the issues that the people confront daily. The people 
are being squeezed by high prices and are tormented by the 
corruption spread throughout government offices. They are 
suffering from lack of electricity, water, health, and other 
amenities and from unemployment. All constitutional institutions 
are corroding. All services for the people (mail, 
transportation, distribution of services, health, education, and 
police) are now very unstable. The people will turn away from a 
political party that ignores these issues and tries to kick 
around unnecessary issues to take advantage of them. 
  Another signal issued by this mini general election is that 
the politics of those who make up parties in thin air will not 
be successful now. The tragedy of the Janata Dal has been that 
it had good leaders but they could never unite. No political 
party can function effectively without first organizing itself 
at grassroots levels of district, county, and state. In 
addition, the structure of the party will not be strong without 
the support of such sub-groups as youth, women, labor-student 
organizations, and organization of creative camps for the 
training of the party workers. The Janata Dal became weak 
because of the appointment of party officials through 
nomination, search for candidates and workers at the time of the 
general elections, and last minute efforts to find money for 
election expenses. Every party members understands this problem 
and we do not need to provide any proof of it. Opposed to it, 
the secret of Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi Party's success is that 
he worked hard for two years. He visited every part of the 
state, organized camps for training his workers (in the five-day 
camp in Mussoorie, about 1,000 boys and girls had participated), 
and maintained contact with all the workers. He has to focus on 
building a good structure of the party for a lasting success. 
  The main reason the eyes of the whole nation will be focused 
on Uttar Pradesh is to see how the Mulayam Singh-Kanshi Ram 
government operates. Will it follow the old system, or will it 
be innovative? The people will have this question in their minds 
because the style of change agents is different from the status 
quo type of parties. The SP-BSP coalition has already expressed 
its commitment to change. The change should not be immediate and 
superficial; it should be long-term and fundamental. The 
attitude of the Congress (I) and the BJP governments is to 
disrupt the status quo minimally, because change is dangerous to 
their existence. We saw that during the anti-Mandal campaign. 
However, the status quo can be dangerous to parties that herald 
change. These parties will self-destruct if their tendency for 
change is fake, have the goal just to somehow stay in power, and 
avoid breaking up the old died traditions. That is what happened 
to the V.P. Singh government at the Center in 1990-91. It spent 
the nine months of its duration wondering whether it should 
carry out the Mandal Commission recommendations, and whether it 
should make a solid political decision over the Babri Masjid-Ram 
Janambhumi issue. It formed committees after committees, and 
questions were postponed. In the end, this policy of 
procrastination drowned it. 
  The positive aspect of the SP-BSP government is that the 
issues such as temple and Mandal that incite people are dormant 
now. The Supreme Court has given its decision on the Mandal 
issue and it will be implemented easily. The temple issue is 
also in the Supreme Court and the BJP will continue its efforts 
to keep this issue alive. However, this issue can be dealt with 
logically without any problem. In the Mandal application, 
following the Karpuri Thakur formula would be useful because 
this formula proved to help unite the backward castes in Bihar. 
  The main criterion for Mulayam Singh-Kanshi Ram government's 
success will be how diligently is it able to carry out the 
developmental plans in Uttar Pradesh that have been neglected 
for years. They do not have to depend on the Center for 
reformation in such areas as supply of electricity and water, 
roads and transportation system, health and education, and 
efficiency of government offices. However, the people will feel 
relieved if actual work is done in these areas. The people of 
this country are simple like Lord Shiva who was happy with the 
flowers of dhatura (intoxicating plant). Their needs are very 
few and their worldly desires are not unlimited like the 
societies that are slaves of the consumer culture. Still, these 
people yearn hopelessly for these small comforts and minor 
reliefs. This shows that this nation never had a government of 
the people. It will be the responsibility of the SP-BSP 
government to make the people feel that it is the government of 
the people. 
  However, the most important responsibility for Mulayam Singh 
and Kanshi Ram will be to remove the bitterness felt by various 
groups in the society against each other and creation of an 
environment of acceptance and good will. This bitterness is a 
natural outcome of the efforts to break up the caste system. All 
this had started when the Constitution was written and 
implemented. This process has been going on slowly and invisibly 
since the Constitution promised equal political, social, and 
economic rights to every citizen, and gave them the assurance of 
freedom, equality, and brotherhood. These changes have finally 
begun to emerge in concrete form. The society conditioned to 
living in one way for centuries is naturally to feel the pains 
that come with change. This process can be made comfortable if 
the political leaders form a policy of sympathy and cooperation. 
  Similar bitterness was felt here when the small kingdoms 
were 
phased out and the landlord system was ended. We passed that 
phase easily thanks to the hard work of our dedicated leaders. 
We need the same understanding and empathy during the period 
when the caste system is being broken. Uttar Pradesh is the most 
sensitive state from this perspective, and they must be 
especially cautious here. The SP-BSP government has to be 
careful here. We are happy to learn that the cabinet that 
Mulayam Singh's has announced shows representation from all 
caste groups. What flaws there are, can be removed later. This 
government must refrain from the showing favors and taking 
revenge. For the first time in history, scheduled castes and 
backward groups have formed a government. It is natural for the 
higher castes to have all kinds of misgivings. To remove these 
suspicions, the SP-BSP government must debut the new politics of 
impartiality, hard work, tolerance and wide-spread 
collaboration.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Time for Action"] </F>
  [Text] The most important and the main implication of the 
report presented by the joint parliamentary committee 
investigating the century's greatest financial scam is that our 
finance ministry is criminally negligent in following its 
procedures and that the accused persons must not be let go. The 
committee found Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, Health Minister 
B. Shankranand, and Village Development Minister of State 
Rameshwar Thakur guilty. It has also put Satya Prakash 
Maulaviya, minister of petroleum in former Prime Minister 
Chandra Shekhar's cabinet, and the ministries of railways, civil 
aviation, petroleum, and fertilizers in the line of the accused. 
It appears that the whole structure of our economic system is 
rotten. Manmohan Singh was declared to be responsible for the 
horrible negligence by his ministry, banks, and financial 
institutions. Rameshwar Thakur is blamed for holding a circular 
letter written against Harshad Mehta for about one month and not 
taking any action on it when he was the minister of state for 
finance. What vested interests had forced then-Petroleum 
Minister B. Shankaranand to ridicule the rules of the Petroleum 
Industries Development Board and invest money in Canfina Bank 
and Syndicate Bank? Former Civil Aviation Minister Madho Rao 
Scindia is also accused of dragging his feet in investigating 
the Vayudut officials who had invested money without following 
procedures. 
  The committee found that our economic system had started to 
corrode in 1982. One hand did not know what the other was doing. 
There was looting every where, and the vested interests were 
taking advantage of it all by ignoring all laws and procedures. 
The vested interests had found loopholes in the economic 
policies formed after 1982, and the administrations of Indira 
Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, V.P. Singh, Chandra Shekhar, and P.V. 
Narasimha Rao all stood in "one posture in the bath house." 
Narasimha Rao was unfortunately accused of taking 10 million 
rupees in bribes in the Pratibhuti scam. This sent the message 
to every corner of the nation that if our major leaders are 
taking bribes and making money by spurious means, then why 
should not [the common people] also make money. A similar 
message was sent by the Bofors scandal. Anyhow, the joint 
committee has cleared the prime minister of the accusation of 
receiving 10 million rupees bribe. However, it has recommended 
investigation of Gold Star Company with the prime minister's 
son, Prabhakar Rao, is associated. Former minister Chidambaram 
can also be involved in this investigation because he was also 
associated with Gold Star. It is obvious that Manmohan Singh, 
Shankranand, and Rameshwar Thakur have been put on trial, and if 
they are even minimally ethical, they should either admit to 
their wrongdoing or offer believable refutation. 
  Just below the line of the cabinet members, the 
parliamentary 
committee has lined up S. Venktaraman, governor of the Reserve 
Bank, and two deputy governors, Amitabh Ghosh and Janaki Raman 
with their heads bowed and hands joined in prayer. The fact is 
that if our Reserve Bank and the finance ministry had been 
alert, no one would have dared to break the laws and loot money. 
We do not know what special attraction was there for them to 
ignore established interest rates in the public sector and 
invest money in absurd places? And we do not know which one was 
sucking out billions of rupees each minute. The committee has 
given detailed information on how this scam was pulled, and who 
were the people who had their eyes closed to it when all this 
was happening. However, this report is silent about who 
benefitted from this scam and who were the real villains of this 
drama. Yes, they have identified four foreign banks and have 
recommended canceling their licenses. We should not, however, do 
things hastily. The present atmosphere in the nation and the 
image that our country has abroad can be hurt by any extreme 
action. What is necessary is that we keep a close eye on all 
banks, and not just these banks. 
  The whole system was rotten, and one or two sharp people 
were 
influencing the investigation. It is proved by the mention of 
the CBI and other agencies in the report. These agencies, 
despite enough evidence against Harshad Mehta and others, did 
not register any case, and if they did start a case, the speed 
of investigation was kept very slow. There was no cooperation 
among these investigation agencies. Not only this, the personnel 
from these agencies who were invited by the joint committee, did 
not give full information. The committee has asked that cases be 
registered against the nationalized bank officials who were 
involved in the Pratibhuti scam. The recommendation made to 
investigate Gold Star Company and some public sector 
institutions should be followed up diligently so that the trust 
of the people is not broken. The report has also condemned 
provision of shares from the promotor quota to 531 government 
and banks officials. The tradition of bribing government 
employees needs to be curbed. 
  Members of all political parties were included in the joint 
parliamentary commission, therefore, we should accept this 
report to be above all bias and have full debate on it in the 
House even if the session has to be extended by two or three 
days. The committee has presented the report after 16 months of 
very hard work and Ram Niwas Mirdha has included the letter 
which were not unanimous in this report, therefore, we have to 
believe that the committee has done a historical job by rising 
above prejudices. This work should be given proper respect and 
the guilty persons should be punished without delay. At the same 
time, we must make sure that no one damages our financial system 
again and embarrassing incidents like the Pratibhuti scams are 
not repeated. The country waited for a long time for the joint 
parliamentary committee's report. Now we wait for action on 
it.

<F P=106> [Article: "69 Percent Reservation Recommended in Tamil Nadu"] </F>
  [Text] Madras, 19 December (NBT)--The issue of providing 69 
percent reservation for the backward groups in government 
offices and educational institutions is becoming very 
complicated. 
  A meeting of the Tamil Nadu vidhan sabha members has been 
called for 30 December 1993 to discuss continuation of the 
present legislation. However, K. Ramamurthy, the state Congress 
Committee president, has expressed doubt over the government's 
intentions while referring to the Constitution's article 31 (B) 
or 31 (C). 
  It is not clear yet which of these articles does the state 
government want to implement when continuing the present 
reservation system. It should be remembered that the Supreme 
Court had decided on the Mandal Commission that reservations 
cannot exceed 50 percent in any case. The state government is 
forced to go through this constitutional exercise because of 
this decision. 
  Chief Minister Jayalalitha had called a meeting of all the 
political parties on 26 November and had discussed following the 
Supreme Court's decision. At the same time, they supported 
keeping the state's 69 percent reservation quota. 
  As the result of this all, the government is using these two 
articles as an alternative, and has obtained the president's 
approval so that the Center does not block the effort to make 
the present reservation system constitutional.

  [Text] Madras, Nov. 24--The designated court conducting 
trial in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case today dismissed the 
discharge petitions of all the 26 accused in the case and held 
that prima facie case has been made out against them. 
  Passing orders today after the five-month-long pre-trial 
proceedings about the involvement of the LTTE and the 26 accused 
in the assassination, the judge, Mr. S.M. Siddickk, said that 
after going through the materials submitted by the Special 
Investigation (SIT) he was satisfied that sufficient grounds 
existed to proceed against the accused. The court also framed 
charges against the accused. 
  All the accused, barring Murugan and three others, heard the 
charges with rapt attention as the Bench clerk read the charges 
against each of the accused. While all of them pleaded not 
guilty, Shanti, wife of another accused, Jayakumar, said she did 
not follow the charges against her. When the clerk repeated the 
charges she also pleaded not guilty and said there was no 
connection between the assassination and her. "I am being kept 
in the prison without any justification," she told the judge. 
  The 250-odd charges framed by the court broadly confirmed to 
the charges listed by the prosecution in the chargesheet. 
  In the 62-page order Mr. Siddickk held that "under the law, 
charges can be framed even on "strong suspicion" and here in 
this case there is "overwhelming material of very determinative 
character clearly indicating the offence complained against the 
accused." 
  Applicability of TADA: The judge, while framing 
charges, also answered all the legal questions that figured in 
the lengthy arguments between the prosecution and the defence 
lawyers. They included applicability of the TADA to the case, 
validity of confessional statements, splitting of the case 
between those arrested and absconding, the CBI's legal standing 
in investigating the case and appointment of the Jain Commission. 
  The framing of the charges by the court might not 
immediately 
lead to the commencement of the trial as the defence lawyer, Mr. 
S. Doraisamy, informed the reporters at the court that he would 
soon go on appeal to the Madras High Court. He said that though 
the TADA stipulated that only the Supreme Court was authorised 
to take up appeals, he would request the Madras High Court to 
invoke special powers to take up the case. The trial might 
resume only after the disposal of the appeals by the High Court. 
  In his orders, Mr. Siddickk dismissed the defence arguments 
that the TADA was not applicable to the case as the offences 
alleged to have been committed were only against the individuals 
for personal reasons and not against the Government. 
  'Common intention': He also dismissed as factually 
and legally unsustainable, Mr. Doraisamy's argument that there 
was no evidence to suggest that key accused, Nalini, and others 
had any knowledge of the conspiracy or at any point of time they 
had agreed to participate in the conspiracy. "Common intention" 
was a rule of evidence and the charge under that Section could 
always be framed if the fact and circumstances warrant that, he 
said. 
  On Mr. Doraisamy's argument that the LTTE's intelligence 
chief, Pottu Amman, and women's wing leader, Akhila, were 
non-existing members, and therefore, there could not be any 
conspiracy between the accused and non-existing persons, the 
judge said that it was "frivolous and unwarranted" in view of 
the materials placed before the court along with the charge 
sheet and it did not merit any consideration. 
  The judge also dismissed the defence plea that the alleged 
conspiracy by the LTTE was only to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi and 
there was no conspiracy to kill other persons. If anyone had 
died it was only incidental or accidental and not in pursuance 
of the conspiracy, the defence argued. Sixteen persons, 
including Rajiv Gandhi, died in the Sriperumbudur blast on May 
21, 1991. Seventeen persons received grievous injuries and 27 
simple injuries. 
  On defence counsel's argument that the CBI had no locus 
standi to investigate the assassination case as the Centre 
did not notify in the G.O. that CBI could take up TADA cases, 
when the Act came into force in 1987, the judge said the Madras 
High Court already dismissed this argument in 1992 and held that 
the CBI was empowered to investigate cases under the TADA. 
  Therefore, it was futile to conclude that the CBI had no 
statutory power to investigate the Rajiv Gandhi case. 
  Jain panel findings 'not binding': The court held 
that the observations and findings of the Jain Commission are 
not binding on the trial court proceedings. 
  Mr. S.M. Siddick, said, "The Jain Commission could not do 
what the regular criminal court was already doing or might do in 
due course."--PTI

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 1--The Centre for Development of 
Telematics (C-DoT) has achieved a milestone by developing VSAT 
(very small aperture terminals), a two-way satellite earth 
station for providing connectivity without the encumberance of 
telephone wires. 
  With the release of this technology, India will have an 
indigenous capability for supporting transmission systems for 
voice and data communications to supplement telecom networks. 
  The VSAT technology is being released to indigenous 
manufacturers who are already producing C-DoT products. 
  Significantly, the C-DoT's breakthrough has come at a time 
when the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is about to 
forego its monopoly on running VSAT services. The service, so 
far called the remote area business messaging network (RABMN), 
has aimed at providing data communication facility to 
subscribers scattered throughout the country by using satellite 
in VSATs provided at the subscribers' premises. In addition to 
Hughes Network Systems, three other private sector operators 
have been shortlisted. This is expected to bring about a boom in 
sale of VSAT dishes. 
  The C-DoT-developed VSAT operate in the C-band frequency of 
satellites for data and voice communication at 64 kilo bit per 
second (kbps). The shortlisted private sector operators have 
been asked to operate on extended C-band frequency of the 
INSAT-2A satellite. 
  To begin with, the Department of Science and Technology is 
going to use VSAT for linking various nodes in their network to 
transmit weather data to the central supercomputer installed in 
Delhi for inward and outward transmission to various centres.

  [Text] New Delhi, 28 Nov (TINS)--The chief of air staff, 
Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul, has emphasised that China posed a 
primary strategic challenge to India in the long term, 
notwithstanding the recently-signed LAC [expansion not given] 
agreement. 
  Stressing the need to develop a sound strategy to meet this 
"formidable challenge," the air chief observed that China had 
emerged as the most powerful military nation which with its high 
rate of economic growth and sustained military programme had 
drastically altered the military balance in Asia. 
  "India is thus placed with two contrasting security 
dilemmas. 
On the one hand, the probability of an armed conflict with China 
has been reduced in the short term, but in the long term, by 
2005, the threat (from China) will be of a different magnitude 
altogether," he said. 
  Delivering his valedictory address at the end of the two-day 
seminar on "Challenges to India's national interest in 1995-2010 
and Indian response" organised by the United Services Institute, 
Air Chief Marshal Kaul reflected on the double standards of the 
U.S. foreign policy, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 
unabated low-cost proxy war by Pakistan, the grim internal 
security situation and the poor quality of the Indian polity. He 
pointed out how all these factors had a dangerous bearing on 
India's future national security interests. 
  The air chief strongly advocated India's need for enhancing 
its conventional military capabilities, while simultaneously 
initiating confidence-building measures with countries in the 
neighbourhood to ensure regional stability. 
  Reflecting on recent American efforts to revoke the Pressler 
amendment on Pakistan, the air chief warned that the fall-out in 
this eventuality would add to the security complications. 
"Therefore, as an overall threat perspective, I visualise 
Pakistan as a potent threat in the short term and China as a 
potential strategic challenge in the long term", he said. 
  Criticising Pakistan for continuing to exercise the low-cost 
option of instigating militancy and separatism in Kashmir and 
Punjab, he observed that since partition Pakistan had been 
following a single track foreign policy of forcing Kashmir's 
secession from India. 
  "The prospect of stability and tension-free relations with 
Pakistan is not in sight. Since Independence, Pakistan has 
tasted democracy for only a few years and hence, its political 
framework still remain fragile. Besides, pressures from the 
military junta and Islamic fundamentalists mixed with a strong 
perception of its own insecurity has crystalised into adoption 
of a nuclear weapons programme and a foreign policy inimical to 
our interests," he said. 
  Accusing the U.S. of hijacking the United Nations, Air Chief 
Marshal Kaul said that after the Gulf war, the U.N. was being 
used by the U.S. more as an extension to serve its foreign 
policy interests. India has been subjected to pressures such as 
NPT, MTCR, GATT, NAFTA and Super 301, and pointed to the recent 
trend of "coercive diplomacy in the garb of human rights issues" 
with a frequent temptation by the west to wield the human rights 
stick to settle foreign policy issues. 
  Pointing to contradictions in this policy, the air chief 
said: "The U.S., the so-called champions of human rights, has 
admonished China for human rights abuses but still continues to 
finalise business deals and extend military co-operation to 
China," he said. He regretted that in recent times India's 
capabilities in international fora has been somewhat eroded due 
to lack of diplomatic support from Russia which is evident from 
its policy on cryogenic engines, NPT and even Kashmir. 
  Stressing the need to set the Indian polity in order, the 
air 
chief said India needed to be politically cohesive and 
internally strong. Founders of the constitution had evidently 
presupposed that our polity would be educated and have basic 
civic sensibilities. "However, our political system has not been 
able to meet the aspirations of our people. Today, we see more 
sectarian, partisan and motivated behaviour with dangers of 
communalism and fundamentalism causing tremendous strains on the 
chosen secular fabric of our country," he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Indian Mission to Mercury Likely </F>
by 2000" 
  [Text] Bangalore, 25 Nov (UNI)--India could 
conceive an interplanetary mission to Mercury, by the turn of 
the century, using the Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle (GSLV). 
  Delivering the presidential address at the physical sciences 
section of the 63rd annual session of the National Academy of 
Sciences here on Wednesday, Dr K. Kasturirangan, Director of the 
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) satellite centre here, 
said studies exploring the possibility of such a mission carried 
out by ISRO were quite encouraging and the mission appeared 
feasible. 
  The study was carried out in the wake of the recent advances 
made in the realisation of a geosynchronous launch capability. 
  He, however, said a time schedule for such a mission had not 
been fixed as yet. 
  Dr Kasturirangan said the GSLV could be used for a mission 
to 
launch a spacecraft to Mercury, either as a fly-by or as an 
orbiter to the planet using the gravity-assist trajectories of 
the planetary probe due to Venus and Mercury itself. 
  He said ISRO has also framed the objectives and profile of 
an 
Indian planetary mission to Venus and Mercury. 
  The GSLV would launch the spacecraft first into a 300 km 
orbit and later boosted to a heliocentric orbit. The spacecraft 
would be designed to provide three axis stabilisation using the 
sun for pitch and yaw control and a star as a roll reference. 
  In situ particle detectors, plasma probes and 
magnetometer onboard the orbiter could provide vital information 
on solar wind and associated phenomena. 
  A fly-by mission of Venus and Mercury would provide some 
opportunity to have a short glimpse of these planets. The 
mercury orbiter could carry a number of instruments for imaging 
the surface and for remote measurements of the surface 
parameters and environment of the planet. 
  Dr Kasturirangan said the instruments in such an orbiter 
could include ultra violet spectrometer for determining 
elemental composition of rare and other gases and throw light on 
the sodium enigma of Mercury, plasma analyser to measure solar 
wind particles in the transitional atmosphere of the planet, 
imaging with television cameras at a high resolution of 50 to 
100 metres in different visible and infrared bands, gamma ray, 
x-ray and infrared spectroscopy to study the composition of the 
surface material of the planet. 
  He said India could also go in for a multi-wavelength space 
observatory that could be launched by the Polar Satellite Launch 
Vehicle (PSLV) to a low earth inclined orbit. A space astronomy 
mission capitalising on simultaneous multiple wavelength 
observations of celestial "flash" transient phenomena.

<H5>  Note: </H5>
  Considering that the law is not retroactive, and because the 
law concerns the future, and noting that this law is to be 
implemented from today, 17/09/1372 [8 December 1993], in order 
to facilitate referring to the law governing the case, while 
amending the number of articles and replacing the amended 
articles, the previous articles and related unified processes 
are provided at the bottom of the page in order to eliminate the 
need to refer to various volumes. It is hoped that this small 
service will be useful. 
  Legal Council of ABRAR 
  Article 1 
  Article 1. Various types of checks are: 
  1) A normal check is a check issued by an individual on a 
personal bank account, and the holder has no guarantee other 
than the credit of the person who has issued it. 
  2) A verified check is a check issued by an individual on a 
personal current account in the bank, and the bank verifies the 
payment of the funds. 
  3) A certified check is a check that the bank issues upon 
the 
request of a customer, and its payment is guaranteed by the bank. 
  4) A traveler's check is a check that is issued by a bank 
and 
is payable by the branches of that bank or an agency of that 
bank. 
  Article 2. Checks issued on banks that have been or will be 
established in Iran in accordance with Iranian laws and also 
their branches abroad are considered obligatory documents, and 
if the holder of the check goes to the bank and does not receive 
the total or a part of the funds due to lack of funds or for any 
other reason that causes the check to be returned and not paid, 
he can collect the total amount or the remainder from the issuer 
in accordance with the laws and regulations concerning the 
implementation of official documents. 
  For the issuance of an indictment, the holder of the check 
must submit the original check and certificate cited in Article 
3 or certificate cited in Article 4 to the local Document 
Records Executive Office. 
  The Documents Records Executive Office shall issue an order 
for implementation if the signature on the check and that of the 
issuer are verified to be the same by the bank. 
  The holder of the check includes the person to whom the 
check 
has been issued, the person in whose name the check has been 
endorsed, and the person holding the check (in regards to the 
checks issued to cash) or their legal representative. 
  Article 3. The issuer of the check must on the day of issue 
have the equivalent funds in the bank (in cash or usable credit) 
and must not remove all or any portion of the funds for which he 
has issued a check in some way from the bank or instruct the 
check not to be paid. Also, he must not issue the check in such 
a way that the bank refuses to honor it due to the signature not 
matching, crossed out items on the check, or a discrepancy in 
the contents of the check, and the like. 
  If a condition is made for the payment of the check, the 
bank 
shall disregard such a condition. 
  Article 4. Whenever the funds for a check are not paid, for 
any reason cited in Article 2, the bank is responsible to state 
clearly on a special form on which the specific information 
concerning the check and the identity and full address of the 
issuer is mentioned the reason for not paying, to sign and seal 
it, and to give it to the holder of the check. 
  That sheet must contain the verified signature of the issuer 
with the sample of the existing signature in the bank (within 
the normal banking limitations). 
  The bank shall be responsible for informing the issuer of 
the 
check by immediately sending the second copy of this sheet to 
the last address of the owner of that account that exists in the 
bank. 
  That sheet must contain the first and last name and the full 
address of the holder of the check. 
  Article 5. If the funds in the account of the issuer of the 
check in the bank are less than the amount of the check, upon 
the request of the holder of the check, the bank is obliged to 
pay the available amount in the account to the holder of the 
check, and the holder of the check, by writing the amount 
received on the back of the check and submitting it to the bank, 
shall receive a certificate including the specifications of the 
check and the paid amount from the bank. The above-mentioned 
check will be considered insufficient funds for the amount that 
has not been paid, and the bank certificate in this case shall 
be for the holder of the check a substitute for the original 
check. 
  In regards to this article also, the bank is obliged to send 
the announcement stated in the previous article to the owner of 
the account. 
  Article 6. Banks are obliged to print the first and last 
name 
of the owner of the account on every check. 
  Article 7. Anyone who commits a violation stated in Article 
3 
shall be sentenced to prison from six months to two years and, 
according to the case, the payment of a cash fine equivalent to 
one-fourth of the insufficient funds at the time that the check 
was submitted to the bank. 
  Article 8. Checks that in Iran are issued on banks abroad 
and 
result in affidavits of insufficient funds shall be in penal 
terms subject to the regulations of this law. 
  Article 9. If the issuer of the check pays the amount of the 
check in cash before the date of complaint to the holder, or 
upon the agreement of the private complainer an arrangement is 
made for its payment or he makes arrangements in the bank for it 
to be paid, he cannot be prosecuted. 
  In the latter case, the above-mentioned bank is obliged to 
block up to the amount of the check in the account of the issuer 
and pay it to the holder of the check as soon as he comes in and 
submits the check. 
  Article 10. Anyone who issues a check with the knowledge 
that 
his account is closed, shall be regarded as having issued a bad 
check and shall be sentenced to the maximum punishment stated in 
Article 7, and the set punishment shall not be postponed. 
  Article 11. Offenses stated in this law cannot be prosecuted 
without the complaint of the holder of the check, and if the 
holder of the check does not go to the bank within six months 
after the date on which the check has been issued to collect the 
funds from the bank or does not make a complaint within six 
months after the issuance of the certificate of insufficient 
funds, he shall no longer have the right to a legal complaint. 
  What is meant by the holder of the check in this article is 
the person who submits the check for the first time to the bank. 
To determine who has for the first time gone to the bank to 
collect the funds for the check, banks are obliged to write the 
full and precise identity of the holder with the date on the 
back of the check as soon as he goes to the bank. 
  A person to whom the check is transferred after it has 
returned from the bank shall not have the right to a legal 
complaint unless the transfer was obligatory.[.sup]1.[/] 
  If the holder of the check wants to collect the check 
through 
another person as his representative and preserve the right to a 
legal complaint, and if there are insufficient funds, he must 
write his name and address and explain that the person is his 
representative on the back of the check. In this case, the bank 
shall issue the announcement in Articles 3 and 4 in the name of 
the owner of the check, and his right to a legal complaint shall 
be preserved. 
  Note. Whenever after a legal complaint the complainant 
transfers the check to another person or transfers his rights to 
the check in another manner, legal prosecution shall cease. 
  Article 12. Whenever, prior to the issuance of the final 
ruling, the plaintiff withdraws his complaint or the accused 
person pays the amount of the check and late payment in cash to 
the holder of the check or arranges for the payment of the check 
and above-mentioned damages (12 percent annually from the date 
that the check is submitted to the bank) or deposits it in the 
Justice Department Fund or Records Executive Office, the 
investigative authority shall issue instructions to stop the 
prosecution. 
  The issuance of the stopping of prosecution in the penal 
court shall not prevent the court from examining and issuing a 
ruling regarding other damages demanded. 
  Whenever, after the issuance of the final ruling, the 
complainant withdraws his complaint or the convicted person in 
the above-mentioned ways pays the funds for the check, late 
payment damages, and other damages stated in the ruling, the 
implementation of the ruling shall stop and the convicted person 
will only be obliged to pay an amount equivalent to one-third of 
the cash fine stated in the ruling, which shall be collected for 
the government upon the order of the prosecutor. 
  Article 13. Issuance of a check as guaranteed, or providing 
funds for conditional, dated, or blank with a signature are 
prohibited. If the other party makes a complaint and the funds 
are not paid, the issuer shall be sentenced to a jail term of 
six months to two years in addition to a cash fine of 100,000 
rials[Rls] to Rls10 million. 
  Article 14. The issuer of the check or his legal 
representative, by stating explicitly that the check has been 
lost, stolen or forged or obtained through deception or 
violation of trust or other such crime, can instruct the bank in 
writing not to pay the funds designated in the check. After 
verifying the identity of the person making the request, the 
bank shall refuse to pay the funds, and if the check is 
presented to the bank, it shall issue and submit a certificate 
of nonpayment with the reason stated on it. 
  The holder of the check may make a complaint against the 
person who has issued instructions for nonpayment, and if the 
claim that has resulted in nonpayment is proven, in addition to 
the punishment stated in Article 7 of this law, he shall be 
condemned to pay all the damages to the holder of the check. 
  Note 1. The interested party in this article is the person 
in 
whose name the check is issued or endorsed or to whom the check 
has been transferred (or to whom the check made out to cash has 
been transferred). 
  In a case when the interested party instructs nonpayment, 
the 
bank is obliged to keep the amount of the check in a blocked 
account until the examining authority has made a decision or the 
person who has requested it changes his mind. 
  Note 2. The person issuing the instructions is obliged to 
submit his complaint to the judicial authorities after 
announcing it to the bank and submitting a certificate of his 
complaint to the bank within a maximum period of one week, 
otherwise, after the period has ended, the bank shall pay the 
funds for the check upon the request of the holder from the 
available funds. 
  Article 15. The holder of the check can demand the amount of 
the check and his losses in the penal court that examines the 
case. 
  Article 16. Examination of all penal and legal complaints 
and 
disputes concerning checks in the Prosecutor's Office and the 
court, up to the completion of adjudication, shall be immediate 
and shall takes precedence over other cases. 
  Article 17. The existence of a check in the hands of the 
issuer is proof that its funds have been paid and the 
complainant has withdrawn his complaint, unless the contrary is 
proven. 
  Article 18. If the funds for the check are not provided in 
the bank, the examining authority is obliged to obtain from the 
accused a cash bond or bank security (which is valid until the 
final decision). If the issuers of the check are more than one 
person, the prosecuting authority may divide the amount of the 
bond or bank security in ratio to the responsibility of each, 
and if that is not clear, equally among all of them. 
  If one of the accused has paid the equivalent of the total 
amount of the check in bonds or bank security, appropriate 
security will be obtained from the other accused persons. 
  In the instances stated in Article 14 also, according to the 
case, if the funds for the check are not provided in the bank, 
as long as no justifiable evidence and proof of the claim of the 
issuer of the check or the beneficiary is available, the 
examining authority shall collect the above-mentioned security. 
  Also, if the accused requests time to pay the funds for the 
check, the examining authority may, if he finds it appropriate, 
grant him up to one month by receiving another appropriate 
security. 
  In this case, if the accused does not pay the funds for the 
check within the set period, the above-mentioned security will 
be converted to bonds. 
  Note. If the bond or banking security mentioned in this 
article is deposited, the security required from the property of 
the accused is not permissible. In this case, the losses of the 
private claimant shall be paid from the bond or the bank 
security. 
  Article 19. If the check has been issued on behalf of the 
owner of the account, whether an actual or legal person, the 
issuer of the check and the owner of the account shall both be 
responsible for the payment of the check, and the executive 
order and the ruling on the losses shall be issued on the basis 
of the responsibility of both. In addition, the signatory of the 
check, according to the regulations of this law, has the legal 
responsibility unless he proves that failure to pay is evidenced 
by the action of the owner of the account or his next 
representative, in which case the person who has caused the 
failure to pay shall be legally responsible. 
  Article 20. The civil responsibility of the endorser of a 
check shall continue on the basis of laws and regulations. 
  Article 21. Banks are responsible for closing all current 
accounts of individuals who have issued bad checks more than 
once and whose prosecution has resulted in the issuance of a 
bill of indictment and to refuse to open another current account 
for them for three more years. 
  The responsible member of the branch of any bank that does 
not act in accordance with the above-mentioned duty, according 
to each case, considering the circumstances, resources, number 
of times, and the offense, shall be sentenced to one of the 
punishments stated in Article 9 of the law of investigation of 
administrative violations by the Administrative Violations 
Investigation Committee. 
  Note 1. The Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
responsible for keeping a record of individuals who have issued 
bad checks regularly and place the list of the names of these 
persons at the disposal of all the banks in the country for the 
implementation of this law. 
  Note 2. The rules and regulations concerning the denial of 
the right of individuals to open a current account and the 
procedures to respond to the announcements of the banks shall be 
on the basis of bylaws that will be prepared within a period of 
three months by the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic and 
ratified by the Cabinet. 
  Article 22. If the accused is not accessible, the last 
address of the accused in the bank shall be considered his last 
legal residence and any sort of notification shall be sent to 
that address, unless the accused, in the manner stated in the 
penal adjudication regulations, has given another address. 
  Whenever the accused is not identified with the banking 
address or the address he has given or such a location does not 
exist, the verification of the official shall be regarded as 
notice of papers, and investigation shall continue without the 
necessity of summoning the accused through the press. 
  Article 22 of the law of issuance of checks ratified in 
Khordad 1344 [22 May-21 June 1965] is hereby nullified.

representation does not need to be explicated. 
  Article 13 read as follows prior to amendment: 
  Article 12. In the following cases, the issuer of the check 
cannot be prosecuted on the basis of the law: 
  1) If it is proved that he has given a signed blank check. 
  2) Whenever there is a condition stated in the text of the 
check for the collection of its funds. 
  3) Whenever it is stated in the check that the check is a

  5) If it is proved that the check was issued without a date 
or the actual date of the issuance of the check is prior to the

their legal representatives instruct the bank in writing not to 
pay the funds of the check by stating clearly that the check has

identity of the person who has so instructed, the bank shall 
refuse to pay the funds, and if the check is presented to the 
bank, the bank shall issue and submit a certificate of 
nonpayment stating the reason. 
  The holder of the check may make a complaint against the 
person who has instructed the bank not to pay, and if the claim 
that has resulted in nonpayment is proved to be false, the 
person who has given instructions in addition to the punishment 
stated in Article 6 of this law shall be condemned to pay 
one-fourth of the amount of the check in psychological damages 
to the plaintiff and also damages for late payment (if asked) at 
12 percent annually from the date of the presentation of the 
check to the bank. 
  Note. The interested party in this article is the person in 
whose name the check has been issued or endorsed or to whom the 
check has been transferred (or to whom the check is made out to 
cash and transferred). 
  Should the interested party instruct the bank not to pay, 
the 
bank is obliged to keep the amount of the check in a blocked 
account until a decision has been made by the examination 
authority or the instructor changes his mind. 
  Article 18 was as follows prior to amendment: 
  Article 17. If the funds of the check have not been secured 
legally, the examining authority is obliged to obtain a cash 
bond or bank security (which is valid until a decision is made) 
equivalent to the amount of the check or the portion for which 
complaint is made from the accused. If the issuers of the check 
are more than one person, the prosecuting authority may divide 
the amount of the bond or the banking security in proportion to 
each person's obligation, and if it is not known, equally among 
them. 
  If one of the accused persons has given the total amount of 
the check in bonds or banking security, appropriate security 
will be obtained from the other defendants. 
  In the instances stated in Articles 12 and 13, as long as 
the 
justified evidence and reason to prove the claim of the issuer 
of the check has not been obtained, the investigating authority 
shall collect the above-mentioned security. 
  Also, if the defendant asks for time to pay the funds in the 
check, the examining authority, if appropriate, may grant 
another month to him by obtaining other appropriate security. In 
this case, if the defendant does not pay the amount of the check 
within the period stated, the above-mentioned security shall be 
converted to bonds. 
  Note 1. If the bond or security stated in this article has 
been deposited, the security demanded on the property of the 
defendant is not permissible. In this case, the losses and 
damages of the private claimant must be paid from the bond or 
security funds. 
  Note 2. The examining authority is responsible to state the 
specifications of the check and the identity of the claimant on 
the summons, and the period between the date of notification of 
the summons and the stated date for the defendant to appear must 
not be less than five days. If the defendant takes steps prior 
to that date, as stated in Article 8, legal prosecution will 
stop. 
  Article 21 read as follows prior to the amendment: 
  Article 20. Banks are responsible for closing all the 
current 
accounts of persons who in three years have issued more than one 
bad check and whose prosecution has resulted in the issuance of 
a bill of indictment and to not open another checking account in 
their name for five years. 
  Any bank that fails to carry out the above responsibility 
shall be condemned to the regulatory punishment stated in 
Article 44 of the monetary and banking law of the country. 
  Prosecutor's offices also are responsible for informing the 
Central Bank of the issuance of the bill of indictment, and the 
above-mentioned bank is responsible for announcing in a circular 
letter to all banks the personal data of those whose accounts 
must be closed on the basis of this law and for whom no current 
account must be opened. 
  If the defendant is acquitted in accordance with the final 
ruling of the court, the prosecutor's office, upon his request, 
shall inform the Central Bank about it in order for the Central 
Bank to issue a circular letter to other banks stating that he

<F P=106> [Article by S. Sethuram: "Will India Gain From GATT?"] </F>
  [Text] At last, a new world trading system is emerging from 
the tortuous negotiations spread over seven years which could 
have been short-circuited had a deal on farm subsidies been 
struck by USA and the European Community at the ministerial 
meeting in December 1990. 
  That collapse was followed by the comprehensive Draft Final 
Act (DFA) popularly known as "Dunkel Draft" to which India had 
been the bitterest opponent among developing countries. 
  The positive conclusion of the Uruguay Round on December 15 
is undoubtedly a major milestone for the global which now enters 
an era of greater and fierce competition for markets by both 
developed and developing countries. 
  Most of the world barring former Soviet Union and China, 
which are yet to be formally admitted to GATT will be bound by 
the new rules and disciplines governing international trade. 
  Who will gain more and who will lose out in the bargain will 
depend more on each country's outward-orientation, its 
productive efficiency, and competitive strength. To the extent 
that India measures up to these standards, it should stand to 
benefit, if not in the short-run, at least over the longer term. 
  India had from the beginning taken a clearcut stand that its 
hopes are bound up with only a multilateral trading system with 
transparent rules and non-discriminatory treatment. 
  This does not mean that protectionist barriers raised over 
the last decade by the major industrialised nations are going to 
be instantly lowered. Nor would the global accord in any way 
diminish the ardour of nations seeking regional fortresses. For 
India, which is not in any of the trading blocs, the single 
market of Europe or NAFTA, which comes into existence on January 
1, 1994, multilateralism provides the best insurance against 
marginalisation, especially given its already low share of world 
exports at around 0.60 per cent. 
  Developing countries could have got a better deal in the 
Uruguay Round had there been effective coordination among 
themselves through the long period of negotiations. The 
South-South cooperation was not brought into sharp focus while 
it has been ritualistically emphasised at meetings of G-15 or 
other forums of developing countries. 
  India's main concerns with the Dunkel Draft were in respect 
of intellectual property protection, textiles, agriculture and 
services. It become difficult to get any revision of the Dunkel 
text in regard to Trade-Related Intellectual Property Right 
(TRIPS) when all developed nations as well as a large number of 
development countries themselves had gone with the kind of 
intellectual property protection regime provided for. Of course, 
there is a ten-year transition period before India would have to 
fall in line with the new regime. 
  In textiles, developing countries seem by and large 
satisfied 
with the phasing out of the multifibre agreement though the 
maximum liberalisation would materialise only in the latter half 
of the ten-year period from January 1, 1995. 
  India has been assured by its major trading partners and 
GATT 
Director General Peter Sutherland that the Dunkel Draft would 
not affect present level of subsidies to agriculture or the food 
security system through public distribution or use of seeds by 
farmers. In services, it is not clear whether India's interests 
(labour migration) have been embodied in the final document. 
  Overall from India's point of view the outcome of the 
Uruguay 
Round should be regarded more positive than negative. Until 
India becomes internationally competitive, there is the risk of 
its market being more open and being flooded with cheaper 
imports. The only safeguard against this would be an effective 
anti-dumping legislation. Also India is entitled to retain some 
non-tariff barriers so long as its balance of payments situation 
continues to remain difficult. 
  While the East Asian economies owe their dramatic success to 
exports of manufactures--an area where India could do equally 
well now that the economy has been liberated to a considerable 
extent--India can also become a significant exporter of 
agricultural commodities without domestic injury as the country 
is capable of producing surpluses, especially in superior 
varieties of rice and commercial crops. 
  The Uruguay Round had largely been played out as a big power 
game and the developing countries, more than 45 of which had 
started reforming their economies were watching helplessly. They 
fell so frustrated that any deal would have been welcome for 
them. It is in this situation that India could achieve little in 
what started as the most ambitious and comprehensive trade 
negotiations in 1986. 
  A strengthening GATT with safeguards mechanism and trade 
dispute settlement machinery can be expected to monitor the 
observance of the new rules and disciplines more effectively.

<F P=106> [News Report: "Both Houses in an Uproar Over Dunkel"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, 16 December--For the second day in a row, 
there was uproar in both houses over the Dunkel signing, and the 
Lok Sabha activities were stopped first until noon and then 
until 1400. The Rajya Sabha activities were postponed until 1430. 
  The opposition members of both houses gathered around the 
seats of the majority members to show their opposition to 
signing the Dunkel proposals and demanding that the prime 
minister come to the House to clarify the situation related to 
Dunkel. In the Rajya Sabha, after the morning noise, the 
question-answer period began, however, nothing was achieved in 
the Lok Sabha. The opposition members accused the government of 
insulting the Parliament by signing the agreement without taking 
them into confidence. 
  The opposition disrupted the questions session in the Lok 
Sabha by making noise and raising slogans. After 20 minutes of 
pandemonium, Vice Chairperson Mallika Arjunaiya postponed the 
House activities until noon. As soon as the meeting began, the 
opposition members demanded that the prime minister should 
attend the meeting. They raised slogans in support of their 
demand and gathered around the chairperson's seat. 
  Jaswant Singh was the only BJP member present in the House. 
The members said that the government had sold out the nation by 
signing this agreement. The statement of Mukul Vasnik, minister 
of state for parliamentary affairs, that the Commerce Minister 
Pranab Mukherji was ready to clarify the whole situation in the 
House did calm the opposition members. 
  However, the opposition members continued to demand that Mr. 
Rao must make a statement. Mr. Vasnik said that making all this 
noise will not help anyone. The opposition leaders continued to 
raise slogans such as "revoke the Dunkel agreement" and "stop 
selling out the nation." Later, the slogans asking for 
resignation by Narasimha Rao also echoed in the House. 
  These members standing in front of the chairperson's seat 
were saying that the Dunkel agreement was an agreement to accept 
economic slavery. The government, they said, had made agreement 
against the nation's economic interests, and this government 
does not deserve to stay in power. 
  The vice chairperson repeatedly said that the commerce 
minister was ready to make a statement during the questions 
period. He said that the prime minister could not come to the 
House for some reason, however, the opposition members were 
adamant about the prime minister's attendance. 
  Mr. Vasnik, the parliamentary affairs state minister, said 
that it was the opposition that had asked the commerce minister 
to make a statement, and now it is refusing to hear him. He 
asked the vice chairperson to set a time for the statement. 
Janata Dal's George Fernandes said that India by signing this 
agreement had become a U.S. colony. He wanted to know what the 
Parliament was for now. 
  Mr. Pranab Mukherji had some discussion with the vice 
chairperson during that time. Somnath Chaterji of the CPI (M) 
said that the whole nation and the House was angered by the 
government's action.

<F P=106> [News Report: "Dunkel to Help Increase India's Share in </F>
International Trade"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 16 December--The government clarified in 
the Lok Sabha today that India's share in international trade 
will increase with Dunkel proposals, and it will not affect the 
public distribution system in the country. The opposition 
members who had been angrily protesting Dunkel since yesterday 
agreed to listen to Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji on 
condition that this issue will be discussed in the House with 
the prime minister present there. 
  Mr. Pranab Mukherji said that the government had concluded 
after a lot of thinking that India will benefit more by the 
Uruguay agreement that will increase international trade. He 
said that India's export may increase by $1.5-$2 billion. 
  Mr. Mukherji informed the House that the Uruguay talks were 
finished the night before. At the same time, agreement were made 
on intellectual property related to trade in the areas of 
services and products, investment means, and general agreement 
over garments and agricultural products. These will be approved 
by the governments of 117 nations that are taking part in these 
talks. 
  He said that the government had clarified several times in 
the Parliament that India supports multi-party trade which 
profits all the member nations. 
  Mr. Mukherji said that the agreement has made it clear that 
only 10 percent of the total agricultural product can be given 
in agricultural subsidies, and this is more than the present 
subsidies. Mr. Mukherji said that the agreement has also 
clarified that the assistance to the urban and rural poor does 
not come under this system. Thus, our public distribution system 
will continue without any problem. 
  The commerce minister also said that the government will 
provide amble protection to farmers and researchers in the area 
of seeds. He said that the agreement does not call for patenting 
natural genes and genetic process. He made it clear that the 
changes the government is making in patent laws in two years 
will have no such provision. 
  Discussing ways for investment in business, Mr. Mukherji 
said 
that the government has the right to decide what kind of foreign 
investment it should allow in the country. Discussing the 
agreement over cloth trade, he said that we are not satisfied 
with the desire of the importing nations to keep the present 
system for the next 10 years and increasing the import quotas. 
  Mr. Mukherji said some industrialized nations tried to 
change 
the clothes agreement against us during the past phase of the 
talks, however, we successfully defended our stand. These 
countries said that India was taking advantage of the open trade 
arrangement and was competitive in garment trade, but still had 
closed its own market. 
  Mr. Mukherji explained that the permanent committee of the 
commerce ministry had thoroughly discussed the Dunkel draft and 
had recommended that India should try to protect its interests 
in the areas of agriculture and intellectual property, and 
should participate in multi-sided trade structure so that India 
is not left alone. The commerce minister said that instead of 
following another option, our participation in this agreement 
will help us benefit from the international market.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Helpless Alternative"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has said that agreement 
on the Dunkel proposals is the best alternative in the present 
situation. The prime minister has thus admitted that we are 
obliged to accept it. What else can we do? We cannot proceed 
with the process of economic liberalization if we reject the 
agreement. Our share in international trade is only one percent 
and our situation could get worse if we stay out of this 
multi-party international agreement. The permanent committee of 
the commerce ministry had recommended to the government that the 
country should participate in multi-party trade so that it is 
not left alone. The world has divided into many small and large 
trade groups. On one side are the major economic powers like the 
United States and Japan and such powerful groups as the European 
Economic Alliance. On the other side are the developing 
countries like India burdened with foreign debts. A few advanced 
nations are monopolizing international trade. It is their voice 
that is heard on all the economic and trade platforms. Despite 
their majority, the voice of the developing countries is lost 
like that of a "flute in a drum band." Mr. Rao said that our 
government has done what was the best thing to do. According to 
him if India had not opposed some of the Dunkel proposals 
resolutely, the Uruguay decisions would have hurt our nation. 
There is not doubt that India and other developing countries 
have managed to remove some problematic provisions in the Dunkel 
proposals, however, we cannot claim that our efforts to protect 
our interests in the area of agriculture and intellectual assets 
have been successful. Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji has also 
admitted in the Parliament that he was not satisfied with the 
decision of importing nations to keep the same system of garment 
imports at the rate of import quotas for the next 10 years. 
  The nation, especially the opposition parties, are opposing 
the Dunkel proposals. They fear that it will make us lose our 
economic autonomy and our nation will be forced to become a 
slave of the economic powers. They call this agreement contrary 
to the farmers' interests. They claim that the result of the 
farmers' hard work will be devoured by the foreign companies. 
They are also asking while opposing the government that it 
should resign since it cannot protect our national interests and 
should stay out of this agreement. The talks and debates that 
had been going on in our country over the Dunkel proposals for 
the last seven years have made the situation even more complex, 
instead of clarifying it. The government did not try to clarify 
this situation. This made the Dunkel look scary to the nation. 
When the Uruguay talks began in 1986, India had strongly opposed 
intellectual asset rights, use of services, and rules for 
investment, and had asked that these be kept out of the 
proposals. It was neither supported nor approved. India demanded 
that clothes trade be made a part of the agreement, however, 
because of the direct and strong opposition by the United 
States, it was kept out. India has to be satisfied with begging 
for mercy. Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji is correct in 
saying that give and take is required in international 
agreements. However, what did we get in exchange for what we 
gave? All we see are empty promises and serious challenges. This 
naturally augments suspicions and fears. The fact is that our 
nation's economic future has become uncertain instead of 
becoming secure. In the chess game of Uruguay talks, the group 
of industrialized nations have set in and the pawns of 
developing countries like India are being beaten. A year ago, 
there was a fear that a trade war will start among the affluent 
nations. This has gone now and is replaced by the fear that 
exploitation of developing countries will increase. 
  India is an agricultural nation. Its economy is based on 
agricultural production. Therefore, the interests of the farmers 
cannot be neglected at any cost. Commerce Minister Pranab 
Mukherji has tried to assure the Parliament that full attention 
will be given to such important issues as government subsidy to 
the farmers, public distribution system, patenting of seeds, and 
drug prices. The farmers will have the right to store seeds, use 
them again, and barter with each others. Not only this, they 
will have the right to sell their products in any international 
market. The agreement does not have much responsibility for 
naturally developed genes and the patenting the genetic process. 
There are no restrictions on investment policies. Still, Mr. 
Mukherji has not answer to the fear that this agreement will 
affect drug prices. The government says that it will control 
prices by encouraging production of domestic drugs. Whatever 
happens now, since we had no alternative but to accept the 
Dunkel proposals, we should prepare ourselves for the upcoming 
challenges. We can be successful in getting our fair share in 
international trade if we are determined and follow the right 
path. We must start a major campaign on war footing to make our 
economy export oriented. In order to face the unfair situation 
created by the affluent nations, we have to expand bilateral 
cooperation with some nations. At the same time, we must 
strengthen cooperation among the developing nations. All this 
cannot be done at once. We will have to work for a long time to 
attain it, only then can we be successful. Only a stable 
government can do that. Therefore, we must end the efforts to 
create political instability.

<F P=106> [Article by Avinash Alok: "Does Uruguay Round Hold Good for </F>
India?"] 
  [Text] The last phase of Uruguay Round of talks on global 
trade liberalisation has been dominated by the question of 
European farm products' access to the US and other farm 
exporters. It is the same United States which had secured an 
important concession in the post-war years; the granting of a 
waiver that agricultural policy and trade in agricultural goods 
should be exempted from the GATT rules. This was a time when the 
US pursued a policy of extensive subsidies that kept the 
American farm prices high, a policy that led to the generation 
large farm surpluses. 
  India as one of its founder-members is among the 116 which 
are likely to reach an 'agreement' by December 15. What is in 
store for it? It has been estimated by the Organisation for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that a GATT 
agreement could enrich the world by as much as $270 billion by 
the year 2002 AD. 
  Indian economy is apprehensive about most of the 
liberalisation aspects. So, there is no denying that the Indian 
pie out of the amount estimated is likely to be very small and 
the cost of getting that pie also remains unestimated. But, we 
are likely to be one of those signatories whose voices were not 
heeded. 
  The Draft Final Act (DFA) or the Dunkel Draft, as it is 
popularly known, envisages for patents rights to be available to 
both products and processes. At present, the Indian Patents Act 
of 1970 gives patent rights for processes and not for products 
in cases of food, medicines and substances produced through 
chemical processes. Even for the processes of these products, 
the patent period seven years from the date of application or 
five years from the date of sealing of the patent, whichever is 
earlier. The DFA stipulates a minimum of 20 years for every 
process and product. 
  It is feared that the market prices of various medicines, 
which are lowest in India, will go beyond the reach of the poor 
class. In the field of agriculture it means granting of products 
and processes patent to all bio-technological innovations. This 
means that all plants and animals growing outside purely natural 
surroundings can be patented, and further that, even natural 
plant varieties should be protected by a sui generis 
system. This has the potential implication of disallowing Indian 
farmers to keep aside a part of their products for seed. 
<H5>  Right to seeds </H5>
  GATT Director General Peter Sutherland has though put this 
fear to rest. In his recent visit to India, he has said that 
farmers' right to retain a part of their crop as seed in 
subsequent crops would be completely protected, since the DFA 
did not envisage any change. He clarified that even informal 
exchanges of seeds, as exists in the country, could continue. 
But, commercial sale would not be possible. 
  In the area of subsidies of agriculture it has been pointed 
out that the aggregate support measures (subsidies) calculated 
on the basis of norms suggested in the DFA, amounts to either 
negative or negligible for most of the crops cultivated in 
India. The DFA provides for a maximum limit of 10 per cent of 
aggregate subsidies. In this case too, Mr Sutherland has said 
that agricultural subsidy in India would not be affected as 
Indian concern to maintain the food security system was fully 
understood by the contracting parties to the GATT. 
  Textile being one of the most important segments of our 
exports sector is causing more anxiety than anything else. India 
demands higher percentage of integration of the clothing and 
textiles sector in GATT in the beginning of the transition 
period, once the Uruguay Round results are put in place. India 
has termed the present DFA proposal of 10 years transition 
period for integration as a back-loaded one. The demand for a 
front-loaded arrangement received a setback when Mr Bill 
Clinton's administration conceded to its Congressmen from 
textile-producing States, during NAFTA debate, that it will 
demand the 'longest possible phase-out' of an integration of the 
textile and clothing sector into GATT. 
  Trade in services is another area which is being debated. 
The 
DFA proposals require that foreign service enterprises be 
treated at par with the domestic enterprise. But ruling out of 
free cross-border movements of persons, (except some vague 
provisions for temporary migration of skilled labour, hedged by 
requirements of reciprocity) ensures that this benefit goes 
entirely to the development countries. Although services 
contribute more to the national income than industry and 
agriculture in India and are developing fast, it is still at a 
very pre-mature stage vis-a-vis developed countries. 
  The requirements under the Trade Related Investment Measures 
(TRIMS), like waiving of restrictions on multi-national 
companies, stipulate use of a minimum of local content in 
production or impose on them any export obligations which have 
already been done away with. 
  Although, it sounds like succumbing to the masters of the 
unipolar world, one point is noteworthy. The DFA proposals offer 
a much better deal on patents than the countries like South 
Korea, China and Mexico, which went into an agreement with USA 
to avoid trade retaliation under Special 301. China, for 
example, has agreed to provide protection to all the drugs 
patented in the US since 1986. 
  As India will have to bring these into force only in the 
year 
2003 AD, after the 10-year transition period is over, it is 
getting a clear advantage of 17 years. And the fact that the 
Indian bargaining power in the trade is very low, the best which 
can be expected is that some of its demands on patents, textile 
and services are incorporated.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Dunkel Plan: Commotion In The Parliament"] </F>
  [Text] The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and other 
opposition parties raised vehement objections in the parliament 
to the signing of the `Dunkel draft' by the central government. 
There was widespread agitation following this in both the Lok 
Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. In a short period of two hours, the 
Lok Sabha had to postpone proceedings three times, the Rajya 
Sabha, twice. 
  In the Rajya Sabha, the first to raise issue were JD [Janata 
Dal] and the members of the LF [Left Front]. They demanded to 
know if the administration had accepted the Dunkel proposals. 
They demanded that Prime Minister Rao come in person to the 
parliament to explain the government's position. Those present 
from the BJP also supported this demand by JD and LF. It was 
believed that the government had already adopted the draft, and 
the JD members had worn black arm-bands to show opposition to 
this. In the Rajya Sabha, Jaipal Reddy (JD), and Sugumal Sen 
(CPI-M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] raised this issue. 
There were press reports of the cabinet committee appointed to 
investigate financial matters approving the signing of the 
draft, and they demanded to know if this was true. Jaipal Reddy 
equated the signing to the staking of India's sovereignty. As 
this statement led to agitation and disorder in the House, 
Deputy Speaker Najma Heptullah postponed the proceedings. When 
they re-convened, opposition members raised the same issue 
again. They demanded that the government issue a statement on 
this matter, and that the Commerce Minister come in Person to 
explain the matter in the House. 
  Following this, Sayyad Chipte Razi, deputing for Heptullah 
pacified the assembly by announcing that Najma Heptullah had 
conferred with Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji, who had agreed 
to give a briefing the next day. Jaipal Reddy, Subrahmanyam 
Swamy, Ashok Mitra, and others did not accept this and 
threatened to paralyze proceedings if they were not told 
immediately if the government had decided to sign the agreement 
or not. This was followed by great confusion in the parliament. 
Since the situation kept deteriorating, and nothing could be 
accomplished, the speaker had to postpone the proceedings once 
again to the next day. 
<H5>  `Dharna' by Political Parties: </H5>
  On Wednesday, many political parties and farmers' groups 
conducted a "Dharna" [picketting] in Jantar Mantar opposing the 
Dunkel proposals. They insisted that the government not sign the 
draft, and demanded a total rejection of it. Samajwadi Party's 
general secretary Raghu Thakur, Telugu Desam Parliamentary Party 
leader, V.S. Rao, CPI-M leaderAshok Mitra, Indian People's 
Front's national general secretary, Kumudini Pati, and Bharatiya 
Kisan Sangh-Delhi Branch leader Mahavir Singh participated in 
this dharna-agitation. 
  Leaders who spoke in the dharna gathering accused the 
government of selling the country out instead of safeguarding 
its interests by opposing schemes like the Dunkel plan. There 
were nation-wide agitations opposing the Dunkel proposals.

<F P=106> [Article by Ashok Mitra: "Capitulation and Decapitation"] </F>
  [Text] The rebuff to the Bharatiya Janata Party apart, on 
at least one other matter the verdict of Aryavarta is not 
encumbered by ifs and buts. For the first time, a proposed 
international treaty was made an electoral issue in this country. 
  The nation's largest political party, now ruling at the 
Centre, had chosen to defend before the electorate its decision 
to accept the Dunkel draft. The implementation of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade proposals, its election manifesto 
sought to say, would be a great boon to the Indian peasantry. 
The government should cherish no illusions: the Dunkel draft has 
not received Aryavarta's mandate, and particularly not the 
mandate of the Uttar Pradesh farm belt. 
  Perhaps that will not bother the government too much. 
Decisions on crucial economic questions have for some while 
ceased to be made on the basis of any objective assessment of 
the predilections and interests of citizens. Discussion in 
Parliament on the implications of the GATT document has been 
carefully avoided for as long as possible. 
  Negotiating an international agreement, the prime minister, 
Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, has obliquely suggested, is the 
prerogative of the government. Were the final signed document to 
turn out not to the liking of the representatives of the people 
the latter could, he seems to imply, move a vote of no 
confidence against the government. It would now perhaps be 
claimed on behalf of the prime minister that just as the 
assembly elections were not a referendum on the performance of 
his government, they constituted no referendum on the Dunkel 
draft either. 
  The prime minister and his party would clearly be caught in 
a 
bit of a contradiction here. The backtracking would, however, be 
understandable. Politicians, at least those who are without 
ideology and have assumed politics to be not dissimilar to any 
other random profession, have to survive in power, which 
compulsion necessitates occasional dissembling. 
  The issue will still not go away. The Dunkel draft is not 
like any other ordinary international treaty dealing with this 
or that aspect of external relations. It is going to interfere 
with India's internal economic processes. 
  Under the guise of ushering in an international trade regime 
untramelled by tariffs and other restrictions, it would 
restructure production, distribution and pricing arrangements in 
country after country, including in this one. The government 
would be on extremely vulnerable grounds were it to suggest the 
effects of such restructuring on the people is no business of 
Parliament. 
  Provisions in the draft concerning the pharmaceutical or 
software industries, biodiversities, finance and communications 
aside, two matters stand out. The consequences for the country's 
public distribution system including the system of food and 
necessity subsidy, and the vulnerability of agriculture if farm 
products from overseas were allowed entry into the country. 
  The government, faithfully adherent to the notes furnished 
by 
the GATT secretariat, has sought to laugh away the possibility 
of any post-Dunkel upheaval affecting the existing public 
distribution arrangements. Its point of view is deceptively 
simple. Subsidy in the case of a foodgrain distributed by a 
government agency, the draft says, must not be more than 10 per 
cent of the prevailing market price of the grain. 
  In no year in the past decade, it seems, has the subsidy for 
publicly distributed wheat or rice exceeded this margin. What 
has not happened in the past is unlikely to happen in the future 
either, the government argues. The apprehensions of economists 
and Opposition politicians, it suggests, are altogether 
unfounded. The discretionary margin allowed by the draft 
agreement is sufficiently wide for the power to distribute 
subsidised food to the weaker sections of society to be left 
unimpaired. 
  But will it? No major crop failure has taken place in the 
country during the past decade. The demands placed on the public 
distribution system have naturally been modest and the gap 
between the market price and the price in ration and fair price 
shops for the main cereals has been relatively narrow. 
  However, if the rains fail in some years in the proximate 
future this will change. And this could well happen as the 
country has had good rains successively for five years. The 
resulting crop failure might then lead to a steep decline in 
market supplies. Foodgrain prices could skyrocket. 
  Going by what was experienced in the mid-Sixties, it is by 
no 
means certain that a price rise of 200 to 300 per cent would not 
take place in the event of a mere 20 per cent drop in output. 
The market price for the principal cereals could shoot up to as 
much as Rs 20 per kilogram--if not everywhere, at least in some 
parts of the country. Were the Dunkel proposals to become the 
law of the land the government would in that eventuality be 
precluded from distributing rice or wheat at less than Rs 18 per 
kilogram. 
  Few of the nation's poor would be able to afford this price. 
In case the government were to announce, as part of famine 
relief operations, the free distribution of grain to distressed 
people, nothing would stop a free market zealot from requesting 
the GATT authorities that penal action be initiated against the 
Indian authorities for distributing farm products at a 100 per 
cent subsidy. 
  What is more, once the draft is signed, the government will 
have to allow the import of any and every agricultural commodity 
to the extent of 3.3 per cent of its domestic output. This is 
not as harmless as it sounds. Economic textbooks are full of 
examples of the violent price fluctuations of a farm product 
that could be brought about by a marginal increase or decrease 
in its supplies. 
  Once expectations are queered in a particular manner, and 
speculators and buyers are conditioned in their behaviour, even 
a marginal augmentation of supply is capable of bringing down 
prices by as much as 50 or 60 per cent, and thereby ruining the 
peasantry. 
  This clause inserted in the Dunkel proposals is not 
necessarily an innocent academic proviso. Some years ago, a 
group of strategists ensconced in the World Bank had floated a 
trial balloon. Global efficiency of production deserved to be 
maximised, including farm output. Agricultural productivity in 
the United States and Canada, as is common knowledge, is way 
ahead of productivity in other parts of the world, including of 
course Asia, Africa and Latin America. If the objective is--as 
it should be--to raise global resource use to its most feasible 
level, would it therefore not be sensible to concentrate all 
farm activity in the US and Canada alone? 
  The strategists ensconced inside the World Bank were not 
deterred by piffling little details. They did not care to spell 
out the alternative occupation or livelihood the poor peasantry 
in the inefficient countries could switch to if they surrendered 
their right to cultivate their land and became wholly dependent 
on imports. 
  Though the peasants of these poor lands would be without any 
occupation or income, it might nonetheless be insisted upon they 
pay for their imports at proper North American prices. It would 
be too bad if they failed to pay such prices. Imports would stop 
and they would be welcome to starve and die. 
  What is apocalypse to some is millenium to others. The 
Dunkel 
draft incorporates in itself the vision of a millenium thought 
up by the world's rich. Should the agriculture of a poor country 
collapse, the multinational monopolies could comfortably move in 
and do whatever they wanted with the country's food and 
agricultural policy. 
  It is a beautiful scheme. Once the signatures get appended 
to 
the Dunkel proposals, it would be binding on the government. The 
latter has for months on end refused to face Parliament on the 
issue, and it would be furiously denied that the verdict in UP 
is in part an expression of the people's wrath at the 
endorsement of the GATT final draft. Cheered by Western 
governments and the multinational lobby, it would proceed to 
arrange the noose around the nation's neck, nor would it feel 
ashamed at being present at its own beheading.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif by Najm 'Abd-al-Karim; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Bassam Abu-Sharif, who now serves as personal 
advisor to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, may seem to be a 
contradictory figure when we review his history. He began his 
career in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine with 
George Habash, the faction that the farthest to the extreme left 
in order to restore Palestinian rights. He dealt with and 
struggled with its slogans and ambitions and nearly paid the 
price of his life. Through his confrontation with the Arab and 
western press and media, however, he learned the difference 
between slogans and reality, between politics and dreams. 
  Al-Sadat and his peace with Israel were a reality the day 
Bassam Abu-Sharif shook his hand; he was disqualified from the 
Popular Front and joined 'Arafat's wing, believing in the steps 
that 'Arafat would take towards peace. 
  There is a great controversy over Bassam Abu-Sharif: the 
puzzles, quotations, and contradictions. In its interview with 
him, AL-MAJALLAH tried to shed light on the puzzle and the 
contradictions. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] We often listen to your fiery statements, 
then find PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat and other senior PLO members 
denying them, some saying that these views do not represent the 
organization. A short time later we discover that what you said 
was true, and that it is as if their denial never was. Are these 
the roles you are assigned? You make a statement, they deny it, 
then they accept what you said? 
  [Abu-Sharif] You have answered your own question. Media work 
and credibility are a sensitive and delicate balance, and it 
does not come in a night or an afternoon. Credibility is built 
over years, by relying on the truth that one says, and one does 
not necessarily say everything. 
  I built my media credibility by telling the truth, but not, 
as I said, the whole truth. A media person does not say anything 
erroneous, because that hurts his credibility, and I built this 
credibility over the years, especially with the global media and 
the wire agencies. 
  It has been proved to everyone, despite all the denials, 
that 
what I was saying was the truth. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] Why did the PLO recently issue a statement 
that made it sound as though you were being thrown out? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I don't know what statement you're talking 
about. I haven't read any statement criticizing me. What has 
come up recently are the rumors of the media services because of 
the phone lines being cut in my office. I am telling the truth 
when I say that the sole, solitary reason for the cutting of the 
phone lines is that we had no money to pay the phone bills. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] Some people see this matter of not paying 
those bills as an excuse, and say that it was the PLO that cut 
off your lines, to say that Bassam Abu-Sharif has nothing to do 
with the organization, and so may not speak in its name. 
  [Abu-Sharif] That is not true. The reason for cutting off 
the 
lines was lack of money. In spite of all that has been said in 
the press, these were the bills for the past four years. They 
piled up, and the telephone company moved slowly, though now it 
has cut off the lines, just as they cut off other lines in Tunis 
because the bills were not paid. I would like these lines to be 
restored at the first possible opportunity. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] Including 'Adnan Yasin's--which was open to 
the Mosad (the Israeli intelligence agency)? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Well ... 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] Can we talk about it? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Telephone lines! 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] Not 'Adnan Yasin's open lines to the Mosad? 
  [Abu-Sharif] The story of 'Adnan Yasin should not be either 
minimized or exaggerated. Not minimizing this story is that it 
is a gravely serious matter, as 'Adnan Yasin held a post that 
enabled him to be in contact with all members of the leadership, 
to go into any office, and look into many matters. I believe the 
Palestinian leadership is now in the process of interrogating 
him and opening files that could lead to heads rolling! I don't 
know what has gone on in Tunis in recent days, but I believe 
that President Yasir 'Arafat has formed an investigative 
committee with honest people to clear up the matter 
<H5>  Al-Hasan and Qari' </H5>
  ['Abd-al-Karim] What is the meaning of Hani al-Hasan's being 
appointed to post belonging to Qari', and making four official 
trips with President 'Arafat? He is the one who made the 
decision to expel him from the Executive Committee after going 
to Damascus and agreeing with ten organizations to adopt a stand 
against the agreement. How do you explain this move? How do you 
put it in perspective? Were these assigned roles too? 
  [Abu-Sharif] The perspective is simple: this is Palestinian 
democracy. The views of the minority are respected, and no 
decisions are made against them, against the minority, depriving 
them of their jobs. After the decision was made to sign the 
agreement, President Yasir 'Arafat asked everyone, whether 
dissidents or supporters of the move, to enact this agreement 
and proceed on the road to peace. 
  Hani al-Hasan is a member of the Palestinian organizational 
and legislative institutions, and a member of the Central 
Committee of Fatah; he has an active role. As to his being 
appointed chief of the negotiating team in the multinational 
talks, this is a sign that Hani al-Hasan, despite his dissident 
stance, has embarked on action to get the agreement enacted. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] I think the Palestinian democracy you are 
talking about is different from the political corridors, which 
go on in their normal fashion. There are those who talk about 
you yourself, when you were a member of the Popular Front, and 
when you suddenly joined the ranks of President 'Arafat. We 
don't know why you made the move: was it ideological, or was it 
a search for a niche for yourself? How do you explain all this? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Let us begin with the end of the question. For 
my part, my leaving the Popular Front was the result of 
political positions. I am convinced that the political line of 
President Yasir 'Arafat is sound, and that the Palestinians are 
entering a new phase that requires them to review their position 
in the world, and to know that the contradictions of this world 
are no longer contradictions based on the balance of military 
power. This world is seeking stability based on economic 
competition; for the first time the interests of the world are 
in line with the establishment of a stable Middle East. In order 
for it to be established, the Palestinian problem must be 
solved. My political difference with the authority was what made 
me leave the Popular Front, and led the Popular Front to expel 
me openly when I shook hands with President Husni Mubarak at the 
African summit in Addis Ababa. 
  As to Brother Hani al-Hasan, his meeting with the ten 
organizations, and the issuing of the declaration--we had 
invited all of them, including the Doctor [Habash], the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Democratic Front, 
once again to join the institutions of the PLO, in order to 
rebuild the infrastructure of Palestine, and to develop the 
economic state of Palestine. We are beginning with a first step, 
i.e., Gaza and Jericho, because the road is a long one, and we 
have no illusions. The thing is for everyone to work on 
rebuilding, and on ending the occupation of Palestinians in the 
occupied territories. 
<H5>  Gaza-Jericho </H5>
  ['Abd-al-Karim] Are you one of the optimists about the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement? 
  [Abu-Sharif] The truth is that I have criticisms of the 
agreement, and voiced them in the proper forums, but in general 
I am optimistic about the general course I see clearly coming 
from the Middle East. It is the most sensitive region of the 
world, with the strategic interests of the West and the vital 
interests of the peoples of the Middle East. There is a 
congruence, at this very moment, the historic moment, between 
the vital interests of the world in the Middle East, and the 
establishment of a stable Middle East. Now, they are not 
maintaining these interests just because they love the Arabs and 
the Palestinians. 
  The West is seeking to create a stability in the Middle East 
that will prevent explosions, prevent wars, and so that the 
global groups involved in the Middle East may benefit from its 
resources and markets. The Middle East problem has also become, 
for the first time in 50 years, clearly linked in the mind of 
the West, and in the mind of the United States, with a solution 
for the question of Palestine, and an end to the Israeli 
occupation of the Arab territories. How can stability take hold 
as long as Israel has not withdrawn from the territories it 
occupied in 1967, without, in Reagan's phrase, "land for peace," 
first stated in 1982, and subsequently reaffirmed by President 
Bush when he announced the initiative that led to the Madrid 
peace conference, and the acceptance of the peace process so far. 
  I am optimistic about the general course, starting with the 
congruence of the world's interests around the stability of the 
Middle East. On the other hand, I believe that Israel is in a 
very tight spot, perhaps a tighter spot than many of the Arabs. 
It is a difficult spot economically, spiritually, and 
strategically. I believe that the new generations in Israel are 
now convinced that there is no alternative to ending the 
occupation and getting rid of the Judaea and Samaria ideology 
which in itself has been an obstacle for long years. A step 
forward to ending the occupation and establishing peace with the 
Arabs enabling Israel to live in a world of big fish and little 
fish. As long as the little fish stick together in a school that 
cannot be swallowed by the big fish, they go, and they go like 
the wind. 
  Israel, too, is defending its interests, and not because it 
loves the Arabs, or is giving in to the wishes of the Americans. 
All these factors have convinced me that we must seize this 
historic moment, from its circumstances, and take a step 
forward. Gaza-Jericho is a first step on the road to the 
establishment of a Palestinian national authority in the 
territories occupied in 1967, then confederation with Jordan, 
and these will be followed by many developments in the Middle 
East, leading, perhaps, to the establishment of a common market 
to protect the interests of the peoples of the Middle East. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] This is the political strategy you are 
discussing from one position; the matter would move smoothly 
according to your ambitions as Palestinians. But will the 
Israeli side think the same way? Or will it go the same way with 
you? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I see the general course just as clearly as I 
can see you. At the same time, I have no illusions about this 
course being an easy one. There will be difficulties. There is 
an opposition in Israel, and there are extremists, just as we 
have an opposition and extremists. There are countries in the 
Middle East opposed to this course, though the majority, of 
course, support it. But we have no illusions. If the thing were 
easy, then why negotiate? The negotiations have one 
justification, which is to solve the problems pending between 
the two sides, and to reach compromises. I believe that this 
process will gradually build its inner dynamic. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] For you or for the Israelis? 
  [Abu-Sharif] For all the sides, like a snowball: the farther 
it goes, the bigger it gets. Everyone will be persuaded by the 
start of the economic wheel and the building, or rebuilding 
process. Everyone will be persuaded that peace means economic 
development, that peace means wide-ranging prosperity; that 
peace means a morsel of food. 
<H5>  Edward Sa'id's Opinion </H5>
  ['Abd-al-Karim] Edward Sa'id wrote in THE GUARDIAN of 
Britain 
that "secret negotiation between strong and weak is often at the 
expense of the weak, and in the interest of the strong. When the 
PLO went to Oslo and consented to secret negotiations, it 
contented itself with the weaker position." What do you think 
about that? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I salute Edward Sa'id, the intellectual and 
writer, who is as far as possible from politics and political 
thinking. If Germany had refused to negotiate its surrender, we 
would not be seeing a strong Germany now. Political thinking is 
one thing, theories about weak and strong are something else. 
The strategic dimension of the Palestinian question will 
continue to exist. Had the Palestinians been weak, the Israelis 
would have put an end to them and to the Arab organizations over 
the last 45 years. They have waged wars against us that might 
have eliminated some other peoples. 
  It is enough for me to remind Edward Sa'id of the battles in 
Jordan and the battles in Lebanon, of the PLO's other battles 
against Palestinians! Of the starvation in the camps, the 
destruction of the camps, of Israel's 27-year occupation of the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip. I would also remind him of the 
900,000 Arabs still in Israel as Israeli citizens, who are still 
Arabs who speak Arabic, who are proud of Arab poetry, and who 
give their children a good Arab upbringing. So we are strong; 
had we not been strong, Israel would not have sat down to 
negotiate with us on the basis of ending the Judaea and Samaria 
ideology--all their generations have been brought up to believe 
that [Judaea and Samaria] are an inseparable part of Israel. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] What concerns the Americans and the Egyptian 
mediators now is Syria's position, which rejects the secret 
agreement. Do you expect success on the Syrian front? 
  [Abu-Sharif] The Syrian-Israeli axis is progressing. I 
expect 
the signature of an agreement in the near future; I also expect 
a Jordanian-Israeli agreement to be signed in a few days. And, 
of course, a Lebanese-Israeli agreement. It would be a mistake, 
however, to imagine that our problem, us, the Palestinians, is 
the problem of the occupation of the Golan or the occupation of 
the border strip [of Lebanon]. Syria is a fully existing state, 
with its people on its territory, its sovereignty in force over 
its land; there is a piece of occupied Syrian territory called 
the Golan. The issue between Syria and Israel is the schedule of 
Israel's withdrawal from a piece of land belonging to an 
existing country that has its own institutions, its people on 
its land, and its sovereignty in force. The same is true of 
Lebanon. The issue between Lebanon and Israel is the occupation 
of the border strip. Us, we have two issues; the first is 
actually Israel's withdrawal, and the second is the Palestinian 
people's right to self-determination and the establishment of 
institutions and sovereignty over the land which had heretofore 
not existed. 
  Since 1948, the Palestinian people have lived under an 
Egyptian mandate in Gaza, and attached to Jordan in the West 
Bank. 
  So we have two issues, and a solution to our problem will 
come in two phases. This has been agreed upon. On this basis, 
all of the Arab negotiating sides have participated in 10 rounds 
of negotiations. What we advanced in the declaration of 
principles was a first step on the road to finding a solution to 
one of the two questions, and the two questions together: as a 
first step, Israeli withdrawal from these areas and giving the 
Palestinian people the rule of a national authority throughout 
the territories. It is not true that the Palestinians isolated 
themselves or were isolated. The only peace with Israel that has 
any value for us is a comprehensive peace. That means a peace in 
which all the Arabs meet to sign on the basis of land for peace 
with Israel. 
<H5>  The Economic Aspect </H5>
  ['Abd-al-Karim] In your interview you are focusing on the 
economic aspect. Don't you agree with me that the statements of 
Peres and Rabin call for a Middle East economic policy that 
would mean prosperity for everyone, including Israel? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Don't you agree with me that such talk of a 
Middle Eastern economic market are premature? 
  There can be no real progress at this level until a 
comprehensive peace has been realized. The Arab position here is 
absolutely clear, both in terms of the multinational meetings, 
and when the United States asked the Arabs to annul the Arab 
boycott resolutions. There can be no cooperation so long as 
there is no comprehensive peace, and comprehensive peace means 
the return of all the territories occupied in 1967, giving the 
Palestinian people its total right to self-determination. At 
that time, discussion of the establishment of a common market in 
the Middle East will become not only possible but, in my 
opinion, natural. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] Did you know about the accord or the secret 
talks going on in Oslo? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I had absolutely no idea. I was like many of 
the 
members of the leadership: in the dark about it. This was clear, 
with the use of staff that was not very well known to negotiate 
with the Israelis, so that it would remain quiet and hidden. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] It's as if in this interview you want to 
grant legitimacy to the Israeli presence in the region, even 
though we were brought up to believe that the Zionist state had 
stolen part of Arab territory. 
  [Abu-Sharif] Facts are facts, whether we like it or not, 
both 
for those who still call for the liberation of Palestine from 
the river to the sea, and those who signed the land-for-peace 
agreement. Israel is a fait accompli, and it is practical and 
necessary for our minds to deal with this; otherwise our people 
will remain under occupation, and we will remain in this 
miserable condition. 
  The agreement that was signed is a declaration of principles 
and a first step on the road to establishing a Palestinian 
national authority in a Palestinian state on all the land 
occupied in 1967. It is based on the initiative established by 
the Palestine National Council [PNC]. It is the PNC that 
established recognition of Resolutions 242 and 338, and the 
recognition of Israel in return for the establishment of a 
Palestinian state on the land occupied in 1967. 
  These are the facts; this is what those who do not want to 
remain in dreams and illusions must deal with. 
  But the signature of this agreement does not prevent those 
who want to dream or imagine or continue in the strategic 
defense of the historic right of the Palestinian people, from 
doing so! 
  I must say that it is not only the right but the obligation 
of our writers and intellectuals to keep on talking about this. 
With politicians it is different: they are dealing with it with 
the freedom of a people being crushed under occupation, with a 
morsel of food for these people, and their future. 
<H5>  Regarding Acceptance </H5>
  ['Abd-al-Karim] We rejected Resolution 181 in 1947, and we 
rejected the proposals of the Palestinian Communist Party, which 
called for keeping the partition. We did not listen to 
Bourguiba's appeals, and Resolutions 242 and 338 were rejected. 
Al-Sadat was killed because of his visit [to Israel]. You were 
one of the rejectionists in all these things. What new factor 
came along for you to consider a policy of accepting reality? 
  [Abu-Sharif] This is true. It is also true that there were 
resolutions adopted after all those you listed. There is--on 15 
November 1988, the PNC resolution to build a new strategy. There 
is the declaration of a Palestinian state; there is the consent 
to Yasir 'Arafat's initiative, plus the decision to go to Madrid. 
  These too are resolutions, and if they prove anything, it is 
that the Palestinian mind is not rigid, but flexible. Every 
resolution must be assessed at its time, and in the 
circumstances in which it was adopted. For example, today we 
cannot judge a decision made by Palestinians 40 years ago in 
their own circumstances. 
  These developments show that the Palestinians, and Arabs, 
too--because the Palestinians are not going it alone--have 
received the news in this world and been able to learn the facts 
of the matter and the conditions the world is going through. The 
Middle East is part of the world, and they were able to draw a 
new political line; not one that would remove them from the 
political map, but to put them at the heart of the political 
map. I say this is a healthy sign. It indicates that the Arabs 
know what is going on around them and have become capable of 
defending their interests, instead of being unaware, as McMahon 
and British and French colonialism, and even the Israelis, made 
them in the past. They--the Israelis--fooled numerous Arab 
organizations, who cooperated with them to impose suffering on 
the map of the Middle East. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] As long as we are talking about regimes, 
permit me to point out that you in the PLO were dealing with 
most of the regimes, and with their diverse ideologies, in a 
balanced fashion. With the exception of the Kuwait affair, that 
is, because your tilt towards the Iraqi regime cost you the 
balance you had had. 
  [Abu-Sharif] Frankly, I believe that there is a muddle and a 
mistake. The muddle is in interpreting the Palestinian position. 
The Palestinian position was clearly against the occupation, for 
Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, for the withdrawal of the foreign 
forces, and for avoiding war and the calamities of war. The 
mistake was one of expression; a great many expressions from 
some Palestinian leaders made our position seem as though it 
supported the occupation of Kuwait. No, we did not support the 
occupation of Kuwait. Naturally, there were some who supported 
it, just as in the Arab world there were some for and some 
against, but the Palestinian position was against Iraq's 
occupation of Kuwait. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] So, what do you call some Palestinian 
military units that were in Kuwait, with some of them 
questioning Kuwaiti citizens in interrogations? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I don't think there were any Palestinian 
military units in Kuwait at all. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] Some people say that there were Palestinian 
forces side by side with the Iraqi forces. 
  [Abu-Sharif] There was the Arab Liberation Front, and the 
Arab Liberation Front, as you know, is a branch of the Ba'th 
Party in Iraq, not a Palestinian organization. Here I am not 
denying that some Palestinians took a certain position, but it 
was not the official one. 
  The official position was clear, and I am aware of the 
details due to the letters sent to numerous Arab and 
international figures. Our position, in its first paragraph, 
called for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and the formation of an 
Arab political committee to find a political solution to prevent 
war and spare the Arabs its calamities. 
<H5>  Persuading Saddam Husayn </H5>
  ['Abd-al-Karim] Is it true that Salah Khalaf (Abu-Iyad) 
clashed with Iraqi President Saddam Husayn during the invasion? 
  [Abu-Sharif] The fact is that the Palestinian leadership's 
meetings with Saddam Husayn were for the most part attempts to 
persuade him of a political solution, attempts to convince him 
that it was essential to withdraw from Kuwait, attempts to 
convince him that the war would bring destruction upon everyone. 
Unfortunately, all that was shown on television was Abu-'Ammar 
embracing Saddam Husayn, and this image was put to evil uses, to 
harm the Palestinian position. Regarding the assassination of 
Abu-Iyad during that crisis, it had no connection with what you 
mention. Another Palestinian faction assassinated him. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] How will you confront Hamas inside the 
territories? They oppose the agreement. 
  [Abu-Sharif] Hamas is against it. They have the right to 
express their view, and we respect their opinion, but we demand 
that they go along with the majority decision. The majority 
decision is the Palestinian decision, and internal conflicts 
will not be solved by the use of violence. That much is agreed 
upon: freedom to express opinions and the democratic struggle. 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] What about the intifadah? 
  [Abu-Sharif] The intifadah is the popular resistance to 
occupation. If the occupation ends, there is no need for 
resistance! 
  ['Abd-al-Karim] But large areas of national territory are 
still occupied. 
  [Abu-Sharif] No, this is a first step. The first step is 
Gaza 
and Jericho, and within nine months from this step, according to 
the agreement, come the rest of the West Bank territories. The 
question of Jerusalem remains to be negotiated in the next phase. 
  I bid Bassam Abu-Sharif good-bye, convinced that he had not 
said everything, and we agreed to meet again when the first and 
genuine step is made: the day of the withdrawal of Israeli 
forces from Gaza and Jericho in a few weeks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Amman: "Executive Committee Not </F>
Acting to Limit 'Arafat's Individual Control"] 
  [Text] A member of the Palestinian Democratic Reform 
Committee, headed by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, has declared that 
the committee achieved no specific or palpable results in its 
meetings with the Executive Committee and President 'Arafat in 
Tunis last week. The only exception was a national dialogue 
committee; 'Abd-al-Shafi was entrusted with forming a National 
Dialogue Committee, and with following up on this task. The 
Executive Committee confirmed that the constitutional document 
announced had not yet been enacted by the committee. It had been 
submitted for popular discussion and for specialized parties to 
discuss it and to propose any amendments and submit them to the 
Executive Committee. As to the other proposals, a member of the 
Reform Committee, who refused to identify himself, said that its 
acceptance in principle was, in actual fact, merely a polite 
rejection, or an effort to escape and be elusive. 
  The advisory committee, proposed by what is called the 
Planning Council of the National Council, an ineffective council 
that has not played any role since it was founded in the second 
session of the National Council more than 20 years ago, and the 
Manpower Development Department were gutted of their purpose and 
abridged by modernizing the Palestinian Data Bank, in place for 
more than 12 years. As regards elections, the general impression 
we came away with is that the topic of elections was left open 
to many different possibilities, as the realization of the 
importance and necessity of holding them does not rule out the 
possibilities of avoiding them or emptying them (were they to be 
held) of their meaning. 
  A member of the Reform Committee added, "The positions and 
participation of our fellow members of the Executive Committee 
who took part in the meetings were not helpful to the delegation 
in its task. They have ranged from utter silence and aloofness 
to our requests, coming up with pretexts and excuses, to 
support, confirming our preliminary impression that Brother 
'Arafat is still the one who makes the decisions, and that the 
other members of the Executive Committee make no effort to limit 
this individual control. They are resigned to this fact." 
Despite this, the Reform Committee member says that the results 
the committee achieved on its own constitute a step forward, 
albeit a small one, and that the process must go on, in various 
forms, building on this step, in order to achieve decisive 
reforms, dealing not only with the existing institutions of the 
PLO, but with the structure, institutions, and departments of 
the national authority. This way, it will be democratic and 
attract our people's many qualified cadres to join. He added 
that the memorandum as a format and framework of the action had 
achieved its ends, but the democratic demands it contained still 
stood, and that action had to be pursued to achieve them and to 
turn them into solid proposals. Reform, in its old concept, and 
the obselete action linked to it, are not in force. What needs 
to be done is for demands to be brought forward for the building 
of the new national sovereignty with its various agencies, 
departments, and institutions. The Reform Committee delegation, 
which visited Tunis, may have seven members: Dr. Haydar 
'Abd-al-Shafi, Ibrahim Abu-Ayyash, Dr. Taysir 'Aruri, Tawfiq 
Abu-Bakr, Nabil 'Amru, Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, and Ghazi 
al-Khalili. Zuhayrah Kamal, representative of the women's 
component in the territories, will be associated with the 
delegation. 
  The meetings with the Executive Committee chaired by 'Arafat 
yielded the following provisions: 
  1. To form an advisory committee for the Executive 
Committee, 
with a number of experienced, qualified, and credible persons, 
and of varied fields of expertise, which will study the issues 
and topics submitted to the Executive Committee, to advise and 
consult on them before they are decided. 
  2. To form two advisory committees, one each in the West 
Bank 
and Gaza Strip, made up of capable and credible persons who 
represent the political and social fabric of our people in the 
territories, in such a way that each of these two committees 
might be a national authority in local issues of the political 
leadership (the Executive Committee), submitting to it advice 
and consultation in domestic issues in all that relates to the 
building of the institutions of the national authority, its 
attendant departments, etc. 
  3. To create a department to deal with development and the 
evolution of manpower, as one of the departments of the PLO. 
This office would be concerned with updating the Palestinian 
data bank to collect and compile Palestinian resources both in 
the diaspora and in the country, to prepare precise information 
about them: their qualifications, fields of expertise, and 
practical capabilities, to be at the dispoal of of the Executive 
Committee and its institutions as needed. It will also prepare 
the program and practical plans for training and retraining. It 
will train the cadres of the Palestinian revolution and the 
workers who are proposed for work in the institutions of the 
national authority and its various departments. 
  4. To improve our negotiating mechanism as a political 
command and negotiating committees, to move away from 
improvisation in defining policies and selecting negotiating 
committee members, relying on defined authority to monitor the 
negotiating delegations in receiving information from them or 
relaying instructions to them, putting an end to the acquisition 
of multiple communications and contacts with the negotiating 
delegations, depending on standards of capability, experience, 
and specialization in selecting members of the negotiating 
committees. 
  5. To hold elections for the legislative council proposed 
for 
the national authority on its appointed date this coming July, 
in accordance with democratic and contemporary election law. 
These elections should not be postponed or avoided, regardless 
of excuses, pretexts, or justifications. 
  In addition, to submit the constitutional document prepared 
by the Legal Committee to the people for discussion, for their 
comments and amendments, to review it in that light, so that it 
may be a democratic constitutional document, conforming to the 
democratic principles contained in the declaration of 
independence, such as: the establishment of democracy as our 
method, respect for opinions and opposing opinions, political 
pluralism, the rights of women, etc. 
  6. To form a National Dialogue Committee made up of 
independent figures who enjoy the confidence and respect of all 
levels of our people. This committee would conduct an expanded 
national dialogue, including not only what are called opposition 
factions, but the diverse factions and groups of our people at 
home and abroad, with the aim of achieving a state of national 
harmony founded on a commitment to democratic dialogue in 
managing domestic relations on the Palestinian scene; respect 
for political pluralism and for all shades of opinion; and 
coordinating national efforts to build the Palestinian national 
entity on the basis of commitment to the establishment of an 
independent Palestinian state.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Yusuf Sayigh, Palestinian Economic </F>
Council member; place and date not given: "Dr. Yusuf al-Sayigh 
Tells al-Safir the Entire Story of the Palestinian Economic 
Council; Economic Separation From Israel Requires Surgery, and 
We Will Perform It; Future Competition Will Be Between Israel 
and Lebanon; Issuing Palestinian Currency Is a Risky Adventure"] 
  [Excerpt] From the position of an expert academic, Dr. 
Yusuf Sayigh talks about the Palestinian occupied territories' 
economy after occupation. Embarking on the details and dwelling 
on an explanation of the causes and results, the economist 
renounces the game of loyalty and opposition and becomes a 
technician who tries to control damage and make the promised 
start the best start possible. 
  One is amazed by the enthusiasm of this man, who was born in 
Acre in 1916, and by his determination to face the 
difficulties--and they are many--that obstruct, in his opinion, 
the rescuing of the occupied territories' deteriorating economy. 
He is not a politician and has no right to despair. Economy is a 
science and cannot endure bargaining or withstand failure. 
  Sayigh, a part-time adviser to a number of Arab economic 
establishments and a member of the Palestine National Council 
since it was founded in 1964, seems to be the liaison between 
the PLO, in its capacity as the future government in the 
occupied territories, on the one hand and, on the other hand, 
the IMF, the World Bank, and the aid-granting countries. Sayigh, 
along with Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'), tries to reconcile what is 
economic to both sides with what is political. 
  AL-SAFIR interviewed Sayigh, who talked about the scheduled 
economic plans, about the obstacles facing them, and about the 
occupied territories' real needs, as compared with what is 
actually projected. Sayigh pointed out that all projects are 
still in limbo awaiting a final political decision, which is 
supposed to be made by the PLO or, to be specific, by PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. 
  In the interview Dr. Sayigh explains the reasons he moved 
away from Tunis lately, where he was confronted with the 
problems of bureaucracy and of exclusive decisionmaking, and 
where he could no longer continue to be a spectator watching 
catastrophic mistakes being made in preparing for the 
Palestinian future. He recounts the story of how the Palestinian 
Economic Council was formed and discusses the debate with the 
World Bank, the Palestinian economy's future and role, Israel's 
future plans, the region's future economic conflicts, and the 
endeavors to promote the so-called Mideastern market. Here is 
the text of the interview: 
  [AL-SAFIR] Economic issues continue to represent the most 
important aspect of the accord... 
  [Sayigh] I was away from Tunisia--I was in Lebanon--when the 
accord was announced on 13 September, and I was surprised by it. 
But I am not opposed to the accord. However, we could have 
gotten more economically, especially since Israel seeks to cross 
into the Arab countries economically through the accord. Had 
Palestinian negotiators mastered tactics, they would have 
achieved greater economic gains. 
  [AL-SAFIR] So Israel wants the new Palestinian entity to be 
a 
bridge to the other Arab countries? How can this be accomplished 
tangibly? 
  [Sayigh] Even though most Arab states are eager to lift the 
boycott of Israel, they say that it cannot be lifted unless 
Israel reaches a settlement with the Palestinians. 
Theoretically, these states are in a state of hostility and war 
with Israel. The only card they hold is the boycott card. 
Recognition is not a card in the Arabs' hands. Consequently, we 
have had to fight for the only remaining card. What could we 
have obtained? Now, we (Palestinians) and the Israelis have 
become like Siamese twins economically. The appendices to the 
accord show that we are strongly tied to the Israelis 
economically and that we will end up turning our back on the 
Arab economies. It will not be easy for us to separate from the 
Israelis. The matter will require "surgery," and we will be 
compelled to perform this surgery. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Fundamentally, did this link with Israel not 
exist 
prior to the accord? 
  [Sayigh] It existed in spite of us. Now it has become 
stronger, with our signature, and herein lies the danger. 
Initially, the link was imposed on us by a colonialist and 
occupying power. Now we have put our signature to the accord. 
Thus, the link has been given our approval. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Does the accord not represent an endeavor to 
disengage from the Israeli economy? 
  [Sayigh] This matter is negotiable. 
  [AL-SAFIR] How can this be accomplished? A World Bank report 
talks about a customs union, about the banking sector's role, 
and so forth. These are points on which you negotiated with the 
World Bank point by point. So what is the true nature of the 
ongoing struggle concerning economic issues? 
  [Sayigh] Let us take, for example, the trade relationship: 
should it be a free trade zone or a customs union? Israel has 
not projected either of these two options because it is 
experiencing an internal struggle. Merchants want a customs 
union and industrialists want a free trade zone because a zone 
of this kind allows each partner to establish the customs 
barriers it wishes vis-a-vis the outside world, be they high, 
low, or moderate barriers. Israel expects us, as a small and 
young country, to purchase our needs at the lowest prices so we 
can manufacture, produce, and so forth. Therefore, we need our 
tariff to be lower than Israel's. 
  If this comes true and such a tariff is established, we will 
import electronics, for example, and sell them on the Israeli 
market because there will be no borders between us and Israel, 
according to the free trade zone. Such a situation will harm 
Israeli merchants. A customs union means that there will be a 
single customs tariff for both sides. This will not suit us. 
Israel's production is much greater than ours and Israel does 
not import from abroad as we do. Therefore, it is in our 
interest not to raise our tariff so the prices of our 
commodities will not rise, whereas it is in Israel's interest to 
raise its tariff so as to support its products. A union will 
require us to raise our prices artificially. 
  [AL-SAFIR] So the dilemma is in the need for economic 
independence and the impossibility of this independence at the 
same time? 
  [Sayigh] If Israel lifts its hand and allows us freedom of 
economic decisionmaking, then we can do what we wish. We can, 
for example, build a new road network. The road network has 
developed greatly--not the roads that link our villages with 
each other but the roads that link the settlements with each 
other, and the settlements are located in the territories 
occupied in 1948. The same applies to electricity. Like Beirut, 
the occupied territories suffer from rationing and power 
outages. This also goes for water. The Jewish settler gets 
sixfold the amount of water a Palestinian citizen gets from our 
waters. 
  If we controlled our economic decisionmaking, we would 
control all these issues. Now, we are destined to use Israeli 
electricity for one year or more. Private Palestinian 
electricity companies cannot meet all the demand. Jerusalem has 
an independent electricity company, but this company is unable 
to meet the demands of all Arab citizens. The same goes for 
Ramallah. 
  [AL-SAFIR] But the accord stipulates a united electric power 
network? 
  [Sayigh] The accord states that if the Palestinians wish to 
establish their own electric power company, they may do so. 
  [AL-SAFIR] In such a case, will priority be given to the 
infrastructure or to something else in the first phase, which is 
scheduled to begin either after the 13th of next January or of 
next April? 
  [Sayigh] This will be determined in two years, not now. The 
World Bank program is a two-year program. It is within the World 
Bank's conditions and powers to study the economy of all the 
territories occupied in 1967 and to conclude its study with 
developmental visions and proposals, provided that the emphasis 
is put on the public sector's role and on infrastructure. No 
reference has been made to agriculture or industry and only a 
distant reference is made to the tourism sector. The program 
focuses on the physical infrastructure, i.e. roads, electricity, 
and telephones; and on the social infrastructure, meaning 
education, health, and training. 
  [AL-SAFIR] And housing? 
  [Sayigh] The World Bank refused to include the population in 
its program. Insofar as the West Bank and Gaza Strip refugee 
camps are concerned, we basically refuse to discuss their future 
on the basis of keeping them where they are, considering that 
their future is governed by resolution 194 of 1948--a resolution 
that stipulates the right to repatriation. 
  [AL-SAFIR] So will this issue be ignored? 
  [Sayigh] No. We have estimated that there are nearly 20,000 
housing units (out of a total of 185,000 units) that are in very 
poor condition. We will start replacing these units. There are 
185,000 units in each of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including 
enough units to accommodate the 1967 refugees, whom we think 
will return. Israel has now permitted the repatriation of 5,000 
refugees annually, which means that an entire century is needed 
to repatriate all of the 1967 refugees. 
  We also have a program to replace the housing units in poor 
condition outside the camps. There is terrible overcrowding. One 
finds an average of no less than three persons living in a room 
with an area of no more than four square meters. So, we need a 
total of 185,000 housing units. The World bank has refused to 
discuss this issue, expressing the opinion that it requires a 
political decision. We rejected this position because everything 
requires a political decision ultimately. 
  When the World Bank issued the first version of their 
program 
last spring, they asked to meet with me. We met in Amman and 
discussed the issue for nine hours. They embraced 70 percent of 
my observations concerning the housing issue. They said that 
they will discuss the housing issue if the right to repatriation 
is permitted. After modifications, we met with them again before 
the final decision was made in Washington. All the countries 
involved in the multinational negotiations, i.e. 40 countries, 
participated with us in that meeting. I headed the Palestinian 
delegation. The meetings lasted two days, 20 and 21 September 
[1993]. I was able to convince them that the allocations for 
infrastructure were very meager. They had allocated a sum of $3 
billion for a period of 10 years, whereas our estimates showed 
that a sum of $4.3 billion was needed over seven years, i.e. 
more than their estimated figure. Finally, they acknowledged 
that they had to reconsider the matter, and they raised the sum 
to $5 billion. 
  At the meeting, which will be held on the 16th of this month 
(tomorrow) in Paris, the final version of the World Bank 
program, which is being modified in light of the observations I 
sent to them, will be presented. It is said that they have 
allocated $80 million to build housing in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip throughout two years in order to replace the units in poor 
condition. But we have found that the minimum cost of a housing 
unit with an area of 100 square meters and capable of 
accommodating six individuals is estimated at $20,000, excluding 
the land (state-owned land) which will be granted by the 
government. This cost also excludes water and electricity, which 
will have to be supplied from outside. This means that the $80 
million will build no more than 4,000 units and that this $80 
million is one-fifth the needed sum. They have amended the sum 
for housing, but it is still less than what we are asking. 
  As for electricity, we seek to create the ability to 
generate 
enough electricity to meet the occupied territories' needs. But 
this will take time. To reach this stage, we have two options: 
either supply Gaza with electric power from Egypt and the West 
Bank with electric power from Jordan, if they have a surplus, or 
emulate the "Beirut formula," i.e. purchase big generators to 
supply individual quarters until we are able to establish a 
central power-generating capacity. 
<H5>  Economic Council </H5>
  [AL-SAFIR] Where did the discussion that was held at one 
time 
on forming a Palestinian economic council lead and what are its 
guarantees? 
  [Sayigh] I will tell you about the council's background. I, 
Tony Zahlan (a retired A.U.B. professor), and Abu-'Ala' 
developed the concept of PEDRA. We emerged with the formula for 
an organization which we called the Provisional Economic 
Development and Reconstruction Agency, or authority. We said 
that this was a temporary formula because the agency should not 
remain independent and that when the state completes its 
structures, this agency must become a part of the state, either 
as a development board similar to the one in Lebanon or as an 
agency divided into smaller parts, with the road construction 
section attached to the ministry of public works, and so forth. 
We proposed this formula, realizing that the resources that we 
are scheduled to receive within five years, i.e. $2.4 billion, 
would make many drool. An honest man will not steal, but he will 
do his family and friends favors, and so forth. This is why we 
decided that means have to be established to control the 
process; that the board of governors has to operate very openly 
and has to submit annual reports to be published; that internal 
and external accounts have to be audited by a well-known 
international firm; that we have to emphasize capability 
primarily; and that salaries have to be adequate so that 
employees will not be compelled to accept bribes or to leave us 
if they get better offers. 
  Because immense sums of money are involved, politicians, 
especially Executive Committee members, have felt that this 
agency would have major powers. To eliminate these fears, we 
proposed the creation of a higher council, called the Higher 
Economic and Social council, to supervise the board of 
governors. We proposed that the council include 40 or 50 
politicians and Executive Committee members and be headed by 
Abu-'Ammar. We also said that the board of governors should be 
formed of no more than nine members who are experts on the 
settlement issue, i.e. engineers, economists, and financial and 
social experts, provided they are accountable before the higher 
council. This council will assume an advisory character and will 
meet twice a year. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Where will you meet: in Gaza or Jericho? 
  [Sayigh] In whichever place can accommodate us. 
  [AL-SAFIR] So Gaza is more likely. 
  [Sayigh] Gaza is crowded to start with. I am apprehensive 
about Gaza because it means reliance on the Egyptian civil 
administration. 
  So, we proposed the advisory council formula, provided that 
the main powers and the power to follow up on, implement, and 
amend programs is in the hands of the board of governors, which 
will be accountable before the higher council. This formula was 
proposed in mid-September [1993]. I was assigned to head the 
Palestinian delegation and to go to Washington and hold 
discussions with the World Bank and attend meetings of the 
aid-granting countries. 
  We learned that the aid-granting countries wished to be 
familiarized with the form of the council we had proposed 
because these countries do not give their money away easily. But 
I could not announce any formula before the World Bank or before 
the aid-granting countries without a political cover. This is 
why Abu-'Ala' conveyed our vision to Abu-'Ammar, who said that 
the formula was good and gave it his approval. But Abu-'Ammar 
said that he could not give us written approval because he is a 
"democratic man who deals through the institutions and has to 
present the formula to the Executive Committee." He added that 
they had created a Higher Palestinian National Committee--of 
whose members only the chairman has been appointed to date--and 
that the formula had to be presented to this committee before it 
is given written approval. 
  I told the World Bank that we had not yet obtained written 
approval but that there was oral approval. World Bank officials 
literally told us that they wished to see such a formula but 
they did not demand it explicitly so they would not look like 
teachers and we like students. 
  Our formula was identical to their vision. The aid-granting 
countries and the World Bank approved it unanimously. 
  Moreover, the working team concerned with the region's 
affairs at the State Department, headed by Ross Kurtzer and 
including others, invited me for a discussion on the development 
program and our vision of how to implement it. The U.S. Treasury 
Department, represented by Under Secretary Summers, and Mrs. 
Spero, under secretary for economic affairs at the U.S. State 
Department, also met with me and supported my program. The 40 
aid-granting countries also supported it fully on 27 September. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Did they support the mechanism? 
  [Sayigh] They supported the mechanism, the concept, and the 
projects. 
  [AL-SAFIR] You proposed this formula on the basis of an 
economic logic. But Washington has its political reasons also. 
If the PLO's political authority in Gaza-Jericho is limited; if 
its security authority is inadequate; and if the political 
authority is stripped away from it; then the PLO will be left 
practically naked. Is this not Washington's political goal? 
  [Sayigh] We did not forget the political aspect. This is why 
we proposed creation of the higher council under Abu-'Ammar's 
chairmanship. 
  [AL-SAFIR] The West and the aid-granting countries propose 
the formation of an independent commission which would have 
political independence. 
  [Sayigh] Yes, this is what they want. I explained our 
proposal to them and told them that it has to be approved by the 
Executive Committee and other institutions. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Where the Gaza-Jericho accord is concerned, 
perhaps this point has the greatest degree of overlap between 
economics and politics? 
  [Sayigh] We, too, realize that people have to see economic 
benefits in the accord. Otherwise they will rebel against it. I 
am not opposed to the presence of economic benefits. 
  [AL-SAFIR] What is the format needed to preserve the 
proposed 
formula and the PLO's role simultaneously? 
  [Sayigh] The board of governors will be accountable to the 
Political Committee, which can, for example, dismiss us or 
direct us. As an example, the Development Board chairman in 
Beirut is subject to the control of a political authority. 
  However, when I ended my meetings in Washington, I returned 
to Tunis. Abu-'Ammar had not yet signed the approval. It was 6 
October then. The proposal had been submitted to him on 14 
September. The World Bank started calling me and I suggested 
that the World Bank deputy chairman concerned with the region's 
affairs visit Abu-'Ammar. 
  A World Bank delegation comprised of a deputy chairman, the 
Arab East region official, and Adviser 'Abdallah Abu-Habib 
arrived. 
  We asked Abu-'Ammar to sign a resolution establishing this 
agency (PEDRA), but he said he was unable to do so. He said "I 
am a democratic man and I have institutions to refer to, such as 
the Executive Committee, the Palestine National Authority, and 
the Higher Economic Council." Of these, only the Executive 
Committee actually exists. 'Arafat asked "When do you want me to 
sign? What is the grace period?" 
  We told him that we had wanted the resolution signed the day 
before but that it was still okay and that "we mean what we 
say." But Abu-'Ammar responded, "I cannot. I have to check with 
others." We then got a promise from him that the resolution 
would be signed by 31 October at the latest. But he did not sign 
it. 
  It was then time for me to leave to a conference of the 
aid-granting countries on 4 and 5 November. I and Abu-'Ala' 
represented Palestine at the conference. The arrangement was 
that I would take the signed resolution with me so it would be 
announced officially at the conference. On the evening of 2 
November there was no news of any signing. On the morning of the 
31st [no month or year given], i.e. just prior to my departure 
for the airport to leave on my trip, I had contacted Abu-Mazin, 
who is a frank man and with whom I am friendly, and asked him 
what had happened at the Executive Committee meeting a day 
earlier because we had received nothing and I had to take the 
text of the resolution with me. Abu-Mazin said, "Nothing was 
determined. It was a stormy session and we disagreed and split 
into two factions." 
  I contacted Abu-al-Lutf, who said to me in the style of 
Ahmad 
al-Shuqayri [PLO chairman before 'Arafat], "What is this 
ultimate grace period? Do they want to control us? Do they want 
to dictate to us? We will rebel and we will sign after the third 
day of the month (November)." I said to him, "Are you kidding? 
These people have offered us $2.4 billion and you want to 
dictate to them? Are you kidding?" He answered, "No, I am 
serious." 
  Before I left Tunisia, a young man from the Economic 
Department told me that Abu-'Ammar had signed the resolution 15 
minutes earlier and that he was going to fax it to Abu-'Ala' in 
Paris. I asked the man, "What is the text?" 
  He responded that Abu-'Ammar had installed himself as 
chairman, Faruq al-Qaddumi as deputy chairman, and Muhammad 
Zuhdi al-Nashashibi as second deputy chairman. Abu-'Ammar also 
transferred all the powers designated for the board of governors 
to the higher council, which meets twice a year, and formed the 
board of governors with the names we had proposed. 
  I left for Paris, where I met with Abu-'Ala' and told him 
the 
story. He told me that there was a mistake and that he had just 
talked to al-Hakam al-Bal'awi, who said that Abu-'Ammar had 
signed the version we had submitted. 
  The following morning, i.e. 4 November, and just half an 
hour 
before the meeting, a fax of the distorted resolution was 
received. Abu-'Ala' said to me, "You can rebel and say whatever 
you wish because you are not an employee. But I am compelled to 
announce the resolution. I will not defend it. But I cannot 
criticize it." 
  The Europeans were surprised and started to wonder. One 
European said, "This will not pass." They addressed their words 
to me at the meeting. I was angry so I referred them to 
Abu-'Ala', who said that he was not present [at the meeting that 
adopted the resolution] and that he was in Washington before 
coming to Paris. 
  The aid-granting countries, especially the European 
Community 
and the Norwegians (the accord's godfathers), issued official 
statements denouncing this formula. 
  They decided that the Norwegian foreign minister, who 
chaired 
the conference, would meet with Abu-'Ammar and inform him that 
this formula had been rejected, and this is what actually 
happened. The foreign minister returned with a new formula 
reflecting what we had proposed--an advisory council and a board 
of governors with certain powers, to which they added even more 
powers. They also defined the powers of the director general and 
of Abu-'Ammar, the national authority chairman. They made the 
board of governors accountable to the national authority, not 
Abu-'Ammar personally. Faruq al-Qaddumi was made chairman of the 
board of governors and al-Nashashibi was made a member, not 
deputy chairman. This angered al-Nashashibi, who considered me 
responsible for the affair. I received from him a "very 
malicious" letter in which he says, "you mislead news agencies 
and say that I am not deputy chairman, whereas the truth is the 
opposite." 
  [AL-SAFIR] But no direct decision was made by 'Arafat? 
  [Sayigh] No. In the meantime, the board of governors held a 
meeting which I did not attend. So Abu-'Ammar contacted me to 
tell me, "The beloved one knows his place, so he dallies." I 
responded, "No beloved and no dallying. You held a meeting and I 
suspended my membership for reasons you are aware of because I 
have stated these reasons publicly. Besides, I was not invited 
to the meeting." He said, "You were away, and this is why you 
were not invited. I am inviting you personally now." I answered, 
"I want to acquaint you with my position on this issue. I have 
two fundamental objections: First, the board of governors has no 
powers in the formula you have issued, and second, you have 
installed yourself as chairman of the board of governors. I have 
nothing against you personally. On the contrary, I appreciate 
and respect you as a head of state. But the head of state may 
not be the chairman of an authority that is accountable to him. 
How could he be accountable to himself? In all your statements 
you say that we are accountable to you personally. No, we are 
accountable to the national authority. If this authority is 
still nonexistent, then we are accountable to the Executive 
Committee. Therefore, I feel that if constitutional affairs are 
not set right, I will not participate. Of the council created 
since the Norwegian amendment, only the chairman exists so far. 
There are 60 others whose identities we must know. Moreover, the 
national authority must be formed and resolutions must be made 
within the framework of the institutions." Abu-'Ammar answered, 
"Let us talk about other issues. We must establish a development 
bank." I said, "Yes, we must do this. But we must fully create 
all the required conditions." He asked, "What are these 
conditions and requirements?" I said, "Authorities must come 
into existence and we must determine on the basis of what law or 
legislation we will create them." Abu-'Ammar answered, "I will 
issue a decree right now" and he pulled out a sheet of paper. I 
said, "This is not how decrees are issued. Do you have the power 
to issue decrees now? We are still in November. Where did you 
get the authority to contact the occupied territories? Even if 
you have the authority in Gaza and Jericho, you must realize 
that either the Israeli or the Jordanian side will govern this 
decree. This means that you will issue an illegitimate decree 
and devise an illegitimate law." He answered, "This is an 
Israeli reading of the issue." I responded, "Nobody says such a 
thing to me. My reading is national and patriotic. If this is 
your opinion, then there is no need for me to be sitting here." 
Abu-'Ammar answered, "I did not mean that. You misunderstood 
me." He then proceeded to make justifications. 
  I proceeded to tell him, "Even if you have all the powers, 
the capital of a development bank has to be $500 million. Should 
we create it in one session?" He answered, "No, I will give you 
two or three days." I said, "We have a study conducted by a 
prominent World Bank economist, a retired Palestinian who spent 
three months drafting the study. This study was drafted before 
announcement of the declaration of principles. Therefore, it 
must be modified in light of the new conditions. We want to put 
down some of our observations on the study, which will take two 
or three weeks. Then we want to send them to the economist and 
get the opinion of an international law adviser. This may take 
weeks." Abu-'Ammar responded, "You are 'classicists' and you do 
not known how to work." I said, "Abu-'Ammar, you are an engineer 
and you will understand what I am going to say: if the 
foundation is faulty, the whole structure will be faulty." He 
answered, "And for something that is faulty, one uses extra 
cement and iron." 
  [AL-SAFIR] Who was present at the session? 
  [Sayigh] There were eight members. The following day I said 
to al-Qaddumi, "I will attend no more meetings until you, not 
Abu-'Ammar, head them, provided only those invited by the 
council attend these meetings." Yasir 'Abdrabbuh and 'Ali Ishaq, 
who are not members, were present. I also said that we had to 
establish a constitution that determines how we debate issues 
and how we vote. 
  [AL-SAFIR] What is the story of the Central Bank and the 
balances between the occupied territories and the diaspora in 
forming its management? 
  [Sayigh] In the occupied territories there was full support 
for our position until two days before my departure from 
Tunisia. That is when Abu-'Ammar received a message from the 
Norwegian foreign minister. Perhaps during his visit to the 
Scandinavian countries he told the Norwegians that if we did not 
receive financial resources and if the development process is 
obstructed, "my people will suffer, and you will be 
responsible." That message appointed Abu-'Ammar to the position 
of "report point" [as published], a position I had not heard of 
before. They also appointed al-Qaddumi as supervisor and deputy 
chairman and al-Nashashibi as deputy chairman, as well. The 
distribution of powers remained unchanged. I stressed that I 
would boycott the meetings if Abu-'Ammar headed them. I 
emphasized this because I had been an Executive Committee member 
for more than three years and knew that Abu-'Ammar was 
determined to dictate his opinion. I told them that I was going 
to spend six weeks in Beirut and asked them to let me know if 
conditions changed. 
  He [Abu-'Ammar] has not dismissed me to date because he 
realizes that if the World Bank finds out that I have been 
ousted, it would mean that the situation had become complicated, 
considering that I am the only one who stands up to Abu-'Ammar. 
  Abu-'Ammar began to realize that all those around him were 
criticizing him and that a lot was being said in this regard. 
  Yasir 'Abdrabbuh, Abu-Mazin, Sulayman al-Najjab, and three 
others--Yasir 'Amr, Samir Ghawshah, and Jamal al-Surani from 
Jordan--did not sign the appeal [no earlier mention made of this 
appeal]. This means that six out of nine members did not sign it. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Is it personal love of leadership on the part of 
Abu-'Ammar or is there concern? 
  [Sayigh] Of course, there is a certain concern, in addition 
to the love of leadership, considering that Abu-'Ammar loves 
leadership. Leadership is an instrument and a means to attain 
power. Money is an additional means. Even if he does not seek to 
steal, he can channel projects and contracts, and things like 
that. What is sad is that Palestinian businessmen have refused 
to participate in the council and have told Abu-'Ammar: It is 
not right that we will be able to make bids when we are council 
members. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Do the aid-granting countries and the World Bank 
object to Abu-'Ammar's role or do they want specialists? 
  [Sayigh] No, they have concluded the accord with the PLO. 
  [AL-SAFIR] What is the objection against Abu-'Ammar? 
  [Sayigh] He may not be chairman of the board of governors. 
This means that the problem is an organizational problem, i.e. 
one cannot be accountable to oneself. [passage omitted]

Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Article by Rachid Drif: "Antiterrorism: the Infernal </F>
Circle"; first paragraph is ALGERIE ACTUALITE introduction] 
  [Excerpts] The terrorist threat remains omnipresent, 
and the dismantling of armed groups by the dozen has not been 
enough to check the violence. The armed movement's leadership 
remains divided and fragmented, and the two underground wings 
that took over the reins of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] 
following its dissolution--Djaz'ara and Salafist--seem to be 
clashing over the question of leadership. Meanwhile, no 
"moderate" official of the dissolved Islamic party has come out 
in favor of negotiations or participation in discussions with 
the Committee on National Dialogue. 
  The communique from Said Makhloufi, the former "military 
official" in Abdelkader Chebouti's Armed Islamic Movement [MIA], 
has the merit of clarity: no dialogue and "armed struggle" until 
the arrival of an "Islamic republic." That communique, according 
to its author, comes in response to a meeting by the Djaz'ara 
(Algerianists close to A. Hachani) that reportedly was held in 
Batna at the behest of Abderrezak Redjam, former "boss" of the 
FIS intelligence department. 
  A. Redjam is also one of the decision makers in the 
"emergency unit," an FIS body established following the arrest 
of Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj in June 1991. That was the unit 
in charge of clandestine tracts and propaganda for the dissolved 
FIS. 
  Redjam, from Batna, had allegedly issued something called a 
declaration "of union" (Bayane el Wihda) reporting that the 
various secret FIS groups (Salafists, the Djaz'ara, and the 
Muslim Brotherhood) were uniting. 
  Makhloufi claims that that union will split up and that only 
the "Salafist path" will remain. Oddly, Makhloufi's remarks 
remind one of early publications by Abdelhak Layada's Armed 
Islamic Group (GIA), in which the emphasis was on the Salafist 
wing in the various armed groups that had united under the 
"single command" of "emir Abou Adlane" following a meeting held 
at the start of 1993. 
  S. Makhloufi is therefore claiming to be one of the 
Salafists--the radicals in the Islamic movement--and he points 
out that an agreement was reached stipulating that the prime 
condition for dialogue would be a return to the electoral 
process. 
  Until recently, however, that was the condition being 
insisted on by the Djaz'ara's emergency unit and repeated in 
every communique from Mohamed Said, one of that wing's leaders. 
  No change in position has been published so far. The 
disagreements between Makhloufi and the Djaz'ara seem to be the 
same as those that divided Chebouti and the "emirs" of the armed 
groups. The latter denied his right to be the supreme leader 
because he did not take part in the "operations." 
  Makhloufi opposes the "politicians" for the same reasons, 
just as he criticizes them for having attempted to negotiate 
with the authorities through M. Merbah and Shaykh Benazzouz 
Zebda. But there is also one fact that he insistently draws 
attention to: Redjam and Said Guechi halted his participation 
and that of Kamreddine Kherbane in meetings by the Majlis 
Echoura following the events of June 1991 because of their 
preparations for "jihad" [holy war]. That was when Makhloufi was 
publishing his "pamphlet on civil disobedience" and going so far 
as to say, in an interview with the newspaper EL KHABAR, that 
"the time for jihad has arrived." Makhloufi is therefore 
excluding the politicians from the decisionmaking center and, at 
the same time, denying the existence of splits among the armed 
groups, a report that he labels brainwashing and manipulation. 
<H5>  Salafists and GIA </H5>
  Since the deaths of Omar El-Eulmi and his brother 
Abdennacer, 
the two "muftis" of Layada's GIA who were killed five months 
apart, and the arrest of Yekhlef Cherrati, the MIA's ideologist 
and author of the first fatwa [Islamic legal ruling] authorizing 
FIS members to commit murder "as part of" the jihad, there has 
been little information about the new mufti or muftis of the 
terrorist groups. 
  In "traditional" organization charts such as the GIA's, an 
"Islamic legislative committee" headed by a "learned man" was in 
charge of issuing various fatwas regarding the activity of the 
groups. 
  That was the theory. In fact, a person with some knowledge 
of 
theology and possessing an audience among the underground 
members would be in charge of "urgent" fatwas as well as 
everyday writings. 
  In the case of Makhloufi's communique, which well-informed 
observers say is genuine, one finds elements apparently inspired 
by ECHAHADA, the GIA's underground bulletin, excerpts from which 
were published by EL-WATAN EL ARABI at the beginning of the year 
and whose source remains unknown. 
  There are similarities in the division into "zones," the 
organization of the movement, and the establishment of internal 
rules and of "legislation" governing the violent units. 
  Ten months ago, ECHAHADA published a set of "bylaws" for the 
GIA in 65 articles, an "exclusive interview" with Layada, and 
"carefully worked out" documents setting forth the organization 
of a national movement. While Layada admitted being the GIA's 
emir, he denied being the author. It would seem that Makhloufi, 
who belongs to the same wing, is drawing his inspiration from 
those documents. The outline of such a Salafist-type 
organization could already be found in the "hard core" of the 
"Allal" group, where there existed, under the "orders" of the 
emir, a coordinator (Layada), a restricted majlis echoura 
(Belbachir, Bouferaa, Bentebbiche, and Zermane, who is now in 
prison and the only survivor out of the four), and an official 
in charge of religious indoctrination (Zeraoui Hammadache, who 
has been arrested). That organization was inspired mainly by 
religious texts, but also by the various experiences of the 
violent groups, examples being the group headed by Mustapha 
Bouyali--the "emir" of El-Achour--who demanded of his movement's 
members the "baya'a," or oath of allegiance, and who, taking his 
inspiration from religion, had formed one of the first "majlis 
echoura" in the Islamic wing in 1982. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Links </H5>
  A GIA document distributed at the beginning of the year 
mentioned a special "recommendation": set up "joint" armed 
operations and establish links between different groups. It was 
that same document, issued by the "western front," which first 
mentioned plans to "strike at foreign investments and then at 
their representatives." 
  The Armed Islamic Movement is fragmented, and despite the 
"efforts" of political leaders or heads of terrorist groups such 
as Layada and Chebouti, both now gone from the scene, plans for 
a structured nationwide organization have failed. 
  But there are small illegal groups that join together for 
specific operations, and terrorists with police records--and who 
are therefore wanted by police--pass from one group to another 
and frequently move from one region to another. 
  Ties and contacts exist between former members of the 
dissolved FIS who have gone underground, and it is all those 
networks that now make up the terrorist web that is so difficult 
to evaluate. The GIA and MIA are only acronyms--the entire 
movement forms an obscure and constantly changing whole with no 
definite lines of organization but with networks that link up 
with each other from time to time. 
  It is possible to begin with one individual and trace one's 
way back to various tiny groups and movements. 
  For example, police arrested a man named Damerdji Kamel last 
12 March for aiding a terrorist group. He has just been 
sentenced to six years in prison. 
  Damerdji was collecting money at the request of his 
brother-in-law, who is none other than Moussa Kraouche, the 
spokesman for the Algerian Fraternity in France (FAF). 
  The sums of money collected in that way were to be turned 
over to a certain Sayeh Attia in Medea. In exchange, Kraouche 
provided Damerdji with a checking account in France. 
  Sayeh Attia, alias "Khan," alias "Younes," has been a wanted 
man for several months. He is considered a "very dangerous 
member" of the armed movement. 
  A native of Ouled Hellal and 37 years old, he is one of the 
perpetrators still being sought in connection with the attack on 
the barracks in Boughezoul that resulted in 18 dead at the start 
of the year. 
  Several soldiers had their throats cut, and the group had 
accomplices inside the barracks. 
  According to investigators in the security services, Attia 
is 
the son of a harki [Algerian soldier who fought for the French 
against Algerian revolutionaries] and a former member of the FIS. 
  One of the group's leaders who is still a fugitive is 
"Djaafar El-Afghani," whose real name is Si-Ahmed Mourad. A 
"repentant" former musician, he is a native of Tablat. Today he 
is considered one of the most formidable terrorists--like Allal, 
known as "Moh Leveilley," with whom he reportedly was in contact 
in their neighborhood in Hussein-Dey. 
  Si-Ahmed Mourad, who was involved in the attack on the 
airport with members of the MIA, has an exploit to his credit 
that tells it all. At the age of 29 years, while operating in 
the Algiers region, he was among the perpetrators of the attack 
on the former minister of defense. According to confessions by 
former members of his group, he made detailed plans for 
kidnapping the three French consular agents that he wanted to 
exchange for Layada, and while living in Algiers, he went to 
Boughezoul for a "big operation." He is the sort of hard-core 
individual for whom violence has no limits: one of the Salafists 
who do not hesitate to slit throats for the "cause." With them 
there can be no dialogue, and everyone, even the Djaz'ara, has 
realized that.

<F P=106> [Article by Khaled Mahrez: "EEC Examines `Algerian </F>
Situation'"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] The foreign ministers of the 12 EEC countries 
yesterday began a 2-two-day meeting in Brussels in the course of 
which the situation in Algeria will be considered, although it 
is not formally inscribed on the agenda. 
  The Twelve will discuss what position to take regarding the 
safety of Europeans living and working in Algeria, as well as 
their position on fundamentalist groups resident or active in 
certain European capitals. 
  The APS Brussels office believes the "Twelve," in today's 
expected communique, will express support for Algeria's efforts 
to combat terrorism and find solutions to its serious economic 
problems, but will demand in exchange a national dialogue on 
major political and economic reform. 
  A diplomatic source in Brussels yesterday disclosed that 
Algeria will be urged to open dialogue with all those willing to 
participate, with all sectors concerned about restoring security 
in the country and opening the way toward a return to 
democratization--"even with moderates in the FIS [Islamic 
Salvation Front], if they have renounced violence and terrorism 
and accept the ground rules of democracy," according to a source 
in the Belgian delegation. "We're not giving the Algerian regime 
a blank endorsement for anything it wants to do; rather it is 
urgent to get on the path of dialogue with people who do not 
resort to violence and assassinations, or who have renounced 
that path," added a source in the French ministerial delegation. 
  A Belgian observer described this stance as "rather positive 
for Algeria," but cautioned that the Twelve have yet to adopt 
this common position on the Algerian question. 
  The deteriorating security situation, especially the new 
strategy of the armed groups--which have begun indiscriminately 
killing intellectuals, members of the security forces, simple 
citizens, and now foreigners residing in Algeria--has shocked 
public opinion in Europe and around the world and made 
governments of those countries realize the threat to their own 
societies posed by instability in Algeria. 
  This change in the position of Algeria's European partners 
is first of all apparent at the political level. While it may be 
true that Europeans are still unwilling to accept the 
nullification of Algeria's elections, neither can they accept 
the killing of innocent people--much less foreigners--as a means 
to achieving political objectives. 
  The European countries, which to varying degree have been 
plagued--in some cases still are--by terrorism, have thus 
condemned terrorist acts committed in Algeria and expressed 
their "sympathy" for the country. 
  The European Parliament has even endorsed a proposal to 
forgive the debts the Algerian Government owes to the EEC, debts 
which total some $6.5 billion. This was a highly symbolic 
gesture of support to Algeria on the part of the Eurodeputies, 
but actual implementation must first be approved by EC executive 
authorities. 
  The Community is said to favor expressing its sympathy for 
Algeria with cold, hard cash, on the condition that Algerian 
authorities commit themselves to solving their political 
problems through a national dialogue and pledge bold economic 
reforms. The communique expected to be published today by the EC 
demands, in exchange for greater economic and financial 
cooperation with Algeria, the opening of a national dialogue, 
acceleration of economic and political reforms, and launching of 
negotiations with the international financial institutions. 
  Mr. Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign affairs minister and 
current president of the Ministerial Council of the Twelve, has 
clearly described Europe's position on the Algerian situation. 
"It is obvious that we will support the democratic sectors and a 
regime that will be opposed to the fundamentalists," he said, 
maintaining that negotiations on economic and financial 
questions will resume once "the Algerians express their resolve 
to move ahead on economic and financial reorientations, which 
will permit us to move quickly to put exploratory talks, 
followed by negotiations in the framework of the Euro-Maghrebian 
dialogue, on the Community agenda." 
  The recent decision of Algerian authorities to negotiate an 
accord with the IMF--a decision that Jacques Delors, president 
of the European Commission, described as "good news"--appears to 
Algeria's western partners to be a step in the right direction. 
  The previous, incumbent, and next presidents of the Council 
of Ministers of the Twelve, i.e., the foreign ministers of 
Denmark, Belgium, and Greece, will visit Algeria in the coming 
weeks, APS has announced, although the purpose of the visit has 
not been disclosed. At all events, it seems Algeria has finally 
broken through the financial blockade that has constrained it 
for the last two years.

<F P=106> [Article by Merzak Tigrine: "Falling Oil Prices: A Bad Year </F>
for Algeria?"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] Algerian oil revenues may fall well below the prime 
minister's forecasts now that the price per barrel is below $14. 
  The large decline in our country's oil revenues will make it 
very difficult to balance the 1994 budget. 
  Mr. Redha Malek's government is experiencing huge 
difficulties in balancing the 1993 budget, as his predecessor's 
optimistic forecasts ($20 per barrel) prove quite unrealistic. 
  In the past few days, prices fell further on the London and 
New York markets. All the efforts of OPEC member countries were 
of no avail. The announcements by the Sultanate of Oman and by 
Egypt that they would decrease their production by 5-10 percent 
had no effect on the market. 
  On the other hand, production increases in Norway (22 
percent) and England (over 2 million barrels per day) 
considerably affected prices. 
  The increase in U.S. crude inventories, and the possible 
resumption of Iraqi exports did contribute to accelerate the 
price drop. Thus, on the New York market on Friday, light sweet 
crude (the reference crude oil in the United States), reached 
its lowest price in six years, closing at $13.91. 
  In London, the Brent dropped somewhat more, closing at 
$13.56. 
  This price drop does not seem to worry too much the OPEC 
chairman, Qatari 'Abdallah Bin-Hamad al-'Attiyah, who believes 
that it was not urgent to hold an extraordinary meeting before 
25 March 1994, when the next OPEC meeting will take place. 
  Decidedly, Mr. Redha Malek's fears are not about to be 
dissipated. His revenue forecasts, amounting to $8 million to 
$8.5 million, may well fail to materialize if the price drop is 
not stopped within the shortest possible time. 
  Another bad year in prospect for Algeria, unless....

<F P=106> [Article by Nabila Amir: "Algiers the Gray: Who's To </F>
Blame?"] 
  [Text] People all over the world pride themselves on the 
beauty and cleanliness of their country, especially their 
capital city, site of the most important exchanges and meetings. 
But what about Algiers, once known as "Algiers the White"? 
  This historic city, a city with a rich legacy, a city of 
beautiful byways lined with enchanting buildings. What has 
become of all those historical treasures? From end to end, in 
every nook and corner, from top to bottom, Algiers is 
unrecognizable; it is no longer the same, the air is no longer 
pure, it smells foul. 
  At a time when emphasis is being placed, all over the world, 
on hygienic problems because of the multitude of epidemics 
raging alike in other countries and in our own, particularly in 
our capital city, an unconscious or deliberately indifferent 
populace may not appreciate the risks to which it is 
exposed--how otherwise can we explain the deplorable state into 
which the city has fallen? 
  Streets are strewn with detritus of every sort, with 
half-open trash bags where well-fed rats multiply at an alarming 
rate. 
  Rarely is a passerby late in the day courageous enough to 
venture on sidewalks alive with this undesirable and very 
menacing "population." 
  Just going from place to place in the capital has become a 
painful ordeal. We have become accustomed to seeing rats the 
size of rabbits and cats as big as dogs. 
  Have our citizens so far lost their civic spirit that they 
use their own doorsteps as refuse dumps instead of cleaning up 
after themselves? 
  The worst part is, everyone blames someone else. The 
citizens 
themselves, of course, must bear part of the responsibility for 
deteriorating conditions. 
  But some of the blame falls too on the authorities concerned 
and on the trash collection services, which let refuse 
accumulate all up and down the streets and sidewalks where they 
constitute "healthy" sites for vermin to breed and multiply. 
  "What a difference there is," one old man tells us, "between 
the population of yesteryear, when Algiers was truly `the White' 
and deserved that name because of the efforts and good 
citizenship of the people, and today's inhabitants, who have 
turned the capital city into Algiers `the Gray,' a place where 
the air is almost unbreathable!" 
  It is well-known that unhygienic conditions are the source 
of 
many diseases. 
  So why aren't people concerned enough to try to avoid its 
propagation? The reappearance of diphtheria in Algeria is 
entirely the result of this negligence. 
  People do not need expensive equipment to make a 
difference--just the will to take a mop and a pail of water to 
clean up their own doorstep and determination not to dump waste 
in the middle of the street. 
  In the domain of health, the inadequacy of our country's 
sanitation infrastructure is well-known. So is the shortage of 
medications, and the high price that must be paid for them. 
  But why do we have to spend our precious few resources on 
things that could have been avoided?! 
  Health is critically dependent on hygiene. Other factors 
also 
enter in, aggravating conditions in certain slum areas including 
well-known quarters such as Bab-el-Oued, Place des Martyrs, and 
Place First of May. 
  Even if the street sweepers came by several times a day, our 
streets would not be clean, for the peanut and cigarette vendors 
continue shamelessly to scatter papers and butts in the street 
instead of automatically throwing them in trash bags. 
  As one woman told us, "cleanliness and responsibility come 
with education. How can you expect a child not to throw waste in 
the street when his mother tosses refuse out the window all day 
long? 
  "The problem goes very deep. You have to attack the problem 
at its roots." 
  There is another problem befouling Algiers: the reeking 
sewage outlets. There is also the invasion of tramps and beggars 
into our capital. Under the arcades, in certain parts of 
Algiers, these homeless have ensconced themselves atop 
ventilation ducts in search of warmth. Passersby must not only 
avoid all the laundry dripping from the balconies but also take 
wide steps to avoid all the urine. 
  These sights are all in plain view in our capital. It is a 
sad spectacle that continues unabated year after year, right 
under the noses of certain culpable authorities, exacerbated by 
the inexcusable behavior of many citizens. Are these people out 
of touch?

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Consumables in Bejaia: The Shortage </F>
Syndrome"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] Shopping has become a complex exercise. And shoppers 
do not always come back loaded with the foods they wanted. 
  Whether asked for pasteurized milk packets, coffee, oil, 
household soap, pasta, sugar, or any other basic consumable, the 
shopkeeper's answer is always the same sharp "oulech," 
accompanied by a pathetic "aouli" ("my dear") as if to apologize 
for the answer. The truth is that Bejaia has seldom experienced 
such a scarcity of such a broad range of products. Usually, even 
when other governorates report tensions, Bejaia barely shudders, 
and that is mostly due to the fear of being affected by 
shortages, which translates into a veiled [sic] sudden increase 
in consumption. The self-defense reflex then works to its full 
extent. The reasons that the governorate is somehow "sheltered" 
are many. The nearby port, the existence of large local 
production units (ENCG, ENAJUC [expansions not given], flour 
mills, etc.), added to a smaller population, estimated to at 
most 1 million, made it possible each time to cope stoically 
with market perturbations. This time, however, things look 
different and are affected by the prevalent feeling of malaise, 
not to say depression, that prevails in the economy as a whole. 
"Lacking raw materials, production units slowed down." 
  "Add to that import reductions, and we had to reach a dead 
end," Mr. Nait-Slimane, general manager of EPIDAL [expansion not 
given], explained, pointing out that his company just marked 
time during the past year. 
  "Partly because of a lack of aggressiveness on the part of 
the EPIDAL GEIC [expansion not given], partly because of import 
restrictions imposed, among others, by the ad hoc committee, and 
mostly because of declining production at national enterprises, 
which are themselves hampered by inadequate import quotas. All 
this brought us this deplorable situation," he commented. It so 
happened, he said, that even traditional safety stocks were 
depleted and are no longer available "to relieve the demand, and 
therefore the pressure on the market. We are forced to sell on a 
day-to-day basis. And seldom does a delivery last more than one 
week," Mr. Zaidi, a sales manager, commented, adding that his 
own company is experiencing the worst problems in getting 
supplies. "It has become a complex exercise, and often we must 
call on our own personal relations; otherwise, we couldn't do 
it," he concluded. Paradoxical as it may seem, however, 
speculation--the consequence of any shortage--has not yet 
appeared, except that a few grocers conspicuously increased 
their prices, asking, for instance, 150 Algerian dinars for 
coffee, 22 for sugar, or 190 for butter; the rest maintained an 
honorable position. It is true also that the workers' 
consumption cooperative system works fully to appease tensions. 
No matter how small the quantities offered for sale, they have 
the merit of being distributed equitably and benefit first those 
who need them. As a result, opportunists fail to attract many 
people if all they have to offer is basic consumables. 
  At any rate, you hardly see any street vendors peddling that 
kind of goods, contrary to what is the case elsewhere, in large 
Algerian urban centers. However, should the tension persist, 
there would be a potential risk threatening the "cooperative 
system" that constitutes a patent factor of equilibrium in 
distribution.

<F P=106> [Article by Z. Aliou Salah: "First International Conference </F>
on Water: Sounding the Alarm"--first paragraph is LIBERTE 
introduction] 
  [Text] A vital element, water is getting increasingly 
scarce. 
  According to statistics, Algerian water consumption 
increased 
from 1,770 cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]] per person per year in 
1955 to 689 m[.sup]3[/] per person per year now. 
  For future years, the most optimistic forecasts count on 
only 
332 m[.sup]3[/] per person per year. The availability of this 
precious resource, essential for economic and social 
development, is therefore quite restricted and will become still 
more so if part of it becomes unavailable because of the urban, 
industrial, and agricultural population or again because of 
constant daily waste. Add to this runaway demographic growth. 
The mobilization, transportation, distribution of water, and the 
preservation of its quality require considerable financial 
resources, which the state cannot go on providing forever at the 
expense of other economic activities. Mr. Zebarene, general 
inspector at the Ministry of Equipment, told Channel 3 that if 
we are to achieve savings, "we cannot continue to manage our 
resources as we are doing now." "Economic tools that deter 
aggression against the water environment and provide incentives 
to save water and make the necessary investments," are 
essential, he said, adding that "everybody's good will alone is 
not enough." To finance the water sector, the Ministry of 
Equipment stated that it would be desirable to adopt rates 
reflecting Algeria's economic realities. For instance, faced 
with the increasing scarcity of what is considered as a source 
of life, optimum management of our water resources remains a 
must. To this end, a conference covering various themes will 
take place today and tomorrow at the headquarters of the 
National Data-Processing Systems Company [ENSI]. 
  "Water resources, the fragility of water, water as an 
economic product, and the organization of the water sector," 
such are the four themes to be considered by the conference. 
This first conference, chaired by Mr. Mokdad Sifi, minister of 
equipment, and attended by the governors of the principal 
Algerian towns, will consider the management of the public 
service, the economics and organization of water production, and 
water distribution. 
  In addition to these specific themes, the conference will 
also consider questions having to do with pollution, storage, 
the collection of underground and surface water, and the role of 
water in the national economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Razik Remila: "Tragedy in Oran Substandard </F>
Housing: 12 Dead, 46 Injured"--first paragraph is LIBERTE 
introduction] 
  [Text] During the night of Saturday (around 2230), the 
people of the old district of El-Bahia awoke to the height of 
tragedy. 
  According to sources very close to the Oran governorate, 12 
dead were reported yesterday around 1800, while the injured 
numbered 46, including four in critical condition who were taken 
to the Oran University Hospital Center where special medical 
teams were formed. 
  On the other hand, yesterday at 1327, press agencies 
reported 
15 dead and 62 injured. 
  In addition, civilian rescue services estimated at 130 the 
number of housing units that were completely destroyed, and 
close to 400 buildings in the area are in danger of collapsing. 
  For its part, the crisis center set up at the Oran DEC 
[expansion not given] indicated that two people who were buried 
under the rubble were found alive and rescued yesterday, early 
in the afternoon. Following the landslide, the Ras El-Ain region 
was declared a disaster area and a civil emergency plan was 
therefore decreed. 
  The buildings destroyed did not withstand the landslide 
because they were built on a hillock: "It is a difficult clay 
soil that can be cleared only with shovels and cranes for fear 
of touching neighboring buildings." 
  Another information from local officials indicated that "all 
the buildings involved were illegal constructions." Add to this 
the very violent wind that blew in the area and contributed to 
the collapse of some buildings. 
  Since Saturday evening, two crisis centers have been set up, 
and two land sites have been cleared to relocate 
disaster-stricken families, who were also provided with tents 
and food. 
  Soon afterward, we learned that yesterday morning the 
Orolait 
Company distributed 1,500 liters of milk and 1,050 rations of 
pasta with cheese to the victims of the disaster. 
  In closing, we would like to mention that, in the middle of 
the night, the Oran governor visited the site of the disaster 
where rescue operations were still in progress.

<F P=106> [Article by Hocine Tafer: "Constantine: City on Its Last </F>
Legs"--first paragraph is LE SOIR D'AlGERIE introduction] 
  [Text] From disaster to disaster, from ruin to more ruin. 
Constantine is sinking deeper and deeper into a deathlike 
torpor. The year just ended has left the old city of Rocher 
tragically stricken, and there is nothing to indicate there is 
hope of arresting continued decline. 
  Constantine--The recent landslide that caused the collapse 
of 
several buildings on Avenue Kitouni and Rue des Maquisards was 
unfortunately only one very small entry in the catalog of 
disasters that has struck this city that is now on its last legs. 
  Housing sites at CILOC [expansion not given] are also at 
serious risk, and urgent appeals from inhabitants over the last 
three years have not yet succeeded in moving the authorities 
concerned. The road that gives access to Bardo, near the old 
slaughterhouse, has been closed to traffic ever since a previous 
ground subsidence long ago, and no one seems concerned about the 
situation. In an entire section of Saint-Jean, Aouinet El-Foul, 
and as far out as the El Menia plain, people live under the 
threat of a catastrophe that could strike at any moment, and 
everyone acts as if nothing were wrong. It probably serves 
little purpose to point out that the alarm was first sounded 21 
years ago. One has only to refer to the small book Memoirs 
of an APC [People's Communal Assembly] President by the 
last real mayor of Constantine, Mohamed Tahar Arhaoui, to find 
these words: "The zone extending from the base of Coudiat to the 
El Menia flatlands is disturbingly unstable. The 1972 landslide 
is etched deeply in the memory of the 1,200 families that were 
relocated into new housing only after many patient years spent 
in so-called temporary housing." 
  In fact, ever since 1972 the old buildings on Rue des 
Maquisards, Avenue Kitouni, Rue Charboneau, etc. had been 
threatened with destruction by the continual land subsidence 
that has also caused increased buckling of the road between El 
Djebbas and the El Menia bridge. And what has been done to 
remedy the situation? Nothing, except to become further 
entrenched in an obstinate "ostrich policy." 
  How could anyone fail to be irritated by the sententious and 
almost obscene speeches made by certain incorrigible "public 
servants"? December 1993: Close to 60 families lost their homes. 
Some of them, living on the sidewalks, are still exposed to the 
rigors of a very harsh winter. With children, wives, and 
oldsters exposed to all the attendant dangers. A dreadful 
situation, which some try to ignore but that cannot be hidden. 
What will become of them tomorrow? 
  Must we wait until the sky falls on our heads again? Alas! 
This is almost certainly the outcome, because local 
administrative authorities seem unable to come up with even the 
rudiments of a plan. True, the country's economic crisis or even 
the security situation might be used to justify the authorities' 
inaction. But still.... All you need do to see the plight of the 
people struggling to survive is turn your head in their 
direction. We tried repeatedly to meet with the president of the 
communal executive delegation, who serves also as head of the 
daira of Constantine, but in vain. A large number of questions 
thus remain unanswered. 
  How can the authorities' abdication of responsibility in the 
face of a city's death agonies be explained? How do they react 
to the sight of goats serenely grazing on...Ben Boulaid avenue? 
Why do more and more huge holes appear with every passing day in 
all the side streets of the city, and even in the principal 
arteries? Go take a look at your Constantine, from El Kantar to 
Bellevue, from Sidi Mabrouk to Bardo, from the Filali settlement 
to CILOC and even downtown. Not one single street has been 
spared. Day after day workers slave away, armed with scaling 
hammers or simple pickaxes, cutting gashes into the city. 
  When evening comes, they put their tools down and leave. But 
they do not come back. Not even the outlying districts, the 
"express" suburbs, have been spared. 
  For more than a month, two strapping young workers have kept 
the main highway virtually impassable. Add to that the 
innumerable piles of refuse springing up almost everywhere. 
Frankly the picture is grim. And all this is happening under the 
noses of the impassive, silent authorities. Their attitude not 
only greatly tarnishes the institutional credibility of 
government but also encourages all sorts of abuses--and reminds 
one of the stereotypical...banana republic. 
  So are we not justified in asking ourselves, in the last 
analysis, whether all this could be part of a calculated plan? 
Isn't it just one more effort to sap what little strength the 
country still has? The idea is perhaps too fantastic, but so is 
the quality of everyday life in a city that has become an 
immense "gypsy" campground, where all sorts of crimes go 
unpunished, where simple good citizenship is trampled underfoot. 
As a matter of fact, isn't it the only city where the head of 
the daira is also the president of the DEC [expansion not 
given]? Who controls whom? Isn't it the only city in the world 
where so-called intelligent humans designed a highway but 
created no access roads? Isn't it the only city where paintings 
of inestimable value were confiscated to gratify the whims of a 
high-level official? 
  Examples of this sort of behavior are almost endless. But 
what good would it do to compile a list? They have well and 
truly decided to ruin this country, and nothing seems able to 
shake them from their purpose. [sentence as published]

  [Text] What do Iran and South Africa have in common? From 
the point of view of the Israeli defense industry, these are two 
countries that stopped being excellent customers after going 
through changes of regime. 
  The tremendous arms purchases that Iran made under the shah 
were cut off when Khomeyni took power. South Africa is in a 
transitional period now, leading to transfering power to the 
black majority, and from being an important customer of the 
Israeli defense industry, it is turning into a serious rival. In 
this race, it is making wide use of Israeli advanced technology. 
  Over the years, foreign sources published many reports about 
the close ties that had been woven between the defense 
establishments in Israel and South Africa. Israel--so it was 
reported--helped South Africa to build an arms industry that 
produces everything from light weapons to warplanes and missile 
boats. 
  Not long ago, the president of South Africa announced that 
his country had also produced six atomic bombs. Foreign sources 
claimed that these weapons, too, were produced with active help 
from Israel, and that in return South Africa had allowed the 
Israelis to test their nuclear weapons within its boundaries. 
THE WASHINGTON POST also claimed that the South African 
authorities sent enriched uranium (which is used to produce 
nuclear weapons) to Israel, so that it will not fall into the 
hands of the blacks when they take power in April 1994. 
  But from a partner and an ally, South Africa has turned into 
a serious commercial rival. Today, at almost every international 
arms fair, it shows off the products of its defense industry. It 
does not even try to blur the source. 
  Its Cheetah jet is a perfect copy of the Israeli Kfir; the 
sea-to-sea missile it produces is the twin brother of the 
Israeli Gabriel; the assault rifle its soldiers carry is another 
version of the Israeli Galil; and even skilled professionals 
have trouble distinguishing between the Israeli pilotless plane, 
Pioneer, and the South African pilotless plane, Siker; or 
between the Israeli pilotless bomber, Harpy, which sails toward 
its target and blows it up, and the South African pilotless 
bomber, Lark. Air-to-air missiles of the Kukri type, 
manufactured in South Africa, are amazingly similar to the 
Israeli Phaeton missiles. And this is just a partial list. 
  Even the advertising the South Africans do for their weapons 
systems is Israeli in character. At the weapons fair that was 
held at the beginning of November in the Emirate of Dubai, there 
was an unusually large number of exhibitors from South Africa. 
The leaders of the South African arms industry explained to 
reporters covering the fair that the international embargo, 
which had been imposed on their country, and was in force until 
not long ago, forced them to develop many systems on their own. 
This kind of advertising has been characteristic until now of 
the sales representatives of the Israeli defense industry. 
  For many years, South Africa was not been able to sell the 
weapons its defense industry produced, because of the 
international embargo imposed on it in protest against its 
apartheid laws. Now, with both apartheid and the embargo lifted, 
markets have opened up for South Africa all over the world. 
  Sources in the Israel defense establishment say that the 
South Africans operating an aggressive marketing system in many 
countries around the world, and it seems that they are ready to 
sell "at any price"--mainly to establish their position as a 
country producing advanced systems. 
  Looking back, was it a mistake to cooperate so broadly with 
the South African arms industry? Opinions are divided on this. 
There are those who argue that South Africa was a good customer, 
and Israel also profited well from cooperation with it. 
According to foreign sources, over the years South Africa 
acquired weapons systems and know-how from Israel that were 
worth more than 5 billion dollars. Others argue that we should 
have taken into account the political changes that were going to 
come in this country, and to maintain our defense cooperation 
with it accordingly. 
  The reports about Israeli engineers who went to South Africa 
to work after the Lavi project was canceled were perhaps a 
little exaggerated, but for many years, South Africa absorbed 
not only finished products from the Israeli defense industry, 
but also much know-how. You see the results now at almost every 
arms fair. 
  "Although so far they have still not caused us any real 
harm, 
they are turning into more than just a mild headache," a senior 
source in the defense establishment said.

<F P=106> [Article by Nadav Shragay: "To Build Jerusalem Eastward"] </F>
  [Text] The information about the Jewish majority in East 
Jerusalem that came out at the end of the Kollek reign somewhat 
obscured the prevailing reality in the metropolitan areas of the 
city. A reverse process is occurring there and the Arab 
majority is growing significantly. 
  Numerous links were formed between the city and its environs 
in a series of known areas. Greater Jerusalem is a metropolis 
whose borders spread north to Ramallah, south to Gush Etziyon, 
east to Ma'ale Adumim, and west to Bet Shemesh. 
  Many settlements in this area have in fact become Jerusalem 
neighborhoods. The jurisdictional area of Jerusalem, on the one 
hand, and the autonomy settlements between Israel and the PLO, 
which are supposed to also apply to the metropolitan area of the 
city, on the other hand, are creating an area of hundreds of 
thousands of dunams, which is, in fact, a gray area, not really 
Jerusalem, at least not according to the definition of 
jurisdictional borders, and not really the autonomy, at least 
not according to the reality on the ground. 
  This gray area now requires an updated definition. There is 
no lack of functional solutions as such or other solutions that 
can apply to this region. It is possible to annex an additional 
area to the municipality of Jerusalem without annexing it to the 
State of Israel. This issue was previously examined and an 
opinion on the matter was submitted to the director general for 
Jerusalem affairs. The metropolitan area can also be included, 
or part of it, in the planning borders of the urban planning 
committee (without annexation). It is also possible to draft 
various models of joint functional administration in the 
metropolitan areas which will enable the continuation of Israel 
supervision of what goes on there. 
  There has already been an Israeli interest in defining the 
metropolitan boundaries and its status in the future and, even 
more, the fixing of facts is clear, principally against the 
background of the Palestinian goal of accelerated building to 
the south, east, and north and the migration of Palestinians 
from the Hebron area to the periphery of Jerusalem. The 
Palestinians are not concealing their plans to build 
peripherally around the city in order to close Jerusalem in on 
three sides and return the city to the status of a city without 
an exit. 
  Ramallah has already quickly expanded toward Jerusalem. In 
the eastern part of the city is a neighborhood continuum 
northward with the Old City to the south. And even Bethlehem 
and Bayt Jala are being connected to Jerusalem on the south. 
The relation of Jews to Arabs in the metropolitan area 
(including Jerusalem) is 50 percent-50 percent. 
  The forecast for the year 2000 is 40 percent-60 percent 
with an Arab majority. The different orientations of the two 
sectors--the Arabs building mainly on the north-south axis and 
the Jews on the east-west axis--adds another dimension of 
competition on the ground. Against this reality, at least for 
the meantime, areas west of Jerusalem that have recently been 
annexed to the city must be granted, and emphasis must also be 
placed on development of the eastern side, and not only for 
political reasons. On the west, forest areas have been 
designated as large reserve lands for west Jerusalem. The 
urbanization of the western area will indeed damage the green 
health of the city and many agricultural areas in `Emeq 
Ha'arzim. It will be very expensive to build on these lands. 
  Against the expense of building and the ecological damage, 
which would be caused on the east, is a desolate rocky area of 
land that is not suitable for anything except an urban 
settlement. The proof of this is that there are thousands of 
young couples and others seeking to live in Jerusalem 
neighborhoods who are finding Ma'ale Adumim a solution for cheap 
housing. Most of the area between Ma'ale Adumim and Pisgat 
Ze'ev is uninhabited, but if settled immediately becomes de 
facto annexation, not de jure, which is not now possible. 
  Another area adjoining the city that is sought and has a 
sparce Arab populace is located to the north and west of the 
city in the area between Ramot and Giv'at Ze'ev. The 
urbanization of this area west toward Mivaseret and Sha'ar Hagay 
does not alter the fact that the central area around which 
Jerusalem has grown is the area of the Old City. Ma'ale Adumim 
is located only 5 km (by air) from the Old City. The new areas 
that have been annexed to the city on the west are much further. 
  Rabin's government, which continues to populate metropolitan 
Jerusalem (Ma'ale Adumim, Efrat, Gush Etziyon, and Giv'at Ze'ev) 
needs to operate in coordination with the Jerusalem municipality 
in order to expand the city eastward. Both have a clear 
interest in separating the defined area as metropolitan 
Jerusalem from the area of the Palestinian self-administered 
territory, and the appropriate time for doing this is now.

  [Text] Madras, Dec. 1--The designated court trying the 
Rajiv Gandhi assassination case today held an exclusive sitting 
to read out the charges framed against five of the accused 
including Murugan alias Sriharan, one of the key accused and 
husband of the first accused, Nalini, and three others who have 
been boycotting the court proceedings. 
  When the court met this morning, three of the 
accused--Shanthan, Ravichandran and Suseendran--who had been 
boycotting the proceedings, were present along with Irumborai 
who could not come to the court during the last sitting on Nov. 
25. 
  Murugan did not turn up at first but appeared after a break 
in the proceedings. The charges were read out to him when he was 
alone in the court. 
  He covers his face: Throughout the 30-minute 
exclusive proceedings, Murugan who had been boycotting the 
proceedings saying that he did not believe that he would get a 
fair trial, neither responded to the court staff's query nor 
accepted the charges against him. He hung his head and covered 
his face with one hand even as the court staff after reading out 
each of the charges repeatedly asked him whether he accepted 
them. 
  Murugan, who did not engage a lawyer for himself, however, 
received a copy of the court order framing charges against all 
the 26 accused after signing the acknowledgement. 
  The bearded Murugan, who usually dressed neatly, was clad in 
a lungi and shirt when he came to the court. He left the court 
immediately after the staff announced that the proceedings were 
adjourned to Dec. 9. 
  Though he did not stand up when the court staff called his 
name, a normal practice followed by all the other accused to 
hear the charges, Murugan stood up as a mark of respect when the 
presiding officer, Mr. S.M. Siddickk, entered the court and 
retired back to his chamber. 
  Earlier, after the charges were read out against the four 
accused, the judge retired to his chamber even as the prison 
authorities tried to bring Murugan to the court. 
  After a 30-minute break, Murugan, accompanied by senior 
prison personnel including the Additional Superintendent of 
Police, came to the court. Following this, the judge came to the 
court again after which the court staff read out the charges 
framed against Murugan. 
  Though the accused remained silent when the court staff 
asked 
whether he pleaded guilty, it will be recorded by the judge that 
the accused did not plead guilty as per Section 228 of the Code 
of the Criminal Procedure. 
  Murugan has been charged under Section 14 of the Foreigners 
Act, Section 6 (1-a) of the Wireless and Telegraphy Act, besides 
the common charges framed against all accused under Section 120 
9B Indian Penal Code (punishment for conspiracy) and various 
Sections of the IPC and provisions of the TADA Act. 
  The other four accused replied in the negative when they 
were 
asked whether they pleaded guilty. They were engaged in a 
conversation for most of the time when the charges against them 
were read out. 
  Why the 'reluctance': Murugan was reluctant to 
come to the court as he did not like to reply in one word to the 
court's query whether he pleaded guilty or not to the charges, 
Mr. V. Elangovan, defence lawyer, who met the accused this 
morning to persuade him to attend the court, said. 
  The accused was also advised by another defence lawyer, Mr. 
T. Ramadoss, who was said to have told him that it was not fair 
to boycott the proceedings after having appeared in the court 
once and argued his case. 
  Stage set for trial: With this, the process of 
reading out the charges to all the 26 accused was completed. The 
stage is now set for starting the regular trial and examination 
of witnesses. The judge did not fix any date for the trial, but 
official sources said it was likely to begin during the second 
or third week of Jan. 
  Barring Mr. Doraisamy, counsel for 13 accused including 
Nalini, none of the other defence lawyers is planning to appeal 
against the trial court order framing charges against the 
accused. 
  With the pre-trial proceedings coming to an end, further 
proceedings including cross examination of witnesses would be 
held in-camera. 
  The two National news agencies, United News of India and 
Press Trust of India were allowed to cover the pre-trial 
proceedings under Section 226 (prosecution presenting its case) 
227 (defence reply to the case) and 228 (framing of charges) of 
the code of criminal procedure. 
  No more press coverage?: Though the recent 
amendment to the TADA Act gives the discretionary power to the 
designated court judge to conduct the trial in open or 
in-camera, it is unlikely that the press would be allowed to 
cover further proceedings in the case. 
  The prosecution was very particular and cautious in not 
disclosing the identity of the witnesses and the details of 
their deposition in the interest of both the accused and the 
case, sources said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Vandana Shiva by Pramod Kumar: "Dump </F>
Dunkel Proposals"] 
  [Text] Dr. Vandana Shiva is a particle physicist, who 
is internationally acclaimed more as a feminist-ecologist and 
has been actively involved in the Chipko and World Rainforest 
movements. She has been a Consultant to the United Nations 
University, Tokyo. Currently, she is Director, Research 
Foundation for Science, Technology and Natural Resource Policy 
at Dehra Dun and Ecology Adviser to the Third World Network. In 
1982, Dr. Shiva left a prestigious job at the Indian Institute 
of Management, Bangalore, to set up an independent research 
institute called the Research Foundation for Science, Technology 
and Natural Resource Policy, in order to contribute more 
effectively to movements like Chipko. The Tehri Dam controversy 
has brought to the fore Dr. Shiva's contribution to human rights 
when she successfully challenged the illegal arrests of Chipko 
activists including women and children. She has initiated a 
national people's programme, Navdhanya, for conserving natural 
resources and conducting people-based research in agriculture. 
The bookCultivating Diversity,was born out of this 
project. Dr. Shiva has authored several books 
includingEcological Audit of Eucalyptus Cultivation; 
Staying Alive: Women, Ecology and Survival in India; Violence of 
the Green Revolution; Third World Agriculture, Ecology and 
Politics;andMonocultures of the Mind: Biodiversity, 
Biotechnology and the Third World. Dr. Shiva is a 
recipient of several awards including the Order of the Golden 
Ark, Earth Day International Award, Global 500 Award and Right 
Livelihood Award also known as the alternate of Nobel Prize. 
  Environmentalist Dr. Vandana Shiva refuses to accept 
the Dunkel Proposals at any cost. She is fighting against it. 
Excerpts from her conversation with ORGANISER on the 
impact of the Dunkel Proposals on the seeds, agricultural 
research and environment. 
  Q: In spite of stiff opposition to the Dunkel Proposals 
Central government appears to have made up its mind to ratify 
it. Your comments? 
  A: This government is going neither with the support of the 
people nor with the conviction that winning the support of the 
people is its duty. When governments think that they come into 
power only with the help of multinational companies and foreign 
agencies they assume that they will not be dismissed as long as 
they can keep the later happy. At the same time they seem to 
forget that they are sovereign governments of an independent 
country and not servants of the World Bank, IMF or GATT. 
  In a democracy if a people make a government they can also 
dismiss it. When a government starts getting monetary help from 
foreign countries to stay in power they stop giving importance 
to national interest. In India it started with the Bofors case. 
I can say with confidence that multinational companies, World 
Bank and IMF have increased corruption in our country. 
  Q: Do you think that the policy adopted by the Central 
government on the Dunkel Proposals is in national interest? 
  A: No, it is absolutely an anti-national policy. Only those 
policies are in national interest which give prime importance to 
our own people's interest. 
  Q: Indian farmers love their seeds as their children. 
They would rather starve than destroy the seeds. In times of 
famine one witnesses people dying of hunger but they would not 
consume their seeds. If the Dunkel Proposals are accepted what 
will be its impact on the indigenous seeds? 
  A: According to an advisor to the World Bank a country in 
which many farmers live is backward. But our country too has 
many farmers because our culture is connected with our soil. We 
have a farming culture which is based on forest culture. "First 
of all the seeds, later our life." This view is fully imbibed by 
our farmers. That is why Indian farmers love their seeds as 
their children. Indian farmers know very well that their freedom 
is connected with their seeds. The day their seeds will be taken 
over by the multinational companies they will become slaves. 
  When the new seeds come into the market, the World Bank 
starts offering grants to the farmers for purchasing seeds. Now 
the World Bank is discontinuing the practice. Having patented 
the seeds it will be compulsory for every farmer to purchase 
seeds only from the multinational companies. If they are not 
able to purchase the seeds, World Bank will give them loans (not 
grants). We will continue to get loans and after ten years the 
pressure of World Bank will increase. Again western countries 
are pressurising us to accept Intellectual Property Rights and 
Patent Rights. Altogether it is a conspiracy to enslave us. 
  Q: The East India Company came to India for business 
and after some time it ruled the country. Is it not a similar 
conspiracy hatched by western countries? 
  A: It is the same situation again. There are only two things 
different now. Then it was only the East India Company; now 
there are 18-20 companies. Secondly the East India Company had 
recourse to gunpowder. Now they do not need gunpower. They want 
to have their man in the finance ministry. Their economics works 
like gunpowder and our finance ministry has been doing the job 
of the gunpowder. I think we are faced with three world 
criminals, World Bank, IMF and GATT. 
  Q: What will be the impact of the Dunkel Proposals on 
our agricultural research? 
  A: The very basis of our agricultural research will be 
destroyed. In my opinion there are two types of agricultural 
research in India. Firstly, that which is done by the farmer 
himself and secondly the scientist's. No farmer in India engages 
in farming without thinking, without understanding and without 
the basic traditional knowledge. Now the Indian government is 
cutting down the funds for the agriculture universities under 
pressure of the World Bank. It is a suicidal step. 
  If the Dunkel Proposals are accepted, the agriculture sector 
will cease to be under our own government. For whom will the 
agricultural scientist then do the research? Multinational 
companies will not do the research themselves. Our Ph.Ds, M.A.s 
and scientists in their research universities will be exploited 
and their talent misused to fool our farmers. In this situation 
indigenous agricultural research will suffer and our farmers 
will have to grow only that which the multinational companies 
provide. 
  Q: At present there are more than 1,800 multinational 
companies in India. More than 300 multinational companies 
entered India after the government implemented the new economic 
policy. These companies have occupied every production field in 
India, which has severely affected our traditional industries. 
Many nationalist organisations and political parties have 
appealed to the countrymen that they should use only indigenous 
goods and boycott the multinational companies' products. Do you 
think it would be right? 
  A: As far as I think what provides jobs and food for people 
is swadeshi. As long as our weavers will not have work, how will 
they subsist? Patronising Pepsi chips will be like taking steps 
against our farmers as our farmers will then be removed from 
production. So I start the swadeshi movement from the people, 
not the products. We should not see what production comes from 
which company. We should see which hands make it. If the hands 
are swadeshi, the product will be swadeshi. 
  Q: Several movements have been launched for the boycott 
of multinational products. Do you think it will affect the 
production of those companies? 
  A: If we continue the movement for the boycott of 
multinational companies, it will destroy the monsters like 
Cargil and Pepsi. I say it without hesitation that an Indian 
attack on these companies will surely affect their production. 
  Q: India has an independent outlook and approach on 
environment. If view of our approach there should be no problem 
of imbalance in ecology and environment. Do you think we can 
preserve our environment without foreign help? 
  A: There is no need for foreign help. Once we start getting 
foreign help for environment, it will not be useful for our 
country. Because the philosophy of the western countries is 
business oriented. Even parent-child relationship is 
materialistic. Their outlook on and approach to life is 
different from ours. They exploit nature; we are only milking it. 
  Q: What role can women play in maintaining ecological 
balance? 
  A: Women have been playing a very effective role in India 
since yore. In our Chipko movement women themselves come 
forward, chiefly very simple village women. Every Indian woman 
has a great philosophy about environment. We should take their 
thinking seriously and also include them in every movement. 
  Q: Basically you are a physicist. How did you come to 
interest yourself in environment and agriculture? 
  A: There are two reasons. The reason for which I had gone 
into the field of physics is the same for my coming into the 
field of agriculture and environment. I am a human being before 
being a scientist. My humanity has brought me into this field. 
  Q: In the past two years you won four international 
awards. How do you feel about it? 
  A: It makes no difference. 
  Q: Whom will you give the credit for this? 
  A: To my parents and my family. With their help I have 
reached this stage. Usually many restrictions are put on the 
woman in our society. But my parents did not confine me to any 
conventions. They helped me at every step. 
  Q: Indian politics has undergone great changes. Old 
parties have lost the support of the people and new parties and 
leaders are coming into power. What do you expect from the new 
parties and the new leaders at this transitional stage? 
  A: There is no worthwhile political leadership in our 
country. Apart from the political parties there are some honest 
and true leaders in social movements. I hope that they would 
lead the fight against fraud and corruption. 
  Q: Although large-scale industries create ecological 
imbalance but in preference to rural industries they are 
necessary for development. Do you see any utility for the rural 
sector? 
  A: We should give due importance to the rural industries 
wherever they can be more useful than the large-scale 
industries. Abolishing the rural industries will never be in the 
interest of Indian economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Parshuram Ray: "Dunkel Forces Us to Import Food"] </F>
  [Text] The Dunkel proposals will place severe limitations 
on the autonomous policy making in the field of agriculture. For 
the first time in the history of independent India, the vital 
sector of agriculture will be subjected to an international 
discipline which has been basically evolved to suit the 
interests and requirements of industrialised countries and which 
shows little understanding of the problems and needs of a 
country like ours where trade considerations are marginal and 
subsidiary and where the process of economic development is 
essential, says Mr S.P. Shukla, former Finance Secretary to the 
Government of India and former ambassador of India and Permanent 
Representative to GATT at Geneva. 
  The main objectives of the Dunkel Draft on agriculture are 
to 
free the agricultural sector from all forms of controls and 
interventions by the government and from all restrictions on 
imports, so that the dominant multinational corporations (MNCs) 
in the agribusiness find easy access to the markets of 
developing countries such as India. 
  Changes are being sought on four fronts: (a) Lowering of 
subsidies given to various agricultural inputs, such as 
fertiliser, electricity and water, (b) importing a given 
percentage of domestic consumption even if the country is able 
to meet its needs from domestic production; (c) introducing 
patent rights in agriculture; and (d) scrapping of priority 
sector credit programmes that would directly affect agriculture. 
  The Dunkel draft also places strict restrictions on the 
subsidation of food, as in India's public distribution system 
(PDS). According to Dunkel, subsidised rations may be given to 
only those fitting certain "clearly defined criteria related to 
nutritional objectives." The World Bank, in various reports, has 
been demanding precisely the same. The Dunkel proposals require 
the countries to maintain the public distribution system only 
through purchase at market price. 
  This means the government cannot interfere with the price 
settlement mechanism, as it can do now. The consequences of 
buying at market price may not be apparent in times of plenty, 
but in times of shortages, compulsion to buy at market prices 
can mean suicidal for the country's ability to procure and stock 
food and release for consumption at subsidised rates. This in 
itself would be enough to push us into a dependence on imports. 
The buffer stocks have been critical in stabilising the prices 
of essential foodgrains. 
  The second threat for the agricultural sector would come 
from 
the open competition with the cheap imports, largely from the 
granaries of the Western countries. The Dunkel proposals 
stipulate minimum market access for imports to be provided by 
the countries which do not import foodgrains. 
  India being only an occasional importer of foodgrains, would 
have to allow imports. In the first year of implementation of 
the Dunkel proposals two per cent of the country's domestic 
consumption would have to be imported and this figure has to go 
up to 3.33 per cent at the end of 10 years. 
  The implications of such compulsory imports are two-fold: 
(a) 
domestic production would face competition from the cheap 
imports provided by MNCs engaged in agribusiness; and (b) 
attempts by the country to achieve self-sufficiency in food 
would be thwarted. 
  The penetration of cheap imports could lead to a diversion 
of 
consumption from local products, resulting in a greater 
dependence on imports. This would cause (a) the uncertainty that 
comes with dependence on imports, and (b) the scarcity of 
foreign exchange required to pay for imports. 
  Implications of a cut in subsidies in the European Community 
whose subsidy on agriculture amounts to something like $200 
billion are being interpreted by the Commerce Ministry as a 
great benefit. A 20 per cent cut in the EC would mean roughly 
$40 billion less subsidy in the EC. This cut will get expressed 
in the increase in prices of temperate crops and not tropical 
crops which constitute India's export interests. The temperate 
crops include edible oil, wheat, sugar, meat and milk products, 
fruits and vegetables. In edible oil we are not self-sufficient 
and still import a large part of our consumption. 
  The market access compulsion and higher world prices will 
increase our import bill. So also for sugar. Importing at the 
1986-88 level would mean importing significant amounts of sugar. 
As for wheat, rice and major cereals, we are just about 
self-sufficient. And depending upon, whether it has been a good 
crop or bad, we still are on the threshold of importing. So in 
signing the GATT our negotiating position would be not only as 
net exporters but with the stagnant growth of foodgrains after a 
period of 15 years, we may even become net importers. Thus 
higher world prices of these commodities will be to our 
disadvantage and not advantage. 
  According to Mr S.P. Shukla: "The most draconian aspect of 
the new discipline is in the area of domestic support regimes. 
The industrialised countries have enjoyed, for a long time, 
complete autonomy in the management of their agriculture. They 
pursuade strong and complex regimes of domestic support policies 
through direct state intervention as well as indirect support 
measures. 
  Having reached a stage where agriculture constitutes a very 
small component of their economy both in terms of their national 
product as well as the employment potential, and also having 
reached a stage where the trade angle is far more important for 
their agriculture, they have now prescribed a strict discipline 
on domestic support which has to be followed by everybody." 
  Between 1982-1987, Japan extended 72.5 per cent subsidy to 
its farmers, the European Community 37 per cent, and the US 
26.17 per cent. Whereas India extended a negative subsidy of 
2.23 per cent, i.e., India taxed its agriculture. 
  Introducing intellectual property rights (patents) in 
agriculture would have far-reaching consequences. In the 
developing countries any improvement brought about in the plant 
varieties are not considered an exclusive private property of 
the individual or organisation undertaking this activity. 
Developed countries on the other hand give exclusive rights to 
anyone developing new varieties of plants or seeds for a 
definite period during which he or she can use the monopoly 
rights to exploit the market. 
  This system, as prevailing in the developed countries, is 
now 
sought to be forced on the developing countries. If this system 
is adopted by the developing countries, the farmers would get 
into a serious problem as agriculture would be based on imported 
varieties as under the Green Revolution in India. The use of 
seeds over which a patent holder may have an exclusive patent 
right would create a permanent dependency. 
  Indeed the rights enjoyed by the owner of the patented seeds 
are such that they do not allow the harvested seeds to be sown 
for the subsequent year's production. Every year the farmer has 
to approach the company supplying the seeds to meet the 
requirements for sowing. The inimical consequences for the 
farmer can be better appreciated when one remembers that all 
major seeds companies in the world today are MNCs which trade 
not only in patented seeds but also in the patented chemicals 
that would have to be used to obtain best results. 
  The advent of biotechnology and the pressures on developing 
countries like India to patent biotechnological innovations has 
given rise to the possibility that domestic agriculture in these 
countries would be facing dependency syndrome. Biotechnology has 
been presented as the future technology for agriculture and is 
being developed in the laboratories of the MNCs. Claims have 
been made (which are largely unsubstantiated) that biotechnology 
has the potential of bringing about rapid increases in 
productivity in agriculture. But the adoption of this technology 
would lead to permanent strings of dependency on the MNCs. 
  The Dunkel proposals have yet another dangerous implication 
for agriculture. The priorities of the financial sector (bank 
and insurance) are being altered through the new rules for trade 
in services which the Dunkel proposals are seeking to introduce. 
Priority sector lending, a policy in banking which many 
countries like India have claimed to follow, would have to be 
discontinued. The agriculture sector, one of the major 
beneficiaries of priority sector lending would be deprived of 
funds. 
  Sweeping changes being attempted through Dunkel proposals 
have met with widespread opposition, especially from the farmers 
worldwide. The Asian women peasants, Korean farmers, cultivators 
in Japan, French farmers (most serious threat to GATT) and 
American people's networks, feel alarmed at the designs to take 
away control of all agricultural inputs--land, seeds, etc.--from 
the hands of small farmers by the powerful agribusiness firms. 
Collectively they are voicing their concern over the attempts to 
control agriculture and the lives of those dependent on it, by 
the corporate interest through seeds. 
  In Korean farmers have launched an anti-GATT campaign to 
resist further opening of Korean markets to rice imports. There 
are reports of various massive protests from Japanese and South 
Korean farmers against rice imports under American pressure, 
(while writing this article December 7, 1993). 
  Mr Shukla who is also co-chairman of the National Working 
Group on patent laws (India) warns: "The long-term implications 
of the threat to autonomous policy-making as a whole are too 
serious to be assuaged by complacent calculations of the present 
level of support, by unsubstantiated and vague hopes about 
increased exports or by private clarifications sought from the 
GATT bureaucrats about some unclear formulations."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No GATT, Without Dunkel"] </F>
  [Text] After the recent G-15 fiasco in Delhi, it is 
heartless to single out India alone for the Third World 
countries' supine surrender as their final act in the Uruguay 
Round talks. The long negotiations over the Generalised 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, incorporating the Dunkel 
proposals, have ended in Geneva, and in Delhi our government, 
having accepted the Geneva document, has defended its decision 
to accept it. It is one thing to accept the new global trade 
regime as a fait accompli and another to espy in it virtues 
which do not exist. When the Minister, in defence of the Geneva 
outcome, talks of globalisation and gain in world trade 
turn-over of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, he is repeating the 
obvious, without hazarding even a guess at India's likely share 
in this rise. What India's agriculture and the pharmaceutical 
industry would lose is by now known. Is there any justification 
for understating this grievous loss? India gains nothing if the 
government's spokespersons gloss over this side of the reality. 
  The West's agribusiness and food industry would gain the 
most--at the expense of Third World farming countries. If GATT 
ensures world trade expansion of even $2 billion a year, that 
would be only one per cent of the world's gross national 
product. A large part of this gain, to judge by the concessions 
the US has extracted under the Dunkel proposals, would go to 
Euro-American food MNCs--BSN Groupe, Unilever NV, UBS, among 
others. These will have ensured access to Asian markets which 
were closed to them. Even the concessions the US was obliged to 
make to the French farmers would give protection to temperate 
zone farm produce, not to the tropical agricultural products. 
Euro-American pharmaceutical companies have reason to celebrate 
the occasion. At last they would be able to extract the pound of 
flesh from countries like India which have made considerable 
progress in being self-sufficient in the manufacture of basic 
life-saving drugs. These MNCs have long been demanding that 
India pay them royalty for "imitating" their unpatented drugs. 
Prices of medicines are bound to increase if the Indian 
pharmaceutical industry is made to cough out royalty for the 
drugs it has long been manufacturing on its own. One only hopes 
that in his natural anxiety to welcome the Geneva outcome the 
Commerce Minister did not understate the effect the new GATT 
regime will have on India's pharmaceutical industry. Already 
Zeneca, a drugs MNC, is talking of the money it would recover 
from Third World "imitators." When France threatened to block 
the Dunkel proposals on farming the US made concessions and the 
European Community loosened the purse strings to give more 
subsidy to French farmers. When Portugal said that it [would] 
walk out rather than endanger its uncompetitive textiles 
industry, the EC allayed Portugese opposition by guaranteeing 
$455 million as compensation for five years. The Indian 
defenders of Dunkel have not said how the Geneva meeting has met 
India's grievances concerning farm produce, compulsory food 
import, patenting of seeds, cut in fertiliser and electricity 
subsidies and the continuance of non-tariff protectionist 
measures affecting low-cost, labour-intensive commodities 
export. While non-tariff measures will continue to deter India's 
export of textiles and stitched garments, European manufacturers 
of better quality clothes will benefit because the raw material 
prices will decline and the Europeans will gain access to the US 
market. If the protectionist wall favouring Europe's chemicals 
MNCs like BASF AG, ICI of the UK, and DSM NV of the Netherlands 
is lowered, these large firms might be persuaded to relocate 
their production units to low-income countries where 
anti-pollution laws are lax, wages low and the governments are 
bending over backwards to please the large foreign companies. A 
similar propulsion for relocation of manufacturing business of 
labour-intensive industrial products may be generated in other 
areas also. Illustratively, textiles unit may move out of Europe 
to seek relocation in Afro-Asia. Some "dirty" industries 
currently under pressure of Europe's anti-pollution laws would 
probably seek new homes in Third World countries. 
  In a world without the cold war and the developing 
countries, 
including the newly industrialised nations, in no position to 
put up a common front against a global trade regime tooled 
largely to favour the OECD countries of the northern hemisphere, 
India alone cannot tilt against the windmills. But what is 
expected of the government of the day is not adventurism but 
frankness--the gumption to tell our people that these are the 
areas where GATT is going to be inequitous to the less developed 
countries, especially India. 
  If the Indians have decided that discretion is the better 
part of valour, the French suffer from no such demoralisation. 
Without the Soviets' shadows over West Europe, the Europeans are 
able to stand up to the US to say that globalisation cannot mean 
Americanisation of the globe, and that Europe's culture is not 
going to be swamped by America's audiovisual floods. France 
blocked the doors to US films, TV and radio outpourings. Unlike 
Indians who have gleefully surrendered to the sky-piracy by 
foreign TV networks, France has managed to exclude the 
audiovisual products from the new GATT. Europe is not going to 
be America's cultural colony. If France has reason to resist 
foreign intrusion of European culture (through opening Europe to 
US films and TV), India had a great deal more at stake in the 
Uruguay Round of talks. The pity of it is that we have stopped 
bothering about our stakes. Had we fought for them and lost, 
that would have been a different matter. It is clear that we 
have no stomach for a fight.

  [Text] Dubayy--According to the annual report of the 
Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation, in 1992, 10 Arab 
countries received more than $12 billion in Arab and 
international loans, grants, and aid to strengthen their 
national economies, promote development and economic reform 
programs, implement industrial projects, and finance various 
governmental purchases. 
  The figures cited in the report show that--of the total aid,

<F P=106> [Article by Salamah Ni'mat: "Amman Disturbed by 'Arafat's </F>
Giving Priority to Agreement With Israel Before Jordan"] 
  [Text] Amman--King Husayn's statements two days ago have 
revealed the extent to which relations between Jordan and the 
PLO have deteriorated in the wake of the PLO's failure to 
coordinate with Jordan, its refusal to approve a bilateral 
economic agreement, and its ignoring Jordan's position on border 
crossings between the Jericho autonomous area and the kingdom. 
  King Husayn's warnings to the PLO of the consequences of 
continued neglect in coordinating with Jordan came as a signal 
that his patience had run out after weeks of repeated calls to 
resume coordination and Mr. 'Arafat's refusal to sign the 
economic agreement with Jordan worked out last November. 
  These statements have been seen as the clearest indication 
of 
Jordan's uneasiness over the repercussions on the kingdom of any 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement in the framework of a peaceful 
settlement. 
  Official Jordanian sources say that King Husayn feels 
offended by the Palestinian leader's insistence on giving 
strategic priority to reaching an agreement with Israel before 
concluding any agreement with Jordan, rather than vice versa. 
These sources point out that Mr. 'Arafat "is trying to 
strengthen his negotiating position with Jordan by agreeing 
first with Israel, instead of strengthening his negotiating 
position with Israel by agreeing with Jordan." Some Jordanian 
officials interpret the Palestinian leadership's position as 
indicating "'Arafat's desire to link the occupied territories to 
Israel, instead of linking them to Jordan." 
  One Jordanian leader asked: "Does Abu 'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] 
intend to cut the umbilical cord between the newborn Palestinian 
entity and Israel and wean the Palestinian economy from its 
current attachment to the Israeli entity?" 
  The Jordanian leader thinks that Mr. 'Arafat is pushing in 
the direction of "full attachment to the Israeli entity, and 
rejects all kinds of accord, integration, and agreement with 
Jordan." He explains that Jordan's reservations about linking 
the occupied territories to Israel spring from the fact that 
such linkage will impose on Jordan relations with the occupied 
territories defined by Israeli interests, rather than by joint 
Jordanian-Palestinian interests. He stresses that Jordan, 
"because of its political, geographic, demographic, and economic 
links to the West Bank, cannot allow its relations with the 
Palestinian entity to be defined by Tel Aviv." He adds that in 
the context of any peaceful settlement with Israel, Jordan 
"wants to deal with Israel as with any other county, not being 
forced to cooperate with it by necessity, but in accordance with 
the dictates of the national interest." 
  In his speech before senior officers of the Jordanian armed 
forces two evenings ago, King Husayn described his meeting with 
Mr. 'Arafat last Thursday evening as "decisive" and said that 
both of them had been "extremely frank." King Husayn gave the 
Palestinian leader until tomorrow, Tuesday, to resume 
coordination "to deal with the required priorities as quickly as 
possible and with the required agreement and clarity. We, for 
our part, said that this was the last chance and that afterward 
we would bear all responsibility separately." 
  Some analysts think that the Palestinian leader's failure to 
coordinate with Jordan at this stage is related to his fear of 
Jordan's future ambitions to "swallow up the West Bank" in the 
context of a more powerful and stable Jordanian regime. They say 
that Abu 'Ammar "sees no rivalry to his leadership of the 
Palestinian people by any other Arab leader except King Husayn, 
who in Jordan now rules the largest concentration of 
Palestinians outside the occupied territories and who was able 
to rule the West Bank with relative success between 1952 and 
1967." Contributing to these fears is the fact that Jordan is 
the only Arab state that has worked to incorporate Palestinian 
refugees and immigrants by giving them the right to 
naturalization, to political activity within the political 
system, and to equality under the Constitution, while the 
majority of Palestinians in Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt have 
remained outside the political systems of these countries, 
however different their demographic makeups may be. 
  The suspicions of the Palestinian leaders are increased by 
the fact that King Husayn has not moved to amend the 
Constitution, which specifies that the West Bank is an 
inseparable part of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, despite the 
1988 decision to break the linkage. This leaves the door open 
for Jordan to reimpose its sovereignty on the West Bank if 
circumstances become favorable. 
  Although some Jordanian politicians show understanding of 
the 
PLO's fears, they warn at the same time that these fears should 
not drive the Palestinian leadership to increased links to 
Israel. 
  A PLO official says that Jordanian fears are "exaggerated" 
and that the future Palestinian entity "is interested in links 
with the Arab world, not with Israel." However, he points out 
that the facts on the ground and over a quarter century of 
economic linkage between the occupied territories and Israel do 
not permit a rapid breaking of the linkage with Israel and 
restoration of the linkage with Jordan.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu Mahir), Fatah Central </F>
Committee member, in Tunis; date not given: "Israel's Tactics in 
the Negotiations Raise Doubt About Its Intentions"--first three 
paragraphs are AL-HAYAH introduction] 
  [Text] The organization delegate and official for the 
occupied territories on the Fatah Central Committee, Muhammad 
Ghunaym (Abu Mahir), stressed the unity of the movement's 
position on the "Gaza-Jericho-first agreement." He said that 
everyone must adhere to the position that has become an official 
Fatah position. 
  However, he explained in an interview with AL-HAYAH in Tunis 
yesterday that recent Israeli policy in the negotiations was 
causing doubt about Israel's intentions to abide by the 
agreement. He said, "We will work through dialogue to stop these 
violations and make Israel abide by the resolutions." 
  The following is the text of the interview. 
  [AL-HAYAH] After signing the declaration of principles 
agreement with Israel, did Palestinians discover that they had 
become embroiled in difficulties over interpretation of the 
content and concepts of the agreement? 
  [Ghunaym] The agreement reflects the balance of forces and 
the circumstances in which it was signed--circumstances 
unfavorable to us Palestinians and to Arabs in general. We went 
to the Madrid conference against the background of the 
post-cold-war balance of international forces, the collapse of 
the Soviet Union, and the Gulf war, which had major impact on 
the Arab body politic. Thus, at the Madrid conference we agreed 
to things we should not have sanctioned had the Arab reality 
been better and the balance of forces undisturbed--for example, 
postponing discussion of Jerusalem, the settlements, and the 
refugee problem. These are questions that will be discussed in 
the final stage. 
  The Oslo agreement did not deviate from the formula on which 
the Madrid conference was based; it did, however, develop that 
formula to the advantage of the Palestinian people and brought 
about gains such as Israeli recognition of the PLO, which means 
recognition of the Palestinian people. Israel's agreement to 
withdraw from Gaza and Jericho constitutes recognition that 
these lands are occupied and not Israel's by right. This, too, 
is a Palestinian achievement. 
  But the agreement also contained many defects and 
shortcomings. This is natural because we did not conclude the 
agreement while we were victorious. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Israel is ignoring the agreement and continuing 
to 
build settlements and confiscate lands. Are these things signs 
of evasion and retreat? 
  [Ghunaym] There is more than one question mark about 
Israel's 
abiding by the agreement and the nature of its intentions about 
implementing the terms of the second stage of the transition 
period--especially regarding the settlements, Jerusalem, 
withdrawal, and the refugees. These harbingers raise doubt about 
Israeli intentions. We expect Israel to persist with these 
tactics, but we will work through dialogue to stop these 
violations and induce Israel to abide by the resolutions. On the 
mass level, protest stands will continue to escalate violently 
as long as this aggression against the land and rights of the 
Palestinian people continues. Thus, there are two methods: one 
official, which is dialogue; the other popular, which is to 
escalate the violence and protest against Israel's policy 
through its army and settlers. The Palestinian response will be 
proportionate to the amount of Israeli violence. 
  The present escalation in the occupied territories does not 
aim necessarily either at destroying the agreement or speeding 
its implementation. The struggle basically is linked to the 
presence of the occupation and will continue according to the 
nature of the circumstances, as long as the occupation and 
settlement exist in Palestinian territory. Israel's 
implementation of the terms of the agreement and handing over 
power to Palestinians will signal the sincerity of Israel's 
commitment and will help calm conditions and turn attention to a 
new stage. 
  [AL-HAYAH] To what extent is the PLO abiding by the terms of 
the agreement at a time when Rabin's government is accusing the 
PLO of not abiding by the tenor of the agreement? 
  [Ghunaym] The Israeli position wants to shrink the powers 
and 
the area of Palestinian national sovereignty in the transition 
period to as little as possible. In other words, it wants to 
make these powers functional. We, however, understand these 
powers as the agreement indicated: that foreign security and 
foreign relations are not the right of the Palestinian 
authority. Thus, the prerogatives must be full. So we hold fast 
to this right. Israel, for its part, is trying to give its own 
interpretation. We think that Israel's logic about this is weak. 
Through negotiations, it may grant the Palestinian position 
because that position agrees with the content of the agreement. 
  [AL-HAYAH] How do you interpret the reserve of international 
organizations regarding the composition of the Palestinian 
economic council? In the context of Palestinian self-rule is 
this reserve foreign interference and tutelage over Palestinian 
structures? 
  [Ghunaym] It is not interference. Rather, certain of the 
parties tried to impose conditions on the mechanism for forming 
the council, but we rejected this. They have recognized and 
approved what we have done. Their terms were rejected, and in 
the end they retreated from them. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Did Israel intend to load the declaration of 
principles agreement with provisions or economic agreements 
aimed at normalization and making the Palestinian economy 
dependent on Israel and a bridge to normalizing Israel's 
relations with the Arab world? 
  [Ghunaym] There still is no real Palestinian economy, 
because 
the occupation confiscated everything. Thus the Palestinian 
economy became, as it were, part of the occupation economy, 
because the occupation joined the Palestinian economy to its 
economy in its occupation stage. In our transition period we 
shall try to achieve Palestinian economic separation, so that 
our economy can be independent from the economy of the 
occupation. After the transition period everything is open to 
discussion. 
  But we must realize that the next stage involves a Middle 
Eastern economic system. Our choice is the Arab option. We will 
work to build an Arab base that moves in two directions: a 
political direction that moves toward unity, and an economic one 
that makes these Arab interests integrated and homogeneous, so 
that our choice of the Middle Eastern system will accord with 
the extent of our national aspirations. As for the apparent 
intertwining now between the Israeli economy and the Palestinian 
economy, the process is to disentangle the Palestinian economy 
from the Israeli economy. It is liberation from the Israeli 
economy, not being attached to it. 
  [AL-HAYAH] The agreement has caused debate in the ranks of 
the Palestinian national movement, particularly at the level of 
the Fatah movement, between opponents and supporters of the 
agreement. To what extent is this debate influencing the 
Palestinian political course? 
  [Ghunaym] The state of debate that has arisen within the 
movement is something natural. It arises from democratic 
practice within Fatah before making a decision. However, when a 
decision is made, there is complete adherence to it, whether it 
expresses one's point of view or differs from points of view. No 
one in Fatah will go against the agreement or hold reservations 
about it, because the position now is a Fatah position, and 
everyone must adhere to it. 
  As for the negotiations, they take difficult forms because 
they are based on differing points of view about texts contained 
in the agreement, despite their explicitness; for each party is 
trying to strengthen its point of view in accordance with its 
understanding of the provisions of the agreement. 
  Israel is obstructing the negotiations through its 
understanding of the subject of security. It seems to want to 
undertake a new occupation of the Gaza Strip through its 
understanding of the security of the settlements. The 
Palestinian side rejects this. Israel always gives itself the 
right to have a presence on the ground, whether on the borders, 
in the settlements, or outside them. All this does not give 
Israel the right to find excuses or justifications for its 
military presence. Nevertheless, Israel has granted the 
necessity of a Palestinian presence at the crossings and on the 
borders. But everything depends on the ability of the 
Palestinian negotiator--on his understanding of the nature of 
the agreement and of what the texts contained in the agreement 
give us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mahmud Sharif, local administration </F>
minister, by Suhayr al-Husayni; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The first question we pose to 
Local Administration Minister Mahmud Sharif concerns President 
Mubarak's call to develop the southern valley and encourage 
investors to direct their projects to the southern governorates. 
How is this done? Is there a defined plan to achieve this? Does 
this plan provide additional incentives to encourage investors 
to develop the southern valley rather than basing their 
operations in Cairo and the surrounding cities? The local 
administration minister responds: 
  [Sharif] Regarding the southern valley, a decision has been 
made at the highest state level to channel development to the 
south. The south has been deprived of vitality for many years, 
given that the focus has been on the capital and the large 
governorates. We are now making a maximum effort to channel the 
bulk of development to the south. The state's role in achieving 
this centers on support of social services in the southern 
governorates, such as health, education, infrastructure, 
utilities, and sewerage. That leaves production, which is an 
important, vital part that can provide new jobs for young people. 
<H5>  Developing the Southern Valley </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] Jobs in the governorates of Upper Egypt are 
perhaps limited for young people, who tend to migrate to the 
capital in search of work. 
  [Sharif] Therefore, we are trying to create jobs in the 
southern governorates by providing social services. In other 
words, when we build a school, hospital, or offices for service 
providers, we provide new jobs for young people. We are also 
creating jobs through production projects that will be 
established there. The private sector will play a primary role 
in establishing these projects. To achieve this, we have begun 
to establish a number of industrial zones, including one in the 
governorate of Sawhaj, one in the governorate of Asyut, and 
three in the governorate of Bani Suwayf. 
  [Al-Husayni] Are these industrial zones being established in 
the governorates or in the new cities, which are considered an 
extension of these governorates? 
  [Sharif] This is being done in accordance with each 
governorate's circumstances. For example, we have established an 
industrial zone in the new city of Bani Suwayf in the 
governorate of Bani Suwayf, and another zone in Sawhaj, east of 
the Nile. We are taking into account the creation of new 
communities, but we are not moving too far away from the 
infrastructure. These new industrial zones will offer all 
advantages, tax and customs exemptions, unlimited exportation, 
and domestic marketing opportunities. 
<H5>  Additional Incentives in the South </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] Someone who invests in the cities of 10 Ramadan 
and 6 October on the capital's periphery can obtain all of these 
exemptions and benefits. Will additional incentives be offered 
for investing in the southern valley? 
  [Sharif] Nominal land prices are an additional incentive for 
investing in the southern valley. Also, the southern 
governorates are making efforts, under the governors' direct 
supervision, to provide all immediate services required by 
investors in the new industrial zones. We all know that 
investors are most bothered by red tape and having to go from 
one office to another. Therefore, an office subordinate to the 
Investment Authority has been opened in the governorate of 
Sawhaj to make matters easy for persons investing in the south. 
  [Al-Husayni] Does the Sawhaj investment office have all 
authorities [to act independently], so that investors do not 
need to refer to the Investment Authority's main office in Cairo? 
  [Sharif] (With conviction) The investment office established 
in the governorate of Sawhaj has all authorities to act 
independently. The investor will not need to refer subsequently 
to the authority's main office in Cairo. Another incentive to 
invest in the south is the ability to acquire land for a project 
at a price equivalent to the cost of utilities. Land is being 
offered to investors in the southern valley at nominal prices. 
  [Al-Husayni] What is the price for a meter of land in the 
industrial cities in the governorate of Sawhaj or Asyut for 
example? 
  [Sharif] In the industrial zone in the governorate of 
Sawhaj, 
for example, a meter cost 50 Egyptian pounds, even though this 
new zone is located only about three or four km from eastern 
Sawhaj. Also, we have built in this new city 14 schools, several 
clubs, and a town for tradespeople. Residential neighborhoods 
are now being built in these new cities, and roads connecting 
them to the governorate are being paved. Also, investors can 
acquire as much land as they wish in these new cities, with no 
maximum limit. As a result, 100 projects have been submitted to 
date to the Investment Authority's Sawhaj office, even though 
the call to develop the southern valley was made just a few 
weeks ago. 
  One main reason for investors' obvious interest in investing 
in the new industrial zones is no doubt President Husni 
Mubarak's speech to inaugurate the session of the People's 
Assembly and Consultative Council. President Mubarak said that 
all projects worth five million pounds or less do not require 
authorization to start operating. Therefore, an investor's mere 
trip to the investment office and completion of a form provided 
by that office is by itself considered authorization to start 
operating. 
<H5>  The Investment Office in Sawhaj </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] By five million pounds, do you mean the value 
of 
the capital with which the project will be established or the 
total value of the project's investments? 
  [Sharif] The value of the capital with which the project 
will 
be established, not the volume of the project's subsequent 
investments. 
  [Al-Husayni] Investors are afraid to start a project without 
taking the measures required by the Investment Authority, 
especially notification of pertinent agencies and obtainment of 
authorizations. They do not want to be surprised, after their 
factories start operating, by inspectors from these agencies 
asking them for permits and authorizations regulating activity 
in industrial facilities. 
  [Sharif] (Confidently and calmly) The reality is that an 
investor, by merely filling in the information requested on the 
form given to him at the Investment Authority's Sawhaj office, 
in effect begins immediately to notify all pertinent agencies. 
For example, the Sawhaj office notifies customs to exempt the 
investor from customs duties. It notifies taxes to open a file 
on the investor and exempt him for 10 years. Then, it notifies 
the notary office, because the investor may need to purchase and 
register land. It notifies social insurance and manpower to 
permit the investor to employ the manpower required for the 
project. It notifies electricity and the governorate to which 
the investor is subordinate if the investor wishes to purchase 
land in the governorate. It notifies the Construction Ministry 
if the investor needs to purchase land outside of the 
governorate's cordon. The investment office does all of this as 
soon as the investor fills out a form given to him by the office. 
<H5>  Approval of 40 Projects </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] Will the Investment Authority's office in the 
governorate of Sawhaj serve all investors in the southern 
valley? Or will investment offices be opened in each governorate? 
  [Sharif] Our goal in the future is to establish an office of 
the Investment Authority in each governorate. We have begun with 
an office in the governorate of Sawhaj. That office is striving 
to provide all facilities to investors in the southern valley. 
  [Al-Husayni] In your estimation, when will these new 
investment projects begin to be implemented in the industrial 
cities in the southern valley? 
  [Sharif] (Smiling with optimism) Actually, investors are 
very 
interested and enthusiastic. The Investment Authority has 
approved 40 projects. I therefore expect that factories will 
begin operating in these new industrial zones in the south 
within a year, God willing. 
  [Al-Husayni] As we move to promote development in Egypt's 
governorates, will the governorates be divided into integrated 
economic regions in geographical planning, instead of being 
treated as independent provinces, to achieve the goals of 
development plans, especially now, when it has become a crime to 
transport goods from one governorate to another? 
  [Sharif] (Responding immediately) First, we need to treat 
this issue in the framework of the economic reform plan with 
which the country is now proceeding. Based on regional economic 
planning, and with a view toward production as an economic 
pivot, we have begun to shift the major load in reform to the 
private sector. Based on these concepts, the dimensions of 
regional planning and development have expanded, because, as you 
said in your question, we cannot study the problem of 
development in Egypt by examining it in each governorate 
separately. This is especially so, because there are very small 
governorates that cannot by themselves generate development 
opportunities. For example, it is difficult to plan development 
in the governorate of al-Qalyubiyah, because development 
opportunities exist there in only two or three projects at most. 
However, development planning becomes more substantive if we 
speak of the greater Cairo area, which includes Cairo, al-Jizah, 
and al-Qalyubiyah. The same applies to the Sinai Peninsula. We 
cannot think about developing North Sinai and South Sinai 
without also considering Ismailia, which extends 30 kilometer 
east of the Suez Canal into the peninsula, and Port Said as 
well. This region should be viewed comprehensively. The Gulf of 
Suez should also be viewed as an integrated, coordinated unit 
for development purposes. We cannot view the governorate of the 
Red Sea or Suez separately. Therefore, when we study a project 
to develop the governorates, it is better to think on the level 
of region, where resources are better integrated. 
<H5>  Regional Planning </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] What is meant by institutional building, and 
how 
is it supported? 
  [Sharif] There is a Regional Planning Authority in the 
Planning Ministry. Its current role is to collect and study the 
governorates' projects to pave the way for implementing them. We 
are now looking beyond this role to one in which the Regional 
Planning Authority begins to formulate comprehensive development 
plans for each region, instead of just collecting them. This 
requires a review of these organizations. There are 26 
governorates in Egypt. These governorates are also divided into 
seven planning regions. We are now stimulating planning activity 
to generate economic integration between the governorates. 
  [Al-Husayni] For a long time, we have disregarded regional 
planning for the governorates. Have measures actually been taken 
to stimulate regional planning activity as you stated? 
  [Sharif] I have asked that the governors, the leaders of 
these regions, begin to meet as a regional council. Three 
councils have actually met and begun to discuss regional 
development plans. These steps are being taken now to achieve 
development at the level of the region, not the governorate. 
<H5>  Decline of Small Industries </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] Even as we strive to encourage small 
industries, 
we see vital industries--tourism and export industries--starting 
to disappear, such as the silk rug industry in the village of 
Abu-Hamam and Akhmim, most of whose output was exported, and the 
industries of Khan al-Khalili, because the older generation of 
craftsmen are more interested in sending their children to 
college to become physicians and lawyers. 
  [Sharif] (Shaking his head in objection) We are using all of 
our capabilities to encourage small industries, based on an 
integrated plan. Six thousand workshops in all of Egypt's 
governorates have been financed with loans totalling 64 million 
pounds. Regarding the silk rug industry you mentioned, the 
Social Affairs Ministry is now purchasing and marketing abroad 
all of the silk rugs produced by tradespeople or families. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Project to Count the Number of Unemployed </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] A propos training, a large training institute 
with major capabilities is subordinate to the Local 
Administration Ministry. Why is its role limited to training 
only local administration workers? Why do we not try to use 
these enormous capabilities to train workers in other sectors? 
  [Sharif] First, this institute was established to train the 
ministry's local administration leaders. Courses are also held 
for local administration officials. For example, housing sector 
workers were given training when the new housing law and 
Egyptian construction code were promulgated. This was done in 
cooperation with the Construction Research Institute. The latter 
is also involved in international activities through its 
cooperation with the Arab League and the Organization of Arab 
and Islamic Capitals and Cities, whose training center is 
located at the institute. Also, two courses were held. One of 
them was in connection with the Arab Development Institute and 
concerned the problem of rural-urban migration. We have numerous 
activity programs. Our policy is that the institute should 
operate continuously and that its capabilities should be 
exploited as much as possible, taking into account that we need 
to complete construction of the institute. Until then, the 
institute can admit only a limited number of trainees. 
  [Al-Husayni] Some time ago, the ministry began cooperating 
with the Manpower and Training Ministry in a project to count 
the unemployed in all governorates with the goal of providing 
jobs for unemployed young people. Then you stopped. Are there 
reasons for that? 
  [Sharif] (Calmly) We stopped, because we actually completed 
the unemployment count in 21 governorates. The other five 
governorates do not have an unemployment problem. 
  [Al-Husayni] Which governorates do not have an unemployment 
problem? 
  [Sharif] The governorates of North Sinai, South Sinai, Red 
Sea, Marsa Matruh, and New Valley [al-Wadi al-Jadid]. 
  [Al-Husayni] Was the count in the governorates restricted to 
college graduates, or did it include all unemployed young people? 
  [Sharif] This count was only for graduates of the 
educational 
track, in other words graduates of universities and intermediate 
institutions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Wa'il al-Abrash, Karim Subhi, and 'Isam 'Abd-al- </F>
Jawad: "Extremists Rule Prison Administration"] 
  [Text] Intervention is immediately required by the minister 
of interior, Major General Hasan al-Alfi! Decisive, rapid, 
immediate, and radical intervention! Extremists' jails have 
become totally chaotic and an absolute farce. The silence about 
them is a crime, and to remain silent is a tragedy. This is what 
is going on in your ministry's jails, Mr. Minister! 

  -  Legal opinions to shed blood and assault criminal 
prisoners: 
  -  Abducting officers and guards in prison cells and releasing 
them only after negotiations with the prison administration; 
  -  A declaration made inside prison: We will kill Christian 
prisoners; 
  -  Extremists deciding to abolish radios, impose censorship on 
newspapers and magazines, and ban children's pictures. 

    After the uproar accompanying the announcement of mediation 
between security forces and the extremists, "decrees" were 
hastily issued by the extremists' leaders in Tarah Penitentiary, 
changing the amirs of certain groups in various Egyptian 
prisons, who had classified themselves as moderate doves, and 
replacing them with hard-line hawks. 
  This affair, therefore, resembled the hasty ministerial 
change. Furthermore, an amir of extremists in prison is only 
appointed by decree from his leaders in Tarah. Not only that, 
but strict instructions were issued in other decrees from Tarah 
to the new amirs to intensify the rules and penalties against 
criminal prisoners, who refuse to join up today, and against 
prisoners affiliated with other movements. These rules are also 
to be enforced against prison guards, including guards and 
officers to be tried in special courts inside prison cells, even 
if it reaches the point of shedding blood by special legal 
opinions. 
  This is nothing new. The extremists are running the prisons. 
  However, what is new is that they have decided to govern 
them 
in a more dictatorial fashion, and their bloody mentality is for 
the purpose of compensating them for their failure to apply 
their ideas in society. 
  In this context, the massacre in Abu Za'bal Penitentiary, in 
which three were killed and 87 criminal prisoners wounded, 
occurred after a trial--conducted by the extremists' amir in his 
prison cell--of five criminals, in which legal opinions to shed 
blood were issued. Used in the massacre were sharp instruments, 
pocket knives, wooden clubs, and faucets and water hoses after 
they were uprooted to be used as weapons. The massacre continued 
for five straight hours. Prison guards were unable to do 
anything except watch. The oddity is that the same prison 
experienced another, no less serious, incident two months ago, 
where some extremists were able to abduct an officer and a guard 
from the guard force. They stripped them of their weapons and 
held them inside a cell, threatening to kill them unless the 
prison administration complied with their demands, or if anyone 
tried to approach them. It took several hours before the two 
were released, after difficult negotiations, during which the 
prison administration promised not to harm the extremists. 
  Before that, one of the extremist prisoners had gouged out 
an 
eye of one of the officers in the prison courtyard because the 
officer had dared to ask him not to make disturbing noises. At 
one time, the most prisoners could do to express complaints and 
issue protests was to bang on the iron doors with aluminum 
dishes and utensils and shout hostile threats, abuse, and 
insults. Today, the extremists protest inside prisons by gouging 
out the eyes of officers and guards, or detaining or killing 
them. Egyptian prisons have had armed clashes between extremists 
and prison administration at one time or another. Mostly, the 
guard force of officers and men are unable to end the 
extremists' rebellion and cannot even enter the cells. If one of 
them dared to enter any cell, he would be trampled by the 
extremist prisoners. Ultimately, this situation requires 
summoning black-uniformed special forces, who use tear gas 
thrown into the cells, and then storm the barracks. The 
extremists' tricks are unable to stop the tear gas. 
  An infamous clash occurred several years ago in al-Qanatir 
Prison, which was like a war between special security forces and 
extremists. The extremists resorted to a clever trick--one that 
only combatants would know--to thwart the effectiveness of the 
tear gas. They placed buckets inside the cells, filled with 
water. As soon as the canisters landed in the cell, they threw 
them into the buckets to try to extinguish them. But, in the 
end, they surrendered because they were unable to continue 
resisting. 
  However, they succeeded in capturing the commander of the 
guard and detained him in one of the cells. They stabbed another 
officer with a sharp instrument and tipped the scales to their 
advantage again. The clash continued until night time. The 
prison commander, Colonel Muhammad Marsa, suffered a stab wound 
in the stomach, and about 100 officers, guards, and extremists 
were wounded before security forces were able to gain control of 
the situation. The rebellious extremists were transferred to the 
Appeals Prison in central Cairo. The oddity is that the clash 
occurred after the extremists announced that they were an 
independent state inside the prison, which would not carry out 
anyone's orders. They declared their insurrection and stated 
they were not obliged to carry out the instructions of the 
prison administration. 
  Their efforts for power do not stop even after their 
arrests. 
They are working to build their hypothetical state behind iron 
bars. They will not accept less than everyone's submission to 
them. 
  The extremists call these clashes, "intifadah." They 
remember 
them as if they were history. They say: "The intifadah of 
al-Qanatir Prison," the Abu Za'bal Revolution, and the battle of 
Tarah." 
  Even inside the prisons, the extremists stir up sectarian 
strife and do not hesitate to kindle it. 
  In al-Qanatir Prison, one extremists clashed and fought with 
a Christian prisoner. A rumor circulated in prison that the 
extremists would kill all Christian prisoners. The Christians 
gathered together inside the prison in a state of alarm and 
despair. When an officer intervened to break up the fight, the 
extremists hit him. The beaten officer went to the area 
director, Brigadier General Muhammad al-Wakil, took off his 
uniform, threw it on the floor, and asked him to restore the 
honor of the police and discipline the prisoners. Brig. Gen. 
al-Wakil asked the group's amir to turn over the prisoner who 
had attacked the officer, so that he could be punished. The amir 
refused, and al- Wakil gave them a 1600 deadline. When the 
deadline expired, he summoned the black-uniformed special 
security forces. They stormed the cellblock and arrested the 
wanted prisoner. 
  The extremists' influence transcends the prison to the 
prisoners' dock in the courtroom. 
  Aside from acrobatics, abuse, and insults that are uttered 
inside the wire cage during the trial, after the session has 
begun the extremists mostly resort to sit-ins inside the cages, 
refusing to return to prison. The security forces encircle the 
cages and point gas canisters at the prisoners, forcing them to 
go to the transport vehicles, but only after long hours of 
negotiations. 
  The extremists' control over Egyptian jails is demonstrated 
by the fact of families inside the prisons. There was the 
Islambuli family and the al-Ramaz family, but the most famous 
was the al-Dumayri family, which totalled eight persons under 
detention. They were called the Al al-Dumayri. 
  Extremists look at criminal prisoners--perpetrators of 
crimes 
of murder, robbery, etc.--with an air of superiority, because 
they consider them corrupt elements. They try to proselytize and 
recruit them to get them to submit to the extremists' 
leadership. Those who refuse to yield are subjected to a special 
trial in one of the cells. They issue decrees and legal opinions 
against them, which could lead to bloodshed, as happened in the 
Abu Za'bal incident. The extremists forbid the criminals to 
listen to the radio, play backgammon or cards, appear in 
Ministry of Interior uniforms, or dress in shorts, as per 
promotion of virtue and suppression of vice. Much of the 
friction and clashes between the extremist and criminal 
prisoners is due to these prohibitions. This is especially true 
when applied to playing backgammon, which the extremists make 
from cardboard, while the dice are cut from the center of a 
bread loaf and distributed among the criminals for 
entertainment. The extremists are not prepared to offer any 
concessions to the criminals regarding these prohibitions. 
  On the contrary, sometime ago through comprehensive strikes, 
they forced the prison administration to gather up all radio 
sets in the possession of criminal prisoners, on grounds that 
the songs coming out of the radios could be heard in the 
extremists' cells. In fact, an officer went to the cells, 
accompanied by a guard carrying a large carton, in which the 
radios were placed. This is a well-known fact that reveals the 
extent of the prison administration's weakness and the 
criminals' passivity vis-a-vis the extremists. 
  However, most of the clashes between extremists and 
criminals 
in Egyptian prisons occur because of the practice of wearing 
Ministry of Interior uniforms, or shorts, by some of the 
criminal prisoners. 
  Moreover, those who write articles and stories inside prison 
are considered by the extremists to be in violation of Islam. 
  In all these cases, they conduct special trials inside 
cells. 
The group's amir issues verdicts to flog the violators. In the 
face of that, a large number of criminal prisoners are forced to 
let their beards grow and to demonstrate loyalty to the 
extremists and their amir, out of fear of their ruthless action. 
The extremists have formed an internal system to censor 
newspapers and magazines that entered prisons. They cut out all 
pictures, even pictures of children, using batteries to do that. 
  Commercial activities, carried on by extremists, have spread 
inside prison. They deal in food, beverages, and tea. In this 
regard, they also have succeeded in making certain special games 
for children, which they then sell during visits. 
  In prison, extremists do not belong to just one movement. 
There is Jihad, the Islamic Group [al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah], the 
Repudiation Movement, the Qutbiyun, and others. Clashes between 
these movements are increasing and, in many cases, turn into 
fistfights and battles with sharp instruments. 
  Putting believers in different movements in the same cell is 
a smart ploy that the security forces use to take advantage of 
the arguments between them. In this way, they can learn new 
information and secrets that might be revealed during their 
debates. 
  Prisons have been the scene of bloody battles among the 
various Islamic movements. For example, when the Salafiyahs in 
al-Istiqbal Prison stated the legal opinion that those who 
murdered the Central Security personnel in Asyut must repent and 
atone for the crime that they had committed, the Islamic Jama'ah 
adherents were furious. They assembled inside the prison and 
gave speeches, analyzing the terrorist deed that they had 
carried out. The scene quickly changed into fist and knife 
fights. Within prison, the extremists do not trust the Muslim 
Brotherhood. They accuse the Brotherhood of being in alliance 
with the administrations of the detention camps, which always 
allows activities in the prisoners' barracks to be led by young 
men belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood also 
plays a major role in negotiations between extremists and the 
camp administration. They are the communications link between 
the administration and extremist groups that refuse to reach an 
understanding with security forces. They insist on chaos, 
strikes, and sit-in strikes in the prison and will not obey 
orders and instructions from authorities. 
  When disputes among the various movements, to which the 
prisoners belong, end up in serious fights and clashes, many of 
these clashes are peculiar and strange. One reason for this is 
that the al-'Azmawiyah Group forbid the killing of insects 
because they are life created by God. They do not permit killing 
them under any circumstances. They reject and condemn this out 
of consideration that they are God's property. It is 
foreordained for man, just as death is total, i.e., by fate and 
divine decree. 
  Battles between the extremists and the al-'Azmawiyah have 
not 
stopped for a single day, but perhaps the most famous and 
strangest was what happened at Abu-Za'bal Prison, when 
fistfights and knife battles broke out between some extremists 
who belonged to Jihad and prisoners from the al-'Azmawiyah 
Group. The clash was caused by mosquitos. 
  The extremists have various movements. Each has its special 
laws, which it tries to apply on the streets, in the homes, and 
even in prisons. Perhaps there, behind bars, was where their 
dreams for power were established. 
  Many of the terrorists' plans are devised, hatched, and 
issued by their leaders from inside jails, which have been 
turned into operations rooms for the extremists. 
  In the case of the assassination of Dr. Faraj Fawdah, one of 
the accused confessed that he had received details of the plan 
from the leader of the military wing, Safwat 'Abd-al-Ghani, 
imprisoned in Tarah Prison and charged in the case of the 
assassination of Dr. Raf'at al-Mahjub. 
  When the prison agency was alerted to the assassination 
plans, bombings, and terrorism that spread on Egyptian streets, 
some of which were coming out of the prisons, it intensified 
measures of custody and sentencing, in order to suppress the 
terrorists. But the extremists threatened the prison commander 
and, in fact, carried out their threats and tried to assassinate 
the commander of Tarah Prison. 
  However, the real joke, revealed through the deficiency of 
the Egyptian prison system, was the number of cases of extremist 
escapes. At the beginning of the year, the amir of the Islamic 
Jama'ah in Bani Suwayf, Ibrahim Muhammad Sayyid Ahmad, was able 
to escape from jail. He dressed in the clothes of a veiled 
woman, brought to him by one of his relatives during a visit. He 
was able, in fact, to leave with the visitors, but the prison 
administration discovered the operation. The police forces 
quickly pursued the amir who was killed by gunfire from the 
prison guards. However, he had in fact gotten outside the prison 
gates. 
  Prior to this, a well-known major escape incident occurred, 
in which extremists 'Isam al-Qamri, Khamis Muslim, and Muhammad 
al-Aswani managed to escape from jail. This incident revealed a 
major defect in Egyptian prisons, led to the resignation of the 
prison agency's director, and changed the guard force and 
administration in Tarah Penitentiary, who were investigated. 
  Despite the fact that the escape plan was simple, its 
organizational level poor, and the resources used by the 
escapees meager, the plan basically relied on the chaos of 
Egyptian prisons. 
  The amazing thing is that there are four authorities that 
supervise, organize, and operate Egyptian prisons. This confirms 
that the regulations are strong and that the creation of a new 
supervisory agency is not required. 

  -  The prison administration, responsible for administering 
the prison's affairs in all its management, financial, culinary, 
health, social, and punitive aspects. It manages the affairs of 
prisoners and the guard force. The prison has a doctor to 
supervise the prisoners' general health. There is a social 
supervisor to solve their problems, a culinary supervisor to 
ensure the safety and suitability of their food. There is 
security supervision represented at the top of the prison 
pyramid by the commander, his deputy, officials, officers, 
noncommissioned officers [NCO], and troops. 
  -  Prison secret police. This is a bureau subordinate to the 
agency, out of consideration that the prison is an independent 
community in itself, where crimes peculiar to it occur and of 
which the prisoner himself is the source. Crimes are committed 
through the visitors who bring in prohibited items to help 
spread corruption inside the jail. Moreover, the crime may be in 
collusion with an NCO or a guard and the prisoner. Therefore, 
prison secret police officers use informers among the prisoners 
to supply them with information. 
  -  State security secret police. They concentrate on political 
prisoners and everything concerning them, either inside the 
prison, during visits, or when being transported. 
  -  Finally, there is the role of the prison guard force which, 
if 
necessary, rely on special support forces to operate with them 
to put down cases of rebellion and riot. These guard forces are 
also supported by forces from Public Security and Central 
Security, if necessary. As for outside prison guard forces, they 
are supported by rapid fire automatic weapons. 

    In the past, the guard forces depended on volunteers in the 
police, but today they rely on troops of the third 
screening--army rejects. The majority of them are illiterate. In 
Egyptian prisons, there are no modern monitoring or control 
systems. Despite the fact that some of these systems were 
installed in Tarah Prison during Sadat's regime, the contracting 
company has not as yet operated them. Officials of the prison 
agency concede the existence of two gaps that contribute to the 
anarchy in Egyptian prisons and aid in allowing knives to get to 
the prisoners. They are: 

  -  Collusion by NCO's and troops because of economic, social, 
and cultural factors. In addition, and more serious than that, 
is the fact that many of these guards are from Upper Egypt and 
rural areas. Clan and family allegiance play a role in the 
occurrence of collusion. In addition, the conscripted guards' 
commitment is temporary and conditional to a definite degree. 
Their illiteracy contributes to inferiority and negligence. 
  -  The second gap is the family visits that are always 
accompanied 
by a desire to bring prohibited items to the prisoner, by using 
all kinds of tricks. 

    In addition, there is a "housing crisis" in Egyptian 
prisons. 
The prison agency is forced to house the political prisoners 
with the criminal prisoners, and clashes occur. 
  According to the latest reports, the present number of 
political prisoners in Egypt, in custody and sentenced, totals 
3,000. We asked an official in the prison agency: How do you 
deal with incidents of disorder and anarchy in Egyptian prisons, 
carried out by extremists who, in fact, control these prisons? 
He replied: "When disorder occurs, such as sit-in strikes, 
strikes, and protests, the prison commander or his deputy must 
intervene, along with his officers, to conduct a dialogue with 
the prisoners and learn the causes of the disorder. In cases 
like these, the degree of maximum readiness, either in the 
prison administration, or the guards, or the secret police, 
rises in accordance with the circumstances. Visits are 
forbidden, additional forces are called in, and a cordon of 
prison guards is placed around the disorderly group." 
  If the disorder is accompanied by acts of violence, 
intervention is done with tear gas or smoke bombs, in order to 
gain control of the situation. The prison agency conducts 
investigations into the incident, and the disorderly are 
punished by isolation, loss of visitor privileges, and are given 
additional work. 
  The prison agency does all this to keep the prisoners from 
gaining control over the jails. Shortly after the recent Abu 
Za'bal massacre, we made a quick visit to the prison. Some 500 
meters from the main gate, there is a black gate on which is 
written "Industrial Security Prison." Close to that was a huge 
sign: "Prison is Discipline, Correction, and Reform." Visiting 
was permitted from 0900 to 1500, and no one needs a permit. Only 
personal identification has to be shown at the gate. Therefore, 
it is extremely easy. 
  Attached to the prison is a long hall to receive visitors. 
This hall measures more than 20 meters long and 10 meters wide. 
The extremists decided to paint it white, which is their 
favorite color. The hall contains a large number of cement 
benches and floor coverings. The daily number of visitors ranges 
from 200 to 300. 
  Only one day before the Abu Za'bal massacre, a prisoner 
named 
'Abd-al-Sattar Rashwan--who was one of the extremists--died 
after an electrical shock while warming food on an electrical 
hot plate in his cell, despite the prohibition against 
electrical hot plates and appliances. 
  We met with a prisoner named 'Ali, a student in Asyut 
University. He told us: "Bringing prohibited items into jail is 
easy and allowed, despite an informer who searches the men and a 
woman who searches ladies. Everything is available in jail, 
especially prohibited electrical appliances. The Islamic Jama'ah 
controls Abu Za'bal Prison. When they meet a political prisoner 
who belongs to another movement, they try to gain control of his 
mind, by entering into dialogues with him over the course of 
weeks. Most of the time the matter ends with his embracing their 
ideas and joining them, willingly or not." 
  The prisoner related a strange story: "One day, I was in 
cell 
26, and I heard voices rejoicing and saying `God is great.' 
Then, one of the extremists called to all prisoners, demanding 
that they say the prayer of thanksgiving, because a prisoner who 
belonged to the Muslim Brotherhood had renounced the 
Brotherhood's ideas and had joined the Islamic Jama'ah, thanks 
to the efforts of Shaykh 'Abdallah." 

  -  Who is Shaykh 'Abdallah? 
  -  "A prominent leader inside prison. His real name is 
different, 
but he likes this alias. He is 45 and leads a group of 
extremists who collect money by force from visitors. Each 
visitor pays 2 Egyptian pounds. This is a tax extorted with the 
knowledge of the prison administration. Mostly the visitors pay 
a larger amount, after being persuaded that this money is being 
collected to buy food and cleaning materials for the prisoners." 
  -  But, how do you buy the food and cook it? 
  -  It is very easy. I have seen Shaykh 'Abdallah reach an 
agreement with a prison guard to buy food on the outside, in 
exchange for a commission on each order. He buys macaroni and 
rice from a street vendor and cans of sauce, which are stored in 
an empty cell that has been vacated because of its 
unsuitability. Prisoners from the Islamic Jama'ah use it like a 
restaurant, cooking the food and distributing it to the group's 
supporters." 
  -  How do you spend your day in jail? 
  -  "I wake up early, because the dawn prayer is compulsory. 
Then, 
one of the brothers helps us memorize the Koran, before we go 
out for free time in the prison courtyard at 0800. After that, 
we assemble in groups and train in karate and Kung Fu, which 
members of the Islamic Group [prefer]. We have breakfast, and 
then the period of religious lectures begins, which continues 
until 1700. During this period, which lasts for nine continuous 
hours, group leaders have an opportunity to gain new recruits 
from among criminal prisoners, trained to deal with the police. 
We are separated from them by barbed wire, but the extremists 
quickly eliminated that as a factor. They go back and forth, in 
order to recruit criminal prisoners, especially those who are 
close to getting out and can be made use of." 

    Therefore, the extremists control Egyptian prisons. Instead 
of their power weakening after they go to jail, the opposite 
happens. Their members increase, because they are successful in 
recruiting criminal prisoners and converting them to terrorists, 
at their own volition or despite themselves. 
  This matter, therefore, requires special consideration after 
the Abu Za'bal massacre. The prisoner in Abu Za'bal revealed a 
surprise when he said: "Extremists refuse to sign their release 
papers; they want to remain in jail for a longer time!"

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Worries About Rise in Prices"] </F>
  [Text] Baghdad, November 7: Iraqi television mentioned that 
the Iraqi National Assembly has decided to include the economic 
situation and wave of price increases on the agenda of its fall 
session, which began yesterday, Saturday. 
  In reports broadcast on television Saturday evening, a 
number 
of deputy ministers of commerce, agriculture, and foreign 
affairs, sought to study ways of handling the price rises and 
efforts to lift the multifaceted sanctions imposed on Iraq since 
the liberation of the governorate of Kuwait in August, 1990. 
  Deputy Speaker Ghanim 'Aziz Khadduri confirmed that 
inflation 
was continuing in the markets, as were price rises, to a degree 
burdensome to citizens and society, despite all the measures the 
government has taken to fight high prices. 
  Five days ago, Iraqi President Saddam Husayn asked 
government 
institutions to stop buying dollars from the local market, in an 
effort to halt the steep rise in the price of the dollar, which 
is considered the major cause of the price rises. 
  Money exchangers in Baghdad say that the price of the dollar 
has stabilized in recent days, at 106 or 107 Iraqi dinars [ID], 
after having reached ID115 at the end of October. 
  The drop in the price of the dinar in the parallel market 
has 
been linked to the rise--ranging from 20 to 70 percent--in the 
prices of basic commodities in recent weeks. The cost of Iraqi 
foodstuff imports is paid in dollars. 
  He indicated that the Iraqi dinar is now officially worth 
$3.20. 
  The recent drop in dinar rates is traceable to the 
suspension 
of talks between Iraq and the United Nations on the sale of 
Iraqi oil in early October. These talks dealt with the sale of 
$1.6 billion worth of Iraqi oil under UN supervision, to fund 
Iraq's imports of foodstuffs.

  [Text] From the time the evildoers issued their resolution 
imposing economic sanctions on Iraq and set a bi-monthly 
reevaluation to discuss the subject of continuing the sanctions 
in the Security Council, they have been "eager" to concoct 
events which they begin to broadcast "innocently" as regular 
news through the "free" and liberal media publicly. Then they 
"develop" the news into newspaper and television reports which 
the Zionist lobby, present on the premises of the parliamentary 
institutions of the US, Britain, and France, seizes, with 
premeditated planning, to comment upon convulsively and 
hatefully, as if the reports were true. They want "steps" to be 
taken against Iraq for having committed these concocted events. 
They allude to the "measures" they know, which we call "the 
cowards' opportunity": the call to continue the economic 
blockade of Iraq, ignoring the humanitarian effects on the proud 
people of Iraq resulting from the oppressive sanctions. 
  The next phase comes, with is official character, as the 
official spokesmen in the American White House, the Pentagon, 
and the British Foreign Office hasten to voice their "disquiet" 
that Iraq has not "complied" with the resolutions of the 
international Security Council, then they begin to conspire in 
the offices and corridors of the international Security Council 
as the permanent delegates of those countries hold "intensive" 
meetings with the other members of the Council to "formulate" a 
new hostile stand against Iraq. There have been media 
appearances and statements prior to the international Security 
Council's next bimonthly meeting, indicating that they have 
reached a draft resolution that they will present regularly and 
speedily, once it is fully ready. So the Council recently 
adopted its hostile resolution to continue the economic 
sanctions against Iraq, without allowing any just voice to ask 
about the extent of Iraq's implementation of the international 
Security Council's resolutions, and what is actually required of 
it to lift the sanctions, besides the publicly announced matters.

  [Text] The task of providing crop seeds is considered one 
of the most important tasks undertaken by the Ministry of 
Agriculture, supplying them for the coming winter growing season. 
  Because of the circumstances of the sanctions, Iraq has a 40 
percent shortfall in its need for certified seeds, that is, 
seeds suitable for planting. 
  The use of non-certified seeds prepared by specialists is a 
process with uncertain results. Last year the validity of this 
view was proved, when the Agriculture Ministry made use of seeds 
from the Commerce Ministry and distributed them to peasants. 
  The director-general of the General Iraqi Company for Seed 
Production explained that there were ongoing operations to sort 
through, examine, and certify the seeds. Wheat seeds were found 
to be a minimum of 96 percent pure, and a maximum of 99 percent 
pure. The certification process was supervised to the end, as 
was the process of distributing them to the peasants. 
  On another front, preparations are now underway for the 
receiving of rice seeds from the company's laboratories in 
Ghammas and Nahr Sa'd. The General Iraqi Company for Seed 
Production has defined standards for this purpose, and the 
peasants were informed of them, as well as of the fixed prices. 
  The same company is currently preparing vegetable seeds, for 
tomatoes and cucumbers for distribution to peasants so they can 
sow them in the winter season with protected and covered crops. 
They are to monitor local tomato seeds in special fields for the 
production of seeds with facilities provided by the company. The 
company has also contracted with a group of field owners in the 
Euphrates region for the production of onion seeds, and they 
will monitor and supervise the fields. 
  For their part, the peasants question the rise of seed 
prices 
in general, particularly for vegetable seeds. They have asked 
many times for permission to keep some of the wheat, barley, and 
other seeds to be sowing-seeds the following season, especially 
as the law of the land forbids that! 
  The Ministry of Agriculture, for its part, came up with many 
plans and programs to make the winter growing season successful, 
to correct mistakes made last year, to seek privatization for 
agriculture in the future, and to encourage peasants to produce 
the harvest itself. 
  There is another view, according to which the government's 
increased purchase prices for some cash crops is a factor in 
encouraging peasants to produce those cash crops that ordinarily 
are not suitable for cultivation in their lands.

  [Text] Correspondents from international and Arab wire 
services, newspapers, and television networks based in Baghdad 
have visited the marsh region in Maysan governorate. 
  Correspondents from Reuter, Agence France-Presse, the XINHUA 
Chinese news agency, Reuter [sic], the Spanish press agency, the 
WTN television network, and periodicals such as SAWT AL-SHA'B 
[VOICE OF THE PEOPLE], AL-DUSTUR, AL-SHAYHAN of Jordan, a 
representative of the Iraqi Press Agency, and an Associated 
Press photographer, came to view the conditions of citizens 
residing in the al-Huwayzah marshes in the governorates. 
  The marsh inhabitants expressed, in chants and songs, their 
love and loyalty to the wise leadership of President Saddam 
Husayn, and their gratitude for his glorious guidance, in order 
to achieve the finest free and honorable way of life. 
  They asserted their absolute readiness to defend great Iraq 
and the unity of his citizens, and to thwart all the imperialist 
and Zionist plots aimed at harming the unity of the citizens of 
Iraq, their present and their future. 
  They condemned the criminal sanctions imposed by the forces 
of evil and hostility on the heroic citizens of Iraq, which 
violated all divine and human standards and laws. 
  The representative of the Iraqi Press Agency said that the 
marsh inhabitants made clear to the reporters their opposition 
to the continued acts of provocation committed by certain 
infiltrators from Iran to commit acts of aggression and 
interference against them. They asked that their voices be heard 
by world public opinion when they sought a halt to the course 
pursued by the rulers of Iran, their violation of good 
neighborly relations, and their infringement on the freedom of 
others. They called upon the Iranians to cease these practices, 
which are blatant aggression against defenseless citizens. 
  They also demanded the exposure of the fraud and false 
claims 
of the hostile media, which are aimed at fracturing the unity of 
the Iraqis and creating dissension among them. They reaffirmed 
that their living conditions are normal, stable, and safe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Bin-Muhammad Sha'ban, deputy petroleum </F>
minister, by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Muscat--The deputy petroleum minister in Oman and 
chairman of the Board of Directors of the Oman Oil Development 
Company, Salim Bin-Muhammad Sha'ban, said that the tour now 
being undertaken by Petroleum and Minerals Minister Sa'id 
Bin-Ahmad al-Shanfari is intended to persuade non-OPEC producers 
to respond positively to the initiative undertaken by the Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] summit to stop the decline in oil 
prices. The Omani oil official added, in an interview with 
AL-HAYAH, that the tour is intended to urge both OPEC and 
non-OPEC producers to reduce their output, absorb the surplus 
oil supply, and reduce the international output ceiling by about 
1.3 million b/d [barrels per day]. 
  The following is the text of the interview: 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] The Omani petroleum and minerals minister 
has 
begun a tour to implement an initiative supported by the summit 
of the GCC countries. Do you believe that the Gulf summit's 
declaration of its readiness to lower the GCC countries' oil 
output will bolster the chances that the Omani initiative will 
succeed in persuading non-OPEC producers to lower their output 
to improve collapsing prices? 
  [Sha'ban] Petroleum and Minerals Minister Sa'id Bin-Ahmad 
al-Shanfari is undertaking a tour to several non-OPEC oil 
producing countries within the context of the decisions arising 
from the GCC summit to salvage and stop the fall of oil prices. 
  As is known, the GCC countries, like most other oil 
producers, depend entirely on oil revenues. Any drop in prices 
has an extreme effect on their development plans, revenue, and 
earnings. 
  Therefore, the kings and heads of state of the GCC countries 
decided to invigorate the initiative to lower output undertaken 
by the sultanate, which had previously announced a five-percent 
drop in its output beginning in January 1994, in the hope that 
it would be emulated by producers inside and outside OPEC. 
Minister al-Shanfari's tour can be viewed primarily in this 
context. It is intended to urge the countries he is visiting to 
help stop the decline in oil prices and to consequently bring 
the OPEC countries themselves to take a similar position. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Is the Omani and Gulf initiative aiming for 
a 
specific output reduction with respect to a single country or 
all producer countries? 
  [Sha'ban] There is no specific target, although the 
sultanate 
does have a specific view regarding a maximum drop in output. 
The sultanate hopes that the initiative will result in a 
reduction in output amounting to 1 million b/d or 1.3 million 
b/d. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some believe that the condition laid down by 
the GCC summit for carrying out its initiative is unrealistic or 
unfeasible because this has not happened in the past and because 
the North Sea oil producers (Britain and Norway) refuse to 
reduce their output or cooperate with OPEC. Do you agree with 
this view? 
  [Sha'ban] I do not believe that this condition is 
unfeasible. 
The GCC summit is aware, as are others, that some producers that 
are benefiting from low prices have no interest in prices rising 
again and are unwilling to cut their output. The GCC countries 
know that, when they stipulated that producer countries reduce 
[their output] by specific quotas, the summit did not have in 
mind, in its decision, countries which have no interest in 
prices not rising. In calling upon all producer countries to 
reduce their output, the summit had in mind countries that share 
the Gulf countries' interest in joining together to salvage 
prices and the market. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Do you believe that the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia and the other GCC countries will join the sultanate in 
lowering output if most of the producer countries agree to 
reduce their output? 
  [Sha'ban] First, the non-OPEC producers need to be 
consulted. 
Minister al-Shanfari's tour is a basic part of this 
consultation, inasmuch as it will include Yemen, Egypt, Syria, 
Russia, and even Norway and Britain. Contacts are also being 
held with a view toward non-OPEC ministers holding contacts with 
several non-OPEC oil producer countries to cover the base of 
non-OPEC producers. After that, we expect that there will be a 
good, positive response. After the results are sorted--and every 
event is subject to discussion--a decision will be made on a 
reduction in OPEC's output and the rate of the reduction. I 
believe that a general, positive tendency exists among all 
producer countries to cut output and improve prices. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] You said that the initiative aims to reduce 
the international oil supply surplus by about 1.3 million b/d. 
Is there a deadline for achieving this target, such as by late 
winter or early fall 1994? 
  [Sha'ban] I believe that if we obtain a positive outcome, we 
can leave the setting of a date or the timing of an announcement 
to cut output to the relevant parties. They will engineer the 
timing, declaration, effective date, and implementation of this 
policy. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Were the GCC countries led to support the 
Omani initiative by the economic difficulties and hardships they 
are experiencing because of the drop in oil prices? 
  [Sha'ban] Without labelling, the GCC countries no doubt rely 
greatly on oil revenues, as do all producer countries, 
especially the developing countries among them. All of them 
share an interest in improving oil prices, because oil revenues 
finance their development plans. All of the GCC countries rely 
on oil revenues to finance all of their development programs and 
to meet their financial obligations. The drop in prices is 
having an adverse effect on these countries' economies. The GCC 
countries are not the only ones suffering from this problem and 
these hardships. But some of the GCC countries are perhaps more 
able and prepared than other oil producing countries inside and 
outside OPEC to endure and cope with this oil crisis, regardless 
of its intensity. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] Will there be a meeting of the oil ministers 
or deputy oil ministers of the GCC countries after Minister 
al-Shanfari's current tour? 
  [Sha'ban] I can say that there will be a meeting. I do not 
know at what level it will be. However, coordination and 
contacts among the GCC countries are certainly ongoing. And the 
GCC countries will be evaluating the results of the tour and the 
OPEC countries' position. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] There have been recurring reports that Oman 
may call for meetings between OPEC producers and non-OPEC 
producers in the IPEC [Independent Petroleum Exporting 
Countries] group to study the position of the oil market after 
Minister al-Shanfari's tour. Are these reports correct? 
  [Sha'ban] I cannot rule out such a possibility, but I cannot 
confirm it. It will depend greatly on the results of the tour. 
Thus, this subject could be studied by Oman together with its 
brothers in the GCC. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghani] When do you expect the initiative to bear 
results and oil prices to improve? 
  [Sha'ban] That depends on the producer countries' 
willingness 
to lower prices [as published]. No one can predict precisely 
when prices will improve, because a multiplicity of intermeshed 
factors underlies the current oil situation. Consequently, an 
improvement in prices depends on the elimination of all of these 
causes, or at least some of them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Alawi Darwish Kayyal, posts, </F>
telephones, and telegraph minister, by 'Abd-al-Wahid al-Qadi; 
date and place not given: "His Excellency Posts, Telephones, and 
Telegraph Minister to AL-DA'WAH"] 
  [Text] Program to modernize kingdom's communication 
network; 10 billion to expand communication network; problem of 
waiting for telephones will disappear in three years; further 
expansion of pager and mobile telephone service; portable 
telephone will be available next year; phenomenon of selling 
communication services will disappear soon; portable telephone 
will be scrambled soon; we will provide service shortly to 
nearly 2,000 villages; phenomenon of sale of communication 
services is unhealthy; complaints published in papers and 
magazines are healthy phenomenon, even though some exaggerate 
problem; expanded portable telephone service will be coded; 
moving kingdom's communication network from old analogue 
technology to new digital technology; we pursue all that is new 
in communication world to introduce from its products whatever 
befits us; overlapping of lines due to some outdated equipment 
that has reached end of its operational lifespan; major program 
to expand communication utility approved by council of ministers 
recently; Those who do are ones who are criticized, whereas the 
idle are mentioned by nobody 
  Recently there has been a lot of talk about the 
communication 
services, which have occupied large space in the media, with 
some criticizing these services and some praising them. Despite 
the ramified talk about these services, which are numerous and 
broad, AL-DA'WAH editorial staff decided to address these 
questions and queries to His Highness Dr. 'Alawi Darwish Kayyal, 
the minister of posts, telephones, and telegraph. The undeniable 
fact is that these questions received the attention of His 
Excellency, who focused light on them point by point, discussing 
them frankly and explicitly, as shown by this dialogue. 
  His Excellency noted that there is a huge program to 
modernize the kingdom's communication network technology, 
stressing that portable [al-naqqal] telephone service will be 
available next year, God willing. His Excellency also pointed 
out that the problem of the long wait that precedes acquisition 
of telephone service in some areas will disappear shortly. He 
also stressed that the ministry is about to expand further the 
pager and mobile [car, al-sayyar] telephone service. The 
dialogue has also covered other points. 
  [al-Qadi] Your Excellency, some authorities have said that 
there is a plan to develop the kingdom's communication means. 
How will this be done? 
  [Kayyal] Yes, there is a program to modernize the kingdom's 
communication network technology to move this network from what 
is known as the analogue technology to the digital technology, 
to which most countries of the world have turned. The new 
technology opens broad horizons for services that can be 
rendered by the network, especially high-speed information 
transmission services. This is the technology that has 
accompanied the world of computers, which have become a 
characteristic of the age in which we live. The fact is that 
this modernization program is a complete and comprehensive 
program. It includes a network of telephone exchanges in all 
parts of the kingdom, a microwave network, an underground cable 
network, and a satellite network, as well as all the subsidiary 
systems and networks connected with these four networks. 
<H5>  Communication Expansion </H5>
  [al-Qadi] Tell us, Your Excellency, about the ministry's 
plan 
to expand telephone service and about future telephone projects, 
their costs, and number of lines. When will they begin, and when 
will they end? 
  [Kayyal] Communications play an influential and effective 
role in our modern life. Hardly anybody can dispense with 
communications in one form or another. Rather, communications 
have become a mainstay of national security, economic 
development, and the social contact. This is why the demand for 
communication services is rising and why the ministry has worked 
to develop a major program to expand the communications utility 
in a manner that enables it to meet the citizens' demand for its 
services. The ministry presented this program to His Majesty 
King Fahd Bin- 'Abd-al-'Aziz, the custodian of the two holy 
mosques, who has given it his noble patronage. The plan has also 
been approved by the Council of Ministers. 
  The size of this expansion amounts to nearly one-half 
million 
lines, and there is a strong possibility that this number will 
be doubled. This program will make up for the deficit in urban 
and rural telephone lines. It will also secure the service to 
nearly 2,000 new villages. This expansion will coincide with the 
program to modernize all components of the existing networks--a 
program to which I referred in the preceding answer. It is 
expected that the costs of both programs will amount to 10 
billion Saudi riyals. 
  God willing, this program will start in 1415 of the Hegira 
[1994] and it will be completed within five years. But it will 
start producing fruits in the second year of the project, i.e., 
in 1416 of the Hegira [1995]. 
<H5>  Posts </H5>
  [al-Qadi] What is new in postal services, and what are their 
future projects? 
  [Kayyal] The postal service has the government's attention 
because it is an important service sector. This is why the 
government supplies it with the requirements it needs to perform 
its role. We in the ministry pursue whatever is new in the 
postal service world to ensure the continued improvement of our 
postal service. This is being accomplished by establishing in 
the various parts of the kingdom postal centers equipped with 
modern postal automation equipment, such as sorting, binding, 
and filling equipment. After building the three main postal 
complexes in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Ad-Dammam--which are the main 
terminals for mail--we proceeded to build similar complexes, but 
on a smaller scale, in the venerable Mecca, the luminous Medina, 
At-Ta'if, al-Qasim, and Tabuk. Postal service premises are being 
now constructed in nine other cities. We will proceed along this 
path gradually until all parts of the kingdom are included. 
  [al-Qadi] What is the mail volume received in the kingdom? 
Are all letters sorted automatically; and what is the letter 
loss percentage, if any? 
  [Kayyal] in 1413 of the Hegira [1992], the postal service 
handled nearly 680 million postal items, including 375 million 
outgoing items and 305 million incoming items. 
  Nearly 60 percent of the mail is sorted automatically. The 
rest is sorted by hand, because it consists of printed 
materials, newspapers, and magazines that have dimensions that 
don't fit into the automatic sorting machines. 
  The loss rate is extremely low, almost nonexistent. If loss 
exists, then it is in the single figures, and it amounts to no 
percentage when compared to the mail volume. 
  [al-Qadi] Many people complain of the difficulty of 
acquiring 
a post office box. Why has this problem not been solved? 
  [Kayyal] Post office boxes are available and located in 
quarters, but not in streets. We are eager to spread them so 
they will be available to every user in the place he wants them 
to be. 
<H5>  Long Waits for Telephones </H5>
  [al-Qadi] When, in the opinion of His Excellency the 
minister, will the long wait to get a telephone line end? 
  [Kayyal] God willing, the wait problem in major cities will 
be solved in two phases: the first during the second half of 
this year and during next year through the urgent expansion 
program being implemented currently. The second will begin in 
1416 of the Hegira [1995] through the approved expansion program 
to which I referred in a previous answer. This means that the 
wait problem will disappear, God willing, within three years. 
Here I would like to point out to my brother citizens that it is 
not as easy as some people imagine to provide the service. Lots 
of money is spent, silent efforts are exerted, and much time is 
consumed to provide the service to a certain area, beginning 
with the building for every telephone exchange and the external 
network boxes, which extend to every street and reach every home 
through trenches dug into the ground, and ending with the means 
that link an exchange to the network and to other exchanges 
within the same city, with exchanges in other cities, and then 
with foreign exchanges. The time needed to do all this is 
estimated at three to four years. 
<H5>  Pager and Mobile Telephone </H5>
  [al-Qadi] What is new regarding the pager and mobile [car] 
telephone service? Will they undergo future expansion? 
  [Kayyal] Yes, they will undergo future expansion. A contract 
has been concluded to expand the general wireless calling 
(pager) network. This expansion will produce fruits at the 
beginning of next year, God willing. A contract will also be 
concluded within six months to expand the mobile [car] telephone 
network capacity greatly. 
<H5>  Portable Telephone </H5>
  [al-Qadi] Is there a plan to introduce other services 
similar 
to the pager service, such as the portable [al-naqqal] telephone 
service, for example? 
  [Kayyal] I have said in a previous answer that the ministry 
seeks to pursue whatever is new in the communications world in 
order to introduce any of this world's new products that befit 
us. Portable telephone service will become available by the end 
of next year, God willing. 
  [al-Qadi] How does Your Excellency view the phenomenon of 
the 
sale and purchase of communication services? 
  [Kayyal] I see it as unhealthy. However, it is a product of 
the imbalance between service supply and demand. Rest assured 
that this problem will disappear shortly, when the new 
capabilities about which I have talked are made available. 
<H5>  Overlapping of Lines </H5>
  [al-Qadi] Some people complain of the overlapping and 
jamming 
of lines when calls are made. What is Your Excellency's opinion? 
  [Kayyal] The ministry is aware of this problem, and it is 
exerting maximum efforts and using all the resources it can to 
eliminate or reduce this problem. It hopes that the problem will 
disappear completely when the modernization and expansion 
programs to which I have referred previously are completed. 
  This problem is due to some outdated equipment in the 
communication network. This equipment has reached the end of its 
operational lifespan; part of it has been in operation for more 
than 20 years and needs to be replaced. The problem is also due 
to the extreme pressure experienced by the network as a result 
of the ever-growing use of this network. 
<H5>  Complaints </H5>
  [al-Qadi] How does Your Excellency view the complaints 
published in the press about communication services? 
  [Kayyal] I see them as a healthy phenomenon, even though 
some 
people exaggerate the matter and some superficialize it. One 
finds people who say that the service standard has deteriorated 
to a level that makes it impossible for one to make any call. Is 
this true? One finds others who say that all that is needed to 
solve the problem is to get a small part from some country and 
all that it takes to get this part is the signature of an 
individual who does not report to his work. This is a form of 
superficiality that is devoid of the simplest rules of logic. 
  We at the Ministry of Posts, Telephones, and Telegraph do 
not 
deny that there are some negatives. But these negatives amount 
to nothing when compared with the positives. If it were not for 
the positives in work, any work, nobody would mention the 
negatives. Anyway, it is a human tendency to talk about the 
negatives. Those who do are the ones who get criticized. Those 
who do not do are mentioned by nobody. 
  [al-Qadi] There are some base-minded people who eavesdrop on 
mobile [car] telephone conversations. What has the ministry done 
about this phenomenon and about protecting conversations? 
  [Kayyal] The current mobile [car] telephone system will be 
scrambled in the near future, and then the base-minded will not 
be able to engage in their disgraceful curiosity. Moreover, the 
expanded mobile telephone system will be totally scrambled.

<F P=106> [Article by Jamal Khashuqji: "Yemen: 'Abd-al-Majid </F>
al-Zandani, an `Afghan' in Decision Making Positions"] 
  [Text] After President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the other 
members of the Presidential Council swore the constitutional 
oath, came the turn of new council member Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zandani. He rose with his impressive stature in traditional 
Yemeni costume and stood out from the others by his thick, 
hennaed beard. Putting his right hand on the Koran, he said: "I 
swear by Almighty God that I will maintain the Book and the 
Sunnah, and that I will maintain the republican system." Before 
he could continue the oath, voices of surprise and even 
disapproval rose from the benches of Parliament; for the shaykh 
had not adhered to the constitutional text, but had added the 
clause, "maintain the Book and the Sunnah." However, he 
continued reciting the oath, disregarding the shouts and 
mumbling. His tone of voice changed. He began to emphasize the 
words, as if defying the objecting deputies: "And I will respect 
the Constitution and the law in what does not violate the Book 
of God and the Sunnah of His Messenger." And, "I will tend the 
interests of the people and maintain the unity, independence, 
and territorial integrity of the country to the best of my 
ability." This behavior came as no surprise. The shaykh is known 
for his strong and vehement positions that have moved him 
throughout his long political life to disagree not only with the 
government, but with others in the Islamic ranks. He is famous 
for following a policy of brinkmanship. Thus far, he has 
succeeded with it. 
  The opposite of what happened would have surprised us more. 
In 1991, the shaykh almost halted the reunification process 
when, under the slogan of "constitutional change before 
unification," he led hundreds of thousands of Yemenis in the 
largest demonstration that modern Yemen had ever witnessed. 
Although unification was a popular demand, the shaykh's 
popularity and speaking ability helped him stand in the way of 
unification and its constitution without losing his broad 
popular base. The Constitution and unity survived, but the 
Yemeni Presidential Council, which at the time was composed of 
the [General] People's Congress and the Socialist [Party], 
appended a clause stipulating that Islamic shari'ah was superior 
to the provisions of the Constitution. 
  The battle of the Constitution has not been the only one in 
the shaykh's life. His Presidential Council appointment, which 
received support in advance from all parties, came as a sign of 
the extent to which positions in Yemen have changed. Yesterday's 
enemies are today's allies. The many lines of contact among the 
three main political parties prevent any analyst from drawing 
easy inferences, however logical they may seem. However, 
al-Zandani's election will not be the end of the road for the 
main leader of Yemen's Islamic movement, who began his political 
life with "the free Yemenis" (Ahrar al-Yaman) in 
Cairo. The project of an Islamic state is the movement's goal, 
although it does not say so explicitly, contenting itself with 
allusive language about an "Islamic society" and an "Islamic 
constitution." One recalls that Hasan al-Banna, the founder of 
the Muslim Brotherhood, chose the land of Yemen as a model land 
for his dream. He might have succeeded in the matter, had it not 
been for the English presence and the Arab League. 
  Yemen's Islamic movement has learned much from its 
accumulated experiences, which began with the 1948 revolution, 
when a Hashimite nominee for the imamate, 'Abdallah ibn 
al-Wazir, attempted to take over the government by force and 
implement a reform program with the assistance of the Muslim 
Brotherhood. The latter had no Yemeni organizations at the time, 
but were represented by an Algerian adventurer named al-Fadil 
al-Wartani. The movement failed, having established in Yemen a 
bad precedent of change by violence and bloodshed. 
  The present-day movement traces its ancestry to the former 
in 
some of its reform ideas and is linked to it by the historic 
figure of "Abu al-Ahrar" (Judge Muhammad al-Zubayri). However, 
it became separated from it in name after the inheritance of 
their grandfather's movement was left to the al-Wazir family. 
The new movement, which will soon be able to celebrate the 
fortieth anniversary of its founding, was characterized by its 
having been started by Yemeni youths who formed the first 
nucleus of the Muslim Brotherhood. However, they never surfaced 
publicly with their organization, but preferred to take cover in 
the shadow of powerful figures, foremost among them Judge 
al-Zubayri. 
  These young people were active in Yemeni expatriate 
communities in the fifties, especially in Egypt, where they 
became disciples of the Muslim Brotherhood's first generation 
and carried their ideas to imamist Sanaa with returning 
students. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid ibn 'Aziz al-Zandani was one of 
the latter. He taught pharmacy in the fifties in Cairo (he was 
slightly over twenty years old), where he arrived after spending 
several months in Aden. "British" Aden at the time was teeming 
with trade and liberal ideas, unlike the conservative imamist 
north, where the shaykh spent the first two decades of his life 
in the Ba'dan district of Ibb governorate, about 170 km south of 
the capital. His father had left his native village of Zandan, 
which is affiliated with the Arhab tribes, when the shaykh was 
still a baby. 
  Thus he spent his childhood in Ba'dan, a Shafi'i 
agricultural 
area, away from the Zaydi tribal milieu to which his tribe of 
Arhab belonged. Arhab is a division of the mother tribe Bakil, 
the traditional rival of the Hashid tribe, which has strong 
influence in Yemen today and is headed by Shaykh 'Abdallah ibn 
Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the House of Representatives and 
leader of the Yemeni Grouping for Reform, to which Shaykh 
al-Zandani belongs politically. 
  It is difficult to assign the shaykh to any particular 
school 
of Islamic law, although he is a jurist expert in the 
[different] schools and their rulings. He prefers to classify 
himself as a follower of the Book and the Sunnah. His opponents 
accuse him of "Salafiyah" and of prejudice against Yemen's 
majority Zaydi legal school. The shaykh has never hidden his 
severity against "doctrinal deviations" in the criticisms he has 
voiced in his lectures. These are recorded on dozens of cassette 
tapes distributed not only in Yemen, but among young people of 
the "awakening" in various Arab countries. Thus it appears that 
the majority have accepted his view as a "reformer." 
  Shaykh al-Zandani spent a number of years in Egypt. He never 
finished his pharmacy course, since politics turned his 
attention away from it, but his studies were sufficient to 
strengthen his interest in religious subjects. He pressed on to 
become a leading expert on the scientific inimitability of the 
Koran. He founded a group concerned with the subject within the 
Islamic World League in Mecca. The group held conferences and 
published books. In Cairo, the shaykh chose the path of the 
Muslim Brotherhood, which he still continues to follow. With 
this goes a populist dimension that makes him resemble the 
Algerian leader Abassi Madani. This has led several times to his 
removal "by mutual agreement" from the organization, since the 
Muslim Brotherhood has another golden rule that goes, "The 
individual can accommodate what the group cannot." Some 
historians make al-Zandani the founder of the movement in the 
north. This is unwritten oral history, for the Muslim Brothers 
of Yemen have not yet written their history. Everyone, however, 
agrees that he was one of the founders, though he assumed 
leadership officially only briefly between 1971 and 1975. The 
shaykh, and the Brotherhood with him, preferred to work in the 
framework of broader organizations or agencies. When the 1962 
revolution took place, they supported it and went along with it 
energetically; but they rallied around Judge al-Zubayri, a 
symbol on which Yemenis agreed, particularly since they were 
confident of their relation with him, having been fellow 
students in Cairo. Al-Zandani became al-Zubayri's assistant and 
lieutenant during years that were decisive in Yemen's history. 
He prepared a special program over Sanaa radio entitled "The 
Revolution and Religion." In it he dealt with a sensitive 
subject to Yemeni consciousness: for although the ruling imam 
had been a tyrant, he continued to hold a legitimate claim for 
many Yemenis, especially for the majority Zaydis. 
  The position of al-Zubayri, and with him the youths of the 
Muslim Brotherhood, was idealistic and too hard for anyone to 
accept. Historically, they were against the imamate, but they 
also opposed the Egyptian intervention and military rule; so 
they aroused hostility to themselves among republicans and 
monarchists, or at least among leaders in both camps. 
Al-Zubayri, and al-Zandani with him, were forced to leave Sanaa, 
which was no longer safe. They sought refuge or became active in 
the tribal areas. Naturally, they chose their own tribe of 
Arhab, to which al-Zubayri, like al-Zandani, belonged. In 1964, 
they founded Hizballah. Al-Zubayri began to expose in his 
powerful poetry the corruption of the Yemeni revolution and its 
failure to realize the people's hopes. Both men called for the 
Egyptians to leave. However, the movement ended with the 
assassination of its founder, Judge al-Zubayri, who fell victim 
to an intertribal clash. Some accused Amir Muhammad ibn 
al-Husayn of arranging the assassination; others accused 
generals in Sanaa, and suspicions also hung over the Egyptians. 
  As civil war continued, the Muslim Brothers stepped aside 
because they were too weak to influence events in the absence of 
al-Zubayri. After the 1967 defeat, calm returned to a Yemen 
racked by the woes of war and the Egyptian army. Judge 
'Abd-al-Rahman al-Iryani took power on 5 November. The Muslim 
Brothers seized the opportunity and began building their 
organization in absolute secrecy. They made efforts to dominate 
education, entered the army and police, and reached sensitive 
positions the effects of which they are still reaping. 
  The main role in this organized activity fell again to the 
Muslim Brotherhood's two real founders in Yemen as a whole. The 
first of these was the southerner 'Umar Salim (Tarmum), who 
migrated to the north after the Socialists took power in his 
country. He fell out with the movement in 1982 and was 
marginalized until he died in isolation last year. The second 
was Yasin 'Abd-al-'Aziz (al-Qabati), the organization's present 
leader. However, al-Zandani, with his powerful, popular 
personality, emerged anew to be appointed general overseer of 
the Brotherhood in 1971. The shaykh once again sought out 
religious scholars. The Brotherhood founded a scholarly 
organization as a grouping of religious scholars. It was headed 
by a well-known judge, Ahmad Salamah. Al-Zandani remained in the 
leadership of the Brotherhood, whose existence no one 
acknowledged. The shaykh became active again as a political 
opponent of al-Iryani. This was something that the Brotherhood 
could not tolerate, as it needed good relations with the 
government. Al-Zandani was therefore removed from the leadership 
(Yasin 'Abd-al-'Aziz took his place) and returned to working 
behind the scenes--this time in the Ba'dan area where he had 
grown up. 
  A second, peaceful coup then took place. Lieutenant Colonel 
Ibrahim al-Hamdi, who took power, extended the hand of peace to 
the Islamic movement and allowed the establishment of an office 
of direction and guidance, headed by al-Zandani. 
  During the period of bloody coups, with the murder of 
al-Hamdi and of (al-Ghashmi) and the coming to power of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the situation in the north was 
unfavorable, especially with the increasing influence of the 
National Front, a leftist opposition movement armed by 
"comrades" in the south. The front almost created a state for 
itself inside Yemen in the Khubban region, which it made its 
base and whence it began expanding, with Sanaa, naturally, as 
its goal. 
  The undeclared Yemeni civil war began in the late seventies. 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih untied the hands of the Muslim 
Brotherhood in the confrontation. They declared a jihad and 
embarked on a real war against the communists. Yemenis still 
have a legacy of heroic songs and stories they tell about the 
battles. 
  The reward consisted of 370 Brotherhood-run institutions 
throughout Yemen with an independent budget and permission for 
Muslim Brothers to infiltrate education, the army, and the 
police. They participated strongly in drafting the national 
covenant, an Islamic constitution that was never implemented. 
After these gains, al-Zandani again left the scene in a 
voluntary emigration lasting about 10 years. There are two 
versions of why he emigrated. The first is that relations 
between him and the leadership soured, so that it became 
necessary for him to leave. The second is that the movement, no 
longer able to tolerate the shaykh's fanaticism and the 
disagreements it caused the movement with government agencies, 
asked him to leave. He spent most of his years of emigration in 
Saudi Arabia, either in Mecca or in Jeddah, where he was active 
with the Islamic World League. He devoted his attention to the 
Afghan jihad, becoming one of its proponents. He made long trips 
to Afghanistan and entered front-line areas with Arab mujahidin, 
among whom Yemenis formed the second largest group, after 
Saudis. He became an adviser and mediator acceptable to most of 
the Afghan leaders. The present Afghan president and his prime 
minister are considered to be his personal friends. 
  His appointment to the Presidential Council may have an 
additional meaning. Yemen's rulers, or at least President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, do not have the complex of sensitivity 
prevalent in many Arab countries to the Islamic movement. In 
Peshawar, relations between al-Zandani and the Palestinian 
Shaykh 'Abdallah 'Azzam became strong. When the latter was 
assassinated in 1989, his disciples and Arab mujahidin followers 
pressed al-Zandani to succeed him in the leadership. However, 
events in al-Zandani's country were fermenting again. The 
Socialists in the south had accepted unification, but had 
imposed a secular constitution, instead of the north's "Islamic" 
constitution, which had never been implemented. 
  After the Gulf Crisis, al-Zandani returned to Yemen by way 
of 
Sudan, where he had a friend, Shaykh Hasan al-Turabi, with whom 
he spent time discussing "the great Islamic concern." Having 
returned to Yemen with the ideas of the Islamic Front, 
al-Zandani announced in September the establishment of the 
Yemeni Grouping for Reform, following an alliance between the 
Islamic movement and the powerful leader of the Hashid tribe, 
'Abdallah al-Ahmar, although the shaykh's name did not appear on 
the grouping's founding committee. 
  Al-Zandani confirmed his popular leadership anew at the 
January 1993 "Unity and Peace" conference, for which he 
mobilized the various forces supporting him. Then he completed 
his battle crowned by the constitutional oath-taking.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Expectations Are That 100 Persons </F>
Will Appear Before Tehran's Courts on Charges of `Economic 
Sabotage'"] 
  [Text] Official sources in Tehran stated yesterday that it 
is expected that more than 100 persons will soon appear before 
the revolution courts on charges dealing with "economic 
sabotage." These persons were arrested during two consecutive 
arrest campaigns that included the capital city of Tehran as 
well as six other main cities. At least 50 persons who work in 
private currency exchange establishments are among those who 
were arrested by the Revolution Guard. 
  Informed sources in Tehran mentioned that a number of 
prominent mullahs [clergymen] may be among those arrested on 
charges dealing with "misuse of foreign currencies." It has been 
mentioned that numerous mullahs had established their own 
private funds, claiming that their purpose was to subsidize the 
propagation of the ideas of the late Iranian leader Ayatollah 
Khomeyni in foreign countries. Permission had been given for 
these funds to maintain accounts in foreign currencies. However, 
the Iranian Government recently stated that these accounts had 
been used for purposes of currency speculation and illegal 
transactions involving the importing of merchandise instead of 
being used to subsidize Khomeyni movements abroad. 
  Among the persons arrested was the director of the Foreign 
Exchange Division of the Bank Tejarat [Commerce], the 
third-largest government bank in Iran, which administers more 
than 60 percent of the currency transactions in the private 
sector. It is believed that two prominent deputies of the 
above-mentioned director were also arrested. The revolution 
judge had issued warrants for the arrest of a number of bank 
officials who work in various foreign capitals. However, it is 
not yet clear how many of these officials have actually agreed 
to return to Tehran to appear before the revolution courts. 
  These arrests are part of an emergency plan established by 
the Iranian Government for the purpose of putting a stop to the 
sharp decline in the value of the Iranian rial[R] vis-a-vis the 
U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies. It should be mentioned 
that the value of the Iranian rial, at the present time, is only 
one-thirtieth of what its value was before the mullahs came to 
power in 1979. Furthermore, Iran's currency has lost about 10 
percent of its value during the past three weeks. 
  One of the reasons for the rapid decline in the value of the 
Iranian rial is the fact that many Iranian merchants are 
scrambling to purchase as much foreign merchandise as they can 
before the coming into effect of the new restrictions on imports 
at the beginning of next March. Recently long convoys of trucks 
have been seen heading south where Iranians can buy foreign 
goods in the "free-trade areas" on the islands of Kish and Qeshm 
and in the Bishin [name as transliterated] area near the border 
with Pakistan. The Iranian Government has permitted each person 
to purchase $2,000 worth of goods manufactured abroad, which are 
exempt from import taxes, provided that the purchase transaction 
takes place in foreign currency. 
  However, the Iranian Government has recently undertaken to 
lower this limit to $200 and to impose more severe restrictions 
for the purpose of preventing organized gangs from buying 
foreign merchandise offered wholesale. 
  One of the plans being studied by the government at the 
present time is the imposition of a total ban on numerous 
imported items, especially electrical and electronic equipment, 
for a period of at least three years, as a means to alleviate 
the crisis of the deficit in the balance of payments which Iran 
is suffering from right now. 
  Iran needs at least $18 billion a year to service its 
foreign 
debts, which total $30 billion, to purchase half of the food 
supplies it needs and to pay for the spare parts and technical 
equipment it needs to maintain its industries that are now being 
operated at reduced production capacity. But because of the 
decline in oil revenues, the nation's total income is not 
expected to total more than $13 billion during the next 12 
months, according to official estimates.

<F P=106> [Interview with Seyyed Hasan Ruhollah 'Alami, a member of </F>
Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami's central committee, by Jihad Salman; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Seyyed Hasan Ruhollah 'Alami, a member of the 
central committee of Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic Unity 
Party] in Afghanistan, visited Lebanon recently as an envoy of 
his party. AL-'AHD met with him shortly before he left to return 
to Afghanistan and spoke with him about key issues in 
Afghanistan. 
  [Salman] Can you apprise us of the political climate in 
Afghanistan since the departure of communist rule? 
  ['Alami] Let me first salute the souls of the martyrs of 
truth, the martyrs of Lebanon and Afghanistan, and the martyrs 
of the Islamic world. 
  After the overthrow of Najibollah's rule and control over 
Kabul, the mojahedin groups met in Peshawar, Pakistan, which is 
considered the center of gravity of the mojahedin because of the 
many Afghan political groups there. 
  Everyone agreed that Sebghatollah Mojaddedi [faction leader 
of Jebheh-ye Nejat-e Melli--the National Liberation Front] would 
be the president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for one 
month and that Borhanoddin Rabbani would assume the presidency 
after him for four months, during which Mr. Rabbani was to 
prepare the climate for general elections, so that the people 
could voice their opinion regarding who was to be entrusted with 
the political program that would determine Afghanistan's future. 
However, Mr. Rabbani unfortunately did not implement the plan 
under which he assumed the presidency for an interim period. 
Instead, he formed a consultative council of influential people, 
comprising his followers and members of this entourage. And he 
did so without at least consulting with the mojahedin movements 
or parties. 
  That complicated problems and deepened disagreements, 
ultimately resulting in battles erupting between the Afghan 
political parties. These parties became divided into two groups. 
One group, loyal to Rabbani, comprises Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic 
Society], Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union] led by 'Abdol Rasul 
Sayyaf, and Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party]--Yunes Khales faction. 
The latter two are Wahhabi groups. 
  The other group includes most of the Afghan opposition 
parties, headed by Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami and Hezb-e 
Eslami--Hekmatyar faction under Golboddin Hekmatyar. 
  At this point, the Islamic republics in Iran and Pakistan 
thankfully sent delegations to resolve the problem. They were 
able to obtain the consent of all of the parties to hold 
negotiations in Islamabad, Pakistan. 
  The Islamabad negotiations produced an agreement between all 
of the political parties in Afghanistan. The agreement 
stipulated that Rabbani remain president of the country and that 
Hekmatyar be appointed prime minister. 
  The agreement was signed in Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi 
Arabia, 
each of whom signed official texts of the agreement. 
  Mr. Rabbani was obligated to set a date for elections after 
preparing the atmosphere, and the people were supposed to elect 
representatives in complete freedom to form a state based on 
these elections. 
  However, the regime's consultative [council], under the 
leadership of Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, Jami'at-e Eslami's military 
commander, and 'Abdol Rasul Sayyaf, the faction leader of 
Ettehad-e Eslami, did not implement this agreement. They voided 
it. The war erupted anew, preventing the government from 
performing its functions in the central capital of Kabul. 
  [Salman] What are the domestic and regional political 
circumstances that produced the Islamabad Agreement? 
  ['Alami] As I have said, Mr. Rabbani, who was appointed to 
be 
president for an interim period after Mojaddedi's presidency 
tenure ended, was not committed to readying an appropriate 
climate for elections. He formed an interim parliament 
representing his interests and was able to ensure his 
reappointment as president of the country for two years. This is 
what most of the other mojahedin movements--such as Hezb-e 
Eslami, Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami, Harekat-e Watani-ye Eslami 
[National Islamic Movement], Jebheh-ye Nejat-e Melli, Harekat-e 
Eslami, and others--objected to. They considered it illegal. 
Battles erupted in Kabul. Then, delegations arrived from 
Pakistan and Iran as reconciliation committees. Immediately 
after the mediations succeeded, former Pakistani Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif called for negotiations in Islamabad. Those 
negotiations led to the Islamabad agreement, which was signed by 
all of the mojahedin movements in Afghanistan and by the sponsor 
countries, Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. 
  Despite the agreement's deficiencies and unfair treatment of 
Hezb-e Wahdat-e Melli [National Unity Party] and many other 
parties, we signed it to achieve a reconciliation in Afghanistan. 
  Regarding the regional factors, it is well known that the 
efforts of our brothers in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in 
Pakistan, despite the difficulty of bringing all of the parties 
together for talks, opened the door to the Islamabad agreement. 
  [Salman] It is said that the Islamabad agreement is a 
minimalist agreement. What are Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami's 
observations regarding the agreement? 
  ['Alami] In the matter of the Islamabad agreement, the 
Pakistanis dealt with the Afghan political reality based on two 
factions, one headed by Hekmatyar and the other by Rabbani. 
Regarding this division, we noted that the problem concerns the 
Afghan people and its representatives in the mojahedin 
movements, not individuals. Also, what was agreed upon was not 
honored. Furthermore, the stature and presence of other 
movements and parties--such as Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami and 
Harekat-e Watani-ye Eslami, which enjoy a strong political, 
popular, and military position--were disregarded and not taken 
into account. We agreed to sign, despite this lack of fairness, 
out of our commitment to our people's interest and the country's 
supreme interests. 
  Then, this agreement was an interim agreement. Its duration 
is coming to an end without the climate having been prepared for 
elections, as the agreement stipulates. 
  [Salman] Could you address the obstacles blocking the 
Constitution Writing Committee that was to be formed under the 
Islamabad agreement? 
  ['Alami] If elections had been held as agreed in Islamabad, 
the people would have formed a committee to write a 
constitution. However, this did not happen. In this regard, Mr. 
Rabbani, as the person directly responsible for holding 
elections, should be asked about the reason for the delay. 
  [Salman] You said that the agreement is an interim agreement 
whose end has approached. What is the solution in your opinion? 
  ['Alami] Officials of the parties should meet to arrive at a 
solution agreed to by everyone, determine the destiny of the 
people and the country, and stop the bleeding. Hezb-e Wahdat-e 
Eslami--through its secretary general, Sheykh 'Abdol 'Ali 
Mazari--has recommended that both Mr. Rabbani and Mr. Hekmatyar 
resign, and that general presidential and parliamentary 
elections be held. 
  [Salman] If this recommendation is not implemented, can the 
present government, as a government of national unity, be a 
forum for dialogue that can produce something new for the future? 
  ['Alami] This is possible, because Mr. Hekmatyar and the 
members of the government meet periodically at Darolaman Palace 
(the center of the government), from which President Rabbani is 
absent for reasons unknown. 
  [Salman] Do Mr. Rabbani's authorities empower him to 
intervene to block a political measure undertaken by the 
government regarding a conciliation? 
  ['Alami] The Jalalabad agreements give authorities to Mr. 
Rabbani and Mr. Hekmatyar. However, due to a lack of cooperation 
on the part of the president of the republic, there was no 
opportunity to exercise these authorities. 
  [Salman] In other words, the authorities given to Mr. 
Hekmatyar remain inactive. 
  ['Alami] This is because the Jalalabad agreements were not 
implemented. They laid the foundation for a practical program to 
implement the Islamabad agreement. 
  Naturally, Mr. Hekmatyar has not exercised the authorities 
granted him in the agreements, because the agreements were not 
implemented, because Mr. Rabbani is blocking them. 
  It is only natural that political alliances in Kabul with or 
against Mr. Hekmatyar will affect the exercise of his 
authorities. 
  [Salman] Does that mean that political alliances play a role 
in impeding implementation of the agreements? 
  ['Alami] Somewhat. 
  [Salman] Do the new ethnic alliances play a negative or 
positive role in this respect? 
  ['Alami] They have a positive effect in pressing for 
implementation of the agreement. The ethnic alliance facing Mr. 
Rabbani comprises more than 70 percent of the Afghan people. Mr. 
Rabbani cannot rely on this element, which was supportive of 
change in the past. Perhaps his evasion of implementing the 
agreements and of holding elections is related to the weakness 
of his alliances. 
  [Salman] Does that mean that ethnic balances have resulted 
in 
the separation of northern Afghanistan? 
  ['Alami] I find that farfetched, because Mr. Rabbani rejects 
this matter. 
  [Salman] In view of all of these givens, in your opinion, 
what is the most appropriate solution for Afghanistan's 
political problem? 
  ['Alami] The only solution is for all the parties to sit 
down 
at the negotiating table. 
  [Salman] It is said that Jami'at-e Eslami, under Rabbani's 
leadership, fears an alliance between Hezb-e Eslami and Hezb-e 
Wahdat-e Eslami, and it feels that it would be excluded from the 
game. What guarantees would you and your allies offer if all of 
the parties sit down at the negotiating table? 
  ['Alami] All guarantees are possible. Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami 
and Hezb-e Eslami are ready to discuss anything, provided that 
foreign powers bent on destroying the Islamic jihad in 
Afghanistan and on discrediting the victory it achieved after 
the termination of communist rule do not interfere. 
  [Salman] Is Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami preparing an initiative 
or 
some mediation in this regard? 
  ['Alami] There are initiatives. Jami'at-e Eslami is well 
aware of this. A number of meetings were held between Hezb-e 
Wahdat-e Eslami and Jami'at-e Eslami. Then, a central delegation 
headed by Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami Secretary General Sheykh 'Abdol 
'Ali Mazari met with Rabbani and Sayyaf. 
  [Salman] What about Jami'at-e Eslami and Hezb-e Eslami? 
  ['Alami] The relationship between Hezb-e Eslami and 
Jami'at-e 
Eslami requires greater trust and better intentions on the part 
of both parties. I think that the failure to implement the 
Jalalabad agreements provides an opportunity for the two to sit 
at the dialogue table. Otherwise, problems are possible. 
  [Salman] In conclusion, we thank you. Do you have a final 
remark? 
  ['Alami] I thank AL-'AHD. I wish, through it, to give a 
salute of respect to the mojahedin of the Islamic resistance in 
Lebanon and the intifadah in Palestine, because they are proving 
and confirming God's sublime utterance, "And [they are] never 
afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault" [Koran 5:57], by 
standing on the front line in the confrontation with American 
and Zionist arrogance and fulfilling their divine mission with 
the utmost pride and honor. We entreat God to grant them victory 
and show them the right way to the victory of his religion.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 17--Apprehending resumption of U.S. 
military aid to Pakistan, members at today's meeting of the 
Parliamentary Consultative Committee on External Affairs 
criticised the proposal to amend the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act. 
  The meeting focussed on the current state of Indo-U.S. 
relations and inquired into the reasons which led to 
postponement of the G-15 summit. 
  In the absence of the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh 
Singh, who was attending the Congress Parliamentary Party 
meeting, the Consultative Committee meeting was jointly chaired 
by the two Ministers of State for External Affairs, Mr. R.L. 
Bhatia and Mr. Salman Khurshid. 
  Drawing attention to the proposed changes in the Foreign 
Assistance Act, members felt the legislation will dilute the 
restrictions on the passage of military and economic aid to 
Pakistan, currently in force under the Pressler Amendment. 
  Targeted against Pakistan, the Pressler Amendment pins 
military aid to Pakistan to a certification by the U.S. 
President that Islamabad does not possess a nuclear weapon. 
  The new element in the proposed legislation is that in 
exceptional circumstances, the U.S. President can exercise 
discretionary powers to release military and economic aid even 
to those countries whose non-proliferation record is suspect. 
  Referring to the proposal, members said that it made India 
also a potential target of U.S. aid restrictions. 
  Responding to members' remarks on the nuclear issue, Mr. 
Bhatia said there would be no change in India's position on 
non-proliferation as it was based on "sound and fundamental 
principles." Earlier, members said that though every effort 
should be made to maintain good relations with the United 
States, this should not deter India from "frankly" stating its 
stand on issues including non-proliferation and human rights. 
  Focussing on the recent remarks of the U.S. official, Ms. 
Robin Raphael, questioning Kashmir's accession to India, members 
felt that there was a shift in U.S. policy on India. The change 
was particularly pronounced on the Kashmir question, they felt. 
  Rejecting the U.S. position that Kashmir was a "disputed 
territory," members emphasised that "the legal situation was 
that the dispute on Kashmir related to Pakistan Occupied 
Kashmir, which was Indian territory illegally occupied by 
Pakistan." 
  Simla Accord relevant: Countering Ms. Raphael's 
reference to Simla Accord as a "non-functional," Mr. Bhatia said 
the relevance of the agreement was evident for it had been 
instrumental in maintaining peace for more than 20 years. India 
continued to stand by it, he asserted. Mr. Bhatia made these 
remarks in the wake of the "surprise" expressed by members at 
Ms. Raphael's statement. 
  Denying allegations of the Indian security forces poor 
observance of human rights. Mr, Bhatia drew attention to the 
Bill introduced in Parliament to form a Human Rights Commission. 
  Referring to Washington's decision not to declare Pakistan a 
terrorist State, Mr. Bhatia said the United States had not taken 
"the final step for its own reasons." All requisite evidence 
that India possessed had been passed on to the United States, he 
said. 
  Focussing on Pakistan's abetment of terrorism and admission 
by Islamabad that it had a nuclear weapon programme, members 
said they found it difficult to comprehend why despite the 
admission the United States chose to impose pressure on India. 
  On the postponement of the G-15 summit on account of lack of 
quorum, Mr. Salman Khurshid cited "unfortunate set of 
coincidences, relating to domestic compulsions of different 
kinds," which had kept a large number of heads away. Heads from 
11 countries had confirmed participation till December 4, Mr. 
Khurshid said. 
  According to a member, it was admitted that Rs. 6 crores had 
been spent on the preparations for the summit. Citing changes in 
the global environment, a member questioned the relevance of 
G-15 in the wake of the emergence of trade blocs such as NAFTA 
[North American Free Trade Agreement] and APEC [Asian-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] .

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "Restrictions Persist in Trade With </F>
Pakistan"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 20--Whatever else the latest Geneva 
accord within the framework of GATT (General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade) may or may not mean for India, it does not 
automatically open the normal trade channels between this 
country and Pakistan. The economic dealings between them will 
continue to be constrained by extraneous considerations unless 
the two governments take bold decisions to remedy the present 
artificial situation. The onus for this lies with Pakistan which 
has not responded favourably to repeated Indian pleas for a 
normal trade flow. There is nothing to suggest that Islamabad is 
in a mood to remove the restrictions imposed by it. 
  New Delhi has been prepared to accord the 
most-favoured-nation treatment to Pakistan but so far it has not 
received a favourable response for reciprocal status for Indian 
exporters--a point that was confirmed in reply to a question in 
the Rajya Sabha today. Pakistan has restricted its imports from 
India to 570 items (not all of which have a potential for 
cross-border dealings). However, two months ago, Islamabad 
allowed the import of cement and pulses, which are not among the 
570, as a one-time exception. 
  India has no objection to a small negative list which may be 
considered necessary for safeguarding of indigenous industries, 
but has made no secret of its disapproval of the present 
practice, based on the positive list. Even in regard to these 
items, Pakistani importers cannot deal directly with their 
Indian counterparts. The cumbersome licensing regulations bring 
the official machinery into the picture--and contributes to 
restrictiveness. The recent annual figures of trade turnover 
speak for themselves--Indian exports: Rs.[rupees] 151 crores, 
Pakistan's exports; Rs. 373 crores. 
  Limited initiative: In the framework of the South 
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) both India 
and Pakistan accepted, at the Dhaka summit earlier this year, a 
limited initiative to promote trade in the region. This took the 
form of SAPTA (South Asia Preferential Trade Arrangement). The 
negotiations that preceded the Dhaka decision were marked by 
hesitations on the part of Pakistan which would have liked 
either to dilute the arrangement or to give it a longer 
time-frame. By contrast, other SAARC members--Bangladesh, Sri 
Lanka and Nepal--were ardent votaries of freer trade in the 
region. However, preliminary steps even in this limited context 
have yet to be taken. 
  For a brief while, after the Shimla Agreement, India and 
Pakistan did open bilateral trade as part of the measures to 
restore normality. But soon after, a strong lobby of 
industrialists in Pakistan prevailed upon their government to 
change its policy. The swamping of Pakistan's markets by Indian 
products, they contended, would destroy its nascent industries. 
In the climate of bilateral suspicion and distrust, this 
argument instantaneously appealed to the government and it 
clamped heavy curbs, which continue till today. 
  India and Pakistan have been buying each other's 
articles--but through third countries. This arrangement only 
deprives them of the gains which should accrue to them because 
of physical proximity and the complementarity of their 
economies. Responsible persons in Pakistan's ruling 
establishment, of late, have spoken in favour of doing away with 
restrictions but have not been able to translate these 
sentiments into policy decisions. 
  There is a strong case for the Foreign Secretaries to take 
up 
trade at some stage of their forthcoming dialogue. But any such 
suggestion from the Indian side is bound to arouse 
suspicion--and be viewed as a trick to divert attention from 
Kashmir.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 21 (PTI)--Israel has offered to 
co-operate with India in the development of avionics and 
armament systems of the light combat aircraft (LCA), upgradation 
of the MiG 21 and development of various missile systems. 
  The offer was conveyed to top defence research and 
development officials and air force and navy brass at the 
just-concluded Avia-93, South Asia's first-ever air show held 
near Bangalore by top Sibat officials, the Israeli foreign 
defence assistance and exports organisation. 
  "Israel is very keen for defence tie-up with Indian armament 
firms, specially in collaboration for development of missile 
systems," a top Sibat official said. In fact, next to the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Israelis had put 
up a massive display at the Avia-93 show. 
  The scientific adviser to the defence ministry, Prof A.P.J. 
Abdul Kalaam, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal S.K. 
Kaul, and the naval chief, Admiral V.S. Shekawat, held talks 
with top Israeli aviation and missile experts during the show. 
  The Israeli aviation firm, Elbit, which has developed one of 
the world's most extensive facilities for comprehensive 
upgradation of aircraft, particularly the MiG-21, is in serious 
contention with Russian Sokol company in bidding for the 
upgradation of the MiG-21 aircraft. 
  Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul said that the Indian air force, 
during the next two to three years, would have to get in for 
upgradation of at least 18 of the 26 MiG-21 squadrons and that 
the government was seriously looking at various offers. 
  Elbit officials, who had put up a comprehensive design of 
the 
upgradation they had carried out in the MiG-21, said they had 
installed advanced avionics, including weapon delivery 
navigation, communication and display systems, and equipped the 
remodelled aircraft which they had labelled as MiG-21 2000 with 
sophisticated smart bomb delivery system as well beyond 
visual-range missiles. 
  The chief of the Air Staff and the naval chief were at the 
Israeli stall for more than two and a half hours having a 
special study of the upgraded MiG-21 systems. 
  Elbit officials said they were offering the Indian air force 
an upgradation of MiG-21 which would also include improved 
radar, and head-up display combine with colour and 
mono-multifunction display system for weapon handling, 
facilities for ballistic calculations. 
  The other highlights of the modification which the Israelis 
have undertaken in the MiGs are installation of opher (a 
terminal guidance kit that transforms dumb bombs into smart 
weapons), dash (a display system and sight helmet for effective 
utilisation of advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles). 
  The two sides are likely to further discuss the Israeli 
offer 
on upgradation of MiGs when Air Chief Marshal Kaul visits that 
country early next month. 
  The air chief said once the final decision was taken, the 
upgradation would be carried out at HAL [Hindustan Aeronautics 
Limited] and would only take 24 to 30 months for the upgraded 
versions to roll out. 
  Elbit has also offered to collaborate with India on 
development of nightsight systems for both the air force and 
army weapons systems. 
  On the light combat aircraft, the Israeli aviation companies 
are offering to collaborate in light-weight weapon delivery 
system, aerospace composite material components, range-finder 
target designator laser, ECM [Electronic Counter Measures] and 
counter-ECM systems.

  [Text] Gurupur (Mysore), Dec. 24--The Nobel peace prize 
winner and religious head, the Dalai Lama, has expressed deep 
concern over the cultural genocide, human rights violation and 
environmental degradation taking place in Chinese-occupied 
Tibet, and said that "all these events will have a direct, 
long-term bearing on India's security." 
  He told reporters here that he noticed a change in the 
perceptions of the politicians in the country on the Tibet issue 
over a period of time, and attributed this to the decline in 
"moral spirit, self-confidence and courage" among politicians of 
the post-independence era. 
  However, he said, more stronger feeling and seriousness was 
being witnessed among the Indian intellectuals and the student 
community on the sovereignty of Tibet. 
  Referring to India's policy on China in regard to Tibet, the 
Dalai Lama said India was "over-cautious." He said India 
accepting Chinese sovereignty over Tibet was a "mistaken 
commitment." 
  "At least India should describe Tibet as an "autonomous 
region" of China, like the British, he felt and disclosed that 
Indian legal experts on various occasions had questioned and 
confronted the stand of the Indian government in this connection. 
  The Dalai Lama appeared apologetic towards the Indian 
government's predicament and said "It is not easy for a big 
nation like India to effect change in policy on an international 
issue as it involves various factors and aspects." 
  On the collapse of the eastern bloc, the spiritual head said 
the collapse of communism had both positive and negative effects 
on the Tibetan issue and their fight for freedom. 
  When asked about the opinion on Tibet in western countries 
and America, the Dalai Lama replied that several western 
nations, including America, had confirmed the fact that Tibet 
was an "occupied land" and both the houses of the United States 
had accepted this. 
  He expressed his deep gratitude to the government of India, 
and especially the government of Karnataka, for their support to 
the Tibetan refugees settled in the state. "The Tibetans in 
India have preserved their culture and spirituality, all because 
of positive help rendered by the state and Union government," he 
said.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 13--India and Malaysia here on 
Tuesday signed five memoranda of understanding (MOU) and one 
agreement in the presence of the Prime Ministers, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao and Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, to further intensify 
their bilateral, cooperative interaction for mutual benefit. The 
five MOUs related to joint ventures under private sector, 
investments, railway construction, telecommunications, rubber 
industry, professional education and airconditioning industry 
and the agreement related to technical cooperation. 
  Earlier in the day, the two Prime Ministers had a 40-minute 
exchange of views agreed and underlined the need for cooperation 
among developing countries in the context of the recent G-15 (at 
all levels) meetings to consult together with a view to find 
ways to fulfil their aspirations. 
  Such cooperation, Mr Rao pointed out, was of great 
importance 
in a changing world which often had the habit of marginalising 
developing countries. He also welcomed the close interaction 
with countries like Malaysia. 
  Agreeing with Mr. Rao, the Malaysian Prime Minister stated 
that in a world situation like the current one it was important 
that countries like India and Malaysia should consult each other 
regularly. They should exchange views on the developments in 
their region, he added. 
  Both the leaders emphasised the need to develop bilateral 
political and economic cooperation. 
  Dr. Mahathir Mohamed wanted that specific areas to be 
identified for infrastructural requirements and cooperation. 
  Both leaders noted that India and Malaysia were countries 
with strong historical and cultural background. Such countries 
had their own ways of looking at things, based on their own 
ethos and some times their national genius could provide 
solutions to present day problems more effectively rather than 
simply trying to graft solutions from the developed world. 
  This one-to-one meet was followed by a full delegation level 
meet where the two Prime Ministers led their respective teams, 
Indian delegation included, apart from senior officials, the 
External Affairs Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh, the Commerce 
Minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee and the Minister of State, Mr 
Buvanesh Chaturvedi. 
  The Malaysian Prime Minister was assisted by his Foreign 
Minister and a high level team of officials. 
  Mr Rao said there had been satisfactory and comprehensive 
discussions at the recent G-15 meetings of the personal 
representatives and Foreign Ministers. It was necessary to 
follow up bilaterally to see that the outcome is not neglected 
through a lack of high level attention. He also pointed out that 
the present bilateral relations between India and Malaysia is an 
example of how countries could keep in very close touch to 
further their cooperation. 
  Dr Mahathir Mohamed agreed with these views and said that 
Malaysia had the same perception and concerns. 
  Mr Rao said that in South Asian region's SAARC [South Asian 
Association for Regional Cooperation] had made a slow but steady 
progress. "It has come of age," he added. He made inquiries 
about the ASEAN. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister mentioned that though the G-15 
summit had to be postponed, he said, he was happy to be in India 
as his country attached great importance to its relationship 
with India.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 15--The Prime Minister of Malaysia, 
Dr Mahathir Mohamed, said today that he had sought India's 
co-operation in building up its defence infrastructure. He 
confirmed that Malaysia was buying several MIG 29 fighter planes 
from Russia and had approached India for their maintenance and 
manufacture of some of the spares. 
  Addressing a press conference on the conclusion of his 
four-day visit, Dr Mohamad explained that Malaysia was not 
acquiring arms with any motive but was engaged in the task of 
replacing the existing hardware which was outdated. He admitted 
that Malaysia could afford to spend a little more on defence and 
to upgrade its armament. 
  Significantly, Dr Mohamed was quick to add that China for 
one 
was getting richer and it would, in real terms, spend more on 
defence. He, however, explained that this did not indicate that 
there was any threat of war. "As the nations grow rich, they can 
afford to spend more on defence," he said. 
  Dr Mohamed said that Malaysia would welcome India to the 
Asia 
Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) but felt that some 
countries would be opposed to it as India was not really on the 
Pacific rim. The minister of state for external affairs, Mr 
Salman Khurshid, had yesterday sought Malaysia's help in 
becoming a member of APEC. 
  Dr Mohamed said that APEC should be restructured to allow 
more countries in the region to join. He felt that APEC was too 
formal a forum. The countries should get together and talk of 
economic cooperation informally. There were many countries which 
geographically came under the Pacific rim but were not members 
of APEC, Dr Mohamed added. 
  The Malaysian prime minister said that during his visit, he 
had several rounds of discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr 
P.V. Narasimha Rao, and other members of the cabinet and the 
focus was on greater bilateral co-operation in a number of 
fields. He said that liberalisation of the Indian economy had 
opened up new opportunities for joint ventures. 
  In response to a question, he said that it would take some 
time for the people of India to accept the economic reforms 
since any change was always uncomfortable. It would be some time 
before India achieved the status of a free-market economy. 
  Regarding the detention of Madame Aung San Suu Kyi, the 
pro-democracy leader in Myanmar, he said that he regretted the 
detention of any one without proper trial but added that 
confrontation was no solution to problems and differences. 
Efforts should be made to persuade Myanmar to be more liberal. 
  Replying to a question on Kashmir, Dr Mohamad said that 
Malaysia stood by the United Nations resolutions and adhered to 
the policy of not normally interfering in the internal affairs 
of other countries. 
  Talking on terrorism, the Malaysian prime minister said that 
all countries should co-operate to put an end to this. The 
terrorists should have nowhere to go. No country should give 
shelter to terrorists, he said.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "G-15 Relevance Reaffirmed"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 13--The presence here of the 
Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, and the Zimbabwe 
President, Mr. Robert Mugabe, and their talks with the Prime 
Minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, and other government 
representatives today were notable for the reaffirmation of 
support to the G-15 and its efforts to articulate the 
aspirations of the South. 
  The decision of the two dignitaries to stick to their plans 
to visit India even after the postponement of the summit was a 
symbolic gesture intended to convey their faith in the relevance 
of the grouping and their interest to strengthen it. This was 
evident from their interaction with the Indian leaders. The 
meaning of the gesture was, certainly, not lost. 
  The postponed summit, it became clear after today's talks, 
will be held either in the last week of March or first week of 
April. And, as was decided by the permanent representatives of 
the member-countries, the format of the grouping would remain 
unchanged--the quorum will continue to be 10; the summit will be 
held, as in the past, once a year; and representation in it will 
continue to be confined to the heads of State or government. 
These decisions were approved by the Ministers from all but 
three of the 15 who met towards the end of last week. 
  China and Iran had shown interest in associating themselves 
with the G-15--the former as an observer, the latter as a 
member. This was among the significant points of last week's 
discussions which may figure in the talks of Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed and Mr. Mugabe, due to be continued tomorrow. A formal 
decision on new members could, however, be taken by the summit. 
  Dr. Mahathir, who arrived here yesterday, was accorded a 
ceremonial welcome this morning in the forecourt of Rashtrapati 
Bhavan. He met Mr. Rao for informal consultations, followed by 
lunch, at the latter's residence. A meeting with a group of 
Indian businessmen before lunch, and a call on the President, 
Dr. S.D. Sharma, in the afternoon were the other highlights of 
his programme. The Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and the 
Railway Minister, Mr. Jaffar Sharif, called on the visiting 
Prime Minister. 
  Mr. Mugabe, who arrived in the morning too, was given a 
ceremonial reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan. In the afternoon, he 
and Mr. Rao met with their delegations. Later, the two held 
talks without aides. 
<H5>  Promoting cooperation </H5>
  Mr. Mugabe's delegation-level talks with Mr. Rao and the 
Malaysian Prime Minister's informal discussions with Indian 
businessmen were part of their other objective--to utilise the 
visits for considering ways to promote bilateral cooperation, 
specially in the economic field. Mr. Mugabe met the 
representative of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), 
while Dr. Mahathir Mohamed will see them at a lunch to be hosted 
by it tomorrow. The former's plan to visit the National Small 
Industries Corporation and the latter's programme to go to the 
Maruti factory tomorrow reflect their interests--Malaysia is 
keen on expanding opportunities for business and industrial 
cooperation (the two sides are to sign agreements for joint 
ventures) while Zimbabwe counts on India's help in rural, small 
and agro-based industries, extension services, and simple 
technology, related to its needs. Soon, Zimbabwe will take over 
huge farms, which continued to be managed by the whites since 
its independence 13 years ago, and distribute the land among the 
blacks. It will, therefore, be interested in India's help in 
building its infrastructure in the agricultural sector. 
  The informal talks between the Prime Ministers of India and 
Malaysia related, apart from G-15-related items like the 
updating of the draft summit communique, to the role of the U.N. 
and its peace-keeping operations and human rights. 
  Bilateral cooperation was the main subject of discussion 
between Dr. Sharma and Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. Asian countries, 
according to them, had made significant strides in the 
industrial and technological fields and there was immense scope 
for cooperation among them in the economic spheres. In their 
opinion, developing countries could achieve a lot by sharing 
their experiences in development and pooling their resources for 
the common good and prosperity.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 14--A Parliamentary Standing 
Committee of the Commerce Ministry has rejected the non-BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] opposition parties' view that India 
should not hesitate to opt out of the ongoing Uruguay Round of 
trade talks on Dunkel proposals. It was wrong to argue that 
India's interest would be served best by giving up the GATT 
membership, it said. 
  In its third report on Dunkel draft proposals, tabled in the 
Rajya Sabha by its chairman, Mr. I.K. Gujral, the committee 
admitted that the final outcome was not in the best interest of 
India on every count. But, it argued, in multilateral 
agreements, "it is always a question of give and take." 
  Stating that in today's world with increasing 
inter-dependence of nations multilateral pacts with 
Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) status were advantageous compared to 
bilateral pacts, the committee cautioned that the country's 
commercial interests would be ill-served by giving up the GATT 
membership. 
  It asked the Government to actively negotiate to bring about 
a more reasonable balance in the proposed agreement which 
remains loaded against developing countries, and consider ways 
to safeguard the sovereign economic rights of developing 
countries by making common cause with other developing countries. 
  The committee said that with the ratification of the present 
round of GATT negotiations, the option now available with the 
United States to clamp Super 301 unilaterally against any 
country should also cease. However, it urged Indian negotiations 
to obtain specific clarifications to that effect. 
  Referring to individual issues that have a bearing on the 
country's economic well-being, the committee said a witness 
deposing before it stated he did not think that Indian 
agriculture would gain the export market due to reduction in 
subsidies made by the developed countries. This was because 
liberalisation in agriculture would be limited and the 
international support levels for their agricultural products 
would be reduced by 20 per cent only. Besides, the witness 
argued the Dunkel text provided for very strict phytosanitary 
(plant related) standards to be observed for agricultural 
exports. India and other developing countries would hardly be 
able to meet these standards, resulting in rejection of their 
exports. 
  The committee said the Dunkel proposals would discriminate 
against Indian agriculture as the subsidies have to be limited 
to an upper bound of 10 percent of the value of the output for 
developing countries. This might have grave implications for the 
poor resource farmers because with increasing cost of energy and 
other inputs the sectorwise subsidy might exceed this limit. 
  The committee was of the opinion that contrary to the avowed 
object of including agriculture in GATT, the result of complying 
with the Dunkel draft proposal could enable the developed 
countries to capture the food markets of developing countries 
and also to control the gene sequences, microbiological 
resources and genetic engineering. 
  Threat to PDS [public distribution system]: The 
committee said if the Dunkel draft was accepted at its face 
value, the public distribution system could come under severe 
strain and jeopardy and as such a clear understanding must be 
obtained from the GATT Secretariat that the country's PDS would 
not be hit in any way now or in future. 
  Taking exception to the informality of the understanding 
that 
the traditional rights and practices of the Indian farmer for 
preservation, sale and free exchange of seeds must remain 
unaffected, the committee said this might not serve the purpose 
in the days to come and wanted these safeguards given "specific 
mention" in the GATT. 
  Referring to Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights 
(TRIPS), the committee viewed with grave concern the impact the 
proposed patent regime would have on India's drug prices. It was 
of the view that specific instruments must be provided in the 
TRIPS agreement to ensure that the patent holders did not use 
their monopoly power to cause steep increase in the prices of 
drugs and also to ensure that India's fast developing indigenous 
drug industry was not "gobbled up" by the multinationals. 
  "The primacy of public interests over the rights of the 
patent holders should be ensured," it added. 
  The committee said the Indian patent law had been rightly 
emphasising patenting of the process and not the product and 
this should be maintained. 
  Patent regime: The proposed extension of patent 
from the current five to seven years to 20 years period 
virtually discourages any research and development and this 
should not be conceded, the committee said. It said India should 
insist on grant of automatic licensing in certain circumstances 
from the patent-holders in public interests. It said 
micro-organism and biological process should be kept out of the 
patent regime. 
  The committee said to sustain the ongoing modernisation of 
the Indian industry, it was important that technology transfers 
continued unimpaired. "The Dunkel draft on TRIPS militates 
against GATT principles that countries at different stages of 
development need to be treated differently in as much as the 
interests of developing countries like India have been ignored 
in favour of developed countries," the committee said. 
  On textiles and clothing, the committee said India should 
explore possibilities to get reasonable improvement in the text 
as this was one area where India's interest from a liberalised 
trade was clearly visible and there should be efforts to ensure 
that potential gains were realised. 
  On Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS), the committee 
noted the proposed TRIPS restricted the power of the Government 
to regulate and control foreign investment. The provisions of 
the Dunkel draft grant foreign investors advantageous position 
vis-a-vis Indian investors. 
  Services sector: On services, the committee said 
given the stage of India's development, "we should be wary in 
accepting any binding commitments to open up our services sector 
where we do not see any economic advantages and what may 
militate against domestic enterprises." 
  The committee observed point-blank that no access should be 
offered as a matter of right in spheres of banking, insurance 
and telecommunication services. It also viewed with concern the 
"unbalanced" nature of General Agreement on Trade in Services 
(GATS), which while allowing for unrestrained flow of 
capital-related services, said little about the labour-related 
services. 
  The committee was also of the view the integrated dispute 
settlement mechanism as provided in the Multilateral Trade 
Organisation (MTO) was heavily loaded against developing 
countries like India, as they could be easily subjected to 
cross-retaliation. 
  Fresh discussion sought: Members in the Rajya 
Sabha today demanded a fresh discussion on the Dunkel draft 
proposals. 
  Drawing attention of the chairperson to the report, Mr. 
Kamal 
Morarka (Samajwadi Party) said during zero-hour that the tabling 
of the report comes at a time when important talks are on 
between the United States and European Community--the outcome of 
which could have far-reaching implications for India. 
  Mr. Jaipal Reddy (Janata Dal) also supported the demand for 
fresh discussion on the report.

  [Text] Brussels, Dec. 20 (UNI)--A major milestone was 
achieved in the relations between India and the European Union 
[EU] when the two sides granted each other the Most Favoured 
Nation (MFN) status on Monday and pledged to reinforce and 
diversify cooperation in agriculture, transport and 
communication, health, banking and promoting scientific and 
technological development. The EU countries are Belgium, Denmark 
and Greece. 
  An agreement was signed by Commerce Minister Pranab 
Mukherjee, Commissioner for developing countries of the EU, Mr 
Manual Marin, and Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. 
  The agreement will also facilitate India to have better 
access to the European Union technology and promote commercial 
exchanges. 
  The 30-article agreement provides for setting up of a joint 
commission to establish priorities in relation to the objectives 
and examine ways and means of enhancing the partnership in 
almost all spheres of economic, technical and industrial 
cooperation. 
  In a joint statement following the signing of the agreement, 
the two sides expressed their resolve to reinforce and intensify 
their mutual relations in the political, economic, technological 
and cultural fields. 
  The EU is India's largest trading partner with a share of 25 
percent of Indian exports and 33 percent of its imports. 
  The two sides attach importance to the principles of respect 
for human rights and democratic rights. Article I of the 
agreement states "respect for human rights and democratic 
principles is the basis for the cooperation between the 
contracting parties." Under the agreement, the two sides 
committed themselves to improve the access for their products in 
each other's market. 
  The acceleration of the pace of India's economic development 
by supporting its efforts in building up its economy would get 
priority. 
  Another area was the development of existing and new forms 
of 
economic cooperation to facilitate exchanges and contacts 
between the business communities of the two sides to encourage 
investment. 
  Support of environmental protection and sustainable 
management of natural resources would be a focal area. 
  The agreement has two main parts--economic and development 
cooperation. 
  Under the agreement economic cooperation is structured to 
encourage the private sector with the expectation of resulting 
multiplier effects. 
  It will involve three broad fields: 
  --Improving the economic environment by facilitating access 
to European knowhow and technology. 
  --Facilitating contacts between economic operators and other 
measures designed to promote commercial exchanges and investment. 
  --Reinforcing mutual understanding of their respective 
economic, social and cultural environment as a basis for 
effective cooperation. 
  The agreement covers cooperation in several specific 
fields--energy, telecommunications, electronics, and information 
technology, agriculture and fisheries and tourism. 
  The agreement recognises India's need for development 
assistance. To contribute to India's own efforts in achieving 
sustainable economic development concrete projects and 
programmes under development cooperation will be targeted 
towards the poorer sections of the population. 
  Particular attention will be given to rural development, 
promotion of employment in rural towns, role of women in 
development with an emphasis on education and family welfare and 
primary health care. 
  The joint statement which was issued after the agreement 
underlined the commitment of contracting parties to safeguard 
peace and establish a just and stable international order in 
accordance with the United Nations charter. 
  It suggested political dialogue at ministerial level between 
India and the EU trioka. The ministerial meeting is expected to 
be held in near future at Brussels. 
  The ministerial meeting will exchange information on foreign 
policy decisions. 
  It would also contribute to consolidating and developing the 
political dialogue between the parties. 
  "European capital and technology could combine well with 
India's natural and human resources to cater to the growing 
markets in India and elsewhere in Asia," Mr Mukherjee 
said.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 13--The Joint Parliamentary 
Committee (JPC), which is scheduled to submit its unanimous 
report to Parliament on December 21, has called for suspension 
of licences of foreign banks as part of the "stringent 
penalties" for their role in the securities scam. 
  The third draft report had only called for the imposition of 
stringent penalties in general. 
  The phrase "including suspension of their licences" was 
added 
as part of the Chairman, Mr. Ram Niwas Mirdha's amendments. 
  "It is necessary that stringent penalties are imposed on 
these banks keeping in view the extent of irregularities 
indulged in by each of them. Legal action should be pursued both 
in India and the foreign country concerned," the unanimous draft 
said. 
  "The Committee desire that special scrutiny may be carried 
out by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) in all the foreign banks 
involved in the recent irregularities and the question of 
disallowing repatriation of profits through irregular securities 
transactions and other malpractices be considered," the report 
said. 
  Managements blamed: The JPC is quite severe on the 
managements of the foreign banks as far as the question of 
accountability is concerned. "A common refrain of the top 
management of these banks has been their unawareness of what was 
happening in their banks. Evidence before the Committee points 
to the fact that the top managements of the foreign banks 
examined by the Committee were aware of the goings on in their 
banks." 
  Referring to the steps taken by individual banks to fix 
responsibility, the JPC found these "bordered on two extremes." 
"While BOA (Bank of America) and ANZ Grindlays Bank accepted 
some of the irregularities committed by them and also expressed 
regrets, in the case of Citibank it started with outright 
denials of existence of any irregularity and gradually veered 
around to acceptance of most of them," the draft report said. 
  "During the first evidence, the witness of the bank 
categorically stated, `there is no evidence of employees fraud'. 
Even during the subsequent hearing the witness initially stuck 
to the same viewpoint and stated, 'there is also no reason to 
suspect employee fraud'." 
  "However, in the same breath he added, `swift action has 
been 
initiated. The three seniormost officers and the seniormost 
dealer in the securities and PMS [Portfolio Management Scheme] 
areas are no longer in the employ of Citicorp/Citibank. The RBI 
has been kept informed," the draft said. 
  Giving details of the operations of foreign banks, the draft 
said that with an insignificant numerical presence (45 banks 
with 140 branches) they had made record profits. Indian banks, 
on the other hand, had about 65,000 branches. 
  "The net profit of these banks has grown by more than six 
times during less than five years from a mere Rs.[rupees] 66.59 
crores in December, 1987 to a hefty Rs. 433.09 crores in March 
1992." 
  "The profits in March 1992 are to be viewed in the context 
of 
the fact that their total presence in the banking system is 
hardly 0.4 per cent and the profits made by the entire banking 
industry during the period were Rs. 1,299 crores." 
  Simultaneously, the Committee came down heavily on the 
foreign banks for not being able to meet priority sector lending 
targets. "Their lending to the priority sector...has during the 
last four years been 7.67, 9.84, 9.45 and 7.86 percent against 
the targets of 10, 12, 12 and 15 percent." 
  Though governed by the laws of the land, foreign banks, 
following the foreign exchange crunch, came to "enjoy more 
indulgence of the regulatory/monetary authorities, even though 
theoretically they continued to be governed by the same control 
measures as applicable to their Indian counterparts." 
  "The examination by the Committee of securities transactions 
in banks has revealed that the foreign banks particularly have 
been deeply involved in the irregularities in securities 
transactions, they have acted in an unbecoming manner, indulged 
in large-scale security deals, highly disproportionate to their 
normal requirements and in the process not only violated RBI 
guidelines but also their own set procedures and prime facie the 
laws of the countries of their origin," the JPC said. 
  Judicial probe demanded: Thirteen members of three 
major opposition parties in the 30-member JPC investigating the 
securities scam submitted a combined note to the JPC seeking a 
judicial inquiry into stockbroker Mr. Harshad Mehta's allegation 
of a Rs. 1-crore pay-off to Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha 
Rao, JPC sources said.

  [Text] Jammu, December 25--Leaders of seven Kashmiri Pandit 
organisations demanded that the term "migrant," used for them, 
should be changed to "displaced" to entitle Pandits, uprooted 
from the Valley, to a "displacement allowance." 
  The leaders told reporters here on Thursday that 6,000 
houses 
in the Valley belonging to the Pandits had been burnt down by 
militants. They said that it was the government's responsibility 
to protect the remaining 80,000 houses as also the Hindu shrines 
and demanded adequate compensation for any loss or damage to 
their property. 
  They said 1,200 Kashmiri Pandits had been killed in the 
Valley in militancy-related incidents but the government had not 
been able to provide adequate compensation to the affected 
families. 
  Their other demands included pucca accomodation, better 
education facilities and job opportunities. 
  The leaders said that the talk of a homeland for them was 
premature. They said conditions had to be created first for 
their return to the Valley. 
  They said the only policy the Centre had on the Kashmiris 
since 1947 was one of "appeasement" of Kashmiri Muslims. They 
said that Pakistan had almost succeeded in making the Valley 
"Hinduless." No political process in the Valley would be deemed 
as complete without the involvement of representatives of Jammu, 
Ladakh and "migrant" Pandit community, they said.

<F P=106> [Article by Thirunavukkarasu, M.G.R.-ADMK (Anna Dravida </F>
Munnetra Kazhagam) General Secretary: "Election-Epilogue: Empty 
Rhetoric That Won't Fill the Stomach"] 
  [Text] The results of the state assembly elections held in 
Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, 
Delhi and Mizoram have given a shock as well as good lessons to 
many political parties. The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] which 
was in power in four of the six states, was able to form a 
ministry only in Rajasthan and that too, with the help of a few 
independents and faced defeat in the other three states. Delhi 
is the new one where BJP formed the ministry. The crushing 
defeat of the BJP in Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar 
Pradesh will prove to be a good turning point in the future of 
Indian politics. 
  In Uttar Pradesh Mulayam Singh Yadav-Kansi Ram coalition was 
successful. The voters did not care in casting their vote 
whether it was for a national party or a local party. All that 
they were concerned with was whetheror not the party could 
provide them with a better life. This has been amply 
demonstrated by the results. It is a wonder in the Indian 
political scene that the state that has been traditionally 
giving Prime Ministers to the nation elected regional parties. 
The results also indicate that the prefix, 'national' alone 
cannot bring about good results. P.V. Narasimha Rao is the first 
person from Southern India to hold the position of the Prime 
Minister and his position has now been well strengthened by 
these "mini-general elections." Now he can deal with his rivals 
in his party effectively and bring about control and discipline 
in the party. His stature now not only scares his own party men 
but also opposition parties. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister 
Jayalalitha's recent visit to Delhi is an interesting example. 
During her last visit to the capital, she stayed with Advani and 
met with Rao's rivals--Arjun Singh and Sharat Pawar, much to the 
annoyance of Rao and came back without seeing the Prime 
Minister. This time, she sought time to see him in advance, met 
him, gave him a flower bouquet and a golden shawl, and also had 
pictures taken She forgot the 'generation gap', for publicity in 
the news media. She had to do this due to her fear. When fear 
creeps in, a person will do anything. 
  Due to the breakdown of discipline, infighting and group 
politics, the Congress Party was pulled down to its present 
miserable plight. The Congress was taught a lesson for its dual 
stand in the case of Babri Mosque and Ram Janma Bhoomi issues. 
Neither Hindus nor Muslims accept the Congress Party's stand. 
The demolition of the mosque has brought down the prestige of 
India in the international arena. India's secularism and unity 
also suffered a severe blow. Though all this was due to the BJP, 
the Congress had to pay the price. In the future, the Congress 
Party has to be firm in protecting and enforcing secularism and 
also be very vigilant and nip in the bud any divisive movements 
and religious fanatics' activities with firmness and sincerity. 
This is the message that both Hindus and Muslims have jointly 
delivered to the Congress Party. This itself is a victory for 
secularism. 
  The Janata Dal, which had grown to be a national alternative 
to the Congress in the northern states was rejected by the 
people. This is not a good sign for India's political health. 
Even for a lamp of gold to keep its flame steady and effective a 
device is necessary. Ruling parties should have effective 
opposition parties. The weakening of these parties is not a good 
sign. The people do not trust in the opportunistic alliance led 
by V.P. Singh Chandra Shekhar and Ajit Singh. It is better that 
those leaders who sincerely oppose the religious fanatics, 
should quit these groups and join the Congress. It will be good 
for them as well as the Congress Party. This may result in 
adding to the formation of another group within the Congress 
Party. 
  Anybody could come into power and that too, with a big 
majority. During their regime, if the legitimate needs of the 
people are not provided for, the voters may throw out the rulers 
whom they installed in power. This has been proved just now. 
Attractive slogans may be sweet and pleasing to the ears of the 
people, but can not fill their stomachs. If there is a clash 
between ears and stomachs, undoubtedly the victory is always for 
the stomach. The many slogans and disguises of the BJP caused 
great disappointment to the people. 
  Even the worst rulers, while in power, may appear to 
everybody that they are at the top of their popularity. But when 
the frustrated people wake up, they will give their rulers a 
crushing defeat, without any hope of their coming up again. This 
is the lesson from Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to the 
rulers, past and present. 
  Our people are not fully literate, but they are endowed with 
a robust common sense. Attractive slogans, pomp and pageantry 
and agitations alone cannot deceive everybody all the time. This 
is the message, a lesson delivered by the voters of northern 
India to all the political parties. Greetings to the voters!

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 20--The former Karnataka Chief 
Minister, Mr Sarekoppa Bangarappa, has been expelled from the 
primary membership of the Congress for a period of six years, 
for violation of party discipline and anti-party activities. 
  A decision to expel Mr Bangarappa was taken by the 
disciplinary action committee (DAC) of the All India Congress 
Committee (AICC), which met here on Monday under the 
chairmanship of Dr Balram Jakhar, vice-chairman of the committee 
and Union Agriculture Minister. The decision, after considering 
Mr Bangarappa's reply to the show-cause notice, was unanimous. 
To expel the former Chief Minister for six years with immediate 
effect. 
  Apart from Dr Jakhar, three other members, Mr A.K. Antony, 
Mr 
R.K. Dhawan and Mrs Omem Deori, attended the meeting. The 
committee chairman and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, Mr Kotla 
Vijayabhaskara Reddy has conveyed his agreement over telephone. 
  The AICC spokesman, Mr Chandulal Chandrakar, who announced 
the decision at his routine press briefing here on Monday, said 
he was not aware whether Dr Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, the party's 
Lok Sabha member from Cuddapah, who was also served a show-cause 
notice along with Mr Bangarappa, has sent his reply to the 
notice. He also had no official information from the committee 
about Dr Reddy's reply and whether his case has come up for 
discussion in Monday's DAC meeting. 
  Mr Chandrakar said he was informed only about the action 
taken against Mr Bangarappa. 
  He said the DAC has taken the strongest action against the 
former Karnataka Chief Minister in order to maintain discipline 
in the party. 
  Mr Bangarappa had sent a very strongly-worded reply to the 
show-cause notice served on him, in which he launched a 
blistering attack on the leadership of the party president and 
Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao. Mr Bangarappa had also 
leaked out the reply to a section of the press and announced his 
intention to launch a regional party in the next few months. In 
view of this, his expulsion was very much on cards and quite 
anticipated. 
  As a matter of fact, the decision to expel Mr Bangarappa 
from 
the party was taken by last Friday's meeting of the DAC, which 
was attended by Mr Vijayabhaskara Reddy, Mr Dhawan and Mr 
Antony, and there was no need for the committee to meet again on 
Monday. It was decided then that "strictist possible action" 
should be taken against Mr Bangarappa for his recent utterances 
against the party leadership. 
  The delay in announcing the decision was attributed to the 
fact that the committee wanted to take the approval of Mr 
Narasimha Rao, which in turn was delayed because Mr Rao was on 
tour on Saturday and Sunday in Karnataka. The second meeting of 
the committee was an attempt to explain the delay in announcing 
the decision. This was the third meeting of the DAC on the 
Bangarappa issue. 
  According to senior party leaders here, the expulsion of Mr 
Bangarappa is not going to affect the interests of the party in 
the State. The State leadership had conveyed to the Centre that 
not a single legislator was likely to go with the former Chief 
Minister, they said. 
  Mr Bangarappa's recent action had drawn flak from his party 
colleagues both in the State as well as at the Centre. About a 
dozen MPs had recently met Mr Rao and urged him to take drastic 
action against Mr Bangarappa. 
  Mr Bangarappa reacted to his expulsion from the Congress on 
Monday by announcing that he would launch a new State-level 
party. 
  Mr Bangarappa said, "I am happy I am out of the Congress 
headed by Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, who is unable to uplift the 
poorer and farming community of the country." He also said that 
Mr Rao had failed to protect secularism. 
  When the news of his expulsion was conveyed to him, Mr 
Bangarappa remarked: "Congratulations, I am happy that I am out 
of the Congress headed by Mr Narasimha Rao." He said it was a 
pity that his friends were still there in the Congress under Mr 
Narasimha Rao, "who is hobnobbing with the BJP [Bharatiya Janata 
Party]." 
  Mr Bangarappa said he would decide the date and other 
details 
of launching the new party after consultations with his 
supporters. 
  The Bangarappa camp received a shot in the arm when five 
legislators, including three former ministers came out with a 
statement that the expulsion only proved Mr Rao's "anti-down 
trodden stand." 
  Alleging that Mr Rao's "singular objective" that to destroy 
the leadership of backward classes in the State, they called 
upon other Congress(I) men to quit the party and form a "new 
force." 
  Mr Bangarappa had been toying with the idea of starting a 
regional party and his expulsion would only hasten the birth of 
a new party, sources close to him said. 
  He had toured the districts to scout for support for his 
move. 
  In the meetings with his supporters, Mr Bangarappa was 
understood to have discussed the issue of launching a separate 
outfit to champion the cause of backward classes. In fact, he 
had talked of a party on the lines of the Mulayam Singh 
Yadav-Kanshiram combine. 
  The supporters of Mr Bangarappa said the expulsion could not 
have come at a more opportune time with the panchayat elections 
round the corner in the State. "This would be the acid test for 
us," the sources said. 
  However, the supporters of the Chief Minister, Mr M. 
Veerappa 
Moily, were jubilant over Mr Bangarappa's expulsion. They felt 
that dissident activity, which was dented with Mr Bangarappa 
choosing to take on Mr Rao himself, would now become 
inconsequential. The Bangarappa group had provided the backbone 
for the "oust Moily" campaign. 
  The sources said the former Chief Minister would not be able 
to draw significant support from the legislature party as a 
majority of legislators would not be prepared to leave the party 
for his sake. 
  Interestingly, this is not the first time that such drastic 
action has been taken against Mr Bangarappa. He had faced a 
similar situation earlier and he had floated a regional party 
then also. The party failed to kick-off and he had to enact a 
'home-coming' into the Congress. 
  Mr Bangarappa, who was made Chief Minister of Karnataka in 
October 1990 after Mr Veerendra Patil, had to step down 
following large-scale dissidence in the Congress Legislature 
Party (CLP) and serious charges of corruption. He was replaced 
by Mr Veerappa Moily in November last year. 
  Bangalore (UNI): The Karnataka Chief Minister, Mr 
M. Veerappa Moily, has termed the expulsion of his predecessor, 
Mr S. Bangarappa, on Monday as "inevitable." 
  Mr Moily said that by taking a strong stand against the 
party 
and its leadership, Mr Bangarappa had invited expulsion.

  [Text] Calcutta, December 20--The CPM [Communist Party of 
India-Marxist], at its three-day central committee meeting, is 
working on the details of distancing itself from the motely 
National Front. 
  Tired of its image of being tagged on to miscellaneous 
political alliances that have failed to yield electoral 
advantage, the party is finalising a high-profile programme of 
independent mass mobilisation. 
  According to sources, the CPM foresees that there will be a 
great churning of political forces in the country in the near 
future, as the most backward sections struggle to emerge on the 
forefront of politics. 
  The emergence of the Dalits organised under the Bahujan 
Samaj 
Party has been an eye-opener for the CPM. Hence the party will 
continue to pursue political alliances whenever and wherever 
necessary, based on specific issues, but will not endure any 
more its role of being a "shrinking tail." 
  The CPM will launch a large-scale countrywide mass programme 
to educate the people about the perils of the new economic 
policy and the changing social realities. 
  CPM leaders said that circumstances and the Congress had 
kept 
the attention of the opposition focused on the problems of 
communalism, national unity and integrity, and stability, while 
pushing through the economic reforms package. 
  While the economic liberalisation programme could not be 
reversed and in states like West Bengal where the CPM was in 
power, the administration had no option but to enter into the 
spirit of the competitive era, the effort of the CPM would be to 
increase awareness among the people on the disastrous impact of 
the new economic policy. The struggle to fight the worst 
fallouts of the new economic programme would be taken up at the 
state and national levels, CPM sources said. 
  The central committee meeting, after analysing the results 
of 
the elections in the five northern states, concluded that caste 
politics was bound to dominate the scene in the near future. The 
emergence of the Dalits as a political entity under the Bahujan 
Samaj Party was watershed in Indian politics. 
  The committee saw that the alliance of the Dalits and the 
minorities was not a conscious, deliberate, calculated political 
move, but was the reflection of a growing awareness and 
empowerment among the weakest and most oppressed sections. 
  In the near future what was likely to happen was increased 
conflict and violence within the same caste groups between those 
who suffered from a sense of being oppressed against those who 
were identified as the oppressors, the CPM's leadership 
anticipated. 
  Chalking out a political agenda that can encompass the 
multitude of problems the CPM faces in its struggle to revive 
its languishing political fate is growing to be a difficult and 
complex task for the central committee. The party is adopting an 
attitude of playing it by the ear, of evolving its tactics as 
its mass contact programmes get underway, to give it the kind of 
flexibility it needs to trace a path through the confusing 
political and economic scenario.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 19--The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] 
today patted itself on the back for losing but standing first in 
the November 1993 elections and there was a clear indication 
that it was not to change direction or dilute its Hindutva 
ideology. 
  But having congratulated itself on emerging as "the single 
biggest party" in the country and for its overall poll 
percentage of 36.14 (a good 10 percent ahead of the nearest 
rival, the Congress), it went on to draw some "lessons" from its 
electoral defeat. Over-confidence, too much emphasis on national 
issues during the poll campaign, lack of discipline in some 
State units were among the factors held responsible for the 
debacle. 
  Advani's note: Significantly, the key to the 
party's stand towards its electoral debacle came from a 
three-page note for consideration of the party's national 
executive committee which Mr. L.K. Advani, party president, sent 
from his confinement in Pipri, where he is under judicial 
custody in connection with the Babri demolition conspiracy case. 
  Mr. Advani noted that the party had set a high target for 
itself, that of capturing power in five States. That has not 
happened. "The sprinter has failed to break another record." But 
that the BJP is still "numero uno" is not doubted by him, 
although he admits that it was inadequate compensation for the 
electoral defeat. The "apt comment" on the elections would be 
"loser stands first," Mr. Advani said. 
  The task before the party, he advised the national 
executive, 
chaired in his absence by the senior vice-president Mr. Sundar 
Singh Bhandari, was to "so fine-tune our approach and strategy" 
that the present disappointment with the November Assembly 
election results proves a fleeting phase. Quite unequivocally, 
Mr. Advani said the setback in the election was not a setback 
for its ideology, for its support base had increased. "The 
enlargement of the party's popular base is proof that the 
party's ideology of cultural nationalism continues to gather 
more and more adherents," Mr. Advani stated. 
  General secretaries' report: Today on the last of 
the two-day meeting of the national executive the party 
discussed not only Mr. Advani's note but also a report on the 
recent elections prepared jointly by the party's five general 
secretaries. The report, which has been by and large accepted by 
the executive, has concluded that several factors may have been 
responsible for the poor performance. 
  These have been identified as over-confidence and 
complacency, failure to project unity at the organisational 
level in some of the States, tough and unpopular measures taken 
by some of its State Governments, too much emphasis on national 
issues rather than important local issues during the election 
campaign, and lack of adequate attention being paid to the 
backward and scheduled caste factors. 
  Till late this evening the executive committee was 
discussing 
the draft political resolution which will be released tomorrow. 
However, it is learnt that the resolution will by and large 
reflect the position that the party has not fared badly, that 
its dizzy growth has been momentarily slowed down, that the 
general direction of the party and its main ideology needs to be 
strengthened rather than diluted, and that the task before the 
party is to rededicate itself to this task. 
  Changes suggested: As a result of the experience 
from this Assembly election the general secretaries' report has 
suggested some changes in the method of selecting candidates. It 
has suggested that the party should invite applications from 
candidates only for those constituencies where it proposes to 
drop a sitting MP [member of Parliament] or MLA [member of 
Legislative Assembly] or change the candidate which had last 
fought elections from there. It also has a word of caution for 
future BJP governments--not to take too stiff and unpopular 
measures too soon--for the party has identified this factor as 
the main reason for its rout in Himachal Pradesh. 
  The main discussion on the general secretaries report and 
the 
poll debacle was initiated last night by Mr. Sunderlal Patwa, 
former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and the man most 
maligned in party circles as the villain of the electoral defeat 
in that State. Today's deliberations suggest that the party is 
opposed to singling him out or making him a scapegoat for the 
debacle, for after all in Himachal Pradesh the party suffered a 
complete rout. 
  Madhya Pradesh was not the only State unit which was "sure" 
that the party would win hands down. In Uttar Pradesh, the 
report recorded, the party office-bearers had from the start of 
the campaign talked about "280 seats in our pocket." The party 
has been critical of this kind of complacency and has warned 
that in future too there could be new political alignments and 
the party would have to prepare itself well. 
  PTI reports: 
  The BJP is likely to call off its boycott of Parliament from 
tomorrow, the leader of the Opposition, Mr. A.B. Vajpayee, 
indicated. 
  He said a final decision would be taken at the Parliamentary 
Party meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning. 
  He said the boycott issue was discussed at length at the 
national executive and it was felt the party had registered its 
protest in Parliament against the continued "illegal detention" 
of its leaders in the Ayodhya case.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 20 (PTI)--Parliament today approved 
legislation making the Election Commission a multi-member body 
and bringing the salaries of two newly-appointed commissioners 
on par with the chief election commissioner. 
  The Rajya Sabha passed the bill, the Chief Election 
Commissioner [CEC] and other Election Commissioners (conditions 
of service) Amendment Bill, 1993, which replaces a presidential 
order of October 1, this year. The Lok Sabha had passed the bill 
last week. 
  Replying to a discussion on the bill, the minister of state 
for law, justice and company affairs, Mr H.R. Bhardwaj, 
justified the presidential ordinance and said the government was 
willing to hold discussions on electoral reforms with all 
political parties. 
  He said there were no political motives behind the ordinance 
which was in accordance with constitutional provisions and the 
supreme court directive. 
  Members belonging to the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and 
the 
Janata Dal [JD] opposed the bill saying the government should 
await the supreme court judgment on the issue and then bring a 
comprehensive bill on electoral reforms. 
  The bill was passed by voice vote after amendments by 
opposition members were negated. 
  Alternatively, the two parties suggested that the government 
should accept the amendment moved by Mr S.P. Malaviya of the 
JD(S) [Janata Dal-Samajwadi] to refer the bill to a select 
committee till the supreme court gave its final verdict. 
  Mr Mohd Afzal (JD), however, supported the bill. 
  He expressed concern over reports that about one million 
people in the capital were being divested of their voting rights 
by the election commission by labelling them as foreign 
nationals. 
  Mr Sukomal Sen (CPM) supported the bill to make the election 
commission broad-based. He was, however, critical of the 
election commission's directive to the West Bengal government to 
issue photo identity cards to voters by next year. 
  Mr Chaudhary Hari Singh (Congress) said all members of the 
commission should be of equal status and should enjoy parity in 
service conditions. 
  Opposing the bill, Mr Triloki Nath Chaturvedi (BJP) said as 
the matter was sub-judice, the government should not pass the 
bill in haste. 
  He said though his party was in favour of a multi-member 
election commission, the primacy of CEC should be maintained.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 17--The Election Commission has 
decided to ensure that candidates for Rajya Sabha elections 
contest only from their respective States. In other orders, the 
commission has modified the format for filing the election 
expenditure incurred by candidates and an intensive revision of 
Delhi's electoral rolls. 
  The Chief Election Commissioner [CEC], Mr T.N. Seshan, told 
a 
`meet the press' programme of the Press Club of India here on 
Friday that the commission would ensure that such candidates 
give their correct residential address in the nomination and not 
merely as `C/O The Chief Minister'. The measure was intended to 
check the "backdoor entry" into the Rajya Sabha, he said. 
  To this end, the Election Commission had asked the Chief 
Electoral Officers (CEOs) of States to be alert while 
registering known political personalities in the electoral rolls 
as voters. The advisory suggests a double check on the "normally 
resident of the area" clause in the Representation of the People 
Act to check fraudulant enrolment in the voter list, which in 
turn enables the personality to contest an election to the 
Council of States. 
  Answering a question on the common practice of providing a 
fictitious address for enrolment in the voters' list, 
particularly by politicians wishing to contest a Rajya Sabha 
seat from a State where they are not normally resident, Mr 
Seshan said the commission was aware of it and had moved in the 
direction of checking it. "Nobody will be able to get away with 
giving a `care of' address in any State," he said. 
  The Election Commission has modified the format for filing 
the election expenditure incurred by candidates and directed 
them to file "correct" accounts. The commission order has called 
for submission of accounts of election expenditure by contesting 
candidates in the recent Assembly elections also. 
  Mr Seshan said that the district election officers, before 
accepting the revised proforma from the candidates on the 
election expenses should conduct an inquiry, if necessary, to 
ensure that these were in accordance with the law. The modified 
format requires the candidates to show day to day accounts as 
also total expenditure with details, he said. 
  The candidates have been asked to keep correct account of 
all 
expenditure from the date of nomination till the declaration of 
results. Mr Seshan expressed concern over the "increasing role 
of money power" in elections. The government was yet to take 
action on his recommendations on checking the menace, he added. 
  Mr Seshan said he had also ordered "special intensive 
revision" of electoral rolls in Delhi not only following 
complaints but also because he felt things were at variance with 
ground reality. 
  Answering a wide range of questions on the changes he is 
trying to bring about in electoral practices and procedures, Mr 
Seshan agreed that a one-day poll all over the country even for 
Lok Sabha elections was the ideal. The commission, however, 
could not rush in that direction ignoring the constitutional 
directive to ensure a "free and fair" poll. The commission would 
complete the polling process in one day, provided the government 
extended the necessary police personnel to make the poll free 
and fair. 
  He, however, did not foresee such a situation developing in 
the near future. Mr Seshan said the commission sets up nearly 
6.5 lakh polling stations for a parliamentary poll in all the 
543 Lok Sabha constituencies. At the rate of just two policemen 
at each booth, the commission would require 13 lakh personnel. 
The government could not go one beyond 60,000 personnel in the 
November round of Assembly elections. With those numbers, he 
would be able to deploy just one policeman for ten to twelve 
polling booths, which was hardly conducive to a free and fair 
poll, he said. 
  On the question of photo-identity cards to all voters by 
January 1, 1995, Mr Seshan said the matter was discussed at a 
meeting of all CEOs in September, where all the 32 CEOs saw no 
problem of any kind in making this possible by the set date. Now 
some States were raising the question of resources which was not 
his look-out. It had to be sorted out between the States and the 
Centre, he said while declining to comment on the stand taken by 
the Advocate-General of West Bengal that insisting on identity 
cards for voters was violative of the constitutional provision 
of adult franchise. 
  The question of election expenses of candidates was engaging 
the close consideration of the commission, which was trying to 
find ways of enforcing the available legal provisions in this 
regard. He, however, said there was little that the commission 
could do if Parliament, in its wisdom, did not arm it to deal 
adequately with the issue. 
  Similar was his stance on barring persons with a criminal 
background from contesting the polls. 
  Another aspect which the commission is looking seriously 
into 
is the exit polls conducted by some organisations, which find 
their way into newspapers. These exit polls had the potential to 
influence the voting pattern in other areas, he admitted. 
  Mr Seshan, even as he declined to answer a question on why 
restrictions were imposed on the entry of media persons into 
polling stations, on the ground that the matter was pending 
before a court, said one reason he could share with the press 
right away was that of overcrowding in polling booths. With an 
average of 50 candidates in one constituency, there would be as 
many poll agents inside a polling station. There would also be 
the average six polling staff and if journalists also went 
inside in good numbers, there would be no room left for the 
voters, he said. The CEC, however, promised that reporters would 
not be given scope for complaining the next time round.

  [Text] New Delhi, December 24--The election commission (EC) 
has directed the chief electoral officer (CEO) of the Delhi 
government to undertake a special intensive revision of the 
electoral rolls with January 1, 1994, as the cut-off date. 
  This follows the commission being convinced that the 
revision 
of rolls in March and April this year by the Delhi 
administration had been done in a "gravely unsystematic, 
slip-shod and unacceptable manner." 
  The commission has thus placed on record its "severest 
displeasure" against all those officers responsible for the 
defective rolls and its intention to proceed against them 
separately. 
  The fresh revision, which entails house-to-house 
enumeration, 
will be carried out under the detailed supervision of its 
observers, and publication of the draft and the final rolls will 
not be done without the commission's "specific written 
clearance" for each of the 70 assembly constituencies. 
  It has also warned that any defect in the rolls so published 
will invite the "most serious consequences." 
  The commission has said that the house-to-house enumeration 
should begin on April 4, 1994, and the final publication of 
rolls be completed by October 20, 1994. The CEO has been 
directed to stick to the deadline. 
  The commission has pointed out that it had received an 
"extremely large number" of complaints regarding defects in the 
preparation of the rolls and these continue to "pour in every 
day." 
  "The nature of these complaints regarding the electoral 
rolls, as published on March 9 and April 2 this year are proof 
that the work of revision has been carried out in a slip-shod 
and unacceptable manner," it noted. 
  It lists them as: 
  --Omission of names of persons, who have been residing at 
the 
same address for the last 20 years or more, of whole localities 
and blocks of buildings, continuance of names of dead persons 
and related and multiple duplication of identical names in rolls 
of several constituencies. 
  --Names included in the draft rolls had been left out in the 
final rolls without any orders. 
  --Number of cases where the particulars of voters such as 
name, age, father's name, sex, etc., are either wrong or 
defective. 
  The complaints received were from representatives from all 
walks of life, including but not restricted to ministers, 
defence service personnel, associations of residents of 
established colonies and political parties. Besides, newspaper 
reports too had pointd out these omissions, the commission noted. 
  The programme for the revision of the rolls is: 
house-to-house enumeration (from April 4 to May 18); 
verification of citizenship status by the authorities concerned 
and preparation of manuscripts and printing of draft rolls (by 
July 18); publication of draft rolls (on July 19); period for 
filing claims and objectives (from July 19 to August 19); 
disposal of claims (by September 19); preparation and printing 
of supplementaries (October 19); and final publication of rolls 
(October 20).

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 15 (UNI)--The Election Commission on 
Wednesday ordered that all electors in all Parliamentary 
constituencies in the country except Jammu and Kashmir be 
supplied with photo identity cards by November 30 next year. 
  The eleven-page order issued by the commission secretary, Mr 
K.P.G. Kutty, made it clear that the commission would not hold 
election after January 1, 1995, unless all eligible electors 
were supplied with photo identity cards by this deadline. 
  The order categorically stated that the Chief Electoral 
Officers and the State Governments or Union Territories would 
not be given any extension beyond the above deadline under any 
circumstances. 
  "It is therefore squarely the responsibility of the State 
Governments and Chief Electoral Officers to strictly abide by 
the schedule and ensure compliance. 
  "Any slippage or non-compliance for any reason whatsoever 
will be visited with appropriate action by the commission for 
which the State Governments and the Chief Electoral Officers 
concerned alone will be responsible," the commission warned. 
  The commission directed all the State Governments and Union 
Territories to acknowledge the receipt of this order within a 
week from Wednesday. 
  The following is the schedule fixed by the commission for 
issuing photo identity-cards to electorate: 
  1. Issue of comprehensive instructions to EROs [expansion 
not 
given] by the ECOs and forwarding of a copy of the compendium of 
instructions to the Election Commission by December 31, 1933. 
[date as published] 
  2. Supply of paper to EROS--by January 31, 1994. 
  3. Award of contract to the agencies--February 28, 1994. 
  4. Completion of photography and lamination--by August 31, 
1994. 
  5. Completion of distribution of cards to electors and 
consignment of duplicates--by November 30, 1994.

  [Text] New Delhi, December 21 (PTI)--The joint 
parliamentary committee (JPC) today held the top management of 
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the finance ministry equally 
responsible for the multi-crore rupee securities scam saying 
"deregulation without effective checks and balances would be an 
unmitigated disaster." 
  In its Volume I report tabled in Parliament today, the 
committee said if RBI had not turned "a blind eye to the massive 
irregularities in the banking transactions between the period of 
July 1991 to April 1992, when thousands of crores of bank funds 
were diverted to the stock market, it would not have been 
possible for some brokers to play havoc with the system." 
  It said Mr S. Venkitaramanan as the governor of RBI during 
this crucial period must be held no less responsible. 
  Referring to the finance ministry's role in the scam, the 
committee said it failed to anticipate the problem, respond to 
it purposefully when it first surfaced, manage adequately 
thereafter the consequences of it, apply the needed correctives 
with promptness and punish the guilty in time and resolutely. 
  On the role of top RBI officials in the scam, the committee 
said the suggestion to treat the foreign banks differently, the 
delay in the issue of the circular of July, 1991, failure to 
incorporate all the deficiencies in this circular and the 
absence of any follow-up action subsequently, the delay in the 
issue of the bill discounting circular for 22 months, 
recommendation to appoint people in top positions which proved 
to be a liability and display of unusual interest in the account 
of Harshad Mehta were all acts of "omission and commission" on 
the part of the former governor of RBI, Mr S. Venkitaramanan, 
which could not be "overlooked in any of their ramifications." 
  Similarly, the large number of SGL (security general ledger) 
bouncings, the deficiencies in the functioning of the public 
debt office (PDO) and the goings-on in both State Bank of India 
[SBI] and the National Housing Bank [NHB] of which Mr R. 
Janakiraman was a director, clearly indicates "there was 
dereliction in performing his duties" as deputy governor, the 
report observed. 
  The committee noted that Mr Amitava Ghosh, who was the 
deputy 
governor in charge of department of banking operations and 
development [DBOD] for ten years, must be held primarily 
responsible for the continuing irregularities in the banking 
sector, ignoring the various inspection reports prepared by the 
terms of RBI inspectors over the years like the Augustine Kurias 
report, the Ranganathan report and for being `casual' in his 
approach to his duties. 
  Mr N.D. Parameshwaran, the chief officer of DBOD should also 
be held responsible for the lapses of the department. The JPC 
said, he need not have played any role concerning the account of 
Harshad Mehta. 
  It also urged review of the penal clauses in the BR 
(bankers' 
receipt) Act and other relevant Acts to enable RBI to impose 
graded penalties and other types of punishments commensurate 
with the seriousness of the abuse. 
  Referring to the functioning of public sector banks and 
appointments of top posts in these banks, the committee asked 
the finance ministry to set up a board on the lines of the 
public enterprises selection board for appointment of chief 
executives and executive directors of nationalised banks. 
  The committee noted as many as ten top former executives of 
the 20 nationalised banks had, during the past few years, been 
found involved in serious irregularities. This was "a telling 
commentary on the process of selection and appointments by the 
government," it said. 
  Irregularities committed by top management not only 
adversely 
hit the functioning of their respective banks but also led to 
the malaise spreading over the entire banking system, JPC said. 
  It said this hoax of flotation of funds by PSUs [public 
sector undertakings] was perpetrated and the funds so released 
became a principal source of finance for all varieties of 
speculative and illegal transactions in the securities market, 
as well as the stock market. The placement of PSU funds became 
the single great contributor to the scam, it said. 
  "What the committee finds as condemnable is that all this 
was 
public money and all who were playing with it were public 
servants," it observed caustically. 
  The committee favoured replacing the government nominee 
directors from the boards of public sector banks, who are at 
present from the civil services. 
  It strongly felt, in view of their conduct and activities in 
the scam, the working of foreign banks had to be strictly 
supervised as in a way, they were the initiators of the scam as 
well as the major players. 
  In the light of these mistakes, the committee felt, the 
responsibility and accountability of the finance minister to 
Parliament could not be `denied'. 
  Though the finance minister tried to disown direct 
responsibility for administrative failures or management 
deficiencies in the case of individual banks and other financial 
bodies, the committee said such a distinction could not be 
sustained by the constitutional jurisprudence under which the 
parliamentary system worked. 
  In the light of developments that had supervened, the 
committee said the relevance of continuing in its present form 
the banking division and the stock division by the finance 
ministry needed to be examined. 
  The committee came down heavily on what it termed the 
"culture of non-accountability in all sections of government and 
the banks." 
  Describing this culture as "the most unfortunate aspect" of 
the scam, the report said. "The scam was a result of failure to 
check irregularities in the banking system and also 
liberalisation without adequate safeguards." 
  "While the mood of the government is upbeat on 
liberalisation, their orientation towards strict enforcement 
has yet to manifest itself. Deorientation without effective 
checks and balances would in the view of the committee be an 
unmitigated disaster," it said.

  [Text] Madras, Dec. 21--The alleged "acts of omission and 
commission" on the part of the former Governor of the Reserve 
Bank of India [RBI], Mr. S. Venkitaramanan, considered by the 
Joint Parliamentary Committee [JPC] on the securities scam, 
included "reactivation," in April 1992, of the current account 
of Harshad Mehta in the State Bank of India (Main Branch) in 
Bombay. 
  This allegation, according to the deposition of Mr. 
Venkitaramanan and his clarifications to the committee, was 
misconceived because there was in the first instance no freezing 
or deactivation of the account by the RBI but only an order to 
monitor the flow of funds. (The RBI has no power to freeze a 
current account except under legal procedures like 
implementation of a "garnishee order" from a court or on issuing 
a show-cause notice to the account holder.) 
  What had happened in the case of the Harshad Mehta account, 
according to the defence put up by the former RBI Governor, was 
that on March 16, 1992, extracts from the current account of 
Harshad Mehta with the SBI were brought to the attention of Ms. 
Viswanathan, Executive Director of the RBI, by Mr. M.N.Goiporia, 
Chairman of the SBI. This itself was the result of a query made 
by the RBI Governor at a meeting held in the RBI on March 10, 
1992, as to the source of funds of Harshad Mehta. 
  The information from the SBI Chairman on the Mehta account 
was shown by Ms. Viswanathan to Mr. Venkitaramanan on the same 
day (March 16, 1992), whereupon the latter reiterated over the 
telephone his instructions to Mr. Goiporia to monitor the 
account. Ms. Viswanathan, on her part, instructed RBI officials 
to scrutinise voucher entries on the Mehta account on a top 
priority basis. 
  Harshad Mehta did not operate the account between March 16 
and April 1, 1992, but again operated it from April 2 to 8, 
1992. Whatever the reasons which impelled Harshad Mehta to 
operate or not operate his current account, the fact was that 
there were no orders from the RBI to the SBI for freezing or 
defreezing the account or to withdraw the monitoring of the 
same, Mr. Venkitaramanan is understood to have told the JPC. 
  Foreign banks: Another issue that has exercised 
members of the JPC is the alleged instruction, given by Mr. 
Venkitaramanan in his note of March 20, 1991, to the Deputy 
Governor, Mr. Amitabh Ghosh, for "different treatment" for 
foreign banks suspected to be involved in irregular transactions 
in PSU [oublic sector undertakings] bonds and Government 
securities. 
  Mr. Venkitaramanan clarified to the JPC that all that his 
role of March 20, 1991 (which, incidentally, was issued within 
three months of taking over his job) said in respect of foreign 
banks was that "while foreign banks are involved, we have to 
take care." The note had also mentioned that several banks who 
were suspected to be carrying on "fictitious" transactions in 
violation of norms and instructed the Deputy Governor to ensure 
that such transactions did not take place. (The full magnitude 
and modus operandi of the transactions came to light only in 
subsequent investigations, especially by the Janakiraman 
committee.) 
  Mr. Venkitaramanan told the JPC that orders to "take care" 
(while dealing with foreign banks) did not mean either closing 
one's eyes to the wrongdoings of foreign banks or going soft on 
them. The instruction, calling essentially for proper alertness 
and caution in dealing with them, was issued in the context of 
the massive foreign exchange crisis that had overtaken the 
country at that time and the frantic efforts then being made by 
the Government and the RBI to shore up the reserves. The 
situation was such that the RBI, while following up the 
securities issue, would at the same time be soliciting foreign 
currency deposits from foreign banks under a scheme launched 
under instructions from the Government in 1990. 
  Subsequent investigations conducted by the RBI on securities 
trading in fact, covered foreign banks and revealed several 
irregular practices on their part. 
  A third issue on which the then RBI Governor was questioned 
by the JPC was his role in the appointment of Mr. M.J. Pherwani 
as Chairman of the National Housing Bank (which, as revealed 
later, was a leading player in the scam) and of Mr. K. 
Margabandhu as Chairman and Managing Director [MD] of the UCO 
[Unitrd Commercial] Bank. Mr. Venkitaramanan pointed out to the 
committee that the Appointments Board, headed by him and 
including representatives of the Finance Ministry, at its 
meeting on February 9, 1991, recommended the name of Mr. 
Margabandhu in view of his record of handling industrial 
relations problems successfully in the State Bank of Saurashtra 
as its then MD. 
  The RBI Governor told the Board that mainly because of the 
better selection and training procedures at the SBI compared to 
other banks, the quality and standard of its officers was of a 
high order. Considering the weak financial position and working 
environment at UCO Bank and the fact that no other officer of 
the rank of Deputy MD of the SBI was then willing to assume 
responsibility of chairmanship of the UCO Bank, the Board 
finally recommended his name. Mr. Margabandhu, it noted, had 
also worked in Calcutta in the SBI. 
  As for Mr. Pherwani, the RBI had recommended his name for 
the 
[National Housing Bank] NHB chairmanship in view of his 
experience, expertise and innovative approach (Mr. Pherwani, who 
was earlier Chairman of the Unit Trust of India, was at that 
time heading the infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services 
Ltd. besides being a Director of the Maharashtra State Financial 
Corporation). The Appointments Board, while considering the RBI 
recommendation, decided to leave the matter to the Government to 
finalise but expressed the view that if Mr. Pherwani was 
selected, he could be allowed to continue as IFL Chairman. 
  Mr. Venkitaramanan sought to impress on the JPC that the RBI 
could only recommend names based on facts available to it and if 
there was anything that went against the individuals concerned, 
it was to be taken care of by vigilance inquiries before issuing 
orders. 
  In respect of charges of delay or laxity in following up his 
initial note and in issue of circulars to all banks (which was 
done by the RBI in July, 1991), the JPC is understood to have 
been told by Mr. Venkitaramanan that the intervening period was 
taken up by investigations by the bank. What was more, he said, 
it was he (Mr. Venkitaramanan), who insisted on issuing the 
circular in July 1991, ruling out suggestions from the Deputy 
Governor concerned for appointing an auditing firm to examine 
the issue further. The Governor had taken the view that since 
evidence of irregularities in securities trading had existed 
within the RBI as early as 1986-87 following a report submitted 
at that time by an official, the matter brooked no further delay.

  [Text] New Delhi, December 22--The minister for petroleum 
and natural gas, Capt. Satish Sharma, today emphatically denied 
that he had received remittances from abroad from "questionable 
sources" or "made substantial investments abroad in various ways 
in violation of the country's laws." 
  In similar statements in both houses of Parliament, during 
zero hour the minister also refuted the allegation that he had 
been involved in banking investigations in the U.S. regarding 
questionable investments abroad or had disclosed government 
policy to unauthorised people before any official announcement. 
  Capt. Sharma, however, stated that he had received 
remittances valued at about Rs[rupees]43 lakhs from his younger 
brother, Mr Girish Kumar Sharma, who is settled in United States 
since 1972 and is now a citizen of that country. The funds were 
received through regular banking channels between 1986 and 1992 
and reflected in his income-tax returns, he added. He pointed 
out that his brother had his own professional management 
services in the United States and had no business in India. 
  The statement came at the end of persistent demands from the 
opposition for two days for a clarification from the minister. 
The opposition, which had been clamouring for a detailed 
discussion on the charges, was not satisfied with the statement. 
  In the Rajya Sabha, Capt. Sharma's explanation triggered off 
a prolonged uproar as opposition members sought clarifications 
from the minister, a demand which was turned down by the deputy 
chairperson, Ms Najma Heptulla, on the ground that rules did not 
permit a debate on a personal explanation. 
  Angry opposition members persisted, claiming that Capt. 
Sharma's explanation was bereft of facts and contained nothing 
but a string of denials. They said it could not therefore be 
categorised as a "personal explanation" and instead should be 
treated as a suo moto statement, on which they had a 
right to ask questions. Congress members were equally vociferous 
as they banded together to shout down the opposition members, 
insisting that Capt. Sharma's explanation did not call for a 
debate. 
  Ms Heptulla, however, remained unmoved. She cited the case 
of 
Ms Maneka Gandhi, who as environment minister, had made a 
personal explanation in the Rajya Sabha following certain 
allegations by the Congress party, which was then seated in the 
opposition benches. Ms Heptulla reminded the members that even 
at that time, she had given a similar ruling and disallowed a 
debate. There cannot be different sets of rules for different 
persons at different times, she added. 
  The entire drama lasted nearly 40 minutes as both sides 
stuck 
to their views. Mr S. Jaipal Reddy (Janata Dal) pointed out that 
since Capt. Sharma's statement was in response to notices 
submitted by members it could not be treated as a personal 
explanation. He argued that since the minister's clarification 
was sought on record, it is implied that the matter is before 
the council for consideration. 
  The Lok Sabha speaker Mr Shivraj Patil also disallowed any 
discussion. There was a procedural wrangle, with Mr George 
Fernandes (Janata Dal) demanding a debate. Mr P.K. Bansal 
(Congress), rising on a point of order, quoted rule 357 and said 
no discussion could be held on the statement. It was upheld by 
the Speaker. 
  Mr Fernandes referred to his letter on the subject addressed 
to the speaker and to the minister and asserted that the later 
had to reply to all the 32 points raised by him. The speaker, 
however, stuck to his ruling, pointing out that most of the 
points in any case did not relate to the minister. 
  Earlier the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] president, Mr K.L. 
Advani, pointed out that while members of the Rajya Sabha could 
seek clarifications on such statements, members of the Lok Sabha 
could not do so. He suggested that an exception be made in this 
case in view of its importance. 
  When Mr Jaswant Singh, deputy leader of the BJP, started 
reading our part of a document to "establish the nexus" between 
the minister and the NRI [nonresident Indian] concerned, the 
speaker restrained him, saying he had to go by the rules. The 
BJP member stated that not only the transfer of funds but also 
the acquisition of major companies was involved. A reference by 
him to the Congress party evoked strong protests from the 
treasury benches. 
  Capt. Sharma's clarification was in response to the charges 
levelled by Mr Jaswant Singh in the Lok Sabha and by Mr J.P. 
Mathur (BJP) and Mr Ashis Sen (CPM [Communist Party of 
India-Marxist]) in the Rajya Sabha on the basis of certain 
documents and reports in a Delhi daily. 
  Replying to Mr Jaswant Singh's charge about disclosure of 
policy decision, Capt. Sharma said the member had not cared to 
point out which particular policy was disclosed to unauthorised 
persons. "I may take this opportunity to point out that the 
allegations published in the INDIAN EXPRESS related to some fax 
communication regarding the disclosure of the 'discovered oil 
field programme' ... This programme was approved by the 
government as early as July 2, 1992 which was then announced 
globally by means of booklets. Hence there is no question of my 
disclosing it to any person unauthorisedly," he stated.

  [Text] New Delhi, December 25--To make every serving 
personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) sensitive 
to violations of human rights, a special three-day capsule 
course has been introduced by its training branch. 
  The course is to be conducted at regular intervals. 
  Training is any day more beneficial than punishing the 
erring 
personnel, said the paramilitary force's officiating director 
general, Mr S.V.M. Tripathi, while addressing the annual press 
conference here. 
  "That is why we decided to correct our men at the beginning 
itself. This capsule course will not only teach them the basics 
of human rights but even familiarise them with the international 
scenario," explained Mr Tripathi. 
  Every personnel of this paramilitary force is also being 
supplied a booklet of guidelines regarding the human rights. 
"This booklet will tell the personnel about the dos and donts in 
particular situations," he added. As of now, our men at times do 
not know how to proceed in peculiar situations, said Mr Tripathi. 
  He reiterated the organisation's attitude towards the 
errings 
officials as also the jawans. He said numerous men and officers 
were summarily dismissed from service or they suffered reduction 
in rank and pay and even compulsory retirement, in cases where 
charges of human right violations got substantiated against 
them. He said during the last year, there have been no reports 
of such violations by the CRPF. 
  The paramilitary force, mainly deployed in Punjab, Jammu and 
Kashmir, the Terai region of Uttar Pradesh and north eastern 
part of India, has had significant success while handling 
counterinsurgency operations. Till November, this year, the CRPF 
liquidated 150 militants and caught another 645. Over 450 fire 
arms, including AK 47, 56 and 74 assault rifles and rocket 
launchers, were seized by the CRPF personnel during this period. 
  Talking about the Rapid Action Force (RAF), Mr Tripathi said 
in another three months time the remaining five battalions of 
RAF too would be raised. At the time of its inception, RAF was 
to have ten battalions but due to commitments, only five could 
be raised. 
  The CRPF has also taken over nearly 25,000 hectares of 
forest 
area in Orissa, where the organisation would not merely be 
responsible for the protection of it but even make efforts for 
its upkeep and maintenance, he revealed. 
  The officiating director-general also disclosed the recent 
approval by the government of their proposal to convert two 
battalions into Training battalions. With this, the CRPF would 
now be in a position to give training to its men on rotational 
basis, which so far has not been possible because of pressures.

<F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "LCA Fabrication Begins"] </F>
  [Text] Bangalore, December 17--The Defence Research and 
Development Organisation (DRDO) has already begun metal cutting 
and fabrication of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) and has 
frozen the existing design and configuration. 
  The LCA, which is a DRDO project, is expected to roll out in 
March 1985 and test flown for the first time in June 1986. 
[sentence as published] The period in between--called the 
systems integration test phase--will involve the necessary 
extensive tests before the plane actually flies. 
  The DRDO is simultaneously also working on developing a 
naval version of the LCA meant to be operated from aircraft 
carriers. Its test flight will take place only after that of the 
air force version. 
  However, it will not have a vertical take-off and landing 
capability as is the case with the Sea Harrier of British 
origin, presently in the Indian navy's inventory. 
  Similarly, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which is 
also 
working on developing a naval version of the Advance Light 
Helicopter [ALH], is scheduled to test fly the prototype 
sometime next year. The naval version is slated to have 
anti-submarine warfare, anti-shipping and early warning 
capabilities. The Indian Navy currently makes use of the Russian 
Ka 28 and the British Sea King helicopters for anti-submarine 
warfare. 
  The DRDO has been conducting extensive wind-tunnel testing 
for the LCA's aerodynamic performance. The venues of conducting 
very high speed wind tunnel and other specialised testings have 
ranged from Onera in France, Calspan and AEDC [expansion not 
given] in the United States, and Tsagi near Moscow in Russia in 
the last two years. 
  Some more tests for fine tuning its performance is scheduled 
to be carried out at the Central Aerodynamic Research Institute, 
located near Moscow early next year. 
  The contract signed with Martin Marietta earlier this year 
to 
jointly develop a fly-by-wire flight control system for the LCA 
is expected to fructify in early 1985. [sentence as published] 
The Flight Control System, which will be similar to that being 
fitted in the Swedish JAS 39 Gripen, will involve computers, 
rate of turn, acceleration and air data sensors and actuators. 
  Discussions are on for seeking Martin Marietta's help in 
developing an armed version of the ALH for the army which is to 
be fitted with a 20-mm gun. 
  Martin Marietta has made offers to fit the APG 27 radar in 
both the LCA and for the upgraded version of the MiG-21. The 
American firm claims that the radar has a look down range of 21 
miles, a look up range of about 27 miles, apart from electronic 
counter measures matching the F-16s available with the Pakistani 
air force. 
  The current bilateral contact on the Flight Control System 
for the LCA involves complete transfer of technology to the 
aeronautical defence establishment Martin Marietta has claimed 
that the technology is at par with that fitted in the new 
generation B-2 Stealth bomber and the F-18 multi-role combat 
aircraft. This is the first time that they will be co-developing 
a system with a foreign country. 
  The Kaveri engine for the LCA, currently in an early stage 
of 
its development by DRDO, is scheduled to be ground test run by 
September 1994. It will, however, have to be taken abroad for 
high-altitude testing owing to the limitations in this facility 
in India. 
  As per an agreement signed with the United States, India is 
getting 11 General Electric GE-404 engines for the initial 
prototypes of the LCA. 
  The indigenously developed Kaveri is meant to replace the 
GE-404 engines. 
  The LCA will cater to a track-while-scan capability of up to 
eight targets, a laser designation pod, and complete software 
controls for an extremely versatile multi-role capability. The 
light supersonic fighter is to be fitted with a Beyond Visual 
Range capability of up to 60 km, a variety of state-of-the-art 
missiles, and a mission preparation and retrieval unit.

<F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "A Lacklustre Air Show"] </F>
  [Text] Bangalore, December 17--The phased array Rajendra 
Radar integrated with the Akash missiles, which is India's 
indigenously developed equivalent of the Patriot missile system, 
the Pilotless Target Aircraft (PTA) and the first full-scale 
mock-up of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) were the star 
attractions of India's indigenous defence development programme 
at the three-day international air show, Avia-India '93, which 
started yesterday near Yelahanka, about 20 km from here. 
  Singapore is understood to have shown interest in the PTA, 
named Lakshya, which has been jointly produced by the 
Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) and the Defence 
Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The Rajendra 
Radar, with a C3-I (command control communication and 
intelligence) configuration, is undergoing trials and is 
scheduled to be set for induction by the end of next year. The 
LCA is scheduled to roll out in March 1995 and test flown for 
the first time at Bangalore in June 1996. 
  From the defence point of view, the air show proved to be a 
lacklustre affair with a token aircraft representation of two 
Mirage 2000C, multi-role fighters of the French Air Force. 
Neither Russia, which is India's largest source of defence 
equipment and military aircraft, nor the United States or any 
other western country had flown in any type of defence aircraft 
for either air or static display. For example, there was neither 
the much promised Russian Su 27 long-range interceptor nor 
either of the U.S. multi-role F-15/F-16 multirole aircraft. The 
only other military aircraft for static and air display was the 
heavy lift Transol transport aircraft, also belonging to the 
French Air Force. 
  Even the Indian Air Force was not adequately represented at 
the air show providing for merely fly-pasts of two types of 
fighters--the Jaguar and MiG 29, and three types of 
choppers--Cheetah, Chetak and the Mi-8. The air display was 
inaugurated by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal 
S.K. Kaul. 
  The Indian Navy was more effectively represented by a 
magnificent air display of the Vertical Take Off and Landing 
(VTOL) capable Sea Harrier of British origin and the Ka-28, 
anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter of Russian origin. The 
Navy even managed a fly-past of the impressive long-bodied TU 
142 long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft of Russian 
origin. 
  Hindustan Aeronautics Limited displayed a variety of both 
indigenously developed and foreign collaborated helicopters and 
fighter and transport aircraft. The Army and air force version 
of the HAL manufactured Advance Light Helicopter (ALH) provided 
both a fly-past and air display. However, the only modern 
aircraft that formed part of the HAL's static display inventory 
was the Jaguar, a deep penetration strike aircraft (DPSA) of 
British origin. The others were the Indian-manufactured Kiran 
jet trainer, the HPT 32 basic trainer, the German origined 
Dornier 228 transport aircraft, the phased-out Gnat and Marut 
fighters, and the Chetak light helicopter. 
  The most dynamic and heart-stopping performance in the 
otherwise unimpressive air display was that of the Mirage 2000C 
flown by French Air Force pilots. The mid-air combat manoeuvre 
by the fighter version of the Mirage 2000C left the public and 
defense officials gaping. The manoeuvres involved the French 
pilot stretching himself up to 9g in side and vertical combat 
manoeuvres and over -2g in an outward combat manoeuvre. 
  The other static display of interest was a full-scale 
mock-up 
of the upgraded version of the MiG 21 (bis) redesignated as the 
MiG-21-93. However, the aircraft has the same engine and air 
frame although its avionics, weapon delivery system and weaponry 
are comparable with the state-of-the-art MiG-29 air superiority 
interceptor. 
  Interestingly, the Israeli Aircraft Industry (IAI) had set 
up 
a mock-up display of an upgraded cockpit of a MiG-21 (bis), 
redesignated the MiG-21-2000, in its indoor stall fitted with an 
avionics and weapon systems claiming to be even more superior to 
the Russian package.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Iran Increases Its Support For </F>
`Hamas' in Order to Cause the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement to 
Fail"] 
  [Text] Iran, according to official sources in Tehran 
yesterday, has agreed to a major increase in the aid being 
provided to Hamas and the other hard-line Palestinian movements 
in order to prevent the agreements concluded between the PLO and 
Israel from being put into effect. 
  The announcement, which dealt with the Iranian commitments 
concerning increasing the financial, diplomatic, and 
media-related support provided by Tehran to this movement, was 
made during meetings that were held between Iranian leaders and 
a Hamas delegation currently visiting Iran, which is headed by 
Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the movement's Political Bureau, and 
Ibrahim Ghawshah, its official spokesman. So far the delegation 
has held a series of meetings with high-ranking Iranian 
political, military, and security officials. In order to 
underscore Iran's determination to more effectively oppose the 
agreements concluded between the PLO and Israel, Iran's 
spiritual leader, 'Ali Khamene'i, also met with the Hamas 
delegation. It should be pointed out that Khamene'i, as of the 
last few weeks, has personally taken over the supervision of 
Iran's efforts to frustrate the peace process. 
  Analysts are of the opinion that there are indications of 
the 
existence of differences in points of view between Iran and 
Hamas. 
  In an interview given yesterday by Abu-Marzuq to the 
newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, which is published by Khamene'i, 
the Hamas leader expressed his belief that the PLO and Israel 
would not be able to accomplish the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho by the 13 December deadline. Abu-Marzuq hinted that 
the agreement would fail because of the contradictions inherent 
in it. He also expected that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's current mission to the Middle East would be a 
failure. The Hamas leader's point of view is close to that of 
Syria, which is that it is necessary to remain uninvolved in the 
agreement between the PLO and Israel and thus allow it to fail. 
  However, Iran believes that it is necessary to take 
additional measures in order to guarantee that this agreement 
fail. These measures, according to statements by the Iranian 
media, should include escalation of the armed conflict and 
intensification of the intifadah. 
  But Abu-Marzuq is apparently convinced that the agreement 
still has the support of the Palestinians and that any parties 
attempting to blow it up might thus be risking their political 
positions. Hamas leaders also affirm that it is necessary not to 
provide Israel and the PLO with a pretext for holding Hamas and 
other hard-line groups responsible for the "inevitable failure" 
of their agreements. 
  In his interview, Abu-Marzuq said the plan for autonomy, no 
matter how limited, can never work as long as the Israeli 
settlers do not withdraw from the occupied territories. 
Khamene'i had decided to call for the holding of an 
international conference to be attended by the parties and 
nations opposed to the agreement. But he failed to obtain the 
support of Syria and the Palestinian groups for such a 
conference. 
  Apparently the idea of forming a new "rejectionist front" 
has 
been delayed until next year. One of the reasons for the delay 
has been Syria's wish to bide its time in order to see what can 
be achieved by means of U.S. mediation. 
  Another reason is the fact that the hard-line Palestinian 
groups believe that Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat, during the 
next few months, will exhaust his supply of good intentions and 
thus pave the way for the emergence of a new leadership that 
will be more of the hard-line type. 
  The final reason is that the Arab hard-liners are reluctant 
to hand over the reins of control of an Arab issue to a non-Arab 
country, that is, Iran.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "$30 Million Funds for Projects in </F>
Occupied Territories This Year"] 
  [Text] Abu Dhabi--Gulf development funds are expected to 
play a prominent role in the development process in the occupied 
Arab territories when the Gaza-Jericho agreement is implemented. 
  Dr. Badr Malallah, the general coordinator of the Arab 
development funds, has said that the Gulf funds have been 
assigned by their governments to fully implement and supervise 
development projects in the occupied Arab territories in 
cooperation with the World Bank. 
  He said, in remarks made on the occasion of the 35th meeting 
of the coordination group of the national and regional Arab 
development organizations, which got underway yesterday in Abu 
Dhabi, that contacts were ongoing between the funds and the 
World Bank to set up a mechanism for future cooperation in the 
development process in light of the $2 billion "assistance deal" 
that was decided upon in the assistance donor countries last 
October in Washington. 
  The Gulf states have so far promised to give $150 million, 
of 
which $100 million will come from Saudi Arabia, $25 million from 
the United Arab Emirates, and the same sum from Kuwait. Malallah 
indicated that these amounts were not final, but merely the 
first step in supporting "the course of development in 
Palestine." He said that the Arab Fund for Economic and Social 
Development [AFESD] would present a report in the meeting about 
its experience in funding development projects in the occupied 
Arab territories. He added that this report would help the rest 
of the funds find a common direction for future cooperation in 
supporting development in the autonomous Palestinian areas. He 
indicated that AFESD had 10 years of experience in this field. 
  For his part, Isma'il al-Zirani, director of operations of 
AFESD, said that the volume of AFESD's operations in the 
occupied Arab territories, from the time of its establishment 
until the present, amounted to $40 million. He said that AFESD 
would fund $30 million worth of projects in those areas in the 
current year.

<F P=106> [Article by Shafiq al-Asadi in Abu Dhabi] </F>
  [Text] Eight Arab and regional development funds began 
meeting in Abu Dhabi yesterday to coordinate their future 
development operations. 
  Sources in the meeting confirmed that the study would focus 
on unifying their participation in these funds in development 
operations in Gaza and Jericho, in light of the experience of 
the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development [AFESD] in its 
development efforts in Palestine. These sources told AL-HAYAH 
that the meeting, held at the technical office and director of 
operations levels in these funds, would discuss the enacting of 
a working plan to publicize their role in development operations 
globally and in the Arab world. They confirmed that the plan 
included the issuing of various courses and the production of a 
television program and intense media campaigns explaining the 
role of these institutions in Arab development work as well as 
on the level of developing countries. The sources indicated that 
this plan was essential after the Gulf war, when these funds' 
activities were conducted without seeking attention. 
  The sources told AL-HAYAH that the directors of operations 
would conduct a comprehensive assessment of the results of the 
operations of these funds in the Arab countries and other 
developing countries and put new conditions on the funds' loans. 
These would include disbursing them directly to the 
developmental operations for which they were granted. Director 
general of the Abu Dhabi Development Fund, Khalifah Muhammad 
al-Muhayri, confirmed the new business that will be discussed in 
this meeting. 
  He said that "the huge scale of these institutions' activity 
makes it incumbent on us to monitor the extent of the developing 
countries' benefit from the aid and loans we give them, as well 
as the extent to which those countries comply with the rules and 
measures of our institutions, which are aimed at the best choice 
of projects for us to fund, and guarantee the soundest 
implementation at the lowest cost and promptest time, to serve 
development and achieve the goal for which the loan was made." 
  Al-Muhayri explained in his keynote speech to the 35th 
meeting of the coordination group of the national and regional 
Arab development institutions his belief in the need for the 
coordination group to study the effects of recent global changes 
on the political, economic, and geographic fronts, along with 
the accompanying results and the extent to which these results 
are reflected in the group's institutions, in order to be able 
to plan policies in line with these changes in the contemporary 
world, and to prepare for all future eventualities. 
  Al-Muhayri reaffirmed the need to intensify efforts and 
support the existing cooperation between these institutions with 
their interests and the interests of development in the 
developing countries. Al-Muhayri also reaffirmed the need for 
the collective funding of projects in cases where there is ample 
will for funding in the relevant country, thus helping to 
respect the terms and rules in effect for the action of these 
institutions, especially when there is plenty of early 
coordination between them. The director general of the Abu Dhabi 
Development Fund said that the volume of Arab development aid 
from 1970 through 1992 amounted to nearly $94 billion, of which 
nearly $36.5 billion had been provided by the eight funds taking 
part in the meeting. One hundred and five Arab and developing 
countries benefited from this aid, which went to implement 2,665 
funding operations. Al-Muhayri disclosed, in his remarks, the 
existence of the problem of arrears in the debts of countries 
receiving development aid from the institutions. He asserted the 
need to make an effort to try to find suitable methods for 
solving this problem and for prodding countries which are slow 
to pay their debts and commitments. This would strengthen the 
institutions' ability to offer more loans and aid, to move the 
development process forward, and help the developing countries 
to overcome the difficulties they face in the development 
process. 
  Informed sources told AL-HAYAH that the volume of arrears 
owed to the eight funds had amounted to nearly $2.101 billion at 
the end of 1992, representing 5.88 percent of the volume of the 
development aid they had offered. 
  The greatest volume of arrears are owed to the Arab Monetary 
Fund, with $622.5 million, representing 25.38 percent of its 
total loans, worth $2.457 billion, followed by the Saudi Fund, 
whose arrears amounted to $357.995 million, representing 6.14 
percent of its $5.826 billion in loans; and the Kuwaiti Fund, 
with $292 million in arrears, or 4.03 percent of its $7.240 
billion in loans. The OPEC Fund had $196.6 million in arrears, 
or 7.03 percent of its $2.798 billion in loans, followed by the 
AFESD with $188.46 million in arrears, or 3.32 percent of its 
nearly $5.672 billion in loans; the Arab Bank for Economic 
Development in Africa, with $181.5 million in arrears, or 16.41 
percent of its $1.106 billion in loans; followed, lastly, by the 
Islamic Development Bank, with $178.8 million in arrears, or 
1.97 percent of its $9.09 billion in loans. 
  Sources in the developmental institutions' coordination 
group 
said that the arrears problem had not limited their activity in 
carrying out their role in offering development aid to the 
developing countries. 
  Dr. Badr Malallah, the official in charge of these 
developmental institutions, said that they had provided nearly 
$1.245 billion in the first half of 1993 to participate in the 
funding of 133 development operations benefiting 49 developing 
countries in addition to several groups, organizations, and 
other agencies. 
  These funds were distributed among 23 loans worth $1.027 
billion in various service and production sectors, $2.3 million 
to fund foreign trade, and $15 million to fund numerous 
activities in the field of research and the preparation of 
feasibility, teaching, training, and health studies. Dr. 
Malallah said that the distribution of the aid according to the 
funding sources was 33.6 percent from the Arab Fund, 28.5 
percent from the Kuwaiti Fund, 19.7 percent from the Islamic 
Bank, 44 percent from the Abu Dhabi Development Fund, 4.8 
percent from the OPEC Fund, 3 percent from the Saudi Fund, 4.9 
percent from the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, 
and 1.1 percent from the Arab Monetary Fund.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques de Barrin: "A Very Political Soldier"] </F>
  [Text] On Sunday 16 January, when he appeared on the TV 
screen in the middle of prime time to call the entire political 
class to order, many Algerians told themselves--once their 
surprise was over--that General Lamine Zeroual, who had been 
recalled from retirement six months earlier to become minister 
of defense, was someone who might have to be reckoned with. Had 
he not warned the country's "living forces" that it was their 
"national duty" to "help overcome the crisis"? Had he not 
promised everyone that "the Armed Forces will not stand idly by 
in the face of dangerous deviations and excesses"? Had he not 
given his compatriots reason to hope that "the desired rupture 
depends on the establishment of a new national system"? 
  Lamine Zeroual was born in Batna, "capital" of the Aures 
Mountains and site of the first struggles for independence, on 3 
July 1941. His fellow soldiers Gen. Khaled Nezzar, former member 
of the Higher State Council, and Gen.l Bennabes Gheziel, the 
current commandant of the Gendarmerie, are from the same town. 
At 16 years of age, Zeroual joined the ranks of the National 
Liberation Army (ALN). When peace came, he was sent abroad for 
military training: first to Moscow and then to Paris. Pursuing a 
conventional and uneventful career, Zeroual was given command of 
the Applied Weapons School in Batna in 1975 and then of the 
Combined Arms Military Academy in Cherchell in 1981. After that 
he was named head of several military regions in succession: 
Tamanrasset in the Sahara in 1982, Bechar on the Moroccan border 
in 1984, and Constantine in the eastern part of the country in 
1987. 
  After being promoted to general in 1988, Zeroual was 
appointed commanding general of the ground forces. His military 
career was interrupted at that point: as the result of 
disagreement with Chief of Staff Gen. Nezzar and President 
Chadli, both of whom supported a professional military no longer 
under the control of officers from the ALN, he hung up his 
uniform in December 1989. He was appointed ambassador to 
Romania, but remained in that post for less than a year, 
preferring to retire completely from public life. Contrary to 
all expectations, Zeroual, who is married and has three 
children, again stepped to the front of the political stage last 
10 July, when he was called upon to succeed Gen. Nezzar as 
minister of defense. On 24 October, during his first public 
speech, he called on "the political and progressive forces" to 
"work together to find a consensus solution to the crisis before 
the end of the year." In his eyes, that solution "must conform 
to the ideals of November (1954)." 
<H5>  `Loss of Confidence' </H5>
  On 16 January, the untalkative but very "political" soldier 
became insistent, deploring "the weakness of a system that 
allowed the emergence of a parasitic ideological 
movement"--meaning the Islamic movement. Acknowledging "the loss 
of confidence in a government whose words are in complete 
contradiction with its actual practice," he advocated a "real 
break with the behavior and management methods of the past." 
  Will Gen. Zeroual keep his word? He is not well-known to the 
public, and no one knows exactly how he will behave with the 
reins of power in his hands. Meeting with him during a visit to 
Algiers in mid-November, Jean-Pierre Chevenement's first 
impression was that the general did not have the makings of a 
Pinochet.

<F P=106> [Article by F. Metaoui: "Security: The Foreign Women's </F>
Tragedy"] 
  [Text] The International Committee To Support Algerian 
Intellectuals (CISIA) set up in Berlin, Germany, intends to 
start, next March, an awareness campaign on the serious 
situation existing in Algeria. 
  The committee was set up a few days after Smail Yefsah's 
assassination, last October; in addition to its normal 
activities, it has been concerned for some time by the flow of 
foreign families residing in Algeria who return to their native 
country. 
  According to Mr. Sadek Kebir, a member of the German CISIA, 
the situation is dramatic. "Recently, we were contacted by 
foreign women married to Algerians and who lived in our country 
for a long time, among the working class. Since armed groups 
started attacking foreigners, they left Algeria, against their 
will. All of a sudden, they find themselves in Germany, in the 
Netherlands, in Poland, or in Russia, where they have 
practically no family," Mr. Kebir observed; he believes that 
these women discover that their countries are totally different, 
and therefore have problems adjusting. "The entire world is 
looking at us." 
  "We must study the situation of these foreign women. If 
someone is to be murdered because of who he is, we might perhaps 
understand that, but attacking innocent individuals because they 
don't look like Algerians, shooting at them, that is racism or 
even fascism," he said, adding that these women are sounding the 
alarm bell. "If we let that happen, neither the world nor 
history will forgive us," he said gravely. 
  For Sadek Kebir, it becomes imperative to appeal to the 
people to make them understand that these foreigners "must enjoy 
every protection." In support of his position, he pointed out 
that in Germany, as everywhere else in Europe, the Algerian 
people enjoy a good reputation for their sense of hospitality. 
"Distrust of foreigners must disappear." 
  "The women who contacted us said that they want to live in 
Algeria but are afraid of terrorism," Mr. Kebir stated, adding 
that the FLN [National Liberation Front] regime did a lot of 
damage in that it consistently denied Algerian citizenship to 
foreigners who applied for it. 
  "The women who called on us came back with their children. 
Before leaving with their mothers, these children attended 
Algerian state schools. What are we going to do with these 
children who, until proven otherwise, are Algerians?" Faced with 
these many problems, the CISIA is creating a European 
association to support these families in distress, help them get 
through these bad times, and show "our full solidarity." 
  "For us, the essential is to publicize the problem and 
inform 
public opinion." 
  In addition, Mr. Kebir stated that applications for 
political 
asylum in Germany are not as numerous as is generally thought. 
"People must know that applications for asylum are not processed 
at state level. German law gives German institutions full 
latitude to decide on such demands. It is a mere problem of 
legality, not high-level politics," he said, indicating that the 
CISIA is attempting by all means to inform the Germans as to the 
situation that prevails in the country. 
  "We would like to make them aware of the violence. If 
Algeria 
must face this phenomenon today, the entire Maghreb will be 
affected tomorrow, although the Europeans have begun to grasp 
what is at stake since the Yugoslav conflict broke out." 
  Mr. Kebir denies the fact that Germany is used as a rear 
base 
by Islamist fundamentalists. "Although it is true that the FIS 
[Islamic Salvation Front] is known in this country, nevertheless 
Germany has self-respecting institutions. The State is far from 
supporting any form of activism," he indicated. In closing we 
should note that the CISIA will soon have representatives in 
Amsterdam, Holland.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Reda Bekkat: "What Legitimacy?"] </F>
  [Text] Is the national conference heading for failure now 
that three of the largest parties deny it their support? In 
fact, less than three days before the start of the conference, 
the FLN [National Liberation Front] declined the commission's 
invitation, thus following the example of the FFS [Socialist 
Forces Front] and the RCD [Rally for Culture and Democracy]. 
  It is not unlikely that other major parties or social 
organizations may follow the boycott movement. We are thinking 
of employers' organizations, in particular the UGTA [General 
Union of Algerian Workers] which, recently again, denounced the 
methods and men of a regime that it demands should resign. 
Already, however, with such conspicuous absences, we cannot fail 
to wonder whether the national conference will retain any 
legitimacy, any credibility, especially as far as the objectives 
assigned to it are concerned. 
  Apart from a certain consensus on the draft platform and the 
participants' commitments during the transition period, which 
would be binding for political and social players, the 
conference should also approve whoever will be in charge during 
the transition period. 
  In other words, it should settle the matter of the HCE 
[Higher State Council] succession with the parties to the 
conference and representatives of the present government. 
  There is absolutely no doubt that the commission's 
legitimacy 
is considerably reduced by the absence of major political 
parties, including the one that used to be the single party but 
whose participation in the conference the members of the 
national dialogue commission nevertheless deemed necessary. 
  Under these conditions, how can the national conference 
legitimately take place, and how could any solutions adopted 
concerning who is to be in charge during the transition period 
be considered as emanating from a national consensus between 
political and social organizations? Undoubtedly, this is the 
dilemma that the initiators of the national dialogue must face. 
A deadlock, therefore, is possible. 
  In this case, we cannot help recalling the defense 
minister's 
statements, which some interpreted as a warning to the political 
class in general and to the parties in particular, against any 
attempt at obstruction.

<F P=106> [Article by Zineb Oubouchou: "Abroad: Algerians Who Have </F>
Become Undesirable"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] No matter where they go, Algerians have now become 
undesirable. Recently, several countries cracked down on illegal 
aliens carrying the green Algerian passport. Tens of arrests 
were followed by deportation to Algeria. 
  This has become so widespread that in the past few days the 
border police was overwhelmed by an increasing number of 
deported Algerians. In November for instance, 26 Algerians were 
deported from France and returned to their native country. 
According to French security services, they were in an illegal 
situation. 
  One month later, some 40 natives of the Maghreb were 
arrested 
and found to possess false identity papers. 
  French authorities wanted to deport them to Algeria. 
However, 
our Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to receive them because, 
we were told, these individuals' citizenship was not 
established. It also seems that 20 of the 40 individuals that 
were to be deported to our country either had AIDS or were drug 
addicts. 
  In Germany, over 40 Algerians suffered the same fate. 
Fifteen 
of them were deported earlier this week. The reason for this 
decision was the same as the one given by French authorities, 
i.e., they were in an illegal situation. 
  Even Poland, the ideal country for most black-market 
traffickers, is cracking down on Algerians. Contrary to the 
other cases we just mentioned, Polish security services did not 
bother to check the identity of Algerian tourists. 
  They just turned back the Air Algeria aircraft when it 
landed 
in Warsaw, without any explanation, we were told. 
  Surprised by the new regulation that Belgian Embassy 
officials started applying recently, an Algerian assured us that 
to obtain a Belgian visa you must pay 165 French francs [Fr]. 
"As a businessman, I went to the embassy with a letter stating 
my mission, that is a perfectly legal recommendation. All the 
same, Belgian Embassy officials demanded payment in foreign 
currency. Knowing that this is quite illegal, I declined to do 
so. Then, they denied me a visa," this man told us. 
  The most tragic case was that of the 10 or so Algerian 
"black-market traffickers" who were arrested by Libyan security 
services after going through the Debdeb border post with all 
their papers in order. According to these "black-market 
traffickers," the Libyan police took them to a police station, 
handcuffed and blindfolded. Then, the police confiscated their 
identity papers and their passports before releasing them. Some 
of the individuals involved testified that the police gave them 
back their papers only on condition that they spend on the local 
market any foreign currency they owned. 
  In spite of all these humiliations, the rush to consulates 
is 
undescribable. The French consulate in Algiers illustrates 
rather well this situation. Yesterday, drastic means had to be 
used to disperse the huge crowd that had gathered at the main 
entrance. 
  An impressive police contingent was deployed around the 
consulate, on Place des Martyrs. 
  The security of the consulate was ensured by blue minitanks 
followed by Nissan vehicles carrying armed "ninjas." At times, 
when citizens attempted to cross the line, the police fired 
warning shots to frighten the most obstinate.

<F P=106> [Article by K. Goulmamine: "Telecommunications: Opening Up </F>
to the World Through Fiber Optic"--first paragraph is LIBERTE 
introduction] 
  [Text] The submarine fiber-optic cable section inaugurated 
yesterday morning will connect our country to many other 
continents. Algeria is opening up to the world. 
  The project in which Algeria is a shareholder consists in 
fact in curing the telecommunication sector of the mediocrity 
that characterized it. At the same time, Algeria's 
communications with the world will be improved. To this end, a 
link with South and East Asia, the Middle East, and West Europe 
was established. 
  More precisely, this telecommunication network section will 
connect Algeria to the five other Maghreb countries, through 
20,000 telephone lines and 16 television channels. 
  This is the first section of the telecommunication 
electronic 
highway. Through a submarine section, Algeria will be connected 
to Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, 
Italy and, finally, France. 
  According to a Channel-1 radio news broadcast, the first 
section of the submarine cable will connect Algiers to 
Marseille. The Algerian part consists of 900 km of optical 
fiber, and the signal will be amplified by repeaters placed 
every 100 km. The estimated cost of the project is 90 million 
French francs [Fr] for 8,000 lines. The Algiers-Marseille link 
was acquired by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and 
will become operational soon. 
  It was announced that, from now on, nearly all governorates 
will be connected to the national digital network. Over 100,000 
subscribers are already connected. To relieve congestion at the 
Algiers telephone center, the sections created in Oran, 
Constantine, and Ghardaia were decentralized. The 1993 
telecommunication plan also covered communication security. To 
achieve this, Mr. Hassene Daffer explained, "the creation of 
electronic highways will prove very useful to connect large 
regional poles and large national transit centers. Several 
sections are already in operation between Algiers, the South and 
the West of the country." 
  Digital systems are increasingly used in Algeria. In the 
very 
heart of the capital, several computerized centers are already 
in operation in some districts. According to Mr. Daffer, setting 
up such centers nationwide will make it possible to meet 96 
percent of pending applications very quickly and under favorable 
conditions. Nevertheless, a few towns in the East will have to 
wait until March 1994. Other projects are being considered, for 
instance an Algeria-Palma link by 1996, via a fiber-optic 
submarine cable. 
  As you will recall, optical fiber is a means of transport 
that involves carrying laser beams through a 1.5-micron thick 
fiber. It was introduced in Algeria during the eighties. Since 
then, test sites have been set up and have enabled experts to 
master the project and the technology.

dedication, by M.B. and A.B.; place and date not given] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Mr. Li Dingfan, Head of the Chinese Delegation: `A Sound 
Base for Scientific Development in Algeria' </H3>
  Vice-minister of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Li 
Dingfan is also vice-president of the Chinese Atomic Energy 
Agency and a university professor. In addition to his functions, 
he was heading the Chinese delegation that helped build the Es 
Salem reactor. He kindly answered our questions on this project, 
which constitutes a symbol of Algerian-Chinese friendship. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] How would you evaluate this project? 
  [Dingfan] Today is a joyful day for everybody. It is an 
important page in Chinese-Algerian collaboration. It is 
memorable. I expressed this in writing in the visitors' book. I 
hope that this blossom of nuclear science and technology, grown 
by the Algerian and Chinese parties, will bear fruit as soon as 
possible. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] What does this project mean to you? 
  [Dingfan] It is the living symbol of cooperation in 
development through energy. At least, it is a sound base for 
scientific development in Algeria. We may say that it boosts the 
Algerian people's reputation throughout the world. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] Will the Algerian-Chinese cooperation in the 
nuclear sector continue? 
  [Dingfan] If there is a desire for cooperation, there is no 
doubt that we shall be available and present. We have been 
collaborating for six years. 
  I hope that Algeria will be able to continue its development 
peaceably and peacefully. I wish that the people may enjoy the 
benefits of this reactor. 
<H3>  Mr. Abdellah Laid (Doctor in Nuclear Physics): 
`Possibilities for Serious Work' </H3>
  Being a researcher at Ain-Oussera is not a pleasure; it is a 
passion which, alone, makes it possible to overcome all 
problems. Mr. Abdellah Laid is head of research at the physics 
department. He talked to us about it. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] How important would you say this reactor is? 
  [Laid] It is very important for the future of the nuclear 
sector in Algeria. The entire nuclear sector will be 
concentrated around this site. The reactor design will allow the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy. For instance, we will be able to 
dope selenium, to produce radioisotopes, which are very 
important in Algeria for nuclear medicine and for the industry. 
Studies and surveys of manufacturers and hospitals throughout 
the country have shown that there is a large demand for 
radioisotopes. This reactor being equipped with irradiation 
channels, we can produce these radioisotopes for medicine and 
the industry. For research and agriculture, some radioisotopes 
are currently used in small amounts, but we can supply more now 
that we have this reactor. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] Could you tell me where you studied? 
  [Laid] I have a doctorate in nuclear physics. I studied my 
specialty in England for a few years. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] Have you received offers to work in other 
countries? 
  [Laid] Yes, but I preferred living in my country. It is very 
important for us. Especially considering that, this time, things 
are taken seriously and we have the possibility of doing serious 
work. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] Could you tell us how much you get paid? 
  [Laid] I cannot tell you. But it is insignificant compared 
with foreign offers. I am not interested in money; rather, I am 
interested in encouraging researchers and having them work 
around this tool. We have here a great many researchers who 
deserve every kind of encouragement. 
<H3>  The Minister of Foreign Affairs: `A Symbol of the 
Strengthening of Peace and Security' </H3>
  [EL MOUDJAHID] Mr. Minister, how would you evaluate this new 
nuclear acquisition? 
  [Minister] It is a universal factor for anything that has to 
do with the use of nuclear energy for peaceful ends, especially 
in the sectors of agriculture, health, and of course energy. 
Many countries produce nuclear electricity. In Algeria, there 
are huge potential uses for nuclear energy, including the 
desalination of sea water. Today, we very explicitly mentioned 
that our nuclear program was set up for peaceful purposes. 
Algeria solemnly announced that it now intends to adhere to the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty. This rules out any possibility 
of using it for military purposes. That was the message given at 
this inauguration. At the same time, we wanted the inauguration 
to take place under conditions of absolute openness. The 
international press as well as the entire diplomatic corps 
accredited in Algiers were present. This project is a symbol of 
the strengthening of international peace and security. It also 
shows that our country possesses a powerful scientific and 
technological potential, that Algeria is the kingpin of Maghreb 
and that it currently contributes much to consolidate not only 
Maghreb unity, but also everything that contributes to the 
economic, cultural and social development of the Maghreb 
community. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] How would you evaluate relations between 
Algeria and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]? 
  [Minister] Mostly, we should note that we have excellent 
relations with the IAEA. Its general director just sent a 
message on the occasion of this inauguration. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] This inauguration coincides with the 35th 
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between 
Algeria and China. How would you evaluate these relations? 
  [Minister] First, I would point out that these relations 
developed satisfactorily since, during our national liberation 
struggle, China was one of the first countries to recognize 
Algeria as a sovereign state aspiring to independence. After 
independence, we developed our relations and strengthened them 
in the economic, commercial, and cultural sectors. This Ain 
Oussera center is the best example of the development of our 
relations. 
<H3>  The Minister of National Education: `The Hard Core of 
Research' </H3>
  [EL MOUDJAHID] Could you tell us why it was the Ministry of 
National Education that was the nuclear reactor project leader? 
  [Minister] This project is in line with Algeria's research 
policy. The research sector depends on the ministry delegated to 
higher education which, as its name indicates, is itself 
delegated to the Ministry of National Education. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] What benefit does Algeria derive from this 
reactor project? 
  [Minister] It is an important, even a decisive stage, 
following the first stage, which was that of the Nour reactor. 
The latter was a 1-MGW [as published] research reactor. The new 
Essalam reactor has a 15-MGW power output; in other words, it 
allies research and production, especially the production of 
radioisotopes for agriculture, medicine, and pharmacy. It is 
also a future provider of services for product control and 
analysis through nuclear methods. We have reached a stage where 
Algeria can use this nuclear tool for its economic and social 
development. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] What benefits did Algeria derive from the 
operation of the first Nour reactor? 
  [Minister] In spite of its modest capacity, Nour enabled 
Algerian researchers to access the nuclear field for the first 
time. Note that this is the peaceful nuclear field since we are 
talking about peaceful nuclear activities. Nour enabled us to 
access this huge and extremely complex field, to familiarize us 
with it, and it enabled our researchers to master the essential 
aspects of nuclear-related research. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] Is the research personnel entirely Algerian? 
  [Minister] Yes, 100-percent Algerian; but we wish to 
increase 
their number. According to our Chinese friends' evaluations, 
Algerian researchers are of appreciable quality. They are young, 
very dynamic, dedicated in spite of difficult living conditions. 
Some are away from their families. Therefore, we should train 
more personnel so as to provide this reactor with optimum human 
capacities in order to benefit from all the possibilities it 
offers. Currently, there are fewer than 100 researchers and 
technicians; we should increase that number to 300 researchers, 
technicians, and engineers. 
  [EL MOUDJAHID] On several occasions, technicians and 
researchers mentioned their difficult working conditions. Have 
you considered taking care of their complaints? 
  [Minister] First, I would like to say that most of them were 
educated in Algeria, in universities and research institutes. We 
have 17 research centers, this is the 18th; in a way, it is the 
hard core. Its personnel was educated in Algerian schools and 
Algerian universities. I just promised them that we would very 
seriously consider the matter of their material living and 
working conditions. We must improve these conditions. 
<H5>  The Minister of Agriculture: `Multiple Applications' </H5>
  The impact on agricultural production is manifold. 
Applications to agronomic research are varied. To study problems 
of nutrition or fertilization, we often use fertilizers that 
have been rendered radioactive so we can see what happens to 
these elements in plant nutrition. There are various 
applications in plant biology, in conservation, and even in 
seawater desalination. 
  If we can manage to control desalination costs through the 
use of nuclear energy, it will be extremely useful for 
agriculture, through many future projects, for instance, in 
irrigation. The only problem is one of cost. At any rate, as far 
as conservation or fertilization are concerned, applications 
have become quite common in certain countries. 
  This might happen in our country, too. If we put our 
agricultural economy in order. The center is there; so are the 
researchers, and the land close by; all we have to do is to 
create the environment required to mobilize these capacities and 
technologies in order to enable certain sectors to use nuclear 
energy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Following Bad Weather in Hoggar: 584 </F>
Houses Uninhabitable"--first paragraph is ALGER REPUBLICAIN 
introduction] 
  [Text] In In-Amguel and Ideles, the two areas of the 
Ahaggar region that were hit hardest by late November rainfalls, 
584 houses showed cracks and are uninhabitable. This, according 
to the Tamanrasset governorate department of regulations and 
administration, is the final evaluation of the damage assessment 
commission. 
  According to the commission, four sectors were hit 
especially 
hard: housing, agriculture, water supply, and basic 
infrastructures. 
  Thus, 416 houses in Ideles and 118 in In-Amguel have become 
uninhabitable. As a result, governorate officials indicated, the 
Tamanrasset governorate initiated an emergency housing 
reconstruction program as part of communal development plans 
(PCDs) in order to cope with the emergency and provide housing 
for the homeless. 
  As far as agriculture is concerned, 120 hectares under 
irrigation were flooded, 70 motor pumps carried along by the 
deluge, and 100 range wells damaged. Hundreds of cattle, goats, 
and sheep were also lost. 
  The departments involved prepared an application to the 
National Natural Disaster Fund for any assistance and 
indemnities that may apply. 
  In the In-Amguel and Ideles areas, the drinking-water supply 
system was reported damaged over 3,000 meters, the discharge 
system over 850 meters. At In-Amguel, four drillings are deemed 
irreparably lost, and eight valves were carried along by the 
water. 
  The basic infrastructure sector, too, suffered extensive 
damage involving in particular 110 km of unpaved road, three 
crossings, 65 km of road shoulder, and a long section of Highway 
No. 1 between Tit and In-Amguel. 
  The Tamanrasset governorate declared an emergency concerning 
the repair of damaged drinking water lines and unpaved roads, 
and decided to launch an emergency housing construction program 
making it mandatory, this time, to use local stone as building 
material instead of the "toub" that disintegrates every time it 
rains. 
  Note that the president of the Algerian Association for 
Maladjusted Children (AAPEI), whom we contacted by telephone, 
indicated that the association would start distributing food to 
flood victims in the In-Amguel and Ideles areas on Saturday.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Egypt: A Newborn Every 25 Seconds; </F>
Population, 2.4 Million in 1801, Will Reach 94 Million by 2025"] 
  [Text] The population explosion is considered one of the 
biggest problems facing Egyptian society, with complex effects 
at the economic, social, and political levels. Grave problems 
are attributed to it, such as mounting terrorism and 
unemployment stemming from the scarcity of financial resources. 
The growth in population means the shrinking of cultivable land, 
in addition to mass emigration from the countryside to urban 
areas, and the accompanying negative factors with many-sided 
effects. 
  While the problem is not confined to Egypt alone, being an 
Arab and global problem, it is more serious in Egypt because of 
the rise in the unemployment rate, the lack of resources, and 
the drop in individual income. 
  The latest statistics released by the Central Statistics 
Agency show that the population of Egypt will be 73 million by 
the year 2000. The January census of last year counted 
58,987,000 Egyptians, which was a 676,000 increase over 1992, 
registering a 1.2 percent increase in six months. 
  The statistics indicate that the rate of increase in recent 
years has risen to 1,229,000 persons per year, with a new birth 
every 25 seconds. The rate of population increase has thus 
reached 2.3 percent. Although this is still high, it is lower 
than it was twenty years ago, when it stood at more than three 
percent. 
  Population experts believe that the rate of increase has 
significant and serious implications for the future of mankind 
in Egypt. This population explosion translates into a further 
decline in individual income, thereby having an impact on 
standards of living, education, health, and many other vital 
issues. 
  Since taking power, President Mubarak has continued to warn 
of the dangers of the population explosion, and has urged 
Egyptians to use birth control. He has said that in 10 years 
Egypt's population has added the equivalent of the entire Arab 
Gulf region. He added that in the year 2000 the population will 
have increased by 12.5 percent. Where were the resources for 
handling this increase? If the population does increase by that 
much, investment flight will occur. The Egyptian workforce is 21 
percent of the population, or 12 out of 59 million people. 
  It is worth noting that Egypt's population in 1801 was 2.4 
million, increasing to 9.8 million by 1897. By 1992, it had 
reached 59 million, and is expected to jump to 94 million by 
2025, making Egypt 17th in the ranking of the 25 most populous 
countries in the world. 
  Dr. Mahir Mahran, minister of state for population and 
family 
affairs, has rather different estimates, as he believes it is 
necessary to differentiate in the statistics between the 
population residing in Egypt--56 million--and those residing 
abroad, now nearly three million. He indicates that the number 
of births, despite the large increase, is considered to be in 
constant decline. The number of births last year was down 
100,000 from 1988, so that it is expected that by 2000 the 
population figure will stand at 66 million. 
  The statistics touched on the increase in Cairo's population 
density rate, which the census showed to be 15 million people, 
at 23,688 people per square kilometer. Cairo thus occupies third 
place in growth of density, after Calcutta and Manila. It is not 
expected that the population of Egypt will stabilize until it 
reaches a hypothetical volume estimated at nearly 120 million. 
This number is more than double the present population, which is 
an indicator of the growth problems, the spread of poverty, and 
environmental and social deterioration. 
<H5>  Drop in Deaths </H5>
  A study prepared by the Egyptian Consultative Council says 
that the death rate in Egypt began to decrease at the end of the 
1940s. The total death rate was about 30 per thousand residents 
after the end of World War II, then dropped to 15 per thousand 
in the 1970s and 11 per thousand in the 1980s, and should reach 
six per thousand by 2025. 
  At the same time, the marriage rate has dropped. Reports 
indicate a drop in the marriage rate from 11 marriages per 
thousand residents in 1960 to about nine per thousand in 1987, 
with an increase in the rate of unmarried women who are at least 
16 years old to above 20 percent, versus 12 percent in 1960. 
  Egypt ranks twenty-first among countries of the world in 
population growth, according to United Nations estimates, with a 
rate of population growth of nearly 2.4 percent between 1985 and 
1990; it was 2.8 percent between 1976 and 1986. The average 
number of children born to one woman was 4.4 in 1992; it was six 
children in 1965. Despite the fact that these numbers are viewed 
as remarkably positive when compared with what came before, they 
are still high rates that warn of danger. 
  Perhaps the comparison here is significant. In the United 
States, the average number of childen born to one woman is two; 
in 1980 it was 1.8. 
<H5>  Possible Dangers </H5>
  Egypt has had significant experience in birth control, one 
which has drawn many and varied criticisms since it began in the 
1960s. It has encountered warfare, as well, from various 
quarters, and clashed with the customs and traditions of the 
majority of Egyptians, who view the process of birth control as 
forbidden. The agencies entrusted with birth control campaigns 
have endured much in their efforts to change this idea. Despite 
all the criticisms and obstacles, it may be said that positive 
results have begun to appear, as seen in a drop in the recent 
rates of population growth. The question of population growth, 
however, remains a grave one for Egypt and its development 
plans. The government relies primarily on awareness campaigns in 
all available agencies and media: television, radio, and posters 
which portray the benefits that may be reaped by families that 
use birth control, especially palpable economic benefits in the 
family's life, and positive health and beauty results for women 
who use birth control. 
  Many methods for handling the problem have been suggested, 
and are still being proposed. The recommendations of a group of 
housing experts in Egypt will not be the last. Most notable 
among these was a recent study by the Consultative Council. One 
of the most important of these recommendations was was emphasis 
on improving conditions for women and supporting their 
participation in a variety of activities. Society strove for an 
increased rate of women's participation, from about 11 percent 
in 1987, to about 20 percent by the beginning of the next 
century, by preparing the proper environmental conditions so 
that women may play their role. Legislation that could limit 
women's positive initiatives should be amended; men should be 
prepared mentally and psychologically to accept women's role in 
society, with an end, in particular, to the exploitation of 
children and women; provisions of the labor code that limit the 
working age to be no less than 12 should be enforced; and a 
strict minimum should be imposed on the current marriage age. 
  In the health field, the study proposed action to decrease 
the death rate among nursing children by 50 percent from its 
current level, in line with the official estimates, which were 
about 45 per thousand births in 1987, along with the need for 
society to construct an ambitious family planning program, in 
the context of comprehensive development. This program will aim 
at reaching the figure of two children per family within 20 
years. 
  The study dealt in particular detail with population 
distribution. It called for the establishment of new developed 
societies capable of absorbing about 15 percent of the 
population to about 10.5 million people by 2001. 
  The study emphasized the need to review the "New Urban 
Communities" policy, with the aim of investing 100 percent in 
them instead of 10 percent, especially in Egypt's present 
conditions, and providing the suitable elements of attraction to 
draw people to the new societies, while also studying the 
failure of established regions to absorb the population 
projected for them. It emphasized a link between population 
policy and economic and social policy as a means of promoting 
population policy in the development plan, and the need for the 
government to allocate budget funds for the population planning 
program. 
  There are many dangers facing Egypt should growth rates 
continue to rise this steeply. They are a growing strain on its 
resources, and, hence, a negative factor in the qualities and 
capabilities of its people. It also diminishes the standard of 
nutrition and health, education, and housing services in the 
necessities of life. Perhaps the problem in Egypt is even more 
threatening, for although there are nearly 37 projects to halt 
the population explosion, it is still a problem without a 
solution! There may have been a sign of hope, though, when Egypt 
was chosen as the site for the next World Population Conference 
this year.

<F P=106> [Article by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani in Muscat: "One-Third of </F>
Allocations to Defense and Security; Austerity to Prevail in 
Government Outlays"] 
  [Text] The new Omani budget for 1994, announced late the 
night before last, shows a drop of more than 10 percent in the 
volume of government spending. 
  Oman's Deputy Prime Minister for Financial and Economic 
Affairs Mr. Qays Bin-'Abd-al-Mun'im al-Zawawi said that the 
volume of estimated spending for 1994 was nearly 2.033 billion 
Omani rials [RO] (or nearly $5.285 billion) as against almost 
RO2.263 billion (about $5.883 billion) last year. This is a 
decrease in public spending of RO230 million (about $598 
million). 
  Despite this drop, which the Omani official attributed to 
the 
delicate and complex economic conditions resulting from the fall 
in oil prices, the Omani budget's estimated deficit will 
approach RO301 million (or a little closer to $800 million). 
  The estimated budget deficit is 17.4 percent higher than 
total revenues. This, an economic source told AL-HAYAH, "exceeds 
the limit set by the current five-year plan (1991-95), which is 
that the deficit between total revenues and services may not 
exceed 10 percent of total revenues as a maximum." 
  Estimated revenues for 1994 will amount to about RO1.732 
billion (about $4.532 billion), a small increase over 1993's 
revenues, which did not exceed $40 million [sic]. 
  The oil sector occupied its traditional place in the 
structure of Omani income, with 76 percent of revenues, with all 
other non-oil sectors making up the remaining 24 percent. 
<H5>  Defense Outlays </H5>
  It was striking that despite the sizeable drop in general 
expenditures, the defense and national security sector by itself 
commanded nearly a third of spending, with 30 percent of 
allocations of more than $1.5 billion. AL-HAYAH has learned from 
a foreign diplomatic source that, despite economic 
rationalization measures, the Omani Government will not cancel 
arms deals signed last year with several countries, chiefly the 
deal to purchase 36 British Challenger-2 tanks. 
  Oman had to cancel a deal for the purchase of Tornado planes 
after the "mid-1980s crisis," which saw oil prices fall to less 
than $10 per barrel. 
  Also, despite the marked decrease in current and recurring 
expenditure for ministries and civil departments, its share 
amounted to about 37.6 percent of spending. The goverment's 
commitment to the basic provision is guiding these expenditures; 
this is the government salary provision, of which the Omani 
deputy prime minister said when he announced the budget, "it is 
a right possessed by citizens, guaranteed under the law, and 
cannot be violated." 
  The decrease in "investment expenditure" spending was 
extended, with 21 percent of total spending, estimated at $1.1 
billion, or nearly $700 million dollars less than estimated 
investment expenditures in last year's budget. 
  But Qays al-Zawawi believes that the drop in investments 
will 
not severely affect the volume of the program authorized in the 
five-year plan, especially for priority projects; nor would it 
affect the ability of ministries and government offices to start 
projects and enter into new commitments and contracts this year. 
<H5>  Announcement of Austerity Decision </H5>
  Economic sources, however, expressed to AL-HAYAH their fears 
that the drop in government spending, especially in its 
investments, would lead to a slowdown in economic growth, and a 
return to the economic recession, as occurred in the wake of the 
1986 oil crisis, from which it took the Omani economy nearly 
three years to recover. 
  The sources alluded, in this regard, to the "indirect 
decrease" not shown in the budget numbers, but confirmed by the 
first official government confirmation, reflected in the 
austerity decisions the government made in 1993 to deal with the 
public budget deficit. 
  Oman's deputy prime minister said in an exclusive AL-HAYAH 
interview last October that the government had adopted fiscal 
policies that included a cut in senior officials' allocations, a 
drop in compensation for work specialties that some groups in 
the government receive and in payment of 75 percent of the cost 
of employees' annual travel tickets, plus the cancellation of 
government rental of expatriate housing, granting [expatriates] 
instead a "lower rental allowance." 
  Economists tell AL-HAYAH that these measures might save the 
government more than $100 million, but could lead to a recession 
in the country's flourishing contracting and furniture sectors, 
which primarily depended upon the government's rental and 
furnishing of housing for its expatriate employees. 
<H5>  Maintaining Reserves </H5>
  Omani officials pointed out what seems to be a major source 
of concern to economic authorities here: that the scope of the 
deficit could lead to the exhaustion of the state's financial 
reserves, the reserves in the reserve fund, to which 15 percent 
of all oil revenues are transferred annually. 
  The huge tremendous excess in real expenditures in 1991 and 
1992 on one hand and the nearly one-third drop in oil revenues 
in 1993, after the fall in oil prices on the other hand, could 
lead to a greater drawing down of the reserve accounts than was 
estimated in the five year plan for the first three years of the 
current plan (1991-1995). 
  In the current year, despite the fact that the basic 
principle "heeded in the budget was the creation of a balance, 
as much as possible, between resources and spending, and 
narrowing the gap between them. This would reduce dependence on 
drawing down the state's current reserves." More than 70 percent 
of the methods of funding and ending the budget deficit (nearly 
$575 million) will come from making withdrawals from the state's 
reserve accounts." 
  Economic policies and Omani budget indicators are in line 
with the policies and indicators adopted and announced in the 
budgets of the other Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait, who reduced their budgets by nearly 10 percent as a 
result of the retreat in oil prices and revenues.

<F P=106> [Article by Abou Mehdi: "Unfair Competition in Computer </F>
Industry"; first paragraph is REALITES introduction] 
  [Text] The National Commission on Competition and 
Prices, which was established by Law No. 91/64 dated 29 July 
1991 on that subject, has just been handed a complaint by a big 
international computer manufacturer against five Tunisian 
distributors. The charge: unfair competition. 
  This is a first, and the subject is important because it has 
legal, economic, social, and cultural implications. Does a 
commercial company have the right to market hardware and 
software bearing the name of a big manufacturer if the latter 
has not expressly agreed and authorized it to do so? What are 
the duties of a computer service company? Is the approval 
granted by the Ministry of National Economy not sufficient? 
  The debate is of special interest domestically at the 
moment, 
considering that the economy is being privatized, laws 
regulating the distribution trade are being enacted, and 
consumer protection is becoming an increasing reality. But also 
internationally, considering that the GATT agreement has been 
signed and that it guarantees the protection of industrial, 
commercial, and cultural property. And using a manufacturer's 
brand image constitutes encroachment if an agreement has not 
been reached. 
  It is being noted more and more that the days of the 
exclusive privileges provided by "protected markets" are past 
and that there are coming to be fewer and fewer exclusive 
dealers. IBM has about five authorized dealers, Apple has three, 
and so on. But the multinationals impose their own distribution 
policies, "suggested" prices, and marketing methods. How can 
that be reconciled with the requirements of the Tunisian economy 
and the interests of the Tunisian end user? 
  The Tunisian market is a small one, but since it is growing 
rapidly and steadily and because it is liberal and open, it is 
experiencing sharp competition. That competition is reflected in 
a proliferation of computer companies, some of which stress the 
reputation for seriousness and innovation of the big brands that 
have built their enviable reputations by good performance, to be 
sure, but also by expensive advertising. Other companies, on the 
other hand, stress the quality of service and of their customer 
relations. And last, there are those whose prices are 
unbeatable--for example, five companies have distinguished 
themselves in recent months by their "low, low prices" while 
selling a major brand without authorization from the parent 
company. 
  The investigation launched by the parent company and the 
three authorized dealers has revealed the "how" of the 
operation: the five "pirate" companies were paying low prices 
for obsolete hardware with outdated technology from regional 
distributors in Belgium and elsewhere and then selling it in 
Tunisia at a low price and, especially, with no follow-up: no 
after-sales service. Their unfair competition has several 
aspects: use of the Apple-Macintosh logo, in some cases in 
conjunction with the famous apple design, failure to obtain 
proper authorization, failure to comply with the prices approved 
by the manufacturer, and failure to conform to the standard 
profile established by the manufacturer--that is, failure to 
guarantee maintenance and to meet installation standards. Since 
the complaint was filed, the companies in question have 
disappeared only to reappear under new names. 
  With those findings to back it up, Apple MCI, which is based 
in Paris and has the exclusive right to distribute hardware and 
software, decided, in agreement with the three authorized 
dealers and for the purpose of protecting the brand name and 
their interests, to file a complaint charging unfair 
competition. Major manufacturers select their dealers around the 
world very carefully on the basis of objective criteria arising 
from the nature of the sector of activity in question and 
ranging from product design, manufacturing standards, and 
marketing terms to the constraints inherent in the product's 
maintenance. In the case of computers, for example, each 
manufacturer--at least if it is one of the most reputable and 
popular ones--requires that its local dealer provide a site for 
displaying the hardware and a certain number of technicians and 
engineers for handling sales and after-sales service, including 
a repair facility with a minimum inventory of hardware, 
software, and spare parts enabling it to honor the guarantee and 
provide maintenance. To preserve its brand image among its 
customers, the manufacturer is concerned to provide follow-up 
service that will not harm its reputation. 
  "Help: prices are dropping" is a slogan that could very well 
be adopted by computer dealers. The computer industry 
experienced rapid growth in Tunisia and around the world in the 
1980's, but it has spent the past four or five years in a deep 
crisis that has affected not only the manufacturers (IBM has 
laid off 50,000 employees) but also the service firms in Europe. 
The industry is characterized by rapid technological 
progress--and therefore by the rapid obsolescence of computers 
already manufactured and poor sales--and by rapidly falling 
prices, a situation that makes a quick inventory turnover 
necessary precisely because of the progress being made, with the 
result that computer dealers find their profit margins being 
eroded. 
  The consumer's interests are twofold when it comes to 
computers: he wants moderate prices with easy payment terms on 
the one hand and, on the other, good-quality service, meaning 
availability, training for the operating personnel, 
installation, guarantee, maintenance, advice, and so on. For the 
computer industry, lower prices are an advantage for the 
consumer provided that there is no dumping or illicit increase. 
The lack of service to the consumer remains to be proven. The 
offense, on the other hand, resides in the absence of 
after-sales service, which harms the interests of the users. At 
a time when laws exist to protect the consumer and the ODC 
[Consumer Protection Office] is preparing to launch a vast 
awareness campaign in defense of consumer interests and rights, 
a complaint of this kind is extremely important. It is likely to 
set a legal precedent for other industries, for which reason the 
verdict expected on 6 January will attract the attention of all 
businessmen.

<F P=106> [Report by Shafiq al-Asadi:"A Move to Privatize Government </F>
Companies and Institutions. UAE Budget for 1994 Remains at Last 
Year's Levels Despite the Impact of Dropping Oil Prices"] 
  [Text] Abu Dhabi--Ahmad al-Tayir, UAE [United Arab 
Emirates] minister of state for finance and industry affairs, 
announced that the UAE federal budget for the current 1994 
fiscal year will be near last year's budget of about 17.6 
billion dirhams [UD] ($4.8 billion) despite the strong impact on 
the UAE of softening oil prices and declining oil revenues. He 
also disclosed that the government is moving to privatize 
government companies and institutions, beginning with the 
Emirates Petroleum Company, in order to shed the burden of 
administering them and to pave the way for the creation of a 
capital market in Abu Dhabi. 
  Said al-Tayir: "The revenues of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, both of 
which contribute to the budget, have declined to a large extent 
in 1993 because of softer oil prices, which are expected to 
remain low throughout the current year. However, the two 
emirates are committed to not reducing their 1994 budget 
contributions from their 1993 levels. Federal government 
revenues from levies and investment returns will also remain at 
their 1993 levels since no new levies were imposed and because 
returns on investment did not rise due to lower interest rates 
on deposits. 
  "Federal government revenues from levies and returns on 
investment amounted in 1993 to about UD2.751 billion." 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH and a small number of newsmen 
in conjunction with yesterday's meeting in Abu Dhabi of the 
Federal National Assembly (parliament), al-Tayir said that he 
expected the UAE federal budget to be issued soon and that the 
draft budget would be submitted to the council of ministers in 
its final form before the end of this month. 
  He disclosed that the draft budget is currently being 
discussed with the various ministries in order to trim down the 
appropriations they requested. He pointed out that the 
ministries have put in for UD20 billion in requested 
appropriations, which is UD3 billion more than the UD17 billion 
earmarked for the 1994 budget. 
  The minister fielded questions in yesterday's meeting of the 
Federal National Council [FNC] on the reasons for the delay in 
issuing the 1994 budget and in submitting it to the FNC two 
months before year-end as stipulated by the UAE provisional 
constitution. The reason for the delay, al-Tayir asserted, was 
that the various ministries were late in submitting their draft 
budgets to the Ministry of Finance and Industry by the end of 
last September as required. 
  He stated: "Four ministries submitted their draft budgets in 
October. Seven other ministries and government institutions, 
including the FNC, submitted their draft budgets as late as last 
November." He added that most ministries did not calculate their 
requirements in the 1994 budget in accordance with the 
guidelines issued by the Finance Ministry to keep expenditures 
in line with the volume of revenues. 
  That, he explained, caused the Finance Ministry to reexamine 
the draft budget and the projects it entailed in order to keep 
them in tandem with the resources available to the government, 
especially since revenues have been impacted by declining oil 
prices and lower returns on government investments. He 
emphasized that the Finance Ministry does not wish to 
[arbitrarily] impose its estimates of what the various 
ministries require but rather wants the budget to respond to the 
needs of the ministries. 
  He emphasized that the delay in issuing the 1994 budget has 
been covered with the promulgation of a Federal Decree 
authorizing expenditures as of the beginning of January at the 
rate of one twelfth of the 1993 budget. 
  Al-Tayir also emphasized that the 1994 budget would be 
"balanced," in that the budgetary deficit in 1994 will not 
exceed the 1993 gap of UD1.720 billion. 
  He explained that balance would be achieved in 1994 because 
the government has completed a number of one-time major projects 
that no longer require allocations for the current year. He 
pointed out that the government's focus in the past two years 
was on implementing power projects in the northern emirates at a 
cost of UD500 million and on constructing 2,000 low-cost housing 
units for citizens at a cost of 1 billion dirhams. 
  The UAE minister of state for finance and industry affairs 
disclosed that the government is moving to privatize a number of 
government companies and institutions as part of its plan to 
shed the financial and administrative burdens of managing those 
enterprises. 
  He stated that his ministry has proposed privatizing the 
Emirates Petroleum Corporation in two stages, whereby 49 percent 
of ownership would go to citizens in the first stage with public 
ownership ultimately rising to 100 percent. 
  He added that the proposal is currently under study and that 
the relevant decree has been issued by the Supreme Federal 
Council. He emphasized that it was no longer logical for the 
federal government to own companies and institutions when it has 
adopted a market economy. 
  However, sources at the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral 
Resources emphasized to AL-HAYAH that it is premature to offer 
the Petroleum Corporation for public subscription by UAE 
citizens since the Council of Ministers' approval must first be 
obtained due to the Emirates Petroleum Corporation's status as a 
federal enterprise. The Corporation's accounts receivable and 
payable must also be settled [before it is put on the market]. 
  The sources emphasized that the Corporation is in debt to 
the 
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) which supplies it with 
petroleum products for distribution in the various emirates with 
the exception of Abu Dhabi, and that it is owed large amounts by 
the federal government as well as by some local governments and 
factories. The Corporation, founded in 1981 with a capital of 
UD400 million, distributes petroleum products in the UAE. 
  The Federal National Council in yesterday's session also 
directed a query at Yusuf Bin-'Umayr, UAE minister of petroleum 
and president of the Corporation, as to why the prices of 
petroleum products were higher in the Emirates than in other 
neighboring Gulf states. The Council had to postpone discussion 
of the subject because the minister was not present. 
  However, Ahmad Humayyid al-Tayir asserted that the Emirates 
Petroleum Corporation has repaid all its debt and has realized 
substantial profits in recent years; therefore making it 
feasible to offer its shares for subscription. 
  He said that the Corporation's stock would be offered for 
sale at reasonable prices at approximate book value as part of 
the government's strategy to provide citizens with a good 
investment climate. [The government followed the same strategy] 
in previous public offerings of certain organizations and 
companies such as the Emirates Telecommunications Corporation, 
the Emirates Airlines, and the Emirates Hotels Company. 
  He emphasized that the stock offerings would boost the 
number 
of stock companies and lead to the "official" creation of a 
capital market in the UAE.

<F P=106> [Report from Dubai:"UAE to Compile a Blacklist to Combat </F>
Market Fraud"] 
  [Text] Federal and local authorities in the UAE [United 
Arab Emirates] announced plans to combat fraud and counterfeit 
now that they have promulgated several laws to safeguard the 
integrity of markets and commercial transactions. 
  At the conclusion of a seminar on commercial fraud held in 
Dubai, economic circles called for strengthening all laws and 
regulations dealing with commercial fraud and [urged] that they 
be reexamined in light of modern techniques against fraud, and 
especially those utilized for consumer protection. 
  The seminar, attended by representatives of various 
government agencies in the UAE, called for blacklisting 
merchants and producers who resort to fraud in marketing their 
products to the detriment of consumers. They advocated the 
compilation of a blacklist of unworthy products and called for 
comprehensive coordination among all concerned agencies, be they 
federal or local, in order that they may take more effective 
measures to implement the laws to suppress commercial fraud, and 
to institute penalties, or modify them, in a manner that would 
deter all marketplace cheaters. 
  They emphasized the importance of creating channels of 
communication among the various agencies concerned with 
international economic and commercial fields, the exchange of 
information, and studies. These agencies include local, foreign, 
and joint chambers of commerce, banks, and international 
organizations concerned with prosecuting marine fraud. [They 
also called for] opening channels to exchange information on 
agreements with overseas entities, and especially those with 
which the volume of trade is substantial. 
  The Ministry of the Economy, represented by Undersecretary 
'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Mubarak, emphasized at the seminar that 
commercial fraud is a phenomenon alien to society and runs 
counter to religious precepts that call for honesty in dealing. 
He added, however, that all commercial markets in the world 
suffer from the phenomenon of commercial fraud, which impacts 
markets negatively, causes imbalances, creates a degree of 
chaos, and denies the market its bulwark of honesty and 
confidence that deals will be fair. He called for wider 
cooperation between the ministry and chambers of commerce, 
municipalities, and customs agencies in order to blunt that 
phenomenon and protect consumers. 
  The Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in a study 
presented at the seminar, attributed the phenomenon of fraud in 
UAE markets to the expansion of commercial operations in the 
state after the completion of infrastructure projects; to the 
diversity of commercial activity and market openness to various 
foreign products; to some contractor changeovers to trading in 
goods and products; to the lack of awareness among some 
consumers who rush to buy cheap products without considering the 
ramifications of using them; the lack of merchant familiarity 
with, and understanding of the need to abide by laws that 
regulate commercial activities in the state such as the Company 
Law, the Commercial Agency Law, the Law to Suppress Fraud and 
Deception, Criminal Law, and Commercial Transactions Law; and 
the fact that those merchants do not consult with the relevant 
authorities before initiating all commercial transactions. 
  The [Chamber] added that some of the reasons for the 
phenomenon are that certain merchants exaggerate the prices of 
certain brands of goods and products, the flight of consumers to 
cheaper look-alike goods in the belief that they are of equal 
quality, dealing with exporters and companies before verifying 
their validity, and opening letters of credit without adequate 
protective stipulations. 
  The Dubai Chamber of Commerce argued in another treatise 
that 
fraud extends to three areas--goods; documents such as letters 
of credit, invoices, and bills of lading; and fraud involving 
marine shipping and its regulations. It advised importers to 
avoid being victimized by fraud by securing adequate data on 
producers and exporters from chambers and centers of commerce, 
from their bankers, or from delegations that visit the Chamber 
of Commerce. It further advised importers not to rely on foreign 
company sales representatives who visit the country and not to 
be taken in by appearances put on by the exporter or its sales 
representative. The importers were further urged to ascertain 
the status of local agents, if they handle the transactions, and 
their relationships with exporters. 
  The [Dubai Chamber] said that in order to guarantee that the 
goods arrive in sound condition as specified, importers must ask 
shipping company representatives or agents at ports of loading 
or unloading to audit and scrutinize stipulations and determine 
which organizations are to carry out inspections and issue 
certificates of inspection. They were also admonished to deal 
with domestic shipping companies whenever possible or with 
regular shipping lines which, preferably, have agents in the 
region; avoid shipping on chartered vessels; insure the goods 
with domestic insurance companies; and avoid using the fleets of 
countries that allow open registry. 
  The Chamber also called upon importers when opening letters 
of credit to be sure to record the specifications of the goods 
in detail and exactly as they appear on the purchasing contract; 
not accept bills of lading issued by shipping expediters and 
insist on shipping documents issued by the original marine 
shipper on its stationery; and to tap the services offered by 
international agencies involved with fraud. 
  The Municipality of Abu Dhabi said in its study, however, 
that fraud is connected with the large-scale import of 
foodstuffs into the UAE and with the [related] laws and 
laboratories. It recommended, for the containment of that 
phenomenon, encouraging domestic food production and processing 
operations which would make it easier to thoroughly oversee all 
stages of production and therefore ensure that products are 
received by consumers in good condition; cooperation among 
relevant agencies, unification of decision and regulation 
issuing bodies, and the expediting of uniform standards and laws 
governing foodstuffs in the country; raising consumer awareness 
through information media; encouraging public service 
associations to expand their activities by supporting them 
morally and materially; and tightening oversight at gateways 
through which foodstuffs flow into the country. 
  The Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce asserted that the 
government has issued enough laws and regulations to contain the 
phenomenon of commercial fraud but that legislative containment 
is not in itself [capable of accomplishing the task] and must be 
supported by an analogous solidification of effort by all 
entities concerned with information, security, and economic 
affairs, each in its area of specialization.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi--The deficit in the proposed UAE [United 
Arab Emirates] budget for 1994 has decreased in spite of the 
decrease in oil revenues as a result of lower crude oil prices. 
  Ahmad Humayyid al-Tayir, minister of state for finance and 
industry affairs, disclosed that the deficit in the federal 
government's budget will decrease in 1994 by 322.6 million 
dirhams [UD] to UD1.3972 billion ($380 million) compared with 
UD1.720 billion ($468 million) in 1993. Al-Tayir stated that his 
ministry had passed the proposed draft budget along to the 
Council of Ministers that the Council will discuss tomorrow, 
Monday. 
  The 1994 budget is estimated at UD17.6172 billion ($4.8 
billion) compared with UD17.6309 billion ($4.804 billion), or an 
increase of only UD13.7 million ($4 million dollars). [sentence 
as published] 
  However, the important development that al-Tayir disclosed 
is 
the increase in private revenues in the federal government's 
budget for 1994, estimated at UD300 million ($81.7 million) more 
than 1993 revenues of UD15.911 billion ($4.335 billion), or 
UD16.22 billion ($4.420 billion) in the current year. 
  The minister did not disclose the sources for this increase 
in the new budget's resources, but financial sources indicate 
that a potential increase of private revenues for the government 
ministries and institutions is from fees and taxes that they 
receive from services offered to citizens. These are basically 
concentrated in the health, electricity, water and internal 
customs sectors. The electricity minister recently announced an 
increase in the electricity tariff to cover a large part of [the 
ministry's] losses. Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the largest Emirates in 
the state, participate in the federal budget with about 90 
percent of its total resources, according to an agreement 
reached on this matter in 1979. 
  The figures disclosed by the minister of state for finance 
and industry indicate that Abu Dhabi's and Dubai's participation 
in the 1994 budget did not decrease from that of 1993 despite 
the decrease in oil prices.

<F P=106> [Article by Prem Shankar Jha: "Indo-U.S. Relations at </F>
Crossroads"; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] First there was the U.S. successful bid to stop the 
sale by Russia of cryogenic rockets to India. Then came Mr. John 
Malott's speech telling India how it should conduct its domestic 
and regional policy, which was remarkable not for its content 
but its eschewal of a two-year epoch of private diplomacy that 
was the best indicator of warming Indo-U.S. relations, and a 
return to public postures and rhetoric. 
  Then came Ms. Robin Raphel's extraordinary remark that the 
U.S. no longer believed that the Simla agreement provided a 
framework for settling the Kashmir dispute, because very few 
discussions had taken place under the agreement in the past 20 
years. One could say as much about the border between the U.S. 
and Mexico. 
  We will pass over Ms. Raphel's gaffe on the Instrument of 
Accession: A close look at the text of her statement shows that 
she was caught unawares and did not realise the full implication 
in international law of what she was saying. But only days later 
we heard that the Administration intends to withdraw the 
Pressler amendment and replace it with a new comprehensive 
foreign aid law that will apply the Pressler-type restrictions 
to all non-NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty) countries and even 
those signatories (read China) that are seeking to expand their 
nuclear arsenals. India will, of course be included in the first 
category. 
  And, as if our cup of woe was still not full we had to 
listen 
to Mr. Shattuck, Assistant Secretary of State for Human rights, 
who told an Indian newsman that the U.S. disapproved of India's 
Human rights record in Kashmir, and did not believe that a 
nation's right to put down insurgency excused, let alone 
justified, some abrogation of these rights. 
  At any normal time, such sustained, public arm-twisting, 
would have signalled a deliberate decision by the U.S. to 
replace cooperation with pressure as the basis of dealing with 
India. But are these times normal in the U.S.? Are the postures 
it is adopting, not only towards India, but towards China, 
Japan, the EEC, and the United Nations on various issues, 
sustainable? Above all, do the pronouncements coming out of 
Washington reflect carefully worked out foreign policy 
positions, or are they products of `Gung Ho activists in the 
foreign policy establishment shooting from the hip'? 
  The truth lies somewhere in between. And this is presenting 
New Delhi with a foreign policy dilemma that it may understand 
but has, clearly, not been able to resolve. So far New Delhi has 
carefully refrained from any public posturing and its 
communications with the U.S. have been carried on strictly 
within diplomatic channels, (although paraphrased in the press). 
The tone of its communications, except on the issue of the 
Instrument of Accession, has also been markedly moderate. 
  This would have been the correct response, had the U.S. got 
its foreign policy act together. But if its policy is being made 
largely by individuals shooting from the hip, then moderation is 
just the wrong attitude to have adopted, for it has made India 
appear defensive on issues like Human rights, Kashmir and to a 
lesser extent, NPT, and has encouraged activists like Ms. Raphel 
and Mr. Shattuck to think that they can push this country 
around, a belief that Ms. Raphel has not bothered to hide. 
  The truth is that just at this moment the U.S. does not have 
a clearly articulated foreign policy, except in one or two areas 
such as supporting economic reform in Russia, de-nuclearisation 
(again mainly in the former Soviet Union), and freer trade. Two 
of even these have gone grievously wrong with the elections in 
Russia. 
  Outside these core areas, the Clinton administration has 
only 
vaguely formed attitudes pushed by public opinion manipulated by 
the media, whom Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher has 
described somewhat querulously as the aspiring North Star of 
American policy. 
  Thus it does not like Human rights violations; it wants all 
countries to sign the NPT, and put their facilities under 
fullscope safeguards; it wants a cleaner environment, and it 
reserves its right to use bilateral trade pressure to secure 
concessions in selected areas of trade, notably intellectual 
property rights. It wants global stability, brokered by itself 
and the NATO where it feels it more directly threatened, and 
according to the U.S. permanent Representative to the U.N., Ms. 
Madeleine Albright, by the U.N., which it considers a junior 
partner, where it does not. 
  India could not fail to be at the receiving end of nearly 
all 
these concerns, despite the fact that it shares most of them, 
because any attempt to force one country's views and `solutions' 
on another, ends by denying the latter a large part of its 
sovereignty. In effect the message being sent to India is `join 
us and we will look after you; resist us and we will press down 
on and eventually hurt you.' 
  The choice might have been a real one if these concerns had 
reflected deeply felt convictions and not just vague attitudes. 
But this is far from being the case. On Human rights no less an 
organisation than the American Human Rights Watch has condemned 
the Clinton administration of adopting double standards, 
pressing for their observance where no other national interest 
is involved, and giving them the go by when there is. It has 
specifically indicted Mr. Clinton's record in this respect 
towards Israel as being worse than Mr. George Bush's. 
  The U.S. has adopted double standards in a more fundamental 
way: In Somalia its helicopter gunships blew away somewhere 
between 150 and 300 Somali civilians in a retaliatory attack 
designed to kill Aideed, for the killing of a single U.S. 
soldier by one of his gunmen. The U.S. spokesman said that in 
such an operation there were no innocent bystanders. And when 
Mr. Keith Richburg of the Washington Post 
investigated the casual killing of a Malaysian CARE worker by a 
U.N. patrol while he was out buying his lunch, the U.N. command 
said `Guerillas fire from crowds. They use women and children as 
human shields. There are bound to be civilian casualties when 
U.N. troops fire back in self-defence.' Does that sound familiar 
Mr. Shattuck? 
  On the role of the U.N. as a world policeman, realism, burst 
the media's pipe-dream of a new world order when none other than 
President Clinton decided to pull U.S. troops out of Somalia 
after the killing of 18 soldiers, and to start political talks 
with Aideed and the other warlords. Within the U.N. Secretariat, 
disillusionment with the forward policies that have been thrust 
on the organisation by the rich nations in the heady afterglow 
of the Gulf War is complete. There is a total consensus that the 
U.N. must not undertake any more military actions under the 
mandatory chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, and that even 
supervisory or humanitarian actions under chapter 6, will not be 
possible if national contingent commanders do not place 
themselves unreservedly under the U.N. commandant. Ms. Madeleine 
Albright's September dream of U.S.-U.N. partnership is already 
light years out of date. 
  The administration's lack of commitment reflects an even 
more 
profound lack of interest in the American public. In civilised 
drawing rooms from Washington to Cambridge, no one is talking 
about foreign policy. What true American liberals are appalled 
about is the crime bill that has been rushed through Congress. 
Children over 13 will now be treated as adults and can be 
sentenced to death mandatorily on as many as 19 (or is it 29) 
counts. The passage of this bill has focussed attention as 
nothing else could have on the internal social problems of the 
country -- the growing racial divide, the violence, crime and 
decay in the inner cities; the growing inequalities in health 
care, the fact that a large part of the population has grown 
poorer in the Eighties and Nineties; the rise in highly educated 
white collar unemployment, and the deterioration in the status 
of blue collar workers all over the country. 
  These are Mr. Clinton's real worries, and he has unabashedly 
little time to spare for a foreign policy that is no longer 
rooted in an acute sense of national insecurity. But the foreign 
policy establishment is a leftover of the old days when this was 
where the best and the brightest went. Activism is therefore 
part of its very blood. But it is now activism without a guiding 
beacon, or a steady restraining hand. So every one is shooting 
from the hip. New Delhi may choose not to shoot back but it must 
show that it has little respect for Washington's cowboys. And, 
it must rebuild its relations with China.

<F P=106> [Article: "India Has More To Benefit From GATT Treaty"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 16. The following is the text of the 
statement made by the Union Minister of Commerce, Mr. Pranab 
Mukherjee, in Parliament today. 
  The Uruguay Round talks have been concluded last night and 
an 
overall agreement covering trade in goods, trade in services, 
trade related intellectual property rights, trade related 
investment measures, trade in textiles, and trade in 
agricultural commodities has been crystalised for adoption and 
ratification by the Governments of the 117 countries which have 
been involved in the negotiations. As the Government has 
clarified on more than one occasion, in both Houses of 
Parliament, India has been a consistent supporter of an orderly 
multilateral trading system. Such a system confers the benefits 
of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment to all members, benefits 
of reduced tariffs and increased market access and the 
protection of a Multilateral Dispute Settlement Mechanism. 
  It is expected that the successful conclusion of the Uruguay 
Round will result in significant expansion in world trade as a 
result of which India should be able to increase its own exports 
by $1.5 billions to $2 billions annually in addition to the 
normal growth. The reduction in export subsidies on agriculture 
by developed countries will make Indian agricultural exports 
more competitive in world markets. It may be mentioned that 
despite their strong reservations regarding permitting the 
import of rice, even countries like Japan and South Korea have 
agreed to allow market access for rice to other exporting 
countries. As I had informed the House in the course of my reply 
to the discussion last week, taking the product and non-product 
agricultural subsidies together, India's aggregate subsidy works 
out to a substantial negative figure thereby providing a very 
large scope for further augmentation of agricultural subsidies 
if the Government were to choose to raise the subsidies from the 
current levels. The proposed agreement provides for a subsidy 
level of 10 per cent of the value of the agricultural produce 
which is far higher than the current negative level of subsidy. 
The agreement has also clarified that consumer subsidies under 
the Public Distribution System for the rural and urban poor are 
outside the scope of disciplines and our PDS system can thus be 
continued without any difficulty. 
  While we would give reasonable protection to plant breeders 
new develop how plant varieties under the Agreement, the rights 
of farmers and researchers will also be fully protected. As I 
have already clarified in the House, in the "sui generis" 
legislation which is being drafted for this purpose, the 
interests of our farmers will be safeguarded. 
  As stated by me earlier in the House, the agreement does not 
place any explicit obligation to patent naturally occurring 
genes and gene sequences. I am already on record that Government 
do not intend to permit patenting of naturally occurring genes 
and gene sequences in the patents legislation which would have 
to be instituted in 10 years after coming into force of the 
proposed agreement. 
  While India had initially not been in favour of inclusion of 
Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights in the scope of the 
Uruguay Round, it had ultimately to go along with the rest of 
the world community. A country like ours, which does not 
presently recognise product patents in the field of drugs, food 
products and chemicals, has been allowed a transition period of 
10 years for establishing a product patent regime for such 
items. If we were to opt out of the new agreement, the 
possibility of our major trading partners insisting upon a much 
earlier introduction of product patents on the threat of 
imposition of restrictions on the export of our goods into their 
markets cannot be ruled out. Members may be aware that under 
such pressure some developing countries very recently decided to 
introduce an entirely new patent regime in accordance with the 
wishes of some developed countries to safeguard their market 
access to those countries. I had also clarified in the House 
that the fears regarding an inordinate rise in the price of 
patented drugs after the introduction of product patents are not 
quite justified because under the agreement, the government 
would be able to undertake compulsory licensing for 
non-commercial public use as well as to prevent situations of 
either inadequate availability or exorbitant pricing. Besides, 
the Government retains the right to institute price control on 
drugs. 
  As regards the agreement on Trade Related Investment 
Measures, the position is that the Government retains its 
sovereign right to decide what type of foreign investment it 
wishes to allow into the country. Conditions can also be imposed 
regarding fulfilment of export obligations to balance the outgo 
and inflow of foreign exchange by such ventures. The only 
requirement under the agreement is that once a unit has been 
allowed to come into the country it will be treated at par with 
other indigenous units in terms of regulations and policies. 
  As regards textiles, though we are unhappy with the 
extension 
of the quota regime by importing countries for another 10 years 
and unsatisfactory annual rate of enhancement of the import 
quotas, it has to be recognised that the commitment to finally 
phase out the quota regime after 10 years is a positive gain for 
textile exporting countries, including India. In the final hours 
of the Round, an attempt was made by some industrialised 
countries to alter the textile agreement of the draft final Act 
to our disadvantage. The argument given was that India, while 
benefiting from the open trading system and in spite of being 
competitive in textiles, had kept its market closed. Forceful 
suggestions were made that we should open our market also on a 
reciprocal basis. We took the position that the multi-fibre 
agreement was a derogation from GATT (General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade), and the integration of the Textiles trade 
into GATT was not something that required any contribution from 
us. We sustained our position in spite of concerted demands on 
us. We also successfully resisted concerted moves to extend the 
period of integration of textile trade from 10 to 15 years by 
taking a strong position on the issue. 
  The Standing Committee attached to the Commerce Ministry, 
which had gone into the implications of the Dunkel Draft in 
great detail, has recommended in its report, that while all 
efforts should be made to safeguard India's interests in key 
sectors of agriculture, textiles, services and Intellectual 
Property Rights, at the end of the day, India should remain a 
part of a multilateral trading system rather than opting out the 
same and getting totally isolated from the rest of the world. 
  On the whole it is our considered judgment that India has 
more to benefit from the expansion of world trade through the 
Uruguay Round Agreement rather than pursuing any alternative 
course of action.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "U.S. Policy Review Sees No </F>
Change"; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 29. Contrary to the belief here, the 
U.S. Administration maintains that its policy on South Asia 
remained consistent in 1993 despite the change in presidency. 
  According to an official year-end review of the U.S. 
relations with the Indian sub-continent (details of which are 
available here), most of the themes sounded by the Clinton 
Administration on "South Asia--nuclear non-proliferation, 
democracy-building, human rights, free trade and economic 
reform--echo the policies set in place by his predecessor, 
George Bush." That is because, it says, these broad goals best 
define American interests in the post-cold war world and are 
particularly relevant to South Asia. 
  Indo-Pak. tensions: The historic tensions between 
the region's two strongest countries, India and Pakistan, the 
review notes, have become far more troubling in recent years, 
now that both are widely considered to possess a nuclear weapons 
capability. Added to the volatile mix is the ongoing instability 
in Afghanistan, where security risks have prevented the United 
States from reopening its embassy. The breakup of the former 
Soviet Union evoked a wholesale re-evaluation in Washington of 
U.S. relations with the former eastern bloc, but its effect on 
U.S. South Asia policy has been subtle. In the Presidency of Mr. 
Bill Clinton, the changes, it is pointed out, have come in the 
degree of emphasis placed on particular issues. 
  It cites the views expressed by the U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State, Ms. Robin Raphel, and other officials from time to 
time that the State of Jammu and Kashmir is a "disputed" 
territory. Questioning the suggestions in sections of South 
Asian media, "for largely parochial reasons" that the Clinton 
Administration had modified the South Asia policy, it quotes the 
following remarks of the State Department spokesman in November: 
"As we have noted consistently since 1947, the U.S. believes the 
entire geographic area of the former princely State of Jammu and 
Kashmir is disputed territory. The U.S. believes the best way to 
resolve the dispute over Kashmir is through direct discussions 
between the Governments of India and Pakistan as envisioned in 
the (1972) Shimla agreement, taking into account the wishes of 
the Kashmiri people." 
  Delhi sees new elements: As seen in New Delhi, the 
Clinton Administration introduced new elements in its South Asia 
policy, with recurring references to the "wishes of the Kashmiri 
people" and its willingness to help resolve (in other words, 
"mediate") the problem if desired by the two sides. 
  The debate over the possible scrapping of the Pressler 
Amendment is summed up thus: "Another U.S. policy that is likely 
to provoke regional opposition but remain unchanged is the 
suspension of U.S. aid to Pakistan. The 1985 Pressler Amendment 
to U.S. law requires that aid to Pakistan be withheld unless the 
U.S. President can certify that Islamabad does not possess 
nuclear weapons capability. The Bush administration revoked 
Pakistan's certification in 1990, and the aid cutoff has 
remained in effect ever since. Although the Clinton White House 
indicated in 1993 an interest in removing `country-specific' 
language from the foreign aid law to allow presidential 
discretion in such decisions, the principle that underlines the 
Pressler Amendment continues to be upheld. As a result, the aid 
cutoff can be expected to continue until Pakistan's nuclear 
programme ceases to be of international concern." 
  Priority for non-proliferation: Citing Mr. 
Clinton's address to the U.N. General Assembly that he had "made 
non-proliferation, one of our nation's highest priorities," the 
review describes how that official message was brought home 
during an October State Department briefing, with the statement 
that the U.S. was "particularly concerned" about the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in regions such as 
South Asia. "We have ongoing, senior-level discussions on this 
issue with the Governments of Pakistan and India and we will 
continue to urge both Governments to undertake direct, 
high-level discussions on this and other issues dividing them, 
including Kashmir." 
  Among the "good news" were the decision by India and 
Pakistan 
to resume official talks and the elections in the two countries, 
according to the official document. 
  The Pakistani elections, according to the review, were 
widely 
hailed as having been the freest and fairest in its history with 
some observers suggesting that the process may have given birth 
to a genuine two-party system. 
  The significance of the Assembly elections in India was 
spelt 
out thus: "Hindu-Muslim tensions heated up with the December 
1992 destruction by Hindu nationalists of the historic mosque of 
Ayodhya, and riots which left hundreds dead. Tensions were 
further heightened by a bomb attack in downtown Bombay and the 
siege by Indian security forces of the sacred Hazratbal mosque 
in Kashmir, where Muslim militants had barricaded themselves. 
Those and other events led many to predict that Indian politics 
would become increasingly fractious and polarised by religious 
extremism. Instead, voters in India's recent elections largely 
rejected the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) Hindu nationalist 
party. The election results were widely interpreted as a 
reaffirmation of India's status as a modern, secular State." 
  "In a positive move that was lauded by the U.S. and 
international organisations, the Indian Government agreed this 
year to allow human rights observers to enter Kashmir and 
investigate reports of abuses committed by New Delhi's security 
forces," the review said.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "Yeltsin Renews Invitation to Rao"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 29. The Russian President, Mr. Boris 
Yeltsin, has repeated his invitation to the Prime Minister, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao, to visit Moscow -- and proceeding from that, 
officials of the two Governments are working on plans for a trip 
in May. This will be the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister 
to Moscow, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The 
last trip at that level was by Mr. V.P. Singh in 1990 when 
Russia was not a separate republic. 
  Another symbolic gesture, contemplated now, envisages 
telephonic talk between the two leaders on the newly-established 
direct line between Delhi and Moscow. 
  A spokesman of the Russian Embassy confirmed that Mr. 
Yeltsin 
had written recently to Mr. Rao, but said he would not be able 
to give the contents or the gist of this confidential 
communication. Russia, he however, stressed, regarded Kashmir an 
internal problem of India and supported its territorial 
integrity. In this context, he said there was no change in the 
Russian Government's stand. 
  According to details of Mr. Yeltsin's letter available from 
diplomatic sources, Kashmir and Indo-Pakistan relations figured 
in it along with several other issues of bilateral interest. In 
Mr. Yeltsin's opinion, it was impossible to achieve true 
security in South Asia, without normalising relations between 
India and Pakistan. Russia, he said, welcomed the resumption of 
dialogue between these two countries and considered it of utmost 
importance. 
  It was his hope, Mr. Yeltsin said, that the two countries 
would demonstrate goodwill and constructive and well-considered 
approach in regard to their current problems, including Kashmir. 
Stressing the importance Russia attached to India's territorial 
integrity, Mr. Yeltsin said that it was a "must" not only for 
the region, but for the world as a whole. That was Russia's 
principled position and it, according to Mr. Yeltsin, had been 
conveyed to Pakistan. 
  The letter, it appears, noted with satisfaction Pakistan's 
decision to give up its plan for moving a resolution in the U.N. 
on human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. Russia, he 
said, regarded it a step in the right direction. Mr. Yeltsin 
approvingly noted the additional steps taken by the Government 
of India to ensure prevention of such violations. This, perhaps, 
was a reference to the establishment of the Human Rights 
Commission, intended to probe allegations of excesses by the 
security forces and other law enforcement agencies, and the 
decision to allow international human rights organisations to 
visit Kashmir. Mr. Yeltsin also expressed satisfaction over the 
handling of the Hazratbal crisis. 
  The letter referred to the problem of trans-border terrorism 
-- in the context of the activities involving Afghanistan and 
Tajikstan. India which is a victim of this phenomenon and has 
been drawing attention of the international community to 
Pakistan's role in instigating terrorist violence in the Kashmir 
Valley, would certainly have derived comfort from Russia's 
views, though expressed in a different context.

<F P=106> [Article: "Kashmiri Pandits' Conference: Centre Urged To End </F>
Callousness"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec 27 (PTI). The first ever world 
Kashmiri Pandits' conference got under way here with prominent 
speakers, including the former Jammu and Kashmir governor, 
asking the government to give up its "callous" attitude and wake 
up to Pakistan's designs of carrying out a cultural and ethnic 
genocide in the valley. 
  The two-day conference has been organised to highlight the 
"criminal silence" of the government and national and 
international human rights organisation to "systematic ethnic 
cleansing" being carried out in the Kashmir valley. 
  The conference being attended by over 10,000 delegates from 
all over the world was inaugurated by His Holiness Rimpoche, 
chairman of the assembly of Tibetan People's Deputies, who said 
it was the bounden duty of the new generation of Kashmiri 
Pandits to save the rich Kashmiri culture which was facing 
threat by foreign-sponsored terrorism. 
  Mr Rimpoche stressed on rich cultural ties between Tibet and 
Kashmir for generations and wanted these to be revived and 
rekindled. He said the emphasis now was on government to bring 
an end to violence in Kashmir and get the Pakistan occupied part 
of the Jammu and Kashmir vacated of illegal occupation. 
  Mr Rimpoche on the occasion presented the Sharada awards to 
seven people, including cinestar, Mr Anupam Kher, former 
governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Jagmohan. The other awardees 
were late Girilal Jain, the late Dina Nath Nadim, an eminent 
Kashmiri writer and poet, Dr Ved Kumari Ghai was has translated 
ancient Kashmir scriptures Nilmat Purana, Pandit Bhajan Spopori, 
the santoor maestero and `Kashur Samachar,' the local Kashmiri 
paper. 
  Mr Girilal Jain award was received by his widow, Mrs 
Sudarshan Jain and Mr Dina Nath Nadim award by his son Ahimsa 
Kaul. 
  Speaking after receiving the award, Mr Jagmohan expressed 
his 
sadness at what he called "continued neglect and callous and 
cruel attitude of the government" to the plight of Kashmiri 
Pandit migrants. 
  Mr Jagmohan who was given a standing ovation from the packed 
auditorium said Pakistan was carrying out a cultural and ethnic 
genocide in Kashmir. 
  He said organisation like Panun Kashmir was fighting a 
subversion which if not checked now could engulf the shole 
country. 
  Mr Jagmohan patted the Kashmiri Pandit community for "not 
singing songs of despair" and said their energetic efforts would 
overcome all the obstacles as they were fighting for truth and a 
cause which as right. 
  He described as noble and warm gesture the presentation of 
the award to him and said it would for him be a symbol of great 
association with a great community of the country. 
  Most of the opening day's deliberations were devoted to 
keeping the Kashmiri culture and art alive. On the occasion, an 
exhibition of Kashmir Art in exile was also held. 
  The contributing artists were the famous Kashmiri painter, 
the late Bansi Parimoo, whose paintings on recent happenings in 
Kashmir was on display. 
  Other contributors include eminent artists, Kuldeep Khosa, 
Manohar Kaul, Rajinder Tickoo, a sculptor of repute, Bhushan 
Kaul, Veer Munshi, Krishen Kaw, M.K. Bhat, Gokul Dembi, Ms Laxmi 
Khosa, Anjali Kaul, Hema Kaul and Kishore Kaul. 
  In the evening famous singers and artists from Kashmir led 
by 
santoor maestro, Bhajan Sporoi, gave a recital of Kashmiri folk 
and contemporary music.

<F P=106> [Article: "PCC, DCC Presidents Barred From Polls"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 22: The Congress president and Prime 
Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, on Wednesday announced that 
presidents of Pradesh and District Congress Committee [PCC and 
DCC] would henceforth be not allowed to contest the Assembly 
elections. 
  The party rules in this regard would soon be amended, Mr Rao 
said, while addressing a meeting of the Congress Parliamentary 
Party (CPP) here on Wednesday morning. 
  The Congress president said: "If they (PCC and DCC chiefs) 
(Pradesh Congress Committee, District Congress Committee) want 
to contest the Assembly elections, they should resign the party 
post first." 
  Coming down heavily on PCC and DCC presidents, Mr Rao said, 
amid the thumping of desks by members that party posts should 
not be treated as `stepping stones.' "It was a wrong practice on 
the part of the PCC and DCC chiefs to contest the elections and 
thereby confine themselves to their own constituency. They 
should rather volunteer not to contest and work for all party 
candidates," he added. 
  Mr Rao said if the PCC and DCC chiefs worked for all the 
candidates contesting the elections they themselves could become 
MLCs (Member of Legislative Council) or fight the next elections. 
  The Congress president concentrated his attention mainly on 
the States going to polls next year, like Andhra Pradesh and 
Karnataka, and stressed the full involvement of the party MPs 
(Member of Parliament) in explaining the policies and programmes 
of the government. 
  He said the pattern adopted in the last month's Assembly 
elections in the northern States, sending district and 
State-level observers three to four months before the elections 
to work for the party, would be followed in the States going to 
polls in the next year. 
  With regard to Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and other States, 
where elections are due next year, State-wise in-depth study 
would be undertaken and corrective actions would be taken. He 
had expected that the PCCs and DCCs would take up this 
responsibility, but from the feedback he had this has not 
happened so far. 
  Mr Narasimha Rao said from now on the MPs of these States 
should work out a methodology to face the challenges in the 
coming elections. In the next few days, he would like to meet as 
many party MPs as possible from these States for a general 
assessment of the political situation in their respective States 
and to evolve a strategy to be adopted by the party. 
  Stating that the situation in the southern States going to 
polls was different from northern States, the Congress president 
analysed the problems the party has to face in Andhra Pradesh 
and Karnataka, such as internal squabbles and the phenomenon of 
regional parties. The party's approach has to be totally 
different if the Congress has to win against the regional 
parties. Another factor which the party has to take note of is 
the attempts of the Bahujan Samaj Party [BSP], headed by Mr 
Kanshi Ram, to cut into the Dalit vote bank of Congress. The BSP 
stands no chance of coming to power, but it might be able to cut 
into the votes of the Congress. 
  He said in the normal course it was not easy to defeat the 
Congress, which has a vote bank of 40 to 47 per cent of the 
electorate. But, in a situation, where other parties forge a 
united front with the sole objective of defeating the Congress 
or where other parties raise religious and caste factors, the 
party has an uphill task of politically facing the challenges. 
  To face such a challenge, the Congressmen and party MPs 
should explain to the people the adverse impact that would have 
if the Congress is defeated and the Opposition combine is 
elected. The people should be educated on the fact that the 
combine would disintegrate and there would be anarchy in the 
country and hence it is not in their own interest and the 
country's interest to elect such Opposition-combine. The people 
should be educated how development would be relegated to the 
back seat if the Congress was not returned to power. 
  Briefing reporters on the meeting, the Congress spokesman, 
Mr 
V.N. Gadgil, said the Prime Minister was the only speaker at the 
meeting. The report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) 
on the securities scam did not figure at the meeting.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "DMK Splits"] </F>
  [Text] Tiruchirapalli, Dec 26 (UNI): The Opposition Dravida 
Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu formally split on Sunday, 
with the parallel "general council" meeting of the party 
convened here by expelled rebel leader V. Gopalsamy, MP (Member 
of Parliament), and his supporters declaring that theirs was the 
"real DMK." 
  Today's split, the third the party's 44-year-long existence, 
came at the end of a three-month-long acute leadership struggle 
and in the wake of a sensational disclosure of an alleged 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) plot to assassinate 
party president M. Karunanidhi and promote the interests of Mr 
Gopalsamy. 
  The 48-year-old firebrand politician, Mr Gopalsamy, who had 
vowed to "liberate" the DMK from the clutches of Mr 
Karunanidhi's "dynastic rule," announced that today's meeting 
"relieved" Mr Karunanidhi and general secretary K. Anbazhagan, 
among others, from their posts. 
  Announcing far-reaching changes in his new party, Mr 
Gopalsamy, who was elected unanimously as the general secretary, 
said the post of party president, created in 1969, stood 
abolished, and in its place, the post of chairman of Presidium, 
was being revived. 
  Staking his claim to the "red and black" flag of the DMK, Mr 
Gopalsamy said the party would follow the policies of 
founder-leader C.N. Annadurai. 
  He also announced the revival of the party's Parliamentary 
Board with six members and removal of leaders nominated to 
various wings of the party by Mr Anbazhagan. 
  Meanwhile, in what is considered as a trial of strength, Mr 
Karunanidhi has convened the general council of the DMK at 
Thanjavur on December 29 and proposes to make video recording of 
the proceedings to nail the propaganda by Mr Gopalsamy's 
supporters that the Thanjavur meet would be a fake. 
  Asked whether he would release the list of the members, who 
attended the "general council" meeting, district wide, Mr 
Gopalsamy replied that he did not want to release the list now 
for "strategic" reasons. He, would do so at the right time. 
  He said photographs had been taken and video recording of 
the 
proceedings had been made to provide proof, if needed. 
  To a question whether he would capture Arivaalayam, the 
headquarters of the DMK led by Mr Karunanidhi, at Madras, Mr 
Gopalsamy said he had no faith in violence and would not 
"capture" the properties of DMK.

<F P=106> [Article: "Government Will Take Action on JPC Report: PM"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 30. The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao, today assured the country that the Government 
would take action "where called for" in the light of the 
recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on 
the securities scam, as earlier promised in the Lok Sabha by "my 
Finance Minister," Dr. Manmohan Singh, but not before the main 
Opposition parties had staged a walkout in both Houses of 
Parliament. 
  The action would be based on a detailed examination of the 
report, Mr. Rao said speaking briefly in the Lok Sabha after Dr. 
Singh ended a 45-minute thought-provoking reply to the two-day 
special debate on the JPC report, in which he said the 
Government would come to Parliament with a blueprint of action 
within three months. The Opposition followed a similar pattern 
in the Rayja Sabha. 
  It was a pity that the entire Opposition, barring the AIADMK 
(All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and the Muslim 
League, had walked out in protest against the Government's 
decision to let the Finance Minister, rather than the Prime 
Minister, reply to the debate. 
  It was sad to see Dr. Singh reply to a half-empty chamber. 
In 
a sense the debate had centred on him, and he had been praised 
by all Opposition for owning moral responsibility and offering 
his resignation. 
  While the discussion was running perfectly smoothly, not 
long 
before the reply was due, the Opposition leaders -- including 
Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Mr. Sharad Yadav, Mr. Somnath 
Chatterjee, Mr. Indrajit Gupta and Mr. Chandra Shekhar -- set up 
a clamour that they would accept a reply to the debate only from 
the Prime Minister. 
  They urged the Speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil, and the 
Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, not to be 
"bound down by rules," according to which, any Minister can 
answer for the whole Government in a special discussion under 
rule 193, and in this case, as Mr. Patil noted, the "nodal" 
Ministry was, indeed, Finance. 
  The Opposition argued that the special status of the 
occasion 
demanded that the Prime Minister himself reply, as a large 
number of Government Ministries and departments were scrutinised 
by the JPC (Joint Parliamentary Committee). Moreover, they said 
it would not be proper for a Minister who was believed to have 
tendered his resignation, to reply to the debate. 
  The Finance Minister noted at the beginning of his reply 
that 
he was speaking in his capacity as the Finance Minister. He said 
the JPC had made a deep study of the problem, and that he 
accepted full "constitutional responsibility" for the scam, even 
though the process had commenced some five years before he 
became the Finance Minister. He also said he was answerable to 
Parliament, the Prime Minister, and the people and would accept 
any "punishment" Parliament desired to hand down to him. 
  However, the Finance Minister observed that he differed with 
the appreciation of the JPC that the Finance Ministry or he 
himself had failed to anticipate the sensational scam, had 
lacked in "purposeful response" once it broke, failed to manage 
it adequately, or apply correctives with despatch and punish the 
guilty. 
  Citing detail after detail, he said he had begun the 
clean-up 
and the investigation through various instructions and setting 
up of high-powered bodies within a month of becoming the Finance 
Minister, though he had to immediately plunge into the 
budget-making exercise, and devise strategies "with the 
blessings of the Prime Minister" to manage the country's very 
precarious finances, as India was being virtually written off 
worldwide as a country gone bankrupt. 
  The ruling party in the Rayja Sabha launched a direct attack 
on the JPC report in the face of vociferous demand from the 
Opposition for the resignation of all the Ministers against whom 
adverse comments have been made in the Committee report. 
  Barring the melodrama towards the end that centred around 
the 
remarks made by Mr. Ram Jethmalani (JD) (Janata Dal) on the CBI 
(Central Bureau of Investigation) and the Prime Minister which 
led to adjournment of the House and walkout by the Opposition 
demanding reply from the Prime Minister, proceedings in the 
Upper House were lack-lustre. The Left members who stayed in the 
House kept shouting, even as Dr. Singh rounded-off the debate in 
a brief speech which could not be heard in the din. 
  What began as a veiled criticism of the contents of the 
report by the Power Minister, Mr. N.K.P. Salve, during the day 
became a full-fledged attack by his party colleague, Mr. R.K. 
Dhawan, who spoke towards the far-end and accused the committee 
of having shown "total lack of respect for rules and 
regulations." 
  The Opposition members on their part while reiterating their 
demand for the head of all the Ministers indicted by the 
committee, took serious exception to the description of the JPC 
report by the Congress(I) members and Ministers. Mr. Salve was 
repeatedly interrupted by the Opposition, when he sought to 
convey his "distress and dislike" over the debate and maintained 
that the committee report was not entirely "impartial." 
  The Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Sikandar Bakht, and Mr. S. 
Jaipal Reddy (JD) were on their legs immediately after Mr. Salve 
took the position that the debate was devoid of merit and 
objectivity and wanted to know if he was speaking in his 
capacity as a member or a Minister. If it was the later what he 
said amounted to virtual denigration of the committee report. 
  Undeterred by the interruptions, Mr. Salve dealt at length 
on 
what he termed as informities in the contents of the committee 
report and the constitutional position on issues like collective 
responsibility and sustainability of the comments in the report 
against the Finance Minister and his Ministry, Mr. N. Giri 
Prasad (CPI) (Communist Party of India) contended that argument 
of systemic failure cannot hold water, as no system worked 
without individuals who were responsible for its functioning. 
  In his intervention, the Commerce Minister, Mr. Pranab 
Mukherjee, asserted that there was no constitutional obligation 
for Ministers on the basis of reports of parliamentary 
committees and sought to make a distinction between the outcome 
of a commission of inquiry and the parliamentary committee. He 
argued that Mr. K.D. Malaviya and Mr. T.T. Krishnamachary had 
resigned following indictment by a commission of inquiry by a 
sitting Supreme Court judge.

<F P=106> [Article: "I Am Not Guilty: Manmohan"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 30. The Union Finance Minister, Dr. 
Manmohan Singh, today declined to plead guilty to the points 
raised by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probing the 
securities scandal with regard to his personal role as the 
Finance Minister or that of the Ministry of Finance. 
  In his reply to the special debate in the Lok Sabha, Dr. 
Singh made it clear that he was addressing the House in his 
capacity as the Finance Minister and went ahead to accept full 
constitutional responsibility for the actions and the area of 
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. Stating that he would 
not take shelter behind Constitutional niceties, he listed out 
the five points on which the JPC has criticised the Finance 
Minister or the Ministry in general -- failure to anticipate the 
problem; failure to respond purposefully to the problem; failure 
to manage the consequence of the scam; failure to apply 
immediate corrective measures and failure to punish the guilty. 
  Prompt steps taken: Confessing that it was a 
"matter of deep personal regret that the irregularities in the 
misuse of funds got accentuated in the first nine months" of his 
Ministership, Dr. Singh responded to the first point that as 
early as July 24, 1991 he had referred to the grave weakness in 
the banking and financial system of the country during the 
course of his first Budget presentation. Within a month of that, 
the Narasimham Committee had been set up to suggest the reforms 
in the financial sector, "I was aware of the weakness in our 
system. But what I was not aware of was that some people sitting 
in the State Bank in Bombay were robbing the bank," he added. 
  The Minister also pointed out that he had also said the 
Indian capital market was unregulated and that the four people 
comprising the Stock Exchange division in the Finance Ministry 
were neither adequate not competent to oversee the market. 
Consequently, he had emphasised on granting statutory powers to 
the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) which had been 
set up about three years ago but had not been granted statutory 
powers. By early 1992, the SEBI had been granted statutory 
powers and its authority had the full backing of the Ministry, 
he added. 
  Cell to check frauds mooted: Dr. Singh also 
disclosed that in August 1991 he had sent a note to the then 
Minister for Banking, pointing out that the system was prone to 
frauds and that he felt it necessary that the Reserve Bank 
should set up a cell to prevent frauds. 
  Stressing further his point that he was conscious of some 
problem in the stock markets, the Minister said he had asked the 
Reserve Bank to stop bank finances for investment in shares in 
October 1991 and this had an effect on the market which remained 
more or less stable till December. By January 1992, however, the 
market had started rising again and RBI (Reserve Bank of India) 
was asked to strictly enforce the ban on bank finances for 
speculative purposes. 
  At that point, the Finance Minister asked the then Finance 
Secretary to find out where the brokers were getting funds for 
their activities and for this purpose the accounts of leading 
brokers were scrutinised and raids conducted on Mr. Harshad 
Mehta's premises on February 28, 1992. "Unfortunately, the 
information procured was on floppy disks and it took time to 
decipher," he added. 
  In early March, the RBI asked financial institution chiefs 
to 
see the accounts of the leading brokers and through that it was 
first found out that there was some leakage from the SBI and 
eventually the scam came to the notice. 
  On the JPC point that in his meeting with Stock Exchange 
authorities in early 1992 the Finance Minister had failed to 
mention the fluctuations in the market, Dr. Singh said it would 
have been extremely foolish on the part of the Finance Minister 
to indicate what should be the share prices. "I told them that 
the behaviour of the stock markets could bring the whole process 
of liberalisation to disrepute and that the Government would 
relent on the powers of the SEBI," the Minister said and pointed 
out that any comment by him about share prices could have led to 
brokers making "millions on the exchange." 
  Crisis management steps: Dr. Singh also referred 
to the comment about his being "in slumber" and refuted the 
charge by mentioning the series of crisis-management measures he 
had undertaken on becoming the Finance Minister on June 24, 
1991. About the laxity in taking follow-up action too, he said 
that in May 1992 the Janakiraman committee was set up which gave 
its first report in one month. Within three to four days, the 
Government followed up the recommendations by setting up a 
Special Court in Bombay to try the offenders, handed over cases 
for investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation and 
sacked various bank officials from their posts. 
  About the foreign banks and their role in the scam, the 
Minister reiterated that they would not be allowed to get away 
with any violation of rules and regulations and that special 
audits had been undertaken and their lapses identified. The RBI 
had also set in position various measures to improve supervision 
over the banks in the country, including the provision of 
stricter audits. 
  The financial sector reforms too would ease the pressure of 
banks to earn higher income through "the back door," as the 
Finance Minister put it, because the new system would enable 
them to earn reasonable returns through normal operations and 
present acceptable balance sheets. On the other recommendations 
of the JPC, the Minister promised to get back to parliament in 
three months with reports of action taken on the suggestions.

<F P=106> [Article: "Air Chief Sees Need for Upgrading MiG 21"; </F>
quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Bangalore, Dec. 16. There was an urgent need to 
consider upgradation of the MiG-21 being flown by the Indian Air 
Force, said Air Chief Marshal, S.K. Kaul, Chief of Air Staff 
here. 
  India's Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), which would replace the 
MiG-21s, would enter operational service only around 2005, the 
Air Chief Marshal said at a press conference at the Bangalore 
air show today. The budgetary cuts had also made it necessary 
for the Air Force to prioritise its requirements. As a result, 
the upgradation of the MiG-21s, which the Air Force has used for 
over three decades, assumed importance. By upgrading the 
aircraft, it was possible to get enhanced capabilities with a 
smaller outlay. 
  There had been offers from various vendors and countries, he 
said in reply to a question. All the offers were being looked 
into. No decision had yet been taken, he added. 
  Full scale mock-up: Many of the companies which 
would be involved in the upgradation were present at the air 
show. The Russians had a full scale mock-up of the upgraded MiG 
on show. `We can offer India the option of Russian or Western 
avionics,' said a spokesman for MiG. The company had tie-ups 
with French companies, such as Thompson-CSF, and could offer 
Western avionics but at a higher cost. The improved MiG-21 would 
have significantly increased combat capabilities against air and 
ground targets. It would also be able to use the most up to date 
air-to-air missiles. 
  The Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) too is offering to 
upgrade the MiG-21s and had a mock-up of the improved cockpit on 
display. `We can provide the F-16's avionics capabilities for 
the MiG-21,' said an IAI spokesman. The cockpit would be 
completely modernised and the IAI upgraded MiG-21s would be able 
to carry both Western and Eastern weapons. the upgradation of 
each aircraft would not cost more than $3.5 millions. 
  HAL in fray: The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited 
(HAL) too is in the fray. `Apart from the Russians, we are the 
people best acquainted with the MiG-21,' said a company 
official. HAL too has a mock-up of its upgraded cockpit on show. 
HAL had already carried out several improvements on the MiG-21, 
and could offer the best mix of Indian, Russian and Western 
systems for upgradation, he said. It may be possible to use some 
of the electronic systems developed for the LCA in the MiG-21 
upgrade. 
  French avionics suppliers may well be major beneficiaries if 
either HAL or Russia gets the contract for the upgradation. The 
French companies have turned out in strength for the Bangalore 
air show and include the Thomson group and Sagem. Both companies 
point out the suitability of their systems for upgrading the 
MiG-21. HAL already manufactures under licence an inertial 
navigation and attack system of Sagem, for its Jaguar strike 
aircraft.

  [Text] Note. Chabahar Port nowadays has a new 
look. The rapid population growth and the expansion of urban 
services, combined with fundamental investments, indicate a 
bright future for this port. 
  Chabahar Port, on the shores of the Sea of Oman, with a 
favorable location and connected to the mainland, is considered 
the third free port of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and in 
terms of space and resources is the best transit center for 
goods from the sea to Central Asia and Afghanistan. 
  High-quality roads have made it possible for goods coming in 
on ships to be transported over land in the shortest possible 
time to their destiny of the republic to the north of our 
country. 
  For this reason, on the invitation of the public relations 
office of the Ports and Shipping Organization of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, a number of media representatives visited the 
ports in this region, the results of which you will read below. 
  According to the correspondent of the Economic Division of 
JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, Mr. Habibollah Ra'ufi, the director general 
of the office of Ports and Shipping of the Province of Sistan Va 
Baluchestan, at a gathering of media reporters who had traveled 
to Chabahar, announced that 98 percent of the activities of 
Chabahar Port have been given to the private sector and are only 
supervised by the Central Office of Ports and Shipping of this 
province. He said: In connection with the policy of reducing 
imports, in the nine months of this year, the amount of 
unloading of goods in Chabahar Port has decreased by 40 percent 
compared to a similar period last year. 
  He said: Before the revolution the Chabahar region was a 
deprived village with a population of 5,000 and lacked asphalted 
roads and urban services. After the start of the port building, 
fishing, and multipurpose dock projects, facilities such as 
desalination and naval communications systems were created, and 
at the preset this port has a population of 50,000 people. 
  Mr. Ra'ufi pointed out: In the province of Sistan Va 
Baluchestan, there are about 300 km of sea borders. The first 
port created in Chabahar was the "Martyr Beheshti Port," which 
is southwest of the city, and its dock was rapidly installed in 
nine months in 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] and put into 
operation. 
  The above-mentioned dock is 1 km from the shore with docking 
stations each 150 meters long for ships up to a capacity of 
25,000 tons and is the central dock in this region. 
  He added: The area and the coastal facilities of Martyr 
Beheshti Dock take up a total of 2,000 hectares[ha], of which 36 
ha are open warehouses and 18,000 ha covered warehouses. 
  Ra'ufi mentioned the total cost of the building of the 
Martyr 
Beheshti Port dock at $27 million in foreign currency and 1 
billion in rials and said: In this port, five desalination 
machines have been built, the capacity of each of which is 500 
cubic meters, a total of 2,500 cubic meters per day. If more are 
needed in the future, it can be expanded by up to 10 machines. 
  Also, because of these facilities (desalination) in the 
port, 
we are able to provide water needed by the transit ships. 
  The cost of the desalination machines is 30 million DM in 
foreign currency and 18 million tomans in rials, which has all 
been done by the private sector. 
  Concerning the operation of the nine months of this year of 
the ports and shipping of the province of Sistan Va Baluchestan, 
Mr. Ra'ufi said: From Farvardin [21 March-20 April] to the end 
of Azar this year [21 December 1993], 32 ships have entered 
Chabahar Port and about 650,000 tons of goods unloaded. Of this 
amount, 400,000 tons were dry goods, and the remaining 250,000 
tons were oil products. 
  The director-general of ports and shipping of Sistan Va 
Baluchestan said concerning the future programs of Martyr 
Beheshti Port: We have a large program planned for this port. 
For example, the wave-breaker project of this port, at 3 km in 
length with 12 dock stations, the installation of which will 
start in one month by Iranian experts and engineers and is 
projected to take five years. 
  He mentioned its weather as one of the advantages of this 
port, which is the warmest in the country in winter and the 
coolest in summer. 
  The director-general of ports and shipping of the province 
of 
Sistan Va Baluchestan announced that if the problem of goods 
transit is resolved in this region, this port will grow and 
said: If more facilities, such as customs exemptions, etc., are 
provided in this port for ships, the ships will be more willing 
to come to this region. Also, given the low cost of labor in 
this region, investors can invest in native industries, such as 
fishing, which in addition to creating jobs will also affect 
exports. 
  It is noteworthy that during the stay of the representatives 
of the media, one ship with a Cypriot flag and Cuban crew, which 
carried 14,000 tons of sugar purchased by the Islamic Republic 
from Brazil, docked at the Martyr Beheshti dock to unload and 
was immediately unloaded by the personnel of the port and sent 
in trailers to various centers of the country, including sugar 
factories. 
  This report also indicates: The representatives of the media 
visited the nonprofit girls school complex of Martyr Beheshti 
(Hadaf), which has been built by the Central Office of Ports and 
Shipping of the province of Sistan and Baluchestan, at the 
levels of preschool, elementary school, middle school, and high 
school. 
  This school has a staff of 20, and at the levels of 
preschool, elementary school, and middle school, 65, 120, and 45 
students, respectively, are studying. Students in this school 
take part in such extracurricular activities as sewing, 
computers, typing, reading and recitation of the Koran, and 
calligraphy. 
  The principal of the Martyr Beheshti Girls Schools (Hadaf), 
referring to the long distance and lack of housing and resources 
of the teachers and personnel of this educational center, 
expressed hope that next year teacher training school graduates 
of the province will be used in teaching.

<F P=106> [Article by Jawad al-Bashiti: "The Right to Compensation for </F>
the Right of Return"] 
  [Text] The gist of this article/treatment is that America's 
first-time abstention from voting for Resolution 194 may be 
intended to imply that Palestinians must choose between the 
right to a state and the right of return--between a political 
right and a human right. 
  Since UN General Assembly Resolution 194 was passed on 11 
December 1948, the United States alone every year has sponsored 
a vote on the resolution, renewing its support for it. Paragraph 
11 of this well-known international resolution (which Israel 
says binds no one, as it was passed by the General Assembly, not 
the Security Council) establishes the right of Palestinian 
refugees to return to their homes and live in peace with their 
neighbors and the obligation to pay compensation for property to 
those who choose not to return and for every missing or injured 
person. 
  Only this year did the United States take a different 
position. It refused to sponsor the motion to renew the 
international community's support for Resolution 194 and joined 
Israel in abstaining from voting. 
  The Arabs were dealt a double blow. They were gripped by 
fear 
that American policy in President Bill Clinton's administration 
would become more strongly inclined to disengage itself from the 
international authority for the Middle East peace process 
embodied in Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on 
the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  Critics of the Declaration of Principles agreement signed by 
the PLO and the Israeli government, as well as forces that were 
hostile to it from the beginning, can find in the new American 
position reason to conclude that the Oslo-Washington agreement 
was what allowed the United States to retreat from its 
traditional position on Resolution 194 as prelude to devising an 
unjust solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees. 
  Critics and opponents can also say that it is politically 
naive to demand that the United States be more royalist than the 
king or more Palestinian than the Palestinians, now that the PLO 
has signed an agreement that puts the refugee problem on the 
"permanent solution" agenda without mentioning Resolution 194, 
deemed to be the international authority for resolving this 
problem. 
  We will not evade a response to this point of view, which 
seems to have acquired some plausibility in the wake of and 
because of the recent American position, but we shall first try 
to assess the real dimensions of the American step. 
  About a year and a half ago, the United States announced 
that 
it had in the past supported and still supported UN General 
Assembly Resolution 194. This position was announced by the 
State Department's spokeswoman Margaret Tutweiler prior to the 
meeting in Ottawa of the committee on refugees that has emerged 
from the multilateral negotiations on regional cooperation in 
the Middle East. Her statement reinforced the feeling that Arab, 
and especially Palestinian, participation in the multilateral 
negotiations would help enable the American administration to 
develop its positions on the peace process and make them more 
positive by Arab-Palestinian standards. Certainly, the mention 
of Resolution 194 in official American statements raises in the 
minds of those who yearn for "a just peace" a headlong desire to 
believe that the Palestinian problem from A to Z will be 
resolved finally in a political settlement that drives into 
oblivion the "humanitarian clause" contained in Security Council 
Resolution 242. This clause revealed to us how much those who 
hold the reins of international policy wrapped in international 
legitimacy lack the humanitarian sense; for setting 
"humanitarian right" in place of what is "political right" 
represents a complete negation of true humanitarian criteria. 
  Of all Palestinian rights, the right of return is the one 
that most inspires the dreams of afflicted Palestinians. It will 
turn out to be an outrageous crime if the United States feigns 
inability to help us respond to this political and humanitarian 
need. This we say, having been taught by the experience of 
international politics that a major power's announced political 
commitment on an issue can for practical considerations turn 
into a political deception that its authors usually categorize 
as part of what they like to call "the political game." 
  Tutweiler's statement, which was in response to a 
journalist's question, was followed by an American official's 
admission that the administration preferred not to answer 
"questions of this kind." 
  The officially announced reason was that the American 
administration preferred to avoid raising difficult problems, 
such as the right of return for Palestinians, at the beginning 
of the talks, because raising them could lead to "the collapse 
of the house of cards" in which the peace negotiations are 
taking place. 
  Signaling that the United States would adhere to an 
interpretation of Resolution 194 that evaded the essence of the 
resolution, the American assistant secretary of state for Middle 
Eastern affairs, Ambassador Edward Djerejian said: "The matter 
(Tutweiler's statement) has been magnified and given more 
importance than it really has. You know the United States' 
position on Jerusalem. That is a good example of how the matter 
can be twisted." 
  It is indeed a good example. Resolution 194 also speaks 
about 
putting Jerusalem under United Nations custody, whereas the 
American position (which until the other day supported this 
resolution) leaves the destiny of Jerusalem to the negotiations 
and supports the city's continued unity. 
  How does the United States now justify its new position of 
abstaining from voting? 
  Explaining the reasons for his country's abstention, George 
Sherman, the American representative, said: "We want at this 
important moment to avoid problems that might cause division; 
for the positions of the parties in the region differ in 
important respects on the refugee issue, and these differences 
must be settled at the negotiating table." 
  After renewing America's strong commitment to "a 
comprehensive, just, and lasting peace," he expressed his 
government's hope that this peace would include a satisfactory 
settlement of the refugee problem. As for the "philosophical 
principles" of this American view, they are: "not showing 
partiality in advance, not prejudging the results of the 
negotiations, and rejecting any language that could be deemed a 
premature judgment." 
  The American representative registered his country's 
objection to such expressions as "occupied Palestinian land, 
including Jerusalem," and "Palestinian and other Arab lands that 
Israel has occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem." According 
to the American representative's explanation, these phrases or 
expressions could be considered "prejudiced and prematurely 
judging the results of the negotiations." 
  For the same reasons, the United States abstained from 
voting 
on a draft resolution on the Golan "condemning Israel, the 
occupying power, for refusing to obey resolutions on the 
occupied Syrian Golan, particularly Security Council Resolution 
497, in which the Council deemed that Israel's decision to 
impose its laws, judicial rule, and administration on the Golan 
was null and void and of no effect under international law and 
demanded that Israel rescind the decision immediately." 
  We do not know how this American position squares with 
Clinton's announcement that his meeting with Syria's President 
Hafiz al-Asad "will show the authority of the foundations of the 
process for a comprehensive, lasting peace." 
  Washington has transferred the refugee question from the 
bilateral to the multilateral negotiations. At the same time, 
Washington has prevented making Resolution 194 a basis for 
negotiations in the committee on refugees. Washington has 
announced several times that it opposes raising the question of 
the Palestinians' right to return at the multilateral 
negotiations on refugees. 
  Although the United States has moved the subject of the 
refugees to the multilateral negotiations, it has affirmed on 
many occasions that this subject must be discussed when the 
parties begin negotiating in the bilateral negotiations about 
the final disposition. 
  Washington views the committee on refugees that has emerged 
from the multilateral negotiations as the place where the 
"technical aspects" of the refugee problem and its mode of 
resolution can be discussed. 
  But only the bilateral negotiations based on Resolution 242 
are responsible for finding "a just solution to the refugee 
problem" in accordance with this resolution. In the context of 
the bilateral negotiations, from the purely legal point of view 
the United Nations can at the appropriate time interpret "a just 
solution" to the refugee problem as being full implementation of 
Resolution 194. In seeking to interpret the phrase "just 
solution," the international organization cannot ignore 
Resolution 194, for the legitimate international authority is an 
indivisible whole. Without downplaying the significance of the 
latest American position, we expect the United States to 
continue its support for Resolution 194--this because it is the 
party most eager for the peace negotiations to encompass all the 
difficult issues and problems for whose solution the United 
Nations has defined foundations through its various resolutions. 
The most important thing for Washington is that the political 
negotiations reach results in light of which one can claim that 
all UN resolutions have turned into agreements between the 
parties, even if these agreements turn out to have the form of a 
distorted and arbitrary interpretation of the resolutions of the 
international authority. 
  Even Israel wants a certain implementation of Resolution 
194. 
It hopes that the negotiations on a "final solution" will arrive 
at results that guarantee the Palestinian refugees their right 
to compensation for their right to return to their homes. 
  Perhaps the most important thing that must be avoided is 
indulging in the illusion that the UN General Assembly is 
capable of implementing Resolution 194. For 45 years, the 
Assembly has stated that the condition of the refugees is 
disturbing and has expressed regret that no means have yet been 
reached to realize progress in implementing paragraph 11 of 
Resolution 194. 
  Yet, what if paragraph 11 were implemented under the current 
circumstances of the peace process? 
  Israel, with support from the United States and other 
powers, 
would strongly reject allowing the Palestinian refugees to 
return to their homes, so that compensation would become the 
likely alternative. And compensation by itself would not be the 
solution, since Israel would seek to make it part of a process 
of resettling the refugees in Arab and foreign countries and 
granting them the nationalities of these countries. 
  Palestinians can in no way accept such a solution. The focus 
of their striving and struggle will remain guaranteeing the 
refugees' right to return to their homes and guaranteeing the 
right of returnees or those who receive compensation to obtain 
Palestinian nationality, so that the Palestinian state in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip will belong to Palestinians wherever 
they may be. 
  While holding fast to Resolution 194, we realize that some 
requirements of a just solution to the Palestinian refugee 
problem cannot be found in this resolution. A just solution to 
the refugee problem cannot come about through implementation of 
Resolution 194, just as it cannot come about without its 
implementation. The impact of the political and strategic 
pressures by which the state of Palestine has been limited 
geographically to the West Bank and Gaza Strip must be 
neutralized as regards the demography of this state, so that the 
economy can be its defining factor in regard to population.

  [Text] Iron ore in the amount of 3,338,000 tons was 
excavated from the Chagharat Mine in the city of Bafeq. Compared 
to a similar period last year, this shows a 6.2-percent decrease. 
  Hasan Nikkar, the general manager of the Central Iranian 
Iron 
Ore Company (Bafeq) said to IRNA's reporter: Using the railroads 
during this period, 2,062,640 tons of iron ore were transported 
to the Esfahan Steel Mill. 
  On the whole, he mentioned the excavation operations during 
this period as 7,046,000 tons and the amount of exploratory 
excavation as 3,708,000 tons and added: The operations for 
excavation and exploratory excavation increased by 12.7 percent 
and 37.5 percent, respectively, compared to the previous year. 
  He added: It is anticipated that by the end of this year, 
5,220,000 tons of iron ore will be excavated from the Chagharat 
Mine, of which 3.5 million tons will be transported to Esfahan 
Steel Mill. 
  The Chagharat Mine is one of the largest automated mines in 
the country, which is located 130 km from the capital of Yazd 
Province, and its decisive reserves at the start of activities 
were 215 million tons.

<F P=106> [Article by Ghanim al-Mutayri: "Kuwait Grants Naturalized </F>
Citizens the Right to Vote, Run for Office"] 
  [Text] The Kuwaiti Cabinet has agreed in principle to allow 
children of naturalized citizens, who are born after their 
fathers acquire Kuwaiti citizenship, to exercise their right to 
be a candidate and to vote. 
  Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs 'Abd-al-'Aziz Dakhil 
said that, in its regular session on 23 January, the Cabinet 
reviewed a draft bill referred from the National Assembly to 
amend the regulation in Law No 51/1959 concerning Kuwaiti 
citizenship, aimed at permitting children of naturalized 
citizens to vote and run for office on equal footing with 
Kuwaitis who obtained Kuwaiti citizenship by birth. 
  It was decided that the final form of the bill will be 
determined in the Cabinet's next meeting, and will be referred 
back to the National Assembly for debate and decision. 
  On another matter, a Kuwaiti security source confirmed to 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT on 23 January that a security force had raided 
the building of the Palestinian embassy in Kuwait on the evening 
of 22 January. He said that was done in accordance with legal 
procedures, referring to the fact that the members of this force 
were empowered to enter the embassy building on a warrant from 
the Public Prosecutor's Office. 
  The source explained that the decision to enter the 
Palestinian embassy building was made by Criminal Investigation 
and State Security personnel, after a person accused of 
burglarizing several homes in the area confessed that the 
weapon, which he had used, had been obtained from the embassy 
building located in the Hawalli area. 
  The same source said that this matter necessitated that the 
prosecutor's office issue a warrant to search the building in 
the presence of a responsible official from the prosecutor's 
office. He said that the authorities had banned newsmen and 
photographers from entering the embassy building, which has been 
abandoned since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. However, certain 
Kuwaiti newspapers reported that machine guns, pistols, and 
ammunition had been found in the embassy building and were 
confiscated. The remains of a body was also discovered; it was 
hanging, supported by one of the walls.

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-Ashhab: "Opposition Renews Demands </F>
for More Democratic Measures"] 
  [Text] Rabat--The confrontation between the opposition and 
Prime Minister Mohamed Karim Lamrani's government has entered a 
period of escalation that threatens to break out of the rules of 
the current dialogue. Two days ago, the opposition parties 
protested the way in which the government answers deputies' 
questions, calling it vague and general. 
  This took place when opposition deputy Abderrahman Haraichi 
raised a question about the case of Shaykh Abdessalem Yacine, 
whom the police have kept under house arrest in the city of 
Sale, north of the capital Rabat, for three years. Human Rights 
Minister Omar Azzimane replied that, as the case was now on the 
calendar of the court system, which was studying it, the 
prerogatives of the justice system had to be respected. The 
opposition deputy responded that no such case existed in the 
justice system: that the matter concerned only a complaint that 
Abdessalem Yacine's lawyers had submitted to the court for a 
review of his house arrest, and that relevant sources had stated 
that Shaykh Yacine had submitted a letter on the subject to the 
departments concerned. 
  Significantly, the raising of the case of Shaykh Abdessalem 
Yacine, the head of the Association for Justice and Benevolence 
whose bureau members were recently tried on the charge of 
distributing illegal publications, coincided with escalating 
opposition party demands for greater political relaxation, 
release of all detainees, and the return of exiles. Mohamed Ben 
Said, head of the opposition Organization of [Popular] 
Democratic Action, said: "We still demand constitutional and 
political reform. We also demand respect for human rights and 
cleansing Morocco of all detention camps like Tazmamart [name as 
transliterated]." This was a reference to the detention center 
that used to bear this name. The Moroccan authorities demolished 
it and released dozens of the military prisoners who were living 
there. 
  Mohamed Ben Said said, "We are not against trying those 
accused: an accused person must be tried, whatever the charge 
against him may be." Here he was quoting the Moroccan opposition 
figure Mohamed Basri, who, having lived in exile for more than a 
quarter century, has said he is prepared to return to the 
country if political relaxation and a return of exiles take 
place. 
  At a Rabat political meeting last Tuesday celebrating the 
anniversary of the [1944] independence manifesto, Istiqlal Party 
leader Mohamed Boucetta said: "Building a state of truth, law, 
and respect for human rights must not remain merely a wish that 
pervades civil society. The experience of the recent elections 
has shown that the Moroccan people are committed to change and 
ready to sacrifice for it." 
  Mohamed Yazghi, deputy head of the Socialist Union, said: 
"On 
the threshold of the 21st century, we cannot accept Morocco's 
remaining without a truly democratic system. It is unthinkable 
for the mixing of power to remain as it is now. It is 
unthinkable for the Constitution to be applied as it is now." 
This is a renewed affirmation of the opposition parties' refusal 
to work with the new government that Mohamed Karim Lamrani has 
formed from technocrats. Opposition figures call it 
unconstitutional because it did not emerge from the 
parliamentary majority. Official sources, on the other hand, 
attribute the government's makeup to the opposition parties' 
refusal to participate in a proposed government and to the 
majority parties' request for a respite to reorganize 
themselves; however, the program the new government is pledged 
to implement is the same one that King Hassan II proposed to the 
opposition parties. Against this background, the opposition 
parties are wagering on creating a political and constitutional 
vacuum, so that they can resume dialogue with official 
authorities on forming a new government. Some sources believe 
that the opposition parties' allusion to human rights cases and 
the condition of Islamic groups whose attitudes they do not 
share is aimed at pressuring the government and embarrassing the 
majority parties, which find themselves called on to support a 
government in which they are not participating. 
  Signs of dissatisfaction emerged recently in majority 
circles. These claim that the restructuring process is facing 
difficulties because of their pledge to support the new 
government and because the scope of their freedom is being 
further restricted, while the opposition alone aims more 
criticisms at the executive apparatus. The former majority 
parties are expected to hold meetings to coordinate their 
positions on the proposed new budget, which still has not been 
able to be approved. Meanwhile, the official authorities have 
issued administrative decrees to disburse funds in emergency 
sectors. 
  Interested circles see the call by the opposition 
parties--Socialist Union of Popular Forces, Istiqlal, and 
Organization of Democratic Popular Action--for the creation of a 
constitutional body to oversee elections and for direct election 
of all members of Parliament as a new attempt to put political 
pressure on Mohamed Karim Lamrani's government. The least of 
this was their signaling that they would not accept the 
invalidation of a limited number of constituencies. This is the 
view that has prevailed until now for overcoming the current 
political problem following the issuance of Constitutional 
Chamber rulings invalidating the results of no fewer than ten 
election districts, including one of the districts in which a 
candidate from the opposition Party of Progress and Socialism 
won. 
  Informed circles do not discount the possible issuance of 
new 
rulings affecting figures who belong to opposition parties, 
particularly Istiqlal and the Socialist Union, particularly 
because the invalidation ought to include all the results of 
indirect balloting. This is a demand which, in the view of 
official sources, has no basis in law or the Constitution. 
  Political circles attribute this escalation to the fact that 
the opposition parties, which needed no fewer than 40 seats to 
form a parliamentary majority qualifying them to participate in 
the government, having made great progress in the results of 
last June's direct elections, want to achieve this gain by means 
of political pressure. They believe that the problem that 
resulted from electing a third of the members of Parliament by 
indirect balloting has a political nature and therefore must be 
remedied by a political solution. The least of this would be 
granting their demand that a large number of outcomes of this 
balloting be invalidated, since their participation in any 
anticipated government is subject to their winning a 
parliamentary majority. On the other hand, official sources 
repeat that there is nothing to prevent their participating in 
the government, despite their being a minority, on the basis of 
seeking a formula of new alliances or taking advantage of the 
situation of the current majority, which in any case will not 
withdraw its confidence from the government.

  [Text] On the 50th anniversary of the presentation of the 
11 January manifesto demanding independence, the three national 
democratic parties--the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, 
Istiqlal, and the Organization of Popular Democratic 
Action--issued a historic statement demanding that democracy be 
strengthened in the country by implementing a series of 
political points and reforms. The following is the text of the 
historic statement: 
  In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate. 
  The 50th anniversary of the presentation of the manifesto 
demanding independence and democracy falls on 11 January 1994. 
  It is an occasion on which the three democratic 
parties--Istiqlal, the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, and 
the Organization of Popular Democratic Action--stand up to 
evaluate the conditions that Morocco faces in future years as it 
stands on the threshold of the 21st century after a half-century 
during which its people have continued the struggle to realize 
their goals of liberation, democracy, and social justice in the 
full sense. 
  While recognition of political independence was achieved due 
to the struggle of the king and the people in full harmony, 
building a free national state in the framework of 
constitutional monarchy and on the principles of political, 
economic, social, and cultural democracy is still faltering 38 
years after the declaration of independence and has not taken a 
decisive course toward concrete realization. 
  Sensing their responsibilities after the crisis through 
which 
Morocco has been passing, with the tremendous challenges this 
has presented, the three democratic parties renew their pledge 
to continue the struggle to fulfill the goals of the National 
Charter (the manifesto of 11 January 1944) in its spirit and 
aspirations, to embark forcefully to save the country from the 
dangers that threaten it, and to establish conditions for 
democratic change in the framework of a sincere national 
agreement that lays the foundation for the elements of a modern 
democratic state, embodies the principle of popular sovereignty, 
and lays a firm basis for a strong, progressive Morocco. 
  True democracy can free the country from perversions such as 
widespread injustice, corruption, bribery, exploitation of 
influence, illegitimate wealth, and plundering of the people's 
money, land, and resources. 
  True democracy can end human rights violations, protect 
public and private freedoms, guarantee citizens' rights to free 
and fair elections and their right to food, work, education, 
medical care, and housing, and provide equal opportunity for all 
to raise the physical and spiritual level of their lives under 
the aegis of mutual responsibility and social justice. 
  True democracy can confront the requirements for continued 
economic and social development and for enabling Moroccan 
society to open up to the requirements of scientific and 
cultural development in connection with the changes that the 
international community is experiencing in all economic, 
geostrategic, technological, and cultural areas. These things 
make it imperative for our country to apply democracy as an 
absolute necessity for winning the challenges of the future and 
responding to the aspirations of coming generations. 
  Calling to mind the stages of the democratic struggle to 
bring about the constitutional and political reforms that the 
masses of the Moroccan people have never ceased hoping to 
achieve, the three democratic parties declare their fidelity to 
their previous demands. They confirm that one of the first 
reforms that must be made is continued work to approve new 
constitutional changes to guarantee greater balance of powers 
and firmly establish executive, legislative, and judicial 
structures that satisfy all the conditions for credibility, 
effectiveness, and responsibility. Specifically, this requires: 
  --Electing all members of Parliament by direct, general 
election. 
  --Creating a supreme constitutional body independent of the 
government apparatus and having full power to oversee the 
election process, regulate all its stages, and guarantee its 
freedom and fairness. 
  --Creating a supreme accounting council to be raised to the 
level of a constitutional body with the role of controlling 
implementation of the state budget, monitoring the public 
sector, and combatting all forms of waste and corruption. 
  --Founding special constitutional bodies charged with 
participating in defining public policy in various fields: such 
as the Supreme Council on Culture and Information, the Supreme 
Council on Defense, and the Supreme Council on Education, in 
addition to the Economic and Social Council whose creation has 
been approved in principle. 
  As they celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 11 January 
1944 
manifesto with pride and steadfastness, the three democratic 
parties proclaim that they will remain devoted to the spirit of 
the independence and democracy manifesto and will adhere to 
united action as a way to build a democratic, progressive 
Morocco. They call on the masses of the Moroccan people and all 
its vital forces that believe in democratic change to join 
consciously and responsibly in demanding an end to the attempts 
at cheating and falsification that were behind our country's 
failure to achieve the cultural development we seek and to 
realize the ambitions of our successive generations for 
modernization and prosperity under a constitutional, 
social-democratic monarchy in which Moroccans enjoy freedom, 
justice, equality, and a dignified life.

Democratic] Action

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Finance Minister Mohamed Sagou on Tuesday submitted 
the 1994 finance bill to Parliament. It was contained in an 
extended written speech, interspersed with some verbal 
exchanges. Regardless of the fact that the bill is being 
submitted to the Parliament more than one and one-half months 
after the expiry of the legal limit and in view of the short 
time available to the Parliament to debate it, we hasten to say 
that the bill is characterized by its being essentially based on 
an old and antiquated concept. It provides no clear or 
harmonious answers to questions relating to the present reality, 
although it consists of some procedural matters. 
  Reading the finance bill will, at the first instance, show 
that it stems from the desire to resolve its inherent 
contradiction with the reality and with its requirements, by 
absorbing this contradiction within its own form, structure, and 
procedures. 
  What is actually needed is to ease the heavy tax burden on 
the economy, particularly income tax, and to realize some kind 
of tax compatibility that would generate competition in the 
economic field, particularly with the aim of redirecting private 
investment and creating conditions suitable for financing the 
economy and removing the obstacles that created bottlenecks in 
the past two years. The aim is also to find satisfactory 
solutions for the public debt arrears that accumulated during 
the past years, while maintaining social stability based on 
acceptable balances, and to fulfill promises that have 
repeatedly been made but never fulfilled. 
  But the finance bill has done what can be described as 
short-circuiting all that in one way or another. It does so by 
adopting mathematical equations ranging between plus and minus 
so that the official rhetoric on the bill may be able to find 
something to say about and to justify things, without revealing 
the fact that the bill is essentially a choice of programs for 
the new government, which promised that the bill would be an 
embodiment of its programs, following a featureless statement. 
  Evidently the bill wants first and foremost to reach a 
figure, which is 1.5 percent. The aim is to confine the treasury 
deficit within the constraints of this figure and to make it 
compatible with the GDP. Nobody objects to showing interest in 
the financial balances or minimizing their significance on both 
the domestic and foreign relations level. This is contrary to 
what the minister argued in vain. Focusing on a particular 
figure could be suitable for an academic hypothesis, but 
insisting on it as a precondition will not allow them to make a 
choice that is a compromise between the balances and realities, 
a choice which the various factions of the society are calling 
for and which acts as a sound arbiter among them. This is 
regardless of whether or not the figures relevant to it can be 
realized and the extent to which they will be adhered to. 
  Perhaps it was setting this ceiling for the bill that gives 
it a particular mathematical character and takes away from it 
the qualities of a serious bill resulting from integrated 
economic and social policies with broad vistas. 
  It is apparent from the various figures of the bill that it 
is a settlement between figures, balancing figures with one 
another on paper, and playing with figures within the 
constraints of a very low ceiling. 
  Servicing the public debt is increasing, growing, and 
becoming heavy. It exposes the failure to solve the problem last 
year. In fact it has gotten worse 1983 and 1993. It has 
increased several fold since the beginning of the structural 
evaluation and the rescheduling of debts. The calculations first 
and foremost address servicing the foreign debt. The debt 
increased from 15.475280905 dirhams to 17.513564480 dirhams [as 
published] (that is about $1.86 billion). That is an increase of 
13.17 percent. Keeping in mind that rescheduling private and 
public debt is no longer possible to do in the old-fashioned 
way. The Paris and London clubs have decided to end the debt 
rescheduling soap opera. 
  Given the pressure of the 1.5 percent ceiling set for the 
total treasury deficit, the calculations based on servicing the 
debt leave no room for financial options that would help 
economic revival and the relaunching of the social policies 
after a long period of stagnation. 
  The finance bill options in this case have been put between 
pincers' jaws, leaving no room for the balance sheet other than 
maintaining control, with the balance sheet itself becoming an 
option. The problem lies here. And because the World Bank has 
its directives, these have been endorsed by what seemed to be a 
parallel parliament that was recently convened in Casablanca. It 
was necessary for these directives to be integrated with the 
accounts, as has customarily been done since the eighties. 
  And because these directives primarily revolve around the 
private sector, they have been partially absorbed in them, 
within the limits allowed between the pincers' jaws. Within this 
framework, the corporation tax has been reduced to 37 percent, 
although the World Bank recommends that it should not exceed 35 
percent on average. This is followed by reducing the highest 
average of public tax on income to 47 percent, followed by 
reducing the value added tax levied on bank interest, by 
subjecting the government treasury bonds to a partial tax, and 
by reducing the import tax on building material 10 percent while 
raising it 15 percent with respect to most other imports. 
  These tax measures constitute the proposed basic laws of the 
finance bill as a whole, while anything else remains marginal. 
  If these measures are viewed in light of the aforementioned 
World Bank directives, coupled with the measures relevant to 
them, such as increasing the portion exempt from public tax from 
15,000 dirhams to 18,000 dirhams. Here we immediately discover 
that these measures carry inherent contradictions, to which we 
referred at the beginning, as long as they constitute a partial 
step toward responding to the World Bank directives rather than 
fully responding to them. They partially respond to demands put 
forward by the private, sector but do not respond to them 
fully...et cetera [as published], because the pincers' jaws in 
question continue to exert pressure. 
  There has been demand that steps should be taken to restore 
to the state its rational economic role on the ground that this 
is one of the basic and urgent conditions for reviving the 
economy after two years of general economic recession and 
reduced growth. Therefore, the government has increased the 
investment budget to 3.99 billion dirhams (the equivalent of 
$423.6 million) compared with 1993 (15.1 billion dirhams 
compared with approximately 19 billion dirhams) [as published]. 
This is to show that there is an increase. Regardless of how 
closely the investment budgets are adhered to and how they are 
disposed of, that increase remains an increase on paper. In the 
end it is a mathematical result, and the fact that it is limited 
in scope shows that the will to revive the economy is 
nonexistent. We need not recall that public investment has an 
impact on the national economy and on national investment which 
has been weak since record-keeping was started. This also 
affects the contracting sector, such as public works and 
construction. 
  As for the social policy promised by the government in a 
loosely worded statement, the balance sheets that governed 
drafting the finance law have failed to bring it into effect. 
Rather, the pincers have pressed hard. Despite the fact that the 
number of jobs expected to be created has been set at 25,000 
jobs, and regardless of whether they will really be created or 
remain in storage, they realize no real progress in the field of 
absorbing a large number of unemployed, particularly those with 
higher education diplomas, that has reached more than 150,000. 
The funds allocated to revive employment are vaguely defined so 
far in terms of goals, means of financing, ways of expenditure, 
and trusteeship...et cetera. [as published] It must be pointed 
out in this regard that the proposed granting of loans to 
persons engaged in economic revival has failed. The contractual 
retraining program has made no progress. Both projects did not 
really absorb unemployed people nor did they open new vistas in 
the employment field. Allocating a special fund for job creation 
under the supervision of the ministry of finance does not mean 
that it will succeed or achieve objectives that were not 
achieved previously, notwithstanding the allocation of one 
billion dirhams to the fund. 
  Increasing the tax-free portion of income to 18,000 dirhams 
does not result in a real increase in the income of people with 
limited or middle income. Rather this is yet another joke that 
is the subject of mockery and bitterness. 
  The government continues to adhere to its unintelligent 
method of responding to the demands submitted by the unions 
representing the working factions in the field of wages and 
salaries. The value of these salaries and wages has been frozen; 
they lost much of their real value, resulting in a major drop in 
the purchasing power of the majority population in the face of 
the increasing inflation. This has also resulted in a drop in 
consumption and in the shrinkage of the domestic market, with 
all its economic effects. The drop in consumption is a major 
cause of economic stagnation in the past years as well as for 
the crisis in the contracting market. 
  On the social level, the budget of the national ministry of 
education, which increased only by 5.06 percent, and of the 
ministry of health, which increased only by 9.76 percent, and 
the expected limited investments in the two budgets show that 
the government makes no provisions for real social investments, 
considering the acute shortage in education and medical 
facilities and staffs. It also gives no consideration to the 
workers' conditions. 
  Clearly these limited increases are a far cry from the 
bombastic speeches about the will to carry out reforms in the 
social field. Meanwhile certain problems are left to rot, 
including those of education in the countryside and health care 
in towns and villages and other such issues. 
  The same thing can be said about the housing situation that 
calls for a determined policy and mobilization of all available 
resources, particularly resources of the social reserve funds. 
It is known that at no time was the management of these funds 
socially oriented. Instead, deductions from wages and salaries 
have been blatantly used to increase the wealth of a few people. 
  The government, given the data available to it, should be 
more certain than anybody else that the social policy cannot be 
left to market forces; for in no country, however liberal it may 
be, are socioeconomic factors laissez-faire, because leaving 
them unchecked means subjecting them to savagery. Social 
problems are far too difficult to be left to the market for 
resolution. Above all, the government is called upon to channel 
revenues from income taxes and from national resources 
exploitation into the social arena in order to improve social 
conditions and the standard of living, not just because this 
falls within the jurisdiction of government, but also because it 
is what makes a government legitimate, given that governmental 
legitimacy is based on seeking acceptable social balances, as 
the experience of peoples and countries has confirmed.

  [Text] Two weeks have passed since the minister of finance 
submitted the finance bill to the Chamber of Representatives. 
The committees studied the general budget and the sectors' 
budgets throughout last week. The Chamber's public meetings are 
to be held in order to hear the views and stands of the parties 
and labor unions on the bill. 
  The citizens who have been suffering because of soaring 
prices and unemployment expect this bill to address some of 
their problems and to open, at least, a breach in the wall of 
the crisis that is growing worse from one government to the 
next. The most important clause to those waiting for relief is 
the one dealing with the social sectors. People expect measures 
to be taken to improve those sectors, to boost purchasing power, 
to provide suitable housing, and to create jobs. 
  When the finance minister read the bill, he placed the 
social 
sectors seventh in order of priority and focused on two points: 
  First, the number of jobs, which he said increased from 
15,000 to 25,510 jobs. 
  Second, the establishment of a fund for the employment of 
youth, to which one billion dirhams have been allocated. 
  The jobs, according to the bill, are distributed as follows: 
  Education and Health, 8,100 jobs. 
  Ministries of Justice, Finance, and others, about 2,500 
jobs. 
  Security jobs such as gendarmes and national security, about 
15,000 jobs. 
  Therefore, less than 35 percent of the jobs are allocated to 
the ministries of social affairs. 
  With regard to "Youth Employment Development Fund," it is 
not 
definite yet whether its funds will finance the new jobs. But it 
appears that the Fund is the subject of a dispute between the 
prime minister and the minister of finance over its "ownership." 
The presentation memo of the finance bill says that "particular 
attention has been devoted to the finance bill, which is evident 
in the allocation of one billion dirhams in the prime minister's 
investment budget to a special treasury account that has been 
established for this purpose." As for section two (article 42) 
of the finance bill, its first clause provides that "out of the 
desire to control the accounts of operations relating to 
developing the employment of youth, an account shall be 
established to be called `Youth Employment Development Fund.'" 
The minister of finance will be responsible for receiving its 
revenues and spending its expenses. 
  The ministers present at the committee's budget discussions 
appeared to treat the social aspect somewhat indifferently. The 
attitudes of the government (and its parliamentary majority) 
will be clarified following the changes the nationalist and 
democratic parties have proposed. The status of the social 
situation in the official policy and those who applaud it will 
be defined. 
  The committee meetings have also enabled the representatives 
to get acquainted with several areas of interest to the 
"technocrat government." The rule provides that the 
qualifications of the minister should be compatible with the 
task assigned to him. Unfortunately, some ministers' knowledge 
of the Arabic language as a constitutional language is poor. 
Some of them have shown that they are not familiar with the 
specifics of the Moroccan citizen's living conditions and his 
basic needs.

<F P=106> [Article by Ridha Lahmar: "GATT: What Effects on Tunisia?"] </F>
  [Text] Is GATT a genuinely free choice or a "compulsory 
choice" for our country? Will it provide us with easier access 
to export markets and advanced technology? Will it promote 
job-creating foreign investments and partnership projects in 
Tunisia? In a word, will Tunisia's accession to GATT and the 
concluding negotiations for a final signing of GATT by the big 
powers as it was written serve our country's interests and 
enable us to achieve the goals of the Eighth Development Plan? 
  Is there free choice when 117 countries out of 170 have 
signed and the international financial community makes accession 
to GATT a condition for receiving its development assistance? 
With those facts as our background, how should we proceed in 
order to ensure that our accession will have the maximum 
positive fallout on our economy and our society? It all depends 
on our ability to ensure the competitiveness of our firms and 
reform the structures of our economy. 
<H5>  Dangers, Challenges of GATT </H5>
  Tunisia acceded to GATT in July 1990. It is therefore bound 
by the obligations set forth in that agreement and enjoys the 
benefits it provides. But certain domestic changes and 
conditions are essential if Tunisia is to benefit from the 
agreement. As a signatory country to GATT, our country has 
access to a tremendous data bank concerning world trade: 
information on quantities, prices, and the quality of all 
products and all destinations make it possible to better direct 
the efforts of our exporters and manufacturers so as to produce 
better and sell better. This makes it a powerful means of 
diversifying our exports in an environment of nontariff barriers 
and of customs obstacles that are easier to get around. Also, 
belonging to GATT strengthens Tunisia in its disagreements with 
the big powers, since it means that Tunisia can have recourse to 
often effective arbitration in which it will be able to put 
forward the interests of its firms and entire sections of its 
economy. 
<H5>  GATT and Our Agriculture </H5>
  The GATT agreements call for a 21-percent reduction in 
direct 
and indirect agricultural subsidies over a six-year period. That 
will be followed by a reduction in the volume of subsidized 
sales of meat, milk, and cereals (all staple products essential 
for feeding the population). The world price of wheat, which is 
heavily subsidized in the United States, is currently $125 per 
metric ton, whereas the price of Tunisian hard wheat is 24 
dinars per quintal, or twice as much. Some people have said that 
Tunisian cereal production is too expensive for reasons having 
to do with productivity, whereas U.S. agriculture, although 
highly mechanized and productive, is heavily subsidized. But why 
deprive the Tunisian consumer of milk and meat from the EEC, 
whose surpluses benefit from particularly large subsidies: who 
can compete with meat from the EEC that costs from 12 to 15 
French francs per kilogram net, CIF [cost, freight, and 
insurance] Tunis? 
  The fact is that such competition with Tunisian agriculture 
is unfair. The danger of GATT, then, is that it will lead to a 
short-term rise in the cost of living because it will reduce 
subsidies at the source of our imports, and our own production 
cannot meet our domestic demand. On the other hand, our exports 
will enjoy improved access to foreign markets: sales of olive 
oil, citrus fruit, and so on will increase in volume and value, 
since the similar European products with which they compete will 
no longer be subsidized. That is the framework for our country's 
efforts to intensify the irrigated production of fruits and 
vegetables, modernize cereal growing, and develop our fishing 
and stockraising potential to increase production and the 
profitability of farming in order to feed a steadily growing and 
ever-more demanding population and improve the food trade 
balance. Our agriculture must modernize its structures and 
increase its ability to withstand foreign competition through an 
increase in added value. The state has done a great deal to 
improve the infrastructure, and private operators must assume 
their responsibilities and take advantage of the state's 
incentives. 
<H5>  Our Industry and GATT </H5>
  The gradual disappearance of the MFA [Multifiber Agreement], 
which provided the rich countries with artificial protection 
from the commercial aggressiveness of textiles from the Third 
World, will open up the markets in those countries to us. They 
are big consumers of all kinds of clothing. But production costs 
in our country are too high for us to compete with the four 
"dragons" of Southeast Asia (where the hourly cost of manpower 
is $2.60, compared to $12 in Tunisia). 
  Provided that our firms are able to grow and restructure 
rapidly, modernize their equipment, and achieve more integrated 
production, our salvation lies is specializing in the upscale 
end of the market through the use of more capable and skilled 
manpower. We find, however, that our industrial firms continue 
to be small, family-scale enterprises with financial resources 
and especially capital funds that are limited by the refusal to 
open up their family capital to the public and other investors, 
the reason being their fear of losing majority control on the 
boards of directors. 
  We have few PME [small and medium-size businesses] and no 
Tunisian multinationals, but what we do have mostly is 
microbusinesses lacking the resources to stand up to the big 
international financial groups. It is true that they have 
management flexibility, but that is not enough to ensure 
competitiveness. 
<H5>  GATT and Services </H5>
  It is true that we have great potential in the field of 
services: tourism, engineering, commercial companies, 
advertising firms, banks, insurance, and so on. But we must 
restructure our firms so that they will have the size, 
managerial staff, and "sales strength" of the big firms as well 
as the necessary management and marketing. Our building and 
public works industry, which lost 50 percent of its potential in 
1986, must modernize in order to export. 
  There are not several ways to go about it: the only 
solutions 
are partnerships and a strengthening of capital. Otherwise, we 
are in danger of being invaded by large financial groups that 
will set up local branches and conquer a good share of the 
market. Our company heads must strengthen their potential for 
competing locally and for exporting their activities: they need 
to look around elsewhere and see what they can do. 
<H5>  Safeguarding Our Specific Culture </H5>
  In the face of the audiovisual multinationals--the Hollywood 
giants that turn out films and fiction thrillers at an 
industrial pace and extol sex and violence, we are in danger of 
being irrevocably invaded and seeing our children's education 
spoiled by the Western media, which have "proven themselves" in 
the negative sense of that expression. We must safeguard our 
cultural and artistic heritage, which is unique and finds its 
source in our ancestral values. We must avoid the artistic and 
cultural veneer of the civilization represented by Coca-Cola, 
McDonald's, and rock and roll, which has led the youth of New 
York's neighborhoods and of the Paris suburbs to the spiral of 
delinquency.

<F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: "Clinton's Letter Reflects `U.S. </F>
Stand on Kashmir'"; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Washington, Jan. 7. The U.S. State Department today 
sought to dispel the impression of any change in the current 
American approach towards Kashmir. 
  Responding to questions on the letter that the U.S. 
President, Mr. Bill Clinton, had written to an activist on 
Kashmir, the State Department said the letter "reflects the 
consistent stand that the administration has taken on Kashmir, 
namely that the U.S. wishes to see a peaceful resolution of all 
issues between India and Pakistan, including Kashmir." 
  In a letter to Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, Executive Director of 
the 
Kashmir American Council, Mr. Clinton had said, "I look forward 
to working with you and others to help bring peace to Kashmir, 
and I appreciate your input." 
  When questioned on the letter yesterday by the reporters, 
the 
spokesman of the State Department, Mr. Mike McCurry, denied any 
change in policy and directed the questions to the White House. 
Today the State Department provided a comprehensive reiteration 
of its now standard formulations on Kashmir. 
  Stating that the U.S. did not see itself in a "mediator's 
role," the Clinton Administration said that it was "willing to 
assist India and Pakistan to reach and implement agreements if 
they both so desire." In response to the question whether the 
letter reflected a heightened concern for human rights, the 
Administration said it had been raising its concerns with the 
Indian Government "regularly, frankly, and in the spirit of 
friendship." Washington has been urging that the rights 
enshrined in the Indian Constitution be protected fully in 
practice, including in those areas where security forces are 
engaged in counter-insurgency activities." The administration 
has welcomed the recent Indian initiatives on human rights and 
hopes that they will lead to "further progress in Indian human 
rights practices." 
  Stating categorically that the letter from Mr. Clinton to 
Dr. 
Fai did not reflect a change in the U.S. approach to the status 
of Kashmir, the State Department noted its consistent stand 
since 1947 that the "U.S. believes the entire geographic area of 
the former princely State of Jammu and Kashmir is disputed 
territory." The Administration reiterated its belief that the 
"best way" to resolve the dispute over Kashmir was through 
"direct discussions between the Governments of India and 
Pakistan as envisaged in the Shimla agreement, taking into 
account the wishes of the people of Kashmir." 
  On the question of ascertaining the wishes of the Kashmiri 
people, the administration said: "We do not favour any 
particular procedure, nor do we advocate direct Kashmiri 
participation in bilateral Indo-Pakistani talks. However, to be 
workable, a solution to the Kashmiri dispute will have to take 
into account the wishes of Kashmiris. How this is determined 
would best be established in the negotiation process. 
  "The administration appears to suggest that taking into 
account the wishes of the Kashmiri people is a practical 
necessity and not a commitment to the principal of 
self-determination. But India obviously cannot agree to the 
formulation that this needs to be decided in the Indo-Pakistan 
negotiation process."

<F P=106> [Article: "India, Uzbekistan To Combat Terrorism"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 5. India and Uzbekistan today 
expressed their resolve to counter religious fundamentalism, 
extremism and terrorism and signed six agreements, including one 
on comprehensive economic co-operation aimed at strengthening 
bilateral relations. 
  An Indian bank and cultural centre alongwith an Indian Chair 
in an educational institution will start functioning in 
Uzbekistan shortly, while arrangements were also being made to 
telecast Doordarshan programmes in this Central Asian republic. 
The agreements signed at the conclusion of the Uzbek President's 
visit also covered postal, telegraph and related matters, 
telecommunications, setting up an Indo-Uzbek centre for Science 
and technology, transport and transit. 
  Addressing a joint news conference after signing the 
agreements, the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the 
Uzbekistan President, Mr Islam Karimov, said that there was 
tremendous scope to increase bilateral trade and participate in 
joint ventures to boost economic co-operation between the two 
countries. Both the leaders stressed on building sounder 
relations and reviving the historical relationship that has 
existed between the two countries. 
  In reply to a question on the Kashmir issue, Mr Karimov said 
that his country believed in the principle of non-interference 
in the internal affairs of other states and favoured settlement 
of problems through negotiations. "We intend to strictly follow 
this policy at all international forums," he added. 
  In his opening statement Mr Rao said that during his talks 
with Mr Karimov he had explained India's determination to face 
cross-border terrorism so that people in their countries could 
live in peace and devote their energies to promoting their well 
being. 
  In reply to a question how Uzbekistan was coping with the 
growth of religious fundamentalism, Mr Karimov said the people 
and government of his country had been strongly resisting this 
threat from Tajikistan. "Had it not been so I would not have 
been sitting here today," Mr Karimov remarked. 
  He invited Indian businessmen to visit his country and set 
up 
joint ventures. Mr Karimov pointed out that of the 960 joint 
ventures currently underway in his country a mere 14 were with 
India of which only six were operational. "This is insufficient 
for a great country like India," he said while revealing 
statistics on Uzbekistan's rich mineral resources including 
gold, natural gas and strategic minerals like uranium. 
  Mr Karimov said that his country attached great importance 
to 
the experiences of India as a successful secular democracy. 
"India has been going along the democratic road for development 
while being able to simultaneously preserve its national culture 
and historic traditions. We are presently in a transition period 
and are in the midst of transforming from a totalitarian state 
to a free market economy. Our stress will be on attaining 
self-reliance and preservation of our traditions and ethnic 
identity. But we hope to learn from the experiences of other 
countries who have passed through a similar phase," he pointed 
out.

<F P=106> [Article: "India, UAE Sign Extradition Treaty"; quotation </F>
marks as published] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 6: India and the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE) have made considerable headway on a bilateral 
extradition treaty and other aspects of judicial cooperation. 
  The Indo UAE joint commission, in a pressnote on Thursday, 
said that technical discussions were held between the two sides 
and these would be continued in Abu Dhabi at an early date. The 
seventh meeting of the commission was cochaired by Secretary 
(West) in the External Affairs Ministry K. Srinivasan and 
Director in the Department of Economic Relations and 
International Cooperation of the UAE Foreign Ministry Mohammed 
Khalifa Bin Yousef Al-Suwaidi. 
  Mr Al-Suwaidi, who later called on External Affairs Minister 
Dinesh Singh, conveyed to him that conclusion of an extradition 
treaty would be held in combatting the menace of terrorism. 
  Mr Al-Suwaidi expressed satisfaction at the recommencement 
of 
Indo-Pakistan dialogue and hoped that this would continue with 
patience and flexibility. 
  Mr Dinesh Singh noted that the just concluded three-day 
meeting of the joint commission had taken substantial decisions 
and assured the UAE leader that India would pursue various 
specific initiatives vigorously. 
  Mr Al-Suwaidi said his country was looking forward to Prime 
Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit this year. He also met 
Ministers of State R.L. Bhatia and Salman Khursheed. 
  The joint commission discussed a wide range of issues 
relating to investment, trade, economic and industrial 
cooperation, justice, security, consular and man-power matters 
and interaction in the areas of water resources, power 
generation, agriculture, fisheries, post and telecommunications, 
banking, education and information and media exchanges. 
  An agreement to counter trafficking in narcotic drug and the 
cultural exchange programme for 1994-96 were also signed by the 
two sides. The narcotics agreement, which provides for exchange 
of information and other cooperation between the designated 
agencies of the two sides, is the first which India signed with 
any Arab country. 
  Technical discussions were held and considerable headway was 
made on a bilateral treaty dealing with extradition as well as 
other aspects of judicial cooperation. 
  India will organise an exclusive `India exhibition' in 
Dubayy 
in September this year. In addition visits are planned this year 
by delegations from the Federal Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry [FICCI] of the UAE to India and by delegations from the 
Assocham [Associated Chamber of Commerce] and FICCI to the UAE. 
  The UAE Agriculture Minister is to pay a visit to India this 
year. 
  The eighth meeting of the joint commission, it has been 
decided, would be held in Abu Dhabi in the middle of this year.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "Italy Agrees To Step Up Economic </F>
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 3. Noting similarities in their 
perceptions of global developments, India and Italy today agreed 
to intensify contacts at the highest level of their foreign 
offices. Views were also exchanged on ways to step up economic 
cooperation--now that Italy is to participate in the Indian 
Engineering Trade air in 1995 as a partner country, for the 
second time in ten years. 
  The Foreign Ministers of both the countries, Mr. Dinesh 
Singh 
and Prof. Beniamino Andreatta, now here, held wide-ranging 
discussions, covering bilateral and global issues, apart from 
the developments in their respective regions. Prof. Andreatta 
called on the President, Dr. S.D. Sharma, and met the Finance 
Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh for talks on the specifics of 
economic cooperation. Prof. Andreatta had earlier held economic 
portfolios, as the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning and 
the Minister of Treasury. His visit now is looked upon for a 
deepening of economic relations. In June last year, the first 
Indo-Italian Industrial Forum, held in Venice and inaugurated by 
Dr. Manmohan Singh, was regarded a major success. 
  Measures to solve problems: According to an 
official spokesman, Mr. Dinesh Singh briefed Prof. Andreatta on 
steps taken by India to seek a peaceful solution of its problems 
with Pakistan as also on the outlook of cooperation in South 
Asia within the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional 
Cooperation) framework. They also exchanged views on the 
situation in the Central Asian republics, with Prof. Andreatta 
welcoming India's growing cooperation with these countries as a 
factor of stability. 
  The two Ministers welcomed the recent cooperation agreement 
and the Joint Political statement between Indian and the 
European Union, underlining the desire of the two sides to 
intensify relations in economic and political fields. Also, they 
exchanged views on the reform of the U.N., specially the 
expansion of the Security Council, and the U.N. peace-keeping 
operations, with particular reference to Somalia. 
  India's economic reforms were one of the subjects of 
discussions with Dr. Manmohan Singh who expressed the hope for 
the increased involvement of Italian business and industry in 
the Indian market, taking full advantage of the new 
opportunities for investment and joint ventures. They agreed 
that steps needed to be taken to intensify contacts between 
businessmen and to disseminate information regarding the 
opportunities that had opened up.

<F P=106> [Article by P.S. Suryanarayana: "Efforts To Continue To </F>
Resolve Kashmir Issue"] 
  [Text] Islamabad, Jan. 3. India and Pakistan on Monday 
agreed to make "sincere efforts" to resolve "the Jammu and 
Kashmir problem" in "all aspects," although both sides 
"recognised that there are basic divergences," according to a 
joint statement, issued here at the conclusion of the latest 
round of talks between the Foreign Secretaries. 
  The sentiments expressed implied a polite agreement to keep 
the current process of the bilateral parleys on course without 
actually setting a date for the next round of talks. 
  India had offered to make specific new proposals on the 
Kashmir as well as other issues like Siachen, Wular barrage and 
the Sir Creek estuary. Pakistan expects to receive these new 
ideas from India in about two weeks' time. 
<H5>  Not Linked </H5>
  Pakistan, it is understood, had not linked the Siachen 
question to the Kashmir issue. 
  The Indian Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, said he held 
"a 
preliminary discussion on some suggestions" on the Kashmir issue 
which, according to him, "have to be considered by both sides." 
In his view, it now remains to be seen as to "how we can proceed 
on those suggestions" during future consultations. Mr. Dixit did 
not say what these Indian proposals were. 
  Both Mr. Dixit and his Pakistani counterpart, Mr. Shahryar 
M. 
Khan, stood their ground during the talks here, to uphold the 
vital interests of their countries. But the two sides, in 
accordance with the joint statement, are expected to "consult 
each other on the question of further talks at the Foreign 
Secretary or other level." 
  It was in this context that the two Foreign Secretaries in 
their statement, reiterated "the need to engage in a meaningful 
dialogue with a view to addressing all outstanding problems" in 
the bilateral relationship, including "all aspects of the Jammu 
and Kashmir problem. 
  Mr. Dixit left for Delhi after addressing a press conference 
with Mr. Shahryar Khan, with whom he held four sessions of 
talks, two each on Sunday and Monday, besides protracted 
informal conversations. 
  Answering a question regarding the apparent failure of the 
latest round of talks, Mr. Dixit said: "We (India and Pakistan) 
are (still) in the same position (on Kashmir as at the start of 
these talks). The joint statement says that there are 
divergences. We are dealing with a complex problem. It is not 
necessary that accomplishment should emerge immediately like 
Minerva out of the head of Jupiter." 
  Mr. Dixit explained "the very fact that, after such a long 
gap of time, we met, and (also the fact that) we have addressed 
this specific question of Jammu and Kashmir...is progress 
enough." The two countries, which "have addressed this specific 
question" after a period of many years, now "agreed to find ways 
to move forward to resolve this problem...despite the very 
fundamental differences of opinion about the situation on the 
ground (on both sides of the line of control in Jammu and 
Kashmir)." 
  Mr. Dixit said India's negotiating principle in regard to 
Kashmir and all other Indo-Pakistan issues was to "reason 
together with our friends in Pakistan in the hope and the 
confidence that we shall find some solution even if it takes 
some time." 
  Mr. Shahryar Khan, too, insisted that the fact of India's 
participation in the latest round of talks and, more important, 
its entering into a dialogue with Pakistan over the basic 
Kashmir issue "in great seriousness" should be seen as "a step 
forward," albeit a "small one" in the direction of a new 
equation between the two countries. "In diplomacy, every small 
step counts." 
  The Pakistan Foreign Secretary did not, however, seek to 
discount the "basic divergences" on the Kashmir issue. He said: 
"It is our belief that, at the appropriate time, it is better to 
engage in a dialogue to try and resolve differences than to 
resort to other means." It was in this spirit that Pakistan had 
resumed the Foreign Secretary level talks, he explained in an 
apparent bid to contain the vocal criticism in some quarters 
here that the Benazir administration might be unwittingly 
walking into a parleys trap set by India. 
  Mr. Shahryar Khan also allayed the fears of a possible 
sell-out of the interests of the Kashmiris by asserting that 
"the Kashmiris are central to the resolution of the Kashmir 
issue." And, "at the appropriate time, the (Kashmiri) 
leadership, which has to be recognised (by India and Pakistan) 
should participate in their own destiny," he added. "In what 
manner and at what time" this could be done, he said "needs to 
be discussed in the future." 
  Mr. Dixit intervened to say that he had now conveyed to Mr. 
Shahryar Khan a policy statement that was recently made by the 
Home Minister of India to affirm that Delhi would, "for (the 
purpose of) any political solution, take into confidence all the 
people of Jammu and Kashmir." He declined to give details. 
  It was also evident at the joint process conference that 
noticeable differences over the relevance of the old United 
Nations resolutions on Kashmir came into sharp focus during the 
talks here. Mr. Dixit said the "irrelevance" of these 
resolutions had been repeatedly emphasised by India. Mr. 
Shahryar Khan, on the other hand, said the U.N. resolution could 
not, in any sense, be regarded as having "withered on vine." 
  On the issue of human rights Mr. Khan said the resolution 
planned to be moved at a U.N. forum sometime ago had only been 
shelved and that Pakistan still reserved the right to revive it 
in some form or other. 
  Asked about the pre-conditions for dialogue that the 
Pakistan 
Foreign Minister, Mr. Assef Ali, had reportedly set when the 
Indian High Commissioner, Mr. S.K. Lambah, supposedly met him, 
recently, Mr. Dixit said he was told of such conditions when he 
himself called on Mr. Assef Ali today. Mr. Dixit clarified that 
Mr. Lambah had not in fact met Mr. Assef Ali. 
  Mr. Dixit outlined Delhi's stand that any talks aimed at 
settling "a really complex and an almost intractable problem" 
like that relating to Kashmir could only be held "without 
pre-conditions." 
  Mr. Shahryar Khan, who spoke to the international media for 
a 
second time on Monday, soon after seeing Mr. Dixit off, said 
"the situation on the ground will be the determinant of our 
(Pakistani) attitude to the question of resuming talks" with 
India. 
  Outlining a host of issues which would influence the 
thinking 
of Pakistan, Mr. Khan said Islamabad had already asked Delhi to 
release the political prisoners in Kashmir, to allow the 
international media as well as diplomats "a free and unfettered" 
movement across Jammu and Kashmir and to reduce the number of 
additional troops that India had recently deployed in the State. 
The Hazratbal issue, as also the continuing "repression" in that 
State, were causing unmitigated concern to Pakistan, he added. 
  As for Pakistan's role in terrorist-subversive activities in 
Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Khan said Islamabad would accept a 
mechanism of neutral international observers to monitor the 
alleged cross-border forays from Pakistan. In a related move, 
Pakistan would be willing to allow monitoring in 
Pakistan-occupied Kashmir too. 
  These issues would not, however, cloud the fact that 
Pakistan 
"regards the talks as a precedent for the future discussions on 
Jammu and Kashmir," Mr. Shahryar Khan said. 
<H5>  PTI reports: </H5>
  Mr. Dixit returned to New Delhi tonight. He is expected to 
brief the Prime Minister tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Article: "India Warns Pak"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 4: India on Tuesday "cautioned" 
Pakistan that it might delay sending its proposals to resolve 
six bilateral problems in case Islamabad linked the continuation 
of bilateral dialogue to a change in New Delhi's stand on the 
Kashmir issue. 
  According to the Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, a 
stalemate persisted on the Kashmir issue during his talks which 
concluded in Islamabad on Monday. 
  India does not look at the Indo-Pakistan relations through 
"one prism" of Kashmir issue, though Pakistan considers Kashmir 
as the "core issue." India is committed to continuing peace 
process without any preconditions for resolution of all 
bilateral disputes between India and Pakistan, since 
geographically the two countries will have to live together as 
neighbours. 
  This was the approach which India adopted at the seventh 
round of India-Pakistan Foreign Secretary--level talks that 
concluded on Monday in Islamabad, according to Mr. Dixit, who 
led the Indian delegation to the talks, at a 45-minute press 
conference here on Tuesday. 
  Conceding that there were basic differences on the Kashmir 
issue, Mr. Dixit stated that there were issues like Siachen, 
stabilisation of situation along the Line of Control, measures 
of confidence building problems of nuclear and conventional arms 
proliferation, maritime boundary, issues of economic 
cooperation, all these issues were to be tackled for mutual 
benefit. India offered to prepare a position paper covering all 
these issues which would be considered at the next round of the 
Foreign Secretary-level meet. 
  India suggested that the eighth round of the Foreign 
Secretary-level meet to take place within a period of four 
months. But Pakistan preferred to keep it "open-dated" and dates 
to be dependent on "visible Indian response on ground." 
  The position paper would also be presented to Pakistan also 
on the basis of "realities on ground," Mr. Dixit said. Thus this 
also has become "open-dated." 
  The position paper would deal with demarcation of boundary 
in 
Sir Creek area, deployment in Siachen area. 
  Mr. Dixit said that India did not and would not give up 
"peaceful process" for resolution of all outstanding problems 
between the two countries and would continue to pursue that 
process.

<F P=106> [Article by C. Raja Mohan: "U.S. Offers To Push Indo-Pak </F>
Talks"; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Washington, Jan. 5. The United States will continue 
to prod India and Pakistan to work at resolving various issues 
that bedevil mutual relations, according to sources in the 
Clinton administration. They see the just concluded round of 
dialogue in Islamabad as a useful first step in a process with 
significant potential. 
  The sources are not surprised at the testy nature of the 
dialogue and its tentative outcome insisting that only India and 
Pakistan can resolve their differences, the administration 
expressed its readiness to help facilitate a forward movement in 
the dialogue. 
  In a separate written response to reporters, the State 
department yesterday declared its "strong support" for the 
resumption of talks at the level of Foreign Secretaries. The 
administration has for some time been pressing both countries to 
resume the "high-level" dialogue that last took place in August 
1992. Although Washington did not publicly take credit for the 
resumption, the American pressure apparently was a key factor in 
the renewal of the Indo-Pakistani dialogue. 
  The State department welcomed the "agreement in principle" 
reached in Islamabad to continue the talks at the `Foreign 
Secretary or other levels.' The administration hopes that 
`further talks can take place soon.' 
  The State department said, "We agree that a meaningful 
dialogue is needed to peacefully resolve the issues between 
India and Pakistan. To that end, we encourage both parties to 
approach the entire range of issues constructively with the aim 
of achieving tangible agreements leading to reduced tensions." 
  To another written question on the U.S. mediatory role, it 
declared that "we do not see ourselves in a mediator's role." 
However, "the U.S. is willing to assist India and Pakistan to 
reach and implement agreements if they both so desire." 
  Dialogue on Kashmir: The written response made no 
direct mention of the Kashmir dispute. But sources in the 
administration referred to its complex nature and the difficulty 
both India and Pakistan face in making hard political and 
psychological adjustments to their traditional diplomatic 
posture on Kashmir. 
  The sources also believe that the process of the dialogue on 
Kashmir should be seen as being productive by the people in the 
valley. India needs to go beyond the small steps it has taken on 
the human rights front, and initiate a genuine political process 
in the troubled State. The sources regret that despite much talk 
about a political initiative, New Delhi is yet to set in motion 
a new process in the valley. They also note that the 
Indo-Pakistan dialogue on Kashmir would be a long slog. 
  Questioned on the basic tension between the Pakistani 
approach to emphasising the resolution of the core issue -- 
Kashmir -- and the Indian call for progress on a broad front of 
bilateral relations, the sources suggest that this may not be 
unique to the sub-continent. They point to West Asia, where 
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation have made 
substantial progress in resolving their bilateral conflict, 
sidestepping the so-called core issues like the status of 
Jerusalem. This pragmatic, and typically American, approach to 
problem-solving is widely shared in Washington. 
  Dr. Mitchell Riess, a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Centre, 
suggested that progress on other issues should not be held 
hostage to the resolution of the Kashmir dispute. Noting that an 
agreement on Siachen is at hand, Dr. Riess pointed out that 
movement on resolving smaller issues could generate a political 
momentum and the right diplomatic ambience to address the larger 
issues. "Solve what you can and keep talking." 
  Welcoming the resumption of the dialogue, Dr. Michael 
Krepon, 
director of the Henry L. Stimson Centre which has in recent 
years taken consistent interest in Indo-Pakistani 
confidence-building, noted that several impediments to conflict 
resolution and confidence-building measures in the Sub-continent 
had been removed. The positive results of the latest elections 
in Pakistan and India, he believes, may have paved the way for a 
sober approach to problem solving in the Indian sub-continent. 
  Dr. Krepon is apprehensive that without a political 
initiative at the highest level it may not be possible to 
realise the full potential of the Indo-Pakistani dialogue. But 
sources in the administration note the constraints on the 
leadership in both the countries imposed by the partisan 
rhetoric and their political opponents. They refer to the 
enormous concrete work that needs to be done in New Delhi and 
Islamabad to push the dialogue forward. 
  In one important Pakistani response available here, Mr. 
Abdus 
Sattar, who recently served as the Foreign Minister of that 
country, wished that the Islamabad talks had resulted in a more 
tangible progress. Mr. Sattar, currently a distinguished fellow 
at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, was earlier the 
Foreign Secretary of Pakistan and posted twice as High 
Commissioner to India. Mr. Sattar lamented that while there was 
an incredible movement in conflict resolution in South Africa, 
West Asia and northern Ireland, India and Pakistan had lagged 
behind. 
  Interestingly, the recent dialogue has attracted little 
attention in the U.S. media. The written response of the State 
department came only when the spokesman, who had no prepared 
answer, was questioned by the reporters from the sub-continent. 
For all anxieties in India and hopes in Pakistan about an 
American role in Kashmir, the issue barely figurtes in the 
foreign policy discourse in Washington. Only the few South Asia 
hands inside the State department and outside in this town 
appear concerned about the future of Kashmir or Indo-Pakistani 
relations. 
<H5>  Raphael Comments `Unfortunate' </H5>
<H5>  PTI reports from New York </H5>
  Mr. Gary Ackerman, Chairman of the U.S. House subcommittee 
on 
South Asia and Pacific Affairs, has described as "very 
unfortunate" and "regrettable" the remarks by Ms. Robin Raphael, 
Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, questioning the 
legality of the accession of Kashmir to India. "I think it does 
not indicate any shift or change whatsoever in the official U.S. 
policy." 
  Asked about Pakistani-trained militants indulging in 
terrorism in Kashmir, he said terrorism anywhere was of great 
concern to humanity. "There are problems in Kashmir. There are 
those who foment trouble. There are always those who commit 
terrorist acts. It is time when Governments should exercise 
their legitimate rights to maintain order." 
  In this connection, Mr. Ackerman stressed the need for 
"appropriate handling" of the cases of excesses that the 
security forces sometime committed while handling terrorism. 
  On human rights, he was `very happy' to see that the 
situation in India was improving all the time. Replying to a 
question, he said India's nuclear programme so far "seems to be 
fairly responsible." But India must sign the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty and open facilities to inspection. He 
would like to see New Delhi open up the process completely and 
be a member in good standing of the treaty. 
  The U.S. had same concerns with India as with other nations 
whether friendly or not. "We have the same concern with China on 
a larger scale and everywhere there is nuclear (weapon) 
potential or nuclear capability." "We have a terrible problem 
with China's nuclear programme. We have a terrible problem with 
North Korea and the Ukraine."

<F P=106> [Article: "PM Warns Against Attempts To Deny Technology to </F>
India"; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Jaipur, Jan. 3 (PTI &amp; UNI): The Prime Minister, 
Mr 
P.V. Narasimha Rao, today warned against attempts to deny 
certain technologies to India even in the post-GATT (General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) period marked by liberalisation 
of trade in goods and services. 
  "It is a kind of protectionism built into liberalisation... 
An attempt will be there to withhold a technology from a country 
like India due to apprehensions that it would become powerful 
and progressive," Mr Rao said inaugurating the 81st session of 
the Indian Science Congress. 
  Expressing confidence that the country would come out of 
such 
a situation, he foresaw a rapid expansion in the research and 
development field. He appealed to science and technology 
personnel to help the country in exploiting the vast export 
opportunities offered by the post-GATT period. 
  The Prime Minister said India, with its vast reservoir of 
science and technology personnel and comparatively lower 
manpower costs, was fully capable of meeting the export 
challenges thrown open in the post--GATT liberalised environment. 
  GATT ensured further opening up of national economies and 
Indian science and technology personnel and industry leaders 
would have an enlarged arena to play their part in this new 
situation, he said. 
  Allaying fears expressed by some scientists and certain 
sectors of trade that indigenous research and development might 
be jeopardised by the recently concluded GATT negotiations, Mr 
Rao said India could, in fact, clearly delineate areas of 
significant opportunities in textiles and clothing, agriculture, 
trade related intellectual property rights, and services. 
  Science and technology and research and development would be 
of paramount importance in the post-GATT liberalised 
environment, he said. In the new scenario, there was a large 
scope for cross-border investments and the spread of research 
and development across the national boundaries, he said. 
  India must be prepared to profit from this situation as 
research and development costs in India vary greatly from the 
costs abroad, he noted. 
  The Prime Minister said India could launch joint research 
and 
development projects with other countries. It could do so 
because of high science and technology calibre in a wide 
spectrum of fields, substantial research and development 
infrastructure, extensive test facilities of world standard, 
language skills and worldwide presence of Indian scientists, he 
added. 
  Earlier, the Prime Minister presented the Asutosh Mukherjee 
Memorial Award for 1993 to Dr A.S. Paintal, C.V. Raman Birth 
Centenary Award to Dr M.S. Narasimha, Srinivasa Ramanujan Birth 
Centenary Award to Prof. B.P. Bambah, M.N. Saha Birth Centenary 
Award to Dr Hari Narain, P.V. Mahanalobis Birth Centenary Award 
to Prof. P.V. Sukhatme, J.C. Bose Memorial Award to Prof. A.K. 
Sharma, P.C. Ray Memorial Award to Prof. C.N.R. Rao and Prof. 
Hira Lal Chakaravarty Award to Dr K.C. Bansal and Dr S.L. 
Kothari. 
  Rajasthan Governor Bali Ram Bhagat released a souvenir and 
Chief Minister Bhairon Singh Shekhawat released a book titled 
`Indian Science-A Selected Bibliography' on the 
occasion.

<F P=106> [Article: "Anti-Dunkel Protests Greet Rao"] </F>
  [Text] Hyderabad, Jan. 7. The Andhra Pradesh Government 
faced acute embarrassment as the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao was greeted by hostile demonstrations almost 
everywhere he went during a day long tour of his Nandyal 
constituency on Thursday. 
  Perhaps, it was the for the first time that the motorcade of 
a Prime Minister was forced to retreat when a 200-strong defiant 
mob of extremists blocked his way, taking the strong posse of 
police by surprise. The incident occurred near the Municipal 
office in Nandyal as the Prime Minister was proceeding to 
address a public meeting. 
  These anti-Dunkel demonstrators, undeterred by the 
lathicharge, chased the Prime Minister's convoy as it was 
retreating to a guest house. The incident forced postponement of 
the public meeting by two and half hours and a worried Chief 
Minister, M. K. Vijayabhaskara Reddy tendered an apology for the 
security lapse. 
  The day's schedule of the Prime Minister began on an unhappy 
note with a group of villagers waving black flags at Mr. Rao's 
first public meeting at Atmakur, demanding lift irrigation 
schemes from Srisailam main canal. Atmakur area is the centre of 
extremist activity in Kurnool district. 
  Demonstration by women: Yet another show of protest under 
the 
very nose of the police was one led by Ms Sandhya of Progressive 
Organisation of Women who contested against the Chief Minister 
in Panyam Assembly constituency. She organised a group of women, 
flaunting empty pitchers near the R &amp; B Guest House where the 
Prime Minister was staying, demanding drinking water for Nandyal 
town. 
  This was followed by a noisy demonstration by Rayalaseema 
Paper Mills Staff and Workers Union while Mr. Rao was 
inaugurating a flyover on the town outskirts. Angry at the Prime 
Minister turning a deaf ear to their demand for reopening of the 
sick mill, the workers went on a rampage in the town, burning 
Congress(I) flags, pulling down arches and banners and damaging 
the vehicles en route. About 3,000 men and women marched towards 
the venue of the public meeting but were chased away by the 
police. This incident too caught the district administration off 
guard because a CITU (Center of Indian Trade Unions) delegation 
led by Mr. N. Prasada Rao, its State Secretary, was allowed to 
meet the Prime Minister. 
  Bullet proof enclosure: In response to these demonstrations, 
the Prime Minister explained the Government's stand on Dunkel 
proposals but did not refer to either the water scarcity in 
Nandyal or the paper mill workers' demands. For the first time 
in Nandyal constituency, Mr. Rao addressed public meetings, 
standing behind a bullet proof glass enclosure. 
  Specific questions relating to the needs of Nandyal 
constituency dominated the press conference that Mr. Rao 
addressed at the guest house but his replies were vague. He 
expressed happiness over the pace of developmental activities in 
his constituency during the 25 months since his election but 
refused to draw comparisons with Amethi, represented by late 
Rajiv Gandhi. The press meet was a brief seven-minute affair. 
  Water schemes launched: Mr. Narasimha Rao's fifth visit to 
his constituency was marked by the launching of two protected 
drinking water schemes involving an investment of Rs.[rupees]3.5 
crores and benefiting 31 villages, seven lift irrigation schemes 
costing Rs. 1.30 crores, inauguration of a Scheduled Caste 
housing colony and a Rs. 4.81-crore road bridge in Nandyal. He 
also declared open a low power TV transmitter at Atmakur, the 
only Assembly segment in his constituency, which did not have 
this facility. 
  The Government media managers took pains to project the 
progress in the constituency and circulated brochures 
highlighting development activities at the press conference. But 
the spate of demonstrations and the memoranda submitted to the 
Prime Minister indicate that the expectations aroused in the 
wake of his election still persist.

<F P=106> [Article by Ashwani Kumar: "Open Fight Between Jayalalitha, </F>
Reddy"] 
  [Text] The row between Jayalalitha and governor Channa 
Reddy in Tamil Nadu has come out in the open now. The Congress 
(I) leaders have accused Chief Minister Jayalalitha of being a 
rebel and a dictator, while her supporters have accused Governor 
Reddy to running a parallel government in the state. 
  Chief Minister Jayalalitha started a new dispute recently. 
This fight will now not limited to Tamil Nadu; it will effect 
other states also. Governor Reddy is also playing a role in this 
dispute, however, this is the first time that the governors are 
feeling that chief ministers may try to undermine their 
authority. 
  According to tradition, the governor of a state is the 
ex-officio chancellor of the state university, and he has the 
right to appoint chancellors and deputy chancellors to the 
university. He also presides over the university's graduation 
ceremonies. A while back, when the position of chancellor at 
Madras University was vacated, names of three persons were sent 
to Governor Channa Reddy. Mr. Reddy rejected the three names. 
Chief Minister Jayalalitha made this minor incident a case of 
prestige and dispute and presented a controversial legislation 
in the vidhan sabha. This legislation asks for transferring the 
rights as the chancellor from the governor to the chief 
minister. It is important to mention here that the prime 
minister and not the governor will be the ex-officio chancellor 
according to the proposed legislation, and vice chancellors of 
the 13 universities in the state would be appointed by the chief 
minister on recommendation by a three-member committee. One of 
the three members would be appointed by the chief minister as 
the ex-officio chancellor. The state education minister would be 
the vice chancellor of nine of the state universities. The 
health minister would be the vice chancellor of the state 
medical college, and the agricultural minister and the animal 
husbandry minister will be the vice chancellors of the 
agricultural college and veterinary science college 
respectively. Thus, to avenge the rejection of the names 
proposed by her, Jayalalitha is trying to change the 
Constitution. 
  It is a well-known fact that the dispute between the two 
started the day Dr. Channa Reddy arrived in Tamil Nadu as the 
governor. Although the governor is a senior Congress (I) leader, 
Ms. Jayalalitha is very apprehensive of him. Chief Minister 
Jayalalitha was not worried while she worked with the former 
Tamil Nadu governor, Bhisham Narayan Singh. At this time, 
Jayalalitha's star in Tamil Nadu politics is on the rise. Both 
opposition parties in Tamil Nadu are in bad shape. The Pradesh 
Congress (I) is weak because of the internal strife in it, and 
DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam], her major opponent party, has 
also split in to two factions. The Congress (I) and DMK are so 
weak in Tamil Nadu that they are trying to save their existence. 
As the result of all these developments, Jayalalitha and her 
party have become stronger than ever. 
  However, by starting this fight with Dr. Channa Reddy, 
Jayalalitha has initiated a new dispute. Recently, a 
representative of Jayalalitha had accused Governor Reddy in 
Delhi of running a parallel government in the state. She accused 
that Dr. Reddy had taken steps to question various decisions 
made by the elected ADMK [Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] 
government. He is also accused of delaying the session of the 
vidhan sabha for two months. He had called the vidhan sabha only 
after the state had the prime minister and the president 
interfere. The governor delayed a file requesting extension of 
the chief secretary's appointment, and instigated the 
Jayalalitha government by rejecting the proposed names for the 
position of vice chancellors. She further accused him of 
breaking rules by establishing a relief fund for the Maharashtra 
earthquake victims. A traditional relief fund under the chief 
minister is already there. 
  Meanwhile the Tamil Nadu Congress (I) Committee has accused 
Jayalalitha of treason and has demanded her dismissal. Mr. K. 
Ramamurthy, the state Congress (I) president, says that the ADMK 
government is acting as if Tamil Nadu was a separate island and 
not a part of the Indian Union. He said that the government was 
trying hard to insult the position of the governor. He also said 
that the governor's photograph was deliberately removed from the 
state vidhan sabha diary. This is the first time when the state 
Congress (I) president has openly demanded dismissal of 
Jayalalitha's government. Jayalalitha is suffering all these 
problems because of her support for the no-confidence motion in 
the Lok Sabha against the prime minister last year. However, the 
situation of Tamil Nadu's Congress (I) Party and the DMK party 
is very weak. There is no political power in Tamil Nadu to 
challenge Jayalalitha until the next election.

<F P=106> [Chandra Shekhar interviewed by Ram Bahadur Ray: "Using </F>
Religion as a Support Is Not the Only Danger, So Is Using 
Casteism"; place and date not given] 
<H5>  [21 Jan pp 1, 10] </H5>
  [Text] Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar talks 
openly, rising above the party politics and election benefits 
level. When talking about national issues, his openness has hurt 
him in his political life. Be it the issue of the emergency, 
Punjab, Ram Janambhumi-Babri Masjid, or Mandal, Chandra 
Shekhar's opinion was always different and far from the beaten 
path. During the emergency, even though he was in the Congress 
Party, he supported JP [Jay Prakash Narayan]. On the issue of 
swadeshi, he did not hesitate in supporting the RSS [Rashtriya 
Swayamsevak Sangh]. He is as worried about the religious 
politics of the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] as he is about 
Kanshi Ram and Mulayam Singh Yadav's caste politics. We are 
giving excerpts from an interview on political and social issues 
with Ram Bahadur recently. 
  [Question] Before the election, you announced that both the 
Congress and the BJP are dangerous to the nation. Regardless of 
which one wins, in your opinion, what is the danger now? Do you 
see a third danger? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] The results of this election have given us 
two kinds of hints. One is that the danger of the BJP has been 
pushed back some. But this danger is not totally gone. The BJP 
defeat in Uttar Pradesh [UP] is being given too much importance; 
however, the narrow slogans that it used to win the elections of 
the past were stolen by the people who defeated it. As dangerous 
as using religion in politics to win a government is, 
encouraging caste feelings for this purpose is no less 
dangerous. Narrow politics always takes us into blind alleys. I 
do not want the situation to become any worse; however, the 
preliminary indicators tell us that the situation is taking a 
dangerous turn. Another thing is that if regional political 
parties form governments in different places, then the unity of 
our nation will be jeopardized. I believe that regional parties 
should come into power in the federal system of a government. 
However, the indecisiveness of the central government about 
these challenges worries me. The recent elections have made it 
clear that the power of regional parties will continue to 
increase. At the same time, it is clear that the present 
government at the Center cannot make a clear decision in any 
difficult situation. Running a country and running a government 
are two very different things. Our present prime minister is 
expert in running the government; however, it is clear that he 
lacks the ability to make decisions in running the country. 
  If the Congress Party breaks up, then there will be a danger 
similar to the emergence of regional parties. I am not a 
supporter of the Congress Party; however, disintegration of the 
Congress Party will directly benefit the BJP at the national 
level. It is true that the danger from the BJP will come after 
some time. However, in a country like India, with so much 
diversity, the BJP will be unable to maintain unity. Gaining 
power through the use of blind religious feelings will make a 
party autocratic. It is impossible to run this country through 
an autocratic system. It has not happened in the past, nor will 
it happen in the future. 
  As for the third power, I have tried for it. But the people 
who were so eager for unity suddenly retreated. This makes clear 
one more aspect: that we consider politics only as a timely 
success. Politics is a long-range pursuit. It is a kind of 
hard work in which a person, after failing many times, gives a 
new message and strength to the future generations. But the 
present leaders consider it only as an ideal. They say that only 
unsuccessful and failed people talk like that. The results of 
the recent elections clearly indicate that many leaders lose 
everything with one bump. The people who, until yesterday, 
claimed to write a new history are seeing their castles of hope 
destroyed like a house of cards. If they do not have enough 
power to even oppose consistently, then they cannot talk about 
writing history. They cannot even take a preliminary step in 
politics. 
  [Question] If we forget the caste equation from the recent 
U.P. election results, will the major part played by the 
backward people there strengthen Indian democracy? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] I would be happy if this happened now. But 
judging from some incidents in Uttar Pradesh, it is clear that 
this will not happen. The slogans that were used for uniting the 
backward groups could result in a caste struggle because of 
voices raised by the higher-caste people. In this struggle, only 
the poor will suffer. It is important to pay attention to the 
fact that the slogans used to get the support of the poor can 
arouse some special emotions. If emotions are aroused on caste 
hatred and not on the rich and poor equation, then it would not 
be very difficult to change this to an economic war. We are 
successful in efforts for which we try hard. The question of a 
revolution is a separate one. I believe that we are looking at 
this problem within the framework of parliamentary democracy, 
and therefore, we do not see any danger here. It is easy to 
arouse emotions, but it is hard to direct them for productive 
work. This is clear from our political experience over the last 
few hundred years. 
  [Question] Keeping in mind the character of the middle class 
during the last 50 years, or the kind of people that have been 
becoming the leaders in government, do you consider them the 
reason for their failure to keep their promises? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] The kind of society we create will result 
in the same kind of people emerging into our social, political, 
and economic life. Therefore, what is important is the kind of 
society we create. The leaders in various regions are surrounded 
by their narrow spheres. We have spread the limits around 
ourselves. We have to start this work somewhere. I believe that 
beginnings should take place where decisions about India's 
future are made. 
  There are two great qualities that our country has. First, 
our people are not ignorant. If we disregard religious history 
and tradition, we will find that the people are very flexible 
about creating a society. If we explain to them the interests 
and negative aspects of our country, then they accept our 
argument after some hesitation--that is, if those who understand 
it realize these facts during their lifetime. The sadhus and 
saints get thousands of disciples. Some of these are of bad 
character; however, that is our country's greatest strength. 
This has been our tradition for thousands of years. We have to 
give the right direction to this strength, so that it benefits 
our country. The second quality is that we have the tendency to 
be satisfied with very little. In no other country are laborers 
willing to work so hard for so little as in India. They have to 
understand that their hard work will benefit the children of the 
future. However, we could not use both these qualities. Neither 
did we present examples to the people, nor could we give the 
right direction to our country's energy and its inherent 
strengths.

  [Text] Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar is not 
disappointed, even in this disheartening atmosphere. He feels 
that our country is in the process of change. This period, 
instead of disappointing him like it does other people, also 
gives him hope. He has faith in the inherent powers of the 
Indian society. The government has opened the door to world 
powers to let them play openly here. Still, the society will 
rise against the new challenges. This is the second part of 
Chandra Shekhar's talk with Ram Bahadur Rai. 
  [Question] Those who lead India during this time of change 
do 
not care about long-range results. Do not you think that this is 
a period of change for our country? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] I believe it is a period of change. I also 
believe that some people are trying to give a specific direction 
to history, which is not permanent. However, we cannot isolate 
ourselves to make a decision, because the world has become very 
complex. Other countries are trying to influence our political 
character. In this context, we remember Mrs. Indira Gandhi. You 
are aware that I strongly criticized her policies, but she 
should be praised for two things. First, she did not tolerate 
even the slightest interference of another country in our 
national politics. Second, she did not allow the Center to 
become weak. It has become clear during the last few years that 
our prime ministers have failed on both these fronts. It is also 
clear that in any country where foreign interference was 
increased in internal politics, the government could not be 
saved. It has not been long since the Soviet Union fell. Not 
only did the government fall there, but the people also lost 
their prestige, glory, and self-respect. 
  [Question] Do you mean that regional politics will cause 
foreign interference, and that this will cause the fall of our 
nation? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] It is imperative to encourage regional 
politics in order to increase foreign interference. All this 
will not happen suddenly. These tendencies have been encouraged 
over the last few years. They were encouraged to flourish in 
various ways. Now, with all the variance here, with people 
living in luxury on one side and a society living in poverty on 
the other, it is difficult to feel the pulse of the society with 
only one slogan. In such a time, the government's role becomes 
very important. Our constitution was written with all this in 
mind. 
  The efforts made to encourage regional powers during the 
last 
few years are not hidden from anyone. Many people in the Indian 
government know this well. Buta Singh, home minister during 
Rajiv Gandhi's government, told me many things as the home 
minister. I cannot share those with you without his permission. 
I did not say anything at that time, because that would have 
weakened the central government, and would only have encouraged 
those elements that were giving importance to such tendencies. 
  [Question] The truth is that we have a society with open 
democratic values inherent in it. The social inequities are part 
of it. We have opened all kinds of doors to the world. This is 
giving an opportunity to all world powers to interfere in our 
internal affairs. Those powers are inciting our people's 
desires, and are taking advantage of them. There are some 
dangerous signs. No other country has ever opened itself to our 
side interference like we have during the period of infancy of 
democracy that we are in. You are talking about the inherent 
powers of the Indian society. But what will the opposing forces 
in our society do to confront these developments? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] I have visited many universities over the 
last few days. I feel that our youth are very much aware of 
this. They understand the problems in our country. They have the 
courage to understand and solve these difficult problems and the 
situation. I have seen the appropriate feelings among them. 
Unfortunately, the real issues are not being brought into focus. 
We are neither bringing these issues to the people, nor are we 
talking about them at their level. These questions are not 
discussed in Parliament or in the media. These are the platforms 
on which the youth are educated about the legislatures. I am 
sure that the time will come when the people will realize the 
dangerous results and rise up in opposition. Today's situation 
is not as disappointing as that of the 1920s, when Gandhi was 
towering over the Indian political horizon. Even in that 
disappointing situation, a new power emerged that had risen to 
protect the nation's pride and respect. When the people feel 
that the pride and glory of our nation is in danger, then they 
will react strongly. The people will not remain silent. The 
binds of caste and religion will be broken then. This is our 
only hope. This process can be accelerated and made effective. 
All we need is to do something about it. If we try, then this 
process of opposition will start soon. The people will rise up 
against this opportunist tendency in our Indian politics. 
  [Question] Do you see any time lines? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] This work is done through the inherent 
power of the people. No one can say how much time it will take. 
For example, look at 1975. When an emergency rule was imposed on 
the country, the people outside said that democracy had been 
ended in India for good. Elections, however, were announced in 
1977, when the emergency was still in force. At that time, many 
leaders were still in jail. Except for two or three persons, 
everyone thought that they would not take part in the elections. 
No one wanted to run against Indira Gandhi. They felt that the 
election would not be free and unbiased. The Jan Sangh, 
Samajwadis, and many other parties even passed resolutions about 
it, and issued important statements. I do not want to take the 
credit that only two or three people, including Morarji Desai 
and I, believed that people would finally run for election. When 
elections were announced, a reaction surfaced within one week. 
The more serious the problem, the faster and more powerful the 
reaction. A time will come when the people will say that they 
will not go with the politics of slogans. They will demand the 
politics of real and basic issues. 
  [Question] You have said correctly that people were hurt 
during the emergency. That was one reason for their rising. 
However, the hunger for self-respect of the backward classes is 
hidden behind the caste slogans. Their efforts to come into 
government is an expression of their self-respect. For what 
reason could they believe that some people are cashing in on 
their hunger for self-respect, using some slogans about castes? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] This is a very sensitive question. Our 
caste system is very complex. No caste or group of castes can 
unite everyone using the slogan of self-respect. Let us look at 
the SP-BSP [Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party] government in 
Uttar Pradesh. The struggles that started soon after its 
emergence were between the higher and lower castes. It also 
started between the lower castes and the Dalits. Thus, slogans 
about castes have a hole in them for uniting everyone. 
  [Question] You are talking about a struggle in the people's 
everyday life. The politics of elections gives them the 
opportunity to express their feelings about castes. Can the 
contradictions of daily life get their political echo? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] Let us look at it with a liberal point of 
view. People do not live on caste slogans. They are tired of 
such a voting system. Let us look at the other forces that were 
in the arena of elections. One was the BJP, which floated all 
kinds of communal slogans. Let us look at the party within the 
Janata Dal of which I was the member. We also raised the same 
one-sided slogans. We kept kicking social justice again and 
again. We did not focus on industrial policy, economic policy, 
and unemployment. When, in an opportunist type of politics, 
there is an open competition, the people will lean toward the 
louder slogans. I have told some of my BJP friends that if they 
can use slogans of dividing people over religion, then in some 
regions and at some other time, the slogans of caste could be 
more effective. In an election, everyone is competing in raising 
slogans. In this situation, the poor people had only one option: 
to pick the louder slogan. 
  [Question] Did animal feelings erupt in this competitive 
situation? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] This time around, in this political 
opportunist atmosphere, the vote went to animal feelings. I will 
not say that I was the first in this area; however, these 
slogans will not remove illiteracy, unemployment, and hunger. 
Let us think: Imagine you are a Dalit, you are enjoying all the 
luxuries of life, and economic prosperity. On the other side is 
a high-caste person who is dying of hunger. Now, who is getting 
privileges and benefits? Since you are enjoying all the 
luxuries, cannot we say that you are getting unique treatment? 
  [Question] At one time, you said that the youth, the RSS, 
and 
the bureaucracy are the three institutions on which the country 
can depend. What is your opinion of these three now? 
  Let us talk about the bureaucracy first. My opinion about it 
has been clear from the beginning. In 1971, a Yugoslavian 
professor came to see me. He asked me about our bureaucracy. I 
told him that the bureaucracy in our country is the best in the 
world. He was surprised; however, he also felt the same. He said 
that over 10 million refugees had come to India from Bangladesh, 
and an equal number had gone back. All this was done very 
efficiently by our administrative service officers within six 
weeks. He had just returned from there. He told me that no other 
leader had said this about our bureaucracy. When I was in the 
government for six months, I did not have any experience to 
indicate that these people delay cases. After all, there are 
always one or two persons everywhere who make problems. Before 
we get their opinion, we should consider two things. First, we 
must let them know that we cannot punish them for what they are 
saying. Second, we should not made decisions before even asking 
their advice on it. We have to assure them that if we have 
ignored any opinion, then it will not be considered their crime. 
If we pay attention to this, I do not think there would be a 
better bureaucracy than we have. I am very proud of the 
achievement of our bureaucracy in some difficult situations. 
  As for the youth's power here, everyone says that after 
independence, our youths lost the patriotism and ability to make 
sacrifices they once had. They are moving toward a life of 
comfort. They cannot follow ideals in a crisis. But I believe 
differently. Between 1947 and 1993, we saw a number of youth 
sacrificing themselves for their ideals. Their number is greater 
than what we had during our struggle for independence. We may 
not agree with their talk or their viewpoints; their path may be 
very different than ours. But this does not mean that their 
inherent ability is any less. Many people were killed in the 
Naxalite rebellion. How many people were killed in the uprisings 
in Punjab and Kashmir? Many of them may have been deceived by 
others; however, we have to understand one thing. They were 
sacrificing their lives for other people. It does not matter how 
much one may curse me about it. We just cannot ignore their 
inner feelings and energy. 
  I am opposed to the way the RSS thinks, but some of the 
ideas 
this organization has--for example, the nationalism and swadeshi 
issues--are things they will always follow. I do not agree with 
their definition of nationalism, but if the country needs 
anything, they will never hesitate to do it for the nation. 
There is a small faction within the RSS that does not think that 
becoming an MP [member of Parliament] or an MLA [member 
Legislative Assembly] is necessary. During our struggle for 
independence, there was a group which sewed hand-spun cotton all 
its life, or spent its life herding cows or working with the 
Harijans. Similarly, there is a group within the RSS that will 
always raise its voice on these questions. I have criticized the 
RSS a lot, and it does have many flaws. However, wherever there 
is power in our society, we cannot ignore it. In this critical 
situation, we are not using all of nation's energy to protect 
our society. Therefore, I have to say that it will be the RSS 
that will become a problem for the BJP in the future. Advani or 
Atal Behari Bajpayee can openly support the present economic 
policies. But a man like Murli Manohar Joshi can still shut them 
up over the swadeshi issue because of the RSS policies. The joy 
with which Mr. Advani during his travel in the United States 
supported the economic policy was emulated by Atal Behari 
Bajpayee, when he said that should Narasimha Rao resign and he 
were to form government, he would follow the same policies. The 
RSS people are traveling around the country and propagating the 
kinds of policies put forth by Bala Sahab Deoras and Murli 
Manohar Joshi. While I disagree with other policies of the 
RSS, you cannot ignore their effort to bring feelings of 
swadeshi to every person in the country. If you ignore it, then 
you are not using the power of our people appropriately. This is 
the main support system in a democracy, and it is necessary for 
any national campaign to use as much power and support as it can 
get. We have to reach our goal, and it does not mean that 
everyone else will reach their goal. However, we have to take 
people with us; it does not matter how many steps they take with 
us. Perhaps it was Marx who said it; maybe it was Lenin, or it 
could be Mahatma Gandhi. Mr. Gandhi was an idealist, but you 
cannot say that from among his supporters there were no people 
who drank or ate meat. You cannot even say that Mr. Gandhi did 
not know that there were people in his party who lied without 
hesitation. Still, Gandhi used whatever support and strength he 
got from them. However, he never compromised with various 
tendencies. We do not have to compromise with the RSS 
tendencies. But we should use their competence. 
<H5>  [23 Jan pp 1, 7] </H5>
  [Text] Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar does not 
consider himself capable of playing the role of Gandhi or Jay 
Prakash Narayan. However, he considers it important to learn 
from their mistakes. He spoke openly about the Bihar campaign, 
and analyzed its strengths and weaknesses after two decades. He 
threw some light on it for the first time. He never joined a 
cabinet headed by another prime minister. He did not discuss why 
Jay Prakash Narayan made a historical mistake by appointing 
Morarji Desai prime minister in 1977. This is the third 
installment of Chandra Shekhar's interview with Ram Bahadur 
Ray. 
  [Question] It appears that the bureaucracy, the youth, and 
the RSS all feel helpless now. Can the influence of these three 
still be used to help our country? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] No. I do not believe that they consider 
themselves helpless. I am sure that you and I have both felt 
that people do not listen to what they are saying. One should 
not worry about this, because it happens in every critical 
situation. When problems increase extremely, they also open the 
path for a new solution. As the saying goes, too much pain 
becomes a medicine in itself. There is another strange thing. In 
our country, when we have political differences, we do not want 
to have any personal relationships. I do not believe that I am 
washed in milk [flawless]. But because of some mutual 
misunderstanding, insulting someone else is not something I 
consider a part of politics. I have never compromised my 
beliefs. Therefore, I will take anyone as far as he can walk 
with me. I want to say that if some people had not tried to make 
accusations against the RSS in 1977, then the RSS of today would 
not be what it is now. Some people tried to accuse it, and some 
did succeed. The leaders wanted to accuse the RSS, and the RSS 
leaders retracted their accusation. The reason for this is those 
"good" powers that I failed give proper political direction even 
after cooperating with them. 
  [Question] The people had similar hopes for the 1977 change 
in government as they had with the 1947 change. It was also 
believed that the change in government would lead to a change in 
the system. But during the Janata Party rule, this did not 
happen within the party or the government's administration. This 
disappointment gave birth to the present crisis. If you get 
another opportunity, would you take a lesson from those failures? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] I have some experience that is very 
difficult for me to share publicly. I will have to talk with 
some of the people who were running the government at the time. 
This is a very painful issue. What you people know is not 
enough. What happened was that the 1975-77 emergency era was 
very short. People were in jail for 18 months. Later, anyone 
who emerged in the political arena had arrived there after 
winning the election. When they won, they not only became MP or 
MLA, they even became ministers. They understood neither the 
struggle nor the society, nor did the understand the complexity 
of the problems. They did not even understand the goal of the 
movement about which you are talking now. 
  [Question] Before that movement, I told Jay Prakash: 
"Keeping 
in mind the people's opinion, if you are thinking that the 
people will join the movement, Indira Gandhi will send you to 
jail, public rallies will be held, there will be a tumult in the 
Lok Sabha, the Rajah Sabha, and the Vidhan Sabha; and public 
opinion will be formed, then you are wrong. This will not 
happen. Your voice will be muted. The opposition that is 
following the whole movement now, for the most part, has nothing 
to do with the campaign itself. They have no respect for the 
feeling inherent in this campaign. These people want to get into 
government on your coattails. They may be successful in their 
goal, but you will only be disappointed." I told this to Jay 
Prakash Narayan not alone, but in the presence of 10 other 
people. 
  I also wrote letters to Jay Prakash and Indira Gandhi. I 
wrote to Indira Gandhi that the communist leaders were trying to 
have her and Jay Prakash clash with each other, and that they 
were conspiring to enter the government through the back door. I 
also wrote that her clash with Jay Prakash would be fatal to our 
country. Jay Prakash was not fighting to get into government; 
therefore, he could not be pressured with the power of 
government. If Jay Prakash is ready to die by himself, I told 
her, she still could not save the government. Therefore, it 
would be best that she stopped the confrontation with him. Her 
government's power and Jay Prakash's moral strength could save 
the nation. I wrote another letter to Jay Prakash. I told him 
that his followers wanted government, and not a total 
revolution. Therefore, he should talk to Indira Gandhi. 
  He did not listen to me. Both of them are not here now, and 
I 
am talking about them now. I was a bit successful in my efforts. 
This success was limited to Indira Gandhi writing a letter to 
Jay Prakash. But their followers increased the tension between 
them. The leadership of both those people depended on the 
continuing fight between Indira Gandhi and Jay Prakash. Later, 
when the emergency was implemented, I also went to jail. There 
was another problem. You cannot name even two dozen such young 
people who walked with the feeling of revolution. I remember 
that after 18 months, 52 young people from the student movement 
applied for election tickets. 
  I obtained tickets for 45-48 of them after talking with 
Karpuri Thakur. Some of them won elections and even became 
cabinet members. After my government was formed, I went to Patna 
as the president of the Janta Party. We had a meeting at night 
there. In one of the speeches, someone said that the right 
people were not elected to the government. After half an hour, I 
said that I became a legislator in 1962, and have not even been 
able to become a deputy minister in 15 years. I said that I did 
not have the skill to become a minister, and that they could ask 
about this of anyone. I was very disappointed that day. One boy, 
who had gone to jail while attending college, had become an MP 
after 18 months, and wanted to become a minister immediately. He 
had forgotten sacrifices, Jay Prakash Narayan, and the whole 
movement. We have to admit that this was the greatest weakness 
of the whole campaign. 
  Second, there was no one in the Janata Party that considered 
himself equal to another. Everyone thought himself superior to 
others. It is useless to say anything about Morarji. Talking 
about Charan Singh is also useless. The Jan Sangh people had 
come as a power group. The idealism of the socialists had gotten 
to their heads. What could be done in that situation? When I 
remember those incidents, I wonder: How did the government last 
for 28 months? I can remember, based on those experiences, that 
running a government in a country like India, in today's 
situation, requires a lot of courage and clear thinking. We have 
to prepare ourselves for the fact that we may have to leave the 
government tomorrow. The way we have to run the government today 
is a separate issue. 
  There was one great benefit from that movement, however. 
That 
was the world's agreement that democracy had died in India, and 
that it would never thrive there. In this situation, return of 
the democracy could be considered the greatest gain of our 
campaign. The 18-month emergency, followed by the return of 
democracy, is not a gain that we can ignore. I told Jay Prakash 
not to advise anyone anymore. I told him, "You achieved 
everything in the twilight of your life, even things that Gandhi 
did not attain. Therefore, please keep yourself separate from 
everyone. Both Sardar Patel and Pundit Nehru rejected Gandhi, 
and today's leaders will not accept him. Your health is not 
good, either." 
  [Question] There are dozens of people in the next row of 
this 
movement who did not go to any leaders to ask for any party's 
ticket for election, who were devoted to the cause during the 
whole period of this campaign. Still, it is a fact that this 
flow stopped after the Janata government was formed. Who do you 
blame for this? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] Listen, there are two things. Please 
forget 
that all of this happened because of the Janata Party 
government. The ambiguity that was rampant in the movement was 
the reason for it. To those who ask me to play the roles of 
Gandhi and Jay Prakash, I say that I do not agree, and people 
think I am striving to get into power. I have been a student of 
political science and have had open discussions with Jay Prakash 
many times. I do not understand impartial politics. There can be 
social reformers, but there cannot be political workers who are 
impartial. You were right in what you said about the young 
people. It is not that they were disappointed in no time. Some 
young people worked for a long time. However, after that, they 
stopped. Let us look at Jay Prakash's example. He opposed the 
politics of parties. But when we had to change the government, 
he had to depend on the parties that he had opposed strongly. 
Therefore, the greatest weakness of this movement was that we 
said all the negative things, but did not clarify the positive 
aspects. There were many young men in this movement who were 
intelligent. But where did they go from there? Some of them had 
worked for 12 years, staying hungry. I have met people like 
that. They stopped after reaching a specific point, because they 
were taught not to follow the politics of parties. Had they 
continued, and were they still working now, then some new 
politics could be started. You say that there is such a large 
force; however, new youths are not joining us. And if they do 
join, then they do not have contact with us. We have taught the 
young people who worked with us in old times that the politics 
of parties is a bad thing. However, politics has to run with 
them. If a house is dirty, then someone has to clean it. 
Standing outside and saying that the house is dirty will not 
clean the house. 
  [Question] Two decades have passed since your movement. What 
is your evaluation of the movement? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] Before we understand this movement, we 
have 
to first understand JP, and many people have misunderstood him. 
There were two sides to his personality. In the area of 
philosophy, he always worked like an investigator. Therefore, 
his thoughts always changed. JP had to change his philosophy, 
starting with Marx, to Vinoba Bhave, until this movement. 
Therefore, many times, people said that he was ambiguous. He 
understood that there was no limit to thinking, and that there 
was no finite thought. One must look for new ideas and 
philosophy according to the situation. This was his unique 
quality. His decision in the area of action was unbreakable. For 
example, in 1942, he put forth the slogan of "do or die." While 
other Congress leaders thought this was just another Gandhian 
slogan, JP followed it all his life. His jumping the walls of 
Hazaribagh jail was an example of putting the "do or die" slogan 
into practice. I wrote in an article that Jay Prakash's idea 
could change, but when he would jump into the arena of action, 
no power in the world could shake him. Therefore, these people 
in government could never understand the real meaning of what he 
said. Jay Prakash's movement depended on these two aspects. 
There was always a lot of action in the area of philosophy. He 
talked a lot and wrote a lot about the total revolution. This 
was a result of his profound thinking, which he had taken to a 
logical conclusion. One main reason was his ill health. But he 
moved this revolution very rapidly. One reason was the 
situation, and the second was his own personality. Therefore, if 
anyone evaluates this revolution after 20, 50, or even 100 
years, then that person must conclude that one must be willing 
to accept new ideas and changes, and must not hesitate in 
following one's determination and decisive ideas. Therefore, the 
Jay Prakash revolution was unique in itself. Had the emergency 
stayed for six months or a year more, then perhaps there would 
have been more logical results. 
  [Question] JP played a major role in selecting a prime 
minister in 1977. Do you feel that he selected the wrong person 
for this position? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai is our 
respected politician. What can I say about him? I changed my 
opinion at that time. You may remember that I was asked to 
become a cabinet member. When I declined, Jay Prakash asked me 
why I did that. I told him that he knew my opinion. I did not 
want to be a member of that cabinet. It was wrong that I wanted 
to join the cabinet to straighten out the prime minister, 
because remaining a cabinet member depends on the wishes of the 
prime minister. If you do not agree with the prime minister, to 
be able to run the government according to his wishes, then it 
is neither moral nor honest to be a member of such a cabinet. 
  I want to tell you one more thing. People say that Chandra 
Shekhar had his eye on the chair of the prime minister; 
therefore, he never became a minister. This is not true. I 
believe that if you go into government and do not change the 
government system, it will be difficult to change society. I 
believe that I should not join the cabinet of a prime minister 
whose philosophy I do not agree with. One after another, whether 
it was Indira Gandhi, Morarji Desai, or V. P. Singh, none of 
them had the same philosophy that I did. I was not willing to 
work with them. I do not believe that I should work against the 
person in whose cabinet I am a member. Therefore, if some 
minister says that he had joined the cabinet to change the 
government, I will not believe him. It is not possible in a 
parliamentary democracy. Therefore, I did not join any cabinet, 
and it was not because of sacrifice or unselfishness. I never 
even dreamed that I would become a prime minister by following 
this path. I became prime minister for six months. That is 
another story. 
<H5>  [24 Jan pp 1, 10] </H5>
  [Text] Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar has had 
the experience of running the government. His period was short; 
however, he had experienced many new things. His experience with 
the bureaucracy and the army, especially amazes people. During 
this interview, he talked about two positive forces which, if 
used appropriately, could accelerate the change. He also shed 
some light on their weakness. We often think negatively of our 
bureaucracy. A lot has been said about the negative aspects of 
the RSS. Chandra Shekhar has the ability to look at this from a 
different perspective. This is his specialty. This is the fourth 
installment of Chandra Shekhar's interview with Ram Bahadur 
Ray. 
  [Question] What possibilities do you see, looking at the 
social, economic, and political character of the RSS, the 
bureaucracy, and our youth? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] These three forces are organized 
separately. The RSS and the bureaucracy, of course, are 
organized. The young people are also organized in a small way. 
These are not the only three powers. The farmers and the 
laborers have their own power. They also have some organization, 
borne out of their own pains. There are different possibilities 
with each of these forces. Let us talk about the bureaucracy 
first. Its greatest quality is its ability to solve various 
problems. It can combine the experience of the world with its 
own experience. The bureaucrats understand the principles that 
are important to this country. These three things make them a 
very positive force for us. However, there are some weak 
elements. When a person gets a job, he has a great desire to 
serve the people. Slowly and gradually, however, as they get 
promotions, the greed for luxuries increases their tendency to 
become yes men. They cannot tell the truth, even when they know 
what is right and what is wrong. Therefore, if we want to use 
them appropriately, then the political leaders must assure them 
that if they give an opinion, it should not affect their jobs. 
The politicians lack this quality. We want to run them according 
to our own wishes. We do not let them do their duties according 
to their wishes. If we discipline ourselves, then the 
bureaucracy will also be disciplined. It is clear that the 
faster the politicians change themselves, the more effective the 
bureaucracy will be. They will also change. Now that the 
character of politicians has fallen at a large scale, this will 
naturally influence the bureaucracy. 
  [Question] Mr. Trilok Singh was a very effective bureaucrat, 
and he worked around the clock. Can we reform our bureaucracy by 
imposing the Trilok Singh model? You said that the bureaucracy 
can be reformed by reducing political pressure. Can we run a 
model here like the one in France? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] First of all, it took a long time to 
establish a bureaucracy like this in France. Then, there are 
many differences between India and France. They do not have 
inconsistencies and diversity like we have here. As for Trilok 
Singh or L. P. Singh, they have high standards. Despite all the 
weaknesses, the level of the politician was very high at that 
time. On one side there was Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Pundit 
Nehru, and Keshav Dev Malviya. There was also Morarji Desai, 
whom I consider in the same class. What did Lal Bahadur Shastri 
not do to protect the image of the cabinet? Let us look at the 
attitude of this government a few weeks ago. There is no meaning 
in comparing the leaders of that time and of today. That time 
was very different. 
  There are many good people in the bureaucracy now. But 
because of pressure, they cannot write their honest opinion on 
the files. We should not expect the bureaucracy alone to make 
all the changes. The degeneration of character is common now; if 
hemp has been mixed in water of the well itself, how can the 
bureaucracy be left unaffected? Therefore, efforts to change 
should be made at every level. If the people at the top do not 
feel the need for change, then it will not be effective. Because 
of the internationalization of our economic system, our 
bureaucracy is coming into contact with the whole world. But the 
people they are coming in contact with are mostly ignorant about 
the problems of our country. If we ignore some exceptions, I do 
not think that those people working for multinational companies 
and international organizations are fully aware of the problems 
of our country. They do not use the perspective necessary to 
look at our country's problems. This will have bad results. We 
used to say that we would make social progress through hard 
work, according to our resources, and by being simple and 
frugal. The slogan has changed now. The world is changing very 
fast. We have joined the race for luxury goods. The work to 
change mentalities is starting there, and a small group will get 
all the luxuries. It is said that liberalization will give 
freedom to everyone. But what exactly will happen is that those 
who are rich will have more freedom to hoard wealth, and those 
who are dying of hunger will have the freedom to die suffering 
of hunger. It would be wrong to believe that the bureaucracy 
will be unaffected by this change. Therefore, I believe that 
those connected with international organizations are not aware 
of our backward nature and poverty. That is why there is some 
distortions in setting our policies. 
  [Question] This makes one believe that the bureaucracy is 
working for three percent (upper class) of the people. It is not 
worried about the remaining 97 percent. 
  [Chandra Shekhar] The bureaucracy cannot provide any 
leadership. It does what we tell it to do. The bureaucracy 
implements the plans that we assign it. Therefore, when we ask 
it to lead, we are ignoring our responsibility. 
  [Question] You are warned us of the danger of the new 
political culture that is thriving. You have told us how to 
change that at the intellectual level? What methods will be 
necessary to change it at the political level? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] After joining the bureaucracy, people 
become part of a circle. They try to do their duty as well as 
they can. This is not a personal weakness; it is the weakness of 
the whole system. The bureaucracy has its own limitations for 
making sacrifices for the future. It cannot go any farther than 
that. 
  The young people have to prepare themselves mentally for a 
long time to face the challenges. This is their helplessness. 
For them, the life of tomorrow is not the only important thing. 
They have to think about their own lives. The politician who has 
earned respect today will be satisfied by doing some work for 
immediate gratification. But young people who understand the 
future will not hesitate to make sacrifices to make the future 
more productive and stable. There is no dearth of such young 
people in our country. Many young people made sacrifices during 
the last 46-47 years. We can trust them even today. No society 
falls at once. The Indian society, after all, will collapse only 
after great crises. This is clear after the history of the last 
5,000 years. Let us forget the era of Rama and Krishna. History 
clearly shows us that our society cannot break down. There can, 
of course, be some ups and downs. 
  The third issue is the RSS. It has its own beliefs. We 
cannot 
ignore their positive aspects. I have also tried to understand 
the RSS from the beginning. They are told that they should not 
hanker for higher positions, and should not be involved in 
day-to-day politics. They are not involved in blind competition, 
allowing them to finish their work and become MPs or MLAs. We 
have to admit that this approach of self-control is better for a 
long-range struggle. Therefore, it is not wrong to expect these 
people to do something for the society. Their other quality is 
their strong feeling for the glories of our past. Any country 
that does not campaign for its achievements of the past cannot 
build a better future. There were some bad things in our 5,000 
years of history. But there were many positive aspects also. We 
should not ignore those. The attitude we had about the human 
race in the past has affected these people somewhere--for 
example, the question of swadeshi. I do not believe that the RSS 
is looking at swadeshi and self-dependence with the same kind of 
political perspective the BJP is using. This is clear from the 
mentality of these two groups. The RSS people are very 
disciplined in their daily work. This discipline benefits them 
in a positive way and also hurts them. We can use their 
discipline in a positive way to build the future of our nation. 
Therefore, we should not ignore their strengths. 
  There are some negative aspects about the RSS. For example, 
their viewpoint about the religion. It is not clear to me what 
basis they are making it on. I know that this does not agree 
with our traditional humanistic viewpoint. The narrow 
description of religion that the BJP is giving is wrong. I said 
once in Parliament that I am proud to be a Hindu, because it is 
the only religion that does not condemn other religions. We have 
adopted every aspect that shows humanity the right path. While 
we have considered it important to recognize God, we also 
worship Gautama Buddha, who did not believe in God. We also 
worship Charvak as a saint, although he was against then-Hindu 
beliefs. Perhaps you remember the question of suttee. People 
believed in different things. The suttee, on one side, believed 
in forcibly burning the widow. On the other hand, there was the 
belief to burn themselves of their own desire. I do not say it 
is appropriate to commit suttee if God wants you to. But if 
Chandra Shekhar Azad shoots himself instead of being caught by 
the British, we worship him. Will we condemn Padmini because she 
burns herself before she is caught by the enemy? There is a big 
difference between the traditions of johar and suttee. The Hindu 
religion never endorses the suttee tradition. But if some woman 
commits suttee on her own, we worship her. We also worship a 
woman who gives birth to a great son. That is why, in the Hindu 
religion, we also worship the five holy girls in addition to the 
suttees. In other words, the Hindu religion worships 
steadfastness. We worship the power to sacrifice one's life for 
the good of the society. It is unfortunate that the liberal 
nature of the Hindu religion is not brought to the public. I do 
not know what the founder of the RSS thought about it. The 
weakness of the present spokesmen for the RSS today is they look 
down upon other religions. There is a lot of difference between 
the opinion of Balasahab Deoras and Mr. Advani over national 
issues. This weakness of the RSS is its greatest flaw. That is 
why a large majority of our population views the RSS 
suspiciously. Because of this suspicious atmosphere, the 
capability of the RSS is reduced, and at the same time, the 
possibilities of it emerging as a national force also become 
minimal. 
  [Question] Does the RSS divert its philosophy about the 
Hindu 
religion when it talks about nationalism? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] There has been a very liberal description 
of Hinduism, and its humanist image has been presented to the 
society. The RSS cannot be successful in changing that image. 
There may be some distortion for a short time; however, the RSS 
does not have the capability to change the humanistic viewpoint 
of Hinduism. I told Mr. Advani once that he would not rise above 
Yagvalkaya. The idea of world Hindutva came to India first. It 
did not exist anywhere in the world before. It was also said 
that there was only one God, and that there were many paths to 
meeting him. This is what teaches us to respect other religions. 
We consider eating meat and fish a sin. But we also worshiped 
those who ate meat and fish and managed to meet God. In this 
country, where we worship Tukaram, Madhwacharya Ramanujam, and 
Gynashwar, and at the same time worship Kinaram, it is important 
to understand the Hindu religion methodically. Human nature is 
so varied and diversified that all cannot be covered within one 
system. The people here understood this a long time ago. Doing 
good for another person is considered religion in our society. 
Tulsi Das defined religion as "doing good to another." That is 
the summary of our definition of religion. Those who give new 
definitions to religion do not understand that. 
  [Question] The RSS has tried to tell us that religion is a 
part of society. You say that the RSS has tried to join the 
philosophy of Hinduism with the country's politics. They want 
everything to be done for religion. Are the definitions of 
nationalism and religion given by the RSS distorted? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] The RSS people always say that they have 
nothing to do with plain politics. We are speaking based on this 
aspect. They also talk about the aspect that tells us that they 
have good intentions. We have opposed the RSS strongly at the 
political level. After all, there is no one in the world who is 
fully a saint or a devil. There is a portion of saintliness and 
devilishness in everyone. Some have more of one than the other. 
We want to look for the good in every person in this society so 
that they can be helpful in bad days. 
  [Question] The stand of the RSS in Ayodhya-- 
  [Chandra Shekhar] Ayodhya is not the result of RSS actions. 
It happened because of an indecisive and weak government's 
mentality. Religion is a path to reaching God. We have the full 
right to believe in and follow any religion. But when it 
influences politics, it becomes dangerous. Therefore, the 
government was created. The invention of a government is based 
on the cooperation of people and their helplessness. We expect 
that when a person tries to hurt other people, the government 
should intervene. It is not just a question of punishing 
someone. If people knew that the government is determined to do 
its duty, then this destruction would not have happened in 
Ayodhya. When I was in the government, no one challenged our 
authority. What happened in Ayodhya on 6 December is, in my 
opinion, the responsibility of the government. I have said the 
same thing to the prime minister. The government and the state 
were established because in one or the other place there could 
be ill feelings in society. Therefore, the government did not do 
its basic duty in the Babri Masjid fiasco. 
  [Question] That was the problem of the organizing-- 
  [Chandra Shekhar] The problem was not of organization; it 
was 
of indecisiveness. If we consider it a problem of organization, 
we will have a difficult time doing so, because we can have 
problems over the border also. The leadership was fully 
responsible for it. 
  [Question] What kind of action could be taken at that time? 
If they had started firing, it would have resulted in blood-- 
  [Chandra Shekhar] When there is such a crisis, one has to 
shoot. The government spends billions of rupees on the armed 
forces and defense. This is not done for the wearing of flower 
garlands. Firing bullets is necessary if there is a need, and 
you do not start shooting out of cowardice and irresponsibility 
to the people. 
  [Question] The government is defensive in a democracy. Are 
not there any limitations when it is involved in a campaign like 
the one in Ayodhya? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] It should be defensive, but it does not 
happen that way. Many times, we cannot take defensive steps. We 
had to do something at the time. During my government, we never 
had to shoot at any one. 
  [Question] Was not it necessary to stop half a million 
people 
from going there? 
  [Chandra Shekhar] Yes, it was wrong to let them go there. 
That is why I asked the government to stop it when there were 
demonstrations in Delhi, and said that if necessary, they should 
start shooting. When a BJP friend said that I responded by 
saying that if Advani was arrested without reason, that I would 
go to his house; if Advani tried to spread restlessness without 
any reason, I could stop him. 
  [Question] Problems arise if positive policies are not 
implemented by a government in a democracy. This leads to more 
violence. 
  [Chandra Shekhar] When a government does not take positive 
steps, then it creates anarchy. In such a situation, there are 
only two options--either controlling these forces or letting the 
society break down. 
  [Question] Both negative and positive aspects of the RSS 
emanate from its philosophy. The energy that the RSS is crating 
by combining religious and politics.... 
  [Chandra Shekhar] I have nothing to do with that energy. I 
do 
not consider it energy. I do not even want to know their 
definition of religion, which spreads hatred and enmity toward 
other people. I do not know much about the RSS perspective of 
the world; however, the liberal viewpoint of Hinduism is one 
that no one has been able to duplicate. Neither the Vishwa Hindu 
Parishad nor the people who call themselves humanists have 
arrived there. I am against those people who consider themselves 
progressive because they negate everything that happened in our 
past. This is not progress; this is deception. Similarly, 
distorting the past for some political gain and using religion 
to create energy are not acts to help society; it is changing 
the energy to fire and burning the society in it.

<F P=106> [Article: "CPI-M Politburo Flays PV, Cong"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 1: The politburo of the Communist 
Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) on Saturday criticised the Prime 
Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the ruling Congress party 
for rejecting the Finance Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh's 
resignation and for admitting the Janata Dal leader, Mr Ajit 
Singh, and a group of parliamentarians into the party. 
  In a statement issued here, the politburo denounced the 
attitude of the Congress government and the Prime Minister, 
towards the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report on the 
multi-crore securities scam. The ruling party has come out 
"brazenly in defence of all those indicted by the JPC as being 
accountable in the worst corruption scandal since independence." 
The Prime Minister's action in rejecting the resignation of Dr 
Singh has struck a blow at the concept of a minister's 
accountability for gross failure of his ministry to check such a 
mindboggling swindle of public funds. 
  The statement also charged the Congress with "shamelessly" 
defending the other ministers indicted by the JPC report such as 
the Health and Family Welfare Minister, Mr Shankaranand, and the 
Rural Development Minister, Mr Rameshwar Thakur. The Congress 
spokesman, Mr V.N. Gadgil's criticism of the JPC's indictment of 
the two ministers showed the utter contempt for the unanimous 
report submitted by the JPC and for parliamentary democracy 
itself. The swindling of public funds caused by the Narasimha 
Rao government's policies could not be covered up by such 
Congress machinations. 
  It said that the Congress has set another example of 
"contempt of parliamentary democracy by admitting Ajit Singh and 
a group of MPs [members of Parliament] into the party." The 
Congress has made it a practice to make a mockery of the 
anti-defection law in its pursuit to get a majority in the Lok 
Sabha. The unprincipled and self-serving step of defection to 
the Congress by Ajit Singh would also meet with the firm 
disapproval of the people. The last that Mr Ajit Singh and the 
others could have done was to resign their seats in Parliament 
as they had been voted on an anti-Congress platform, it added.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Punam I. Kaushik: "Congress' In-fighting in </F>
the Southern States"; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] A belligerent cat said to the other cat, "come 
fight." Yes, if we do not enact such a scene, we will soon lose 
the title of the victorious warrior. The Congress (I) in 
Karnataka is trying to take over control. In the neighboring 
Tamil Nadu, the cat called Jayalalitha is growling at Governor 
Channa Reddy. Meanwhile, Rajshekhar Reddy's meow' in Karnataka 
for Chief Minister Vijay Bhaskar could become dangerous once 
again. Narasimha Rao have cats on both sides. 
  The prime minister was wrong if he thought that after the 
vidhan sabha election in northern India and resolution of 
Manmohan Singh's resignation affair, he would take a sigh of 
relief. The dissatisfaction with the Congress (I) is increasing 
with each passing day. If is Karnataka's turn today, Andhra 
Pradesh' tomorrow, and Tamil Nadu's the day after. The 
idealistic days of collaboration between idli and dosa [southern 
dishes] are gone. Even rasam [southern dessert] is becoming 
bitter now. 
  This is a double jeopardy for the Congress president. There 
will be elections in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh during the 
next nine months. If this dissatisfaction increased more, it 
would be grievous for the party. The party leaders are worried 
that the party could be hurt badly in these elections whether 
they change the party leadership at state level or not. 
  Even more important is the fact the Congress (I) had more 
control in southern states than in northern states during the 
last general elections, and that had helped it bag the prime 
minister's position. It was the first time since the 
independence that a southerner was appointed prime minister. 
  It is true that there are still two more years for the next 
general elections. Still, it seems that the upcoming vidhan 
sabha elections will indicate what the Congress will have in 
1996. In addition, there will be several vidhan sabha elections 
in 1995, starting those in Orissa. No doubt, the Congress (I) 
won the elections in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh in 
December 1993. Dissatisfaction is brewing within the Congress 
(I) here also, and the Congress (I) cannot lulled into 
complacency. 
  Many party leaders are distressed because the central 
leadership has not been consistent in it dealing with Karnataka 
Congress (I). The Congress (I) came to power in 1990. There have 
been three chief ministers here since then. Virendra Patil was 
the first chief minister and Bangarappa showed up and raised the 
flag of dissatisfaction. When Bangarappa became the chief 
minister, Moily blew the bugle of rebellion. Now Moily is the 
chief minister and S.M. Krishna is leading the dissidents. 
  It is ironic that despite its having the majority with 183 
members out of the total of 224 members in the vidhan sabha, the 
Congress (I) has failed to establish a stable government. This 
has not happened because of an aggressive opposition, but 
because of factionalism within the party. The Congress (I) 
members accused the cabinet members of their own government more 
than the opposition members did. They did not worry even about 
the fact that they will have to face the voters during the next 
election. The detractors recently staged a dharna [sit-in] for 
three days and the vidhan sabha chairperson had to adjourn the 
session. 
  Moily and Krishna came to blows right in front of Jagannath 
Misra, the high command supervisor. Commented he on this 
incident, "Until now I thought that Bihar's Congress members 
were undisciplined and there is anarchy there because of the 
state's culture. No one will ever believe that peace-loving 
Kannada people can present such a scene that could put even the 
Biharis to shame." 
  Not only this, the problem that the party is facing in the 
vidhan sabha itself is attributed to the Congress (I) high 
command. It did not interfere in time when Bangarappa was 
starting the tirade against Virendra Patil or when Moily was 
spewing fire against Bangarappa or now when Krishna has risen 
against Moily. These leaders have followed this technique, and 
the central leadership had given them a long rope hoping that 
they would straighten out the situation themselves as time 
passes. This did not happen and they replaced one with the other. 
  Last week, Mr. Narasimha Rao had said in Hyderabad, "There 
can be 15 Congressites who are qualified to become the chief 
minister, however, all 15 of them cannot be appointed to the one 
position." He strongly criticized internal conspiracies, but 
also felt that the main reason for dissatisfaction within the 
party was the overflowing egos of the leaders. 
  If this is true, then it is surprising that he decided to 
keep himself out and let the fire of dissatisfaction rage. It is 
also strange that Moily has the prime minister's trust, but he 
still does not find himself in the same boat as did Bangarappa. 
  It is true that Krishna is the leader of the dissidents. He 
was an associate of Moily in the cabinet and is making his life 
miserable since last May. They have drifted far apart from each 
other now. Not only this, Moily is not able to focus on his 
government tasks now. He has not been able to get even one 
important bill passed during this time. Some directives and 
legislative orders were issued but those have lapsed now. He 
could neither run even one day of the vidhan sabha session since 
September nor could he hold a meeting of the Pradesh Congress 
Committee. 
  The high command did not accept resignations of the 
dissident 
cabinet members. It resulted in loyal members adopting the same 
attitude. This encouraged the weary Moily, however, the 
situation is still serious. 
  The Karnataka Congress (I) has still been given the 
opportunity to deal with its inner strife on its own. This will 
not last long, however. It looks like Karnataka has a 
non-Congress government. The governor should also have submitted 
a report on constitutional crisis. He could have recommended to 
the president to establish presidential rule in the state. 
  Whatever happens, one thing is certain: These incident will 
tarnish Congress' image. There were many incidents of fraud 
during Bangarappa's government, and nothing has been achieve 
during Moily's government. 
  Former Chief Minister Bangarappa was expelled from the 
Congress (I) for six years, and he has formed a regional party. 
It is assumed that he may join Bahujan Samaj Party's Kanshi Ram. 
These two will try to make Karnataka another Uttar Pradesh. The 
Janata Dal can also join them. The Janata Dal can also try to 
stage a comeback on its own strength. Another power has been 
formed by the union of Ramakrishna Hegde and Devgauda. In this 
situation, the competition will be among the three groups in 
this state--the newly emerging power, the Congress, and the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party]. The BJP received more than 30 percent 
votes in the last vidhan sabha election, and it has established 
its roots here. 
  In Andhra Pradesh, T.N. Ramarao would like to avenge himself 
of the insulting defeat he suffered in 1989. The inner bickering 
within the Congress (I) is going on there also. The party 
discipline committee has served a show cause' notice to 
Rajshekhar Reddy, the legislator from Kudappa. The head of this 
committee is chief minister Vijay Bhaskar Reddy. The 
dissatisfaction there is not as severe as is in Karnataka. 
Rajshekhar is more tolerant than is Bangarappa. It is expected 
from Narasimha Rao that he establishes peace and cooperation in 
both states. 
  No one is angry at Narasimha Rao in Tamil Nadu, however, the 
Congress (I) president will have to deal with another dissidence 
in the party there, and also take care of Chief Minister 
Jayalalitha who is active against the governor. There are 61 
Congress (I) members in the vidhan sabha and they are divided 
into six factions. They also ignored the state Congress (I) 
president's directive to boycott the vidhan sabha session. 
  As the prime minister, Narasimha Rao will have to recognize 
the chief minister's working style. The central government has 
to ignore the opposition government if it disagrees with the 
governor. It is clear that some disagreements between the chief 
minister and the governor have surfaced during recently. 
Jayalalitha has accused the governor of several things--he is 
keeping the files hanging, is building cases against some of her 
cabinet members, and is threatening to impose president's rule. 
  It really is ridiculing history when the governor is removed 
from chancellorship. It was Channa Reddy who had straightened 
out N.T. Ramarao when he had appointed himself the chancellor of 
the Telagu University. 
  It is possible that the central leadership may not interfere 
even after the state Congress has requested it. Some people 
think that since Jayalalitha had presented a silk shawl to 
Narasimha Rao during his recent visit to the state, the tension 
between the two has evaporated. Still, if the hold is loosened, 
there might be some danger. 
  Now the question is: Will the Congress (I) high command be 
able to hold the key to keeping its control in southern India in 
its own hand or not? At present, the Congress (I) has become its 
own worst enemy. It was apparent during the recent vidhan sabha 
election in Rajasthan that the Congress members were cutting 
each other's neck. This all could be reenacted during the 
Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh vidhan sabha elections. The 
Congress (I) must have thought before the election, "the wave 
will rise in the North if not in the South." The party still 
believes now that if the party wave does not rise in the South 
in 1994, then it will rise in the North in 1996. However, it is 
also possible that the Congress (I) drowns sandwiched between 
the North and South.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Vibhavasu Tiwari: "BJP Created New Limits of </F>
Success"] 
  [Text] The political platform in Delhi was divided between 
the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and the Congress (I) until 
recently, and the Janata Dal has joined it to make it a 
triangle. The Delhi Vidhan Sabha results show that the political 
tableau of this metropolitan city is not the same. The 
continuously rising population and the changed socio-political 
environment have sent the vote banks from one party to another 
party's coffers. 
  A review of the political activities of 1993 indicates that 
this year was not very good for the Congress (I) and Janata Dal 
parties in this state, while the state's BJP has set new 
standards of success and has established its rule in Delhi. It 
was successful in increasing its prestige among the people. 
Meanwhile, the Congress (I) leaders in this city were occupied 
in groupism, accusations and counter-accusations, and fighting 
with each other. The same is true for the state's Janata Dal. 
Instead of trying to strengthen the party in the state and 
increasing its support base, the Janata Dal leaders spent the 
whole year fighting over leadership. Both these parties because 
of their weakness have not played their expected role in Delhi 
Vidhan Sabha. The Congress (I), of course, was defeated, and the 
Janata Dal did not take advantage of the situation as it could 
have. 
  The Delhi branch of the Communist Party under the leadership 
of M.M. Gope, and the CPI (M) behind its local leader Jogender 
Sharma, tried to increase their political activities by holding 
public meetings and rallies. However, they failed in luring the 
Delhi voters. Janata Dal won over them. By snatching away the 
traditional votes, it proved that it can be the cause of some 
party's victory and other party's defeat. 
  The results of the Delhi Vidhan Sabha elections held on 6 
November show that the votes cast for Janata Dal had spoiled 
Congress (I) arithmetic, and it was defeated by the BJP. Senior 
Congress (I) leaders have admitted that if the Janata Dal was 
not in the race, the Congress (I) would not have faced this 
defeat. Despite its weak organization and lack of money, the 
Janata Dal's stealing Congress (I) votes can be called its 
achievement. 
  Actually, the Janata Dal limited itself to one dimension 
during 1993. Neither was its organization strong nor did it 
manage to increase its support base. Its unity was broken 
because of the internal strife and leadership conflict. 
  The last year was not good for the Congress (I) in Delhi. 
The 
local leaders remained busy in groups politics all through the 
year and weakened the state party with accusations and counter 
accusations. The atmosphere was hostile to the state president, 
Mr. Hari Kishan Lal Bhagat, during the whole year. Efforts were 
made to cut off his control. R.K. Dhawan, member of the Congress 
Working Committee and a legislator; New Delhi legislator Rajesh 
Khanna; and Jagdish Tytler, legislator from Delhi Sadar and a 
cabinet member; joined forces against Mr. Bhagat. The call for 
changing the leadership was raised repeatedly. Now after the 
defeat in the vidhan sabha elections, the demand for changing 
state's party leadership has become stronger. 
  The main reason for the defeat of the state's Congress (I) 
was its internal strife and loss of its traditional vote bank. 
Once during the last year, the prime minister reproached the 
Delhi leaders, however, it was not effective. On one side, Mr. 
Bhagat's residence at 34 Prithvi Raj Road was the meeting place 
for the local leaders, while Mr. Dhawan's house in Golf Link and 
Mr. Rajesh Khanna's government residence in Lodhi Estates were 
the meeting places for the dissenters. Both sides played this 
game which was disgraceful, and the Congress (I) leaders in 
Delhi will never be able to forget the catastrophe it led to. 
  This year has been very pleasing for the local leaders who 
are controlling Delhi government now. They may not have been as 
successful as expected in other states, but in Delhi, which is a 
miniature reflection of India and on whose palpitation moves the 
whole country, BJP's access to its throne is a major victory. It 
is a commendable achievement for the BJP to have the first chief 
minister in Delhi's newly elected vidhan sabha. The reason for 
is the BJP leaders' active involvement in local problems. The 
Congress (I) lost its face in front of Delhi voters in 1993, and 
the BJP put its entire energy to win their respect. 
  Despite this success, there has been some minor skirmishes 
among the state BJP leaders. Some workers also got a taste of 
it. Mr. Om Prakash Kohli was elected as president of the state 
party organization again for two year. He has started working on 
tightening the state's organizational structure. It has also 
been kept in mind not to offend the veteran senior leaders. 
While trying to strengthen the party, active cooperation from 
various BJP units including the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak 
Sangh] was sought. Despite some conflicts, the RSS was 
successful in keeping its clout at the state level. 
  The state BJP had been actively increasing its support all 
year. It was for the first time that it prepared a large vote 
bank in rural Delhi. Strategies were planned to include people 
living in slums and refugee resettlement camps through meetings 
and conferences. It was successful in this effort. All in all, 
the BJP managed to form new vote banks in Delhi. 
  The Sikhs have always influenced the politics in this 
metropolis. The Sikh community and their political groups have 
their own importance here. Before the 1984 riots, this groups 
had traditionally stayed with the Congress (I). However, it 
drifted away from this party after that. The state BJP took full 
advantage of this situation and tried to get the Sikhs with 
them. Their success in these efforts resulted in more about 80 
percent of Sikh votes coming to the BJP. 
  Opposed to it, the Muslim voters remained away from the BJP 
for the whole year. If we review the activities of the this past 
year, this group has been suspicious about the situation in 
Delhi. Although this group was angry at the Congress (I), part 
of it stayed with it because of the Janata Dal's frailty, and a 
larger part supported the Janata Dal. 
  That was the reason for the polarization of the Muslim votes 
in Delhi politics. The decision to vote was based on the 
candidates themselves in the vidhan sabha election. The Muslim 
politics also showed that it is not limited to the inner city 
now; its votes can be cause of victory or defeat in areas 
outlying Delhi. 
  The caste equation proved to be neutral in this changing 
political platform in Delhi, still there are some seats where 
victory or defeat was decided by the caste equation alone. Some 
seats in eastern and outer Delhi, caste played strongly in 
decisions and votes were cast according to caste decisions. The 
composition of seats has also changed because of the rapid 
urbanization of areas around Delhi. Thus, 1993 has continuously 
shook the Delhi politics and politicians. This year has been the 
year of 'political examinations,' the results of which will help 
the political pundits to spread their political chess game in 
the coming years.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Manmohan Sharma: "In the forthcoming </F>
Elections in States, Local Parties Will Play Consequential 
Roles"] 
  [Text] The regional parties will play a decisive role in 
the eight vidhan sabha elections scheduled during the next one 
and a half year. Just like the influence of the major national 
parties is decreasing, the influence of regional parties is 
increasing. The Congress (I) was in a bad situation during the 
recent elections and lost Delhi, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. 
The dream that the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] had of emerging 
as a national party was broken by these elections. The influence 
of the communist and Marxist parties is limited to a few 
localities, and they are not in position to claim the rank of 
national parties. During the last few decades, the influence of 
regional parties has definitely increased. Victory of Mulayam 
Singh's Samajwadi Party in a huge state like Uttar Pradesh also 
points to this change. The regional parties in northeastern 
states have been enjoying control for a long time. According to 
scholars, one reason for the increased popularity of these 
regional parties is lack of interest by national parties in 
local problems. The people start supporting their local parties 
in order to resolve their problems. 
  Often, unbalanced distribution of development projects also 
encourages regional emotions. Haryana was created because of 
this. At present, regional parties are leading campaigns for 
separate statehood for Bundhelkhand, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh, and 
Uttrakhand. It is our country's misfortune that five decades 
have passed since our independence and, instead of considering 
ourselves Indian nationals, we call ourselves Punjabi, 
Rajasthani, Kashmiri, Dogri, Himachali, Malayali, and Kannada 
residents. The louder the discussion of conceptual unity, the 
harder the selfish politicians incite the emotions for 
statehood, casteism, and regionalism to strengthen their vote 
banks and obtain a position. There are many leaders in the 
national unity commission who want to divide India over 
language, caste, and religion. 
  Background of Regional Parties: The regional parties have 
played an important role in politics since independence. The 
Election Commission divided the regional parties into two 
categories. Some of these are recognized parties and others are 
merely registered as parties. The Election Commission recognizes 
a party whose candidate get a certain percent of votes in an 
elections. If a party succeeds in getting five percent of total 
votes in four or five states, it is considered a national party. 
According to Election Commission records, there are 261 regional 
parties, and 30 of these are recognized parties. When a party 
does not receive a specific percentage of votes, the Election 
Commission cancels its recognized status. 
  According to an Election Commission report, 51 parties took 
part in the 1952 election, however, only 20 of these did get 
their representatives in the House. Fifteen of these were 
regional parties. These included the Akali Dal, National 
Conference, Hindu Mahasabha, Tamil Nadu Dalit Party, Ram Rajya 
Parishad, Jharkhand Party, Common Wealth Party, Scheduled Castes 
Federation, Kisan Kamgar Party, Karantikari Samajwad Party, Lok 
Swaraj Sangh, Lok Paksh, Forward Block, Madras Muslim League, 
and Travancore and Tamil Nadu Congress. 
  Their number went down to 13 by the second elections in 
1957. 
They won 39 seats. These included new and small parties such as 
Dravida Munetra Kagzam, Congress Sudhar Simiti, Loksewa Sangh, 
Muslim League, and Purvi Bharat Janjati Union. In the 1962 
elections, 14 small parties succeeded in sending a 
representative to Parliament with a total of 31 seats. The new 
parties among these were: Ganatantar Parishad, Republican Party, 
Nutan Gujrat Janata Parishad, and All India Hill Leaders 
Congress. 
  The same situation prevailed during the 1967 elections. The 
main change was the emergence of DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] 
in Tamil Nadu which won 25 seats in the Lok Sabha. The DMK won 
the government in Tamil Nadu. The reason for the DMK popularity 
was the increasing approval of the anti-Hindi movement there. 
Anna Durai created the difference between the Aryans and 
Dravidians and floated the ideas of the superiority of 
Dravidians and atrocities committed by the Aryans. Later the DMK 
was split. M.G. Ramachandran rebelled against Karunanidhi's 
policies and founded the ADMK [Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]. 
At present, ADMK leader Jayalalitha is ruling Tamil Nadu. It is 
a paradox of Indian politics that the ADMK which was established 
on the hatred for Aryans and Brahmans is controlled by 
Jayalalitha who is a Brahman herself. She is a daughter of a 
dancer and an actor who worked in the Mysore royal court. 
  The people have complained about Telangana and royal limits 
that the Nizam and the Andhra rulers had always ignored their 
progress. In 1971, the Telangana movement became aggressive and 
created a new regional party called the Telangana Praja Simiti 
which won 10 seats in 1971. It got 14.43 percent votes in that 
election. There was a polarization in Assam also. The new 
regional party, the All India Hill Leaders Conference, ran for 
elections and won one seat. Three other regional 
parties--Peoples Democratic Party, Plain Tribal Council, and 
Hill State Peoples Democratic Party--did participate in the 
election, however, all their candidates lost their election 
deposits. The Vishal Haryana Party led by Rao Vir Bhadar Singh 
participated in the elections and won three seats. 
  The All India Arya Sabha participated in the Haryana 
elections, however, its candidates lost. The Kerala Muslim 
League and Kerala Congress ran for elections in Kerala. Both 
parties won two seats each. The Akali Party ran for elections in 
Punjab. It pitted its candidates at twelve seats, of which 11 
lost. In Maharashtra, the Republican Party of India (Gaekwad) 
won one seat with Congress Party's support. The Republican Party 
of India (Khobergade) also ran for elections, however, all of 
its 15 candidates lost. The Shiv Sena ran for elections over the 
question of Hinduism and lost election deposits in 3 of the 5 
seats. In West Bengal, three regional parties--Bangla Congress, 
RSPSP [expansion not given], and the Muslim League--each won one 
seat. The Sanyukta Govan, the Lokpaksh, and Maharashtra Gomantak 
Party emerged in Goa. The Maharashtra Gomantak Party won the 
majority there under the leadership of Mr. Dayanand Bandodkar. 
  The DMK was badly shaken in the 1977 election. It lost 24 
out 
of its 25 Lok Sabha seats. The ADMK emerged as a new force and 
won 19 Lok Sabha seats. The Kerala Congress was divided into two 
groups. The Manipur Peoples Party established government in 
Manipur. The Ramrajya Parished was totally wiped out. Thus, 22 
regional parties ran for elections in 135 constituencies and 13 
of these parties won 52 seats. 
  The Election Commission issued registered symbols to 27 
regional parties in the 1980 elections. Among these Kuki 
National Assembly (Manipur), Peoples Congress (Mizoram), Sikkim 
Congress, Tripura Upjati Yuva Morcha, Sikkim Janata Party, and 
Telagu Desam were the parties. In 1984, the Telagu Desam emerged 
as a major opposition party in the Lok Sabha with 29 seats. The 
other parties remained in the same position. 
  The Andhra Pradesh government moved to the Congress Party 
from Telagu Desam in 1987. In Punjab, the Akali Dal formed 
government under the leadership of Mr. Surjit Singh Barnala. The 
hurricane led by Chowdhery Devi Lal in Haryana wiped out the 
Congress there. The Congress (I) took back the government in 
Haryana in 1990. 
  The Telagu Desam is preparing to win the government in 
Andhra 
Pradesh again. Orissa's chief minister, Biju Patnayak, seeing 
the weak condition of the Janata Party is organizing a small 
regional party called Utkal Janata there. The Akali Dal in 
Punjab is divided in to 16 groups. Recently the Langowal group 
and the Talwandi group have merged. The Akalis have learned from 
their experience in the past that they won whenever they 
collaborated with the Jan Sangh. Perhaps, that is why the Akali 
leader Prakash Singh Badal had strongly endorsed the Bharatiya 
Janata Party during the recent elections. He has also 
contributed to Bhairon Singh Shekhawat's winning the government 
in Rajasthan. If these two parties form a coalition in Punjab, 
the Congress (I) will be in grave danger there. As for Haryana, 
three years ago when Bansi Lal had formed the Haryana Vikas 
Party, it appeared the he was going to win the election. 
However, the people in Haryana supported the Congress (I) in his 
stead and elected Bhajan Lal to the government. Chief Minister 
Bhajan Lal and his administration helped Chautala to defeat 
Randip Singh, son of the dissident leader Shamsher Singh 
Surjewala, in the bye-election in Narvana. Bansi Lal 
collaborated with the BJP, however, their joint candidate could 
not even salvage his election deposit. They could not help the 
BJP candidate win in the Kalka bye-election. Later, his party 
was divided thanks to Bhajan Lal who moved several of their 
legislators and the lone Lok Sabha member to his side. There is 
not doubt that the Bhajan Lal government in Haryana is on shaky 
ground now. The Congress (I) did not fulfill the promises it 
made to the people. Because of the disorganization in 
electricity supply, the state is losing 2.5 billion rupees. 
There is a major outcry in southern Haryana because of scarcity 
of water. The people are cursing the day when they voted for the 
Congress (I). If Bhajan Lal fails in doing a miracle, the 
Congress (I) definitely will be wiped out in the next election. 
The people in the state are leaning toward Uncle Chautala again. 
The number of people attending his public rallies is increasing. 
The Samajwadi Janata Dal is becoming regional in nature now. 
  Bangarappa Forms the Congress Party: Until now, it was 
believed that the Congress (I) was very strong in south India. 
However, this situation changed when Bangarappa, the former 
Karnataka chief minister, rebelled. He has spoiled Congress (I) 
high command's sleep by forming a new regional party, the 
Karnataka Congress. 
  Bangarappa was expelled from the Congress (I) once before, 
however, political contingencies forced the party to take him 
back. Bangarappa is very popular among the Dalits and backwards 
in the state. There is no doubt that his government was 
notorious for corruption, unfortunately however, corruption has 
become an integral party of our country's lifestyle, and the 
voters do not pay much attention to it. 
  Bangarappa joined the politics in 1962 as a disciple of Dr. 
Lohia. Later, he changed parties depending on which way the wind 
blew, and enjoyed the fruits of being in government. Being from 
the Lohia school, he is hard working and aggressive. His fracas 
with his party leaders are common. Most of the Lohia disciples 
are very liberal about their eating habits. They do not care 
much for their clothes either. Bangarappa is different from them 
in this area. He likes to wear spotless white clothes and plays 
badminton. He also likes to jog. He used to jog for three 
kilometers daily even when he was the chief minister. 
  He rebelled from the Join Socialist Party in 1963 and joined 
the revolutionary group of the that party. In 1977, Dev Raj Urs 
brought him into the Congress Party. They did not stay together 
for long. In 1979, when Urs broke up with Indira Gandhi and 
established Congress Urs, Indira Gandhi had Bangarappa run 
against him to diminish his influence. 
  He could not get along with Indira Gandhi either. In 1982, 
he 
established a new party named Karantiranga with Dev Raj Urs in 
Karnataka and won the elections by collaborating with the Janata 
Party. He disagreed with the leadership later over the question 
of appointing the chief minister. He resigned from the 
Karantiranga and joined the Congress Party. He became the 
opposition leader. In 1989, the Janta Dal lost the government 
and he become the chief minister of Karnataka. Rajesh Pilot, 
Sita Ram Kesari, and Buta Singh played a major role in getting 
him into the government. Soon after he became the chief 
minister, the Congress (I) legislators began to rebel against 
him. Activities of the dissidents increased under the leadership 
of Veerappa Moily. Reportedly Narasimha Rao had encouraged the 
dissidents. Kerala's Chief Minister Karunakaran also wanted his 
favorite person as the chief minister of Karnataka. Bangarappa 
openly opposed the prime minister in the Kaveri water dispute. 
This led to increase in the tension between the two. The 
dissidents accused Bangarappa of the serious crime of amassing 
billions of rupees illegally. It is said that Bangarappa, in 
order to get the prime minister's support, tried to get his son 
Prabhakar Rao to his side. The prime minister endorsed him in 
the beginning, however, when the campaign against Bangarappa in 
the newspapers became very strong, the Congress (I) high command 
had to remove him. Veerappa Moily was his successor. 
  In the budget session of the vidhan sabha, Bangarappa levied 
some serious accusations against the government of his own 
party. In response, Moily assigned the Classic Computer fraud 
case to the CBI to trap Bangarappa. The CBI searched 
Bangarappa's house also and this made Bangarappa angry. He 
blamed the prime minister for the recent defeat of the Congress 
(I) in northern India. He also accused that Narasimha Rao was 
playing into the hands of the BJP, and that he failed to protect 
the Babri Masjid. He called Narasimha Rao a scorpion. He was 
expelled from the Congress (I) because of it.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Only the Government of the People"] </F>
  [Text] It is being said about UP [Uttar Pradesh] Chief 
Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav that he supports strict discipline. 
But the strictness he refers to should be soft from within. If 
the officials do not understand the chief minister's definition 
of strictness, then they might be making a serious mistake by 
following his directives. Recently, he told senior police 
officials in the state that they must be sensitive to the needs 
of the poor, because this government is of the poor. At the same 
time, the chief minister also told them that police officials 
must pay special attention to the minorities (Muslims), backward 
classes, and the Dalits. Here, the police officials must avoid 
misunderstanding him. What we mean is that in their zeal, they 
should not think that the chief minister has told them not to 
care for whoever is left after Muslims, backward classes, and 
the Harijans are taken care of, and that if they come with a 
complaint, they should be totally ignored. Nor does this mean 
that the police should be so lenient toward the minorities that 
if they are committing atrocities against the majority group, 
then the police should not listen to the grievances of the 
suffering group in the name of Mulayam Singh. The poor, 
backward, and the Dalits are the ones being given political 
color in a hurry. The reason is that there are a large number of 
people in India who are either poor, backward, or Dalits, or 
members of a minority group. In this situation, the officials 
should be fully alert to the fact that governments change 
periodically; however, the constitution they must follow remains 
the same. It is the duty of the police and the administrators to 
implement law and carry on government work within a 
constitutional framework. Senior police officials are only 
required to be loyal to the law and the Constitution. That is 
their duty. Be it a chief minister or a prime minister, they are 
all under the constitution. When a political party that has the 
support of the minorities and the Harijans comes to power in a 
state, it is clear that its chief minister will talk about 
helping them just to strengthen his popular support. However, 
the police officials should not forget that their real boss is 
the Constitution, and that they are small cogs in this big 
machinery, just like the chief minister and other Cabinet 
members. These officials run the government, which the people 
elect. An elected government belongs neither to the poor, nor to 
the rich, nor to the high-caste people; to the Harijans, the 
Hindus, or the Muslims. An elected government belongs to 
everyone. 
  Whenever a chief minister gives a directive to the state's 
senior police officials, and administrators, then one must be 
very careful about his words. How can Mulayam Singh Yadav say 
his government belongs to the poor? He cannot say this, because 
who knows how many rich people have voted for his party. How can 
the chief minister order the high officials to give special 
attention to the minorities? Did not the Hindus help his party 
win the government? If he thinks so, then he should say that 
this is the government of the Muslims. What we mean to say here 
is that when a party establishes government, it has its own same 
place. However, the ministers and their leader, the chief 
minister, get out of the narrow circle of their party. There 
would be tens of millions of UP voters who are BJP Bharatiya 
Janata Party] supporters. Does it mean Mulayam Singh Yadav will 
hang them all or tell the UP police to make their lives 
unbearable? Under the Constitution, every citizen of the state 
has the same privileges and rights. It is the government's duty 
to make sure that they get these rights and privileges equally, 
and without any bias. In other words, Chief Minister Mulayam 
Singh should remember when addressing the senior police 
officials that the UP government is the government of the 
people. Please remember that, and make sure that no person, be 
he powerful or weak, is suffering, and that no one has to face 
any extreme treatment. That is what the whole message is about. 
The government belongs to the people, especially in a democratic 
system. We cannot say that a specific government belongs to the 
poor, the Dalits, the backward, the Harijans, the minorities, 
the rich, the high caste, or the Hindus. 
  The politicians of our country cashed in the Harijan votes 
first. Later, they cashed in the minorities and various 
religious groups. Kalyan Singh did not take anyone's side. We 
have seen only one scenario under the slogans of "eradicating 
poverty" and "the government of the poor." The BJP said that 
this is the government of the Hindus, and now it is out of the 
government now. There was a time when the Congress (I) used to 
lick the feet of the Harijans and the Muslims, and it is out of 
the state's government now. Now Mulayam Singh is the chief 
minister, and he is saying it is the poor people's government. 
It is OK to this extent; however, telling the officials to gird 
up their loins to make sure the minority and backward groups get 
full justice is undemocratic, biased, and suicidal for the 
government itself. A government should never distinguish between 
the rich and poor, high and low, Hindus and Muslims, high-caste 
and Harijans, and so forth. If the police and the administrative 
officials begin to do their duty according to caste and 
religion, it would hurt the democratic system. We believe that 
it is the duty of the administrators to cooperate with the 
government; however, a veteran politician like Chief Minister 
Mulayam Singh should not talk like this. He is fortunate in that 
the people of this state have recognized him as an effective and 
skilled administrator. He should remember that he has become 
chief minister because the Congress has supported him, the 
Janata Dal is also with him, and so are some other parties. A 
war can be fought based on the caste system; however, one cannot 
celebrate victory over this system. Mulayam Singh is chief 
minister of all groups. If a brahmin is poor, a landlord is 
poor, or a Hindu is poor, then will this "government of the 
poor" ignore them?

<F P=106> [Article by Ram Chandra Rahi: "The Main problem Is Not </F>
Cheating, Its the Educational System"] 
  [Text] It is being said in opposition to the directive on 
cheating on examinations that the whole education system would 
be ruined by this anti-cheating in examination law. It is being 
said in its support that the education of our students will be 
greatly enhanced. Is cheating on examinations the main problem 
in our educational system? Will this problem be resolved just by 
quickly stopping it, or by being soft about it? People who know 
about the problems in our education system and those with some 
basic understanding of the rules and regulations of our 
educational system may never recognize cheating on examinations 
as the root cause of our educational problems. 
  The fact is that since independence, we have been avoiding 
looking at the main problem of our educational system. We have 
been looking for some superficial resolutions. The main problem 
of our educational system is not cheating on examinations; it is 
the present educational system itself. It is a dreadful 
contradiction in our national life that in our independent 
India, the educational system of our slave days is still being 
implemented. All the educators who belong to Lord Macaulay's 
"family" are following this slave system of education 
continuously. They are even trying to strengthen it. This is an 
established circle which is sometimes altered on the surface. 
However, all the basic problems remain where they are. 
  The major problem with our educational system is that it is 
opposed to our personal, familial, social, and national life. It 
does not provide solutions to our problems; it has become a 
problem in itself. The students spend 18, 21, 25, and in some 
cases, as many as 30 years of the best years of their lives to 
earn this education. At the end, they get a certificate written 
on a piece of paper, which they hold in their hands as they 
wander around looking for employment. After years of wandering, 
they are lucky if they become a cog to fit in the present 
system. This only increases one more parasite in our society. If 
anyone still has good qualities, then despite this education, he 
still tries to remain a moral person and to do his job honestly. 
In most cases, one tries to take back one's educational 
investments with interest from the government and the society. 
This is because our present educational system does not teach 
morals and religion. This system does not even make them capable 
of becoming producers and creators to help build their lives, 
society, and the country. This education does not stir a desire 
in them to take risks, become an active citizen, break away from 
the life-style of slaves, and strive for creating an 
independent, democratic, and fair human organization. What will 
we gain by making these superficial changes in the examination 
system if we keep this educational structure? 
  When the main goal is to become a capable consumer at any 
cost and to earn money, and there is no hesitation in our 
society to do anything to achieve this goal, then expecting a 
student to be honest on the examinations that help him get the 
certificate is analogous to expecting the impossible. 
  If we look from one perspective, there should be no reason 
for a student to fail after working in school for a full year. 
If anyone should fail, it should be either the teacher or the 
guardians, or both of them. Why cannot we expect a student to 
achieve the expected goals after studying for a year? Do not the 
guardians or the teachers have any responsibility? 
  It is an accepted principle in sociology that a government 
is 
best when it is involved in administration the least. In other 
words, there should be a minimum number of law- and 
consequence-based rules in social life. The society should run 
by its own good deeds. Education is a process of awakening good 
morals in a person. When the last step of this educational 
process, these so-called examinations, is the punishment, the 
law, and the police all in itself, we have to think what goals 
can we achieve with this kind of education. What will our 
present and future generations learn? 
  Mulayam Singh Yadav has said that a committee of experts 
will 
be established to evaluate the present system and decide on a 
new educational system. This is a welcome announcement. Mulayam 
Singh has at least responded through this announcement to the 
accusations levied against him for "destroying the educational 
system." However, the basic question is not of the testing 
system; it is of the whole educational system. From the 
president to an average citizen, everyone believes, and has 
announced at one time or another, that the educational system 
needs an overhaul. Many commissions were established after 
independence, and nationwide discussions were also held. All the 
recommendations made by those commissions are still gathering 
dust somewhere. 
  The Kothari Commission had recommended some basic and 
preliminary steps. Implementation of these would have opened a 
new door for educational reform--for example, the elimination of 
the degree requirement for a job. When one finished an 
educational program, the administrator would simply write how 
long the student had been in the course of study, and at what 
level he or she finished. The employer invites a candidate to 
test his knowledge and abilities, and to provide employment. The 
basis of employment would move from getting the certificates to 
one's actual ability. The teacher will also have the pressure to 
teach on time and finish a level at a specific time. The Kothari 
Commission has recommended a specific school that promised equal 
employment opportunities to all citizens under the Constitution. 
This recommendation would help remove the economic discrepancy 
in the educational system. The Kothari Commission 
recommendations, however, are collecting dust in the 
government's records room, and our progress is being made in the 
area of education that prepares for various jobs, and in selling 
50 percent of these positions for money. 
  Why is it happening that even government-appointed 
commissions' recommendations are being put in cold storage? 
Public schools (the specialist of these schools is that the 
general public cannot get admission to them) are implementing 
the recommendations made by the Navoday school. In a country 
which claims to follow democracy and equality in society, 
education that irrigates the roots of differences in our society 
should not be encouraged. Why did not this question become a 
subject of the peoples' uprising? Why are the steps to 
implementing the anti-cheating law considered to be providing 
balance to education and its recall destructive to the whole 
education system? This is because we want to avoid getting to 
the root of this problem. 
  A veteran state leader and the education minister, who were 
criticizing the present educational system, were once asked by a 
Gandhian thinker and hard-working old man, "If everyone from you 
to the president are aware of the evils of the present 
educational system, then who is running this system?" The 
education ministers responded: "No one is running it. It runs by 
itself." This incident is about 27 to 28 years old. I would like 
to add to this comment: All those who have a vested interest in 
the present system are running it. These include bureaucrats, 
rich people, and leaders. Perhaps, to an extent, all of us who 
are not able to attain our goals, but who hope that they will 
have the opportunity to achieve them some day are part of this 
problem.

<F P=106> [Article by Amitabh Agnihotri: "Mulayam That Was Mulayam"] </F>
  [Text] On 4 January, Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav finished one 
month as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. In this short 
period of one month, signs indicate that Mulayam Singh Yadav, 
who is sitting in the chief minister's chair for the second 
time, appears to be politically more intelligent this time. He 
appears to be more capable of reading the sensitivity of the 
political climate now. It appears that he learned from his past 
mistakes and is standing on firmer ground. He has learned facts 
now after his hard work. 
  Mulayam Singh is known for his own personal political style. 
This is his asset and strength. This asset is still intact with 
him. One positive indication is that the bragging that had 
previously made him a victim of criticism, or the political 
equations that made him unsure of himself, is decreasing now. 
This is Mulayam Singh's changed image, who is cementing his 
friendship with Kanshi Ram. 
  Mulayam Singh, who was educated in the political school of 
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, has some special qualities which make him 
important in the state politics despite all the criticism and 
accusations levied against him. The new atmosphere that came 
into Indian politics with Rajiv Gandhi somewhat escaped Mulayam 
Singh. The fact that he had a Rajiv-supported government in the 
state for some time is a separate issue. Mulayam Singh never 
joined the political "suit and safari" culture. From the 
beginning until now, he is still a swadeshi Mulayam Singh. He 
never reduced his interests and relations with villagers, 
village meetings, and farms. 
  These very swadeshi connections that Mulayam Singh has have 
given him the self-confidence to take the great risk of jumping 
into the Vidhan Sabha elections in association with Kanshi Ram's 
Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). He ignored all the threats issued by 
the imams and propaganda issued by the Janata family, and 
insisted on his own friendly left-wing leaders. He took the risk 
of walking alone, and was successful because his feet were on 
the ground in this state, and his fingers were on the pulse of 
the people. 
  Therefore, Mulayam Singh turned a deaf ear toward them all 
and continued to walk. The political pundits wrote his political 
future before the election and made some forecasts. He was not 
affected by them, though. He says unofficially now, "Who 
believed that I would be able to form a government on my own? 
The people have given their decree now, though, and all their 
assumptions have failed." 
  Kanshi Ram has his own style. We cannot believe that Mulayam 
Singh is unaware of this style. Nor is it possible that he is 
not aware of Kanshi Ram's political activities. Still, the skill 
he showed in keeping their coalition in order to establish 
government in this state is the result of his changed attitude 
and his political savvy. If we had the Mulayam Singh of the 
past, then there would be a large number of people who believed 
that this coalition would not be successful in forming a 
government. 
  Kanshi Ram did not support the inclusion of his BSP in the 
state government. All he wanted was to support Mulayam Singh and 
to let him form the government. However, Mulayam Singh finally 
convinced him, and the BSP joined the government. This happened 
because he felt that it would be difficult to run a government 
with the BSP outside of it and not being responsible for the 
consequences. 
  His attitude toward Ayodhya and Dunkel is not extremist now. 
Until yesterday, he carried the flag of a one-sided opinion on 
both these issues. He is more in control now, though, and is 
neither fighting the central government on Dunkel, nor is he a 
spokesman for the mosque politics of Ayodhya. The political 
balance that Mulayam Singh demonstrated on both these burning 
questions at least shows that his past experience has made him 
mulayam' [mellow] and serious. This change in Mulayam Singh 
Yadav has occurred in several phases. He comments very carefully 
on any political question that affects the Uttar Pradesh 
political equation. He is becoming an expert on ignoring 
specific questions in a specific style. Questions related to his 
coalition party, the Bahujan Samaj Party, show his new style. He 
is fully aware of the situation that helped him get the chief 
minister's position in the state. He is always aware of the 
importance of his friendship with Kanshi Ram. He tries his best 
to ensure that he does not comment on the statement made by 
Kanshi Ram, the BSP chief. Kanshi Ram's comment, "I want an 
unstable government everywhere," only made Mr. Yadav smile. He 
later said, "You had better ask Kanshi Ram about it." On further 
questioning, he says that he said this about other places, not 
about Uttar Pradesh. We are fully stable in this state, he said. 
Mulayam Singh shows a lot of this type of political skill now. 
  He avoids making political comments because, as he said 
himself, people get confused. "When people spread confusion in 
the past, I stopped going to Delhi. If I come here, anyone I 
talk to gets confused." Who are the people who confuse the 
issue? He does not give any names. But he repeats many times 
that he is fully with Kanshi Ram now. 
  He calls what happened in the UP Vidhan Sabha on the first 
day of the session deplorable and inappropriate. Later, he tells 
the whole story off the record. 
  He hints that there should be no cheating on examinations, 
and that his government will take some important steps. In 
unofficial talks, he says, "You see, no one will be able to copy 
at all." 
  He gives some reasoning, off the record, in implementation 
of 
the Gunda Act. While mentioning the arrest of Chowdhery 
Manmohan, Mayavati, and his own brother, Ram Pal, under this 
act, he says, "Was using the Gunda Act to arrest Ram Pal legal?" 
He admits that this act was abused. 
  The political styles of Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna and Bir 
Bahadur Singh are discussed often in the state. Both these 
leaders had the political asset of being able to recognize even 
a minor political worker and meet him directly. Mulayam Singh is 
also driving his political vehicle on this path. That is why his 
party is behind him and he is leading it. What he has learned 
from Lohia and Charan Singh has helped him get the chief 
minister's chair now. His political history shows that whenever 
and wherever he had to stay behind his party, he could not stop 
himself for long.

<F P=106> [Article: "Violence in Manipur Led to Delhi Rule"] </F>
  [Text] Imphal, January 1. The direct involvement of some 
MLAs (Member of Legislative Assembly) and ministers in the 
ongoing Kuki-Naga clashes and the government's failure in 
tackling the deteriorating law and order situation, among other 
problems, led to the imposition of President's rule in Manipur 
yesterday, according to two outgoing cabinet ministers. 
  Requesting anonymity, the ex-ministers said that no one in 
the ministry thought seriously on how to tackle the insurgency 
that claimed over 450 lives in the last two years in the state. 
  But the outgoing deputy chief minister, Mr Rishang Keishing, 
said the imposition of President's rule would help the state 
government deal more effectively with the problems. There would 
now be no obstacle from any quarter, added Mr Keishing, a senior 
Congress leader. 
  However, Mr Keishing's view was not shared by the Manipur 
People's Party (MPP), a coalition partner in the Congress-led 
ministry. Disapproving the imposition of President's rule, Mr 
Kumarjit Singh, senior MPP leader and former deputy chairman of 
the state planning board, said that all problems could have been 
solved through discussion and political dialogue. 
  He held the popular ministry responsible for not taking 
steps 
to initiate a "meeting ground" of all ethnic groups. He said all 
tribal communities, including the Kukis and the Nagas, could 
have sorted out their problems and differences at such a forum. 
President's rule would not solve the problem, he added. 
  Meanwhile, intelligence sources pointed out that the Centre 
was disappointed at the utter failure of the state government to 
check the rising insurgency and the worsening of Kuki-Naga 
clashes in the five hill districts of the state. 
  The internal crisis in the Congress and the MPP, the two 
major partners in the five-party coalition, also resulted in 
difference of opinion among the senior cabinet minister, the 
sources said. The Centre was aware of this, they added. 
  Another factor hastening the Centre's decision was the 
banned 
National Socialist Council of Nagaland's warning to the Naga 
ministers and MLAs to resign by December 31. The Centre, 
however, did not succumb to the NSCN (National Socialist Council 
of Nagaland) pressure and imposed President's rule, a senior 
Congress member said. 
  The Centre was also aware of the case of missing uniforms 
worth over Rs 67 lakhs belonging to the Manipur Rifles and the 
involvement of the Manipur Rifles personnel in smuggling 
activities, the sources added. These cases were likely to be 
investigated by the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation), they 
added. 
  The insurgency had intensified recently with the worst-ever 
ambush on security personnel in June last year in which 24 army 
personnel were gunned down by Naga insurgents in the Tengnoupal 
area in Chandel district in Manipur. 
  Official sources said the security forces could not 
effectively operate in the trouble-torn areas because of 
"political interference."

<F P=106> [Article: "Bangarappa Floats New Party"; quotation marks as </F>
published] 
  [Text] Bangalore, Dec. 31. The former chief minister, Mr S. 
Bangarappa, today said his new regional party, the Karnataka 
Congress, proposed to contest all the assembly seats in the 
elections. He however, added that the issue of having seat 
adjustments with political parties such as the Janata Dal was 
still open. 
  Addressing a news conference here to announce the formal 
launching of his party, Mr Bangarappa said a decision on the 
party aligning with other political parties would be taken by 
the parliamentary board of the party, adding that he could not 
make any announcement suo motu. "As of today the Karnataka 
Congress plans to field candidates in all the assembly 
questions. However, I will keep the matter of seat adjustment 
open," he added. 
  Mr Bangarappa maintained that his party was the real 
Congress 
as the Congress under the present leadership of the Prime 
Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, had failed to uphold the 
principles and ideologies laid down by the founding fathers of 
the party. 
  Mr Bangarappa said the response from the people to his new 
regional party was overwhelming. This was one of the reasons for 
him to advance his earlier programme of launching his party in 
April in Davangere at a public meeting apart from the fact that 
there was a possibility of the zilla and taluk panchayat 
elections being announced any moment. 
  Mr Bangarappa admitted that many regional and national 
parties launched in the past were a failure. However the latest 
trend was of regional parties and he was optimistic of a bright 
future for his party. 
  To a question whether the Samajwadi and Bahujan Samaj party 
combine parties success in Uttar Pradesh had prompted him to 
launch a regional party, Mr Bangarappa replied in the negative 
and said there was no need for him to go so far when regional 
parties such as the AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra 
Kazhagam) and the Telugu Desam had clicked in the neighbouring 
states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. 
  On the decision to field candidates in all the assembly 
constituencies and whether the purpose was to defeat the 
Congress or ensure the victory of the new party's candidates, Mr 
Bangarappa quipped: "Suppose the same members had continued in 
the Congress headed by Mr Rao, do you think they would have won? 
It is not a question of victory or defeat for the Karnataka 
Congress but a matter of principles." 
  Mr Bangarappa, however, made it clear that tickets would not 
be given to those who would want to contest from his party after 
they are denied a ticket from the Congress. 
  Mr Bangarappa said he would be launching his campaign by 
touring the districts from January 10. This would also help him 
to gauge the situation regarding his party position vis-vis the 
other parties. 
  Mr Bangarappa said he would be the president of the party 
till a president was elected in a democratic manner. Ad hoc 
executive and parliamentary committees would be formed shortly, 
he added. 
  He said since his party was based on the principles and 
programmes of the traditional Congress. It would have the 
Congress flag and `get the symbol allotted by the election 
commission.' 
  Mr Bangarappa, also demanded the resignation of the Prime 
Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, on the alleged involvement of 
his family members in the multi-crore securities scam. 
  He said the Prime Minister had said that follow-up action on 
the report of the Joint Parliamentary committee which went into 
the securities scam would be taken up within three months. Since 
the names of the family members of the Prime Minister figured in 
the report, Mr Rao had no right to order any follow-up action, 
he added.

  Investment from the UK rose from Rs 32.1 crores in 1991 to 
Rs 
117.67 crores in 1992 and to Rs 608.69 crores in 1993. There has 
also been an increase in investment from Germany, Switzerland, 
the Netherlands, France, Japan and Singapore. 
  Similarly, non-resident Indians (NRI) investments rose from 
Rs 19.7 crores in 1991 to Rs 439.13 crores in 1992 and Rs 682.14 
crores during the first 11 months of 1993. 
  More than 90 per cent of the total investments approved have

<F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakravarty: "Manmohan Singh's Economic </F>
Policies and the New Economic Colonialism"] 
  [Text] The way the discussions in the Parliament were 
changed adroitly into reverential praise for Manmohan Singh 
after the tight control over the Joint Parliamentary Committee's 
[JPC] report was issued, made one suspect that his resignation 
was a drama staged to stop the attacks on his and his ministry's 
liberal trade policies in the context of the Pratibhuti fraud 
case. It was natural for one to hope that the government would 
show some alertness and efforts would be made to save the nation 
from negative outcomes of the open market policy. However, it 
appears that the government has learned a very different lesson 
after protecting it from the fire test of the Joint 
Parliamentary Committee (JPC) questioning. 
  Here is one example. The announcement to transfer State Bank 
chief G.B. Ramakrishna to Planning Commission was an open 
submission of the finance ministry to the stock exchange 
broker's demands. Why did this happen? It happened because these 
brokers opposed Mr. Ramakrishna's efforts to control and 
restrain the anarchy in trading and laundering black money in 
the stock market. The warning given by Mr. Ramniwas Mirdha, the 
head of the JPC, was accurate and timely. He had said that, "It 
was important to implement strict guidelines while economic 
reforms are carried out. Otherwise, there would be unlimited and 
uncontrollable grief." He had made it clear that due to the lack 
of monitoring system in the economic system, the open market 
approach might result in something like the Pratibhuti fraud. We 
need to remember the fact in this context that the JPC had 
approved all the State Bank activities carried out under 
Ramakrishna's leadership. 
  In this context, removal of Ramakrishna from the State Bank 
gives birth to the fear that the government is giving us wrong 
signals and that signal is that the government will try to 
appease the brokers even at the cost of losing investments. This 
is the pre-experience of these reforms that will be implemented 
in economic and banking areas and about which the finance 
minister and the prime minister had assured us in the Parliament. 
  Within one week after the debate on the JPC report in the 
Parliament, the cabinet exposed another side of the Manmohan 
Singh economics. He had assured six foreign investors that they 
will make profits in electricity area. This has not been done 
since the East India Company. At that time, arrangements were 
made to make sure that the British investors make profit in the 
British-owned railways system. No one has benefitted from such 
an extraordinary exemption since then. This government action 
will not only be called an act to remove all the hurdles faced 
by foreign investors but will be counted as an exemption given 
to foreign investors that was never made available to our own 
industries. 
  This action clearly indicates a special preference for 
foreign investments in the Manmohan Singh economics. This should 
be called a major discrepancy in our country's economic 
strategy. Under the present system, internationalization means 
unequal treatment of foreign and Indian investments, and special 
partisanship toward foreign investors. This bias in which 
foreign investments are favored over internal investments can 
definitely be called a new form of economic colonialism. The 
economic reasoning given in support of this action cannot 
deceive the people now. It is said that the government will be 
more able to invest money in social programs with the foreign 
investments. This argument is totally dishonest because the 
assurance of profit given to the foreign investors will require 
cutting development money from the state in question. First, the 
foreign investors have been promised 16 percent profit and this 
will be paid in dollars. Second, the electricity generated by 
these foreign companies will not cost less then three rupees per 
unit, which is three times more expensive than the one rupee 
rate at present. It is clear that in order to make the promised 
16 percent profit to the foreign investors, they will exploit 
the state government on the one side and on the other side, the 
consumers will have to bear the burden of 300 percent increase 
in electricity price. 
  In the light of these facts, it is clear that the government 
is avoiding telling the people the real meaning of government's 
submission in front of the foreign companies. Any democratic 
government is expected to present such a proposal for approval 
at the legislative level as it calls for a major change in 
policy. This main change is not about the question of open 
market, but of giving special treatment to foreign investors. 
These are special privileges which have not been provided to 
internal investors. Heavy dependence on foreign debts is on one 
side and assurance of profit to foreign investors is on the 
other side. Do we need to do anything else to mortgage our 
country's economic future? The JPC has clearly established that 
foreign banks have played a decisive role in both the Pratibhuti 
fraud and the stock market fraud. In such a situation, any 
self-respecting government is expected to take action against 
these foreign banks to stop their mischievous act. The finance 
minister had also promised during the debate on the JPC report 
in the House that he will not allow these banks to take away the 
profits made in the Pratibhuti fraud case. However, the finance 
ministry has not taken any concrete step to regulate the 
activities of these foreign banks operating here. It would be 
foolish to expect the finance ministry to take action against 
the banks operating here because of its favorable leaning toward 
these banks. Keeping in mind its leaning and its record, we can 
expect it to support and defend the foreign banks at any cost. 
The finance ministry under the leadership of Manmohan Singh has 
set its mind to help the interests of foreign investors over 
protecting our country's interests and self-respect. 
  In this atmosphere of derogatory and insulting submission to 
foreign investors, the finance ministry has opened another area 
to foreign investors through the Malhotra Commission report in 
which privatization of insurance industry has been lauded. The 
social goals inherent in nationalization of the Life Insurance 
Corporation soon will be forgotten. After implementing this 
plan, the next target of Dr. Manmohan Singh definitely will be 
the banks. After privatization of these banks, the work of 
driving another nail in the coffin of mixed economy will be 
complete. At this rate, the railways should also be in the list 
of privatization, and if this happens, the foreign investors 
will be receiving a major award. If the public sector is facing 
this fate, why should we deprive the maharajahs of their privy 
purses? 
  During this time, some indications of the worries that our 
economic system will cause have surfaced. The average rate of 
industrial growth is stuck at 2 percent for the last three 
years. This rate during the 80s was 8 or 9 percent. The rate of 
growth of investment property is at the level of 12 percent. 
There has been no significant increase in the earnings from 
imports. The praise of our finance minister being lavished by 
national and foreign investors cannot assure whether his 
February budget will be welcomed warmly. It is possible that the 
major investors will be given new tax incentives, but what will 
be done for the masses who make the majority of our democracy? 
If Manmohan Singh tries to implement his policy for which he has 
expressed his commitment to the World Bank, he would be putting 
the existence of this government in danger.

<F P=106> [Article: "Software Error Led to PSLV Failure, Says Probe"] </F>
  [Text] Bangalore, Jan. 3. The Failure Analysis Committee 
(FAC), constituted to look into the cause of failure of the 
first development flight of PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch 
Vehicle) (PSLV-D1) which took place on September 20, has 
submitted its report to the Chairman, Indian Space Research 
Organisation (ISRO). 
  The national level committee, chaired by Mr. N. Pant, member 
of the Space Commission, included experts from academic and 
R&amp;D 
institutions in the country, besides ISRO. The analysis and the 
recommendations were reviewed in detail by Prof. U.R. Rao, 
Chairman, ISRO along with senior experts from both within and 
outside ISRO. 
  Based on the analysis of the extensive telemetry data from 
the flight, the committee has confirmed that all the major 
systems, which had been integrated in the PSLV, including the 
giant solid booster and the liquid propulsion systems flight 
tested for the first time, had worked as planned and that there 
were no serious lacunae in the design of the vehicle: PSLV-D1 
would have achieved the intended orbit but for a minor 
deficiency. 
  The committee has said the failure of PSLV-D1 to reach the 
intended orbit was primarily due to a software error in the 
pitch control loop of the onboard guidance and control 
processor, which occurs only when the control command exceeds 
the specified maximum limiting value. 
  The present limit value was exceeded due to the disturbances 
experienced during transition between the second and third 
stages of the rocket. These disturbances were caused by the 
programmed gimbal pulling of the second stage, 3.7 seconds 
before the ignition of the third stage, leaving the disturbances 
during the above period of the second stage tail-off 
uncorrected. Also the failure of two small retro rockets led to 
a contact between second and third stages, during the separation 
of the second stage. The committee has further said that in 
spite of the disturbances, the PSLV rocket design is so rugged 
that it would have reached the intended orbit but for the 
software error. 
  The major recommendations of the committee, consequently are 
to rectify the software implementation error and to delay the 
pulling of the second stage by about 2.0 50 2.5 seconds. 
[sentence as published] The committee has said that the 
deficiencies noted and the modifications suggested are quite 
normal for the first few developmental flights of a large 
complex system like PSLV and ISRO should have no difficulty in 
operationalising the PSLV launch vehicle very soon. 
  Preparations have begun for the next developmental flight of 
PSLV targeted for the third quarter of 1994, after implementing 
the committee's recommendations.

  [Text] Tehran--IRNA. 7 Dey [28 December] The Japanese 
Ministry of Justice announced that during the two months of 
September and October (10 Shahrivar to 10 Aban) 272 Iranians 
were expelled from Japan for the crime of illegal employment. 
  The Associated Press reports that during these two months 
police agents raided Iranian worker gathering places in Tokyo 
and other large cities in Japan and expelled 2,697 foreign 
workers, including 999 women. 
  Most of the statistics on expelled workers pertain to Thai 
citizens (632 people). Iranians, with a total of 372 [as 
published], are the fourth-largest group of expelled foreigners. 
  In the year 1991 A.D., of the 32,908 foreigners expelled 
from 
Japan for illegal employment, 7,700 were Iranian. At the same 
time, a small number of Japanese citizens oppose the Tokyo 
government's policy of expelling foreign workers and they 
consider it to be a kind of selfishness. 
  Several days ago 100 Japanese demonstrated asking the 
government to permit foreigners to work in order to obtain cheap 
manpower, and not to expel them.

  [Text] Tehran--KEYHAN News Service. 4 Dey [25 December] 
Continuing Iran's food and drug aid to 100,000 Azeri refugees 
residing in the border area between Iran and Azerbaijan at the 
Imeshli Camp, a new field hospital will be opened at this camp 
by Iran. 
  KEYHAN's correspondents sent to Baku report that the Iran 
Red 
Crescent Society will pay all the costs of building and starting 
this hospital, and in addition an eight-person medical team has 
been sent to the Imam Hoseyn Camp in this area to provide health 
care and treatment services to the refugees. 
  In discussing their observations at the Azeri refugee camps, 
the Iranian physicians announced: The spread of skin diseases 
among the Azeri refugees is seriously threatening the lives of 
thousands of innocent people. 
  Radio Baku reported that thousands of Azeri refugees have 
been infected with skin diseases. Quoting an Iranian physician, 
it said: The lack of field bath houses, hot water, washing and 
cleaning materials and the failure to observe the principles of 
hygiene are considered to be among the causes for the spread of 
these diseases. 
  According to Radio Baku, despite the ceaseless efforts of 
Iran's medical teams at the camps, due to the failure to receive 
international aid, Azeri war victims are not in good health and 
are suffering from diseases such as malnutrition, pneumonia, and 
chlorosis.

  [Text] London--IRNA--14 Dey--4 January--Commercial 
exchanges between Iran and England declined significantly last 
year and in this process the English suffered losses because 
along with the reduction in Iran's imports from England, Iran's 
exports to this country doubled. 
  Based on the latest statistics published by the English 
Ministry of Commercial Industries, the value of the commercial 
exchanges between this country and Iran in the first 10 months 
of 1993, 9 Dey 1371 to Mehr 1372 [30 December 1992 to September 
1993], declined 44 percent, decreasing in value from 
&pound;[pound 
sterling]1.152 billion to &pound;643 million. 
  During the same period Iran's exports to England increased 
from &pound;116 million to &pound;226 million, a growth of 95 
percent, 
while Iran's imports from England declined 15 percent, 
decreasing from &pound;489 million to &pound;417 million. 
Consequently, Iran's trade deficit with England decreased in the 
first 10 months of 1992 from about &pound;372 million to 
&pound;191 
million. 
  The increase in Iran's food exports to England is one of the 
most important factors in the improvement of Iran's balance of 
trade with this country. Another factor in the improvement of 
Iran's balance of trade with England is the increase in the 
volume of oil exports to this country. In the first six months 
of 1992 the value of these exports was about &pound;50 million, 
while in the first six months of the year 1993 it was more than 
$125 million.

  [Text] Following widespread reports on the arrest of 'Abbas 
'Abdi, a member of SALAM's editorial council and recent remarks 
by Yazdi, chief of the judicial power concerning the immediate 
investigation of this matter, Hojjat ol-Eslam Ra'isi, Islamic 
revolutionary prosecutor, gave a press conference in Tehran on 5 
Aban [27 October] in which he made some very interesting points 
on this matter. In this interview he made ridiculous claims 
about the Islamic Republic's defense of freedom of the press. 
For example, he said: We believe in freedom of the press, 
freedom of the pen, freedom of speech, and the freedoms that are 
in the law. We believe that the sacred sanctuary of the press 
must be preserved, and those who disrupt this sacred sanctuary 
will be dealt with. This dealing is not by any means with the 
press, but is for the purpose of strengthening freedom of the 
pen. 
  He then discussed 'Abdi's arrest, the relationship between 
this arrest and freedom of the press, and the question of what 
this person's crime really was. Among other things, he said: "It 
is not clear how correct this is in the eye of public opinion. 
His crimes will certainly be discussed when it is appropriate, 
and when necessary he will go to trial..." 
  Mr. Ra'isi was asked repeatedly by various correspondents 
about what his crime really is, whether the accusations are only 
for the press or otherwise and why they have kept him in 
solitary confinement for 66 days without allowing visitors. He 
was not willing to give a proper answer. He only emphasized: 
"Because his crime was not announced, it is not known to you, 
but his crime is known clearly to the revolutionary prosecutor. 
However, concerning the manner of dealing with it, including 
visitors, detention and interrogation, you certainly must know 
that the legal regulations will be observed for him the same as 
they are for other defendants." 
  In other words, based on the laws the security organizations 
of the Islamic Republic act upon, the defendant is savagely 
tortured to the point of death. He "confesses" to crimes not 
committed and then goes to "court." In view of the fact that in 
violation of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic the 
defendant is imprisoned for a long period without access to a 
defense lawyer, talk of "defense of freedoms," and by one of the 
regime's agents at that, can be nothing more than a horrifying 
joke. 
  In any case, what can be said right now is that Engineer 
'Abdi's friends are conducting behind the scenes negotiations to 
free him, and with the results of these negotiations it will be 
clear whether he will be freed or whether he will "confess" to 
crimes he did not commit, like tens of other victims.

  [Text] Hamadan. JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI. The minister of 
construction jihad in a session introducing the new head of the 
Construction Jihad of Hamadan Province said: Of the gross 
national product [GNP], 27 percent is from the agricultural 
sector. 
  Mr. Foruzesh in this session referred to the present 
situation of the country and the various tricks of the enemies 
to weaken the revolution and, emphasizing conservation in all 
areas, said: The leader has considered the presence of the 
clerics in the jihad for the purpose of advice, encouragement, 
and guidance of jihad members very necessary and said that 
clerics representing the religious guardian must seriously avoid 
interfering in executive affairs. 
  The minister of construction jihad pointed out the 
importance 
of the agricultural sector and said: The agricultural sector 
accounts for 27 percent of the GNP, and of 13 million jobs in 
the country more than 3 million are in the agricultural sector. 
  In regards to support for domestic products, he said: Of the 
225,000 tons of projected imported meat in the Plan, less than 
70,000 tons have been imported. At the same time, in the course 
of the Plan, the meat production capacity of the country has 
increased from 520,000 tons to 625,000 tons, which is a 
19-percent growth, and it is anticipated that this figure will 
reach 750,000 tons by the end of the Second Plan. 
  He said: Also, the production of chicken has increased from 
300,000 tons to 520,000 tons, a 73-percent increase, which by 
the end of the Second Plan will reach 800,000 tons. 
  Stating that the ban on cheese imports has prevented the 
import of 20,000 tons of cheese, he called this a step toward 
support of the dairy industries and said: Rumors concerning 
domestic cheese causing disease are absolutely baseless; the 
safety of domestic cheese has been verified by related experts. 
  Mr. Foruzesh also referring to the accomplishments in 
regards 
to revitalization of natural resources and forest planting in 
the province of Hamadan, considered these actions very 
important, and stating that a significant amount of funds has 
been projected for the province of Hamadan for next year, he 
praised and thanked the governor general and other officials of 
this province for their efforts and attention. 
  In conclusion, the minister of construction jihad introduced 
Mr. Amir as the new head of the Construction Jihad of Hamadan 
Province and praised Mr. Safa'i, the previous supervisor, for 
his hard work. 
  Our correspondent's report indicates that in the 
continuation 
of this session, which was held in the presence of Mr. Sadatian, 
the deputy of the people of Hamadan in the Majles, several

  [Text] Rasht (IRNA) - Oil Minister Gholam-Reza Aqazadeh 
said last Saturday that Iran produces four million barrels of 
oil per day, while production of natural gas stands at 110m 
cubic meters. 
  For the time being, he said, 12m Iranians use gas for 
domestic purposes. 
  Currently 180 towns and cities in Iran have been supplied 
with city gas and another 20 towns and cities are to have tapped 
gas by late March this year, he added. 
  Aqazadeh was speaking in the Astaneh Ashrafiyeh town in this 
Caspian Sea province where he inaugurated a piped gas network 
for the towns of Roudsar, Siahkal, Koumeleh and Astaneh 
Ashrafiyeh.

tons 
of petrochemical products have been produced in Iran and this

  The oil minister predicted that by the end of the Second 
National Development Plan the nation would earn between 
Rls.[rials] 2,500 to 3,000b in foreign revenue for the sale of 
petrochemical products which will mean a saving in dollar 
expenditures of between 2.5 and 3b.

  [Text] Mr. Golestaneh, deputy director of the Ministry of 
Mines and Metals' Office of Mines Exploration, announced in 
Tehran: Since the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan more 
than 90 percent of the government's mines have been transferred 
to cooperatives, legal entities and real individuals and 
relevant industries. Based on the same report, in the first six 
months of the current year [21 March-23 September 1993] 338,000 
tons of ores valued at $22 million and various types of 
concentrated metals valued at $320 million have been exported. 
In the same interview Golestaneh added that the number of 
exploitable mines in the country increased from 800 at the 
beginning of the First Five-Year Plan to 1,400 mines at the 
present time. 
  In this interview Mr. Golestaneh did not announce what mines 
were transferred to the nongovernment sector. In recent years it 
has been the policy of the Islamic Republic to auction the 
nation's mines without proper planning to make real use of the 
nation's natural resources, which are considered the wealth of 
our people.

  [Text] Tehran. KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News Service-- 15 Dey [5 
January] The deputy minister of guidance for parliamentary 
affairs gave an interview to KEYHAN's correspondent in which he 
discussed the provision of the death penalty for producers of 
immoral films. He said: Only those who are the main agents in 
the production, reproduction or distribution of films showing 
nude women and men or sexual relations and who have been 
arrested three times for this crime will be called corrupt on 
the earth and condemned to death. 
  'Ezzatollah Zarghami, deputy minister of guidance for 
parliamentary affairs, discussed the conditions for issuing a 
death sentence for these kinds of criminals. He added: The Law 
Increasing Penalties for Producers, Distributors, and 
Reproducers of Unauthorized Videotapes and Images, recently 
passed by the Majles, states clearly that the death penalty 
applies those who knowingly do this, using the resources of 
international networks and with the goal of society's moral 
deviation. 
  In this regard he explained: In our view people like this 
are 
no different than narcotics smugglers and those take armed 
action to destroy the government of the Islamic Republic. 
  In answer to the negative propaganda by some media from 
Western nations concerning the law increasing penalties for 
those involved in the production, reproduction, and distribution 
of vulgar films, he said: As long as the Western nations trample 
the primary principles of freedom and democracy and will not 
even tolerate the presence of four veiled girls in their 
schools, they are in no position to dictate the observance of 
human rights to other societies. 
  According to the deputy minister of guidance for 
parliamentary affairs, based on the law approved by the Majles, 
individuals who use children for the storage, sale and 
reproduction of tapes of immoral films will also be subject to 
the prescribed penalties. 
  Likewise, secondary agents involved in the distribution of 
tapes of this kind will be sentenced under the law to cash fines 
and prison terms. 
  Zarghami was asked: "In the end, are video tapes authorized 
or not?" In answer he emphasized the need for planning for 
proper use of videos and added: At the same time, because of the 
sensitivity of the matter, there must be controls in place to 
prevent abuses in this area. 
  He discussed the decision by the Ministry of Guidance to 
authorize the establishment of "Video Societies" in the cities. 
Concerning the requirements for obtaining this authorization, he 
said: Great care is being exercised in the selection of 
qualified individuals among the applicants to establish video 
centers. In this regard priority goes to reputable revolutionary 
individuals who are basijis, veterans and members of families of 
martyrs. According to Zarghami, video tapes have already been 
produced and made ready for distribution of 100 films of various 
kinds.

<F P=106> [Interview with Fathi 'Abd-al-Baqi, tax authority chairman, </F>
by 'Ala'-al-Din Mustafa; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Now that unified tax law No. 187 of 1993 has been 
promulgated, its provisions will go into effect as of 1 January 
1994. A major question arises here: How will this law apply to 
wages and the like? 
  AKHIR SA'AH has interviewed Muhammad Fathi 'Abd-al-Baqi, 
first undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance and Tax 
Authority chairman, and addressed to him this and other 
important questions: What are taxable revenues? What are the 
exemptions listed by the law? What about pensions? The interview 
has asked these and numerous other questions. 
  To start, Fathi 'Abd-al-Baqi pointed out that the unified 
tax 
law will be implemented as of January 1994. This law was issued 
to amend some provisions of income tax law No. 157 of 1981. With 
the promulgation of the unified tax law, the general income tax, 
with all its pros and cons, has been abolished. Moreover, the 
unified tax has alleviated the tax burden for employees. An 
employee with a gross income from his job amounting to 800 
pounds monthly will not be subject to any tax, meaning that 
nearly 9,600 pounds will not be taxable. 
  Moreover, pensioners will not be subject to the tax. 
'Abd-al-Baqi also pointed out that the executive regulations 
will be issued within three months as of the date of publication 
of the law in the Official Gazette. 
  [Mustafa] How will the income tax on salaries and the like 
be 
calculated under the unified tax law? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] The Tax Authority has issued circular No. 1 
of 
1994 on the provisions governing salaries and the like in law 
No. 187 of 1993, which amends some provisions of the income tax 
law promulgated by law No. 157 of 1981. The circular states that 
the provisions of this law shall apply to salaries and the like 
as of 1 January 1994. 
  As for applying provisions of the law, this law has 
maintained all the objective and executive regulations and 
procedures enacted in the income tax law promulgated by law No. 
157 of 1981 on salaries and the like, adding to them the 
following: 

  -  Law No. 187 of 1993 treats non-shareholder members and 
chairmen of the executive boards of the public business sector 
companies the same as members and chairman of executive boards 
of public sector companies, subjecting the salaries and bonuses 
they receive to the provisions governing salaries and the like 
in accordance with paragraph 4 of article 49. Meanwhile, the law 
treats shareholder chairmen and members the same as chairmen and 
members of executive boards of private sector joint-stock 
companies, subjecting their salaries, bonuses, and the like to 
the provisions of the "movable capital revenues" in accordance 
with the stipulation of paragraph 11 of article 6. The law also 
subjects salaries and the like collected by commissioned 
executive board chairmen and members to the provisions governing 
"salaries and the like," up to 5,000 pounds and in accordance 
with the conditions and rules established in paragraph 5 of 
article 49. Any sum in excess of 5,000 pounds will be subjected 
to the tax on the movable capital revenues. 
  -  It has included in the tax vessel any hazardous work 
allowance 
exceeding 480 pounds, not 240 pounds, and any representation 
allowance exceeding 2,500 pounds, not 3,000 pounds. 
  -  The law releases completely the exemption established for the 
wages of daily workers, provided that they are not employed 
permanently and that they have no source of income other than 
their daily wages. 
  -  It establishes for wage earners and the like a personal 
exemption of 2,000 pounds annually, plus the 10-percent 
deduction established for earning the income. 
  -  It establishes a new exemption for free or reduced-price 
tickets given by transportation companies, whether airlines or 
maritime companies, [to their workers]. 
  -  The law exempts wage earners from submitting the annual tax 
statement stipulated in article 91 for wages and the like. It 
also exempts them from listing such salaries and the like in the 
said statement, even if they have other income elements, such as 
commercial and industrial activity revenues and real estate 
wealth revenues. 
  -  It raises the exemption limit established by law No. 157 of 
1981 for family burdens, increasing it as follows in accordance 
with article 88: 
  1. A total of 1,440 pounds annually for a single taxpayer. 
  2. A total of 1,680 pounds annually for a married person who 
supports no children or an unmarried person who supports one or 
more children. 
  3. A total of 1,920 pounds annually for a married person 
supporting one or more children. 
<H5>  New Provisions </H5>
  The law has also added the following provisions: 

  -  It has raised the maximum age of a dependent son or 
daughter to 28 years, if the dependent is a student in any 
educational phase, regardless of whether university education or 
otherwise. 
  -  It considers either parent a dependent if the taxpayer is 
actually their sole supporter. 

    The law has also made the following taxable: 

  -  Sums paid to foreign experts employed for no more than 183 
days annually, regardless of whether consecutive or interspersed 
days. 
  -  Sums collected by taxable employees from parties other than 
their original employers, as stipulated in article 52. 
  In both cases, the tax applies to these sums without any 
deduction, whether for living or family burdens. The tax rate 
will be 20 percent for any sums up to 50,000 pounds and 32 
percent for any sums in excess of 50,000. 
<H5>  Taxable Revenues </H5>
  [Mustafa] What revenues are taxable? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Article 49 of the law defines them clearly. 
The tax applies to the following revenues: 

  -  Salaries and the like, wages, bonuses, and lifelong 
revenues, excluding insurance dues, which are paid to any 
person, regardless of whether living in Egypt or abroad, by the 
Egyptian Government, by local government units, by public 
authorities and other public persons, and by funds governed by 
law No. 54 of 1975, issuing the private insurance funds law, and 
by law No. 64 of 1980 concerning alternative private social 
security funds. 
  -  Salaries and the like, wages, bonuses, and lifelong revenues, 
"excluding pensions," paid by private companies, establishments, 
and organizations and by educational institutes and individuals 
to any person living in Egypt and to any person living abroad 
for services rendered in Egypt. 
  -  Salaries and bonuses of chairmen and members of public sector 
companies' executive boards. 
  -  Salaries and bonuses of non-shareholder chairmen and members 
of 
executive boards of public business sector companies. 
  -  Sums collected for administrative work by: 
  A. Executive board chairmen and members commissioned to join 
the executive boards of private sector joint-stock companies, 
provided that their contribution to the company capital doesn't 
exceed the limit set as a condition for executive board 
membership. 
  B. Directors of private sector joint-stock companies whose 
contribution to the company capital doesn't exceed the limit 
required by the law for executive board membership. 
  Under all circumstances, it is conditional that no more than 
four persons defined by name in each company shall benefit from 
this provision, and only within the limits of 5,000 pounds 
annually per person, regardless of whether the sum is a fixed 
sum, a percentage of the net profit, or something else. 
<H5>  Settlement of Taxes Due </H5>
  (Fathi 'Abd-al-Baqi added) as for the revenues included in 
the tax vessel, they are defined by the following articles: 
  Article 50. Revenues included in the tax vessel shall be 
determined for every part of the year in which any taxable 
revenue is obtained according to the duration of this part and 
on the basis of the monthly revenue, after it is converted into 
annual revenue. 
  In case change occurs in the taxable revenue, the 
calculation 
of this revenue shall be amended as of the date of the change on 
the basis of the new revenue, after it is converted into annual 
revenue. 
  As for accrued salaries and the like, wages, and bonuses 
that 
are paid in a lump sum in a certain year, the accrued sum shall 
be divided over the accrual years, the revenues included in the 
tax vessel shall be recalculated for each year, and taxes due 
shall be settled on this basis. 
  Article 51. Excluding the stipulation of paragraph 8 of 
article 6 of this law, taxable revenues shall be determined in 
the manner shown below on the basis of the total salaries, 
wages, recompense, bonuses, allowances, lifelong 
revenues--excluding pensions--and cash and in-kind benefits 
obtained by the taxpayer: 
  First, the tax shall not apply to the representation 
allowance or entertainment allowance unless it exceeds 2,500 
pounds annually, provided that the allowance doesn't exceed the 
original salary, recompense, or wages and that no exemptions 
established in accordance with special laws are violated. 
  Second, the tax shall not apply to sums collected by workers 
as production incentives, provided that the incentives are 
within the limits of 100 percent the original salary, 
recompense, or wages and that they don't exceed 3,000 pounds 
annually. 
  [Third], in applying the provisions of this law the 
following 
shall be considered production incentives: 
  A. Sums paid by the government, local government units, 
public authorities, and public sector companies and units as 
production incentives in accordance with the laws and 
regulations governing such incentives. 
  B. Sums paid by private sector establishments governed by 
the 
provisions of this law to increase production or to enhance 
their service level, provided that they are paid in accordance 
with regulations issued on a decree by the minister of finance, 
after consultation with the minister of manpower. 
  Fourth, the tax shall not apply to cash or in-kind housing 
allowance obtained by foreign experts who are taxable in 
accordance with the rate established in article 90 of this law 
and by Egyptians who work in land reclamation and development 
projects and in mining projects and who are subject to the 
aforementioned tax rate. 
  Fifth, sums collected by representatives of the regional 
offices of foreign companies and establishments in Egypt shall 
not be taxable, except for the equivalent of their activity in 
Egypt. 
  In all cases, the total sum of the hazardous work, 
representation, and entertainment allowances and production 
incentives exempted from the tax in accordance with the 
aforementioned paragraphs of this article may not exceed 4,000 
pounds annually. 
  Article 52. The tax shall apply to sums paid to foreign 
experts, regardless of the agency or authority employing them to 
perform services under its control, provided that they are not 
employed for more than 183 consecutive or interspersed days 
annually. The tax shall apply to these sums without any 
deduction for living or family burdens. 
  The tax shall also apply to sums that taxable workers of the 
state's administrative apparatus units, local government, public 
authorities, public sector units, public business sector, and 
workers treated in accordance with special cadres collect on top 
of their salaries from any ministry, public authority, 
administrative agency, local government, public sector, and 
business sector unit that is not their original employer. These 
sums shall be taxable without any reduction for living or family 
burdens. 
  In all cases, the tax shall be withheld and then remitted to 
the tax commission concerned within the first 15 days of each

determined by the executive regulations. 
<H5>  Tax Exemption </H5>
  [Mustafa] What are the tax exemptions and do they include 
social security and life insurance subscriptions? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Tax exemptions are determined by the law and 
they are explicitly stated in the following articles: 
  Article 54. The following shall be exempted from the tax: 
  A. Social security subscriptions and savings installments 
deducted in accordance with the social security laws, in 
accordance with alternative systems, or in accordance with 
government pension and savings laws. 
  B. Workers' subscriptions to private insurance funds 
established in accordance with the provisions of law No. 54 of 
1975. 
  C. Life and health insurance installments paid by the 
taxpayer for himself and for his wife and underage children. 
  For cases B and C, it is conditional that the total deducted 
by the taxpayer may not exceed 15 percent of the net income or 
1,000 pounds, whichever is the lesser of the two. The same 
installments and subscriptions may not be deducted from other 
revenues listed in article 5 of this law. 
  D. Lifelong incomes paid by insurance companies for 
insurance 
policies of a duration of no less than 10 years. 
  Article 55. Ten percent of the total taxable income, plus a 
sum of 2,000 pounds, shall be deducted for income-earning 
expense, after subtracting the subscriptions and sums listed in 
paragraphs A, B, and C of article 54 of this law and before 
subtracting the deduction established for family burdens in 
accordance with article 88 of this law. 
  Article 56. Free or reduced-rate travel permits and tickets 
and free furniture transportation coupons granted by the Public 
Railroads Authority to their workers and their families for 
purposes not connected with the service shall be exempted from 
the tax. 
  Free or reduced-rate tickets which Egyptian or foreign land 
transportation companies, airlines, or maritime companies 
operating in Egypt grant to their workers and their families 
shall also be exempted. 
  The above is in addition to the exemption established for 
family burdens by articles 88 and 89 of this law. 
<H5>  Requirements for Statement Submission </H5>
  [Mustafa] What are the tax rates? Are wage earners required 
to submit the annual unified tax statement? What about appeal 
and contestation procedures? 
  ['Abd-al-Baqi] Regarding salaries and similar revenues 
listed 
in section three of this book, the tax rate applying to them 
will be 20 percent for sums up to 50,000 pounds and 32 percent 
for sums in excess of 50,000 pounds. 
  Article 62 of this law states the following: "A taxpayer 
shall be exempted from submitting the statement stipulated in 
article 91 of this law for his income from wages and similar 
revenues listed in this section. The taxpayer shall also be 
exempted from listing the aforementioned income in the statement 
he submits in accordance with article 91 of this law for other 
sources of income." 
  Article 65 of this law states that "within one month as of 
the date of receiving the taxable income, the taxpayer may 
object to the tax assessment by applying to the party that 
deducted the tax. 
  "This party shall be required to send this application, 
coupled with its response, to the tax commission concerned 
within 30 days as of the date on which the application is 
submitted. 
  "The commission shall examine the application. If it 
determines that the objections expressed by the taxpayer are 
serious in nature, it shall notify the aforementioned party to 
amend the tax assessment. If not persuaded that the objections 
are sound in nature, the commission shall refer the application 
to the appeals committee in accordance with the provisions of 
article 157 of this law and shall notify the plaintiff concerned 
by registered letter within 30 days as of the date of referral."
